{"ori_id":"93db5f57e96d7f15f55d9ef9e4bff6022dd2bef9","title":"Colonel Jack","context":"Colonel Jack\n The novel begins with Jack as an abandoned illegitimate child, whose attending nurse is instructed by his father to inform Jack when he grows up that he is a \"Gentleman\". The nurse dubs her own son \"Captain Jack\" to differentiate him from the two other Jacks under her care, and provides the protagonist with the name \"Colonel Jack\"; the other she calls \"Major Jack\". The nurse dies when Colonel Jack is ten, and the three young boys, thrown into the outside world, turn to crime; Colonel Jack becomes the assistant to a pick-pocket, Will, and is inducted into the skills of the trade. As the scale and nature of the crimes becomes more severe, Jack begins to understand the harm he is doing.\nAfter wandering the country with Captain Jack and settling in Scotland for a time, the two join the army but soon desert. Making their way to Newcastle, they are tricked into boarding a boat which they believed to be bound for London, but which is actually headed for Virginia. There they are sold into servitude. Jack serves his time and sufficiently impresses his master to become a plantation owner himself. He becomes a reformed character who repents his past life. On a return voyage to England, his ship is captured by the French, and Jack is landed at Bordeaux, where he is exchanged for a French merchant held by the English. Once back in England, and affecting French manners, Jack takes to calling himself Colonel Jacque. He is beguiled into marriage by a fortune-hunter who does not know the extent of his fortune. His wife proves to be a spendthrift and adulteress, and the marriage ends in divorce. Disgruntled, Jack leaves for France, where he purchases a company of soldiers and fights on the side of the French in the wars of the period. After being taken prisoner by the enemy, Jack becomes embroiled into marriage with a calculating woman, who is again an adulteress. He wounds her lover in a duel, and flees back to London.\nJack marries again, though his wife becomes an alcoholic and an adulteress, and finally drinks herself to death. He remarries, but leaves the country after being involved in the unsuccessful Jacobite rising of 1715. He chooses to resettle in Virginia, his new wife, Moggy, having died in the meantime. There Jack encounters his divorced wife, reduced to being a house-keeper on his plantation, with whom he is reconciled and remarries. The colony becomes flooded with captured Jacobite rebels, transported there as punishment. Worried for his own security, Jack and his wife flee to the West Indies under pretence of illness, where he eventually learns of a general pardon of the remaining rebels and that consequently he is a free man. Returning to Virginia to join his wife, who has already made her way back to manage their business interests, Jack's ship is captured by the Spanish, and he finds himself taken to Havana. In spite of being a prisoner, he manages to profit handsomely from illicit trading adventures and soon returns to Virginia. Jack starts to trade on a regular basis with his Spanish contacts, but has to take refuge amongst them when his presence is discovered by the authorities. Pretending to be Spanish, Jack lives comfortably enough for some time, and has further thoughts of repentance and religion. The novel ends with Jack speaking of his intentions to travel to Cadiz, then from there to London, to be rejoined by his wife from Virginia.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The History and Remarkable Life of the\nTruly Honourable Colonel Jacque, Commonly called Colonel Jack, by Daniel Defoe\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

Melopoyn\ntells Random that while waiting in vain for his tragedy to be\nproduced, he wrote some pastorals which were rejected by one\nbookseller after another. A first said merely that the pastorals would\nnot serve; a second advised Melopoyn to offer in their place something\n\"satirical or luscious;\" and a third asked if he \"had got never a\npiece of secret history, thrown into a series of letters, or a volume\nof adventures, such as those of Robinson Crusoe and Colonel Jack, or a\ncollection of conundrums, wherewith to entertain the plantations?\"\nSmollett probably wrote this passage some time in the year 1747, for\n_Roderick Random_ was published in January, 1748. It was twenty-four\nyears earlier--December twentieth, 1722--that _Colonel Jacque_ had\nbeen published, or, to give it the name set forth by its flaunting\ntitle-page:--_The History and Remarkable Life of the truly Honourable\nColonel Jacque, vulgarly called Col. Jack, who was born a Gentleman;\nput 'Prentice to a Pickpocket; was six and twenty years a Thief, and\nthen kidnapped to Virginia; came back a Merchant; was five times\nmarried to four Whores; went into the Wars, behaved bravely, got\nPreferment, was made Colonel of a Regiment; came over, and fled with\nthe Chevalier, is still abroad Completing a Life of Wonders, and\nresolves to die a General_. Surely a book for servants, readers of our\ntime will be apt to think on looking at this title-page; and yet\n_Colonel Jacque_ is found to-day in many a gentleman's library. This\nis no reason, though, why it should still retain considerable\npopularity in Smollett's day. In less time after their appearance,\nsome books which live forever in literature have been forgotten by the\ngreat mass of readers. What was it now that kept _Colonel Jacque_\npopular a quarter of a century after its publication?\n\nIt can hardly be the story which maintained its popularity, for the\ninorganic tale is of the simplest kind. Jacque, like Captain\nSingleton, and Moll Flanders in her childhood, had almost no knowledge\nof his parents. He was brought up by a woman who was well paid for\ntaking the child off his parents' hands--a woman who, though seemingly\nan abandoned character, nevertheless showed the boy kindness. When he\nwas about ten, she died. Then followed the chequered career sketched\nin the title given above. Jacque, trained by a comrade as a\npickpocket, became in time a thief on a larger scale, but not a thief\nquite destitute of good feeling. After he had robbed a poor woman of\nKentish Town of 22_s_. 6\u00c2\u00bd_d_., his conscience was never easy till he\npaid her back the money, a year later; and through all his criminal\nlife, he remembered that his foster-mother had told him he came of\ngentle blood, and accordingly should remember always to be a\ngentleman. The hope of being a gentleman was before him, even when he\nwas kidnapped to Virginia and sold into bondage. There he became such\na favourite of his master that in time he was able to set up as a\nplanter on his own account. From Virginia he returned to England, and\nthence, after the unhappy matrimonial ventures mentioned in the title,\nhe went back to Virginia, where at last he married the wife whom he\nhad previously divorced.\n\nNor could the character of the hero have had much to do in keeping\n_Colonel Jacque_ popular. In spite of his matrimonial achievements, in\nspite of the affection which he rouses in his American employer and\nhis slaves both, Colonel Jacque is with out any attraction which a\nreader can perceive to-day. Like most of Defoe's characters, he is\nwithout fine feeling; he is always looking out for the main chance.\nHis chief interest is commerce; he is a typical \"Anglo-Saxon\" trader.\nThere are thousands and thousands of such clever, prosy, cold-blooded\nbusiness-men in the United States to-day, and in the British colonies,\nand in the United Kingdom. Though Defoe's biographers are divided as\nto whether or not he shared their mercantile cleverness, there is no\ndoubt that Defoe was heartily in sympathy with such men; and his\ninterest in recounting Colonel Jacque's commercial ventures shows him\nto have been what I have already called him--the Yankee trader of the\nQueen Anne writers.\n\nIt was the story of Colonel Jacque's successful trading, no doubt,\nwhich had a large part in sustaining the popularity of his _History_.\nBut even more important in this respect, was that which we have seen\nto be the vital force in all Defoe's fiction--circumstantial\nvividness. This is less striking in the later pages than in the\nearlier. The vividness ceases to a large extent after Jacque goes to\nAmerica, for Defoe did not know America so well as he knew his\nEngland. Yet even when the scene shifts to the further side of the\nocean, Defoe makes no blunders; nothing impossible occurs; his\ngeography is correct. In _Colonel Jacque_, perhaps more than anywhere\nelse, we see that interest of Defoe's in distant British possessions\nwhich made him, as I have said, one of the \"imperialists\" of his time.\nEven so, what vividness there is in the American scenes is too largely\ncommercial. Not many people, other than small traders or would-be\ntraders, could ever have read with interest such a paragraph as the\nfollowing:--\n\n\"With the sloop I sent letters to my wife and to my chief manager with\norders to load her back, as I there directed, viz., that she should\nhave two hundred barrels of flour, fifty barrels of pease; and, to\nanswer my other views, I ordered a hundred bales to be made up of all\nsorts of European goods, such as not my own warehouses only would\nsupply, but such as they could be supplied with in other warehouses\nwhere I knew they had credit for anything.\"\n\nVery different are the earlier pages which deal with Jacque's\nadventures as a poor criminal boy in England. Here Defoe was on ground\nthat he knew thoroughly. Sir Leslie Stephen[1] has observed that Defoe\npassed beyond the bounds of probability when he made his hero, an\nalmost elderly man writing his memoirs in Mexico, remember the details\nof his boyish thieving with marvellous exactness. Barring this\nimprobability--one by the way which you are not aware of while you\nread the scenes in question, for you do not know how long a time will\nelapse before the hero begins to record his experiences--the\nverisimilitude of the first part of _Colonel Jacque_ could not be\nsurpassed. Moreover, in picturing the life of the poor, neglected boy,\nDefoe is unusually sympathetic. And so in the early pages of _Colonel\nJacque_, more than anywhere else, is found the power of the story, the\nsecret of its popularity when Smollett was writing _Roderick Random_,\nand the secret of its appeal to readers to-day. Lamb was hardly\noverstating the case when he declared, \"The beginning of 'Colonel\nJack' is the most affecting, natural picture of a young thief that was\never drawn.\"[2]\n\nAt the end of the second volume of _Colonel Jacque_ will be found two\nof Defoe's earlier political satires:--_The True-Born Englishman_ and\n_The Shortest Way with the Dissenters_. The former, the most\ncelebrated piece of verse which Defoe wrote, was published in January,\n1701. The circumstances which led to its publication are set forth by\nthe author himself in his autobiographical sketch of 1715, _An Appeal\nto Honour and Justice_.\n\nOn the first of August, 1700, according to his statement, there\nappeared \"a vile abhorred pamphlet, in very ill verse, written by one\nMr. Tutchin, and called _The Foreigners_; in which the author . . .\nfell personally upon the King himself, and then upon the Dutch Nation.\nAnd after having reproached his Majesty with crimes that his worst\nenemy could not think of without horror, he sums up all in the odious\nname of _Foreigner_. This filled me with a kind of rage against the\nbook, and gave birth to a trifle which I never could hope should have\nmet with so general an acceptance as it did; I mean _The True-Born\nEnglishman_.\"\n\nThe reason for Tutchin's pamphlet was that William III., never loved\nby the English, became less and less popular after the death of Queen\nMary. A Dutchman, he was supposed to have the interests of Holland\nmore at heart than those of England. This supposition was strengthened\nby the fact that he took no Englishmen into his confidence as he did\nhis old and trusted Dutch friends. These, naturally, shared his\nunpopularity, especially the Duke of Schomberg and the King's\nfavourite minister, William Bentinck, created Earl of Portland, both\nof whom are mentioned by Defoe in his _True-Born Englishman_.\n\nDefoe, in this reply to Tutchin's pamphlet, sought to prove that the\nking and his foreign friends had as good right to the esteem of the\nEnglish as any patriots in the history of the country. In the first\npart of the \"poem,\" as Defoe called his satire, he showed that\nWilliam, with his Dutch blood, was as much entitled to the name of\nEnglishman as any of his subjects, who came of mixed British, Pictish,\nRoman, Saxon, Danish, and Norman blood. In short, Defoe made the\nEnglish out a hybrid race, and with excellent good sense showed that\ntheir national vigour was due largely to their being so. Much of what\nhe said might well be said to-day of the people of the United States,\nas for instance, the following from Defoe's explanatory preface:--\n\n\"The multitudes of foreign nations who have taken sanctuary here, have\nbeen the greatest additions to the wealth and strength of the nation;\nthe essential whereof is the number of its inhabitants. Nor would this\nnation ever have arrived to the degree of wealth and glory it now\nboasts of, if the addition of foreign nations . . . had not been\nhelpful to it. This is so plain, that he who is ignorant of it is too\ndull to be talked with.\"\n\nThe other side to Defoe's picture (and there was another side then as\nnow) is shown in verses which, with a few changes, would likewise be\napplicable to the United States to-day. Defoe is trying to prove that\neven with lapse of years the English race remains hybrid.\n\n\n    \"And lest by length of time it be pretended\n     The climate may this modern breed have mended,\n     Wise Providence, to keep us where we are,\n     Mixes us daily with exceeding care.\n     We have been Europe's sink, the jakes where she\n     Voids all her offal outcast progeny.\n     From our fifth Henry's time, the strolling bands\n     Of banish'd fugitives from neighb'ring lands\n     Have here a certain sanctuary found:\n     Th' eternal refuge of the vagabond,\n     Where, in but half a common age of time,\n     Borr'wing new blood and manners from the clime,\n     Proudly they learn all mankind to contemn,\n     And all their race are true-born Englishmen.\"\n\n\n\nIn the second part of the satire, Defoe tries to describe the nature\nof the English, their pride, and their ingratitude to their\nbenefactors. Among the stanzas in which he hits off the faults of his\ncountrymen, the following, more true than grammatical, is among the\nmost forcible:--\n\n\n    \"Surly to strangers, froward to their friend;\n     Submit to love with a reluctant mind;\n     Resolved to be ungrateful and unkind.\n     If by necessity reduced to ask,\n     The giver has the difficultest task;\n     For what's bestow'd they awkwardly receive,\n     And always take less freely than they give.\n     The obligation is their highest grief;\n     And never love, where they accept relief.\n     So sullen in their sorrows, that 'tis known,\n     They'll rather die than their afflictions own:\n     And if relieved, it is too often true,\n     That they'll abuse their benefactors too;\n     For in distress their haughty stomach's such,\n     They hate to see themselves obliged too much,\n     Seldom contented, often in the wrong;\n     Hard to be pleased at all, and never long.\"\n\n\nDefoe's satire was a success. Written, as it is, in rough verse, at\ntimes little better than doggerel, it is yet always vigorous and\ninteresting. To-day, after a lapse of two hundred years, no verse from\nDefoe's pen is so readable. That it was effective in accomplishing the\npurpose for which it was composed, is proved by the fact that the\npeople, taking the satire good-naturedly, experienced a revulsion of\nfeeling towards the king and his Dutch friends. It was natural that\nthe piece should bring Defoe the increased regard of the king, whose\nfavour he had already to some extent enjoyed. \"This poem was the\noccasion of my being known to His Majesty,\" Defoe wrote in his _Appeal\nto Honour and Justice_; and \"I was afterwards received by him.\"\n\nConcluding the second volume of _Colonel Jacque_ will be found the\nironical _Shortest Way with the Dissenters_, which placed Defoe in the\npillory and in prison. It was written in 1702, the first year of\nAnne's reign, when the strong Tory influence in the government seemed\nlikely to bring back the persecution of Nonconformists which had\nceased in the time of William. From the early summer, when Dr.\nSacheverell preached at Oxford a most inflammatory sermon against the\nDissenters, High Church feeling against them grew stronger and\nstronger. Finally Defoe decided that the best service he could render\nthem was to show the views of the High Church party in all their\nextreme savageness. The result was the pamphlet, _The Shortest Way\nwith the Dissenters; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the\nChurch_, which appeared on the first of December, 1702.\n\nDefoe was so successful in imagining High Tory sentiments in his\npamphlet, that it was received with indignation by the Dissenters\nthemselves and with acclaim by the extreme Churchmen. \"I join with\"\nthe author \"in all he says,\" wrote one of them,[3] to a friend who had\nsent him the pamphlet, \"and have such a value for the book, that, next\nto the Holy Bible and the sacred Comments, I take it for the most\nvaluable piece I have.\" Naturally there was a storm when the truth was\ndiscovered and the High Tories found out that what they had praised\nwas ironical. They were immediately shamed into declaring the pamphlet\na dangerous libel, intended to stir up the Dissenters to civil war.\nDefoe's bookseller and printer were accordingly arrested, and a reward\nwas offered for his apprehension. He gave himself up, was tried, and\nsentenced to pay a fine of two hundred marks, to stand three times in\nthe pillory, and to go to prison for the Queen's pleasure. How Defoe\nconverted his punishment in the pillory into a triumph, and how\nprofitably he employed his time during his imprisonment, have been\nalready told in the introduction to _Robinson Crusoe_.\n\nG.

MAYNADIER.\n\n\n\n\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE\n\n\nSIR,--It is so customary to write prefaces to all books of this kind,\nto introduce them with the more advantage into the world, that I\ncannot omit it, though on that account 'tis thought this work needs a\npreface less than any that ever went before it. The pleasant and\ndelightful part speaks for itself; the useful and instructive is so\nlarge, and capable of so many improvements, that it would employ a\nbook large as itself to make improvements suitable to the vast variety\nof the subject.\n\nHere's room for just and copious observations on the blessings and\nadvantages of a sober and well-governed education, and the ruin of so\nmany thousands of youths of all kinds in this nation for want of it;\nalso, how much public schools and charities might be improved to\nprevent the destruction of so, many unhappy children as in this town\nare every year bred up for the gallows.\n\nThe miserable condition of unhappy children, many of whose natural\ntempers are docible, and would lead them to learn the best things\nrather than the worst, is truly deplorable, and is abundantly seen in\nthe history of this man's childhood; where, though circumstances\nformed him by necessity to be a thief, a strange rectitude of\nprinciples remained with him, and made him early abhor the worst part\nof his trade, and at last wholly leave it off. If he had come into the\nworld with the advantage of education, and been well instructed how to\nimprove the generous principles he had in him, what a man might he not\nhave been!\n\nThe various turns of his fortunes in the world make a delightful field\nfor the reader to wander in; a garden where he may gather wholesome\nand medicinal fruits, none noxious or poisonous; where he will see\nvirtue and the ways of wisdom everywhere applauded, honoured,\nencouraged, rewarded; vice and all kinds of wickedness attended with\nmisery, many kinds of infelicities; and at last, sin and shame going\ntogether, the persons meeting with reproof and reproach, and the\ncrimes with abhorrence.\n\nEvery wicked reader will here be encouraged to a change, and it will\nappear that the best and only good end of an impious, misspent life is\nrepentance; that in this there is comfort, peace, and oftentimes hope,\nand that the penitent shall be returned like the prodigal, _and his\nlatter end be better than his beginning_.\n\nWhile these things, and such as these, are the ends and designs of the\nwhole book, I think I need not say one word more as an apology for any\npart of the rest--no, nor for the whole. If discouraging everything\nthat is evil, and encouraging everything that is virtuous and good--I\nsay, if these appear to be the whole scope and design of the\npublishing this story, no objection can lie against it; neither is it\nof the least moment to inquire whether the Colonel hath told his own\nstory true or not; if he has made it a History or a Parable, it will\nbe equally useful, and capable of doing good; and in that it\nrecommends itself without any introduction.--Your humble servant,\n\nTHE EDITOR.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE\n\n\nSeeing my life has been such a chequer-work of nature, and that I am\nable now to look back upon it from a safer distance than is ordinarily\nthe fate of the clan to which I once belonged, I think my history may\nfind a place in the world as well as some who I see are every day read\nwith pleasure, though they have in them nothing so diverting or\ninstructing as I believe mine will appear to be.\n\nMy original may be as high as anybody's for aught I know, for my\nmother kept very good company; but that part belongs to her story more\nthan to mine. All I know of it is by oral tradition, thus: My nurse\ntold me my mother was a gentlewoman, that my father was a man of\nquality, and she (my nurse) had a good piece of money given her to\ntake me off his hands, and deliver him and my mother from the\nimportunities that usually attend the misfortune of having a child to\nkeep that should not be seen or heard of.\n\nMy father, it seems, gave my nurse something more than was agreed for,\nat my mother's request, upon her solemn promise that she would use me\nwell and let me be put to school; and charged her, that if I lived to\ncome to any bigness, capable to understand the meaning of it, she\nshould always take care to bid me remember that I was a gentleman; and\nthis, he said, was all the education he would desire of her for me;\nfor he did not doubt, he said, but that, some time or other, the very\nhint would inspire me with thoughts suitable to my birth, and that I\nwould certainly act like a gentleman, if I believed myself to be so.\n\nBut my disasters were not directed to end as soon as they began. It is\nvery seldom that the unfortunate are so but for a day; as the great\nrise by degrees of greatness to the pitch of glory in which they\nshine, so the miserable sink to the depth of their misery by a\ncontinued series of disasters, and are long in the tortures and\nagonies of their distressed circumstances, before a turn of fortune,\nif ever such a thing happens to them, gives them a prospect of\ndeliverance.\n\nMy nurse was as honest to the engagement she had entered into as could\nbe expected from one of her employment, and particularly as honest as\nher circumstances would give her leave to be; for she bred me up very\ncarefully with her own son, and with another son of shame like me,\nwhom she had taken upon the same terms.\n\nMy name was John, as she told me, but neither she or I knew anything\nof a surname that belonged to me; so I was left to call myself Mr.\nAnything, what I pleased, as fortune and better circumstances should\ngive occasion.\n\nIt happened that her own son (for she had a little boy of her own,\nabout one year older than I) was called John too; and about two years\nafter she took another son of shame, as I called it above, to keep as\nshe did me, and his name was John too.\n\nAs we were all Johns, we were all Jacques, and soon came to be called\nso; for at that part of the town where we had our breeding, viz., near\nGoodman's Fields, the Johns are generally called Jacque; but my nurse,\nwho may be allowed to distinguish her own son a little from the rest,\nwould have him called captain, because, forsooth, he was the eldest.\n\nI was provoked at having this boy called captain, and I cried, and\ntold my nurse I would be called captain; for she told me I was a\ngentleman, and I would be a captain, that I would. The good woman, to\nkeep the peace, told me, ay, ay, I was a gentleman, and therefore I\nshould be above a captain, for I should be a colonel, and that was a\ngreat deal better than a captain; \"for, my dear,\" says she, \"every\ntarpauling, if he gets but to be lieutenant of a press smack, is\ncalled captain, but colonels are soldiers, and none but gentlemen are\never made colonels. Besides,\" says she, \"I have known colonels come to\nbe lords and generals, though they were bastards at first, and\ntherefore you shall be called colonel.\"\n\nWell, I was hushed indeed with this for the present, but not\nthoroughly pleased, till, a little while after, I heard her tell her\nown boy that I was a gentleman, and therefore he must call me colonel;\nat which her boy fell a-crying, and he would be called colonel. That\npart pleased me to the life, that he should cry to be called colonel,\nfor then I was satisfied that it was above a captain: so universally\nis ambition seated in the minds of men that not a beggar-boy but has\nhis share of it.\n\nSo here was Colonel Jacque and Captain Jacque. As for the third boy,\nhe was only plain Jacque for some years after, till he came to\npreferment by the merit of his birth, as you shall hear in its place.\n\nWe were hopeful boys, all three of us, and promised very early, by\nmany repeated circumstances of our lives, that we would be all rogues;\nand yet I cannot say, if what I have heard of my nurse's character be\ntrue, but the honest woman did what she could to prevent it.\n\nBefore I tell you much more of our story, it would be very proper to\ngive you something of our several characters, as I have gathered them\nup in my memory, as far back as I can recover things, either of myself\nor my brother Jacques, and they shall be brief and impartial.\n\nCaptain Jacque was the eldest of us all, by a whole year. He was a\nsquat, big, strong-made boy, and promised to be stout when grown up to\nbe a man, but not to be tall. His temper was sly, sullen, reserved,\nmalicious, revengeful; and, withal, he was brutish, bloody, and cruel\nin his disposition. He was, as to manners, a mere boor, or clown, of a\ncarman-like breed; sharp as a street-bred boy must be, but ignorant\nand unteachable from a child. He had much the nature of a bull-dog,\nbold and desperate, but not generous at all. All the schoolmistresses\nwe went to could never make him learn--no, not so much as to make him\nknow his letters; and as if he was born a thief, he would steal\neverything that came near him, even as soon almost as he could speak;\nand that not from his mother only, but from anybody else, and from us\ntoo that were his brethren and companions. He was an original rogue,\nfor he would do the foulest and most villainous things, even by his\nown inclination; he had no taste or sense of being honest--no, not, I\nsay, to his brother rogues, which is what other thieves make a point\nof honour of; I mean that of being honest to one another.\n\nThe other, that is to say, the youngest of us Johns, was called Major\nJacque, by the accident following: The lady that had deposited him\nwith our nurse had owned to her that it was a major of the Guards that\nwas the father of the child, but that she was obliged to conceal his\nname, and that was enough. So he was at first called John the Major,\nand afterwards the Major; and at last, when we came to rove together,\nMajor Jacque, according to the rest, for his name was John, as I have\nobserved already.\n\nMajor Jacque was a merry, facetious, pleasant boy, had a good share of\nwit, especially off-hand-wit, as they call it; was full of jests and\ngood humour, and, as I often said, had something of a gentleman in\nhim. He had a true manly courage, feared nothing, and could look death\nin the face without any hesitation; and yet, if he had the advantage,\nwas the most generous and most compassionate creature alive. He had\nnative principles of gallantry in him, without anything of the brutal\nor terrible part that the captain had; and, in a word, he wanted\nnothing but honesty to have made him an excellent man. He had learned\nto read, as I had done; and as he talked very well, so he wrote good\nsense and very handsome language, as you will see in the process of\nhis story.\n\nAs for your humble servant, Colonel Jacque, he was a poor, unhappy,\ntractable dog, willing enough, and capable too, to learn anything, if\nhe had had any but the devil for his schoolmaster. He set out into the\nworld so early, that when he began to do evil, he understood nothing\nof the wickedness of it, nor what he had to expect for it. I remember\nvery well that when I was once carried before a justice, for a theft\nwhich indeed I was not guilty of, and defended myself by argument,\nproving the mistakes of my accusers, and how they contradicted\nthemselves, the justice told me it was a pity I had not been better\nemployed, for I was certainly better taught; in which, however, his\nworship was mistaken, for I had never been taught anything but to be a\nthief; except, as I said, to read and write, and that was all, before\nI was ten years old; but I had a natural talent of talking, and could\nsay as much to the purpose as most people that had been taught no more\nthan I.\n\nI passed among my comrades for a bold, resolute boy, and one that\ndurst fight anything; but I had a different opinion of myself, and\ntherefore shunned fighting as much as I could, though sometimes I\nventured too, and came off well, being very strong made and nimble\nwithal. However, I many times brought myself off with my tongue, where\nmy hands would not have been sufficient, and this as well after I was\na man as while I was a boy.\n\nI was wary and dexterous at my trade, and was not so often catched as\nmy fellow-rogues--I mean while I was a boy, and never after I came to\nbe a man; no, not once for twenty-six years, being so old in the\ntrade, and still unhanged, as you shall hear.\n\nAs for my person, while I was a dirty glass-bottle-house boy, sleeping\nin the ashes, and dealing always in the street dirt, it cannot be\nexpected but that I looked like what I was, and so we did all; that is\nto say, like a \"black-your-shoes-your-honour,\" a beggar-boy, a\nblackguard-boy, or what you please, despicable and miserable to the\nlast degree; and yet I remember the people would say of me, \"That boy\nhas a good face; if he was washed and well dressed, he would be a\ngood, pretty boy. Do but look; what eyes he has; what a pleasant,\nsmiling countenance! 'Tis a pity. I wonder what the rogue's father and\nmother was,\" and the like. Then they would call me, and ask me my\nname, and I would tell them my name was Jacque. \"But what's your\nsurname, sirrah?\" says they. \"I don't know,\" says I. \"Who is your\nfather and mother?\" \"I have none,\" said I. \"What, and never had you\nany?\" said they. \"No,\" says I, \"not that I know of.\" Then they would\nshake their heads and cry, \"Poor boy!\" and \"'Tis a pity,\" and the\nlike; and so let me go. But I laid up all these things in my heart.\n\nI was almost ten years old, the captain eleven, and the major about\neight, when the good woman my nurse died. Her husband was a seaman,\nand had been drowned a little before in the _Gloucester_ frigate, one\nof the king's ships which was cast away going to Scotland with the\nDuke of York in the time of King Charles II., and the honest woman\ndying very poor, the parish was obliged to bury her; when the three\nyoung Jacques attended her corpse, and I, the colonel (for we all\npassed for her own children), was chief mourner; the captain, who was\nthe eldest son, going back very sick.\n\nThe good woman being dead, we, the three Jacques, were turned loose to\nthe world. As to the parish providing for us, we did not trouble\nourselves much about that; we rambled about all three together, and\nthe people in Rosemary Lane and Ratcliff, and that way, knowing us\npretty well, we got victuals easily enough and without much begging.\n\nFor my particular part, I got some reputation for a mighty civil,\nhonest boy; for if I was sent off an errand, I always did it\npunctually and carefully, and made haste again; and if I was trusted\nwith any thing, I never touched it to diminish it, but made it a point\nof honour to be punctual to whatever was committed to me, though I was\nas arrant a thief as any of them in all other cases.\n\nIn like case, some of the poorer shopkeepers would often leave me at\ntheir door, to look after their shops till they went up to dinner, or\ntill they went over the way to an alehouse, and the like, and I always\ndid it freely and cheerfully, and with the utmost honesty.\n\nCaptain Jacque, on the contrary, a surly, ill-looking, rough boy, had\nnot a word in his mouth that savoured either of good manners or good\nhumour; he would say \"Yes\" and \"No,\" just as he was asked a question,\nand that was all, but nobody got any thing from him that was obliging\nin the least. If he was sent off an errand he would forget half of it,\nand it may be go to play, if he met any boys, and never go at all, or\nif he went, never come back with an answer, which was such a\nregardless, disobliging way that nobody had a good word for him, and\neverybody said he had the very look of a rogue, and would come to be\nhanged. In a word, he got nothing of anybody for goodwill, but was, as\nit were, obliged to turn thief for the mere necessity of bread to eat;\nfor if he begged, he did it with so ill a tone, rather like bidding\nfolks give him victuals than entreating them, that one man, of whom he\nhad something given, and knew him, told him one day, \"Captain Jacque,\"\nsays he, \"thou art but an awkward, ugly sort of a beggar, now thou art\na boy; I doubt thou wilt be fitter to ask a man for his purse than for\na penny when thou comest to be a man.\"\n\nThe major was a merry, thoughtless fellow, always cheerful; whether he\nhad any victuals or no, he never complained; and he recommended\nhimself so well by his good carriage that the neighbours loved him,\nand he got victuals enough, one where or other. Thus we all made a\nshift, though we were so little, to keep from starving; and as for\nlodging, we lay in the summer-time about the watch-houses and on\nbulkheads and shop-doors, where we were known. As for a bed, we knew\nnothing what belonged to it for many years after my nurse died;\nand in winter we got into the ash-holes and nealing-arches in the\nglass-house, called Dallow's Glass-house, in Rosemary Lane, or at\nanother glass-house in Ratcliff Highway.\n\nIn this manner we lived for some years; and here we failed not to fall\namong a gang of naked, ragged rogues like ourselves, wicked as the\ndevil could desire to have them be at so early an age, and ripe for\nall the other parts of mischief that suited them as they advanced in\nyears.\n\nI remember that one cold winter night we were disturbed in our rest\nwith a constable and his watch crying out for one Wry-neck, who, it\nseems, had done some roguery, and required a hue-and-cry of that kind;\nand the watch were informed he was to be found among the beggar-boys\nunder the nealing-arches in the glass-house.\n\nThe alarm being given, we were awakened in the dead of the night with\n\"Come out here, ye crew of young devils; come out and show\nyourselves;\" so we were all produced. Some came out rubbing their eyes\nand scratching their heads, and others were dragged out; and I think\nthere was about seventeen of us in all, but Wry-neck as they called\nhim, was not among them. It seems this was a good big boy, that used\nto be among the inhabitants of that place, and had been concerned in a\nrobbery the night before, in which his comrade, who was taken, in\nhopes of escaping punishment, had discovered him, and informed where\nhe usually harboured; but he was aware, it seems, and had secured\nhimself, at least for that time. So we were allowed to return to our\nwarm apartment among the coal-ashes, where I slept many a cold winter\nnight; nay, I may say, many a winter, as sound and as comfortably as\never I did since, though in better lodgings.\n\nIn this manner of living we went on a good while, I believe two years,\nand neither did or meant any harm. We generally went all three\ntogether; for, in short, the captain, for want of address, and for\nsomething disagreeable in him, would have starved if we had not kept\nhim with us. As we were always together, we were generally known by\nthe name of the three Jacques; but Colonel Jacque had always the\npreference, upon many accounts. The major, as I have said, was merry\nand pleasant, but the colonel always held talk with the better sort--I\nmean the better sort of those that would converse with a beggar-boy.\nIn this way of talk I was always upon the inquiry, asking questions of\nthings done in public, as well as in private; particularly, I loved to\ntalk with seamen and soldiers about the war, and about the great\nsea-fights or battles on shore that any of them had been in; and, as I\nnever forgot anything they told me, I could soon, that is to say, in a\nfew years, give almost as good an account of the Dutch war, and of the\nfights at sea, the battles in Flanders, the taking of Maestricht, and\nthe like, as any of those that had been there; and this made those old\nsoldiers and tars love to talk with me too, and to tell me all the\nstories they could think of, and that not only of the wars then going\non, but also of the wars in Oliver's time, the death of King Charles\nI., and the like.\n\nBy this means, as young as I was, I was a kind of an historian; and\nthough I had read no books, and never had any books to read, yet I\ncould give a tolerable account of what had been done and of what was\nthen a-doing in the world, especially in those things that our own\npeople were concerned in. I knew the names of every ship in the navy,\nand who commanded them too, and all this before I was fourteen years\nold, or but very soon after.\n\nCaptain Jacque in this time fell into bad company, and went away from\nus, and it was a good while before we ever heard tale or tidings of\nhim, till about half a year, I think, or thereabouts. I understood he\nwas got among a gang of kidnappers, as they were then called, being a\nsort of wicked fellows that used to spirit people's children away;\nthat is, snatch them up in the dark, and, stopping their mouths, carry\nthem to such houses where they had rogues ready to receive them, and\nso carry them on board ships bound to Virginia, and sell them.\n\nThis was a trade that horrid Jacque, for so I called him when we were\ngrown up, was very fit for, especially the violent part; for if a\nlittle child got into his clutches, he would stop the breath of it,\ninstead of stopping its mouth, and never troubled his head with the\nchild's being almost strangled, so he did but keep it from making a\nnoise. There was, it seems, some villainous thing done by this gang\nabout that time, whether a child was murdered among them, or a child\notherwise abused; but it seems it was a child of an eminent citizen,\nand the parent somehow or other got a scent of the thing, so that they\nrecovered their child, though in a sad condition, and almost killed. I\nwas too young, and it was too long ago, for me to remember the whole\nstory, but they were all taken up and sent to Newgate, and Captain\nJacque among the rest, though he was but young, for he was not then\nmuch above thirteen years old.\n\nWhat punishment was inflicted upon the rogues of that gang I cannot\ntell now, but the captain, being but a lad, was ordered to be three\ntimes soundly whipped at Bridewell, my Lord Mayor, or the Recorder,\ntelling him it was done in pity to him, to keep him from the gallows,\nnot forgetting to tell him that he had a hanging look, and bid him\nhave a care on that very account; so remarkable was the captain's\ncountenance, even so young, and which he heard of afterwards on many\noccasions. When he was in Bridewell I heard of his misfortune, and the\nmajor and I went to see him; for this was the first news we heard of\nwhat became of him.\n\nThe very day that we went he was called out to be corrected, as they\ncalled it, according to his sentence; and as it was ordered to be done\nsoundly, so indeed they were true to the sentence; for the alderman\nwho was the president of Bridewell, and whom I think they called Sir\nWilliam Turner, held preaching to him about how young he was, and what\npity it was such a youth should come to be hanged, and a great deal\nmore; how he should take warning by it, and how wicked a thing it was\nthat they should steal away poor innocent children, and the like; and\nall this while the man with a blue badge on lashed him most\nunmercifully, for he was not to leave off till Sir William knocked\nwith a little hammer on the table.\n\nThe poor captain stamped and danced, and roared out like a mad boy;\nand I must confess I was frighted almost to death; for though I could\nnot come near enough, being but a poor boy, to see how he was handled,\nyet I saw him afterwards with his back all wealed with the lashes, and\nin several places bloody, and thought I should have died with the\nsight of it; but I grew better acquainted with those things\nafterwards.\n\nI did what I could to comfort the poor captain when I got leave to\ncome to him. But the worst was not over with him, for he was to have\ntwo more such whippings before they had done with him; and indeed they\nscourged him so severely that they made him sick of the kidnapping\ntrade for a great while; but he fell in among them again, and kept\namong them as long as that trade lasted, for it ceased in a few years\nafterwards.\n\nThe major and I, though very young, had sensible impressions made\nupon us for some time by the severe usage of the captain, and it might\nbe very well said we were corrected as well as he, though not\nconcerned in the crime; but it was within the year that the major, a\ngood-conditioned, easy boy, was wheedled away by a couple of young\nrogues that frequented the glass-house apartments, to take a walk with\nthem, as they were pleased to call it. The gentlemen were very well\nmatched; the major was about twelve years old, and the oldest of the\ntwo that led him out was not above fourteen. The business was to go to\nBartholomew Fair, and the end of going to Bartholomew Fair was, in\nshort, to pick pockets.\n\nThe major knew nothing of the trade, and therefore was to do nothing;\nbut they promised him a share with them for all that, as if he had\nbeen as expert as themselves. So away they went. The two dexterous\nyoung rogues managed it so well that by eight o'clock at night they\ncame back to our dusty quarters at the glass-house, and, sitting them\ndown in a corner, they began to share their spoil, by the light of the\nglass-house fire. The major lugged out the goods, for as fast as they\nmade any purchase they unloaded themselves, and gave all to him, that,\nif they had been taken, nothing might be found about them.\n\nIt was a devilish lucky day to them, the devil certainly assisting\nthem to find their prey, that he might draw in a young gamester, and\nencourage him to the undertaking, who had been made backward before by\nthe misfortune of the captain. The list of their purchase the first\nnight was as follows:--\n\n1. A white handkerchief from a country wench, as she was staring up at\na jack-pudding; there was 3s. 6d. and a row of pins tied up in one end\nof it.\n\n2. A coloured handkerchief, out of a young country fellow's pocket as\nhe was buying a china orange.\n\n3. A riband purse with 11s. 3d. and a silver thimble in it, out of a\nyoung woman's pocket, just as a fellow offered to pick her up.\n\n_N.B_.--She missed her purse presently, but, not seeing the thief,\ncharged the man with it that would have picked her up, and cried out,\n\"A pickpocket!\" and he fell into the hands of the mob, but, being\nknown in the street, he got off with great difficulty.\n\n4. A knife and fork, that a couple of boys had just bought and were\ngoing home with; the young rogue that took it got it within the minute\nafter the boy had put it in his pocket.\n\n5. A little silver box with 7s. in it, all in small silver, 1d., 2d.,\n3d., 4d. pieces.\n\n_N.B_.--This, it seems, a maid pulled out of her pocket, to pay at her\ngoing into the booth to see a show, and the little rogue got his hand\nin and fetched it off, just as she put it up again.\n\n6. Another silk handkerchief, out of a gentleman's pocket.\n\n7. Another.\n\n8. A jointed baby and a little looking-glass, stolen off a\ntoy-seller's stall in the fair.\n\nAll this cargo to be brought home clear in one afternoon, or evening\nrather, and by only two little rogues so young, was, it must be\nconfessed, extraordinary; and the major was elevated the next day to a\nstrange degree.\n\nHe came very early to me, who lay not far from him, and said to me,\n\"Colonel Jacque, I want to speak with you.\" \"Well,\" said I, \"what do\nyou say?\" \"Nay,\" said he, \"it is business of consequence; I cannot\ntalk here;\" so we walked out. As soon as we were come out into a\nnarrow lane by the glass-house, \"Look here,\" says he, and pulls out\nhis little hand almost full of money.\n\nI was surprised at the sight, when he puts it up again, and, bringing\nhis hand out, \"Here,\" says he, \"you shall have some of it;\" and gives\nme a sixpence and a shilling's worth of the small silver pieces. This\nwas very welcome to me, who, as much as I was of a gentleman, and as\nmuch as I thought of myself upon that account, never had a shilling of\nmoney together before in all my life, not that I could call my own.\n\nI was very earnest then to know how he came by this wealth, for he had\nfor his share 7s. 6d. in money, the silver thimble, and a silk\nhandkerchief, which was, in short, an estate to him, that never had,\nas I said of myself, a shilling together in his life.\n\n\"And what will you do with it now, Jacque?\" said I. \"I do?\" says he.\n\"The first thing I do I'll go into Rag Fair and buy me a pair of shoes\nand stockings.\" \"That's right,\" says I, \"and so will I too;\" so away\nwe went together, and we bought each of us a pair of Rag Fair\nstockings in the first place for fivepence; not fivepence a pair, but\nfivepence together; and good stockings they were too, much above our\nwear, I assure you.\n\nWe found it more difficult to fit ourselves with shoes; but at last,\nhaving looked a great while before we could find any good enough for\nus, we found a shop very well stored, and of these we bought two pair\nfor sixteenpence.\n\nWe put them on immediately, to our great comfort, for we had neither\nof us had any stockings to our legs that had any feet to them for a\nlong time. I found myself so refreshed with having a pair of warm\nstockings on, and a pair of dry shoes--things, I say, which I had not\nbeen acquainted with a great while--that I began to call to my mind my\nbeing a gentleman, and now I thought it began to come to pass. When we\nhad thus fitted ourselves I said, \"Hark ye, Major Jacque, you and I\nnever had any money in our lives before, and we never had a good\ndinner in all our lives. What if we should go somewhere and get some\nvictuals? I am very hungry.\"\n\n\"So we will, then,\" says the major; \"I am hungry too.\" So we went to a\nboiling cook's in Rosemary Lane, where we treated ourselves nobly,\nand, as I thought with myself, we began to live like gentlemen, for we\nhad three pennyworth of boiled beef, two pennyworth of pudding, a\npenny brick (as they call it, or loaf), and a whole pint of strong\nbeer, which was sevenpence in all.\n\n_N.B_.--We had each of us a good mess of charming beef-broth into the\nbargain; and, which cheered my heart wonderfully, all the while we\nwere at dinner, the maid and the boy in the house, every time they\npassed by the open box where we sat at our dinner, would look in and\ncry, \"Gentlemen, do you call?\" and \"Do ye call, gentlemen?\" I say,\nthis was as good to me as all my dinner.\n\nNot the best housekeeper in Stepney parish, not my Lord Mayor of\nLondon, no, not the greatest man on earth, could be more happy in\ntheir own imagination, and with less mixture of grief or reflection,\nthan I was at this new piece of felicity; though mine was but a small\npart of it, for Major Jacque had an estate compared to me, as I had an\nestate compared to what I had before; in a word, nothing but an utter\nignorance of greater felicity, which was my case, could make anybody\nthink himself so exalted as I did, though I had no share of this booty\nbut eighteenpence.\n\nThat night the major and I triumphed in our new enjoyment, and slept\nwith an undisturbed repose in the usual place, surrounded with the\nwarmth of the glass-house fires above, which was a full amends for all\nthe ashes and cinders which we rolled in below.\n\nThose who know the position of the glass-houses, and the arches where\nthey neal the bottles after they are made, know that those places\nwhere the ashes are cast, and where the poor boys lie, are cavities in\nthe brickwork, perfectly close, except at the entrance, and\nconsequently warm as the dressing-room of a bagnio, that it is\nimpossible they can feel any cold there, were it in Greenland or Nova\nZembla, and that therefore the boys lie there not only safe, but very\ncomfortably, the ashes excepted, which are no grievance at all to\nthem.\n\nThe next day the major and his comrades went abroad again, and were\nstill successful; nor did any disaster attend them, for I know not how\nmany months; and, by frequent imitation and direction, Major Jacque\nbecame as dexterous a pickpocket as any of them, and went on through a\nlong variety of fortunes, too long to enter upon now, because I am\nhastening to my own story, which at present is the main thing I have\nto set down.\n\nThe major failed not to let me see every day the effects of his new\nprosperity, and was so bountiful as frequently to throw me a tester,\nsometimes a shilling; and I might perceive that he began to have\nclothes on his back, to leave the ash-hole, having gotten a society\nlodging (of which I may give an explanation by itself on another\noccasion); and which was more, he took upon him to wear a shirt, which\nwas what neither he or I had ventured to do for three years before,\nand upward.\n\nBut I observed all this while, that though Major Jacque was so\nprosperous and had thriven so well, and notwithstanding he was very\nkind, and even generous, to me, in giving me money upon many\noccasions, yet he never invited me to enter myself into the society or\nto embark with him, whereby I might have been made as happy as he; no,\nnor did he recommend the employment to me at all.\n\nI was not very well pleased with his being thus reserved to me. I had\nlearned from him in general that the business was picking of pockets,\nand I fancied that though the ingenuity of the trade consisted very\nmuch in sleight-of-hand, a good address, and being very nimble, yet\nthat it was not at all difficult to learn; and, especially, I thought\nthe opportunities were so many, the country people that come to London\nso foolish, so gaping, and so engaged in looking about them, that it\nwas a trade with no great hazard annexed to it, and might be easily\nlearned, if I did but know in general the manner of it, and how they\nwent about it.\n\nThe subtle devil, never absent from his business, but ready at all\noccasions to encourage his servants, removed all these difficulties,\nand brought him into an intimacy with one of the most exquisite\ndivers, or pickpockets, in the town; and this, our intimacy, was of no\nless a kind than that, as I had an inclination to be as wicked as any\nof them, he was for taking care that I should not be disappointed.\n\nHe was above the little fellows who went about stealing trifles and\nbaubles in Bartholomew Fair, and ran the risk of being mobbed for\nthree or four shillings. His aim was at higher things, even at no less\nthan considerable sums of money, and bills for more.\n\nHe solicited me earnestly to go and take a walk with him as above,\nadding that after he had shown me my trade a little, he would let me\nbe as wicked as I would; that is, as he expressed it, that after he\nhad made me capable, I should set up for myself, if I pleased, and he\nwould only wish me good luck.\n\nAccordingly, as Major Jacque went with his gentlemen only to see the\nmanner, and receive the purchase, and yet come in for a share; so he\ntold me, if he had success, I should have my share as much as if I had\nbeen principal; and this he assured me was a custom of the trade, in\norder to encourage young beginners, and bring them into the trade with\ncourage, for that nothing was to be done if a man had not the heart of\nthe lion.\n\nI hesitated at the matter a great while, objecting the hazard, and\ntelling the story of Captain Jacque, my elder brother, as I might call\nhim. \"Well, colonel,\" says he, \"I find you are faint-hearted, and to\nbe faint-hearted is indeed to be unfit for our trade, for nothing but\na bold heart can go through stitch with this work; but, however, as\nthere is nothing for you to do, so there is no risk for you to run in\nthese things the first time. If I am taken,\" says he, \"you have\nnothing to do in it; they will let you go free; for it shall easily be\nmade appear, that whatever I have done, you had no hand in it.\"\n\nUpon these persuasions I ventured out with him; but I soon found that\nmy new friend was a thief of quality, and a pickpocket above the\nordinary rank, and that aimed higher abundantly than my brother\nJacque. He was a bigger boy than I a great deal; for though I was now\nnear fifteen years old, I was not big of my age; and as to the nature\nof the thing, I was perfectly a stranger to it. I knew indeed what at\nfirst I did not, for it was a good while before I understood the thing\nas an offence. I looked on picking pockets as a kind of trade, and\nthought I was to go apprentice to it. It is true this was when I was\nyoung in the society, as well as younger in years, but even now I\nunderstood it to be only a thing for which, if we were catched, we ran\nthe risk of being ducked or pumped, which we call soaking, and then\nall was over; and we made nothing of having our rags wetted a little;\nbut I never understood, till a great while after, that the crime was\ncapital, and that we might be sent to Newgate for it, till a great\nfellow, almost a man, one of our society, was hanged for it; and then\nI was terribly frighted, as you shall hear by-and-by.\n\nWell, upon the persuasions of this lad, I walked out with him; a poor\ninnocent boy, and (as I remember my very thoughts perfectly well) I\nhad no evil in my intentions. I had never stolen anything in my life;\nand if a goldsmith had left me in his shop, with heaps of money\nstrewed all round me, and bade me look after it, I should not have\ntouched it, I was so honest; but the subtle tempter baited his hook\nfor me, as I was a child, in a manner suited to my childishness, for I\nnever took this picking of pockets to be dishonesty, but, as I have\nsaid above, I looked on it as a kind of trade that I was to be bred up\nto, and so I entered upon it, till I became hardened in it beyond the\npower of retreating. And thus I was made a thief involuntarily, and\nwent on a length that few boys do, without coming to the common period\nof that kind of life--I mean to the transport-ship, or to the gallows.\n\nThe first day I went abroad with my new instructor, he carried me\ndirectly into the city, and as we went first to the water-side, he led\nme into the long-room at the custom-house. We were but a couple of\nragged boys at best, but I was much the worse. My leader had a hat on,\na shirt, and a neckcloth; as for me, I had neither of the three, nor\nhad I spoiled my manners so much as to have a hat on my head since my\nnurse died, which was now some years. His orders to me were to keep\nalways in sight, and near him, but not close to him, nor to take any\nnotice of him at any time till he came to me; and if any hurly-burly\nhappened, I should by no means know him, or pretend to have anything\nto do with him.\n\nI observed my orders to a tittle. While he peered into every corner\nand had his eye upon everybody, I kept my eye directly upon him, but\nwent always at a distance, and on the other side of the long-room,\nlooking as it were for pins, and picking them up out of the dust as I\ncould find them, and then sticking them on my sleeve, where I had at\nlast gotten forty or fifty good pins; but still my eye was upon my\ncomrade, who, I observed, was very busy among the crowds of people\nthat stood at the board doing business with the officers who pass the\nentries and make the cockets, &c.\n\nAt length he comes over to me, and stooping as if he would take up a\npin close to me, he put some thing into my hand, and said, \"Put that\nup, and follow me downstairs quickly.\" He did not run, but shuffled\nalong apace through the crowd, and went down, not the great stairs\nwhich we came in at, but a little narrow staircase at the other end of\nthe long-room. I followed, and he found I did, and so went on, not\nstopping below, as I expected, nor speaking one word to me, till,\nthrough innumerable narrow passages, alleys, and dark ways, we were\ngot up into Fenchurch Street, and through Billiter Lane into\nLeadenhall Street, and from thence into Leadenhall Market.\n\nIt was not a meat-market day, so we had room to sit down upon one of\nthe butchers' stalls, and he bid me lug out. What he had given me was\na little leather letter-case, with a French almanac stuck in the\ninside of it, and a great many papers in it of several kinds.\n\nWe looked them over, and found there was several valuable bills in it,\nsuch as bills of exchange and other notes, things I did not\nunderstand; but among the rest was a goldsmith's note, as he called\nit, of one Sir Stephen Evans, for \u00c2\u00a3300, payable to the bearer, and at\ndemand. Besides this, there was another note for \u00c2\u00a312, 10s., being a\ngoldsmith's bill too, but I forget the name. There was a bill or two\nalso written in French, which neither of us understood, but which, it\nseems, were things of value, being called foreign bills accepted.\n\nThe rogue, my master, knew what belonged to the goldsmiths' bills well\nenough, and I observed, when he read the bill of Sir Stephen, he said,\n\"This is too big for me to meddle with;\" but when he came to the bill\n\u00c2\u00a312, 10s., he said to me, \"This will do. Come hither, Jacque;\" so away\nhe runs to Lombard Street, and I after him, huddling the other papers\ninto the letter-case. As he went along he inquired the name out\nimmediately, and went directly to the shop, put on a good, grave\ncountenance, and had the money paid him without any stop or question\nasked. I stood on the other side the way looking about the street, as\nnot at all concerned with anybody that way, but observed that when he\npresented the bill he pulled out the letter-case, as if he had been a\nmerchant's boy, acquainted with business, and had other bills about\nhim.\n\nThey paid him the money in gold, and he made haste enough in telling\nit over, and came away, passing by me, and going into Three King\nCourt, on the other side of the way; then we crossed back into\nClement's Lane, made the best of our way to Cole Harbour, at the\nwater-side, and got a sculler for a penny to carry us over the water\nto St. Mary Overy's stairs, where we landed, and were safe enough.\n\nHere he turns to me; \"Colonel Jacque,\" says he, \"I believe you are a\nlucky boy; this is a good job. We'll go away to St. George's Fields\nand share our booty.\" Away we went to the Fields, and sitting down in\nthe grass, far enough out of the path, he pulled out the money. \"Look\nhere, Jacque,\" says he, \"did you ever see the like before in your\nlife?\" \"No, never,\" says I; and added very innocently, \"Must we have\nit all?\" \"We have it!\" says he, \"who should have it?\" \"Why,\" says I,\n\"must the man have none of it again that lost it?\" \"He have it again!\"\nsays he. \"What d'ye mean by that?\" \"Nay, I don't know,\" says I. \"Why,\nyou said just now you would let him have the t'other bill again, that\nyou said was too big for you.\"\n\nHe laughed at me. \"You are but a little boy,\" says he, \"that's true,\nbut I thought you had not been such a child neither;\" so he mighty\ngravely explained the thing to me thus: that the bill of Sir Stephen\nEvans was a great bill for \u00c2\u00a3300, \"and if I,\" says he, \"that am but a\npoor lad, should venture to go for the money, they will presently say,\nhow should I come by such a bill, and that I certainly found it or\nstole it; so they will stop me,\" says he, \"and take it away from me,\nand it may bring me into trouble for it too; so,\" says he, \"I did say\nit was too big for me to meddle with, and that I would let the man\nhave it again, if I could tell how. But for the money, Jacque, the\nmoney that we have got, I warrant you he should have none of that.\nBesides,\" says he, \"whoever he be that has lost this letter-case, to\nbe sure, as soon as he missed it, he would run to the goldsmith and\ngive notice that if anybody came for the money they would be stopped;\nbut I am too old for him there,\" says he.\n\n\"Why,\" says I, \"and what will you do with the bill? Will you throw it\naway? If you do, somebody else will find it,\" says I, \"and they will\ngo and take the money.\" \"No, no,\" says he; \"then they will be stopped\nand examined, as I tell you I should be.\" I did not know well what all\nthis meant, so I talked no more about that; but we fell to handling\nthe money. As for me, I had never seen so much together in all my\nlife, nor did I know what in the world to do with it, and once or\ntwice I was a-going to bid him keep it for me, which would have been\ndone like a child indeed, for, to be sure, I had never heard a word\nmore of it, though nothing had befallen him.\n\nHowever, as I happened to hold my tongue as to that part, he shared\nthe money very honestly with me; only at the end he told me, that\nthough it was true he promised me half, yet as it was the first time,\nand I had done nothing but look on, so he thought it was very well if\nI took a little less than he did; so he divided the money, which was\n\u00c2\u00a312, 10s., into two exact parts, viz., \u00c2\u00a36, 5s. in each part; then he\ntook \u00c2\u00a31, 5s. from my part, and told me I should give him that for\nhansel. \"Well,\" says I, \"take it, then, for I think you deserve it\nall:\" so, however, I took up the rest, and \"What shall I do with this\nnow,\" says I, \"for I have nowhere to put it?\" \"Why, have you no\npockets?\" says he. \"Yes,\" says I; \"but they are full of holes.\" I have\noften thought since that, and with some mirth too, how I had really\nmore wealth than I knew what to do with; for lodging I had none, nor\nany box or drawer to hide my money in; nor had I any pocket, but such\nas I say was full of holes. I knew nobody in the world that I could go\nand desire them to lay it up for me; for, being a poor naked, ragged\nboy, they would presently say I had robbed somebody, and perhaps lay\nhold of me, and my money would be my crime, as they say it often is in\nforeign countries. And now, as I was full of wealth, behold I was full\nof care, for what to do to secure my money I could not tell; and this\nheld me so long, and was so vexatious to me the next day, that I truly\nsat down and cried.\n\nNothing could be more perplexing than this money was to me all that\nnight. I carried it in my hand a good while, for it was in gold, all\nbut 14s.; and that is to say, it was in four guineas, and that 14s.\nwas more difficult to carry than the four guineas. At last I sat down\nand pulled off one of my shoes, and put the four guineas into that;\nbut after I had gone a while, my shoe hurt me so I could not go, so I\nwas fain to sit down again and take it out of my shoe, and carry it in\nmy hand. Then I found a dirty linen rag in the street, and I took that\nup and wrapped it all together, and carried it in that a good way. I\nhave often since heard people say, when they have been talking of\nmoney that they could not get in, \"I wish I had it in a foul clout;\"\nin truth, I had mine in a foul clout; for it was foul, according to\nthe letter of that saying, but it served me till I came to a\nconvenient place, and then I sat down and washed the cloth in the\nkennel, and so then put my money in again.\n\nWell, I carried it home with me to my lodging in the glass-house, and\nwhen I went to go to sleep I knew not what to do with it. If I had let\nany of the black crew I was with know of it, I should have been\nsmothered in the ashes for it, or robbed of it, or some trick or other\nput upon me for it; so I knew not what to do, but lay with it in my\nhand, and my hand in my bosom. But then sleep went from my eyes. Oh,\nthe weight of human care! I, a poor beggar-boy, could not sleep so\nsoon as I had but a little money to keep, who before that could have\nslept upon a heap of brick-bats, or stones, or cinders, or anywhere,\nas sound as a rich man does on his down bed, and sounder too.\n\nEvery now and then dropping asleep, I should dream that my money was\nlost, and start like one frighted; then, finding it fast in my hand,\ntry to go to sleep again, but could not for a long while; then drop\nand start again. At last a fancy came into my head that if I fell\nasleep I should dream of the money, and talk of it in my sleep, and\ntell that I had money, which if I should do, and one of the rogues\nshould hear me, they would pick it out of my bosom, and of my hand\ntoo, without waking me; and after that thought I could not sleep a\nwink more; so that I passed that night over in care and anxiety\nenough; and this, I may safely say, was the first night's rest that I\nlost by the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches.\n\nAs soon as it was day I got out of the hole we lay in, and rambled\nabroad in the fields towards Stepney, and there I mused and considered\nwhat I should do with this money, and many a time I wished that I had\nnot had it; for, after all my ruminating upon it, and what course I\nshould take with it, or where I should put it, I could not hit upon\nany one thing, or any possible method to secure it, and it perplexed\nme so that at last, as I said just now, I sat down and cried heartily.\n\nWhen my crying was over the case was the same; I had the money still,\nand what to do with it I could not tell. At last it came into my head\nthat I would look out for some hole in a tree, and seek to hide it\nthere till I should have occasion for it. Big was this discovery, as I\nthen thought it. I began to look about me for a tree; but there were\nno trees in the fields about Stepney or Mile End that looked fit for\nmy purpose; and if there were any that I began to look narrowly at,\nthe fields were so full of people that they would see if I went to\nhide any thing there; and I thought the people eyed me as it was, and\nthat two men in particular followed me to see what I intended to do.\n\nThis drove me farther off, and I crossed the road at Mile End, and in\nthe middle of the town went down a lane that goes away to the Blind\nBeggar's at Bethnal Green. When I came a little way in the lane I\nfound a footpath over the fields, and in those fields several trees\nfor my turn, as I thought. At last one tree had a little hole in it,\npretty high out of my reach, and I climbed up the tree to get it, and\nwhen I came there I put my hand in, and found (as I thought) a place\nvery fit, so I placed my treasure there, and was mighty well satisfied\nwith it; but, behold, putting my hand in again to lay it more\ncommodiously, as I thought, of a sudden it slipped away from me, and I\nfound the tree was hollow, and my little parcel was fallen in quite\nout of my reach, and how far it might go in I knew not; so that, in a\nword, my money was quite gone, irrecoverably lost. There could be no\nroom so much as to hope ever to see it again, for 'twas a vast great\ntree.\n\nAs young as I was, I was now sensible what a fool I was before, that I\ncould not think of ways to keep my mpney, but I must come thus far to\nthrow it into a hole where I could not reach it. Well, I thrust my\nhand quite up to my elbow, but no bottom was to be found, or any end\nof the hole or cavity. I got a stick of the tree, and thrust it in a\ngreat way, but all was one. Then I cried, nay, roared out, I was in\nsuch a passion. Then I got down the tree again, then up again, and\nthrust in my hand again till I scratched my arm and made it bleed, and\ncried all the while most violently. Then I began to think I had not so\nmuch as a halfpenny of it left for a halfpenny roll, and I was hungry,\nand then I cried again. Then I came away in despair, crying and\nroaring like a little boy that had been whipped; then I went back\nagain to the tree, and up the tree again, and thus I did several\ntimes. The last time I had gotten up the tree I happened to come down\nnot on the same side that I went up and came down before, but on the\nother side of the tree, and on the side of the bank also; and, behold,\nthe tree had a great open place in the side of it close to the ground,\nas old hollow trees often have; and looking into the open place, to my\ninexpressible joy, there lay my money and my linen rag, all wrapped up\njust as I had put it into the hole; for the tree being hollow all the\nway up, there had been some moss or light stuff, which I had not\njudgment enough to know was not firm, and had given way when it came\nto drop out of my hand, and so it had slipped quite down at once.\n\nI was but a child, and I rejoiced like a child, for I halloed quite\nout loud when I saw it; then I ran to it, and snatched it up, hugged\nand kissed the dirty rag a hundred times; then danced and jumped\nabout, ran from one end of the field to the other, and, in short, I\nknew not what; much less do I know now what I did, though I shall\nnever forget the thing, either what a sinking grief it was to my heart\nwhen I thought I had lost it, or what a flood of joy overwhelmed me\nwhen I had got it again.\n\nWhile I was in the first transport of my joy, as I have said, I ran\nabout, and knew not what I did; but when that was over I sat down,\nopened the foul clout the money was in, looked at it, told it, found\nit was all there, and then I fell a-crying as savourly as I did\nbefore, when I thought I had lost it.\n\nIt would tire the reader should I dwell on all the little boyish\ntricks that I played in the ecstasy of my joy and satisfaction when I\nhad found my money; so I break off here. Joy is as extravagant as\ngrief, and since I have been a man I have often thought, that had such\na thing befallen a man, so to have lost all he had, and not have a bit\nof bread to eat, and then so strangely to find it again, after having\ngiven it so effectually over--I say, had it been so with a man, it\nmight have hazarded his using some violence upon himself.\n\nWell, I came away with my money, and having taken sixpence out of it,\nbefore I made it up again I went to a chandler's shop in Mile End and\nbought a halfpenny roll and a halfpenny worth of cheese, and sat down\nat the door after I bought it, and ate it very heartily, and begged\nsome beer to drink with it, which the good woman gave me very freely.\n\nAway I went then for the town, to see if I could find any of my\ncompanions, and resolved I would try no more hollow trees for my\ntreasure. As I came along Whitechapel I came by a broker's shop over\nagainst the church, where they sold old clothes, for I had nothing on\nbut the worst of rags; so I stopped at the shop, and stood looking at\nthe clothes which hung at the door.\n\n\"Well, young gentleman,\" says a man that stood at the door, \"you look\nwishfully. Do you see any thing you like, and will your pocket compass\na good coat now, for you look as if you belonged to the ragged\nregiment?\" I was affronted at the fellow. \"What's that to you,\" says\nI, \"how ragged I am? If I had seen anything I liked, I have money to\npay for it; but I can go where I shan't be huffed at for looking.\"\n\nWhile I said thus pretty boldly to the fellow comes a woman out. \"What\nails you,\" says she to the man, \"to bully away our customers so? A\npoor boy's money is as good as my Lord Mayor's. If poor people did not\nbuy old clothes, what would become of our business?\" And then turning\nto me, \"Come hither, child,\" says she; \"if thou hast a mind to\nanything I have, you shan't be hectored by him. The boy is a pretty\nboy, I assure you,\" says she to another woman that was by this time\ncome to her. \"Ay,\" says the t'other, \"so he is, a very well-looking\nchild, if he was clean and well dressed, and may be as good a\ngentleman's son, for anything we know, as any of those that are well\ndressed. Come, my dear,\" says she, \"tell me what is it you would\nhave.\" She pleased me mightily to hear her talk of my being a\ngentleman's son, and it brought former things to my mind; but when she\ntalked of my being not clean and in rags, then I cried.\n\nShe pressed me to tell her if I saw anything that I wanted. I told her\nno, all the clothes I saw there were too big for me. \"Come, child,\"\nsays she, \"I have two things here that will fit you, and I am sure you\nwant them both; that is, first, a little hat, and there,\" says she\n(tossing it to me), \"I'll give you that for nothing. And here is a\ngood warm pair of breeches; I dare say,\" says she, \"they will fit you,\nand they are very tight and good; and,\" says she, \"if you should ever\ncome to have so much money that you don't know what to do with it,\nhere are excellent good pockets,\" says she, \"and a little fob to put\nyour gold in, or your watch in, when you get it.\"\n\nIt struck me with a strange kind of joy that I should have a place to\nput my money in, and need not go to hide it again in a hollow tree,\nthat I was ready to snatch the breeches out of her hands, and wondered\nthat I should be such a fool never to think of buying me a pair of\nbreeches before, that I might have a pocket to put my money in, and\nnot carry it about two days together in my hand, and in my shoes and I\nknew not how; so, in a word, I gave her two shillings for the\nbreeches, and went over into the churchyard and put them on, put my\nmoney into my new pockets, and was as pleased as a prince is with his\ncoach and six horses. I thanked the good woman too for the hat, and\ntold her I would come again when I got more money, and buy some other\nthings I wanted; and so I came away.\n\nI was but a boy, 'tis true, but I thought myself a man, now I had got\na pocket to put my money in, and I went directly to find out my\ncompanion by whose means I got it; but I was frighted out of my wits\nwhen I heard that he was carried to Bridewell. I made no question but\nit was for the letter-case, and that I should be carried there too;\nand then my poor brother Captain Jacque's case came into my head, and\nthat I should be whipped there as cruelly as he was, and I was in such\na fright that I knew not what to do.\n\nBut in the afternoon I met him; he had been carried to Bridewell, it\nseems, upon that very affair, but was got out again. The case was\nthus: having had such good luck at the custom-house the day before, he\ntakes his walk thither again, and as he was in the long-room, gaping\nand staring about him, a fellow lays hold of him, and calls to one of\nthe clerks that sat behind, \"Here,\" says he, \"is the same young rogue\nthat I told you I saw loitering about t'other day, when the gentleman\nlost his letter-case and his goldsmiths' bills; I dare say it was he\nthat stole them.\" Immediately the whole crowd of people gathered about\nthe boy, and charged him point-blank; but he was too well used to such\nthings to be frighted into a confession of what he knew they could not\nprove, for he had nothing about him belonging to it, nor had any money\nbut six pence and a few dirty farthings.\n\nThey threatened him, and pulled and hauled him, till they almost\npulled the clothes off his back, and the commissioners examined him;\nbut all was one; he would own nothing, but said he walked up through\nthe room, only to see the place, both then and the time before, for he\nhad owned he was there before; so, as there was no proof against him\nof any fact, no, nor of any circumstances relating to the letter-case,\nthey were forced at last to let him go. However, they made a show of\ncarrying him to Bridewell, and they did carry him to the gate to see\nif they could make him confess anything; but he would confess nothing,\nand they had no mittimus; so they durst not carry him into the house;\nnor would the people have received him, I suppose, if they had, they\nhaving no warrant for putting him in prison.\n\nWell, when they could get nothing out of him, they carried him into an\nalehouse, and there they told him that the letter-case had bills in it\nof a very great value; that they would be of no use to the rogue that\nhad them, but they would be of infinite damage to the gentleman that\nhad lost them; and that he had left word with the clerk, whom the man\nthat stopped this boy had called to, and who was there with him, that\nhe would give \u00c2\u00a330 to any one that would bring them again, and give all\nthe security that could be desired that he would give them no trouble,\nwhoever it was.\n\nHe was just come from out of their hands when I met with him, and so\nhe told me all the story. \"But,\" says he, \"I would confess nothing,\nand so I got off, and am come away clear.\" \"Well,\" says I, \"and what\nwill you do with the letter-case and the bills? Will you not let the\npoor man have his bills again?\" \"No, not I,\" says he; \"I won't trust\nthem. What care I for their bills?\" It came into my head, as young as\nI was, that it was a sad thing indeed to take a man's bills away for\nso much money, and not have any advantage by it neither; for I\nconcluded that the gentleman who owned the bills must lose all the\nmoney, and it was strange he should keep the bills, and make a\ngentleman lose so much money for nothing. I remember that I ruminated\nvery much about it, and though I did not understand it very well, yet\nit lay upon my mind, and I said every now and then to him, \"Do let the\ngentleman have his bills again; do, pray do;\" and so I teased him,\nwith \"Do\" and \"Pray do,\" till at last I cried about them. He said,\n\"What, would you have me be found out and sent to Bridewell, and be\nwhipped, as your brother Captain Jacque was?\" I said, \"No, I would not\nhave you whipped, but I would have the man have his bills, for they\nwill do you no good, but the gentleman will be undone, it may be.\" And\nthen I added again, \"Do let him have them.\" He snapped me short.\n\"Why,\" says he, \"how shall I get them to him? Who dare carry them? I\ndare not, to be sure, for they will stop me, and bring the goldsmith\nto see if he does not know me, and that I received the money, and so\nthey will prove the robbery, and I shall be hanged. Would you have me\nbe hanged, Jacque?\"\n\nI was silenced a good while with that, for when he said, \"Would you\nhave me be hanged, Jacque?\" I had no more to say. But one day after\nthis he called to me. \"Colonel Jacque,\" says he, \"I have thought of a\nway how the gentleman shall have his bills again; and you and I shall\nget a good deal of money by it, if you will be honest to me, as I was\nto you.\" \"Indeed,\" says I, \"Robin\"--that was his name--\"I will be very\nhonest; let me know how it is, for I would fain have him have his\nbills.\"\n\n\"Why,\" says he, \"they told me that he had left word at the clerk's\nplace in the long-room that he would give \u00c2\u00a330 to any one that had the\nbills, and would restore them, and would ask no questions. Now, if you\nwill go, like a poor innocent boy, as you are, into the long-room and\nspeak to the clerk, it may do. Tell him if the gentleman will do as he\npromised, you believe you can tell him who has it; and if they are\ncivil to you, and willing to be as good as their words, you shall have\nthe letter-case, and give it them.\"\n\nI told him ay, I would go with all my heart. \"But, Colonel Jacque,\"\nsays he, \"what if they should take hold of you and threaten to have\nyou whipped? Won't you discover me to them?\" \"No,\" says I; \"if they\nwould whip me to death I won't.\" \"Well, then,\" says he, \"there's the\nletter-case; do you go.\" So he gave me directions how to act and what\nto say; but I would not take the letter-case with me, lest they should\nprove false, and take hold of me, thinking to find it upon me, and so\ncharge me with the fact; so I left it with him. And the next morning I\nwent to the custom-house, as was agreed. What my directions were will,\nto avoid repetition, appear in what happened; it was an errand of too\nmuch consequence indeed to be entrusted to a boy, not only so young as\nI was, but so little of a rogue as I was yet arrived to the degree of.\n\nTwo things I was particularly armed with, which I resolved upon: 1.\nThat the man should have his bills again; for it seemed a horrible\nthing to me that he should be made to lose his money, which I supposed\nhe must, purely because we would not carry the letter-case home. 2.\nThat whatever happened to me, I was never to tell the name of my\ncomrade Robin, who had been the principal. With these two pieces of\nhonesty, for such they were both in themselves, and with a manly\nheart, though a boy's head, I went up into the long-room in the\ncustom-house the next day.\n\nAs soon as I came to the place where the thing was done, I saw the man\nsit just where he had sat before, and it ran in my head that he had\nsat there ever since; but I knew no better; so I went up, and stood\njust at that side of the writing-board that goes upon that side of the\nroom, and which I was but just tall enough to lay my arms upon.\n\nWhile I stood there one thrust me this way, and another thrust me that\nway, and the man that sat behind began to look at me. At last he\ncalled out to me, \"What does that boy do there? Get you gone, sirrah!\nAre you one of the rogues that stole the gentleman's letter-case a\nMonday last?\" Then he turns his tale to a gentleman that was doing\nbusiness with him, and goes on thus: \"Here was Mr. ---- had a very\nunlucky chance on Monday last. Did not you hear of it?\" \"No, not I,\"\nsays the gentleman. \"Why, standing just there, where you do,\" says he,\n\"making his entries, he pulled out his letter-case, and laid it down,\nas he says, but just at his hand, while he reached over to the\nstandish there for a penful of ink, and somebody stole away his\nletter-case.\"\n\n\"His letter-case!\" says t'other. \"What, and was there any bills in\nit?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" says he, \"there was Sir Stephen Evans's note in it for \u00c2\u00a3300, and\nanother goldsmith's bill for about \u00c2\u00a312; and which is worse still for\nthe gentleman, he had two foreign accepted bills in it for a great\nsum--I know not how much. I think one was a French bill for 1200\ncrowns.\"\n\n\"And who could it be?\" says the gentleman.\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" says he; \"but one of our room-keepers says he saw a\ncouple of young rogues like that,\" pointing at me, \"hanging about\nhere, and that on a sudden they were both gone.\"\n\n\"Villains!\" says he again. \"Why, what can they do with them? They will\nbe of no use to them. I suppose he went immediately and gave notice to\nprevent the payment.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" says the clerk, \"he did; but the rogues were too nimble for him\nwith the little bill of \u00c2\u00a312 odd money; they went and got the money for\nthat, but all the rest are stopped. However, 'tis an unspeakable\ndamage to him for want of his money.\"\n\n\"Why, he should publish a reward for the encouragement of those that\nhave them to bring them again; they would be glad to bring them, I\nwarrant you.\"\n\n\"He has posted it up at the door that he will give \u00c2\u00a330 for them.\"\n\n\"Ay; but he should add that he will promise not to stop or give any\ntrouble to the person that brings them.\"\n\n\"He has done that too,\" says he; \"but I fear they won't trust\nthemselves to be honest, for fear he should break his word.\"\n\n\"Why? It is true he may break his word in that case, but no man should\ndo so; for then no rogue will venture to bring home anything that is\nstolen, and so he would do an injury to others after him.\"\n\n\"I durst pawn my life for him, he would scorn it.\"\n\nThus far they discoursed of it, and then went off to something else. I\nheard it all, but did not know what to do a great while; but at last,\nwatching the gentleman that went away, when he was gone I ran after\nhim to have spoken to him, intending to have broke it to him, but he\nwent hastily into a room or two full of people at the hither end of\nthe long-room; and when I went to follow, the doorkeepers turned me\nback, and told me I must not go in there; so I went back, and loitered\nabout near the man that sat behind the board, and hung about there\ntill I found the clock struck twelve, and the room began to be thin of\npeople; and at last he sat there writing, but nobody stood at the\nboard before him, as there had all the rest of the morning. Then I\ncame a little nearer, and stood close to the board, as I did before;\nwhen, looking up from his paper, and seeing me, says he to me, \"You\nhave been up and down here all this morning, sirrah! What do you want?\nYou have some business that is not very good, I doubt.\"\n\n\"No, I han't,\" said I.\n\n\"No? It is well if you han't,\" says he. \"Pray, what business can you\nhave in the long-room, sir? You are no merchant.\"\n\n\"I would speak with you,\" said I.\n\n\"With me!\" says he. \"What have you to say to me?\"\n\n\"I have something to say,\" said I, \"if you will do me no harm for it.\"\n\n\"I do thee harm, child! What harm should I do thee?\" and spoke very\nkindly.\n\n\"Won't you indeed, sir?\" said I.\n\n\"No, not I, child; I'll do thee no harm. What is it? Do you know\nanything of the gentleman's letter-case?\"\n\nI answered, but spoke softly that he could not hear me; so he gets\nover presently into the seat next him, and opens a place that was made\nto come out, and bade me come in to him; and I did.\n\nThen he asked me again if I knew anything of the letter-case.\n\nI spoke softly again, and said folks would hear him.\n\nThen he whispered softly, and asked me again.\n\nI told him I believed I did, but that, indeed, I had it not, nor had\nno hand in stealing it, but it was gotten into the hands of a boy that\nwould have burned it, if it had not been for me; and that I heard him\nsay that the gentleman would be glad to have them again, and give a\ngood deal of money for them.\n\n\"I did say so, child,\" said he; \"and if you can get them for him, he\nshall give you a good reward, no less than \u00c2\u00a330, as he has promised.\"\n\n\"But you said too, sir, to the gentleman just now,\" said I, \"that you\nwas sure he would not bring them into any harm that should bring\nthem.\"\n\n\"No, you shall come to no harm. I will pass my word for it.\"\n\n_Boy_. Nor shan't they make me bring other people into trouble?\n\n_Gent_. No; you shall not be asked the name of anybody, nor to tell\nwho they are.\n\n_Boy_. I am but a poor boy, and I would fain have the gentleman have\nhis bills; and indeed I did not take them away, nor I han't got them.\n\n_Gent_. But can you tell how the gentleman shall have them?\n\n_Boy_. If I can get them, I will bring them to you to-morrow morning.\n\n_Gent_. Can you not do it to-night?\n\n_Boy_. I believe I may if I knew where to come.\n\n_Gent_. Come to my house, child.\n\n_Boy_. I don't know where you live.\n\n_Gent_. Go along with me now, and you shall see.\n\nSo he carried me up into Tower Street, and showed me his house, and\nordered me to come there at five o'clock at night; which accordingly I\ndid, and carried the letter-case with me.\n\nWhen I came the gentleman asked me if I had brought the book, as he\ncalled it.\n\n\"It is not a book,\" said I.\n\n\"No, the letter-case; that's all one,\" says he.\n\n\"You promised me,\" said I, \"you would not hurt me,\" and cried.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, child,\" says he. \"I will not hurt thee, poor boy;\nnobody shall hurt thee.\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said I, and pulled it out.\n\nHe then brought in another gentleman, who, it seems, owned the\nletter-case, and asked him if that was it, and he said, \"Yes.\"\n\nThen he asked me if all the bills were in it.\n\nI told him I heard him say there was one gone, but I believed there\nwas all the rest.\n\n\"Why do you believe so?\" says he.\n\n\"Because I heard the boy that I believe stole them say they were too\nbig for him to meddle with.\"\n\nThe gentleman then that owned them said, \"Where is the boy?\"\n\nThen the other gentleman put in, and said, \"No, you must not ask him\nthat; I passed my word that you should not, and that he should not be\nobliged to tell it to anybody.\"\n\n\"Well, child,\" says he, \"you will let us see the letter-case opened,\nand whether the bills are in it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" says I.\n\nThen the first gentleman said, \"How many bills were there in it?\"\n\n\"Only three,\" says he. \"Besides the bill of \u00c2\u00a312, 10s., there was Sir\nStephen Evans's note for \u00c2\u00a3300 and two foreign bills.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if they are in the letter-case, the boy shall have \u00c2\u00a330,\nshall he not?\" \"Yes,\" says the gentleman; \"he shall have it very\nfreely.\"\n\n\"Come, then, child,\" says he, \"let me open it.\"\n\nSo I gave it him, and he opened it, and there were all three bills,\nand several other papers, fair and safe, nothing defaced or\ndiminished; and the gentleman said, \"All is right.\"\n\nThen said the first man, \"Then I am security to the poor boy for the\nmoney.\" \"Well, but,\" says the gentleman, \"the rogues have got the \u00c2\u00a312,\n10s.; they ought to reckon that as part of the \u00c2\u00a330.\" Had he asked me,\nI should have consented to it at first word; but the first man stood\nmy friend. \"Nay,\" says he, \"it was since you knew that the \u00c2\u00a312, 10s.\nwas received that you offered \u00c2\u00a330 for the other bills, and published\nit by the crier, and posted it up at the custom-house door, and I\npromised him the \u00c2\u00a330 this morning.\" They argued long, and I thought\nwould have quarrelled about it.\n\nHowever, at last they both yielded a little, and the gentleman gave me\n\u00c2\u00a325 in good guineas. When he gave it me he bade me hold out my hand,\nand he told the money into my hand; and when he had done he asked me\nif it was right. I said I did not know, but I believed it was. \"Why,\"\nsays he, \"can't you tell it?\" I told him no; I never saw so much money\nin my life, nor I did not know how to tell money. \"Why,\" says he,\n\"don't you know that they are guineas?\" No, I told him, I did not know\nhow much a guinea was.\n\n\"Why, then,\" says he, \"did you tell me you believed it was right?\" I\ntold him, because I believed he would not give it me wrong.\n\n\"Poor child,\" says he, \"thou knowest little of the world, indeed. What\nart thou?\"\n\n\"I am a poor boy,\" says I, and cried.\n\n\"What is your name?\" says he. \"But hold, I forgot,\" said he; \"I\npromised I would not ask your name, so you need not tell me.\"\n\n\"My name is Jacque,\" said I.\n\n\"Why, have you no surname?\" said he.\n\n\"What is that?\" said I.\n\n\"You have some other name besides Jacque,\" says he, \"han't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" says I; \"they call me Colonel Jacque.\"\n\n\"But have you no other name?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I.\n\n\"How came you to be Colonel Jacque, pray?\"\n\n\"They say,\" said I, \"my father's name was Colonel.\"\n\n\"Is your father or mother alive?\" said he.\n\n\"No,\" said I; \"my father is dead.\"\n\n\"Where is your mother, then?\" said he.\n\n\"I never had e'er a mother,\" said I.\n\nThis made him laugh. \"What,\" said he, \"had you never a mother? What,\nthen?\"\n\n\"I had a nurse,\" said I; \"but she was not my mother.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says he to the gentleman, \"I dare say this boy was not the\nthief that stole your bills.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir, I did not steal them,\" said I, and cried again.\n\n\"No, no, child,\" said he, \"we don't believe you did. This is a very\nclever boy,\" says he to the other gentleman, \"and yet very ignorant\nand honest; 'tis pity some care should not be taken of him, and\nsomething done for him. Let us talk a little more with him.\" So they\nsat down and drank wine, and gave me some, and then the first\ngentleman talked to me again.\n\n\"Well,\" says he, \"what wilt thou do with this money now thou hast it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said I.\n\n\"Where will you put it?\" said he,\n\n\"In my pocket,\" said I.\n\n\"In your pocket!\" said he. \"Is your pocket whole? Shan't you lose it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"my pocket is whole.\"\n\n\"And where will you put it when you get home?\"\n\n\"I have no home,\" said I, and cried again.\n\n\"Poor child!\" said he. \"Then what dost thou do for thy living?\"\n\n\"I go of errands,\" said I, \"for the folks in Rosemary Lane.\"\n\n\"And what dost thou do for a lodging at night?\"\n\n\"I lie at the glass-house,\" said I, \"at night.\"\n\n\"How, lie at the glass-house! Have they any beds there?\" says he.\n\n\"I never lay in a bed in my life,\" said I, \"as I remember.\"\n\n\"Why,\" says he, \"what do you lie on at the glass-house?\"\n\n\"The ground,\" says I; \"and sometimes a little straw, or upon the warm\nashes.\"\n\nHere the gentleman that lost the bills said, \"This poor child is\nenough to make a man weep for the miseries of human nature, and be\nthankful for himself; he puts tears into my eyes.\" \"And into mine\ntoo,\" says the other.\n\n\"Well, but hark ye, Jacque,\" says the first gentleman, \"do they give\nyou no money when they send you of errands?\"\n\n\"They give me victuals,\" said I, \"and that's better.\"\n\n\"But what,\" says he, \"do you do for clothes?\"\n\n\"They give me sometimes old things,\" said I, \"such as they have to\nspare.\"\n\n\"Why, you have never a shirt on, I believe,\" said he, \"have you?\"\n\n\"No; I never had a shirt,\" said I, \"since my nurse died.\"\n\n\"How long ago is that?\" said he.\n\n\"Six winters, when this is out,\" said I.\n\n\"Why, how old are you?\" said he.\n\n\"I can't tell,\" said I.\n\n\"Well,\" says the gentleman, \"now you have this money, won't you buy\nsome clothes and a shirt with some of it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"I would buy some clothes.\"\n\n\"And what will you do with the rest?\"\n\n\"I can't tell,\" said I, and cried.\n\n\"What dost cry for, Jacque?\" said he.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said I, and cried still.\n\n\"What art afraid of?\"\n\n\"They will know I have money.\"\n\n\"Well, and what then?\"\n\n\"Then I must sleep no more in the warm glass house, and I shall be\nstarved with cold. They will take away my money.\"\n\n\"But why must you sleep there no more?\"\n\nHere the gentlemen observed to one another how naturally anxiety and\nperplexity attend those that have money. \"I warrant you,\" says the\nclerk, \"when this poor boy had no money he slept all night in the\nstraw, or on the warm ashes in the glass-house, as soundly and as void\nof care as it would be possible for any creature to do; but now, as\nsoon as he has gotten money, the care of preserving it brings tears\ninto his eyes and fear into his heart.\"\n\nThey asked me a great many questions more, to which I answered in my\nchildish way as well as I could, but so as pleased them well enough.\nAt last I was going away with a heavy pocket, and I assure you not a\nlight heart, for I was so frighted with having so much money that I\nknew not what in the earth to do with myself. I went away, however,\nand walked a little way, but I could not tell what to do; so, after\nrambling two hours or thereabout, I went back again, and sat down at\nthe gentleman's door, and there I cried as long as I had any moisture\nin my head to make tears of, but never knocked at the door.\n\nI had not sat long, I suppose, but somebody belonging to the family\ngot knowledge of it, and a maid came and talked to me, but I said\nlittle to her, only cried still. At length it came to the gentleman's\nears. As for the merchant, he was gone. When the gentleman heard of me\nhe called me in, and began to talk with me again, and asked me what I\nstayed for.\n\nI told him I had not stayed there all that while, for I had been gone\na great while, and was come again.\n\n\"Well,\" says he, \"but what did you come again for?\"\n\n\"I can't tell,\" says I.\n\n\"And what do you cry so for?\" said he. \"I hope you have not lost your\nmoney, have you?\"\n\nNo, I told him, I had not lost it yet, but was afraid I should.\n\n\"And does that make you cry?\" says he.\n\nI told him yes, for I knew I should not be able to keep it, but they\nwould cheat me of it, or they would kill me and take it away from me\ntoo.\n\n\"They?\" says he. \"Who? What sort of gangs of people art thou with?\"\n\nI told him they were all boys, but very wicked boys; \"thieves and\npickpockets,\" said I, \"such as stole this letter-case--a sad pack; I\ncan't abide them.\"\n\n\"Well, Jacque,\" said he, \"what shall be done for thee? Will you leave\nit with me? Shall I keep it for you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"with all my heart, if you please.\"\n\n\"Come, then,\" says he, \"give it me; and that you may be sure that I\nhave it, and you shall have it honestly again, I'll give you a bill\nfor it, and for the interest of it, and that you may keep safe enough.\nNay,\" added he, \"and if you lose it, or anybody takes it from you,\nnone shall receive the money but your self, or any part of it.\"\n\nI presently pulled out all the money, and gave it to him, only keeping\nabout 15s. for myself to buy some clothes; and thus ended the\nconference between us on the first occasion, at least for the first\ntime. Having thus secured my money to my full satisfaction, I was then\nperfectly easy, and accordingly the sad thoughts that afflicted my\nmind before began to vanish away.\n\nThis was enough to let any one see how all the sorrows and anxieties\nof men's lives come about; how they rise from their restless pushing\nat getting of money, and the restless cares of keeping it when they\nhave got it. I that had nothing, and had not known what it was to have\nhad anything, knew nothing of the care, either of getting or of\nkeeping it; I wanted nothing, who wanted everything; I had no care, no\nconcern about where I should get my victuals or how I should lodge; I\nknew not what money was, or what to do with it; and never knew what it\nwas not to sleep till I had money to keep, and was afraid of losing\nit.\n\nI had, without doubt, an opportunity at this time, if I had not been\ntoo foolish, and too much a child to speak for myself--I had an\nopportunity, I say, to have got into the service, or perhaps to be\nunder some of the care and concern, of these gentlemen; for they\nseemed to be very fond of doing some thing for me, and were surprised\nat the innocence of my talk to them, as well as at the misery (as they\nthought it) of my condition.\n\nBut I acted indeed like a child; and leaving my money, as I have said,\nI never went near them for several years after. What course I took,\nand what befell me in that interval, has so much variety in it, and\ncarries so much instruction in it, that it requires an account of it\nby itself.\n\nThe first happy chance that offered itself to me in the world was now\nover. I had got money, but I neither knew the value of it or the use\nof it; the way of living I had begun was so natural to me, I had no\nnotion of bettering it; I had not so much as any desire of buying me\nany clothes--no, not so much as a shirt; and much less had I any\nthought of getting any other lodging than in the glass-house, and\nloitering about the streets, as I had done; for I knew no good, and\nhad tasted no evil; that is to say, the life I had led being not evil\nin my account.\n\nIn this state of ignorance I returned to my really miserable life; so\nit was in itself, and was only not so to me because I did not\nunderstand how to judge of it, and had known no better.\n\nMy comrade that gave me back the bills, and who, if I had not pressed\nhim, designed never to have restored them, never asked me what I had\ngiven me, but told me if they gave me anything it should be my own;\nfor, as he said he would not run the venture of being seen in the\nrestoring them, I deserved the reward if there was any; neither did he\ntrouble his head with inquiring what I had, or whether I had anything\nor no; so my title to what I had got was clear.\n\nI went now up and down just as I did before. I had money indeed in my\npocket, but I let nobody know it. I went of errands cheerfully as\nbefore, and accepted of what anybody gave me with as much thankfulness\nas ever. The only difference that I made with myself was, that if I\nwas hungry, and nobody employed me, or gave me anything to eat, I\ndid not beg from door to door, as I did at first, but went to a\nboiling-house, as I said once before, and got a mess of broth and a\npiece of bread, price a halfpenny; very seldom any meat; or if I\ntreated myself, it was a halfpennyworth of cheese; all which expense\ndid not amount to above twopence or three pence a week; for, contrary\nto the usage of the rest of the tribe, I was extremely frugal, and I\nhad not disposed of any of the guineas which I had at first; neither,\nas I said to the custom-house gentleman, could I tell what a guinea\nwas made of, or what it was worth.\n\nAfter I had been about a month thus, and had done nothing, my comrade,\nas I called him, came to me one morning. \"Colonel Jacque,\" says he,\n\"when shall you and I take a walk again?\" \"When you will,\" said I.\n\"Have you got no business yet?\" says he. \"No,\" says I; and so one\nthing bringing on another, he told me I was a fortunate wretch, and he\nbelieved I would be so again, but that he must make a new bargain with\nme now; \"for,\" says he, \"colonel, the first time we always let a raw\nbrother come in for full share to encourage him; but afterwards,\nexcept it be when he puts himself forward well and runs equal hazard,\nhe stands to courtesy; but as we are gentlemen, we always do very\nhonourably by one another; and if you are willing to trust it or leave\nit to me, I shall do handsomely by you, that you may depend upon.\" I\ntold him I was not able to do anything, that was certain, for I did\nnot understand it, and therefore I could not expect to get anything,\nbut I would do as he bade me; so we walked abroad together.\n\nWe went no more to the custom-house; it was too bold a venture.\nBesides, I did not care to show myself again, especially with him in\ncompany. But we went directly to the Exchange, and we hankered about\nin Castle Alley, and in Swithin's Alley, and at the coffee-house\ndoors. It was a very unlucky day, for we got nothing all day but two\nor three handkerchiefs, and came home to the old lodgings at the\nglass-house; nor had I had anything to eat or drink all day but a\npiece of bread which he gave me, and some water at the conduit at the\nExchange Gate. So when he was gone from me, for he did not lie in the\nglass-house, as I did, I went to my old broth-house for my usual bait,\nand refreshed myself, and the next day early went to meet him again,\nas he appointed me.\n\nBeing early in the morning, he took his walk to Billingsgate, where it\nseems two sorts of people make a great crowd as soon as it is light,\nand at that time a-year rather before daylight; that is to say, crimps\nand the masters of coal-ships, whom they call collier-masters; and,\nsecondly, fishmongers, fish-sellers, and buyers of fish.\n\nIt was the first of these people that he had his eye upon. So he gives\nme my orders, which was thus: \"Go you,\" says he, \"into all the\nalehouses as we go along, and observe where any people are telling of\nmoney; and when you find any, come and tell me.\" So he stood at the\ndoor, and I went into the houses. As the collier-masters generally\nsell their coals at the gate, as they call it, so they generally\nreceive their money in those alehouses; and it was not long before I\nbrought him word of several. Upon this he went in and made his\nobservations, but found nothing to his purpose. At length I brought\nhim word that there was a man in such a house who had received a great\ndeal of money of somebody, I believed of several people, and that it\nlay all upon the table in heaps, and he was very busy writing down the\nsums and putting it up in several bags. \"Is he?\" says he; \"I'll\nwarrant him I will have some of it;\" and in he goes. He walks up and\ndown the house, which had several open tables and boxes in it, and he\nlistened to hear, if he could, what the man's name was; and he heard\nsomebody call him Cullum, or some such name. Then he watches his\nopportunity, and steps up to him, and tells him a long story, that\nthere was two gentlemen at the Gun tavern sent him to inquire for him,\nand to tell him they desired to speak with him.\n\nThe collier-master had his money lay before him, just as I had told\nhim, and had two or three small payments of money, which he had put up\nin little black dirty bags, and lay by themselves; and as it was\nhardly broad day, he found means in delivering his message to lay his\nhands upon one of those bags, and carry it off perfectly undiscovered.\n\nWhen we had got it he came out to me, who stood but at the door, and\npulling me by the sleeve, \"Run, Jacque,\" says he, \"for our lives;\" and\naway he scours, and I after him, never resting, or scarce looking\nabout me, till we got quite up into Fenchurch Street, through Lime\nStreet into Leadenhall Street, down St. Mary Axe to London Wall, then\nthrough Bishopsgate Street and down Old Bedlam into Moorfields. By\nthis time we were neither of us able to run very fast; nor need we\nhave gone so far, for I never found that anybody pursued us. When we\ngot into Moorfields and began to take breath, I asked him what it was\nfrighted him so. \"Fright me, you fool!\" says he; \"I have got a\ndevilish great bag of money.\" \"A bag!\" said I. \"Ay, ay,\" said he; \"let\nus get out into the fields where nobody can see us, and I'll show it\nyou.\" So away he had me through Long Alley, and cross Hog Lane and\nHolloway Lane, into the middle of the great field, which since that\nhas been called the Farthing Pie-House Fields. There we would have sat\ndown, but it was all full of water; so we went on, crossed the road at\nAnniseed Cleer, and went into the field where now the great hospital\nstands; and finding a by-place, we sat down, and he pulls out the bag.\n\"Thou art a lucky boy, Jacque,\" says he; \"thou deservest a good share\nof this job, truly; for it is all along of thy lucky news.\" So he\npours it all out into my hat; for, as I told you, I now wore a hat.\n\nHow he did to whip away such a bag of money from any man that was\nawake and in his senses I cannot tell; but there was a great deal in\nit, and among it a paperful by itself. When the paper dropped out of\nthe bag, \"Hold,\" says he, \"that is gold!\" and began to crow and hollow\nlike a mad boy. But there he was baulked; for it was a paper of old\nthirteenpence-halfpenny pieces, half and quarter pieces, with\nninepences and fourpence-halfpennies--all old crooked money, Scotch\nand Irish coin; so he was disappointed in that. But as it was there\nwas about \u00c2\u00a317 or \u00c2\u00a318 in the bag, as I understood by him; for I could\nnot tell money, not I.\n\nWell, he parted this money into three; that is to say, into three\nshares--two for himself and one for me, and asked if I was content. I\ntold him yes, I had reason to be contented. Besides, it was so much\nmoney added to that I had left of his former adventure that I knew not\nwhat to do with it, or with myself, while I had so much about me.\n\nThis was a most exquisite fellow for a thief; for he had the greatest\ndexterity at conveying anything away that he scarce ever pitched upon\nanything in his eye but he carried it off with his hands, and never\nthat I know of missed his aim or was caught in the fact.\n\nHe was an eminent pickpocket, and very dexterous at ladies' gold\nwatches; but he generally pushed higher at such desperate things as\nthese; and he came off the cleanest and with the greatest success\nimaginable; and it was in these kinds of the wicked art of thieving\nthat I became his scholar.\n\nAs we were now so rich, he would not let me lie any longer in the\nglass-house, or go naked and ragged as I had done, but obliged me to\nbuy two shirts, a waistcoat, and a greatcoat; for a greatcoat was more\nfor our purpose in the business we was upon than any other. So I\nclothed myself as he directed, and he took me a lodging in the same\nhouse with him, and we lodged together in a little garret fit for our\nquality.\n\nSoon after this we walked out again, and then we tried our fortune in\nthe places by the Exchange a second time. Here we began to act\nseparately, and I undertook to walk by myself; and the first thing I\ndid accurately was a trick I played that argued some skill for a new\nbeginner; for I had never seen any business of that kind done before.\nI saw two gentlemen mighty eager in talk, and one pulled out a\npocket-book two or three times, and then slipt it into his coat-pocket\nagain, and then out it came again, and papers were taken out and\nothers were put in; and then in it went again, and so several times;\nthe man being still warmly engaged with another man, and two or three\nothers standing hard by them. The last time he put his pocket-book\ninto his pocket, he might be said to throw it in rather than put it in\nwith his hand, and the book lay end-way, resting upon some other book\nor something else in his pocket; so that it did not go quite down, but\none corner of it was seen above his pocket.\n\nThis careless way of men putting their pocket-books into a\ncoat-pocket, which is so easily dived into by the least boy that has\nbeen used to the trade, can never be too much blamed. The gentlemen\nare in great hurries, their heads and thoughts entirely taken up, and\nit is impossible they should be guarded enough against such little\nhawk's-eyed creatures as we were; and, therefore, they ought either\nnever to put their pocket-books up at all, or to put them up more\nsecure, or to put nothing of value into them. I happened to be just\nopposite to this gentleman in that they call Swithin's Alley, or that\nalley rather which is between Swithin's Alley and the Exchange, just\nby a passage that goes out of the alley into the Exchange, when,\nseeing the book pass and repass into the pocket and out of the pocket\nas above, it came immediately into my head, certainly I might get that\npocket-book out if I were nimble, and I warrant Will would have it, if\nhe saw it go and come to and again as I did. But when I saw it hang by\nthe way, as I have said, \"Now it is mine,\" said I to myself, and,\ncrossing the alley, I brushed smoothly but closely by the man, with my\nhand down flat to my own side, and, taking hold of it by the corner\nthat appeared, the book came so light into my hand, it was impossible\nthe gentleman should feel the least motion, or anybody else see me\ntake it away. I went directly forward into the broad place on the\nnorth side of the Exchange, then scoured down Bartholomew Lane, so\ninto Tokenhouse Yard, into the alleys which pass through from thence\nto London Wall, so through Moorgate, and sat down on the grass in the\nsecond of the quarters of Moorfields, towards the middle field; which\nwas the place that Will and I had appointed to meet at if either of us\ngot any booty. When I came thither Will was not come; but I saw him\ncoming in about half-an-hour.\n\nAs soon as Will came to me I asked him what booty he had gotten. He\nlooked pale, and, as I thought, frighted; but he returned, \"I have got\nnothing, not I; but, you lucky young dog,\" says he, \"what have you\ngot? Have not you got the gentleman's pocket-book in Swithin's Alley?\"\n\"Yes,\" says I, and laughed at him; \"why, how did you know it?\" \"Know\nit!\" says he. \"Why, the gentleman is raving and half distracted; he\nstamps and cries and tears his very clothes. He says he is utterly\nundone and ruined, and the folks in the alley say there is I know not\nhow many thousand pounds in it. What can be in it?\" says Will. \"Come,\nlet us see.\"\n\nWell, we lay close in the grass in the middle of the quarter, so that\nnobody minded us; and so we opened the pocket-book, and there was a\ngreat many bills and notes under men's hands; some goldsmiths', and\nsome belonging to insurance offices, as they call them, and the like.\nBut that which was, it seems, worth all the rest was that, in one of\nthe folds of the cover of the book, where there was a case with\nseveral partitions, there was a paper full of loose diamonds. The man,\nas we understood afterward, was a Jew, who dealt in such goods, and\nwho indeed ought to have taken more care of the keeping of them.\n\nNow was this booty too great, even for Will himself, to manage; for\nthough by this time I was come to understand things better than I did\nformerly, when I knew not what belonged to money, yet Will was better\nskilled by far in those things than I. But this puzzled him too, as\nwell as me. Now were we something like the cock in the fable; for all\nthese bills, and I think there was one bill of Sir Henry Furness's for\n\u00c2\u00a31200, and all these diamonds, which were worth about \u00c2\u00a3150, as they\nsaid--I say, all these things were of no value to us: one little purse\nof gold would have been better to us than all of it. \"But come,\" says\nWill, \"let us look over the bills for a little one.\"\n\nWe looked over all the bills, and among them we found a bill under a\nman's hand for \u00c2\u00a332. \"Come,\" says Will, \"let us go and inquire where\nthis man lives.\" So he went into the City again, and Will went to the\npost-house, and asked there. They told him he lived at Temple Bar.\n\"Well,\" says Will, \"I will venture. I'll go and receive the money; it\nmay be he has not remembered to send to stop the payment there.\"\n\nBut it came into his thoughts to take another course. \"Come,\" says\nWill, \"I'll go back to the alley, and see if I can hear anything of\nwhat has happened, for I believe the hurry is not over yet.\" It seems\nthe man who lost the book was carried into the King's Head tavern at\nthe end of that alley, and a great crowd was about the door.\n\nAway goes Will, and watches and waits about the place; and then,\nseeing several people together, for they were not all dispersed, he\nasks one or two what was the matter. They tell him a long story of a\ngentleman who had lost his pocket-book, with a great bag of diamonds\nin it, and bills for a great many thousand pounds, and I know not\nwhat; and that they had been just crying it, and had offered \u00c2\u00a3100\nreward to any one who would discover and restore it.\n\n\"I wish,\" said he to one of them that parleyed with him, \"I did but\nknow who has it; I don't doubt but I could help him to it again. Does\nhe remember nothing of anybody, boy or fellow, that was near him? If\nhe could but describe him, it might do.\" Somebody that overheard him\nwas so forward to assist the poor gentleman that they went up and let\nhim know what a young fellow, meaning Will, had been talking at the\ndoor; and down comes another gentleman from him, and, taking Will\naside, asked him what he had said about it. Will was a grave sort of a\nyoung man, that, though he was an old soldier at the trade, had yet\nnothing of it in his countenance; and he answered that he was\nconcerned in business where a great many of the gangs of little\npickpockets haunted, and if he had but the least description of the\nperson they suspected, he durst say he could find him out, and might\nperhaps get the things again for him. Upon this he desired him to go\nup with him to the gentleman, which he did accordingly; and there, he\nsaid, he sat leaning his head back to the chair, pale as a cloth,\ndisconsolate to a strange degree, and, as Will described him, just\nlike one under a sentence.\n\nWhen they came to ask him whether he had seen no boy or shabby fellow\nlurking near where he stood, or passing, or repassing, and the like,\nhe answered, \"No, not any.\" Neither could he remember that anybody had\ncome near him. \"Then,\" said Will, \"it will be very hard, if not\nimpossible, to find them out. However,\" said Will, \"if you think it\nworth while, I will put myself among those rogues, though,\" says he,\n\"I care not for being seen among them. But I will put in among them,\nand if it be in any of those gangs, it is ten to one but I shall hear\nsomething of it.\"\n\nThey asked him then if he had heard what terms the gentleman had\noffered to have it restored; he answered, \"No\" (though he had been\ntold at the door). They answered, he had offered \u00c2\u00a3100. \"That is too\nmuch,\" says Will; \"but if you please to leave it to me, I shall either\nget it for you for less than that, or not be able to get it for you at\nall.\" Then the losing gentleman said to one of the other, \"Tell him\nthat if he can get it lower, the overplus shall be to himself.\"\nWilliam said he would be very glad to do the gentleman such a service,\nand would leave the reward to himself. \"Well, young man,\" says one of\nthe gentlemen, \"whatever you appoint to the young artist that has done\nthis roguery (for I warrant he is an artist, let it be who it will),\nhe shall be paid, if it be within the \u00c2\u00a3100, and the gentleman is\nwilling to give you \u00c2\u00a350 besides for your pains.\"\n\n\"Truly, sir,\" says Will very gravely, \"it was by mere chance that,\ncoming by the door, and seeing the crowd, I asked what the matter was.\nBut if I should be instrumental to get the unfortunate gentleman his\npocket-book and the things in it again, I shall be very glad; nor am I\nso rich neither, sir, but \u00c2\u00a350 is very well worth my while too.\" Then\nhe took directions who to come to, and who to give his account to if\nhe learned anything, and the like.\n\nWill stayed so long that, as he and I agreed, I went home, and he did\nnot come to me till night; for we had considered before that it would\nnot be proper to come from them directly to me, lest they should\nfollow him and apprehend me. If he had made no advances towards a\ntreaty, he would have come back in half-an-hour, as we agreed; but\nstaying late, we met at our night rendezvous, which was in Rosemary\nLane.\n\nWhen he came he gave an account of all the discourse, and particularly\nwhat a consternation the gentleman was in who lost the pocket-book,\nand that he did not doubt but we should get a good round sum for the\nrecovery of it.\n\nWe consulted all the evening about it, and concluded he should let\nthem hear nothing of them the next day at all; and that the third day\nhe should go, but should make no discovery; only that he had got a\nscent of it, and that he believed he should have it, and make it\nappear as difficult as possible, and to start as many objections as he\ncould. Accordingly, the third day after he met with the gentleman,\nwho, he found, had been uneasy at his long stay, and told him they\nwere afraid that he only flattered them to get from them, and that\nthey had been too easy in letting him go without a further\nexamination.\n\nHe took upon him to be very grave with them, and told them that if\nthat was what he was like to have for being so free as to tell them he\nthought he might serve them, they might see that they had wronged him,\nand were mistaken by his coming again to them; that if they thought\nthey could do any thing by examining him, they might go about it, if\nthey pleased, now; that all he had to say to them was, that he knew\nwhere some of the young rogues haunted who were famous for such\nthings; and that by some inquiries, offering them money, and the like,\nhe believed they would be brought to betray one another, and that so\nhe might pick it out for them; and this he would say before a justice\nof peace, if they thought fit; and then all that he had to say further\nto them was to tell them he had lost a day or two in their service,\nand had got nothing but to be suspected for his pains, and that after\nthat he had done, and they might seek their goods where they could\nfind them.\n\nThey began to listen a little upon that, and asked him if he could\ngive them any hopes of recovering their loss. He told them that he was\nnot afraid to tell them that he believed he had heard some news of\nthem, and that what he had done had prevented all the bills being\nburnt, book and all; but that now he ought not to be asked any more\nquestions till they should be pleased to answer him a question or two.\nThey told him they would give him any satisfaction they could, and bid\nhim tell what he desired.\n\n\"Why, sir,\" says he, \"how can you expect any thief that had robbed you\nto such a considerable value as this would come and put himself into\nyour hands, confess he had your goods, and restore them to you, if you\ndo not give them assurance that you will not only give them the reward\nyou agreed to, but also give assurance that they shall not be stopped,\nquestioned, or called to account before a magistrate?\"\n\nThey said they would give all possible assurance of it. \"Nay,\" says\nhe, \"I do not know what assurance you are able to give; for when a\npoor fellow is in your clutches and has shown you your goods, you may\nseize upon him for a thief, and it is plain he must be so. Then you\ngo, take away your goods, send him to prison, and what amends can he\nhave of you afterward?\"\n\nThey were entirely confounded with the difficulty; they asked him to\ntry if he could get the things into his hands, and they would pay him\nthe money before he let them go out of his hand, and he should go away\nhalf-an-hour before they went out of the room.\n\n\"No, gentlemen,\" says he, \"that won't do now. If you had talked so\nbefore you had talked of apprehending me for nothing, I should have\ntaken your words; but now it is plain you have had such a thought in\nyour heads, and how can I, or any one else, be assured of safety?\"\n\nWell, they thought of a great many particulars, but nothing would do.\nAt length the other people who were present put in, that they should\ngive security to him, by a bond of \u00c2\u00a31000, that they would not give the\nperson any trouble whatsoever. He pretended they could not be bound,\nnor could their obligation be of any value, and that their own goods\nbeing once seen, they might seize them. \"And what would it signify,\"\nsaid he, \"to put a poor pick pocket to sue for his reward?\" They could\nnot tell what to say, but told him that he should take the things of\nthe boy, if it was a boy, and they would be bound to pay him the money\npromised. He laughed at them, and said, \"No, gentlemen; as I am not\nthe thief, so I shall be very loth to put myself in the thief's stead\nand lie at your mercy.\"\n\nThey told him they knew not what to do then, and that it would be very\nhard he would not trust them at all. He said he was very willing to\ntrust them and to serve them, but that it would be very hard to be\nruined and charged with the theft for endeavouring to serve them.\n\nThey then offered to give it him under their hands that they did not\nin the least suspect him; that they would never charge him with\nanything about it; that they acknowledged he went about to inquire\nafter the goods at their request; and that if he produced them, they\nwould pay him so much money, at or before the delivery of them,\nwithout obliging him to name or produce that person he had them from.\n\nUpon this writing, signed by three gentlemen who were present, and by\nthe person in particular who lost the things, the young gentleman told\nthem he would go and do his utmost to get the pocket-book and all that\nwas in it.\n\nThen he desired that they would in writing, beforehand, give him a\nparticular of all the several things that were in the book, that he\nmight not have it said, when he produced it, that there was not all;\nand he would have the said writing sealed up, and he would make the\nbook be sealed up when it was given to him. This they agreed to; and\nthe gentleman accordingly drew up a particular of all the bills that\nhe remembered, as he said, was in the book, and also of the diamonds,\nas follows:--\n\nOne bill under Sir Henry Furness's hand for \u00c2\u00a31200.\n\nOne bill under Sir Charles Duncomb's hand for \u00c2\u00a3800, \u00c2\u00a3250 endorsed off\n= \u00c2\u00a3550.\n\nOne bill under the hand of J. Tassel, goldsmith, \u00c2\u00a3165.\n\nOne bill of Sir Francis Child, \u00c2\u00a339.\n\nOne bill of one Stewart, that kept a wager-office and insurance, \u00c2\u00a3350.\n\nA paper containing thirty-seven loose diamonds, value about \u00c2\u00a3250.\n\nA little paper containing three large rough diamonds, and one large\none polished and cut, value \u00c2\u00a3185.\n\nFor all these things they promised, first, to give him whatever he\nagreed with the thief to give him, not exceeding \u00c2\u00a350, and to give him\n\u00c2\u00a350 more for himself for procuring them.\n\nNow he had his cue, and now he came to me, and told me honestly the\nwhole story as above. So I delivered him the book, and he told me that\nhe thought it was reasonable we should not take the full sum, because\nhe would seem to have done them some service, and so make them the\neasier. All this I agreed to; so he went the next day to the place,\nand the gentlemen met him very punctually.\n\nHe told them at the first word he had done their work, and, as he\nhoped, to their mind; and told them, if it had not been for the\ndiamonds, he could have got all for \u00c2\u00a310; but that the diamonds had\nshone so bright in the boy's imagination that he talked of running\naway to France or Holland, and living there all his days like a\ngentleman; at which they laughed. \"However, gentlemen,\" said he, \"here\nis the book;\" and so pulled it out, wrapt up in a dirty piece of a\ncoloured handkerchief, as black as the street could make it, and\nsealed with a piece of sorry wax, and the impression of a farthing for\na seal.\n\nUpon this, the note being also unsealed, at the same time he pulled\nopen the dirty rag, and showed the gentleman his pocket-book; at which\nhe was so over-surprised with joy, notwithstanding all the preparatory\ndiscourse, that he was fain to call for a glass of wine or brandy to\ndrink, to keep him from fainting.\n\nThe book being opened, the paper of diamonds was first taken out, and\nthere they were every one; only the little paper was by itself; and\nthe rough diamonds that were in it were loose among the rest, but he\nowned they were all there safe.\n\nThen the bills were called over one by one, and they found one bill\nfor \u00c2\u00a380 more than the account mentioned, besides several papers which\nwere not for money, though of consequence to the gentleman; and he\nacknowledged that all was very honestly returned. \"And now, young\nman,\" said they, \"you shall see we will deal as honestly by you;\" and\nso, in the first place, they gave him \u00c2\u00a350 for himself, and then they\ntold out the \u00c2\u00a350 for me.\n\nHe took the \u00c2\u00a350 for himself, and put it up in his pocket, wrapping it\nin paper, it being all in gold; then he began to tell over the other\n\u00c2\u00a350. But when he had told out \u00c2\u00a330, \"Hold, gentlemen,\" said he, \"as I\nhave acted fairly for you, so you shall have no reason to say I do not\ndo so to the end. I have taken \u00c2\u00a330, and for so much I agreed with the\nboy; and so there is \u00c2\u00a320 of your money again.\"\n\nThey stood looking one at another a good while, as surprised at the\nhonesty of it; for till that time they were not quite without a secret\nsuspicion that he was the thief; but that piece of policy cleared up\nhis reputation to them. The gentleman that had got his bills said\nsoftly to one of them, \"Give it him all.\" But the other said (softly\ntoo), \"No, no; as long as he has got it abated, and is satisfied with\nthe \u00c2\u00a350 you have given him, 'tis very well; let it go as it 'tis.\"\nThis was not spoke so softly but he heard it, and said, \"No,\" too; \"I\nam very well satisfied; I am glad I have got them for you;\" and so\nthey began to part.\n\nBut just before they were going away one of the gentlemen said to him,\n\"Young man, come, you see we are just to you, and have done fairly, as\nyou have also; and we will not desire you to tell us who this cunning\nfellow is that got such a prize from this gentleman; but as you have\ntalked with him, prithee, can you tell us nothing of how he did it,\nthat we may beware of such sparks again?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" says Will, \"when I shall tell you what they say, and how the\nparticular case stood, the gentleman would blame himself more than\nanybody else, or as much at least. The young rogue that catched this\nprize was out, it seems, with a comrade, who is a nimble, experienced\npickpocket as most in London; but at that time the artist was\nsomewhere at a distance, and this boy never had picked a pocket in his\nlife before; but he says he stood over against the passage into the\nExchange, on the east side, and the gentleman stood just by the\npassage; that he was very earnest in talking with some other\ngentleman, and often pulled out this book and opened it, and took\npapers out and put others in, and returned it into his coat-pocket;\nthat the last time it hitched at the pocket-hole, or stopt at\nsomething that was in the pocket, and hung a little out, which the\nboy, who had watched it a good while perceiving, he passes by close to\nthe gentleman, and carried it smoothly off, without the gentleman's\nperceiving it at all.\"\n\nHe went on, and said, \"'Tis very strange gentlemen should put\npocket-books which have such things in them into those loose pockets,\nand in so careless a manner.\" \"That's very true,\" says the gentleman;\nand so, with some other discourse of no great signification, he came\naway to me.\n\nWe were now so rich that we scarce knew what to do with our money; at\nleast I did not, for I had no relations, no friends, nowhere to put\nanything I had but in my pocket. As for Will, he had a poor mother,\nbut wicked as himself, and he made her rich and glad with his good\nsuccess.\n\nWe divided this booty equally; for though the gaining it was mine, yet\nthe improving of it was his, and his management brought the money; for\nneither he or I could have made anything proportionable of the thing\nany other way. As for the bills, there was no room to doubt but unless\nthey had been carried that minute to the goldsmith's for the money, he\nwould have come with notice to stop the payment, and perhaps have come\nwhile the money was receiving, and have taken hold of the person. And\nthen as to the diamonds, there had been no offering them to sale by us\npoor boys to anybody but those who were our known receivers, and they\nwould have given us nothing for them compared to what they were worth;\nfor, as I understood afterwards, those who made a trade of buying\nstolen goods took care to have false weights, and cheat the poor devil\nthat stole them at least an ounce in three.\n\nUpon the whole, we made the best of it many ways besides. I had a\nstrange kind of uninstructed conscience at that time; for though I\nmade no scruple of getting anything in this manner from anybody, yet I\ncould not bear destroying their bills and papers, which were things\nthat would do them a great deal of hurt, and do me no good; and I was\nso tormented about it that I could not rest night or day while I made\nthe people easy from whom the things were taken.\n\nI was now rich, so rich that I knew not what to do with my money or\nwith myself. I had lived so near and so close, that although, as I\nsaid, I did now and then lay out twopence or threepence for mere\nhunger, yet I had so many people who, as I said, employed me, and who\ngave me victuals and sometimes clothes, that in a whole year I had not\nquite spent the 15s. which I had saved of the custom-house gentleman's\nmoney; and I had the four guineas which was of the first booty before\nthat still in my pocket--I mean the money that I let fall into the\ntree.\n\nBut now I began to look higher; and though Will and I went abroad\nseveral times together, yet, when small things offered, as\nhandkerchiefs and such trifles, we would not meddle with them, not\ncaring to run the risk for small matters. It fell out one day that, as\nwe were strolling about in West Smithfield on a Friday, there happened\nto be an ancient country gentleman in the market, selling some very\nlarge bullocks. It seems they came out of Sussex, for we heard him say\nthere were no such bullocks in the whole county of Suffolk. His\nworship, for so they called him, had received the money for these\nbullocks at a tavern, whose sign I forget now, and having some of it\nin a bag, and the bag in his hand, he was taken with a sudden fit of\ncoughing, and stands to cough, resting his hand with the bag of money\nin it upon the bulk-head of a shop just by the Cloister Gate in\nSmithfield; that is to say, within three or four doors of it. We were\nboth just behind him. Says Will to me, \"Stand ready.\" Upon this he\nmakes an artificial stumble, and falls with his head just against the\nold gentleman in the very moment when he was coughing, ready to be\nstrangled, and quite spent for want of breath.\n\nThe violence of the blow beat the old gentleman quite down. The bag of\nmoney did not immediately fly out of his hand, but I ran to get hold\nof it, and gave it a quick snatch, pulled it clean away, and ran like\nthe wind down the Cloisters with it; turned on the left hand, as soon\nas I was through, and cut into Little Britain, so into Bartholomew\nClose, then across Aldersgate Street, through Paul's Alley into\nRedcross Street, and so across all the streets, through innumerable\nalleys, and never stopped till I got into the second quarter of\nMoorfields, our old agreed rendezvous.\n\nWill, in the meantime, fell down with the old gentleman, but soon got\nup. The old knight, for such, it seems, he was, was frighted with the\nfall, and his breath so stopped with his cough that he could not\nrecover himself to speak till some time; during which nimble Will was\ngot up again, and walked off. Nor could he call out, \"Stop thief,\" or\ntell anybody he had lost anything for a good while; but, coughing\nvehemently and looking red, till he was almost black in the face, he\ncried, \"The ro--hegh, hegh, hegh--the rogues--hegh--have got--hegh,\nhegh, hegh, hegh, hegh, hegh;\" then he would get a little breath, and\nat it again: \"The rogues--hegh, hegh;\" and, after a great many heghs\nand rogues, he brought it out--\"have got away my bag of money!\"\n\nAll this while the people understood nothing of the matter; and as for\nthe rogues indeed, they had time enough to get clear away, and in\nabout an hour Will came to the rendezvous. There we sat down in the\ngrass again, and turned out the money, which proved to be eight\nguineas, and \u00c2\u00a35, 12s. in silver, so that it made just \u00c2\u00a314 together.\nThis we shared upon the spot, and went to work the same day for more;\nbut whether it was that, being flushed with our success, we were not\nso vigilant, or that no other opportunity offered, I know not, but we\ngot nothing more that night, nor so much as anything offered itself\nfor an attempt.\n\nWe took many walks of this kind, sometimes together, at a little\ndistance from one another, and several small hits we made; but we were\nso flushed with our success that truly we were above meddling with\ntrifles, as I said before--no, not such things that others would have\nbeen glad of; nothing but pocket-books, letter-cases, or sums of money\nwould move us.\n\nThe next adventure was in the dusk of the evening, in a court which\ngoes out of Gracechurch Street into Lombard Street, where the Quakers'\nmeeting house is. There was a young fellow who, as we learned\nafterward, was a woollen-draper's apprentice in Gracechurch Street. It\nseems he had been receiving a sum of money which was very\nconsiderable, and he comes to a goldsmith's shop in Lombard Street\nwith it; paid in the most of it there; insomuch that it grew dark, and\nthe goldsmith began to be shutting in shop, and candles to be lighted.\nWe watched him in there, and stood on the other side of the way to see\nwhat he did. When he had paid in all the money he intended, he stayed\nstill some time longer, to take notes, as I supposed, for what he had\npaid; and by this time it was still darker than before. At last he\ncomes out of the shop, with still a pretty large bag under his arm,\nand walks over into the court, which was then very dark. In the middle\nof the court is a boarded entry, and farther, at the end of it, a\nthreshold; and as soon as he had set his foot over the threshold, he\nwas to turn on his left hand into Gracechurch Street.\n\n\"Keep up,\" says Will to me; \"be nimble;\" and as soon as he had said so\nhe flies at the young man, and gives him such a violent thrust that\npushed him forward with too great a force for him to stand; and as he\nstrove to recover, the threshold took his feet, and he fell forward\ninto the other part of the court, as if he had flown in the air, with\nhis head lying towards the Quakers' meeting-house. I stood ready, and\npresently felt out the bag of money, which I heard fall; for it flew\nout of his hand, he having his life to save, not his money. I went\nforward with the money, and Will, that threw him down, finding I had\nit, run backward, and as I made along Fenchurch Street, Will overtook\nme, and we scoured home together. The poor young man was hurt a little\nwith the fall, and reported to his master, as we heard afterward, that\nhe was knocked down, which was not true, for neither Will or I had any\nstick in our hands; but the master of the youth was, it seems, so very\nthankful that his young man was not knocked down before he paid the\nrest of the money (which was above \u00c2\u00a3100 more) to the goldsmith, who\nwas Sir John Sweetapple, that he made no great noise at the loss he\nhad, and, as we heard afterward, only warned his apprentice to be more\ncareful and come no more through such places in the dark; whereas the\nman had really no such deliverance as he imagined, for we saw him\nbefore, when he had all the money about him; but it was no time of day\nfor such work as we had to do, so that he was in no danger before.\n\nThis booty amounted to \u00c2\u00a329, 16s., which was \u00c2\u00a314 18s. apiece, and added\nexceedingly to my store, which began now to be very much too big for\nmy management; and indeed I began to be now full of care for the\npreservation of what I had got. I wanted a trusty friend to commit it\nto; but where was such a one to be found by a poor boy bred up among\nthieves? If I should have let any honest body know that I had so much\nmoney, they would have asked me how I came by it, and would have been\nafraid to take it into their hands, lest I being some time or other\ncatched in my rogueries, they should be counted the receivers of\nstolen goods and the encouragers of a thief.\n\nWe had, however, in the meantime a great many other successful\nenterprises, some of one kind, some of another, and were never so much\nas in danger of being apprehended; but my companion Will, who was now\ngrown a man, and encouraged by these advantages, fell into quite\nanother vein of wickedness, getting acquainted with a wretched gang of\nfellows that turned their hands to everything that was vile.\n\nWill was a lusty, strong fellow, and withal very bold and daring,\nwould fight anybody and venture upon anything; and I found he began to\nbe above the mean rank of a poor pickpocket, so I saw him but seldom.\nHowever, once coming to me in a very friendly manner, and asking me\nhow I went on, I told him that I used the old trade still, that I had\nhad two or three good jobs: one with a young woman, whose pocket I had\npicked of eleven guineas; and another, a countrywoman, just come out\nof a stage-coach, seeing her pull out her bag to pay the coachman; and\nthat I followed her till I got an opportunity, and slipped it out so\nneatly that though there was \u00c2\u00a38, 17s. in it, yet she never felt it go.\nAnd several other jobs I told him of, by which I made pretty good\npurchase. \"I always said you were a lucky boy, Colonel Jacque,\" says\nhe; \"but, come, you are grown almost a man now, and you shall not be\nalways at play at push-pin. I am got into better business, I assure\nyou, and you shall come into it too. I'll bring you into a brave gang,\nJacque,\" says he, \"where you shall see we shall be all gentlemen.\"\n\nThen he told me the trade itself, in short, which was with a set of\nfellows that had two of the most desperate works upon their hands that\nbelonged to the whole art of thieving; that is to say, in the evening\nthey were footpads, and in the night they were housebreakers. Will\ntold me so many plausible stories, and talked of such great things,\nthat, in short, I, who had been always used to do anything he bid me\ndo, went with him without any hesitation.\n\nNothing is more certain than that hitherto, being partly from the\ngross ignorance of my untaught childhood, as I observed before, partly\nfrom the hardness and wickedness of the company I kept; and add to\nthese that it was the business I might be said to be brought up to--I\nhad, I say, all the way hitherto, no manner of thoughts about the good\nor evil of what I was embarked in; consequently I had no sense of\nconscience, no reproaches upon my mind for having done amiss.\n\nYet I had something in me, by what secret influence I knew not, kept\nme from the other degrees of raking and vice, and, in short, from the\ngeneral wickedness of the rest of my companions. For example, I never\nused any ill words, nobody ever heard me swear, nor was I given to\ndrink, or to love strong drink; and I cannot omit a circumstance that\nvery much served to prevent it. I had a strange original notion, as I\nhave mentioned in its place, of my being a gentleman; and several\nthings had casually happened in my way to increase this fancy of mine.\nIt happened one day, that being in the Glass-house Yard, between\nRosemary Lane and Ratcliff Highway, there came a man dressed very\nwell, and with a coach attending him, and he came (as I suppose) to\nbuy glass-bottles, or some other goods, as they sold; and in\nbargaining for his goods, he swore most horrid oaths at every two or\nthree words. At length the master of the glass-house, an ancient,\ngrave gentleman, took the liberty to reprove him, which at first made\nhim swear the worse. After a while the gentleman was a little calmer,\nbut still he swore very much, though not so bad as at first. After\nsome time the master of the glass-house turned from him--\"Really,\nsir,\" says the good old gentleman, \"you swear so, and take God's name\nin vain so, that I cannot bear to stay with you. I would rather you\nwould let my goods alone and go somewhere else. I hope you won't take\nit ill, but I don't desire to deal with anybody that does so. I am\nafraid my glass-house should fall on your head while you stay in it.\"\n\nThe gentleman grew good-humoured at the reproof, and said, \"Well,\ncome, don't go away; I won't swear any more,\" says he, \"if I can help\nit; for I own,\" says he, \"I should not do it.\"\n\nWith that the old gentleman looked up at him, and, returning, \"Really,\nsir,\" says he, \"'tis pity you, that seem to be a fine gentleman,\nwell-bred and good-humoured, should accustom yourself to such a\nhateful practice. Why, 'tis not like a gentleman to swear; 'tis enough\nfor my black wretches that work there at the furnace, or for these\nragged, naked, blackguard boys,\" pointing at me, and some others of\nthe dirty crew that lay in the ashes. \"'Tis bad enough for them,\" says\nhe, \"and they ought to be corrected for it, too; but for a man of\nbreeding, sir,\" says he, \"a gentleman, it ought to be looked upon as\nbelow them. Gentlemen know better, and are taught better, and it is\nplain you know better. I beseech you, sir, when you are tempted to\nswear, always ask yourself, 'Is this like a gentleman? Does this\nbecome me as a gentleman?' Do but ask yourself that question, and your\nreason will prevail--you will soon leave it off.\"\n\nI heard all this, and it made the blood run chill in my veins when he\nsaid swearing was only fit for such as we were. In short, it made as\ngreat an impression upon me as it did upon the gentleman; and yet he\ntook it very kindly too, and thanked the old gentleman for his advice.\nBut from that time forward I never had the least inclination to\nswearing or ill words, and abhorred it when I heard other boys do it.\nAs to drinking, I had no opportunity; for I had nothing to drink but\nwater, or small-beer that anybody gave me in charity, for they seldom\ngave away strong beer; and after I had money, I neither desired strong\nbeer or cared to part with my money to buy it.\n\nThen as to principle, 'tis true I had no foundation laid in me by\neducation; and being early led by my fate into evil, I had the less\nsense of its being evil left upon my mind. But when I began to grow to\nan age of understanding, and to know that I was a thief, growing up in\nall manner of villainy, and ripening apace for the gallows, it came\noften into my thoughts that I was going wrong, that I was in the\nhigh-road to the devil; and several times I would stop short, and ask\nmyself if this was the life of a gentleman.\n\nBut these little things wore off again as often as they came on, and I\nfollowed the old trade again, especially when Will came to prompt me,\nas I have observed, for he was a kind of a guide to me in all these\nthings; and I had, by custom and application, together with seeing his\nway, learned to be as acute a workman as my master.\n\nBut to go back where I left off. Will came to me, as I have said, and\ntelling me how much better business he was fallen into, would have me\ngo along with him, and I should be a gentleman. Will, it seems,\nunderstood that word in a quite different manner from me; for his\ngentleman was nothing more or less than a gentleman thief, a villain\nof a higher degree than a pickpocket, and one that might do something\nmore wicked, and better entitling him to the gallows, than could be\ndone in our way. But my gentleman that I had my eye upon was another\nthing quite, though I could not really tell how to describe it either.\n\nHowever, the word took with me, and I went with him. We were neither\nof us old. Will was about twenty-four; and as for me, I was now about\neighteen, and pretty tall of my age.\n\nThe first time I went with him, he brought me into the company only of\ntwo more young fellows. We met at the lower part of Gray's Inn Lane,\nabout an hour before sunset, and went out into the fields toward a\nplace called Pindar of Wakefield, where are abundance of brick-kilns.\nHere it was agreed to spread from the field-path to the roadway, all\nthe way towards Pancras Church, to observe any chance game, as they\ncalled it, which they might shoot flying. Upon the path within the\nbank on the side of the road going towards Kentish Town, two of our\ngang, Will and one of the others, met a single gentleman walking apace\ntowards the town. Being almost dark, Will cried, \"Mark, ho!\" which, it\nseems, was the word at which we were all to stand still at a distance,\ncome in if he wanted help, and give a signal if anything appeared that\nwas dangerous.\n\nWill steps up to the gentleman, stops him, and put the question; that\nis, \"Sir, your money?\" The gentleman, seeing he was alone, struck at\nhim with his cane; but Will, a nimble, strong fellow, flew in upon\nhim, and with struggling got him down. Then he begged for his life,\nWill having told him with an oath that he would cut his throat. In\nthat moment, while this was doing, comes a hackney-coach along the\nroad, and the fourth man, who was that way, cries, \"Mark, ho!\" which\nwas to intimate that it was a prize, not a surprise. And accordingly\nthe next man went up to assist him, where they stopped the coach,\nwhich had a doctor of physic and a surgeon in it, who had been to\nvisit some considerable patient, and, I suppose, had had considerable\nfees. For here they got two good purses, one with eleven or twelve\nguineas, the other six with some pocket-money, two watches, one\ndiamond ring, and the surgeon's plaster-box, which was most of it full\nof silver instruments.\n\nWhile they were at this work, Will kept the man down who was under\nhim; and though he promised not to kill him, unless he offered to make\na noise, yet he would not let him stir till he heard the noise of the\ncoach going on again, by which he knew the job was over on that side.\nThen he carried him a little out of the way, tied his hands behind\nhim, and bade him lie still and make no noise, and he would come back\nin half-an-hour and untie him, upon his word; but if he cried out, he\nwould come back and kill him.\n\nThe poor man promised to lie still and make no noise, and did so; and\nhad not above 11s. 6d. in his pocket, which Will took, and came back\nto the rest; but while they were together, I, who was on the side of\nthe Pindar of Wakefield, cried, \"Mark, ho!\" too.\n\nWhat I saw was a couple of poor women, one a kind of a nurse, and the\nother a maid-servant, going for Kentish Town. As Will knew that I was\nbut young at the work, he came flying to me, and seeing how easy a\nbargain it was, he said, \"Go, colonel, fall to work.\" I went up to\nthem, and speaking to the elderly woman, \"Nurse,\" said I, \"don't be\nin such haste. I want to speak with you;\" at which they both stopped,\nand looked a little frighted. \"Don't be frighted, sweetheart,\" said I\nto the maid; \"a little of that money in the bottom of your pocket will\nmake all easy, and I will do you no harm.\" By this time Will came up\nto us, for they did not see him before; then they began to scream out.\n\"Hold!\" says I; \"make no noise, unless you have a mind to force us to\nmurder you whether we will or no. Give me your money presently, and\nmake no words, and we shan't hurt you.\" Upon this the poor maid pulled\nout 5s. 6d., and the old woman a guinea and a shilling, crying\nheartily for her money, and said it was all she had left in the world.\nWell, we took it for all that, though it made my very heart bleed to\nsee what agony the poor woman was in at parting with it, and I asked\nher where she lived. She said her name was Smith, and she lived at\nKentish Town. I said nothing to her, but bid them go on about their\nbusiness, and I gave Will the money. So in a few minutes we were all\ntogether again. Says one of the other rogues, \"Come, this is well\nenough for one road; it's time to be gone.\" So we jogged away,\ncrossing the fields, out of the path towards Tottenham Court. \"But\nhold!\" says Will; \"I must go and untie the man.\" \"D--n him,\" says one\nof them, \"let him lie.\" \"No,\" says Will, \"I won't be worse than my\nword; I will untie him.\" So he went to the place, but the man was\ngone. Either he had untied himself, or somebody had passed by, and he\nhad called for help, and so was untied; for he could not find him, nor\nmake him hear, though he ventured to call twice for him aloud.\n\nThis made us hasten away the faster, and getting into Tottenham Court\nRoad, they thought it was a little too near, so they made into the\ntown at St. Giles's, and crossing to Piccadilly, went to Hyde Park\ngate. Here they ventured to rob another coach; that is to say, one of\nthe two other rogues and Will did it, between the Park gate and\nKnightsbridge. There was in it only a gentleman and a whore that he\nhad picked up, it seems, at the Spring Garden, a little farther. They\ntook the gentleman's money, his watch, and his silver-hilted sword;\nbut when they come to the slut, she damned and cursed them for robbing\nthe gentleman of his money and leaving him none for her. As for\nherself, she had not one sixpenny piece about her, though she was\nindeed well enough dressed too.\n\nHaving made this adventure, we left that road too, and went over the\nfields to Chelsea. In the way from Westminster to Chelsea we met three\ngentlemen, but they were too strong for us to meddle with. They had\nbeen afraid to come over the fields so late (for by this time it was\neight o'clock, and though the moon gave some light, yet it was too\nlate and too dark to be safe); so they hired three men at Chelsea, two\nwith pitchforks, and the third, a waterman, with a boathook staff to\nguard them. We would have steered clear of them, and cared not to have\nthem see us, if we could help it. But they did see us, and cried, \"Who\ncomes there?\" We answered, \"Friends;\" and so they went on, to our\ngreat satisfaction.\n\nWhen we came to Chelsea, it seems we had other work to do, which I had\nnot been made privy to; and this was a house to be robbed. They had\nsome intelligence, it seems, with a servant in the house, who was of\ntheir gang. This rogue was a waiting-man, or footman, and he had a\nwatchword to let them in by; but this fellow, not for want of being a\nvillain, but by getting drunk and not minding his part of the work,\ndisappointed us. For he had promised to rise at two o'clock in the\nmorning and let us all in; but, being very drunk, and not come in at\neleven o'clock, his master ordered him to be shut out and the doors\nlocked up, and charged the other servants not to let him in upon any\nterms whatsoever.\n\nWe came about the house at one o'clock to make our observations,\nintending to go and lie under Beaufort House wall till the clock\nstruck two, and then to come again; but, behold! when we came to the\nhouse, there lay the fellow at the door fast asleep, and very drunk.\nWill, who, I found, was the leader in all these things, waked the\nfellow, who, as he had had about two hours' sleep, was a little come\nto himself, and told them the misfortune, as he called it, and that he\ncould not get in. They had some instruments about them, by which they\ncould have broken in by force; but Will considered that as it was but\nwaiting till another time, and they should be let in quietly, they\nresolved to give it over for that time.\n\nBut this was a happy drunken bout for the family; for the fellow\nhaving let fall some words in his drink (for he was a saucy one as\nwell as a drunken one, and talked oddly), as that it had been better\nthey had let him in, and he would make them pay dear for it, or some\nsuch thing, the master hearing of it, turned him away in the morning,\nand never let him come into his house again. So, I say, it was a happy\ndrunkenness to the family, for it saved them from being robbed, and\nperhaps murdered; for they were a cursed, bloody crew, and, as I\nfound, were about thirteen of them in all, whereof three of them made\nit their business to get into gentlemen's services, and so to open\ndoors in the night, and let the other rogues in upon them to rob and\ndestroy them.\n\nI rambled this whole night with them. They went from Chelsea, being\ndisappointed there as above, to Kensington. There they broke into a\nbrewhouse and washhouse, and by that means into an out-kitchen of a\ngentleman's house, where they unhanged a small copper, and brought it\noff, and stole about a hundredweight of pewter, and went clear off\nwith that too. And every one going their own by-ways, they found means\nto get safe to their several receptacles where they used to dispose of\nsuch things.\n\nWe lay still the next day, and shared the effects stolen that night,\nof which my share came to \u00c2\u00a38, 19s. The copper and pewter being\nweighed, and cast up, a person was at hand to take it as money, at\nabout half value, and in the afternoon Will and I came away together.\nWill was mighty full of the success we had had, and how we might be\nsure of the like this way every day. But he observed that I did not\nseem so elevated at the success of that night's ramble as I used to\nbe, and also that I did not take any great notice of the expectations\nhe was in of what was to come. Yet I had said little to him at that\ntime.\n\nBut my heart was full of the poor woman's case at Kentish Town, and I\nresolved, if possible, to find her out and give her her money. With\nthe abhorrence that filled my mind at the cruelty of that act, there\nnecessarily followed a little distaste for the thing itself; and now\nit came into my head with a double force that this was the high road\nto the devil, and that certainly this was not the life of a gentleman.\n\nWill and I parted for that time; but next morning we met again, and\nWill was mighty brisk and merry. \"And now, Colonel Jacque,\" says he,\n\"we shall be rich very quickly.\" \"Well,\" says I, \"and what shall we do\nwhen we are rich?\" \"Do!\" says he; \"we will buy a couple of good\nhorses, and go farther afield.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by farther afield?\" says I. \"Why,\" says he, \"we will\ntake the highway like gentlemen, and then we shall get a great deal of\nmoney indeed.\" \"Well,\" says I, \"what then?\" \"Why, then,\" says he, \"we\nshall live like gentlemen.\"\n\n\"But, Will,\" says I, \"if we get a great deal of money, shan't we leave\nthis trade off, and sit down, and be safe and quiet?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" says Will; \"when we have got a great estate, we shall be willing\nto lay it down.\" \"But where,\" says I, \"shall we be before that time\ncomes, if we should drive on this cursed kind of trade?\"\n\n\"Prithee never think of that,\" says Will; \"if you think of those\nthings, you will never be fit to be a gentleman.\" He touched me there\nindeed, for it ran much in my mind still that I was to be a gentleman,\nand it made me dumb for a while; but I came to myself after a little\nwhile, and I said to him, pretty tartly, \"Why, Will, do you call this\nway of living the life of a gentleman?\"\n\n\"Why,\" says Will, \"why not?\"\n\n\"Why,\" says I, \"was it like a gentleman for me to take that 22s. from\na poor ancient woman, when she begged of me upon her knees not to take\nit, and told me it was all she had in the world to buy her bread for\nherself and a sick child which she had at home? Do you think I could\nbe so cruel, if you had not stood by and made me do it? Why, I cried\nat doing it as much as the poor woman did, though I did not let you\nsee me.\"\n\n\"You fool you,\" says Will; \"you will never be fit for our business,\nindeed, if you mind such things as those. I shall bring you off those\nthings quickly. Why, if you will be fit for business, you must learn\nto fight when they resist, and cut their throats when they submit; you\nmust learn to stop their breath that they may beg and pray no more.\nWhat signifies pity? Prithee, who will pity us when we come to the Old\nBailey? I warrant you that whining old woman, that begged so heartily\nfor her 22s., would let you and I beg upon our knees, and would not\nsave our lives by not coming in for an evidence against us. Did you\never see any of them cry when they see gentlemen go to the gallows?\"\n\n\"Well, Will,\" says I, \"you had better let us keep to the business we\nwere in before. There were no such cruel doings in that, and yet we\ngot more money by it than I believe we shall get at this.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" says Will, \"you are a fool; you don't know what fine things\nwe shall do in a little while.\"\n\nUpon this discourse we parted for that time; but I resolved with\nmyself that I would never be concerned with him that way any more. The\ntruth is, they were such a dreadful gang, such horrid barbarous\nvillains, that even that little while that I was among them my very\nblood run cold in my veins at what I heard, particularly the continued\nraving and damning one another and themselves at every word they\nspoke; and then the horrid resolutions of murder, and cutting throats,\nwhich I perceived was in their minds upon any occasion that should\npresent. This appeared first in their discourse upon the\ndisappointment they met with at Chelsea, where the two rogues that\nwere with us, ay, and Will too, damned and raged that they could not\nget into the house, and swore they would have cut the gentleman's\nthroat if they had got in, and shook hands, damning and cursing\nthemselves if they did not murder the whole family as soon as Tom\n(that was the manservant) could get an opportunity to let them in.\n\nTwo days after this Will came to my lodging; for I had now got a room\nby myself, had bought me tolerable good clothes and some shirts, and\nbegan to look like other folks. But, as it happened, I was abroad upon\nthe scout in another way; for though I was not hardened enough for so\nblack a villain as Will would have had me be, yet I had not arrived to\nany principle sufficient to keep me from a life, in its degree wicked\nenough, which tended to the same destruction, though not in so violent\nand precipitant degrees. I had his message delivered to me, which was\nto meet him the next evening at such a place, and as I came in time\nenough to meet, so I went to the place, but resolved beforehand that I\nwould not go any more with him among the gang.\n\nHowever, to my great satisfaction, I missed him; for he did not come\nat all to the place, but met with the gang at another place, they\nhaving sent for him in haste upon the notice of some booty; and so\nthey went all away together. This was a summons, it seems, from one of\nthe creatures which they had abroad in a family, where an opportunity\noffered them to commit a notorious robbery, down almost as far as\nHounslow, and where they wounded a gentleman's gardener so that I\nthink he died, and robbed the house of a very considerable sum of\nmoney and plate.\n\nThis, however, was not so clean carried, nor did they get in so easy,\nbut by the resistance they met with the neighbours were all alarmed,\nand the gentlemen rogues were pursued, and being at London with the\nbooty, one of them was taken. Will, a dexterous fellow and head of the\ngang, made his escape, and though in his clothes, with a great weight\nabout him of both money and plate, plunged into the Thames and swam\nover where there was no path or road leading to the river; so that\nnobody suspected any one's going that way. Being got over, he made his\nway, wet as he was, into some woods adjacent, and, as he told me\nafterwards, not far from Chertsey, and stayed lurking about in the\nwoods or fields thereabouts till his clothes were dry; then, in the\nnight, got down to Kingston, and so to Mortlake, where he got a boat\nto London.\n\nHe knew nothing that one of his comrades was taken; only he knew that\nthey were all so closely pursued that they were obliged to disperse,\nand every one to shift for himself. He happened to come home in the\nevening, as good luck then directed him, just after search had been\nmade for him by the constables; his companion, who was taken, having,\nupon promise of favour, and of saving him from the gallows, discovered\nhis companions, and Will among the rest, as the principal party in the\nwhole undertaking.\n\nWill got notice of this just time enough to run for it and not to be\ntaken; and away he came to look for me; but, as my good fate still\ndirected, I was not at home neither. However, he left all his booty at\nmy lodging, and hid it in an old coat that lay under my bedding, and\nleft word that my brother Will had been there, and had left his coat\nthat he borrowed of me, and that it was under my bed.\n\nI knew not what to make of it, but went up to go to bed; and, finding\nthe parcel, was perfectly frighted to see, wrapped up in it, above one\nhundred pound in plate and money, and yet knew nothing of brother\nWill, as he called himself, nor did I hear of him for three or four\ndays.\n\nAt the end of four days I heard, by great accident, that Will, who\nused to be seen with me, and who called me brother, was taken, and\nwould be hanged. Next day a poor man, a shoemaker, that used formerly\nto have a kindness for me, and to send me of errands, and gave me\nsometimes some victuals, seeing me accidentally in Rosemary Lane,\ngoing by him, clasped me fast hold by the arm. \"Hark ye, young man,\"\nsays he, \"have I catched you?\" and hauled me along as if I had been a\nthief apprehended, and he the constable. \"Hark ye, Colonel Jacque,\"\nsays he again, \"come along with me. I must speak with you. What, are\nyou got into this gang too? What, are you turned housebreaker? Come,\nI'll have you hanged, to be sure.\"\n\nThese were dreadful words to me, who, though not guilty of the\nparticular thing in question, yet was frighted heartily before, and\ndid not know what I might be charged with by Will, if he was taken, as\nI heard that very morning he was. With these words, the shoemaker\nbegan to hale and drag me along as he used to do when I was a boy.\n\nHowever, recovering my spirits, and provoked to the highest degree, I\nsaid to him again, \"What do you mean, Mr. ----? Let me alone, or you\nwill oblige me to make you do it;\" and with that I stopped short, and\nsoon let him see I was grown a little too big to be haled about as I\nused to be when I run of his errands, and made a motion with my other\nhand as if I would strike him in the face.\n\n\"How, Jacque!\" says he; \"will you strike me? Will you strike your old\nfriend?\" and then he let go my arm, and laughed. \"Well, but hark ye,\ncolonel,\" says he, \"I am in earnest. I hear bad news of you. They say\nyou are gotten into bad company, and that this Will calls you brother.\nHe is a great villain, and I hear he is charged with a bloody robbery,\nand will be hanged if he is taken. I hope you are not concerned with\nhim. If you are, I would advise you to shift for yourself, for the\nconstable and the headborough are after him to-day, and if he can lay\nany thing to you he will do it, you may be sure. He will certainly\nhang you to save himself.\"\n\nThis was kind, and I thanked him, but told him this was a thing too\nserious, and that had too much weight in it, to be jested with, as he\nhad done before; and that some ignorant stranger might have seized\nupon me as a person guilty, who had no further concern in it than just\nknowing the man, and so I might have been brought into trouble for\nnothing. At least people might have thought I was among them, whether\nI was or no, and it would have rendered me suspected, though I was\ninnocent.\n\nHe acknowledged that; told me he was but in jest, and that he talked\nto me just as he used to do.\n\n\"However, colonel,\" says he, \"I won't jest any more with you in a\nthing of such a dangerous consequence; I only advise you to keep the\nfellow company no more.\"\n\nI thanked him, and went away, but in the greatest perplexity\nimaginable. And now, not knowing what to do with myself, or with the\nlittle ill-gotten wealth which I had, I went musing and alone into the\nfields towards Stepney, my usual walk, and there began to consider\nwhat to do. And as this creature had left his prize in my garret, I\nbegan to think that if he should be taken, and should confess and send\nthe officers to search there for the goods, and they should find them,\nI should be undone, and should be taken up for a confederate; whereas\nI knew nothing of the matter, and had no hand in it.\n\nWhile I was thus musing, and in great perplexity, I heard somebody\nhalloo to me; and, looking about, I saw Will running after me. I knew\nnot what to think at first, but seeing him alone, was the more\nencouraged, and I stood still for him. When he came up to me I said to\nhim, \"What is the matter, Will?\" \"Matter!\" says Will. \"Matter enough;\nI am undone. When was you at home?\"\n\n\"I saw what you left there,\" says I. \"What is the meaning of it, and\nwhere got you all that? Is that your being undone?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" says Will, \"I am undone for all that; for the officers are after\nme; and I am a dead dog if I am taken, for George is in custody, and\nhe has peached on me and all the others to save his life.\"\n\n\"Life!\" says I; \"why should you lose your life if they should take\nyou? Pray what would they do to you?\"\n\n\"Do to me!\" says he; \"they would hang me, if the king had ne'er\nanother soldier in his guards. I shall certainly be hanged as I am now\nalive.\"\n\nThis frighted me terribly, and I said, \"And what will you do then?\"\n\"Nay,\" says he, \"I know not. I would get out of the nation, if I knew\nhow; but I am a stranger to all those things, and I know not what to\ndo, not I. Advise me, Jacque,\" says he; \"prithee tell me whither shall\nI go. I have a good mind to go to sea.\"\n\n\"You talk of going away,\" says I; \"what will you do with all you have\nhid in my garret? It must not lie there,\" said I; \"for if I should be\ntaken up for it, and it be found to be the money you stole, I shall be\nruined.\"\n\n\"I care not what becomes of it, not I,\" says Will. \"I'll be gone. Do\nyou take it, if you will, and do what you will with it. I must fly,\nand I cannot take it with me.\" \"I won't have it, not I,\" says I to\nhim. \"I'll go and fetch it to you if you will take it,\" says I; \"but I\nwon't meddle with it. Besides, there is plate. What shall I do with\nplate?\" said I. \"If I should offer to sell it anywhere,\" said I, \"they\nwill stop me.\"\n\n\"As for that,\" says Will, \"I could sell it well enough, if I had it;\nbut I must not be seen anywhere among my old acquaintance; for I am\nblown, and they will all betray me. But I will tell you where you\nshall go and sell it, if you will, and they will ask you no questions,\nif you give them the word that I will give you.\" So he gave me the\nword, and directions to a pawnbroker near Cloth Fair. The word was\n_Good tower standard_. Having these instructions, he said to me,\n\"Colonel Jacque, I am sure you won't betray me; and I promise you, if\nI am taken, and should be hanged, I won't name you. I will go to such\na house\" (naming a house at Bromley, by Bow, where he and I had often\nbeen), \"and there,\" says he, \"I'll stay till it is dark. At night I\nwill come near the streets, and I will lay under such a haystack all\nnight\" (a place we both knew also very well); \"and if you cannot\nfinish to come to me there, I will go back to Bow.\"\n\nI went back and took the cargo, went to the place by Cloth Fair, and\ngave the word _Good tower standard_; and without any words, they took\nthe plate, weighed it, and paid me after the rate of 2s. per ounce for\nit. So I came away and went to meet him, but it was too late to meet\nhim at the first place; but I went to the haystack, and there I found\nhim fast asleep.\n\nI delivered him his cargo. What it really amounted to I knew not, for\nI never told it; but I went home to my quarters very late and tired. I\nwent to sleep at first, but, notwithstanding I was so weary, I slept\nlittle or none for several hours. At last, being overcome with sleep,\nI dropped, but was immediately roused with noise of people knocking at\nthe door, as if they would beat it down, and crying and calling out to\nthe people of the house, \"Rise, and let in the constable here. We come\nfor your lodger in the garret.\"\n\nI was frighted to the last degree, and started up in my bed; but when\nI was awaked I heard no noise at all, but of two watchmen thumping at\nthe doors with their staves, and giving the hour, \"Past three o'clock,\nand a rainy, wet morning\"--for such it was. I was very glad when I\nfound it was but a dream, and went to bed again, but was soon roused a\nsecond time with the same, very same noise and words. Then, being\nsooner awaked than I was before, I jumped out of bed and ran to the\nwindow, and found it was just an hour more, and the watchmen were come\nabout: \"Past four o'clock,\" and they went away again very quietly; so\nI lay me down again, and slept the rest of the night quietly enough.\n\nI laid no stress upon the thing called a dream, neither till now did I\nunderstand that dreams were of any importance; but getting up the next\nday, and going out with a resolution to meet brother Will, who should\nI meet but my former brother, Captain Jacque. When he saw me, he came\nclose to me in his blunt way, and says, \"Do you hear the news?\" \"No,\nnot I,\" said I; \"what news?\" \"Your old comrade and teacher is taken\nthis morning and carried to Newgate.\" \"How,\" says I, \"this morning?\"\n\"Yes,\" says he, \"this morning at four o'clock. He is charged with a\nrobbery and murder somewhere beyond Brentford; and that which is worse\nis, that he is impeached by one of the gang, who, to save his own\nlife, has turned evidence; and therefore you had best consider,\" says\nthe captain, \"what you have to do.\" \"What I have to do!\" says I; \"and\nwhat do you mean by that?\" \"Nay, colonel,\" says he, \"don't be angry;\nyou know best. If you are not in danger, I am glad of it, but I doubt\nnot but you were with them.\" \"No, not I,\" said I again; \"I assure you\nI was not.\" \"Well,\" says he, \"but if you were not with them this bout,\nyou have been with them at other times; and 'twill be all one.\" \"Not\nI,\" says I; \"you are quite mistaken. I am none of their gang; they are\nabove my quality.\" With such, and a little more talk of that kind, we\nparted, and Captain Jacque went away; but as he went I observed he\nshook his head, seemed to have more concern upon him than he could be\nsupposed to have merely on my account, of which we shall hear more\nvery quickly.\n\nI was extremely alarmed when I heard Will was in Newgate, and, had I\nknown where to have gone, would certainly have fled as far as legs\nwould have carried me. My very joints trembled, and I was ready to\nsink into the ground; and all that evening, and that night following,\nI was in the uttermost consternation. My head ran upon nothing but\nNewgate and the gallows, and being hanged; which, I said, I deserved,\nif it were for nothing but taking that two-and-twenty shillings from\nthe poor old nurse.\n\nThe first thing my perplexed thoughts allowed me to take care of was\nmy money. This indeed lay in a little compass, and I carried it\ngenerally all about me. I had got together, as you will perceive by\nthe past account, above \u00c2\u00a360 (for I spent nothing), and what to do with\nit I knew not. At last it came into my head that I would go to my\nbenefactor, the clerk at the custom-house, if he was to be found, and\nsee if I could get him to take the rest of my money. The only business\nwas to make a plausible story to him, that he might not wonder how I\ncame by so much money.\n\nBut my invention quickly supplied that want. There was a suit of\nclothes at one of our houses of rendezvous, which was left there for\nany of the gang to put on, upon particular occasions, as a disguise.\nThis was a green livery, laced with pink-coloured galloon, and lined\nwith the same; an edged hat, a pair of boots, and a whip. I went and\ndressed myself up in this livery, and went to my gentleman, to his\nhouse in Tower Street, and there I found him in health and well, just\nthe same honest gentleman as ever.\n\nHe stared at me when first I came to him, for I met him just at his\ndoor; I say, he stared at me, and seeing me bow and bow to him several\ntimes, with my laced hat under my arm, at last, not knowing me in the\nleast, says he to me, \"Dost thou want to speak with me, young man?\"\nAnd I said, \"Yes, sir; I believe your worship\" (I had learnt some\nmanners now) \"does not know me. I am the poor boy Jacque.\" He looked\nhard at me, and then recollecting me presently, says he, \"Who--Colonel\nJacque! Why, where hast thou been all this while? Why, 'tis five or\nsix years since I saw you.\" \"'Tis above six years, and please your\nworship,\" says I.\n\n\"Well, and where hast thou been all this while?\" says he.\n\n\"I have been in the country, sir,\" says I, \"at service.\"\n\n\"Well, Colonel Jacque,\" says he, \"you give long credit; what's the\nreason you han't fetched your money all this while, nor the interest?\nWhy, you will grow so rich in time by the interest of your money, you\nwon't know what to do with it.\"\n\nTo that I said nothing, but bowed and scraped a great many times.\n\"Well, come, Colonel Jacque,\" said he, \"come in and I will give you\nyour money, and the interest of it too.\"\n\nI cringed and bowed, and told him I did not come to him for my money;\nfor I had had a good place or two, and I did not want my money.\n\n\"Well, Colonel Jacque,\" said he, \"and who do you live with?\"\n\n\"Sir Jonathan Loxham,\" said I, \"sir, in Somersetshire, and please your\nworship.\" This was a name I had heard of, but knew nothing of any such\ngentleman, or of the country.\n\n\"Well,\" says he, \"but won't you have your money, Jacque?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said I, \"if your worship would please, for I have had a\ngood place.\"\n\n\"If I would please to do what, prithee? Your money is ready, I tell\nthee.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said I; \"but I have had a good place.\"\n\n\"Well, and what dost thou mean, Jacque? I do not understand thee.\"\n\n\"Why, and please your worship, my old master, Sir Jonathan's father,\nleft me \u00c2\u00a330 when he died, and a suit of mourning, and----\"\n\n\"And what, prithee, Jacque? What, hast thou brought me more money?\"\nFor then he began to understand what I meant.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said I; \"and your worship would be so good to take it, and\nput it all together. I have saved some, too, out of my wages.\"\n\n\"I told you, Jacque,\" says he, \"you would be rich. And how much hast\nthou saved? Come, let me see it.\"\n\nTo shorten the story, I pulled it out, and he was content to take it,\ngiving me his note, with interest, for the whole sum, which amounted\nto \u00c2\u00a394; that is to say,\n\n     \u00c2\u00a325 The first money.\n       9 For six years' interest.\n      60 Now paid him.\n     ___\n     \u00c2\u00a394\n\n\nI came away exceeding joyful, made him abundance of bows and scrapes,\nand went immediately to shift my clothes again, with a resolution to\nrun away from London and see it no more for a great while. But I was\nsurprised the very next morning, when, going cross Rosemary Lane, by\nthe end of the place which is called Rag Fair, I heard one call\n\"Jacque.\" He had said something before, which I did not hear, but upon\nhearing the name Jacque I looked about me, immediately saw three men,\nand after them a constable coming towards me with great fury. I was in\na great surprise, and started to run, but one of them clapped in upon\nme, and got hold of me, and in a moment the rest surrounded me, and I\nwas taken. I asked them what they wanted, and what I had done. They\ntold me it was no place to talk of that there, but showed me their\nwarrant, and bade me read it, and I should know the rest when I came\nbefore the justice; so they hurried me away.\n\nI took the warrant, but, to my great affliction, I could know nothing\nby that, for I could not read; so I desired them to read it, and they\nread it, that they were to apprehend a known thief, that went by the\nname of one of the three Jacques of Rag Fair; for that he was charged\nupon oath with having been a party in a notorious robbery, burglary,\nand murder, committed so and so, in such a place, and on such a day.\n\nIt was to no purpose for me to deny it, or to say I knew nothing of\nit; that was none of their business, they said; that must be disputed,\nthey told me, before the justice, where I would find that it was sworn\npositively against me, and then, perhaps, I might be better satisfied.\n\nI had no remedy but patience; and as my heart was full of terror and\nguilt, so I was ready to die with the weight of it as they carried me\nalong. For as I very well knew that I was guilty of the first day's\nwork, though I was not of the last, so I did not doubt but I should be\nsent to Newgate, and then I took it for granted I must be hanged; for\nto go to Newgate and to be hanged were to me as things which\nnecessarily followed one another.\n\nBut I had a sharp conflict to go through before it came to that part;\nand that was before the justice; where, when I was come, and the\nconstable brought me in, the justice asked me my name. \"But hold,\"\nsays he, \"young man; before I ask you your name, let me do you\njustice. You are not bound to answer till your accusers come;\" so,\nturning to the constable, he asked for his warrant.\n\n\"Well,\" says the justice, \"you have brought this young man here by\nvirtue of this warrant. Is this young man the person for whom this\nwarrant is granted?\"\n\n_Con_. I believe so, and please your worship.\n\n_Just_. Believe so! Why, are you not sure of it?\n\n_Con_. An't please your worship, the people said so where I took him.\n\n_Just_. It is a very particular kind of warrant; it is to apprehend a\nyoung man who goes by the name of Jacque, but no surname, only that it\nis said he is called Captain Jacque, or some other such name. Now,\nyoung man, pray is your name Captain Jacque? or are you usually called\nso?\n\nI presently found that the men that took me knew nothing of me, and\nthe constable had taken me up by hearsay; so I took heart, and told\nthe justice that I thought, with submission, that it was not the\npresent question what my name was, but what these men, or any one\nelse, had to lay to my charge; whether I was the person who the\nwarrant empowered them to apprehend or no.\n\nHe smiled. \"'Tis very true, young man,\" says he, \"it is very true;\nand, on my word, if they have taken you up, and do not know you, and\nthere is nobody to charge you, they will be mistaken to their own\ndamage.\"\n\nThen I told his worship I hoped I should not be obliged to tell my\nname till my accuser was brought to charge me, and then I should not\nconceal my name.\n\n\"It is but reason,\" said his good worship. \"Mr. Constable,\" turning to\nthe officers, \"are you sure this is the person that is intended in\nyour warrant? If you are not, you must fetch the person that accuses\nhim, and on whose oath the warrant was granted.\" They used many words\nto insinuate that I was the person, and that I knew it well enough,\nand that I should be obliged to tell my name.\n\nI insisted on the unreasonableness of it, and that I should not be\nobliged to accuse myself: and the justice told them in so many words\nthat he could not force me to it, that I might do it if I would,\nindeed; \"but you see,\" says the justice, \"he understood too well to be\nimposed upon in that case.\" So that, in short, after an hour's\ndebating before his worship, in which time I pleaded against four of\nthem, the justice told them they must produce the accuser, or he must\ndischarge me.\n\nI was greatly encouraged at this, and argued with the more vigour for\nmyself. At length the accuser was brought, fettered as he was, from\nthe gaol, and glad I was when I saw him, and found that I knew him\nnot; that is to say, that it was not one of the two rogues that I went\nout with that night that we robbed the poor old woman.\n\nWhen the prisoner was brought into the room he was set right against\nme.\n\n\"Do you know this young man?\" says the justice.\n\n\"No, sir,\" says the prisoner; \"I never saw him in my life.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" says the justice; \"did not you charge one that goes by the name\nof Jacque, or Captain Jacque, as concerned in the robbery and murder\nwhich you are in custody for?\"\n\n_Pris_. Yes, an't please your worship.\n\n_Just_. And is this the man, or is he not?\n\n_Pris_. This is not the man, sir; I never saw this man before.\n\n\"Very good, Mr. Constable,\" says the justice, \"what must we do now?\"\n\n\"I am surprised,\" says the constable. \"I was at such a house\" (naming\nthe house), \"and this young man went by. The people cried out,\n'There's Jacque; that's your man;' and these people ran after him, and\napprehended him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says the justice, \"and have these people anything to say to\nhim? Can they prove that he is the person?\"\n\nOne said no, and the other said no; and, in short, they all said no.\n\"Why, then,\" said the justice, \"what can be done? The young man must\nbe discharged; and I must tell you, Mr. Constable, and you gentlemen\nthat have brought him hither, he may give you trouble, if he thinks\nfit, for your being so rash. But look you, young man,\" says the\njustice, \"you have no great damage done you, and the constable, though\nhe has been mistaken, had no ill design, but to be faithful to his\noffice. I think you may pass it by.\"\n\nI told his worship I would readily pass it by at his direction, but I\nthought the constable and the rest could do no less than to go back to\nthe place where they had insulted me, and declare publicly there that\nI was honourably acquitted, and that I was not the man. This his\nworship said was very reasonable, and the constable and his assistants\npromised to do it, and so we came all away good friends, and I was\ncleared with triumph.\n\n_Note_.--This was the time that, as I mentioned above, the justice\ntalked to me, and told me I was born to better things, and that by my\nwell managing of my own defence, he did not question but I had been\nwell educated; and that he was sorry I should fall into such a\nmisfortune as this, which he hoped, however, would be no dishonour to\nme, since I was so handsomely acquitted.\n\nThough his worship was mistaken in the matter of my education, yet it\nhad this good effect upon me, that I resolved, if possible, I would\nlearn to read and write, that I would not be such an uncapable\ncreature, that I should not be able to read a warrant, and see whether\nI was the person to be apprehended or not.\n\nBut there was something more in all this than what I have taken notice\nof; for, in a word, it appeared plainly that my brother, Captain\nJacque, who had the forwardness to put it to me whether I was among\nthem or no, when in truth he was there himself, had the only reason to\nbe afraid to fly, at the same time that he advised me to shift for\nmyself.\n\nAs this presently occurred to my thoughts, so I made it my business to\ninquire and find him out, and to give him notice of it.\n\nIn the meantime, being now confident of my own safety, I had no more\nconcern upon my mind about myself; but now I began to be anxious for\npoor Will, my master and tutor in wickedness, who was now fast by the\nheels in Newgate, while I was happily at liberty; and I wanted very\nmuch to go and see him, and accordingly did so.\n\nI found him in a sad condition, loaden with heavy irons, and had\nhimself no prospect or hope of escaping. He told me he should die, but\nbid me be easy; for, as it would do him no good to accuse me, who\nnever was out with any of them but that once, so I might depend upon\nit he would not bring me into the trouble. As for the rogue who had\nbetrayed them all, he was not able to hurt me, for I might be\nsatisfied he had never seen me in his life. \"But, Colonel Jacque,\"\nsays he, \"I will tell you who was with us, and that is, your brother\nthe captain, and the villain has certainly named him; and, therefore,\"\nsays he, \"if you can give him timely notice of it, do, that he may\nmake his escape.\"\n\nHe said a great many things to warn me off following the steps he had\nled me. \"I was far out, Jacque,\" said he, \"when I told you, to be a\nnotorious thief was to live like a gentleman.\" He chiefly discovered\nhis concern that they had, as he feared, killed the gentleman's\ngardener, and that he in particular had given him a wound in the neck,\nof which he was afraid he would die.\n\nHe had a great sum of money in gold about him, being the same that I\nhad carried back to him at the haystack; and he had concealed it so\nwell that those who took him had not found it, and he gave me the\ngreatest part of it to carry to his mother, which I very honestly\ndelivered, and came away with a heavy heart. Nor did I ever see him\nsince, for he was executed in about three weeks' time after, being\ncondemned that very next sessions.\n\nI had nothing to do now but to find the captain, who, though not\nwithout some trouble, I at last got news of, and told him the whole\nstory, and how I had been taken up for him by mistake, and was come\noff, but that the warrant was still out for him, and very strict\nsearch after him; I say, telling him all this, he presently discovered\nby his surprise that he was guilty, and after a few words more, told\nme plainly it was all true, that he was in the robbery, and that he\nhad the greatest part of the booty in keeping, but what to do with it,\nor himself, he did not know; and wanted me to tell him, which I was\nvery unfit to do, for I knew nothing of the world. Then he told me he\nhad a mind to fly into Scotland, which was easy to be done, and asked\nme if I would go with him. I told him I would, with all my heart, if I\nhad money enough to bear the charge. He had the trade still in his\neyes by his answer. \"I warrant you,\" says he, \"we will make the\njourney pay our charge.\" \"I dare not think of going any more upon the\nadventure,\" says I. \"Besides, if we meet with any misfortune out of\nour knowledge, we shall never get out of it; we shall be undone.\"\n\"Nay,\" says he; \"we shall find no mercy here, if they can catch us,\nand they can do no worse abroad. I am for venturing at all events.\"\n\n\"Well, but, captain,\" says I, \"have you husbanded your time so ill\nthat you have no money to supply you in such a time as this?\" \"I have\nvery little indeed,\" said he, \"for I have had bad luck lately.\" But he\nlied, for he had a great share of the booty they had got at their last\nadventure, as above; and, as the rest complained, he and Will had got\nalmost all of it, and kept the rest out of their shares, which made\nthem the willinger to discover them.\n\nHowever it was, he owned he had about \u00c2\u00a322 in money, and something that\nwould yield money--I suppose it was plate; but he would not tell me\nwhat it was, or where it was. But he said he durst not go to fetch it,\nfor he should be betrayed and seized, so he would venture without it.\n\"Sure,\" says he, \"we shall come back again some time or other.\"\n\nI honestly produced all the money I had, which was \u00c2\u00a316 and some odd\nshillings. \"Now,\" says I, \"if we are good husbands, and travel\nfrugally, this will carry us quite out of danger.\" For we had both\nbeen assured that when we came out of England we should be both safe,\nand nobody could hurt us, though they had known us; but we neither of\nus thought it was so many weary steps to Scotland as we found it.\n\nI speak of myself as in the same circumstances of danger with brother\nJacque; but it was only thus: I was in as much fear as he, but not in\nquite as much danger.\n\nI cannot omit that, in the interval of these things, and a few days\nbefore I carried my money to the gentleman in Tower Street, I took a\nwalk all alone into the fields, in order to go to Kentish Town and do\njustice to the poor old nurse. It happened that, before I was aware, I\ncrossed a field that came to the very spot where I robbed the poor old\nwoman and the maid, or where, I should say, Will made me rob them. My\nheart had reproached me many a time with that cruel action, and many a\ntime I promised to myself that I would find a way to make her\nsatisfaction and restore her money, and that day I had set apart for\nthe work, but was a little surprised that I was so suddenly upon the\nunhappy spot.\n\nThe place brought to my mind the villainy I had committed there, and\nsomething struck me with a kind of wish--I cannot say prayer, for I\nknew not what that meant--that I might leave off that cursed trade,\nand said to myself, \"Oh that I had some trade to live by! I would\nnever rob no more, for sure 'tis a wicked, abominable thing.\"\n\nHere indeed I felt the loss of what just parents do, and ought to do,\nby all their children--I mean, being bred to some trade or employment;\nand I wept many times that I knew not what to do or what to turn my\nhand to, though, I resolved to leave off the wicked course I was in.\n\nBut to return to my journey. I asked my way to Kentish Town, and it\nhappened to be of a poor woman that said she lived there; upon which\nintelligence I asked if she knew a woman that lived there whose name\nwas Smith. She answered yes, very well; that she was not a settled\ninhabitant, only a lodger in the town, but that she was an honest,\npoor, industrious woman, and by her labour and pains maintained a poor\ndiseased husband, that had been unable to help himself some years.\n\n\"What a villain have I been,\" said I to myself, \"that I should rob\nsuch a poor woman as this, and add grief and tears to her misery, and\nto the sorrows of her house!\" This quickened my resolution to restore\nher money; and not only so, but I resolved I would give her something\nover and above her loss. So I went forward, and by the direction I had\nreceived, found her lodging with very little trouble. Then asking for\nthe woman, she came to the door immediately; for she heard me ask for\nher by her name of a little girl that came first to the door. I\npresently spoke to her: \"Dame,\" said I, \"was not you robbed about a\nyear ago, as you was coming home from London, about Pindar of\nWakefield?\" \"Yes, indeed I was,\" says she; \"and sadly frighted into\nthe bargain.\" \"And how much did you lose?\" said I. \"Indeed,\" says she,\n\"I lost all the money I had in the world. I am sure I worked hard for\nit; it was money for keeping a nurse-child that I had then, and I had\nbeen at London to receive it.\" \"But how much was it, dame?\" said I.\n\"Why,\" says she, \"it was 22s. 6\u00c2\u00bdd.; 21s. I had been to fetch, and the\nodd money was my own before.\"\n\n\"Well, look you, good woman, what will you say if I should put you in\na way to get your money again? for I believe the fellow that took it\nis fast enough now, and perhaps I may do you a kindness in it, and for\nthat I came to see you.\" \"Oh dear!\" says the old woman, \"I understand\nyou, but indeed I cannot swear to the man's face again, for it was\ndark; and, besides, I would not hang the poor wretch for my money; let\nhim live and repent.\" \"That is very kind,\" says I--\"more than he\ndeserves from you; but you need not be concerned about that, for he\nwill be hanged whether you appear against him or not; but are you\nwilling to have your money again that you lost?\" \"Yes, indeed,\" says\nthe woman, \"I should be glad of that; for I have not been so hard put\nto it for money a great while as I am now; I have much ado to find us\nbread to eat, though I work hard early and late;\" and with that she\ncried.\n\nI thought it would have broken my very heart, to think how this poor\ncreature worked and was a slave at near threescore, and that I, a\nyoung fellow of hardly twenty, should rob her of her bread to support\nmy idleness and wicked life; and the tears came from my eyes in spite\nof all my struggling to prevent it, and the woman perceived it too.\n\"Poor woman,\" said I, \"'tis a sad thing such creatures as these should\nplunder and strip such a poor object as thou art. Well, he is at\nleisure now to repent it, I assure you.\" \"I perceive, sir,\" says she,\n\"you are very compassionate indeed. I wish he may improve the time God\nhas spared him, and that he may repent, and I pray God give him\nrepentance. Whoever he is, I forgive him, whether he can make me\nrecompense or not, and I pray God forgive him. I won't do him any\nprejudice, not I.\" And with that she went on praying for me.\n\n\"Well, dame, come hither to me,\" says I; and with that I put my hand\ninto my pocket, and she came to me. \"Hold up your hand,\" said I; which\nshe did, and I told her nine half-crowns into her hand. \"There, dame,\"\nsaid I, \"is your 22s. 6d. you lost. I assure you, dame,\" said I, \"I\nhave been the chief instrument to get it off him for you; for, ever\nsince he told me the story of it among the rest of his wicked\nexploits, I never gave him any rest till I made him promise me to make\nyou restitution.\" All the while I held her hand and put the money into\nit I looked in her face, and I perceived her colour come and go, and\nthat she was under the greatest surprise of joy imaginable.\n\n\"Well, God bless him,\" says she, \"and spare him from the disaster he\nis afraid of, if it be His will. For sure this is an act of so much\njustice, and so honest, that I never expected the like.\" She run on a\ngreat while so, and wept for him when I told her I doubted there was\nno room to expect his life. \"Well,\" says she, \"then pray God give him\nrepentance and bring him to heaven; for sure he must have something\nthat is good at the bottom; he has a principle of honesty at bottom to\nbe sure, however he may have been brought into bad courses by bad\ncompany or evil example, or other temptations; but I daresay he will\nbe brought to repentance one time or other before he dies.\"\n\nAll this touched me nearer than she imagined; for I was the man that\nshe prayed for all this while, though she did not know it, and in my\nheart I said amen to it. For I was sensible that I had done one of the\nvilest actions in the world in attacking a poor creature in such a\ncondition, and not listening to her entreaties when she begged so\nheartily for that little money we took from her.\n\nIn a word, the good woman so moved me with her charitable prayers that\nI put my hand in my pocket again for her: \"Dame,\" said I, \"you are so\ncharitable in your petitions for this miserable creature that it puts\nme in mind of one thing more which I will do for him, whether he\nordered me or not; and that is, to ask your forgiveness for the thief\nin robbing you. For it was an offence and a trespass against you, as\nwell as an injury to you; and therefore I ask your pardon for him.\nWill you sincerely and heartily forgive him, dame? I do desire it of\nyou;\" and with that I stood up, and, with my hat off, asked her\npardon. \"O sir!\" says she, \"do not stand up, and with your hat off to\nme. I am a poor woman; I forgive him, and all that were with him; for\nthere was one or more with him. I forgive them with all my heart, and\nI pray God to forgive them.\"\n\n\"Well, dame, then,\" said I, \"to make you some recompense for your\ncharity, there is something for you more than your loss;\" and with\nthat I gave her a crown more.\n\nThen I asked her who that was who was robbed with her. She said it was\na servant-maid that lived then in the town, but she was gone from her\nplace, and she did not know where she lived now. \"Well, dame,\" says\nI, \"if ever you do hear of her, let her leave word where she may be\nfound; and if I live to come and see you again, I will get the money\noff him for her too. I think that was but little, was it?\" \"No,\" says\nshe; \"it was but 5s. 6d.,\" which I knew as well as she. \"Well,\" says\nI, \"dame, inquire her out if you have an opportunity;\" so she promised\nme she would, and away I came.\n\nThe satisfaction this gave me was very much; but then a natural\nconsequence attended it, which filled me with reflection afterwards;\nand this was, that, by the same rule, I ought to make restitution to\nall that I had wronged in the like manner; and what could I do as to\nthat? To this I knew not what to say, and so the thought in time wore\noff; for, in short, it was impossible to be done. I had not ability,\nneither did I know any of the people whom I had so injured; and that\nsatisfying me for the present, I let it drop.\n\nI come now to my journey with Captain Jacque, my supposed brother. We\nset out from London on foot, and travelled the first day to Ware; for\nwe had learnt so much of our road that the way lay through that town.\nWe were weary enough the first day, having not been used at all to\ntravelling; but we made shift to walk once up and down the town after\nwe came into it.\n\nI soon found that his walking out to see the town was not to satisfy\nhis curiosity in viewing the place, for he had no notion of anything\nof that kind, but to see if he could light of any purchase. For he was\nso natural a thief that he could see nothing on the road but it\noccurred to him how easily that might be taken, and how cleverly this\nmight be carried off, and the like.\n\nNothing offered in Ware to his mind, it not being market-day; and as\nfor me, though I made no great scruple of eating and drinking at the\ncost of his roguery, yet I resolved not to enter upon anything, as\nthey called it, nor to take the least thing from anybody.\n\nWhen the captain found me resolved upon the negative, he asked me how\nI thought to travel. I asked him what he thought of himself, that was\nsure to be hanged if he was taken, how small soever the crime was that\nhe should be taken for. \"How can that be?\" says he; \"they don't know\nme in the country.\" \"Ay,\" says I; \"but do you think they do not send\nup word to Newgate as soon as any thief is taken in the country, and\nso inquire who is escaped from them, or who is fled, that they may be\nstopped? Assure yourself,\" says I, \"the gaolers correspond with one\nanother, with the greatest exactness imaginable; and if you were taken\nhere but for stealing a basket of eggs, you shall have your accuser\nsent down to see if he knows you.\"\n\nThis terrified him a little for a while, and kept him honest for three\nor four days; but it was but for a few days indeed, for he played a\ngreat many rogue's tricks without me; till at last he came to his end\nwithout me too, though it was not till many years after, as you shall\nhear in its order. But as these exploits are no part of my story, but\nof his, whose life and exploits are sufficient to make a volume larger\nthan this by itself, so I shall omit every thing but what I was\nparticularly concerned in during this tedious journey.\n\nFrom Ware we travelled to Cambridge, though that was not our direct\nroad. The occasion was this: in our way, going through a village\ncalled Puckeridge, we baited at an inn, at the sign of the Falcon, and\nwhile we were there a countryman comes to the inn, and hangs his horse\nat the door while he goes in to drink. We sat in the gateway, having\ncalled for a mug of beer, and drank it up. We had been talking with\nthe hostler about the way to Scotland, and he had bid us ask the road\nto Royston. \"But,\" says he, \"there is a turning just here a little\nfarther. You must not go that way, for that goes to Cambridge.\"\n\nWe had paid for our beer, and sat at the door only to rest us, when on\nthe sudden comes a gentleman's coach to the door, and three or four\nhorsemen. The horsemen rode into the yard, and the hostler was obliged\nto go in with them. Says he to the captain, \"Young man, pray take hold\nof the horse\" (meaning the countryman's horse I mentioned above),\n\"and take him out of the way, that the coach may come up.\" He did so,\nand beckoned me to follow him. We walked together to the turning. Says\nhe to me, \"Do you step before and turn up the lane. I'll overtake\nyou.\" So I went on up the lane, and in a few minutes he was got up\nupon the horse and at my heels. \"Come, get up,\" says he; \"we will have\na lift, if we don't get the horse by the bargain.\"\n\nI made no difficulty to get up behind him, and away we went at a good\nround rate, it being a good strong horse. We lost no time for an\nhour's riding and more, by which time we thought we were out of the\nreach of being pursued. And as the country man, when he should miss\nhis horse, would hear that we inquired the way to Royston, he would\ncertainly pursue us that way, and not towards Cambridge. We went\neasier after the first hour's riding, and coming through a town or\ntwo, we alighted by turns, and did not ride double through the\nvillages.\n\n\n[Image: Escaping with the purloined horse.]\n\n\nNow, as it was impossible for the captain to pass by anything that he\ncould lay his hand on and not take it, so now, having a horse to carry\nit off too, the temptation was the stronger. Going through a village\nwhere a good housewife of the house had been washing, and hung her\nclothes out upon a hedge near the road, he could not help it, but got\nhold of a couple of good shirts that were but about half dry, and\novertook me upon the spur; for I walked on before. I immediately got\nup behind, and away we galloped together as fast as the horse would\nwell go. In this part of our expedition his good luck or mine carried\nus quite out of the road, and having seen nobody to ask the way of, we\nlost ourselves, and wandered I know not how many miles to the right\nhand, till, partly by that means and partly by the occasion following,\nwe came quite into the coach-road to Cambridge from London by\nBishop-Stortford. The particular occasion that made me wander on was\nthus: the country was all open cornfields, no enclosures; when, being\nupon a little rising ground, I bade him stop the horse, for I would\nget down and walk a little to ease my legs, being tired with riding so\nlong behind without stirrups. When I was down and looked a little\nabout me, I saw plainly the great white road, which we should have\ngone, at near two miles from us.\n\nOn a sudden looking a little back to my left, upon that road, I saw\nfour or five horsemen riding full speed, some a good way before the\nothers, and hurrying on, as people in a full pursuit.\n\nIt immediately struck me: \"Ha! brother Jacque,\" says I, \"get off the\nhorse this moment, and ask why afterwards.\" So he jumps off. \"What is\nthe matter?\" says he. \"The matter!\" says I. \"Look yonder; it is well\nwe have lost our way. Do you see how they ride? They are pursuing us,\nyou may depend upon it. Either,\" says I, \"you are pursued from the\nlast village for the two shirts, or from Puckeridge for the horse.\" He\nhad so much presence of mind that, without my mentioning it to him, he\nputs back the horse behind a great white thorn-bush, which grew just\nby him; so they could by no means see the horse, which, we being just\nat the top of the hill, they might otherwise have done, and so have\npursued that way at a venture.\n\nBut as it was impossible for them to see the horse, so was it as\nimpossible for them to see us at that distance, who sat down on the\nground to look at them the more securely.\n\nThe road winding about, we saw them a great way, and they rode as fast\nas they could make their horses go. When we found they were gone quite\nout of sight, we mounted and made the best of our way also; and\nindeed, though we were two upon one horse, yet we abated no speed\nwhere the way would admit of it, not inquiring of anybody the way to\nanywhere till, after about two hours' riding, we came to a town,\nwhich, upon inquiry, they called Chesterford. And here we stopped, and\nasked not our way to any place, but whither that road went, and were\ntold it was the coach-road to Cambridge; also that it was the way to\nNewmarket, to St. Edmund's Bury, to Norwich and Yarmouth, to Lynn, and\nto Ely, and the like.\n\nWe stayed here a good while, believing ourselves secure; and\nafterwards, towards evening, went forward to a place called\nBournbridge, where the road to Cambridge turns away out of the road to\nNewmarket, and where there are but two houses only, both of them being\ninns. Here the captain says to me, \"Hark ye, you see we are pursued\ntowards Cambridge, and shall be stopped if we go thither. Now\nNewmarket is but ten miles off, and there we may be safe, and perhaps\nget an opportunity to do some business.\"\n\n\"Look ye, Jacque,\" said I, \"talk no more of doing business, for I will\nnot join with you in anything of that kind. I would fain get you to\nScotland before you get a halter about your neck. I will not have you\nhanged in England, if I can help it; and therefore I won't go to\nNewmarket, unless you will promise me to take no false steps there.\"\n\"Well,\" says he, \"if I must not, then I won't; but I hope you will let\nus get another horse, won't you, that we may travel faster?\" \"No,\"\nsays I, \"I won't agree to that; but if you will let me send this horse\nback fairly, I will tell you how we shall hire horses afterwards, for\none stage, or two, and then take them as far as we please: it is only\nsending a letter to the owner to send for him, and then, if we are\nstopped, it can do us but little hurt.\"\n\n\"You are a wary, politic gentleman,\" says the captain, \"but I say we\nare better as we are; for we are out of all danger of being stopped on\nthe way after we are gone from this place.\"\n\nWe had not parleyed thus long, but, though in the dead of the night,\ncame a man to the other inn door--for, as I said above, there are two\ninns at that place--and called for a pot of beer; but the people were\nall in bed, and would not rise. He asked them if they had seen two\nfellows come that way upon one horse. The man said he had, that they\nwent by in the afternoon, and asked the way to Cambridge, but did not\nstop only to drink one mug. \"Oh!\" says he, \"are they gone to\nCambridge? Then I'll be with them quickly.\" I was awake in a little\ngarret of the next inn, where we lodged, and hearing the fellow call\nat the door, got up and went to the window, having some uneasiness at\nevery noise I heard; and by that means heard the whole story. Now, the\ncase is plain, our hour was not come, our fate had determined other\nthings for us, and we were to be reserved for it. The matter was thus.\nWhen we first came to Bournbridge, we called at the first house, and\nasked the way to Cambridge, drank a mug of beer and went on, and they\nmight see to turn off to go the way they directed. But night coming\non, and we being very weary, we thought we should not find the way;\nand we came back in the dusk of the evening, and went into the other\nhouse, being the first as we came back, as that where we called before\nwas the first as we went forward.\n\nYou may be sure I was alarmed now, as indeed I had reason to be. The\ncaptain was in bed and fast asleep, but I wakened him, and roused him\nwith a noise that frighted him enough. \"Rise, Jacque,\" said I; \"we are\nboth ruined; they are come after us hither.\" Indeed, I was wrong to\nterrify him at that rate; for he started, and jumped out of bed, and\nran directly to the window, not knowing where he was, and, not quite\nawake, was just going to jump out of the window, but I laid hold of\nhim. \"What are you going to do?\" says I. \"I won't be taken,\" says he.\n\"Let me alone. Where are they?\"\n\nThis was all confusion; and he was so out of himself with the fright,\nand being overcome with sleep, that I had much to do to prevent his\njumping out of the window. However, I held him fast, and thoroughly\nwakened him, and then all was well again, and he was presently\ncomposed.\n\nThen I told him the story, and we sat together upon the bedside,\nconsidering what we should do. Upon the whole, as the fellow that\ncalled was apparently gone to Cambridge, we had nothing to fear, but\nto be quiet till daybreak, and then to mount and be gone.\n\nAccordingly, as soon as day peeped we were up; and having happily\ninformed ourselves of the road at the other house, and being told that\nthe road to Cambridge turned off on the left hand, and that the road\nto Newmarket lay straight forward--I say, having learnt this, the\ncaptain told me he would walk away on foot towards Newmarket; and so,\nwhen I came to go out, I should appear as a single traveller. And\naccordingly he went out immediately, and away he walked; and he\ntravelled so hard that when I came to follow, I thought once that he\nhad dropped me; for though I rode hard, I got no sight of him for an\nhour. At length, having passed the great bank called the Devil's\nDitch, I found him, and took him up behind me, and we rode double till\nwe came almost to the end of Newmarket town. Just at the hither house\nin the town stood a horse at a door, just as it was at Puckeridge.\n\"Now,\" says Jack, \"if the horse was at the other end of the town I\nwould have him, as sure as we had the other at Puckeridge;\" but it\nwould not do; so he got down and walked through the town on the\nright-hand side of the way.\n\nHe had not got half through the town but the horse, having somehow or\nother got loose, came trotting gently on by himself, and nobody\nfollowing him. The captain, an old soldier at such work, as soon as\nthe horse was got a pretty way before him, and that he saw nobody\nfollowed, sets up a run after the horse, and the horse, hearing him\nfollow, ran the faster. Then the captain calls out, \"Stop the horse!\"\nand by this time the horse was got almost to the farther end of the\ntown, the people of the house where he stood not missing him all the\nwhile.\n\nUpon his calling out, \"Stop the horse!\" the poor people of the town,\nsuch as were next at hand, ran from both sides the way and stopped the\nhorse for him, as readily as could be, and held him for him till he\ncame up. He very gravely comes up to the horse, hits him a blow or\ntwo, and calls him dog for running away, gives the man twopence that\ncatched him for him, mounts, and away he comes after me.\n\nThis was the oddest adventure that could have happened, for the horse\nstole the captain, the captain did not steal the horse. When he came\nup to me, \"Now, Colonel Jacque,\" says he, \"what say you to good luck?\nWould you have had me refuse the horse, when he came so civilly to ask\nme to ride?\" \"No, no,\" said I; \"you have got this horse by your wit,\nnot by design; and you may go on now, I think. You are in a safer\ncondition than I am, if we are taken.\"\n\nThe next question was what road we should take. Here were four ways\nbefore us, and we were alike strangers to them all. First, on the\nright hand, and at about a little mile from the town, a great road\nwent off to St. Edmund's Bury; straight on, but in clining afterwards\nto the right, lay the great road to Barton Mills and Thetford, and so\nto Norwich; and full before us lay a great road, also, to Brandon and\nLynn; and on the left lay a less road to the city of Ely, and into the\nfens.\n\nIn short, as we knew not which road to take, nor which way to get into\nthe great north road, which we had left, so we, by mere unguided\nchance, took the way to Brandon, and so to Lynn. At Brand, or Brandon,\nwe were told that, passing over at a place called Downham Bridge, we\nmight cross the fen country to Wisbeach, and from thence go along that\nbank of the river Nene to Peterborough, and from thence to Stamford,\nwhere we were in the northern road again; and likewise, that at Lynn\nwe might go by the Washes into Lincolnshire, and so might travel\nnorth. But, upon the whole, this was my rule, that, when we inquired\nthe way to any particular place, to be sure we never took that road,\nbut some other which the accidental discourse we might have should\nbring in. And thus we did here; for, having chiefly asked our way into\nthe northern road, we resolved to go directly for Lynn.\n\nWe arrived here very easy and safe, and while we was considering of\nwhat way we should travel next we found we were got to a point, and\nthat there was no way now left but that by the Washes into\nLincolnshire, and that was represented as very dangerous; so an\nopportunity offering of a man that was travelling over the fens, we\ntook him for our guide, and went with him to Spalding, and from thence\nto a town called Deeping, and so to Stamford in Lincolnshire.\n\nThis is a large, populous town, and it was market-day when we came to\nit; so we put in at a little house at the hither end of the town, and\nwalked into the town.\n\nHere it was not possible to restrain my captain from playing his feats\nof art, and my heart ached for him. I told him I would not go with\nhim, for he would not promise, and I was so terribly concerned at the\napprehensions of his venturous humour that I would not so much as stir\nout of my lodging; but it was in vain to persuade him. He went into\nthe market, and found a mountebank there, which was what he wanted.\nHow he picked two pockets there in one quarter of an hour, and brought\nto our quarters a piece of new holland of eight or nine ells, a piece\nof stuff, and played three or four pranks more in less than two hours;\nand how afterward he robbed a doctor of physic, and yet came off\nclear in them all--this, I say, as above, belongs to his story, not\nmine.\n\nI scolded heartily at him when he came back, and told him he would\ncertainly ruin himself, and me too, before he left off, and threatened\nin so many words that I would leave him, and go back and carry the\nhorse to Puckeridge where we borrowed it, and so go to London by\nmyself.\n\nHe promised amendment; but as we resolved (now we were in the great\nroad) to travel by night, so it being not yet night, he gives me the\nslip again, and was not gone half-an-hour but he comes back with a\ngold watch in his hand: \"Come,\" says he, \"why ain't you ready to go? I\nam ready to go as soon as you will;\" and with that he pulls out the\ngold watch. I was amazed at such a thing as that in a country town;\nbut it seems there was prayers at one of the churches in the evening,\nand he, placing himself as the occasion directed, found the way to be\nso near the lady as to get it from her side, and walked off with it\nunperceived.\n\nThe same night we went away by moonlight, after having the\nsatisfaction to hear the watch cried, and ten guineas offered for it\nagain. He would have been glad of the ten guineas instead of the\nwatch, but durst not venture carry it home. \"Well,\" says I, \"you are\nafraid, and you have reason. Give it me; I will venture to carry it\nagain.\" But he would not let me, but told me that when he came into\nScotland we might sell anything there without danger; which was true\nindeed, for there they asked us no questions.\n\nWe set out, as I said, in the evening by moon light, and travelled\nhard, the road being very plain and large, till we came to Grantham,\nby which time it was about two in the morning, and all the town, as it\nwere, dead asleep. So we went on for Newark, where we reached about\neight in the morning, and there we lay down and slept most of the day;\nand by this sleeping so continually in the day-time I kept him from\ndoing a great deal of mischief, which he would otherwise have done.\n\nFrom Newark we took advice of one that was accidentally comparing the\nroads, and we concluded that the road by Nottingham would be the best\nfor us; so we turned out of the great road, and went up the side of\nthe Trent to Nottingham. Here he played his pranks again in a manner\nthat it was the greatest wonder imaginable to me that he was not\nsurprised, and yet he came off clear. And now he had got so many bulky\ngoods that he bought him a portmanteau to carry them in. It was in\nvain for me to offer to restrain him any more; so after this he went\non his own way.\n\nAt Nottingham, I say, he had such success that made us the hastier to\nbe going than otherwise we would have been, lest we would have been\nbaulked, and should be laid hold of. From thence we left the road,\nwhich leads to the north again, and went away by Mansfield into\nScarsdale, in Yorkshire.\n\nI shall take up no more of my own story with his pranks; they very\nwell merit to be told by themselves. But I shall observe only what\nrelates to our journey. In a word, I dragged him along as fast as I\ncould, till I came to Leeds, in Yorkshire. Here, though it be a large\nand populous town, yet he could make nothing of it; neither had he any\nsuccess at Wakefield; and he told me, in short, that the north-country\npeople were certainly all thieves. \"Why so?\" said I. \"The people seem\nto be just as other people are.\" \"No, no,\" says he; \"they have their\neyes so about them, and are all so sharp, they look upon everybody\nthat comes near them to be a pickpocket, or else they would never\nstand so upon their guard. And then again,\" says he, \"they are so\npoor, there is but little to be got; and I am afraid,\" says he, \"the\nfarther we go north, we shall find it worse.\" \"Well,\" says I, \"what do\nyou infer from thence?\" \"I argue from thence,\" says he, \"that we shall\ndo nothing there, and I had as good go back into the south and be\nhanged as into the north to be starved.\"\n\nWell, we came at length to Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Here, on a market-day,\nwas a great throng of people, and several of the townspeople going to\nmarket to buy provisions; and here he played his pranks, cheated a\nshopkeeper of \u00c2\u00a315 or \u00c2\u00a316 in goods, and got clear away with them; stole\na horse, and sold that he came upon, and played so many pranks that I\nwas quite frighted for him. I say for him, for I was not concerned for\nmyself, having never stirred out of the house where I lodged--at least\nnot with him, nor without some or other with me belonging to the inn\nthat might give an account of me.\n\nNor did I use this caution in vain; for he had made himself so public\nby his rogueries that he was waylaid everywhere to be taken, and had\nhe not artfully at first given out that he was come from Scotland and\nwas going toward London, inquiring that road, and the like, which\namused his pursuers for the first day, he had been taken, and in all\nprobability had been hanged there. But by that artifice he got half a\nday's time of them; and yet, as it was, he was put so to it that he\nwas fain to plunge, horse and all, into the river Tweed, and swim\nover, and thereby made his escape. It was true that he was before upon\nScots ground (as they call it), and consequently they had no power to\nhave carried him off, if anybody had opposed them; yet, as they were\nin a full chase after him, could they have come up with him they would\nhave run the risk of the rest, and they could but have delivered him\nup if they had been questioned about it. However, as he got over the\nTweed, and was landed safe, they could neither follow him, the water\nbeing too high at the usual place of going over, nor could they have\nattempted to have brought him away if they had taken him. The place\nwhere he took the river was where there is a ford below Kelso, but the\nwater being up, the ford was not passable, and he had no time to go to\nthe ferry-boat, which is about a furlong off, opposite to the town.\n\nHaving thus made his escape, he went to Kelso, where he had appointed\nme to come after him. I followed with a heavy heart, expecting every\nhour to meet him upon the road in the custody of the constables and\nsuch people, or to hear of him in the gaol; but when I came to a place\non the border called Woller-haugh-head, there I understood how he had\nbeen chased, and how he made his escape.\n\nWhen I came to Kelso he was easy enough to be found; for his having\ndesperately swam the Tweed, a rapid and large river, made him much\ntalked of, though it seems they had not heard of the occasion of it,\nnor anything of his character; for he had wit enough to conceal all\nthat, and live as retired as he could till I came to him.\n\nI was not so much rejoiced at his safety as I was provoked at his\nconduct; and the more, for that I could not find he had yet the least\nnotion of his having been void of common-sense with respect to his\ncircumstances, as well as contrary to what he promised me. However, as\nthere was no beating anything into his head by words, I only told him\nthat I was glad he was at last gotten into a place of safety, and I\nasked him then how he intended to manage himself in that country. He\nsaid in few words he did not know yet. He doubted the people were very\npoor; but if they had any money he was resolved to have some of it.\n\n\"But do you know, too,\" says I, \"that they are the severest people\nupon criminals of your kind in the world?\" He did not value that, he\nsaid, in his blunt, short way; he would venture it. Upon this I told\nhim that, seeing it was so, and he would run such ventures, I would\ntake my leave of him and be gone back to England. He seemed sullen, or\nrather it was the roughness of his untractable disposition. He said I\nmight do what I would, he would do as he found opportunity. However,\nwe did not part immediately, but went on towards the capital city. On\nthe road we found too much poverty and too few people to give him room\nto expect any advantage in his way; and though he had his eyes about\nhim as sharp as a hawk, yet he saw plainly there was nothing to be\ndone; for as to the men, they did not seem to have much money about\nthem; and for the women, their dress was such that, had they any\nmoney, or indeed any pockets, it was impossible to come at them; for,\nwearing large plaids about them and down to their knees, they were\nwrapped up so close that there was no coming to make the least attempt\nof that kind.\n\nKelso was indeed a good town, and had abundance of people in it; and\nyet, though he stayed one Sunday there, and saw the church, which is\nvery large and thronged with people, yet, as he told me, there was not\none woman to be seen in all the church with any other dress than a\nplaid, except in two pews, which belonged to some nobleman, and who,\nwhen they came out, were so surrounded with footmen and servants that\nthere was no coming near them, any more than there was any coming near\nthe king surrounded by his guards.\n\nWe set out, therefore, with this discouragement, which I was secretly\nglad of, and went forward to Edinburgh. All the way thither we went\nthrough no considerable town, and it was but very coarse travelling\nfor us, who were strangers; for we met with waters which were very\ndangerous to pass, by reason of hasty rains, at a place called\nLauderdale, and where my captain was really in danger of drowning, his\nhorse being driven down by the stream, and fell under him, by which he\nwetted and spoiled his stolen goods that he brought from Newcastle,\nand which he had kept dry strangely, by holding them up in his arms\nwhen he swam the Tweed. But here it wanted but little that he and his\nhorse had been lost, not so much by the depth of the water as the fury\nof the current. But he had a proverb in his favour, and he got out of\nthe water, though with difficulty enough, not being born to be\ndrowned, as I shall observe afterwards in its place.\n\nWe came to Edinburgh the third day from Kelso, having stopped at an\ninn one whole day, at a place called Soutrahill, to dry our goods and\nrefresh ourselves. We were oddly saluted at Edinburgh. The next day\nafter we came thither, my captain having a desire to walk and look\nabout him, asked me if I would go and see the town. I told him yes; so\nwe went out, and coming through a gate that they call the Nether Bow,\ninto the great High Street, which went up to the Cross, we were\nsurprised to see it thronged with an infinite number of people. \"Ay,\"\nsays my captain, \"this will do.\" However, as I had made him promise to\nmake no adventures that day, otherwise I told him I would not go out\nwith him, so I held him by the sleeve, and would not let him stir from\nme.\n\nThen we came up to the Market Cross, and there besides the great\nnumber of people who passed and repassed, we saw a great parade or\nkind of meeting, like an exchange of gentlemen, of all ranks and\nqualities, and this encouraged my captain again, and he pleased\nhimself with that sight.\n\nIt was while we were looking, and wondering at what we saw here, that\nwe were surprised with a sight which we little expected. We observed\nthe people running on a sudden, as to see some strange thing just\ncoming along; and strange it was indeed: for we see two men naked from\nthe waist upwards run by us as swift as the wind, and we imagined\nnothing but that it was two men running a race for some mighty wager.\nOn a sudden we found two long, small ropes or lines, which hung down\nat first, pulled straight, and the two racers stopped, and stood\nstill, one close by the other. We could not imagine what this meant,\nbut the reader may judge at our surprise when we found a man follow\nafter, who had the ends of both those lines in his hands, and who,\nwhen he came up to them, gave each of them two frightful lashes with a\nwire whip or lash, which he held in the other hand. And then the two\npoor naked wretches run on again to the length of their line or\ntether, where they waited for the like salutation; and in this\nmanner they danced the length of the whole street, which is about\nhalf-a-mile.\n\nThis was a dark prospect to my captain, and put him in mind, not only\nof what he was to expect if he made a slip in the way of his\nprofession in this place, but also of what he had suffered when he was\nbut a boy, at the famous place called Bridewell.\n\nBut this was not all; for, as we saw the execution, so we were curious\nto examine into the crime too; and we asked a young fellow who stood\nnear us what the two men had done for which they suffered that\npunishment. The fellow, an unhappy, ill-natured Scotchman, perceived\nby our speech that we were Englishmen, and by our question that we\nwere strangers, told us, with a malicious wit, that they were two\nEnglishmen, and that they were whipped so for picking pockets, and\nother petty thieveries, and that they were afterwards to be sent away\nover the border into England.\n\nNow this was every word of it false, and was only formed by his nimble\ninvention to insult us as Englishmen; for when we inquired further,\nthey were both Scotchmen, and were thus scourged for the usual\noffences for which we give the like punishment in England. And the man\nwho held the line and scourged them was the city hangman, who (by the\nway) is there an officer of note, has a constant salary, and is a man\nof substance; and not only so, but a most dexterous fellow in his\noffice, and makes a great deal of money of his employment.\n\nThis sight, however, was very shocking to us; and my captain turned to\nme: \"Come,\" says he, \"let us go away; I won't stay here any longer.\" I\nwas glad to hear him say so, but did not think he had meant or\nintended what he said. However, we went back to our quarters, and kept\npretty much within, only that in the evenings we walked about. But\neven then my captain found no employment, no encouragement. Two or\nthree times, indeed, he made a prize of some mercery and millinery\ngoods; but when he had them he knew not what to do with them, so that,\nin short, he was forced to be honest in spite of his goodwill to be\notherwise.\n\nWe remained here about a month, when, on a sudden, my captain was\ngone, horse and all, and I knew nothing what was become of him. Nor\ndid I ever see or hear of him for eighteen months after, nor did he so\nmuch as leave the least notice for me, either whither he was gone or\nwhether he would return to Edinburgh again or no.\n\nI took his leaving me very heinously, not knowing what to do with\nmyself, being a stranger in the place; and, on the other hand, my\nmoney abated apace too. I had for the most part of this time my horse\nupon my hands to keep; and as horses yield but a sorry price in\nScotland, I found no opportunity to make much of him; and, on the\nother hand, I had a secret resolution, if I had gone back to England,\nto have restored him to the owner, at Puckeridge, by Ware. And so I\nshould have wronged him of nothing but the use of him for so long a\ntime; but I found an occasion to answer all my designs about the horse\nto advantage.\n\nThere came a man to the stabler--so they call the people at Edinburgh\nthat take in horses to keep--and wanted to know if he could hear of\nany returned horses for England. My landlord, so we called him, came\nbluntly to me one day, and asked me if my horse was my own. It was an\nodd question, as my circumstances stood, and puzzled me at first; and\nI asked why, and what was the matter. \"Because,\" says he, \"if it be a\nhired horse in England, as is often the case with Englishmen who come\nto Scotland, I could help you to send it back, and get you something\nfor riding.\" So he expressed himself.\n\nI was very glad of the occasion, and, in short, took security there of\nthe person for delivering the horse safe and sound, and had 15s.\nsterling for the riding him. Upon this agreement, I gave order to\nleave the horse at the Falcon, at Puckeridge, and where I heard, many\nyears after, that he was honestly left, and that the owner had him\nagain, but had nothing for the loan of him.\n\nBeing thus eased of the expense of my horse, and having nothing at all\nto do, I began to consider with myself what would become of me, and\nwhat I could turn my hand to. I had not much diminished my stock of\nmoney, for though I was all the way so wary that I would not join with\nmy captain in his desperate attempts, yet I made no scruple to live at\nhis expense, which, as I came out of England only to keep him company,\nhad been but just, had I not known that all he had to spend upon me\nwas what he robbed honest people of, and that I was all that while a\nreceiver of stolen goods. But I was not come off so far then as to\nscruple that part at all.\n\nIn the next place, I was not so anxious about my money running low,\nbecause I knew what a reserve I had made at London. But still I was\nvery willing to have engaged in any honest employment for a\nlivelihood, for I was sick indeed of the wandering life which I had\nled, and was resolved to thieve no more. But then two or three things\nwhich I had offered me I lost, because I could not write or read.\n\nThis afflicted me a great while very much; but the stabler, as I have\ncalled him, delivered me from my anxiety that way by bringing me to an\nhonest but a poor young man, who undertook to teach me both to write\nand read, and in a little time too, and for a small expense, if I\nwould take pains at it. I promised all possible diligence, and to work\nI went with it, but found the writing much more difficult to me than\nthe reading.\n\nHowever, in half a year's time, or thereabouts, I could read, and\nwrite too, tolerably well, insomuch that I began to think I was now\nfit for business. And I got by it into the service of a certain\nofficer of the customs, who employed me for a time; but as he set me\nto do little but pass and repass between Leeds and Edinburgh, with the\naccounts which he kept for the farmers of the customs there, leaving\nme to live at my own expense till my wages should be due, I run out\nthe little money I had left, in clothes and subsistence, and a little\nbefore the year's end, when I was to have \u00c2\u00a312 English money, truly my\nmaster was turned out of his place; and, which was worse, having been\ncharged with some misapplications, was obliged to take shelter in\nEngland, and so we that were servants, for there were three of us,\nwere left to shift for ourselves.\n\nThis was a hard case for me in a strange place, and I was reduced by\nit to the last extremity. I might have gone for England, an English\nship being there. The master proffered me to give me my passage (upon\ntelling him my distress), and to take my word for the payment of 10s.\nwhen I came there. But my captain appeared just then under new\ncircumstances, which obliged him not to go away, and I was loth to\nleave him. It seems we were yet further to take our fate together.\n\nI have mentioned that he left me, and that I saw him no more for\neighteen months. His rambles and adventures were many in that time. He\nwent to Glasgow, played some remarkable pranks there, escaped almost\nmiraculously from the gallows; got over to Ireland, wandered about\nthere, turned raparee, and did some villainous things there, and\nescaped from Londonderry, over to the Highlands in the north of\nScotland; and about a month before I was left destitute at Leith by my\nmaster, behold! my noble Captain Jacque came in there, on board the\nferry-boat from Fife, being, after all adventures and successes,\nadvanced to the dignity of a foot-soldier in a body of recruits raised\nin the north for the regiment of Douglas.\n\nAfter my disaster, being reduced almost as low as my captain, I found\nno better shift before me, at least for the present, than to enter\nmyself a soldier too; and thus we were ranked together, with each of\nus a musket upon our shoulders; and I confess that thing did not sit\nso ill upon me as I thought at first it would have done; for though I\nfared hard and lodged ill (for the last, especially, is the fate of\npoor soldiers in that part of the world), yet to me that had been used\nto lodge on the ashes in the glass house, this was no great matter. I\nhad a secret satisfaction at being now under no necessity of stealing,\nand living in fear of a prison, and of the lash of the hangman--a\nthing which, from the time I saw it in Edinburgh, was so terrible to\nme that I could not think of it without horror. And it was an\ninexpressible ease to my mind that I was now in a certain way of\nliving, which was honest, and which I could say was not unbecoming a\ngentleman.\n\nWhatever was my satisfaction in that part, yet other circumstances did\nnot equally concur to make this life suit me; for after we had been\nabout six months in this figure, we were informed that the recruits\nwere all to march for England, and to be shipped off at Newcastle, or\nat Hull, to join the regiment, which was then in Flanders.\n\nI should tell you that, before this, I was extremely delighted with\nthe life of a soldier, and I took the exercise so naturally that the\nsergeant that taught us to handle our arms, seeing me so ready at it,\nasked me if I had never carried arms before. I told him no; at which\nhe swore, though jesting. \"They call you colonel,\" says he, \"and I\nbelieve you will be a colonel, or you must be some colonel's bastard,\nor you would never handle your arms as you do, at once or twice\nshowing.\"\n\nThis pleased me extremely, and encouraged me, and I was mightily taken\nwith the life of a soldier; but when my captain came and told me the\nnews, that we were to march for England, and to be shipped off for\nFlanders at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, I was surprised very much, and new\nthoughts began to come in my mind; as, first, my captain's condition\nwas particular, for he durst not appear publicly at Newcastle, as he\nmust have done if he had marched with the battalion (for they were a\nbody of above four hundred, and therefore called themselves a\nbattalion, though we were but recruits, and belonged to several\ncompanies abroad)--I say, he must have marched with them, and been\npublicly seen, in which case he would have been apprehended and\ndelivered up. In the next place I remembered that I had almost \u00c2\u00a3100 in\nmoney in London, and if it should have been asked all the soldiers in\nthe regiment which of them would go to Flanders a private sentinel if\nthey had \u00c2\u00a3100 in their pockets, I believe none of them would answer in\nthe affirmative--\u00c2\u00a3100 being at that time sufficient to buy colours in\nany new regiment, though not in that regiment, which was on an old\nestablishment. This whetted my ambition, and I dreamt of nothing but\nbeing a gentleman officer, as well as a gentleman soldier.\n\nThese two circumstances concurring, I began to be very uneasy, and\nvery unwilling in my thoughts to go over a poor musqueteer into\nFlanders, to be knocked on the head at the tune of 3s. 6d. a week.\nWhile I was daily musing on the circumstances of being sent away, as\nabove, and considering what to do, my captain comes to me one evening:\n\"Hark ye, Jacque,\" says he, \"I must speak with you; let us take a walk\nin the fields a little out from the houses.\" We were quartered at a\nplace called Park End, near the town of Dunbar, about twenty miles\nfrom Berwick-upon-Tweed, and about sixteen miles from the river Tweed,\nthe nearest way.\n\nWe walked together here, and talked seriously upon the matter. The\ncaptain told me how his case stood, and that he durst not march with\nthe battalion into Newcastle; that if he did he should be taken out of\nthe ranks and tried for his life, and that I knew as well as he. \"I\ncould go privately to Newcastle,\" says he, \"and go through the town\nwell enough, but to go publicly is to run into the jaws of\ndestruction.\" \"Well,\" says I, \"that is very true; but what will you\ndo?\" \"Do!\" says he. \"Do you think I am so bound by honour, as a\ngentleman soldier, that I will be hanged for them? No, no,\" says he;\n\"I am resolved to be gone, and I would have you go with us.\" Said I,\n\"What do you mean by us?\" \"Why, here is another honest fellow, an\nEnglishman also,\" says he, \"that is resolved to desert too, and he has\nbeen a long while in their service, and says he knows how we shall be\nused abroad, and he will not go to Flanders, says he, not he.\"\n\n\"Why,\" says I, \"you will be shot to death for deserters if you are\ntaken, and they will send out scouts for you in the morning all over\nthe country, so that you will certainly fall into their hands.\" \"As\nfor that,\" says he, \"my comrade is thoroughly acquainted with the way,\nand he has undertaken to bring us to the banks of the Tweed before\nthey can come up with us; and when we are on the other side of the\nTweed, they can't take us up.\"\n\n\"And when would you go away?\" says I.\n\n\"This minute,\" says he; \"no time to be lost; 'tis a fine moonshining\nnight.\"\n\n\"I have none of my baggage,\" says I; \"let me go back and fetch my\nlinen and other things.\"\n\n\"Your linen is not much, I suppose,\" says he, \"and we shall easily get\nmore in England the old way.\"\n\n\"No,\" says I, \"no more of your old ways. It has been owing to those\nold ways that we are now in such a strait.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" says he, \"the old ways are better than this starving\nlife of a gentleman, as we call it.\"\n\n\"But,\" says I, \"we have no money in our pockets. How shall we travel?\"\n\n\"I have a little,\" says the captain, \"enough to help us on to\nNewcastle; and if we can get none by the way, we will get some\ncollier-ship to take us in and carry us to London by sea.\"\n\n\"I like that the best of all the measures you have laid yet,\" said I;\nand so I consented to go, and went off with him immediately. The\ncunning rogue, having lodged his comrade a mile off under the hills,\nhad dragged me by talking with him, by little and little, that way,\ntill just when I consented he was in sight, and he said, \"Look,\nthere's my comrade!\" who I knew presently, having seen him among the\nmen.\n\nBeing thus gotten under the hills, and a mile off the way, and the day\njust shut in, we kept on apace, resolving, if possible, to get out of\nthe reach of our pursuers before they should miss us or know anything\nof our being gone.\n\nWe plied our time so well and travelled so hard that by five o'clock\nin the morning, we were at a little village whose name I forget; but\nthey told us that we were within eight miles of the Tweed, and that as\nsoon as we should be over the river we were on English ground.\n\nWe refreshed a little here, but marched on with but little stay.\nHowever, it was half-an-hour past eight in the morning before we\nreached the Tweed, so it was at least twelve miles, when they told us\nit was but eight. Here we overtook two more of the same regiment, who\nhad deserted from Haddington, where another part of the recruits were\nquartered.\n\nThose were Scotchmen, and very poor, having not one penny in their\npockets, and had no more when they made their escape but 8s. between\nthem. And when they saw us, whom they knew to be of the same regiment\nthey took us to be pursuers, and that we came to lay hold of them;\nupon which they stood upon their defence, having the regiment swords\non, as we had also, but none of the mounting or clothing; for we were\nnot to receive the clothing till we came to the regiment in Flanders.\n\nIt was not long before we made them understand that we were in the\nsame circumstances with themselves, and so we soon became one company;\nand after resting some time on the English side of the river (for we\nwere heartily tired, and the others were as much fatigued as we\nwere)--I say, after resting awhile, we set forwards towards Newcastle,\nwhither we resolved to go to get our passage by sea to London; for we\nhad not money to hold us out any farther.\n\nOur money was ebbed very low; for though I had one piece of gold in my\npocket, which I kept reserved for the last extremity, yet it was but\nhalf-a-guinea, and my captain had bore all our charges as far as his\nmoney would go, so that when we came to Newcastle we had but sixpence\nleft in all to help ourselves, and the two Scots had begged their way\nall along the road.\n\nWe contrived to come into Newcastle in the dusk of the evening, and\neven then we durst not venture into the public part of the town, but\nmade down towards the river, something below the town, where some\nglass-houses stand. Here we knew not what to do with ourselves; but,\nguided by our fate, we put a good face upon the matter, and went into\nan alehouse, sat down, and called for a pint of beer.\n\nThe house was kept by a woman only--that is to say, we saw no other;\nand as she appeared very frank and entertained us cheerfully, we at\nlast told our condition, and asked her if she could not help us to\nsome kind master of a collier that would give us a passage to London\nby sea. The subtle devil, who immediately found us proper fish for her\nhook, gave us the kindest words in the world, and told us she was\nheartily sorry she had not seen us one day sooner; that there was a\ncollier-master, of her particular acquaintance, that went away but\nwith the morning tide; that the ship was fallen down to Shields, but\nshe believed was hardly over the bar yet, and she would send to his\nhouse and see if he was gone on board; for sometimes the masters do\nnot go away till a tide after the ship, and she was sure, if he was\nnot gone, she could prevail with him to take us all in; but then she\nwas afraid we must go on board immediately, the same night.\n\nWe begged her to send to his house, for we knew not what to do, and if\nshe could oblige him to take us on board, we did not care what time of\nnight it was; for, as we had no money, we had no lodging, and we\nwanted nothing but to be on board.\n\nWe looked upon this as a mighty favour, that she sent to the master's\nhouse, and, to our greater joy, she brought us word about an hour\nafter that he was not gone, and was at a tavern in the town, whither\nhis boy had been to fetch him, and that he had sent word he would call\nthere in the way home.\n\nThis was all in our favour, and we were extremely pleased with it.\nAbout an hour after, the landlady being in the room with us, her maid\nbrings us word the master was below. So down she goes to him, telling\nus she would go and tell him our case, and see to persuade him to take\nus all on board. After some time she comes up with him, and brings him\ninto the room to us. \"Where are these honest gentlemen soldiers,\" says\nhe, \"that are in such distress?\" We stood all up, and paid our\nrespects to him. \"Well, gentlemen, and is all your money spent?\"\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" said one of our company, \"and we shall be infinitely\nobliged to you, sir, if you will give us a passage. We will be very\nwilling to do anything we can in the ship, though we are not seamen.\"\n\n\"Why,\" says he, \"were none of you ever at sea in your lives?\"\n\n\"No,\" says we, \"not one of us.\"\n\n\"You will be able to do me no service, then,\" says he; \"for you will\nbe all sick. Well, however,\" says he, \"for my good landlady's sake\nhere, I'll do it; but are you all ready to go on board, for I go on\nboard this very night?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" says we again; \"we are ready to go this minute.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" says he very kindly; \"we'll drink together. Come, landlady,\"\nsays he, \"make these honest gentlemen a sneaker of punch.\"\n\nWe looked at one another, for we knew we had no money, and he\nperceived it. \"Come, come,\" says he, \"don't be concerned at your\nhaving no money; my landlady here and I never part with dry lips.\nCome, goodwife,\" says he, \"make the punch as I bid you.\"\n\nWe thanked him and said, \"God bless you, noble captain,\" a hundred\ntimes over, being overjoyed with such good luck. While we were\ndrinking the punch he calls the landlady: \"Come,\" says he, \"I'll step\nhome and take my things, and bid them good-bye, and order the boat to\ncome at high water and take me up here. And pray, goodwife,\" says he,\n\"get me something for supper. Sure, if I can give these honest men\ntheir passage, I may give them a bit of victuals too; it may be they\nhan't had much for dinner.\"\n\nWith this away he went, and in a little while we heard the jack\na-going; and one of us, going down stairs for a spy, brought us word\nthere was a good leg of mutton at the fire. In less than an hour our\ncaptain came again, and came up to us, and blamed us that we had not\ndrank all the punch out. \"Come,\" says he, \"don't be bashful; when that\nis out we can have another. When I am obliging poor men, I love to do\nit handsomely.\"\n\nWe drank on, and drank the punch out, and more was brought up, and he\npushed it about apace; and then came up a leg of mutton, and I need\nnot say that we ate heartily, being told several times that we should\npay nothing. After supper was done he bids my landlady ask if the boat\nwas come. And she brought word no; it was not high water by a good\ndeal. \"No!\" says he. \"Well, then, give us some more punch.\" So more\npunch was brought in, and, as was afterwards confessed, something was\nput into it, or more brandy than ordinary, and by that time the punch\nwas drunk out we were all very drunk; and as for me, I was asleep.\n\nAbout the time that was out we were told the boat was come; so we\ntumbled out, almost over one another, into the boat, and away we went,\nand our captain in the boat. Most of us, if not all, fell asleep, till\nafter some time, though how much or how far going we knew not, the\nboat stopped, and we were waked and told we were at the ship's side,\nwhich was true; and with much help and holding us, for fear we should\nfall overboard, we were all gotten into the ship. All I remember of it\nwas this, that as soon as we were on board our captain, as we called\nhim, called out thus: \"Here, boatswain, take care of these gentlemen,\nand give them good cabins, and let them turn in and go to sleep, for\nthey are very weary;\" and so indeed we were, and very drunk too, being\nthe first time I had ever drank punch in my life.\n\nWell, care was taken of us according to order, and we were put into\nvery good cabins, where we were sure to go immediately to sleep. In\nthe meantime the ship, which was indeed just ready to go, and only on\nnotice given had come to an anchor for us at Shields, weighed, stood\nover the bar, and went off to sea; and when we waked, and began to\npeep abroad, which was not till near noon the next day, we found\nourselves a great way at sea; the land in sight, indeed, but at a\ngreat distance, and all going merrily on for London, as we understood\nit. We were very well used and well satisfied with our condition for\nabout three days, when we began to inquire whether we were not almost\ncome, and how much longer it would be before we should come into the\nriver. \"What river?\" says one of the men. \"Why, the Thames,\" says my\nCaptain Jacque. \"The Thames!\" says the seaman. \"What do you mean by\nthat? What, han't you had time enough to be sober yet?\" So Captain\nJacque said no more, but looked about him like a fool; when, a while\nafter, some other of us asked the like question, and the seaman, who\nknew nothing of the cheat, began to smell a trick, and turning to the\nother Englishman that came with us, \"Pray,\" says he, \"where do you\nfancy you are going, that you ask so often about it?\" \"Why, to\nLondon,\" says he. \"Where should we be going? We agreed with the\ncaptain to carry us to London.\" \"Not with the captain,\" says he, \"I\ndare say. Poor men! you are all cheated; and I thought so when I saw\nyou come aboard with that kidnapping rogue Gilliman. Poor men!\" adds\nhe, \"you are all be trayed. Why, you are going to Virginia, and the\nship is bound to Virginia.\"\n\nThe Englishman falls a-storming and raving like a madman, and we\ngathering round him, let any man guess, if they can, what was our\nsurprise and how we were confounded when we were told how it was. In\nshort, we drew our swords and began to lay about us, and made such a\nnoise and hurry in the ship that at last the seamen were obliged to\ncall out for help. The captain commanded us to be disarmed in the\nfirst place, which was not, however, done without giving and receiving\nsome wounds, and afterwards he caused us to be brought to him into the\ngreat cabin.\n\nHere he talked very calmly to us, that he was really very sorry for\nwhat had befallen us; that he perceived we had been trepanned, and\nthat the fellow who had brought us on board was a rogue that was\nemployed by a sort of wicked merchants not unlike himself; that he\nsupposed he had been represented to us as captain of the ship, and\nasked us if it was not so. We told him yes, and gave him a large\naccount of ourselves, and how we came to the woman's house to inquire\nfor some master of a collier to get a passage to London, and that this\nman engaged to carry us to London in his own ship, and the like, as is\nrelated above.\n\nHe told us he was very sorry for it, and he had no hand in it; but it\nwas out of his power to help us, and let us know very plainly what our\ncondition was; namely, that we were put on board his ship as servants\nto be delivered at Maryland to such a man, whom he named to us; but\nthat, however, if we would be quiet and orderly in the ship, he would\nuse us well in the passage, and take care we should be used well when\nwe came there, and that he would do anything for us that lay in his\npower; but if we were unruly and refractory, we could not expect but\nhe must take such measures as to oblige us to be satisfied; and that,\nin short, we must be handcuffed, carried down between the decks and\nkept as prisoners, for it was his business to take care that no\ndisturbance must be in the ship.\n\nMy captain raved like a madman, swore at the captain, told him he\nwould not fail to cut his throat, either on board or ashore, whenever\nhe came within his reach; and that, if he could not do it now, he\nwould do it after he came to England again, if ever he durst show his\nface there again. For he might depend upon it, if he was carried away\nto Virginia, he should find his way to England again; that, if it was\ntwenty years after, he would have satisfaction of him. \"Well, young\nman,\" says the captain, smiling, \"'tis very honestly said, and then I\nmust take care of you while I have you here, and afterwards I must\ntake care of myself.\" \"Do your worst,\" says Jacque boldly; \"I'll pay\nyou home for it one time or other.\" \"I must venture that, young man,\"\nsays he, still calmly, \"but for the present you and I must talk a\nlittle;\" so he bids the boatswain, who stood near him, secure him,\nwhich he did. I spoke to him to be easy and patient, and that the\ncaptain had no hand in our misfortune.\n\n\"No hand in it! D--n him,\" said he aloud, \"do you think he is not\nconfederate in this villainy? Would any honest man receive innocent\npeople on board his ship and not inquire of their circumstances, but\ncarry them away and not speak to them? And now he knows how\nbarbarously we are treated, why does he not set us on shore again? I\ntell you he is a villain, and none but him. Why does he not complete\nhis villainy and murder us, and then he will be free from our revenge?\nBut nothing else shall ever deliver him from my hands but sending us\nto the d--l, or going thither himself; and I am honester in telling\nhim so fairly than he has been to me, and am in no passion any more\nthan he is.\"\n\nThe captain was, I say, a little shocked at his boldness, for he\ntalked a great deal more of the same kind, with a great deal of spirit\nand fire, and yet without any disorder in his temper. Indeed I was\nsurprised at it, for I never had heard him talk so well and so much to\nthe purpose in my life. The captain was, I say, a little shocked at\nit. However, he talked very handsomely to him, and said to him, \"Look\nye, young man, I bear with you the more because I am sensible your\ncase is very hard; and yet I cannot allow your threatening me neither,\nand you oblige me by that to be severer with you than I intended.\nHowever, I will do nothing to you but what your threatening my life\nmakes necessary.\" The boatswain called out to have him to the geers,\nas they called it, and to have him taste the cat-o'-nine-tails--all\nwhich were terms we did not understand till afterwards, when we were\ntold he should have been whipped and pickled, for they said it was not\nto be suffered. But the captain said, \"No, no; the young man has been\nreally injured, and has reason to be very much provoked; but I have\nnot injured him,\" says he. And then he protested he had no hand in it,\nthat he was put on board, and we also, by the owner's agent, and for\ntheir account; that it was true that they did always deal in servants,\nand carried a great many every voyage, but that it was no profit to\nhim as commander; but they were always put on board by the owners, and\nthat it was none of his business to inquire about them; and, to prove\nthat he was not concerned in it, but was very much troubled at so base\na thing, and that he would not be instrumental to carry us away\nagainst our wills, if the wind and the weather would permit, he would\nset us on shore again, though, as it blowed then, the wind being at\nsouth-west and a hard gale, and that they were already as far as the\nOrkneys, it was impossible.\n\nBut the captain was the same man. He told him that, let the wind blow\nhow it would, he ought not to carry us away against our consent; and\nas to his pretences of his owners and the like, it was saying of\nnothing to him, for it was he, the captain, that carried us away, and\nthat, whatever rogue trepanned us on board, now he knew it, he ought\nno more to carry us away than murder us; and that he demanded to be\nset on shore, or else he, the captain, was a thief and a murderer.\n\nThe captain continued mild still; and then I put in with an argument\nthat had like to have brought us all back, if the weather had not\nreally hindered it; which, when I came to understand sea affairs\nbetter, I found was indeed so, and that it had been impossible. I told\nthe captain that I was sorry that my brother was so warm, but that our\nusage was villainous, which he could not deny. Then I took up the air\nof what my habit did not agree with. I told him that we were not\npeople to be sold for slaves, that though we had the misfortune to be\nin a circumstance that obliged us to conceal ourselves, having\ndisguised ourselves to get out of the army, as being not willing to go\ninto Flanders, yet that we were men of substance, and able to\ndischarge ourselves from the service when it came to that; and, to\nconvince him of it, I told him I would give him sufficient security to\npay \u00c2\u00a320 apiece for my brother and myself; and in as short time as we\ncould send from the place he should put into London, and receive a\nreturn. And, to show that I was able to do it, I pulled out my bill\nfor \u00c2\u00a394 from the gentleman of the custom-house, and who, to my\ninfinite satisfaction, he knew as soon as he saw the bill. He was\nastonished at this, and, lifting up his hands, \"By what witchcraft,\"\nsays he, \"were ye brought hither!\"\n\n\"As to that,\" says I, \"we have told you the story, and we add nothing\nto it; but we insist upon it that you will do this justice to us now.\"\n\"Well,\" says he, \"I am very sorry for it, but I cannot answer putting\nback the ship; neither, if I could,\" says he, \"is it practicable to be\ndone.\"\n\nWhile this discourse lasted the two Scotchmen and the other Englishman\nwere silent; but as I seemed to acquiesce, the Scotchmen began to talk\nto the same purpose, which I need not repeat, and had not mentioned\nbut for a merry passage that followed. After the Scotchmen had\nsaid all they could, and the captain still told them they must\nsubmit,--\"And will you then carry us to Virginia?\" \"Yes,\" says the\ncaptain. \"And will we be sold,\" says the Scotchman, \"when we come\nthere?\" \"Yes,\" says the captain. \"Why then, sir,\" says the Scotchman,\n\"the devil will have you at the hinder end of the bargain.\" \"Say you\nso,\" says the captain, smiling. \"Well, well, let the devil and I alone\nto agree about that; do you be quiet and behave civilly, as you should\ndo, and you shall be used as kindly, both here and there too, as I\ncan.\" The poor Scotchmen could say little to it, nor I, nor any of us;\nfor we saw there was no remedy but to leave the devil and the captain\nto agree among themselves, as the captain had said, as to the honesty\nof it.\n\nThus, in short, we were all, I say, obliged to acquiesce but my\ncaptain, who was so much the more obstinate when he found that I had a\nfund to make such an offer upon; nor could all my persuasions prevail\nwith him. The captain of the ship and he had many pleasant dialogues\nabout this in the rest of the voyage, in which Jacque never treated\nhim with any language but that of kidnapper and villain, nor talked of\nanything but of taking his revenge of him. But I omit that part,\nthough very diverting, as being no part of my own story.\n\nIn short, the wind continued to blow hard, though very fair, till, as\nthe seamen said, we were past the islands on the north of Scotland,\nand that we began to steer away westerly (which I came to understand\nsince). As there was no land any way for many hundred leagues, so we\nhad no remedy but patience, and to be easy as we could; only my surly\nCaptain Jacque continued the same man all the way.\n\nWe had a very good voyage, no storms all the way, and a northerly wind\nalmost twenty days together; so that, in a word, we made the capes of\nVirginia in two-and-thirty days from the day we steered west, as I\nhave said, which was in the latitude of 60 degrees 30 minutes, being\nto the north of the isle of Great Britain; and this, they said, was a\nvery quick passage.\n\nNothing material happened to me during the voyage; and indeed, when I\ncame there, I was obliged to act in so narrow a compass that nothing\nvery material could present itself.\n\nWhen we came ashore, which was in a great river which they call\nPotomac, the captain asked us, but me more particularly, whether I had\nanything to propose to him now. Jacque answered, \"Yes, I have\nsomething to propose to you, captain; that is, that I have promised\nyou to cut your throat, and depend upon it I will be as good as my\nword.\" \"Well, well,\" says the captain, \"if I can't help it, you\nshall;\" so he turned away to me. I understood him very well what he\nmeant; but I was now out of the reach of any relief; and as for my\nnote, it was now but a bit of paper of no value, for nobody could\nreceive it but myself. I saw no remedy, and so talked coldly to him of\nit as of a thing I was indifferent about; and indeed I was grown\nindifferent, for I considered all the way on the voyage, that as I was\nbred a vagabond, had been a pickpocket and a soldier, and was run from\nmy colours, and that I had no settled abode in the world, nor any\nemploy to get anything by, except that wicked one I was bred to, which\nhad the gallows at the heels of it, I did not see but that this\nservice might be as well to me as other business. And this I was\nparticularly satisfied with when they told me that after I had served\nout the five years' servitude I should have the courtesy of the\ncountry (as they called it); that is, a certain quantity of land to\ncultivate and plant for myself. So that now I was like to be brought\nup to something by which I might live, without that wretched thing\ncalled stealing, which my very soul abhorred, and which I had given\nover, as I have said, ever since that wicked time that I robbed the\npoor widow of Kentish Town.\n\nIn this mind I was when I arrived at Virginia; and so, when the\ncaptain inquired of me what I intended to do, and whether I had\nanything to propose--that is to say, he meant whether I would give him\nmy bill, which he wanted to be fingering very much--I answered coldly,\nmy bill would be of no use to me now, for nobody would advance\nanything upon it. Only this I would say to him, that if he would carry\nme and Captain Jacque back to England, and to London again, I would\npay him the \u00c2\u00a320 off my bill for each of us. This he had no mind to;\n\"for, as to your brother,\" says he, \"I would not take him into my ship\nfor twice \u00c2\u00a320, he is such a hardened, desperate villain,\" says he; \"I\nshould be obliged to carry him in irons as I brought him hither.\"\n\nThus we parted with our captain or kidnapper, call him as you will. We\nwere then delivered to the merchants to whom we were consigned, who\nagain disposed of us as they thought fit; and in a few days we were\nseparated.\n\nAs for my Captain Jacque, to make short of the story, that desperate\nrogue had the luck to have a very easy, good master, whose easiness\nand good humour he abused very much; and, in particular, took an\nopportunity to run away with a boat which his master entrusted him and\nanother with to carry some provisions down the river to another\nplantation which he had there. This boat and provisions they ran away\nwith, and sailed north to the bottom of the bay, as they call it, and\ninto a river called Susquehanna, and there quitting the boat, they\nwandered through the woods, till they came to Pennsylvania, from\nwhence they made shift to get passage to New England, and from thence\nhome; where, falling in among his old companions and to the old trade,\nhe was at length taken and hanged, about a month before I came to\nLondon, which was near twenty years afterwards.\n\nMy part was harder at the beginning, though better at the latter\nend. I was disposed of, that is to say, sold, to a rich planter\nwhose name was Smith, and with me the other Englishman, who was my\nfellow-deserter, that Jacque brought me to when we went off from\nDunbar.\n\nWe were now fellow-servants, and it was our lot to be carried up a\nsmall river or creek which falls into Potomac river, about eight miles\nfrom the great river. Here we were brought to the plantation, and put\nin among about fifty servants, as well negroes as others; and being\ndelivered to the head man, or director, or manager of the plantation,\nhe took care to let us know that we must expect to work, and very hard\ntoo; for it was for that purpose his master bought servants, and for\nno other. I told him, very submissively, that since it was our\nmisfortune to come into such a miserable condition as we were in, we\nexpected no other; only we desired we might be showed our business,\nand be allowed to learn it gradually, since he might be sure we had\nnot been used to labour; and I added that when he knew particularly by\nwhat methods we were brought and betrayed into such a condition, he\nwould perhaps see cause at least to show us that favour, if not more.\nThis I spoke with such a moving tone as gave him a curiosity to\ninquire into the particulars of our story, which I gave him at large,\na little more to our advantage, too, than ordinary.\n\nThis story, as I hoped it would, did move him to a sort of tenderness;\nbut yet he told us that his master's business must be done, and that\nhe expected we must work as above; that he could not dispense with\nthat upon any account whatever. Accordingly, to work we went; and\nindeed we had three hard things attending us; namely, we worked hard,\nlodged hard, and fared hard. The first I had been an utter stranger\nto; the last I could shift well enough with.\n\nDuring this scene of life I had time to reflect on my past hours, and\nupon what I had done in the world; and though I had no great capacity\nof making a clear judgment, and very little reflections from\nconscience, yet it made some impressions upon me; and particularly,\nthat I was brought into this miserable condition of a slave by some\nstrange directing power as a punishment for the wickedness of my\nyounger years; and this thought was increased upon the following\noccasion. The master whose service I was now engaged in was a man of\nsubstance and figure in the country, and had abundance of servants, as\nwell negroes as English; in all, I think, he had near two hundred; and\namong so many, as some grew every year infirm and unable to work,\nothers went off upon their time being expired, and others died; and by\nthese and other accidents the number would diminish, if they were not\noften recruited and filled, and this obliged him to buy more every\nyear.\n\nIt happened while I was here that a ship arrived from London with\nseveral servants, and among the rest was seventeen transported felons,\nsome burnt in the hand, others not; eight of whom my master bought for\nthe time specified in the warrant for their transportation\nrespectively, some for a longer, some a shorter, term of years.\n\nOur master was a great man in the country, and a justice of peace,\nthough he seldom came down to the plantation where I was. Yet, as the\nnew servants were brought on shore and delivered at our plantation,\nhis worship came thither, in a kind of state, to see and receive them.\nWhen they were brought before him I was called, among other servants,\nas a kind of guard, to take them into custody after he had seen them,\nand carry them to the work. They were brought by a guard of seamen\nfrom the ship, and the second mate of the ship came with them, and\ndelivered them to our master, with the warrant for their\ntransportation, as above.\n\nWhen his worship had read over the warrants, he called them over by\ntheir names, one by one, and having let them know, by his reading the\nwarrants over again to each man respectively, that he knew for what\noffences they were transported, he talked to every one separately very\ngravely; let them know how much favour they had received in being\nsaved from the gallows, which the law had appointed for their crimes;\nthat they were not sentenced to be transported, but to be hanged, and\nthat transportation was granted them upon their own request and humble\npetition.\n\nThen he laid before them that they ought to look upon the life they\nwere just going to enter upon as just beginning the world again; that\nif they thought fit to be diligent and sober, they would, after the\ntime they were ordered to serve was expired, be encouraged by the\nconstitution of the country to settle and plant for themselves; and\nthat even he himself would be so kind to them, that if he lived to see\nany of them serve their time faithfully out, it was his custom to\nassist his servants in order to their settling in that country,\naccording as their behaviour might merit from him; and they would see\nand know several planters round about them who now were in very good\ncircumstances, and who formerly were only his servants, in the same\ncondition with them, and came from the same place--that is to say,\nNewgate; and some of them had the mark of it in their hands, but were\nnow very honest men and lived in very good repute.\n\nAmong the rest of his new servants, he came to a young fellow not\nabove seventeen or eighteen years of age, and his warrant mentions\nthat he was, though a young man, yet an old offender; that he had been\nseveral times condemned, but had been respited or pardoned, but still\nhe continued an incorrigible pickpocket; that the crime for which he\nwas now transported was for picking a merchant's pocket-book, or\nletter-case, out of his pocket, in which was bills of exchange for a\nvery great sum of money; that he had afterwards received the money\nupon some of the bills, but that going to a goldsmith in Lombard\nStreet with another bill, and having demanded the money, he was\nstopped, notice having been given of the loss of them; that he was\ncondemned to die for the felony, and being so well known for an old\noffender, had certainly died, but the merchant, upon his earnest\napplication, had obtained that he should be transported, on condition\nthat he restored all the rest of his bills, which he had done\naccordingly.\n\nOur master talked a long time to this young fellow; mentioned, with\nsome surprise, that he so young should have followed such a wicked\ntrade so long as to obtain the name of an old offender at so young an\nage; and that he should be styled incorrigible, which is to signify\nthat notwithstanding his being whipped two or three times, and several\ntimes punished by imprisonment, and once burnt in the hand, yet\nnothing would do him any good, but that he was still the same. He\ntalked mighty religiously to this boy, and told him God had not only\nspared him from the gallows, but had now mercifully delivered him from\nthe opportunity of committing the same sin again, and put it into his\npower to live an honest life, which perhaps he knew not how to do\nbefore; and though some part of his life now might be laborious, yet\nhe ought to look on it to be no more than being put out apprentice to\nan honest trade, in which, when he came out of his time, he might be\nable to set up for himself and live honestly.\n\nThen he told him that while he was a servant he would have no\nopportunity to be dishonest; so when he came to be for himself he\nwould have no temptation to it; and so, after a great many other kind\nthings said to him and the rest, they were dismissed.\n\nI was exceedingly moved at this discourse of our master's, as anybody\nwould judge I must be, when it was directed to such a young rogue,\nborn a thief, and bred up a pickpocket, like myself; for I thought all\nmy master said was spoken to me, and sometimes it came into my head\nthat sure my master was some extraordinary man, and he knew all things\nthat ever I had done in my life.\n\nBut I was surprised to the last degree when my master, dismissing\nall the rest of us servants, pointed at me, and speaking to his\nhead-clerk, \"Here,\" says he, \"bring that young fellow hither to me.\"\n\nI had been near a year in the work, and I had plied it so well that\nthe clerk, or headman, either flattered me or did really believe that\nI behaved very well. But I was terribly frighted to hear myself called\nout aloud, just as they used to call for such as had done some\nmisdemeanour, and were to be lashed or otherwise corrected.\n\nI came in like a malefactor indeed, and thought I looked like one just\ntaken in the fact and carried before the justice; and indeed when I\ncame in, for I was carried into an inner room or parlour in the house\nto him (his discourse to the rest was in a large hall, where he sat in\na seat like a lord judge upon the bench, or a petty king upon his\nthrone); when I came in, I say, he ordered his man to withdraw, and I\nstanding half naked and bare-headed, with my haugh, or hoe, in my hand\n(the posture and figure I was in at my work), near the door, he bade\nme lay down my hoe and come nearer. Then he began to look a little\nless stern and terrible than I fancied him to look before, or,\nperhaps, both his countenance then and before might be to my\nimagination differing from what they really were; for we do not always\njudge those things by the real temper of the person, but by the\nmeasure of our apprehensions.\n\n\"Hark ye, young man, how old are you?\" says my master; and so our\ndialogue began.\n\n_Jacque_. Indeed, sir, I do not know.\n\n_Mast_. What is your name?\n\n_Jacque_. They call me Colonel[4] here, but my name is Jacque, an't\nplease your worship.\n\n_Mast_. But prithee, what is thy name?\n\n_Jacque_. Jacque.\n\n_Mast_. What! is thy Christian name, then, Colonel, and thy surname\nJacque?\n\n_Jacque_. Truly, sir, to tell your honour the truth, I know little or\nnothing of myself,[5] nor what my true name is; but thus I have been\ncalled ever since I remember. Which is my Christian name, or which my\nsurname, or whether I was ever christened or not, I cannot tell.\n\n_Mast_. Well, however, that's honestly answered. Pray, how came you\nhither, and on what account are you made a servant here?\n\n_Jacque_. I wish your honour could have patience with me to hear the\nwhole story; it is the hardest and most unjust thing that ever came\nbefore you.\n\n_Mast_. Say you so? Tell it me at large, then. I'll hear it, I promise\nthat, if it be an hour long.\n\nThis encouraged me, and I began at being a soldier, and being\npersuaded to desert at Dunbar, and gave him all the particulars, as\nthey are related above, to the time of my coming on shore and the\ncaptain talking to me about my bill after I arrived here. He held up\nhis hands several times as I went on, expressing his abhorrence of the\nusage I had met with at Newcastle, and inquired the name of the master\nof the ship; \"for,\" said he, \"that captain, for all his smooth words,\nmust be a rogue.\" So I told him his name, and the name of the ship,\nand he took it down in his book, and then he went on.\n\n_Mast_. But pray answer me, honestly too, to another question: What\nwas it made you so much concerned at my talking to the boy there, the\npickpocket?\n\n_Jacque_. An't please your honour, it moved me to hear you talk so\nkindly to a poor slave.\n\n_Mast_. And was that all? Speak truly now.\n\n_Jacque_. No, indeed; but a secret wish came into my thoughts, that\nyou, that were so good to such a creature as that, could but one way\nor other know my case, and that if you did, you would certainly pity\nme, and do something for me.\n\n_Mast_. Well, but was there nothing in his case that hit your own,\nthat made you so affected with it; for I saw tears come from your eyes\nand it was that made me call to speak to you?\n\n_Jacque_. Indeed, sir, I have been a wicked, idle boy, and was left\ndesolate in the world; but that boy is a thief, and condemned to be\nhanged. I never was before a court of justice in my life.\n\n_Mast_. Well, I won't examine you too far. If you were never before a\ncourt of justice, and are not a criminal transported, I have nothing\nfurther to inquire of you. You have been ill used, that's certain; and\nwas it that that affected you?\n\n_Jacque_. Yes, indeed, please your honour. (We all called him his\nhonour, or his worship.)\n\n_Mast_. Well, now I do know your case, what can I do for you? You\nspeak of a bill of \u00c2\u00a394 of which you would have given the captain \u00c2\u00a340\nfor your liberty; have you that bill in your keeping still?\n\n_Jacque_. Yes, sir; here it is.\n\nI pulled it out of the waistband of my drawers, where I always found\nmeans to preserve it, wrapped up in a piece of paper, and pinned to\nthe waistband, and yet almost worn out, too, with often pinning and\nremoving. So I gave it to him to read, and he read it.\n\n_Mast_. And is this gentleman in being that gave you the bill?\n\n_Jacque_. Yes, sir; he was alive and in good health when I came from\nLondon, which you may see by the date of the bill, for I came away the\nnext day.\n\n_Mast_. I do not wonder that the captain of the ship was willing to\nget this bill of you when you came on shore here.\n\n_Jacque_. I would have given it into his possession if he would have\ncarried me and my brother back again to England, and have taken what\nhe asked for us out of it.\n\n_Mast_. Ay; but he knew better than that, too. He knew, if he had any\nfriends there, they would call him to an account for what he had done.\nBut I wonder he did not take it from you while you were at sea, either\nby fraud or by force.\n\n_Jacque_. He did not attempt that indeed.\n\n_Mast_. Well, young man, I have a mind to try if I can do you any\nservice in this case. On my word, if the money can be paid, and you\ncan get it safe over, I might put you in a way how to be a better man\nthan your master, if you will be honest and diligent.\n\n_Jacque_. As I have behaved myself in your service, sir, you will, I\nhope, judge of the rest.\n\n_Mast_. But perhaps you hanker after returning to England?\n\n_Jacque_. No, indeed, sir; if I can but get my bread honestly here, I\nhave no mind to go to England; for I know not how to get my bread\nthere. If I had, I had not 'listed for a soldier.\n\n_Mast_. Well, but I must ask you some questions about that part\nhereafter; for 'tis indeed something strange that you should list for\na soldier when you had \u00c2\u00a394 in your pocket.\n\n_Jacque_. I shall give your worship as particular account of that as I\nhave of the other part of my life, if you please; but 'tis very long.\n\n_Mast_. Well, we will have that another time. But to the case in hand.\nAre you willing I should send to anybody at London to talk with that\ngentleman that gave you the bill; not to take the money of him, but to\nask him only whether he has so much money of yours in his hands, and\nwhether he will part with it when you shall give order, and send the\nbill, or a duplicate of it; that is (says he) the copy? (And it was\nwell he did say so, for I did not understand the word duplicate at\nall.)\n\n_Jacque_. Yes, sir; I will give you the bill itself, if you please. I\ncan trust it with you, though I could not with him.\n\n_Mast_. No, no, young man, I won't take it from you.\n\n_Jacque_. I wish your worship would please to keep it for me, for if I\nshould lose it, then I am quite undone.\n\n_Mast_. I will keep it for you, Jacque, if you will; but then you\nshall have a note under my hand, signifying that I have it, and will\nreturn it you upon demand, which will be as safe to you as the bill. I\nwon't take it else.\n\nSo I gave my master the bill, and he gave me his note for it; and he\nwas a faithful steward for me, as you will hear in its place. After\nthis conference I was dismissed, and went to my work; but about two\nhours after, the steward, or the overseer of the plantation, came\nriding by, and coming up to me as I was at work, pulled a bottle out\nof his pocket, and calling me to him, gave me a dram of rum. When, in\ngood manners, I had taken but a little sup, he held it out to me\nagain, and bade me take another, and spoke wondrous civilly to me,\nquite otherwise than he used to do.\n\nThis encouraged me and heartened me very much, but yet I had no\nparticular view of anything, or which way I should have any relief.\n\nA day or two after, when we were all going out to our work in the\nmorning, the overseer called me to him again, and gave me a dram and a\ngood piece of bread, and bade me come off from my work about one\no'clock, and come to him to the house, for he must speak with me.\n\nWhen I came to him, I came, to be sure, in the ordinary habit of a\npoor half-naked slave. \"Come hither, young man,\" says he, \"and give me\nyour hoe.\" When I gave it him, \"Well,\" says he, \"you are to work no\nmore in this plantation.\"\n\nI looked surprised, and as if I was frighted. \"What have I done, sir?\"\nsaid I; \"and whither am I to be sent away?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" says he, and looked very pleasantly, \"do not be frighted;\n'tis for your good; 'tis not to hurt you. I am ordered to make an\noverseer of you, and you shall be a slave no longer.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" says I to him, \"I an overseer! I am in no condition for it. I\nhave no clothes to put on, no linen, nothing to help myself.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" says he, \"you may be better used than you are aware of.\nCome hither with me.\" So he led me into a vast, great warehouse, or,\nrather, set of warehouses, one within another, and calling the\nwarehouse-keeper, \"Here,\" says he, \"you must clothe this man, and give\nhim everything necessary, upon the foot of number five, and give the\nbill to me. Our master has ordered me to allow it in the account of\nthe west plantation.\" That was, it seems, the plantation where I was\nto go.\n\nAccordingly, the warehouse-keeper carried me into an inner warehouse,\nwhere were several suits of clothes of the sort his orders mentioned,\nwhich were plain but good sorts of clothes, ready made, being of a\ngood broadcloth, about 11s. a yard in England; and with this he gave\nme three good shirts, two pair of shoes, stockings, and gloves, a hat,\nsix neckcloths, and, in short, everything I could want; and when he\nhad looked everything out, and fitted them, he lets me into a little\nroom by itself. \"Here,\" says he; \"go in there a slave, and come out a\ngentleman;\" and with that carried everything into the room, and,\nshutting the door, bid me put them on, which I did most willingly; and\nnow you may believe that I began to hope for something better than\nordinary.\n\nIn a little while after this came the overseer, and gave me joy of my\nnew clothes, and told me I must go with him. So I was carried to\nanother plantation, larger than that where I worked before, and where\nthere were two overseers or clerks; one within doors, and one without.\nThis last was removed to another plantation, and I was placed there in\nhis room (that is to say, as the clerk without doors), and my business\nwas to look after the servants and negroes, and take care that they\ndid their business, provide their food, and, in short, both govern and\ndirect them.\n\nI was elevated to the highest degree in my thoughts at this\nadvancement, and it is impossible for me to express the joy of my mind\nupon this occasion; but there came a difficulty upon me, that shocked\nme so violently and went so against my very nature that I really had\nalmost forfeited my place about it, and, in all appearance, the favour\nof our master, who had been so generous to me; and this was, that when\nI entered upon my office, I had a horse given me and a long horsewhip,\nlike what we call in England a hunting-whip. The horse was to ride up\nand down all over the plantation, to see the servants and negroes did\ntheir work; and, the plantation being so large, it could not be done\non foot, at least so often and so effectively as was required; and the\nhorsewhip was given me to correct and lash the slaves and servants\nwhen they proved negligent or quarrelsome, or, in short, were guilty\nof any offence. This part turned the very blood within my veins, and I\ncould not think of it with any temper, that I, who was but yesterday a\nservant or slave like them, and under the authority of the same lash,\nshould lift up my hand to the cruel work which was my terror but the\nday before. This, I say, I could not do; insomuch that the negroes\nperceived it, and I had soon so much contempt upon my authority that\nwe were all in disorder.\n\nThe ingratitude of their return for the compassion I showed them\nprovoked me, I confess, and a little hardened my heart; and I began\nwith the negroes, two of whom I was obliged to correct; and I thought\nI did it most cruelly; but after I had lashed them till every blow I\nstruck them hurt myself and I was ready to faint at the work, the\nrogues laughed at me, and one of them had the impudence to say, behind\nmy back, that, if he had the whipping of me, he would show me better\nhow to whip a negro.\n\nWell, however, I had no power to do it in such a barbarous manner as I\nfound it was necessary to have it done; and the defect began to be a\ndetriment to our master's business. And now I began indeed to see that\nthe cruelty so much talked of, used in Virginia and Barbados, and\nother colonies, in whipping the negro slaves, was not so much owing to\nthe tyranny and passion and cruelty of the English, as had been\nreported, the English not being accounted to be of a cruel\ndisposition, and really are not so; but that it is owing to the\nbrutality and obstinate temper of the negroes, who cannot be managed\nby kindness and courtesy, but must be ruled with a rod of iron, beaten\nwith scorpions, as the Scripture calls it, and must be used as they do\nuse them, or they would rise and murder all their masters; which,\ntheir numbers considered, would not be hard for them to do, if they\nhad arms and ammunition suitable to the rage and cruelty of their\nnature.\n\nBut I began to see at the same time that this brutal temper of the\nnegroes was not rightly managed; that they did not take the best\ncourse with them to make them sensible, either of mercy or punishment;\nand it was evident to me that even the worst of those tempers might be\nbrought to a compliance without the lash, or at least without so much\nof it as they generally inflicted.\n\nOur master was really a man of humanity himself, and was sometimes so\nfull of tenderness that he would forbid the severities of his\noverseers and stewards; but he saw the necessity of it, and was\nobliged at last to leave it to the discretion of his upper servants.\nYet he would often bid them be merciful, and bid them consider the\ndifference of the constitution of the bodies of the negroes, some\nbeing less able to bear the tortures of their punishment than others,\nand some of them less obstinate, too, than others.\n\nHowever, somebody was so officious as to inform him against me upon\nthis occasion, and let him know that I neglected his affairs, and that\nthe servants were under no government; by which means his plantation\nwas not duly managed, and that all things were in disorder.\n\nThis was a heavy charge for a young overseer, and his honour came like\na judge, with all his attendants, to look into things and hear the\ncause. However, he was so just to me as that, before he censured me,\nhe resolved to hear me fully, and that not only publicly, but in\nprivate too. And the last part of this was my particular good fortune;\nfor, as he had formerly allowed me to speak to him with freedom, so I\nhad the like freedom now, and had full liberty to explain and defend\nmyself.\n\nI knew nothing of the complaint against me till I had it from his own\nmouth, nor anything of his coming till I saw him in the very\nplantation, viewing his work, and viewing the several pieces of ground\nthat were ordered to be new planted; and after he had rode all round,\nand seen things in the condition which they were to be seen in, how\nevery thing was in its due order, and the servants and negroes were\nall at work, and everything appearing to his mind, he went into the\nhouse.\n\nAs I saw him come up the walks I ran towards him and made my homage,\nand gave him my humble thanks for the goodness he had showed me in\ntaking me from the miserable condition I was in before, and employing\nand entrusting me in his business; and he looked pleasant enough,\nthough he did not say much at first; and I attended him through the\nwhole plantation, gave him an account of everything as we went along,\nanswered all his objections and inquiries everywhere in such a manner\nas it seems he did not expect; and, as he acknowledged afterwards,\neverything was very much to his satisfaction.\n\nThere was an overseer, as I observed, belonging to the same\nplantation, who was, though not over me, yet in a work superior to\nmine; for his business was to see the tobacco packed up and deliver it\neither on board the sloops or otherwise, as our master ordered, and to\nreceive English goods from the grand warehouse, which was at the other\nplantation, because that was nearest the water-side; and, in short, to\nkeep the accounts.\n\nThis overseer, an honest and upright man, made no complaint to him of\nhis business being neglected, as above, or of anything like it, though\nhe inquired of him about it, and that very strictly, too.\n\nI should have said, that as he rid over the plantation, he came in his\nround to the place where the servants were usually corrected when they\nhad done any fault; and there stood two negroes, with their hands tied\nbehind them, as it were under sentence; and when he came near them\nthey fell on their knees and made pitiful signs to him for mercy.\n\"Alas! alas!\" says he, turning to me, \"why did you bring me this way?\nI do not love such sights. What must I do now? I must pardon them;\nprithee, what have they done?\" I told him the particular offences\nwhich they were brought to the place for. One had stole a bottle of\nrum, and had made himself drunk with it, and, when he was drunk, had\ndone a great many mad things, and had attempted to knock one of the\nwhite servants' brains out with a handspike, but that the white man\nhad avoided the blow, and, striking up the negro's heels, had seized\nhim and brought him prisoner thither, where he had lain all night; and\nthat I had told him he was to be whipped that day, and the next three\ndays, twice every day.\n\n\"And could you be so cruel?\" says his honour. \"Why, you would kill the\npoor wretch; and so, beside the blood which you would have to answer\nfor, you would lose me a lusty man negro, which cost me at least \u00c2\u00a330\nor \u00c2\u00a340, and bring a reproach upon my whole plantation. Nay, and more\nthan that, some of them in revenge would murder me, if ever it was in\ntheir power.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" says I, \"if those fellows are not kept under by violence, I\nbelieve you are satisfied nothing is to be done with them; and it is\nreported in your works that I have been rather their jest than their\nterror, for want of using them as they deserve; and I was resolved,\nhow much soever it is against my own disposition, that your service\nshould not suffer for my unseasonable forbearance; and therefore, if I\nhad scourged him to death----\" \"Hold,\" says he; \"no, no, by no means\nany such severity in my bounds. Remember, young man; you were once a\nservant. Deal as you would acknowledge it would be just to deal with\nyou in his case, and mingle always some mercy. I desire it, and let\nthe consequence of being too gentle be placed to my account.\"\n\nThis was as much as I could desire, and the more because what passed\nwas in public, and several, both negroes and white servants, as well\nas the particular persons who had accused me, heard it all, though I\ndid not know it. \"A cruel dog of an overseer,\" says one of the white\nservants behind; \"he would have whipped poor bullet-head\"--so they\ncalled the negro that was to be punished--\"to death if his honour had\nnot happened to come to-day.\"\n\nHowever, I urged the notorious crime this fellow was guilty of, and\nthe danger there was in such forbearance, from the refractory and\nincorrigible temper of the negroes, and pressed a little the necessity\nof making examples. But he said, \"Well, well, do it the next time, but\nnot now;\" so I said no more.\n\nThe other fellow's crime was trifling compared with this; and the\nmaster went forward, talking of it to me, and I following him, till we\ncame to the house; when, after he had been sat down a while, he called\nme to him, and, not suffering my accusers to come near till he had\nheard my defence, he began with me thus:--\n\n_Mast_. Hark ye, young man, I must have some discourse with you. Your\nconduct is complained of since I set you over this plantation. I\nthought your sense of the obligation I had laid on you would have\nsecured your diligence and faithfulness to me.\n\n_Jacque_. I am very sorry any complaint should be made of me, because\nthe obligation I am under to your honour (and which I freely confess)\ndoes bind me to your interest in the strongest manner imaginable; and,\nhowever I may have mistaken my business, I am sure I have not\nwillingly neglected it.\n\n_Mast_. Well, I shall not condemn you without hearing you, and\ntherefore I called you in now to tell you of it.\n\n_Jacque_. I humbly thank your honour. I have but one petition more,\nand that is, that I may know my accusation; and, if you please, my\naccusers.\n\n_Mast_. The first you shall, and that is the reason of my talking to\nyou in private; and if there is any need of a further hearing, you\nshall know your accusers too. What you are charged with is just\ncontrary to what appeared to me just now, and therefore you and I must\ncome to a new understanding about it, for I thought I was too cunning\nfor you, and now I think you have been too cunning for me.\n\n_Jacque_. I hope your honour will not be offended that I do not fully\nunderstand you.\n\n_Mast_. I believe you do not. Come, tell me honestly, did you really\nintend to whip the poor negro twice a day for four days together; that\nis to say, to whip him to death, for that would have been the English\nof it, and the end of it?\n\n_Jacque_. If I may be permitted to guess, sir, I believe I know the\ncharge that is brought against me, and that your honour has been told\nthat I have been too gentle with the negroes, as well as other\nservants; and that when they deserved to be used with the accustomed\nseverity of the country, I have not given them half enough; and that\nby this means they are careless of your business, and that your\nplantation is not well looked after, and the like.\n\n_Mast_. Well, you guess right. Go on.\n\n_Jacque_. The first part of the charge I confess, but the last I deny,\nand appeal to your honour's strictest examination into every part of\nit.\n\n_Mast_. If the last part could be true, I would be glad the first\nwere; for it would be an infinite satisfaction to me that, my business\nnot being neglected, nor our safety endangered, those poor wretches\ncould be used with more humanity; for cruelty is the aversion of my\nnature, and it is the only uncomfortable thing that attends me in all\nmy prosperity.\n\n_Jacque_. I freely acknowledge, sir, that at first it was impossible\nfor me to bring myself to that terrible work. How could I, that was\nbut just come out of the terror of it myself, and had but the day\nbefore been a poor naked, miserable servant myself, and might be\nto-morrow reduced to the same condition again; how could I use this\nterrible weapon[6] on the naked flesh of my fellow-servants, as well\nas fellow-creatures? At least, sir, when my duty made it absolutely\nnecessary, I could not do it without the utmost horror. I beseech you,\npardon me if I have such a tenderness in my nature, that though I\nmight be fit to be your servant, I am incapable of being an\nexecutioner, having been an offender myself.\n\n_Mast_. Well, but how, then, can my business be done? And how will\nthis terrible obstinacy of the negroes, who, they tell me, can be no\notherwise governed, be kept from neglect of their work, or even\ninsolence and rebellion?\n\n_Jacque_. This brings me, sir, to the latter part of my defence; and\nhere I hope your honour will be pleased to call my accusers, or that\nyou will give yourself the trouble of taking the exactest view of your\nplantation, and see, or let them show you, if anything is neglected,\nif your business has suffered in anything, or if your negroes or other\nservants are under less government than they were before; and if, on\nthe contrary, I have found out that happy secret, to have good order\nkept, the business of the plantation done, and that with diligence and\ndespatch, and that the negroes are kept in awe, the natural temper of\nthem subjected, and the safety and peace of your family secured, as\nwell by gentle means as by rough, by moderate correction as by torture\nand barbarity, by a due awe of just discipline as by the horror of\nunsufferable torments, I hope your honour will not lay that sin to my\ncharge.\n\n_Mast_. No, indeed; you would be the most acceptable manager that ever\nI employed. But how, then, does this consist with the cruel sentence\nyou had passed on the poor fellow that is in your condemned hole\nyonder, who was to be whipped eight times in four days?\n\n_Jacque_. Very well, sir. First, sir, he remains under the terrible\napprehensions of a punishment so severe as no negro ever had before.\nThis fellow, with your leave, I intended to release to-morrow without\nany whipping at all, after talking to him in my way about his offence,\nand raising in his mind a sense of the value of pardon. And if this\nmakes him a better servant than the severest whipping will do, then, I\npresume, you would allow I have gained a point.\n\n_Mast_. Ay; but what if it should not be so? For these fellows have no\nsense of gratitude.\n\n_Jacque_. That is, sir, because they are never pardoned. If they\noffend, they never know what mercy is; and what, then, have they to be\ngrateful for?\n\n_Mast_. Thou art in the right indeed. Where there is no mercy showed,\nthere is no obligation laid upon them.\n\n_Jacque_. Besides, sir, if they have at any time been let go, which is\nvery seldom, they are not told what the case is. They take no pains\nwith them to imprint principles of gratitude on their minds, to tell\nthem what kindness is shown them, and what they are indebted for it,\nand what they might gain in the end by it.\n\n_Mast_. But do you think such usage would do? Would it make any\nimpression? You persuade yourself it would, but you see 'tis against\nthe received notion of the whole country.\n\n_Jacque_. There are, it may be, public and national mistakes and\nerrors in conduct, and this is one.\n\n_Mast_. Have you tried it? You cannot say it is a mistake till you\nhave tried and proved it to be so.\n\n_Jacque_. Your whole plantation is a proof of it. This very fellow had\nnever acted as he did if he had not gotten rum in his head, and been\nout of the government of himself; so that, indeed, all the offence I\nought to have punished him for had been that of stealing a bottle of\nrum and drinking it all up; in which case, like Noah, he did not know\nthe strength of it, and when he had it in his head he was a madman, he\nwas as one raging and distracted; so that, for all the rest, he\ndeserved pity rather than punishment.\n\n_Mast_. Thou art right, certainly right, and thou wilt be a rare\nfellow if thou canst bring these notions into practice. I wish you had\ntried it upon any one particular negro, that I might see an example. I\nwould give \u00c2\u00a3500 if it could be brought to bear.\n\n_Jacque_. I desire nothing, sir, but your favour, and the advantage of\nobliging you. I will show you an example of it among your own negroes,\nand all the plantation will acknowledge it.\n\n_Mast_. You make my very heart glad within me, Jacque. If you can\nbring this to pass, I here give you my word I'll not only give you\nyour own freedom, but make a man of you for this world as long as you\nlive.\n\nUpon this I bowed to him very respectfully, and told him the following\nstory:--\"There is a negro, sir, in your plantation who has been your\nservant several years before I came. He did a fault that was of no\ngreat consequence in itself, but perhaps would have been worse if they\nhad indeed gone further; and I had him brought into the usual place,\nand tied him by the thumbs for correction, and he was told that he\nshould be whipped and pickled in a dreadful manner. After I had made\nproper impressions on his mind of the terror of his punishment, and\nfound that he was sufficiently humbled by it, I went into the house,\nand caused him to be brought out, just as they do when they go to\ncorrect the negroes on such occasions. When he was stripped and tied\nup he had two lashes given him, that was indeed very cruel ones, and I\ncalled to them to hold. 'Hold!' said I to the two men that had just\nbegan to lay on upon the poor fellow: 'Hold!' said I, 'let me talk\nwith him.'\n\n\"So he was taken down. Then I began and represented to him how kind\nyou, that were his great master,[7] had been to him; that you had\nnever done him any harm; that you had used him gently, and he had\nnever been brought to this punishment in so many years, though he had\ndone some faults before; that this was a notorious offence, for he had\nstolen some rum, and made himself and two other negroes drunk-mad;[8]\nand had abused two women negroes, who had husbands in our master's\nservice, but in another plantation; and played several pranks, and for\nthis I had appointed him this punishment.\n\n\"He shook his head, and made signs that he was _muchee sorree_, as he\ncalled it. 'And what will you say or do,' said I, 'if I should prevail\nwith the great master to pardon you? I have a mind to go and see if I\ncan beg for you.' He told me he would lie down, let me kill him. 'Me\nwill,' says he, 'run, go, fetch, bring for you as long as me live.'\nThis was the opportunity I had a mind to have, to try whether, as\nnegroes have all the other faculties of reasonable creatures, they had\nnot also some sense of kindness, some principles of natural\ngenerosity, which, in short, is the foundation of gratitude; for\ngratitude is the product of generous principles.\"\n\n\"You please me with the beginning of this story,\" says he; \"I hope you\nhave carried it on.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" says I; \"it has been carried on further perhaps than you\nimagine, or will think has been possible in such a case.\n\n\"But I was not so arrogant as to assume the merit to myself. 'No, no,'\nsaid I, 'I do not ask you to go or run for me; you must do all that\nfor our great master, for it will be from him entirely that you will\nbe pardoned at all, for your offence is against him; and what will you\nsay? Will you be grateful to him, and run, go, fetch, bring, for him,\nas long as you live, as you have said you would for me?'\n\n\"'Yes, indeed,' says he, 'and muchee do, muchee do, for you too' (he\nwould not leave me out); 'you ask him for me.'\n\n\"Well, I put off all his promised gratitude to me from myself, as was\nmy duty, and placed it to your account; told him I knew you was muchee\ngood, muchee pitiful, and I would persuade you if I could; and so told\nhim I would go to you, and he should be whipped no more till I came\nagain; but, 'Hark ye, Mouchat,' says I (that was the negro's name),\n'they tell me, when I came hither, that there is no showing kindness\nto any of you negroes; that when we spare you from whipping you laugh\nat us, and are the worse.'\n\n\"He looked very serious at me, and said, 'Oh, that not so; the masters\nsay so, but no be so, no be so, indeede, indeede,' and so we parleyed.\"\n\n_Jacque_. Why do they say so, then? To be sure they have tried you\nall.\n\n_Negro_. No, no, they no try; they say so, but no try.\n\n_Jacque_. I hear them all say so.\n\n_Negro_. Me tell you the true; they have no mercie; they beat us\ncruel, all cruel; they never have show mercie. How can they tell we be\nno better?\n\n_Jacque_. What! do they never spare?\n\n_Negro_. Master, me speakee the true; they never give mercie; they\nalways whippee, lashee, knockee down, all cruel. Negro be muchee\nbetter man, do muchee better work, but they tell us no mercie.\n\n_Jacque_. But what, do they never show any mercy?\n\n_Negro_. No, never; no, never; all whippee; all whippee, cruel, worse\nthan they whippee de horse, whippee de dog.\n\n_Jacque_. But would they be better if they did?\n\n_Negro_. Yes, yes; negro be muchee better if they be mercie. When they\nbe whippee, whippee, negro muchee cry, muchee hate; would kill if they\nhad de gun. But when they makee de mercie, then negro tell de great\ntankee, and love to worke, and do muchee worke; and because he good\nmaster to them.\n\n_Jacque_. They say no; you would laugh at them and mock when they show\nmercy.\n\n_Negro_. How they say when they show mercie? They never show mercie;\nme never see them show one mercie since me live.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said I, \"if this be so, really they go, I dare say,\ncontrary to your inclination, for I see you are but too full of pity\nfor the miserable. I saw it in my own case; and upon a presumption\nthat you had rather have your work done from a principle of love than\nfear, without making your servants bleed for every trifle, if it were\npossible; I say, upon this presumption I dealt with this Mouchat, as\nyou shall hear.\"\n\n_Mast_. I have never met with anything of this kind since I have been\na planter, which is now about forty years. I am delighted with the\nstory. Go on; I expect a pleasant conclusion.\n\n_Jacque_. The conclusion, sir, will be, I believe, as much to your\nsatisfaction as the beginning; for it every way answered my\nexpectation, and will yours also, and show you how you might be\nfaithfully served if you pleased, for 'tis certain you are not so\nserved now.\n\n_Mast_. No, indeed; they serve me but just as they do the devil, for\nfear I should hurt them. But 'tis contrary to an ingenuous spirit to\ndelight in such service. I abhor it, if I could but know how to get\nany other.\n\n_Jacque_. It is easy, sir, to show you that you may be served upon\nbetter principles, and consequently be better served, and more to your\nsatisfaction; and I dare undertake to convince you of it.\n\n_Mast_. Well, go on with the story.\n\n_Jacque_. After I had talked thus to him I said, \"Well, Mouchat, I\nshall see how you will be afterwards, if I can get our great master to\nbe merciful to you at this time.\"\n\n_Negro_. Yes, you shall see; you muchee see, muchee see.\n\n\"Upon this I called for my horse and went from him, and made as if I\nrode away to you, who they told me was in the next plantation; and\nhaving stayed four or five hours, I came back and talked to him again,\ntold him that I had waited on you, and that you had heard of his\noffence, was highly provoked, and had resolved to cause him to be\nseverely punished for an example to all the negroes in the plantation;\nbut that I had told you how penitent he was, and how good he would be\nif you would pardon him; and had at last prevailed on you. That you\nhad told me what all people said of the negroes; how, that to show\nthem mercy was to make them think you were never in earnest with them,\nand that you did but trifle and play with them. However, that I had\ntold you what he had said of himself, and that it was not true of the\nnegroes, and that the white men said it, but that they could not know\nbecause they did never show any mercy, and therefore had never tried;\nthat I had persuaded you to show mercy, to try whether kindness would\nprevail as much as cruelty. 'And now, Mouchat,' said I, 'you will be\nlet go. Pray let our great master see that I have said true.' So I\nordered him to be untied, gave him a dram of rum out of my\npocket-bottle, and ordered them to give him some victuals.\n\n\"When the fellow was let loose, he came to me and kneeled down to me,\nand took hold of my legs and of my feet, and laid his head upon the\nground, and sobbed and cried like a child that had been corrected, but\ncould not speak for his life; and thus he continued a long time. I\nwould have taken him up, but he would not rise; but I cried as fast as\nhe, for I could not bear to see a poor wretch lie on the ground to me,\nthat was but a servant the other day like himself. At last, but not\ntill a quarter of an hour, I made him get up, and then he spoke. 'Me\nmuchee know good great master, muchee good you master. No negro\nunthankful; me die for them, do me so muchee kind.'\n\n\"I dismissed him then, and bid him go to his wife (for he was\nmarried), and not work that afternoon; but as he was going away I\ncalled him again, and talked thus to him.\n\n\"'Now, Mouchat,' says I, 'you see the white men can show mercy. Now\nyou must tell all the negroes what has been reported of them; that\nthey regard nothing but the whip; that if they are used gently they\nare the worse, not the better; and that this is the reason why the\nwhite men show them no mercy; and convince them that they would be\nmuch better treated and used kindlier if they would show themselves as\ngrateful for kind usage as humble after torment; and see if you can\nwork on them.'\n\n\"'Me go, me go,' says he; 'me muchee talk to them. They be muchee glad\nas me be, and do great work to be used kind by de great master.'\"\n\n_Mast_. Well, but now what testimony have you of this gratitude you\nspeak of? Have you seen any alteration among them?\n\n_Jacque_. I come next to that part, sir. About a month after this I\ncaused a report to be spread abroad in the plantation that I had\noffended you, the great master, and that I was turned out of the\nplantation, and was to be hanged. Your honour knows that some time ago\nyou sent me upon your particular business into Potuxent River, where I\nwas absent twelve days; then I took the opportunity to have this\nreport spread about among the negroes, to see how it would work.\n\n_Mast_. What! to see how Mouchat would take it?\n\n_Jacque_. Yes, sir; and it made a discovery indeed. The poor fellow\ndid not believe it presently, but finding I was still absent, he went\nto the head-clerk, and standing at his door, said nothing, but looked\nlike a fool of ten years old. After some time the upper overseer came\nout, and seeing him stand there, at first said nothing, supposing he\nhad been sent of some errand; but observing him to stand stock-still,\nand that he was in the same posture and place during the time that he\nhad passed and repassed two or three times, he stops short the last\ntime of his coming by. \"What do you want,\" says he to him, \"that you\nstand idle here so long?\"\n\n\"'Me speakee; me tell something,' says he.\n\n\"Then the overseer thought some discovery was at hand, and began to\nlisten to him. 'What would you tell me?' says he.\n\n\"'Me tell! Pray,' says he, 'where be de other master?'\n\n\"He meant he would ask where he was. 'What other master do you mean?'\nsays the clerk. 'What! do you want to speak with the great master? He\ncan't be spoke with by you. Pray what is your business? Cannot you\ntell it to me?'\n\n\"'No, no; me no speakee the great master--the other master,' says\nMouchat.\"\n\n\"'What! the colonel?' says the clerk.\n\n\"'Yes, yes; the colonel,' says he.\n\n\"'Why, don't you know that he is to be hanged to-morrow,' says the\nclerk, 'for making the great master angry?'[9]\n\n\"'Yes, yes,' says Mouchat; 'me know, me know; but me want speak; me\ntell something.'\n\n\"'Well, what would you say?' says the clerk.\n\n\"'Oh! me no let him makee de great master angry.' With that he kneeled\ndown to the clerk.\n\n\"'What ails you?' says the clerk. 'I tell you he must be hanged.'\n\n\"'No, no,' says he; 'no hang de master. Me kneel for him to great\nmaster.'\n\n\"'You kneel for him!' says the clerk.[10] 'What! do you think the\ngreat master will mind you? He has made the great master angry, and\nmust be hanged, I tell you. What signifies your begging?'\n\n\"_Negro_. Oh! me pray, me pray the great master for him.\n\n\"_Clerk_. Why, what ails you that you would pray for him?\n\n\"_Negro_. Oh! he beggee the great master for me; now me beggee for\nhim. The great master muchee good, muchee good; he pardon me when the\nother master beggee me; now he pardon him when me beggee for him\nagain.\n\n\"_Clerk_. No, no; your begging won't do. Will you be hanged for him?\nIf you do that, something may be.\n\n\"_Negro_. Yes, yes; me be hang for de poor master that beggee for me.\nMouchat shall hang; the great master shall hangee me, whippee me;\nanything to save the poor master that beggee me; yes, yes, indeed.\n\n\"_Clerk_. Are you in earnest, Mouchat?\n\n\"_Negro_. Yes, indeed; me tellee de true. The great master shall know\nme tellee de true, for he shall see the white man hangee me, Mouchat.\nPoor negro Mouchat will be hangee, be whippee, anything for the poor\nmaster that beggee for me.\n\n\"With this the poor fellow cried most pitifully, and there was no room\nto question his being in earnest; when on a sudden I appeared, for I\nwas fetched to see all this transaction. I was not in the house at\nfirst, but was just come home from the business you sent me of, and\nheard it all; and indeed neither the clerk or I could bear it any\nlonger, so he came out to me. 'Go to him,' says he; 'you have made an\nexample that will never be forgot, that a negro can be grateful. Go to\nhim,' adds he, 'for I can talk to him no longer.' So I appeared, and\nspoke to him presently, and let him see that I was at liberty; but to\nhear how the poor fellow behaved your honour cannot but be pleased.\"\n\n_Mast_. Prithee go on. I am pleased with it all; 'tis all a new scene\nof negro life to me, and very moving.\n\n_Jacque_. For a good while he stood as if he had been thunderstruck\nand stupid; but, looking steadily at me, though not speaking a word,\nat last he mutters to himself, with a kind of laugh, \"Ay, ay,\" says\nhe, \"Mouchat see, Mouchat no see; me wakee, me no wakee; no hangee, no\nhangee; he live truly, very live;\" and then on a sudden he runs to me,\nsnatches me away as if I had been a boy of ten years old, and takes me\nup upon his back and runs away with me, till I was fain to cry out to\nhim to stop. Then he sets me down, and looks at me again, then falls\na-dancing about me as if he had been bewitched, just as you have seen\nthem do about their wives and children when they are merry.\n\n\"Well, then, he began to talk with me, and told me what they had said\nto him, how I was to be hanged. 'Well,' says I, 'Mouchat, and would\nyou have been satisfied to be hanged to save me?' 'Yes, yes,' says he;\n'be truly hangee, to beggee you.'\n\n\"'But why do you love me so well, Mouchat?' said I.\n\n\"'Did you no beggee me,' he says, 'at the great master? You savee me,\nmake great master muchee good, muchee kind, no whippee me; me no\nforget; me be whipped, be hanged, that you no be hanged; me die, that\nyou no die; me no let any bad be with you all while that me live.'\n\n\"Now, sir, your honour may judge whether kindness, well managed, would\nnot oblige these people as well as cruelty, and whether there are\nprinciples of gratitude in them or no.\"\n\n_Mast_. But what, then, can be the reason that we never believed it to\nbe so before?\n\n_Jacque_. Truly, sir, I fear that Mouchat gave the true reason.\n\n_Mast_. What was that, pray? That we were too cruel?\n\n_Jacque_. That they never had any mercy showed them; that we never\ntried them whether they would be grateful or no; that if they did a\nfault they were never spared, but punished with the utmost cruelty; so\nthat they had no passion, no affection, to act upon but that of fear,\nwhich necessarily brought hatred with it; but that if they were used\nwith compassion they would serve with affection as well as other\nservants. Nature is the same, and reason governs in just proportions\nin all creatures; but having never been let taste what mercy is, they\nknow not how to act from a principle of love.\n\n_Mast_. I am convinced it is so. But now, pray tell me, how did you\nput this in practice with the poor negroes now in bonds yonder, when\nyou passed such a cruel sentence upon them that they should be whipped\ntwice a day, for four days together? Was that showing mercy?\n\n_Jacque_. My method was just the same; and if you please to inquire of\nMr.----, your other servant, you will be satisfied that it was so; for\nwe agreed upon the same measures as I took with Mouchat; namely, first\nto put them into the utmost horror and apprehensions of the cruellest\npunishment that they ever heard of, and thereby enhance the value of\ntheir pardon, which was to come as from yourself, but not without our\ngreat intercession. Then I was to argue with them, and work upon their\nreason, to make the mercy that was showed them sink deep into their\nminds and give lasting impressions; explain the meaning of gratitude\nto them, and the nature of an obligation, and the like, as I had done\nwith Mouchat.\n\n_Mast_. I am answered. Your method is certainly right, and I desire\nyou may go on with it; for I desire nothing on this side heaven more\nthan to have all my negroes serve me from principles of gratitude for\nmy kindness to them. I abhor to be feared like a lion, like a tyrant.\nIt is a violence upon nature every way, and is the most disagreeable\nthing in the world to a generous mind.\n\n_Jacque_. But, sir, I am doubtful that you may not believe that I\nintended to act thus with those poor fellows. I beseech you to send\nfor Mr.----, that he may tell you what we had agreed on before I speak\nwith him.\n\n_Mast_. What reason have I to doubt that?\n\n_Jacque_. I hope you have not; but I should be very sorry you should\nthink me capable of executing such a sentence as you have heard me own\nI had passed on them, and there can be no way effectually to clear it\nup but this.\n\n_Mast_. Well, seeing you put so much weight upon it, he shall be\ncalled for.\n\n[He was called, and being ordered by the master to tell the measures\nthat were concerted between them for the punishment or management of\nthose negroes, he gave it just as Jacque had done before.]\n\n_Jacque_. I hope, sir, you are now not only satisfied of the truth of\nthe account I gave relating to the method we had agreed on, but of its\nbeing so proper and so likely to answer your end.\n\n_Mast_. I am fully satisfied, and shall be glad to see that it answers\nthe end; for, as I have said, nothing can be more agreeable to me.\nNothing has so much robbed me of the comfort of all my fortunes as the\ncruelty used, in my name, on the bodies of those poor slaves.\n\n_Jacque_. It is certainly wrong, sir; it is not only wrong as it is\nbarbarous and cruel; but it is wrong, too, as it is the worst way of\nmanaging and of having your business done.\n\n_Mast_. It is my aversion; it fills my very soul with horror. I\nbelieve if I should come by while they were using those cruelties on\nthe poor creatures, I should either sink down at the sight of it or\nfly into a rage and kill the fellow that did it; though it is done,\ntoo, by my own authority.\n\n_Jacque_. But, sir, I dare say I shall convince you also that it is\nwrong in respect of interest, and that your business shall be better\ndischarged and your plantations better ordered, and more work done by\nthe negroes who shall be engaged by mercy and lenity than by those who\nare driven and dragged by the whips and the chains of a merciless\ntormentor.\n\n_Mast_. I think the nature of the thing speaks itself. Doubtless it\nshould be so, and I have often thought it would be so, and a thousand\ntimes wished it might be so; but all my English people pretend\notherwise, and that it is impossible to bring the negroes to any sense\nof kindness, and consequently not to any obedience of love.\n\n_Jacque_. It may be true, sir, that there may be found here and there\na negro of a senseless, stupid, sordid disposition, perfectly\nuntractable, undocible, and incapable of due impressions; especially\nincapable of the generosity of principle which I am speaking of. You\nknow very well, sir, there are such among Christians as well as among\nthe negroes; whence else came the English proverb, That if you save a\nthief from the gallows, he shall be the first to cut your throat. But,\nsir, if such a refractory, undocible fellow comes in our way, he must\nbe dealt with, first by the smooth ways to try him, then by the\nviolent way to break his temper, as they break a horse; and if nothing\nwill do, such a wretch should be sold off, and others bought in his\nroom; for the peace of the plantation should not be broken for one\ndevilish-tempered fellow. And if this was done I doubt not you should\nhave all your plantations carried on and your work done, and not a\nnegro or a servant upon it but what would not only work for you, but\neven die for you, if there was an occasion for it, as you see this\npoor Mouchat would have done for me.\n\n_Mast_. Well, go on with your measures, and may you succeed. I'll\npromise you I will fully make you amends for it. I long to have these\ncruelties out of use, in my plantation especially. As for others, let\nthem do as they will.\n\nOur master being gone, I went to the prisoners, and first I suffered\nthem to be told that the great master had been there, and that he had\nbeen inclined to pardon them, till he knew what their crime was; but\nthen he said it was so great a fault that it must be punished.\nBesides, the man that talked to them told them that the great master\nsaid that he knew if he had pardoned them they would be but the worse,\nfor that the negroes were never thankful for being spared, and that\nthere were no other ways to make them obedient but severity.\n\nOne of the poor fellows, more sensible than the other, answered, if\nany negro be badder for being kindly used, they should be whipped till\nthey were muchee better; but that he never knew that, for that he\nnever knew the negro be kindly use.\n\nThis was the same thing as the other had said, and indeed was but too\ntrue, for the overseers really knew no such thing as mercy; and that\nnotion of the negroes being no other way to be governed but by cruelty\nhad been the occasion that no other method was ever tried among them.\n\nAgain, if a slack hand had at any time been held upon them, it had not\nbeen done with discretion, or as a point of mercy, and managed with\nthe assistance of argument to convince the negroes of the nature and\nreason of it, and to show them what they ought to do in return for it;\nbut it was perhaps the effect of negligence, ill conduct, and want of\napplication to the business of the plantation; and then it was no\nwonder that the negroes took the advantage of it.\n\nWell, I carried on the affair with these two negroes just as I did\nwith Mouchat, so I need not repeat the particulars; and they were\ndelivered with infinite acknowledgments and thanks, even to all the\nextravagances of joy usual in those people on such occasions. And such\nwas the gratitude of those two pardoned fellows that they were the\nmost faithful and most diligent servants ever after that belonged to\nthe whole plantation, Mouchat excepted.\n\nIn this manner I carried on the plantation fully to his satisfaction;\nand before a year more was expired there was scarce any such thing as\ncorrection known in the plantation, except upon a few boys, who were\nincapable of the impressions that good usage would have made, even\nupon them too, till they had lived to know the difference.\n\nIt was some time after this conference that our great master, as we\ncalled him, sent for me again to his dwelling-house, and told me he\nhad had an answer from England from his friend, to whom he had written\nabout my bill. I was a little afraid that he was going to ask me leave\nto send it to London; but he did not say anything like that, but told\nme that his friend had been with the gentleman, and that he owned the\nbill, and that he had all the money in his hand that the bill had\nmentioned; but that he had promised the young man that had given him\nthe money (meaning me) not to pay the money to anybody but himself,\nthough they should bring the bill; the reason of which was, that I did\nnot know who might get the bill away from me.\n\n\"But now, Colonel Jacque,\" says he, \"as you wrote him an account where\nyou was, and by what wicked arts you were trepanned, and that it was\nimpossible for you to have your liberty till you could get the money,\nmy friend at London has written to me, that, upon making out a due\ncopy of the bill here, attested by a notary and sent to him, and your\nobligation likewise attested, whereby you oblige yourself to deliver\nthe original to his order after the money is paid, he will pay the\nmoney.\"\n\nI told him I was willing to do whatever his honour directed; and so\nthe proper copies were drawn as I had been told were required.\n\n\"But now, what will you do with this money, Jacque?\" says he, smiling.\n\"Will you buy your liberty of me, and go to planting?\"\n\nI was too cunning for him now indeed, for I remembered what he had\npromised me; and I had too much knowledge of the honesty of his\nprinciples, as well as of the kindness he had for me, to doubt his\nbeing as good as his word; so I turned all this talk of his upon him\nanother way. I knew that when he asked me if I would buy my liberty\nand go to planting, it was to try if I would leave him; so I said,\n\"As to buying my liberty, sir--that is to say, going out of your\nservice--I had much rather buy more time in your service, and I am\nonly unhappy that I have but two years to serve.\"\n\n\"Come, come, colonel,\" says he, \"don't flatter me; I love plain\ndealing. Liberty is precious to everybody; if you have a mind to have\nyour money brought over, you shall have your liberty to begin for\nyourself, and I will take care you shall be well used by the country,\nand get you a good plantation.\"\n\nI still insisted that I would not quit his service for the best\nplantation in Maryland; that he had been so good to me, and I believed\nI was so useful to him, that I could not think of it; and at last I\nadded I hoped he could not believe but I had as much gratitude as a\nnegro.\n\nHe smiled, and said he would not be served upon those terms; that he\ndid not forget what he had promised, nor what I had done in his\nplantation; and that he was resolved in the first place to give me my\nliberty. So he pulls out a piece of paper, and throws it to me:\n\"There,\" says he, \"there's a certificate of your coming on shore, and\nbeing sold to me for five years, of which you have lived three with\nme; and now you are your own master.\" I bowed, and told him that I was\nsure, if I was my own master, I would be his servant as long as he\nwould accept of my service. And now we strained courtesies, and he\ntold me I should be his servant still; but it should be on two\nconditions: first, that he would give me \u00c2\u00a330 a year and my board for\nmy managing the plantation I was then employed in; and, secondly, that\nat the same time he would procure me a new plantation to begin upon my\nown account, \"For, Colonel Jacque,\" says he, smiling, \"though you are\nbut a young man, yet 'tis time you were doing something for yourself.\"\n\nI answered that I could do little at a plantation for myself, unless I\nneglected his business, which I was resolved not to do on any terms\nwhatever, but that I would serve him faithfully, if he would accept of\nme, as long as he lived. \"So you shall,\" says he again, \"and serve\nyourself too.\" And thus we parted for that time.\n\nHere I am to observe in the general, to avoid dwelling too long upon a\nstory, that as the two negroes who I delivered from punishment were\never after the most diligent and laborious poor fellows in the whole\nplantation as above, except Mouchat, of whom I shall speak more\nby-and-by, so they not only were grateful themselves for their good\nusage, but they influenced the whole plantation; so that the gentle\nusage and lenity with which they had been treated had a thousand times\nmore influence upon them to make them diligent than all the blows and\nkicks, whippings, and other tortures could have which they had been\nused to. And now the plantation was famous for it; so that several\nother planters began to do the same, though I cannot say it was with\nthe same success, which might be for want of taking pains with them\nand working upon their passions in a right manner. It appeared that\nnegroes were to be reasoned into things as well as other people, and\nit was by thus managing their reason that most of the work was done.\n\nHowever, as it was, the plantations in Maryland were the better for\nthis undertaking, and they are to this day less cruel and barbarous to\ntheir negroes than they are in Barbados and Jamaica; and 'tis observed\nthe negroes are not in these colonies so desperate, neither do they so\noften run away or so often plot mischief against their master, as they\ndo in those.\n\nI have dwelt the longer upon it that, if possible, posterity might be\npersuaded to try gentler methods with those miserable creatures, and\nto use them with humanity; assuring them that if they did so, adding\nthe common prudence that every particular case would direct them to\nfor itself, the negroes would do their work faithfully and cheerfully;\nthey would not find any of that refractoriness and sullenness in their\ntemper that they pretend now to complain of, but they would be the\nsame as their Christian servants, except that they would be the more\nthank ful, and humble, and laborious of the two.\n\nI continued in this station between five and six years after this, and\nin all that time we had not one negro whipped, except, as I observed\nbefore, now and then an unlucky boy, and that only for trifles. I\ncannot say but we had some ill-natured, ungovernable negroes; but if\nat any time such offended, they were pardoned the first time, in the\nmanner as above, and the second time were ordered to be turned out of\nthe plantation. And this was remarkable, that they would torment\nthemselves at the apprehension of being turned away, more by a great\ndeal than if they had been to be whipped, for then they were only\nsullen and heavy. Nay, at length we found the fear of being turned out\nof the plantation had as much effect to reform them--that is to say,\nmake them more diligent--than any torture would have done; and the\nreason was evident, namely, because in our plantation they were used\nlike men, in the other like dogs.\n\nMy master owned the satisfaction he took in this blessed change, as he\ncalled it, as long as he lived; and as he was so engaged by seeing the\nnegroes grateful, he showed the same principle of gratitude to those\nthat served him as he looked for in those that he served, and\nparticularly to me; and so I come briefly to that part. The first\nthing he did after giving me my liberty as above, and making me an\nallowance, was to get the country bounty to me--that is to say, a\nquantity of land to begin and plant for myself.\n\nBut this he managed a way by himself, and, as I found afterwards, took\nup, that is, purchased in my name, about three hundred acres of land,\nin a more convenient place than it would have otherwise been allotted\nme; and this he did by his interest with the lord proprietor; so that\nI had an extent of ground marked out to me, not next but very near one\nof his own plantations. When I made my acknowledgment for this to him,\nhe told me plainly that I was not beholden to him for it all; for he\ndid it that I might not be obliged to neglect his business for the\ncarrying on my own, and on that account he would not reckon to me what\nmoney he paid, which, however, according to the custom of the country,\nwas not a very great sum--I think about \u00c2\u00a340 or \u00c2\u00a350.\n\nThus he very generously gave me my liberty, advanced this money for\nme, put me into a plantation for myself, and gave me \u00c2\u00a330 a year wages\nfor looking after one of his own plantations.\n\n\"But, Colonel,\" says he to me, \"giving you this plantation is nothing\nat all to you if I do not assist you to support it and to carry it on,\nand therefore I will give you credit for whatever is needful to you\nfor the carrying it on; such as tools, provisions for servants, and\nsome servants to begin; materials to build outhouses, and\nconveniences of all sorts for the plantation, and to buy hogs, cows,\nhorses for stock, and the like; and I'll take it out of your cargo,\nwhich will come from London, for the money of your bill.\"\n\nThis was highly obliging and very kind, and the more so, as it\nafterwards appeared. In order to this he sent two servants of his own\nwho were carpenters. As for timber, boards, planks, and all sorts of\nsuch things, in a country almost all made of wood they could not be\nwanting. These run me up a little wooden house in less than three\nweeks' time, where I had three rooms, a kitchen, an outhouse, and\ntwo large sheds at a distance from the house for store houses, almost\nlike barns, with stables at the end of them; and thus I was set up in\nthe world, and, in short, removed by the degrees that you have heard\nfrom a pickpocket to a kidnapped, miserable slave in Virginia (for\nMaryland is Virginia, speaking of them at a distance); then from a\nslave to a head-officer or overseer of slaves, and from thence to a\nmaster-planter.\n\nI had now, as above, a house, a stable, two warehouses, and three\nhundred acres of land; but, as we say, bare walls make giddy hussies,\nso I had neither axe nor hatchet to cut down the trees; horse, nor\nhog, nor cow to put upon the land; not a hoe or a spade to break\nground, nor a pair of hands but my own to go to work upon.\n\nBut Heaven and kind masters make up all those things to a diligent\nservant; and I mention it because people who are either transported or\notherwise trepanned into those places are generally thought to be\nrendered miserable and undone; whereas, on the contrary, I would\nencourage them, upon my own experience, to depend upon it, that if\ntheir own diligence in the time of service gains them but a good\ncharacter, which it will certainly do if they can deserve it, there is\nnot the poorest and most despicable felon that ever went over but may,\nafter his time is served, begin for himself, and may in time be sure\nof raising a good plantation.\n\nFor example, I will now take a man in the meanest circumstances of a\nservant, who has served out his five or seven years; suppose a\ntransported wretch for seven years. The custom of the place was\nthen--what it is since I know not--that on his master's certifying\nthat he had served his time out faithfully, he had fifty acres of land\nallotted him for planting, and on this plan he begins.\n\nSome had a horse, a cow, and three hogs given, or rather lent, them,\nas a stock for the land, which they made an allowance for at a certain\ntime and rate.\n\nCustom has made it a trade to give credit to such beginners as these\nfor tools, clothes, nails, ironwork, and other things necessary for\ntheir planting, and which the persons so giving credit to them are to\nbe paid for out of the crop of tobacco which they shall plant. Nor is\nit in the debtor's power to defraud the creditor of payment in that\nmanner; and as tobacco is their coin as well as their product, so all\nthings are to be purchased at a certain quantity of tobacco, the price\nbeing so rated.\n\nThus the naked planter has credit at his beginning, and immediately\ngoes to work to cure the land and plant tobacco; and from this little\nbeginning have some of the most considerable planters in Virginia, and\nin Maryland also, raised themselves--namely, from being without a hat\nor a shoe to estates of \u00c2\u00a340,000 or \u00c2\u00a350,000; and in this method, I may\nadd, no diligent man ever miscarried, if he had health to work and was\na good husband; for he every year increases a little, and every year\nadding more land and planting more tobacco, which is real money, he\nmust gradually increase in substance, till at length he gets enough to\nbuy negroes and other servants, and then never works himself any more.\n\nIn a word, every Newgate wretch, every desperate forlorn creature, the\nmost despicable ruined man in the world, has here a fair opportunity\nput into his hands to begin the world again, and that upon a foot of\ncertain gain and in a method exactly honest, with a reputation that\nnothing past will have any effect upon; and innumerable people have\nraised themselves from the worst circumstances in the world--namely,\nfrom the cells in Newgate.\n\nBut I return to my own story. I was now a planter, and encouraged by a\nkind benefactor; for, that I might not be wholly taken up with my new\nplantation, he gave me freely, and without any consideration, my\ngrateful negro, Mouchat. He told me it was a debt due to the affection\nthat poor creature had always had for me; and so indeed it was, for as\nthe fellow would once have been hanged for me, so now, and to his\nlast, he loved me so much that it was apparent he did everything with\npleasure that he did for me; and he was so overcome of joy when he\nheard that he was to be my negro that the people in the plantation\nreally thought it would turn his head, and that the fellow would go\ndistracted.\n\nBesides this, he sent me two servants more, a man and a woman, but\nthese he put to my account, as above. Mouchat and these two fell\nimmediately to work for me, and they began with about two acres of\nland which had but little timber on it at first, and most of that was\ncut down by the two carpenters who built my house, or shed rather, for\nso it should be called.\n\nThese two acres I got in good forwardness, and most of it well\nplanted with tobacco; though some of it we were obliged to plant with\ngarden-stuff for food, such as potatoes, carrots, cabbages, peas,\nbeans, &c.\n\nIt was a great advantage to me that I had so bountiful a master, who\nhelped me out in every case; for in this very first year I received a\nterrible blow. For my bill, as I have observed, having been copied and\nattested in form, and sent to London, my kind friend and custom-house\ngentleman paid me the money, and the merchant at London, by my good\nmaster's direction, had laid it all out in a sorted cargo of goods for\nme, such as would have made a man of me all at once; but, to my\ninexpressible terror and surprise, the ship was lost, and that just at\nthe entrance into the capes; that is to say, the mouth of the bay.\nSome of the goods were recovered, but spoiled; and, in short, nothing\nbut the nails, tools, and ironwork were good for anything; and though\nthe value of them was pretty considerable in proportion to the rest,\nyet my loss was irreparably great, and indeed the greatness of the\nloss to me consisted in its being irreparable.\n\nI was perfectly astonished at the first news of the loss, knowing that\nI was in debt to my patron, or master, so much that it must be several\nyears before I should recover it; and as he brought me the bad news\nhimself, he perceived my disorder; that is to say, he saw I was in the\nutmost confusion and a kind of amazement; and so indeed I was, because\nI was so much in debt. But he spoke cheerfully to me. \"Come,\" says he,\n\"do not be so discouraged; you may make up this loss.\" \"No, sir,\" says\nI; \"that never can be, for it is my all, and I shall never be out of\ndebt.\" \"Well, but,\" says he, \"you have no creditor, however, but me;\nand now I remember I once told you I would make a man of you, and I\nwill not disappoint you for this disaster.\"\n\nI thanked him, and did it with more ceremony and respect than ever,\nbecause I thought myself more under the hatches than I was before. But\nhe was as good as his word, for he did not baulk me in the least of\nanything I wanted; and as I had more ironwork saved out of the ship,\nin proportion, than I wanted, I supplied him with some part of it, and\ntook up some linen and clothes and other necessaries from him in\nexchange.\n\nAnd now I began to increase visibly. I had a large quantity of land\ncured--that is, freed from timber--and a very good crop of tobacco in\nview. And I got three servants more and one negro, so that I had five\nwhite servants and two negroes, and with this my affairs went very\nwell on.\n\nThe first year, indeed, I took my wages, or salary--that is to say,\n\u00c2\u00a330 a year--because I wanted it very much; but the second and third\nyear I resolved not to take it on any account whatsoever, but to leave\nit in my benefactor's hands to clear off the debt I had contracted.\n\nAnd now I must impose a short digression on the reader, to note that\nnotwithstanding all the disadvantages of a most wretched education,\nyet now, when I began to feel myself, as I may say, in the world, and\nto be arrived to an independent state, and to foresee that I might be\nsomething considerable in time; I say, now I found different\nsentiments of things taking place in my mind. And, first, I had a\nsolid principle of justice and honesty, and a secret horror at\nthings past, when I looked back upon my former life. That original\nsomething--I knew not what--that used formerly to check me in the\nfirst meannesses of my youth, and used to dictate to me when I was but\na child that I was to be a gentleman, continued to operate upon me now\nin a manner I cannot describe; and I continually remembered the words\nof the ancient glassmaker to the gentleman that he reproved for\nswearing, that to be a gentleman was to be an honest man; that without\nhonesty human nature was sunk and degenerated; the gentleman lost all\nthe dignity of his birth, and placed himself even below an honest\nbeggar. These principles, growing upon my mind in the present\ncircumstances I was in, gave me a secret satisfaction that I can give\nno description of. It was an inexpressible joy to me that I was now\nlike to be, not only a man, but an honest man; and it yielded me a\ngreater pleasure that I was ransomed from being a vagabond, a thief,\nand a criminal, as I had been from a child, than that I was delivered\nfrom slavery and the wretched state of a Virginia sold servant. I had\nnotion enough in my mind of the hardships of the servant, or slave,\nbecause I had felt it and worked through it; I remembered it as a\nstate of labour and servitude, hardship and suffering. But the other\nshocked my very nature, chilled my blood, and turned the very soul\nwithin me; the thought of it was like reflections upon hell and the\ndamned spirits; it struck me with horror, it was odious and frightful\nto look back on, and it gave me a kind of a fit, a convulsion or\nnervous disorder, that was very uneasy to me.\n\nBut to look forward, to reflect how things were changed, how happy I\nwas that I could live by my own endeavours, and was no more under the\nnecessity of being a villain, and of getting my bread at my own hazard\nand the ruin of honest families--this had in it something more than\ncommonly pleasing and agreeable, and, in particular, it had a pleasure\nthat till then I had known nothing of. It was a sad thing to be under\na necessity of doing evil to procure that subsistence which I could\nnot support the want of, to be obliged to run the venture of the\ngallows rather than the venture of starving, and to be always wicked\nfor fear of want.\n\nI cannot say that I had any serious religious reflections, or that\nthese things proceeded yet from the uneasiness of conscience, but from\nmere reasonings with myself, and from being arrived to a capacity of\nmaking a right judgment of things more than before. Yet I own I had\nsuch an abhorrence of the wicked life I had led that I was secretly\neasy, and had a kind of pleasure in the disaster that was upon me\nabout the ship, and that, though it was a loss, I could not but be\nglad that those ill-gotten goods was gone, and that I had lost what I\nhad stolen. For I looked on it as none of mine, and that it would be\nfire in my flax if I should mingle it with what I had now, which was\ncome honestly by, and was, as it were, sent from heaven to lay the\nfoundation of my prosperity, which the other would be only as a moth\nto consume.\n\nAt the same time my thoughts dictated to me, that though this was the\nfoundation of my new life, yet that this was not the superstructure,\nand that I might still be born for greater things than these; that it\nwas honesty and virtue alone that made men rich and great, and gave\nthem a fame as well as a figure in the world, and that therefore I was\nto lay my foundation in these, and expect what might follow in time.\n\nTo help these thoughts, as I had learned to read and write when I was\nin Scotland, so I began now to love books, and particularly I had an\nopportunity of reading some very considerable ones, such as Livy's\nRoman History, the history of the Turks, the English History of Speed,\nand others; the history of the Low Country wars, the history of\nGustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, and the history of the Spaniards'\nconquest of Mexico, with several others, some of which I bought at a\nplanter's house who was lately dead and his goods sold, and others I\nhad borrowed.\n\nI considered my present state of life to be my mere youth, though I\nwas now above thirty years old, because in my youth I had learned\nnothing; and if my daily business, which was now great, would have\npermitted, I would have been content to have gone to school. However,\nfate, that had yet something else in store for me, threw an\nopportunity into my hand; namely, a clever fellow that came over a\ntransported felon from Bristol, and fell into my hands for a servant.\nHe had led a loose life; that he acknowledged; and being driven to\nextremities, took to the highway, for which, had he been taken, he\nwould have been hanged. But falling into some low-prized rogueries\nafterwards, for want of opportunity for worse, was catched, condemned,\nand transported, and, as he said, was glad he came off so.\n\nHe was an excellent scholar, and I, perceiving it, asked him one time\nif he could give a method how I might learn the Latin tongue. He said,\nsmiling, Yes; he could teach it me in three months, if I would let him\nhave books, or even without books, if he had time. I told him a book\nwould become his hands better than a hoe; and if he could promise to\nmake me but understand Latin enough to read it, and understand other\nlanguages by it, I would ease him of the labour which I was now\nobliged to put him to, especially if I was assured that he was fit to\nreceive that favour of a kind master. In short, I made him to me what\nmy benefactor made me to him, and from him I gained a fund of\nknowledge infinitely more valuable than the rate of a slave, which was\nwhat I had paid for it; but of this hereafter.\n\nWith these thoughts I went cheerfully about my work. As I had now five\nservants, my plantation went on, though gently, yet safely, and\nincreased gradually, though slowly. But the third year, with the\nassistance of my old benefactor, I purchased two negroes more, so that\nnow I had seven servants; and having cured land sufficient for supply\nof their food, I was at no difficulty to maintain them; so that my\nplantation began now to enlarge itself, and as I lived without any\npersonal expense, but was maintained at my old great master's, as we\ncalled him, and at his charge, with \u00c2\u00a330 a year besides, so all my\ngains was laid up for increase.\n\nIn this posture I went on for twelve years, and was very successful in\nmy plantation, and had gotten, by means of my master's favour, who now\nI called my friend, a correspondent in London, with whom I traded,\nshipped over my tobacco to him, and received European goods in return,\nsuch as I wanted to carry on my plantation, and sufficient to sell to\nothers also.\n\nIn this interval my good friend and benefactor died, and I was left\nvery disconsolate on account of my loss; for it was indeed a great\nloss to me. He had been a father to me, and I was like a forsaken\nstranger without him, though I knew the country, and the trade too,\nwell enough, and had for some time chiefly carried on his whole\nbusiness for him. Yet I seemed now at a loss; my counsellor and my\nchief supporter was gone, and I had no confidant to communicate myself\nto, on all occasions, as formerly; but there was no remedy. I was,\nhowever, in a better condition to stand alone than ever. I had a very\nlarge plantation, and had near seventy negroes and other servants. In\na word, I was grown really rich, considering my first circumstances,\nthat began as I may say with nothing; that is to say, I had nothing of\nstock, but I had a great beginning, for I had such a man's friendship\nand support in my beginning, that indeed I needed no other stock; and\nif I had had \u00c2\u00a3500 to have begun with, and not the assistance, advice,\nand countenance of such a man, I had not been in a better condition.\nBut he promised to make a man of me; and so he did, and in one respect\nI may say I have merited it of him, for I brought his plantation into\nsuch order, and the government of his negroes into such a regulation,\nthat if he had given \u00c2\u00a3500 to have had it done, he would have thought\nhis money well bestowed. His work was always in order, going forward\nto his mind; every thing was in a thriving posture; his servants all\nloved him, even negroes and all, and yet there was no such thing as a\ncruel punishment or severities known among them.\n\nIn my own plantation it was the same thing. I wrought so upon the\nreason and the affections of my negroes that they served me\ncheerfully, and, by consequence, faithfully and diligently; when in my\nneighbour's plantation there was not a week hardly passed without such\nhorrible outcries, roarings and yellings of the servants, either under\ntorture or in fear of it, that their negroes would, in discourse with\nours, wish themselves dead and gone, as it seems they believed they\nshould after death, into their own country.\n\nIf I met with a sullen, stupid fellow, as sometimes it was\nunavoidable, I always parted with him and sold him off; for I would\nnot keep any that sense of kind usage would not oblige. But I seldom\nmet with such bad ones; for, by talking to them in a plain reasoning\nway, I found the temper of the roughest of them would break and\nsoften. The sense of their own interest would prevail with them at\nfirst or last; and if it had not, the contrary temper was so general\namong my people that their own fellows and countrymen would be against\nthem, and that served to bring them to reason as soon as any other\nthing. And this those who think it worth their while will easily find,\nviz., that having prevailed effectually over one leading man among\nthem to be tractable, and pleased, and grateful, he shall make them\nall like him, and that in a little while, with more ease than can be\nimagined.\n\nI was now a planter, and also a student. My pedagogue I mentioned\nabove was very diligent, and proved an extraordinary man indeed. He\ntaught me not only with application, but with admirable judgment in\nthe teaching part; for I have seen it in many instances since that\ntime that every good scholar is not fitted for a schoolmaster, and\nthat the art of teaching is quite different from that of knowing the\nlanguage taught.\n\nBut this man had both, and proved of great use to me, and I found\nreason, in the worth of the person, to be very kind to him, his\ncircumstances considered. I once took the liberty to ask him how it\ncame to pass that he, who must have had a liberal education and great\nadvantages to have advanced him in the world, should be capable of\nfalling into such miserable circumstances as he was in when he came\nover. I used some caution in entering upon an inquiry which, as I\nsaid, might not be pleasant to him to relate, but that I would make\nhim amends by telling him, that if he desired not to enter into it\nwith me, I would readily excuse him, and would not take it ill at all.\nThis I did because to a man under such afflictions one should always\nbe tender, and not put them upon relating anything of themselves which\nwas grievous to them or which they had rather was concealed.\n\nBut he told me that it was true, that to look back upon his past life\nwas indeed _renovare dolorem_; but that such mortifications were now\nuseful to him, to help forward that repentance which he hoped he was\nsincerely entered upon; and that though it was with horror he looked\nback upon misspent time and ill-applied gifts which a bountiful\nCreator had blessed him with, and spared to him for a better improvement,\nyet he thought he ought to load himself with as much of the shame as it\npleased God to make his lot, since he had already loaded himself with\nthe guilt in a shameless manner, till God, he still hoped in mercy to\nhim, had cut him short and brought him to public disgrace; though he\ncould not say he had been brought to justice, for then he had been sent\ninto eternity in despair, and not been sent to Virginia to repent of the\nwickedest life that ever man lived. He would have gone on, but I found\nhis speech interrupted by a passionate struggle within, between his\ngrief and his tears.\n\nI took no more notice of it than to tell him that I was sorry I had\nasked him about it, but that it was my curiosity. When I saw that\nignorant, untaught, untractable creatures come into misery and shame,\nI made no inquiry after their affairs; but when I saw men of parts and\nlearning take such steps, I concluded it must be occasioned by\nsomething exceeding wicked. \"So, indeed,\" said he, \"the judge said to\nme when I begged mercy of him in Latin. He told me that when a man\nwith such learning falls into such crimes he is more inexcusable than\nother men, because, his learning recommending him, he could not want\nadvantages and had the less temptation to crimes.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" said he, \"I believe my case was what I find is the case of\nmost of the wicked part of the world, viz., that to be reduced to\nnecessity is to be wicked; for necessity is not only the temptation,\nbut is such a temptation as human nature is not empowered to resist.\nHow good, then,\" says he, \"is that God which takes from you, sir, the\ntemptation, by taking away the necessity!\"\n\nI was so sensible of the truth of what he said, knowing it by my own\ncase, that I could not enter any further upon the discourse; but he\nwent on voluntarily. \"This, sir,\" says he, \"I am so sensible of that I\nthink the case I am reduced to much less miserable than the life which\nI lived before, because I am delivered from the horrid necessity of\ndoing such ill things which was my ruin and disaster then, even for my\nbread, and am not now obliged to ravish my bread out of the mouths of\nothers by violence and disorder, but am fed, though I am made to earn\nit by the hard labour of my hands, and I thank God for the\ndifference.\" He paused here, but went on thus:--\n\n\"How much is the life of a slave in Virginia to be preferred to that\nof the most prosperous thief in the world! Here I live miserable, but\nhonest; suffer wrong, but do no wrong; my body is punished, but my\nconscience is not loaded; and as I used to say that I had no leisure\nto look in, but I would begin when I had some recess, some time to\nspare, now God has found me leisure to repent.\" He run on in this\nmanner a great while, giving thanks, I believe most heartily, for his\nbeing delivered from the wretched life he had lived, though his misery\nwere to be tenfold as much as it was.\n\nI was sincerely touched with his discourse on this subject. I had\nknown so much of the real difference of the case that I could not but\nbe affected with it, though till now, I confess, I knew little of the\nreligious part. I had been an offender as well as he, though not\naltogether in the same degree, but I knew nothing of the penitence;\nneither had I looked back upon anything as a crime, but as a life\ndishonourable and not like a gentleman, which run much in my thoughts,\nas I have several times mentioned.\n\n\"Well, but now,\" says I, \"you talk penitently, and I hope you are\nsincere; but what would be your case if you were delivered from the\nmiserable condition of a slave sold for money, which you are now in?\nShould you not, think you, be the same man?\"\n\n\"Blessed be God,\" says he, \"that, if I thought I should, I would\nsincerely pray that I might not be delivered, and that I might for\never be a slave rather than a sinner.\"\n\n\"Well, but,\" says I, \"suppose you to be under the same necessity, in\nthe same starving condition, should you not take the same course?\"\n\nHe replied very sharply, \"That shows us the need we have of the\npetition in the Lord's prayer, 'Lead us not into temptation;' and of\nSolomon's or Agar's prayer, 'Give me not poverty, lest I steal.' I\nshould ever beg of God not to be left to such snares as human nature\ncannot resist. But I have some hope, that I should venture to starve\nrather than to steal; but I also beg to be delivered from the danger,\nbecause I know not my own strength.\"\n\nThis was honestly spoken, indeed; and there really were such visible\ntokens of sincerity in all his discourse that I could not suspect him.\nOn some of our discourses on this subject, he pulled out a little\ndirty paper-book, in which he had wrote down such a prayer in verse as\nI doubt few Christians in the world could subscribe to; and I cannot\nbut record it, because I never saw anything like it in my life. The\nlines are as follow:--\n\n\n    \"Lord! whatsoever sorrows rack my breast,\n     Till crime removes too, let me find no rest;\n     How dark soe'er my state or sharp my pain,\n     Oh! let not troubles cease and sin remain.\n     For Jesus' sake remove not my distress,\n     Till free triumphant grace shall repossess\n     The vacant throne from whence my sins depart,\n     And make a willing captive of my heart;\n     Till grace completely shall my soul subdue,\n     Thy conquest full and my subjection true.\"\n\n\nThere were more lines on the same subject, but these were the\nbeginning; and these touching me so sensibly, I have remembered them\ndistinctly ever since, and have, I believe, repeated them to myself a\nthousand times.\n\nI pressed him no more, you may be sure, after an answer so very\nparticular and affecting as this was. It was easy to see the man was a\nsincere penitent, not sorrowing for the punishment he was suffering\nunder; for his condition was no part of his affliction; he was rather\nthankful for it, as above; but his concern was a feeling and affecting\nsense of the wicked and abominable life he had led, the abhorred\ncrimes he had committed both against God and man, and the little sense\nhe had had of the condition he was in, and that even till he came to\nthe place where he now was.\n\nI asked him if he had no reflections of this kind after or before his\nsentence. He told me Newgate (for the prison at Bristol is called so,\nit seems, as well as that at London) was a place that seldom made\npenitents, but often made villains worse, till they learnt to defy God\nand devil; but that, however, he could look back with this\nsatisfaction, that he could say he was not altogether insensible of it\neven then; but nothing that amounted to a thorough serious looking up\nto heaven; that he often indeed looked in, and reflected upon his past\nmisspent life, even before he was in prison, when the intervals of his\nwicked practices gave some time for reflection, and he would sometimes\nsay to himself, \"Whither am I going? to what will all these things\nbring me at last? and where will they end? Sin and shame follow one\nanother, and I shall certainly come to the gallows. Then,\" said he, \"I\nwould strike upon my breast, and say, 'O wicked wretch! when will you\nrepent?' and would answer myself as often, 'Never! never! never!\nexcept it be in a gaol or at a gibbet.'\n\n\"Then,\" said he, \"I would weep and sigh, and look back a little upon\nmy wretched life, the history of which would make the world amazed;\nbut, alas! the prospect was so dark, and it filled me with so much\nterror, that I could not bear it. Then I would fly to wine and company\nfor relief; that wine brought on excess, and that company, being\nalways wicked company like yourself, brought on temptation, and then\nall reflection vanished and I was the same devil as before.\"\n\nHe spoke this with so much affection that his face was ever smiling\nwhen he talked of it, and yet his eyes had tears standing in them at\nthe same time, and all the time; for he had a delightful sorrow, if\nthat be a proper expression, in speaking of it.\n\nThis was a strange relation to me, and began to affect me after a\nmanner that I did not understand. I loved to hear him talk of it, and\nyet it always left a kind of a dead lump behind it upon my heart,\nwhich I could give no reason for, nor imagine to what it should tend;\nI had a heaviness on my soul, without being able to describe it or to\nsay what ailed me.\n\nWell, he went on with his relation. \"After this,\" says he, \"I fell\ninto the hands of a justice for a trifle, a piece of sport in our\ncrime; and I, that for a hundred robberies, as well on the highway as\notherwise, the particulars of which would fill a book to give an\naccount of, ought, whenever I was taken, to be hanged in chains, and\nwho, if it had been public, could not have failed of having twenty\npeople come in against me, was privately hurried into a country gaol\nunder a wrong name; tried for a small fact, within benefit of clergy,\nand in which I was not principally guilty, and by this means obtained\nthe favour of being transported.\n\n\"And what think you,\" said he, \"has most sensibly affected me, and\nbrought on the blessed change that, I hope I may say, God has wrought\nin my soul? Not the greatness of my crimes, but the wonders of that\nmerciful Providence, which, when it has mercy in store for a man,\noften brings him into the briers, into sorrow and misery for lesser\nsins, that men may be led to see how they are spared from the\npunishment due to them for the greater guilt which they know lies upon\nthem. Do you think that when I received the grant of transportation I\ncould be insensible what a miracle of divine goodness such a thing\nmust be to one who had so many ways deserved to be hanged, and must\ninfallibly have died if my true name had been known, or if the least\nnotice had been given that it was such a notorious wretch as I that\nwas in custody? There began the first motive of repentance; for\ncertainly the goodness of our great Creator in sparing us, when we\nforfeit our lives to His justice, and His merciful bringing us out of\nthe miseries which we plunge ourselves into, when we have no way to\nextricate ourselves; His bringing those very miseries to be the means\nof our deliverance, and working good to us out of evil, when we are\nworking the very evil out of His good; I say, these things are\ncertainly the strongest motives to repentance that are in the world,\nand the sparing thieves from the gallows certainly makes more\npenitents than the gallows itself.\n\n\"It is true,\" continued he, \"that the terror of punishment works\nstrongly upon the mind; in view of death men are filled with horror of\nsoul, and immediately they call that repentance which I doubt is too\noften mistaken, being only a kind of anguish in the soul, which breeds\na grief for the punishment that is to be suffered--an amazement\nfounded upon the dreadful view of what is to follow. But the sense of\nmercy is quite another thing; this seizes all the passions and all the\naffections, and works a sincere, unfeigned abhorrence of the crime, as\na crime, as an offence against our Benefactor, as an act of baseness\nand ingratitude to Him who has given us life and all the blessings and\ncomforts of life, and who has conquered us by continuing to do us\ngood, when He has been provoked to destroy us.\n\n\"This, sir,\" says he, \"has been the fountain of that repentance which\nI so much rejoice in; this is the delightful sorrow,\" says he, \"that I\nspoke of just now; and this makes smiles sit on my face while tears\nrun from my eyes, a joy that I can no otherwise express than by\ntelling you, sir, that I never lived a happy day since I came to an\nage of acting in the world till I landed in this country, and worked\nin your plantation, naked and hungry, weary and faint, oppressed with\ncold in one season, and heat in the other. Then I began to see into my\nown ways, and see the difference between the hardships of the body and\nthe torment of the mind. Before I revelled in fulness, and here I\nstruggled with hard fare; then I wallowed in sloth and voluptuous\nease; here I laboured till nature sometimes was just sinking under the\nload; but with this difference in the felicity of either case, namely,\nthat there I had a hell in my soul, was filled with horror and\nconfusion, was a daily terror to myself, and always expected a\nmiserable end; whereas here I had a blessed calm of soul, an emblem\nand forerunner of heaven, thankful and humble, adoring that mercy that\nhad snatched me out of the jaws of the devil. These took up my\nthoughts, and made my most weary hours pleasant to me, my labour\nlight, and my heart cheerful. I never lay down on my hard lodging but\nI praised God with the greatest excess of affection, not only that it\nwas not the condemned hole, and that I was delivered from the death I\nhad deserved, but that it was not Shooter's Hill; that I was not still\na robber, a terror to just and honest men, a plunderer of the innocent\nand the poor, a thief, and a villain, that ought to be rooted out from\nthe earth for the safety of others; but that I was delivered from the\nhorrid temptation of sinning to support my luxury, and making one vice\nnecessary to another; and this, I bear witness, is sufficient to\nsweeten the bitterest sorrow, and make any man be thankful for\nVirginia, or a worse place, if that can be.\"\n\nHe then entertained me with an opinion of his, that if it were\npossible for the face of heaven and hell to be disclosed and laid\nopen, and that men could be made capable of seeing distinctly and\nseparately the joys and glory and utmost felicity of one, and the\nhorrors of the other, and to make a judgment of both according to the\npower of human reasoning, the first would have a stronger and more\npowerful effect to reform the world than the latter; but this we had\nfurther discourses about on many occasions.\n\nIf it should be inquired how I was capable of hearing all this, and\nhaving no impressions made upon my mind by it, especially when it so\nmany ways suited my own case, and the condition of the former part of\nmy life, I shall answer that presently by myself. However, I took no\nnotice of it to him, for he had quite other notions of me than I had\nof myself; nor did I, as is usual in such cases, enter into any\nconfidence with him on my own story, only that I took sometimes the\noccasion to let him know that I did not come over to Virginia in the\ncapacity of a criminal, or that I was not transported; which,\nconsidering how many of the inhabitants there were so who then lived\nin good circumstances, was needful enough to be done.\n\nBut as to myself, it was enough that I was in condition now; 'twas no\nmatter to anybody what I had been; and as it was grown pretty much out\nof memory from what original disaster I came into the country, or that\nI was ever a servant otherwise than voluntary, and that it was no\nbusiness of mine to expose myself, so I kept that part close. But for\nall that, it was impossible for me to conceal the disorder I was in as\noften as he talked of these things. I had hitherto gone on upon a\nnotion of things founded only in their appearance, as they affected me\nwith good or evil, esteeming the happy and unhappy part of life to be\nthose that gave me ease or sorrow, without regarding, or indeed much\nunderstanding, how far those turns of life were influenced by the\nGiver of Life, or how far they were all directed by a sovereign God\nthat governs the world, and all the creatures he had made.\n\nAs I had no education but as you have heard, so I had had no\ninstruction, no knowledge of religion, or indeed of the meaning of it;\nand though I was now in a kind of search after religion, it was a mere\nlooking, as it were, into the world to see what kind of a thing or\nplace it was, and what had been done in it. But as to Him that made\nit, there had truly been scarce a creature among all that He had made,\nwith souls in them, that were so entirely without the knowledge of God\nas I was, and made so little inquiry about it.\n\nBut the serious, affectionate discourse of this young man began to\nhave different effects upon me, and I began to say to myself, \"This\nman's reflections are certainly very just; but what a creature am I,\nand what have I been doing!--I that never once did this in all my\nlife; that never said so much--'God, I thank Thee for all that I have\nbeen saved from, or all that I have been brought to in this world;'\nand yet my life has been as full of variety, and I have been as\nmiraculously delivered from dangers and mischiefs, and as many of\nthem, as ever he has. And if it has all been brought to pass by an\ninvisible hand in mercy to me, what have I been doing, and where have\nI lived, that I only should be the most thoughtless and unthankful of\nall God's creatures?\"\n\nThis, indeed, began to grow upon me, and made me very melancholy; but\nas to religion, I understood so little about it that if I had resolved\nupon any such thing as a new course of life, or to set about a\nreligious change, I knew not at which end to begin or what to do about\nit.\n\nOne day it happened that my tutor--for so I always called him--had the\nBible in his hand, and was looking in it, as he generally did many\ntimes every day, though I knew not for what. Seeing the Bible, I took\nit out of his hands, and went to look in it, which I had done so\nlittle before that I think I might safely say I had never read a\nchapter in it in all my life. He was talking of the Bible then as a\nbook only, and where he had it, and how he brought it to Virginia, and\nin some ecstasy he took and kissed it. \"This blessed book!\" says he;\n\"this was all the treasure I brought out from England with me. And a\ncomfortable treasure it has been to me,\" added he; \"I would not have\nbeen without it in my sorrows for any other treasure in the world;\"\nand so he went on at large.\n\nI, that had no notion of what he meant--only, as I have said above,\nsome young infant thoughts about the works of Providence in the world\nand its merciful dealings with me--took the book out of his hand and\nwent to look in it; and the book opened at the Acts xxvi. 28, where\nFelix says to St. Paul, \"Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.\"\n\"I think,\" says I, \"here's a line hits me to a tittle, upon the long\naccount you have given of yourself, and I must say them to you, as the\ngovernor here said;\" and so I read the words to him. He blushed at the\ntext, and returns, \"I wish I could answer you in the very words the\nApostle returned to him in the next verse: 'I would thou wert both\nalmost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.'\"\n\nI was now more than thirty years old by my own account, and as well as\nit was possible for me to keep a reckoning of my age, who had nobody\nleft that ever knew my beginning; I was, I say, above thirty years\nold, and had gone through some variety in the world. But as I was\nperfectly abandoned in my infancy, and utterly without instruction in\nmy youth, so I was entirely ignorant of everything that was worthy the\nname of religion in the world; and this was the first time that ever\nany notion of religious things entered into my heart. I was surprised\nat this man's talk, and that several ways particularly he talked so\nfeelingly of his past circumstances, and they were so like my own,\nthat every time he made a religious inference from his own condition,\nand argued from one condition of his to another, it struck into my\nthoughts like a bullet from a gun that I had certainly as much to be\nthankful for and to repent of as he had, except only that I had no\nknowledge of better things to be thankful for, which he had. But in\nreturn for that, I was delivered and set up in the world, made a\nmaster, and easy, and was in good circumstances, being raised from the\nvery same low, distressed condition as he was in--I mean a sold\nservant--but that he remained so still; so that, if his sin had been\ngreater than mine, so his distress was still greater.\n\nThis article of gratitude struck deep and lay heavy upon my mind. I\nremembered that I was grateful to the last degree to my old master,\nwho had raised me from my low condition, and that I loved the very\nname of him, or, as might be said, the very ground he trod on; but I\nhad not so much as once thought of any higher obligation; no, nor so\nmuch as, like the Pharisee, had said once, \"God, I thank thee,\" to\nHim, for all the influence which His providence must have had in my\nwhole affair.\n\nIt occurred to me presently that if none of all these things befall us\nwithout the direction of a Divine Power, as my new instructor had told\nme at large, and that God had ordered everything, the most minute and\nleast transaction of life, insomuch that not a hair of our head shall\nfall to the ground without His permission; I say, it occurred to me\nthat I had been a most unthankful dog to that Providence that had done\nso much for me; and the consequence of the reflection was immediately\nthis: how justly may that Power, so disobliged, take away again His\nwool and His flax, with which I am now clothed, and reduce me to the\nmisery of my first circumstances.\n\nThis perplexed me much, and I was very pensive and sad; in which,\nhowever, my new instructor was a constant comforter to me, and I\nlearned every day something or other from him; upon which I told him\none morning that I thought be must leave off teaching me Latin, and\nteach me religion. He spoke with a great deal of modesty of his being\nincapable of informing me of anything that I did not know, and\nproposed to me to read the Scriptures every day, as the sure and only\nfund of instruction. I answered that, in the words of the eunuch to\nSt. Philip when the apostle asked him if he understood what he read:\n\"How can I, unless some one guide me?\"\n\nWe talked frequently upon this subject, and I found so much reason to\nbelieve he was a sincere convert that I can speak of him as no other\nin all I have to say of him. However, I cannot say my thoughts were\nyet ripened for an operation of that kind. I had some uneasiness about\nmy past life, and I lived now, and had done so before I knew him, a\nvery regular, sober life, always taken up in my business and running\ninto no excesses. But as to commencing penitent, as this man had done,\nI cannot say I had any convictions upon me sufficient to bring it on,\nnor had I a fund of religious knowledge to support me in it. So it\nwore off again gradually, as such things generally do where the first\nimpressions are not deep enough.\n\nIn the meantime, as he read over long lectures of his own disasters to\nme, and applied them all seriously to me, so our discourse was always\nvery solid and weighty, and we had nothing of levity between us, even\nwhen we were not concerned in religious discourses. He read history to\nme; and, where books were wanting, he gave me ideas of those things\nwhich had not been recorded by our modern histories, or at least that\nour number of books would not reach. By these things he raised an\nunquenchable thirst in me, after seeing something that was doing in\nthe world; and the more because all the world was at that time\nengaged, more or less, in the great war wherein the French king might\nbe said to be engaged with and against all the powers of Europe.\n\nNow, I looked upon myself as one buried alive in a remote part of the\nworld, where I could see nothing at all, and hear but a little of what\nwas seen, and that little not till at least half a year after it was\ndone, and sometimes a year or more; and, in a word, the old reproach\noften came in the way--namely, that even this was not yet the life of\na gentleman.\n\nIt was true that this was much nearer to it than that of a pickpocket,\nand still nearer than that of a sold slave; but, in short, this would\nnot do, and I could receive no satisfaction in it. I had now a second\nplantation, a very considerable one, and it went forward very well. I\nhad on it almost a hundred servants already of sundry sorts, and an\noverseer that I had a great deal of reason to say I might depend upon,\nand but that I had a third in embryo, and newly begun, I had nothing\nto hinder me from going where I pleased.\n\nHowever, I now began to frame my thoughts for a voyage to England,\nresolving then to act as I should see cause, but with a secret\nresolution to see more of the world if possible, and realise those\nthings to my mind which I had hitherto only entertained remote ideas\nof by the help of books.\n\nAccordingly I pushed forward the settlement of my third plantation, in\norder to bring it to be in a posture either to be let to a tenant or\nleft in trust with an overseer, as I should find occasion.\n\nHad I resolved to leave it to an overseer or steward, no man in the\nworld could have been fit for it like my tutor; but I could not think\nof parting with him, who was the cause of my desire of travelling, and\nwho I concluded to make my partner in my travels.\n\n\n\nEND OF VOL. I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE.\n\n\nIt was three years after this before I could get things in order, fit\nfor my leaving the country. In this time I delivered my tutor from his\nbondage, and would have given him his liberty, but, to my great\ndisappointment, I found that I could not empower him to go for England\ntill his time was expired, according to the certificate of his\ntransportation, which was registered; so I made him one of my\noverseers, and thereby raised him gradually to a prospect of living in\nthe same manner and by the like steps that my good benefactor raised\nme, only that I did not assist him to enter upon planting for himself\nas I was assisted, neither was I upon the spot to do it. But this\nman's diligence and honest application, even unassisted, delivered\nhimself, [though not] any farther than, as I say, by making him an\noverseer, which was only a present ease and deliverance to him from\nthe hard labour and fare which he endured as a servant.\n\nHowever, in this trust he behaved so faithfully and so diligently that\nit recommended him in the country; and when I came back I found him in\ncircumstances very different from what I left him in, besides his\nbeing my principal manager for near twenty years, as you shall hear in\nits place.\n\nI mention these things the more at large that, if any unhappy wretch\nwho may have the disaster to fall into such circumstances as these may\ncome to see this account, they may learn the following short lessons\nfrom these examples:--\n\nI. That Virginia and a state of transportation may be the happiest\nplace and condition they were ever in for this life, as, by a sincere\nrepentance and a diligent application to the business they are put to,\nthey are effectually delivered from a life of flagrant wickedness and\nput in a perfect new condition, in which they have no temptation to\nthe crimes they formerly committed, and have a prospect of advantage\nfor the future.\n\nII. That in Virginia the meanest and most despicable creature, after\nhis time of servitude is expired, if he will but apply himself with\ndiligence and industry to the business of the country, is sure (life\nand health supposed) both of living well and growing rich.\n\nAs this is a foundation which the most unfortunate wretch alive is\nentitled to, a transported felon is, in my opinion, a much happier man\nthan the most prosperous untaken thief in the nation. Nor are those\npoor young people so much in the wrong as some imagine them to be that\ngo voluntarily over to those countries, and in order to get themselves\ncarried over and placed there, freely bind themselves there,\nespecially if the persons into whose hands they fall do anything\nhonestly by them; for, as it is to be supposed that those poor people\nknew not what course to take before, or had miscarried in their\nconduct before, here they are sure to be immediately provided for,\nand, after the expiration of their time, to be put in a condition to\nprovide for themselves. But I return to my own story, which now begins\na new scene.\n\nI was now making provision for my going to England. After having\nsettled my plantation in such hands as was fully to my satisfaction,\nmy first work was to furnish myself with such a stock of goods and\nmoney as might be sufficient for my occasions abroad, and particularly\nmight allow me to make large returns to Maryland, for the use and\nsupply of all my plantations. But when I came to look nearer into the\nvoyage, it occurred to me that it would not be prudent to put my cargo\nall on board the same ship that I went in; so I shipped at several\ntimes five hundred hogsheads of tobacco in several ships for England,\ngiving notice to my correspondent in London that I would embark about\nsuch a time to come over myself, and ordering him to insure for a\nconsiderable sum, proportioned to the value of my cargo.\n\nAbout two months after this I left the place, and embarked for England\nin a stout ship, carrying twenty-four guns and about six hundred\nhogsheads of tobacco, and we left the capes of Virginia on the 1st of\nAugust. We had a very sour and rough voyage for the first fortnight,\nthough it was in a season so generally noted for good weather.\n\nAfter we had been about eleven days at sea, having the wind most part\nof the time blowing very hard at west, or between the west and\nnorth-west, by which we were carried a great way farther to the\neastward than they usually go in their course for England, we met with\na furious tempest, which held us five days, blowing most of the time\nexcessive hard, and by which we were obliged to run away afore the\nwind, as the seamen call it, wheresoever it was our lot to go. By this\nstorm our ship was greatly damaged, and some leaks we had, but not so\nbad that by the diligence of the seamen they were stopped. However,\nthe captain, after having beaten up again as well as he could against\nthe weather, and the sea going very high, at length he resolved to go\naway for the Bermudas.\n\nI was not seaman enough to understand what the reason of their\ndisputes was, but in their running for the islands it seems they\novershot the latitude, and could never reach the islands of Bermudas\nagain. The master and the mate differed to an extremity about this,\ntheir reckonings being more than usually wide of one another, the\nstorm having driven them a little out of their knowledge. The master,\nbeing a positive man, insulted the mate about it, and threatened to\nexpose him for it when he came to England. The mate was an excellent\nsea artist and an experienced sailor, but withal a modest man, and\nthough he insisted upon his being right, did it in respectful terms\nand as it became him. But after several days' dispute, when the\nweather came to abate and the heavens to clear up, that they could\ntake their observations and know where they were, it appeared that the\nmate's account was right, and the captain was mistaken; for they were\nthen in the latitude of 29 degrees, and quite out of the wake of the\nBermudas.\n\nThe mate made no indecent use of the discovery at all, and the\ncaptain, being convinced, carried it civilly to him, and so the heats\nwere over among them; but the next question was, what they should do\nnext. Some were for going one way, some another; but all agreed that\nthey were not in a condition to go on the direct course for England,\nunless they could have a southerly or south-west wind, which had not\nbeen our fate since we came to sea.\n\nUpon the whole, they resolved by consent to steer away to the\nCanaries, which was the nearest land they could make except the Cape\nde Verde Islands, which were too much to the southward for us, if it\ncould be avoided.\n\nUpon this they stood away N.E., and the wind hanging still westerly,\nor to the northward of the west, we made good way, and in about\nfifteen days' sail we made the Pico Teneriffe, being a monstrous hill\nin one of the Canary Islands. Here we refreshed ourselves, got fresh\nwater and some fresh provisions, and plenty of excellent wine, but no\nharbour to run into, to take care of the ship, which was leaky and\ntender, having had so much very bad weather; so we were obliged to do\nas well as we could, and put to sea again, after riding at the\nCanaries four days only.\n\nFrom the Canaries we had tolerable weather and a smooth sea till we\ncame into the soundings--so they call the mouth of the British\nChannel--and the wind blowing hard at the N. and the N.W. obliged us\nto keep a larger offing, as the seamen call it, at our entrance into\nthe Channel; when, behold! in the grey of the morning a French cruiser\nor privateer of twenty-six guns appeared, and crowded after us with\nall the sail they could make. In short, our captain exchanged a\nbroadside or two with them, which was terrible work to me, for I had\nnever seen such before, the Frenchman's guns having raked us, and\nkilled and wounded six of our best men.\n\nIn short, after a fight long enough to show us that if we would not be\ntaken we must resolve to sink by her side, for there was no room to\nexpect deliverance, and a fight long enough to save the master's\ncredit, we were taken, and the ship carried away to St. Malo.\n\nI was not much concerned for the loss I had in the ship, because I\nknew I had sufficient in the world somewhere or other; but as I was\neffectually stripped of everything I had about me, and even almost my\nclothes from my back, I was in but a very indifferent condition. But\nsomebody informing the captain of the privateer, that I was a\npassenger and a merchant, he called for me and inquired into my\ncircumstances, and coming to hear from myself how I had been used,\nobliged the seamen to give me a coat and hat and a pair of shoes,\nwhich they had taken off me, and himself gave me a morning gown of his\nown to wear while I was in his ship, and, to give him his due, treated\nme very well.\n\nI had, however, besides my being taken, the mortification to be\ndetained on board the cruiser, and seeing the ship I was in manned\nwith Frenchmen and sent away, as above, for St. Malo; and this was a\ngreater mortification to me afterwards, when, being brought into St.\nMalo, I heard that our own ship was retaken in her passage to St. Malo\nby an English man-of-war and carried to Portsmouth.\n\nWhen our ship was sent away the _Rover_ cruised abroad again in the\nmouth of the Channel for some time, but met with no purchase. At last\nthey made a sail, which proved to be one of their nation and one of\ntheir own trade, from whom they learned, the news having been carried\nto England that some French privateers lay off and on in the\nsoundings, that three English men-of-war were come out from Plymouth\non purpose to cruise in the Channel, and that they would certainly\nmeet with us. Upon this intelligence the Frenchman, a bold, brave\nfellow, far from shrinking from his work, stands away N.E. for St.\nGeorge's Channel, and in the latitude of 48 degrees and a half,\nunhappily enough, meets with a large and rich English ship, bound home\nfrom Jamaica. It was in the grey of the morning, and very clear, when\na man on the roundtop cried out, \"_Au voile_, a sail.\" I was in hopes\nindeed it had been the English men-of-war, and by the hurry and\nclutter they were in to get all ready for a fight, I concluded it was\nso, and got out of my hammock (for I had no cabin to lie in) that I\nmight see what it was; but I soon found that my hopes were in vain,\nand it was on the wrong side; for that that being on our larboard bow,\nthe ship lying then northward to make the coast of Ireland, by the\ntime I was turned out I could perceive they had all their sails bent\nand full, having begun to chase, and making great way. On the other\nhand, it was evident the ship saw them too, and knew what they were,\nand, to avoid them, stretched away with all the canvas they could lay\non for the coast of Ireland, to run in there for harbour.\n\nOur privateer, it was plain, infinitely outsailed her, running two\nfoot for her one, and towards evening came up with them. Had they been\nable to have held it but six hours longer they would have got into\nLimerick River, or somewhere under shore, so that we should not have\nventured upon them. But we came up with them, and the captain, when he\nsaw there was no remedy, bravely brought to and prepared to fight. She\nwas a ship of thirty guns, but deep in the sea, cumbered between decks\nwith goods, and could not run out her lower-deck guns, the sea also\ngoing pretty high, though at last she ventured to open her gun-room\nports and fire with three guns on a side. But her worst fate was, she\nsailed heavy, being deep loaden, and the Frenchman had run up by her\nside and poured in his broadside, and was soon ready again. However,\nas she was well manned too, and that the English sailors bestirred\nthemselves, they gave us their broadsides too very nimbly and\nheartily, and I found the Frenchman had a great many men killed at the\nfirst brush. But the next was worse, for the English ship, though she\ndid not sail so well as the Frenchman, was a bigger ship and strong\nbuilt, and as we (the French) bore down upon them again, the English\nrun boldly on board us, and laid thwart our hawse, lashing themselves\nfast to us. Then it was that the English captain run out his lower\ntier of guns, and indeed tore the Frenchman so, that, had he held it,\nthe privateer would have had the worst of it. But the Frenchman, with\nadmirable readiness, indeed, and courage, the captain appearing\neverywhere with his sword in his hand, bestirred themselves, and\nloosing themselves from the English ship, thrusting her off with\nbrooms, and pouring their small shot so thick that the other could not\nappear upon deck; I say, clearing themselves thus, they came to lie\na-broadside of each other, when, by long firing, the English ship was\nat length disabled, her mizzen-mast and bowsprit shot away, and, which\nwas worst of all, her captain killed; so that, after a fight which\nheld all night--for they fought in the dark--and part of the next day,\nthey were obliged to strike.\n\nI was civilly desired by the French captain to go down into the hold\nwhile the fight held, and, besides the civility of it, I found he was\nnot willing I should be upon deck. Perhaps he thought I might have\nsome opportunity to do hurt, though I know not how it could be.\nHowever, I was very ready to go down, for I had no mind to be killed,\nespecially by my own friends; so I went down and sat by the surgeon,\nand had the opportunity to find that, the first broadside the English\nfired, seven wounded men were brought down to the surgeon, and\nthree-and-thirty more afterwards, that is to say, when the English lay\nthwart their bow; and after they cleared themselves there were about\neleven more; so that they had one-and-fifty men wounded and about\ntwo-and-twenty killed. The Englishman had eighteen men killed and\nwounded, among whom was the captain.\n\nThe French captain, however, triumphed in his prize; for it was an\nexceeding rich ship, having abundance of silver on board. And after\nthe ship was taken and they had plundered all the great cabin\nafforded, which was very considerable, the mate promised the captain\nthat, if he would give him his liberty, he would discover six thousand\npieces of eight to him privately, which none of the men should know\nof. The captain engaged, and gave it under his hand to set him at\nliberty as soon as he came on shore. Accordingly, in the night, after\nall was either turned in, as they call it, or employed on the duty of\nthe watch, the captain and the mate of the prize went on board, and\nhaving faithfully discovered the money, which lay in a place made on\npurpose to conceal it, the captain resolved to let it lie till they\narrived, and then he conveyed it on shore for his own use; so that the\nowners, nor the seamen, ever came to any share of it, which, by the\nway, was a fraud in the captain. But the mate paid his ransom by the\ndiscovery, and the captain gave him his liberty very punctually, as he\nhad promised, and two hundred pieces of eight to carry him to England\nand to make good his losses.\n\nWhen he had made this prize, the captain thought of nothing more than\nhow to get safe to France with her, for she was a ship sufficient to\nenrich all his men and his owners also. The account of her cargo, by\nthe captain's books, of which I took a copy, was in general:\n\n\n       260 hogsheads of sugar.\n       187 smaller casks of sugar.\n       176 barrels of indigo.\n        28 casks of pimento.\n        42 bags of cotton wool.\n        80 cwt. of elephants' teeth.\n        60 small casks of rum.\n    18,000 pieces of eight, besides the six thousand concealed.\nSeveral parcels of drugs, tortoise-shell, sweetmeats, called succades,\nchocolate, lime juice, and other things of considerable value.\n\n\nThis was a terrible loss among the English merchants, and a noble\nbooty for the rogues that took it; but as it was in open war and by\nfair fighting, as they call it, there was no objection to be made\nagainst them, and, to give them their due, they fought bravely for it.\n\nThe captain was not so bold as to meeting the English men-of-war\nbefore, but he was as wary now; for, having a prize of such value in\nhis hands, he was resolved not to lose her again, if he could help it.\nSo he stood away to the southward, and that so far that I once thought\nhe was resolved to go into the Straits, and home by Marseilles. But\nhaving sailed to the latitude of 45 degrees 3 quarters, or\nthereabouts, he steered away east, into the bottom of the Bay of\nBiscay, and carried us all into the river of Bordeaux, where, on\nnotice of his arrival with such a prize, his owners or principals came\noverland to see him, and where they consulted what to do with her. The\nmoney they secured, to be sure, and some of the cargo; but the ships\nsailed afterwards along the coast to St. Malo, taking the opportunity\nof some French men-of-war which were cruising on the coast to be their\nconvoy as far as Ushant.\n\nHere the captain rewarded and dismissed the English mate, as I have\nsaid, who got a passage from thence to Dieppe by sea, and after that\ninto England, by the help of a passport, through Flanders to Ostend.\nThe captain, it seems, the more willingly shipped him off that he\nmight not discover to others what he had discovered to him.\n\nI was now at Bordeaux, in France, and the captain asked me one morning\nwhat I intended to do. I did not understand him at first, but he soon\ngave me to understand that I was now either to be delivered up to the\nstate as an English prisoner, and so be carried to Dinan, in Brittany,\nor to find means to have myself exchanged, or to pay my ransom, and\nthis ransom he told me at first was three hundred crowns.\n\nI knew not what to do, but desired he would give me time to write to\nEngland to my friends; for that I had a cargo of goods sent to them by\nme from Virginia, but I did not know but it might have fallen into\nsuch hands as his were, and if it was, I knew not what would be my\nfate. He readily granted that; so I wrote by the post, and had the\nsatisfaction, in answer to it, to hear that the ship I was taken in\nhad been retaken, and carried into Portsmouth; which I doubted would\nhave made my new master more strict, and perhaps insolent; but he said\nnothing of it to me, nor I to him, though, as I afterwards understood,\nhe had advice of it before.\n\nHowever, this was a help to me, and served to more than pay my ransom\nto the captain. And my correspondent in London, hearing of my being\nalive and at Bordeaux, immediately sent me a letter of credit upon an\nEnglish merchant at Bordeaux for whatever I might have occasion for.\nAs soon as I received this I went to the merchant, who honoured the\nletter of credit, and told me I should have what money I pleased. But\nas I, who was before a mere stranger in the place and knew not what\ncourse to take, had now, as it were, a friend to communicate my\naffairs to and consult with, as soon as I told him my case, \"Hold,\"\nsays he; \"if that be your case, I may perhaps find a way to get you\noff without a ransom.\"\n\nThere was, it seems, a ship bound home to France from Martinico, taken\noff Cape Finisterre by an English man-of-war, and a merchant of\nRochelle, being a passenger, was taken on board, and brought into\nPlymouth. This man had made great solicitation by his friends to be\nexchanged, pleading poverty, and that he was unable to pay any ransom.\nMy friend told me something of it, but not much, only bade me not be\ntoo forward to pay any money to the captain, but pretend I could not\nhear from England. This I did till the captain appeared impatient.\n\nAfter some time the captain told me I had used him ill; that I had\nmade him expect a ransom, and he had treated me courteously and been\nat expense to subsist me, and that I held him in suspense, but that,\nin short, if I did not procure the money, he would send me to Dinan in\nten days, to lie there as the king's prisoner till I should be\nexchanged. My merchant gave me my cue, and by his direction I answered\nI was very sensible of his civility, and sorry he should lose what\nexpenses he had been at, but that I found my friends forgot me, and\nwhat to do I did not know, and that, rather than impose upon him, I\nmust submit to go to Dinan, or where he thought fit to send me; but\nthat if ever I obtained my liberty, and came into England, I would not\nfail to reimburse him what expense he had been at for my subsistence;\nand so, in short, made my case very bad in all my discourse. He shook\nhis head and said little, but the next day entered me in the list of\nEnglish prisoners to be at the king's charge, as appointed by the\nintendant of the place, and to be sent away into Brittany.\n\nI was then out of the captain's power, and immediately the merchant,\nwith two others who were friends to the merchant prisoner at Plymouth,\nwent to the intendant and gained an order for the exchange, and my\nfriend giving security for my being forthcoming, in case the other was\nnot delivered, I had my liberty immediately, and went home with him to\nhis house.\n\nThus we bilked the captain of his ransom money. But, however, my\nfriend went to him, and letting him know that I was exchanged by the\ngovernor's order, paid him whatever he could say he was in disburse on\nmy account; and it was not then in the captain's power to object, or\nto claim anything for a ransom.\n\nI got passage from hence to Dunkirk on board a French vessel, and\nhaving a certificate of an exchanged prisoner from the intendent at\nBordeaux, I had a passport given me to go into the Spanish\nNetherlands, and so whither I pleased.\n\nAccordingly I came to Ghent, in April----, just as the armies were\ngoing to take the field. I had no dislike to the business of the army,\nbut I thought I was a little above it now, and had other things to\nlook to; for that, in my opinion, nobody went into the field but those\nthat could not live at home. And yet I resolved to see the manner of\nit a little too, so, having made an acquaintance with an English\nofficer quartered at Ghent, I told him my intention, and he invited me\nto go with him, and offered me his protection as a volunteer, that I\nshould quarter with him in his tent, and live as I would, and either\ncarry arms or not, as I saw occasion.\n\nThe campaign was none of the hardest that had been, or was like to be;\nso that I had the diversion of seeing the service, as it was proper to\ncall it, without much hazard. Indeed I did not see any considerable\naction, for there was not much fighting that campaign. As to the merit\nof the cause on either side, I knew nothing of it, nor had I suffered\nany of the disputes about it to enter into my thoughts. The Prince of\nOrange had been made king of England, and the English troops were all\non his side; and I heard a great deal of swearing and damning for King\nWilliam among the soldiers. But as for fighting, I observed the French\nbeat them several times, and particularly the regiment my friend\nbelonged to was surrounded in a village where they were posted, I knew\nnot upon what occasion, and all taken prisoners. But by great good\nhap, I, being not in service, and so not in command, was strolled away\nthat day to see the country about; for it was my delight to see the\nstrong towns, and observe the beauty of their fortifications; and\nwhile I diverted myself thus, I had the happy deliverance of not being\ntaken by the French for that time.\n\nWhen I came back I found the enemy possessed of the town, but as I\nwas no soldier they did me no harm, and having my French passport in\nmy pocket, they gave me leave to go to Nieuport, where I took the\npacket-boat and came over to England, landing at Deal instead of\nDover, the weather forcing us into the Downs; and thus my short\ncampaign ended, and this was my second essay at the trade of\nsoldiering.\n\nWhen I came to London I was very well received by my friend, to\nwhom I had consigned my effects, and I found myself in very good\ncircumstances; for all my goods, which, as above, by several ships, I\nhad consigned to him, came safe to hand; and my overseers that I had\nleft behind had shipped at several times four hundred hogsheads of\ntobacco to my correspondent in my absence, being the product of my\nplantation, or part of it, for the time of my being abroad; so that I\nhad above \u00c2\u00a31000 in my factor's hands, two hundred hogsheads of tobacco\nbesides left in hand, not sold.\n\nI had nothing to do now but entirely to conceal myself from all that\nhad any knowledge of me before. And this was the easiest thing in the\nworld to do; for I was grown out of everybody's knowledge, and most of\nthose I had known were grown out of mine. My captain, who went with\nme, or, rather, who carried me away, I found, by inquiring at the\nproper place, had been rambling about the world, came to London, fell\ninto his own trade, which he could not forbear, and growing an eminent\nhighwayman, had made his exit at the gallows, after a life of fourteen\nyears' most exquisite and successful rogueries, the particulars of\nwhich would make, as I observed, an admirable history. My other\nbrother Jacque, who I called major, followed the like wicked trade,\nbut was a man of more gallantry and generosity; and having committed\ninnumerable depredations upon mankind, yet had always so much\ndexterity as to bring himself off, till at length he was laid fast in\nNewgate, and loaded with irons, and would certainly have gone the same\nway as the captain, but he was so dexterous a rogue that no gaol, no\nfetters, would hold him; and he, with two more, found means to knock\noff their irons, worked their way through the wall of the prison, and\nlet themselves down on the outside in the night. So escaping, they\nfound means to get into France, where he followed the same trade, and\nwith so much success that he grew famous by the name of Anthony, and\nhad the honour, with three of his comrades, whom he had taught the\nEnglish way of robbing generously, as they called it, without\nmurdering or wounding, or ill-using those they robbed;--I say, he had\nthe honour to be broke upon the wheel at the Greve in Paris.\n\nAll these things I found means to be fully informed of, and to have a\nlong account of the particulars of their conduct from some of their\ncomrades who had the good fortune to escape, and who I got the\nknowledge of without letting them so much as guess at who I was or\nupon what account I inquired.\n\nI was now at the height of my good fortune. Indeed I was in very good\ncircumstances, and being of a frugal temper from the beginning, I\nsaved things together as they came, and yet lived very well too.\nParticularly I had the reputation of a very considerable merchant, and\none that came over vastly rich from Virginia; and as I frequently\nbought supplies for my several families and plantations there as they\nwrote to me for them, so I passed, I say, for a great merchant.\n\nI lived single, indeed, and in lodgings, but I began to be very well\nknown, and though I had subscribed my name only \"Jack\" to my\nparticular correspondent, yet the French, among whom I lived near a\nyear, as I have said, not understanding what Jack meant, called me\nMonsieur Jacques and Colonel Jacques, and so gradually Colonel Jacque.\nSo I was called in the certificate of exchanging me with the other\nprisoner, so that I went so also into Flanders; upon which, and seeing\nmy certificate of exchange, as above, I was called Colonel Jacques in\nEngland by my friend who I called correspondent. And thus I passed for\na foreigner and a Frenchman, and I was infinitely fond of having\neverybody take me for a Frenchman; and as I spoke French very well,\nhaving learned it by continuing so long among them, so I went\nconstantly to the French church in London, and spoke French upon all\noccasions as much as I could; and, to complete the appearance of it, I\ngot me a French servant to do my business--I mean as to my\nmerchandise, which only consisted in receiving and disposing of\ntobacco, of which I had about five hundred to six hundred hogsheads a\nyear from my own plantations, and in supplying my people with\nnecessaries as they wanted them.\n\nIn this private condition I continued about two years more, when the\ndevil, owing me a spleen ever since I refused being a thief, paid me\nhome, with my interest, by laying a snare in my way which had almost\nruined me.\n\nThere dwelt a lady in the house opposite to the house I lodged in, who\nmade an extraordinary figure indeed. She went very well dressed, and\nwas a most beautiful person. She was well-bred, sung admirably fine,\nand sometimes I could hear her very distinctly, the houses being over\nagainst one another, in a narrow court, not much unlike Three King\nCourt in Lombard Street.\n\nThis lady put herself so often in my way that I could not in good\nmanners forbear taking notice of her, and giving her the ceremony of\nmy hat when I saw her at her window, or at the door, or when I passed\nher in the court; so that we became almost acquainted at a distance.\nSometimes she also visited at the house I lodged at, and it was\ngenerally contrived that I should be introduced when she came, and\nthus by degrees we became more intimately acquainted, and often\nconversed together in the family, but always in public, at least for a\ngreat while.\n\nI was a mere boy in the affair of love, and knew the least of what\nbelonged to a woman of any man in Europe of my age. The thoughts of a\nwife, much less of a mistress, had never so much as taken the least\nhold of my head, and I had been till now as perfectly unacquainted\nwith the sex, and as unconcerned about them, as I was when I was ten\nyears old, and lay in a heap of ashes at the glass-house.\n\nBut I know not by what witchcraft in the conversation of this woman,\nand her singling me out upon several occasions, I began to be\nensnared, I knew not how, or to what end; and was on a sudden so\nembarrassed in my thoughts about her that, like a charm, she had me\nalways in her circle. If she had not been one of the subtlest women on\nearth, she could never have brought me to have given myself the least\ntrouble about her, but I was drawn in by the magic of a genius capable\nto deceive a more wary capacity than mine, and it was impossible to\nresist her.\n\nShe attacked me without ceasing, with the fineness of her conduct, and\nwith arts which were impossible to be ineffectual. She was ever, as it\nwere, in my view, often in my company, and yet kept herself so on the\nreserve, so surrounded continually with obstructions, that for several\nmonths after she could perceive I sought an opportunity to speak to\nher, she rendered it impossible; nor could I ever break in upon her,\nshe kept her guard so well.\n\nThis rigid behaviour was the greatest mystery that could be,\nconsidering, at the same time, that she never declined my seeing her\nor conversing with me in public. But she held it on; she took care\nnever to sit next me, that I might slip no paper into her hand or\nspeak softly to her; she kept somebody or other always between, that I\ncould never come up to her; and thus, as if she was resolved really to\nhave nothing to do with me, she held me at the bay several months.\n\nAll this while nothing was more certain than that she intended\nto have me, if she could catch; and it was indeed a kind of a catch,\nfor she managed all by art, and drew me in with the most resolute\nbackwardness, that it was almost impossible not to be deceived by it.\nOn the other hand, she did not appear to be a woman despicable,\nneither was she poor, or in a condition that should require so much\nart to draw any man in; but the cheat was really on my side; for she\nwas unhappily told that I was vastly rich, a great merchant, and that\nshe would live like a queen; which I was not at all instrumental in\nputting upon her, neither did I know that she went upon that motive.\n\nShe was too cunning to let me perceive how easy she was to be had; on\nthe contrary, she run all the hazards of bringing me to neglect her\nentirely that one would think any woman in the world could do. And I\nhave wondered often since how that it was possible it should fail of\nmaking me perfectly averse to her; for as I had a perfect indifferency\nfor the whole sex, and never till then entertained any notion of them,\nthey were no more to me than a picture hanging up against a wall.\n\nAs we conversed freely together in public, so she took a great many\noccasions to rally the men, and the weakness they were guilty of in\nletting the women insult them as they did. She thought if the men had\nnot been fools, marriage had been only treaties of peace between two\nneighbours, or alliances offensive or defensive, which must\nnecessarily have been carried on sometimes by interviews and personal\ntreaties, but oftener by ambassadors, agents, and emissaries on both\nsides; but that the women had outwitted us, and brought us upon our\nknees, and made us whine after them, and lower ourselves, so as we\ncould never pretend to gain our equality again.\n\nI told her I thought it was a decency to the ladies to give them the\nadvantage of denying a little, that they might be courted, and that I\nshould not like a woman the worse for denying me. \"I expect it,\nmadam,\" says I, \"when I wait on you to-morrow;\" intimating that I\nintended it. \"You shan't be deceived, sir,\" says she, \"for I'll deny\nnow, before you ask me the question.\"\n\nI was dashed so effectually with so malicious, so devilish an answer\nthat I returned with a little sullenness, \"I shan't trespass upon you\nyet, madam; and I shall be very careful not to offend you when I do.\"\n\n\"It is the greatest token of your respect, sir,\" says she, \"that you\nare able to bestow upon me, and the most agreeable too, except one,\nwhich I will not be out of hopes of obtaining of you in a little\ntime.\"\n\n\"What is in my power to oblige you in, madam,\" said I, \"you may\ncommand me in at any time, especially the way we are talking of.\" This\nI spoke still with a resentment very sincere.\n\n\"It is only, sir, that you would promise to hate me with as much\nsincerity as I will endeavour to make you a suitable return.\"\n\n\"I granted that request, madam, seven years before you asked it,\" said\nI, \"for I heartily hated the whole sex, and scarce know how I came to\nabate that good disposition in compliment to your conversation; but I\nassure you that abatement is so little that it does no injury to your\nproposal.\"\n\n\"There's some mystery in that indeed, sir,\" said she, \"for I desire to\nassist your aversion to women in a more particular manner, and hoped\nit should never abate under my management.\" We said a thousand\nill-natured things after this, but she outdid me, for she had such a\nstock of bitterness upon her tongue as no woman ever went beyond her,\nand yet all this while she was the pleasantest and most obliging\ncreature in every part of our conversation that could possibly be, and\nmeant not one word of what she said; no, not a word. But I must\nconfess it no way answered her end, for it really cooled all my\nthoughts of her, and I, that had lived in so perfect an indifferency\nto the sex all my days, was easily returned to that condition again,\nand began to grow very cold and negligent in my usual respects to her\nupon all occasions.\n\nShe soon found she had gone too far with me, and, in short, that she\nwas extremely out in her politics; that she had to do with one that\nwas not listed yet among the whining sort of lovers, and knew not what\nit was to adore a mistress in order to abuse her; and that it was not\nwith me as it was with the usual sort of men in love, that are warmed\nby the cold, and rise in their passions as the ladies fall in their\nreturns. On the contrary, she found that it was quite altered. I was\ncivil to her, as before, but not so forward. When I saw her at her\nchamber-window, I did not throw mine open, as I usually had done, to\ntalk with her. When she sung in the parlour, where I could easily hear\nit, I did not listen. When she visited at the house where I lodged, I\ndid not always come down; or if I did, I had business which obliged me\nto go abroad; and yet all this while, when I did come into her\ncompany, I was as intimate as ever.\n\nI could easily see that this madded her to the heart, and that she\nwas perplexed to the last degree, for she found that she had all her\ngame to play over again; that so absolute a reservedness, even to\nrudeness and ill manners, was a little too much; but she was a mere\nposture-mistress in love, and could put herself into what shapes she\npleased.\n\nShe was too wise to show a fondness or forwardness that looked like\nkindness. She knew that was the meanest and last step a woman can\ntake, and lays her under the foot of the man she pretends to. Fondness\nis not the last favour indeed, but it is the last favour but one that\na woman can grant, and lays her almost as low; I mean, it lays her at\nthe mercy of the man she shows it to; but she was not come to that\nneither. This chameleon put on another colour, turned, on a sudden,\nthe gravest, soberest, majestic madam, so that any one would have\nthought she was advanced in age in one week from two-and-twenty to\nfifty, and this she carried on with so much government of herself that\nit did not in the least look like art; but if it was a representation\nof nature only, it was so like nature itself that nobody living can be\nable to distinguish. She sung very often in her parlour, as well by\nherself as with two young ladies who came often to see her. I could\nsee by their books, and her guitar in her hand, that she was singing;\nbut she never opened the window, as she was wont to do. Upon my\ncoming to my window, she kept her own always shut; or if it was open,\nshe would be sitting at work, and not look up, it may be, once in\nhalf-an-hour.\n\nIf she saw me by accident all this while, she would smile, and speak\nas cheerfully as ever; but it was but a word or two, and so make her\nhonours and be gone; so that, in a word, we conversed just as we did\nafter I had been there a week.\n\nShe tired me quite out at this work; for though I began the\nstrangeness, indeed, yet I did not design the carrying it on so far.\nBut she held it to the last, just in the same manner as she began it.\nShe came to the house where I lodged as usual, and we were often\ntogether, supped together, played at cards together, danced together;\nfor in France I accomplished myself with everything that was needful\nto make me what I believed myself to be even from a boy--I mean a\ngentleman. I say, we conversed together, as above, but she was so\nperfectly another thing to what she used to be in every part of her\nconversation that it presently occurred to me that her former\nbehaviour was a kind of a rant or fit; that either it was the effect\nof some extraordinary levity that had come upon her, or that it was\ndone to mimic the coquets of the town, believing it might take with\nme, who she thought was a Frenchman, and that it was what I loved. But\nher new gravity was her real natural temper, and indeed it became her\nso much better, or, as I should say, she acted it so well, that it\nreally brought me back to have, not as much only, but more mind to her\nthan ever I had before.\n\nHowever, it was a great while before I discovered myself, and I stayed\nindeed to find out, if possible, whether this change was real or\ncounterfeit; for I could not easily believe it was possible the gay\nhumour she used to appear in could be a counterfeit. It was not,\ntherefore, till a year and almost a quarter that I came to any\nresolution in my thoughts about her, when, on a mere accident, we came\nto a little conversation together.\n\nShe came to visit at our house as usual, and it happened all the\nladies were gone abroad; but, as it fell out, I was in the passage or\nentry of the house, going towards the stairs, when she knocked at the\ndoor; so, stepping back, I opened the door, and she, without any\nceremony, came in, and ran forward into the parlour, supposing the\nwomen had been there. I went in after her, as I could do no less,\nbecause she did not know that the family was abroad.\n\nUpon my coming in she asked for the ladies. I told her I hoped she\ncame to visit me now, for that the ladies were all gone abroad. \"Are\nthey?\" said she, as if surprised--though I understood afterwards she\nknew it before, as also that I was at home--and then rises up to be\ngone. \"No, madam,\" said I, \"pray do not go; when ladies come to visit\nme, I do not use to tire them of my company so soon.\" \"That's as\nill-natured,\" says she, \"as you could possibly talk. Pray don't\npretend I came to visit you. I am satisfied who I came to visit, and\nsatisfied that you know it.\" \"Yes, madam,\" said I; \"but if I happen to\nbe all of the family that's left at home, then you came to visit me.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: COLONEL JACQUE AND THE LADY]\n\n\"I never receive visits from those that I hate,\" says she.\n\n\"You have me there, indeed,\" said I; \"but you never gave me leave to\ntell you why I hated you. I hated you because you would never give me\nan opportunity to tell you I loved you. Sure, you took me for some\nfrightful creature, that you would never come near enough so much as\nto let me whisper to you that I love you.\"\n\n\"I never care to hear anything so disagreeable,\" says she, \"though it\nbe spoken ever so softly.\"\n\nWe rallied thus for an hour. In short, she showed the abundance of her\nwit, and I an abundant deficiency of mine; for though three or four\ntimes she provoked me to the last degree, so that once I was going to\ntell her I had enough of her company, and, if she pleased I would wait\nupon her to the door, yet she had always so much witchcraft on her\ntongue that she brought herself off again; till, to make the story\nshort, we came at last to talk seriously on both sides about\nmatrimony, and she heard me freely propose it, and answered me\ndirectly upon many occasions. For example, she told me I would carry\nher away to France or to Virginia, and that she could not think of\nleaving England, her native country. I told her I hoped she did not\ntake me for a kidnapper. (By the way, I did not tell her how I had\nbeen kidnapped myself.) She said no; but the consequence of my\naffairs, which were, it seems, mostly abroad, might oblige me to go,\nand she could never think of marrying any man that she could not be\ncontent to go all over the world with, if he had occasion to go\nhimself. This was handsomely expressed indeed. I made her easy on that\npoint, and thus we began the grand parley; which indeed she drew me\ninto with the utmost art and subtilty, such as was peculiar to\nherself, but was infinitely her advantage in our treating of marriage;\nfor she made me effectually court her, though at the same time in her\ndesign she courted me with the utmost skill, and such skill it was\nthat her design was perfectly impenetrable to the last moment.\n\nIn short, we came nearer and nearer every time we met; and after one\ncasual visit more, in which I had the mighty favour of talking with\nher alone, I then waited on her every day at her own house, or\nlodgings rather, and so we set about the work to a purpose, and in\nabout a month we gave the world the slip, and were privately married,\nto avoid ceremony and the public inconveniency of a wedding.\n\nWe soon found a house proper for our dwelling, and so went to\nhousekeeping. We had not been long together but I found that gay\ntemper of my wife returned, and she threw off the mask of her gravity\nand good conduct, that I had so long fancied was her mere natural\ndisposition; and now, having no more occasion for disguises, she\nresolved to seem nothing but what really she was, a wild, untamed\ncolt, perfectly loose, and careless to conceal any part, no, not the\nworst of her conduct.\n\nShe carried on this air of levity to such an excess that I could not\nbut be dissatisfied at the expense of it; for she kept company that I\ndid not like, lived beyond what I could support, and sometimes lost at\nplay more than I cared to pay. Upon which, one day, I took occasion to\nmention it, but lightly; and said to her, by way of raillery, that we\nlived merrily, for as long as it would last. She turned short upon me,\n\"What do you mean?\" says she. \"Why, you don't pretend to be uneasy, do\nye?\" \"No, no, madam, not I, by no means; it is no business of mine,\nyou know,\" said I, \"to inquire what my wife spends, or whether she\nspends more than I can afford, or less. I only desire the favour to\nknow, as near as you can guess, how long you will please to take to\ndespatch me, for I would not be too long a-dying.\"\n\n\"I do not know what you talk of,\" says she. \"You may die as leisurely,\nor as hastily, as you please, when your time comes; I a'nt a-going to\nkill you, as I know of.\"\n\n\"But you are a-going to starve me, madam,\" said I, \"and hunger is as\nleisurely a death as breaking upon the wheel.\"\n\n\"I starve you! Why, are not you a great Virginia merchant, and did not\nI bring you \u00c2\u00a31500? What would you have? Sure, you can maintain a wife\nout of that, can't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam,\" says I, \"I could maintain a wife, but not a gamester,\nthough you had brought me \u00c2\u00a31500 a year; no estate is big enough for a\nbox and dice.\"\n\nShe took fire at that, and flew out in a passion, and after a great\nmany bitter words, told me, in short, that she saw no occasion to\nalter her conduct; and as for my not maintaining her, when I could not\nmaintain her longer she would find some way or other to maintain\nherself.\n\nSome time after the first rattle of this kind, she vouchsafed to let\nme know that she was pleased to be with child. I was at first glad of\nit, in hopes it would help to abate her madness; but it was all one,\nand her being with child only added to the rest, for she made such\npreparations for her lying-in, and the other appendixes of a child's\nbeing born, that, in short, I found she would be downright distracted.\nAnd I took the liberty to tell her one day that she would soon bring\nherself and me to destruction, and entreated her to consider that such\nfigures as those were quite above us, and out of our circle; and, in\nshort, that I neither could nor would allow such expenses; that, at\nthis rate, two or three children would effectually ruin me, and that I\ndesired her to consider what she was doing.\n\nShe told me, with an air of disdain, that it was none of her business\nto consider anything of that matter; that if I could not allow it, she\nwould allow it herself, and I might do my worst.\n\nI begged her to consider things for all that, and not drive me to\nextremities; that I married her to love and cherish her, and use her\nas a good wife ought to be used, but not to be ruined and undone by\nher. In a word, nothing could mollify her, nor any argument persuade\nher to moderation, but withal she took it so heinously that I should\npretend to restrain her, that she told me in so many words she would\ndrop her burthen with me, and then, if I did not like it, she would\ntake care of herself; she would not live with me an hour, for she\nwould not be restrained, not she; and talked a long while at that\nrate.\n\nI told her, as to her child, which she called her burthen, it should\nbe no burthen to me; as to the rest, she might do as she pleased; it\nmight, however, do me this favour, that I should have no more lyings\nin at the rate of \u00c2\u00a3136 at a time, as I found she intended it should be\nnow. She told me she could not tell that; if she had no more by me,\nshe hoped she should by somebody else. \"Say you so, madam?\" said I.\n\"Then they that get them shall keep them.\" She did not know that\nneither, she said, and so turned it off jeering, and, as it were,\nlaughing at me.\n\nThis last discourse nettled me, I must confess, and the more because I\nhad a great deal of it and very often, till, in short, we began at\nlength to enter into a friendly treaty about parting.\n\nNothing could be more criminal than the several discourses we had upon\nthis subject. She demanded a separate maintenance, and, in particular,\nat the rate of \u00c2\u00a3300 a year, and I demanded security of her that she\nshould not run me in debt. She demanded the keeping of the child, with\nan allowance of \u00c2\u00a3100 a year for that, and I demanded that I should be\nsecured from being charged for keeping any she might have by somebody\nelse, as she had threatened me.\n\nIn the interval, and during these contests, she dropped her burthen\n(as she called it), and brought me a son, a very fine child.\n\nShe was content during her lying-in to abate a little, though it was\nbut a very little indeed, of the great expense she had intended, and,\nwith some difficulty and persuasion, was content with a suit of\nchild-bed linen of \u00c2\u00a315 instead of one she had intended of threescore;\nand this she magnified as a particular testimony of her condescension\nand a yielding to my avaricious temper, as she called it. But after\nshe was up again, it was the same thing, and she went on with her\nhumour to that degree that in a little time she began to carry it on\nto other excesses, and to have a sort of fellows come to visit her,\nwhich I did not like, and once, in particular, stayed abroad all\nnight. The next day, when she came home, she began to cry out first;\ntold me where (as she said) she lay, and that the occasion was a\nchristening, where the company had a feast and stayed too late; that,\nif I was dissatisfied, I might inform myself there of all the\nparticulars, where she lay, and the like. I told her coldly, \"Madam,\nyou do well to suggest my being dissatisfied, for you may be sure I\nam, and you could expect no other; that as to going to your haunts to\ninform myself, that is not my business: it is your business to bring\ntestimonies of your behaviour, and to prove where you lay, and in what\ncompany. It is enough to me that you lay out of your own house,\nwithout your husband's knowledge or consent, and before you and I\nconverse again I must have some satisfaction of the particulars.\"\n\nShe answered, with all her heart; she was as in different as I; and\nsince I took so ill her lying at a friend's house on an extraordinary\noccasion, she gave me to understand that it was what she would have me\nexpect, and what she would have the liberty to do when she thought\nfit.\n\n\"Well, madam,\" said I, \"if I must expect what I cannot allow, you must\nexpect I shall shut my doors by day against those that keep out of\nthem at night.\"\n\nShe would try me, she said, very speedily; and if I shut the doors\nagainst her, she would find a way to make me open them.\n\n\"Well, madam,\" says I, \"you threaten me hard, but I would advise you\nto consider before you take such measures, for I shall be as good as\nmy word.\" However, it was not long that we could live together upon\nthese terms; for I found very quickly what company she kept, and that\nshe took a course which I ought not to bear. So I began the separation\nfirst, and refused her my bed. We had indeed refrained all converse as\nhusband and wife for about two months before, for I told her very\nplainly I would father no brats that were not of my own getting; and\nmatters coming thus gradually to an extremity, too great to continue\nas it was, she went off one afternoon, and left me a line in writing,\nsignifying that affairs had come to such a pass between us that she\ndid not think fit to give me the opportunity of shutting her out of\ndoors, and that therefore she had retired herself to such a place,\nnaming a relation of her own, as scandalous as herself; and that she\nhoped I would not give her the trouble to sue for her support in the\nordinary course of law, but that, as her occasions required, she\nshould draw bills upon me, which she expected I would not refuse.\n\nI was extremely satisfied with this proceeding, and took care to let\nher hear of it, though I gave no answer at all to her letter; and as I\nhad taken care before that whenever she played such a prank as this,\nshe should not be able to carry much with her, so, after she was gone,\nI immediately broke up housekeeping, sold my furniture by public\noutcry, and in it everything in particular that was her own, and set a\nbill upon my door, giving her to understand by it that she had passed\nthe Rubicon, that as she had taken such a step of her own accord, so\nthere was no room left her ever to think of coming back again.\n\nThis was what any one may believe I should not have done if I had seen\nany room for a reformation; but she had given me such testimonies of a\nmind alienated from her husband, in particular espousing her own\nunsufferable levity, that there was indeed no possibility of our\ncoming afterwards to any terms again.\n\nHowever, I kept a couple of trusty agents so near her that I failed\nnot to have a full account of her conduct, though I never let her know\nanything of me but that I was gone over to France. As to her bills\nwhich she said she would draw upon me, she was as good as her word in\ndrawing one of \u00c2\u00a330, which I refused to accept, and never gave her\nleave to trouble me with another.\n\nIt is true, and I must acknowledge it, that all this was a very\nmelancholy scene of life to me, and but that she took care by carrying\nherself to the last degree provoking, and continually to insult me, I\ncould never have gone on to the parting with so much resolution; for I\nreally loved her very sincerely, and could have been anything but a\nbeggar and a cuckold with her, but those were intolerable to me,\nespecially as they were put upon me with so much insult and rudeness.\n\nBut my wife carried it at last to a point that made all things light\nand easy to me, for after above a year's separation, and keeping such\ncompany as she thought fit, she was pleased to be with child again, in\nwhich she had, however, so much honesty as not to pretend that she had\nhad anything to do with me. What a wretched life she led after this,\nand how she brought herself to the utmost extremity of misery and\ndistress, I may speak of hereafter.\n\nI had found, soon after our parting, that I had a great deal of reason\nto put myself into a posture at first not to be imposed upon by her;\nfor I found very quickly that she had run herself into debt in several\nplaces very considerably, and that it was upon a supposition that I\nwas liable to those debts. But I was gone, and it was absolutely\nnecessary I should do so; upon which she found herself obliged, out of\nher wicked gains, however, whatever she made of them, to discharge\nmost of those debts herself.\n\nAs soon as she was delivered of her child, in which my intelligence\nwas so good that I had gotten sufficient proof of it, I sued her in\nthe ecclesiastical court, in order to obtain a divorce; and as she\nfound it impossible to avoid it, so she declined the defence, and I\ngained a legal decree, or what they call it, of divorce, in the usual\ntime of such process; and now I thought myself a free man once again,\nand began to be sick of wedlock with all my heart.\n\nI lived retired, because I knew she had contracted debts which I\nshould be obliged to pay, and I was resolved to be gone out of her\nreach with what speed I could. But it was necessary that I should stay\ntill the Virginia fleet came in, because I looked for at least three\nhundred hogsheads of tobacco from thence, which I knew would heal all\nmy breaches; for indeed the extravagance of three years with this lady\nhad sunk me most effectually, even far beyond her own fortune, which\nwas considerable, though not quite \u00c2\u00a31500, as she had called it.\n\nBut all the mischiefs I met with on account of this match were not\nover yet; for when I had been parted with her about three months, and\nhad refused to accept her bill of \u00c2\u00a330, which I mentioned above, though\nI was removed from my first lodgings too, and thought I had\neffectually secured myself from being found out, yet there came a\ngentleman well dressed to my lodgings one day, and was let in before I\nknew of it, or else I should scarce have admitted him.\n\nHe was led into a parlour, and I came down to him in my gown and\nslippers. When I came into the room he called me as familiarly\nby my name as if he had known me twenty years, and pulling out a\npocket-book, he shows me a bill upon me, drawn by my wife, which was\nthe same bill for \u00c2\u00a330 that I had refused before.\n\n\"Sir,\" says I, \"this bill has been presented before, and I gave my\nanswer to it then.\"\n\n\"Answer, sir!\" says he, with a kind of jeering, taunting air. \"I do\nnot understand what you mean by an answer; it is not a question, sir;\nit is a bill to be paid.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" says I, \"it is a bill; I know that, and I gave my answer\nto it before.\"\n\n\"Sir, sir,\" says he very saucily, \"your answer! There is no answer to\na bill; it must be paid. Bills are to be paid, not to be answered.\nThey say you are a merchant, sir; merchants always pay their bills.\"\n\nI began to be angry too a little, but I did not like my man, for I\nfound he began to be quarrelsome. However, I said, \"Sir, I perceive\nyou are not much used to presenting bills. Sir, a bill is always first\npresented, and presenting is a question; it is asking if I will accept\nor pay the bill, and then whether I say yes or no, it is an answer one\nway or other. After 'tis accepted, it indeed requires no more answer\nbut payment when 'tis due. If you please to inform yourself, this is\nthe usage which all merchants or tradesmen of any kind who have bills\ndrawn upon them act by.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" says he, \"and what then? What is this to the paying me\nthe \u00c2\u00a330?\"\n\n\"Why, sir,\" says I, \"it is this to it, that I told the person that\nbrought it I should not pay it.\"\n\n\"Not pay it!\" says he. \"But you shall pay it; ay, ay, you will pay\nit.\"\n\n\"She that draws it has no reason to draw any bills upon me, I am\nsure,\" said I; \"and I shall pay no bills she draws, I assure you.\"\n\nUpon this he turns short upon me: \"Sir, she that draws this bill is a\nperson of too much honour to draw any bill without reason, and 'tis an\naffront to say so of her, and I shall expect satisfaction of you for\nthat by itself. But first the bill, sir--the bill; you must pay the\nbill, sir.\"\n\nI returned as short: \"Sir, I affront nobody. I know the person as well\nas you, I hope; and what I have said of her is no affront. She can\nhave no reason to draw bills upon me, for I owe her nothing.\"\n\nI omit intermingling the oaths he laced his speech with, as too foul\nfor my paper. But he told me he would make me know she had friends to\nstand by her, that I had abused her, and he would let me know it, and\ndo her justice. But first I must pay his bill.\n\nI answered, in short, I would not pay the bill, nor any bills she\nshould draw.\n\nWith that he steps to the door and shuts it, and swore by G--d he\nwould make me pay the bill before we parted, and laid his hand upon\nhis sword, but did not draw it out.\n\nI confess I was frighted to the last degree, for I had no sword; and\nif I had, I must own that, though I had learned a great many good\nthings in France to make me look like a gentleman, I had forgot the\nmain article of learning how to use a sword, a thing so universally\npractised there; and, to say more, I had been perfectly unacquainted\nwith quarrels of this nature; so that I was perfectly surprised when\nhe shut the door, and knew not what to say or do.\n\nHowever, as it happened, the people of the house, hearing us pretty\nloud, came near the door, and made a noise in the entry to let me know\nthey were at hand; and one of the servants, going to open the door,\nand finding it locked, called out to me, \"Sir, for God's sake open the\ndoor! What is the matter? Shall we fetch a constable?\" I made no\nanswer, but it gave me courage; so I sat down composed in one of the\nchairs, and said to him, \"Sir, this is not the way to make me pay the\nbill; you had much better be easy, and take your satisfaction another\nway.\"\n\nHe understood me of fighting, which, upon my word, was not in my\nthoughts; but I meant that he had better take his course at law.\n\n\"With all my heart,\" says he; \"they say you are a gentleman, and they\ncall you colonel. Now, if you are a gentleman, I accept your\nchallenge, sir; and if you will walk out with me, I will take it for\nfull payment of the bill, and will decide it as gentlemen ought to\ndo.\"\n\n\"I challenge you, sir!\" said I. \"Not I; I made no challenge,\" I said.\n\"This is not the way to make me pay a bill that I have not accepted;\nthat is, that you had better seek your satisfaction at law.\"\n\n\"Law!\" says he; \"law! Gentlemen's law is my law. In short, sir, you\nshall pay me or fight me.\" And then, as if he had mistaken, he turns\nshort upon me, \"Nay,\" says he, \"you shall both fight me and pay me,\nfor I will maintain her honour;\" and in saying this he bestowed about\nsix or seven \"damme's\" and oaths, by way of parenthesis.\n\nThis interval delivered me effectually, for just at the words \"fight\nme, for I will maintain her honour,\" the maid had brought in a\nconstable, with three or four neighbours to assist him.\n\nHe heard them come in, and began to be a little in a rage, and asked\nme if I intended to mob him instead of paying; and laying his hand on\nhis sword, told me, if any man offered to break in upon him, he would\nrun me through the first moment, that he might have the fewer to deal\nwith afterwards.\n\nI told him he knew I had called for no help (believing he could not be\nin earnest in what he had said), and that, if anybody attempted to\ncome in upon us, it was to prevent the mischief he threatened, and\nwhich he might see I had no weapons to resist.\n\nUpon this the constable called, and charged us both in the king's name\nto open the door. I was sitting in a chair, and offered to rise. He\nmade a motion as if he would draw, upon which I sat down again, and\nthe door not being opened, the constable set his foot against it and\ncame in.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" says my gentleman, \"and what now? What's your business\nhere?\" \"Nay, sir,\" says the constable, \"you see my business. I am a\npeace-officer; all I have to do is to keep the peace, and I find the\npeople of the house frightened for fear of mischief between you, and\nthey have fetched me to prevent it.\" \"What mischief have they supposed\nyou should find?\" says he. \"I suppose,\" says the constable, \"they were\nafraid you should fight.\" \"That's because they did not know this\nfellow here. He never fights. They call him colonel,\" says he. \"I\nsuppose he might be born a colonel, for I dare say he was born a\ncoward; he never fights; he dares not see a man. If he would have\nfought, he would have walked out with me, but he scorns to be brave;\nthey would never have talked to you of fighting if they had known him.\nI tell you, Mr. Constable, he is a coward, and a coward is a rascal;\"\nand with that he came to me, and stroked his finger down my nose\npretty hard, and laughed and mocked most horribly, as if I was a\ncoward. Now, for aught I knew, it might be true, but I was now what\nthey call a coward made desperate, which is one of the worst of men in\nthe world to encounter with; for, being in a fury, I threw my head in\nhis face, and closing with him, threw him fairly on his back by mere\nstrength; and had not the constable stepped in and taken me off, I had\ncertainly stamped him to death with my feet, for my blood was now all\nin a flame, and the people of the house were frighted now as much the\nother way, lest I should kill him, though I had no weapon at all in my\nhand.\n\nThe constable too reproved me in his turn; but I said to him, \"Mr.\nConstable, do you not think I am sufficiently provoked? Can any man\nbear such things as these? I desire to know who this man is and who\nsent him hither.\"\n\n\"I am,\" says he, \"a gentleman, and come with a bill to him for money,\nand he refuses to pay it.\" \"Well,\" says the constable very prudently,\n\"that is none of my business; I am no justice of the peace to hear the\ncause. Be that among yourselves, but keep your hands off one another,\nand that is as much as I desire; and therefore, sir,\" says the\nconstable to him, \"if I may advise you, seeing he will not pay the\nbill, and that must be decided between you as the law directs, I would\nhave you leave it for the present and go quietly away.\"\n\nHe made many impertinent harangues about the bill, and insisted that\nit was drawn by my own wife. I said angrily, \"Then it was drawn by a\nwhore.\" He bullied me upon that, told me I durst not tell him so\nanywhere else; so I answered, \"I would very soon publish her for a\nwhore to all the world, and cry her down;\" and thus we scolded for\nnear half-an-hour, for I took courage when the constable was there,\nfor I knew that he would keep us from fighting, which indeed I had no\nmind to, and so at length I got rid of him.\n\nI was heartily vexed at this rencounter, and the more because I had\nbeen found out in my lodging, which I thought I had effectually\nconcealed. However, I resolved to remove the next day, and in the\nmeantime I kept within doors all that day till the evening, and then I\nwent out in order not to return thither any more.\n\nBeing come out into Gracechurch Street, I observed a man follow me,\nwith one of his legs tied up in a string, and hopping along with the\nother, and two crutches; he begged for a farthing, but I inclining not\nto give him anything, the fellow followed me still, till I came to a\ncourt, when I answered hastily to him, \"I have nothing for you! Pray\ndo not be so troublesome!\" with which words he knocked me down with\none of his crutches.\n\nBeing stunned with the blow, I knew nothing what was done to me\nafterwards; but coming to myself again, I found I was wounded very\nfrightfully in several places, and that among the rest my nose was\nslit upwards, one of my ears cut almost off, and a great cut with a\nsword on the side of the forehead; also a stab into the body, though\nnot dangerous.\n\nWho had been near me, or struck me, besides the cripple that struck me\nwith his crutch, I knew not, nor do I know to this hour; but I was\nterribly wounded, and lay bleeding on the ground some time, till,\ncoming to myself, I got strength to cry out for help, and people\ncoming about me, I got some hands to carry me to my lodging, where I\nlay by it more than two months before I was well enough to go out of\ndoors; and when I did go out, I had reason to believe that I was\nwaited for by some rogues, who watched an opportunity to repeat the\ninjury I had met with before.\n\nThis made me very uneasy, and I resolved to get myself out of danger\nif possible, and to go over to France, or home, as I called it, to\nVirginia, so to be out of the way of villains and assassinations; for\nevery time I stirred out here I thought I went in danger of my life;\nand therefore, as before, I went out at night, thinking to be\nconcealed, so now I never went out but in open day, that I might be\nsafe, and never without one or two servants to be my lifeguard.\n\nBut I must do my wife a piece of justice here too, and that was, that,\nhearing what had befallen me, she wrote me a letter, in which she\ntreated me more decently than she had been wont to do. She said she\nwas very sorry to hear how I had been used, and the rather because she\nunderstood it was on presenting her bill to me. She said she hoped I\ncould not, in my worst dispositions, think so hardly of her as to\nbelieve it was done by her knowledge or consent, much less by her\norder or direction; that she abhorred such things, and protested, if\nshe had the least knowledge or so much as a guess at the villains\nconcerned, she would discover them to me. She let me know the person's\nname to whom she gave the bill, and where he lived, and left it to me\nto oblige him to discover the person who had brought it and used me so\nill, and wished I might find him and bring him to justice, and have\nhim punished with the utmost severity of the law.\n\nI took this so kindly of my wife that I think in my conscience, had\nshe come after it herself to see how I did, I had certainly taken her\nagain; but she satisfied herself with the civility of another letter,\nand desiring me to let her know as often as I could how I was; adding\nthat it would be infinitely to her satisfaction to hear I was\nrecovered of the hurt I had received, and that he was hanged at Tyburn\nwho had done it.\n\nShe used some expressions signifying, as I understood them, her\naffliction at our parting and her continued respect for me; but did\nnot make any motion towards returning. Then she used some arguments to\nmove me to pay her bills, intimating that she had brought me a large\nfortune, and now had nothing to subsist on, which was very severe.\n\nI wrote her an answer to this letter, though I had not to the other,\nletting her know how I had been used; that I was satisfied, upon her\nletter, that she had no hand in it; that it was not in her nature to\ntreat me so, who had never injured her, used any violence with her, or\nbeen the cause or desire of our parting; that, as to her bill, she\ncould not but know how much her expensive way of living had straitened\nand reduced me, and would, if continued, have ruined me; that she had\nin less than three years spent more than as much as she brought to me,\nand would not abate her expensive way, though calmly entreated by me,\nwith protestations that I could not support so great an expense, but\nchose rather to break up her family and go from me than to restrain\nherself to reasonable limits; though I used no violence with her, but\nentreaties and earnest persuasions, backed with good reason; letting\nher know how my estate was, and convincing her that it must reduce us\nto poverty at least; that, however, if she would recall her bill, I\nwould send her \u00c2\u00a330, which was the sum mentioned in her bill, and,\naccording to my ability, would not let her want, if she pleased to\nlive within due bounds; but then I let her know also that I had a very\nbad account of her conduct, and that she kept company with a\nscandalous fellow, who I named to her; that I was loth to believe such\nthings of her, but that, to put an entire end to the report and\nrestore her reputation, I let her know that still, after all I heard,\nif she would resolve to live without restraints, within the reasonable\nbounds of my capacity, and treat me with the same kindness, affection,\nand tenderness as I always had treated her, and ever would, I was\nwilling to receive her again, and would forget all that was past; but\nthat, if she declined me now, it would be forever; for if she did not\naccept my offer, I was resolved to stay here no longer, where I had\nbeen so ill-treated on many occasions, but was preparing to go into my\nown country, where I would spend my days in quiet, and in a retreat\nfrom the world.\n\nShe did not give such an answer to this as I expected; for though she\nthanked me for the \u00c2\u00a330, yet she insisted upon her justification in all\nother points; and though she did not refuse to return to me, yet she\ndid not say she accepted it, and, in short, said little or nothing to\nit, only a kind of claim to a reparation of her injured reputation,\nand the like.\n\nThis gave me some surprise at first, for I thought, indeed, any woman\nin her circumstances would have been very willing to have put an end\nto all her miseries, and to the reproach which was upon her, by a\nreconciliation, especially considering she subsisted at that time but\nvery meanly. But there was a particular reason which prevented her\nreturn, and which she could not plead to in her letter, yet was a good\nreason against accepting an offer which she would otherwise have been\nglad of; and this was, that, as I have mentioned above, she had fallen\ninto bad company, and had prostituted her virtue to some of her\nflatterers, and, in short, was with child; so that she durst not\nventure to accept my offer.\n\nHowever, as I observed above, she did not absolutely refuse it,\nintending (as I understood afterward) to keep the treaty of it on foot\ntill she could drop her burthen, as she had called it before, and\nhaving been delivered privately, have accepted my proposal afterward;\nand, indeed, this was the most prudent step she could take, or, as we\nmay say, the only step she had left to take. But I was too many for\nher here too. My intelligence about her was too good for her to\nconceal such an affair from me, unless she had gone away before she\nwas visibly big, and unless she had gone farther off too than she did;\nfor I had an account to a tittle of the time when, and place where,\nand the creature of which she was delivered; and then my offers of\ntaking her again were at an end, though she wrote me several very\npenitent letters, acknowledging her crime and begging me to forgive\nher. But my spirit was above all that now, nor could I ever bear the\nthoughts of her after that, but pursued a divorce, and accordingly\nobtained it, as I have mentioned already.\n\nThings being at this pass, I resolved, as I have observed before, to\ngo over to France, after I had received my effects from Virginia; and\naccordingly I came to Dunkirk in the year ----, and here I fell into\ncompany with some Irish officers of the regiment of Dillon, who by\nlittle and little entered me into the army, and by the help of\nLieutenant-General ----, an Irishman, and some money, I obtained a\ncompany in his regiment, and so went into the army directly.\n\nI was exceeding pleased with my new circumstances, and now I used to\nsay to myself I was come to what I was born to, and that I had never\ntill now lived the life of a gentleman.\n\nOur regiment, after I had been some time in it, was commanded into\nItaly, and one of the most considerable actions that I was in was the\nfamous attack upon Cremona, in the Milanese, where the Germans, being\nprivately and by treachery let into the town in the night through a\nkind of common sewer, surprised the town and got possession of the\ngreatest part of it, surprising the mareschal, Duke de Villeroi, and\ntaking him prisoner as he came out of his quarters, and beating the\nfew French troops which were left in the citadel; but were in the\nmiddle of their victory so boldly and resolutely attacked by two Irish\nregiments who were quartered in the street leading to the river Po,\nand who kept possession of the water-gate, or Po gate, of the town, by\nwhich the German reinforcements should have come in, that, after a\nmost desperate fight, the Germans had their victory wrung out of their\nhands, and not being able to break through us to let in their friends,\nwere obliged at length to quit the town again, to the eternal honour\nof those Irish regiments, and indeed of their whole nation, and for\nwhich we had a very handsome compliment from the king of France.\n\nI now had the satisfaction of knowing, and that for the first time\ntoo, that I was not that cowardly, low-spirited wretch that I was when\nthe fellow bullied me in my lodgings about the bill of \u00c2\u00a330. Had he\nattacked me now, though in the very same condition, I should, naked\nand unarmed as I was, have flown in the face of him and trampled him\nunder my feet. But men never know themselves till they are tried, and\ncourage is acquired by time and experience of things.\n\nPhilip de Comines tells us that, after the battle of Monteleri, the\nCount de Charolois, who till then had an utter aversion to the war,\nand abhorred it and everything that belonged to it, was so changed by\nthe glory he obtained in that action, and by the flattery of those\nabout him, that afterwards the army was his mistress and the fatigues\nof the war his chief delight. It is too great an example for me to\nbring in my own case, but so it was, that they flattered me so with my\nbravery, as they called it, on the occasion of this action, that I\nfancied myself brave, whether I was so or not, and the pride of it\nmade me bold and daring to the last degree on all occasions. But what\nadded to it was, that somebody gave a particular account to the Court\nof my being instru mental to the saving the city, and the whole\nCremonese, by my extraordinary defence of the Po gate, and by my\nmanaging that defence after the lieutenant-colonel who commanded the\nparty where I was posted was killed; upon which the king sent me a\npublic testimony of his accepting my service, and sent me a brevet to\nbe lieutenant-colonel, and the next courier brought me actually a\ncommission for lieutenant-colonel in the regiment of ----.\n\nI was in several skirmishes and petty encounters before this, by which\nI gained the reputation of a good officer; but I happened to be in\nsome particular posts too, by which I got somewhat that I liked much\nbetter, and that was a good deal of money.\n\nOur regiment was sent from France to Italy by sea. We embarked at\nToulon, and landed at Savona, in the territory of Genoa, and marched\nfrom thence to the duchy of Milan. At the first town we were sent to\ntake possession of, which was Alexandria, the citizens rose upon our\nmen in a most furious manner, and drove the whole garrison, which\nconsisted of eight hundred men--that is, French and soldiers in the\nFrench service--quite out of the town.\n\nI was quartered in a burgher's house, just by one of the ports, with\neight of my men and a servant, where, calling a short council with my\nmen, we were resolved to maintain the house we were in, whatever it\ncost, till we received orders to quit it from the commanding officer.\nUpon this, when I saw our men could not stand their ground in the\nstreet, being pressed hard by the citizens, I turned out of doors all\nthe family, and kept the house as a castle, which I was governor in;\nand as the house joined to the city gate, I resolved to maintain it,\nso as to be the last that should quit the place, my own retreat being\nsecured by being so near the port.\n\nHaving thus emptied the house of the inhabitants, we made no scruple\nof filling our pockets with what ever we could find there. In a word,\nwe left nothing we could carry away, among which it came to my lot to\ndip into the burgher's cabinet whose house it was where we were, and\nthere I took about the quantity of two hundred pistoles in money and\nplate, and other things of value. There was great complaint made to\nPrince Vaudemont, who was then governor of the Milanese, of this\nviolence. But as the repulse the citizens gave us was contrary to his\norder, and to the general design of the prince, who was then wholly in\nthe interest of King Philip, the citizens could obtain nothing; and I\nfound that if we had plundered the whole city it would have been the\nsame thing; for the governor had orders to take our regiment in, and\nit was an act of open rebellion to resist us as they did. However, we\nhad orders not to fire upon the burghers, unless constrained to it by\nevident necessity, and we rather chose to quit the place as we did\nthan dispute it with a desperate body of fellows, who wanted no\nadvantage of us, except only that of having possession of two bastions\nand one port of our retreat. First, they were treble our number; for\nthe burghers, being joined by seven companies of the regular troops,\nmade up above sixteen hundred men, besides rabble, which was many\nmore, whereas we were about eight hundred in all; they also had the\ncitadel and several pieces of cannon, so that we could have made\nnothing of it if we had attacked them. But they submitted three or\nfour days after to other forces, the soldiers within turning upon them\nand taking the citadel from them.\n\nAfter this we lay still in quarters eight months. For the prince,\nhaving secured the whole Milanese for King Philip, and no enemy\nappearing for some time, had nothing to do but to receive the\nauxiliary troops of France, and as they came, extend himself every way\nas he could, in order to keep the imperialists (who were preparing to\nfall into Italy with a great army) as much at a distance as possible,\nwhich he did by taking possession of the city of Mantua, and of most\nof the towns on that side, as far as the Lake De la Guarda and the\nriver Adige.\n\nWe lay in Mantua some time, but were afterwards drawn out by order of\nthe Count de Tesse (after wards Marshal of France), to form the French\narmy, till the arrival of the Duke de Vend\u00c3\u00b4me, who was to command in\nchief. Here we had a severe campaign, _anno_ 1701, having Prince\nEugene of Savoy and an army of forty thousand Germans, all old\nsoldiers, to deal with; and though the French army was more numerous\nthan the enemy by twenty-five thousand men, yet, being on the\ndefensive, and having so many posts to cover, not knowing exactly\nwhere the Prince of Savoy, who commanded the imperial army, would\nattack us, it obliged the French to keep their troops so divided and\nso remote from one another that the Germans pushed on their design\nwith great success, as the histories of those times more fully relate.\n\nI was at the action of Carpi, July 1701, where we were worsted by the\nGermans; indeed, were forced to quit our encampment and give up to the\nprince the whole river Adige, and where our regiment sustained some\nloss. But the enemies got little by us, and Monsieur Catinat, who\ncommanded at that time, drew up in order of battle the next day in\nsight of the German army, and gave them a defiance; but they would not\nstir, though we offered them battle two days together; for, having\ngained the passage over the Adige by our quitting Rivoli, which was\nthen useless to us, their business was done.\n\nFinding they declined a decisive action, our generals pressed them in\ntheir quarters, and made them fight for every inch of ground they\ngained; and at length, in the September following, we attacked them in\ntheir intrenched posts of Chiar. Here we broke into the very heart of\ntheir camp, where we made a very terrible slaughter. But I know not by\nwhat mistake among our generals, or defect in the execution of their\norders, the brigade of Normandy and our Irish Brigade, who had so\nbravely entered the German intrenchments, were not supported as we\nshould have been, so that we were obliged to sustain the shock of the\nwhole German army, and at last to quit the advantage we had gained,\nand that not without loss; but, being timely reinforced by a great\nbody of horse, the enemy were in their turn beaten off too, and driven\nback into their very camp. The Germans boasted of having a great\nvictory here, and indeed, in repulsing us after we had gained their\ncamp, they had the advantage. But had Monsieur de Tesse succoured us\nin time, as old Catinat said he ought to have done, with twelve\nthousand foot which he had with him, that day's action had put an end\nto the war, and Prince Eugene must have been glad to have gone back to\nGermany in more haste than he came, if, perhaps, we had not cut him\nshort by the way.\n\nBut the fate of things went another way, and the Germans continued all\nthat campaign to push forward and advance one post after another, till\nthey beat us quite out of the Milanese.\n\nThe latter part of this campaign we made only a party war, the French,\naccording to their volatile temper, being every day abroad, either\nforaging or surprising the enemy's foragers, plundering or\ncircumventing the plunders of the other side. But they very often came\nshort home, for the Germans had the better of them on several\noccasions; and indeed so many lost their lives upon these petty\nencounters that I think, including those who died of distempers gotten\nby hard service and bad quarters, lying in the field even till the\nmiddle of December among rivers and bogs, in a country so full of\ncanals and rivers as that part of Italy is known to be; I say, we lost\nmore men, and so did the enemy also, than would have been lost in a\ngeneral decisive battle.\n\nThe Duke of Savoy, to give him his due, pressed earnestly to put it to\na day and come to a battle with Prince Eugene; but the Duke de\nVilleroi, Monsieur Catinat, and the Count de Tesse were all against\nit; and the principal reason was, that they knew the weakness of the\ntroops, who had suffered so much on so many occasions that they were\nin no condition to give battle to the Germans. So after, as I say,\nabout three months' harassing one another with parties, we went into\nwinter quarters.\n\nBefore we marched out of the field, our regiment, with a detachment of\ndragoons of six hundred, and about two hundred and fifty horse, went\nout with a design to intercept Prince Commercy, a general of note\nunder Prince Eugene of Savoy. The detachment was intended to be only\nhorse and dragoons; but because it was the imperialists' good luck to\nbeat many of our parties, and, as was given out, many more than we\nbeat of theirs, and because it was believed that the prince, who was\nan officer of good note among them, would not go abroad but in very\ngood company, the Irish regiment of foot was ordered to be added,\nthat, if possible, they might meet with their match.\n\nI was commanded, about two hours before, to pass about two hundred\nfoot and fifty dragoons at a small wood where our general had\nintelligence that prince would post some men to secure his passage,\nwhich accordingly I did. But Count Tesse, not thinking our party\nstrong enough, had marched himself, with a thousand horse and three\nhundred grenadiers, to support us. And it was very well he did so; for\nPrince Commercy, having intelligence of the first party, came forward\nsooner than they expected, and fell upon them, and had entirely routed\nthem had not the Count, hearing the firing, advanced with the thousand\nhorse he had, with such expedition as to support his men in the very\nheat of the action, by which means the Germans were defeated and\nforced to retire. But the prince made a pretty good retreat, and after\nthe action came on to the wood where I was posted; but the surprise of\nhis defeat had prevented his sending a detachment to secure the pass\nat the wood, as he intended.\n\nThe Count de Tesse, understanding that we were sent, as above, to the\nwood, followed them close at the heels, to prevent our being cut off,\nand, if it were possible that we should give them any check at the\nwood, to fall in and have another brush with them. It was near night\nbefore they came to the wood, by which means they could not discern\nour number. But when they came up to the wood, fifty dragoons advanced\nto discover the pass and see if all was clear. These we suffered to\npass a great way into the defile, or lane, that went through the wood,\nand then clapping in between them and the entrance, cut off their\nretreat so effectually that when they discovered us and fired, they\nwere instantly surrounded and cut in pieces, the officers who\ncommanded them and eight dragoons only being made prisoners.\n\nThis made the prince halt, not knowing what the case was or how strong\nwe were, and, to get better intelligence, sent two hundred horse to\nsurround or skirt the wood and beat up our quarter, and in the interim\nthe Count de Tesse appeared in his rear. We found the strait he was in\nby the noise of our own troops at a distance; so we resolved to engage\nthe two hundred horse immediately. Accordingly our little troop of\nhorse drew up in the entrance of the lane and offered to skirmish, and\nour foot, lying behind the hedge which went round the wood, stood\nready to act as occasion should offer. The horse, being attacked, gave\nway, and retired into the lane; but the Germans were too old for us\nthere. They contented themselves to push us to the entrance, but would\nnot be drawn into a narrow pass without knowing whether the hedges\nwere lined or no.\n\nBut the prince, finding the French in his rear, and not being strong\nenough to engage again, resolved to force his way through, and\ncommanded his dragoons to alight and enter the wood, to clear the\nhedges on either side the lane, that he might pass with his cavalry.\nThis they did so vigorously, and were so much too strong for us, that\nthough we made good our ground a long time, yet our men were almost\nhalf of them cut in pieces. However, we gave time to the French\ncavalry to come up, and to fall on the prince's troops and cut them\noff, and take a great many prisoners, and then we retreated in our\nturn, opening a gap for our own horse to break in. Three hundred of\nthe dragoons were killed, and two hundred of them taken prisoners.\n\nIn the first heat of this action, a German officer of dragoons, well\nfollowed, had knocked down three men that stood next me; and, offering\nme quarter, I was obliged to accept it, and gave him my sword; for our\nmen were upon the point of quitting their post and shifting every one\nas they could. But the scale was turned, for our cavalry breaking in,\nas above, the dragoons went to wreck, and the officer who had me\nprisoner, turning to me, said, \"We are all lost.\" I asked him if I\ncould serve him. \"Stand still a little,\" says he; for his men fought\nmost desperately indeed. But about two hundred French horse appearing\nin his rear too, he said to me in French, \"I will be your prisoner,\"\nand returning me my sword, gave me also his own. A dragoon that stood\nnear him was just going to do the like, when he was shot dead, and the\nhorse coming up, the field was cleared in an instant. But Prince\nCommercy went off with the rest of his party, and was pursued no\nfarther.\n\nThere were sixteen or seventeen of our men released, as I was, from\nbeing taken; but they had not the luck I had, to take the officer that\nhad them in keeping. He had been so generous to me as not to ask what\nmoney I had about me, though I had not much if he had. But I lost by\nhis civility, for then I could not have the assurance to ask him for\nhis money, though I understood he had near a hundred pistoles about\nhim. But he very handsomely at night, when we came to our tents, made\nme a present of twenty pistoles, and in return I obtained leave for\nhim to go to Prince Eugene's camp upon his parole, which he did, and\nso got himself exchanged.\n\nIt was after this campaign that I was quartered at Cremona, when the\naction happened there of which I have spoken already, and where our\nIrish regiment did such service that they saved the town from being\nreally surprised, and indeed beat the Germans out again, after they\nhad been masters of three-quarters of the town six hours, and by which\nthey gained a very great reputation.\n\nBut I hasten on to my own history, for I am not writing a journal of\nthe wars, in which I had no long share.\n\nThe summer after this our two Irish regiments were drawn out into the\nfield, and had many a sore brush with the Germans; for Prince Eugene,\na vigilant general, gave us little rest, and gained many advantages by\nhis continual moving up and down, harassing his own men and ours too;\nand whoever will do the French justice, and knew how they had behaved,\nmust acknowledge they never declined the Germans, but fought them upon\nall occasions with the utmost resolution and courage; and though it\ncost the blood of an infinite number of fine gentlemen, as well as\nprivate soldiers, yet the Duke de Vend\u00c3\u00b4me, who now commanded, though\nKing Philip was himself in the army this campaign, made the Prince of\nSavoy a full return in his own kind, and drove him from post to post,\ntill he was just at the point of quitting the whole country of Italy.\nAll that gallant army Prince Eugene brought with him into Italy, which\nwas the best without doubt, for the goodness of the troops, that ever\nwere there, laid their bones in that country, and many thousands more\nafter them, till, the affairs of France declining in other places,\nthey were forced in their turn to give way to their fate, as may be\nseen in the histories of those times, as above. But it is none of my\nbusiness.\n\nThe part that I bore in these affairs was but short and sharp. We took\nthe field about the beginning of July 1702, and the Duke de Vend\u00c3\u00b4me\nordered the whole army to draw the sooner together, in order to\nrelieve the city of Mantua, which was blocked up by the imperialists.\n\nPrince Eugene was a politic, and indeed a fortunate, prince, and had\nthe year before pushed our army upon many occasions. But his good\nfortune began to fail him a little this year, for our army was not\nonly more numerous than his, but the duke was in the field before him;\nand as the prince had held Mantua closely blocked up all the winter,\nthe duke resolved to relieve the town, cost what it would. As I said,\nthe duke was first in the field; the prince was in no condition to\nprevent his raising the blockade by force; so he drew off his troops,\nand leaving several strong bodies of troops to protect Bersello, which\nthe Duke de Vend\u00c3\u00b4me threatened, and Borgo Fort, where his magazine\nlay, he drew all the rest of his forces together, to make head against\nus. By this time the king of Spain was come into the army, and the\nDuke de Vend\u00c3\u00b4me lay with about thirty-five thousand men near Luzara,\nwhich he had resolved to attack, to bring Prince Eugene to a battle.\nThe Prince of Vaudemont lay intrenched with twenty thousand more at\nRivalto, behind Mantua, to cover the frontiers of Milan, and there was\nnear twelve thousand in Mantua itself; and Monsieur Pracontal lay with\nten thousand men just under the cannon of one of the forts which guard\nthe causeway which leads into the city of Mantua; so that, had all\nthese joined, as they would have done in a few days more, the prince\nmust have been put to his shifts, and would have had enough to do to\nhave maintained himself in Italy; for he was master of no one place in\nthe country that could have held out a formal siege of fifteen days'\nopen trenches, and he knew all this very well; and therefore it seems,\nwhile the Duke of Vend\u00c3\u00b4me resolved, if possible, to bring him to a\nbattle, and to that end made dispositions to attack Luzara, we were\nsurprised to find, the 15th of June 1702, the whole imperial army\nappeared in _battalia_, and in full march, to attack us.\n\nAs it happened, our army was all marching in columns towards them, as\nwe had done for two days before; and I should have told you that,\nthree days before, the duke having noticed that General Visconti, with\nthree imperial regiments of horse and one of dragoons, was posted at\nSan-Victoria, on the Tessona, he resolved to attack them; and this\ndesign was carried so secretly, that while Monsieur Visconti, though\nour army was three leagues another way, was passing towards the\nModenese, he found himself unexpectedly attacked by six thousand horse\nand dragoons of the French army. He defended himself very bravely for\nnear an hour; when, being overpowered, and finding he should be forced\ninto disorder, he sounded a retreat. But the squadrons had not faced\nabout to make their retreat scarce a quarter of an hour, when they\nfound themselves surrounded with a great body of infantry, who had\nentirely cut off their retreat, except over the bridge of Tessona,\nwhich being thronged with their baggage, they could neither get\nbackward or forward; so they thrust and tumbled over one another in\nsuch a manner that they could preserve no kind of order; but abundance\nfell into the river and were drowned, many were killed, and more taken\nprisoners; so that, in a word, the whole three regiments of horse and\none of dragoons were entirely defeated.\n\nThis was a great blow to the prince, because they were some of the\nchoicest troops of his whole army. We took about four hundred\nprisoners, and all their baggage, which was a very considerable booty,\nand about eight hundred horses; and no doubt these troops were very\nmuch wanted in the battle that ensued on the 15th, as I have said. Our\narmy being in full march, as above, to attack Luzara, a party of\nGermans appeared, being about six hundred horse, and in less than an\nhour more their whole army, in order of battle.\n\nOur army formed immediately, and the duke posted the regiments as they\ncame up so much to their advantage that Prince Eugene was obliged to\nalter his dispositions, and had this particular inconvenience upon his\nhands, viz., to attack an army superior to his own, in all their most\nadvantageous posts; whereas, had he thought fit to have waited but one\nday, we should have met him half-way. But this was owing to the pride\nof the German generals, and their being so opinionated of the goodness\nof their troops. The royal army was posted with the left to the great\nriver Po, on the other side of which the Prince of Vaudemont's army\nlay cannonading the intrenchments which the imperialists had made at\nBorgo Fort; and hearing that there was like to be a general battle, he\ndetached twelve battalions and about a thousand horse, to reinforce\nthe royal army; all which, to our great encouragement, had time to\njoin the army, while Prince Eugene was making his new dispositions for\nthe attack. And yet it was the coming of these troops which caused\nPrince Eugene to resolve to begin the fight, expecting to have come to\nan action before they could come up. But he was disappointed in the\nreason of fighting, and yet was obliged to fight too, which was an\nerror in the prince that it was too late to retrieve.\n\nIt was five o'clock in the evening before he could bring up his whole\nline to engage; and then, after having cannonaded us to no great\npurpose for half-an-hour, his right, commanded by the Prince de\nCommercy, attacked our left wing with great fury. Our men received\nthem so well and seconded one another so punctually that they were\nrepulsed with a very great slaughter; and the Prince de Commercy\nbeing, unhappily for them, killed in the first onset, the regiments,\nfor want of orders, and surprised with the fall of so great a man,\nwere pushed into disorder, and one whole brigade was entirely broke.\n\nBut their second line, advancing under General Herbeville, restored\nthings in the first. The battalions rallied, and they came boldly on\nto charge a second time, and being seconded with new reinforcements\nfrom their main body, our men had their turn, and were pushed to a\ncanal which lay on their left flank between them and the Po, behind\nwhich they rallied; and being supported by new troops, as well horse\nas foot, they fought on both sides with the utmost obstinacy, and with\nsuch courage and skill that it was not possible to judge who should\nhave had the better could they have been able to have fought it out.\n\nOn the right of the royal army was posted the flower of the French\ncavalry--namely, the gendarmes, the royal carbineers, and the queen's\nhorse-guards, with four hundred horse more--and next them the\ninfantry, among which were our brigade. The horse advanced first to\ncharge, and they carried all before them sword in hand, receiving the\nfire of two imperial regiments of cuirassiers without firing a shot,\nand falling in among them, bore them down by the strength of their\nhorses, putting them into confusion, and left so clear a field for us\nto follow that the first line of our infantry stood drawn up upon the\nground which the enemy at first possessed.\n\nIn this first attack the Marquis de Crequi, who commanded the whole\nright wing, was killed--a loss which fully balanced the death of the\nPrince de Commercy on the side of the Germans. After we had thus\npushed the enemy's cavalry, as above, their troops, being rallied by\nthe dexterity of their generals and supported by three imperial\nregiments of foot, came on again to the charge with such fury that\nnothing could withstand them. And here two battalions of our Irish\nregiments were put into disorder, and abundance of our men killed; and\nhere also I had the misfortune to receive a musket-shot, which broke\nmy left arm; and that was not all, for I was knocked down by a\ngiant-like German soldier, who, when he thought he had killed me, set\nhis foot upon me, but was immediately shot dead by one of my men, and\nfell just upon me, which, my arm being broken, was a very great\nmischief to me; for the very weight of the fellow, who was almost as\nbig as a horse, was such that I was not able to stir.\n\nOur men were beaten back after this from the place where they stood;\nand so I was left in possession of the enemy, but was not their\nprisoner--that is to say, was not found till next morning, when a\nparty being sent, as usual, with surgeons to look after the wounded\nmen among the dead, found me almost smothered with the dead Germans\nand others that lay near me. However, to do them justice, they used me\nwith humanity, and the surgeons set my arm very skilfully and well;\nand four or five days after, I had liberty to go to Parma upon parole.\n\nBoth the armies continued fighting, especially on our left, till it\nwas so dark that it was impossible to know who they fired at, or for\nthe generals to see what they did; so they abated firing gradually,\nand, as it may be truly said, the night parted them.\n\nBoth sides claimed the victory, and both concealed their losses as\nmuch as it was possible; but it is certain that never battle was\nfought with greater bravery and obstinacy than this was; and had there\nbeen daylight to have fought it out, doubtless there would have been\nmany thousand more men killed on both sides.\n\nAll the Germans had to entitle them to the victory was, that they made\nour left retire, as I have said, to the canal, and to the high banks\nor mounds on the edge of the Po; but they had so much advantage in the\nretreat--they fired from thence among the thickest of the enemy, and\ncould never be forced from their posts.\n\nThe best testimony the royal army had of the victory, and which was\ncertainly the better of the two, was, that, two days after the fight,\nthey attacked Guastalia, as it were in view of the German army, and\nforced the garrison to surrender, and to swear not to serve again for\nsix months, which, they being fifteen hundred men, was a great loss to\nthe Germans; and yet Prince Eugene did not offer to relieve it. And\nafter that we took several other posts which the imperialists had\npossession of, but were obliged to quit them upon the approach of the\nFrench army, not being in a condition to fight another battle that\nyear.\n\nMy campaign was now at an end, and though I came lame off, I came off\nmuch better than abundance of gentlemen; for in that bloody battle we\nhad above four hundred officers killed or wounded, whereof three were\ngeneral officers.\n\nThe campaign held on till December, and the Duke de Vend\u00c3\u00b4me took Borgo\nFort and several other places from the Germans, who, in short, lost\nground every day in Italy. I was a prisoner a great while, and there\nbeing no cartel settled, Prince Eugene ordered the French prisoners to\nbe sent into Hungary, which was a cruelty that could not be reasonably\nexercised on them. However, a great many, by that banishment, found\nmeans to make their escape to the Turks, by whom they were kindly\nreceived, and the French ambassador at Constantinople took care of\nthem, and shipped them back again into Italy at the king's charge.\n\nBut the Duke de Vend\u00c3\u00b4me now took so many German prisoners that Prince\nEugene was tired of sending his prisoners to Hungary, and was obliged\nto be at the charge of bringing some of them back again whom he had\nsent thither, and come to agree to a general exchange of prisoners.\n\nI was, as I have said, allowed for a time to go to Parma upon my\nparole, where I continued for the recovery of my wound and broken arm\nforty days, and was then obliged to render myself to the commanding\nofficer at Ferrara, where Prince Eugene coming soon after, I was, with\nseveral other prisoners of war, sent away into the Milanese, to be\nkept for an exchange of prisoners.\n\nIt was in the city of Trent that I continued about eight months. The\nman in whose house I quartered was exceedingly civil to me, and took a\ngreat deal of care of me, and I lived very easy. Here I contracted a\nkind of familiarity, perfectly undesigned by me, with the daughter of\nthe burgher at whose house I had lodged, and, I know not by what\nfatality that was upon me, I was prevailed with afterwards to marry\nher. This was a piece of honesty on my side which I must acknowledge I\nnever intended to be guilty of; but the girl was too cunning for me,\nfor she found means to get some wine into my head more than I used to\ndrink, and though I was not so disordered with it but that I knew very\nwell what I did, yet in an unusual height of good humour I consented\nto be married. This impolitic piece of honesty put me to many\ninconveniences, for I knew not what to do with this clog which I had\nloaded myself with. I could neither stay with her or take her with me,\nso that I was exceedingly perplexed.\n\nThe time came soon after that I was released by the cartel, and so was\nobliged to go to my regiment, which then was in quarters in the\nMilanese, and from thence I got leave to go to Paris, upon my promise\nto raise some recruits in England for the Irish regiments, by the help\nof my correspondence there. Having thus leave to go to Paris, I took a\npassport from the enemy's army to go to Trent, and making a long\ncircuit, I went back thither, and very honestly packed up my baggage,\nwife and all, and brought her away through Tyrol into Bavaria, and so\nthrough Suabia and the Black Forest into Alsatia; from thence I came\ninto Lorraine, and so to Paris.\n\nI had now a secret design to quit the war, for I really had had enough\nof fighting. But it was counted so dishonourable a thing to quit while\nthe army was in the field that I could not dispense with it; but an\nintervening accident made that part easy to me. The war was now\nrenewed between France and England and Holland, just as it was before;\nand the French king, meditating nothing more than how to give the\nEnglish a diversion, fitted out a strong squadron of men-of-war and\nfrigates at Dunkirk, on board of which he embarked a body of troops of\nabout six thousand five hundred men, besides volunteers; and the new\nking, as we called him, though more generally he was called the\nChevalier de St. George, was shipped along with them, and all for\nScotland.\n\nI pretended a great deal of zeal for this service, and that if I might\nbe permitted to sell my company in the Irish regiment I was in, and\nhave the chevalier's brevet for a colonel, in case of raising troops\nfor him in Great Britain after his arrival, I would embark volunteer\nand serve at my own expense. The latter gave me a great advantage with\nthe chevalier; for now I was esteemed as a man of consideration, and\none that must have a considerable interest in my own country. So I\nobtained leave to sell my company, and having had a good round sum of\nmoney remitted me from London, by the way of Holland, I prepared a\nvery handsome equipage, and away I went to Dunkirk to embark.\n\nI was very well received by the chevalier; and as he had an account\nthat I was an officer in the Irish brigade, and had served in Italy,\nand consequently was an old soldier, all this added to the character\nwhich I had before, and made me have a great deal of honour paid me,\nthough at the same time I had no particular attachment to his person\nor to his cause. Nor indeed did I much consider the cause of one side\nor other. If I had, I should hardly have risked, not my life only, but\neffects too, which were all, as I might say, from that moment\nforfeited to the English government, and were too evidently in their\npower to confiscate at their pleasure.\n\nHowever, having just received a remittance from London of \u00c2\u00a3300\nsterling, and sold my company in the Irish regiment for very near as\nmuch, I was not only insensibly drawn in, but was perfectly volunteer\nin that dull cause, and away I went with them at all hazards. It\nbelongs very little to my history to give an account of that fruitless\nexpedition, only to tell you that, being so closely and effectually\nchased by the English fleet, which was superior in force to the\nFrench, I may say that, in escaping them, I escaped being hanged.\n\nIt was the good fortune of the French that they overshot the port they\naimed at, and intending for the Frith of Forth, or, as it is called,\nthe Frith of Edinburgh, the first land they made was as far north as a\nplace called Montrose, where it was not their business to land, and so\nthey were obliged to come back to the frith, and were gotten to the\nentrance of it, and came to an anchor for the tide. But this delay or\nhindrance gave time to the English, under Sir George Byng, to come to\nthe frith, and they came to an anchor, just as we did, only waiting to\ngo up the frith with the flood.\n\nHad we not overshot the port, as above, all our squadron had been\ndestroyed in two days, and all we could have done had been to have\ngotten into the pier or haven at Leith with the smaller frigates, and\nhave landed the troops and ammunition; but we must have set fire to\nthe men-of-war, for the English squadron was not above twenty-four\nhours behind us, or thereabout.\n\nUpon this surprise, the French admiral set sail from the north point\nof the frith where we lay, and crowding away to the north, got the\nstart of the English fleet, and made their escape, with the loss of\none ship only, which, being behind the rest, could not get away.\n\nWhen we were satisfied the English left chasing us, which was not till\nthe third night, when we altered our course and lost sight of them, we\nstood over to the coast of Norway, and keeping that shore on board all\nthe way to the mouth of the Baltic, we came to an anchor again, and\nsent two scouts abroad to learn news, to see if the sea was clear; and\nbeing satisfied that the enemy did not chase us, we kept on with an\neasier sail, and came all back again to Dunkirk; and glad I was to set\nmy foot on shore again; for all the while we were thus flying for our\nlives I was under the greatest terror imaginable, and nothing but\nhalters and gibbets run in my head, concluding that, if I had been\ntaken, I should certainly have been hanged.\n\nBut the care was now over. I took my leave of the chevalier, and of\nthe army, and made haste to Paris. I came so unexpectedly to Paris,\nand to my own lodgings, that it was my misfortune to make a discovery\nrelating to my wife which was not at all to my satisfaction; for I\nfound her ladyship had kept some company that I had reason to believe\nwere not such as an honest woman ought to have conversed with, and as\nI knew her temper by what I had found of her myself, I grew very\njealous and uneasy about her. I must own it touched me very nearly,\nfor I began to have an extraordinary value for her, and her behaviour\nwas very taking, especially after I had brought her into France; but\nhaving a vein of levity, it was impossible to prevent her running into\nsuch things in a town so full of what they call gallantry as Paris.\n\nIt vexed me also to think that it should be my fate to be a cuckold\nboth abroad and at home, and sometimes I would be in such a rage about\nit that I had no government of myself when I thought of it. Whole\ndays, and I may say sometimes whole nights, I spent musing and\nconsidering what I should do to her, and especially what I should do\nto the villain, whoever he was, that had thus abused and supplanted\nme. Here indeed I committed murder more than once, or indeed than a\nhundred times, in my imagination; and, as the devil is certainly an\napparent prompter to wickedness, if he is not the first mover of it in\nour minds, he teased me night and day with proposals to kill my wife.\n\nThis horrid project he carried up so high, by raising fierce thoughts\nand fomenting the blood upon my contemplation of the word cuckold,\nthat, in short, I left debating whether I should murder her or no, as\na thing out of the question, and determined; and my thoughts were then\ntaken up only with the management how I should kill her, and how to\nmake my escape after I had done it.\n\nAll this while I had no sufficient evidence of her guilt, neither had\nI so much as charged her with it or let her know I suspected her,\notherwise than as she might perceive it in my conduct, and in the\nchange of my behaviour to her, which was such that she could not but\nperceive that something troubled me. Yet she took no notice of it to\nme, but received me very well, and showed herself to be glad of my\nreturn. Nor did I find she had been extravagant in her expenses while\nI was abroad. But jealousy, as the wise man says, is the wrath of a\nman; her being so good a hussy at what money I had left her gave my\ndistempered fancy an opinion that she had been maintained by other\npeople, and so had had no occasion to spend.\n\nI must confess she had a difficult point here upon her, though she had\nbeen really honest; for, as my head was prepossessed of her\ndishonesty, if she had been lavish I should have said she had spent it\nupon her gentlemen; and as she had been frugal, I said she had been\nmaintained by them. Thus, I say, my head was distempered; I believed\nmyself abused, and nothing could put it out of my thoughts night or\nday.\n\nAll this while it was not visibly broken out between us; but I was so\nfully possessed with the belief of it that I seemed to want no\nevidence, and I looked with an evil eye upon everybody that came near\nher or that she conversed with. There was an officer of the Guards du\nCorps that lodged in the same house with us, a very honest gentleman\nand a man of quality. I happened to be in a little drawing-room\nadjoining to a parlour where my wife sat at that time, and this\ngentleman came into the parlour, which, as he was one of the family,\nhe might have done without offence; but he, not knowing that I was in\nthe drawing-room, sat down and talked with my wife. I heard every word\nthey said, for the door between us was open; nor could I say that\nthere passed anything between them but cursory discourse. They talked\nof casual things, of a young lady, a burgher's daughter of nineteen,\nthat had been married the week before to an advocate in the Parliament\nof Paris, vastly rich, and about sixty-three; and of another, a widow\nlady of fortune in Paris, that had married her deceased husband's\n_valet de chamber_; and of such casual matters, that I could find no\nfault with her now at all.\n\nBut it filled my head with jealous thoughts and fired my temper. Now I\nfancied he used too much freedom with her, then that she used too much\nfreedom to him, and once or twice I was upon the point of breaking in\nupon them and affronting them both, but I restrained myself. At length\nhe talked some thing merrily of the lady throwing away her maiden\nhead, as I understood it, upon an old man; but still it was nothing\nindecent. But I, who was all on fire already, could bear it no longer,\nbut started up and came into the room, and catching at my wife's\nwords, \"Say you so, madam?\" said I. \"Was he too old for her?\" and\ngiving the officer a look that I fancy was something akin to the face\non the sign called the Bull and Mouth, within Aldersgate, I went out\ninto the street.\n\nThe marquis--so he was styled--a man of honour and of spirit too, took\nit as I meant it, and followed me in a moment and \"hemmed\" after me in\nthe street; upon which I stopped, and he came up to me. \"Sir,\" said\nhe, \"our circumstances are very unhappy in France, that we cannot do\nourselves justice here without the most severe treatment in the world.\nBut, come on it what will, you must explain yourself to me on the\nsubject of your behaviour just now.\"\n\nI was a little cooled as to the point of my conduct to him in the very\nfew moments that had passed, and was very sensible that I was wrong to\nhim; and I said, therefore, to him, very frankly, \"Sir, you are a\ngentleman whom I know very well, and I have a very great respect for\nyou; but I had been disturbed a little about the conduct of my wife,\nand were it your own case, what would you have done less?\"\n\n\"I am sorry for any dislike between you and your wife,\" says he; \"but\nwhat is that to me? Can you charge me with any indecency to her,\nexcept my talking so and so?\" (at which he repeated the words); \"and\nas I knew you were in the next room and heard every word, and that all\nthe doors were open, I thought no man could have taken amiss so\ninnocent an expression.\"\n\n\"I could no otherwise take it amiss,\" said I, \"than as I thought it\nimplied a farther familiarity, and that you cannot expect should be\nborne by any man of honour. However, sir,\" said I, \"I spoke only to my\nwife. I said nothing to you, but gave you my hat as I passed you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"and a look as full of rage as the devil. Are there no\nwords in such looks?\"\n\n\"I can say nothing to that,\" said I, \"for I cannot see my own\ncountenance; but my rage, as you call it, was at my wife, not at you.\"\n\n\"But hark you, sir,\" said he, growing warm as I grew calm, \"your anger\nat your wife was for her discourse with me, and I think that concerns\nme too, and I ought to resent it.\"\n\n\"I think not, sir,\" said I; \"nor, had I found you in bed with my wife,\nwould I have quarrelled with you; for if my wife will let you lie with\nher, it is she is the offender. What have I to do with you? You could\nnot lie with her if she was not willing; and if she is willing to be a\nwhore, I ought to punish her; but I should have no quarrel with you. I\nwill lie with your wife if I can, and then I am even with you.\"\n\nI spoke this all in good humour and in order to pacify him, but it\nwould not do; but he would have me give him satisfaction, as he called\nit. I told him I was a stranger in the country, and perhaps should\nfind little mercy in their course of justice; that it was not my\nbusiness to fight any man in his vindicating his keeping company with\nmy wife, for that the injury was mine, in having a bad woman to deal\nwith; that there was no reason in the thing, that after any man should\nhave found the way into my bed, I, who am injured, should go and stake\nmy life upon an equal hazard against the man who has abused me.\n\nNothing would prevail with this person to be quiet for all this; but I\nhad affronted him, and no satisfaction could be made him but that at\nthe point of the sword; so we agreed to go away together to Lisle, in\nFlanders. I was now soldier enough not to be afraid to look a man in\nthe face, and as the rage at my wife inspired me with courage, so he\nlet fall a word that fired and provoked me beyond all patience; for,\nspeaking of the distrust I had of my wife, he said, unless I had good\ninformation I ought not to suspect my wife. I told him, if I had good\ninformation, I should be past suspicion. He replied, if he was the\nhappy man, that had so much of her favour, he would take care then to\nput me past the suspicion. I gave him as rough an answer as he could\ndesire, and he returned in French, _\"Nous verrons \u00c3\u00a0 Lisle_;\" that is\nto say, \"We will talk further of it at Lisle.\"\n\nI told him I did not see the benefit either to him or me of going so\nfar as Lisle to decide this quarrel, since now I perceived he was the\nman I wanted; that we might decide this quarrel _au champ_, upon the\nspot, and whoever had the fortune to fall the other might make his\nescape to Lisle as well afterwards as before.\n\nThus we walked on talking very ill-naturedly on both sides, and yet\nvery mannerly, till we came clear of the suburbs of Paris, on the way\nto Charenton; when, seeing the way clear, I told him under those trees\nwas a very fit place for us, pointing to a row of trees adjoining to\nMonsieur ----'s garden-wall. So we went thither, and fell to work\nimmediately. After some fencing he made a home-thrust at me, and run\nme into my arm, a long slanting wound, but at the same time received\nmy point into his body, and soon after fell. He spoke some words\nbefore he dropped; first he told me I had killed him; then he said he\nhad indeed wronged me, and as he knew it, he ought not to have fought\nme. He desired I would make my escape immediately, which I did into\nthe city, but no farther, nobody, as I thought, having seen us\ntogether. In the afternoon, about six hours after the action,\nmessengers brought news, one on the heels of another, that the marquis\nwas mortally wounded, and carried into a house at Charenton. That\naccount, saying he was not dead, surprised me a little, not doubting\nbut that, concluding I had made my escape, he would own who it was.\nHowever, I discovered nothing of my concern, but, going up into my\nchamber, I took out of a cabinet there what money I had, which indeed\nwas so much as I thought would be sufficient for my expenses. But\nhaving an accepted bill for two thousand livres, I walked sedately to\na merchant who knew me, and got fifty pistoles of him upon my bill,\nletting him know my business called me to England, and I would take\nthe rest of him when he had received it.\n\nHaving furnished myself thus, I provided me a horse for my servant,\nfor I had one very good one of my own, and once more ventured home to\nmy lodging, where I heard again that the marquis was not dead. My wife\nall this while covered her concern for the marquis so well that she\ngave me no room to make any remark upon her; but she saw evidently the\nmarks of rage and deep resentment in my behaviour after some little\nstay, and perceiving me making preparation for a journey, she said to\nme, \"Are you going out of town?\" \"Yes, madam,\" says I, \"that you may\nhave room to mourn for your friend the marquis;\" at which she started,\nand showed she was indeed in a most terrible fright, and making a\nthousand crosses about herself, with a great many callings upon the\nBlessed Virgin and her country saints, she burst out at last, \"Is it\npossible? Are you the man that has killed the marquis? Then you are\nundone, and I too.\"\n\n\"You may, madam, be a loser by the marquis being killed; but I'll take\ncare to be as little a loser by you as I can. 'Tis enough; the marquis\nhas honestly confessed your guilt, and I have done with you.\" She\nwould have thrown herself into my arms, protesting her innocence, and\ntold me she would fly with me, and would convince me of her fidelity\nby such testimonies as I could not but be satisfied with, but I thrust\nher violently from me. \"_Allez, infame!_\" said I. \"Go, infamous\ncreature, and take from me the necessity I should be under, if I\nstayed, of sending you to keep company with your dear friend the\nmarquis.\" I thrust her away with such force that she fell backward\nupon the floor, and cried out most terribly, and indeed she had\nreason, for she was very much hurt.\n\nIt grieved me indeed to have thrust her away with such force, but you\nmust consider me now in the circumstances of a man enraged, and, as it\nwere, out of himself, furious and mad. However, I took her up from the\nfloor and laid her on the bed, and calling up her maid, bid her go and\ntake care of her mistress; and, going soon after out of doors, I took\nhorse and made the best of my way, not towards Calais or Dunkirk, or\ntowards Flanders, whither it might be suggested I was fled, and\nwhither they did pursue me the same evening, but I took the direct\nroad for Lorraine, and riding all night and very hard, I passed the\nMaine the next day at night, at Chalons, and came safe into the Duke\nof Lorraine's dominions the third day, where I rested one day only to\nconsider what course to take; for it was still a most difficult thing\nto pass any way, but that I should either be in the king of France's\ndominions or be taken by the French allies as a subject of France. But\ngetting good advice from a priest at Bar le Duc, who, though I did not\ntell him the particulars of my case, yet guessed how it was, it being,\nas he said, very usual for gentlemen in my circumstances to fly that\nway;--upon this supposition, this kind _padre_ got me a church pass;\nthat is to say, he made me a purveyor for the abbey of ----, and, as\nsuch, got me a passport to go to Deux Ponts, which belonged to the\nking of Sweden. Having such authority there, and the priest's\nrecommendation to an ecclesiastic in the place, I got passports from\nthence in the king of Sweden's name to Cologne, and then I was\nthoroughly safe. So, making my way to the Netherlands without any\ndifficulty, I came to the Hague, and from thence, though very\nprivately and by several names, I came to England. And thus I got\nclear of my Italian wife--whore I should have called her; for, after I\nhad made her so myself, how should I expect any other of her?\n\nBeing arrived at London, I wrote to my friend at Paris, but dated my\nletters from the Hague, where I ordered him to direct his answers. The\nchief business of my writing was to know if my bill was paid him, to\ninquire if any pursuit was made after me, and what other news he had\nabout me or my wife, and particularly how it had fared with the\nmarquis.\n\nI received an answer in a few days, importing that he had received the\nmoney on my bill, which he was ready to pay as I should direct; that\nthe marquis was not dead; \"but,\" said he, \"you have killed him another\nway, for he has lost his commission in the Guards, which was worth to\nhim twenty thousand livres, and he is yet a close prisoner in the\nBastile;\" that pursuit was ordered after me upon suspicion; that they\nhad followed me to Amiens, on the road to Dunkirk, and to Chastean de\nCambresis, on the way to Flanders, but missing me that way, had given\nit over; that the marquis had been too well instructed to own that he\nhad fought with me, but said that he was assaulted on the road, and\nunless I could be taken, he would take his trial and come off for want\nof proof; that my flying was a circumstance indeed that moved strongly\nagainst him, because it was known that we had had some words that day,\nand were seen to walk together, but that, nothing being proved on\neither side, he would come off with the loss of his commission, which,\nhowever, being very rich, he could bear well enough.\n\nAs to my wife, he wrote me word she was inconsolable, and had cried\nherself to death almost; but he added (very ill-natured indeed),\nwhether it was for me or for the marquis, that he could not determine.\nHe likewise told me she was in very bad circumstances and very low, so\nthat, if I did not take some care of her, she would come to be in very\ngreat distress.\n\nThe latter part of this story moved me indeed, for I thought, however\nit was, I ought not to let her starve; and, besides, poverty was a\ntemptation which a woman could not easily withstand, and I ought not\nto be the instrument to drive her to a horrid necessity of crime, if I\ncould prevent it.\n\nUpon this I wrote to him again to go to her, and talk with her, and\nlearn as much as he could of her particular circumstances; and that,\nif he found she was really in want, and, particularly, that she did\nnot live a scandalous life, he should give her twenty pistoles, and\ntell her, if she would engage to live retired and honestly, she should\nhave so much annually, which was enough to subsist her.\n\nShe took the first twenty pistoles, but bade him tell me that I had\nwronged her and unjustly charged her, and I ought to do her justice;\nand I had ruined her by exposing her in such a manner as I had, having\nno proof of my charge or ground for any suspicion; that, as to twenty\npistoles a year, it was a mean allowance to a wife that had travelled\nover the world, as she had done with me, and the like; and so\nexpostulated with him to obtain forty pistoles a year of me, which I\nconsented to. But she never gave me the trouble of paying above one\nyear; for after that the marquis was so fond of her again that he took\nher away to himself, and, as my friend wrote me word, had settled four\nhundred crowns a year on her, and I never heard any more of her.\n\nI was now in London, but was obliged to be very retired and change my\nname, letting nobody in the nation know who I was, except my merchant\nby whom I corresponded with my people in Virginia; and particularly\nwith my tutor, who was now become the head manager of my affairs, and\nwas in very good circumstances himself also by my means. But he\ndeserved all I did or could do for him, for he was a most faithful\nfriend as well as servant, as ever man had, in that country at least.\n\nI was not the easiest man alive, in the retired, solitary manner I now\nlived in; and I experienced the truth of the text, that \"it is not\ngood for man to be alone,\" for I was extremely melancholy and heavy,\nand indeed knew not what to do with myself, particularly because I was\nunder some restraint, that I was too afraid to go abroad. At last I\nresolved to go quite away, and go to Virginia again, and there live\nretired as I could.\n\nBut when I came to consider that part more narrowly, I could not\nprevail with myself to live a private life. I had got a wandering kind\nof taste, and knowledge of things begat a desire of increasing it, and\nan exceeding delight I had in it, though I had nothing to do in the\narmies or in war, and did not design ever to meddle with it again. Yet\nI could not live in the world and not inquire what was doing in it;\nnor could I think of living in Virginia, where I was to hear my news\ntwice a year, and read the public accounts of what was just then upon\nthe stocks, as the history of things past.\n\nThis was my notion: I was now in my native country, where my\ncircumstances were easy, and though I had ill-luck abroad, for I\nbrought little money home with me, yet, by a little good management, I\nmight soon have money by me. I had nobody to keep but myself, and my\nplantations in Virginia generally returned me from \u00c2\u00a3400 to \u00c2\u00a3600 a\nyear, one year above \u00c2\u00a3700, and to go thither, I concluded, was to be\nburied alive; so I put off all thoughts of it, and resolved to settle\nsomewhere in England where I might know everybody and nobody know me.\nI was not long in concluding where to pitch, for as I spoke the French\ntongue perfectly well, having been so many years among them, it was\neasy for me to pass for a Frenchman. So I went to Canterbury, called\nmyself an Englishman among the French, and a Frenchman among the\nEnglish; and on that score was the more perfectly concealed, going by\nthe name of Monsieur Charnot with the French, and was called Mr.\nCharnock among the English.\n\nHere indeed I lived perfectly incog. I made no particular acquaintance\nso as to be intimate, and yet I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.\nI discoursed in common, talked French with the Walloons, and English\nwith the English; and lived retired and sober, and was well enough\nreceived by all sorts; but as I meddled with nobody's business, so\nnobody meddled with mine; I thought I lived pretty well.\n\nBut I was not fully satisfied. A settled family life was the thing I\nloved; had made two pushes at it, as you have heard, but with\nill-success; yet the miscarriage of what was past did not discourage\nme at all, but I resolved to marry. I looked out for a woman as\nsuitable as I could, but always found some thing or other to shock my\nfancy, except once a gentleman's daughter of good fashion; but I met\nwith so many repulses of one kind or another that I was forced to give\nit over; and indeed, though I might be said to be a lover in this\nsuit, and had managed myself so well with the young lady that I had no\ndifficulty left but what would soon have been adjusted, yet her father\nwas so difficult, made so many objections, was to-day not pleased one\nway, to-morrow another, that he would stand by nothing that he himself\nhad proposed, nor could he be ever brought to be of the same mind two\ndays together; so that we at last put an end to the pretensions, for\nshe would not marry without her father's consent, and I would not\nsteal her, and so that affair ended.\n\nI cannot say but I was a little vexed at the dis appointment of\nthis, so I left the city of Canterbury and went to London in the\nstage-coach. Here I had an odd scene presented as ever happened of its\nkind.\n\nThere was in the stage-coach a young woman and her maid. She was\nsitting in a very melancholy posture, for she was in the coach before\nme, and sighed most dreadfully all the way, and whenever her maid\nspoke to her she burst out into tears. I was not long in the coach\nwith her but, seeing she made such a dismal figure, I offered to\ncomfort her a little, and inquired into the occasion of her\naffliction. But she would not speak a word; but her maid, with a force\nof crying too, said her master was dead, at which word the lady burst\nout again into a passion of crying, and between mistress and maid this\nwas all I could get for the morning part of that day. When we came to\ndine, I offered the lady, that seeing, I supposed, she would not dine\nwith the company, if she would please to dine with me, I would dine in\na separate room; for the rest of the company were foreigners. Her maid\nthanked me in her mistresses name, but her mistress could eat nothing,\nand desired to be private.\n\nHere, however, I had some discourse with the maid, from whom I learned\nthat the lady was wife to a captain of a ship, who was outward bound\nto somewhere in the Straits--I think it was to Zante and Venice; that,\nbeing gone no farther than the Downs, he was taken sick, and after\nabout ten days' illness had died at Deal; that his wife, hearing of\nhis sickness, had gone to Deal to see him, and had come but just time\nenough to see him die; had stayed there to bury him, and was now\ncoming to London in a sad, disconsolate condition indeed.\n\nI heartily pitied the young gentlewoman indeed, and said some things\nto her in the coach to let her know I did so, which she gave no answer\nto, but in civility now and then made a bow, but never gave me the\nleast opportunity to see her face, or so much as to know whether she\nhad a face or no, much less to guess what form of a face it was. It\nwas winter time, and the coach put up at Rochester, not going through\nin a day, as was usual in summer; and a little before we came to\nRochester I told the lady I understood she had ate nothing to-day,\nthat such a course would but make her sick, and, doing her harm, could\ndo her deceased husband no good; and therefore I entreated her that,\nas I was a stranger, and only offered a civility to her in order to\nabate her severely afflicting herself, she would yield so far to\nmatters of ceremony as let us sup together as passengers; for, as to\nthe strangers, they did not seem to understand the custom or to desire\nit.\n\nShe bowed, but gave no answer; only, after pressing her by arguments,\nwhich she could not deny was very civil and kind, she returned, she\ngave me thanks, but she could not eat. \"Well, madam,\" said I, \"do but\nsit down; though you think you cannot eat, perhaps you may eat a bit.\nIndeed you must eat, or you will destroy yourself at this rate of\nliving, and upon the road too; in a word, you will be sick indeed.\" I\nargued with her. The maid put in, and said, \"Do, madam; pray try to\ndivert yourself a little.\" I pressed her again, and she bowed to me\nvery respectfully, but still said, \"No,\" and she could not eat. The\nmaid continued to importune her, and said, \"Dear madam, do. The\ngentleman is a civil gentleman; pray, madam, do;\" and then, turning to\nme, said, \"My mistress will, sir, I hope,\" and seemed pleased, and\nindeed was so.\n\nHowever, I went on to persuade her; and, taking no notice of what her\nmaid said, that I was a civil gentleman, I told her, \"I am a stranger\nto you, madam; but if I thought you were shy of me on any account, as\nto civility, I will send my supper up to you in your own chamber, and\nstay below myself.\" She bowed then to me twice, and looked up, which\nwas the first time, and said she had no suspicion of that kind; that\nmy offer was so civil that she was as much ashamed to refuse it as she\nshould be ashamed to accept it, if she was where she was known; that\nshe thought I was not quite a stranger to her, for she had seen me\nbefore; that she would accept my offer so far as to sit at table,\nbecause I desired it; but she could not promise me to eat, and that\nshe hoped I would take the other as a constraint upon her, in return\nto so much kindness.\n\nShe startled me when she said she had seen me before; for I had not\nthe least knowledge of her, nor did I remember so much as to have\nheard of her name; for I had asked her name of her maid; and indeed it\nmade me almost repent my compliment, for it was many ways essential to\nme not to be known. However, I could not go back; and, besides, if I\nwas known, it was essentially necessary to me to know who it was that\nknew me, and by what circumstances; so I went on with my compliment.\n\nWe came to the inn but just before it was dark. I offered to hand my\nwidow out of the coach, and she could not decline it; but though her\nhoods were not then much over her face, yet, being dark, I could see\nlittle of her then. I waited on her then into the stairfoot, and led\nher up the inn-stairs to a dining-room which the master of the house\noffered to show us, as if for the whole company; but she declined\ngoing in there, and said she desired rather to go directly to her\nchamber, and turning to her maid, bade her speak to the innkeeper to\nshow her to her lodging-room. So I waited on her to the door, and took\nmy leave, telling her I would expect her at supper.\n\nIn order to treat her moderately well, and not extravagantly, for I\nhad no thoughts of anything farther than civility, which was the\neffect of mere compassion for the unhappiness of the most truly\ndisconsolate woman that I ever met with; I say, in order to treat her\nhandsomely, but not extravagantly, I provided what the house afforded,\nwhich was a couple of partridges and a very good dish of stewed\noysters. They brought us up afterwards a neat's tongue and a ham that\nwas almost cut quite down, but we ate none of it; for the other was\nfully enough for us both, and the maid made her supper off the oysters\nwe had left, which were enough.\n\nI mention this because it should appear I did not treat her as a\nperson I was making any court to, for I had nothing of that in my\nthoughts; but merely in pity to the poor woman, who I saw in a\ncircumstance that was indeed very unhappy.\n\nWhen I gave her maid notice that supper was ready, she fetched her\nmistress, coming in before her with a candle in her hand, and then it\nwas that I saw her face, and being in her dishabille, she had no hood\nover her eyes or black upon her head, when I was truly surprised to\nsee one of the most beautiful faces upon earth. I saluted her, and led\nher to the fireside, the table, though spread, being too far from the\nfire, the weather being cold.\n\nShe was now something sociable, though very grave, and sighed often on\naccount of her circumstances. But she so handsomely governed her\ngrief, yet so artfully made it mingle itself with all her discourse,\nthat it added exceedingly to her behaviour, which was every way most\nexquisitely genteel. I had a great deal of discourse with her, and\nupon many subjects, and by degrees took her name, that is to say, from\nherself, as I had done before from her maid; also the place where she\nlived, viz., near Ratcliff, or rather Stepney, where I asked her leave\nto pay her a visit when she thought fit to admit company, which she\nseemed to intimate would not be a great while.\n\nIt is a subject too surfeiting to entertain people with the beauty of\na person they will never see. Let it suffice to tell them she was the\nmost beautiful creature of her sex that I ever saw before or since;\nand it cannot be wondered if I was charmed with her the very first\nmoment I saw her face. Her behaviour was likewise a beauty in itself,\nand was so extraordinary that I cannot say I can describe it.\n\nThe next day she was much more free than she was the first night, and\nI had so much conversation as to enter into particulars of things on\nboth sides; also she gave me leave to come and see her house, which,\nhowever, I did not do under a fortnight or thereabouts, because I did\nnot know how far she would dispense with the ceremony which it was\nnecessary to keep up at the beginning of the mourning.\n\nHowever, I came as a man that had business with her, relating to the\nship her husband was dead out of, and the first time I came was\nadmitted; and, in short, the first time I came I made love to her. She\nreceived that proposal with disdain. I cannot indeed say she treated\nme with any disrespect, but she said she abhorred the offer, and would\nhear no more of it. How I came to make such a proposal to her I scarce\nknew then, though it was very much my intention from the first.\n\nIn the meantime I inquired into her circumstances and her character,\nand heard nothing but what was very agreeable of them both; and, above\nall, I found she had the report of the best-humoured lady and the\nbest-bred of all that part of the town; and now I thought I had found\nwhat I had so often wished for to make me happy and had twice\nmiscarried in, and resolved not to miss her, if it was possible to\nobtain her.\n\nIt came indeed a little into my thoughts that I was a married man, and\nhad a second wife alive, who, though she was false to me and a whore,\nyet I was not legally divorced from her, and that she was my wife for\nall that. But I soon got over that part; for, first, as she was a\nwhore, and the marquis had confessed it to me, I was divorced in law,\nand I had a power to put her away. But having had the misfortune of\nfighting a duel, and being obliged to quit the country, I could not\nclaim the legal process which was my right, and therefore might\nconclude myself as much divorced as if it had been actually done, and\nso that scruple vanished.\n\nI suffered now two months to run without pressing my widow any more,\nonly I kept a strict watch to find if any one else pretended to her.\nAt the end of two months I visited her again, when I found she\nreceived me with more freedom, and we had no more sighs and sobs about\nthe last husband; and though she would not let me press my former\nproposal so far as I thought I might have done, yet I found I had\nleave to come again, and it was the article of decency which she stood\nupon as much as anything; that I was not disagreeable to her, and that\nmy using her so handsomely upon the road had given me a great\nadvantage in her favour.\n\nI went on gradually with her, and gave her leave to stand off for two\nmonths more. But then I told her the matter of decency, which was but\na ceremony, was not to stand in competition with the matter of\naffection; and, in short, I could not bear any longer delay, but that,\nif she thought fit, we might marry privately; and, to cut the story\nshort, as I did my courtship, in about five months I got her in the\nmind, and we were privately married, and that with so very exact a\nconcealment that her maid, that was so instrumental in it, yet had no\nknowledge of it for near a month more.\n\nI was now, not only in my imagination, but in reality, the most happy\ncreature in the world, as I was so infinitely satisfied with my wife,\nwho was indeed the best-humoured woman in the world, a most\naccomplished, beautiful creature indeed, perfectly well-bred, and had\nnot one ill quality about her; and this happiness continued without\nthe least interruption for about six years.\n\nBut I, that was to be the most unhappy fellow alive in the article of\nmatrimony, had at last a disappointment of the worst sort even here. I\nhad three fine children by her, and in her time of lying-in with the\nlast she got some cold, that she did not in a long time get off; and,\nin short, she grew very sickly. In being so continually ill and out of\norder, she very unhappily got a habit of drinking cordials and hot\nliquors. Drink, like the devil, when it gets hold of any one, though\nbut a little, it goes on by little and little to their destruction. So\nin my wife, her stomach being weak and faint, she first took this\ncordial, then that, till, in short, she could not live without them,\nand from a drop to a sup, from a sup to a dram, from a dram to a\nglass, and so on to two, till at last she took, in short, to what we\ncall drinking.\n\nAs I likened drink to the devil, in its gradual possession of the\nhabits and person, so it is yet more like the devil in its\nencroachment on us, where it gets hold of our senses. In short, my\nbeautiful, good-humoured, modest, well-bred wife grew a beast, a slave\nto strong liquor, and would be drunk at her own table--nay, in her own\ncloset by herself, till, instead of a well-made, fine shape, she was\nas fat as a hostess; her fine face, bloated and blotched, had not so\nmuch as the ruins of the most beautiful person alive--nothing remained\nbut a good eye; that indeed she held to the last. In short, she lost\nher beauty, her shape, her manners, and at last her virtue; and,\ngiving herself up to drinking, killed herself in about a year and a\nhalf after she first began that cursed trade, in which time she twice\nwas exposed in the most scandalous manner with a captain of a ship,\nwho, like a villain, took the advantage of her being in drink and not\nknowing what she did. But it had this unhappy effect, that instead of\nher being ashamed and repenting of it when she came to herself, it\nhardened her in the crime, and she grew as void of modesty at last as\nof sobriety.\n\nOh, the power of intemperance! and how it encroaches on the best\ndispositions in the world; how it comes upon us gradually and\ninsensibly; and what dismal effects it works upon our morals, changing\nthe most virtuous, regular, well-instructed, and well-inclined tempers\ninto worse than brutal! That was a good story, whether real or\ninvented, of the devil tempting a young man to murder his father. No,\nhe said; that was unnatural. \"Why, then,\" says the devil, \"go and lie\nwith your mother.\" \"No,\" says he; \"that is abominable.\" \"Well, then,\"\nsays the devil, \"if you will do nothing else to oblige me, go and get\ndrunk.\" \"Ay, ay,\" says the fellow, \"I will do that.\" So he went and\nmade himself drunk as a swine, and when he was drunk, he murdered his\nfather and lay with his mother.\n\nNever was a woman more virtuous, modest, chaste, sober; she never so\nmuch as desired to drink any thing strong; it was with the greatest\nentreaty that I could prevail with her to drink a glass or two of\nwine, and rarely, if ever, above one or two at a time; even in company\nshe had no inclination to it. Not an immodest word ever came out of\nher mouth, nor would she suffer it in any one else in her hearing\nwithout resentment and abhorrence. But upon that weakness and illness\nafter her last lying-in, as above, the nurse pressed her, whenever she\nfound herself faint and a sinking of her spirits, to take this cordial\nand that dram, to keep up her spirits, till it became necessary even\nto keep her alive, and gradually increased to a habit, so that it was\nno longer her physic but her food. Her appetite sunk and went quite\naway, and she ate little or nothing, but came at last to such a\ndreadful height that, as I have said, she would be drunk in her own\ndressing-room by eleven o'clock in the morning, and, in short, at last\nwas never sober.\n\nIn this life of hellish excess, as I have said, she lost all that was\nbefore so valuable in her, and a villain, if it be proper to call a\nman who was really a gentleman by such a name, who was an intimate\nacquaintance, coming to pretend a visit to her, made her and her maid\nso drunk together that he lay with them both; with the mistress, the\nmaid being in the room, and with the maid, the mistress being in the\nroom; after which he, it seems, took the like liberty with them both\nas often as he thought fit, till the wench, being with child,\ndiscovered it for herself, and for her mistress too. Let any one judge\nwhat was my case now. I, that for six years thought myself the\nhappiest man alive, was now the most miserable, distracted creature.\nAs to my wife, I loved her so well, and was so sensible of the\ndisaster of her drinking being the occasion of it all, that I could\nnot resent it to such a degree as I had done in her predecessor; but I\npitied her heartily. However, I put away all her servants, and almost\nlocked her up; that is to say, I set new people over her, who would\nnot suffer any one to come near her without my knowledge.\n\nBut what to do with the villain that had thus abused both her and me,\nthat was the question that remained. To fight him upon equal terms, I\nthought, was a little hard; that after a man had treated me as he had\ndone, he deserved no fair play for his life. So I resolved to wait for\nhim in Stepney fields, and which way he often came home pretty late,\nand pistol him in the dark, and, if possible, to let him know what I\nkilled him for before I did it. But when I came to consider of this,\nit shocked my temper too as well as principle, and I could not be a\nmurderer, whatever else I could be, or whatever I was provoked to be.\n\nHowever, I resolved, on the other hand, that I would severely correct\nhim for what he had done, and it was not long before I had an\nopportunity; for, hearing one morning that he was walking across the\nfields from Stepney to Shadwell, which way I knew he often went, I\nwaited for his coming home again, and fairly met him.\n\nI had not many words with him, but told him I had long looked for him;\nthat he knew the villainy he had been guilty of in my family, and he\ncould not believe, since he knew also that I was fully informed of it,\nbut that I must be a great coward, as well as a cuckold, or that I\nwould resent it, and that it was now a very proper time to call him to\nan account for it; and therefore bade him, if he durst show his face\nto what he had done, and defend the name of a captain of a man-of-war,\nas they said he had been, to draw.\n\nHe seemed surprised at the thing, and began to parley, and would\nlessen the crime of it; but I told him it was not a time to talk that\nway, since he could not deny the fact; and to lessen the crime was to\nlay it the more upon the woman, who, I was sure, if he had not first\ndebauched with wine, he could never have brought to the rest; and,\nseeing he refused to draw, I knocked him down with my cane at one\nblow, and I would not strike him again while he lay on the ground, but\nwaited to see him recover a little; for I saw plainly he was not\nkilled. In a few minutes he came to himself again, and then I took him\nfast by one wrist, and caned him as severely as I was able, and as\nlong as I could hold it for want of breath, but forbore his head,\nbecause I was resolved he should feel it. In this condition at last he\nbegged for mercy, but I was deaf to all pity a great while, till he\nroared out like a boy soundly whipped. Then I took his sword from him\nand broke it before his face, and left him on the ground, giving him\ntwo or three kicks on the backside, and bade him go and take the law\nof me if he thought fit.\n\nI had now as much satisfaction as indeed could be taken of a coward,\nand had no more to say to him; but as I knew it would make a great\nnoise about the town, I immediately removed my family, and, that I\nmight be perfectly concealed, went into the north of England, and\nlived in a little town called ----, not far from Lancaster, where I\nlived retired, and was no more heard of for about two years. My wife,\nthough more confined than she used to be, and so kept up from the lewd\npart which, I believe, in the intervals of her intemperance, she was\ntruly ashamed of and abhorred, yet retained the drinking part, which\nbecoming, as I have said, necessary for her subsistence, she soon\nruined her health, and in about a year and a half after my removal\ninto the north she died.\n\nThus I was once more a free man, and, as one would think, should by\nthis time have been fully satisfied that matrimony was not appointed\nto be a state of felicity to me.\n\nI should have mentioned that the villain of a captain who I had\ndrubbed, as above, pretended to make a great stir about my assaulting\nhim on the highway, and that I had fallen upon him with three\nruffians, with an intent to murder him; and this began to obtain\nbelief among the people in the neighbourhood. I sent him word of so\nmuch of it as I had heard, and told him I hoped it did not come from\nhis own mouth; but if it did, I expected he would publicly disown it,\nhe himself declaring he knew it to be false, or else I should be\nforced to act the same thing over again, till I had disciplined him\ninto better manners; and that he might be assured that if he continued\nto pretend that I had anybody with me when I caned him, I would\npublish the whole story in print, and, besides that, would cane him\nagain wherever I met him, and as often as I met him, till he thought\nfit to defend himself with his sword like a gentleman.\n\nHe gave me no answer to this letter; and the satisfaction I had for\nthat was, that I gave twenty or thirty copies of it about among the\nneighbours, which made it as public as if I had printed it (that\nis, as to his acquaintance and mine), and made him so hissed at\nand hated that he was obliged to remove into some other part of the\ntown--whither I did not inquire.\n\nMy wife being now dead, I knew not what course to take in the world,\nand I grew so disconsolate and discouraged that I was next door to\nbeing distempered, and sometimes, indeed, I thought myself a little\ntouched in my head. But it proved nothing but vapours and the vexation\nof this affair, and in about a year's time, or thereabouts, it wore\noff again.\n\nI had rambled up and down in a most discontented, unsettled posture\nafter this, I say, about a year, and then I considered I had three\ninnocent children, and I could take no care of them, and that I must\neither go away and leave them to the wide world or settle here and get\nsomebody to look after them, and that better a mother-in-law than no\nmother; for to live such a wandering life it would not do; so I\nresolved I would marry as anything offered, though it was mean, and\nthe meaner the better. I concluded my next wife should be only taken\nas an upper servant; that is to say, a nurse to my children and\nhousekeeper to myself; \"and let her be whore or honest woman,\" said I,\n\"as she likes best; I am resolved I will not much concern myself about\nthat;\" for I was now one desperate, that valued not how things went.\n\nIn this careless, and indeed rash, foolish humour, I talked to myself\nthus: \"If I marry an honest woman, my children will be taken care of;\nif she be a slut and abuses me, as I see everybody does, I will kidnap\nher and send her to Virginia, to my plantations there, and there she\nshall work hard enough and fare hard enough to keep her chaste, I'll\nwarrant her.\"\n\nI knew well enough at first that these were mad, hare-brained notions,\nand I thought no more of being serious in them than I thought of being\na man in the moon; but I know not how it happened to me, I reasoned\nand talked to myself in this wild manner so long that I brought myself\nto be seriously desperate; that is, to resolve upon another marriage,\nwith all the suppositions of unhappiness that could be imagined to\nfall out.\n\nAnd yet even this rash resolution of my senses did not come\npresently to action; for I was half a year after this before I fixed\nupon anything. At last, as he that seeks mischief shall certainly find\nit, so it was with me. There happened to be a young, or rather a\nmiddle-aged, woman in the next town, which was but a half-mile off,\nwho usually was at my house and among my children every day when the\nweather was tolerable; and though she came but merely as a neighbour,\nand to see us, yet she was always helpful in directing and ordering\nthings for them, and mighty handy about them, as well before my wife\ndied as after.\n\nHer father was one that I employed often to go to Liverpool, and\nsometimes to Whitehaven, and do business for me; for having, as it\nwere, settled myself in the northern parts of England, I had ordered\npart of my effects to be shipped, as occasion of shipping offered, to\neither of those two towns, to which, the war continuing very sharp, it\nwas safer coming, as to privateers, than about through the Channel to\nLondon.\n\nI took a mighty fancy at last that this girl would answer my end,\nparticularly that I saw she was mighty useful among the children; so,\non the other hand, the children loved her very well, and I resolved to\nlove her too, flattering myself mightily, that as I had married two\ngentlewomen and one citizen, and they proved all three whores, I\nshould now find what I wanted in an innocent country wench.\n\nI took up a world of time in considering of this matter; indeed scarce\nany of my matches were done without very mature consideration. The\nsecond was the worst in that article, but in this I thought of it, I\nbelieve, four months most seriously before I resolved, and that very\nprudence spoiled the whole thing. However, at last being resolved, I\ntook Mrs. Margaret one day as she passed by my parlour-door, called\nher in, and told her I wanted to speak with her. She came readily in,\nbut blushed mightily when I bade her sit down in a chair just by me.\n\nI used no great ceremony with her, but told her that I had observed\nshe had been mighty kind to my children, and was very tender to them,\nand that they all loved her, and that, if she and I could agree about\nit, I intended to make her their mother, if she was not engaged to\nsomebody else. The girl sat still and said never a word till I said\nthose words, \"if she was not engaged to somebody else;\" when she\nseemed struck. However, I took no notice of it, other than this, \"Look\nye, Moggy,\" said I (so they call them in the country), \"if you have\npromised yourself, you must tell me.\" For we all knew that a young\nfellow, a good clergyman's wicked son, had hung about her a great\nwhile, two or three years, and made love to her, but could never get\nthe girl in the mind, it seems, to have him.\n\nShe knew I was not ignorant of it, and therefore, after her first\nsurprise was over, she told me Mr. ---- had, as I knew, often come\nafter her, but she had never promised him anything, and had for\nseveral years refused him; her father always telling her that he was a\nwicked fellow, and that he would be her ruin if she had him.\n\n\"Well, Moggy, then,\" says I, \"what dost say to me? Art thou free to\nmake me a wife?\" She blushed and looked down upon the ground, and\nwould not speak a good while; but when I pressed her to tell me, she\nlooked up, and said she supposed I was but jesting with her. Well, I\ngot over that, and told her I was in very good earnest with her, and I\ntook her for a sober, honest, modest girl, and, as I said, one that my\nchildren loved mighty well, and I was in earnest with her; if she\nwould give me her consent, I would give her my word that I would have\nher, and we would be married to-morrow morning. She looked up again at\nthat, and smiled a little, and said no, that was too soon too to say\nyes. She hoped I would give her some time to consider of it, and to\ntalk with her father about it.\n\nI told her she needed not much time to consider about it; but,\nhowever, I would give her till to-morrow morning, which was a great\nwhile. By this time I had kissed Moggy two or three times, and she\nbegan to be freer with me; and when I pressed her to marry me the next\nmorning, she laughed, and told me it was not lucky to be married in\nher old clothes.\n\nI stopped her mouth presently with that, and told her she should not\nbe married in her old clothes, for I would give her some new. \"Ay, it\nmay be afterwards,\" says Moggy, and laughed again. \"No, just now,\"\nsays I. \"Come along with me, Moggy;\" so I carried her upstairs into my\nwife's room that was, and showed her a new morning-gown of my wife's,\nthat she had never worn above two or three times, and several other\nfine things. \"Look you there, Moggy,\" says I, \"there is a wedding-gown\nfor you; give me your hand now that you will have me to-morrow\nmorning. And as to your father, you know he has gone to Liverpool on\nmy business, but I will answer for it he shall not be angry when he\ncomes home to call his master son-in-law; and I ask him no portion.\nTherefore give me thy hand for it, Moggy,\" says I very merrily to her,\nand kissed her again; and the girl gave me her hand, and very\npleasantly too, and I was mightily pleased with it, I assure you.\n\nThere lived about three doors from us an ancient gentleman who passed\nfor a doctor of physic, but who was really a Romish priest in orders,\nas there are many in that part of the country; and in the evening I\nsent to speak with him. He knew that I understood his profession, and\nthat I had lived in popish countries, and, in a word, believed me a\nRoman too, for I was such abroad. When he came to me I told him the\noccasion for which I sent for him, and that it was to be to-morrow\nmorning. He readily told me, if I would come and see him in the\nevening, and bring Moggy with me, he would marry us in his own study,\nand that it was rather more private to do it in the evening than in\nthe morning. So I called Moggy again to me, and told her, since she\nand I had agreed the matter for to-morrow, it was as well to be done\novernight, and told her what the doctor had said.\n\nMoggy blushed again, and said she must go home first, that she could\nnot be ready before to-morrow. \"Look ye, Moggy,\" says I, \"you are my\nwife now, and you shall never go away from me a maid. I know what you\nmean; you would go home to shift you. Come, Moggy,\" says I, \"come\nalong with me again upstairs.\" So I carried her to a chest of linen,\nwhere were several new shifts of my last wife's, which she had never\nworn at all, and some that had been worn.\n\n\"There is a clean smock for you, Moggy,\" says I, \"and to-morrow you\nshall have all the rest.\" When I had done this, \"Now, Moggy,\" says I,\n\"go and dress you;\" so I locked her in, and went downstairs. \"Knock,\"\nsays I, \"when you are dressed.\"\n\nAfter some time Moggy did not knock, but down she came into my room,\ncompletely dressed, for there were several other things that I bade\nher take, and the clothes fitted her as if they had been made for her.\nIt seems she slipped the lock back.\n\n\"Well, Moggy,\" says I, \"now you see you shan't be married in your old\nclothes;\" so I took her in my arms and kissed her; and well pleased I\nwas as ever I was in my life, or with anything I ever did in my life.\nAs soon as it was dark Moggy slipped away beforehand, as the doctor\nand I had agreed, to the old gentleman's housekeeper, and I came in\nabout half-an-hour after; and there we were married in the doctor's\nstudy--that is to say, in his oratory or chapel, a little room within\nhis study--and we stayed and supped with him afterwards.\n\nThen, after a short stay more, I went home first, because I would send\nthe children all to bed, and the other servants out of the way; and\nMoggy came some time after, and so we lay together that night. The\nnext morning I let all the family know that Moggy was my wife, and my\nthree children were rejoiced at it to the last degree. And now I was a\nmarried man a fourth time; and, in short, I was really more happy in\nthis plain country girl than with any of all the wives I had had. She\nwas not young, being about thirty-three, but she brought me a son the\nfirst year. She was very pretty, well-shaped, and of a merry, cheerful\ndisposition, but not a beauty. She was an admirable family manager,\nloved my former children, and used them not at all the worse for\nhaving some of her own. In a word, she made me an excellent wife, but\nlived with me but four years, and died of a hurt she got of a fall\nwhile she was with child, and in her I had a very great loss indeed.\n\nAnd yet such was my fate in wives, that, after all the blushing and\nbackwardness of Mrs. Moggy at first, Mrs. Moggy had, it seems, made a\nslip in her younger days, and was got with child ten years before, by\na gentleman of a great estate in that country, who promised her\nmarriage, and afterwards deserted her. But as that had happened long\nbefore I came into the country, and the child was dead and forgotten,\nthe people were so good to her, and so kind to me, that, hearing I had\nmarried her, nobody ever spoke of it; neither did I ever hear of it or\nsuspect it till after she was in her grave, and then it was of small\nconsequence to me one way or other; and she was a faithful, virtuous,\nobliging wife to me. I had very severe affliction indeed while she\nlived with me; for the smallpox, a frightful distemper in that\ncountry, broke into my family, and carried off three of my children\nand a maid-servant; so that I had only one of my former wife's, and\none by my Moggy, the first a son, the last a daughter.\n\nWhile these things were in agitation came on the invasion of the Scots\nand the fight at Preston; and I have cause to bless the memory of my\nMoggy; for I was all on fire on that side, and just going away with\nhorse and arms to join the Lord Derwentwater. But Moggy begged me off\n(as I may call it), and hung about me so with her tears and\nimportunities that I sat still and looked on; for which I had reason\nto be thankful.\n\nI was really a sorrowful father, and the loss of my children stuck\nclose to me; but the loss of my wife stuck closer to me than all the\nrest. Nor was my grief lessened or my kindest thoughts abated in the\nleast by the account I heard of her former miscarriages, seeing they\nwere so long before I knew her, and were not discovered by me or to me\nin her lifetime.\n\nAll these things put together made me very comfortless. And now I\nthought Heaven summoned me to retire to Virginia, the place, and, as I\nmay say, the only place, I had been blessed at, or had met with\nanything that deserved the name of success in, and where, indeed, my\naffairs being in good hands, the plantations were increased to such a\ndegree that some years my return here made up eight hundred pounds,\nand one year almost a thousand. So I resolved to leave my native\ncountry once more, and taking my son with me, and leaving Moggy's\ndaughter with her grandfather, I made him my principal agent, left him\nconsiderable in his hands for the maintenance of the child, and left\nmy will in his hand, by which, if I died before I should otherwise\nprovide for her, I left her \u00c2\u00a32000 portion, to be paid by my son out of\nthe estate I had in Virginia, and the whole estate, if he died\nunmarried.\n\nI embarked for Virginia in the year ----, at the town of Liverpool,\nand had a tolerable voyage thither, only that we met with a pirate\nship, in the latitude of 48 degrees, who plundered us of every thing\nthey could come at that was for their turn; that is to say,\nprovisions, ammunition, small-arms, and money. But, to give the rogues\ntheir due, though they were the most abandoned wretches that were ever\nseen, they did not use us ill. And as to my loss, it was not\nconsiderable; the cargo which I had on board was in goods, and was of\nno use to them; nor could they come at those things without rummaging\nthe whole ship, which they did not think worth their while.\n\nI found all my affairs in very good order at Virginia, my plantations\nprodigiously increased, and my manager, who first inspired me with\ntravelling thoughts, and made me master of any knowledge worth naming,\nreceived me with a transport of joy, after a ramble of four-and-twenty\nyears.\n\nI ought to remember it, to the encouragement of all faithful servants,\nthat he gave me an account, which, I believe, was critically just, of\nthe whole affairs of the plantations, each by themselves, and balanced\nin years, every year's produce being fully transmitted, charges\ndeducted, to my order at London.\n\nI was exceedingly satisfied, as I had good reason indeed, with his\nmanagement; and with his management, as much in its degree, of his own\nI can safely say it. He had improved a very large plantation of his\nown at the same time, which he began upon the foot of the country's\nallowance of land and the encouragement he had from me.\n\nWhen he had given me all this pleasing, agreeable account, you will\nnot think it strange that I had a desire to see the plantations, and\nto view all the servants, which, in both the works, were upwards of\nthree hundred; and as my tutor generally bought some every fleet that\ncame from England, I had the mortification to see two or three of the\nPreston gentlemen there, who, being prisoners of war, were spared from\nthe public execution, and sent over to that slavery, which to\ngentlemen must be worse than death.\n\nI do not mention what I did or said relating to them here. I shall\nspeak at large of it when the rest of them came over, which more\nnearly concerned me.\n\nBut one circumstance occurred to me here that equally surprised me and\nterrified me to the last degree. Looking over all the servants, as I\nsay above, and viewing the plantations narrowly and frequently, I came\none day by a place where some women were at work by themselves. I was\nseriously reflecting on the misery of human life, when I saw some of\nthose poor wretches. Thought I, \"They have perhaps lived gay and\npleasantly in the world, notwithstanding, through a variety of\ndistresses, they may have been brought to this; and if a body was to\nhear the history of some of them now, it would perhaps be as moving\nand as seasonable a sermon as any minister in the country could\npreach.\"\n\nWhile I was musing thus and looking at the women, on a sudden I heard\na combustion among other of the women-servants, who were almost behind\nme, in the same work, and help was called loudly for, one of the women\nhaving swooned away. They said she would die immediately if something\nwas not done to relieve her. I had nothing about me but a little\nbottle, which we always carried about us there with rum, to give any\nservant a dram that merited that favour; so I turned my horse and went\nup towards the place. But as the poor creature was lying flat on the\nground, and the rest of the women-servants about her, I did not see\nher, but gave them the bottle, and they rubbed her temples with it,\nand, with much ado, brought her to life, and gave her a little to\ndrink. But she could drink none of it, and was exceeding ill\nafterwards, so that she was carried to the infirmary--so they call it\nin the religious houses in Italy where the sick nuns and friars are\ncarried; but here, in Virginia, I think they should call it the\ncondemned hole, for it really was only a place just fit for people to\ndie in, not a place to be cured in.\n\nThe sick woman refusing to drink, one of the women-servants brought me\nthe bottle again, and I bade them drink it among them, which had\nalmost set them together by the ears for the liquor, there being not\nenough to give every one a sup.\n\nI went home to my house immediately, and reflecting on the miserable\nprovision was wont to be made for poor servants when they were sick, I\ninquired of my manager if it was so still. He said he believed mine\nwas better than any in the country; but he confessed it was but sad\nlodging. However, he said he would go and look after it immediately\nand see how it was.\n\nHe came to me again about an hour after, and told me the woman was\nvery ill, and frighted with her condition; that she seemed to be very\npenitent for some things in her past life, which lay heavy upon her\nmind, believing she should die; that she asked him if there was no\nminister to comfort poor dying servants; and he told her that she knew\nthey had no minister nearer than such a place, but that, if she lived\ntill morning, he should be sent for. He told me, also, that he had\nremoved her into a room where their chief workman used to lodge; that\nhe had given her a pair of sheets, and everything he could that he\nthought she wanted, and had appointed another woman-servant to tend\nher and sit up with her.\n\n\"Well,\" says I, \"that's well; for I cannot bear to have poor creatures\nlie and perish, by the mere hardship of the place they are in, when\nthey are sick and want help. Besides,\" said I, \"some of those\nunfortunate creatures they call convicts may be peopie that have been\ntenderly brought up.\" \"Really, sir,\" says he, \"this poor creature, I\nalways said, had something of a gentlewoman in her. I could see it by\nher behaviour, and I have heard the other women say that she lived\nvery great once, and that she had fifteen hundred pound to her\nportion; and I dare say she has been a handsome woman in her time, and\nshe has a hand as fine as a lady's now, though it be tanned with the\nweather. I dare say she was never brought up to labour as she does\nhere, and she says to the rest that it will kill her.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" says I, \"it may be so, and that may be the reason that she\nfaints under it;\" and I added, \"Is there nothing you can put her to\nwithin doors that may not be so laborious and expose her to so much\nheat and cold?\" He told me yes, there was. He could set her to be the\nhousekeeper, for the woman that lately was such was out of her time,\nand was married and turned planter. \"Why, then, let her have it,\" said\nI, \"if she recovers; and in the meantime go,\" said I, \"and tell her\nso; perhaps the comfort of it may help to restore her.\"\n\nHe did so, and with that, taking good care of her, and giving her good\nwarm diet, the woman recovered, and in a little time was abroad again;\nfor it was the mere weight of labour, and being exposed to hard\nlodging and mean diet, to one so tenderly bred, that struck her and\nshe fainted at her work.\n\nWhen she was made housekeeper she was quite another body. She put all\nthe household into such excellent order, and managed their provisions\nso well, that my tutor admired her conduct, and would be every now and\nthen speaking of her to me, that she was an excellent manager. \"I'll\nwarrant,\" says he, \"she has been bred a gentlewoman, and she has been\na fine woman in her time too.\" In a word, he said so many good things\nof her that I had a mind to see her. So one day I took occasion to go\nto the plantation-house, as they called it, and into a parlour always\nreserved for the master of the plantation. There she had opportunity\nto see me before I could see her, and as soon as she had seen me she\nknew me; but indeed had I seen her an hundred times I should not have\nknown her. She was, it seems, in the greatest confusion and surprise\nat seeing who I was that it was possible for any one to be; and when I\nordered my manager to bring her into the room, he found her crying,\nand begged him to excuse her, that she was frighted, and should die\naway if she came near me.\n\nI, not imagining anything but that the poor creature was afraid of me\n(for masters in Virginia are terrible things), bade him tell her she\nneed to be under no concern at my calling for her; for it was not for\nany hurt nor for any displeasure, but that I had some orders to give\nher. So, having, as he thought, encouraged her, though her surprise\nwas of another kind, he brought her in. When she came in she held a\nhandkerchief in her hand, wiping her eyes, as if she had cried. \"Mrs.\nHousekeeper,\" said I, speaking cheerfully to her, \"don't be concerned\nat my sending for you; I have had a very good account of your\nmanagement, and I called for you to let you know I am very well\npleased with it; and if it falls in my way to do you any good, if your\ncircumstances will allow it, I may be willing enough to help you out\nof your misery.\"\n\nShe made low courtesies, but said nothing. However, she was so far\nencouraged that she took her hand from her face, and I saw her face\nfully; and I believe she did it desiring I should discover who she\nwas; but I really knew nothing of her, any more than if I had never\nseen her in my life, but went on, as I thought, to encourage her, as I\nused to do with any that I saw deserved it.\n\nIn the meantime my tutor, who was in the room, went out on some\nbusiness or other--I know not what. As soon as he was gone she burst\nout into a passion, and fell down on her knees just before me: \"Oh,\nsir!\" says she, \"I see you don't know me. Be merciful to me; I am your\nmiserable divorced wife!\"\n\nI was astonished; I was frighted; I trembled like one in an ague; I\nwas speechless; in a word, I was ready to sink, and she fell flat on\nher face, and lay there as if she had been dead. I was speechless, I\nsay, as a stone. I had only presence of mind enough to step to the\ndoor and fasten it, that my tutor might not come in; then, going back\nto her, I took her up and spoke comfortably to her, and told her I no\nmore knew her than if I had never seen her.\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" said she, \"afflictions are dreadful things; such as I have\nsuffered have been enough to alter my countenance; but forgive,\" said\nshe, \"for God's sake, the injuries I have done you. I have paid dear\nfor all my wickedness, and it is just, it is righteous, that God\nshould bring me to your foot, to ask your pardon for all my brutish\ndoings. Forgive me, sir,\" said she, \"I beseech you, and let me be your\nslave or servant for it as long as I live; it is all I ask;\" and with\nthose words she fell upon her knees again and cried so vehemently that\nit was impossible for her to stop it or to speak a word more. I took\nher up again, made her sit down, desired her to compose herself, and\nto hear what I was going to say; though indeed it touched me so\nsensibly that I was hardly able to speak any more than she was.\n\nFirst, I told her it was such a surprise to me that I was not able to\nsay much to her; and indeed the tears run down my face almost as fast\nas they did on hers. I told her that I should only tell her now, that,\nas nobody had yet known anything that had passed, so it was absolutely\nnecessary not a word of it should be known; that it should not be the\nworse for her that she was thus thrown in my hands again; but that I\ncould do nothing for her if it was known, and, therefore, that her\nfuture good or ill fortune would depend upon her entire concealing it;\nthat, as my manager would come in again presently, she should go back\nto her part of the house, and go on in the business as she did before;\nthat I would come to her and talk more at large with her in a day or\ntwo. So she retired, after assuring me that not a word of it should go\nout of her mouth; and indeed she was willing to retire before my tutor\ncame again, that he might not see the agony she was in.\n\nI was so perplexed about this surprising incident that I hardly knew\nwhat I did or said all that night; nor was I come to any settled\nresolution in the morning what course to take in it. However, in the\nmorning I called my tutor, and told him that I had been exceedingly\nconcerned about the poor distressed creature, the housekeeper; that I\nhad heard some of her story, which was very dismal; that she had been\nin very good circumstances and was bred very well, and that I was glad\nhe had removed her out of the field into the house; but still she was\nalmost naked, and that I would have him go down to the warehouse and\ngive her some linen, especially head-clothes, and all sorts of small\nthings such as hoods, gloves, stockings, shoes, petticoats, &c., and\nto let her choose for herself; also a morning-gown of calico, and a\nmantua of a better kind of calico; that is to say, new clothe her;\nwhich he did, but brought me word that he found her all in tears, and\nthat she had cried all night long, and, in short, he believed she\nwould indeed cry herself to death; that all the while she was\nreceiving the things he gave her she cried; that now and then she\nwould struggle with and stop it, but that then, upon another word\nspeaking, she would burst out again, so that it grieved everybody that\nsaw her.\n\nI was really affected with her case very much, but struggled hard with\nmyself to hide it, and turned the discourse to something else. In the\nmeantime, though I did not go to her the next day, nor till the third\nday, yet I studied day and night how to act, and what I should do in\nthis remarkable case.\n\nWhen I came to the house, which was the third day, she came into the\nroom I was in, clothed all over with my things which I had ordered\nher, and told me she thanked God she was now my servant again and wore\nmy livery, thanked me for the clothes I had sent her, and said it was\nmuch more than she had deserved from me.\n\nI then entered into discourses with her, nobody being present but\nourselves; and first I told her she should name no more of the unkind\nthings that had passed, for she had humbled herself more than enough\non that subject, and I would never reproach her with anything that was\npast. I found that she had been the deepest sufferer by far. I told\nher it was impossible for me, in my present circumstances, to receive\nher there as a wife who came over as a convict, neither did she know\nso little as to desire it; but I told her I might be instrumental to\nput an end to her misfortunes in the world, and especially to the\nmiserable part of it which was her present load, provided she could\neffectually keep her own counsel and never let the particulars come\nout of her mouth, and that from the day she did she might date her\nirrevocable ruin.\n\nShe was as sensible of the necessity of that part as I was, and told\nme all she could claim of me would be only to deliver her from her\npresent calamity that she was not able to support; and that then, if I\npleased, she might live such a life as that she might apply the\nresidue of what time she should have wholly to repentance; that she\nwas willing to do the meanest offices in the world for me; and though\nshe should rejoice to hear that I would forgive her former life, yet\nthat she would not look any higher than to be my servant as long as\nshe lived; and, in the meantime, I might be satisfied she would never\nlet any creature so much as know that I had ever seen her before.\n\nI asked her if she was willing to let me into any part of the history\nof her life since she and I parted; but I did not insist upon it\notherwise than as she thought convenient. She said, as her breach with\nme began first in folly and ended in sin, so her whole life afterwards\nwas a continued series of calamity, sin and sorrow, sin and shame, and\nat last misery; that she was deluded into gay company and to an\nexpensive way of living which betrayed her to several wicked courses\nto support the expenses of it; that after a thousand distresses and\ndifficulties, being not able to maintain herself, she was reduced to\nextreme poverty; that she would many times have humbled herself to me\nin the lowest and most submissive manner in the world, being sincerely\npenitent for her first crime, but that she could never hear of me, nor\nwhich way I was gone; that she was by that means so abandoned that she\nwanted bread, and those wants and distresses brought her into bad\ncompany of another kind, and that she fell in among a gang of thieves,\nwith whom she herded for some time, and got money enough a great\nwhile, but under the greatest dread and terror imaginable, being in\nthe constant fear of coming to shame; that afterwards what she feared\nwas come upon her, and for a very trifling attempt in which she was\nnot principal, but accidentally concerned, she was sent to this place.\nShe told me her life was such a collection of various fortunes--up and\ndown, in plenty and in misery, in prison and at liberty, at ease and\nin torment--that it would take up a great many days to give me a\nhistory of it; that I was come to see the end of it, as I had seen the\nbest part of the beginning; that I knew she was brought up tenderly\nand fared delicately; but that now she was, with the prodigal, brought\nto desire husks with swine, and even to want that supply. Her tears\nflowed so strongly upon this discourse that they frequently\ninterrupted her, so that she could not go on without difficulty, and\nat last could not go on at all. So I told her I would excuse her\ntelling any more of her story at that time; that I saw it was but a\nrenewing of her grief, and that I would rather contribute to her\nforgetting what was past, and desired her to say no more of it; so I\nbroke off that part.\n\nIn the meantime I told her, since Providence had thus cast her upon my\nhands again, I would take care that she should not want, and that she\nshould not live hardly neither, though I could go no further at\npresent; and thus we parted for that time, and she continued in the\nbusiness of housekeeper; only that, to ease her, I gave her an\nassistant; and, though I would not have it called so, it was neither\nmore or less than a servant to wait on her and do everything for her;\nand told her, too, that it was so.\n\nAfter she had been some time in this place she recovered her spirits\nand grew cheerful; her fallen flesh plumped up, and the sunk and\nhollow parts filled again, so that she began to recover something of\nthat brightness and charming countenance which was once so very\nagreeable to me; and sometimes I could not help having warm desires\ntowards her, and of taking her into her first station again; but there\nwere many difficulties occurred which I could not get over a great\nwhile.\n\nBut in the meantime another odd accident happened which put me to a\nvery great difficulty, and more than I could have thought such a thing\ncould be capable of. My tutor, a man of wit and learning, and full of\ngenerous principles, who was at first moved with compassion for the\nmisery of this gentlewoman, and, even then, thought there were some\nthings more than common in her, as I have hinted; now when, as I say,\nshe was recovered, and her sprightly temper restored and comforted, he\nwas charmed so with her conversation that, in short, he fell in love\nwith her.\n\nI hinted in my former account of her that she had a charming tongue,\nwas mistress of abundance of wit, that she sung incomparably fine, and\nwas perfectly well-bred. These all remained witli her still, and made\nher a very agreeable person; and, in short, he came to me one evening\nand told me that he came to ask my leave to let him marry the\nhousekeeper.\n\nI was exceedingly perplexed at this proposal, but, however, I gave him\nno room to perceive that. I told him I hoped he had considered well of\nit before he brought it so far as to offer it to me, and supposed that\nhe had agreed that point so that I had no consent to give, but as she\nhad almost four years of her time to serve.\n\nHe answered no; he paid such a regard to me that he would not so much\nas take one step in such a thing without my knowledge, and assured me\nhe had not so much as mentioned it to her. I knew not what answer\nindeed to make to him, but at last I resolved to put it off from\nmyself to her, because then I should have opportunity to talk with her\nbeforehand. So I told him he was perfectly free to act in the matter\nas he thought fit; that I could not say either one thing or another to\nit, neither had I any right to meddle in it. As to her serving out her\ntime with me, that was a trifle, and not worth naming, but I hoped he\nwould consider well every circumstance before he entered upon such an\naffair as that.\n\nHe told me he had fully considered it already, and that he was\nresolved, seeing I was not against it, to have her whatever came of\nit, for he believed he should be the happiest man alive with her. Then\nhe ran on in his character of her, how clever a woman she was in the\nmanagement of all manner of business, how admirable conversation she\nwas, what a wit, what a memory, what a vast share of knowledge, and\nthe like; all which I knew to be the truth, and yet short of her just\ncharacter too; for, as she was all that formerly when she was mine,\nshe was vastly improved in the school of affliction, and was all the\nbright part, with a vast addition of temper, prudence, judgment, and\nall that she formerly wanted.\n\nI had not much patience, as you may well imagine, till I saw my honest\nhousekeeper, to communicate this secret to her, and to see what course\nshe would steer on so nice an occasion. But I was suddenly taken so\nill with a cold which held for two days that I could not stir out of\ndoors; and in this time the matter was all done and over; for my tutor\nhad gone the same night and made his attack; but was coldly received\nat first, which very much surprised him, for he made no doubt to have\nher consent at first word. However, the next day he came again, and\nagain the third day, when, finding he was in earnest, and yet that she\ncould not think of anything of that kind, she told him, in few words,\nthat she thought herself greatly obliged to him for such a testimony\nof his respect to her, and should have embraced it willingly, as\nanybody would suppose one in her circumstances should do, but that she\nwould not abuse him so much, for that she must acknowledge to him she\nwas under obligations that prevented her; that was, in short, that she\nwas a married woman and had a husband alive.\n\nThis was so sincere but so effectual an answer that he could have no\nroom to reply one word to it, but that he was very sorry, and that it\nwas a very great affliction to him, and as great a disappointment as\never he met with.\n\nThe next day after he had received this repulse I came to the\nplantation-house, and, sending for the housekeeper, I began with her,\nand told her that I understood she would have a very advantageous\nproposal made to her, and that I would have her consider well of it,\nand then told her what my tutor had said to me.\n\nShe immediately fell a-crying, at which I seemed to wonder very much.\n\"Oh, sir!\" says she, \"how can you name such a thing to me?\" I told her\nthat I could name it the better to her because I had been married\nmyself since I parted from her. \"Yes, sir,\" says she; \"but the case\nalters; the crime being on my side, I ought not to marry; but,\" says\nshe, \"that is not the reason at all, but I cannot do it.\" I pretended\nto press her to it, though not sincerely, I must acknowledge, for my\nheart had turned toward her for some time, and I had fully forgiven\nher in my mind all her former conduct; but, I say, I seemed to press\nher to it, at which she burst out in a passion. \"No, no,\" says she;\n\"let me be your slave rather than the best man's wife in the world.\" I\nreasoned with her upon her circumstances, and how such a marriage\nwould restore her to a state of ease and plenty, and none in the world\nmight ever know or suspect who or what she had been. But she could not\nbear it; but, with tears, again raising her voice that I was afraid\nshe would be heard, \"I beseech you,\" says she, \"do not speak of it any\nmore. I was once yours, and I will never belong to any man else in the\nworld. Let me be as I am, or anything else you please to make me, but\nnot a wife to any man alive but yourself.\"\n\nI was so moved with the passion she was in at speaking this that I\nknew not what I said or did for some time. At length I said to her,\n\"It is a great pity you had not long ago been as sincere as you are\nnow; it had been better for us both. However, as it is, you shall not\nbe forced to anything against your mind, nor shall you be the worse\ntreated for refusing; but how will you put him off? No doubt he\nexpects you will receive his proposal as an advantage; and as he sees\nno farther into your circumstances, so it is.\" \"Oh, sir!\" says she, \"I\nhave done all that already. He has his answer, and is fully satisfied.\nHe will never trouble you any more on that head;\" and then she told me\nwhat answer she had given him.\n\nFrom that minute I resolved that I would certainly take her again to\nbe my wife as before. I thought she had fully made me amends for her\nformer ill conduct, and she deserved to be forgiven (and so indeed she\ndid, if ever woman did, considering also what dreadful penance she had\nundergone, and how long she had lived in misery and distress); and\nthat Providence had, as it were, cast her upon me again, and, above\nall, had given her such an affection to me and so resolved a mind that\nshe could refuse so handsome an offer of deliverance rather than be\nfarther separated from me.\n\nAs I resolved this in my mind, so I thought it was cruel to conceal it\nany longer from her. Nor, in deed, could I contain myself any longer,\nbut I took her in my arms: \"Well,\" says I, \"you have given me such a\ntestimony of affection in this that I can no longer withstand. I\nforgive you all that ever was between us on this account, and, since\nyou will be nobody's but mine, you shall be mine again as you were at\nfirst.\"\n\nBut this was too much for her the other way, and now she was so far\novercome with my yielding to her that, had she not got vent to her\npassion by the most vehement crying, she must have died in my arms;\nand I was forced to let her go and set her down in a chair, where she\ncried for a quarter of an hour before she could speak a word.\n\nWhen she was come to herself enough to talk again, I told her we must\nconsider of a method how to bring this to pass, and that it must not\nbe done by publishing there that she was my wife before, for that\nwould expose us both, but that I would openly marry her again. This\nshe agreed was very rational, and accordingly, about two months after,\nwe were married again, and no man in the world ever enjoyed a better\nwife or lived more happy than we both did for several years after.\n\nAnd now I began to think my fortunes were settled for this world, and\nI had nothing before me but to finish a life of infinite variety, such\nas mine had been, with a comfortable retreat, being both made wiser by\nour sufferings and difficulties, and able to judge for ourselves what\nkind of life would be best adapted to our present circumstances, and\nin what station we might look upon ourselves to be most completely\nhappy.\n\nBut man is a short-sighted creature at best, and in nothing more than\nin that of fixing his own felicity, or, as we may say, choosing for\nhimself. One would have thought, and so my wife often suggested to me,\nthat the state of life that I was now in was as perfectly calculated\nto make a man completely happy as any private station in the world\ncould be. We had an estate more than sufficient, and daily increasing,\nfor the supporting any state or figure that in that place we could\npropose to ourselves or even desire to live in; we had everything that\nwas pleasant and agreeable, without the least mortification in any\ncircumstances of it; every sweet thing, and nothing to embitter it;\nevery good, and no mixture of evil with it; nor any gap open where we\ncould have the least apprehensions of any evil breaking out upon us.\nNor indeed was it easy for either of us, in our phlegmatic, melancholy\nnotions, to have the least imagination how anything disastrous could\nhappen to us in the common course of things, unless something should\nbefall us out of the ordinary way of Providence, or of its acting in\nthe world.\n\nBut, an unseen mine blew up all this apparent tranquillity at once;\nand though it did not remove my affairs there from me, yet it\neffectually removed me from them and sent me a-wandering into the\nworld again--a condition full of hazards, and always attended with\ncircumstances dangerous to mankind, while he is left to choose his own\nfortunes and be guided by his own short-sighted measures.\n\nI must now return to a circumstance of my history which had been past\nfor some time, and which relates to my conduct while I was last in\nEngland.\n\nI mentioned how my faithful wife Moggy, with her tears and her\nentreaties, had prevailed with me not to play the madman and openly\njoin in the rebellion with the late Lord Derwentwater and his party\nwhen they entered Lancashire, and thereby, as I may say, saved my\nlife. But my curiosity prevailed so much at last that I gave her the\nslip when they came to Preston, and at least thought I would go and\nlook at them, and see what they were likely to come to.\n\nMy former wife's importunities, as above, had indeed prevailed upon me\nfrom publicly embarking in that enterprise and joining openly with\nthem in arms; and by this, as I have observed, she saved my life to be\nsure, because I had then publicly espoused the rebellion, and had been\nknown to have been among them, which might have been as fatal to me\nafterwards, though I had not been taken in the action, as if I had.\n\nBut when they advanced and came nearer to us to Preston, and there\nappeared a greater spirit among the people in their favour, my old\ndoctor, whom I mentioned before, who was a Romish priest, and had\nmarried us, inspired me with new zeal, and gave me no rest till he\nobliged me, with only a good horse and arms, to join them the day\nbefore they entered Preston, he himself venturing in the same posture\nwith me.\n\nI was not so public here as to be very well known, at least by any one\nthat had knowledge of me in the country where I lived; and this was\nindeed my safety afterwards, as you will soon hear. But yet I was\nknown too among the men, especially among the Scots, with some of whom\nI had been acquainted in foreign service. With these I was\nparticularly conversant, and, passing for a French officer, I talked\nto them of making a select detachment to defend the pass between\nPreston and the river and bridge, upon maintaining which, as I\ninsisted, depended the safety of the whole party.\n\nIt was with some warmth that I spoke of that affair, and as I passed\namong them, I say, for a French officer and a man of experience, it\ncaused several debates among them. But the hint was not followed, as\nis well known, and from that moment I gave them all up as lost, and\nmeditated nothing but how to escape from them, which I effected the\nnight before they were surrounded by the royal cavalry. I did not do\nthis without great difficulty, swimming the river Ribble at a place\nwhere, though I got well over, yet I could not for a long while get to\na place where my horse could land himself--that is to say, where the\nground was firm enough for him to take the land. However, at length I\ngot on shore, and riding very hard, came the next evening in sight of\nmy own dwelling. Here, after lying by in a wood till the depth of\nnight, I shot my horse in a little kind of a gravel pit, or marl pit,\nwhere I soon covered him with earth for the present, and marching all\nalone, I came about two in the morning to my house, where my wife,\nsurprised with joy and yet terribly frighted, let me in; and then I\ntook immediate measures to secure myself upon whatever incident might\nhappen, but which, as things were ordered, I had no need to make use\nof, for the rebels being entirely defeated, and either all killed or\ntaken prisoners, I was not known by anybody in the country to have\nbeen among them; no, nor so much as suspected. And thus I made a\nnarrow escape from the most dangerous action, and most foolishly\nembarked in, of any that I had ever been engaged in before.\n\nIt was very lucky to me that I killed and buried my horse, for he\nwould have been taken two days after, and would, to be sure, have been\nknown by those who had seen me upon him at Preston. But now, as none\nknew I had been abroad, nor any such circumstance could discover me, I\nkept close, and as my excursion had been short and I had not been\nmissed by any of my neighbours, if anybody came to speak with me,\nbehold I was at home.\n\nHowever, I was not thoroughly easy in my mind, and secretly wished I\nwas in my own dominions in Virginia, to which, in a little time, other\ncircumstances occurring, I made preparations to remove with my whole\nfamily.\n\nIn the meantime, as above, the action at Preston happened, and the\nmiserable people surrendered to the king's troops. Some were executed\nfor examples, as in such cases is usual, and the government extending\nmercy to the multitude, they were kept in Chester Castle, and other\nplaces a considerable time, till they were disposed of, some one way,\nsome another, as we shall hear.\n\nSeveral hundreds of them after this were, at their own request,\ntransported, as it is vulgarly expressed, to the plantations--that is\nto say, sent to Virginia and other British colonies to be sold after\nthe usual manner of condemned criminals, or, as we call them there,\nconvicts, to serve a limited time in the country, and then be made\nfreemen again. Some of these I have spoken of above; but now, to my no\nlittle uneasiness, I found, after I had been there some time, two\nships arrived with more of these people in the same river where all my\nplantations lay.\n\nI no sooner heard of it but the first step I took was to resolve to\nlet none of them be bought into my work or to any of my plantations;\nand this I did, pretending that I would not make slaves every day of\nunfortunate gentlemen who fell into that condition for their zeal to\ntheir party only, and the like. But the true reason was, that I\nexpected several of them would know me, and might perhaps betray me,\nand make it public that I was one of the same sort, but had made my\nescape; and so I might be brought into trouble, and, if I came off\nwith my life, might have all my effects seized on, and be reduced to\nmisery and poverty again at once, all which I thought I had done\nenough to deserve.\n\nThis was a just caution, but, as I found quickly, was not a sufficient\none, as my circumstances stood, for my safety; for though I bought\nnone of these poor men myself, yet several of my neighbours did, and\nthere was scarce a plantation near me but had some of them, more or\nless, among them; so that, in a word, I could not peep abroad hardly\nbut I was in danger to be seen, and known too, by some or other of\nthem.\n\nI may be allowed to say that this was a very uneasy life to me, and\nsuch that, in short, I found myself utterly unable to bear; for I was\nnow reduced from a great man, a magistrate, a governor or master of\nthree great plantations, and having three or four hundred servants at\nmy command, to be a poor self-condemned rebel, and durst not show my\nface; and that I might with the same safety, or rather more, have\nskulked about in Lancashire where I was, or gone up to London and\nconcealed myself there till things had been over. But now the danger\nwas come home to me, even to my door, and I expected nothing but to be\ninformed against every day, be taken up, and sent to England in irons,\nand have all my plantations seized on as a forfeited estate to the\nCrown.\n\nI had but one hope of safety to trust to, and that was, that having\nbeen so little a while among them, done nothing for them, and passing\nfor a stranger, they never knew my name, but only I was called the\nFrench colonel, or the French officer, or the French gentleman by\nmost, if not by all, the people here. And as for the doctor that went\nwith me, he had found means to escape too, though not the same way\nthat I did, finding the cause not likely to be supported, and that the\nking's troops were gathering on all sides round them like a cloud.\n\nBut to return to myself; this was no satisfaction to me, and what to\ndo I really knew not, for I was more at a loss how to shift in such a\ndistressed case as this, now it lay so close to me, than ever I was in\nany difficulty in my life. The first thing I did was to come home and\nmake a confidence of the whole affair to my wife; and though I did it\ngenerously without conditions, yet I did not do it without first\ntelling her how I was now going to put my life into her hands, that\nshe might have it in her power to pay me home for all that she might\nthink had been hard in my former usage of her; and that, in short, it\nwould be in her power to deliver me up into the hands of my enemies,\nbut that I would trust her generosity, as well as her renewed\naffection, and put all upon her fidelity, and without any more\nprecaution I opened the whole thing to her, and particularly the\ndanger I was now in.\n\nA faithful counsellor is life from the dead, gives courage where the\nheart is sinking, and raises the mind to a proper use of means; and\nsuch she was to me indeed upon every step of this affair, and it was\nby her direction that I took every step that followed for the\nextricating myself out of this labyrinth.\n\n\"Come, come, my dear,\" says she, \"if this be all, there is no room for\nany such disconsolate doings as your fears run you upon;\" for I was\nimmediately for selling off my plantations and all my stock and\nembarking myself forthwith, and to get to Madeira or to any place out\nof the king's dominions.\n\nBut my wife was quite of another opinion, and encouraging me on\nanother account, proposed two things, either my freighting a sloop\nwith provisions to the West Indies, and so taking passage from thence\nto London, or letting her go away directly for England and endeavour\nto obtain the king's pardon, whatever it might cost.\n\nI inclined to the last proposal; for though I was unhappily prejudiced\nin favour of a wrong interest, yet I had always a secret and right\nnotion of the clemency and merciful disposition of his Majesty, and,\nhad I been in England, should, I believe, have been easily persuaded\nto have thrown myself at his foot.\n\nBut going to England as I was circumstanced must have been a public\naction, and I must have made all the usual preparations for it, must\nhave appeared in public, have stayed till the crop was ready, and gone\naway in form and state as usual, or have acted as if something\nextraordinary was the matter, and have filled the heads of the people\nthere with innumerable suggestions of they knew not what.\n\nBut my wife made all this easy to me from her own invention; for,\nwithout acquainting me of any thing, she comes merrily to me one\nmorning before I was up: \"My dear,\" says she, \"I am very sorry to hear\nthat you are not very well this morning. I have ordered Pennico\" (that\nwas a young negro girl which I had given her) \"to make you a fire in\nyour chamber, and pray lie still where you are a while till it is\ndone.\" At the same instant the little negro came in with wood and a\npair of bellows, &c., to kindle the fire, and my wife, not giving me\ntime to reply, whispers close to my ear to lie still and say nothing\ntill she came up again to me.\n\nI was thoroughly frighted, that you may be sure of, and thought of\nnothing but of being discovered, betrayed, and carried to England,\nhanged, quartered, and all that was terrible, and my very heart sunk\nwithin me. She perceived my disorder and turned back, assuring me\nthere was no harm, desired me to be easy, and she would come back\nagain presently and give me satisfaction in every particular that I\ncould desire. So I composed myself a while as well as I could, but it\nwas but a little while that I could bear it, and I sent Pennico\ndownstairs to find out her mistress, and tell her I was very ill and\nmust speak with her immediately; and the girl was scarce out of the\nroom before I jumped out of bed and began to dress me, that I might be\nready for all events.\n\nMy wife was as good as her word, and was coming up as the girl was\ncoming down. \"I see,\" says she, \"you want patience, but pray do not\nwant government of yourself, but take that screen before your face,\nand go to the window and see if you know any of those Scotchmen that\nare in the yard, for there are seven or eight of them come about some\nbusiness to your clerk.\"\n\nI went and looked through the screen, and saw the faces of them all\ndistinctly, but could make nothing of them other than that they were\nScotchmen, which was easy to discern. However, it was no satisfaction\nto me that I knew not their faces, for they might know mine for all\nthat, according to the old English proverb, \"That more knows Tom Fool\nthan Tom Fool knows;\" so I kept close in my chamber till I understood\nthey were all gone.\n\nAfter this my wife caused it to be given out in the house that I was\nnot well; and when this not being well had lasted three or four days,\nI had my leg wrapped up in a great piece of flannel and laid upon a\nstool, and there I was lame of the gout; and this served for about six\nweeks, when my wife told me she had given it out that my gout was\nrather rheumatic than a settled gout, and that I was resolved to take\none of my own sloops and go away to Nevis or Antigua, and use the hot\nbaths there for my cure.\n\nAll this was very well, and I approved my wife's contrivance as\nadmirably good, both to keep me within doors eight or ten weeks at\nfirst, and to convey me away afterwards without any extraordinary\nbustle to be made about it; but still I did not know what it all\ntended to, and what the design of it all was. But my wife desired me\nto leave that to her; so I readily did, and she carried it all on with\na prudence not to be disputed; and after she had wrapped my legs in\nflannel almost three months, she came and told me the sloop was ready\nand all the goods put on board. \"And now, my dear,\" says she, \"I come\nto tell you all the rest of my design; for,\" added she, \"I hope you\nwill not think I am going to kidnap you, and transport you from\nVirginia, as other people are transported to it, or that I am going to\nget you sent away and leave myself in possession of your estate; but\nyou shall find me the same faithful, humble creature which I should\nhave been if I had been still your slave, and not had any hopes of\nbeing your wife, and that in all my scheme which I have laid for your\nsafety, in this new exigence, I have not proposed your going one step\nbut where I shall go and be always with you, to assist and serve you\non all occasions, and to take my portion with you, of what kind soever\nour lot may be.\"\n\nThis was so generous, and so handsome a declaration of her fidelity,\nand so great a token, too, of the goodness of her judgment in\nconsidering of the things which were before her, and of what my\npresent circumstances called for, that, from that time forward, I gave\nmyself cheerfully up to her management without any hesitation in the\nleast, and after about ten days' preparation we embarked in a large\nsloop of my own of about sixty tons.\n\nI should have mentioned here that I had still my faithful tutor, as I\ncalled him, at the head of my affairs; and, as he knew who to\ncorrespond with, and how to manage the correspondence in England, we\nleft all that part to him, as I had done before; and I did this with a\nfull satisfaction in his ability as well as in his integrity. It is\ntrue he had been a little chagrined in that affair of my wife, who, as\nI hinted before, had married me, after telling him, in answer to his\nsolicitations, that she had a husband alive. Now, though this was\nliterally true, yet, as it was a secret not fit to be opened to him, I\nwas obliged to put him off with other reasons, as well as I could,\nperhaps not much to the purpose, and perhaps not much to his\nsatisfaction, so that I reckoned he looked on himself as not very\nkindly used several ways. But he began to get over it, and to be easy,\nespecially at our going away, when he found that the trust of\neverything was still left in his hands as it was before.\n\nWhen my wife had thus communicated everything of the voyage to me, and\nwe began to be ready to go off, she came to me one morning, and, with\nher usual cheerfulness, told me she now came to tell me the rest of\nher measures for the completing my deliverance; and this was, that\nwhile we made this trip, as she called it, to the hot springs at\nNevis, she would write to a particular friend at London, whom she\ncould depend upon, to try to get a pardon for a person on account of\nthe late rebellion, with all the circumstances which my case was\nattended with, viz., of having acted nothing among them but being\nthree days in the place; and, while we were thus absent, she did not\nquestion but to have an answer, which she would direct to come so many\nways that we would be sure to have the first of it as soon as it was\npossible the vessels could go and come. And in the meantime the\nexpense should be very small, for she would have an answer to the\ngrand question first, whether it could be obtained or no; and then an\naccount of the expense of it, that so I might judge for myself whether\nI would part with the needful sum or no, before any money was\ndisbursed on my account.\n\nI could not but be thoroughly satisfied with her contrivance in this\nparticular, and I had nothing to add to it but that I would not have\nher limit her friend so strictly, but that if he saw the way clear,\nand that he was sure to obtain it, he should go through stitch with\nit, if within the expense of two or three or four hundred pounds, and\nthat, upon advice of its being practicable, he should have bills\npayable by such a person on delivery of the warrant for the thing.\n\nTo fortify this, I enclosed in her packet a letter to one of my\ncorrespondents, whom I could particularly trust, with a credit for the\nmoney, on such-an-such conditions; but the honesty and integrity of my\nwife's correspondence was such as prevented all the expense, and yet I\nhad the wished-for security, as if it had been all paid, as you shall\nhear presently.\n\nAll these things being fixed to our minds, and all things left behind\nin good posture of settlement as usual, we embarked together and put\nto sea, having the opportunity of an English man-of-war being on the\ncoast in pursuit of the pirates, and who was just then standing away\ntowards the Gulf of Florida, and told us he would see us safe as far\nas New Providence, on the Bahama Islands.\n\nAnd now having fair weather and a pleasant voyage, and my flannels\ntaken off my legs, I must hint a little what cargo I had with me; for\nas my circumstances were very good in that country, so I did not go\nsuch a voyage as this, and with a particular reserve of fortunes\nwhatever might afterwards happen, without a sufficient cargo for our\nsupport, and whatever exigence might happen.\n\nOur sloop, as I said, was of about sixty or seventy tons; and as\ntobacco, which is the general produce of the country, was no\nmerchandise at Nevis, that is to say, for a great quantity, so we\ncarried very little, but loaded the sloop with corn, peas, meal, and\nsome barrels of pork; and an excellent cargo it was, most of it being\nthe produce of my own plantation. We took also a considerable sum of\nmoney with us in Spanish gold, which was, as above, not for trade, but\nfor all events. I also ordered another sloop to be hired, and to be\nsent after me, loaden with the same goods, as soon as they should have\nadvice from me that I was safe arrived.\n\nWe came to the latitude of the island of Antigua, which was very near\nto that of Nevis, whither we intended to go, on the eighteenth day\nafter our passing the Capes of Virginia, but had no sight of the\nisland; only our master said he was sure if he stood the same course\nas he then was, and the gale held, I say he told me he was sure he\nshould make the island in less than five hours' sail; so he stood on\nfair for the islands. However, his account had failed him, for we held\non all the evening, made no land, and likewise all night, when in the\ngrey of the morning we discovered from the topmast-head a brigantine\nand a sloop making sail after us, at the distance of about six\nleagues, fair weather, and the wind fresh at S.E.\n\nOur master soon understood what they were, and came down into the\ncabin to me to let me know it. I was much surprised, you may be sure,\nat the danger, but my poor wife took from me all the concern for\nmyself to take care of her, for she was frighted to that degree that I\nthought we should not have been able to keep life in her.\n\nWhile we were thus under the first hurry and surprise of the thing,\nsuddenly another noise from the deck called us up to look out, and\nthat was, \"Land! land!\" The master and I--for by this time I had got\nout of my cabin--run upon the deck, and there we saw the state of our\ncase very plain. The two rogues that stood after us laid on all the\ncanvas they could carry, and crowded after us amain, but at the\ndistance, as I have said, of about six leagues, rather more than less.\nOn the other hand, the land discovered lay about nine leagues right\nahead, so that if the pirates could get of us, so as to sail three\nfeet for our two, it was evident they would be up with us before we\ncould make the island. If not, we should escape them and get in; but\neven then we had no great hope to do any more than to run the ship\nashore to save our lives, and so, stranding our vessel, spoil both\nsloop and cargo.\n\nWhen we were making this calculation our master came in cheerfully,\nand told me he had crowded on more sail, and found the sloop carried\nit very well, and that he did not find the rogues gained much upon us,\nand that especially if one of them did not, that was the sloop, he\nfound he could go away from the brigantine as he pleased. Thus we gave\nthem what they call a stern chase, and they worked hard to come up\nwith us till towards noon, when on a sudden they both stood away and\ngave us over, to our great satisfaction you may be sure.\n\nWe did not, it seems, so easily see the occasion of our deliverance as\nthe pirate did; for while we went spooning away large with the wind\nfor one of the islands, with those two spurs in our heels, that is,\nwith the two thieves at our sterns, there lay an English man-of-war in\nthe road of Nevis, which was the same island from whence they espied\nthe pirates, but the land lying between, we could not see them.\n\nAs the man-of-war discovered them she immediately slipped her cable\nand put herself under sail in chase of the rogues; and they as soon\nperceived her, and being windward, put themselves upon a wind to\nescape her; and thus we were delivered, and in half-an-hour more we\nknew who was our deliverer, seeing the man-of-war stretch ahead clear\nof the island, and stand directly after the pirates, who now crowded\nfrom us as fast as they crowded after us before; and thus we got safe\ninto Antigua, after the terrible apprehension we had been in of being\ntaken. Our apprehensions of being taken now were much more than they\nwould have been on board a loaden ship from or to London, where the\nmost they ordinarily do is to rifle the ship, take what is valuable\nand portable, and let her go. But ours being but a sloop, and all our\nloading being good provisions, such as they wanted, to be sure, for\ntheir ship's store, they would certainly have carried us away, ship\nand all, taken out the cargo and the men, and perhaps have set the\nsloop on fire; so that, as to our cargo of gold, it had been\ninevitably lost, and we hurried away, nobody knows where, and used as\nsuch barbarous fellows are wont to use innocent people as fall into\ntheir hands.\n\nBut we were now out of their hands, and had the satisfaction a few\ndays after to hear that the man-of-war pursued them so close,\nnotwithstanding they changed their course in the night, that the next\nday they were obliged to separate and shift for themselves; so the\nman-of-war took one of them, namely, the brigantine, and carried her\ninto Jamaica, but the other, viz., the sloop, made her escape.\n\nBeing arrived here, we presently disposed of our cargo, and at a\ntolerable good price; and now the question was, what I should do next.\nI looked upon myself to be safe here from the fears I had been under\nof being discovered as a rebel, and so indeed I was; but having been\nnow absent five months, and having sent the ship back with a cargo of\nrum and molasses, which I knew was wanting in my plantations, I\nreceived the same vessel back in return loaden, as at first, with\nprovisions.\n\nWith this cargo my wife received a packet from London from the person\nwhom she had employed, as above, to solicit a pardon, who very\nhonestly wrote to her that he would not be so unjust to her friend,\nwhoever he was, as to put him to any expense for a private\nsolicitation; for that he was very well assured that his Majesty had\nresolved, from his own native disposition to acts of clemency and\nmercy to his subjects, to grant a general pardon, with some few\nexceptions to persons extraordinary, and he hoped her friend was none\nof the extraordinary persons to be excepted.\n\nThis was a kind of life from the dead to us both, and it was resolved\nthat my wife should go back in the sloop directly to Virginia, where\nshe should wait the good news from England, and should send me an\naccount of it as soon as she received it.\n\nAccordingly she went back, and came safe with the sloop and cargo to\nour plantation, from whence, after above four months' more\nexpectation, behold the sloop came to me again, but empty and gutted\nof all her cargo, except about a hundred sacks of unground malt, which\nthe pirates, not knowing how to brew, knew not what to do with, and so\nhad left in her. However, to my infinite satisfaction, there was a\npacket of letters from my wife, with another to her from England, as\nwell one from her friend as one from my own correspondent; both of\nthem inti mating that the king had signed an act of grace, that is to\nsay, a general free pardon, and sent me copies of the act, wherein it\nwas manifest that I was fully included.\n\nAnd here let me hint, that having now, as it were, received my life at\nthe hands of King George, and in a manner so satisfying as it was to\nme, it made a generous convert of me, and I became sincerely given in\nto the interest of King George; and this from a principle of gratitude\nand a sense of my obligation to his Majesty for my life; and it has\ncontinued ever since, and will certainly remain with me as long as any\nsense of honour and of the debt of gratitude remains with me. I\nmention this to hint how far in such cases justice and duty to\nourselves commands us; namely, that to those who graciously give us\nour lives when it is in their power to take them away, those lives are\na debt ever after, and ought to be set apart for their service and\ninterest as long as any of the powers of life remain, for gratitude is\na debt that never ceases while the benefit received remains; and if my\nprince has given me my life, I can never pay the debt fully, unless\nsuch a circumstance as this should happen, that the prince's life\nshould be in my power, and I as generously preserved it. And yet\nneither would the obligation be paid then, because the cases would\ndiffer; thus, that my preserving the life of my prince was my natural\nduty, whereas the prince on his side, my life being forfeited to him,\nhad no motive but mere clemency and beneficence.\n\nPerhaps this principle may not please all that read it; but as I have\nresolved to guide my actions in things of such a nature by the rules\nof strict virtue and principles of honour, so I must lay it down as a\nrule of honour, that a man having once forfeited his life to the\njustice of his prince and to the laws of his country, and receiving it\nback as a bounty from the grace of his sovereign, such a man can never\nlift up his hand again against that prince without a forfeiture of his\nvirtue and an irreparable breach of his honour and duty, and deserves\nno pardon after it either from God or man. But all this is a\ndigression: I leave it as a sketch of the laws of honour, printed by\nthe laws of nature in the breast of a soldier or a man of honour, and\nwhich, I believe, all impartial persons who understand what honour\nmeans will subscribe to.\n\nBut I return now to my present circumstances. My wife was gone, and\nwith her all my good fortune and success in business seemed to have\nforsaken me; and I had another scene of misery to go through, after I\nhad thought that all my misfortunes were over and at an end.\n\nMy sloop, as I have told you, arrived, but having met with a pirate\nrogue in the Gulf of Florida, they took her first; then finding her\ncargo to be all eatables, which they always want, they gutted her of\nall her loading, except, as I have said, about a hundred sacks of\nmalt, which they really knew not what to do with; and, which was still\nworse, they took away all the men except the master and two boys, who\nthey left on board just to run the vessel into Antigua, where they\nsaid they were bound.\n\nBut the most valuable part of my cargo, viz., a packet of letters from\nEngland, those they left, to my inexpressible comfort and\nsatisfaction; and, particularly, that by those I saw my way home to\nreturn to my wife and to my plantations, from which I promised myself\nnever to wander any more.\n\nIn order to this, I now embarked myself and all my effects on board\nthe sloop, resolving to sail directly to the Capes of Virginia. My\ncaptain beating it up to reach the Bahama channel, had not been two\ndays at sea but we were overtaken by a violent storm, which drove us\nso far upon the coast of Florida as that we twice struck upon the\nshore, and had we struck a third time we had been inevitably lost. A\nday or two after that, the storm abating a little, we kept the sea,\nbut found the wind blowing so strong against our passing the gulf, and\nthe sea going so high, we could not hold it any longer. So we were\nforced to bear away and make what shift we could; in which distress,\nthe fifth day after, we made land, but found it to be Cape ----, the\nnorth-west part of the isle of Cuba. Here we found ourselves under a\nnecessity to run in under the land for shelter, though we had not come\nto an anchor, so we had not touched the king of Spain's territories at\nall. However, in the morning we were surrounded with five Spanish\nbarks, or boats, such as they call _barco longos_, full of men, who\ninstantly boarded us, took us and carried us into the Havannah, the\nmost considerable port belonging to the Spaniards in that part of the\nworld.\n\nHere the sloop was immediately seized, and in consequence plundered,\nas any one that knows the Spaniards, especially in that country, will\neasily guess. Our men were made prisoners and sent to the common gaol;\nand as for myself and the captain, we were carried before the Alcade\nMajor, or intendant of the place, as criminals.\n\nI spoke Spanish very well, having served under the king of Spain in\nItaly, and it stood me in good stead at this time; for I so\neffectually argued the injustice of their treatment of me that the\ngovernor, or what I ought to call him, frankly owned they ought not to\nhave stopped me, seeing I was in the open sea pursuing my voyage, and\noffered no offence to anybody, and had not landed or offered to land\nupon any part of his Catholic Majesty's dominions till I was brought\nas a prisoner.\n\nIt was a great favour that I could obtain thus much; but I found it\neasier to obtain an acknowledgment that I had received wrong than to\nget any satisfaction for that wrong, and much less was there any hope\nor prospect of restitution; and I was let know that I was to wait till\nan account could be sent to the viceroy of Mexico, and orders could be\nreceived back from him how to act in the affair.\n\nI could easily foresee what all this tended to, namely, to a\nconfiscation of the ship and goods by the ordinary process at the\nplace; and that my being left to the decision of the viceroy of Mexico\nwas but a pretended representation of things to him from the\ncorregidore or judge of the place.\n\nHowever, I had no remedy but the old insignificant thing called\npatience, and this I was better furnished with because I did not so\nmuch value the loss as I made them believe I did. My greatest\napprehensions were that they would detain me and keep me as a prisoner\nfor life, and perhaps send me to their mines in Peru, as they have\ndone many, and pretended to do to all that come on shore in their\ndominions, how great soever the distresses may have been which have\nbrought them thither, and which has been the reason why others who\nhave been forced on shore have committed all manner of violence upon\nthe Spaniards in their turn, resolving, however dear they sold their\nlives, not to fall into their hands.\n\nBut I got better quarter among them than that too, which was, as I\nhave said, much of it owing to my speaking Spanish, and to my telling\nthem how I had fought in so many occasions in the quarrel of his\nCatholic Majesty in Italy; and, by great good chance, I had the king\nof France's commission for lieutenant-colonel in the Irish brigade in\nmy pocket, where it was mentioned that the said brigade was then\nserving in the armies of France, under the orders of his Catholic\nMajesty, in Italy.\n\nI failed not to talk up the gallantry and personal bravery of his\nCatholic Majesty on all occasions, and particularly in many battles\nwhere, by the way, his Majesty had never been at all, and in some\nwhere I had never been myself. But I found I talked to people who knew\nnothing of the matter, and so anything went down with them if it did\nbut praise the king of Spain and talk big of the Spanish cavalry, of\nwhich, God knows, there was not one regiment in the army, at least\nwhile I was there.\n\nHowever, this way of managing myself obtained me the liberty of the\nplace, upon my parole that I would not attempt an escape; and I\nobtained also, which was a great favour, to have two hundred pieces of\neight allowed me out of the sale of my cargo for subsistence till I\ncould negotiate my affairs at Mexico. As for my men, they were\nmaintained as prisoners at the public charge.\n\nWell, after several months' solicitation and attendance, all I could\nobtain was the satisfaction of seeing my ship and cargo confiscated\nand my poor sailors in a fair way to be sent to the mines. The last I\nbegged off, upon condition of paying three hundred pieces of eight for\ntheir ransom, and having them set on shore at Antigua, and myself to\nremain hostage for the payment of the said three hundred pieces of\neight, and for two hundred pieces of eight, which I had already had,\nand for five hundred pieces of eight more for my own ransom, if, upon\na return from Mexico, the sentence of confiscation, as above, should\nbe confirmed by the viceroy.\n\nThese were hard articles indeed, but I was forced to submit to them;\nnor, as my circumstances were above all such matters as these, as to\nsubstance, did I lay it much to heart. The greatest difficulty that\nlay in my way was, that I knew not how to correspond with my friends\nin any part of the world, or which way to supply myself with\nnecessaries or with money for the payment I had agreed to, the\nSpaniards being so tenacious of their ports that they allowed nobody\nto come on shore, or indeed near the shore, from any part of the\nworld, upon pain of seizure and confiscation, as had been my case\nalready. Upon this difficulty I began to reason with the corregidore,\nand tell him that he put things upon us that were impossible, and that\nwere inconsistent with the customs of nations; that, if a man was\nprisoner at Algiers, they would allow him to write to his friends to\npay his ransom, and would admit the person that brought it to come and\ngo free as a public person, and if they did not, no treaty could be\ncarried on for the ransom of a slave, nor the conditions be performed\nwhen they are agreed upon.\n\nI brought it then down to my own case, and desired to know, upon\nsupposition, that I might, within the time limited in that agreement,\nhave the sums of money ready for the ransom of my men and of myself,\nhow I should obtain to have notice given me of it, or how it should be\nbrought, seeing the very persons bringing that notice, or afterwards\npresuming to bring the money, might be liable to be seized and\nconfiscated, as I had been, and the money itself be taken as a second\nprize, without redeeming the first.\n\nThough this was so reasonable a request that it could not be withstood\nin point of argument, yet the Spaniard shrunk his head into his\nshoulders, and said they had not power sufficient to act in such a\ncase; that the king's laws were so severe against the suffering any\nstrangers to set their foot on his Catholic Majesty's dominions in\nAmerica, and they could not dispense with the least tittle of them\nwith out a particular _assiento_, as they called it, from the\nConsulado, or Chamber of Commerce, at Seville, or a command under the\nhand and seal of the viceroy of Mexico.\n\n\"How! signior corregidore,\" said I, with some warmth, and, as it were,\nwith astonishment, \"have you not authority enough to sign a passport\nfor an agent, or ambassador, to come on shore here, from any of the\nking of Great Britain's governors in these parts, under a white flag,\nor flag of truce, to speak with the governor of this place, or with\nany other person in the king's name, on the subject of such business\nas the governor may have to communicate? Why,\" said I, \"if you cannot\ndo that, you cannot act according to the law of nations.\"\n\nHe shook his head, but still said no, he could not do even so much as\nthat; but here one of the military governors put in and opposed him,\nand they two differed warmly, the first insisting that their orders\nwere deficient in that particular; but the other said that, as they\nwere bound up to them, it could not be in their power to act\notherwise, and that they were answerable for the ill consequences.\n\n\"Well, then,\" says the governor to the corregidore, \"now you have kept\nthis Englishman as hostage for the ransom of the men that you have\ndismissed, suppose he tells you the money is ready, either at such, or\nsuch, or such a place, how shall he bring it hither? You will take all\nthe people prisoners that offer to bring it; what must he do? If you\nsay you will send and fetch it, what security shall he have that he\nshall have his liberty when it is paid you? and why should he trust\nyou so far as to pay the money, and yet remain here a prisoner?\"\n\nThis carried so much reason with it that the corregidore knew not what\nto say, but that so was the law, and he could act no otherwise but by\nthe very letter of it; and here each was so positive that nothing\ncould determine it but another express to be sent to the viceroy of\nMexico.\n\nUpon this the governor was so kind as to say he would get me a\npassport for anybody that should bring the money, and any vessel they\nwere in, by his own authority, and for their safe returning, and\ntaking me with them, provided I would answer for it that they should\nbring no European or other goods whatever with them, and should not\nset foot on shore without his express permission, and provided he did\nnot receive orders to the contrary, in the meantime, from any superior\nhand; and that, even in such a case, they should have liberty to go\nback freely from whence they came, under the protection of a white\nflag.\n\nI bowed very respectfully to the governor in token of my acknowledging\nhis justice, and then presented my humble petition to him that he\nwould allow my men to take their own sloop; that it should be rated at\na certain value, and would be obliged they should bring specie on\nboard with them, and that they should either pay it for the sloop or\nleave the sloop again.\n\nThen he inquired to what country he would send them for so much money,\nand if I could assure him of the payment; and when he understood it\nwas no farther than to Virginia he seemed very easy; and, to satisfy\nthe corregidore, who still stood off, adhering with a true Spanish\nstiffness to the letter of the law, the said governor calls out to me:\n\"Signior,\" says he, \"I shall make all this matter easy to you, if you\nagree to my proposal. Your men shall have the sloop, on condition you\nshall be my hostage for her return; but they shall not take her as\nyour sloop, though she shall in the effect be yours on the payment of\nthe money; but you shall take two of my men on board with you, upon\nyour parole for their safe return, and when she returns she shall\ncarry his Catholic Majesty's colours, and be entered as one of the\nsloops belonging to the Havannah; one of the Spaniards to be\ncommander, and to be called by such a name as he shall appoint.\"\n\nThis the corregidore came into immediately, and said this was within\nthe letter, of the king's commanderie or precept; upon condition,\nhowever, that she should bring no European goods on board. I desired\nit might be put in other words; namely, that she should bring no\nEuropean goods on shore. It cost two days' debate between these two\nwhether it should pass that no European goods should be brought in the\nship or brought on shore; but having found means to intimate that I\nmeant not to trade there, but would not be tied from bringing a small\npresent to a certain person in acknowledgment of favours--I say, after\nI had found room to place such a hint right where it should be placed,\nI found it was all made easy to me; and it was all agreed presently\nthat, after the ransom was paid, and the ship also bought, it was but\nreasonable that I should have liberty to trade to any other country\nnot in the dominions of the king of Spain, so to make up my losses;\nand that it would be hard to oblige my men to bring away the vessel\nlight, and so lose the voyage, and add so much to our former\nmisfortunes; that, so long as no goods were brought on shore in the\ncountry belonging to his Catholic Majesty's dominions, which was all\nthat they had to defend, the rest was no business of theirs.\n\nNow I began to see my way through this unhappy business, and to find,\nthat as money would bring me out of it, so money would bring it to\nturn to a good account another way. Wherefore I sent the sloop away\nunder Spanish colours, and called her the _Nuestra Signiora de la Val\nde Grace_, commanded by Signior Giraldo de Nesma, one of the two\nSpaniards.\n\nWith the sloop I sent letters to my wife and to my chief manager with\norders to load her back, as I there directed, viz., that she should\nhave two hundred barrels of flour, fifty barrels of pease; and, to\nanswer my other views, I ordered a hundred bales to be made up of all\nsorts of European goods, such as not my own warehouses only would\nsupply, but such as they could be supplied with in other warehouses\nwhere I knew they had credit for anything.\n\nIn this cargo I directed all the richest and most valuable English\ngoods they had, or could get, whether linen, woollen, or silk, to be\nmade up; the coarser things, such as we use in Virginia for clothing\nof servants, such I ordered to be left behind for the use of the\nplantation. In less than seven weeks' time the sloop returned, and I,\nthat failed not every day to look out for her on the strand, was the\nfirst that spied her at sea at a distance, and knew her by her sails,\nbut afterwards more particularly by her signals.\n\nWhen she returned she came into the road with her Spanish ancient\nflying, and came to an anchor as directed; but I, that had seen her\nsome hours before, went directly to the governor and gave him an\naccount of her being come, and fain I would have obtained the favour\nto have his excellency, as I called him, go on board in person, that\nhe might see how well his orders were executed. But he declined that,\nsaying he could not justify going off of the island, which was, in\nshort, to go out of his command of the fort, which he could not\nreassume without a new commission from the king's own hand.\n\nThen I asked leave to go on board myself, which he granted me; and I\nbrought on shore with me the full sum in gold which I had conditioned\nto pay for the ransom both of my men and myself, and for the purchase\nof the sloop; and as I obtained leave to land in a different place, so\nmy governor sent his son with six soldiers to receive and convey me\nwith the money to the castle, where he commanded, and therein to his\nown house. I had made up the money in heavy parcels, as if it had been\nall silver, and gave it to two of my men who belonged to the sloop,\nwith orders to them that they should make it seem, by their carrying\nit, to be much heavier than it was. This was done to conceal three\nparcels of goods which I had packed up with the money to make a\npresent to the governor as I intended.\n\nWhen the money was carried in and laid down on a table, the governor\nordered my men to withdraw, and I gave the soldiers each of them a\npiece of eight to drink, for which they were very thankful, and the\ngovernor seemed well pleased with it also. Then I asked him presently\nif he would please to receive the money. He said no, he would not\nreceive it but in presence of the corregidore and the other people\nconcerned. Then I begged his excellency, as I called him, to give me\nleave to open the parcels in his presence, for that I would do myself\nthe honour to acknowledge his favours in the best manner I could.\n\nHe told me no, he could not see anything be brought on shore but the\nmoney; but, if I had brought anything on shore for my own use, he\nwould not be so strict as to inquire into that, so I might do what I\npleased myself.\n\nUpon that I went into the place, shut myself in, and having opened all\nthe things, placed them to my mind. There was five little parcels, as\nfollows:--\n\n\n1, 2. A piece of twenty yards fine English broad cloth, five yards\nblack, five yards crimson, in one parcel; and the rest of fine\nmixtures in another parcel.\n\n3. A piece of thirty ells of fine Holland linen.\n\n4. A piece of eighteen yards of fine English brocaded silk.\n\n5. A piece of black Colchester bays.\n\n\nAfter I had placed these by themselves, I found means, with some\nseeming difficulties and much grimace, to bring him to know that this\nwas intended for a present to himself. After all that part was over,\nand he had seemed to accept them, he signified, after walking a\nhundred turns and more in the room by them, by throwing his hat, which\nwas under his arm, upon them, and making a very stiff bow; I say,\nafter this he seemed to take his leave of me for a while, and I waited\nin an outer room. When I was called in again, I found that he had\nlooked over all the particulars, and caused them to be removed out of\nthe place.\n\nBut when I came again I found him quite another man. He thanked me for\nmy present; told me it was a present fit to be given to a viceroy of\nMexico rather than to a mere governor of a fort; that he had done me\nno services suitable to such a return, but that he would see if he\ncould not oblige me further before I left the place.\n\nAfter our compliments were over I obtained leave to have the\ncorregidore sent for, who accordingly came, and in his presence the\nmoney stipulated for the ransom of the ship and of the men was paid.\n\nBut here the corregidore showed that he would be as severely just on\nmy side as on theirs, for he would not admit the money as a ransom for\nus as prisoners, but as a deposit for so much as we were to be\nransomed for if the sentence of our being made prisoners should be\nconfirmed.\n\nAnd then the governor and corregidore, joining together, sent a\nrepresentation of the whole affair--at least we were told so--to the\nviceroy of Mexico; and it was privately hinted to me that I would do\nwell to stay for the return of the _aviso_--that is, a boat which they\nsend over the bay to Vera Cruz with an express to Mexico, whose return\nis generally performed in two months.\n\nI was not unwilling to stay, having secret hints given me that I\nshould find some way to go with my sloop towards Vera Cruz myself,\nwhere I might have an occasion to trade privately for the cargo which\nI had on board. But it came about a nearer way; for, about two days\nafter this money being deposited, as above, the governor's son invited\nhimself on board my sloop, where I told him I would be very glad to\nsee him, and whither, at the same time, he brought with him three\nconsiderable merchants, Spaniards, two of them not inhabitants of the\nplace.\n\nWhen they were on board they were very merry and pleasant, and I\ntreated them so much to their satisfaction that, in short, they were\nnot well able to go on shore for that night, but were content to take\na nap on some carpets, which I caused to be spread for them; and that\nthe governor's son might think himself well used, I brought him a very\ngood silk nightgown, with a crimson velvet cap, to lie down in, and in\nthe morning desired him to accept of them for his use, which he took\nvery kindly.\n\nDuring that merry evening one of the merchants, not so touched with\ndrink as the young gentleman, nor so as not to mind what it was he\ncame about, takes an occasion to withdraw out of the great cabin and\nenter into a parley with the master of the sloop in order to trade for\nwhat European goods we had on board. The master took the hint, and\ngave me notice of what had passed, and I gave him instructions what to\nsay and what to do; according to which instructions they made but few\nwords, bought the goods for about five thousand pieces of eight, and\ncarried them away themselves, and at their own hazards.\n\nThis was very agreeable to me, for now I began to see I should lick\nmyself whole by the sale of this cargo, and should make myself full\namends of Jack Spaniard for all the injuries he had done me in the\nfirst of these things. With this view I gave my master or captain of\nthe sloop instructions for sale of all the rest of the goods, and left\nhim to manage by himself, which he did so well that he sold the whole\ncargo the next day to the three Spaniards; with this additional\ncircumstance, that they desired the sloop might carry the goods, as\nthey were on board, to such part of the _terra firma_ as they should\nappoint between the Honduras and the coast of La Vera Cruz.\n\nIt was difficult for me to make good this part of the bargain, but\nfinding the price agreed for would very well answer the voyage, I\nconsented. But then how to send the sloop away and remain among the\nSpaniards when I was now a clear man, this was a difficulty too, as it\nwas also to go away, and not wait for a favourable answer from the\nviceroy of Mexico to the representation of the governor and the\ncorregidore. However, at last I resolved to go in the sloop, fall out\nwhat would; so I went to the governor and represented to him that,\nbeing now to expect a favourable answer from Mexico, it would be a\ngreat loss to me to keep the sloop there all the while, and I desired\nhis leave for me to go with the sloop to Antigua to sell and dispose\nof the cargo, which he well knew I was obliged not to bring on shore\nthere at the Havannah, and which would be in danger of being spoiled\nby lying so long on board. This I obtained readily, with license to\ncome again into the road, and, for myself only, to come on shore in\norder to hear the viceroy's pleasure in my case, which was depending.\n\nHaving thus obtained a license or passport for the sloop and myself, I\nput to sea with the three Spanish merchants on board with me. They\ntold me they did not live at the Havannah, but it seems one of them\ndid; and some rich merchants of the Havannah, or of the parts\nthereabouts in the same island, were concerned with them, for they\nbrought on board, that night we put to sea, a great sum of money in\npieces of eight; and, as I understood afterwards, that these merchants\nbought the cargo of me, and though they gave me a very great price for\neverything, yet that they sold them again to the merchants, who they\nprocured on the coast of La Vera Cruz, at a prodigious advantage, so\nthat they got above a hundred per cent, after I had gained very\nsufficiently before.\n\nWe sailed from the Havannah directly for Vera Cruz. I scrupled\nventuring into the port at first, and was very uneasy lest I should\nhave another Spanish trick put upon me; but as we sailed under Spanish\ncolours, they showed us such authentic papers from the proper officers\nthat there was no room to fear anything.\n\nHowever, when we came in sight of the Spanish coast, I found they had\na secret clandestine trade to carry on, which, though it was secret,\nyet they knew the way of it so well that it was but a mere road to\nthem. The case was this: we stood in close under the shore in the\nnight, about six leagues to the north of the port, where two of the\nthree merchants went on shore in the boat, and in three hours or there\nabouts they came on board again with five canoes and seven or eight\nmerchants more with them, and as soon as they were on board we stood\noff to sea, so that by daylight we were quite out of sight of land.\n\nI ought to have mentioned before that as soon as we were put to sea\nfrom the Havannah, and during our voyage into the Gulf of Mexico,\nwhich was eight days, we rummaged the whole cargo, and opening every\nbale as far as the Spanish merchants desired, we trafficked with them\nfor the whole cargo, except the barrels of flour and pease.\n\nThis cargo was considerable in itself, for my wife's account or\ninvoice, drawn out by my tutor and manager, amounted to \u00c2\u00a32684, 10s.,\nand I sold the whole, including what had been sold in the evening,\nwhen they were on board first, as I have said, for thirty-eight\nthousand five hundred and ninety-three pieces of eight, and they\nallowed me twelve hundred pieces of eight for the freight of the\nsloop, and made my master and the seamen very handsome presents\nbesides; and they were well able to do this too, as you shall hear\npresently.\n\nAfter we were gotten out of sight of land the Spaniards fell to their\ntraffic, and our three merchants opened their shop, as they might say,\nfor it was their shop. As to me, I had nothing to do with it or with\ntheir goods. They drove their bargain in a few hours, and at night we\nstood in again for the shore, when the five canoes carried a great\npart of the goods on shore, and brought the money back in specie, as\nwell for that they carried as for all the rest, and at their second\nvoyage carried all away clear, leaving me nothing on board but my\nbarrels of flour and pease, which they bade me money for too, but not\nso much as I expected.\n\nHere I found that my Spanish merchants made above seventy thousand\npieces of eight of the cargo I had sold them, upon which I had a great\nmind to be acquainted with those merchants on the _terra firma_, who\nwere the last customers; for it presently occurred to me that I could\neasily go with a sloop from Virginia, and taking a cargo directed on\npurpose from England of about \u00c2\u00a35000 or \u00c2\u00a36000, I might easily make four\nof one. With this view I began to make a kind of an acquaintance with\nthe Spaniards which came in the canoes, and we became so intimate that\nat last, with the consent of the three Spaniards of the Havannah, I\naccepted an invitation on shore to their house, which was a little\nvilla, or rather plantation, where they had an _ingenio_, that is to\nsay, a sugar-house, or sugar-work, and there they treated us like\nprinces.\n\nI took occasion at this invitation to say that, if I knew how to find\nmy way thither again, I could visit them once or twice a year, very\nmuch to their advantage and mine too. One of the Spaniards took the\nhint, and taking me into a room by myself, \"Seignior,\" says he, \"if\nyou have any thoughts of coming to this place again, I shall give you\nsuch directions as you shall be sure not to mistake; and, upon either\ncoming on shore in the night and coming up to this place, or upon\nmaking the signals which we shall give you, we will not fail to come\noff to you, and bring money enough for any _cargaison_\" (so they call\nit) \"that you shall bring.\"\n\nI took all their directions, took their paroles of honour for my\nsafety, and, without taking any notice to my first three merchants,\nlaid up the rest in my most secret thoughts, resolving to visit them\nagain in as short a time as I could; and thus having, in about five\ndays, finished all our merchandising, we stood off to sea, and made\nfor the island of Cuba, where I set my three Spaniards on shore with\nall their treasure, to their heart's content, and made the best of my\nway to Antigua, where, with all the despatch I could, I sold my two\nhundred barrels of flour, which, however, had suffered a little by the\nlength of the voyage; and having laden the sloop with rum, molasses,\nand sugar, I set sail again for the Havannah.\n\nI was now uneasy indeed, for fear of the pirates, for I was a rich\nship, having, besides goods, near forty thousand pieces of eight in\nsilver.\n\nWhen I came back to the Havannah, I went on shore to wait on the\ngovernor and the corregidore, and to hear what return was had from the\nviceroy, and had the good fortune to know that the viceroy had\ndisallowed that part of the sentence which condemned us as prisoners\nand put a ransom on us, which he insisted could not be but in time of\nopen war. But as to the confiscation, he deferred it to the Chamber or\nCouncil of Commerce at Seville, and the appeal to the king, if such be\npreferred.\n\nThis was, in some measure, a very good piece of justice in the\nviceroy; for, as we had not been on shore, we could not be legally\nimprisoned; and for the rest, I believe if I would have given myself\nthe trouble to have gone to Old Spain, and have preferred my claim to\nboth the ship and the cargo, I had recovered them also.\n\nHowever, as it was, I was now a freeman without ransom, and my men\nwere also free, so that all the money which I had deposited, as above,\nwas returned me; and thus I took my leave of the Havannah, and made\nthe best of my way for Virginia, where I arrived after a year and a\nhalf's absence; and notwithstanding all my losses, came home above\nforty thousand pieces of eight richer than I went out.\n\nAs to the old affair about the Preston prisoners, that was quite at an\nend, for the general pardon passed in Parliament made me perfectly\neasy, and I took no more thought about that part. I might here very\nusefully observe how necessary and inseparable  a companion fear is to\nguilt. It was but a few months before that the face of a poor Preston\ntransport would have frighted me out of my wits; to avoid them I\nfeigned myself sick, and wrapped my legs in flannel, as if I had the\ngout; whereas now they were no more surprise to me, nor was I any more\nuneasy to see them, than I was to see any other of the servants of the\nplantations.\n\nAnd that which was more particular than all was, that, though before I\nfancied every one of them would know me and remember me, and\nconsequently betray and accuse me, now, though I was frequently among\nthem, and saw most of them, if not all of them, one time or other,\nnay, though I remembered several of their faces, and even some of\ntheir names, yet there was not a man of them that ever took the least\nnotice of me, or of having known or seen me before.\n\nIt would have been a singular satisfaction to me if I could have known\nso much as this of them before, and have saved me all the fatigue,\nhazard, and misfortune that befell me afterwards; but man, a short\nsighted creature, sees so little before him that he can neither\nanticipate his joys nor prevent his disasters, be they ever so little\na distance from him.\n\nI had now my head full of my West India project, and I began to make\nprovision for it accordingly. I had a full account of what European\ngoods were most acceptable in New Spain; and, to add to my speed, I\nknew that the Spaniards were in great want of European goods, the\ngalleons from Old Spain having been delayed to an unusual length of\ntime for the two years before. Upon this account, not having time, as\nI thought, to send to England for a cargo of such goods as were most\nproper, I resolved to load my sloop with tobacco and rum, the last I\nbrought from Antigua, and go away to Boston in New England, and to New\nYork, and see if I could pick up a cargo to my mind.\n\nAccordingly, I took twenty thousand pieces of eight in money, and my\nsloop laden as above, and taking my wife with me, we went away. It was\nan odd and new thing at New England to have such a quantity of goods\nbought up there by a sloop from Virginia, and especially to be paid\nfor in ready money, as I did for most of my goods; and this set all\nthe trading heads upon the stretch, to inquire what and who I was; to\nwhich they had an immediate and direct answer, that I was a very\nconsiderable planter in Virginia, and that was all any of my men on\nboard the sloop could tell of me, and enough too.\n\nWell, it was the cause of much speculation among them, as I heard at\nsecond and third hands. Some said, \"He is certainly going to Jamaica;\"\nothers said, \"He is going to trade with the Spaniards;\" others that\n\"He is going to the South Sea and turn half merchant, half pirate, on\nthe coast of Chili and Peru;\" some one thing, some another, as the men\ngossips found their imaginations directed; but we went on with our\nbusiness, and laid out twelve thousand pieces of eight, besides our\ncargo of rum and tobacco, and went from thence to New York, where we\nlaid out the rest.\n\nThe chief of the cargo we bought here was fine English broadcloth,\nserges, druggets, Norwich stuffs, bays, says, and all kinds of woollen\nmanufactures, as also linen of all sorts, a very great quantity, and\nnear \u00c2\u00a31000 in fine silks of several sorts. Being thus freighted, I\ncame back safe to Virginia, and with very little addition to my cargo,\nbegan to prepare for my West India voyage.\n\nI should have mentioned that I had built upon my sloop and raised her\na little, so that I had made her carry twelve guns, and fitted her up\nfor defence; for I thought she should not be attacked and boarded by a\nfew Spanish _barco longos_, as she was before; and I found the benefit\nof it afterwards, as you shall hear.\n\nWe set sail the beginning of August, and as I had twice been attacked\nby pirates in passing the Gulf of Florida, or among the Bahama\nIslands, I resolved, though it was farther about, to stand off to sea,\nand so keep, as I believed it would be, out of the way of them.\n\nWe passed the tropic, as near as we could guess, just where the famous\nSir William Phipps fished up the silver from the Spanish plate wreck,\nand, standing in between the islands, kept our course W. by S.,\nkeeping under the isle of Cuba, and so running away, trade, as they\ncall it, into the great Gulf of Mexico, leaving the island of Jamaica\nto the S. and S.E., by this means avoiding, as I thought, all the\nSpaniards of Cuba or the Havannah.\n\nAs we passed the west point of Cuba three Spanish boats came off to\nboard us, as they had done before, on the other side of the island.\nBut they found themselves mistaken; we were too many for them, for we\nrun out our guns, which they did not perceive before, and firing three\nor four shots at them, they retired.\n\nThe next morning they appeared again, being five large boats and a\nbarque, and gave us chase; but we then spread our Spanish colours, and\nbrought to to fight them, at which they retired; so we escaped this\ndanger by the addition of force which we had made to our vessel.\n\nWe now had a fair run for our port, and as I had taken very good\ndirections, I stood away to the north of St. John d'Ulva, and then\nrunning in for the shore, found the place appointed exactly; and going\non shore, I sent the master of my sloop directly to the _ingenio_,\nwhere he found the Spanish merchant at his house, and where he dwelt\nlike a sovereign prince, who welcomed him, and understanding that I\nwas in a particular boat at the creek, as appointed, he came\nimmediately with him, and bringing another Spaniard from a villa not\nfar off, in about four hours they were with me.\n\nThey would have persuaded me to go up to their houses and have stayed\nthere till the next night, ordering the sloop to stand off as usual,\nbut I would not consent to let the sloop go to sea without me, so we\nwent on board directly, and, as the night was almost run, stood off to\nsea; so by daybreak we were quite out of sight of land.\n\nHere we began, as I said before, to open shop, and I found the\nSpaniards were extremely surprised at seeing such a cargo--I mean so\nlarge; for, in short, they had cared not if it had been four times as\nmuch. They soon ran through the contents of all the bales we opened\nthat night, and, with very little dispute about the price, they\napproved and accepted all that I showed them; but as they said they\nhad not money for any greater parcel, they agreed to go on shore the\nnext evening for more money.\n\nHowever, we spent the remainder of the night in looking over and\nmaking inventories or invoices of the rest of the cargo, that so they\nmight see the goods, know the value, and know what more money they had\nto bring.\n\n\n[Illustration: Colonel Jacque's arrival is announced]\n\n\nAccordingly, in the evening we stood in for the shore, and they\ncarried part of the cargo with them, borrowing the sloop's boat to\nassist them; and after they had lodged and landed the goods they came\non board again, bringing three of the other merchants with them who\nwere concerned before, and money enough to clear the whole ship--ay,\nand ship and all, if I had been willing to sell her.\n\nTo give them their due, they dealt with me like men of honour. They\nwere indeed sensible that they bought everything much cheaper of me\nthan they did before of the three merchants of the Havannah, these\nmerchants having been, as it were, the hucksters, and bought them\nfirst of me, and then advanced, as I have said, above one hundred per\ncent, upon the price they gave me. But yet, at the same time, I\nadvanced in the price much more now than I did before to the said\nSpaniards; nor was it without reason, because of the length and risk\nof the voyage, both out and home, which now lay wholly upon me.\n\nIn short, I sold the whole cargo to them, and for which I received\nnear two hundred thousand pieces of eight in money; besides which,\nwhen they came on board the second time, they brought all their boats\nloaden with fresh provisions, hogs, sheep, fowls, sweetmeats, &c.,\nenough for my whole voyage, all which they made a present of to me.\nAnd thus we finished our traffic to our mutual satisfaction, and\nparted with promises of further commerce, and with assurances on their\npart of all acts of friendship and assistance that I could desire if\nany disaster should befall me in any of these adventures--as indeed\nwas not improbable, considering the strictness and severity of their\ncustoms in case any people were trading upon their coast.\n\nI immediately called a council with my little crew which way we should\ngo back. The mate was for beating it up to windward and getting up to\nJamaica; but as we were too rich to run any risks, and were to take\nthe best course to get safe home, I thought, and so did the master of\nthe sloop, that our best way was to coast about the bay, and, keeping\nthe shore of Florida on board, make the shortest course to the gulf,\nand so make for the coast of Carolina, and to put in there into the\nfirst port we could, and wait for any English men-of-war that might be\non the coast to secure us to the capes.\n\nThis was the best course we could take, and proved very safe to us,\nexcepting that, about the cape of Florida, and on the coast in the\ngulf, till we came to the height of St. Augustine, we were several\ntimes visited with the Spaniards' _barco longos_ and small barks, in\nhopes of making a prize of us; but carrying Spanish colours deceived\nmost of them, and a good tier of guns kept the rest at a distance, so\nthat we came safe, though once or twice in danger of being run on\nshore by a storm of wind--I say, we came safe into Charles River in\nCarolina.\n\nFrom hence I found means to send a letter home, with an account to my\nwife of my good success; and having an account that the coast was\nclear of pirates, though there were no men-of-war in the place, I\nventured forward, and, in short, got safe into the Bay of Chesapeake,\nthat is to say, within the capes of Virginia, and in a few days more\nto my own house, having been absent three months and four days.\n\nNever did any vessel on this side the world make a better voyage in so\nshort a time that I made in this sloop; for by the most moderate\ncomputation I cleared in these three months \u00c2\u00a325,000 sterling in ready\nmoney, all the charges of the voyages to New England also being\nreckoned up.\n\nNow was my time to have sat still, contented with what I had got, if\nit was in the power of man to know when his good fortune was at the\nhighest. And more, my prudent wife gave it as her opinion that I\nshould sit down satisfied and push the affair no farther, and\nearnestly persuaded me to do so. But I, that had a door open, as I\nthought, to immense treasure, that had found the way to have a stream\nof the golden rivers of Mexico flow into my plantation of Virginia,\nand saw no hazards more than what were common to all such things in\nthe prosecution--I say, to me these things looked with another face,\nand I dreamed of nothing but millions and hundreds of thousands; so,\ncontrary to all moderate measures, I pushed on for another voyage, and\nlaid up a stock of all sorts of goods that I could get together proper\nfor the trade. I did not indeed go again to New England, for I had by\nthis time a very good cargo come from England pursuant to a commission\nI had sent several months before; so that, in short, my cargo,\naccording to the invoice now made out, amounted to above \u00c2\u00a310,000\nsterling first cost, and was a cargo so sorted and so well bought that\nI expected to have advanced upon them much more in proportion than I\nhad done in the cargo before.\n\nWith these expectations we began our second voyage in April, being\nabout five months after our return from the first. We had not indeed\nthe same good speed, even in our beginning, as we had at first; for\nthough we stood off to sea about sixty leagues in order to be out of\nthe way of the pirates, yet we had not been above five days at sea but\nwe were visited and rifled by two pirate barks, who, being bound to\nthe northward, that is to say, the banks of Newfoundland, took away\nall our provisions and all our ammunition and small arms, and left us\nvery ill provided to pursue our voyage; and it being so near home, we\nthought it advisable to come about and stand in for the capes again,\nto restore our condition and furnish ourselves with stores of all\nkinds for our voyage. This took us up about ten days, and we put to\nsea again. As for our cargo, the pirates did not meddle with it, being\nall bale goods, which they had no present use for, and knew not what\nto do with if they had them.\n\nWe met with no other adventure worth naming till, by the same course\nthat we had steered before, we came into the Gulf of Mexico; and the\nfirst misfortune we met with here was, that, on the back of Cuba,\ncrossing towards the point of the _terra firma_, on the coast of\nYucatan, we had sight of the flota of New Spain, that is, of the ships\nwhich come from Carthagena or Porto Bello, and go to the Havannah, in\norder to pursue their voyage to Europe.\n\nThey had with them one Spanish man-of-war and three frigates. Two of\nthe frigates gave us chase; but, it being just at the shutting in of\nthe day, we soon lost sight of them, and standing to the north, across\nthe Bay of Mexico, as if we were going to the mouth of Mississippi,\nthey lost us quite, and in a few days more we made the bottom of the\nbay, being the port we were bound for.\n\nWe stood in as usual in the night, and gave notice to our friends; but\ninstead of their former readiness to come on board, they gave us\nnotice that we had been seen in the bay, and that notice of us was\ngiven at Vera Cruz and at other places, and that several frigates were\nin quest of us, and that three more would be cruising the next morning\nin search for us. We could not conceive how this could be; but we were\nafterwards told that those three frigates, having lost sight of us in\nthe night, had made in for the shore, and had given the alarm of us as\nof privateers.\n\nBe that as it would, we had nothing to do but to consider what course\nto take immediately. The Spanish merchant's advice was very good if we\nhad taken it, namely, to have unladen as many of our bales as we could\nthat very night by the help of our boat and their canoes, and to make\nthe best of our way in the morning to the north of the gulf, and take\nour fate.\n\nThis my skipper or master thought very well of, but when we began to\nput it into execution, we were so confused and in such a hurry, being\nnot resolved what course to take, that we could not get out above\nsixteen bales of all sorts of goods before it began to be too light\nand it behoved us to sail. At last the master proposed a medium, which\nwas, that I should go on shore in the next boat, in which were five\nbales of goods more, and that I should stay on shore if the Spanish\nmerchants would undertake to conceal me, and let them go to sea and\ntake their chance.\n\nThe Spanish merchants readily undertook to protect me, especially it\nbeing so easy to have me pass for a natural Spaniard, and so they took\nme on shore with twenty-one bales of my goods, and the sloop stood off\nto sea. If they met with any enemies they were to stand in for the\nshore the next night; and we failed not to look well out for them, but\nto no purpose, for the next day they were discovered and chased by two\nSpanish frigates. They stood from them, and the sloop, being an\nexcellent sailer, gained so much that they would certainly have been\nclear of them when night came on, but a small picaroon of a sloop kept\nthem company in spite of all they could do, and two or three times\noffered to engage them, thereby to give time to the rest to come up;\nbut the sloop kept her way, and gave them a chase of three days and\nnights, having a fresh gale of wind at S.W., till she made the Rio\nGrand, or, as the French call it, the Mississippi, and there finding\nno remedy, they ran the vessel on shore not far from the fort which\nthe Spaniards call Pensacola, garrisoned at that time with French. Our\nmen would have entered the river as a port, but having no pilot, and\nthe current of the river being strong against them, the sloop ran on\nshore, and the men shifted as well as they could in their boats.\n\nI was now in a very odd condition indeed. My circumstances were in one\nsense, indeed, very happy--namely, that I was in the hands of my\nfriends, for such really they were, and so faithful that no men could\nhave been more careful of their own safety than were they of mine; and\nthat which added to the comfort of my new condition was the produce of\nmy goods, which were gotten on shore by their own advice and\ndirection, which was a fund sufficient to maintain me with them as\nlong as I could be supposed to stay there; and if not, the first\nmerchant to whose house I went assured me that he would give me credit\nfor twenty thousand pieces of eight if I had occasion for it.\n\nMy greatest affliction was, that I knew not how to convey news to my\nwife of my present condition, and how, among many misfortunes of the\nvoyage, I was yet safe and in good hands.\n\nBut there was no remedy for this part but the great universal cure of\nall incurable sorrows, viz., patience; and, indeed, I had a great deal\nof reason, not for patience only, but thankfulness, if I had known the\ncircumstances which I should have been reduced to if I had fallen into\nthe hands of the Spaniards; the best of which that I could reasonably\nhave expected had been to have been sent to the mines, or, which was\nten thousand times worse, the Inquisition; or, if I had escaped the\nSpaniards, as my men in the sloop did, the hardships they were exposed\nto, the dangers they were in, and the miseries they suffered were\nstill worse in wandering among savages, and the more savage French,\nwho plundered and stripped them, instead of relieving and supplying\nthem in their long wilderness journey over the mountains till they\nreached the S.W. parts of South Carolina, a journey which, indeed,\ndeserves to have an account to be given of it by itself. I say, all\nthese things, had I known of them, would have let me see that I had a\ngreat deal of reason, not only to be patient under my present\ncircumstances, but satisfied and thankful.\n\nHere, as I said, my patron, the merchant, entertained me like a\nprince; he made my safety his peculiar care, and while we were in any\nexpectation of the sloop being taken and brought into Vera Cruz, he\nkept me retired at a little house in a wood, where he kept a fine\naviary of all sorts of American birds, and out of which he yearly sent\nsome as presents to his friends in Old Spain.\n\nThis retreat was necessary lest, if the sloop should be taken and\nbrought into Vera Cruz, and the men be brought in prisoners, they\nshould be tempted to give an account of me as their supercargo or\nmerchant, and where both I and the twenty-one bales of goods were set\non shore. As for the goods, he made sure work with them, for they were\nall opened, taken out of the bales, and separated, and, being mixed\nwith other European goods which came by the galleons, were made up in\nnew package, and sent to Mexico in several parcels, some to one\nmerchant, some to another, so that it was impossible to have found\nthem out, even if they had had information of them.\n\nIn this posture, and in apprehension of some bad news of the sloop,\nI remained at the villa, or house in the vale--for so they called\nit--about five weeks. I had two negroes appointed to wait on me, one\nof which was my purveyor, or my cook, the other my valet; and my\nfriend, the master of all, came constantly every evening to visit and\nsup with me, when we walked out together into the aviary, which was,\nof its kind, the most beautiful thing that ever I saw in the world.\n\nAfter above five weeks' retreat of this kind, he had good intelligence\nof the fate of the sloop, viz., that the two frigates and a sloop had\nchased her till she ran on ground near the fort of Pensacola; that\nthey saw her stranded and broke in pieces by the force of the waves,\nthe men making their escape in their boat. This news was brought, it\nseems, by the said frigates to La Vera Cruz, where my friend went on\npurpose to be fully informed, and received the account from one of the\ncaptains of the frigates, and discoursed with him at large about it.\n\nI was better pleased with the loss of the sloop and all my cargo, the\nmen being got on shore and escaping, than I should have been with the\nsaving the whole cargo, if the men had fallen into the hands of the\nSpaniards; for now I was safe, whereas then, it being supposed they\nwould have been forced to some discovery about me, I must have fled,\nand should have found it very difficult to have made my escape, even\nwith all that my friends could have done for me too.\n\nBut now I was perfectly easy, and my friend, who thought confining me\nat the house in the vale no longer needful, brought me publicly home\nto his dwelling-house, as a merchant come from Old Spain by the last\ngalleons, and who, having been at Mexico, was come to reside with him.\n\nHere I was dressed like a Spaniard of the better sort, had three\nnegroes to attend me, and was called Don Ferdinand de Villa Moresa, in\nCastilia Feja--that is to say, in Old Castile.\n\nHere I had nothing to do but to walk about and ride out into the\nwoods, and come home again to enjoy the pleasantest and most agreeable\nretirement in the world; for certainly no men in the world live in\nsuch splendour and wallow in such immense treasures as the merchants\nof this place.\n\nThey live, as I have said, in a kind of country retreat at their\nvillas, or, as we would call them in Virginia, their plantations, and,\nas they do call them, their _ingenios_, where they make their indigo\nand their sugars. But they have also houses and warehouses at Vera\nCruz, where they go twice a year, when the galleons arrive from Old\nSpain, and when those galleons relade for their return. And it was\nsurprising to me, when I went to La Vera Cruz with them, to see what\nprodigious consignments they had from their correspondents in Old\nSpain, and with what despatch they managed them; for no sooner were\nthe cases, packs, and bales of European goods brought into their\nwarehouses but they were opened and repacked by porters and packers of\ntheir own--that is to say, negroes and Indian servants--and being made\nup into new bales and separate parcels, were all despatched again by\nhorses for Mexico, and directed to their several merchants there, and\nthe remainder carried home, as above, to the _ingenio_ where they\nlived, which was near thirty English miles from Vera Cruz, so that in\nabout twenty days their warehouses were again entirely free. At La\nVera Cruz, all their business was over there, and they and all their\nservants retired; for they stayed no longer there than needs must,\nbecause of the unhealthiness of the air.\n\nAfter the goods were thus despatched, it was equally surprising to see\nhow soon, and with what exactness, the merchants of Mexico to whom\nthose cargoes were separately consigned made the return, and how it\ncame all in silver or in gold, so that their warehouses in a few\nmonths were piled up, even to the ceiling, with chests of pieces of\neight and with bars of silver.\n\nIt is impossible to describe in the narrow compass of this work with\nwhat exactness and order, and yet with how little hurry, and not the\nleast confusion, everything was done, and how soon a weight of\nbusiness of such importance and value was negotiated and finished, the\ngoods repacked, invoices made, and everything despatched and gone; so\nthat in about five weeks all the goods they had received from Europe\nby the galleons were disposed of and entered in their journals to the\nproper account of their merchant to whom they were respectively\nconsigned; from thence they had book-keepers who drew out the invoices\nand wrote the letters, which the merchant himself only read over and\nsigned, and then other hands copied all again into other books.\n\nI can give no estimate of the value of the several consignments they\nreceived by that flota; but I remember that, when the galleons went\nback, they shipped on board, at several times, one million three\nhundred thousand pieces of eight in specie, besides a hundred and\neighty bales or bags of cochineal and about three hundred bales of\nindigo; but they were so modest that they said this was for themselves\nand their friends. That is to say, the several merchants of Mexico\nconsigned large quantities of bullion to them, to ship on board and\nconsign according to their order; but then I know also that, for all\nthat, they were allowed commission, so that their gain was very\nconsiderable even that way also.\n\nI had been with them at La Vera Cruz, and came back again before we\ncame to an account for the goods which I had brought on shore in the\ntwenty-one bales, which, by the account we brought them to (leaving a\npiece of everything to be governed by our last market), amounted to\neight thousand five hundred and seventy pieces of eight, all which\nmoney my friend--for so I must now call him--brought me in specie, and\ncaused his negroes to pile them up in one corner of my apartment; so\nthat I was indeed still very rich, all things considered.\n\nThere was a bale which I had caused to be packed up on purpose in\nVirginia, and which indeed I had written for from England, being\nchiefly of fine English broadcloths, silk, silk druggets, and fine\nstuffs of several kinds, with some very fine hollands, which I set\napart for presents, as I should find occasion; and as, whatever hurry\nI was in at carrying the twenty-one bales of goods on shore, I did not\nforget to let this bale be one of them, so, when we came to a sale for\nthe rest, I told them that this was a pack with clothes and\nnecessaries for my own wearing and use, and so desired it might not be\nopened with the rest, which was accordingly observed, and that bale or\npack was brought into my apartment.\n\nThis bale was, in general, made up of several smaller bales, which I\nhad directed, so that I might have room to make presents, equally\nsorted as the circumstance might direct me. However, they were all\nconsiderable, and I reckoned the whole bale cost me near \u00c2\u00a3200 sterling\nin England; and though my present circumstances required some limits\nto my bounty in making presents, yet the obligation I was under being\nso much the greater, especially to this one friendly, generous\nSpaniard, I thought I could not do better than, by opening two of the\nsmaller bales, join them together, and make my gift some thing\nsuitable to the benefactor, and to the respect he had shown me.\nAccordingly, I took two bales, and, laying the goods together, the\ncontents were as follows:--\n\n\nTwo pieces of fine English broadcloth, the finest that could be got in\nLondon, divided, as was that which I gave to the governor at the\nHavannah, into fine crimson in grain, fine light mixtures, and fine\nblack.\n\nFour pieces of fine holland, of 7s. to 8s. per ell in London.\n\nTwelve pieces of fine silk drugget and duroys, for men's wear.\n\nSix pieces of broad silks, two damasks, two brocaded silks, and two\nmantuas.\n\nWith a box of ribands and a box of lace; the last cost about \u00c2\u00a340\nsterling in England.\n\n\nThis handsome parcel I laid open in my apartment, and brought him\nupstairs one morning, on pretence to drink chocolate with me, which he\nordinarily did; when, as we drank chocolate and was merry, I said to\nhim, though I had sold him almost all my cargo and taken his money,\nyet the truth was, that I ought not to have sold them to him, but to\nhave laid them all at his feet, for that it was to his direction I\nowed the having anything saved at all.\n\nHe smiled, and, with a great deal of friendship in his face, told me\nthat not to have paid me for them would have been to have plundered a\nshipwreck, which had been worse than to have robbed an hospital.\n\nAt last I told him I had two requests to make to him, which must not\nbe denied. I told him I had a small present to make him, which I would\ngive him a reason why he should not refuse to accept; and the second\nrequest I would make after the first was granted. He said he would\nhave accepted my present from me if I had not been under a disaster,\nbut as it was it would be cruel and ungenerous. But I told him he was\nobliged to hear my reason for his accepting it. Then I told him that\nthis parcel was made up for him by name by my wife and I in Virginia,\nand his name set on the marks of the bale, and accordingly I showed\nhim the marks, which was indeed on one of the bales, but I had doubled\nit now, as above, so that I told him these were his own proper goods;\nand, in short, I pressed him so to receive them that he made a bow;\nand I said no more, but ordered my negro, that is to say, his negro\nthat waited on me, to carry them all, except the two boxes, into his\napartments, but would not let him see the particulars till they were\nall carried away.\n\nAfter he was gone about a quarter of an hour, he came in raving and\nalmost swearing, and in a great passion, but I could easily see he was\nexceedingly pleased; and told me, had he known the particulars, he\nwould never have suffered them to have gone as he did, and at last\nused the very same compliment that the governor at the Havannah used,\nviz., that it was a present fit for a viceroy of Mexico rather than\nfor him.\n\nWhen he had done, he then told me he remembered I had two requests to\nhim, and that one was not to be told till after the first was granted,\nand he hoped now I had something to ask of him that was equal to the\nobligation I laid upon him.\n\nI told him I knew it was not the custom in Spain for a stranger to\nmake presents to the ladies, and that I would not in the least doubt\nbut that, what ever the ladies of his family required as proper for\ntheir use, he would appropriate to them as he thought fit; but that\nthere were two little boxes in the parcel which my wife with her own\nhand had directed to the ladies; and I begged he would be pleased with\nhis own hand to give them in my wife's name, as directed; that I was\nonly the messenger, but that I could not be honest if I did not\ndischarge myself of the trust reposed in me.\n\nThese were the two boxes of ribands and lace, which, knowing the\nnicety of the ladies in Spain, or rather of the Spaniards about their\nwomen, I had made my wife pack up, and directed with her own hand, as\nI have said.\n\nHe smiled, and told me it was true the Spaniards did not ordinarily\nadmit so much freedom among the women as other nations; but he hoped,\nhe said, I would not think the Spaniards thought all their women\nwhores, or that all Spaniards were jealous of their wives; that, as to\nmy present, since he had agreed to accept of it, I should have the\ndirection of what part I pleased to his wife and daughters; for he had\nthree daughters.\n\nHere I strained courtesies again, and told him by no means; I would\ndirect nothing of that kind. I only begged that he would with his own\nhand present to his donna, or lady, the present designed her by my\nwife, and that he would present it in her name, now living in\nVirginia. He was extremely pleased with the nicety I used; and I saw\nhim present it to her accordingly, and could see, at the opening of\nit, that she was extremely pleased with the present itself, as indeed\nmight very well be, for in that country it was worth a very\nconsiderable sum of money.\n\nThough I was used with an uncommon friendship before, and nothing\ncould well be desired more, yet the grateful sense I showed of it in\nthe magnificence of this present was not lost, and the whole family\nappeared sensible of it; so that I must allow that presents, where\nthey can be made in such a manner, are not without their influence,\nwhere the persons were not at all mercenary either before or after.\n\nI had here now a most happy and comfortable retreat, though it was a\nkind of an exile. Here I enjoyed everything I could think of that was\nagreeable and pleasant, except only a liberty of going home, which,\nfor that reason perhaps, was the only thing I desired in the world;\nfor the grief of one absent comfort is oftentimes capable of\nembittering all the other enjoyments in the world.\n\nHere I enjoyed the moments which I had never before known how to\nemploy--I mean that here I learned to look back upon a long ill-spent\nlife, blessed with infinite advantage, which I had no heart given me\ntill now to make use of, and here I found just reflections were the\nutmost felicity of human life.\n\nHere I wrote these memoirs, having to add to the pleasure of looking\nback with due reflections the benefit of a violent fit of the gout,\nwhich, as it is allowed by most people, clears the head, restores the\nmemory, and qualifies us to make the most, and just, and useful\nremarks upon our own actions.\n\nPerhaps when I wrote these things down I did not foresee that the\nwritings of our own stories would be so much the fashion in England,\nor so agreeable to others to read, as I find custom and the humour of\nthe times has caused it to be. If any one that reads my story pleases\nto make the same just reflections which I acknowledge I ought to have\nmade, he will reap the benefit of my misfortunes perhaps more than I\nhave done myself. 'Tis evident by the long series of changes and turns\nwhich have appeared in the narrow compass of one private, mean\nperson's life, that the history of men's lives may be many ways made\nuseful and instructing to those who read them, if moral and religious\nimprovement and reflections are made by those that write them.\n\nThere remains many things in the course of this unhappy life of mine,\nthough I have left so little a part of it to speak of, that is worth\ngiving a large and distinct account of, and which gives room for just\nreflections of a kind which I have not made yet. Particularly, I think\nit just to add how, in collecting the various changes and turns in my\naffairs, I saw clearer than ever I had done before how an invincible\noverruling Power, a hand influenced from above, governs all our\nactions of every kind, limits all our designs, and orders the events\nof everything relating to us.\n\nAnd from this observation it necessarily occurred to me how just it\nwas that we should pay the homage of all events to Him; that as He\nguided, and had even made the chain of cause and consequences, which\nnature in general strictly obeyed, so to Him should be given the\nhonour of all events, the consequences of those causes, as the first\nMover and Maker of all things.\n\nI, who had hitherto lived, as might be truly said, without God in the\nworld, began now to see farther into all those things than I had ever\nyet been capable of before, and this brought me at last to look with\nshame and blushes upon such a course of wickedness as I had gone\nthrough in the world. I had been bred, indeed, to nothing of either\nreligious or moral knowledge. What I gained of either was, first, by\nthe little time of civil life which I lived in Scotland, where my\nabhorrence of the wickedness of my captain and comrade, and some\nsober, religious company I fell into, first gave me some knowledge of\ngood and evil, and showed me the beauty of a sober, religious life,\nthough, with my leaving that country, it soon left me too; or,\nsecondly, the modest hints and just reflections of my steward, whom I\ncalled my tutor, who was a man of sincere religion, good principles,\nand a real, true penitent for his past miscarriages. Oh! had I with\nhim sincerely repented of what was past, I had not for twenty-four\nyears together lived a life of levity and profligate wickedness after\nit.\n\nBut here I had, as I said, leisure to reflect and to repent, to call\nto mind things past, and, with a just detestation, learn, as Job says,\nto abhor myself in dust and ashes.\n\nIt is with this temper that I have written my story. I would have all\nthat design to read it prepare to do so with the temper of penitents,\nand remember with how much advantage they may make their penitent\nreflections at home, under the merciful dispositions of Providence, in\npeace, plenty, and ease, rather than abroad, under the discipline of a\ntransported criminal, as my wife and my tutor, or under the miseries\nand distresses of a shipwrecked wanderer, as my skipper or captain of\nthe sloop, who, as I hear, died a very great penitent, labouring in\nthe deserts and mountains to find his way home to Virginia, by the way\nof Carolina, whither the rest of the crew reached after infinite\ndangers and hardships; or in exile, however favourably circumstanced,\nas mine, in absence from my family, and for some time in no probable\nview of ever seeing them any more.\n\nSuch, I say, may repent with advantage; but how few are they that\nseriously look in till their way is hedged up and they have no other\nway to look!\n\nHere, I say, I had leisure to repent. How far it pleases God to give\nthe grace of repentance where He gives the opportunity of it is not\nfor me to say of myself. It is sufficient that I recommend it to all\nthat read this story, that, when they find their lives come up in any\ndegree to any similitude of cases, they will inquire by me, and ask\nthemselves, Is not this the time to repent? Perhaps the answer may\ntouch them.\n\nI have only to add to what was then written, that my kind friends the\nSpaniards, finding no other method presented for conveying me to my\nhome--that is to say, to Virginia--got a license for me to come in the\nnext galleons, as a Spanish merchant, to Cadiz, where I arrived safe\nwith all my treasure; for he suffered me to be at no expenses in his\nhouse; and from Cadiz I soon got my passage on board an English\nmerchantship for London, from whence I sent an account of my\nadventures to my wife, and where, in about five months more, she came\nover to me, leaving with full satisfaction the management of all our\naffairs in Virginia in the same faithful hands as before.\n\n\n\nEND OF THE LIFE OF COLONEL JACQUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE TRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN\n\n\n\n\nAN EXPLANATORY PREFACE\n\n\nIt is not that I see any reason to alter my opinion in anything I have\nwritten which occasions this epistle, but I find it necessary, for the\nsatisfaction of some persons of honour as well as wit, to pass a short\nexplication upon it, and tell the world what I mean, or rather what I\ndo not mean, in some things wherein I find I am liable to be\nmisunderstood.\n\nI confess myself something surprised to hear that I am taxed with\nbewraying my own nest and abusing our nation by discovering the\nmeanness of our original, in order to make the English contemptible\nabroad and at home; in which I think they are mistaken. For why should\nnot our neighbours be as good as we to derive from? And I must add\nthat, had we been an unmixed nation, I am of opinion it had been to\nour disadvantage. For, to go no further, we have three nations about\nus as clear from mixtures of blood as any in the world, and I know not\nwhich of them I could wish ourselves to be like--I mean the Scots, the\nWelsh, and Irish; and if I were to write a reverse to the satire, I\nwould examine all the nations of Europe, and prove that those nations\nwhich are most mixed are the best, and have least of barbarism and\nbrutality among them; and abundance of reasons might be given for it,\ntoo long to bring into a preface.\n\nBut I give this hint to let the world know that I am far from thinking\nit is a satire upon the English nation to tell them they are derived\nfrom all the nations under heaven--that is, from several nations. Nor\nis it meant to undervalue the original of the English, for we see no\nreason to like them the worse, being the relics of Nomans, Danes,\nSaxons, and Normans, than we should have done if they had remained\nBritons; that is, than if they had been all Welshmen.\n\nBut the intent of the satire is pointed at the vanity of those who\ntalk of their antiquity and value themselves upon their pedigree,\ntheir ancient families, and being true-born; whereas it is impossible\nwe should be true-born, and if we could, should have lost by the\nbargain.\n\nThose sort of people who call themselves true-born and tell long\nstories of their families, and, like a nobleman of Venice, think a\nforeigner ought not to walk on the same side of the street with them,\nare owned to be meant in this satire. What they would infer from their\nown original I know not, nor is it easy to make out whether they are\nthe better or the worse for their ancestors. Our English nation may\nvalue themselves for their wit, wealth, and courage, and I believe\nfew will dispute it with them; but for long originals and ancient\ntrue-born families of English, I would advise them to waive the\ndiscourse. A true Englishman is one that deserves a character, and I\nhave nowhere lessened him that I know of; but as for a true-born\nEnglishman, I confess I do not understand him.\n\nFrom hence I only infer that an Englishman, of all men, ought not to\ndespise foreigners as such, and I think the inference is just, since\nwhat they are to-day we were yesterday, and to-morrow they will be\nlike us. If foreigners misbehave in their several stations and\nemployments, I have nothing to do with that; the laws are open to\npunish them equally with natives, and let them have no favour.\n\nBut when I see the town full of lampoons and invectives against\nDutchmen only because they are foreigners, and the King reproached and\ninsulted by insolent pedants and ballad-making poets for employing\nforeigners, and for being a foreigner himself, I confess myself moved\nby it to remind our nation of their own original, thereby to let them\nsee what a banter is put upon ourselves in it, since, speaking of\nEnglishmen _ab origine_, we are really foreigners ourselves.\n\nI could go on to prove it is also impolitic in us to discourage\nforeigners, since it is easy to make it appear that the multitudes of\nforeign nations who have taken sanctuary here have been the greatest\nadditions to the wealth and strength of the nation, the great\nessential whereof is the number of its in habitants. Nor would this\nnation have ever arrived to the degree of wealth and glory it now\nboasts of if the addition of foreign nations, both as to manufactures\nand arms, had not been helpful to it. This is so plain that he who is\nignorant of it is too dull to be talked with.\n\nThe satire, therefore, I must allow to be just till I am otherwise\nconvinced, because nothing can be more ridiculous than to hear our\npeople boast of that antiquity which, if it had been true, would have\nleft us in so much worse a condition than we are in now; whereas we\nought rather to boast among our neighbours that we are a part of\nthemselves, or the same original as they, but bettered by our climate,\nand, like our language and manufactures, derived from them and\nimproved by us to a perfection greater than they can pretend to.\n\nThis we might have valued ourselves upon without vanity; but to disown\nour descent from them, talking big of our ancient families and long\noriginals, and stand at a distance from foreigners, like the\nenthusiast in religion, with a \"Stand off; I am more holy than\nthou!\"--this is a thing so ridiculous in a nation, derived from\nforeigners as we are, that I could not but attack them as I have done.\n\nAnd whereas I am threatened to be called to a public account for this\nfreedom, and the publisher of this has been new-papered in gaol\nalready for it, though I see nothing in it for which the Government\ncan be displeased, yet if at the same time those people who, with an\nunlimited arrogance in print, every day affront the King, prescribe\nthe Parliament, and lampoon the Government may be either punished or\nrestrained, I am content to stand and fall with the public justice of\nmy native country which I am not sensible I have anywhere injured.\n\nNor would I be misunderstood concerning the clergy, with whom, if I\nhave taken any license more than becomes a satire, I question not but\nthose gentlemen, who are men of letters, are also men of so much\ncandour as to allow me a loose at the crimes of the guilty without\nthinking the whole profession lashed, who are innocent. I profess to\nhave very mean thoughts of those gentlemen who have deserted their own\nprinciples, and exposed even their morals as well as loyalty, but not\nat all to think it affects any but such as are concerned in the fact.\n\nNor would I be misrepresented as to the ingratitude of the English to\nthe King and his friends, as if I meant the English as a nation are\nso. The contrary is so apparent, that I would hope it should not be\nsuggested of me; and, therefore, when I have brought in Britannia\nspeaking of the King, I suppose her to be the representative or mouth\nof the nation as a body. But if I say we are full of such who daily\naffront the King and abuse his friends, who print scurrilous\npamphlets, virulent lampoons, and reproachful public banter against\nboth the King's person and Government, I say nothing but what is too\ntrue. And that the satire is directed at such I freely own, and cannot\nsay but I should think it very hard to be censured for this satire\nwhile such remain unquestioned and tacitly approved. That I can mean\nnone but such is plain from these few lines:--\n\n\n    \"Ye Heavens, regard! Almighty Jove, look down,\n     And view thy injured monarch on the throne.\n     On their ungrateful heads due vengeance take\n     Who sought his aid and then his part forsake.\"\n\n\nIf I have fallen upon our vices, I hope none but the vicious will be\nangry. As for writing for interest, I disown it. I have neither place,\nnor pension, nor prospect; nor seek none, nor will have none. If\nmatter of fact justifies the truth of the crimes, the satire is just.\nAs to the poetic liberties, I hope the crime is pardonable. I am\ncontent to be stoned provided none will attack me but the innocent.\n\nIf my countrymen would take the hint and grow better-natured from my\nill-natured poem, as some call it, I would say this of it, that though\nit is far from the best satire that ever was written, it would do the\nmost good that ever satire did.\n\nAnd yet I am ready to ask pardon of some gentlemen too, who, though\nthey are Englishmen, have good-nature enough to see themselves\nreproved, and can bear it. Those are gentlemen in a true sense that\ncan bear to be told of their _faux pas_ and not abuse the reprover. To\nsuch I must say this is no satire; they are exceptions to the general\nrule; and I value my performance from their generous approbation more\nthan I can from any opinion I have of its worth.\n\nThe hasty errors of my verse I made my excuse for before; and since\nthe time I have been upon it has been but little, and my leisure less,\nI have all along strove rather to make the thoughts explicit than the\npoem correct. However, I have mended some faults in this edition, and\nthe rest must be placed to my account.\n\nAs to answers, banters, true English Billingsgate, I expect them\ntill nobody will buy, and then the shop will be shut. Had I wrote it\nfor the gain of the press, I should have been concerned at its\nbeing printed again and again by pirates, as they call them, and\nparagraph-men; but would they but do it justice and print it true\naccording to the copy, they are welcome to sell it for a penny if they\nplease.\n\nThe pence indeed is the end of their works. I will engage, if nobody\nwill buy, nobody will write. And not a patriot-poet of them all now\nwill, in defence of his native country--which I have abused, they\nsay--print an answer to it, and give it about for God's sake.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PREFACE\n\n\nThe end of satire is reformation; and the author, though he doubts the\nwork of conversion is at a general stop, has put his hand to the\nplough.\n\nI expect a storm of ill language from the fury of the town, and\nespecially from those whose English talent it is to rail. And without\nbeing taken for a conjuror, I may venture to foretell that I shall be\ncavilled at about my mean style, rough verse, and incorrect language;\nthings I might indeed have taken more care in, but the book is\nprinted; and though I see some faults, it is too late to mend them.\nAnd this is all I think needful to say to them.\n\nPossibly somebody may take me for a Dutchman, in which they are\nmistaken. But I am one that would be glad to see Englishmen behave\nthemselves better to strangers and to governors also, that one might\nnot be reproached in foreign countries for belonging to a nation that\nwants manners.\n\nI assure you, gentlemen, strangers use us better abroad; and we can\ngive no reason but our ill-nature for the contrary here.\n\nMethinks an Englishman, who is so proud of being called a good fellow,\nshould be civil; and it cannot be denied but we are in many cases, and\nparticularly to strangers, the churlishest people alive.\n\nAs to vices, who can dispute our intemperance, while an honest drunken\nfellow is a character in a man's praise? All our reformations are\nbanters, and will be so till our magistrates and gentry reform\nthemselves by way of example. Then, and not till then, they may be\nexpected to punish others without blushing.\n\nAs to our ingratitude, I desire to be understood of that particular\npeople who, pretending to be Protestants, have all along endeavoured\nto reduce the liberties and religion of this nation into the hands of\nKing James and his Popish Powers; together with such who enjoy the\npeace and protection of the present Government, and yet abuse and\naffront the King, who procured it, and openly profess their uneasiness\nunder him. These, by whatsoever names or titles they are dignified or\ndistinguished, are the people aimed at; nor do I disown but that it is\nso much the temper of an Englishman to abuse his benefactor that I\ncould be glad to see it rectified.\n\nThose who think I have been guilty of any error in exposing the crimes\nof my own countrymen to themselves may, among many honest instances of\nthe like nature, find the same thing in Mr. Cowley, in his imitation\nof the second Olympic ode of Pindar. His words are these--\n\n\n    \"But in this thankless world the givers\n       Are envied even by the receivers:\n     'Tis now the cheap and frugal fashion\n     Rather to hide than pay an obligation.\n       Nay, 'tis much worse than so;\n       It now an artifice doth grow\n       Wrongs and outrages to do,\n     Lest men should think we owe.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE INTRODUCTION\n\n\n   Speak, Satire; for there's none can tell like thee\n   Whether 'tis folly, pride, or knavery\n   That makes this discontented land appear\n   Less happy now in times of peace than war?\n   Why civil feuds disturb the nation more\n   Than all our bloody wars have done before?\n     Fools out of favour grudge at knaves in place\n   And men are always honest in disgrace:\n   The Court preferments make men knaves in course;\n   But they which would be in them would be worse.\n   'Tis not at foreigners that we repine,\n   Would foreigners their perquisites resign:\n   The grand contention 's plainly to be seen,\n   To get some men put out, and some put in.\n   For this our Senators make long harangues,\n   And florid Members whet their polished tongues.\n   Statesmen are always sick of one disease,\n   And a good pension gives them present ease:\n   That's the specific makes them all content\n   With any King and any Government.\n   Good patriots at Court abuses rail,\n   And all the nation's grievances bewail;\n   But when the sovereign balsam's once applied,\n   The zealot never fails to change his side;\n   And when he must the golden key resign,\n   The railing spirit comes about again.\n     Who shall this bubbled nation disabuse,\n   While they their own felicities refuse,\n   Who at the wars have made such mighty pother,\n   And now are falling out with one another:\n   With needless fears the jealous nation fill,\n   And always have been saved against their will:\n   Who fifty millions sterling have disbursed,\n   To be with peace and too much plenty cursed:\n   Who their old monarch eagerly undo,\n   And yet uneasily obey the new?\n   Search, Satire, search: a deep incision make;\n   The poison's strong, the antidote's too weak.\n   'Tis pointed Truth must manage this dispute,\n   And downright English, Englishmen confute.\n     Whet thy just anger at the nation's pride,\n   And with keen phrase repel the vicious tide;\n   To Englishmen their own beginnings show,\n   And ask them why they slight their neighbours so.\n   Go back to elder times and ages past,\n   And nations into long oblivion cast;\n   To old Britannia's youthful days retire,\n   And there for true-born Englishmen inquire.\n   Britannia freely will disown the name,\n   And hardly knows herself from whence they came\n   Wonders that they of all men should pretend\n   To birth and blood, and for a name contend.\n   Go back to causes where our follies dwell,            |\n   And fetch the dark original from hell:                 >\n   Speak, Satire, for there's none like thee can tell.   |\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE\nTRUE-BORN ENGLISHMAN\n\n\n\n\nPART I\n\n\n   Wherever God erects a house of prayer,\n   The Devil always builds a chapel there:[11]\n   And 'twill be found upon examination,\n   The latter has the largest congregation:\n   For ever since he first debauched the mind,\n   He made a perfect conquest of mankind.\n   With uniformity of service, he\n   Reigns with a general aristocracy.\n   No non-conforming sects disturb his reign,\n   For of his yoke there's very few complain.\n   He knows the genius and the inclination,\n   And matches proper sins for every nation,\n   He needs no standing-army government;\n   He always rules us by our own consent:\n   His laws are easy, and his gentle sway\n   Makes it exceeding pleasant to obey:\n   The list of his vicegerents and commanders,\n   Outdoes your C\u00c3\u00a6sars or your Alexanders.\n   They never fail of his infernal aid,\n   And he's as certain ne'er to be betrayed.\n   Through all the world they spread his vast command,\n   And Death's eternal empire is maintained.\n   They rule so politicly and so well,\n   As if they were Lords Justices of Hell,\n   Duly divided to debauch mankind,\n   And plant infernal dictates in his mind.\n     Pride, the first peer, and president of Hell,\n   To his share Spain, the largest province, fell.\n   The subtile Prince thought fittest to bestow\n   On these the golden mines of Mexico,\n   With all the silver mountains of Peru,\n   Wealth which would in wise hands the world undo:\n   Because he knew their genius was such,\n   Too lazy and too haughty to be rich.\n   So proud a people, so above their fate,\n   That if reduced to beg, they'll beg in state;\n   Lavish of money to be counted brave,\n   And proudly starve because they scorn to save.\n   Never was nation in the world before\n   So very rich and yet so very poor.\n     Lust chose the torrid zone of Italy,\n   Where blood ferments in rapes and sodomy:\n   Where swelling veins overflow with liquid streams,\n   With heat impregnate from Vesuvian flames:\n   Whose flowing sulphur forms infernal lakes,\n   And human body of the soil partakes.\n   Their nature ever burns with hot desires,\n   Fanned with luxuriant air from subterranean fires;\n   Here, undisturbed in floods of scalding lust,\n   The Infernal King reigns with infernal gust.\n     Drunkenness, the darling favourite of Hell,\n   Chose Germany to rule; and rules so well,\n   No subjects more obsequiously obey,\n   None please so well or are so pleased as they.\n   The cunning artist manages so well,\n   He lets them bow to Heaven and drink to Hell.\n   If but to wine and him they homage pay,           |\n   He cares not to what deity they pray,              >\n   What God they worship most, or in what way.       |\n   Whether by Luther, Calvin, or by Rome\n   They sail for Heaven, by Wine he steers them home.\n     Ungoverned Passion settled first in France,\n   Where mankind lives in haste and thrives by chance;\n   A dancing nation, fickle and untrue,\n   Have oft undone themselves and others too;\n   Prompt the infernal dictates to obey,\n   And in Hell's favour none more great than they.\n     The Pagan world he blindly leads away,\n   And personally rules with arbitrary sway;\n   The mask thrown off, plain Devil his title stands,\n   And what elsewhere he tempts he there commands.\n   There with full gust the ambition of his mind\n   Governs, as he of old in Heaven designed.\n   Worshipped as God, his Paynim altars smoke,\n   Embrued with blood of those that him invoke.\n     The rest by Deputies he rules as well,\n   And plants the distant colonies of Hell.\n   By them his secret power he maintains,\n   And binds the world in his infernal chains.\n     By Zeal the Irish, and the Russ by Folly\n   Fury the Dane, the Swede by Melancholy;\n   By stupid Ignorance the Muscovite;\n   The Chinese by a child of Hell called Wit\n   Wealth makes the Persian too effeminate,\n   And Poverty the Tartars desperate;\n   The Turks and Moors by Mah'met he subdues,\n   And God has given him leave to rule the Jews.\n   Rage rules the Portuguese and Fraud the Scotch,\n   Revenge the Pole and Avarice the Dutch.\n     Satire, be kind, and draw a silent veil\n   Thy native England's vices to conceal;\n   Or, if that task's impossible to do,            |\n   At least be just and show her virtues too--       >\n   Too great the first; alas, the last too few!     |\n     England, unknown as yet, unpeopled lay;        |\n   Happy had she remained so to this day,            >\n   And not to every nation been a prey.             |\n   Her open harbours and her fertile plains\n   (The merchant's glory those, and these the swain's)\n   To every barbarous nation have betrayed her,\n   Who conquer her as oft as they invade her;\n   So beauty's guarded but by innocence,\n   That ruins her, which should be her defence.\n     Ingratitude, a devil of black renown,\n   Possessed her very early for his own.\n   An ugly, surly, sullen, selfish spirit,\n   Who Satan's worst perfections does inherit;\n   Second to him in malice and in force,\n   All devil without, and all within him worse.\n   He made her first-born race to be so rude,\n   And suffered her so oft to be subdued;\n   By several crowds of wandering thieves o'errun,\n   Often unpeopled, and as oft undone;\n   While every nation that her powers reduced\n   Their languages and manners introduced.\n   From whose mixed relics our compounded breed\n   By spurious generation does succeed,\n   Making a race uncertain and uneven,\n   Derived from all the nations under Heaven.\n     The Romans first with Julius C\u00c3\u00a6sar came,\n   Including all the nations of that name,\n   Gauls, Greeks, and Lombards, and, by computation\n   Auxiliaries or slaves of every nation.\n   With Hengist, Saxons; Danes with Sueno came,\n   In search of plunder, not in search of fame.\n   Scots, Picts, and Irish from the Hibernian shore,\n   And conquering William brought the Normans o'er.\n     All these their barbarous offspring left behind,\n   The dregs of armies, they of all mankind;\n   Blended with Britons, who before were here,\n   Of whom the Welsh ha' blessed the character.\n     From this amphibious ill-born mob began\n   That vain, ill-natured thing, an Englishman.\n   The customs, surnames, languages, and manners\n   Of all these nations are their own explainers:\n   Whose relics are so lasting and so strong,\n   They ha' left a shibboleth upon our tongue,\n   By which with easy search you may distinguish\n   Your Roman-Saxon-Danish Norman English.\n   The great invading Norman[12] let us know\n   What conquerors in after times might do.\n   To every musketeer[13] he brought to town,\n   He gave the lands which never were his own.\n   When first the English crown he did obtain,\n   He did not send his Dutchmen back again.\n   No reassumptions in his reign were known,\n   D'Avenant might there ha' let his book alone.\n   No Parliament his army could disband;\n   He raised no money, for he paid in land.\n   He gave his legions their eternal station,\n   And made them all freeholders of the nation.\n   He cantoned out the country to his men,\n   And every soldier was a denizen.\n   The rascals thus enriched, he called them lords,      |\n   To please their upstart pride with new-made words,     >\n   And Doomsday Book his tyranny records.                |\n     And here begins our ancient pedigree,\n   That so exalts our poor nobility:\n   'Tis that from some French trooper they derive,\n   Who with the Norman bastard did arrive;\n   The trophies of the families appear,                |\n   Some show the sword, the bow, and some the spear,    >\n   Which their great ancestor, forsooth, did wear.     |\n   These in the herald's register remain,\n   Their noble mean extraction to explain,\n   Yet who the hero was, no man can tell,\n   Whether a drummer or a colonel:\n   The silent record blushes to reveal\n   Their undescended dark original.\n     But grant the best, how came the change to pass,\n   A true-born Englishman of Norman race?\n   A Turkish horse can show more history\n   To prove his well-descended family.\n   Conquest, as by the moderns[14] 'tis expressed,\n   May give a title to the lands possessed:\n   But that the longest sword should be so civil\n   To make a Frenchman English, that's the devil.\n     These are the heroes that despise the Dutch,\n   And rail at new-come foreigners so much,\n   Forgetting that themselves are all derived\n   From the most scoundrel race that ever lived;\n   A horrid crowd of rambling thieves and drones,\n   Who ransacked kingdoms and dispeopled towns,\n   The Pict and painted Briton, treacherous Scot,\n   By hunger, theft, and rapine hither brought;\n   Norwegian pirates, buccaneering Danes,\n   Whose red-haired offspring everywhere remains,\n   Who, joined with Norman-French, compound the breed\n   From whence your true-born Englishmen proceed.\n     And lest by length of time it be pretended\n   The climate may this modern breed ha' mended,\n   Wise Providence, to keep us where we are,\n   Mixes us daily with exceeding care.\n   We have been Europe's sink, the jakes where she\n   Voids all her offal outcast progeny.\n   From the eighth Henry's time, the strolling bands\n   Of banished fugitives from neighbouring lands\n   Have here a certain sanctuary found:\n   The eternal refuge of the vagabond,\n   Where, in but half a common age of time,\n   Borrowing new blood and manners from the clime,\n   Proudly they learn all mankind to contemn,\n   And all their race are true-born Englishmen.\n     Dutch, Walloons, Flemings, Irishmen, and Scots,\n   Vaudois and Valtelins, and Hugonots,\n   In good Queen Bess's charitable reign,\n   Supplied us with three hundred thousand men.\n   Religion--God, we thank Thee!--sent them hither\n   Priests, Protestants, the Devil and all together:\n   Of all professions and of every trade,\n   All that were persecuted or afraid;\n   Whether for debt or other crimes they fled,\n   David at Hachilah was still their head.\n     The offspring of this miscellaneous crowd\n   Had not their new plantations long enjoyed,\n   But they grew Englishmen, and raised their votes\n   At foreign shoals for interloping Scots.\n   The royal branch[15] from Pictland did succeed,\n   With troops of Scots and Scabs from North-by-Tweed.\n   The seven first years of his pacific reign\n   Made him and half his nation Englishmen.\n   Scots from the northern frozen banks of Tay,\n   With packs and plods came whigging all away:\n   Thick as the locusts which in Egypt swarmed,\n   With pride and hungry hopes completely armed;\n   With native truth, diseases, and no money,\n   Plundered our Canaan of the milk and honey.\n   Here they grew quickly lords and gentlemen,\n   And all their race are true-born Englishmen.\n     The civil wars, the common purgative,\n   Which always use to make the nation thrive,\n   Made way for all that strolling congregation\n   Which thronged in Pious Charles's restoration.[16]\n   The royal refugee our breed restores,\n   With foreign courtiers and with foreign whores,\n   And carefully repeopled us again,\n   Throughout his lazy, long, lascivious reign,\n   With such a blest and true-born English fry,\n   As much illustrates our nobility.\n   A gratitude which will so black appear,\n   As future ages must abhor to hear,\n   When they look back on all that crimson flood,\n   Which streamed in Lindsay's and Carnarvon's blood,\n   Bold Strafford, Cambridge, Capel, Lucas, Lisle,\n   Who crowned in death his father's funeral pile.\n   The loss of whom, in order to supply,\n   With true-born English nationality,\n   Six bastard Dukes survive his luscious reign,\n   The labours of Italian Castlemaine,[17]\n   French Portsmouth,[18] Tabby Scot, and Cambrian.\n   Besides the numerous bright and virgin throng,\n   Whose female glories shade them from my song.\n     This offspring, if one age they multiply,\n   May half the house with English peers supply;\n   There with true English pride they may contemn\n   Schomberg and Portland,[19] new made noblemen.\n     French cooks, Scotch pedlars, and Italian whores,\n   Were all made lords or lords' progenitors.\n   Beggars and bastards by his new creation\n   Much multiplied the peerage of the nation;\n   Who will be all, ere one short age runs o'er.\n   As true-born lords as those we had before.\n     Then to recruit the Commons he prepares\n   And heal the latent breaches of the wars;\n   The pious purpose better to advance,\n   He invites the banished Protestants of France:\n   Hither for God's sake and their own they fled,\n   Some for religion came, and some for bread;\n   Two hundred thousand pairs of wooden shoes,\n   Who, God be thanked, had nothing left to lose,\n   To Heaven's great praise did for religion fly,\n   To make us starve our poor in charity.\n   In every port they plant their fruitful train,\n   To get a race of true-born Englishmen;\n   Whose children will, when riper years they see,\n   Be as ill-natured and as proud as we;\n   Call themselves English, foreigners despise,\n   Be surly like us all, and just as wise.\n     Thus from a mixture of all kinds began\n   That heterogeneous thing an Englishman;\n   In eager rapes and furious lust begot,\n   Betwixt a painted Briton and a Scot;\n   Whose gendering offspring quickly learned to bow,\n   And yoke their heifers to the Roman plough;\n   From whence a mongrel half-bred race there came,\n   With neither name nor nation, speech nor fame;\n   In whose hot veins new mixtures quickly ran,\n   Infused betwixt a Saxon and a Dane;\n   While their rank daughters, to their parents just,\n   Received all nations with promiscuous lust.\n   This nauseous brood directly did contain\n   The well-extracted brood of Englishmen.\n     Which medley cantoned in a Heptarchy,\n   A rhapsody of nations to supply,\n   Among themselves maintained eternal wars,\n   And still the ladies loved the conquerors.\n   The Western Angles all the rest subdued,\n   A bloody nation, barbarous and rude,\n   Who by the tenure of the sword possessed\n   One part of Britain, and subdued the rest.\n   And as great things denominate the small,\n   The conquering part gave title to the whole;\n   The Scot, Pict, Briton, Roman, Dane, submit,\n   And with the English-Saxon all unite;\n   And these the mixtures have so close pursued,\n   The very name and memory's subdued.\n   No Roman now, no Briton does remain;\n   Wales strove to separate, but strove in vain;\n   The silent nations undistinguished fall,\n   And Englishman's the common name of all.\n   Fate jumbled them together, God knows how;\n   What e'er they were, they're true-born English now.\n     The wonder which remains is at our pride,\n   To value that which all men else deride.\n   For Englishmen to boast of generation\n   Cancels their knowledge and lampoons the nation.\n   A true-born Englishman's a contradiction,\n   In speech an irony, in fact a fiction;\n   A banter made to be a test to fools,\n   Which those that use it justly ridicules;\n   A metaphor invented to express\n   A man akin to all the universe.\n     For, as the Scots, as learned men have said,\n   Throughout the world their wandering seed have spread;\n   So open-handed England, 'tis believed,\n   Has all the gleanings of the world received.\n     Some think of England, 'twas our Saviour meant,\n   The Gospel should to all the world be sent,\n   Since, when the blessed sound did hither reach,\n   They to all nations might be said to preach.\n     'Tis well that virtue gives nobility,\n   How shall we else the want of birth and blood supply?\n   Since scarce one family is left alive\n   Which does not from some foreigner derive.\n   Of sixty thousand English gentlemen,\n   Whose name and arms in registers remain,\n   We challenge all our heralds to declare\n   Ten families which English-Saxons are.\n     France justly owns the ancient noble line\n   Of Bourbon, Montmorency, and Lorraine,\n   The Germans too their House of Austria show\n   And Holland their invincible Nassau,\n   Lines which in heraldry were ancient grown\n   Before the name of Englishman was known.\n   Even Scotland, too, her elder glory shows,\n   Her Gordons, Hamiltons, and her Monros,\n   Douglas, Mackays, and Grahams, names well known\n   Long before ancient England knew her own.\n     But England, modern to the last degree            |\n   Borrows or makes her own nobility,                   >\n   And yet she boldly boasts of pedigree;              |\n   Repines that foreigners are put upon her,\n   And talks of her antiquity and honour;\n   Her Sackvilles, Saviles, Capels, De la Meres,             |\n   Mohuns, and Montagues, Darcys, and Veres,                  >\n   Not one have English names, yet all are English peers.    |\n   Your Hermans, Papillons, and Lavalliers                   |\n   Pass now for true-born English knights and squires,        >\n   And make good senate members or Lord Mayors.              |\n   Wealth, howsoever got, in Ehgland makes\n   Lords of mechanics, gentlemen of rakes:\n   Antiquity and birth are needless here;\n   'Tis impudence and money makes a peer.\n     Innumerable City knights, we know,\n   From Bluecoat Hospital and Bridewell flow;\n   Draymen and porters fill the city Chair\n   And footboys magisterial purple wear.\n   Fate has but very small distinction set\n   Betwixt the counter and the coronet.\n   Tarpaulin lords, pages of high renown,\n   Rise up by poor men's valour, not their own.\n   Great families of yesterday we show,\n   And lords whose parents were the Lord knows who.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n   The breed's described: Now, Satire, if you can,\n   Their temper show, for manners make the man.\n   Fierce, as the Briton; as the Roman, brave;\n   And less inclined to conquer than to save;\n   Eager to fight, and lavish of their blood,\n   And equally of fear and forecast void.\n   The Pict has made 'em sour, the Dane morose;\n   False from the Scot, and from the Norman worse.\n   What honesty they have, the Saxons gave them,\n   And that, now they grow old, begins to leave them.\n   The climate makes them terrible and bold,\n   And English beef their courage does uphold;\n   No danger can their daring spirit pall,\n   Always provided that their belly's full.\n     In close intrigues their faculty's but weak,\n   For generally what e'er they know they speak,\n   And often their own counsels undermine\n   By their infirmity, and not design;\n   From whence the learned say it does proceed,\n   That English treasons never can succeed;\n   For they're so open-hearted, you may know\n   Their own most secret thoughts, and others too.\n     The laboring poor, in spite of double pay,\n   Are saucy, mutinous, and beggarly,\n   So lavish of their money and their time,\n   That want of forecast is the nation's crime.\n   Good drunken company is their delight,\n   And what they get by day they spend by night.\n   Dull thinking seldom does their heads engage,\n   But drink their youth away, and hurry on old age.\n   Empty of all good husbandry and sense,\n   And void of manners most when void of pence,\n   Their strong aversion to behaviour's such,\n   They always talk too little or too much;\n   So dull, they never take the pains to think,\n   And seldom are good-natured, but in drink.\n     In English ale their dear enjoyment lies,\n   For which they'll starve themselves and families.\n   An Englishman will fairly drink as much\n   As will maintain two families of Dutch:\n   Subjecting all their labour to their pots;\n   The greatest artists are the greatest sots.\n     The country poor do by example live;\n   The gentry lead them, and the clergy drive:\n   What may we not from such examples hope?\n   The landlord is their god, the priest their pope.\n   A drunken clergy and a swearing bench\n   Has given the Reformation such a drench,\n   As wise men think there is some cause to doubt\n   Will purge good manners and religion out.\n     Nor do the poor alone their liquor prize;\n   The sages join in this great sacrifice;\n   The learned men who study Aristotle,\n   Correct him with an explanation bottle;\n   Praise Epicurus rather than Lysander,\n   And Aristippus[20] more than Alexander.\n   The doctors, too, their Galen here resign,\n   And generally prescribe specific wine;\n   The graduate's study's grown an easier task,\n   While for the urinal they toss the flask;\n   The surgeon's art grows plainer every hour,\n   And wine's the balm which into wounds they pour.\n   Poets long since Parnassus have forsaken,\n   And say the ancient bards were all mistaken.\n   Apollo's lately abdicate and fled,\n   And good King Bacchus governs in his stead;\n   He does the chaos of the head refine,\n   And atom-thoughts jump into words by wine:\n   The inspirations of a finer nature,\n   As wine must needs excel Parnassus' water.\n     Statesmen their weighty politics refine,\n   And soldiers raise their courages by wine;\n   Cecilia gives her choristers their choice,\n   And lets them all drink wine to clear their voice.\n     Some think the clergy first found out the way,\n   And wine's the only spirit by which they pray;\n   But others, less profane than so, agree\n   It clears the lungs and helps the memory;\n   And therefore all of them divinely think,\n   Instead of study, 'tis as well to drink.\n     And here I would be very glad to know\n   Whether our Asgilites may drink or no;\n   Th' enlight'ning fumes of wine would certainly\n   Assist them much when they begin to fly;\n   Or if a fiery chariot should appear,\n   Inflamed by wine, they'd have the less to fear.\n   Even the gods themselves, as mortals say,\n   Were they on earth, would be as drunk as they;\n   Nectar would be no more celestial drink,\n   They'd all take wine, to teach them how to think.\n   But English drunkards gods and men outdo,\n   Drink their estates away, and money too.\n   Colon's in debt, and if his friends should fail\n   To help him out, must die at at last in gaol;\n   His wealthy uncle sent a hundred nobles\n   To pay his trifles off, and rid him of his troubles;\n   But Colon, like a true-born Englishman,               |\n   Drank all the money out in bright champagne,           >\n   And Colon does in custody remain.                     |\n   Drunk'ness has been the darling of this realm\n   E'er since a drunken pilot had the helm.\n     In their religion they are so uneven,\n   That each man goes his own by-way to Heaven,\n   Tenacious of mistakes to that degree                  |\n   That ev'ry man pursues it separately,                  >\n   And fancies none can find the way but he:             |\n   So shy of one another they are grown,\n   As if they strove to get to Heaven alone.\n   Rigid and zealous, positive and grave,\n   And ev'ry grace but Charity they have.\n   This makes them so ill-natured and uncivil,\n   That all men think an Englishman the devil.\n     Surly to strangers, froward to their friend;           |\n   Submit to love with a reluctant mind.                     >\n   Resolved to be ungrateful and unkind,                    |\n   If by necessity reduced to ask,\n   The giver has the difficultest task;\n   For what's bestowed they awkwardly receive,\n   And always take less freely than they give.\n   The obligation is their highest grief,\n   And never love where they accept relief.\n   So sullen in their sorrow, that 'tis known\n   They'll rather die than their afflictions own;\n   And if relieved, it is too often true\n   That they'll abuse their benefactors too;\n   For in distress, their haughty stomach's such,\n   They hate to see themselves obliged too much.\n   Seldom contented, often in the wrong,\n   Hard to be pleased at all, and never long.\n     If your mistakes their ill opinion gain,\n   No merit can their favour reobtain;\n   And if they're not vindictive in their fury,\n   'Tis their unconstant temper does secure ye.\n   Their brain's so cool, their passion seldom burns,\n   For all's condensed before the flame returns;\n   The fermentation's of so weak a matter,\n   The humid damps the fume, and runs it all to water.\n   So, though the inclination may be strong,\n   They're pleased by fits, and never angry long.\n\n     Then, if good-nature shows some slender proof,\n   They never think they have reward enough,\n   But, like our modern Quakers of the town,\n   Expect your manners, and return you none.\n     Friendship, th' abstracted union of the mind,\n   Which all men seek, but very few can find:\n   Of all the nations in the universe,\n   None talk on't more, or understand it less;\n   For if it does their property annoy,\n   Their property their friendship will destroy.\n     As you discourse them, you shall hear them tell\n   All things in which they think they do excel.\n   No panegyric needs their praise record;\n   An Englishman ne'er wants his own good word.\n   His long discourses generally appear\n   Prologued with his own wond'rous character.\n   But first to illustrate his own good name,\n   He never fails his neighbour to defame;\n   And yet he really designs no wrong--\n   His malice goes no further than his tongue.\n   But pleased to tattle, he delights to rail,\n   To satisfy the lech'ry of a tale.\n   His own dear praises close the ample speech;\n   Tells you how wise he is--that is, how rich:\n   For wealth is wisdom; he that's rich is wise;\n   And all men learned poverty despise.\n   His generosity comes next, and then\n   Concludes that he's a true-born Englishman;\n   And they, 'tis known, are generous and free,\n   Forgetting and forgiving injury:\n   Which may be true, thus rightly understood,\n   Forgiving ill turns, and forgetting good.\n     Cheerful in labour when they've undertook it,\n   But out of humour when they're out of pocket.\n   But if their belly and their pocket's full,\n   They may be phlegmatic, but never dull:\n   And if a bottle does their brains refine,\n   It makes their wit as sparkling as their wine.\n     As for the general vices which we find\n   They're guilty of, in common with mankind,\n   Satire, forbear, and silently endure;\n   We must conceal the crimes we cannot cure.\n   Nor shall my verse the brighter sex defame,\n   For English beauty will preserve her name,\n   Beyond dispute, agreeable and fair,\n   And modester than other nations are:\n   For where the vice prevails, the great temptation\n   Is want of money more than inclination.\n   In general, this only is allowed,\n   They're something noisy, and a little proud.\n     An Englishman is gentlest in command,\n   Obedience is a stranger in the land:\n   Hardly subjected to the magistrate,\n   For Englishmen do all subjection hate;\n   Humblest when rich, but peevish when they're poor,\n   And think, what e'er they have, they merit more.\n     The meanest English ploughman studies law,\n   And keeps thereby the magistrates in awe;\n  Will boldly tell them what they have to do,\n   And sometimes punish their omissions too.\n     Their liberty and property's so dear,\n   They scorn their laws or governors to fear:\n   So bugbeared with the name of slavery,\n   They can't submit to their own liberty.\n   Restraint from ill is freedom to the wise;\n   But Englishmen do all restraint despise.\n   Slaves to their liquor, drudges to the pots,\n   The mob are statesmen and their statesmen sots.\n     Their governors they count such dangerous things,\n   That 'tis their custom to affront their kings:\n   So jealous of the power their kings possest,\n   They suffer neither power nor king to rest.\n   The bad with force they easily subdue:\n   The good with constant clamours they pursue;\n   And did King Jesus reign, they'd murmur too.\n   A discontented nation, and by far\n   Harder to rule in times of peace than war:\n   Easily set together by the ears,\n   And full of causeless jealousies and fears:\n   Apt to revolt, and willing to rebel,\n   And never are contented when they're well.\n   No Government could ever please them long,\n   Could tie their hands, or rectify their tongue:\n   In this to ancient Israel well compared,\n   Eternal murmurs are among them heard.\n     It was but lately that they were oppressed,\n   Their rights invaded, and their laws suppressed:\n   When nicely tender of their liberty,\n   Lord! what a noise they made of slavery.\n   In daily tumult showed their discontent,\n   Lampooned the King, and mocked his Government.\n   And if in arms they did not first appear,\n   'Twas want of force, and not for want of fear.\n   In humbler tone than English used to do,\n   At foreign hands for foreign aid they sue.\n     William, the great successor of Nassau,\n   Their prayers heard and their oppressions saw:\n   He saw and saved them; God and him they praised,\n   To this their thanks, to that their trophies raised.\n   But, glutted with their own felicities,\n   They soon their new deliverer despise;\n   Say all their prayers back, their joy disown,\n   Unsing their thanks, and pull their trophies down;\n   Their harps of praise are on the willows hung,\n   For Englishmen are ne'er contented long.\n     The reverend clergy, too! Who would have thought       |\n   That they, who had such non-resistance taught,            >\n   Should e'er to arms against their prince be brought,     |\n\n   Who up to Heaven did regal power advance,\n   Subjecting English laws to modes of France,\n   Twisting religion so with loyalty,\n   As one could never live and t'other die.\n   And yet no sooner did their prince design\n   Their glebes and perquisites to undermine,\n   But, all their passive doctrines laid aside,\n   The clergy their own principles denied;\n   Unpreached their non-resisting cant, and prayed\n   To Heaven for help and to the Dutch for aid.\n   The Church chimed all her doctrines back again,\n   And pulpit champions did the cause maintain;\n   Flew in the face of all their former zeal,\n   And non-resistance did at once repeal.\n     The Rabbis say it would be too prolix\n   To tie religion up to politics:\n   The Church's safety is _suprema lex_.\n   And so, by a new figure of their own,\n   Their former doctrines all at once disown;\n   As laws _post facto_ in the Parliament\n   In urgent cases have obtained assent,\n   But are as dangerous precedents laid by,\n   Made lawful only by necessity.\n     The reverend fathers then in arms appear,\n   And men of God become the men of war.\n   The nation, fired by them, to arms apply,\n   Assault their Antichristian monarchy;\n   To their due channel all our laws restore,\n   And made things what they should have been before.\n   But when they came to fill the vacant throne,\n   And the pale priests looked back on what they'd done;\n   How English liberty began to thrive,\n   And Church of England loyalty outlive;\n   How all their persecuting days were done,\n   And their deliverer placed upon the throne:\n   The priests, as priests are wont to do, turned tail;\n   They're Englishmen, and nature will prevail.\n   Now they deplore the ruins they have made,\n   And murmur for the master they betrayed,\n   Excuse those crimes they could not make him mend,\n   And suffer for the cause they can't defend.\n   Pretend they'd not have carried things so high,\n   And proto-martyrs make for Popery.\n   Had the prince done as they designed the thing,\n   Have set the clergy up to rule the King,\n   Taken a donative for coming hither,\n   And so have left their King and them together,\n   We had, say they, been now a happy nation.\n   No doubt we had seen a blessed reformation:\n   For wise men say 'tis as dangerous a thing,\n   A ruling priesthood as a priest-rid king;\n   And of all plagues with which mankind are curst,\n   Ecclesiastic tyranny's the worst.\n     If all our former grievances were feigned,\n   King James has been abused and we trepanned;\n   Bugbeared with Popery and power despotic,\n   Tyrannic government and leagues exotic:\n   The Revolution's a fanatic plot,\n   William a tyrant, Sunderland a sot:\n   A factious army and a poisoned nation\n   Unjustly forced King James's abdication.\n     But if he did the subjects' rights invade,\n   Then he was punished only, not betrayed;\n   And punishing of kings is no such crime,\n   But Englishmen have done it many a time.\n     When kings the sword of justice first lay down,\n   They are no kings, though they possess the crown:\n   Titles are shadows, crowns are empty things:\n   The good of subjects is the end of kings;\n   To guide in war and to protect in peace;\n   Where tyrants once commence the kings do cease;\n   For arbitrary power's so strange a thing,\n   It makes the tyrant and unmakes the king.\n     If kings by foreign priests and armies reign,          |\n   And lawless power against their oaths maintain,           >\n   Then subjects must have reason to complain.              |\n     If oaths must bind us when our kings do ill,\n   To call in foreign aid is to rebel.\n   By force to circumscribe our lawful prince\n   Is wilful treason in the largest sense;\n   And they who once rebel, most certainly\n   Their God, and king, and former oaths defy.\n   If we allow no maladministration\n   Could cancel the allegiance of the nation,\n   Let all our learned sons of Levi try\n   This ecclesiastic riddle to untie:\n   How they could make a step to call the prince,\n   And yet pretend to oaths and innocence?\n     By the first address they made beyond the seas,\n   They're perjured in the most intense degrees;\n   And without scruple for the time to come\n   May swear to all the kings in Christendom.\n   And truly did our kings consider all,\n   They'd never let the clergy swear at all;\n   Their politic allegiance they'd refuse,\n   For whores and priests do never want excuse.\n   But if the mutual contract were dissolved,\n   The doubts explained, the difficulties solved,\n   That kings, when they descend to tyranny,\n   Dissolve the bond and leave the subject free,\n   The government's ungirt when justice dies,\n   And constitutions are non-entities;\n   The nation's all a mob; there's no such thing\n   As Lords or Commons, Parliament or King.\n   A great promiscuous crowd the hydra lies\n   Till laws revive and mutual contract ties;\n   A chaos free to choose for their own share\n   What case of government they please to wear.\n   If to a king they do the reins commit,\n   All men are bound in conscience to submit;\n   But then that king must by his oath assent\n   To _postulatus_ of the government,\n   Which if he breaks, he cuts off the entail,\n   And power retreats to its original.\n     This doctrine has the sanction of assent\n   From Nature's universal Parliament.\n   The voice of Nature and the course of things\n   Allow that laws superior are to kings.\n   None but delinquents would have justice cease;\n   Knaves rail at laws as soldiers rail at peace;\n   For justice is the end of government,\n   As reason is the test of argument.\n   No man was ever yet so void of sense\n   As to debate the right of self-defence,\n   A principle so grafted in the mind,\n   With Nature born, and does like Nature bind;\n   Twisted with reason and with Nature too,\n   As neither one or other can undo.\n     Nor can this right be less when national;\n   Reason, which governs one, should govern all.\n   Whatever the dialects of courts may tell,\n   He that his right demands can ne'er rebel,\n   Which right, if 'tis by governors denied,\n   May be procured by force or foreign aid;\n   For tyranny's a nation's term of grief,\n   As folks cry \"Fire\" to hasten in relief;\n   And when the hated word is heard about,\n   All men should come to help the people out.\n     Thus England groaned--Britannia's voice was heard,\n   And great Nassau to rescue her appeared,\n   Called by the universal voice of Fate--\n   God and the people's legal magistrate.\n   Ye Heavens regard! Almighty Jove look down,\n   And view thy injured monarch on the throne.\n   On their ungrateful heads due vengeance take,\n   Who sought his aid and then his part forsake.\n   Witness, ye Powers! It was our call alone,\n   Which now our pride makes us ashamed to own.\n   Britannia's troubles fetched him from afar\n   To court the dreadful casualties of war;\n   But where requital never can be made,\n   Acknowledgment's a tribute seldom paid.\n     He dwelt in bright Maria's circling arms,\n   Defended by the magic of her charms\n   From foreign fears and from domestic harms.\n   Ambition found no fuel to her fire;\n   He had what God could give or man desire.\n   Till pity roused him from his soft repose,\n   His life to unseen hazards to expose;\n   Till pity moved him in our cause t'appear;\n   Pity! that word which now we hate to hear.\n   But English gratitude is always such,\n   To hate the hand which doth oblige too much.\n     Britannia's cries gave birth to his intent,\n   And hardly gained his unforeseen assent;\n   His boding thoughts foretold him he should find\n   The people fickle, selfish, and unkind.\n   Which thought did to his royal heart appear\n   More dreadful than the dangers of the war;\n   For nothing grates a generous mind so soon\n   As base returns for hearty service done.\n     Satire, be silent! awfully prepare\n   Britannia's song and William's praise to hear.\n   Stand by, and let her cheerfully rehearse\n   Her grateful vows in her immortal verse.\n   Loud Fame's eternal trumpet let her sound;\n   Listen, ye distant Poles and endless round.\n   May the strong blast the welcome news convey\n   As far as sound can reach or spirit can fly.\n   To neighb'ring worlds, if such there be, relate\n   Our hero's fame, for theirs to imitate.\n   To distant worlds of spirits let her rehearse:\n   For spirits, without the help of voice, converse.\n   May angels hear the gladsome news on high,\n   Mixed with their everlasting symphony.\n   And Hell itself stand in suspense to know\n   Whether it be the fatal blast or no.\n\n\n\n\nBRITANNIA\n\n     The fame of virtue 'tis for which I sound,\n   And heroes with immortal triumphs crowned.\n   Fame, built on solid virtue, swifter flies\n   Than morning light can spread my eastern skies.\n   The gathering air returns the doubling sound,\n   And loud repeating thunders force it round;\n   Echoes return from caverns of the deep;\n   Old Chaos dreamt on't in eternal sleep;\n   Time hands it forward to its latest urn,\n   From whence it never, never shall return;\n   Nothing is heard so far or lasts so long;\n   'Tis heard by every ear and spoke by every tongue.\n     My hero, with the sails of honour furled,\n   Rises like the great genius of the world.\n   By Fate and Fame wisely prepared to be\n   The soul of war and life of victory;\n   He spreads the wings of virtue on the throne,\n   And every wind of glory fans them on.\n   Immortal trophies dwell upon his brow,\n   Fresh as the garlands he has won but now.\n     By different steps the high ascent he gains,\n   And differently that high ascent maintains.\n   Princes for pride and lust of rule make war,\n   And struggle for the name of conqueror.\n   Some fight for fame, and some for victory;\n   He fights to save, and conquers to set free.\n     Then seek no phrase his titles to conceal,\n   And hide with words what actions must reveal,\n   No parallel from Hebrew stories take\n   Of god-like kings my similes to make;\n   No borrowed names conceal my living theme,\n   But names and things directly I proclaim.\n   'Tis honest merit does his glory raise,\n   Whom that exalts let no man fear to praise:\n   Of such a subject no man need be shy,\n   Virtue's above the reach of flattery.\n   He needs no character but his own fame,\n   Nor any flattering titles but his name:\n   William's the name that's spoke by every tongue,\n   William's the darling subject of my song.\n   Listen, ye virgins to the charming sound,\n   And in eternal dances hand it round:\n   Your early offerings to this altar bring,\n   Make him at once a lover and a king.\n   May he submit to none but to your arms,\n   Nor ever be subdued but by your charms.\n   May your soft thoughts for him be all sublime,\n   And every tender vow be made for him.\n   May he be first in every morning thought,\n   And Heaven ne'er hear a prayer when he's left out.\n   May every omen, every boding dream,\n   Be fortunate by mentioning his name;\n   May this one charm infernal power affright,\n   And guard you from the terrors of the night;\n   May every cheerful glass, as it goes down\n   To William's health, be cordials to your own.\n   Let every song be chorused with his name,\n   And music pay a tribute

 While of my greatness there appeared no spark yet,\n   Behold I come, to let you see the pride\n   With which exalted beggars always ride.\n   Born to the needful labours of the plough,\n   The cart-whip graced me, as the chain does now.\n   Nature and Fate, in doubt what course to take,\n   Whether I should a lord or plough-boy make,\n   Kindly at last resolved they would promote me,\n   And first a knave, and then a knight, they vote me.\n   What Fate appointed, Nature did prepare,\n   And furnished me with an exceeding care,\n   To fit me for what they designed to have me;\n   And every gift, but honesty, they gave me.\n     And thus equipped, to this proud town I came,\n   In quest of bread, and not in quest of fame.\n   Blind to my future fate, a humble boy,\n   Free from the guilt and glory I enjoy,\n   The hopes which my ambition entertained\n   Were in the name of foot-boy all contained.\n   The greatest heights from small beginnings rise;\n   The gods were great on earth before they reached the skies.\n     B----  well, the generous temper of whose mind\n   Was ever to be bountiful inclined,\n   Whether by his ill-fate or fancy led,\n   First took me up, and furnished me with bread.\n   The little services he put me to\n   Seemed labours, rather than were truly so.\n   But always my advancement he designed,\n   For 'twas his very nature to be kind.\n   Large was his soul, his temper ever free;\n   The best of masters and of men to me.\n   And I, who was before decreed by Fate\n   To be made infamous as well as great,\n   With an obsequious diligence obeyed him,\n   Till trusted with his all, and then betrayed him.\n     All his past kindnesses I trampled on,\n   Ruined his fortunes to erect my own.\n   So vipers in the bosom bred, begin\n   To hiss at that hand first which took them in.\n   With eager treachery I his fall pursued,\n   And my first trophies were Ingratitude.\n    Ingratitude, the worst of human wit,\n   The basest action mankind can commit;\n   Which, like the sin against the Holy Ghost,\n   Has least of honour, and of guilt the most;\n   Distinguished from all other crimes by this,\n   That 'tis a crime which no man will confess.\n   That sin alone, which should not be forgiven\n   On earth, although perhaps it may in Heaven.\n     Thus my first benefactor I o'erthrew;\n   And how should I be to a second true?\n   The public trusts came next into my care,\n   And I to use them scurvily prepare.\n   My needy sovereign lord I played upon,\n   And lent him many a thousand of his own;\n   For which great interests I took care to charge,\n   And so my ill-got wealth became so large.\n     My predecessor, Judas, was a fool,\n   Fitter to have been whipped and sent to school\n   Than sell a Saviour. Had I been at hand,\n   His Master had not been so cheap trepanned;\n   I would have made the eager Jews have found,\n   For forty pieces, thirty thousand pound.\n     My cousin, Ziba, of immortal fame\n   (Ziba and I shall never want a name),\n   First-born of treason, nobly did advance\n   His master's fall for his inheritance,\n   By whose keen arts old David first began\n   To break his sacred oath with Jonathan:\n   The good old king, 'tis thought, was very loth\n   To break his word, and therefore broke his oath.\n   Ziba's a traitor of some quality,\n   Yet Ziba might have been informed by me:\n   Had I been there, he ne'er had been content\n   With half the estate, nor have the government.\n     In our late revolution 'twas thought strange\n   That I, of all mankind, should like the change;\n   But they who wondered at it never knew\n   That in it I did my old game pursue;\n   Nor had they heard of twenty thousand pound,\n   Which never yet was lost, nor ne'er was found.\n     Thus all things in their turn to sale I bring,\n   God and my master first, and then the King;\n   Till, by successful villanies made bold,\n   I thought to turn the nation into gold;\n   And so to forgery my hand I bent,                   |\n   Not doubting I could gull the Government;            >\n   But there was ruffled by the Parliament.            |\n   And if I 'scaped the unhappy tree to climb,\n   'Twas want of law, and not for want of crime.\n     But my old friend,[22] who printed in my face\n   A needful competence of English brass,\n   Having more business yet for me to do,\n   And loth to lose his trusty servant so,\n   Managed the matter with such art and skill\n   As saved his hero and threw down the bill.\n     And now I'm graced with unexpected honours,\n   For which I'll certainly abuse the donors.\n   Knighted, and made a tribune of the people,\n   Whose laws and properties I'm like to keep well;\n   The _custos rotulorum_ of the City,\n   And captain of the guards of their banditti.\n   Surrounded by my catchpoles, I declare\n   Against the needy debtor open war;\n   I hang poor thieves for stealing of your pelf,\n   And suffer none to rob you but myself.\n     The King commanded me to help reform ye,\n   And how I'll do it, Miss shall inform ye.\n   I keep the best seraglio in the nation,\n   And hope in time to bring it into fashion.\n   For this my praise is sung by every bard,\n   For which Bridewell would be a just reward.\n   In print my panegyrics fill the streets,\n   And hired gaol-birds their huzzas repeat.\n   Some charities contrived to make a show,\n   Have taught the needy rabble to do so,\n   Whose empty noise is a mechanic fame,\n   Since for Sir Belzebub they'd do the same.\n\n\n\nTHE CONCLUSION\n\n   Then let us boast of ancestors no more,\n   Or deeds of heroes done in days of yore,\n   In latent records of the ages past,\n   Behind the rear of time, in long oblivion placed.\n   For if our virtues must in lines descend,\n   The merit with the families would end,\n   And intermixtures would most fatal grow;\n   For vice would be hereditary too;\n   The tainted blood would of necessity\n   Involuntary wickedness convey.\n     Vice, like ill-nature, for an age or two\n   May seem a generation to pursue;\n   But virtue seldom does regard the breed;\n   Fools do the wise, and wise men fools succeed.\n   What is't to us what ancestors we had?\n   If good, what better? or what worse, if bad?\n   Examples are for imitation set,\n   Yet all men follow virtue with regret.\n     Could but our ancestors retrieve the fate,\n   And see their offspring thus degenerate;\n   How we contend for birth and names unknown,\n   And build on their past actions, not our own;\n   They'd cancel records, and their tombs deface,\n   And openly disown the vile degenerate race:\n   For fame of families is all a cheat,\n   'Tis personal virtue only makes us great.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHORTEST WAY\nWITH\nTHE DISSENTERS;\nOR,\nPROPOSALS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT\nOF\nTHE CHURCH\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SHORTEST WAY WITH\nTHE DISSENTERS\n\n\nSir Roger L'Estrange tells us a story in his collection of fables, of\nthe cock and the horses. The cock was gotten to roost in the stable\namong the horses, and there being no racks or other conveniences for\nhim, it seems he was forced to roost upon the ground. The horses\njostling about for room, and putting the cock in danger of his life,\nhe gives them this grave advice, \"Pray, gentlefolks, let us stand\nstill, for fear we should tread upon one another.\"\n\nThere are some people in the world, who now they are unperched, and\nreduced to an equality with other people, and under strong and very\njust apprehensions of being further treated as they deserve, begin,\nwith \u00c3\u0086sop's cock, to preach up peace and union, and the Christian\nduties of moderation, for getting that, when they had the power in\ntheir hands, these graces were strangers in their gates.\n\nIt is now near fourteen years[23] that the glory and peace of the\npurest and most flourishing Church in the world has been eclipsed,\nbuffeted, and disturbed by a sort of men whom God in His providence\nhas suffered to insult over her and bring her down. These have been\nthe days of her humiliation and tribulation. She has borne with\ninvincible patience the reproach of the wicked, and God has at last\nheard her prayers, and delivered her from the oppression of the\nstranger.\n\nAnd now they find their day is over, their power gone, and the throne\nof this nation possessed by a royal, English, true, and ever-constant\nmember of, and friend to, the Church of England. Now they find that\nthey are in danger of the Church of England's just resentments; now\nthey cry out peace, union, forbearance, and charity, as if the Church\nhad not too long harboured her enemies under her wing, and nourished\nthe viperous brood till they hiss and fly in the face of the mother\nthat cherished them.\n\nNo, gentlemen, the time of mercy is past, your day of grace is over;\nyou should have practised peace, and moderation, and charity, if you\nexpected any yourselves.\n\nWe have heard none of this lesson for fourteen years past. We have\nbeen huffed and bullied with your Act of Toleration; you have told us\nthat you are the Church established by law, as well as others; have\nset up your canting synagogues at our church doors, and the Church and\nmembers have been loaded with reproaches, with oaths, associations,\nabjurations, and what not. Where has been the mercy, the forbearance,\nthe charity, you have shown to tender consciences of the Church of\nEngland, that could not take oaths as fast as you made them; that\nhaving sworn allegiance to their lawful and rightful King, could not\ndispense with that oath, their King being still alive, and swear to\nyour new hodge-podge of a Dutch Government? These have been turned out\nof their livings, and they and their families left to starve; their\nestates double taxed to carry on a war they had no hand in, and you\ngot nothing by. What account can you give of the multitudes you have\nforced to comply, against their consciences, with your new sophistical\npolitics, who, like new converts in France, sin because they cannot\nstarve? And now the tables are turned upon you; you must not be\npersecuted; it is not a Christian spirit.\n\nYou have butchered one king, deposed another king, and made a mock\nking of a third,[24] and yet you could have the face to expect to be\nemployed and trusted by the fourth. Anybody that did not know the\ntemper of your party would stand amazed at the impudence, as well as\nfolly, to think of it.\n\nYour management of your Dutch monarch, whom you reduced to a mere King\nof Clouts, is enough to give any future princes such an idea of your\nprinciples as to warn them sufficiently from coming into your\nclutches; and God be thanked the Queen is out of your hands, knows\nyou, and will have a care of you.\n\nThere is no doubt but the supreme authority of a nation has in itself\na power, and a right to that power, to execute the laws upon any part\nof that nation it governs. The execution of the known laws of the\nland, and that with a weak and gentle hand neither, was all this\nfanatical party of this land have ever called persecution; this they\nhave magnified to a height, that the sufferings of the Huguenots in\nFrance were not to be compared with. Now, to execute the known laws of\na nation upon those who transgress them, after voluntarily consenting\nto the making those laws, can never be called persecution, but\njustice. But justice is always violence to the party offending, for\nevery man is innocent in his own eyes. The first execution of the laws\nagainst Dissenters in England was in the days of King James the\nFirst;[25] and what did it amount to truly? The worst they suffered\nwas at their own request: to let them go to New England and erect a\nnew colony, and give them great privileges, grants, and suitable\npowers, keep them under protection, and defend them against all\ninvaders, and receive no taxes or revenue from them. This was the\ncruelty of the Church of England. Fatal leniency! It was the ruin of\nthat excellent prince, King Charles the First. Had King James sent all\nthe Puritans in England away to the West Indies, we had been a\nnational, unmixed Church; the Church of England had been kept\nundivided and entire.\n\nTo requite the lenity of the father they take up arms against the son;\nconquer, pursue, take, imprison, and at last put to death the anointed\nof God, and destroy the very being and nature of government, setting\nup a sordid impostor, who had neither title to govern nor\nunderstanding to manage, but supplied that want with power, bloody and\ndesperate counsels, and craft without conscience.\n\nHad not King James the First withheld the full execution of the laws,\nhad he given them strict justice, he had cleared the nation of them,\nand the consequences had been plain: his son had never been murdered\nby them nor the monarchy overwhelmed. It was too much mercy shown\nthem, was the ruin of his posterity and the ruin of the nation's\npeace. One would think the Dissenters should not have the face to\nbelieve that we are to be wheedled and canted into peace and\ntoleration when they know that they have once requited us with a civil\nwar, and once with an intolerable and unrighteous persecution for our\nformer civility.\n\nNay, to encourage us to be easy with them, it is apparent that they\nnever had the upper hand of the Church, but they treated her with all\nthe severity, with all the reproach and contempt that was possible.\nWhat peace and what mercy did they show the loyal gentry of the Church\nof England in the time of their triumphant Commonwealth? How did they\nput all the gentry of England to ransom, whether they were actually in\narms for the King or not, making people compound for their estates and\nstarve their families? How did they treat the clergy of the Church of\nEngland, sequestered the ministers, devoured the patrimony of the\nChurch, and divided the spoil by sharing the Church lands among their\nsoldiers, and turning her clergy out to starve? Just such measure as\nthey have meted should be measured them again.\n\nCharity and love is the known doctrine of the Church of England, and\nit is plain she has put it in practice towards the Dissenters, even\nbeyond what they ought, till she has been wanting to herself, and in\neffect unkind to her sons, particularly in the too much lenity of King\nJames the First, mentioned before. Had he so rooted the Puritans from\nthe face of the land, which he had an opportunity early to have done,\nthey had not had the power to vex the Church as since they have done.\n\nIn the days of King Charles the Second, how did the Church reward\ntheir bloody doings with lenity and mercy, except the barbarous\nregicides of the pretended court of justice? Not a soul suffered for\nall the blood in an unnatural war. King Charles came in all mercy and\nlove, cherished them, preferred them, employed them, withheld the\nrigour of the law, and oftentimes, even against the advice of his\nParliament, gave them liberty of conscience;[26] and how did they\nrequite him with the villainous contrivance to depose and murder him\nand his successor at the Rye Plot?[27]\n\nKing James, as if mercy was the inherent quality of the family, began\nhis reign with unusual favour to them. Nor could their joining with\nthe Duke of Monmouth against him move him to do himself justice upon\nthem; but that mistaken prince thought to win them by gentleness and\nlove, proclaimed an universal liberty to them, and rather\ndiscountenanced the Church of England than them.[28] How they requited\nhim all the world knows.\n\nThe late reign is too fresh in the memory of all the world to need a\ncomment; how, under pretence of joining with the Church in redressing\nsome grievances, they pushed things to that extremity, in conjunction\nwith some mistaken gentlemen, as to depose the late King, as if the\ngrievance of the nation could not have been redressed but by the\nabsolute ruin of the prince. Here is an instance of their temper,\ntheir peace, and charity. To what height they carried themselves\nduring the reign of a king of their own; how they crept into all\nplaces of trust and profit; how they insinuated into the favour of the\nKing, and were at first preferred to the highest places in the nation;\nhow they engrossed the ministry, and above all, how pitifully they\nmanaged, is too plain to need any remarks.\n\nBut particularly their mercy and charity, the spirit of union, they\ntell us so much of, has been remarkable  in Scotland. If any man would\nsee the spirit of a Dissenter, let him look into Scotland. There they\nmade entire conquest of the Church, trampled down the sacred orders,\nand suppressed the Episcopal government with an absolute, and, as they\nsuppose, irretrievable victory, though it is possible they may find\nthemselves mistaken. Now it would be a very proper question to ask\ntheir impudent advocate, the Observator, pray how much mercy and\nfavour did the members of the Episcopal Church find in Scotland from\nthe Scotch Presbyterian Government? and I shall undertake for the\nChurch of England that the Dissenters shall still receive as much\nhere, though they deserve but little.\n\nIn a small treatise of the sufferings of the Episcopal clergy in\nScotland, it will appear what usage they met with; how they not only\nlost their livings, but in several places were plundered and abused in\ntheir persons; the ministers that could not conform turned out with\nnumerous families and no maintenance, and hardly charity enough left\nto relieve them with a bit of bread. And the cruelties of the parties\nare innumerable, and not to be attempted in this short piece.\n\nAnd now to prevent the distant cloud which they perceived to hang over\ntheir heads from England. With a true Presbyterian policy, they put in\nfor a union of nations, that England might unite their Church with the\nKirk of Scotland, and their Presbyterian members sit in our House of\nCommons, and their Assembly of Scotch canting long-cloaks in our\nConvocation. What might have been if our fanatic Whiggish statesmen\ncontinued, God only knows; but we hope we are out of fear of that now.\n\nIt is alleged by some of the faction--and they began to bully us with\nit--that if we won't unite with them, they will not settle the crown\nwith us again, but when Her Majesty dies, will choose a king for\nthemselves.\n\nIf they won't, we must make them, and it is not the first time we have\nlet them know that we are able. The crowns of these kingdoms have not\nso far disowned the right of succession, but they may retrieve it\nagain; and if Scotland thinks to come off from a successive to an\nelective state of government, England has not promised not to assist\nthe right heir and put them into possession without any regard to\ntheir ridiculous settlements.[29]\n\nThese are the gentlemen, these their ways of treating the Church, both\nat home and abroad. Now let us examine the reasons they pretend to\ngive why we should be favourable to them, why we should continue and\ntolerate them among us.\n\nFirst, they are very numerous, they say; they are a great part of the\nnation, and we cannot suppress them.\n\nTo this may be answered:--\n1. They are not so numerous as the Protestants in France, and yet the\nFrench King effectually cleared the nation of them at once, and we\ndon't find he misses them at home.[30] But I am not of the opinion\nthey are so numerous as is pretended; their party is more numerous\nthan their persons, and those mistaken people of the Church who are\nmisled and deluded by their wheedling artifices to join with them,\nmake their party the greater; but these will open their eyes when the\nGovernment shall set heartily about the work, and come off from them,\nas some animals which they say always desert a house when it is likely\nto fall.\n\n2. The more numerous the more dangerous, and therefore the more need\nto suppress them; and God has suffered us to bear them as goads in our\nsides for not utterly extinguishing them long ago.\n\n3. If we are to allow them only because we cannot suppress them, then\nit ought to be tried whether we can or not; and I am of opinion it is\neasy to be done, and could prescribe ways and means, if it were\nproper; but I doubt not the Government will find effectual methods for\nthe rooting the contagion from the face of this land.\n\nAnother argument they use, which is this, that it is a time of war,\nand we have need to unite against the common enemy.\n\nWe answer, this common enemy had been no enemy if they had not made\nhim so. He was quiet in peace, and no way disturbed or encroached upon\nus, and we know no reason we had to quarrel with him.\n\nBut further, we make no question but we are able to deal with this\ncommon enemy without their help; but why must we unite with them\nbecause of the enemy? Will they go over to the enemy if we do not\nprevent it by a union with them? We are very well contented they\nshould, and make no question we shall be ready to deal with them and\nthe common enemy too, and better without them than with them.\n\nBesides, if we have a common enemy, there is the more need to be\nsecure against our private enemies. If there is one common enemy, we\nhave the less need to have an enemy in our bowels.\n\nIt was a great argument some people used against suppressing the old\nmoney, that it was a time of war, and it was too great a risk for the\nnation to run; if we should not master it, we should be undone. And\nyet the sequel proved the hazard was not so great but it might be\nmastered, and the success was answerable. The suppressing the\nDissenters is not a harder work nor a work of less necessity to the\npublic. We can never enjoy a settled, uninterrupted union and\ntranquillity in this nation till the spirit of Whiggism, faction, and\nschism is melted down like the old money.\n\nTo talk of the difficulty is to frighten ourselves with chimeras and\nnotions of a powerful party, which are indeed a party without power.\nDifficulties often appear greater at a distance than when they are\nsearched into with judgment and distinguished from the vapours and\nshadows that attend them.\n\nWe are not to be frightened with it; this age is wiser than that by\nall our own experience and theirs too. King Charles the First had\nearly suppressed this party if he had taken more deliberate measures.\nIn short, it is not worth arguing to talk of their arms. Their\nMonmouths, and Shaftesburys, and Argyles are gone; their Dutch\nsanctuary is at an end; Heaven has made way for their destruction, and\nif we do not close with the Divine occasion, we are to blame\nourselves, and may remember that we had once an opportunity to serve\nthe Church of England by extirpating her implacable enemies, and\nhaving let slip the minute that Heaven presented, may experimentally\ncomplain, _Post est occasio calva_.\n\nHere are some popular objections in the way:--\n\nAs first, the Queen has promised them to continue them in their\ntolerated liberty, and has told us she will be a religious observer of\nher word.\n\nWhat Her Majesty will do we cannot help; but what, as head of the\nChurch, she ought to do, is another case. Her Majesty has promised to\nprotect and defend the Church of England, and if she can not\neffectually do that without the destruction of the Dissenters, she\nmust of course dispense with one promise to comply with another. But\nto answer this cavil more effectually: Her Majesty did never promise\nto maintain the toleration to the destruction of the Church; but it is\nupon supposition that it may be compatible with the well-being and\nsafety of the Church, which she had declared she would take especial\ncare of. Now if these two interests clash, it is plain Her Majesty's\nintentions are to uphold, protect, defend, and establish the Church,\nand this we conceive is impossible.\n\nPerhaps it may be said that the Church is in no immediate danger from\nthe Dissenters, and therefore it is time enough. But this is a weak\nanswer.\n\nFor first, if a danger be real, the distance of it is no argument\nagainst, but rather a spur to quicken us to prevention, lest it be too\nlate hereafter.\n\nAnd secondly, here is the opportunity, and the only one perhaps that\never the Church had, to secure herself and destroy her enemies.\n\nThe representatives of the nation have now an opportunity; the time is\ncome which all good men have wished for, that the gentlemen of England\nmay serve the Church of England. Now they are protected and encouraged\nby a Church of England Queen.\n\nWhat will you do for your sister in the day that she shall be spoken\nfor?\n\nIf ever you will establish the best Christian Church in the world; if\never you will suppress the spirit of enthusiasm; if ever you will free\nthe nation from the viperous brood that have so long sucked the blood\nof their mother; if ever you will leave your posterity free from\nfaction and rebellion, this is the time. This is the time to pull up\nthis heretical weed of sedition that has so long disturbed the peace\nof our Church and poisoned the good corn.\n\nBut, says another hot and cold objector, this is renewing fire and\nfaggot, reviving the act _De Heretico Comburendo_; this will be\ncruelty in its nature, and barbarous to all the world.\n\nI answer, it is cruelty to kill a snake or a toad in cold blood, but\nthe poison of their nature makes it a charity to our neighbours to\ndestroy those creatures, not for any personal injury received, but for\nprevention; not for the evil they have done, but the evil they may do.\n\nSerpents, toads, vipers, &c., are noxious to the body, and poison the\nsensitive life; these poison the soul, corrupt our posterity, ensnare\nour children, destroy the vitals of our happiness, our future\nfelicity, and contaminate the whole mass.\n\nShall any law be given to such wild creatures? Some beasts are for\nsport, and the huntsmen give them advantages of ground; but some are\nknocked on the head by all possible ways of violence and surprise.\n\nI do not prescribe fire and faggot, but, as Scipio said of Carthage,\n_Delenda est Carthago_. They are to be rooted out of this nation, if\never we will live in peace, serve God, or enjoy our own. As for the\nmanner, I leave it to those hands who have a right to execute God's\njustice on the nation's and the Church's enemies.\n\nBut if we must be frighted from this justice under the specious\npretences and odious sense of cruelty, nothing will be effected: it\nwill be more barbarous to our own children and dear posterity when\nthey shall reproach their fathers, as we do ours, and tell us, \"You\nhad an opportunity to root out this cursed race from the world under\nthe favour and protection of a true English queen; and out of your\nfoolish pity you spared them, because, forsooth, you would not be\ncruel; and now our Church is suppressed and persecuted, our religion\ntrampled under foot, our estates plundered, our persons imprisoned and\ndragged to jails, gibbets, and scaffolds: your sparing this Amalekite\nrace is our destruction, your mercy to them proves cruelty to your\npoor posterity.\"\n\nHow just will such reflections be when our posterity shall fall under\nthe merciless clutches of this uncharitable generation, when our\nChurch shall be swallowed up in schism, faction, enthusiasm, and\nconfusion; when our Government shall be devolved upon foreigners, and\nour monarchy dwindled into a republic.\n\nIt would be more rational for us, if we must spare this generation, to\nsummon our own to a general massacre, and as we have brought them into\nthe world free, send them out so, and not betray them to destruction\nby our supine negligence, and then cry, \"It is mercy.\"\n\nMoses was a merciful, meek man, and yet with what fury did he run\nthrough the camp, and cut the throats of three-and-thirty thousand of\nhis dear Israelites that were fallen into idolatry. What was the\nreason? It was mercy to the rest to make these examples, to prevent\nthe destruction of the whole army.\n\nHow many millions of future souls we save from infection and delusion\nif the present race of poisoned spirits were purged from the face of\nthe land!\n\nIt is vain to trifle in this matter, the light, foolish handling of\nthem by mulcts, fines, &c.,--it is their glory and their advantage. If\nthe gallows instead of the Counter, and the galleys instead of the\nfines, were the reward of going to a conventicle, to preach or hear,\nthere would not be so many sufferers. The spirit of martyrdom is over;\nthey that will go to church to be chosen sheriffs and mayors would go\nto forty churches rather than be hanged.\n\nIf one severe law were made and punctually executed, that whoever was\nfound at a conventicle should be banished the nation and the preacher\nbe hanged, we should soon see an end of the tale. They would all come\nto church, and one age would make us all one again.\n\nTo talk of five shillings a month for not coming to the sacrament, and\none shilling per week for not coming to church, this is such a way of\nconverting people as never was known; this is selling them a liberty\nto transgress for so much money. If it be not a crime, why don't we\ngive them full license? And if it be, no price ought to compound for\nthe committing it, for that is selling a liberty to people to sin\nagainst God and the Government.\n\nIf it be a crime of the highest consequence both against the peace and\nwelfare of the nation, the glory of God, the good of the Church, and\nthe happiness of the soul, let us rank it among capital offences, and\nlet it receive a punishment in proportion to it.\n\nWe hang men for trifles, and banish them for things not worth naming;\nbut an offence against God and the Church, against the welfare of the\nworld and the dignity of religion, shall be bought off for five\nshillings! This is such a shame to a Christian Government that it is\nwith regret I transmit it to posterity.\n\nIf men sin against God, affront His ordinances, rebel against His\nChurch, and disobey the precepts of their superiors, let them suffer\nas such capital crimes deserve. So will religion flourish, and this\ndivided nation be once again united.\n\nAnd yet the title of barbarous and cruel will soon be taken off from\nthis law too. I am not supposing that all the Dissenters in England\nshould be hanged or banished, but, as in cases of rebellions and\ninsurrections, if a few of the ringleaders suffer, the multitude are\ndismissed; so, a few obstinate people being made examples, there is no\ndoubt but the severity of the law would find a stop in the compliance\nof the multitude.\n\nTo make the reasonableness of this matter out of question, and more\nunanswerably plain, let us examine for what it is that this nation is\ndivided into parties and factions, and let us see how they can justify\na separation, or we of the Church of England can justify our bearing\nthe insults and inconveniences of the party.\n\nOne of their leading pastors,[31] and a man of as much learning as\nmost among them, in his answer to a pamphlet, entitled \"An Inquiry\ninto the Occasional Conformity,\" has these words, p. 27, \"Do the\nreligion of the Church and the meeting-houses make two religions?\nWherein do they differ? The substance of the same religion is common\nto them both; and the modes and accidents are the things in which only\nthey differ.\" P. 28: \"Thirty-nine articles are given us for the\nsummary of our religion; thirty-six contain the substance of it,\nwherein we agree; three, the additional appendices, about which we\nhave some differences.\"\n\nNow, if as by their own acknowledgment the Church of England is a true\nChurch, and the difference between them is only in a few modes and\naccidents, why should we expect that they will suffer galleys,\ncorporeal punishment, and banishment for these trifles? There is no\nquestion but they will be wiser; even their own principles will not\nbear them out in it; they will certainly comply with the laws and with\nreason; and though at the first severity they may seem hard, the next\nage will feel nothing of it; the contagion will be rooted out; the\ndisease being cured, there will be no need of the operation; but if\nthey should venture to transgress and fall into the pit, all the world\nmust condemn their obstinacy, as being without ground from their own\nprinciples.\n\nThus the pretence of cruelty will be taken off, and the party actually\nsuppressed, and the disquiets they have so often brought upon the\nnation prevented.\n\nTheir numbers and their wealth make them haughty, and that is so far\nfrom being an argument to persuade us to forbear them, that it is a\nwarning to us, without any delay, to reconcile them to the unity of\nthe Church or remove them from us.\n\nAt present, Heaven be praised, they are not so formidable as they have\nbeen, and it is our own fault if ever we suffer them to be so.\nProvidence and the Church of England seem to join in this particular,\nthat now the destroyers of the nation's peace may be overturned, and\nto this end the present opportunity seems to be put into our hands.\n\nTo this end her present Majesty seems reserved to enjoy the crown,\nthat the ecclesiastic as well as civil rights of the nation may be\nrestored by her hand. To this end the face of affairs have received\nsuch a turn in the process of a few months as never has been before;\nthe leading men of the nation, the universal cry of the people, the\nunanimous request of the clergy, agree in this, that the deliverance\nof our Church is at hand. For this end has Providence given us such a\nParliament, such a Convocation, such a gentry, and such a Queen as we\nnever had before. And what may be the consequences of a neglect of\nsuch opportunities? The succession of the crown has but a dark\nprospect; another Dutch turn may make the hopes of it ridiculous and\nthe practice impossible. Be the house of our future princes never so\nwell inclined, they will be foreigners, and many years will be spent\nin suiting the genius of strangers to this crown and the interests of\nthe nation; and how many ages it may be before the English throne be\nfilled with so much zeal and can dour, so much tenderness and hearty\naffection to the Church as we see it now covered with, who can\nimagine?\n\nIt is high time, then, for the friends of the Church of England to\nthink of building up and establishing her in such a manner that she\nmay be no more invaded by foreigners nor divided by factions, schisms,\nand error.\n\nIf this could be done by gentle and easy methods, I should be glad;\nbut the wound is corroded, the vitals begin to mortify, and nothing\nbut amputation of members can complete the cure; all the ways of\ntenderness and compassion, all persuasive arguments, have been made\nuse of in vain.\n\nThe humour of the Dissenters has so increased among the people, that\nthey hold the Church in defiance, and the house of God is an\nabomination among them; nay, they have brought up their posterity in\nsuch prepossessed aversions to our holy religion, that the ignorant\nmob think we are all idolaters and worshippers of Baal, and account it\na sin to come within the walls of our churches.\n\nThe primitive Christians were not more shy of a heathen temple or of\nmeat offered to idols, nor the Jews of swine's flesh, than some of our\nDissenters are of the Church, and the divine service solemnised\ntherein.\n\nThis obstinacy must be rooted out with the profession of it; while the\ngeneration are less at liberty daily to affront God Almighty and\ndishonour His holy worship, we are wanting in our duty to God and our\nmother, the Church of England.\n\nHow can we answer it to God, to the Church, and to our posterity to\nleave them entangled with fanaticism, error, and obstinacy in the\nbowels of the nation; to leave them an enemy in their streets, that in\ntime may involve them in the same crimes, and endanger the utter\nextirpation of religion in the nation?\n\nWhat is the difference betwixt this and being subjected to the power\nof the Church of Rome, from whence we have reformed? If one be an\nextreme on one hand, and one on another, it is equally destructive to\nthe truth to have errors settled among us, let them be of what nature\nthey will.\n\nBoth are enemies of our Church and of our peace; and why should it not\nbe as criminal to admit an enthusiast as a Jesuit? Why should the\nPapist with his seven sacraments be worse than the Quaker with no\nsacraments at all? Why should religious houses be more intolerable\nthan meeting-houses? Alas, the Church of England! What with Popery on\none hand, and schismatics on the other, how has she been crucified\nbetween two thieves!\n\nNow let us crucify the thieves. Let her foundations be established\nupon the destruction of her enemies. The doors of mercy being always\nopen to the returning part of the deluded people, let the obstinate be\nruled with the rod of iron.\n\nLet all true sons of so holy and oppressed a mother, exasperated by\nher afflictions, harden their hearts against those who have oppressed\nher.\n\nAnd may God Almighty put it into the hearts of all the friends of\ntruth to lift up a standard against pride and Antichrist, that the\nposterity of the sons of error may be rooted out from the face of this\nland for ever.\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n[Footnote 1: _Hours in a Library_.]\n\n[Footnote 2: Wilson's _Memoirs of Defoe_, London, 1830, III., p. 429.]\n\n[Footnote 3: Defoe mentions the letter in his _Review_ for August\n11th, 1705.]\n\n[Footnote 4: I was not called Colonel Jacque as at London, but\nColonel, and they did not know me by any other name.]\n\n[Footnote 5: He did not now talk quite so blindly and childishly as\nwhen he was a boy, and when the custom-house gentleman talked to him\nabout his names.]\n\n[Footnote 6: Here he showed him the horsewhip that was given him with\nhis new office.]\n\n[Footnote 7: So the negroes call the owner of the plantation, or at\nleast so they called him, because he was a great man in the country,\nhaving three or four large plantations.]\n\n[Footnote 8: To be drunk in a negro is to be mad; for when they get\nrum they are worse than raving, and fit to do any manner of mischief.]\n\n[Footnote 9: He understood the plot, and took the opportunity to tell\nhim that, to see what he would say.]\n\n[Footnote 10: He understood him; he meant he would beg your honour for\nme, that I might not be hanged for offending you.]\n\n[Footnote 11: This old proverb was quoted by Robert Burton in his\n\"Anatomy of Melancholy\" (1621), \"Where God hath a temple the Devil\nhath a chapel\" (Part III. sc. iv. subs. 1).

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":621,"split":"train"}
