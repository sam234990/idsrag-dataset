Gadsby and his youthful army, despite some opposition, transform Branton Hills from a stagnant municipality into a bustling, thriving city. Toward the end of the book the members of Gadsby's organization receive diplomas in honor of their work. Gadsby becomes mayor and helps increase Branton Hills' population from 2,000 to 60,000.\nThe story begins around 1906 and continues through World War I, Prohibition, and President Warren G. Harding's administration. Gadsby is divided into two parts. The first part (about a quarter of the book's total length) is strictly a history of the city of Branton Hills and John Gadsby's place in it. The second part of the book devotes more time to fleshing out the rest of the town's characters.\nThe novel is written from the point of view of an anonymous narrator, who continually complains about his poor writing skills and often uses circumlocution. \"Now, naturally, in writing such a story as this, with its conditions as laid down in its Introduction, it is not surprising that an occasional \"rough spot\" in composition is found\", the narrator says. \"So I trust that a critical public will hold constantly in mind that I am voluntarily avoiding words containing that symbol which is, by far, of most common inclusion in writing our Anglo-Saxon as it is, today\".\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Gadsby, by Ernest Vincent Wright\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions \nwhatsoever.

This was done so that none of that vowel might slip in,\naccidentally; and many _did_ try to do so!\n\nThere is a great deal of information as to what _Youth_ can do, if\ngiven a chance; and, though it starts out in somewhat of an impersonal\nvein, there is plenty of thrill, rollicking comedy, love, courtship,\nmarriage, patriotism, sudden tragedy, _a determined stand against\nliquor_, and some amusing political aspirations in a small growing town.\n\nIn writing such a story,--purposely avoiding all words containing\nthe vowel E, there are a great many difficulties. The greatest of\nthese is met in the past tense of verbs, almost all of which end\nwith \"--ed.\" Therefore substitutes must be found; and they are _very\nfew_. This will cause, at times, a somewhat monotonous use of such\nwords as \"said;\" for neither \"replied,\" \"answered\" nor \"asked\" can\nbe used. Another difficulty comes with the elimination of the common\ncouplet \"of course,\" and its very common connective, \"consequently;\"\nwhich will, unavoidably cause \"bumpy spots.\" The numerals also cause\nplenty of trouble, for none between six and thirty are available. When\nintroducing young ladies into the story, this is a _real_ barrier; for\nwhat young woman wants to have it known that she is over thirty? And\nthis restriction on numbers, of course taboos all mention of dates.\n\nMany abbreviations also must be avoided; the most common of all, \"Mr.\"\nand \"Mrs.\" being particularly troublesome; for those words, if read\naloud, plainly indicate the E in their orthography.\n\nAs the vowel E is used more than five times oftener than any other\nletter, this story was written, not through any attempt to attain\nliterary merit, but due to a somewhat balky nature, caused by hearing\nit so constantly claimed that \"it can't be done; for you _cannot_ say\nanything at all without using E, and make smooth continuity, with\nperfectly grammatical construction--\" so 'twas said.\n\nMany may think that I simply \"drop\" the E's, filling the gaps with\napostrophes. A perusal of the book will show that this is not so. All\nwords used are _complete_; are correctly spelled and properly used.\nThis has been accomplished through the use of synonyms; and, by so\ntwisting a sentence around as to avoid ambiguity. The book may prove a\nvaluable aid to school children in English composition.\n\nPeople, as a rule, will not stop to realize what a task such an attempt\nactually is. As I wrote along, in long-hand at first, a whole army\nof little E's gathered around my desk, all eagerly expecting to be\ncalled upon. But gradually as they saw me writing on and on, without\neven noticing them, they grew uneasy; and, with excited whisperings\namongst themselves, began hopping up and riding on my pen, looking down\nconstantly for a chance to drop off into some word; for all the world\nlike sea-birds perched, watching for a passing fish! But when they saw\nthat I had covered 138 pages of typewriter size paper, they slid off\nonto the floor, walking sadly away, arm in arm; but shouting back: \"You\ncertainly must have a hodge-podge of a yarn there without _Us!_ Why,\nman! We are in every story ever written, _hundreds of thousands of\ntimes!_ This is the first time we ever were shut out!\"\n\nPronouns also caused trouble; for such words as he, she, they, them,\ntheirs, her, herself, myself, himself, yourself, etc., could not be\nutilized. But a particularly annoying obstacle comes when, almost\nthrough a long paragraph you can find no words with which to continue\nthat line of thought; hence, as in Solitaire, you are \"stuck,\" and must\ngo way back and start another; which, of course, must perfectly fit the\npreceding context.\n\nI have received some extremely odd criticisms since the Associated\nPress widely announced that such a book was being written. A\nrapid-talking New York newspaper columnist wanted to know how I would\nget over the plain fact that my name contains the letter E three times.\nAs an author's name is _not_ a part of his story, that criticism\ndid not hold water. And I received one most scathing epistle from a\nlady (woman!) denouncing me as a \"genuine fake;\" (that paradox being\na most interesting one!), and ending by saying:--\"Everyone knows\nthat such a feat is impossible.\" All right. Then the impossible has\nbeen accomplished; (a paradox to equal hers!) Other criticism may be\ndirected at the Introduction; but this section of a story _also_ is not\npart of it. The author is entitled to it, in order properly to explain\nhis work. The story required five and a half months of concentrated\nendeavor, with so many erasures and retrenchments that I tremble as\nI think of them. Of course anybody can write such a story. All that\nis needed is a piece of string tied from the E type-bar down to some\npart of the base of the typewriter. Then simply go ahead and type your\nstory. Incidentally, you should have some sort of a bromide preparation\nhandy, for use when the going gets rough, as it most assuredly will!\n\nBefore the book was in print, I was freely and openly informed \"there\nis a trick, or catch,\" somewhere in that claim that there is not one\nletter E in the entire book, after you leave the Introduction. Well; it\nis the privilege of the reader to unearth any such deception that he\nor she may think they can find. I have even ordered the printer not to\nhead each chapter with the words \"Chapter 2,\" etc., on account of that\nbothersome E in that word.\n\nIn closing let me say that I trust you may learn to love all the young\nfolks in the story, as deeply as I have, in introducing them to you.\nLike many a book, it grows more and more interesting as the reader\nbecomes well acquainted with the characters.\n\n  Los Angeles, California\n  February, 1939\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nIf Youth, throughout all history, had had a champion to stand up for\nit; to show a doubting world that a child can think; and, possibly,\ndo it practically; you wouldn't constantly run across folks today\nwho claim that \"a child don't know anything.\" A child's brain starts\nfunctioning at birth; and has, amongst its many infant convolutions,\nthousands of dormant atoms, into which God has put a mystic possibility\nfor noticing an adult's act, and figuring out its purport.\n\nUp to about its primary school days a child thinks, naturally, only of\nplay. But many a form of play contains disciplinary factors. \"You can't\ndo this,\" or \"that puts you out,\" shows a child that it must think,\npractically, or fail. Now, if, throughout childhood, a brain has no\nopposition, it is plain that it will attain a position of \"status quo,\"\nas with our ordinary animals. Man knows not why a cow, dog or lion was\nnot born with a brain on a par with ours; why such animals cannot add,\nsubtract, or obtain from books and schooling, that paramount position\nwhich Man holds today.\n\nBut a human brain is not in that class. Constantly throbbing and\npulsating, it rapidly forms opinions; attaining an ability of its own;\na fact which is startlingly shown by an occasional child \"prodigy\"\nin music or school work. And as, with our dumb animals, a child's\ninability convincingly to impart its thoughts to us, should not class\nit as ignorant.\n\nUpon this basis I am going to show you how a bunch of bright young\nfolks did find a champion; a man with boys and girls of his own; a man\nof so dominating and happy individuality that Youth is drawn to him\nas is a fly to a sugar bowl. It is a story about a small town. It is\nnot a gossipy yarn; nor is it a dry, monotonous account, full of such\ncustomary \"fill-ins\" as \"romantic moonlight casting murky shadows down\na long, winding country road.\" Nor will it say anything about tinklings\nlulling distant folds; robins carolling at twilight, nor any \"warm glow\nof lamplight\" from a cabin window. No. It is an account of up-and-doing\nactivity; a vivid portrayal of Youth as it is today; and a practical\ndiscarding of that worn-out notion that \"a child don't know anything.\"\n\nNow, any author, from history's dawn, always had that most important\naid to writing:--an ability to call upon any word in his dictionary in\nbuilding up his story. That is, our strict laws as to word construction\ndid not block his path. But in _my_ story that mighty obstruction\n_will_ constantly stand in my path; for many an important, common word\nI cannot adopt, owing to its orthography.\n\nI shall act as a sort of historian for this small town; associating\nwith its inhabitants, and striving to acquaint you with its youths,\nin such a way that you can look, knowingly, upon any child, rich\nor poor; forward or \"backward;\" your own, or John Smith's, in your\ncommunity. You will find many young minds aspiring to know how, and WHY\nsuch a thing is so. And, if a child shows curiosity in that way, how\nridiculous it is for you to snap out:--\n\n\"Oh! Don't ask about things too old for you!\"\n\nSuch a jolt to a young child's mind, craving instruction, is apt so\nto dull its avidity, as to hold it back in its school work. Try to\nlook upon a child as a small, soft young body and a rapidly growing,\nconstantly inquiring brain. It must grow to maturity slowly. Forcing a\nchild through school by constant night study during hours in which it\nshould run and play, can bring on insomnia; handicapping both brain and\nbody.\n\nNow this small town in our story had grown in just that way:--slowly;\nin fact, much _too_ slowly to stand on a par with many a thousand\nof its kind in this big, vigorous nation of ours. It was simply\nstagnating; just as a small mountain brook, coming to a hollow, might\nstop, and sink from sight, through not having a will to find a way\nthrough that obstruction; or around it. You will run across such a\ndormant town, occasionally; possibly so dormant that only outright\nisolation by a fast-moving world, will show it its folly. If you will\ntour Asia, Yucatan, or parts of Africa and Italy, you will find many\nsad ruins of past kingdoms. Go to Indo-China and visit its gigantic\nAnkhor Vat; call at Damascus, Baghdad and Samarkand. What sorrowful\nlack of ambition many such a community shows in thus discarding such\nhigh-class construction! And I say, again, that so will Youth grow\ndormant, and hold this big, throbbing world back, if no champion backs\nit up; thus providing it with an opportunity to show its ability for\nlooking forward, and improving unsatisfactory conditions.\n\nSo this small town of Branton Hills was lazily snoozing amidst\nup-and-doing towns, as Youth's Champion, John Gadsby, took hold of it;\nand shook its dawdling, flabby body until its inhabitants thought a\ntornado had struck it. Call it tornado, volcano, military onslaught,\nor what you will, this town found that it had a bunch of kids who had\nwills that would admit of no snoozing; for that is Youth, on its\nforward march of inquiry, thought and action.\n\nIf you stop to think of it, you will find that it is customary for\nour \"grown-up\" brain to cast off many of its functions of its youth;\nand to think only of what it calls \"topics of maturity.\" Amongst such\ndiscards, is many a form of happy play; many a muscular activity such\nas walking, running, climbing; thus totally missing that alluring \"joy\nof living\" of childhood. If you wish a vacation from financial affairs,\njust go out and play with Youth. Play \"blind-man's buff,\" \"hop-scotch,\"\n\"ring toss,\" and football. Go out to a charming woodland spot on a\npicnic with a bright, happy, vivacious group. Sit down at a corn roast;\na marshmallow toast; join in singing popular songs; drink a quart of\ngood, rich milk; burrow into that big lunch box; and all such things\nas banks, stocks, and family bills, will vanish on fairy wings, into\noblivion.\n\nBut this is not a claim that Man should stay always youthful. Supposing\nthat that famous Spaniard, landing upon Florida's coral strands, had\nfound that mythical Fountain of Youth; what a calamity for mankind! A\nworld without maturity of thought; without man's full-grown muscular\nability to construct mighty buildings, railroads and ships; a world\nwithout authors, doctors, savants, musicians; nothing but Youth! I can\nthink of but a solitary approval of such a condition; for such a horror\nas war would not,--could not occur; for a child is, naturally, a small\nbunch of sympathy. I know that boys will \"scrap;\" also that \"spats\"\nwill occur amongst girls; but, at such a monstrosity as killings by\nbombing towns, sinking ships, or mass annihilation of marching troops,\nchildhood would stand aghast. Not a tiny bird would fall; nor would\nany form of gun nor facility for manufacturing it, insult that almost\nHoly purity of youthful thought. Anybody who knows that wracking sorrow\nbrought upon a child by a dying puppy or cat, knows that childhood can\nshow us that our fighting, our policy of \"a tooth for a tooth,\" is\nabominably wrong.\n\nSo, now to start our story:--\n\nBranton Hills was a small town in a rich agricultural district; and\nhaving many a possibility for growth. But, through a sort of smug\nsatisfaction with conditions of long ago, had no thought of improving\nsuch important adjuncts as roads; putting up public buildings, nor\nlaying out parks; in fact a dormant, slowly dying community. So\nsatisfactory was its status that it had no form of transportation to\nsurrounding towns but by railroad, or \"old Dobbin.\" Now, any town thus\nisolating its inhabitants, will invariably find this big, busy world\npassing it by; glancing at it, curiously, as at an odd animal at a\ncircus; and, you will find, caring not a whit about its condition.\nNaturally, a town should grow. You can look upon it as a child; which,\nthrough natural conditions, should attain manhood; and add to its\nsurrounding thriving districts its products of farm, shop, or factory.\nIt should show a spirit of association with surrounding towns; crawl\nout of its lair, and find how backward it is.\n\nNow, in all such towns, you will find, occasionally, an individual born\nwith that sort of brain which, knowing that his town is backward, longs\nto start things toward improving it; not only its living conditions,\nbut adding an institution or two, such as any _city_, big or small,\nmaintains, gratis, for its inhabitants. But so forward looking a man\nfinds that trying to instill any such notions into a town's ruling body\nis about as satisfactory as butting against a brick wall. Such \"Boards\"\nas you find ruling many a small town, function from such a soporific\nrut that any hint of digging cash from its cast iron strong box with\nits big brass padlock, will fall upon minds as rigid as rock.\n\nBranton Hills _had_ such a man, to whom such rigidity was as annoying\nas a thorn in his foot. Continuous trials brought only continual\nthorn-pricks; until, finally, a brilliant plan took form as John\nGadsby found Branton Hills' High School pupils waking up to Branton\nHills' sloth. Gadsby continually found this bright young bunch asking:--\n\n\"Aw! Why is this town so slow? It's nothing but a dry twig!!\"\n\n\"Ha!\" said Gadsby; \"A dry twig! That's it! Many a living, blossoming\nbranch all around us, and this solitary dry twig, with a tag hanging\nfrom it, on which you will find: 'Branton Hills; A twig too lazy to\ngrow!'\"\n\nNow this put a \"hunch\" in Gadsby's brain, causing him to say; \"A High\nSchool pupil is not a child, now. Naturally a High School boy has not\na man's qualifications; nor has a High School girl womanly maturity.\nBut such kids, born in this swiftly moving day, think out many a notion\nwhich will work, but which would pass our dads and granddads in cold\ndisdain. Just as ships pass at night. But supposing that such ships\nshould show a light in passing; or blow a horn; or, if--if--if--By\nGolly! I'll do it!\"\n\nAnd so Gadsby sat on his blossom-bound porch on a mild Spring morning,\nthinking and smoking. Smoking can calm a man down; and his thoughts\nhad so long and so constantly clung to this plan of his that a cool\noutlook as to its promulgation was not only important, but paramount.\nSo, as his cigar was whirling and puffing rings aloft; and as groups\nof bright, happy boys and girls trod past, to school, his plan rapidly\ntook form as follows:--\n\n\"Youth! What is it? Simply a start. A start of what? Why, of that most\nastounding of all human functions; thought. But man didn't start his\nbrain working. No. All that an adult can claim is a continuation, or\nan amplification of thoughts, dormant in his youth. Although a child's\nbrain can absorb instruction with an ability far surpassing that of a\ngrown man; and, although such a young brain is bound by rigid limits,\nit contains a capacity for constantly craving additional facts. So,\nin our backward Branton Hills, I just _know_ that I can find boys and\ngirls who can show our old moss-back Town Hall big-wigs a thing or two.\nWhy! On Town Hall night, just go and sit in that room and find out just\nhow stupid and stubborn a Council, (put _into_ Town Hall, you know,\nthrough popular ballot!), can act. Say that a road is badly worn. Shall\nit stay so? Up jumps Old Bill Simpkins claiming that it is a townsman's\nduty to fix up his wagon springs if that road is too rough for him!\"\n\nAs Gadsby sat thinking thus, his plan was rapidly growing; and, in a\nmonth, was actually starting to work. How? You'll know shortly; but\nfirst, you should know this John Gadsby; a man of \"around fifty;\" a\nfamily man, and known throughout Branton Hills for his high standard of\nhonor and altruism on any kind of an occasion for public good. A loyal\nchurchman, Gadsby was a man who, though admitting that an occasional\nfault in our daily acts is bound to occur, had taught his two boys and\na pair of girls that, though folks do slip from what Scriptural authors\ncall that \"straight and narrow path,\" it will not pay to risk your own\nSoul by slipping, just so that you can laugh at your ability in staying\nout of prison; for Gadsby, having grown up in Branton Hills, could\npoint to many such man or woman. So, with such firm convictions in his\nmind, this upstanding man was constantly striving so to act that no\ncomplaint from man, woman or child should bring a word of disapproval.\nIn his mind, what a man might do was that man's affair only and could\nstain no Soul but his own. And his altruism taught that it is not\ndifficult to find many ways in which to bring joy to such as cannot,\nthrough physical disability, go out to look for it; and that only a\nsmall bit of joy, brought to a shut-in invalid will carry with it such\na warmth as can flow only from acts of human sympathy.\n\nFor many days Gadsby had thought of ways in which folks with a goodly\nbank account could aid in building up this rapidly backsliding town of\nBranton Hills. But, how to show that class what a contribution could\ndo? In this town, full of capitalists and philanthropists contributing,\noff and on, for shipping warming pans to Zulus, Gadsby saw a solution.\nIn whom? Why, in just that bunch of bright, happy school kids, back\nfrom many a visit to a _city_, and noting its ability in improving its\nliving conditions. So Gadsby thought of thus carrying an inkling to\nsuch capitalists as to how this stagnating town could claim a big spot\nupon our national map, which is now shown only in small, insignificant\nprint.\n\nAs a start, Branton Hills' \"Daily Post\" would carry a long story,\noutlining a list of factors for improving conditions. This it did; but\nit will always stay as a blot upon high minds and proud blood that not\na man or woman amongst such capitalists saw, in his plan, any call for\ndormant funds. But did that stop Gadsby? Can you stop a rising wind?\nHardly! So Gadsby took into council about forty boys of his vicinity\nand built up an Organization of Youth. Also about as many girls who had\nknown what it is, compulsorily to pass up many a picnic, or various\nforms of sport, through a lack of public park land. So this strong,\nvigorous combination of both youth and untiring activity, avidly took\nup Gadsby's plan; for nothing so stirs up a youthful mind as an\nopportunity for accomplishing anything that adults cannot do. And did\nGadsby _know_ Youth? I'll say so! His two sons and girls, now in High\nor Grammar school, had taught him a thing or two; principal amongst\nwhich was that all-dominating fact that, at a not too far distant day,\nour young folks will occupy important vocational and also political\npositions, and will look back upon this, _our_ day; smiling kindly at\nour way of doing things. So, to say that many a Branton Hills \"King of\nCapital\" got a bit huffy as a High School stripling was proving how\nstubborn a rich man is if his dollars don't aid so vast an opportunity\nfor doing good, would put it mildly! Such downright _gall_ by a\nhalf-grown kid to inform _him_; an outstanding light on Branton Hills'\ntax list, that this town was sliding down hill; and would soon land\nin an abyss of national oblivion! And our Organization girls! _How_\nBranton Hills' rich old widows and plump matrons did sniff in disdain\nas a group of High School pupils brought forth straightforward claims\nthat cash paving a road, is doing good practical work, but, in filling\nup a strong box, is worth nothing to our town.\n\nOh, that class of nabobs! How thoroughly Gadsby _did_ know its\nparsimony!! And how thoroughly did this hard-planning man know just\nwhat a constant onslaught by Youth could do. So, in about a month, his\n\"Organization\" had \"waylaid,\" so to say, practically half of Branton\nHills' cash kings; and had so won out, through that commonly known\n\"pull\" upon an adult by a child asking for what plainly is worthy,\nthat his mail brought not only cash, but two rich landlords put at his\ndisposal, tracts of land \"for any form of occupancy which can, in any\nway, aid our town.\" This land Gadsby's Organization promptly put into\ngrowing farm products for gratis distribution to Branton Hills' poor;\nand that burning craving of Youth for activity soon had it sprouting\ncorn, squash, potato, onion and asparagus crops; and, to \"doll it up a\nbit,\" put in a patch of blossoming plants.\n\nNaturally any man is happy at a satisfactory culmination of his plans\nand so, as Gadsby found that public philanthropy was but an affair\nof plain, ordinary approach, it did not call for much brain work to\nfind that, possibly also, a way might turn up for putting handicraft\ninstruction in Branton Hills' schools; for schooling, according to\nhim, did not consist only of books and black-boards. Hands also should\nknow how to construct various practical things in woodwork, plumbing,\nblacksmithing, masonry, and so forth; with thorough instruction\nin sanitation, and that most important of all youthful activity,\ngymnastics. For girls such a school could instruct in cooking, suit\nmaking, hat making, fancy work, art and loom-work; in fact, about any\nhandicraft that a girl might wish to study, and which is not in our\nstandard school curriculum. But as Gadsby thought of such a school,\nno way for backing it financially was in sight. Town funds naturally,\nshould carry it along; but town funds and Town Councils do not always\nform what you might call synonymous words. So it was compulsory that\ncash should actually \"drop into his lap,\" via a continuation of\nsolicitations by his now grandly functioning Organization of Youth.\nSo, out again trod that bunch of bright, happy kids, putting forth\nsuch plain, straightforward facts as to what Manual Training would\ndo for Branton Hills, that many saw it in that light. But you will\nalways find a group, or individual complaining that such things would\n\"automatically dawn\" on boys and girls without any training. Old Bill\nSimpkins was loud in his antagonism to what was a \"crazy plan to dip\ninto our town funds just to allow boys to saw up good wood, and girls\nto burn up good flour, trying to cook biscuits.\" Kids, according to\nhim, should go to work in Branton Hills' shopping district, and profit\nby it.\n\n\"Bah! Why not start a class to show goldfish how to waltz! _I_ didn't\ngo to any such school; and what am I now? _A Councilman!_ I can't saw a\nboard straight, nor fry a potato chip; but I can show you folks how to\nhang onto your town funds.\"\n\nOld Bill was a notorious grouch; but our Organization occasionally\ndid find a totally varying mood. Old Lady Flanagan, with four boys in\nschool, and a husband many days too drunk to work, was loud in approval.\n\n\"Whoops! Thot's phwat I calls a grand thing! Worra, worra! I wish Old\nMan Flanagan had had sich an opporchunity. But thot ignorant old clod\ndon't know nuthin' but boozin', tobacca shmokin' and ditch-diggin'. And\nyou know thot our Council ain't a-payin' for no ditch-scoopin' right\nnow. So _I'll_ shout for thot school! For my boys can find out how to\nfix thot barn door our old cow laid down against.\"\n\nHa, ha! What a circus our Organization had with such varying moods and\noutlooks! But, finally such a school was built; instructors brought in\nfrom surrounding towns; and Gadsby was as happy as a cat with a ball of\nyarn.\n\nAs Branton Hills found out what it can accomplish if it starts out with\nvigor and a will to win, our Organization thought of laying out a big\npark; furnishing an opportunity for small tots to romp and play on\ngrassy plots; a park for all sorts of sports, picnics, and so forth;\nsand lots for babyhood; cozy arbors for girls who might wish to study,\nor talk. (You might, possibly, find a girl who _can_ talk, you know!);\nalso shady nooks and winding paths for old folks who might find comfort\nin such. Gadsby thought that a park is truly a most important adjunct\nto any community; for, if a growing population has no out-door spot at\nwhich its glooms, slumps and morbid thoughts can vanish upon wings of\nsunlight, amidst bright colorings of shrubs and sky, it may sink into a\ngrouchy, fault-finding, squabbling group; and making such a showing for\nsurrounding towns as to hold back any gain in population or valuation.\nGadsby had a goodly plot of land in a grand location for a park and\nsold it to Branton Hills for a dollar; that stingy Council to lay it\nout according to his plans. And _how_ his Organization did applaud him\nfor this, his first \"solo work!\"\n\nBut schools and parks do not fulfill all of a town's calls. Many minds\nof varying kinds will long for an opportunity for finding out things\nnot ordinarily taught in school. So Branton Hills' Public Library\nwas found too small. As it was now in a small back room in our High\nSchool, it should occupy its own building; down town, and handy for\nall; and with additional thousands of books and maps. Now, if you think\nGadsby and his youthful assistants stood aghast at such a gigantic\nproposition, you just don't know Youth, as it is today. But to whom\ncould Youth look for so big an outlay as a library building would cost?\nBooks also cost; librarians and janitors draw pay. So, with light,\nwarmth, and all-round comforts, it was a task to stump a full-grown\npolitician; to say nothing of a plain, ordinary townsman and a bunch\nof kids. So Gadsby thought of taking two bright boys and two smart\ngirls to Washington, to call upon a man in a high position, who had\ngot it through Branton Hills' popular ballot. Now, any politician is a\nconvincing orator. (That is, you know, all that politics consists of!);\nand this big man, in contact with a visiting capitalist, looking for a\nhandout for his own district, got a donation of a thousand dollars. But\nthat wouldn't _start_ a public library; to say nothing of maintaining\nit. So, back in Branton Hills, again, our Organization was out, as\nusual, on its war-path.\n\nBranton Hills' philanthropy was now showing signs of monotony; so our\nOrganization had to work its linguistic ability and captivating tricks\nfull blast, until that thousand dollars had so grown that a library was\nbuilt upon a vacant lot which had grown nothing but grass; and only a\npoor quality of it, at that; and many a child and adult quickly found\nways of profitably passing odd hours.\n\nNaturally Old Bill Simpkins was snooping around, sniffing and\nsnorting at any signs of making Branton Hills \"look cityish,\" (a word\noriginating in Bill's vocabulary.)\n\n\"Huh!! _I_ didn't put in any foolish hours with books in my happy\nchildhood in this good old town! But I got along all right; and am now\nhaving my say in its Town Hall doings. Books!! Pooh! Maps! BAH!! It's\nsilly to squat in a hot room squinting at a lot of print! If you want\nto know about a thing, go to work in a shop or factory of that kind,\nand find out about it first-hand.\"\n\n\"But, Bill,\" said Gadsby, \"shops want a man who knows what to do\nwithout having to stop to train him.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all bosh! If a boss shows a man what a tool is for; and\nif that man is any good, at all, why bring up this stuff you call\ntraining? That man grabs a tool, works 'til noon; knocks off for an\nhour; works 'til----\"\n\nAt this point in Bill's blow-up an Italian Councilman was passing, and\nput in his oar, with:--\n\n\"Ha, Bill! You thinka your man can worka all right, firsta day, huh?\nYou talka crazy so much as a fool! I laugha tinkin' of you startin' on\na patcha for my boota! You lasta just a half hour. Thisa library all\nrighta. This town too mucha what I call tight-wad!\"\n\nOh, hum!! It's a tough job making old dogs do tricks. But our\nOrganization was now holding almost daily sittings, and soon a\nbright girl thought of having band music in that now popular park.\nAnd _what_ do you think that stingy Council did? It actually built a\nmost fantastic band-stand; got a contract with a first-class band,\nand all without so much as a Councilman fainting away!! So, finally,\non a hot July Sunday, two solid hours of grand harmony brought joy\nto many a poor Soul who had not for many a day, known that balm of\ncomfort which can \"air out our brains' dusty corridors,\" and bring\nsuch happy thrills, as Music, that charming Fairy, which knows no\nhuman words, can bring. Around that gaudy band-stand, at two-thirty\non that first Sunday, sat or stood as happy a throng of old and young\nas any man could wish for; and Gadsby and his \"gang\" got hand-clasps\nand hand-claps, from all. A good band, you know, not only can stir and\nthrill you; for it can play a soft crooning lullaby, a lilting waltz or\npolka; or, with its wood winds, bring forth old songs of our childhood,\nballads of courting days, or hymns and carols of Christmas; and can\nsuit all sorts of folks, in all sorts of moods; for a Spaniard,\nDutchman or Russian can find similar joy with a man from Italy, Norway\nor far away Brazil.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nBy now, Branton Hills was so proud of not only its \"smarting up,\" but\nalso of its startling growth, on that account, that an application was\nput forth for its incorporation as a city; a small city, naturally,\nbut full of that condition of Youth, known as \"growing pains.\" So its\nshabby old \"Town Hall\" sign was thrown away, and a black and gold onyx\nslab, with \"CITY HALL\" blazing forth in vivid colors, put up, amidst\nband music, flag waving, parading and oratory. In only a month from\nthat glorious day, Gadsby found folks \"primping up\"; girls putting on\nbright ribbons; boys finding that suits could stand a good ironing;\nand rich widows and portly matrons almost out-doing any rainbow in\nbrilliancy. An occasional shop along Broadway, which had a rattly door\nor shaky windows was put into first class condition, to fit Branton\nHills' status as a city. Old Bill Simpkins was strutting around, as\npompous as a drum-major; for, now, that old Town Council would function\nas a CITY council; HIS council! His own stamping ground! According to\nhim, from it, at no far day, \"Bill Simpkins, City Councilman,\" would\nshow an anxiously waiting world how to run a city; though probably, I\nthink, how _not_ to run it.\n\nIt is truly surprising what a narrow mind, what a blind outlook a man,\nbrought up with practically no opposition to his boyhood wants, can\nattain; though brought into contact with indisputably important data\nfor improving his city. Our Organization boys thought Bill \"a bit off;\"\nbut Gadsby would only laugh at his blasts against paying out city\nfunds; for, you know, all bombs don't burst; you occasionally find a\n\"dud.\"\n\nBut this furor for fixing up rattly doors or shaky windows didn't last;\nfor Old Bill's oratory found favor with a bunch of his old tight-wads,\nwho actually thought of inaugurating a campaign against Gadsby's\nOrganization of Youth. As soon as this was known about town, that\nmythical pot, known as Public Opinion, was boiling furiously. A vast\nmajority stood back of Gadsby and his kids; so, old Bill's ranks could\ncount only on a small group of rich old Shylocks to whom a bank-book\nwas a thing to look into or talk about only annually; that is, on\nbank-balancing days. This small minority got up a slogan:--\"Why Spoil\na Good Old Town?\" and actually did, off and on, talk a shopman out of\nfixing up his shop or grounds. This, you know, put additional vigor\ninto our Organization; inspiring a boy to bring up a plan for calling\na month,--say July,--\"pick-up, paint-up and wash-up month;\" for it was\na plain fact that, all about town, was many a shabby spot; a lot of\nbuildings could stand a good coat of paint, and yards raking up; thus\nshowing surrounding towns that not only _could_ Branton Hills \"doll\nup,\" but had a class of inhabitants who gladly would go at such a plan,\nand carry it through. So Gadsby got his \"gang\" out, to sally forth and\nany man or woman who did not jump, at first, at such a plan by vigorous\nYouth, was always brought around, through noticing how poorly a shabby\nyard did look. So Gadsby put in Branton Hills' \"Post\" this stirring\ncall:--\n\n\"Raking up your yard or painting your building is simply improving it\nboth in worth; artistically and from a utilization standpoint. I know\nthat many a city front lawn is small; but, if it is only fairly big,\na walk, cut curvingly, will add to it, surprisingly. That part of a\nwalk which runs to your front door could show rows of small rocks rough\nand natural; and grading from small to big; but _no_ 'hit-or-miss'\nlayout. You can so fix up your yard as to form an approach to unity in\nplan with such as adjoin you; though without actual duplication; thus\nproviding harmony for all who may pass by. It is, in fact, but a bit\nof City Planning; and anybody who aids in such work is a most worthy\ninhabitant. So, _cut_ your scraggly lawns! _Trim_ your old, shaggy\nshrubs! Bring into artistic form, your grass-grown walks!\"\n\n(Now, naturally, in writing such a story as this, with its conditions\nas laid down in its Introduction, it is not surprising that an\noccasional \"rough spot\" in composition is found. So I trust that a\ncritical public will hold constantly in mind that I am voluntarily\navoiding words containing that symbol which is, _by far_, of most\ncommon inclusion in writing our Anglo-Saxon as it is, today. Many of\nour most common words cannot show; so I must adopt synonyms; and so\ntwist a thought around as to say what I wish with as much clarity as I\ncan.)\n\nSo, now to go on with this odd contraption:\n\nBy Autumn, a man who took his vacation in July, would hardly know his\ntown upon coming back, so thoroughly had thousands \"dug in\" to aid in\nits transformation.\n\n\"Boys,\" said Gadsby, \"you can pat your own backs, if you can't find\nanybody to do it for you. This city is proud of you. And, girls, just\nsing with joy; for not only is your city proud of you, but I am, too.\"\n\n\"But how about you, sir, and your work?\"\n\nThis was from Frank; a boy brought up to think fairly on all things.\n\"Oh,\" said Gadsby laughingly, \"I didn't do much of anything but boss\nyou young folks around. If our Council awards any diplomas, I don't\nwant any. I would look ridiculous strutting around with a diploma with\na pink ribbon on it, now wouldn't I!\"\n\nThis talk of diplomas was as a bolt from a bright sky to this young,\nhustling bunch. But, though Gadsby's words did sound as though a grown\nman wouldn't want such a thing, that wasn't saying that a young boy or\ngirl wouldn't; and with this surprising possibility ranking in young\nminds, many a kid was in an anti-soporific condition for parts of many\na night.\n\nBut a kindly Councilman actually did bring up a bill about this diploma\naffair, and his collaborators put it through; which naturally brought\nup talk as how to award such diplomas. At last it was thought that a\nbig public affair at City Hall, with our Organization on a platform,\nwith Branton Hills' Mayor and Council, would furnish an all-round,\nsatisfactory way.\n\nSuch an occasion was worthy of a lot of planning; and a first thought\nwas for flags and bunting on all public buildings; with a grand\nillumination at night. Stationary lights should glow from all points\non which a light could stand, hang, or swing; and gigantic rays should\nswoop and swish across clouds and sky. Bands should play; boys and\ngirls march and sing; and a vast crowd would pour into City Hall. As on\nsimilar occasions, a bad rush for chairs was apt to occur, a company\nof military units should occupy all important points, to hold back\nanything simulating a jam.\n\nNow, if you think our Organization wasn't all agog and wild, with\nyouthful anticipation at having a diploma for work out of school\nhours, you just don't know Youth. Boys and girls, though not full\ngrown inhabitants of a city, do know what will add to its popularity;\nand having had a part in bringing about such conditions, it was but\nnatural to look back upon such, as any military man might at winning a\ndifficult fight.\n\nSo, finally our big day was at hand! That it might not cut into school\nhours, it was on a Saturday; and, by noon, about a thousand kids,\nsinging, shouting and waving flags, stood in formation at City Park,\nawaiting, with growing thrills, a signal which would start as big a\nturn-out as Branton Hills had known in all its history. Up at City\nHall awaiting arrivals of city officials, a big crowd sat; row upon\nrow of chairs which not only took up all floor room, but also many a\nsmall spot, in door-way or on a balcony in which a chair or stool could\nfind footing; and all who could not find such an opportunity willingly\nstood in back. Just as a group of officials sat down on that flag-bound\nplatform, distant throbbing of drums, and bright, snappy band music\ntold of Branton Hills' approaching thousands of kids, who, finally\nmarching in through City Hall's main door, stood in a solid mass around\nthat big room.\n\nNaturally Gadsby had to put his satisfaction into words; and, advancing\nto a mahogany stand, stood waiting for a storm of hand-clapping and\nshouts to quit, and said:--\n\n\"Your Honor, Mayor of Branton Hills, its Council, and all you out in\nfront:--If you would only stop rating a child's ability by your own;\nand try to find out just _what_ ability a child has, our young folks\nthroughout this big world would show a surprisingly willing disposition\nto try things which would bring your approbation. A child's brain is an\nastonishing thing. It has, in its construction, an astounding capacity\nfor absorbing what is brought to it; and not only to think about, but\nto find ways for improving it. It is today's child who, tomorrow,\nwill, you know, laugh at our ways of doing things. So, in putting\nacross this campaign of building up our community into a municipality\nwhich has won acclaim, not only from its officials and inhabitants,\nbut from surrounding towns I found, in our young folks, an out-and-out\ninclination to assist; and you, today, can look upon it as labor in\nwhich your adult aid was but a small factor. So now, my Organization of\nYouth, if you will pass across this platform, your Mayor will hand you\nyour diplomas.\"\n\nNot in all Branton Hills' history had any boy or girl known such a\nthrill as upon winning that hard-won roll! And from solid banks of\nhumanity roars of congratulation burst forth. As soon as Mayor Brown\nshook hands (and such tiny, warm, soft young hands, too!) with all, a\nbig out-door lunch was found waiting on a charming lawn back of City\nHall; and this was no World War mobilization lunch of doughnuts and a\nhot dog sandwich; but, as two of Gadsby's sons said, was \"an all-round,\ngood, big fill-up;\" and many a boy's and girl's \"tummy\" was soon as\nround and taut as a balloon.\n\nAs twilight was turning to dusk, boys in an adjoining lot shot skyward\na crashing bomb, announcing a grand illumination as a fitting climax\nfor so glorious a day; and thousands sat on rock-walls, grassy knolls,\nin cars or at windows, with a big crowd standing along curbs and\ncrosswalks. Myriads of lights of all colors, in solid balls, sprays,\nsparkling fountains, and bursts of glory, shot, in criss-cross paths,\nup and down, back and forth, across a star-lit sky; providing a display\nwithout a par in local annals.\n\nBut not only did Youth thrill at so fantastic a show. Adults had many a\nFourth of July brought back from a distant past; in which our national\ncustom wound up our most important holiday with a similar display;\nonly, in our Fourths of long ago, horrifying, gigantic concussions\nwould disturb old folks and invalids until midnight; at which hour,\naccording to law, all such carrying-on must stop. But did it? Possibly\nin _your_ town, but not around _my_ district! All Fourth of July\noutfits don't always function at first, you know; and no kid, (or\nadult!) would think of quitting until that last pop should pop; or that\nlast bang should bang. And so, many a dawn on July fifth found things\nstill going, full blast.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nYouth cannot stay for long in a condition of inactivity; and so, for\nonly about a month did things so stand, until a particularly bright\ngirl in our Organization, thought out a plan for caring for infants of\nfolks who had to go out, to work; and this bright kid soon had a group\nof girls who would join, during vacation, in voluntarily giving up four\ndays a month to such work. With about fifty girls collaborating, all\ndistricts had this most gracious aid; and a girl would not only watch\nand guard, but would also instruct, as far as practical, any such tot\nas had not had its first schooling. Such work by young girls still\nin school was a grand thing; and Gadsby not only stood up for such\nloyalty, but got at his boys to find a similar plan; and soon had a\nfull troop of Boy Scouts; uniforms and all. This automatically brought\nabout a Girl Scout unit; and, through a collaboration of both, a form\nof club sprang up. It was a club in which any boy or girl of a family\nowning a car would call mornings for pupils having no cars, during\nschool days, for a trip to school and back. This was not only a saving\nin long walks for many, but also took from a young back, that hard,\ntiring strain from lugging such armfuls of books as you find pupils\nlaboriously carrying, today. Upon arriving at a school building, many\ncars would unload so many books that Gadsby said:--\n\n\"You would think that a Public Library branch was moving in!\" This car\nwork soon brought up a thought of giving similar aid to ailing adults;\nwho, not owning a car, could not know of that vast display of hill and\nplain so common to a majority of our townsfolks. So a plan was laid, by\nwhich a car would call two days a month; and for an hour or so, follow\nroads winding out of town and through woods, farm lands and suburbs;\nshowing distant ponds, and that grand arch of sky which \"shut-ins\"\nknow only from photographs. Ah; _how_ that plan did stir up joyous\nanticipation amongst such as thus had an opportunity to call upon old,\nloving pals, and talk of old customs and past days! Occasionally such a\ntalk would last so long that a youthful motorist, waiting dutifully at\na curb, thought that a full family history of both host and visitor was\nup for an airing. But old folks always _will_ talk and it will not do a\nboy or girl any harm to wait; for, you know, that boy or girl will act\nin just that way, at a not too far-off day!\n\nBut, popular as this touring plan was, it had to stop; for school\nagain took all young folks from such out-door activity. Nobody was so\nsorry at this as Gadsby, for though Branton Hills' suburban country is\nglorious from March to August, it is also strong in its attractions\nthroughout Autumn, with its artistic colorings of fruits, pumpkins,\ncorn-shocks, hay-stacks and Fall blossoms. So Gadsby got a big\nmotor-coach company to run a bus a day, carrying, gratis, all poor or\nsickly folks who had a doctor's affidavit that such an outing would aid\nin curing ills arising from too constant in-door living; and so, up\nalmost to Thanksgiving, this big coach ran daily.\n\nAs Spring got around again, this \"man-of-all-work\" thought of driving\naway a shut-in invalid's monotony by having musicians go to such rooms,\nto play; or, by taking along a vocalist or trio, sing such old songs\nas always bring back happy days. This work Gadsby thought of paying\nfor by putting on a circus. And _was_ it a circus? _It was!!_ It had\nboys forming both front and hind limbs of animals totally unknown to\nzoology; girls strutting around as gigantic birds of also doubtful\norigin; an array of small living animals such as trick dogs and goats,\na dancing pony, a group of imitation Indians, cowboys, cowgirls, a\nkicking trick jack-ass; and, talk about clowns! Forty boys got into\nbaggy pantaloons and fools' caps; and no circus, including that first\nof all shows in Noah's Ark, had so much going on. Gymnasts from our\nschool gymnasium, tumbling, jumping and racing; comic dancing; a clown\nband; high-swinging artists, and a funny cop who didn't wait to find\nout who a man was, but hit him anyway. And, as no circus _is_ a circus\nwithout boys shouting wildly about pop-corn and cold drinks, Gadsby saw\nto it that such boys got in as many patrons' way as any ambitious youth\ncould; and that is \"going strong,\" if you know boys, at all!\n\nBut what about profits? It not only paid for all acts which his\nOrganization couldn't put on, but it was found that a big fund for many\na day's musical visitations, was on hand.\n\nAnd, now a word or two about municipal affairs in this city; or _any_\ncity, in which nobody will think of doing anything about its poor\nand sick, without a vigorous prodding up. City Councils, now-a-days,\nwillingly grant big appropriations for paving, lights, schools, jails,\ncourts, and so on; but invariably fight shy of charity; which is\nnothing but sympathy for anybody who is \"down and out.\" No man can\nsay that Charity will not, during coming days, aid _him_ in supporting\nhis family; and it was Gadsby's claim that _humans_:--_not blocks of\nbuildings_, form what Mankind calls a city. But what would big, costly\nbuildings amount to, if all who work in such cannot maintain that good\nphysical condition paramount in carrying on a city's various forms of\nlabor? And not only _physical_ good, but also a mind happy from lack of\nworry and of that stagnation which always follows a monotonous daily\ngrind. So our Organization was soon out again, agitating City Officials\nand civilians toward building a big Auditorium in which all kinds of\nshows and sports could occur, with also a swimming pool and hot and\ncold baths. Such a building cannot so much as start without financial\nbacking; but gradually many an iron-bound bank account was drawn upon\n(much as you pull a tooth!), to buy bonds. Also, such a building won't\ngrow up in a night; nor was a spot upon which to put it found without\na lot of agitation; many wanting it in a down-town district; and also,\nmany who had vacant land put forth all sorts of claims to obtain cash\nfor lots upon which a big tax was paid annually, without profits. But\nall such things automatically turn out satisfactorily to a majority;\nthough an ugly, grasping landlord who lost out, would viciously squawk\nthat \"municipal graft\" was against him.\n\nNow Gadsby was vigorously against graft; not only in city affairs but\nin any kind of transaction; and that stab brought forth such a flow of\noratory from him, that as voting for Mayor was soon to occur, it, and a\nlong list of good works, soon had him up for that position. But Gadsby\ndidn't want such a nomination; still, thousands of townsfolks who had\nknown him from childhood, would not hark to anything but his candidacy;\nand, soon, on window cards, signs, and flags across Broadway, was\nhis photograph and \"GADSBY FOR MAYOR;\" and a campaign was on which\nstill rings in Branton Hills' history as \"hot stuff!\" Four aspiring\npoliticians ran in opposition; and, as all had good backing, and Gadsby\nonly his public works to fall back on, things soon got looking gloomy\nfor him. His antagonists, standing upon soap box, auto truck, or\nhastily built platforms, put forth, with prodigious vim, claims that\n\"our fair city will go back to its original oblivion if _I_ am not its\nMayor!\" But our Organization now took a hand, most of which, now out of\nHigh School, was growing up rapidly; and anybody who knows anything at\nall about Branton Hills' history, knows that, if this band of bright,\nloyal pals of Gadsby's was out to attain a goal, it was mighty apt to\nstart things humming. To say that Gadsby's rivals got a bad jolt as\nit got around town that his \"bunch of warriors\" was aiding him, would\nput it but mildly. _Two quit instantly_, saying that this is a day of\nYouth and no adult has half a show against it! But two still hung on;\nclinging to a sort of fond fantasy that Gadsby, not naturally a public\nsort of man, might voluntarily drop out. But, had Gadsby so much as\nthought of such an action, his Organization would quickly laugh it to\nscorn.\n\n\"Why, good gracious!\" said Frank Morgan, \"if _anybody_ should sit in\nthat Mayor's chair in City Hall, it's you! Just look at what you did to\nboost Branton Hills! Until you got it a-going it had but two thousand\ninhabitants; now it has sixty thousand! And just ask your rivals to\npoint to any part of it that you didn't build up. Look at our Public\nLibrary, municipal band, occupational class rooms; auto and bus trips;\nand your circus which paid for music for sick folks. With you as Mayor,\n_boy!_ What an opportunity to boss and swing things your own way! Why,\nanything you might say is as good as law; and----\"\n\n\"Now, hold on, boy!\" said Gadsby, \"a Mayor can't boss things in any\nsuch a way as you think. A Mayor has a Council, which has to pass on\nall bills brought up; and, my boy, upon arriving at manhood, you'll\nfind that a Mayor who _can_ boss a Council around, is a most uncommon\nbird. And as for a Mayor's word amounting to a law, it's a mighty good\nthing that it can't! Why, a Mayor can't do much of anything, today,\nFrank, without a bunch of crazy bat-brains stirring up a rumpus about\nhis acts looking 'suspiciously shady.' Now that is a bad condition in\nwhich to find a city, Frank. You boys don't know anything about graft;\nbut as you grow up you will find many flaws in a city's laws; but also\nmany points thoroughly good and fair. Just try to think what a city\nwould amount to if a solitary man could control its law making, as a\nKing or Sultan of old. That was why so many millions of inhabitants\nwould start wars and riots against a tyrant; for many a King _was_ a\ntyrant, Frank, and had no thought as to how his laws would suit his\nthousands of rich and poor. A law that might suit a rich man, might\nwork all kinds of havoc with a poor family.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Frank, \"why should a King pass a law that would dissatisfy\nanybody?\"\n\nGadsby's parry to this rising youthful ambition for light on political\naffairs was:--\n\n\"Why will a duck go into a pond?\" and Frank found that though a growing\nyoung man might know a thing or two, making laws for a city was a man's\njob.\n\nSo, with a Mayoralty campaign on his hands, plus planning for that big\nauditorium, Gadsby was as busy as a fly around a syrup jug; for a mass\nof campaign mail had to go out; topics for orations thought up; and\ncontacts with his now truly important Organization of Youth, took so\nmany hours out of his days that his family hardly saw him, at all. Noon\nnaturally stood out as a good opportunity for oratory, as thousands,\nout for lunch, would stop, in passing. But, also, many a hall rang with\nplaudits as an antagonist won a point; but many a throng saw Gadsby's\ngood points, and plainly told him so by turning out voluminously at any\npoint at which his oratory was to flow. It was truly miraculous how\nthis man of shy disposition, found words in putting forth his plans for\nimproving Branton Hills, town of his birth. Many an orator has grown\nup from an unassuming individual who had things worth saying; and who,\nthrough that curious facility which is born of a conviction that his\nplans had a practical basis, won many a ballot against such prolific\nflows of high-sounding words as his antagonists had in stock. Many a\nnight Gadsby was \"all in,\" as his worn-out body and an aching throat\nsought his downy couch. No campaign is a cinch.\n\nWith so many minds amongst a city's population, just that many calls\nfor this or that swung back and forth until that most important of all\ndays,--voting day, was at hand. What crowds, mobs and jams did assail\nall polling booths, casting ballots to land a party-man in City Hall!\nIf a voting booth was in a school building, as is a common custom\npupils had that day off; and, as Gadsby was Youth's champion, groups of\nkids hung around, watching and hoping with that avidity so common with\nyouth, that Gadsby would win by a majority unknown in Branton Hills.\nAnd Gadsby did!\n\nAs soon as it was shown by official count, Branton Hills was a riot,\nfrom City Hall to City limits; throngs tramping around, tossing hats\naloft; for a hard-working man had won what many thousands thought was\nfair and just.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nAs soon as Gadsby's inauguration had put him in a position to do things\nwith authority, his first act was to start things moving on that big\nauditorium plan, for which many capitalists had bought bonds. Again\npublic opinion had a lot to say as to how such a building should look,\nwhat it should contain; how long, how high, how costly; with a long\nstring of ifs and buts.\n\nFamily upon family put forth claims for rooms for public forums in\nwhich various thoughts upon world affairs could find opportunity for\ndiscussion; Salvation Army officials thought that a big hall for a\npublic Sunday School class would do a lot of good; and that, lastly,\nwhat I must, from this odd yarn's strict orthography, call a \"film\nshow,\" should, without doubt occupy a part of such a building. Anyway,\ntalk or no talk, Gadsby said that it should stand as a building for\nman, woman and child; rich or poor; and, barring its \"film show,\"\nwithout cost to anybody. Branton Hills' folks could thus swim, do\ngymnastics, talk on public affairs, or \"just sit and gossip\", at will.\nSo it was finally built in a charming park amidst shrubs and blossoms;\nan additional honor for Gadsby.\n\nBut such buildings as Branton Hills now had could not fulfill all\nfunctions of so rapidly growing a city; for you find, occasionally, a\nclass of folks who cannot afford a doctor, if ill. This was brought up\nby a girl of our Organization, Doris Johnson, who, on Christmas Day, in\ntaking gifts to a poor family, had found a woman critically ill, and\nwith no funds for aid or comforts; and instantly, in Doris' quick young\nmind a vision of a big city hospital took form; and, on a following day\nGadsby had his Organization at City Hall, to \"just talk,\" (and you know\nhow that bunch _can_ talk!) to a Councilman or two.\n\nNow, if any kind of a building in all this big world costs good, hard\ncash to build, and furnish, it is a hospital; and it is also a building\nwhich a public knows nothing about. So Mayor Gadsby saw that if his\nCouncil would pass an appropriation for it, no such squabbling as had\nstruck his Municipal Auditorium plan, would occur. But Gadsby forgot\nBranton Hills' landlords, all of whom had \"a most glorious spot,\" just\nright for a hospital; until, finally, a group of physicians was told to\nlook around. And did Branton Hills' landlords call upon Branton Hills'\nphysicians? I'll say so!! Anybody visiting town, not knowing what was\ngoing on, would think that vacant land was as common as raindrops in a\ncloudburst. Small plots sprang into public light which couldn't hold a\npoultry barn, to say nothing of a big City Hospital. But no grasping\nlandlord can fool physicians in talking up a hospital location, so it\nwas finally built, on high land, with a charming vista across Branton\nHills' suburbs and distant hills; amongst which Gadsby's charity auto\nand bus trips took so many happy invalids on past hot days.\n\nNow it is only fair that our boys and girls of this famous Organization\nof Youth, should walk forward for an introduction to you. So I will\nbring forth such bright and loyal girls as Doris Johnson, Dorothy\nFitts, Lucy Donaldson, Marian Hopkins, Priscilla Standish, Abigail\nWorthington, Sarah Young, and Virginia Adams. Amongst the boys, cast\na fond look upon Arthur Rankin, Frank Morgan, John Hamilton, Paul\nJohnson, Oscar Knott and William Snow; as smart a bunch of Youth as you\ncould find in a month of Sundays.\n\nAs soon as our big hospital was built and functioning, Sarah Young\nand Priscilla Standish, in talking with groups of girls, had found\na longing for a night-school, as so many folks had to work all day,\nso couldn't go to our Manual Training School. So Mayor Gadsby took\nit up with Branton Hills' School Board. Now school boards do not\nalways think in harmony with Mayors and Councils; in fact, what with\nschool boards, Councils, taxation boards, paving contractors, Sunday\nclosing-hour agitations, railway rights of way, and all-round political\n\"mud-slinging,\" a Mayor has a tough job.\n\nTwo of Gadsby's School Board said \"NO!!\" A right out-loud, slam-bang\nbig \"NO!!\" Two thought that a night school was a good thing; but four,\nwith a faint glow of financial wisdom, (a rarity in politics, today!)\nsaw no cash in sight for such an institution.\n\nBut Gadsby's famous Organization won again! Branton Hills did not\ncontain a family in which this Organization wasn't known; and many a\nsock was brought out from hiding, and many a sofa pillow cut into, to\naid _any_ plan in which this group had a part.\n\nBut, just as funds had grown to what Mayor Gadsby thought would fill\nall such wants, a row in Council as to this fund's application got so\nhot that \"His Honor\" got mad; _mighty mad!!_ And said:--\n\n\"Why is it that any bill for appropriations coming up in this Council\nhas to kick up such a rumpus? Why can't you look at such things with a\npublic mind; for nothing can so aid toward passing bills as harmony.\nThis city is not holding off an attacking army. Branton Hills is not\na pack of wild animals, snapping and snarling by day; jumping, at a\ncrackling twig, at night. It is a city of _humans_; animals, if you\nwish, but with a gift from On High of a _brain_, so far apart from all\ndumb animals as to allow us to talk about our public affairs calmly and\nthoughtfully. All this Night School rumpus is foolish. Naturally, what\nis taught in such a school is an important factor; so I want to find\nout from our Organization----\"\n\nAt this point, old Bill Simpkins got up, with:\n\n\"This Organization of Youth stuff puts a kink in my spinal column!\nAlmost all of it is through school. So how can you bring such a group\nforward as 'pupils?'\"\n\n\"A child,\" said Gadsby, \"who had such schooling as Branton Hills\naffords is, naturally, still a pupil; for many will follow up a study\nif an opportunity is at hand. Many adults also carry out a custom\nof brushing up on unfamiliar topics; thus, also, ranking as pupils.\nPossibly, Bill, if you would look up that word 'pupil,' you wouldn't\nfind so much fault with insignificant data.\"\n\n\"All right!\" was Simpkins' snap-back; \"but what I want to know is,\nwhat our big Public Library is for. Your 'pupils' can find all sorts\nof information in that big building. So why build a night school? It's\nnothing but a duplication!\"\n\n\"A library,\" said Gadsby, \"is not a school. It has no instructors; you\ncannot talk in its rooms. You may find a book or two on your study, or\nyou may not. You would find it a big handicap if you think that you can\naccomplish much with no aid but that of a Public Library. Young folks\nknow what young folks want to study. It is foolish, say, to install a\nclass in Astronomy, for although it _is_ a 'Night School,' its pupils'\nthoughts might not turn toward Mars, Saturn or shooting stars; but\nshorthand, including training for typists amongst adults who, naturally\ndon't go to day schools, is most important, today; also History and\nCorporation Law; and I know that a study of Music would attract many.\nAny man or woman who works all day, but still wants to study at night,\nshould find an opportunity for doing so.\"\n\nThis put a stop to Councilman Simpkins' criticisms, and approval was\nput upon Gadsby's plan; and it was but shortly that this school's\npopularity was shown in a most amusing way. Branton Hills folks, in\npassing it on going out for a show or social call, caught most savory\nwhiffs, as its cooking class was producing doughnuts and biscuits;\nfor a Miss Chapman, long famous as a cook for Branton Hills' Woman's\nClub, had about forty girls finding out about that magic art. So, too,\noccasionally a cranky old Councilman, who had fought against \"this\nfoolish night school proposition,\" would pass by; and, oh, hum!! A\nCouncilman is only an animal, you know; and, on cooking class nights,\nsuch an animal, unavoidably drawn by that wafting aroma, would go in,\njust a bit humiliatingly, and, in praising Miss Chapman for doing \"such\nimportant work for our young girls,\" would avidly munch a piping hot\nbiscuit or a sizzling doughnut from a young girl's hand, who, a month\nago, couldn't fry a slab of bacon without burning it.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nJust as Gadsby was thinking nothing was now lacking in Branton Hills, a\nchild in a poor family got typhoid symptoms from drinking from a small\nbrook at a picnic and, without any aid from our famous Organization,\na public clamor was forthcoming for Municipal District Nursing, as\nso many folks look with horror at going to a hospital. Now District\nNursing calls for no big appropriation; just salary, a first-aid\noutfit, a supply of drugs and so forth; and, now-a-days, a car. And,\nto Branton Hills' honor four girls who had had nursing training soon\nbrought, not only small comforts, but important ministrations to a\ngoodly part of our population. In districts without this important\nmunicipal function, common colds may run into long-drawn-out attacks;\nand contagion can not only shut up a school or two but badly handicap\nall forms of public activity.\n\n\"Too many small towns,\" said Gadsby, \"try to go without public nursing;\ncalling it foolish, and claiming that a family ought to look out for\nits own sick. BUT! Should a high mortality, such as this Nation HAS\nknown, occur again, such towns will frantically broadcast a call for\ngirls with nursing training; and wish that a silly, cash-saving custom\nhadn't brought such critical conditions.\"\n\nAt this point I want to bring forward an individual who has had a big\npart in Branton Hills' growth; but who, up to now, has not shown up in\nthis history. You know that Gadsby had a family, naturally including a\nwoman; and that woman was fondly and popularly known throughout town\nas Lady Gadsby; a rank fittingly matching Gadsby's \"His Honor,\" upon\nhis inauguration as Mayor. Lady Gadsby was strongly in favor of all\nkinds of clubs or associations; organizing a most worthy Charity Club,\na Book Club and a Political Auxiliary. It was but a natural growth from\nWoman's part in politics, both municipal and National; and which, in\nmany a city, has had much to say toward nominations of good officials,\nand running many a crook out of town; for no crook, nor \"gang boss\" can\nhold out long if up against a strong Woman's Club. Though it was long\nthought that woman's brain was minor in comparison with man's, woman,\nas a class, now-a-day shows an all-round activity; and has brought\nstaid control to official actions which had had a long run through\ndomination by man;--that proud, cocky, strutting animal who thinks that\nthis gigantic world should hop, skip and jump at his commands. So,\nfrom, or through just such clubs as Lady Gadsby's, Branton Hills was\nsoon attracting folks from surrounding districts; in fact, it was known\nas a sort of Fairyland in which all things turn out satisfactorily.\nThis was, plainly, a condition which would call for much additional\nbuilding; which also brings additional tax inflow; so Branton Hills was\nrapidly growing into a most important community. So, at a School Board\nlunch, His Honor said:--\n\n\"I trust that now you will admit that what I said long ago about making\na city an attraction to tourists, is bringing daily confirmation. Oh,\nwhat a lot of politically blind city and town officials I could point\nout within a day's auto trip from Branton Hills! Many such an official,\nupon winning a foothold in City Hall, thinks only of his own cohorts,\nand his own gain. So it is not surprising that public affairs grow\nstagnant. Truly, I cannot fathom such minds! I can think of nothing so\nsatisfying as doing public good in as many ways as an official can.\nThink, for an instant, as to just what a city is. As I said long ago,\nit is _not_ an array of buildings, parks and fountains. No. A city is a\nliving thing! It is, actually, _human_; for it is a group of humanity\ngrowing up in daily contact; and if officials adopt as a slogan, \"all\nI can do,\" and not \"all I can grab,\" only its suburban boundary can\nlimit its growth. Branton Hills attracts thousands, annually. All\nof that influx looks for comforts, an opportunity to work, and good\nschools. Branton Hills has all that; and I want to say that all who\nvisit us, with thoughts of joining us, will find us holding out a glad\nhand; promising that all such fond outlooks will find confirmation at\nany spot within cannon-shot of City Hall.\"\n\nAt this point, a woman from just such a group got up, saying:--\n\n\"I want to back up your mayor. On my first visit to your charming city\nI saw an opportunity for my family; and, with woman's famous ability\nfor arguing, I got my husband to think as I do; and not an hour from\nthat day has brought us any dissatisfaction. Your schools stand high in\ncomparison with any out our way; your shops carry first-class goods,\nyour laws act without favoritism for anybody or class; and an air of\nhappy-go-lucky conditions actually shouts at you, from all parts of\ntown.\"\n\nNow, as months slid past it got around to Night School graduation day;\nand as it was this institution's first, all Branton Hills was on hand,\npacking its big hall. An important part was a musical half-hour by\nits big chorus, singing such grand compositions as arias from Faust,\nRobin Hood, Aida, and Martha; also both boys' and girls' bands, both\nbrass and strings, doing first-class work on a Sousa march, a Strauss\nwaltz, and a potpourri of National airs from many lands, which brought\na storm of hand clapping; for no form of study will so aid youth in\nliving happily, as music. Ability to play or sing; to know what is good\nor poor in music, instills into young folks a high quality of thought;\nand, accuracy is found in its rigidity of rhythm.\n\nAs soon as this music class was through, Gadsby brought forth soloists,\nduos and trios; violinists, pianists, and so many young musicians that\nBranton Hills was as proud of its night school as a girl is of \"that\nfirst diamond.\" That brought our program around to introducing pupils\nwho had won honor marks: four girls in knitting, oil painting, cooking\nand journalism; and four smart youths in brass work, wood-carving and\nCorporation law. But pupils do not form all of a school body; so a\ngroup of blushing instructors had to bow to an applauding roomful.\n\nThough this was a school graduation, Mayor Gadsby said it would do no\nharm to point out a plan for still adding to Branton Hills' public\nspirit:--\n\n\"This town is too plain; too dingy. Brick walls and asphalt paving\ndo not light up a town, but dim it. So I want to plant all kinds of\ngrowing things along many of our curbs. In our parks I want ponds\nwith gold fish, fancy ducks and big swans; row-boats, islands with\narbors, and lots of shrubs _that blossom_; not just an array of twigs\nand stalks. I want, in our big City Park, a casino, dancing pavilion,\nlunch rooms; and parking for as many cars as can crowd in. So I think\nthat all of us ought to pitch in and put a bright array of natural aids\nround about; both in our shopping district and suburbs; for you know\nthat old saying, that 'a charming thing is a joy always.'\"\n\nSo a miraculous transformation of any spot at all dull was soon a fact.\nOak, birch and poplar saplings stood along curbs and around railway\nstations; girls brought in willow twigs, ivy roots, bulbs of canna,\ndahlia, calladium, tulip, jonquil, gladiola and hyacinth. Boys also dug\nmany woodland shrubs which, standing along railway tracks, out of town,\ntook away that gloomy vista so commonly found upon approaching a big\ncity; and a long grassplot, with a rim of boxwood shrubs, was laid out,\nhalf way from curb to curb on Broadway, in Branton Hills' financial\ndistrict. As Gadsby was looking at all this with happy satisfaction, a\nbright lad from our Night School's radio class, told him that Branton\nHills should install a broadcasting station, as no city, today, would\nthink of trying to win additional population without that most\nimportant adjunct for obtaining publicity. So any man or boy who had\nany knack at radio was all agog; and about a thousand had ambitions for\na job in it, at which only about six can work. And City Hall had almost\na riot, as groups of politicians, pastors and clubs told just what such\na station should, and should not broadcast; for a broadcasting station,\nwith its vast opportunity for causing both satisfaction and antagonism,\nmust hold rigidly aloof from any racial favoritism, church, financial\nor nationality criticisms; and such a policy is, as any broadcasting\nstation will admit, most difficult of adoption. First of all stood\nthat important position of what you might call \"studio boss.\" Although\na man in control of a station is not known as \"boss,\" I think it will\npass in this oddly built-up story. Now I am going to boost our famous\nOrganization again, by stating that a boy from its ranks, Frank Morgan,\nwas put in; for it was a hobby of Gadsby to put Branton Hills boys in\nBranton Hills Municipal jobs. So Frank, right away, got all sorts of\ncalls for hours or half hours to broadcast \"most astounding bargains\"\nin clothing, salad oils, motor oils, motor \"gas\", soaps, cars, and\ntooth brush lubricants. With a big Fall campaign for Washington\nofficials about to start, such a position as Frank's was chuck full of\npitfalls; a stiff proposition for a young chap, not long out of High\nSchool. But Gadsby took him in hand.\n\n\"Now, boy, hold your chin up, and you will find that most folks, though\ncranky or stubborn at first, will follow your rulings if you insist,\nin a civil way, that you know all our National Radio Commission's\nlaws binding your station. _Millions_, of all kinds, will dial in\nyour station; and what would highly satisfy a group in Colorado might\nactually insult a man down in Florida; for radio's wings carry far. You\nknow I'll back you up, boy. But now, what would you call this station?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said our tyro-boss; \"a radio station should work with initials\nshowing its location. So a Branton Hills station could stand as KBH.\"\n\nSuch initials, ringing with civic patriotism, hit Gadsby just right;\nhis Council put it in writing; and \"Station KBH\" was born! Though it\nis not important to follow it from now on, I will say that our vast\ncountry, by tuning in on KBH, found out a lot about this Utopia.\n\n\"You know that good old yarn,\" said Gadsby, \"about making so good a\nrat-trap that millions will tramp down your grass in making a path to\nyour front door.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nNow don't think that our famous Organization, having shown its worth on\nso many occasions, sat down without thinking of doing anything again.\nNo, sir! Not _this_ bunch! If a boy or girl thought of any addition\nto Branton Hills' popularity it was brought to Mayor Gadsby for\nconsultation. And so, as Lucy Donaldson on a trip through a patch of\nwoods, saw a big stag looking out from a clump of shrubs, nothing would\ndo but to rush to His Honor to pour what thoughts that charming sight\nhad brought up in this bright young mind. So, as Gadsby stood at City\nHall's front door, this palpitating, gushing young girl ran towards\nhim, panting and blowing from a long run:--\n\n\"I want a zoo!!\"\n\n\"A WHAT?\"\n\n\"A ZOO!! _You_ know! A park with stags and all kinds of wild animals;\nand a duck pond, and--and--and----\"\n\n\"Whoa! Slow down a bit! Do you want an actual zoo, or an outfit of toys\nthat wind up and growl?\"\n\n\"I want a truly, out-and-out, big zoo. Why can't you build walls\naround a part of City Park, and----\"\n\nGadsby saw that this was an addition which nobody had thought of, until\nnow; so, grasping his young visitor's hand, joyfully, said:--\n\n\"It's a fact, Lucy!! And, as you thought of it, I'll call it,--now\nwait;--what _shall_ I call it? Aha! That's it! I'll call it 'Lucy Zoo'.\nHow's that for quick thinking?\"\n\n\"My! That's just grand; but what will Papa say?\"\n\nNow Gadsby had known Lucy's family from boyhood, so said:--\n\n\"You inform your dad that at any sign of balking by him, I'll put HIM\nin Lucy Zoo, and pay a boy to prod him with a sharp stick, until his\napproval is in my hands.\" This brought such a rollicking laugh that a\nman mowing City Hall lawn had to laugh, too.\n\nNow, (Ah! But I can't avoid saying it!) our Organization was out again;\nbut, now having grown a bit from such childish youths as had, at first\nstood in its ranks, a boy, now approaching manhood, and a girl, now a\nyoung woman, could solicit funds with an ability to talk knowingly in\nfavor of any factor that a hanging-back contributor could bring up in\nrunning down such a proposition. You can always count on finding that\nclass in any city or town upon any occasion for public works; but I can\nproudly say that many saw good in our Organization's plan; and Lucy\nsoon found that out, in Old Lady Flanagan.\n\n\"Whoops! A zoo, is it? And pray, phwat can't thot crazy Gadsby think\nup? If our big Mayor had four sich bys as I brought into this woild;\nworra, worra! his parlor, halls, dinin' room an' back yard 'd furnish\nhim wid a zoo, all right! Wid two always a-scrappin' about a ball bat\nor a sling shot; a brat continually a-bawlin' about nuthin'; an' a baby\nwid whoopin' cough, _I_ know phwat a zoo is, widout goin' to City Park\nto gawk at a indigo baboon, or a pink tom cat.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Lucy, trying hard not to laugh; \"Mayor Gadsby isn't\nthinking of putting in pink tom cats, nor any kind of tom cats in this\nzoo. It is for only _wild_ animals.\"\n\n\"WILD!! Say, if you could look into my back door as Old Man Flanagan\nquits work, an' brings back a load o' grog, you'd find thot you had\nwild animals roight in this town, all roight, all roight.\"\n\nBut, as on so many occasions, this charming girl got a contribution,\nwith Old Lady Flanagan calling out from a front window:--\n\n\"Good luck, Lucy darlin'! I'm sorry I was so dom cranky!\"\n\nBut though popular opinion was in favor of having a zoo, popular\nopinion didn't hand in donations to within four thousand dollars of\nwhat it would cost to install; and Gadsby and his \"gang\" had to do a\nbit of brain racking, so as not to disappoint lots of good folks who\n_had_ paid in. Finally, Sarah Young thought of a rich woman living just\nacross from City Park. This woman, Lady Standish, was of that kind,\nloving disposition which would bring in a cold, hungry, lost pup, or\ncat, and fill it up with hot food and milk. Branton Hills kids could\nbring any kind of a hurt or sick animal or bird; and Sarah had long\nknown that that back yard was, actually, a small zoo, anyway; with\ndogs, cats, poultry, two robins too young to fly, four sparrows and\na canary, almost bald. Sarah thought that any woman, loving animals\nas Lady Standish did, might just thrill at having a big zoo-ful right\nat hand. So, saying, \"I'll go and find out, right now,\" was off as an\narrow from a bow. As soon as this kindly woman found out what was on\nSarah's mind, our young solicitor got a loving kiss, with:--\n\n\"A zoo! Oh! how truly charming! What _grand_ things Mayor Gadsby\ncan think up without half trying!\" And Sarah had to grin, thinking\nof Lucy, and Old Lady Flanagan's opinion of His Honor! \"You may not\nknow it, Sarah,\" said Lady Standish, \"but John Gadsby and I had a big\nflirtation, way back in our school days. And HOW downcast poor Johnny\nwas at my finding a husband out of town! But that was long, long ago,\ndarling. So, just to sort of pacify my old pal, John, I'll gladly put\nup your missing four thousand; and you go to His Honor and say that I\nwish him all sorts of good luck with this plan.\"\n\nNow, Olympic champions must train continuously, but, customarily, in\ngymnasiums. But today, folks in Branton Hills' shopping district had to\nturn and gasp; for a young woman was sprinting wildly toward City Hall;\nfor Sarah was in a hurry. Gadsby was just coming out, as this girl, as\nbadly blown as Lucy was in asking for a zoo, ran up, calling out:--\n\n\"I GOT IT!! I GOT IT!!\"\n\n\"Got what? A fit?\"\n\n\"No! I got that final four thousand dollars! It's from Lady Standish,\nwho says that way back in school days, you and----\"\n\n\"Whoa!! That was back in _history!_\" but Gadsby was blushing, and Sarah\nwas winking, coyly.\n\nNow Gadsby was as fond of his Organization boys and girls as of his\nown; and Sarah was so radiantly happy that all His Honor could say\nwas:--\n\n\"My, now, Sarah! That's mighty good work! And as I told Lucy I'd call\nour zoo Lucy Zoo for thinking of it, I'll find a way to honor you, too.\nAha! I'll put up a big arch, through which all visitors must pass, and\ncall it 'Sarah Young's Rainbow Arch.' How's that?\"\n\nNow Sarah had a bit of natural wit; so quickly said:--\n\n\"That's just grand if you'll bury that famous pot of gold at its foot,\nso I can dig it up!\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nNow that a Zoo was actually on its way, Gadsby had to call in various\ngroups to talk about what a Zoo should contain. Now, you know that\n_all_ animals can't find room in this orthographically odd story; so,\nif you visit Lucy Zoo, you'll miss a customary inhabitant, or two. But\nyou'll find an array worthy of your trip. So a call was put in two big\ndaily journals, asking for bids on animals and birds; and soon, from\nnorth, south and criss-cross points, a hunting party or a city with\ntoo many zoo animals on hand got in touch with Branton Hills, with\nproposals for all kinds of animals, from kangaroos to bats; and our\nOrganization had a lot of fun planning how many it could crowd into\nCity Park, without crowding out visitors. Finally a ballot put Lucy's\nzoological population as follows:--\n\nFirst, according to Lucy, \"an awfully, AWFULLY big hippopotamus, with\na pool for its comfort;\" a yak, caribou, walrus, (also with a pool,) a\nlong fox-run, bisons, gnus, stags, (it was a stag, you know, that got\nthis zoo plan going!), alligators, mountain lions, African lions, wild\ncats, wild boars, llamas, gorillas, baboons, orang-outangs, mandrils;\n_and_, according to Gadsby's boys, a \"big gang\" of that amusing, tiny\nmimic always found accompanying hand-organs. Also an aviary, containing\ncondors, buzzards, parrots, ibis, macaws, adjutant birds, storks, owls,\nquail, falcons, tiny humming birds, a sprinkling of hawks, mocking\nbirds, swans, fancy ducks, toucans; and a host of small singing birds;\nand oh! without fail, an ostrich family; and, last, but most important\nof all, a big first cousin of old Jumbo! A big glass building would\nhold boa constrictors, pythons, cobras, lizards, and so forth; and down\nin back of all this, an outdoor aquarium, full of goldfish, rainbow\ntrout, various fancy fish and blossoming aquatic plants. All in all it\nwould furnish a mighty amusing and popular spot which would draw lots\nof out-of-town visitors; and visitors, you know, _might_ turn into\ninhabitants! And so things finally got around to Inauguration Day; and,\nknowing that no kid could sit still in school on such an occasion, it\nwas put down for a Saturday; and, so many happy, shouting, hopping,\njumping kids stood waiting for His Honor to cut a satin ribbon in front\nof Sarah Young's Rainbow Arch, that grown folks had to wait, four\nblocks back. As Gadsby was roaming around with Lucy, to find if things\nshould start moving, old Pat Ryan, from Branton Hills' railway station,\nwas hunting for him; finally locating him in a lunch room, and rushing\nin with:--\n\n\"Say! That big hop-skip-and-jump artist is down in my trunk room! I got\na punch on my jaw, a crack on my snout, and a kick on my shins a-tryin'\nto calm him down!\"\n\n\"A kick and a punch? What actions!\" said Gadsby. \"I don't know of any\nhop-skip-and-jump artist. How big a man is it?\"\n\n\"Worra, worra! It ain't no man at all, at all! It's that thing what\ngrows in Australia, and--\"\n\nBut Lucy saw light right off; and \"laughing fit to kill,\" said:--\n\n\"Oh, ho, ho!! _I_ know! It's that boxing kangaroo you bought from\nBarnum's circus!\" and a charming girl was doubling up in a wild storm\nof giggling, ignoring old Pat's scowls.\n\n\"Ah! That's him, all right,\" said Gadsby. \"So, Pat, just put him in a\nburlap bag and ship him to this zoo.\"\n\n\"Who? _I_ put him in a burlap bag? Say, boss! If I can pick up about\nsix husky guys around that station; and if I can find a _canvas_, not\na burlap, bag; and put on a gas mask, a stomach pad, two shin-guards,\nand----\"\n\nBut that crowd at Sarah's Arch was shouting for Gadsby to cut that\nribbon so old Pat had to bag that Australian tornado; and in a way\nthat would not hurt him; for kangaroo actors cost good cash, you know.\n\nSo that crowd of kids got in, at last! Now zoo animals can think, just\nas humans can; and it was amusing to watch a pair of boys staring at a\npair of orang-outangs; and a pair of orang-outangs staring back at a\npair of boys; both thinking, no doubt, what funny things it saw! And,\noccasionally, both animal and boy won a point! Now if you think that\nonly young folks find any fun in going to a zoo, you probably don't\ngo to zoos much; for many a big, rotund capitalist had to laugh at\nsimian antics, though, probably figuring up just how much satisfaction\nhis cash contribution brought him. Many a family woman forgot such\nthings as a finicky child or burning biscuits. All was happy-go-lucky\njoy; and, at two o'clock, as Branton Hills' Municipal Band, (a part of\nGadsby's Organization of Youth's work, you know) struck up a bright\nmarch, not a glum physiognomy was found in all that big park.\n\nGadsby and Lucy had much curiosity in watching what such crashing\nmusic would do to various animals. At first a spirit akin to worry\nhad baboons, gorillas, and such, staring about, as still as so many\nposts; until, finding that no harm was coming from such sounds, soon\ntook to climbing and swinging again. Stags, yaks and llamas did a bit\nof high-kicking at first; Gadsby figuring that drums, and not actual\nmusic, did it. But a lilting waltzing aria did not worry any part of\nthis big zoo family; in fact, a fox, wolf and jackal, in a quandary at\nfirst actually lay down, as though music truly \"hath charms to calm a\nwild bosom.\"\n\nAt Gadsby's big aquarium visitors found not only fun, but opportunity\nfor studying many a kind of fish not ordinarily found in frying pans;\nand, though in many lands, snails form a popular food, Lucy, Sarah and\nVirginia put on furious scowls at a group of boys who thought \"Snails\nmight go good, with a nut-pick handy.\" (But boys always _will_ say\nthings to horrify girls, you know.) And upon coming to that big glass\nbuilding, with its boa constrictors, alligators, lizards and so on,\na boy grinningly \"got a girl's goat\" by wanting to kiss a fifty-foot\nanaconda; causing Lucy to say, haughtily, that \"No boy, wanting to kiss\nsuch horrid, wriggly things can kiss us Branton Hills girls.\" (Good for\nyou, Lucy! I'd pass up a _sixty_-foot anaconda, any day, for _you_.)\n\nIn following months many a school class was shown through our zoo's\nfascinating paths, as instructors told of this or that animal's habits\nand natural haunts; and showing that it was as worthy of sympathy,\nif ill, as any human. And not only did such pupils obtain kindly\nthoughts for zoo animals, but cats, dogs and all kinds of farm stock\nsoon found that things had an uncommon look, through a dropping off in\nscoldings and whippings, and rapidly improving living conditions. But\nmost important of all was word from an ugly, hard-looking woman, who,\nwatching, with an apologizing sniff, a flock of happy birds, said:--\n\n\"I'm sorry that I always slap and bawl out my kids so much, for I know,\nnow, that kids or animals won't do as you wish if you snap and growl\ntoo much. And I trust that Mayor Gadsby knows what a lot of good all\nhis public works do for us.\"\n\nNow this is a most satisfactory and important thing to think about, for\nbrutality will not,--_cannot_,--accomplish what a kindly disposition\nwill; and, if folks could only know how quickly a \"balky\" child will,\nthrough loving and cuddling, grow into a charming, happy youth, much\nchildish gloom and sorrow would vanish; for a man or woman who is ugly\nto a child is too low to rank as highly as a wild animal; for no animal\nwill stand, for an instant, anything approaching an attack, or any form\nof harm to its young. But what a lot of tots find slaps, yanks and\nhard words for conditions which do not call for such harsh tactics!\n_No_ child is naturally ugly or \"cranky.\" And big, gulping sobs, or\nsad, unhappy young minds, in a tiny body should _not_ occur in any\ncommunity of civilization. Adulthood holds many an opportunity for such\nconditions. Childhood should not.\n\nNow just a word about zoos. Many folks think that animals in a zoo know\nno comforts; nothing but constant fright from living in captivity.\nSuch folks do not stop to think of a thing or two about an animal's\nwild condition. Wild animals must not only constantly hunt for food,\nbut invariably fight to kill it and to _hold_ it, too; for, in such a\nfight, a big antagonist will naturally win from a small individual.\nThus, what food is found, is also lost; and hunting must go on, day by\nday, or night by night until a tragic climax--by thirst or starvation.\nBut in a zoo, food is brought daily, with facility for drinking, and\nlaid right in front of hoofs, paws or bills. For small animals, roofs\nand thick walls ward off cold winds and rain; and so, days of calm\ninactivity, daily naps without worrying about attack; and a carting\naway of all rubbish and filth soon puts a zoo animal in bodily form\nwhich has no comparison with its wild condition. Lack of room in which\nto climb, roam or play, _may_ bring a zoo animal to that condition\nknown as \"soft\"; but, as it now has no call for vigor, and its fighting\npassions find no opportunity for display, such an animal is gradually\napproaching that condition which has brought Man, who is only an\nanimal, anyway, to his lofty point in Natural History, today. Truly,\nwith such tribulations, worry, and hard work as Man puts up with to\nobtain his food and lodging, a zoo animal, if it could only know of our\ndaily grind, would comfortably yawn, thankful that Man is so kindly\nlooking out for it. With similar animals all around it, and, day by\nday, just a happy growth from cub-hood to maturity, I almost wish that\nI was a zoo animal, with no boss to growl about my not showing up,\nmornings, at a customary hour!\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nNow, as our Organization of Youth is rapidly growing up, a _young_\ncrowd, too young to join it at first, is coming up; imbibing its\n\"why-not-do-it-now?\" spirit. So, as Gadsby stood in front of that big\nMunicipal Auditorium (which that group, you know, had had built),\nMarian Hopkins, a small girl, in passing by, saw him, and said:--\n\n\"I think Branton Hills ought to buy a balloon.\"\n\n\"Balloon? Balloon? What would this city do with a balloon? Put a string\non it so you could run around with it?\"\n\n\"No; not that kind of a balloon, but that big, zooming kind that sails\nway up high, with a man in it.\"\n\n\"Oh! Ha, ha! You think an air-craft is a balloon! But what would--Aha!\nAn airport?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh; but I didn't know how to say it.\"\n\n\"By cracky!\" said His Honor. \"I thought this town was about through\nimproving. But an airport _would_ add a bit to it; now wouldn't it?\"\n\nMarian had a most profound opinion that it would; (if profound opinions\ngrow in such small kids!) so both took a walk to City Hall to hunt up\na Councilman or two. Finding four in a Council room, Gadsby said:--\n\n\"Youth, or, I should say, childhood, has just shown that Branton Hills\nis shy on a most important acquisition,\" and Old Bill Simpkins just\n_had_ to blurt out:--\n\n\"And, naturally, it calls for cash! CASH! CASH! CASH!! What will this\ntown amount to if it blows in dollars so fast?\"\n\n\"And,\" said Gadsby, \"what will it amount to, if it don't?\"\n\nThat put a gag on Old Bill. Councilman Banks, though, was curious to\nknow about Marian's proposition, saying:--\n\n\"It is probably a plan for buying Christmas toys for all Branton Hills\nkids.\"\n\nBut tiny Marian, with a vigorous stamp of a tiny foot, swung right back\nwith:--\n\n\"NO, SIR!! Santa Claus will bring us our gifts! But I thought of having\na--what did you call it, Mayor Gadsby?\"\n\n\"This child thinks Branton Hills should build an airport, and I think\nso, too. If our inhabitants, such as this tot, can think up such\nthings, all adults should pack up, and vanish from municipal affairs.\nAll right, Marian; our City Council, _your_ City Council, my young\npatriot, will look into this airport plan for you.\"\n\nSo, as on similar occasions months ago, word that land was again\ncropping up in Gadsby's mind, brought out a flood of landlords with\nvacant lots, all looking forward to disposing of a dump worth two\ndollars and a half, for fifty thousand. Now an airport must occupy a\nvast lot of land, so cannot stand right in a City's shopping district;\nbut finally a big tract was bought, and right in back of tiny Marian's\nback yard! Instantly, City Hall was full of applicants for flying\nBranton Hills' first aircraft. To Gadsby's joy, amongst that bunch was\nHarold Thompson, an old Organization lad, who was known around town as\na chap who could do about anything calling for brains. As an airport\nis not laid out in a day, Harold got busy with paid aviators and soon\nwas piloting a craft without aid; and not only Branton Hills folks, but\nold aviators, saw in Harold, a \"bird-man\" of no small ability. And so\ntiny Marian's \"vision\" was a fact; just as \"big girl\" Lucy's Zoo; and,\nas with all big City affairs, an Inauguration should start it off. Now,\non all such affairs you always find a \"visitor of honor\"; and on this\ngrand day Gadsby couldn't think of anybody for that important post but\nMarian. And, as it would occur in August, any day would do, as that is\na school vacation month.\n\nAnd what a _mob_ stood, or sat, on that big airport, waiting for a\nsignal from young Marian which would start Harold aloft, on Branton\nHills' initial flight! Almost all brought a lunch and camp-stools or\nfolding chairs; and, as it was a hot day, thousands of gay parasols,\nand an array of bright clothing on our school-girls, had that big lot\nlooking as brilliant as a florist's window at Christmas.\n\nOur young visitor of honor was all agog with joy; and, I think,\npossibly a touch of vanity; for what child _wouldn't_ thrill with\nthousands watching? But though Marian had always had good clothing,\ncoming from a family who could afford it, _no_ tot, in all history, had\nso glorious an outfit as that which about all Branton Hills' population\nsaw on that platform, amidst flags, bunting and our big Municipal Band.\nAs an airship is a simulation of a bird; and as a bird, to a child, is\nnot far from a fairy, Marian had gaudy fairy wings, a radiant cloak of\ngold, a sparkling gown all aglow with twinkling stars, and a long glass\nwand, with a star at its top. As soon as all was in condition Gadsby\ntold Marian to stand up. This brought that vast crowd up, also; and\nGadsby said:--\n\n\"Now hold your wand way up high, and swing it, to signal Harold to\nstart.\"\n\nUp shot a tiny arm; and Harold, watching from his cockpit, sang\nout:--\"CONTACT!!\"\n\nA vigorous twist of his ship's gigantic \"fan\" a shout, a roar, a whizz,\na mighty cloud of dust, and amid a tornado of clapping, shouts, and\nband music, Branton Hills was put on aviation's map. Way, way up, so\nfar as to look as small as a toy, Harold put on a show of banking,\nrolling and diving, which told Gadsby that, still again, had Branton\nHills found profit in what its Organization of Youth, _and, now, its\nsmall kids_, had to say about improving a town.\n\nDuring that box-lunch picnic, many of our \"big girls\" brought so much\nfood to Marian that Dad and Ma had to stand guard against tummy pains.\nAnd what a glorious, jolly occasion that picnic was! Gay band music,\nsongs, dancing, oratory; and a grand all-round \"howdy\" amongst old\ninhabitants and arriving tourists soon was transforming that big crowd\ninto a happy group, such as it is hard to find, today, in any big city;\ncold, distant, and with no thought by its politicians for anybody in\nit; and Gadsby found, around that big airport, many a man, woman and\nchild who was as proud of him as was his own family.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nI think that now you should know this charming Gadsby family; so I will\nbring forth Lady Gadsby, about whom I told you at Gadsby's inauguration\nas Mayor; a loyal church woman with a vocal ability for choir work;\nand, with good capability on piano or organ, no woman could \"fill in\"\nin so many ways; and no woman was so willing, and quick to do so.\nGadsby had two sons; bright lads and popular with all. Julius was of\na studious turn of mind, always poring through books of information;\ncaring not what kind of information it was, so long as it was\ninformation, and not fiction. Gadsby had thought of his growing up as a\nschool instructor, for no work is so worthy as imparting what you know\nto any who long to study. But William! Oh, hum!! Our Mayor and Lady\nGadsby didn't know just _what_ to do with him; for all his thoughts\nclung around girls and fashions in clothing. Probably our High School\ndidn't contain a girl who didn't think that, at no distant day, Bill\nGadsby would turn, from a callow youth, into a \"big catch\" husband; for\na Mayor's son in so important a city as ours was a mark for any girl\nto shoot at. But Bill was not of a marrying disposition; loving girls\njust _as_ girls, but holding out no hand to any in particular. Always\nin first class togs, without missing a solitary fad which a young man\nshould adopt, Gadsby's Bill was a lion, in his own right, with no girl\nin sight who had that tact through which a lasso could land around his\nmanly throat. Gadsby had many a laugh, looking back at his own boyhood\ndays, his various flirtations and such wild, throbbing palpitations as\na boy's flirtations can instill; and looking back through just such\nogling groups as now sought his offspring; until a girl, oh, _so_ long\nago, had put a stop to all such flirtations, and got that lasso on\n\"with a strangling hold,\" as Gadsby says; and it is still on, today! But\nthis family was not all boys. Oh, my, no! Two girls also sat around\nthat family board. First, following William, was Nancy, who, as Gadsby\nlaughingly said, \"didn't know how to grow;\" and now, in High School,\nwas \"about as big as a pint of milk;\" and of such outstanding charm\nthat Gadsby continually got solicitations to allow photographing for\nsoft-drink and similar billboard displays.\n\n\"No, sir!! Not for any sort of pay!! In allowing public distribution\nof a girl's photo you don't know into what situations said photos will\nland. I find, daily, photographs of girls blowing about vacant lots,\nall soggy from rains; also in a ditch, with its customary filth; or\nstuck up on a brick wall or drawn onto an imaginary body showing a\nbrand of tights or pajamas. _No, sir!!_ Not for _my_ girl!!\"\n\nFourth in this popular family was Kathlyn, of what is known as a\n\"classical mold;\" with a brain which, at no distant day, will rank high\nin Biology and Microscopy; for Kathlyn was of that sort which finds\nfascination in studying out many whats and whys amongst that vast array\nof facts about our origin. This study, which too many young folks avoid\nas not having practical worth had a strong hold on Kathlyn, who could\nnot sanction such frivolous occupations as cards, dancing, or plain\nschool gossip. Not for an instant! Kathlyn thought that such folks\nhad no thoughts for anything but transitory thrills. But in Biology!!\nAh!! Why not study it, and find out how a tiny, microscopic drop of\nprotoplasm, can, through unknown laws grow into living organisms, which\ncan not only go on living, but can also bring forth offspring of its\nkind? And not only that. As said offspring must combat various kinds of\nsurroundings and try various foods, why not watch odd variations occur,\nand follow along, until you find an animal, bird, plant or bug of such\na total dissimilarity as to form practically, a class actually apart\nfrom its original form? Kathlyn did just that; and Gadsby was proud of\nit; and I think, just a bit curious on his own part as to occasional\nillustrations in this studious young lady's school books!\n\nNow it is known by all such natural \"faddists\" that any such a study\nhas points in common with a branch akin to it; and Kathlyn was not long\nin finding out that Biology, with its facts of animal origin, could\napply to a practical control of bugs on farms. (This word, \"bugs,\" is\nhardly Biological; but as Kathlyn is in this story, with its strict\northographical taboo, \"bugs\" must unavoidably supplant any classical\nnomination for such things.)\n\nSo, Mayor Gadsby sought Branton Hills' Council's approval for a goodly\nsum; not only for such control, but also for study as to how to plant,\nin ordinary soil, and not risk losing half a crop from worms, slugs\nand our awkwardly-brought-in \"bugs.\" This appropriation was a sort of\nprod, showing this Council that publicity of any first-class kind was\ngood for a city; and was casting about for anything which would so\nact, until Gadsby's son, Bill, (who, you know, thought of nothing but\ngirls and \"dolling up,\") found that Branton Hills had no distinction\nof its own in outfits for man or woman, so why not put up a goal of,\nsay fifty dollars, for anybody who could think up any worthy \"stunt\"\nin clothing; which should go out as \"Branton Hills' This\" or \"Branton\nHills' That.\" Possibly just a form of hat-brim, a cut of coat-front,\nor a sporting outfit. And our worthy Council did put up that goal, and\nmany brought all sorts of plans to City Hall. And Bill won, by thinking\nup a girls' (always girls, with Bill!) hiking outfit, consisting of a\nskirt with a rain-proof lining, which could, during a storm, form a\nrain-suit by putting it on, as Bill said, \"by substituting outwards for\ninwards.\" (This will hit Bill amusingly, as days go by!) Going with it\nwas a shirt with a similar \"turn-out\" facility, and a hiking boot with\nhigh tops as guards against thorns and burs; but which, by undoing a\nclasp, would slip off; and, LO!! you had a low-cut Oxford for ordinary\noccasions! In about a month a big cotton mill had work going full blast\non \"Branton Hills' Turn-it-out Sport and Hiking Outfit,\" and a small\nboot-shop got out a pair of Bill's \"two-part boots,\" though saying\nthat it would \"probably fall apart without warning!\" But Kathlyn put\non a pair and found it most satisfactory for a long, rough hill-climb,\nhunting for bird and animal forms for Biological study. This proof of\nBranton Hills' goods was soon known in surrounding towns, and that\ncritical boot-shop and big cotton mill had hard work to fill calls\nfrom Canada, Holland, Russia, Spain and Australia! And Bill was put upon\nBranton Hills' Roll of Honor.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nNow I'll drop civic affairs for a bit, and go on to a most natural\nact in this city of many young chaps and charming young girls which\nwas slowly working up all through this history, as Mayor Gadsby had\noccasion to find out, sitting comfortably on his porch on a hot, sultry\nAugust night. Amidst blossoming shrubs, a dim form slowly trod up his\nwinding pathway. It was a young man, plainly trying to act calmly, but\ncouldn't. It was Frank Morgan, our radio broadcasting \"boss\", you know,\nwho, for many a month, had shown what a romantic public calls \"a crush\"\nfor Gadsby's young Nancy.\n\nSo a jolly call of:--\"What's on your mind, boy?\" rang out, as Frank\nsank wiltingly into a hammock, wiping his brow of what I _actually_\nknow was _not_ natural humidity from an August night! Now Gadsby, who\nwas, as I said, a gay Lothario in his own youth, saw right off what\nwas coming, and sat back, waiting. Finally, finishing a bad attack of\ncoughing, (though Frank hadn't any cold!), that young man said:--\n\n\"I,--that is, Nancy and I,--or, I will say that I want to,--that is,--I\nthink Nancy and I would--\" and Gadsby took pity on him, right off.\n\nNancy had always had a strong liking for Frank. Both had grown up in\nBranton Hills from babyhood; and Gadsby thought back about that lasso\nwhich had brought him Lady Gadsby. Now asking a girl's Dad for that\nyoung lady's hand is no snap for any young swain; and Gadsby was just\nthat kind of a Dad who would smooth out any bumps or rough spots in\nsuch a young swain's path. Nancy wasn't a child, now, but a grown-up\nyoung woman; so Gadsby said:--\n\n\"Frank, Lady Gadsby and I know all about how much you think of Nancy;\nand what Nancy thinks of you. So, if you want to marry, our full wish\nis for a long and happy union. Nancy is out in that arbor, down this\nback path; and I'll watch that nobody disturbs you two for an hour.\"\n\nAt this grand turn of affairs, Frank could only gasp:--\"OH-H-H!!\" and\na shadowy form shot down that dusky path; and from that moonlit arbor,\nanybody knowing how a man chirps to a canary bird, would know that two\nyoung birds put a binding approval upon what His Honor had just said!!\n\nMany a man has known that startling instant in which Dan Cupid, that\nbusy young rascal, took things in hand, and told him that his baby\ngirl was not a baby girl now, and was about to fly away from him. It\nis both a happy and a sad thrill that shoots through a man at such an\ninstant. Happy and joyous at his girl's arrival at maturity; sad, as\nit brings to mind that awkward fact that his own youth is now but a\nmyth; and that his scalp is showing vacant spots. His baby girl in a\nbridal gown! His baby girl a Matron! His baby girl proudly placing a\n_grandchild_ in his lap!! It's an impossibility!! But this big world\nis full of this kind of impossibility, and will stay so as long as Man\nlasts.\n\nSo Nancy, tiny, happy, laughing Nancy, was \"found\" through a conspiracy\nby Dan Cupid and Frank Morgan; and right in all glory of youth.\n_Youth!!_ Ah, what a word!! And how transitory! But, how grand! as long\nas it lasts. How many millions in gold would pour out for an ability to\ncall it all back, as with our musical myth, Faust. During that magic\npart of a child's growth this world is just a gigantic inquiry box,\ncontaining many a topic for which a solution is paramount to a growing\nmind. And to whom can a child look, but us adults? Any man who \"can't\nstop now\" to talk with a child upon a topic which, to him is \"too silly\nfor anything,\" should look back to that day upon which _that_ topic\nwas dark and dubious in his own brain. A child who asks nothing will\nknow nothing. That is why that \"bump of inquiry\" was put on top of our\nskulls.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nBut to go back to Nancy. It was in August that Frank had stumblingly\ntold Gadsby of his troth; and so, along in April, Branton Hills was\ntold that a grand church ritual would occur in May. May, with its\nblossoms, birds and balmy air! An idyllic month for matrimony. I wish\nthat I could call this grand church affair by its common, customary\nnomination; but that word can't possibly crowd into _this_ story. It\nmust pass simply as a church ritual.\n\nAll right; so far, so good. So, along into April all Branton Hills was\nagog, awaiting information as to that actual day; or, I should say,\nnight.\n\nGadsby's old Organization of Youth was still as loyal to all in it as\nit was, way back in days of its formation; days of almost constantly\nrunning around town, soliciting funds for many a good Municipal\nactivity. Finally this group got cards announcing that on May Fourth,\nBranton Hills' First Church would admit all who might wish to aid in\nstarting Nancy and Frank upon that glamorous path to matrimonial bliss.\n\nMay Fourth was punctual in arriving; though many a young girl got into\nthat flighty condition in which a month drags along as though in\nirons, and clock-hands look as if stuck fast. But to many girls, also,\nMay Fourth was not any too far away; for charming gowns and dainty\nhats do not grow upon shrubs, you know; and girls who work all day\nmust hurry at night, at manipulating a thousand or so things which go\ntowards adorning our girls of today.\n\nNow, an approach to a young girl's \"big day\" is not always as that\ngirl might wish. Small things bob up, which, at first, look actually\ndisastrous for a joyous occasion; and for Nancy and Frank, just such a\nthing did bob up; for, on May Third, a pouring rain and whistling wind\nput Branton Hills' spirits way, way down into a sorrowful slump. Black,\nugly, rumbling clouds hung aggravatingly about in a saturation of mist,\nrain and fog; and roads and lawns got such a washing that Nancy said:--\n\n\"Anyway, if I can't _walk_ across that front church yard, I can _swim\nit!!_\"\n\nThat was Nancy; a small bunch of inborn good humor; and I'll say, right\nnow, that it _took_ good humor, and lots of it, to look upon conditions\nout of your control, with such outstanding pluck!\n\nBut young Dan Cupid was still around, and got in touch with that\ntyrannical mythological god who controls storms; and put forth such\na convincing account of all Nancy's good points, (and Frank's too, if\nanybody should ask you) that a command rang out across a stormy sky:--\n\n\"Calling all clouds!! Calling all clouds!! All rain to stop at midnight\nof May Third! Bright Sun on May Fourth, and no wind!!\"\n\nSo, as Nancy took an anxious squint out of doors at about six o'clock\non that important morning, (and what young girl _could_ go on, calmly\nsnoozing on such a day?) Lo!! Old Sol was smiling brightly down on\nBranton Hills; birds sang; all sorts of blossoming things had had a\ngood drink; and a most _glorious_ sky, rid of all ugly clouds, put our\nyoung lady into such a happy mood that it took a lot of control to\navoid just a tiny bit of humidity around a small pair of rich, brown\norbs which always had that vibrating, dancing light of happy youth;\nthat miraculous \"joy of living.\"\n\nAnd, _what_ a circus was soon going full tilt in Mayor Gadsby's\nmansion! If that happy man so much as said:--\"Now, I----\" a grand,\nwomanly chorus told him that \"a man don't know anything about such\naffairs;\" and that a most satisfactory spot for him was in a hammock\non his porch, with a good cigar! That's it! A man is nominally monarch\nin his own family; but _only_ so on that outstanding day upon which\na bridal gown is laid out in all its glory on his parlor sofa, and a\nsmall mob of girls, and occasionally a woman or two, is rushing in and\nout, up and down stairs, and finding as much to do as a commonly known\nmicroscopic \"bug\" of prodigious hopping ability finds at a dog show.\n_Rush! rush! rush!_ A thousand thoughts and a million words, (this\ncrowd was all girls, you know!) making that parlor as noisy as a saw\nmill! But Gadsby laughingly staid out of it all, watching big armfuls\nof bloom and many a curious looking box go in through that front door;\nflying hands rapidly untying glorious ribbon wrappings.\n\nNow, upon all such occasions you will find, if you snoop around in\ndining room or pantry, an astonishing loaf of culinary art, all fancy\nfrosting, and chuck full of raisins and citron, which is always cut\nupon such an auspicious occasion; and it is as hard to avoid naming it,\nin this story, as it is to withstand its assault upon your stomach.\n\nOh hum! Now what? Aha! May Fourth, lasting, as Nancy said, \"for about\na million months,\" finally got Gadsby's dining room clock around\nto six-fifty; only about an hour, now, to that grand march past\npractically half of Branton Hills' population; for all who couldn't jam\ninto that commodious church would stand around in a solid phalanx,\nblocking all traffic in that part of town; for all Branton Hills was\nfond of its Mayor's \"baby girl.\"\n\nBut, during this rush and hubbub, how about Frank? Poor boy! Now,\nif you think that a young lad at such an instant is as calm as a\nmill-pond, you don't know romantic Youth, that's all. About forty of\nGadsby's old Organization boys, now manly young chaps, had bought him a\ncar, which Nancy was _not_ to know anything about until that throwing\nof old boots, and what is also customary, had quit. Frank didn't want\nto hold it back from Nancy, but what can a chap do, against forty?\nAlso, last night, at a big \"so sorry, old chap\" party, Frank had found\nhow loyal a bunch of old pals can turn out; and this \"grand launching\ninto matrimonial doubt\" had put him in a happy mood for that all\nimportant oration of two words:--\"I do.\"\n\nSo now I'll hurry around to church to find out how Nancy's Organization\ngirls put in a long day of hard labor; not only at floor work, but up\non stools and chairs. My! My! Just _look_ and gasp!! A long chain of\nlilacs runs from door to altar in two rows. And _look_ at that big arch\nof wistaria and narcissus half way along! Artificial palms stand in\ncurving ranks from organ to walls; and, with all lights softly glowing\nthrough pink silk hoods; and with gilt cords outlining an altar-dais\nof moss and sprays of asparagus, it is a sight to bring a thrill to\nanybody, young or old.\n\nAnd, now--_aha!!_ With organist and Pastor waiting, a murmur and\nhand-clapping from that big front door told all who had luckily got in\nthat Nancy was coming! It took thirty cars to bring that bridal party\nto church; for not a boy or girl of our old Organization would miss\nthis occasion for a farm, with a pig on it with four kinks in its tail.\nNow, naturally, any girl would long to walk up that Holy path with\nNancy, but too many would spoil things; so, by drawing lots, Nancy had\nfor company, Sarah Young, Lucy Donaldson, Priscilla Standish, Virginia\nAdams, Doris Johnson and Cora Grant; with Kathlyn as Maid of Honor, as\ncharming an array of youthful glory as you could find in all Branton\nHills.\n\nUntil this important arrival, Branton Hills' famous organist, just\nplain John Smith, was playing softly,--\"Just a Song at Twilight,\"\nwatching for a signal from Mayor Gadsby; and soon swung into that\nfamous march which brought forth a grand thrill, as tiny, blushing,\npalpitating Nancy took \"Dad's\" arm, gazing with shining orbs at that\ndistant--oh, _so_ distant--altar.\n\nNow I want to know why anybody should want to cry on such a grand\noccasion. What is sad about it? But many a lash was moist as that tiny\nvision of glamorous purity slowly trod that fragrant pathway. Possibly\ngirls can't avoid it; anyway, our Branton Hills girls didn't try to do\nso.\n\nGadsby, as has many a good old Dad, fought back any such showing;\nbut I won't say that his thoughts didn't nag him; for, giving away\nyour baby girl to any young, though first-class chap, is not actually\n_fun_. But that long, long trail finally brought him to that mossy\ndais, at which Frank, coming in through a handy door, stood waiting.\nNancy was as calm as a wax doll; but Frank stood shaking with a most\nannoying cough (of imaginary origin!) as Pastor Brown stood, book in\nhand. Now I won't go through with all that was said; nor say anything\nabout Nancy's tiny, warm, soft hand as it was put in Frank's big clumsy\nfist by Pastor Brown. Nor about that first Holy kiss; nor that long,\nmighty roar of organ music, as our happy, blushing pair trod that long\npathway, doorwards. You know all about it, anyway, as most such rituals\nfollow a standard custom. Nor shall I go into that happy hour at His\nHonor's mansion, during which that fancy loaf of frosting, raisins and\ncitron was cut; (and which many a girl put in a pillow that night!);\nnor of that big bridal bunch of blossoms, which was thrown from a\nstairway into a happy group of hopping, jumping, laughing girls. (But\nI will say,--shhhh! that Kathlyn caught it!); nor anything of Nancy\nand Frank's thrilling trip to Branton Hills' big railway station, in\nthat gift car which Nancy thought was a king's chariot; nor of a grand,\nlow bow by old Pat Ryan of that station's trunk room. It was just that\ncustomary \"_All aboard!!_\" a crowd's \"Hooray!!\" and \"Good Luck!!\", with\nBranton Hills' Municipal Band a-blaring, and a mighty mob shouting and\nwaving.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nOh, hum! I'll turn from this happy affair now and try to find out what\nwas going on in this thriving, hustling city. Now you probably think\nof a city as a gigantic thing; for, if you go up onto a high hill,\nand look around across that vast array of buildings, parks, roads and\ndistant suburbs, you not only think that it is a gigantic thing, you\n_know_ it is. But, _is_ it?\n\nJust stop and think a bit. All such things as bulk, or width, you know\nby comparison only; comparison with familiar things. So, just for\nfun, go up in an imaginary balloon, about half way to that old Moon,\nwhich has hung aloft from your birth--(and possibly a day or two in\naddition)--and look down upon your \"gigantic\" city. How will it look?\nIt is a small patch of various colors; but you know that, within that\ntiny patch, many thousands of your kind hurry back and forth; railway\ntrains crawl out to far-away districts; and, if you can pick out a\ngrain of dust that stands out dimly in a glow of sunlight, you may know\nthat it is your mansion, your cabin or your hut, according to your\nfinancial status. Now, if that hardly shows up, how about _you_? What\nkind of a dot would _you_ form in comparison? You must admit that\nyour past thoughts as to your own pomposity will shrink just a bit!\nAll this shows us that could this big World think, it wouldn't know\nthat such a thing as Man was on it. And Man thinks that his part in all\nthis unthinkably vast Cosmos is important!! Why, you poor shrimp! if\nthis old World wants to twitch just a bit and knock down a city or two,\nor split up a group of mountains, Man, with all his brain capacity,\ncan only dash wildly about, dodging falling bricks. No. You wouldn't\nshow up from that balloon as plainly as an ant, in crawling around our\nCapitol building at Washington.\n\nBut why all this talk about our own inconspicuosity? It is simply\nbrought up to accompany Nancy's thoughts as that train shot across\ncountry; for Nancy, until now, had not known anything approaching such\na trip. So this happy, happy trip, back upon which many a woman looks,\nwith a romantic thrill, was astounding to such a girl. From Branton\nHills to San Francisco; a boat to Honolulu, Manila, Shanghai, Hong\nKong, Colombo, and finally Cairo. Ah! Cairo!! In thinking of it you\nnaturally bring up two words--\"Pyramids\" and \"Sphinx\", words familiar\nfrom school days. Practically from birth, Nancy, along with millions\nof folks, had known that famous illustration of a thing half Lion and\nhalf woman; and a mountainous mass of masonry, built for a king's tomb.\nSo, standing right in front of both, Nancy and Frank got that wondrous\nthrill coming from attaining a long, long wish. From Cairo to Italy,\nSpain, London, Paris, and that grand Atlantic sail, landing at Boston,\nand hustling by fast train (but _how_ slow it did go!!) to Branton\nHills! So, along about Thanksgiving Day, about half of its population\nwas again at its big railway station, for Nancy was coming back. (And\nFrank, too, if anybody should ask you.)\n\nAnd with that big Municipal Band a-booming and blaring, and the crowd\nof our old Organization girls pushing forward, did Branton Hills look\ngood to Nancy? _And did Nancy look good to Branton Hills?_ _What_\na glorious tan, from days and days on shipboard! And was that old\nAtlantic ugly? Ask Frank, poor chap, who, as on that big Pacific, had\nfound out just what a ship's rail is for! And that stomachs can turn\nmost amazing flip-flops if an old boat is too frisky!\n\nIn just an instant, actual count, Nancy was in Lady Gadsby's arms,\nfighting valiantly to hold back a flood of big, happy sobs; and Frank\nwas busy, grabbing a cloud of hands surging towards him.\n\nComing back from a long trip is a happy occasion. And it is also mighty\ngood to put a trunk or a bag down, knowing that it will \"stay put\" for\na day or two, anyway. That constant packing and unpacking on a long\ntrip, soon turns into an automatic function; and how Nancy did worry\nabout what transportation customs in various lands would do to a first\nclass trunk which has a romantic history, owing to its coming as a\nmatrimonial gift from a group of loving girls. But now; _ah!!_ Put it\naway, and your things around, in familiar disposal.\n\nLong trips do bring lots of fun and information; but a truly long trip\nis tiring, both in body and mind.\n\nBut Nancy and Frank won't stay with Gadsby long; for, during that trip,\na charming bungalow was built on a lot of Gadsby's, facing City Park;\nand Nancy put in many days arranging things in it. Anybody who has had\nsuch joyful work to do, knows how assiduously a young pair would go\nabout it; for two young robins carrying bits of cotton and string up to\na criss-cross of twigs in a big oak, with constant soft, loving chirps,\n\"had nothing,\" according to our popular slang, on Nancy and Frank.\n\nFinally \"moving in day\" got around, with that customary party, to\nwhich you carry a gift to add to such things as a young husband on\nonly a small salary can install. And _how_ gifts did pour in!! Rugs,\nchairs, small stands, urns, clocks, photos in wall mountings, dainty\nscarfs (all handwork by our girls in our Night School), books, lamps,\na \"radio\" from Station KBH, until, finally, a big truck found an\nopportunity in that coming and going throng to back in and unload an\nupright piano, all satin ribbon wrappings, with a card:--\"From Branton\nHills' Municipal Band.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nI could go on for hours about this starting out of Nancy and Frank, but\nmany civic affairs await us; for Julius Gadsby who has not got into\nthis story up to now, had, from his constant poring through all kinds\nof books of information, built up a thorough insight into fossils;\nand you know that Kathlyn is way up in Biology; which brings in our\nawkward \"bugs\" again. Now bugs will burrow in soil, and always did,\nfrom History's birth; building catacombs which at last vanish through a\npiling up of rocks, sand or soil on that spot. Now Julius continually\nran across accounts of important \"finds\" of such fossils, and with\nKathlyn's aid was soon inaugurating popular clamor for a big Hall of\nNatural History.\n\nThis, Julius and Kathlyn thought, would turn out as popular, in a way,\nas living animals out at our Zoo. But an appropriation for a Hall\nof Natural History is a hard thing to jam through a City Council;\nfor though its occupants call for no food, you can't maintain such\na building without human custody; \"which,\" said Old Bill Simpkins,\n\"is but a tricky way of saying CASH!!\" But our Council was by now so\nfamiliar with calls from that famous \"Organization\", and, owing to\nits inborn faith in that grand body of hustling Youth, such a building\nwas built; Julius and Kathlyn arranging all displays of fossil birds,\nplants, \"bugs,\" footprints, raindrop marks, worms, skulls, parts of\njaws, and so on. And what a crowd was on hand for that first public\nday! Julius and Kathlyn took visitors through various rooms, giving\nmuch data upon what was shown; and many a Branton Hills inhabitant\nfound out a lot of facts about our vast past; about organisms living\nso far back in oblivion as to balk Man's brain to grasp. Kathlyn stood\namongst groups of botanical fossilizations, with Gadsby not far away,\nas this studious young woman told school pupils how our common plants\nof today through various transitions in form, show a kinship with\nwhat now lay, in miraculously good condition, in this big Hall; and\nJulius told staring groups how this or that fossil did actually link\nsuch animals as our cow or walrus of today with original forms totally\napart, both in looks and habits. And it was comforting to Gadsby to\nfind pupils asking how long ago this was, and noting that amazing look\nas Julius had to say that nobody knows.\n\nSuch a building is an addition to any city; for this big World is so\nold that human calculation cannot fathom it; and it will, in all\nprobability, go on always. So it is improving a child's mind to visit\nsuch displays; for it will start a train of thoughts along a path not\ncommonly sought if such institutions do not stand as attractions. Now,\nin any community a crank will bob up, who will, with loud acclaim and\nhigh-sounding words, avow that it \"is a scandalous drain on public\nfunds to put up such a building just to show a lot of rocks, animals'\nribs and birds' skulls.\" But such loud bombasts only show up an\n\"orator's\" brain capacity (or lack of it), and actually bring studious\nfolks to ask for just such data upon things which his ridiculing had\nrun down. It is an old, old story, that if you want a city's population\nto go in strongly for anything, and you start a loud, bawling campaign\nagainst it, that public will turn to it for information as to its\nworth. So, just such a loud, bawling moron had to drift into our Hall\non its inauguration day, and soon ran smack up against Kathlyn! That\nworthy girl, allowing him to \"blow off\" a bit, finally said:--\n\n\"I know you. You run a stock farm. All right. You want to know all you\ncan about matching and crossing your stock, don't you? I thought so.\nBut God did all that, long, oh, _so_ long ago; gradually producing such\nanimals as you own today; and all you can do is to follow along, in\nyour puny way, and try to avoid a poor quality of stock mixing with\nyours. This building contains thousands of God's first works. It won't\ndo you a bit of harm to look through our rooms. Nothing will jump out\nat you!\"\n\nAt that that barking critic shut up! And Gadsby slid outdoors,\nchuckling:--\n\n\"That's _my_ girl talking!! That's my Kathlyn!!\"\n\nIt is curious why anybody should pooh-pooh a study of fossils or\nvarious forms of rocks or lava. Such things grant us our only vision\ninto Natural History's big book; and it isn't a book in first-class\ncondition. Far from it! Just a tiny scrap; a slip; or, possibly a\nbig chunk is found, with nothing notifying us as to how it _got_ to\nthat particular point, nor how long ago. Man can only look at it,\nlift it, rap it, cut into it, and squint at it through a magnifying\nglass. And,--_think_ about it. That's all; until a formal study brings\naccompanying thoughts from many minds; and, by such tactics, judging\nthat in all probability such and such a rock or fossil footprint is\nabout so old. Natural History holds you in its grasp through just this\nimpossibility of finding actual facts; for it is thus causing you to\n_think_. Now, thinking is not only a voluntary function; it is an\n_acquisition_; an _art_. Plants do not think. Animals probably do, but\nin a primary way, such as an aid in knowing poisonous foods, and how to\nbring up an offspring with similar ability. But Man can, and _should_\nthink, and think hard and constantly. It is ridiculous to rush blindly\ninto an action without looking forward to lay out a plan. Such an\nunthinking custom is almost a panic, and panic is but a mild form of\ninsanity.\n\nSo Kathlyn and Julius did a grand, good thing in having this Hall as an\naddition to Branton Hills' institutions.\n\nNow, in any city or town, or almost any small community, you will find\na building, or possibly only a room, about which said city or town has\nnothing to say. It is that most important institution in which you put\na stamp on your mail and drop it into a slot, knowing that it will find\nits way across city or country to that man or woman who is waiting for\nit.\n\nBut how many young folks know _how_ this mail is put out so quickly,\nand with such guaranty against loss? Not many, I think, if you ask.\nSo Gadsby, holding up Youth as a Nation's most important function in\nits coming history, thought that any act which would instruct a child\nin any way, was worthy. So, on a Saturday morning His Honor took a\ngroup of Grammar School pupils to a balcony in back of that all-hiding\npartition, and a postal official, showing all mail handling acts\nindividually, said:--\n\n\"In this country, two things stand first in rank: your flag and your\nmail. You all know what honor you pay to your flag, but you should\nknow, also, that your mail,--just that ordinary postal card--is also\nimportant. But a postal card, or any form of mail, is _not_ important,\nin that way, until you drop it through a slot in this building, and\nwith a stamp on it, or into a mail box outdoors. Up to that instant\nit is but a common card, which anybody can pick up and carry off\nwithout committing a criminal act. But as soon as it is in back of\nthis partition, or in a mail box, a magical transformation occurs; and\nanybody who _now_ should willfully purloin it, or obstruct its trip\nin any way, will find prison doors awaiting him. What a frail thing\nordinary mail is! A baby could rip it apart, but no adult is so foolish\nas to do it. That small stamp which you stick on it, is, you might say,\na postal official, going right along with it, having it always in his\nsight.\"\n\nA giggling girl was curious to know if that was why a man's photo is on\nit.\n\n\"Possibly,\" said our official, laughing. \"But wait a bit. Look\ndownstairs. As your mail falls in through that slot, or is brought in\nby a mailman it is put through an ink-daubing apparatus--that's it,\nright down in front of you--which totally ruins its stamp. How about\nyour man's photo, now?\"\n\nA good laugh rang around, and our official said:--\n\n\"Now a man sorts it according to its inscription, puts it into a canvas\nbag and aboard a train, or possibly an aircraft. But that bag has\nmail going to points a long way apart, so a man in a mail car sorts\nit out, so that Chicago won't find mail in its bag which should go to\nCalifornia.\"\n\nAt this point our giggling girl said:--\n\n\"Ooooo! I had a Christmas card for Missouri go way down to Mississippi!\"\n\n\"How did you mark it?\"\n\n\"I put M-i-s-s for Missouri.\"\n\n\"Try M-o, and I wish you luck.\"\n\nAs that laugh ran round, our official said:--\n\n\"Now you know that you can buy a long, narrow stamp which will hurry\nyour mail along. So, as all mail in this building is put up in many a\nsmall bunch, all with such stamps attract a mailman, who will so wrap a\nbunch that that kind of a stamp will show up plainly. Upon its arrival\nat a distant point, a boy will grab it, and hurry it to its final\ngoal. But that stamp will not hurry it as long as it is on that train.\"\n\nOur giggling girl, swinging in again, said:--\n\n\"What? With that stamp right on top?\"\n\n\"How can it?\" said our official. \"A train can only go just so fast,\nstamp or no stamp.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nOur boys and girls got a big thrill from this visit in back of that\npartition, and told Gadsby so. On coming out of that building our party\nsaw a big patrolman putting a small boy into a patrol wagon. That\npoor kid was but a bunch of rags, dirty, and in a fighting mood. Our\nboys got a big laugh out of it. Our girls, though, did _not_. Young\nMarian Hopkins, who had that fairy wand, you know, at our airport\ninauguration, said:--\n\n\"Oh, that poor child! Will that cop put him in jail, Mayor Gadsby?\" At\nwhich His Honor instantly thought of a plan long in his mind. Branton\nHills had a court room, a child's court, in fact, at which a kindly man\nlooks out for just such young waifs--trying to find out why such tots\ncommit unlawful acts. So Gadsby said:--\n\n\"I don't know, Marian, but I want you young folks to go on a visit,\ntonight, to our night court, to find out about just such wild boys.\nHow many want to go?\"\n\nTo his satisfaction, all did; and so, that night that court room had\nrows of young folks, all agog with curiosity which a first visit to a\ncourt stirs up in a child. Just by luck, our young vagrant in rags was\nbrought in first, shaking with childish doubt as to what was going to\noccur. But that kindly man sitting back of that big mahogany railing\nhad no thought of scaring a child, and said calmly:--\n\n\"Now, boy, what did you do that you ought not to do; and why did you do\nit?\"\n\nAs our boys sat nudging and winking, but with our girls growing sad\nfrom sympathy, our young culprit said:--\n\n\"Aw! I grabs a bun, and dis big cop grabs my collar!\"\n\n\"But why did you grab that bun? It wasn't yours, you know.\"\n\n\"_Gosh_, man!! I was _hungry!!_\"\n\n\"Hungry? Don't your folks look out for you?\"\n\n\"Naw; I do my own looking. And that's what I _was_ doing, too!\"\n\n\"What had you for food all day?\"\n\n\"Just that bun. And _say!!_ I only got _half_ of it! That big cop was\nso rough!\"\n\n\"Did that cop, as you call him, hurt you?\"\n\n\"_Hurt!!_ I should say _not!!_ I put up a good stiff scrap! I paid him\nback, blow for blow! No big gas-bag of a cop is going to wallop _this_\nkid and not pay for it!\"\n\n\"But, boy, don't your folks bring you up to know that it is wrong to\nrob anybody?\"\n\n\"Naw! My Dad robs folks, and just got six months for it. So why\nshouldn't I? It's all right to do what your Dad will do, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Not always, boy,\" and our girls in row two and our boys in row four\nsat sad and glum at this portrayal of youthful sin. Finally that big\nkindly man, thoughtfully rubbing his chin, said:--\n\n\"Whom did your Dad rob?\"\n\n\"I dunno. It was a Ford car. Nobody wasn't in it, so why not grab it?\nThat's what Dad said. You can pick up a bit of cash for a car, you\nknow, boss. And say, if a car brung only six months, how long will I\nsquat in jail for swiping this half bun? Aw! Go slow, boss! I ain't no\nbad kid! Only just a hungry mutt. Gosh!! _How_ I wish I had a glass of\nmilk!\"\n\nFrom row two a young, vigorous girlish form shot out, dashing for a\ndoorway; and as that big kindly man was still rubbing his chin, Marian\nburst in again, rushing, sobbingly, to that sad bunch of rags, holding\nout a pint of milk and two hot biscuits. A quick snatch by two horribly\ndirty young hands, a limp flop on a mat at that big mahogany railing,\nand a truly hungry child was oblivious to all around him. And I'll say\nthat our boys, in row four, had lumpy throats. But finally that big\nkindly man said:--\n\n\"Though taking things unlawfully is wrong, conditions can occur in\nwhich so young a culprit is not at fault. This young chap has had no\nbringing up, but has run wild. A child will not know right from wrong\nif not taught; and, as it is a primary animal instinct to obtain food\nin any way, I will simply put this boy in a school which Branton Hills\nmaintains for just such youths.\"\n\nAt this both row two and row four burst out in such a storm of\nhand-clapping that Gadsby found that this visit had shown his young\nfolks, from actual contact with a child without training, how important\nchild-raising is; and how proud a city is of such as act according to\nlaw.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nIn almost any big town, around Autumn, you will annually run across\nthat famous agricultural show known as a County Fair; and, as Branton\nHills had a big park, which you know all about, right in front of\nNancy's and Frank's small bungalow, it was a most natural spot for\nholding it. And so, as this happy pair's third Autumn got around,\nstirring activity in that big park also got a-going; for railings for\nstockyards don't grow all built; yards and yards of brown canvas don't\njust blow into a park; nor do \"hot dog\" and popcorn stands jump up from\nnothing. And Nancy, rocking on that bungalow porch, could watch all\nthis work going on. And rocking was about all that Nancy could, or, I\nshould say, _should_ do, just now.\n\nWhat a sight it was! Trucks; small cars; wagons; a gang with a tractor\nplowing up hard spots; a gang picking up rocks, grading humpy spots,\nand laying out ground plans. Masons building walls, and all kinds\nof goods arriving, by tons. But out of all that confusion and ado a\ncanvas town will grow, strung from top to bottom with gaily flapping\nflags and hanging bunting, and that customary \"mid-way\" with its long\nrows of gaudy billboards, in front of which circus ballyhoo artists\nwill continuously bawl and shout out claims about sword-swallowing,\ntattooing, hula-hula dancing, boa constrictor charming, or a Punch and\nJudy show.\n\nAt a County Fair two things stand out as most important: farm stock\nand that oval track around which swiftly trotting colts will thrill\nthousands; and, I'll say, shrink a bank account or two! But, of all\nsights, I don't know of any with such drawing ability for kids as just\nsuch a carnival lot. So, daily, as soon as school was out, throngs\nof happy, shouting, hopping, jumping boys and girls would dash for\nthat big park; looking, pointing, and climbing up on auto tops, into\nlofty oaks, onto tall rocks, or a pal's back; for if anything is\ndifficult for a boy to obtain a sight of, nothing in climbing that an\norang-outang can do, will balk him!\n\nSo Nancy sat calmly rocking, rocking, rocking, and,--but, pardon! I'll\ngo on with this story. All I know is that Frank, arriving from work\nat Radio Station KBH, wouldn't so much as look at that big carnival\nlot, but would rush in, in a most loving, solicitous way which always\nbrought a kiss and a blush from Nancy. Now if I don't quit talking\nabout this young pair you won't know anything about that big show\ngoing up in front of that happy bungalow. Almost daily Lady Gadsby\nwould drop in on Nancy, bringing all sorts of dainty foods; and His\nHonor, with Kathlyn, Julius and Bill, paid customary visits.\n\n\"But that fair!\" you say. \"How about that fair?\"\n\nAh! It _was_ a fair, I'll say! What mobs on that first day! And what a\ndin!! Bands playing, ballyhoos shouting, popcorn a-popping, \"hot dogs\"\na-sizzling, ducks squawking, cows lowing, pigs grunting, an occasional\nbaby squalling; and 'midst it all, a choking cloud of dust, a hot\nAutumn wind, panting, fanning matrons, cussing husbands; all working\ntoward that big oval track at which all had a flimsy possibility of\nwinning a million or two (or a dollar or two!). Oh, you County Fairs!\nYou bloom in your canvas glory, annually. You draw vast crowds; you\nshow high quality farm stock, gigantic pumpkins, thousands of poultry,\nincluding our \"Thanksgiving National Bird\". You fill coops with fancy\nsquabs, fat rabbits, and day-old chicks. You show many forms of\nincubators, churns, farming apparatus, pumps, plows, lighting plants\nfor small farms, windmills, \"bug\" poisons, and poultry foods. And you\nalways add a big balloon, which you anchor, so that kids may soar\naloft until a windlass pulls it down. You fill us with food that\nwould kill a wild goat, but you still last! And may you always do so;\nfor, within your flapping, bulging canvas walls, city man rubs against\ntown man, rich and poor girls bump, snobs attain no right of way, and\na proud, happy boy or girl shows a \"First Class\" satin ribbon which a\nlovingly brought-up calf or poultry brood has won.\n\nOnly a satin ribbon, but, displaying it to a group of admiring young\npals brings to a child that natural thrill from accomplishing anything\nworthy of public acclaim. Such thrills will not crowd in as Maturity\nsupplants Youth; and so I say, \"a trio of our customary huzzas\" for any\nchild who can carry away a satin ribbon from a County Fair.\n\nBut what about our good Mayor during all this circus hullabaloo? Did\nimportant thoughts for still improving Branton Hills pass through his\nbusy mind? Not just now; but fond, anxious thoughts did; for his mind\nwas constantly on Nancy; tiny, darling Nancy, his baby girl. For,\nduring that noisy carnival, folks saw (or _thought_ so, you know), a\nbig bird with long shanks and a monstrous bill, circling round and\nround that small bungalow's roof, plainly looking for a spot to land\non. Lady Gadsby and old Doctor Wilkins saw it, too, and told Nancy that\nthat big hospital which our old Organization had built, was holding\na room for instant occupancy; and, as that big bird daily swung down,\ndown, down, almost grazing that small roof, Frank, poor chap, as shaky\nas at his church ritual, thirty months ago, staid away from Radio\nStation KBH, and stuck to that small bungalow as a fly sticks around a\nsugar bowl.\n\nFinally, on a crisp Autumn night, that soaring bird shot straight down\nwith such an assuring swoop, that old Doc Wilkins, indoors with Nancy,\nsaw it and said, quickly:--\n\n\"On your way, Nancy girl!!\" and that part of Branton Hills saw his\ncar racing hospitalwards, with Lady Gadsby fondly patting Nancy's\ntiny, cold hands, and saying just such loving things as a woman would,\nnaturally, to a young girl on such a trip. But Gadsby and Frank? Ah!\nPoor, half-crazy things! No car would do at all! _No, sir!!_ A car\nwas far too slow! And so, across lots, down into many a man's yard,\nand jumping high walls, shot two shadowy forms, arriving at that big\nhospital, badly blown, just as Lady Gadsby and old Doc Wilkins took\nNancy's arms, and got slowly to that big door with its waiting rolling\nchair.\n\nNow this stork's visit is nothing out of ordinary in World affairs.\nMillions and billions of visits has it, and its kind, flown--to king's\nmansion or a black Zulu woman's hut. But _this_ flight was poor\nFrank's initiation to that awful hour of blank panic, during which a\nyoung husband is boiling hot or icy cold in turn. God!! How still a\nhospital corridor is!! How doctors and assistants do float past without\nas much sound as falling snow! Oh! _How_ long Frank and His Honor\nsat, stood, or trod up and down, watching that room door!! What was\ngoing on? Was Nancy all right? Oh!! Why this prolonging of agonizing\ninactivity? Can't anybody say anything? _Isn't anybody around, at all?_\nBut hospital doctors and nursing staffs, though pitying a young chap,\nmust pass him up for that tiny lady, who now was but a tool in God's\nhands; in God's magic laboratory. And so---- _Ah!!_ Doctor Wilkins is\ncoming--_and smiling!!_\n\n\"A baby girl--and with a ripping good pair of lungs!\" but has to jump\nquick to catch Frank, who has sunk in a swoon. And Mayor Gadsby's\ncollar is as limp as a dish-rag!\n\nAh! Man, man, man! and woman, woman, woman! Just you two! God's only\nparts in His mighty plan for living actuality. Not only with Man and\nanimals, but also down,--way, _way_ down amongst plants. Just two\nparts. Only two!! And Baby, you tiny bunch of wriggling, gurgling\nhumanity, by that slowly ticking clock is _your_ turn in this mighty\nWorld, unavoidably arriving. Mama, Papa, and all of us will go on, for\na bit, growing old and gray, but you, now so young and frail, will\nstand sturdily, and willingly, in our vacancy; and carry on God's will!\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\nAs this is a history of a city I must not stay around any part too\nlong. So, as it was almost \"a small morning hour,\" Nina Adams, a widow,\nwas sitting up; for Virginia, a High School girl, was still out; and,\naround two-thirty, was brought back in a fast car; two youths actually\n_dumping_ an unconscious form on Nina's front porch, and dashing\nmadly away. But Nina Adams saw it; and, calling for aid in carrying\nVirginia indoors, put in a frantic call for old Doc Wilkins, an old,\nlong-ago school pal, who found Nina frantic from not knowing Virginia's\ncondition, nor why the pair of youths shot madly away without calling\nanybody. But it only took Doctor Wilkins an instant to find out what\nwas wrong; and Nina, noting his tight lips and growing scowl was in an\nagony of doubt.\n\n\"What _is_ it, Tom? _Quick!!_ I'm almost crazy!!\"\n\nDr. Wilkins, standing by Virginia's couch, said, slowly:--\n\n\"It's nothing to worry about, Nina. Virginia will pull through all\nright, by morning.\"\n\nBut that didn't satisfy Nina Adams, _not for an instant_, and Dr.\nWilkins, knowing that ironclad spirit of school days which would stand\nfor no obstructions in its path, saw that a \"blow-up\" was coming; but,\nthrough a kindly thought for this woman's comfort, did not say what his\ndiagnosis was, until Nina, now actually livid with worry, said:--\n\n\"Tom Wilkins! _Doctor_ Wilkins, if you wish,--I claim a natural right\nto know why my child is unconscious! And you, a physician, cannot, by\nlaw, withhold such information!!\"\n\nBut Wilkins, trying to find a way out of a most unhappy condition of\naffairs, said:--\n\n\"Now, Nina, you know I wouldn't hold anything from you if Virginia was\ncritically ill, but that is not so. If you'll only wait until morning\nyou'll find that I am right.\"\n\nBut this only built obstruction upon obstruction to Nina's strong will,\nuntil Dr. Wilkins, noticing coming total prostration, had to say:--\n\n\"Nina, Virginia is _drunk_; _horribly_ drunk.\"\n\n\"_Drunk!!_\" Widow Adams had to grab wildly at a chair, sinking into it;\nat first as limp as a rag, but instantly springing up, blood surging to\na throbbing brow. \"_Drunk!_ _Drunk!!_ _My_ baby drunk!! Tom, I thank\nyou for trying to ward off this shock; but I'll say right now, _with my\nhand on high_, that I am going to start a rumpus about this atrocity\nthat will rock Branton Hills to its foundations! Who _got_ this young\nschool-girl drunk? I know that Virginia wouldn't drink that stuff\nwillingly. How _could_ it occur? I pay through taxation for a patrolman\nin this district; in fact in _all_ districts of this city. What is\na patrolman for, if not to watch for just such abominations as this,\npray?\"\n\nDr. Wilkins didn't say, though probably thinking of a rumor that had\nrun around town for a month or two. At this point Virginia, partly\nconscious, was murmuring:--\n\n\"Oh, Norman! _Don't!!_ I _can't_ drink it! Oh! I'm _so_ sick!!\"\n\nThis brought forth all of Nina Adams' fury instantly.\n\n\"_Aha! Aha! Norman!_ So _that's_ it! That's Norman Antor, that\nlow-down, good-for-nothing night-owl! Son of our big Councilman Antor.\nSo!! It's 'Norman! I can't drink it'! Tom Wilkins, this thing is going\nto _court!!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout noon of that day, our good doctor, walking sadly along, ran\nacross Mayor Gadsby, in front of City Hall; and did His Honor \"_burn_\"\nat such an abomination?\n\n\"_What?_ High School boys _forcing_ young girls to drink? And right in\nour glorious Branton Hills? Oh, but, Doc! This can't pass without a\ntrial!\"\n\n\"That's all right, John; but a thorn sticks out, right in plain sight.\"\n\n\"Thorn? Thorn? What kind of a thorn?\" and our Mayor was flushing hard,\nas no kind of wild thoughts would point to any kind of thorns.\n\n\"That thorn,\" said Wilkins, \"is young Norman Antor; son of----\"\n\n\"_Not of Councilman Antor?_\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say that it is so,\" and Wilkins told of Virginia's\nhalf-conscious murmurings. \"And Nina wants to know why, with a\npatrolman in all parts of town, it isn't known that all this drinking\nis going on. I didn't say what I thought, but you know that a patrolman\ndon't go into dancing pavilions and night clubs until conditions\nsanction it.\"\n\n\"Who is supplying this liquor?\"\n\n\"Councilman Antor; but without knowing it.\"\n\nAll His Honor could say was to gasp:--\n\n\"How do you know that, Doc?\" and Wilkins told of four calls for him in\nfour days, to young girls, similarly drunk.\n\n\"And my _first_ call was to young Mary--Antor's tiny Grammar School\nkid, who was as drunk as Virginia; but, on coming out of it, told of\nrobbing Antor's pantry, in which liquor was always on hand for his\npolitical pals, you know; that poor kid taking it to various affairs\nand giving it to boys; and winning 'popularity' that way.\"\n\n\"So,\" said Gadsby, \"Councilman Antor's boy and girl, brought up in\na family with liquor always handy, now, with ignorant, childish\nbraggadocio, bring Councilman Antor into this mix-up! I'm sorry for\nAntor; but his pantry is in for an official visit.\"\n\nIt wasn't so long from this day that Court got around to this rumpus.\nTo say that that big room was _full_, would put it mildly. Although,\naccording to an old saying, \"a cat is only as big as its skin,\" that\nroom's walls almost burst, as groups of church organizations and law\nabiding inhabitants almost fought for admission; until standing room\nwas nothing but a suffocating jam. As Gadsby and Doc Wilkins sat\nwatching that sight, Gadsby said:--\n\n\"It's an outpouring of rightful wrath by a proud city's population;\nwho, having put out good, hard work in bringing it to its high\nstanding as a community, today, will not stand for anything that will\nput a blot on its municipal flag, which is, right now, proudly flying\non City Hall.\"\n\nAs Wilkins was about to say so, a rising murmur was rolling in from out\nback, for Norman Antor was coming in, in custody of a big patrolman,\nand with four youths, all looking, not only anxious, but plainly\nshowing humiliation at such an abomination against trusting young\ngirlhood. Scowls and angry rumblings told that high official, way up in\nback of that mahogany railing, that but a spark would start a riot. So,\nin a calm, almost uncanny way, this first trial of its kind in Branton\nHills got along to a court official calling, loudly:--\n\n\"Virginia Adams!!\"\n\nIf you think that you know what a totally still room is, by no kink\nof your imagination could you possibly know such an awful, frightful\n_hush_ as struck that crowd dumb, as Virginia, a tall, dark, willowy,\nstylish girl quickly took that chair, from which Truth, in all its\npurity, is customarily brought out. But Virginia was not a bit shaky\nnor anxious, nor doubtful of an ability to go through with this ugly\ntask.\n\nGadsby and Doc Wilkins sat watching Nina; Gadsby with profound\nsympathy, but Wilkins with an old school-pal's intuition, watching\nfor a blow-up. But Nina didn't blow up, that is, not visibly; but that\nfamous rigid will was boiling, full tilt; boiling up to a point for\nlanding, \"tooth and claw\" on our pompous Councilman's son, if things\ndidn't turn out satisfactorily.\n\nVirginia didn't occupy that stand long; it was only a half-sobbing\naccount of a night at a dancing pavilion; and with a sob or two from a\nwoman or girl in that vast crowd. All Virginia said was:--\n\n\"Norman Antor said I was a cry-baby if I wouldn't drink with him.\nBut I said, 'All right; I _am_ a cry-baby! And I always _will_ turn\n'cry-baby' if anybody insists that I drink that stuff.'\" (Just a short\nlull, a valiant fight for control, and)--\"But I _had_ to drink!! Norman\nwas tipping my chair back and John Allison was forcing that glass into\nmy mouth! I got so sick I couldn't stand up, and didn't know a thing\nuntil I found I was on a couch in my own parlor.\"\n\nA court official said, kindly:--\n\n\"That will do, Miss Adams.\"\n\nDuring this, Nina was glaring at Norman; but Virginia's bringing\nAllison into it, also, was too much. But Wilkins, watching narrowly,\nsaid, snappingly:--\n\n\"_Nina!_ This is a _court room_.\"\n\nNow this trial was too long to go into, word for word; so I'll say\nthat not only Norman Antor and Allison, but also our big, pompous\nCouncilman Antor, according to our popular slang, \"got in bad\"; and\nBranton Hills' dancing and night spots got word to prohibit liquor\nor shut up shop. Young Mary Antor was shown that liquor, in dancing\npavilions or in a family pantry was not good for young girls; and soon\nthis most disgusting affair was a part of Branton Hills' history. And\nwhat vast variations a city's history contains! What valorous acts by\nfar-thinking officials! What dark daubs of filth by avaricious crooks!\nWhat an array of past Mayors; what financial ups and downs; what growth\nin population. But, as I am this particular city's historian, _with\nstrict orthography controlling it_, this history will not rank, in\nvolubility, with any by an author who can sow, broadcast, all handy,\ncommon words which _continuously_ try to jump into it!\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nBranton Hills, now an up-to-today city, coming to that point of\nmotorizing all city apparatus, had just a last, solitary company\nof that class which an inhabitant frantically calls to a burning\nbuilding--Company Four, in our big shopping district; all apparatus of\nwhich was still animal drawn; four big, husky chaps: two blacks and\ntwo roans. Any thought of backing in any sort of motor apparatus onto\nthis floor, upon which this loyal four had, during many months, stood,\nchamping at bits, pawing and whinnying to start out that big door, in\ndaylight or night-gloom, calm or storm,--was mighty tough for old Dowd\nand Clancy. A man living day and night with such glorious, vivacious\nanimals, grows to look upon such as almost human. Bright, brainy,\nsparkling colts can win a strong hold on a man, you know.\n\nAnd now!! What form of disposal was awaiting \"Big Four\", as Clancy and\nDowd took a fond joy in dubbing this pair of blacks and two roans?\nClancy and Dowd didn't know anything but that a mass of cogs, piping,\nbrass railings, an intricacy of knobs, buttons, spark-plugs, forward\nclutch and so forth was coming tomorrow.\n\n\"_Aw!!_\" said Dowd, moaningly, \"you know, Clancy, that good old light\nshifting about and that light 'stomping' in that row of stalls, at\nnight; you know, old man, that happy crunching of corn; that occasional\ncough; that tail-swatting at a fly or crazy zigzagging moth; that grand\nanimal odor from that back part of this floor.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Clancy. \"And _now_ what? A loud whizz of a motor! A\nsuffocating blast of gas! and a dom thing a-standin' on this floor, wid\nno brain; wid nothin' lovin' about it. Wid no soul.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m,\" said Dowd, \"I dunno about an animal havin' a soul, but it's\ngot a thing not so dom far _from_ it.\"\n\nAs Clancy sat worrying about various forms of disposal for Big Four, an\nofficial phoning from City Hall, said just an ordinary, common word,\nwhich had Clancy hopping up and down, _furiously mad_.\n\n\"What's all this? What's all this?\" Dowd sang out, coming from a stall,\nin which a good rubbing down of a shiny coat, and continuous loving\npats had brought snuggling and nosing.\n\n\"_Auction!!_\" said Clancy, wildly, and sitting down with a thud.\n\n\"Auction? Auction for Big Four? _What?_ Put up on a block as you would\na Jap urn or a phony diamond?\"\n\n\"Uh-huh; that's what City Hall says.\"\n\nAn awful calm slunk insidiously onto that big smooth floor, as Dowd and\nClancy, chins on hands, sat,--just thinking! Finally Clancy burst out\nwith:--\n\n\"Aw! If an alarm would _only_ ring in, right now, to stop my brain from\ncracking! _Auction! Bah!!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA big crowd stood in City Park, including His Honor, many a Councilman,\nand, naturally, Old Bill Simpkins, who was always bound to know what\nwas going on. A loud, fast-talking man, on a high stand, was shouting:--\n\n\"All right, you guys! How much? How much for this big black? A mountain\nof muscular ability! Young, kind, willing, smart! How much? How much?\"\n\nBids abominably low at first, but slowly crawling up; crawling slowly,\nas a boa constrictor crawls up on its victim. But, _without fail_, as\na bid was sung out from that surging, gawking, chin-lifting mob, a\nwoman, way in back, would surpass it! And that woman hung on, as no boa\nconstrictor could! Gadsby, way down in front, couldn't fathom it, at\nall. Why should a woman want Big Four? A solitary animal, possibly, but\n_four!_ So His Honor, turning and making his way toward that back row,\nran smack into Nancy.\n\n\"Daddy! Lady Standish is outbidding all this crowd!\"\n\n\"Oho! So _that's_ it!\"\n\nSo Gadsby, pushing his way again through that jam, and coming to that\nmost worthy woman, said:--\n\n\"By golly, Sally! It's plain that you want Big Four.\"\n\n\"John Gadsby, you ought to _know_ that I do. Why! A man might buy that\nbig pair of roans to hitch up to a plow! Or hook a big black onto an\nash cart!\"\n\n\"I know that, Sally, but that small back yard of yours is----\"\n\n\"_John!!_ Do your Municipal occupations knock all past days' doings out\nof your skull? You _know_ that I own a grand, big patch of land out\nin our suburbs, half as big as Branton Hills. So this Big Four will\njust run around, jump, roll, kick, and loaf until doomsday, if I can\n_wallop_ this mob out of bidding.\"\n\nAs Lady Standish was long known as standing first in valuation on\nBranton Hills' tax list, nobody in that crowd was so foolish as to\nhang on, in a war of bidding, against _that_ bankroll. So Gadsby shook\nhands, put an arm about Nancy, walking happily away, as a roar of\nplaudits shot out from that crowd, for that loud, fast-talking man was\nannouncing:--\n\n\"_Sold! All four to Lady Standish!!_\"\n\nAs Gadsby and Nancy ran across Old Bill Simpkins, Gadsby said:--\n\n\"Bill, _you_ know that grand old day. Look! A building is burning! A\npatrolman has put in an alarm! And _now_ look! Coming down Broadway!\nTwo big blacks, and following on, two big roans! What grand, mighty\nanimals! Nostrils dilating; big hoofs pounding; gigantic flanks\nbulging; mighty lungs snorting; monstrous backs straining; thick, full\ntails standing straight out. Coming, sir! Coming, sir!! Just as fast as\nbrain and brawn can! And that gong-clanging, air-splitting, whistling,\nshining, sizzling, smoking four tons of apparatus roars past, grinding\nand banging on Broadway's paving! _You_ saw all that, Bill.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" said Simpkins, \"but a motor don't hurt our paving so much.\"\n\nAs Nancy took His Honor's arm again, Gadsby said:--\n\n\"Poor, cranky old Bill! Always running things down.\"\n\nBut how about Clancy and Dowd? On moving out from that big park, that\nhappy pair, if Knighthood was in bloom today, would bow low, and kiss\nfair Lady Standish's hand.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nOh, hum. Now that Nancy's baby is gurgling or squalling, according to\na full tummy, or tooth conditions; and Nancy is looking, as Gadsby\nsays, \"as good as a million dollars,\" I find that that busy young\nson-of-a-gun, Dan Cupid, is still snooping around Branton Hills. And\n_now_ who do you think is hit? Try to think of a lot of girls in\nGadsby's old Organization of Youth. No, it's not Sarah Young, nor Lucy\nDonaldson, nor Virginia Adams. It was brought to your historian in this\nway:--\n\nLady Gadsby and His Honor sat around his parlor lamp, His Honor\nnoticing that Lady G. was smiling, finally saying:--\n\n\"John.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"Kathlyn and John Smith,----\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I said that Kathlyn and John Smith want to----\"\n\n\"Oho! Aha!! I'll call up Pastor Brown to start right off dolling up his\nbig church!\"\n\n\"No, no! Not now! Wait about six months. This is only a troth. Folks\ndon't jump into matrimony, that way.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m! I don't know about that,\" said Gadsby, laughing; and thinking\nway back to that captivating lasso!\n\nJohn Smith was Branton Hills' famous church organist; and, at a small,\ndainty lunch, Kathlyn told of this troth. In a day or two about all\nBranton Hills' young girlhood had, on rushing in, told Kathlyn what a\ngrand chap John was; and all that town's young manhood had told John\nsimilar things about Kathlyn. So, as this is a jumpy sort of a story,\nanyway, why not skip months of happy ardor, and find how this tying of\nan additional knot in our Mayor's family will turn out? You know that\nKathlyn don't think much of pomp or show, and such a big church ritual\nas Nancy had is all right if you want it, but Kathlyn had fond thoughts\nof just a small, parlor affair, with only a group of old chums; and\n_no_ throwing of old boots, and \"sharp food-grains,\" which work\ndownward, to scratch your back, or stick in your hair as stubbornly as\nburrs.\n\n\"Such crazy doings,\" said Kathlyn, \"always look foolish. It's odd how\nanybody can follow up such antiquarian customs.\"\n\nAs Kathlyn's big night was drawing nigh, Lady Gadsby and Nancy had\nconstantly thought of a word synonymous with \"woman\", and that word is\n\"scrub.\" Which is saying that Gadsby's mansion was about to submit to\na gigantic scrubbing, painting, dusting, and so forth, so that Kathlyn\nshould start out on that ship of matrimony from a spic-span wharf. Just\nwhy a woman thinks that a grain of dust in a totally inconspicuous spot\nis such a catastrophic abnormality is hard to say; but if you simply\nbroach a thought that a grain of it _might_ lurk in back of a piano, or\nup back of an oil painting, a flood of soap-suds will instantly burst\nforth; and any man who can find any of his things for four days is a\nclairvoyant, or a magician!\n\nAs Gadsby sat watching all this his thoughts took this form:--\n\n\"Isn't it surprising what an array of things a woman can drag forth,\nburrowing into attics, rooms and nooks! Things long out of mind; an\n_old_ thing; a worn-out thing; but it has lain in that room, nook or\nbag until just such a riot of soap and scrubbing brush brings it out.\nAnd, as I think of it, a human mind could, and should go through just\nsuch a ransacking, occasionally; for you don't know _half_ of what an\naccumulation of rubbish is kicking about, in its dark, musty corridors.\nOld fashions in thoughts; bigotry; vanity; all lying stagnant. So why\nnot drag out and sort all that stuff, discarding all which is of no\nvaluation? About half of us will find, in our minds, a room, having on\nits door a card, saying: \"It Was Not So In My Day.\" Go _at_ that room,\nright off. That \"My Day\" is long past. \"Today\" is boss, now. If that\n\"My Day\" could crawl up on \"Today,\" what a mix-up in World affairs\nwould occur! Ox cart against aircraft; oil lamps against arc lights!\nSlow, mail information against radio! But, as all this stuff is laid\nout, what will you do with it? Nobody wants it. So I say, burn it, and\ntomorrow morning, how happy you will find that musty old mind!\"\n\nBut His Honor's mansion finally got back to normal as clouds of dust\nand swats and slaps from dusting cloths had shown Lady Gadsby and\nKathlyn that \"that parlor was simply awful\" though Gadsby, Julius and\nBill always had thought that \"It looks all right,\" causing Kathlyn to\nsay:--\n\n\"A man thinks all dust stays outdoors.\"\n\nThough marrying off a girl in church is a big proposition, it can't\ndiscount, in important data, doing a similar act in a parlor; for,\nas a parlor is a mighty small room in comparison with a church, you\ncan't point to an inch of it that won't do its small part on such an\noccasion; so a woman will find about a thousand spots in which to\nput tacks from which to run strings holding floral chains, sprays,\nor small lights. So Gadsby, Bill and Julius, with armfuls of string\nand mouthfuls of tacks, not only put in hours at pounding said tacks,\nbut an occasional vigorous word told that a thumb was substituting!\nBut what man wouldn't gladly bang his thumb, or bark his shins on a\nwobbly stool, to aid so charming a girl as Kathlyn? And, on that most\nromantically important of all days!!\n\nAnyway, that day's night finally cast its soft shadows on Branton\nHills. Night, with its twinkling stars, its lightning-bugs, and its\ncall for girls' most glorious wraps; and youths' \"swallowtails\", and\ntall silk hats,--is Cupid's own; lacking but organ music to turn it\ninto Utopia.\n\nAnd was Gadsby's mansion lit up from porch to roof? No. Only that\nparlor and a room or two upstairs, for wraps, mascara, a final\nhair-quirk, a dab of lip-stick; for Kathlyn, against all forms of\n\"vain display,\" said:--\n\n\"I'm only going to marry a man; not put on a circus for all Branton\nHills.\"\n\n\"All right, darling,\" said Gadsby, \"you shall marry in a pitch dark\nroom if you wish; for, as you say, a small, parlor affair is just as\nbinding as a big church display. It's only your vows that count.\"\n\nSo but a small group stood lovingly in Gadsby's parlor, as Parson Brown\nbrought into unity Kathlyn and John. Kathlyn was _radiantly_ happy; and\nJohn, our famous organist, was as happy with only charming Sarah Young\nat an upright piano, as any organist in a big choir loft.\n\nBut to Lady Gadsby and His Honor, this was, in a way, a sad affair;\nfor that big mansion now had lost two of its inhabitants; and, as many\nold folks know, a vast gap, or chasm thus forms, backward across which\nflit happy visions of laughing, romping, happy girlhood; happy hours\naround a sitting room lamp; and loving trips in night's small hours to\na room or two, just to know that a small girl was all right, or that\na big girl was not in a draft. But, though marrying off a girl _will_\nbring such a vacancy, that happy start out into a world throbbing with\nvitality and joy, can allay a bit of that void in a big mansion, or a\nsmall cabin. A birth, a tooth, a growth, a mating; and, again a birth,\na tooth, and so on. Such is that mighty Law, which was laid down on\nthat first of all days; and which will control Man, animal, and plant\nuntil that last of all nights.\n\nSo it was first Nancy, and now Kathlyn; and Branton Hills' gossips\nthought of Bill and Julius, with whom many a young, romantic maid would\ngladly sit in a wistaria-drooping arbor on a warm, moon-lit night;\nflighty maids with Bill, adoring his high class social gossip; studious\nmaids with Julius, finding much to think about in his practical talks\non physics, zoology, and natural history. But Bill and Julius had shown\nno liability of biting at any alluring bait on any matrimonial hook;\nand Gadsby, winking knowingly, would say:--\n\n\"Bill is too frivolous, just now; and Julius too busy at our Hall of\nNatural History. But just wait until Dan Cupid starts shooting again,\nand watch things whiz!\"\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nSarah, walking along past City Park on a raw, cold night, found a\ntiny,--oh so tiny,--puppy, whining, shaking and crying with cold.\nPicking up that small bunch of babyhood, Sarah was in quandary as just\nwhat to do; but Priscilla Standish, coming along, said:--\n\n\"Oh! Poor baby!! Who owns him, Sarah?\"\n\n\"I don't know; but say! Wouldn't your Ma----\"\n\n\"My Ma _would!!_ Bring him along, and wrap your cloak around him. It's\nawfully cold for so young a puppy.\"\n\nSo Lady Standish, with that \"back-yard zoo\" soon had his quaking\nbabyship lapping good warm milk, and a stumpy tail wagging as only\na tiny puppy's stumpy tail _can_ wag. Along towards six o'clock a\nvigorous pounding on Lady Standish's front door brought Priscilla, to\nfind Old Bill Simpkins with a tiny, wildly sobbing girl of about four.\nWalking into Lady Standish's parlor, Simpkins said:--\n\n\"This kid has lost a-a-a-crittur; I think it was a pup, wasn't it,\nkid?\"\n\nA vigorous up and down bobbing of a small shock of auburn hair.\n\n\"So,\" said Simpkins, \"I thought it might show up in your back-yard\ngang.\"\n\n\"It has, Bill, you _old grouch!!_\" for Lady Standish, as about all of\nBranton Hills' grown-ups, was in school with Bill. \"It's all right,\nnow, and warm and cuddly. Don't cry, Mary darling. Priscilla will bring\nin your puppy.\"\n\nAs that happy baby sat crooning to that puppy, also a baby, Old Bill\nhad to snort out:--\n\n\"Huh! A lot of fuss about a pup, I'll say!\"\n\n\"Oh, _pooh-pooh_, Bill Simpkins!\" said Lady S. \"Why _shouldn't_ a child\ncroon to a puppy? Folks bring all kinds of animals to my back yard, if\nsick or hurt. Want to walk around my zoo?\"\n\n\"_No!!_ No zoos for Councilman Simpkins! Animals ain't worth so much\nfuss!\"\n\n\"Pshaw, Bill! You talk ridiculously! I wish you could know of about\nhalf of my works. I want to show you a big Angora cat. A dog bit its\nfoot so I put a balm on it and wound it with cotton----\"\n\n\"You put _balm_ on a _cat's_ foot!! _Bah!_\"\n\nBut Lady Standish didn't mind Old Bill's ravings having known him so\nlong; so said:--\n\n\"Oh, how's that old corn of yours? Can't I put a balm----\"\n\n\"_No!_ You cannot! Mary, bring your pup; I'm going along.\"\n\nAs a happy tot was passing out that big, kindly front door, Sarah\nsaid:--\n\n\"Was Councilman Simpkins always so grouchy, Lady Standish?\"\n\n\"No. Not until John Gadsby 'cut him out' and won Lady Gadsby.\"\n\n\"Aha!! And a Ho, Ho!!\" said Sarah, laughing gayly. \"So folks had\nwhat you call 'affairs' way back, just as today!\" and also laughing\ninwardly, at what Lucy had said about this kindly Lady Standish and His\nHonor.\n\nAh! That good old schoolday, now so long past! How it bobs up,\nnow-a-days, if you watch a young lad and a happy, giggling lass\nholding hands or laughing uproariously at youthful witticisms. And how\ndiaphanous and almost imaginary that far-back day looks, if that girl\nwith whom you stood up and said \"I do,\" laughs, if you try a bit of\nromantic kissing, and says:--\n\n\"Why, John! How silly! You act actually childish!!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now it won't do any harm to hark back a bit on this history, to\nfind how our big Night School is doing. Following that first graduation\nday, many and many a child, and adult, too, had put in hours on\nvarious nights; and if you visit it you will find almost as many forms\nof instruction going on as you will find pupils; for thousands of\nfolks today know of topics which, with a bit of study, could turn out\nprofitably. Now Branton Hills had, as you know, built this school for\npublic instruction; and, as with all such institutions, visiting days\noccur. And _what_ a display of goods and workmanship! And what bright,\nhappy pupils, standing proudly back of it! For mankind knows hardly a\njoy which will surpass that of approval of his work.\n\nGadsby's party first took in a wood-working shop; finding small stands\nwhich fit so happily into many a living room nook; book racks for walls\nor floor; moth-proof bins, smoking stands, many with fancy uprights\nor inlaid tops; high chairs for tiny tots; arm chairs for old folks;\ncribs, tobacco humidors, stools, porch and lawn swings, ballbats,\nrolling pins, mixing boards; in fact about anything that a man can\nfashion from wood.\n\nAs an indication of practical utility coming from such public\ninstruction, a man told Gadsby:--\n\n\"I didn't know much about wood-working tools until I got into this\nclass. This thing I am making would cost about thirty dollars to\nbuy, but all it cost, so far, is two dollars and a half, for wood and\nglass,\" which Gadsby thought was worth knowing about; as so many of his\nCouncil had put forth so many complaints against starting such a school\nwithout charging for instruction. In an adjoining room His Honor's\nparty found boys banging and pounding happily; and, if you should\nask,--noisily,--on brasswork: making bowls, trays, lamp standards,\nphotograph stands, book supports and similar artistic things. Across\nfrom that was a blacksmith shop, with its customary flying sparks and\nsizzling cooling-vats.\n\nBut, by going upstairs, away from all this din, Gadsby, humming\nhappily, found Sarah and Lucy, Nancy and Kathlyn amidst a roomful of\ngirls doing dainty fancy-work. And what astonishing ability most of\nthat group _did_ show! Nancy bought a baby-cap which was on a par with\nanything in Branton Hills' shops; and though Kathlyn said it was \"just\ntoo cunning for anything\", John Smith's bungalow didn't contain anybody\n(just now!) whom it would fit.\n\nBut Lady Gadsby, with a party of Branton Hills matrons, was calling\nfor Gadsby to hurry down a long corridor to a loom-room, saying that\nsuch dainty rugs, mats and scarfs of cotton and silk hung all around\non walls or racks, it was truly astonishing that girls could do such\nfirst-class work, having had long hours of labor in Broadway's shops\nall day.\n\nAlthough most of our standard occupations found room for activity, an\noccasional oddity was run across. So His Honor's party found two boys\nand two girls working at that always fascinating art of glass-blowing.\nAnd what a dainty trick it is! And what an opportunity to burn a thumb\nor two, if you don't wait for things to cool! Things of charming form\n_and_ fragility, grow as by a magician's wand, from small glass tubings\nof various colors. Birds with glorious wings, ships of crystal sailing\non dark billows, tiny buildings in a thick glass ball which upon\nagitation, stirs up a snowstorm which softly lands on pink roof-tops;\nmany a fancy drinking glass and bowl, oil lamps, ash trays, and gaudy\nstrings of tiny crystal balls for adorning party gowns. And did Nancy\nwant to buy out this shop? And did Frank doubt his ability to do so?\nAnd did Kathlyn ask: \"How about it, Johnny?\" and did John Smith say:\n\"Nothing doing\"? It was just that. But it only shows that good old\nBranton Hills' inclination for aiding anything which looks worthy; and\nsuch a school I know you will admit, looks that way.\n\nTramping upstairs, still again, Gadsby and party found a class so\nvarying from all downstairs as to bring forth murmurs of joy, for this\nwas known as \"Music Floor\"; upon which was taught all forms of that\nmost charming of all arts--from solo work to community singing, from\nsolitary violin pupil to a full brass band. On our party's arrival,\nLucy, Doris and Virginia, hurrying from classrooms, sang, in trio, that\nsoft, slow Italian song, \"O Solo Mio;\" and, as Gadsby proudly said,\n\"Not for many a day had such _music_ rung out in Branton Hills;\" for\nmost girls, if in training with a practical vocalist, _can_ sing; and\nmost charmingly, too.\n\nIn a far room was a big string outfit of banjos, mandolins and guitars,\nhappily strumming out a smart, throbbing Spanish fandango, until His\nHonor could not avoid a swinging of body and tapping of foot; causing\nLady Gadsby to laugh, saying:--\n\n\"Rhythm has a mighty grip on Zulus, I am told.\"\n\nTo which our swaying Mayor said:--\n\n\"Anyway, a Zulu has a lot of fun out of it. If singing, playing and\ndancing could only crowd out sitting around and moping, folks would\nfind that a Zulu can hand us a tip or two on happy living.\"\n\nBut all music is not of string form; so, in a big auditorium, our party\nfound a full brass band of about fifty boys, with a man from Branton\nHills' Municipal Band as instructor. Now as Gadsby was, as you boys\nsay, \"not at all bad\" on a big bass horn in his youthful days, this\nband instructor, thinking of it, was asking him to \"sit it\" and play.\nSo, as Lady Gadsby, two girls, and two sons-in-law sat smiling and\ngiggling in a front row, and as fifty boys could hardly play, from\nlaughing, that big horn got such a blasting that it was practically a\nhorn solo! And Nancy, doubling up from giggling, said:--\n\n\"D-d-daddy! If-f-f-f B-b-b-barnum's circus hits town, you must join its\ncl-cl-clown band!\"\n\nBut I had to rush this happy party out of that building, as an awful\nthing was occurring but a block from it; which told its own story by\na lurid light, flashing through windows; clanging gongs, shrilling\nhorns and running, shouting crowds; for an old, long-vacant factory\nbuilding just across from City Hall, was blazing furiously. Rushing\nalong Broadway was that \"motor thing,\" with Clancy and Dowd clinging\nwildly on a running board. Pulling up at a hydrant, Clancy said to His\nHonor:--\n\n\"As I was a-hangin' onto this dom thing, a-thinkin' it was going to\nbang into a big jam at two crossroads, I says, By Gorra! that big pair\nof blacks wouldn't bang into _nuthin'!_ But this currazy contraption!\nIt ain't got no brain--no nuthin', no soul--nuthin' but halitosis!!\"\n\nAs Gadsby took a long look at Clancy's \"dom thing,\" a vision was\nwafting through his mind of a calm, sunny patch of land, way out\nin Branton Hills' suburbs, on which day by day, two big blacks and\ntwo big roans could--anyway, taking all things into account, a big\nconflagration, with its din, rush and panic, is no spot for such\nanimals as \"Big Four.\" As for Old Bill's squawk about animals \"ruining\nour paving,\" Gadsby thought that was but small talk, for paving,\nanyway, can't last for long. But, that _is_ a glorious spot, way out\namongst our hills!\n\nGadsby took his party to a room in City Hall from which that burning\nfactory was in plain sight; and as Nancy and Kathlyn stood watching\nthat awful sight a big wall, crashing down, had a crowd rushing to that\nspot.\n\nA man's form was brought out to a patrol wagon; and a boy, rushing\npast City Hall, sang out to Gadsby:--\n\n\"It's Old Man Donaldson!!\"\n\nTiny Nancy, almost swooning, said:--\n\n\"Donaldson? Oh, Kathy! That's Lucy's Dad, of Company Two, you know!\"\nand Frank and John Smith shot wildly downstairs to find out about it.\nIn an instant a sobbing girlish form was dashing madly from that Night\nSchool building towards our Municipal Hospital. It was Lucy; bright,\nalways laughing Lucy; but half an hour ago singing so happily in that\ngirls' trio.\n\nAs that big factory was still blazing furiously, Frank and John, coming\nin, said:--\n\n\"It was only a scalp wound, and a sprung wrist. Lucy is coming\nupstairs, now.\"\n\nLucy, coming in, badly blown from running and fright, said:--\n\n\"That wall caught Daddy; but it was so old and thin it didn't crush\nhim. Oh! _How_ I worry if that alarm rings!\"\n\n\"But,\" put in Nancy, \"it's _man's_ work. Pshaw!! What good am _I_? Why,\nI couldn't do a thing around that factory, right now! Look at my arm!\nAbout as big as a ball bat!\" and as Frank took that sad, tiny form in\nhis arms, Gadsby said:--\n\n\"All throughout Natural History, Nancy, you will find man built\nbig and strong, and woman small and frail. That is so that man can\nobtain food for his family, and that woman may nourish his offspring.\nBut today, I am sorry to say, you'll find girls working hard, in\ngymnasiums, fondly hoping to attain man's muscular parity. How silly!!\nIt's going straight against all natural laws. Girls _can_ find a lot of\nbodily good in gymnasiums, I'll admit! but _not_ that much. And as for\nyour 'ball-bat' arm, as you call it, what of it? You'd look grand, now\nwouldn't you, with Frank's big oak-branch arms hanging way down to your\nshins. But that ball-bat arm can curl around your tiny baby as softly\nas a down pillow. Aw, darling! _Don't_ say you can't do anything;\nfor _I_ know you can. How about our old Organization of Youth days?\nYou,----\"\n\nAnd Nancy, now laughing, said, gaily:--\n\n\"Oho! Our old Organization! What fun it was! But, Daddy, I don't know\nof any young crowd following us up.\"\n\n\"No. Our young folks of today think such things too much work;\" and,\nas that old factory was but a mass of ruins now, and midnight was\napproaching, Gadsby's family was soon in that mythical Land of Nod, in\nwhich no horns blow, no sparks fall; only occasionally a soft gurgling\nfrom a crib in Nancy's bungalow.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nIt is an odd kink of humanity which cannot find any valuation in\nspots of natural glory. But such kinks do run riot in Man's mind,\noccasionally, and Branton Hills ran up against such, on a Council\nnight; for a bill was brought up by Old Bill Simpkins for disposal of\nCity Park to a land company, for building lots! At first word of such\na thought, Gadsby was totally dumb, from an actual impossibility of\nthinking that any man, bringing up such a bill, wasn't plumb crazy!\n\n\"_What!_ Our main Park; including our Zoo?\"\n\n\"Just that,\" said Simpkins. \"Just a big patch of land, and a foolish\nbatch of animals that do nobody any good. You can't hitch a lion up to\na city dump cart, you know; nor a hippopotamus to a patrol wagon. What\ngood is that bunch of hair and horns, anyway? And that park! _Bah!!_\nJust grass, grass, grass! Branton Hills pays for planting that grass,\npays for sprinkling it, pays for cutting it--and _throws it away!_ So I\nsay, put it into building lots, and draw good, solid cash from it.\"\n\nAn Italian Councilman, Tony Bandamita, was actually boiling during\nthis outburst; and, in a flash, as Simpkins quit, was up, shouting:--\n\n\"I gotta four bambinos. My bambinos playa in thatta park: run, jumpa\nand rolla. Grow bigga an' strong. My woman say no coulda do thatta if\nplaya all day on bricka walks. I say no buncha land sharks buya thatta\nPark!! How many you guys go to it, anyway? Huh? Notta many! But _go!!_\nWalk around; sniffa its blossoms; look at grand busha; sit on softa\ngrass! You do thatta, an' _I_ know you not stick no building on it!!\"\n\nSo, at Mayor Gadsby's instigation, Council did not ballot on Simpkins'\nbill; and said it would go, as Tony thought only right, and \"look atta\ngooda busha.\"\n\nIn a day or two this pompous body of solons was strolling about that\nbig park. No man with half a mind could fail to thrill at its vistas of\nshrubs, ponds, lawns, arbors, fancy fowl, small pavilions and curving\nshady pathways. As Gadsby was \"takinga his owna looka,\" Old Bill\nSimpkins, coming a-snorting and a-fussing along, sang out, gruffly:--\n\n\"All right; this is it! This is that grand patch of grass that pays\nBranton Hills no tax!\"\n\nBut Gadsby was thinking--and thinking hard, too. Finally saying:--\n\n\"Bill, supposing that any day you should walk along that big Pathway\nknown in Sunday School as 'Our Straight But Narrow Way.' You would find\ncoming towards you, all sorts of folks: a king, roaring past in his big\nchariot, a capitalist with his hands full of bonds, an old, old lady,\non a crutch. Such passings would bring to you various thoughts. But,\nsupposing it was a possibility that you saw _Bill Simpkins_ coming your\nway. Aha! What an opportunity to watch that grouchy old--\"\n\n\"That _what_?\"\n\n\"I'll say it again: that grouchy old crab. How you _would_ gawk at him,\nthat most important of all folks, to you. How you would look at his\nclothing, his hat, his boots! That individual would pass an inquiry\nsuch as you had not thought it a possibility to put a man up against.\nBill, I think that if you _should_ pass Councilman Simpkins on that Big\nPathway, you would say: 'What a grouchy old crittur that was!'\"\n\nOld Bill stood calmly during this oration, and, looking around that big\npark, said:--\n\n\"John, you know how to talk, all right, all right. I'll admit that\nthings you say do do a lot of good around this town. But if I should\nrun across this guy you talk about, on that vaporous highway, or\n'boardwalk', as _I_ should call it,--I'd say, right out good and loud:\nHi! You!! Hurry back to Branton Hills and put up a block of buildings\nin that silly park!\" and Gadsby, walking away, saw that an inborn grouch\nis as hard to dig out as a wisdom tooth.\n\nNow this Council's visit on this particular day, was a sly plan of\nGadsby's, for His Honor is, you know, Youth's Champion, and having\nknown many an occasion on which Youth has won out against Council\nopposition. So, our big City officials, strolling around that park,\nsoon saw a smooth lawn upon which sat, stood, or ran, almost a\nthousand small tots of from four to six. In dainty, flimsy outfits,\nmany carrying fairy wands, it was a sight so charming as to thaw out\na brass idol! Amidst this happy party stood a tall shaft, or mast,\nhaving hanging from its top a thick bunch of long ribbons, of pink,\nlilac, gray, and similar dainty colors; and around it stood thirty\ntots--thirty tiny fists all agog to grasp thirty gay ribbons. Old Bill\ntook a look, and said, growlingly, to His Honor:--\n\n\"What's all this stuff, anyway?\"\n\n\"Bill, and Branton Hills' Council,\" said Gadsby, \"today is May\nDay--that day so symbolic of budding blossoms, mating birds and sunny\nsky. You all know, or _ought_ to, of that charming custom of childhood\nof toddling round and round a tall mast in and out, in and out,--thus\nwinding gay ribbons about it in a spiral. That is but a small part\nof what this Park can do for Branton Hills. But it is an important\npart; for happy childhood grows up into happy adults, and happy\nadults\"--looking right at Councilman Simpkins--\"_can_ form a happy City\nCouncil.\"\n\nNow a kid is always a kid; and a kid knows just how any sport should\ngo. So, just by luck, a tot who was to hold a gay ribbon didn't show\nup; and that big ring stood waiting, for that round-and-round march\n_just couldn't_ start with a ribbon hanging down! But a kid's mind is\nmighty quick and sharp; and a small tot of four had that kind of mind,\nsaying:--\n\n\"Oh! That last ribbon! Isn't anybody going to hold it?\"\n\nNow historians shouldn't laugh. Historians should only put down what\noccurs. But I, _your_ historian of Branton Hills, not only had to\nlaugh, but to _roar_; for this tot, worrying about that hanging ribbon,\nsaw our big pompous Council group looking on. Now a Council is nothing\nto a tot of four; just a man or two, standing around. So, trotting up\nand grasping Old Bill's hand, this tot said:\n\n\"_You'll_ hold it, won't you?\"\n\n\"_What!!_\" and Simpkins was all colors on throat and brow as Branton\nHills' Council stood, grinning. But that baby chin was straining up,\nand a pair of baby arms was pulling, oh, _so_ hard; and, in a sort\nof coma, big, pompous, grouchy Councilman Simpkins took that hanging\nribbon! A band struck up a quick march, and round and round trod that\nhappy, singing ring, with Old Bill looming up as big as a mountain\namongst its foothills! Laugh? I thought His Honor would _burst!_\n\nAs that ribbon spiral got wound, Simpkins, coming back, said, with a\ngrowl:--\n\n\"I was afraid I would tramp on a kid or two in that silly stunt.\"\n\n\"It wasn't silly, Bill,\" said Gadsby. \"It was _grand!_\" And Tony\nBandamita sang out:--\n\n\"Gooda work, Councilmanna! My four bambinos walka right in fronta you,\nand twista ribbons!\"\n\nSimpkins, though, would only snort, and pass on.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nOn a warm Sunday, Kathlyn and Julius, poking around in Branton Hills'\nsuburbs, occasionally found an odd formation of fossilization,\ninstalling it amidst our Hall of Natural History's displays. Shortly\nfollowing such an installation, a famous savant on volcanic activity\nnoting a most propitious rock formation amongst Julius' groups, thought\nof cutting into it; for ordinary, most prosaic rocks _may_ contain\nsurprising information; and, upon arriving at Branton Hills' railway\nstation, ran across old Pat Ryan, czar of its trunk room.\n\n\"Ah, my man! I want to find a lapidary.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"It isn't a 'what,' it's a lapidary.\"\n\n\"Lapidary, is it? Lapidary, lapidary, lapi--lapi--la--. No, I----\"\n\nNow this savant was in a hurry, and said, snappily:--\n\n\"But a city as big as Branton Hills _has_ a lapidary, I trust!\"\n\n\"Oh, Branton Hills has a lot of things. But, wait a bit! It ain't a\nlavatory what you want, is it?\"\n\nBut at this instant, to old Pat's salvation, Kathlyn, passing by,\nsaid:--\n\n\"All right, Pat. I know about this;\" and, both taking a taxi, old Pat\nwalking round and round, scratching his bald crown, was murmuring:\n\n\"Lapid----Aho! I got it! It's probably a crittur up at that zoo! I\nain't forgot that hop, skip and jump, walloping Australian tornado! And\nnow His Honor has put in a lapidary!! I think I'll go up with that old\ncanvas bag! But why all sich high-brow stuff in naming critturs? This\nlapidary thing might turn out only a rat, or a goofy bug!\"\n\nBut that _fairy_ bug, Dan Cupid, goofy or not, as you wish, was\nbuzzing around again; and, though this story is not of wild, romantic\ninfatuations, in which rival villains fight for a fair lady's hand, I\nam bound to say that Cupid has put on an act varying _much_ from his\nworks in Gadsby's mansion; for _this_ arrow from his bow caught two\nyoung folks to whom a dollar bill was as long, broad and high as City\nHall. Both had to work for a living; but by saving a bit, off and on,\nSarah Young, who, you know, with Priscilla Standish first thought of\nour Night School, and Paul Johnson, who did odd jobs around town, such\nas caring for lawns, painting and \"man-of-all-work,\" had put by a small\nbank account. Paul was an orphan, as was Sarah, who had grown up with\na kindly old man, Tom Young; his \"old woman,\" dying at about Sarah's\nfourth birthday. (That word \"old woman,\" is common amongst Irish folks,\nand is not at all ungracious. It _had_ to crawl into this story,\nthrough orthographical taboos, you know.) But Sarah, now a grown young\nlady, had that natural longing for a spot in which a woman might find\nthat joy of living, in having \"things to do for just us two\" if bound\nby Cupid's gift--matrimony.\n\nMany a day in passing that big church of Nancy's grand display, or\nGadsby's rich mansion, Sarah had thought fondly about such things; for,\nas with any girl, marrying amidst blossoms, glamour and organ music was\na goal, to attain which was actual bliss. But such rituals call for\ncash; and lots of it, too. Also, Old Tom Young had no room in any way\nfit for such an occasion.\n\nSo Sarah would walk past, possibly a bit sad, but looking forward to\na coming happy day. And it wasn't so far off. My, no! As Nancy had\nthought April was \"a million months long,\" Sarah's days swung past in a\ndizzy whirl; during which, in company with Paul on Saturday nights, a\nsmall thing or two was happily bought for that \"Cupid's Coop,\" as both\nfound a lot of fun in calling it. But Sarah naturally had girl chums,\njust as Nancy and Kathlyn had; for most of that old Organization was\nstill in town; and many a gift found its way to this girl who, though\npoor in worldly goods, was as rich as old King Midas in a bright, happy\ndisposition; for anybody who didn't know that magic captivation of\nSarah Young's laugh, that rich crown of light, fluffy hair, or that\ngrand, proud, upright walk, wasn't amongst Branton Hills' population.\nPaul, scratching around shady paths, a potato patch or two, front\nyards, back yards, and city parks, was known to many an old family man;\nwho upon knowing of his coming variation in living conditions, thought\nway, way back to his own romantic youth; so Paul, going to Sarah at\nnight, brought small but practical gifts for that \"coop.\"\n\nAs Sarah and Paul stood in front of City Hall on a hot July night,\nSarah scanning Branton Hills' \"Post\" for \"vacant rooms,\" who should\nwalk up but His Honor! And that kindly hand shot out with:--\n\n\"Aha! If it isn't Paul and Sarah! What's Sarah hunting for, Paul?\"\n\n\"Sarah is looking for a room for us, sir.\"\n\n\"_Us_? Did you say 'us'? Oho! H-mmm! I'm on! How soon will you want it?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Sarah, blushing, \"not for about a month.\"\n\n\"But,\" said His Honor, \"you shouldn't start out in _a_ room. You would\nwant from four to six I should think.\"\n\nSarah, still ogling that \"rooms\" column said, softly:--\n\n\"Four to six rooms? That's just grand if you can afford such. But,----\"\n\n\"Wait!\" said Gadsby, who, taking Paul's and Sarah's arms, and strolling\nalong, told of a small six-room bungalow of his, just around from\nNancy's.\n\n\"And you two will pay just nothing a month for it. It's yours, from\nfront porch to roof top, as a gift to two of my most loyal pals.\"\n\nAnd instantly a copy of Branton Hills' \"Post\" was blowing across\nBroadway in a fluky July wind!\n\nNow, as this young pair was to start out frugally, it wouldn't do to\nlay out too much for, as Sarah said, \"about forty words by a pastor,\nand a kiss.\"\n\nSo only Priscilla stood up with Sarah; and Bill Gadsby, in all his\nsartorial glory, with Paul, in Parson Brown's small study; both girls\nin dainty morning clothing; Sarah carrying a bunch of gay nasturtiums,\nclaiming that such warm, bright colorings would add as much charm to\nthat short occasion as a thousand dollars' worth of orchids. Now, such\ngirls as Sarah, with that capacity for finding satisfaction so simply,\ndon't grow as abundantly as hollyhocks--and Paul found that Gadsby's\nold Organization was a group knowing what a dollar is: just a dollar.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nOccasionally a sight bobs up without warning in a city, which starts\na train of thought, sad or gay, according to how you look at it. And\nso, Lucy, Priscilla, and Virginia Adams, walking along Broadway, saw a\ncrowd around a lamp post, upon which was a patrol-box; and, though our\ngirls don't customarily follow up such sights, Lucy saw a man's form\nsprawling flat up against that post, as limp as a rag. Priscilla said,\nin disgust:--\n\n\"_Ugh!!_ It's Norman Antor! Drunk again!!\" and Virginia, hastily\ngrasping both girls' arms and hurrying past, said:--\n\n\"So!! His vacation in jail didn't do him any good! But, still, it's\ntoo bad. Norman is a good looking, manly lad, with a good mind and a\nthorough schooling. And _now_ look at him! A _common drunk!!_\"\n\nPriscilla was sad, too, saying:--\n\n\"Awful! Awful for so young a chap. What is his Dad doing now?\"\n\n\"Still in jail,\" was all Virginia could say; adding sadly: \"I do\npity poor young Mary, who sold Antor's liquor, you know. Doris says\nthat lots of school-girls snub that kid. Now that's not right. It's\ndownright _horrid!_ Mary was brought up in what you almost might call\na pool of liquor, and I don't call it fair to snub a child for that;\nfor you know that, not only 'Past' Councilman Antor, but also _Madam_\nAntor, got what our boys call 'lit-up' on many public occasions.\nAntor's pantry was _full_ of it! Which way could that poor kid look\nwithout finding it? You know Mary is not so old as most of us; and I'm\njust going to _go_ to that child and try to bring a ray of comfort into\nthat young mind. That rum-guzzling Antor family!! _Ugh!!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut a city also has amusing sights; and our trio ran plump into that\nkind, just around a turn; for, standing on a soap box, shouting a\nhigh-sounding jargon of rapidly shot words, was Arthur Rankin, an\noriginal Organization lad; a crowd of boys, a man or two, and a woman\nhanging laughingly around. Our trio's first inkling as to what it was\nall about was Arthur's hail to Priscilla:--\n\n\"Aha! Branton Hills' fair womanhood is now approaching!!\"\n\nNow if our trio didn't know Arthur so thoroughly, such girls might\nbalk at this publicity. But Priscilla and Arthur had had many a\n\"slapping match\" long ago, arising from childhood's spats; Priscilla\noriginally living on an adjoining lot, and was Arthur's \"first girl;\"\nwhich according to his old Aunt Anna, \"was just silly puppy stuff!\" So\nnobody thought anything of this public hail and Arthur was raving on\nabout \"which puts an instant stop to all pain; will rid you of anything\nfrom dandruff to ingrowing nails; will build up a strong body from a\npuny runt; will grow hair on a billiard-ball scalp, and _taboo_ it on a\nlady's chin; will put a glamorous gloss on tooth or nail; stop stomach\ngrowls; oil up kinky joints, and bring you to happy, smiling days\nof Utopian bliss! How many, Priscilla? Only a dollar a box; two for\ndollar-sixty!\"\n\nPriscilla, laughing, said:--\n\n\"Not any today, thank you, Art! All I want is a pair of juicy lamb\nchops--a dish of onions--a dish of squash--a dish of carrots--a\npint of milk--potato-chips--hot biscuits--cold slaw--custard\npudding--nuts--raisins----\"\n\n\"_Whoa_, Priscilla! Hop right up on this box! I know that word-slinging\nability of old\" and as that crowd was fading away, Priscilla said:--\n\n\"This is odd work for you, Arthur; _you_ so good a draughtsman. What's\nup?\"\n\nAnd Arthur, a happy, rollicking boy, having always had all such things\nas most boys had, with a Dad making good pay as a railroad conductor,\ntold sadly of an awful railway smash-up which took \"Dad\" away from four\nsmall Rankin orphans, whom Arthur was now supporting; and a scarcity of\njobs in Branton Hills and of trips to surrounding towns, always finding\nthat old sign out: \"No Work Today.\" Of this soap box opportunity\nbobbing up, which was now bringing in good cash. So our girls found\nthat our Branton Hills boys didn't shirk work of any kind, if brought\nright up against want.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\nBut what about Branton Hills' municipal affairs, right now? In two\nmonths it was to ballot on who should sit in past-Councilman Antor's\nchair; and a campaign was on which was actually sizzling. And in\nwhat a contrast to our city's start! For it has grown rapidly;\nand, in comparison to that day upon which a thousand ballots was\na big out-pouring of popular clamor now many politicians had City\nHall aspirations. And _who_ do you think was running for Council,\nnow? William Gadsby! Popularly known as Bill! Bill, Branton Hills'\nfamous dandy; Bill, that consummation of all Branton Hills girls'\nmost romantic wish; Bill, that \"outdoor part\" of Branton Hills' most\naristocratic tailor shop! Naturally, opposing groups fought for that\nvacancy; part of our population clamoring loudly for Bill, but with\nmany just as strongly against him. So it was:--\n\n\"Put Bill Gadsby in!! Bill has all our Mayor's good points! Bill will\nwork for all that is upright and good!\"\n\nAnd also:--\n\n\"_What!_ Bill Gadsby? Is this town plumb crazy? Say! If you put that\nfop in City Hall you'll find all its railings flapping with pink satin\nribbons; a janitor at its main door, squirting vanilla on all who go\nin; and its front lawn will turn into a pansy farm! Put a _man_ in City\nHall, not a sissy who thinks out 'upsy-downsy, insy-outsy' camping\nsuits for girls!\"\n\nBut though this didn't annoy Bill, it _did_ stir up Nancy, with:--\n\n\"Oh! That's just an abomination! _Such_ talk about so grand a young\nchap! But I just saw a billboard with a sign saying: 'Bill Gadsby for\nCouncil;' so, probably I shouldn't worry, for Bill is as good as in.\"\n\n\"Baby,\" said Gadsby, kindly, \"that's only a billboard, and billboards\ndon't put a man in City Hall. It's _ballots_, darling; _thousands_ of\nballots, that fill Council chairs.\"\n\n\"But, Daddy, I'm going to root for Bill. I'll stand up on a stump, or\nin a tip-cart, or----\"\n\n\"Whoa! Wait a bit!\" and Gadsby sat down by his \"baby girl,\" saying:\n\"You can't go on a stumping campaign without knowing a lot about\nmunicipal affairs; which you don't. Any antagonist who knows about\nsuch things would out-talk you without half trying. No, darling, this\npolitical stuff is too big for you. You just look out for things in\nthat small bungalow of yours, and allow Branton Hills to fight to put\nBill in. You know my old slogan:--'Man at a city's front; woman at a\ncabin door.'\"\n\nAnd Nancy, fondly stroking his hand, said:\n\n\"Man at a city's front! What a grand post for a man! A city, a big,\nrushing, dashing, slamming, banging, boiling mass of humanity! A city;\nwith its bright, happy, sunny parks; and its sad, dark slums; its rich\nmansions and its shanty-town shacks; its shops, inns, shows, courts,\nairports, railway stations, hospitals, schools, church groups, social\nclubs, and,--and,--_Oh!_ _What_ a magic visualization of human thought\nit is! But it is as a small child. It looks for a strong arm to support\nits first toddlings; for adult minds to pilot it around many pitfalls;\nand onward, _onward!!_ To a shining goal!!\" and Nancy's crown of rich\nbrown hair sank lovingly in Gadsby's lap.\n\nDuring this outburst Gadsby had sat dumb; but finally saying, proudly:--\n\n\"So, ho! My baby girl has grown up! Dolls and sand-digging tools\ndon't call, as of old. And small, dirty paws, and a tiny smudgy chin,\ntransform, almost in a twinkling into charming hands and a chin of\nmaturity. My, my! It was but a month or two ago that you, in pig-tails\nand gingham----\"\n\n\"No, Daddy! It was a _mighty long_ month or two ago; and it's not\npig-tails and gingham, now, but a husband and a baby.\"\n\n\"All right, kid; but as you grow old, you'll find that, in glancing\nbackwards, months look mighty short; and small tots grow up, almost in\na night. A month _from now_ looks awfully far off; but _last month_?\nPff! That was only last night!\"\n\nThus did Nancy and His Honor talk, until a vigorous honking at his curb\ntold of Frank, \"looking for a cook,\" for it was six o'clock.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\nAny man with so kindly a disposition toward Youth as has brought our\nMayor forward in Branton Hills' history, may, without warning, run\nacross an occasion which holds an opportunity for adding a bit of joy\nin living. So, as Gadsby stood, on a chilly fall day, in front of that\nbig glass building which was built for a city florist, admiring a\ncharming display of blossoming plants, a small girl, still in Grammar\nSchool, said, shyly:--\n\n\"Hulloa.\"\n\n\"Hulloa, you. School out?\"\n\n\"On Saturdays, school is always out.\"\n\n\"That's so; it _is_ Saturday, isn't it? Going in?\"\n\n\"_In!!_ My, no! _I_ can't go into that fairyland!\"\n\n\"No? Why not, pray?\"\n\n\"Aw! I dunno; but nobody has took kids in.\"\n\n\"Took? Took? Say, young lady, you must study your grammar book. Branton\nHills schools don't----\"\n\n\"Uh-huh; I know. But a kid just can't--\"\n\n\"By golly! A kid _can!_ Grab my hand.\"\n\nNow, many a fairy book has told, in glowing words, of childhood's joys\nand thrills at amazing sights; but _no_ fairy book _could_ show, in\ncold print, what Gadsby ran up against as that big door shut, and a\nchild stood stock still--and _dumb!_ Two small arms hung limply down,\nagainst a poor, oh, _so_ poor skirt; and two big staring brown orbs\ntook in that vision of floral glory, which is found in just that kind\nof a big glass building on a cold, raw autumn day.\n\nGadsby said not a word; slowly strolling down a path amidst thousands\nof gladioli; around a turn, and up a path, along which stood pots and\npots of fuchsias, salvias and cannas; and to a cross-path, down which\nwas a big flat pansy patch, tubs of blossoming lilacs, and stiff,\nstraight carnations. Not a word from Gadsby, for his mind was on that\nsmall bunch of rapturous joy just in front of him. But, finally, just\nto pry a bit into that baby mind, His Honor said:--\n\n\"Looks kind of good, don't it?\"\n\nA tiny form shrunk down about an inch; and an also tiny bosom, rising\nand falling in a thralldom of bliss, finally put forth a long, long,--\n\n\"_O-h-h-h-h!!_\"\n\nIt was so long that Gadsby was in a quandary as to how such small lungs\ncould hold it.\n\nNow in watching this tot thrilling at its first visit to such a world\nof floral glory, Gadsby got what boys call \"a hunch;\" and said:--\n\n\"You don't find blossoms in your yard this month, _do_ you?\"\n\nIf you know childhood you know that thrills don't last long without a\ncall for information. And Gadsby got such a call, with:--\n\n\"No, sir. Is this God's parlor?\"\n\nNow Gadsby wouldn't, for anything, spoil a childish thought; so said,\nkindly:--\n\n\"It's part of it. God's parlor is awfully big, you know.\"\n\n\"_My_ parlor is awfully _small_; and not any bloss---- Oh! Wouldn't\nGod----?\"\n\nGadsby's hunch was now working, full tilt; and so, as this loving\nfamily man, having had four kids of his own, and this tot from a poor\nfamily with its \"awfully small\" parlor,--had trod this big glass\nbuilding's paths again and again; round and round, an almost monstrous\nsigh from an almost bursting tiny bosom, said:--\n\n\"I'll think of God's parlor, always and always and _always!!_\" and\nGadsby, on glancing upwards, saw a distinct drooping and curving of\nmany stalks; which is a plant's way of bowing to a child. And, at\nBranton Hills' following Council night a motion was---- But I said\nGadsby had a hunch. So, not only _this_ schoolgirl's awfully small\nparlor, but many such throughout Branton Hills' poor districts, soon\nfound a \"big girl\" from Gadsby's original Organization of Youth at its\nfront door with plants from that big glass building, in which our City\nFlorist works in God's parlor. (P.S. _Go_ with a child to _your_ City\nFlorist's big glass building. It's a _duty!_)\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nI am now going back to my saying that a city has all kinds of\ngoings-on; both sad and gay. So, as His Honor sat on his porch on a\nwarm spring day, a paragraph in Branton Hills' \"Post\" brought forth\nsuch a vigorous \"_Huh!_\" that Lady Gadsby was curious, asking:--\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nSo Gadsby said:--\"What do you think of _this_? It says:--'In a wild\nswaying dash down Broadway last night at midnight, past-Councilman\nAntor's car hit a hydrant, killing him and Madam Antor instantly.\nHighway Patrolman Harry Grant, who was chasing that car in from our\nsuburbs, says both horribly drunk, Antor grazing four cars, Madam\nshouting and singing wildly, with Grant arriving too tardily to ward\noff that final crash.'\"\n\nNow Lady Gadsby was, first of all, a woman; and so got up quickly,\nsaying:--\n\n\"Oh!! I must go down to poor young Mary, _right off!_\" and Gadsby sat\ntapping his foot, saying:--\n\n\"So Antor's pantry probably still holds that stuff. Too bad. But, oh,\nthat darling Mary! Just got into High School! Not long ago Lucy told\nus of girls snubbing that kid; but I trust that, from this horror, our\nBranton Hills girls will turn from snubbing to pity. This account says\nthat Madam Antor also was drunk. A _woman_ drunk!! And riding with a\nrum-sot man at a car's controls! _Woman!_ From History's dawn, Man's\nsoft, fond, loving pal! _Woman!_ For whom wars of blood and agony\ncut Man down as you would mow a lawn! _Woman!_ To whom infancy and\nchildhood look for all that is upright and good! It's too bad; too bad!\"\n\nAs in all such affairs you will always find two factions talking.\nTalking about what? Just now, about _Norman_ Antor. What would this\nwiping out of his folks do to him? Norman was now living with Mary\nand two aunts who, coming from out of town, would try to plan for our\ntwo orphans; try to plan for Norman; Norman, brought up in a pool of\nliquor! Norman: tall, dark and manly and with a most ingratiating\ndisposition----if not drunk. But nobody could say. A group would claim\nthat \"this fatality will bring him out of it;\" but his antagonists\nthought that \"That guy will always drink.\"\n\nA day or two from that crash, Nancy, coming into Gadsby's parlor, found\nLucy talking with Lady Gadsby, Lucy asking:--\n\n\"Nancy, who is with young Mary Antor now? That pair of aunts wouldn't\nstay, with all that liquor around.\"\n\n\"I just found out,\" said Nancy. \"Mary is living with Old Lady Flanagan\"\nand Lucy, though sad, had to laugh just a bit, saying:--\n\n\"Ha, ha! Old Lady Flanagan! What a _circus_ I had trying to pry a zoo\ndonation from that poor soul's skimpy funds! But, Nancy, Mary is in\nmighty good hands. That loving old Irish lady is a trump!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\nAlong in April, Gadsby sat finishing his morning toast as a boy,\nrushing in, put a \"Post\" on his lap with a wild, boyish gasp of:--\"_My\ngosh_, Mayor Gadsby, _Look!!_\" and Gadsby saw a word about a foot high.\nIt was W--A--R. Lady Gadsby saw it also, slowly sinking into a chair.\nAt that instant both Nancy and Kathlyn burst frantically in, Nancy\nlugging Baby Lillian, now almost two, and a big load for so small a\nwoman, Nancy gasping out:--\n\n\"Daddy!! Must Bill and Julius and Frank and John,----\"\n\nGadsby put down his \"Post\" and, pulling Nancy down onto his lap, said:--\n\n\"Nancy darling, Bill and Julius and Frank and John must. Old Glory is\ncalling, baby, and no Branton Hills boy will balk at _that_ call. It's\nawful, but it's a fact, now.\"\n\nLady Gadsby said nothing, but Nancy and Kathlyn saw an ashy pallor\non that matronly brow; and Gadsby going out without waiting for his\ncustomary kiss.\n\nFor what you might call an instant, Branton Hills, in blank, black\ngloom, stood stock still. But not for long. Days got to flashing past,\nwith that awful sight of girls, out to lunch, saying:--\n\n\"Four from our shop; and that big cotton mill has _forty-six_ who will\ngo.\"\n\nWith Virginia saying:--\n\n\"About all that our boys talk about is uniforms, pay, transportation,\narmy corps, divisions, naval squadrons, and so on.\"\n\nAn occasional Branton Hills politician thought that it \"might blow out\nin a month or two;\" but your Historian knows that it didn't; all of\nthat \"blowing\" consisting of blasts from that military clarion, calling\nfor mobilization.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDays! Days! Days! Finally, on May Fourth, that day of tiny Nancy's big\nchurch ritual, you know; that day, upon which any woman would look back\nwith romantic joy, Nancy, with Kathlyn, Lady Gadsby and His Honor,\nstood at Branton Hills' big railway station, at which our Municipal\nBand was drawn up; in back of which stood, in solid ranks, this city's\ngrand young manhood, Bill, Julius, Frank, John, Paul and Norman\nstanding just as straight and rigid as any. As that long, long troop\ntrain got its signal to start,--but you know all about such sights,\ngoing on daily, from our Pacific coast to Atlantic docks.\n\nAs it shot around a turn, and Gadsby was walking sadly toward City\nHall, a Grammar School boy hurrying up to him said:--\n\n\"_Wow!!_ I wish _I_ could go to war!\"\n\n\"Hi!\" said Gadsby. \"If it isn't Kid Banks!\"\n\n\"Aw! Cut that kid stuff! I'm _Allan_ Banks! Son of _Councilman_ Banks!\"\n\n\"Oh, pardon. But you don't want to go to war, boy.\"\n\n\"_Aw! I do too!!_\"\n\n\"But young boys _can't_ go to war.\"\n\n\"I know that; and I wish this will last until I grow so I _can_ go.\nIt's just grand! A big cannon says _Boom! Boom!_ and,--\"\n\n\"Sit down on this wall, boy. I want to talk to you.\"\n\n\"All right. Shoot!\"\n\n\"Now look, Allan. If this war should last until you grow up, just think\nof how many _thousands_ of troops it would kill. How many grand, good\nlads it would put right out of this world.\"\n\n\"Gosh! That's so, ain't it! I didn't think of guys dyin'.\"\n\n\"But a man _has_ to think of that, Allan. And _you_ will, as you grow\nup. My two big sons just put off on that big troop train. I don't know\n_how_ long Bill and Julius will stay away. Your big cannon might go\n_Boom!_ and hit Bill or Julius. Do you know Frank Morgan, Paul Johnson\nand John Smith? All right; that big cannon might hit that trio, too.\nNobody can say _who_ a cannon will hit, Allan. Now, you go right on\nthrough Grammar School, and grow up into a big strong man, and don't\nthink about war;\" and Gadsby, standing and gazing far off to Branton\nHills' charming hill district, thought: \"I think _that_ will bust up a\nwild young ambition!\"\n\nBut that kid, turning back, sang out:--\n\n\"Say!! If this scrap stops, and a _big_ war starts,--_Aha_, boy! You\njust watch Allan Banks! Son of Councilman Banks!!\" and a small fist was\npounding viciously on an also small bosom.\n\n\"By golly!\" said Gadsby, walking away, \"that's Tomorrow talking!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo now this history will drift along; along through days and months;\ndays and months of that awful gnawing doubt; actually a paradox, for\nit was a \"conscious coma;\" mornings on which Branton Hills' icy blood\nshrank from looking at our city's \"Post,\" for its casualty list was\nrapidly--too rapidly,--growing. Days and days of our girlhood and\nwomanhood rolling thousands of long, narrow cotton strips; packing\nloving gifts from many a pantry; Nancy and Kathlyn thinking constantly\nof Frank and John; Lucy almost down and out from worrying about Paul;\nKathlyn knowing just how Julius is missing his Hall of Natural History,\nand how its staff is praying for him; Nancy's radio shut down _tight_,\nfor so much as a thought of Station KBH was as a thrust of a sword.\nDays. Days. Days of shouting orators, blaring bands, troops from far\naway pausing at our big railway station, as girls, going through long\ntrains of cars, took doughnuts and hot drinks. In Gadsby's parlor\nwindow hung that famous \"World War flag\" of nothing but stars; nobody\nknowing at what instant a _gold_ star would show upon it. A star for\nBill; a star for Julius. Ah, Bill! Branton Hills' fop! Bill Gadsby now\nin an ill-fitting and un-stylish khaki uniform.\n\nGadby's mansion had no brilliant night lights, now; just his parlor\nlamp and a small light or two in hallways or on stairways. Only our\nMayor and his Lady, now worrying, worrying, worrying; but both of good,\nstaunch old Colonial stock; and \"carrying on\" with good old Plymouth\nRock stability; and Nancy's baby, Lillian, too young to ask why Grandma\n\"wasn't hungry,\" now; and didn't laugh so much.\n\nKathlyn got into our big hospital, this studious young lady's famous\nbiological and microscopic ability holding out an opportunity for most\npractical work; for Branton Hills' shot-torn boys would soon start\ndrifting in. And thus it was; with Lucy, Sarah and Virginia inspiring\nBranton Hills' womanhood to knit, knit, knit! You saw knitting on many\na porch; knitting in railway trains; knitting during band music in City\nPark; knitting in shady arbors out at our big zoo; at many a woman's\nclub,--and,--_actually_, knitting _in church!!_ Finally a big factory,\ndown by our railway station, put out a call for \"anybody, man or woman,\nwho wants to work on munitions;\" and many a dainty Branton Hills girl\nsat at big, unfamiliar stamping, punching, grinding, or polishing\noutfits; tiring frail young backs and straining soft young hands;\nknowing that this factory's output might,--and probably would,--rob a\nwoman across that big Atlantic of a husband or son,--but, still, it is\nwar!\n\nGadsby, smoking on his ivy-clad porch, as his Lady was industriously\nknitting, said, in a sort of soliloquy:--\n\n\"War! That awful condition which a famous military man in command of a\ndivision, long ago, said was synonymous with Satan and all his cohorts!\nWar! That awful condition of human minds coming down from way, _way_\nback of all history; that vast void during which sympathy was not\nknown; during which animals fought with tooth, claw or horn; that vast\nvoid during which wounds had no soothing balm, until thirst, agony or a\nfinal swoon laid low a gigantic mammoth, or a tiny, gasping fawn! But\nnow, again, in this grand day of Man's magically growing brain, this\nday of kindly crooning to infants in cribs; kindly talks to boys and\ngirls in school; and blood-tingling orations from thousands of pulpits\nupon that Holy Command: 'Thou Shalt Not Kill,' now, _again_, Man is out\nto kill his own kind.\" And Lady Gadsby could only sigh.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\n\nAs this story has shown, _Youth_, if adults will only admit that it has\nany brains at all, will stand out, today, in a most promising light.\nPhilosophically, Youth is Wisdom in formation, and with many thoughts\nstartling to adult minds; and, industrially, this vast World's coming\nstability is now, _today_, in its hands; growing slowly, as a blossom\ngrows from its bud. If you will furnish him with a thorough schooling,\nyou can plank down your dollar that Youth, _starting out_ from this\nmiraculous day, will not lag nor shirk on that coming day in which\nold joints, rusty and crackling, must slow down; and, calling for an\noil can, you will find that Youth _only_, is that lubrication which\ncan run Tomorrow's World. But Youth must not go thinking that all its\nplans will turn out all right; and young Marian Hopkins found this out.\nMarian, you know, took part in our airport initiation. But Marian,\nonly a kid at that day, has grown up--or half-way up, anyway, and just\ngraduating from Grammar School; upon which big day a child \"knows\" as\nmuch as any famous savant of antiquity! But, as this story runs in\nskips and jumps, strict chronological continuity is not a possibility.\nSo, Marian is now half grown-up. Now that big airport, as you also\nknow, was just back of Marian's back yard; and as that yard was much\ntoo big for anything that Marian's Dad could do with it, it was put\nup for disposal. But nobody would go to look at it; to say nothing\nof buying it. But Old Bill Simpkins, past antagonist of Gadsby's\nOrganization of Youth, did go out to look at it; but said, with his\ncustomary growl:--\n\n\"Too many aircraft always roaring and zooming. Too far out of town. And\nyou ask too much for it, anyway.\"\n\nBut Marian thought that Branton Hills, as a municipality, should\nown it; figuring that that airport would grow, and that yard was\npractically a part of it, anyway. So Marian, going to His Honor, as\nabout anybody in town did, without an instant's dallying, \"told him,\"\n(!) what his Council should do.\n\n\"But,\" said Gadsby, \"what a City Council should do, and what it _will_\ndo, don't always match up.\"\n\n\"Can't I go and talk to it?\"\n\n\"_What!_ To our Council? No; that is, not as a body. But if you can\nrun across a Councilman out of City Hall you can say what you wish. A\nCouncilman is just an ordinary man, you know.\"\n\nBut a Councilman out of City Hall was a hard man to find; and a child\ncouldn't go to a man's mansion to \"talk him around.\" But, by grand luck\nin a month or so, Marian did find, and _win_, all but Simpkins.\n\nOn Council night, Simpkins took up a good,--or I should say, bad--half\nhour against Branton Hills \"buying any old dump or scrap land that\nis put up. What was this city coming to?\" and so on, and so on. And\nMarian's back yard wasn't bought. Now Youth is all right if you rub its\nfur in a way which suits it; but, man!! hold on to your hat, if you\ndon't!! And Marian's fur was all lumpy. _Boy! was that kid MAD!!_\n\nNow, just by luck, March thirty-first, coming along as days do, you\nknow, found Marian in front of a toy shop window, in which, way down\nfront, was a box of cigars, with a card saying: \"This Brand Will Start\nHis Blood Tingling.\" And Marian, as boys say, was \"on\" in an instant;\nand bought a cigar. Not a box, not a bunch, but just _a_ cigar. Coming\nout Marian saw His Honor and Simpkins passing; Simpkins saying:--\n\n\"All right. I'll drop around, tonight.\" And was Marian happy? Wait a\nbit.\n\nThat night as Gadsby and Simpkins sat talking in His Honor's parlor,\nwho would, \"just by luck,\" (??) walk in, but Marian; saying, oh, _so_\nshyly:--\n\n\"Just thought I'd drop in to chat with Nancy,\" and, on passing a couch,\nslyly laid that cigar on it. Now Simpkins, in addition to his famous\ngrouch, was a parsimonious old crab; who, though drawing good pay\nas Councilman, couldn't pass up anything that cost nothing; and, in\ngazing around, saw that cigar; and, with a big apologizing yawn, and\nslinking onto that couch as a cat slinks up on a bird, and, oh, _so_\nnonchalantly lighting a match, was soon puffing away and raving about\nBranton Hills politics. Out in a back parlor sat Marian and Nancy on a\nbig divan, hugging tightly up, arm in arm, and almost suffocating from\nholding back youthful anticipations, as Simpkins said:--\n\n\"... and that Hopkins back yard stunt! Ridiculous! Why, his kid was\nout, trying to find all of our Council to talk it into buying. Bah! And\n_did_ I block it? I'll say I did! You don't find kids today laughing at\nCouncilman Simpkins.\"\n\nAn actual _spasm_ of giggling in that back parlor had Gadsby looking\naround, inquiringly.\n\n\"No, sir!\" Simpkins said. \"No kid can fool Coun----\"\n\n_BANG!!_\n\nGadsby, jumping up saw only a frazzly cigar stump in Old Bill's mouth,\nas that palpitating individual was vigorously brushing off falling\nsparks as His Honor's rugs got a rain of tobacco scraps! Gadsby was\n\"on\" in an instant, noticing Marian and Nancy rolling and tumbling\naround on that big divan, and doubling up in a giggling fit, _way_ out\nof control. Finally Simpkins angrily got up, viciously jamming on his\ntall silk hat; and Marian, fighting that giggling fit, just _had_ to\ncall out:--\n\n\"_April Fool_, Councilman Simpkins!!\"\n\n(And Mayor Gadsby, on a following Council night, got Marian's land bill\nthrough; many a Councilman holding his hand in front of his grinning\nmouth, in voting for bright, vitalic Youth.)\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n\nWidow Adams was sitting up again, for it was way past midnight,\nand Virginia was out. Many months ago Virginia was also out, and\nwas brought back, unconscious. So now Nina was again sitting up,\nfor Virginia was not a night-owl sort of a girl. Finally, around\ntwo o'clock, Nina couldn't stand it, and had to call in a passing\npatrolman. Now this patrolman was an original Organization of Youth\nboy, and had always known Nina and Virginia; and said:--\n\n\"Oh, now! I wouldn't worry so. Possibly a bus had a blowout; or--\"\n\n\"But Virginia said nothing _about_ going on a bus! Oh!! _How_ could\nthat child vanish so?\"\n\nNaturally, all that that patrolman could do was to call his station;\nand Nina, almost all in, lay down, until, just about dawn a jangling\nringing brought this half wild woman to a front hall, shouting:--\n\n\"This is Nina Adams talking! Who? _What?_ Virginia, is that you? What's\nwrong? What! You and Harold Thompson? Our aviator? You did what? Took\nhis aircraft to _what_ city? Why, that's so far you can't----\" but\nVirginia had hung up. So Nina also hung up, and sat down with a big,\nlong sigh:--\n\n\"My Virginia, not _running_ away, but _flying_ away, to marry! Oh, this\nYouth of today!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAround six o'clock that night, Virginia and Harold stood arm in arm in\nNina's parlor, as a big bus was groaning noisily away.\n\n\"But, Mama,\" said Virginia, sobbing pitifully, \"I didn't think you\nwould----\"\n\n\"That's just it, Virginia, you _didn't_ think!! But you _should!_ How\ncould I know what was going on? That's just you young folks of today.\nYou think of nothing but your own silly, foolish doings, and you allow\nus old _good-for-nothings_ to go crazy with worry!!\" and Nina sank in a\ngasping swoon onto a sofa.\n\nBut old Doc Wilkins, arriving at Virginia's frantic call, knowing\nNina's iron constitution from childhood, soon had that limp form back\nto normal; and, with a dark, disapproving scowl at Virginia, said:--\n\n\"Bring in a good batch of hot food, and your Ma will turn out all\nright,\" and going out, with a snort of disgust, and banging viciously\nthat big front door!\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\nAwful tidings in our Branton Hills' \"Post,\" had so wrought up our\nordinarily happy, laughing Sarah, who, with Paul abroad, was back,\nliving again with old Tom Young, that Sarah, sitting on a low stool\nby old Tom's rocking chair was so still that Tom put down his \"Post,\"\nsaying:--\n\n\"Gift of gab all run out, kid?\"\n\nBut Sarah had an odd, thoughtful look. Sarah's bosom was rising and\nfalling abnormally; but, finally, looking quickly up at old Tom, Sarah\nsaid:--\n\n\"Daddy, I want to go to war.\"\n\n\"_Do what?_\" If Sarah had said anything about jumping out of a balloon,\nor of buying a gorilla to play with, Tom Young wouldn't know any such\nastounding doubt as brought his rocking chair to a quick standstill.\n\n\"_War?_ What kind of talk is this? A girl going to war? What for? How?\n_Say!!_ Who _put_ this crazy stunt into your brain, anyway?\"\n\nAs you know, Sarah was not only charming in ways, but also in build;\nand, with that glorious crown of brownish-gold hair, that always\nsmiling mouth and that soft, plump girlishly-girlish form, no man, Tom\nYoung nor anybody, could think of Sarah and war in a solitary thought.\nSo Sarah said, softly:--\n\n\"Last night, our Night School trio thought that our boys, so far away,\nmust miss us, and Branton Hills sights; and Doris said, 'Branton Hills\nsounds.' And so, why couldn't our trio join that big group of musicians\nwhich is sailing soon? And, Daddy, you know Paul is in that army. I\ndon't know that I could find him, but--but--but I want to try. And\nKathlyn is talking of going as biologist with a big hospital unit; so\npossibly I could stay with it.\"\n\nTom Young was _dumb!_ His \"Post\" actually _had_ told of such a musical\noutfit about to sail; but it was a man's organization. So, now it has\ngot around to _this!_ Our girls, our dainty, loving girls, brimful of\nboth sympathy and patriotism, wanting to go into that tough, laborious\nwork of singing in army camps; in huts; in hospitals; singing from\ntrucks rolling along country roads along which sat platoons and\nbattalions of troops, waiting for word which might bring to this or\nthat boy his last long gun-toting tramp. Singing in--\n\n\"Aw, darling! Your trio was fooling, wasn't it? Now, girls don't----\"\n\n\"Daddy, girls _do!_ So, if our folks don't put up too much of a--\"\n\n\"_Aha!!_ _Now_ you said a mouthful; _if_ your folks _don't!_ Darling,\nI'll say just two words as my part in this crazy stunt: '_Nothing\ndoing!!_' Kathlyn's work is mighty important; singing isn't.\"\n\nSarah had not grown up from infancy in kindly Tom's cabin without\nknowing that his \"no\" was a \"_no!!_\" and not a flimsy, hollow word\nwhich a whining, or a sniffling, or a bawling child could switch around\ninto: \"Oh, all right, if you want to.\" So Sarah still sat on that low\nstool; or, to turn it around almost backwards,--Sarah sat on that\nstool,--still. _So_ still that Tom's old tin clock on its wall hooks\nwas soon dominating that small room with its rhythmic ticking, as a\nconductor's baton controls a brass band's pianissimos. Finally Sarah\nsaid softly, slowly, sadly and with a big, big sigh:--\n\n\"I _did_ so want to go.\" And that small clock was ticking, ticking,\nticking ...\n\nFor a full hour Sarah and old Tom sat talking and rocking, until Sarah,\nphoning to Doris, said:--\n\n\"My Dad says no.\"\n\nAnd Doris, phoning back to Sarah, said:--\n\n\"So did my Dad.\"\n\nAnd, as Virginia Adams was that trio's third part; and as Sarah and\nDoris had always known Nina Adams' strong will; and as,--Oh, hum! It\nwas a happy fascination until adult minds got hold of it!\n\n\nXXIX\n\n\nGadsby was walking back from a visit down in Branton Hills'\nmanufacturing district on a Saturday night. A busy day's traffic had\nhad its noisy run; and with not many folks in sight, His Honor got\nalong without having to stop to grasp a hand, or talk; for a Mayor\nout of City Hall is a shining mark for any politician. And so, coming\nto Broadway, a booming bass drum and sounds of singing, told of a\nsmall Salvation Army unit carrying on amidst Broadway's night shopping\ncrowds. Gadsby, walking toward that group, saw a young girl, back\ntowards him, just finishing a long, soulful oration, saying:--\n\n\"... and I can say this to you, for I know what I am talking about; for\nI was brought up _in a pool of liquor!!_\"\n\nAs that army group was starting to march on, with this girl turning\ntowards Gadsby, His Honor had to gasp, astonishingly:--\n\n\"Why! Mary Antor!!\"\n\n\"Oh! If it isn't Mayor Gadsby! I don't run across you much, now-a-days.\nHow is Lady Gadsby holding up during this awful war?\"\n\nAll such family gossip passing quickly, Gadsby said:--\n\n\"But this Salvation Army work, Mary? How long----\"\n\nMary and His Honor had to walk along, as that big drum was now pounding\na block away. During that walk Gadsby found out all about that vast\nvoid in Mary's bungalow following that fatal auto crash; and all about\n\"two old maid aunts\" as Mary said, who had all that pantry's liquor\nthrown down a drain and got out, also, a day or two following; all\nabout living now at Old Lady Flanagan's.\n\n\"... for I just _couldn't_ stay in that bungalow, with nobody around,\nyou know.\" And all about loving companionship in that grand old lady's\narms; and of Mary's finding that Flanagan, who got such a \"wallop\" from\nAntor's killing, wasn't drinking so much, now; which put it into Mary's\nmind that many a man would, with kindly coaching, turn from it.\n\n\"And I think that my nightly talks against liquor, hit; and hit _hard_,\ntoo; for almost nightly a poor down-and-out will follow along with our\nband, promising to cut it out and go straight. _Oh, why_ didn't I try\nto stop Norman's drinking?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said Gadsby, \"you did, in your girlish way; but you know\nboys don't think that small girls know anything. I'd put up any amount\nthat Norman, in that far-away camp, is thinking of you, constantly.\"\n\n\"Oh-h-h-h! If I could only _know_ that!\" and a look of almost sanctity,\nand a big, long-drawn sigh told what a turmoil was going on in this\nyoung girl's mind. \"But I'm going on, and on and on with this night\ntalking until Norman is back again. Possibly a plan will turn up toward\nboth of us living down our past,----and our sorrow.\" And Gadsby, slowly\nplodding along towards his dimly lit mansion, thought of a slight\ntransposition of that scriptural quotation: \"And your sins, you adults,\nshall fall upon your offspring, unto your third and fourth--\"\n\n\"Oh, if a man would only think of his offspring having to carry on,\nlong past his last day! And of how hard it is for a boy or girl to\nstand up and proudly (?) claim that so-and-so 'was my Dad,' if all\nBranton Hills knows of that Dad's inglorious past. Poor kids!\" for\nyou know that Gadsby said, in this story's start, that \"a man should\nso carry on his daily affairs as to bring no word of admonition from\nanybody;\" for a man's doings should put a stain upon no soul but his\nown.\n\nBut, _aha!!_ As His Honor got to his parlor, his sad mind found a\nhappy, smiling Lady awaiting him; crying joyously:--\n\n\"Look! Look, John! Word from William! From Bill, in Paris!\"\n\nBill's first communication said:--\n\n\"Darling Folks: Julius and I just got into this town from a month of\nhard marching, ditch-digging and fighting. I am all right, and so is\nJulius. Ran across Frank, who is on duty at our Commissary. Lucky guy!\nLots of food always around! Paul is growing fat. Looks mighty good. Oh,\nhow all of us do miss you and good old Branton Hills! I can't find a\nsolitary suit in this town that I would put on to go to a dog fight!\n_Such fashion!_\" and so on; just a natural outpouring from a boy, away\non his first trip from his Dad's kindly roof.\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" said Gadsby, laughing jovially; \"That's our Bill, all right!\nAlways thinking of dolling up!\" and Lady Gadsby, rising quickly, said:--\n\n\"Oh, I must call up Nancy, Kathlyn and Sarah!\" and, in a trio of small\nbungalows, joy, _wild_ joy, found its way into girlish minds!\n\nAs Gadsby sat, going through this good word again and again, a mirthful\nchuckling had Lady Gadsby asking:--\n\n\"What's so funny about it?\"\n\n\"Nothing; only if I didn't know that Frank is such a grand, good\nlad, I'd think Bill was hiding a bit from us; for that 'on duty at\nCommissary' _might_ amount only to potato paring!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\n\nPriscilla Standish was waiting at our big railroad station, on a warm\nSpring day, for a train to pull out, so that cross-track traffic could\nstart again. It was just an ordinary train such as stop hourly at\nBranton Hills, but Priscilla saw that a group was hurrying toward a\ncombination-car, way up forward. Now Priscilla was not a girl who found\nmorbid curiosity in any such a public spot; but, still, an odd, uncanny\nsort of thrill,--almost a chill, in fact,--was urging, urging a slow\nwalk toward that car. Just why, Priscilla didn't know; but such things\ndo occur in a human mind. So Priscilla soon was standing on a trunk\ntruck, gazing down into that group which now was slowly moving back,\nforming room for taking out a young man in khaki uniform, on a hospital\ncot. With a gasp of horror, Priscilla was instantly down from that\ntruck, pushing through that group, and crying out, wildly:--\n\n\"_Arthur!_ Arthur Rankin! Oh! Oh! What is it, darling?\" and looking up\nat a hospital assistant, \"Is it bad?\"\n\n\"Don't know, right now, lady,\" said that snowy clad official.\n\"Unconscious. But our big hospital will do all it can for him.\"\n\nArthur Rankin! Arthur, with whom Priscilla had had many a childhood\nspat! Arthur who had shown that \"puppy stuff\" for Priscilla, that his\nold aunt was always so disapprovingly sniffing at! And now, unconscious\non a,----\n\nWith a murmuring of sympathy from that sorrowing public, now\ndissolving, as all crowds do, Priscilla had a quick, comforting\nthought: \"Kathlyn is working at that hospital!\"\n\nKathlyn had known Arthur as long as Priscilla had; and Kathlyn's famous\nability would----\n\nSo our panting and worrying girl was hurrying along through Broadway's\nturning and inquiring crowds to that big hospital which our\nOrganization of Youth had had built. And now Arthur was going, for not\nlong, possibly, but, still possibly for----\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was midnight in that big still building. Old Doctor Wilkins stood by\nArthur's cot; Priscilla, sobbing pitifully, was waiting in a corridor,\nwith Lady Standish giving what comfort a woman could. Lady Standish,\nwho took in dogs, cats, rabbits or any living thing that was hurt, sick\nor lost; Lady Standish, donor of four thousand dollars for our big\nZoo; Lady Standish, kindly savior of Clancy's and Dowd's \"Big Four,\"\nnow waiting, without ability to aid a _human_ animal. Finally, Doctor\nWilkins, coming out, said:--\n\n\"Kathlyn says no sign of blood contamination, but vitality low; _badly_\nlow; sinking, I think. Railroad trip almost too much for him. Looks\nbad.\"\n\nBut, at this instant, an assistant, calling Wilkins, said Arthur was\ncoming out of his coma; and was murmuring \"about a woman known as\nPriscilla. Do you know anybody by----?\"\n\nWith a racking sob, Priscilla shot through that door, Lady Standish\nquickly following. Arthur, picking up, a bit, from Priscilla's soft,\noh, _so_ soft and loving crooning and patting, took that fond hand\nand--sank back! Doctor Wilkins, looking knowingly at Priscilla, said:--\n\n\"If it is as I think, you two had had thoughts of--\"\n\nA vigorous nod from Priscilla, and an approving look from Lady\nStandish, and Doctor Wilkins said:--\n\n\"Hm-m-m! It should occur _right now!_ Or,----\"\n\nAs quick as a flash that snowy-clad assistant was phoning; and,\n_astonishingly_ soon, our good Pastor Brown stood by that cot; and,\nwith Arthur in a most surprising pick-up, holding Priscilla's hot,\nshaking hand, through that still hospital room was wafting Priscilla's\nsoft, low words:--\n\n\"... you for my lawful husband, until ...\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDoctor Wilkins, going out with Priscilla, now trying, oh, _so_ hard for\ncontrol; with grand, charming, loving Kathlyn, arm in arm, said:--\n\n\"That joy will pull him through. Boys, at war, so far away, will\nnaturally droop, both in body and mind, from lack of a particular\ngirl's snuggling and cuddling. So just wait until Kathlyn finds out\nall about his condition; and good food, with this happy culmination of\na childhood infatuation, will put him in first-class condition, if no\ncomplications show up.\"\n\nAh! What an important part of a city's institutions a hospital is!\nWhat a comfort to all, to know that, should injury or any ailing\ncondition of man, woman or child occur without warning, anybody can,\nsimply through phoning find quick transportation at his door; and, with\nangrily clanging gongs, or high-pitch whistlings obtaining a \"right of\nway\" through all traffic, that institution's doors will swing apart,\nassistants will quickly surround that cot, and an ability for doing\nanything that Man _can_ do is at hand. You know, almost daily, of\ncapitalists of philanthropic mold, donating vast sums to a town or\nan association; but, in your historian's mind, no donation can do so\nmuch good as that which builds, or maintains hospitalization for all.\nA library, a school, a boys' or girls' club, a vacation facility, a\n\"chair\" of this or that in an institution of instruction,--all do much\nto build up a community. Both doctoring as a study for a young man, and\nnursing for a girl form most important parts of Mankind's activity.\n\nAnd so, just four months from that awful, but also happy day, Arthur\nRankin sat in a hammock with Priscilla, on Lady Standish's porch, with\nfour small Rankins playing around; or was walking around that back yard\nfull of cats, dogs, rabbits, and so on, with no thought of soap box\norations in his mind.\n\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\n\nOn a grand autumn morning Branton Hills' \"Post\" boys ran shouting down\nBroadway, showing in half-foot wording: \"FIGHTING STOPS!! HISTORY'S\nMOST DISASTROUS WAR IS HISTORY NOW!!!\" and again, Branton Hills stood\nstock still. But only for an instant; for soon, it was, in all minds:--\n\n\"Thank God!! Oh, _ring_ your loud church clarions! _Blow_ your factory\nblasts! Shout! Cry! Sing! _Play_, you bands! Burst your drums! Crack\nyour cymbals!\"\n\nAh, what a sight on Broadway! Shop girls pouring out! Shop janitors\nboarding up big glass windows against a surging mob! And, (sh-h-h-h)\nmany a church having in its still sanctity a woman or girl at its altar\nrail.\n\nMonths, months, months! Branton Hills was again at its big railroad\nstation, its Municipal Band playing our grand National air, as a long\ntroop train, a solid mass of bunting, was snorting noisily in. And,\namidst that outpouring flood of Branton Hills boys, Lady Gadsby, Nancy,\nKathlyn and His Honor found Bill, Julius, Frank and John. Sarah was\njust \"going all apart\" in Paul's arms, with Virginia swooning in\nHarold's.\n\nOn old Lady Flanagan's porch sat Mary Antor; for, having had no word\nfrom Norman for months, this grand young Salvation Army lass was in\nsad, sad doubt. But soon, as that shouting mob was drifting away, and\nhappy family groups walking citywards, a khaki-clad lad, hurrying to\nold Lady Flanagan's cabin, and jumping that low, ivy-clad wall, had\nMary, sobbing and laughing, in his arms. No. It wasn't Norman.\n\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\n\nA crowd was standing around in City Park, for a baby was missing.\nPatrol cars roaring around Branton Hills; many a woman hunting around\nthrough sympathy; kidnapping rumors flying around. His Honor was out\nof town; but on landing at our railroad station, and finding patrol\ncars drawn up at City Park, saw, in that crowd's midst, a tiny girl, of\nabout six, with a bunch of big shouting patrol officers, asking:--\n\n\"Who took that baby?\"\n\n\"Did you do it?\"\n\n\"Which way did it go?\"\n\n\"How long ago did you miss it?\"\n\n\"Say, kiddo!! _Why don't you talk?_\"\n\nAn adult brain can stand a lot of such shouting, but a baby's is not in\nthat class; so, totally dumb, and shaking with fright, this tot stood,\nthumb in mouth, and two big brown baby orbs just starting to grow\nmoist, as His Honor, pushing in, said:\n\n\"Wait a bit!!\" and that bunch in uniform, knowing him, got up and\nGadsby sat down on a rock, saying:--\n\n\"You can't find out a _thing_ from a young child by such hard, gruff\nways. This tiny lady is almost in a slump. Now, just start this crowd\nmoving. I know a bit about Youth.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said a big, husky patrolman. \"If anybody living knows\nkids, it's you, sir.\"\n\nSo, as things got around to normal, His Honor, now sitting flat on City\nPark's smooth lawn, said, jovially:--\n\n\"Hulloa.\"\n\nA big gulping sob in a tiny bosom--didn't gulp; and a grin ran around a\nsmall mouth, as our young lady said:--\n\n\"_So_ many big cops! O-o-o! I got afraid!\"\n\n\"I know, darling; but no big cops will shout at you now. _I_ don't\nshout at tiny girls, do I?\"\n\n\"No, sir; but if folks do shout, I go all woozy.\"\n\n\"Woozy? Woozy? Ha, ha! I'll look that up in a big book. But what's all\nthis fuss about? Is it about a baby?\"\n\nA vigorous nodding of a bunch of brown curls.\n\n\"What? Fussing about a baby? A baby is too small to fuss about.\"\n\n\"O-o-o-o! It _isn't!!_\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I fuss about my dolly, an' it's not half so big as a baby.\"\n\n\"That's so. Girls do fuss about dolls. My girls did.\"\n\n\"How many dolls has your girls got?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha! Not any, now. My girls all got grown up and big.\"\n\nDuring this calm, happy talk, a patrolman, coming up, said:--\n\n\"Shall I stick around, Your Honor? Any kidnapping facts?\"\n\n\"I don't know, just now. Wait around about an hour, and drop in again.\"\n\nSo His Honor, Mayor of Branton Hills, and Childhood sat on that grassy\nlawn; a tiny tot making daisy chains, grass rings, and thrilling at\nGadsby's story of how a boy, known as Jack, had to climb a big, big\ntall stalk to kill an awfully ugly giant. Finally Gadsby said:--\n\n\"I thought you had a baby playing with you.\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Huh, it isn't playing now. Did it fly away?\"\n\n\"Oho! No! A baby can't fly!\"\n\n\"No. That's right. But how _could_ a baby go away from you without your\nknowing it?\"\n\n\"It didn't. I did know it.\"\n\nNow, many may think that His Honor would thrill at this information;\nbut Gadsby didn't. So, \"playing around\" for a bit, His Honor finally\nsaid:--\n\n\"I wish _I_ had a baby to play with, right now!\"\n\n\"You can.\"\n\n\"Can I? How?\"\n\nWith a tiny hand on baby lips, our small lady said:--\n\n\"Go look in that lilac arbor; but _go soft!_ I think it's snoozing.\"\n\nAnd Gadsby, going to that arbor, got a frightful shock; for it was\nLillian, Nancy's baby! Not having known of this \"kidnapping\" as his\nfamily couldn't find him by phoning, it _was_ a shock; for His Honor\nwas thinking of that young woman collapsing. So, upon that patrolman\ncoming back, as told, Gadsby said:--\n\n\"Go and call up your station, _quickly!_ Say that I want your Captain\nto notify my folks that Lillian is all right.\"\n\n\"Good gosh, Your Honor!! Is this tot your grandchild?\"\n\n\"Grandchild or no grandchild, _you dash to that box!!_\"\n\nAnd so, again, John Gadsby, Champion of Youth, had shown officialdom\nthat a child's brain and that of an adult vary as do a gigantic oak and\nits tiny acorn.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\n\nMost of Gadsby's old Organization of Youth was still in town, though,\nas you know, grown up. So, on a Spring day, all of its forty boys and\nas many girls got most mystifying cards, saying:--\n\n\"Kindly go to Lilac Hill on May sixth, at four o'clock. IMPORTANT!\nIMPORTANT! IMPORTANT!!\" That was all. Not a word to show its origin. No\nhandwriting. Just a small, plain card in ordinary printing.\n\nNot only that old Organization, but His Honor, Lady Gadsby, Old Tom\nYoung, Tom Donaldson, Nina Adams, Lady Standish and Old Lady Flanagan\ngot that odd card.\n\n\"Arrah! Phwat's this, anny way?\" sang out that good old lady. \"Is it\ncourt summons, a picnic, or a land auction? By gorry, it looks phony!\"\n\nOld Tom Young, in his rocking chair, said:\n\n\"A card to go to Lilac Hill. It says 'important.' Ah! This Youth of\ntoday! I'll put up a dollar that I can sniff a rat in this. But _my_\ngirl is all right, so I'll go.\"\n\nAnd so it was, all around town. Nobody could fathom it.\n\nLilac Hill was as charming a spot as any that our big City Park\ncould boast. Though known as a hill, it was but a slight knoll with\nsurroundings of lilac shrubs, which, in May would always show a riot\nof bloom; this knoll sloping down to a pond, with islands, boats and\naquatic plants. Lilac Hill had known many a picnic and similar outings;\nfor Branton Hills folks, living for six days amidst bricks and asphalt,\njust _had_ to go out on Sundays to this dainty knoll, living for an\nhour or so amongst its birds, blossoms and calm surroundings. City\ntraffic was far away, only a faint rumbling coming to this natural\nsanctuary; and many a mind, and many a worn body had found a balm in\nits charms.\n\nBut that mystifying card! From whom was it? What was it? _Why_ was\nit? \"Oh, hum! Why rack brains by digging into it?\" was Branton\nHills' popular thought. \"But,--go and find out!\" That, also, was our\nOrganization's thought as May sixth was approaching.\n\n\"My gracious!\" said Nancy. \"It sounds actually spooky!\"\n\nBut calm, practical Kathlyn said:--\n\n\"Spooks don't hop around in daylight.\"\n\nMay sixth had just that warm and balmy air that allows girls to put\non flimsy, dainty things, and youths to don sports outfits; and His\nHonor, as that mystifying day was not far off, said:--\n\n\"This, I think, is a trick by a kid or two, to show us old ducks that\nan 'incog' can hold out, right up to its actual consummation. I don't\nknow a thing about what's going on; but, by golly! I'll show up; and if\nany fun is afloat, I'll join in, full blast.\"\n\nBut!!---- As our Organization boys and girls, and Branton Hills folks\ngot to Lilac Hill, _not a thing was found_ giving any indication that\nanything out of ordinary was to occur! Just that calm, charming knoll,\nwith its lilacs, oaks, and happy vista out across Branton Hills' hill\ndistricts! What _is_ this, anyway? A hoax? But all sat down, talking in\na big group, until, at just four o'clock,--_look!_ A stir, out back of\nthat island boat landing! What? On that _pond_? This card said Lilac\n_Hill!_ But I said that a stir was occurring in back of that boat\nlanding, with its small shack for storing oars and such. If our big\ncrowd was laughing and talking up to now, it _quit!_ And quit mighty\nquickly, too! If you want to hold a crowd, just mystify it. Old Lady\nFlanagan was starting to shout about \"this phony stuff,\" but Old Man\nFlanagan said:--\n\n\"Shut up! You ain't part of this show!\"\n\nNancy was actually hopping up and down, but Kathlyn stood calmly\nwatching; for this studious girl, way up in an \"ology\" or two, knows\nthat, by slow, thoughtful watching, you can gain much, as against\nworking up a wild, panicky condition. Lady Gadsby said again and again:\n\"What _is_ going on?\" but Nina Adams said: \"You ought to know that\ntoday, anything can----\"\n\nBut _look again!!_ From in back of that boat landing, a big fairy float\nis coming! Slowly,--slowly--slowly; a cabin amidships, just _dripping_\nwith lilacs, as still and noncommittal as old Gibraltar. Slowly, on and\non it is coming; finally stopping right at that spot upon which our\ngroup is standing; forty boys, forty girls, and a big mob, all as still\nas a church. What _is_ it, anyway? Is anybody in it? Not a sign of it.\nBut wait! Aha! It _has_ an occupant, for, coming out of that lilac\nglory is----_Parson Brown!!_ Parson Brown? _What_ was Parson Brown in\nthat cabin for? Aha!! A lilac spray is moving; and, as our groups stand\nstock still, _look!_ Lucy Donaldson is coming out! Oh! _What_ a vision\nof girlish joy and glory!! And--and--and, ah! That lilac spray is\nmoving again! Hulloa! Bill Gadsby is coming out!!\n\nA Spring sun was slowly approaching its horizonward droop, shooting\nrays of gold down onto our gasping crowd, as Parson Brown said:--\n\n\"William Gadsby, do you...?\"\n\nWilliam, but shortly back from abroad, you know, standing with grand,\nmilitary rigidity, said:\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"And Lucy Donaldson, do you...?\"\n\nIt didn't last long. Just a word or two; a burst of music of a famous\nmarch by John Smith, Branton Hills' organist, in that cabin with a\nsmall piano; just a---- But that crowd couldn't wait for that! With a\nwhoop His Honor sprang into that pond, wading swiftly to board that\nfairy craft; and in an instant Nancy was following him, splashing\nfrantically along, and scrambling aboard to almost floor Bill with a\ngigantic hug as His Honor shook Bill's hand, with a loving arm about\nLucy. Old Lady Flanagan was shouting wildly:--\n\n\"Whoops! Whoops! By gorra! This young gang of today is a smart boonch!\"\nand His Honor said:--\n\n\"Ha, ha! I didn't know a thing about this! Bill's a smart chap!\" And\nOld Tom Donaldson, grabbing happy, laughing, blushing, palpitating Lucy\nas soon as that young lady was on dry land, said:--\n\n\"Say! You sly young chick! Why didn't you notify your old Dad?\"\n\n\"Why, Daddy! That would spoil all my fun!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\n\nGadsby, Clancy and Dowd \"just had\" to, according to unanimous opinion,\ngo out to Lady Standish's suburban plot of ground to visit \"Big Four;\"\nGadsby, owing to an inborn liking for all animals; Clancy and Dowd from\nfond association with this particular group. It was a glorious spot;\nhigh, rolling land, with a patch of cool, shady woods, and a grand\nvista across hill and plain, with shining ponds and rich farm lands.\nAnd did \"Big Four\" _know_ Clancy and Dowd? I'll say so! And soon,\nwith much happy whinnying and \"acting up,\" with two big roans poking\ninquiring snouts in Clancy's hands, and two big blacks snuggling Gadsby\nand Dowd, as happy a group of Man and animals as you could wish for,\nwas soon accompanying Lady Standish around that vast patch.\n\nAnything that such animals could want was at hand. A bright, sparkling\nbrook was gabbling and gurgling through a stony gully, or dropping,\nwith many brilliant rainbows, down a tiny fall.\n\n\"Sally,\" said Gadsby, \"you do a grand work in maintaining this spot.\nIf Mankind, as a body, would only think as you do, that an animal has\na brain, and knows good living conditions, you wouldn't find so many\npoor, scraggly old Dobbins plodding around our towns, dragging a cart\nfar too big; and with a man totally without sympathy on it.\"\n\nAnd Lady Standish said:--\n\n\"I just _can't_ think of anybody abusing an animal; nor of allowing it\nto stay around, sick, hurt or hungry. I think that an animal is but a\npoint short of human; and, having a skin varying but slightly from our\nown, will know as much pain from a whipping as would a human child. A\nblow upon _any_ animal, if I am within sight, is almost as a blow upon\nmy own body. You would think that, with that vast gap which Mankind is\ncontinually placing back of him in his onward march in improving this\nbig world, Man would think, a bit, of his pals of hoof, horn and claw.\nBut I am glad to say that, in this country, laws in many a community\nadmit that an animal has rights. Oh, how an animal that is hurt looks\nup at you, John! An animal's actions can inform you if it is in pain.\nIt don't hop and jump around as usual. No. You find a sad, crouching,\ncringing, small bunch of fur or hair, whining, and plainly asking you\nto aid it. It isn't hard to find out what is wrong, John; any man\nor woman who would pass by such a sight, just isn't worth knowing.\nI just can't withstand it! Why, I think that not only animals, but\nplants can know pain. I carry a drink to many a poor, thirsty growing\nthing; or, if it is torn up I put it kindly back, and fix its soil up\nas comfortably as I can. _Anything_ that is living, John, is worthy of\nMan's aid.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\n\nPoor old Bill Simpkins! Nothing in this world was worth anything;\nnobody was right; all wrong, all wrong! Simpkins had no kin; and, not\nmarrying, was \"just plodding along,\" living in a small room, with no\nfun, no constant company, no social goal to which to look forward; and\nhad, thus, grown into what boys call \"a big, old grouch.\" But it wasn't\nall Simpkins' fault. A human mind was built for contact with similar\nminds. It should,--in fact,--it _must_ think about what is going on\naround it; for, if it is shut up in a thick, dark, bony box of a skull,\nit will always stay in that condition known as \"status quo;\" and grow\nup, antagonistic to all surroundings. But Simpkins didn't _want_ to\ngrowl and grunt. It was practically as annoying to him as to folks\naround him. But, as soon as that shut-up, solitary mind found anybody\nwanting it to do anything in confirmation of public opinion,--no! that\nmind would contract, as a snail in its spiral armor--and balk.\n\nLady Gadsby and His Honor, in talking about this, had thought of\nimproving such a condition; but Simpkins was not a man to whom you\ncould broach such a thought. It would only bring forth an outburst\nof sarcasm about \"trying it on your own brain, first.\" So Branton\nHills' Council always had so to word a \"motion\" as to, in a way, blind\nSimpkins as to its import. Many such a motion had a hard fight showing\nhim its valuation as a municipal law; such as our big Hall of Natural\nHistory, our Zoo, and so on.\n\nNow nothing can so light up such a mind as a good laugh. Start a man\nlaughing, good, long and loud, and his mind's grimy windows will slowly\ninch upward; snappy, invigorating air will rush in, and--lo! that old\nsnarling, ugly grouch will vanish as hoar-frost in a warm Spring thaw!\n\nAnd so it got around, on a bright Spring day, to Old Bill sitting on\nGadsby's front porch; outwardly calm, and smoking a good cigar (which\ndidn't blow up!), but, inwardly just full of snarls and growls about\nBranton Hills' Youth.\n\n\"Silly half-grown young animals, found out that two plus two is four,\nand thinking that _all_ things will fit, just that way!\"\n\nNow that small girl, \"of about six,\" who had had Nancy's baby out in\nCity Park, was passing Gadsby's mansion, and saw Old Bill. A kid of\nsix has, as you probably know, no formally laid-out plan for its daily\nactivity; anything bobbing up will attract. So, with this childish\ninstability of thought, this tiny miss ran up onto Gadsby's porch and\nstood in front of Old Bill, looking up at him, but saying not a word.\n\n\"Huh!\" Bill just _had_ to snort. \"Looking at anything?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"_What!!_ Oh, that is, you think 'not much,' probably. What do you\nwant, anyway?\"\n\n\"I want to play.\"\n\n\"All right; run along and play.\"\n\n\"No; I want to play with _you_.\"\n\n\"_Pooh!!_ That's silly. I'm an old man. An old man can't play.\"\n\n\"Can, too. My Grandpa can.\"\n\n\"But I'm not your Grandpa, thank my lucky stars. Run along now; I'm\nthinking.\"\n\n\"So am I.\"\n\n\"You? Huh! A kid can't think.\"\n\n\"Ooo-o! _I_ can!\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"About playing with you.\"\n\nNow Simpkins saw that this was a condition which wouldn't pass with\nscowling or growling, but didn't know what to do about it. Play with a\nkid? _What?_ Councilman Simpkins pl----\n\nBut into that shut-up mind, through a partially,--_only_\npartially,--rising window, was wafting a back thought of May Day in\nCity Park; and that happy, singing, marching ring of tots around that\nribbon-wound mast. Councilman Simpkins was in that ring.\n\nSo this thought got to tramping round and round many a musty corridor\nin his mind; throwing up a window, \"busting in\" a door, and shoving a\nlot of dust and rubbish down a back stairway. Round and round it ran,\nuntil, (!!) Old Bill, slowly and surprisingly softly, said:--\n\n\"What do you want to play?\"\n\nOh! Oh! what a victory for that tot!! What a victory for _Youth!!_ And\nwhat a _fall_ for grouchy, snarling Maturity!! I think that Simpkins,\nright at that instant, _saw_ that bright sunlight coming in through\nthat rising window; rising by baby hands; and from that \"bust in\" door.\nI think that Old Bill cast off, in that instant, that hard, gloomy\ncoating of dissatisfaction which was gripping his shut-up mind. And I\nthink,--in fact, I _know_,--that Old Bill Simpkins was now,--that is,\nwas--was--was, oh, just plain _happy!_\n\n\"What do you want to play?\"\n\n\"This is a lady, a-going to town.\"\n\n\"Play _what_?\"\n\n\"My!! Don't you know how to play that? All right; I'll show you. Now\njust stick out your foot. That's it. Now I'll sit on it, so. Now you\nbump it up and down. Ha, ha! Ho, ho! That's it! This is a lady, a-going\nto town, a-going to town, a-going to town!\" and as that tiny lady sang\nthat baby song gaily and happily, Old Bill was actually laughing; and\nlaughing _uproariously_, too!\n\nAs this sight was occurring, His Honor and Lady Gadsby, looking out\nfrom a parlor window, Gadsby said, happily:--\n\n\"A lady physician is working on Old Bill,\" causing Lady Gadsby to add:--\n\n\"And a mighty good doctor, too.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\n\nIt was night again. That small Salvation Army group was parading and\nsinging. A young girl would soon start a long oration against drink.\nNow boys, gawking as boys always do, saw a shadowy form of a man\nslinking along from doorway to doorway, plainly watching this marching\ngroup, but also, plainly trying to stay out of sight. A halt, a song\nor two, and Mary Antor was soon walking towards Old Lady Flanagan's\ncabin. But!! In passing big, dark City Park, a man, rushing wildly\nup, wrapping that frail form in a cast-iron grip, planting kiss upon\nkiss upon Mary's lips, finally unwound that grip and stood stiffly in\nmilitary saluting position. Mary, naturally in a bad fright, took a\nshort, anxious, inquiring look, and instantly, all that part of City\nPark actually _rang_ with a wild girlish cry:--\n\n\"_Norman!!!_\"\n\n\"Hulloa, kiddo! Just got in, half an hour ago, on a small troop train;\nand, by luck, saw you marching in that group. _Wow!!_ But you do look\n_grand!_\"\n\n\"And you look grand, too, Norman; but--but--but--not drunk?\"\n\n\"No, sis! Not for many a day now. Saw too much of it in camp. Big,\ngrand, corking good chaps down and out from it. Days and days in jail,\nmilitary jail, you know, and finally finding a 'bad conduct' stamp on\nCompany books. No, sir; I'm off it, _for good!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn old Lady Flanagan's porch Mary sat way past midnight with, no,\nnot with Norman, only, but with _two_ khaki-clad boys; and it was\nmiraculous that that small, loving childish bosom could hold so much\njoy! Old Lady Flanagan in nightgown and cap, looking down a front\nstairway, (and Old Man Flanagan, also in nightgown and cap, and also\nlooking down), said:--\n\n\"Arrah!! Go _wan_ oop stairs, you snoopin' varmit!\"\n\n\"_Who's_ a snoopin' varmint? Not _you_, of----\"\n\n\"Go wan oop, I say! By golly! That darlin' girl has found a mountain of\ngold wid Norman an'----\"\n\n\"Who's that wid Norman? That guy's around, nights, now, as--\"\n\n\"Say, you!! Do you go oop? Or do I swat you?\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII\n\n\nBill Gadsby, going abroad, naturally wasn't on that ballot for\nCouncilman Antor's chair; but this history shows that that mouthy\nantagonist who had had so much to say about \"pink satin ribbons\" and\n\"vanilla sprays,\" didn't win. No. A first class man got that position;\nold Tom Young, Sarah's Dad, as good an old soul as any in all Branton\nHills. And was Sarah happy! Oh, my! And was Sarah proud! Two \"oh, mys!\"\nTiny Nancy, loyal as always to Bill, said:--\n\n\"Bill was as good as in, for nobody, knowing my Bill would ballot\nagainst him; and Bill would hold that honor now, but for 'Old Glory's'\ncalling.\"\n\nThat's right, Nancy darling, you stick up for Bill; for, though\nBill didn't know it until many months, a citation \"for outstanding\nand valorous conduct in action\" was soon to go through our National\nPrinting Plant! For a \"city fop\" or an \"outdoor part of a tailor shop\"\nis not always a boob, you know.\n\nGadsby's mansion was again brightly aglow that night, that \"World War\nflag\" not hanging in his window now. And so, on Labor Day night, Lady\nGadsby and His Honor, sitting in his parlor, thought that a light\nfootfall was sounding out on his porch. As Gadsby got up to find\nout about it, Julius, coming in with a young girl, stood looking,\ngrinningly, at Lady Gadsby; who, jumping up, said, happily:--\n\n\"Why! Mary Antor!!\"\n\n\"No, Ma,\" said Julius. \"This is not Mary Antor.\"\n\n\"Not Mary Antor? Why, Julius, I think I know M----\"\n\n\"Not Mary Antor, Ma, but Mary Gadsby!\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh! My _darling_ girl!!\" and half crying and half laughing, Mary\nwas snuggling in Lady Gadsby's arms; and His Honor, coming in, saying:--\n\n\"By golly! That young cuss, Cupid, is mighty busy around this town!\nWhy, I can hardly walk two blocks along Broadway, without a young girl,\nwho has 'grown up in a night,' stopping, and saying: 'Mayor Gadsby,\nthis is my husband.' But I'll say that Cupid's markmanship has always\nbrought about happy matings. And, Mary, you darling kid, your sad, dark\nshadows will gradually pass; and Lady Gadsby and I will try to bring\nyou loads and loads of comfort. But, say, you, Julius! I didn't know\nthat you and Mary----\"\n\n\"Ho, ho\" said Mary, laughing. \"Didn't you know that Julius and Norman\nand I sat out nights on old Lady Flanagan's porch?\"\n\n\"Why, no; how should I? I don't go snooping around anybody's porch.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, Dad,\" said Julius; \"no snooping would find _that_ out. Mary\nand I had had this plan so long ago that I didn't know a World War was\ncoming!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\n\nAs a small boy, your historian was told that \"A king was in his\ncounting room, a-counting out his cash,\" or similar words, which told,\npractically, of his taking account of stock. So, also, Gadsby was on\nhis thinking-porch, a-thinking of his past. (A mighty good thing to do,\ntoo; if anybody should ask you!)\n\n\"If,\" said His Honor, \"you can't find any fun during childhood, you\nnaturally won't look for it as you grow up to maturity. You will grow\n'hard,' and look upon fun as foolish. Also, if you don't furnish fun\nfor a child, don't look for it to grow up bright, happy and loving. So,\nalways put in a child's path an opportunity to watch, talk about, and\nknow, as many good things as you can.\"\n\nLady Gadsby, from a parlor window, said:\n\n\"Practicing for a stumping tour, or a political pow-wow?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha! No. Just thinking out loud.\"\n\nSo, as thinking cannot hurt anybody, His Honor was soon going on:--\n\n\"Affairs which look small or absurd to a full-grown man may loom up as\nbig as a mountain to a child; and you shouldn't allow a fact that you\nsaw a thing 'so much that I am sick of it,' to turn you away from an\ninquiring child. _You_ wasn't sick of it, on that far-past day on which\nyou first saw it. I always look back, happily and proudly, to taking\na small girl to our City Florist's big glass building; to a group at\nour Night Court; a group finding out about dispatching our mail; and\nour circus! Boy! That _was_ fun! Our awarding diplomas at City Hall;\ntiny Marian at our airport's inauguration; our Manual Training School\ngraduation. _All_ that did a big lot toward showing Youth that this\nbig world is 'not half bad,' if adults will but watch, aid, and coach.\nAnd I _will not_ stand anybody's snapping at a child! Particularly a\ntiny tot. If you think that you _must_ snap, snap at a child so big as\nto snap back. I don't sanction 'talking back' to adults, but, ha, ha!\nI _did_ find a grand, big _wallop_ in Marian's April Fool cigar! Woo!\n_Did_ Old Bill jump!! But that did no harm, and a sad young mind found\na way to 'match things up' with an antagonist. Now, just stand a child\nup against your body. How tall is it? Possibly only up to your hip.\nStill, a man,--or an animal _thinking_ that it is a man--will slap,\nwhip, or viciously _yank_ an arm of so frail, so soft a tiny body!\n_That_ is what _I_ call a _coward!!_ By golly! almost a _criminal!_ If\na tot is what you call naughty, (and no child voluntarily is,) why not\nlift that young body up onto your lap, and talk--_don't shout_--about\nwhat it just did? Shouting gains nothing with a tot. Man can shout at\nMan, at dogs, and at farm animals; but a man who shouts at a child is,\nat that instant, _sinking in his own muck of bullyism_; and bullyism\nis a sin, if anything in this world is. Ah! _Youth!_ You glorious\ndawn of Mankind! You bright, happy, glowing morning Sun; not at full\nbrilliancy of noon, I know, but unavoidably on your way! _Youth!_ How\nI do thrill at taking your warm, soft hand; walking with you; talking\nwith you; but, most important of all, _laughing_ with you! _That_ is\nMan's pathway to glory. A man who drops blossoms in passing, will carry\njoy to folks along his way; a man who drops crumbs will also do a\nkindly act; but a man who drops kind words to a sobbing child will find\nhis joy continuing for many a day; for blossoms will dry up; crumbs\nmay blow away; but a kind word to a child may start a blossom growing\nin that young mind, which will so far surpass what an _un_kindly man\nmight drop, as an orchid will surpass a wisp of grass. Just stop a bit\nand look back at your footprints along your past pathway. Did you put\nmany humps in that soil which a small child might trip on? Did you\nangrily slam a door, which might so jolt a high-strung tot as to bring\non nights and nights of insomnia? Did you so constantly snarl at it\nthat it don't want you around? In fact, did you put _anything_ in that\nback-path of yours which could bring sorrow to a child? Or start its\ndistrust of you, as its rightful _guardian_? If so, _go back_ right\nnow, man, and _fix_ up such spots by kindly acts from now on. Or, _jump\ninto a pond, and don't crawl out again!!_ For nobody wants you around!\"\n\nLady Gadsby, as this oration was wafting off amongst lilac shrubs, and\nacross soft, warm lawns, had sat, also thinking; finally coming out\nonto that ivy-bound porch, and sitting down by His Honor, saying:--\n\n\"That was just grand, John, but I was thinking along a path varying a\nbit from that. You know that Man's brain is _actually_ all of him. All\nparts of his body, as you follow down from his brain, act simply as\naids to it. His nostrils bring him air; his mouth is for masticating\nhis food; his hands and limbs furnish ability for manipulation and\nlocomotion; and his lungs, stomach and all inward organs function\n_only_ for that brain. If you look at a crowd you say that you saw\nlots of folks: but if you look at a man bathing in a pond; and if that\nman sank until only that part from his brow upward was in sight, you\nmight say that you saw nobody; only a man's scalp. But you actually\nsaw a _man_, for a man is only as big as that part still in sight. Now\na child's skull, naturally, is not so big as a man's; so its brain has\nno room for all that vast mass of thoughts which adult brains contain.\nIt is, so to say, in a small room. But, as days and months go by, that\nroom will push its walls outward, and that young brain gradually fill\nup all that additional room. So, looking for calm, cool thinking in a\nchild is as silly as looking for big, juicy plums amongst frail spring\nblossoms. Why, oh, _why_ don't folks think of that? _You_ know what\nfoolish sounding things Julius was always asking, as a child. 'How can\njust rubbing a match light it?' 'Why is it dark at night?' 'Why can't\na baby talk?' But, you and I, John, didn't laugh at him. No, not for\nan instant. And _now_ look at our Julius and our Kathlyn; both famous,\njust through all that asking; and our aid. John, God _could_ put Man\ninto this world, full-grown. But God don't do so; for God knows that,\nwithout a tiny hand to hold, a tiny foot to pat, tiny lips to kiss, and\na tiny, warm, wriggling body to hug, Man would know nothing but work.\"\n\nGadsby sat smoking for a bit, finally saying:--\n\n\"Darling, that pair of robins up in that big oak with four young, and\nyou and I in this big building, also with four, know all about what\nyou just said; and, and,--hmmm! It's almost midnight.\" And His Honor's\nmansion was soon dark; bathing in soft moonlight.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX\n\n\nPractically all Branton Hills was talking about Councilman Simpkins;\nfor Councilman Simpkins just didn't look natural; and Councilman\nSimpkins didn't _act_ natural. In fact, Councilman Simpkins was\ncrawling out of his old cocoon; and, though an ugly, snarling _dowdy_\nworm had lain for so long, shut up in that tight mass of wrappings\naround his brain, _now_ a gay, smiling moth was coming out; for\nCouncilman Simpkins was \"dolling up!\"\n\nIf Bill Gadsby was known as a \"tailor-shop's outdoor part,\" Old Bill\nwas not _a_ part. No, Old Bill _was_ that tailor shop--outdoor, indoor,\nor without a door. In fact, Councilman Simpkins now had \"_it_,\" such as\nour films talk about so much today.\n\nBut Simpkins' outfit was not flashy or \"loud.\" Suits of good cloth,\nhats of stylish form, always a bright carnation \"just south of his\nchin,\" boots always glossy, and a smart, springy walk, had all Broadway\ngasping as this Apollo-vision swung jauntily along. Nancy, happy,\ngiggling Nancy, was \"all of a grin\" about this magic transformation;\nand, with that old, inborn instinct of womanhood, told Lucy:--\n\n\"You just watch, and mark my word. A woman is in this pudding! Old Bill\njust couldn't boom out in such a way without having a goal in sight;\nand I'll put up a dollar on it.\"\n\nAnd Lucy, also a woman, said smilingly:--\n\n\"And I'll put up a dollar and a half!\"\n\nBut His Honor and Lady Gadsby, at such talk would look skyward, cough,\nand say:--\n\n\"Possibly a woman; and a mighty young woman, at that.\"\n\nNow, if anything will \"warm up\" a public, it is gossip; particularly\nif it is about mystifying actions of a public man; and this had soon\ngrown to a point at which a particularly curious man or woman thought\nof going to Old Bill and boldly asking: \"Who is it?\" But, as I said,\nwhat Councilman Simpkins would say to such \"butting in\" was known to\nall Branton Hills. No. Councilman Simpkins could doll up and trot\naround all that that portly Solon might wish; but, so to say, a sign\nwas always hanging from his coat front, saying:--\n\n\"HANDS OFF!!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNina Adams and Virginia sat on Gadsby's porch with Nancy and Kathlyn;\nand Old Bill was up as a topic. Virginia, constantly smiling and\ninwardly chuckling, hadn't much to say about our frisky Councilman;\nand Nancy and Kathlyn couldn't fathom why. But Nina, not so backward,\nsaid:\n\n\"Pffft! If a man wants to throw old clothing away and buy stylish\noutfits, what affair is it, but his own? It isn't right so to pick out\na man, and turn him into a laughing stock of a city. Old Bill isn't a\nbad sort; possibly born grouchy; but if a grouchy man or woman, (and I\nknow a _bunch_ of that class in this town!) _can_ pull out of it, and\nlaugh, and find a bit of joy in living, _I_ think it is an occasion for\ncongratulations, _not_ booing.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Kathlyn, \"I don't think anybody is booing Councilman\nSimpkins. But you know that any showing of such an innovation is apt to\nstart gossip. Just why, I don't know. It, though, is a trait of Mankind\nonly. Animals don't 'bloom' out so abruptly. You can hunt through\nBiology, Zoology or any similar study, and find but slow,--awfully\nslow,--adaptations toward any form of variation. Hurrying was not known\nuntil Man got around.\"\n\n\"My!\" said Nancy, gasping, and not giggling now, \"I wish that _I_ could\nknow all that you know, Kathy. As our slang puts it, 'I don't know\nnothin'.'\"\n\n\"But, you could,\" said Kathlyn, \"if you would only study. All through\nour young days, you know, with you and Bill out at a card or dancing\nparty, you in flimsy frills, and Bill swishing around in sartorial\nglory, _I_ was upstairs, studying. And so was Julius.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Nina. \"I wish Virginia would study.\"\n\n\"Oh, I _am!_\" said Virginia, all aglow.\n\n\"You? Studying _what_?\"\n\n\"Aviation! Harold is going to show--\"\n\n\"Now, Virginia, Harold is _not!_\" and Nina Adams' foot was _down!_\n\"It's not so bad for a man to fly, but a girl--\"\n\n\"But, Mama, lots of girls fly, nowadays.\"\n\n\"I know that, _and_ I also know _a_ girl who _won't!_ and, just as Lucy\nhas always known that Old Tom Young's 'no' _was_ a no, just so had Nina\nAdams brought up Virginia.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Kathlyn, \"this sky-shooting talk isn't finding out anything\nabout Councilman Simpkins;\" and Virginia said:--\n\n\"Possibly Old Bill wants to 'fly high.' I think I'll ask Harold about\ntaking him up for a jaunt.\"\n\nThis, bringing a happy laugh all around, Nina said:--\n\n\"Now don't jolly poor Bill too much. I don't know what, or who, got\nhim to 'going social.'\" And Nancy, giggling, said:--\n\n\"I put up a dollar, with Lucy's dollar-fifty that it's a woman.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, now,\" said Nina. \"A man isn't always trotting around\non a woman's apron strings,\" and, as it was growing dark, Nina and\nVirginia got up to go.\n\nPassing down Gadsby's front walk, a soft night wind brought back to\nthat porch:--\n\n\"Now, Virginia, _quit_ this! You will stay _on solid ground!_\"\n\n\"Aw, Ma! Harold says----\"\n\nBut a big bus, roaring by, cut it short.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust a month from this, His Honor, sitting on his porch with his\n\"Morning Post\" ran across a short bit, just two rows of print, which\nhad him calling \"Hi!\" which Lady Gadsby took as a signal for a quick\ntrip to that porch.\n\n\"All right, Your Honor! On duty! What's up?\"\n\nGadsby, folding his \"Post\" into a narrow column, and handing it to that\nwaiting lady, said nothing. As that good woman saw that paragraph,\nGadsby saw first a gasp, following that, a grin, and finally:--\n\n\"_Why!_ Of all things! So _that's_ Nina--\"\n\nThat row of print said, simply:--\n\n\"By Pastor Brown, on Saturday night, in Pastor's study, Nina Adams and\nCouncilman Simpkins.\"\n\n\"Why!\" said Lady Gadsby, laughing, \"Nina sat on this porch only last\nmonth, talking about Old Bill, but saying nothing about this! I'm going\nright around to hug that darling woman; for _that_ is what I call\n_tact_.\"\n\nSo, as Nina and our Lady sat talking, Nina said:\n\n\"You know that Bill and I, growing up from kids in school, always got\nalong grandly; no childhood spats; but, still it was no 'crush' such\nas Youth falls into. As Bill got out of high school, I still had two\nrooms to go through. You also know that I wasn't a 'Miss' for long\nfrom graduation day. But Irving Adams was lost in that awful 'Titanic'\ncalamity, and I brought up my baby in my widowhood. Bill was always\nsympathizing and patronizing, though all Branton Hills thought him a\ncast-iron grouch. But a public man is not always stiff and hard in his\noff hours; and Bill and I, slowly but gradually finding many a happy\nhour could--\n\n\"All right, you grand, luscious thing!!\" and Lady Gadsby and Nina sat\nlaughing on a couch, as in old, old school days. \"And,\" said Nina,\nhappily; \"poor Bill's upstairs, now, putting his things around to suit\nhim. Living for so long in a small lodging all his things staid in a\ntrunk. A lodging-room always has various folks around, you know, and a\nman don't lay his things out as in his _own_ room. So--\"\n\n\"Nina,\" said Lady Gadsby; \"do you know what brought him out of his old\nshut-in way of looking at things?\"\n\n\"From just a word or two Bill drops, occasionally, I think that a child\nis--\"\n\nAnd Lady Gadsby, said; \"You know our Good Book's saying about: 'And a\ntiny child shall----'\"\n\n\n\n\nXL\n\n\nSix months from that day upon which old Mars, God of War, had angrily\nthrown down his cannons, tanks, gas-bombs and so on, fuming at Man's\ninability to \"stand up to it,\" Gadsby's mansion was dark again. Not\ntotally dark; just his parlor lamp, and a light or two in halls and\non stairways. And so this history found Nancy and Kathlyn out on that\nmoon-lit porch; Nancy sobbing, fighting it off, and sobbing again.\nTall, studious, loving Kathlyn, sitting fondly by Nancy's tiny form,\nsaid;--\n\n\"Now, sis; I wouldn't cry so much, for I don't think that conditions,\njust now, call for it.\"\n\n\"B-b-b-but I'd stop if I could, wouldn't I?\" and poor Nancy was sobbing\nagain. \"Now, _wait!_\" and Kathlyn, uncommonly cross, vigorously shook\nNancy's arm. \"You can't gain a _thing_ this way. Mama is probably all\nright. Oh, is that you, Daddy?\"\n\nHis Honor sat down by his two girls. Gadsby was not looking good. Black\nrings around his always laughing orbs; a hard cast to that jovial\nmouth; a gray hair or two, cropping up amongst his wavy brown. But\nGadsby was not old. Oh, no; far from it. Still, that stoop in walking;\nthat odd, limp slump in sitting; that toning down in joviality, had,\nfor six months past, had all Branton Hills sympathizing with its\npopular Mayor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDays; days; days! And, oh! that _tough_ part,--nights, nights, nights!\nNights of two young chaps, in full clothing, only just napping on a\nparlor couch. Nights of two girls nodding in chairs in a dimly,--oh,\n_so_ dimly a lit room.\n\nIt got around almost to Christmas, only a fortnight to that happy day;\nbut,--happy in Gadsby's mansion? Finally Frank took a hand:--\n\n\"Now, kid, _do_ try to stop this crying! You know I'm not scolding you,\ndarling, but, you _just can't_ go on this way; and _that's that!_\"\n\n\"I'm trying _so_ hard, hubby!\"\n\nNow Nancy was of that good, sturdy old Colonial stock of His Honor\nand Lady Gadsby; and so, as Christmas was approaching, and many a\nbunch of holly hung in Broadway's big windows, and as many a Salvation\nArmy Santa Claus stood at its curbs, Nancy's constitution won out;\nbut a badly worn young lady was in and out of Gadsby's mansion daily;\nbringing baby Lillian to kiss Grandma, and riding back with Frank at\nabout six o'clock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOld Doctor Wilkins, coming in on a cool, sharp night, found His Honor,\nNancy, Kathlyn, Bill, Julius, Lucy, Mary, Frank and John all in that\nbig parlor.\n\n\"Now, you bunch, it's up to you. Lady Gadsby will pull through all\nright,\" (Nancy rushing wildly to kiss him!) \"it hangs now upon good\nnursing; and I know you will furnish that. And I will say without\na wisp of a doubt, that a calm, happy room; not too many around;\nand--and--hmmm!! Julius, can't you hunt around in our woods that you\nand Kathlyn know so thoroughly, and find a tall, straight young fir;\ncut it down, rig it up with lights and a lot of shiny stuff; stand it\nup in your Ma's room, and----\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    'Tis a night, almost Christmas,\n    And all through that room\n    A warm joy is stirring;\n    No sign of a gloom.\n    And \"Ma,\" sitting up,\n    In gay gown, and cap,\n    No, no! Will _not_ start\n    On a long wintry nap!\n    For, out on that lawn\n    A group of girls stand;\n    A group singing carols\n    With part of our Band.\n    And that moon, in full vigor,\n    Was lustrous; and lo!\n    _Our Lady is singing!_\n    Aha, _now_ I know\n    That Nancy and Kathlyn\n    And Julius and Bill\n    And also His Honor,\n    Will sing with a will!\n    And Old Doctor Wilkins\n    Amidst it all stands;\n    Smiling and nodding,\n    And rubbing his hands;\n    And, sliding out, slyly;\n    Calls back at that sight:--\n    \"Happy Christmas to all;\n    And to all a Good Night!\"\n\nAlong about midnight a happy group sat around Gadsby's parlor lamp, as\nDr. Wilkins was saying;--\n\n\"Stopping a war; that is, stopping actual military combat, is not\nstopping a war in _all_ its factors. During continuous hard strain a\nhuman mind can hold up; and it is truly amazing how much it can stand.\nDay by day, with that war-strain of worry pulling it down, it staunchly\nholds aloof, as a mighty oak in facing a storm. But it has a limit!!\nWith too much and too long strain, it will _snap_; just as that mighty\noak will fall, in a long fight. Lady Gadsby will avoid such a snap\nthough it is by a narrow margin.\"\n\nAs this group sat in that holly-hung parlor, with that big cloth sign\nin big gold capitals; HAPPY CHRISTMAS, across its back wall; with horns\ntooting outdoors; with many a window around town aglow with tiny,\ndancing tallow-dip lights; with baby Lillian \"all snuggling--so warm in\na cot; as vision of sugar plums\"--(and why _shouldn't_ a baby think of\nsugar plums on that night, almost Christmas?); as, I say, this happy\ngroup sat around Gadsby's lamp, Mars, that grim old war tyrant, was\nfar, far away. Upstairs, calmly snoozing on a big downy pillow, Lady\nGadsby was now rapidly coming back again to that buxom, happy-go-lucky\nFirst Lady of Branton Hills.\n\n\n\n\nXLI\n\n\nChristmas, gay and happy in Gadsby's mansion, was soon far, far back.\nA robin or two was hopping about on His Honor's lawn, looking for a\nsquirming lunch; Lady was taking short walks with Nancy; Kathlyn having\nto go back to work in our big hospital. Lilac, syringa, narcissus,\ntulips, hyacinths burst out in a riot of bloom; and a bright warm Sun\nbrought joy to all. And so this history found His Honor on his porch\nwith his \"Post\" as a young lad, coming up, said;--\"Good morning, sir.\nI'm soliciting funds for a big stadium for Branton Hills, which will\nfurnish an opportunity for football, polo,----\"\n\n\"Whoa!\" said Gadsby, putting down his \"Post\" and looking critically at\nhis young visitor. \"You look a bit familiar, boy. Oho! If it isn't kid\nBanks; oh, pardon!--_Allan_ Banks; son of Councilman Banks! You young\nfolks grow up so fast I don't know half of you. Now what about this\nsoliciting. Who is back of you?\"\n\n\"Branton Hills' Organization of Youth; Part Two, sir.\"\n\n\"Branton Hills Org----Ha, ha! Upon my word! Who is starting this\ngroup?\"\n\nMary, coming out from His Honor's parlor, said:--\n\n\"Oh, I forgot to notify you of this. Norman has got about fifty kids\nfrom Grammar School boys and girls, anxious to follow in _your_\nOrganization's foot-prints.\"\n\nWas Gadsby happy? Did Gadsby thrill? Did that long-past, happy day\nfloat in glowing colors through his mind? It did. And now that old,\nhard-working bunch of kids, grown up, now, and with kids of its own;\nthat loyal bunch of young sprouts was taking root; was born again!\n\nOh, _how_ Youth crawls up on you! How a tiny girl \"almost instantly\"\nshoots up into a tall, charming young woman! _How_ a top-spinning,\nball-tossing, racing, shouting boy looms up into a manly young chap in\nMilitary School uniform! Gadsby _was_ happy; for, wasn't this a tonic\nfor his spinal column? So His Honor said;--\n\n\"Allan, I think Branton Hills will officially aid this stadium plan.\nI'll put it up to Council.\"\n\nBut, Allan Banks, _not_ Kid Banks now, was just so old as to know a\nthing or two about Council bills; and, out as a solicitor, naturally\nsought a good showing on donations won, so said;--\n\n\"A Council donation will fit in grand, sir; but how about grouchy old\nBill Simpk----\"\n\n\"Trot along, Allan.\"\n\n\"But how about this stadium? I'm doubting Old B--\"\n\n\"Trot along, Allan.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat Mary had said was a fact. Norman Antor had not only fought a\nmilitary war; Norman Antor had also fought an _inward_ war. A war,\nwhich fought him with gallon jugs, small phials, spoons, mixing\napparatus, and--a stumbling, mumbling _stupor!_ Norman had fought with\nabout two million lads in that military war; but now, with no aid but a\nstrain of good blood, starting way back of his carousing Dad (but, as\nsuch traits may, skipping a notch or two, and implanting in this young\nlad just a grain of its old nobility of mind), was fighting again; and,\njust as any solitary young chap amongst that two million loyally did\nhis part, just so was this tiny grain now doing _its_ part; fighting\nvaliantly in his brain. It was giving him torturing thoughts in army\nnight-camps, of a darling, loving young girl, a part of his own family,\ngrowing up \"in a pool of liquor;\" thoughts in night-camps of Branton\nHills' patrol-wagon trips to jail; and _Darn_ that thought of Virginia!\nVirginia _drunk_ by his own hand! Ugh!! _Why not chop that stinking\nhand off?_ And, on coming back to Branton Hills, watching that darling\nMary in Salvation Army uniform, tramping, talking, praying for just\nsuch low-down \"liquor hounds\" as----.\n\nOh! It was an awful fight! A long, brain-racking onslaught against a\nvillain shut in by walls of iron! But though Norman Antor's night-camp\nfights with Norman Antor had \"put a big kick\" in his wish to \"lay off\nthat stuff,\" just a final blow, just an awful brain-crashing _blast_\nwas still missing, so that that big right hand might point skyward,\nto clinch that vow. And that blast was waiting for Norman! To anybody\nstanding around, it wasn't much of a blast; but it _was!_ It was a\nmighty concussion of T.N.T., coming as Mary, young, loving, praying\nMary, said, as his arms unwound from around that frail form:--\n\n\"Why, Norman! _Not drunk?_\"\n\n_God!!_ What flashing, shooting, sizzling sparks shot through his\nbrain!! Up, out, in; all kinds of ways!! _What_ crashing bombs!!\n\nAnd, that first calm night on Old Lady Flanagan's porch; that moonlit\nnight of bliss, with soft, cuddling, snuggling, laughing, crying\ndarling Mary!\n\n\"I say,\" Norman was shouting, inwardly; \"that night of bliss _was_ a\nnight of bliss and _don't anybody try to say that it wasn't!_\"\n\nFor it was a night on which a young man's Soul was _back_; back in its\nown Mind, now full of God's incomparably grand _purity!_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLady Gadsby was visiting Nina, sitting in that big front parlor;\nVirginia sitting calmly rocking; (and, hmmm! That was about all\nVirginia _ought_ to do, just now!) A young High School girl, coming in,\nsaid;--\n\n\"Good morning! I'm soliciting for funds for a stadium for----\"\n\n\"_Marian!_\" sang out Virginia, \"_What's_ all this? _You_, soliciting?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Marian, brightly. \"Norman Antor's Organization of\nYouth; Part Two, is soli--\"\n\n\"Norman Antor's _what_?\" and Virginia was all agog in an instant, as\nMarian Hopkins told all about it; and, with childish flippancy, forgot\nall about soliciting, saying:--\n\n\"I was told that Harold is giving flying instructions. Don't _you_ want\nto fly? My! _I_ do!\"\n\n\"I _did_,\" said Virginia, softly; \"but,--not now;\" and Marian was a\nbit too young to know why Lady Gadsby was smiling at Nina!\n\nAs Nancy found out about this, on Lady Gadsby's coming back to lunch,\nthat \"old Branton Hills matron,\" as Gadsby found a lot of fun calling\n\"his baby girl,\" now-a-days, said, giggling:--\n\n\"No! Virginia! You'll _stay on solid ground!_\"\n\n\n\n\nXLII\n\n\nLady Gadsby and His Honor sat in Branton Hills' First Church, on a\nhot July Sunday. Out-doors, twitting birds, lacy clouds, and gay\nblossoms, told of happy hours in this long, bright month. Pastor Brown,\nannouncing a hymn, said:--\n\n\"This is a charming hymn. Our choir always sings it without company;\nbut today, I want _all_ you good folks to join in. Just pour forth your\njoy and sing it, good and strongly.\"\n\nThat hymn had six stanzas; and Gadsby, noting an actually _grand_ bass\nsinging just back of him, thought of turning around, from curiosity;\nand as that fifth stanza was starting, said to Lady Gadsby:--\n\n\"Do you know who that is, singing that grand bass part?\"\n\nLady Gadsby didn't; but Lady Gadsby was a woman; and, from Noah's Ark\nto Branton Hills' First Church, woman, as a branch of Mankind, was\ncurious. So a slow casual turning brought a dig in His Honor's ribs:--\n\n\"It's Norman Antor!\"\n\nPastor Brown, standing at that big church door as folks, filing out\nwould stop for a word or two, said to Gadsby:--\n\n\"Young Antor is invariably in church, now-a-days. I may add to my\nchoir, and am thinking of putting him in it. I'm so glad to find out\nabout that boy winning his fight. I always _thought_ Norman would turn\nout all right.\"\n\nPastor Brown was right; and two Branton Hills girls, a Salvation Army\nlady, and a tiny tot of six had won crowns of Glory, from throwing rays\nof light into two badly stagnant Minds.\n\n\n\n\nXLIII\n\n\nThirty-six months. That's not so long a run in daily affairs, and this\nBranton Hills history finds Thanksgiving Day dawning. In Branton Hill's\nlocality it is not, customarily, what you would call a cold day. Many a\nThanksgiving has had warm, balmy air, and without snow; though, also,\nwithout all that vast army of tiny chirping, singing, buzzing things\non lawn or branch. But contrast has its own valuation; for, through\nit, common sights, vanishing annually, show up with a happy joy, upon\ncoming back. Ah! That first faint coloring of grass, in Spring! That\nbaby bud, on shrub or plant, shyly asking our loving South Wind if\nit's all right to pop out, now. That sprouting of big brown limbs on\noak and birch; that first \"blush of Spring\" in orchards; that first\nfurry, fuzzy, cuddly spray of pussy willows! Spring and Fall; two big\npoints in your trip along your Pathway. Fall with its rubbish from\nmonths of labor: cornstalks, brown, dry grass, old twigs lying around,\nwilting plants; bright colorings blazing in distant woodlands; chill\nwinds crawling in through windows, at night. And Spring! Pick-up,\npaint-up, wash-up Spring!! So, as I said, Branton Hills got around to\nThanksgiving Day; that day on which as many of a family as possibly can\nshould sit around a common board; coming from afar, or from only a door\nor two away.\n\nGadsby's dining-room was not big; it had always sat but six in his\nfamily. But, on _this_ Thanksgiving Day,--hmmm! \"Wait, now--uh-huh,\nthat's it. Just run that pair of sliding doors back, put that parlor\nlamp upstairs; and that piano? Why not roll it out into my front hall?\nI know it will look odd, but you can't go through a Thanksgiving 'soup\nto nuts' standing up. _Got_ to jam in chairs, any old way!\"\n\nBut who is all this mob that will turn His Honor's dining-room into a\nthirty-foot hall? I'll look around, as our happy, laughing, singing,\nclapping group sits down to Gadsby's Thanksgiving party.\n\nI find _two_ \"posts of honor;\" (My gracious! _so_ far apart!); His\nHonor, with carving tools filling dish, dish, and dish.\n\n\"Atta boy! Atta girl! Pass up your chow-dish! This bird has but two\ndrum-sticks, but six of his cousins wait, out in our cook-shop! Lots of\ngrub! What's that, Julius? A bit of dark? Want any gravy?\"\n\nAt Post Two sits \"Ma;\" again in that good old buxom condition, so\nfamiliar to all Branton Hills:--\n\n\"Right this way, folks, for potato, squash, onions, carrots and\nturnip!!\"\n\n_What_ a happy bunch! Following around from Gadsby, sit Bill, Lucy and\nAddison. But whoa! Who's this Addison? Oh, pardon; I forgot all about\nit. Lucy's baby; and his first Thanksgiving. Hi, you! Tut-tut! Mustn't\ngrab raisins! Naughty, naughty! On Lucy's right sit Mary, Julius\nand Norman; following along, I find Nancy, Frank and Baby Lillian,\nKathlyn, John, Lady Standish, Priscilla and Hubby Arthur Rankin; Nina\nAdams,--Oh! A _thousand_ pardons!!--Nina _Simpkins!_ and Old Bill. Say!\nYou wouldn't know Bill! Bright, happy, laughing, singing, and tapping\na cup with his spoon; spick-span suit, and that now famous \"Broadway\ncarnation.\" Hulloa, Bill; you old sport!! Glad to find you looking so\nhappy! _What?_ _Two_ whacks at that bird? Why Bill!! On Bill's right\nsits Pastor Brown, old Doctor Wilkins, Harold, Virginia, and Patricia.\nOh, pardon again! Patricia, Virgina's baby; just six months old, today,\nand valiantly trying to swallow a half-pound candy cow! Following\naround I find Old Tom Young, Sarah, and Paul. No, I don't find a\nhigh-chair by Sarah; but Sarah sits just rocking, rocking, rocking,\nnow-a-days. Following on, again, is Old Tom Donaldson, Clancy Dowd,\n_and_--Old Lady Flanagan, with \"this dom thing I calls hoosband!\" And\nlastly, Marian and old Pat Ryan from our railway station's trunk room.\n\nSo it was just laugh, talk, \"stuff,\" and--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOh, hum! Folks can't stay all night, you know; so, finally, groups and\npairs, drifting out, all had happy words for His Honor and Lady Gadsby;\nand His Honor, a word or two; for you know Gadsby _can_ talk? So it\nwas:--\n\n\"Good night, Nina; good luck, Old Bill! Oh! say, Bill; will _that_\ncigar blow up? Good night, Virginia; and ta-ta Patricia; and Virginia,\nyou mind your Ma and stay down on solid ground! Aha, Clancy! You old\nmotor-pump fan! No; that's wrong; _animal-drawn_ pump! Good night,\nPastor Brown; so glad you put Norman in your choir. And now Old Tom\nand Sarah! Tom, you look as young as on that day on which you brought\nSarah, just a tiny, squalling, fist-waving bunch, to this porch to ask\nabout adoption! And I know Sarah has always had a kind, loving Dad.\nPaul, you young sprout! As _you_ turn into a daddy, soon now, you'll\nfind that, on marrying, a man and woman start actually living. It's\nmiraculous, Paul, that's just what it is.\"\n\nAnd so it was; pairs and groups shaking hands and laughing, until\nfinally a big buxom woman sang out:--\n\n\"_Whoops!!_ It was a _wow_ of a grub-lay-out! It _was_ thot! But this\ndom thing I calls hoosband. Say! You grub-stuffin' varmint! Phwat's\nthat in your hat? A droom-stick, is it? Do you want His Honor to think\nI don't cook nuthin' for you? Goodnight, all! I'm thot full I'm almost\na-bustin'!\"\n\nAs Lady Standish shook hands, that worthy woman said:--\n\n\"John, what you did for Branton Hills should go into our National\nLibrary at Washington, in plain sight.\"\n\n\"Sally, _Youth's_ part was paramount in all that work. All I did was to\nboss;\" and Old Doc Wilkins, coming out, nibbling a bunch of raisins,\nsaid:--\n\n\"Uh-huh; but a boss must know his job!\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Gadsby; \"but it was _young hands and young\nminds_ that did my work! Don't disqualify Youth for it will fool you,\nif you do!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA glorious full moon sails across a sky without a cloud. A crisp night\nair has folks turning up coat collars and kids hopping up and down for\nwarmth. And that giant star, Sirius, winking slyly, knows that soon,\nnow, that light up in His Honor's room window will go out. Fttt! It\n_is_ out! So, as Sirius and Luna hold an all-night vigil, I'll say a\nsoft \"Good-night\" to all our happy bunch, and to John Gadsby--Youth's\nChampion.\n\n\n\n\nFINIS\n\nNote: Not a word containing the letter \"E\" has appeared in this story\nof over 50,000 words.\n\n\n\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's note:\n\nDid any \"e\"s survive the publishing process?

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":79,"split":"train"}
