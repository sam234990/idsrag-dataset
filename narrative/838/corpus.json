At the beginning of the novel she has just been released from an unwanted marriage by the death of her betrothed, the Rev. Haly, also a clergyman, whom Eliza nursed during his final days in her own home. After this experience, she decides she wants friendship and independence. After a short period of time living with friends, she is courted by two men. One, Boyer, is a respected but rather boring clergyman, whom all of her friends and her mother recommend she accept in marriage. The other, Sanford, is an aristocratic libertine, who has no intention to marry but determines not to let another man have Eliza. Because of her indecision and her apparent preference for the libertine Sanford, Boyer eventually gives up on her, deciding that she will not make a suitable wife. Sanford also disappears from her life and marries another woman, Nancy, for her fortune. Eliza eventually decides that she really loved Boyer and wants him back. Unfortunately for Eliza, Boyer has already decided to marry Maria Selby, a relation of Boyer's friend. Sanford later reappears married, but is able to seduce the depressed Eliza. They have a hidden affair for some time until, overcome by guilt and unwilling to face her family and friends, Eliza arranges to escape from her home. Like the real-life Elizabeth Whitman, she dies due to childbirth complications and is buried by strangers. Mrs. Wharton (Eliza's mother) and all of Eliza's friends are deeply saddened by her death. Sanford, too, is devastated by her death. In a letter to his friend, Charles Deighton, he expresses his regret at his wretched behavior.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Coquette, by Hannah Webster Foster\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

So he who attempts to lift the veil that\nseparates the REAL from the IDEAL, or to remove the heavy curtain that\nfor a century may have concealed from view the actual personages of a\nwell-drawn popular fiction, or what may have been received as such,\nshould bring to his task a tender heart and a delicate and gentle hand.\n\nThus, in preparing an introductory chapter for these pages which are to\nfollow, many and various thoughts suggest themselves, and it is\nnecessary to recognize and pursue them with gentleness and caution.\n\nThe romance of \"Eliza Wharton\" appeared in print not many years\nsubsequent to the assumed transactions it so faithfully attempts to\nrecord. Written as it was by one highly educated for the times,--the\npopular wife of a popular clergyman, connected in no distant degree, by\nmarriage, with the family of the heroine, and one who by the very\nprofession and position of her husband was, as by necessity, brought\ninto the sphere of actual intercourse with the principal characters of\nthe novel, and as the book also took precedence in time of all American\nromances, when, too, the literature of the day was any thing but\n\"_light_\"--it is not surprising that it thus took precedence in interest\nas well of all American novels, at least throughout New England, and was\nfound, in every cottage within its borders, beside the family Bible, and\nthough pitifully, yet almost as carefully treasured.\n\nSince that time it has run through a score of editions, at long\nintervals out of print, and again revived at the public call with an\neagerness of distribution which few modern romances have enjoyed. Its\nauthor, Hannah Foster, was the daughter of Grant Webster, a well-known\nmerchant of Boston, and wife of Rev. John Foster, of Brighton,\nMassachusetts, whose pedigree, but few removes backward in the line of\nher husband,[A] interlinked, as has been already hinted, with that of\nthe \"Coquette.\" Thus did they hold towards each other that very\nsignificant relationship--especially in the past century--of \"_cousins_\"\na relationship better heeded and more earnestly recognized and\ncherished than that of nearer kin at the present day. Therefore, not\nonly by family ties, but by similarity of positions and community of\ninterests, was she brought into immediate acquaintance with the\ncircumstances herein combined, and especially qualified to write the\nhistory with power and effect. Nor is this the only work which bears the\nimpress of her gifted pen. There is still another extant, of which I\nneed not at this time and place make mention, besides many valuable\nliterary contributions to the scattered periodicals of that day. It is\nto be regretted here that a short time previous to her death she\ndestroyed the whole of her manuscripts, which might, in many respects,\nhave been particularly valuable.\n\nShe has, however, transmitted her genius and her powers, which find\nexpression and appreciation in two daughters still living in Montreal,\nCanada East, one of whom is the gifted author of \"Peep at the Pilgrims,\"\n\"Sketches from the Life of Christ,\" and \"Confessions of an early\nMartyr,\" all of which have been very popular; the first having been\nrepublished here within a short period, and also in England with still\ngreater success. The other daughter, the widow of the late Dr. Cushing\nwho, while firm at his post as physician at the Emigrant Hospital, fell\na victim to that terrible malady, ship fever, in 1846, is also author of\nmany minor works, and co-editor of the \"Snowdrop,\" a monthly publication\nof much merit in Montreal. Mrs. Foster died in that place, at the\nresidence of her daughter, Mrs. Cushing, April 17, 1840, at the advanced\nage of eighty-one years.\n\nIt may seem, however, at a period so long subsequent to the actual\ntranspiration of events herein recorded, that little could be said to\nthrow light or interest upon the history, and even less upon the\ncharacter, or in extenuation of the follies or the frailties of the\nunfortunate subject of the following pages, and upon which public\nopinion had long ago rendered its verdict and sealed it for a higher\ntribunal. Yet I am happy in assuring any who may pause over these\nprefatory leaves that this is not the fact; and it harms us not to\nbelieve that over every life, however full of error it may be, there is\nan unwritten chapter which the angels take into account as they bear\nupward the tearful record, and which He, the great Scribe, \"who ever\nsitteth at the right hand of the Father,\" and from whose solemn\nutterance on earth dropped the forever cherished words which have so\noften given life and hope to the penitent fallen,--\"_neither do I\ncondemn thee_,\"--interpolates on the mighty leger of eternity for the\ngreat reckoning day.\n\n\"Eliza Wharton,\" generally known, perhaps, as Elizabeth Whitman, was the\neldest of four children--Elizabeth, Mary, Abigail, and William; the\nlatter of whom was a physician, twice married, and who also left a son\nof his own name, (William Elnathan,) who died in Philadelphia in 1846,\nunmarried. Her father, the Rev. Elnathan Whitman, was the son of Rev.\nSamuel Whitman, who was the third son of Rev. Zechariah Whitman, the\nyoungest child of John, the original ancestor of the Whitman family. He\n(Rev. Samuel W.) graduated at Harvard University in 1696, and was for\nseveral years a tutor there. Thus having passed through the usual,\nthough then somewhat limited, course of theology, he was ordained as\nminister of the gospel in Farmington, Connecticut, in 1706, at that time\none of the largest towns in the state. He inherited by bequest one half\nof his father's lands in Stow, Massachusetts, and was thereby also made\nexecutor of his will. He married, March 19, 1707, Mary Stoddard,\ndaughter of Rev. Solomon Stoddard, second minister of Northampton,\nMassachusetts. Mr. Stoddard was born in Boston in 1643, and died in\nNorthampton in 1729. This Solomon Stoddard was the great-grandfather of\nHon. Solomon Stoddard, now residing in Northampton.\n\nIt is worthy of remark here that the early ancestors of \"Eliza Wharton\"\nintermarried also with the Edwards family; so that Hon. Pierpont\nEdwards, who figures in this volume as \"Major Sanford,\" could be no less\nthan second cousin to his unfortunate victim.\n\nRev. Elnathan Whitman, the father of Elizabeth, was born January 12,\n1708-9, and graduated from Yale College, New Haven, where he was for\nseveral subsequent years a tutor. He at length settled as minister over\nthe Second Church in Hartford, Connecticut, and there married Abigail\nStanley, daughter of Colonel Nathaniel Stanley, treasurer of the colony\nof Connecticut, a woman of uncommon energy of character and of superior\nmental acquirements, (a correct portrait of whom accompanies these\npages, taken from an original painting.) He died in Hartford also, March\n2, 1776, aged sixty-eight years, after having served in the ministry in\nthat place forty-three of the same. His tombstone bears the following\ninscription:--\n\n  IN MEMORY OF\n\n  THE REV. ELNATHAN WHITMAN,\n\n  Pastor of the Second Church of Christ in Hartford, and one of the\n  fellows of the corporation of Yale College, who departed this life\n  the 2d day of March, A.D. 1776, in the 69th year of his age and 44th\n  of his ministry.\n\n  Endowed with superior natural abilities and good literary acquirements,\n  he was still more distinguished for his unaffected piety, primitive\n  simplicity of manners, and true Christian benevolence. He\n  closed a life spent in the service of his Creator, in humble confidence\n  of eternal happiness through the merits of the Savior.\n\n  \"Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.\"\n\nHis wife survived him nineteen-years, and died November 19, 1795, aged\nseventy-six. It was during the dark, early period of her widowhood that\nthe sad events occurred which have furnished the historian and the\nnovelist with themes of the deepest pathos, and to which prominence is\ngiven in the following pages. But,\n\n\n  \"Woes cluster. Rare are solitary woes;\n  They love a train--they tread each other's heels.\"\n\nSo said the sublimest of poets, and so has all experience proved. Thus,\nin her case, this affliction did not come alone; but at a period nearly\nconnected with this, in the dreary, solitary hours of the night,--_her\nnight_ of sorrow too,--her house was discovered on fire, which, for lack\nof modern appliances, was totally destroyed, with all its contents,\nconsisting not only of many curious and valuable articles of furniture\nboth for use and ornament, but embracing, also, an uncommon library,\noverflowing with rare books, pamphlets, &c., which her late husband had\ncollected with great effort and research.\n\nElizabeth, the eldest of her family, was born in 1752. She was a child\nof early promise, and remarkable in maturer years for her genius (I use\nthe term in no merely conventional sense, as will hereafter appear) and\naccomplishments, as well as for her genial spirit and tender and\nendearing qualities. Her maternal ancestor, Thomas Stanley, was an\noriginal owner and settler in Hartford, Connecticut, and removed to, and\ndied in, Hadley, Massachusetts, January 30, 1662-3.\n\nThus nobly descended and connected, so singularly unfortunate, and her\nfate so afflicting and disastrous, it is no wonder that the novelist\npointed her pen to record, with historical accuracy, a destiny so\nfearful, a career so terrible. By her exceeding personal beauty and\naccomplishments, added to the wealth of her mind, she attracted to her\nsphere the grave and the gay, the learned and the witty, the worshippers\nof the beautiful, with those who reverently bend before all inner\ngraces.\n\nProminent among these was the Rev. Joseph Howe, then pastor at the New\nSouth Church, on Church Green, in this city, a young man of rare talents\nand eminent piety. Unfortunately, the fear and excitement consequent on\nthe hostile relation of the colonies at that time towards the mother\ncountry forced him from his position here; and he left, with the family\nwhose house had been his home, for a more quiet, temporary retreat in\nNorwich, Connecticut. Soon after this he repaired to the residence of\nRev. Mr. Whitman, in Hartford, for a short visit, high in the\nanticipation of soon becoming the happy husband of the gifted daughter\nElizabeth. But Providence, in wisdom, had ordered it otherwise; and,\nwhile on this visit, he suddenly sickened and died.\n\nHowever much or little of soul or of sorrow she had in this event we are\nnot to know; but another stood ready to-worship in his place, what we\nwill endeavor to believe was in some degree worthy of homage. This was\n\"J. Boyer,\" known as the Rev. Joseph Buckminster, a graduate of Yale\nCollege, and at that time tutor in the same institution, who afterwards\nsettled as minister over the religions society in Portsmouth, New\nHampshire, and whose Biography was but a few years ago published.\n\nWe have no reason to believe, however, that either of these persons was\nher earliest choice, especially the latter, or that, in this case most\ncertainly, there could have been at all that sacred congeniality of\nspirit so deeply necessary to woman's nature, bearing out from her bosom\nthat deathless affection which nor pride, nor affluence, nor folly, nor\nlove of conquest, with the victory every where certain, could in any\nwise overcome.\n\nThe feeling that existed on her part was of circumstances only,\ninfluenced by strong parental predilection, and the desire which so\noften obtains in the heart of a true woman--that of soothing the love\nshe cannot return, resolving itself at length into pity.\n\nWe might here also dwell upon the idiosyncrasies of genius as applicable\nto her case, which are generally banned, of whatever character they may\nbe, and evermore shut out all sympathy, till, in despair or despite,\nfolly is made crime. But since sin must ever be arraigned for itself,\nand error is prone to plead for mercy, I leave no word here that can be\nmisconstrued or misapplied. Certain it is that Elizabeth Whitman was\nmarked as one of strangely fluctuating moods, as the truly gifted ever\nare, and of a wild, incomprehensible nature, little understood by those\nwho should have known her best, and with whom she was most intimate.\nOver this, in tracing her history, it were well to pause, were it not\nthat thus we might give countenance to this prominent fact of modern\ndays, that the eccentricities of genius are often substituted for genius\nitself, or are made its prime characteristics, as the gold of the\njeweller is recommended for its beauty and strength in proportion to its\nalloy.\n\nHowever much we may regret the waywardness of such a heart in the\npresent instance, in that it rejected one so nobly qualified as was Mr.\nBuckminster to appreciate its genius and its love, while sympathizing\nwith his own mortifying disappointment, (for this we must admit,) that\nshe had in the secrets of her nature a preference for another, we cannot\naltogether know its results. So cautiously and discreetly did he,\nthrough a long and beautiful life, qualify both his lips and his pen,\nthat little or nothing remains beyond these letters of the\nnovelist--which we may not doubt are authentic, as they were long in the\npossession of Mrs. Henry Hill, of Boston, the \"Mrs. Sumner\" of the\nnovel--to tell how the heart was instructed, and how blighted hope and\nblasted affection were made the lobes through which the spirit caught\nits sublimest and holiest respiration. We know\n\n  \"Through lacerations takes the spirit wing,\n  And in the heart's long death throe grasps true life.\"\n\nOne little remark which has been suffered to creep into his Memoirs is,\nhowever, of peculiar significance. I quote it here.\n\nIn speaking of Connecticut to a friend, he says, \"My place was there; I\nalways wished that state to be my home; but Providence has directed my\nline of duty far away _from the place of my first affections_.\"\n\nHe also--as one who had every means of knowing the fact has informed\nme--was deeply affected on reading the \"romance\" here following, and at\nthe time remarked that, had the author been personally acquainted (not\nknowing that she was) with the circumstances of his engagement with\nElizabeth Whitman, she could not have described them with more graphic\ntruth.\n\nThe Hon. Pierrepont Edwards, to whom was given the preference and\nprecedence above referred to, and who is made to assume in the chapters\nof the novel the name of \"Sanford,\" was the son of Rev. Jonathan\nEdwards, president of Princeton College, New Jersey. His maternal\ngrandmother was Esther, the second daughter of the Rev. Solomon\nStoddard, and sister to the paternal grandmother of Elizabeth Whitman,\nthe wife of Rev. Samuel Whitman before mentioned. A Mr. Burt has by some\nbeen identified with this \"Sanford,\" the rival of \"Boyer,\" yet without\nthe least pretension in history to authenticity. Nor can we place much\nreliance upon the letters here introduced as his in point of\noriginality, as there is sufficient reason for believing that these are,\nfor the most part, of the author's invention, founded upon the current\nreputation of his after years. And we may be happy in so considering\nthem, since they would betray a character, even in earliest manhood, too\ndepraved and debased for honorable mention, although his errors were no\ndoubt altogether beyond the palliation of a woman's pen. Yet we would\nfain look at him, in youth at least, as undebauched and uncorrupt,\nhowever stained may be the record of his manhood.\n\nBetween him and Elizabeth Whitman there was, notwithstanding, over all\nand under all, a close affinity of spirit; and there is no question,\naside from the frailties and objections which the writer of the romance\nhas introduced, that there was a marriage of the soul, superseding all\nafter ties which worldliness and depravity might have consummated, that\novershadows sin, and may not pass into our reckoning. Not only such a\nmarriage, but one, though secret, actually sanctioned by the laws of the\nland, she is known to have declared a fact previous to her death.\n\nQuestion this who may, that deep down under the impulses of surging\npassion there existed a purer and holier affection for her, is in\nhistory sufficiently clear. They had been set in family connection,\nintimate by kin, intimate in earliest life by every outward tie, and\nespecially intimate by the subtile affinities of their spiritual\nnatures. Yet he who can, under any circumstances, entreat the love of\nwoman, and then take advantage of her weakness or her confidence, is an\nanomaly in nature, and should have a special, judiciary here and in\nheaven.\n\nSince so much of the romance here following is truth, veritable truth,\nit is to be regretted that any error of historical character was\nsuffered to assume importance in the narrative. Yet this is so often the\ncase in works of this kind, that it is not remarkable here. More\nsurprising is it that truth was so carefully and conscientiously guarded\nand preserved.\n\nIn conflicting statements, it is difficult to determine the precise year\nof the marriage of Mr. Edwards, whether before or after the death of\n\"Eliza Wharton,\" although it may have been long before, even as one of\nhis biographers has it, and that recklessness and extravagance may have\nlifted him to a too fearful height from the calm Eden of love and\nhonor, till he at length compromised the influence of both to baser\navarice.\n\nThat he married Frances Ogden, of Elizabeth-town, New Jersey, for his\nfirst wife, is the fact, and the date given is 1769. Yet the ciphers may\nbe questioned, I think, as it would make him but nineteen years of age\nat the time of the event, besides other considerations which make it\nappear more doubtful still.\n\nHe was, however, as has been already stated, the eleventh and youngest\nchild of Rev. Jonathan Edwards, and was born in Northampton,\nMassachusetts, _Sabbath_. His biographer has been particularly faithful\nin thus recording it, as if the hallowed influences of the Sabbath upon\nbirth have a bearing on subsequent life, and were in his case either\nstrikingly marked or missed. He was born, then, Sabbath, April 8, 1750,\nand was cousin, in good or evil, to the notorious Aaron Burr. He was\nalso brother to Rev. Jonathan Edwards, president of Union College.\n\nHis mother, Sarah Pierrepont, was of aristocratic origin, and the\ndaughter of Rev. James Pierrepont, and granddaughter of John Pierrepont,\nof Roxbury, from whom descended Rev. John Pierpont, the celebrated poet\nand divine of our own time. The Pierrepont family was a branch of the\nfamily of the Duke of Kingston, (Pierrepont being the family name;) and\nthe mother of Mr. Edwards was thus cousin-german to Mary Pierrepont,\n(Lady Mary Wortley Montague.)\n\nThrough his whole ancestral line we trace the \"laying on of hands\" in\nthe most conspicuous as in the divinest order; and thus might he be\ntruly called a child of prayer and consecration. What pity that his\nbiographer should have been compelled to record, \"The most remarkable\nfeature of his character was his unbridled licentiousness\"! But we\ncannot drop the curtain here. We would relieve the picture by this\nsomewhat lighter shade. \"His intellectual energies were gigantic. As a\npleader and a determined and artful advocate, he had few equals. Hence,\nas a lawyer, he scarcely ever lost a case in his whole practice.\" An\namusing anecdote is related of him in his professional career.\n\n\"In an insurance case, the evidence of which was strongly against him,\nhe went in disguise to New London, where the witnesses, mostly sailors,\nresided. In a loafer-like swagger he proposed and secured bets from\nevery material evidence in the case, and thus disqualified them from\nbearing testimony, on the ground that they were interested witnesses.\"\nIn his old age he married his housekeeper, and closed an eventful and\nunblessed life at Bridgeport, April 14, 1826. 'Tis well to memorize him\nhere, and thus register birth and death on the very page that records\nthe most mysterious chapter of his history.\n\nLet us return to unite and conclude our story. In June, 1788, a female\nof uncommon beauty of person, yet with an oppressed and melancholy\nbearing, suddenly appeared at the old Bell Tavern in Danvers,\nMassachusetts, (a drawing of which is here introduced.) She was habited\nin black, and was seldom seen abroad, never except alone, and at\ntwilight, when she was observed to wander as far as the old burying\nground hard by, and there to pause at its entrance, gazing long and\nearnestly upon its silent, scattered mounds, at length retracing her\nsteps with the same melancholy gait and air.\n\nHere she remained nearly a month, discovering to none her real name or\nsituation. She passed her time in writing, and occasionally playing upon\na guitar, which was the only companion of her solitude. After remaining\nthere about two weeks a chaise was seen to pause before the door, upon\nthe lintel of which had secretly been traced in chalk, as it afterwards\nappeared, the letters \"E.W.\" A gentleman hastily alighted, and was also\nobserved through the darkness of the evening to examine the casing of\nthe door, and then return to the chaise and drive rapidly away.\n\nThe opinion was, by those who were cognizant of the fact, that this was\na secret, preconcerted sign by which the lover should recognize the\nplace of her retreat; and being too faintly drawn, through the darkness\nof the night he failed to discover the characters.\n\nFrom this time, however, the spirits of the stranger evidently sunk; and\nin two weeks more birth and death had followed each other, and the grave\nhad closed over all.\n\nThis stranger had, in her peculiar situation, tenderly won upon the\nsympathies of a few kind-hearted individuals who had made their way to\nher, one of whom, a Mrs. Southwick, lived directly opposite the Bell\nTavern. These were with her in her last great agony, in which all sense\nof guilt was lost in pity. Mrs. S. has related that no word of complaint\nor accusation was heard to fall from her lips, while the spirit seemed\nbrightening with an unearthly hope, till what was charming in life was\nindescribably lovely in death. Thus they laid the beautiful stranger in\nthe saintly robes of the sepulchre without censure and without\naccusation, not knowing how painfully she was mourned and missed, as a\nstar shut out of vision by clouds and storm, in the home of her\nchildhood and in the heart of a widowed mother.\n\nShe had passed under the assumed name of Walker while at the Bell Tavern\nof Danvers, and her wardrobe was found marked with the corresponding\ninitials, \"E.W.,\" although applying to her real name as well. These\nfacts, in connection with her death, were immediately published in the\nBoston and Salem journals, and her friends advertised to appear; and\nthus were her real name and place of residence elicited.\n\nA short time afterwards, and a stranger came and caused to be erected in\nthe old burying ground in Danvers, on the spot where she was interred,\ntwo \"gray stones,\" after the manner of Ossian, with the touching\ninscription which this volume records; and the feet of strangers, moved\nby pity and humanity, have worn a path to her grave which he who covets\nmost in the world's memory might even envy.\n\nThe tombstones (which the fathers of that ancient town should shame to\nhave recorded) have been battered and broken for relics, till much of\nthe inscription is gone already, and the footstone entirely removed.\n\nBut I have noted that Elizabeth Whitman was of superior merit, and had\nbeen recognized as a child of genius in its most earnest sense. From her\nearliest childhood she had been remarkable for a deeply poetic\ntemperament, and it appears she was recognized as a poet of no common\norder by the most distinguished writers of the day--Barlow, Trumbull,\nand others. Why her name and writings have not been handed down to us by\nthose who have essayed to make careful compilations of the literature of\nthe past century, I am unable to divine. She was a relative as well of\nthe last-named poet, Trumbull, on the side of his mother, who was Sarah\nWhitman, a sister of Rev. Elnathan Whitman, the father of Elizabeth.\n\nI find in the journals of that time the following poem, which, though\nnot the best of her productions, certainly gives evidence of much poetic\npower:--\n\nTO MR. BARLOW.\n\n_By his Friend_ ELIZABETH WHITMAN, _on New Year's Day_, 1783.\n\n  Should every wish the heart of friendship knows\n  Be to your ear conveyed in rustic prose,\n  Lost in the wonders of your Eastern clime,\n  Or rapt in vision to some unborn time,\n  Th' unartful tale might no attention gain;\n  For Friendship knows not, like the Muse, to feign.\n  Forgive her, then, if in this weak essay\n  She tries to emulate thy daring lay,\n  And give to truth and warm affection's glow\n  The charms that from the tuneful sisters flow.\n\n  On this blest morning's most auspicious rise,\n  Which finds thee circled with domestic joys,\n  May thy glad heart its grateful tribute pay\n  To Him who shaped thy course and smoothed thy way--\n  That guardian Power, who, to thy merit kind,\n  Bestowed the bliss most suited to thy mind--\n  Retirement, friendship, leisure, learned ease,\n  All that the philosophic mind can please;\n  All that the Muses love, th' harmonious nine,\n  Inspire thy lays, and aid the great design.\n  But more than all the world could else bestow,\n  All pleasures that from fame or fortune flow,\n  To fix secure in bliss thy future life,\n  Heaven crowned thy blessings with a lovely wife--\n  Wise, gentle, good, with every grace combined\n  That charms the sense or captivates the mind;\n  Skilled every soft emotion to improve,\n  The joy of friendship, and the wish of love;\n  To soothe the heart which pale Misfortune's train\n  Invades with grief or agonizing pain;\n  To point through devious paths the narrow road\n  That leads the soul to virtue or to God.\n\n  O friend! O sister! to my bosom dear\n  By every tie that binds the soul sincere;\n  O, while I fondly dwell upon thy name,\n  Why sinks my soul, unequal to the theme?\n  But though unskilled thy various worth to praise,\n  Accept my wishes, and excuse my lays.\n  May all thy future days, like this, be gay,\n  And love and fortune blend their kindest ray;\n  Long in their various gifts mayst thou be blessed,\n  And late ascend the realms of endless rest.\n\nAmong her papers, also, after her decease, was found a pastoral on\n\"Disappointment,\" which here follows, evidently written during her\nseclusion in Danvers, with this brief and pathetic letter in\nstenographic characters:--\n\n\"Must I die alone? Shall I never see you more? I know that you will\ncome; but you will come too late. This is, I fear, my last ability.\nTears fall so fast I know not how to write. Why did you leave me in such\ndistress? But I will not reproach you. All that was dear I forsook for\nyou, but do not regret it. May God forgive in both what was amiss. When\nI go from here, I will leave you some way to find me. If I die, will you\ncome and drop a tear over my grave?\"\n\nThe poem, which continues in the same moving strain, is touching and\ntender, and betrays a heart full of refinement and sensibility.\n\n  DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\n  With fond impatience, all the tedious day\n  I sighed, and wished the lingering hours away;\n  For when bright Hesper led the starry train,\n  My shepherd swore to meet me on the plain.\n  With eager haste to that dear spot I flew,\n  And lingered long, and then in tears withdrew.\n  Alone, abandoned to love's tenderest woes,\n  Down my pale cheeks the tide of sorrow flows;\n  Dead to all joy that Fortune can bestow,\n  In vain for me her useless bounties flow.\n  Take back each envied gift, ye powers divine,\n  And only let me call Fidelio mine.\n  Ah, wretch! what anguish yet thy soul must prove!\n  For thou canst hope to lose thy care in love;\n  And when Fidelio meets thy tearful eye,\n  Pale fear and cold despair his presence fly.\n  With pensive steps I sought thy walks again,\n  And kissed thy token on the verdant plain;\n  With fondest hope, through many a blissful hour,\n  We gave our souls to Fancy's pleasing power.\n  Lost in the magic of that sweet employ,\n  To build gay scenes and fashion future joy,\n  We saw mild Peace over fair _Canaan_ rise,\n  And shower her pleasures from benignant skies.\n  On airy hills our happy mansion rose,\n  Built but for joy--no room for future woes.\n  Round the calm solitude with ceaseless song,\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  Sweet as the sleep of innocence the day,\n  By transports measured, lightly danced away;\n  To love, to bliss, the unioned soul was given,\n  And--ah, too happy!--asked no brighter heaven.\n  And must the hours in ceaseless anguish roll?\n  Will no soft sunshine cheer my clouded soul?\n  Can this dear earth no transient joy supply?\n  Is it my doom to hope, despair, and die?\n  O, come once more, with soft endearments come;\n  Burst the cold prison of the sullen tomb;\n  Through favored walks thy chosen maid attend\n  Where well-known shades their pleasing branches bend;\n  Shed the soft poison of thy speaking eye,\n  And look those raptures lifeless words deny.\n  Still he, though late, reheard what ne'er could tire,\n  But, told each eve, fresh pleasures would inspire;\n  Still hope those scenes which love and fancy drew,\n  But, drawn a thousand times, were ever new.\n\n  Can fancy paint, can words express,\n  Can aught on earth my woes redress?\n  E'en thy soft smiles can ceaseless prove\n  Thy truth, thy tenderness, and love.\n  Once thou couldst every bliss inspire,\n  Transporting joy and gay desire;\n  Now cold Despair her banner rears,\n  And Pleasure flies when she appears;\n  Fond Hope within my bosom dies,\n  And Agony her place supplies.\n  O thou, for whose dear sake I bear\n  A doom so dreadful, so severe,\n  May happy fates thy footsteps guide,\n  And o'er thy _peaceful_ home preside;\n  Nor let E----a's early tomb\n  Infect thee with its baleful gloom.\n\nStill another poem, of more genuine beauty and strength than either of\nthese, has been preserved in her own handwriting, which I doubt not the\nreader will thank me for introducing here, although it bears more of\nrecrimination than the others.\n\n  Thy presents to some happier lover send;\n  Content thyself to be Lucinda's friend.\n  The soft expression of thy gay design\n  Ill suits the sadness of a heart like mine--\n  A heart like mine, forever doomed to prove\n  Each tender woe, but not one joy of love.\n\n  First from my arms a dying lover torn,\n  In early life it was my fate to mourn.\n  A father next, by fate's relentless doom,\n  With heartfelt woe I followed to the tomb.\n  Now all was lost; no friends remained to guide\n  My erring step, or calm life's boisterous tide.\n\n  Again th' admiring youths around me bowed;\n  And one I singled from the sighing crowd.\n  Well skilled he was in every winning art--\n  To warm the fancy, or to touch the heart.\n  Why must my pen the noble praise deny,\n  Which virtue, worth, and honor _should_ supply?\n\n  O youth beloved! what pangs my breast has borne\n  To find thee false, ungrateful, and forsworn!\n  A shade and darkness o'er my prospect spreads,\n  The damps of night and death's eternal shades.\n  The scorpion's sting, by disappointment brought,\n  And all the horrors of despairing thought,\n  Sad as they are, I might, perhaps, endure,\n  And bear with patience what admits no cure.\n  But here my bosom is to madness moved;\n  I suffer by the wrongs of him I loved.\n\n  O, had I died by pitying Heaven's decree,\n  Nor proved so black, so base, a mind in thee!\n  But vain the wish; my heart was doomed to prove\n  Each torturing pang, but not one joy of love.\n  Wouldst thou again fallacious prospects spread,\n  And woo me from the confines of the dead?\n  The pleasing scenes that charmed me once retrace--\n  Gay scenes of rapture and ecstatic bliss?\n  How did my heart embrace the dear deceit,\n  And fondly cherish the deluding cheat!\n  Delusive hope, and wishes sadly vain,\n  Unless to sharpen disappointment's pain.\n\nThese are but the fragmentary proofs of her poetic ability; still they\nare the most that have been preserved bearing _full authenticity_; yet\nthese betray a skilful and accustomed pen, though stamped with the\nbitterness of woe.\n\nHere, then, we will take up the idea which we left several pages back,\nin order to introduce a quotation from a volume of singular power in\nbehalf of those thus gifted, who are every where looked upon with some\ndegree of suspicion at least, as I find our heroine was even long before\nshe wandered from the path of virtue. I quote it only to soften the\nharsher judgment of the world, ever eager to condemn what it cannot\ncomprehend; yet must it by no means be made to apologize for any sin.\n\nWhile I am willing to be known as believing that genius can be governed\nby no conventional laws, but is ever a law unto itself, I am also in the\nfull belief of the independent moral power of every individual to\nregulate his own acts according to the purest code of morality. But to\nthe quotation, which, with the above remarks, the reader would find\npertinent to time and place had he turned over the historical pages\nhaving a bearing on this romance which I have.\n\n\"The strong seductions and fierce trials of the heart of genius who\nshall estimate? * * * What does an ordinary mind know of the inner storm\nand whirlwind, as it were, of restlessness; the craving after excitement\nand high action; the inability to calm the breast and repose in fixity;\nthe wild beatings and widowed longings after sympathy? * * * It is the\nsevere lot of genius that its blessedness should be its bane; _that that\nwherein its heavenly franchise gives it to excel mankind is the point\nwherein it should be cursed above its brethren_!\"\n\nMore I might quote; but these few extracts are sufficient for my\npurpose; and I hasten to conclude this chapter with what may to the\ngeneral reader appear more relevant.\n\n       *        *        *        *        *\n\nNot many years ago the Bell Tavern, as it was ever named, was razed to\nits foundation, and a new building erected on the spot where it stood.\nAt this time a pleasant _jeu d'esprit_ from the humorous and ready\npen--which has failed not to make its mark in the world--of Fitch Poole,\nEsq., of Danvers, was published, which gained a wide credence in its\nauthenticity. This curious witticism affected to have discovered in the\nwall of the room which \"Eliza Wharton\" occupied an original letter from\nher to Mr. Edwards, dated May, 1778, besides various articles of her\nwearing apparel, such as slippers, &c., and also her guitar, all of\nwhich had been concealed in the ceiling since the sad close of her\nhistory. Numbers flocked to see them; but, as it was a mere pleasantry,\nthe hoax was well received, and ended in the neighborhood of Danvers\nwith the privileged \"April fool's day\" of its date, although it may even\nyet have believers in distant places.\n\nThus, kind reader, have I accomplished the task assigned me with\nfidelity to truth and to humanity, and here lay the offering on the\naltar of universal love without excuse.\n\nJANE E. LOCKE.\n\nBOSTON, 1854.\n\nNOTE.--For important facts which have greatly aided me in preparing this\nprefatory chapter I am much indebted, as I would here gratefully\nacknowledge, to Ezekiel White, Esq., of Easthampton, and Mrs. H.V.\nCheney, of Montreal.\n\nJ.E.L.\n\n[Footnote A: John Whitman, whose father was brother to the grandfather\nof \"Eliza Wharton,\" married a daughter of Rev.

It is\n_pleasure_, pleasure, my dear Lucy, on leaving my paternal roof. Could\nyou have believed that the darling child of an indulgent and\ndearly-beloved mother would feel a gleam of joy at leaving her? But so\nit is. The melancholy, the gloom, the condolence which surrounded me for\na month after the death of Mr. Haly had depressed my spirits, and palled\nevery enjoyment of life. Mr. Haly was a man of worth--a man of real and\nsubstantial merit. He is, therefore, deeply and justly regretted by\n_his_ friends. He was chosen to be a future guardian and companion for\nme, and was, therefore, beloved by _mine_. As their choice, as a good\nman, and a faithful friend, I esteemed him; but no one acquainted with\nthe disparity of our tempers and dispositions, our views and designs,\ncan suppose my heart much engaged in the alliance. Both nature and\neducation had instilled into my mind an implicit obedience to the will\nand desires of my parents. To them, of course, I sacrificed my fancy in\nthis affair, determined that my reason should concur with theirs, and on\nthat to risk my future happiness. I was the more encouraged, as I saw,\nfrom our first acquaintance, his declining health, and expected that the\nevent would prove as it has. Think not, however, that I rejoice in his\ndeath. No; far be it from me; for though I believe that I never felt the\npassion of love for Mr. Haly, yet a habit of conversing with him, of\nhearing daily the most virtuous, tender, and affectionate sentiments\nfrom his lips, inspired emotions of the sincerest friendship and esteem.\n\nHe is gone. His fate is unalterably, and I trust happily, fixed. He\nlived the life, and died the death, of the righteous. O that my last end\nmay be like his! This event will, I hope, make a suitable and abiding\nimpression upon my mind, teach me the fading nature of all sublunary\nenjoyments, and the little dependence which is to be placed on earthly\nfelicity. Whose situation was more agreeable, whose prospects more\nflattering, than Mr. Haly's? Social, domestic, and connubial joys were\nfondly anticipated, and friends and fortune seemed ready to crown every\nwish; yet, animated by still brighter hopes, he cheerfully bade them all\nadieu. In conversation with me but a few days before his exit, \"There\nis,\" said he, \"but one link in the chain of life undissevered; that, my\ndear Eliza, is my attachment to you. But God is wise and good in all his\nways; and in this, as in all other respects, I would cheerfully say, His\nwill be done.\"\n\nYou, my friend, were witness to the concluding scene; and, therefore, I\nneed not describe it.\n\nI shall only add on the subject, that if I have wisdom and prudence to\nfollow his advice and example, if his prayers for my temporal and\neternal welfare be heard and answered, I shall be happy indeed.\n\nThe disposition of mind which I now feel I wish to cultivate. Calm,\nplacid, and serene, thoughtful of my duty, and benevolent to all around\nme, I wish for no other connection than that of friendship.\n\nThis letter is all an egotism. I have even neglected to mention the\nrespectable and happy friends with whom I reside, but will do it in my\nnext. Write soon and often; and believe me sincerely yours,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER II.\n\nTO THE SAME.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nTime, which effaces every occasional impression, I find gradually\ndispelling the pleasing pensiveness which the melancholy event, the\nsubject of my last, had diffused over my mind. Naturally cheerful,\nvolatile, and unreflecting, the opposite disposition I have found to\ncontain sources of enjoyment which I was before unconscious of\npossessing.\n\nMy friends here are the picture of conjugal felicity. The situation is\ndelightful--the visiting parties perfectly agreeable. Every thing tends\nto facilitate the return of my accustomed vivacity. I have written to my\nmother, and received an answer. She praises my fortitude, and admires\nthe philosophy which I have exerted under what she calls my heavy\nbereavement. Poor woman! she little thinks that my heart was untouched;\nand when that is unaffected, other sentiments and passions make but a\ntransient impression. I have been, for a month or two, excluded from the\ngay world, and, indeed, fancied myself soaring above it. It is now that\nI begin to descend, and find my natural propensity for mixing in the\nbusy scenes and active pleasures of life returning. I have received your\nletter--your moral lecture rather; and be assured, my dear, your\nmonitorial lessons and advice shall be attended to. I believe I shall\nnever again resume those airs which you term _coquettish_, but which I\nthink deserve a softer appellation, as they proceed from an innocent\nheart, and are the effusions of a youthful and cheerful mind. We are all\ninvited to spend the day to-morrow at Colonel Farington's, who has an\nelegant seat in this neighborhood. Both he and his lady are strangers to\nme; but the friends by whom I am introduced will procure me a welcome\nreception. Adieu.\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER III.\n\nTO THE SAME.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nIs it time for me to talk again of conquests? or must I only enjoy them\nin silence? I must write to you the impulses of my mind, or I must not\nwrite at all. You are not so morose as to wish me to become a nun, would\nour country and religion allow it. I ventured, yesterday, to throw aside\nthe habiliments of mourning, and to array myself in those more adapted\nto my taste. We arrived at Colonel Farington's about one o'clock. The\ncolonel handed me out of the carriage, and introduced me to a large\ncompany assembled in the hall.\n\nMy name was pronounced with an _emphasis_, and I was received with the\nmost flattering tokens of respect. When we were summoned to dinner, a\nyoung gentleman in a clerical dress offered me his hand, and led me to a\ntable furnished with an elegant and sumptuous repast, with more\ngallantry and address than commonly fall to the share of students. He\nsat opposite me at table; and whenever I raised my eye, it caught his.\nThe ease and politeness of his manners, with his particular attention to\nme, raised my curiosity, and induced me to ask Mrs. Laiton who he was.\nShe told me that his name was Boyer; that he was descended from a\nworthy family; had passed with honor and applause through the university\nwhere he was educated; had since studied divinity with success; and now\nhad a call to settle as a minister in one of the first parishes in a\nneighboring state.\n\nThe gates of a spacious garden were thrown open at this instant, and I\naccepted with avidity an invitation to walk in it. Mirth and hilarity\nprevailed, and the moments fled on downy wings, while we traced the\nbeauties of Art and Nature, so liberally displayed and so happily\nblended in this delightful retreat. An enthusiastic admirer of scenes\nlike these, I had rambled some way from the company, when I was followed\nby Mrs. Laiton to offer her condolence on the supposed loss which I had\nsustained in the death of Mr. Haly. My heart rose against the woman, so\nignorant of human nature as to think such conversation acceptable at\nsuch a time. I made her little reply, and waved the subject, though I\ncould not immediately dispel the gloom which it excited.\n\nThe absurdity of a custom authorizing people at a first interview to\nrevive the idea of griefs which time has lulled, perhaps obliterated, is\nintolerable. To have our enjoyments arrested by the empty compliments of\nunthinking persons for no other reason than a compliance with fashion,\nis to be treated in a manner which the laws of humanity forbid.\n\nWe were soon joined by the gentlemen, who each selected his partner, and\nthe walk was prolonged.\n\nMr. Boyer offered me his arm, which I gladly accepted, happy to be\nrelieved from the impertinence of my female companion. We returned to\ntea; after which the ladies sung, and played by turns on the piano\nforte; while some of the gentlemen accompanied with the flute, the\nclarinet, and the violin, forming in the whole a very decent concert. An\nelegant supper, and half an hour's conversation after it, closed the\nevening; when we returned home, delighted with our entertainment, and\npleased with ourselves and each other. My imagination is so impressed\nwith the festive scenes of the day that Morpheus waves his ebon wand in\nvain. The evening is fine beyond the power of description; all Nature is\nserene and harmonious, in perfect unison with my present disposition of\nmind. I have been taking a retrospect of my past life, and, a few\njuvenile follies excepted, which I trust the recording angel has blotted\nout with a tear of charity, find an approving conscience and a heart at\nease. Fortune, indeed, has not been very liberal of her gifts to me; but\nI presume on a large stock in the bank of friendship, which, united\nwith health and innocence, give me some pleasing anticipations of future\nfelicity.\n\n\nWhatever my fate may be, I shall always continue your\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER IV.\n\nTO MR. SELBY.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nYou ask me, my friend, whether I am in pursuit of truth, or a lady. I\nanswer, Both. I hope and trust they are united, and really expect to\nfind Truth, and the Virtues and Graces besides, in a fair form. If you\nmean by the first part of your question whether I am searching into the\nsublimer doctrines of religion,--to these I would by no means be\ninattentive; but, to be honest, my studies of that kind have been very\nmuch interrupted of late. The respectable circle of acquaintances with\nwhich I am honored here has rendered my visits very frequent and\nnumerous. In one of these I was introduced to Miss Eliza Wharton--a\nyoung lady whose elegant person, accomplished mind, and polished\nmanners have been much celebrated. Her fame has often reached me; but,\nas the Queen of Sheba said to Solomon, the half was not told me. You\nwill think that I talk in the style of a lover.\n\nI confess it; nor am I ashamed to rank myself among the professed\nadmirers of this lovely fair one. I am in no danger, however, of\nbecoming an enthusiastic devotee. No; I mean I act upon just and\nrational principles. Expecting soon to settle in an eligible situation,\nif such a companion as I am persuaded she will make me may fall to my\nlot, I shall deem myself as happy as this state of imperfection will\nadmit. She is now resident at General Richman's. The general and his\nlady are her particular friends; they are warm in her praises. They tell\nme, however, that she is naturally of a gay disposition. No matter for\nthat; it is an agreeable quality, where there is discretion sufficient\nfor its regulation. A cheerful friend, much more a cheerful wife, is\npeculiarly necessary to a person of a studious and sedentary life. They\ndispel the gloom of retirement, and exhilarate the spirits depressed by\nintense application. She was formerly addressed by the late Mr. Haly, of\nBoston. He was not, it seems, the man of her choice; but her parents\nwere extremely partial to him, and wished the connection to take place.\nShe, like a dutiful child, sacrificed her own inclination to their\npleasure so far as to acquiesce in his visits. This she more easily\naccomplished, as his health, which declined from their first\nacquaintance, led her to suppose, as the event has proved, that he would\nnot live to enter into any lasting engagements. Her father, who died\nsome months before him, invited him to reside at his house for the\nbenefit of a change of air, agreeably to the advice of his physicians.\nShe attended him during his last illness with all the care and assiduity\nof a nurse and with all the sympathizing tenderness of a sister.\n\nI have had several opportunities of conversing with her. She discovers\nan elevated mind, a ready apprehension, and an accurate knowledge of the\nvarious subjects which have been brought into view. I have not yet\nintroduced the favorite subject of my heart. Indeed, she seems\nstudiously to avoid noticing any expression which leads towards it; but\nshe must hear it soon. I am sure of the favor and interest of the\nfriends with whom she resides. They have promised to speak previously in\nmy behalf. I am to call, as if accidentally, this afternoon just as they\nare to ride abroad. They are to refer me to Miss Wharton for\nentertainment till their return. What a delightful opportunity for my\npurpose! I am counting the hours--nay, the very moments. Adieu. You\nshall soon again hear from your most obedient,\n\nJ. BOYER.\n\n\nLETTER V.\n\nTO MISS LUCY FREEMAN.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nThese bewitching charms of mine have a tendency to keep my mind in a\nstate of perturbation. I am so pestered with these admirers! Not that I\nam so very handsome neither; but, I don't know how it is, I am certainly\nvery much the taste of the other sex. Followed, flattered, and caressed,\nI have cards and compliments in profusion. But I must try to be serious;\nfor I have, alas! one serious lover. As I promised you to be particular\nin my writing, I suppose I must proceed methodically. Yesterday we had a\nparty to dine. Mr. Boyer was of the number. His attention was\nimmediately engrossed; and I soon perceived that every word, every\naction, and every look was studied to gain my approbation. As he sat\nnext me at dinner, his assiduity and politeness were pleasing; and as we\nwalked together afterwards, his conversation was improving. Mine was\nsentimental and sedate--perfectly adapted to the taste of my gallant.\nNothing, however, was said particularly expressive of his apparent\nwishes. I studiously avoided every kind of discourse which might lead to\nthis topic. I wish not for a declaration from any one, especially from\none whom I could not repulse and do not intend to encourage at present.\nHis conversation, so similar to what I had often heard from a similar\ncharacter, brought a deceased friend to mind, and rendered me somewhat\npensive. I retired directly after supper. Mr. Boyer had just taken\nleave.\n\nMrs. Richman came into my chamber as she was passing to her own. \"Excuse\nmy intrusion, Eliza,\" said she. \"I thought I would just step in and ask\nyou if you have passed a pleasant day.\"\n\n\"Perfectly so, madam; and I have now retired to protract the enjoyment\nby recollection.\" \"What, my dear, is your opinion of our favorite, Mr.\nBoyer?\" \"Declaring him your favorite, madam, is sufficient to render me\npartial to him; but to be frank, independent of that, I think him an\nagreeable man.\" \"Your heart, I presume, is now free.\" \"Yes, and I hope\nit will long remain so.\" \"Your friends, my dear, solicitous for your\nwelfare, wish to see you suitably and agreeably connected.\" \"I hope my\nfriends will never again interpose in my concerns of that nature. You,\nmadam, who have ever known my heart, are sensible that, had the\nAlmighty spared life in a certain instance, I must have sacrificed my\nown happiness or incurred their censure. I am young, gay, volatile. A\nmelancholy event has lately extricated me from those shackles which\nparental authority had imposed on my mind. Let me, then, enjoy that\nfreedom which I so highly prize. Let me have opportunity, unbiased by\nopinion, to gratify my natural disposition in a participation of those\npleasures which youth and innocence afford.\" \"Of such pleasures, no one,\nmy dear, would wish to deprive you; but beware, Eliza! Though strewed\nwith flowers, when contemplated by your lively imagination, it is, after\nall, a slippery, thorny path. The round of fashionable dissipation is\ndangerous. A phantom is often pursued, which leaves its deluded votary\nthe real form of wretchedness.\" She spoke with an emphasis, and, taking\nup her candle, wished me a good night. I had not power to return the\ncompliment. Something seemingly prophetic in her looks and expressions\ncast a momentary gloom upon my mind; but I despise those contracted\nideas which confine virtue to a cell. I have no notion of becoming a\nrecluse. Mrs. Richman has ever been a beloved friend of mine; yet I\nalways thought her rather prudish. Adieu.\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER VI.\n\nTO THE SAME.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI had scarcely seated myself at the breakfast table this morning when a\nservant entered with a card of invitation from Major Sanford, requesting\nthe happiness of my hand this evening at a ball given by Mr. Atkins,\nabout three miles from this. I showed the billet to Mrs. Richman,\nsaying, \"I have not much acquaintance with this gentleman, madam; but I\nsuppose his character sufficiently respectable to warrant an affirmative\nanswer.\" \"He is a gay man, my dear, to say no more; and such are the\ncompanions we wish when we join a party avowedly formed for pleasure.\" I\nthen stepped into my apartment, wrote an answer, and despatched the\nservant. When I returned to the parlor, something disapprobating\nappeared in the countenances of both my friends. I endeavored, without\nseeming to observe, to dissipate it by chitchat; but they were better\npleased with each other than with me, and, soon rising, walked into the\ngarden, and left me to amuse myself alone. My eyes followed them\nthrough the window. \"Happy pair!\" said I. \"Should it ever be my fate to\nwear the hymeneal chain, may I be thus united! The purest and most\nardent affection, the greatest consonance of taste and disposition, and\nthe most congenial virtue and wishes distinguish this lovely couple.\nHealth and wealth, with every attendant blessing, preside over their\nfavored dwelling, and shed their benign influence without alloy.\" The\nconsciousness of exciting their displeasure gave me pain; but I consoled\nmyself with the idea that it was ill founded.\n\n\"They should consider,\" said I, \"that they have no satisfaction to look\nfor beyond each other; there every enjoyment is centred; but I am a poor\nsolitary being, who need some amusement beyond what I can supply myself.\nThe mind, after being confined at home for a while, sends the\nimagination abroad in quest of new treasures; and the body may as well\naccompany it, for aught I can see.\"\n\nGeneral Richman and lady have ever appeared solicitous to promote my\nhappiness since I have resided with them. They have urged my acceptance\nof invitations to join parties; though they have not been much\nthemselves of late, as Mrs. Richman's present circumstances render her\nfond of retirement. What reason can be assigned for their apparent\nreluctance to this evening's entertainment is to me incomprehensible;\nbut I shall apply the chemical powers of friendship, and extract the\nsecret from Mrs. Richman to-morrow, if not before. Adieu. I am now\nsummoned to dinner, and after that shall be engaged in preparation till\nthe wished-for hour of hilarity and mirth engrosses every faculty of\nyour\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER VII.\n\nTO MR. SELBY.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nDivines need not declaim, nor philosophers expatiate, on the\ndisappointments of human life. Are they not legibly written on every\npage of our existence? Are they not predominantly prevalent over every\nperiod of our lives?\n\nWhen I closed my last letter to you, my heart exulted in the pleasing\nanticipation of promised bliss; my wishes danced on the light breezes of\nhope; and my imagination dared to arrest the attention of, and even\nclaim a return of affection from, the lovely Eliza Wharton. But\nimagination only it has proved, and that dashed with the bitter\nranklings of jealousy and suspicion.\n\nBut to resume my narrative. I reached the mansion of my friend about\nfour. I was disagreeably struck with the appearance of a carriage at the\ndoor, as it raised an idea of company which might frustrate my plan; but\nstill more disagreeable were my sensations when, on entering the parlor,\nI found Major Sanford evidently in a waiting posture. I was very\npolitely received; and when Eliza entered the room with a brilliance of\nappearance and gayety of manner which I had never before connected with\nher character, I rose, as did Major Sanford, who offered his hand and\nled her to a chair. I forgot to sit down again, but stood transfixed by\nthe pangs of disappointment. Miss Wharton appeared somewhat confused,\nbut, soon resuming her vivacity, desired me to be seated, inquired after\nmy health, and made some commonplace remarks on the weather; then,\napologizing for leaving me, gave her hand again to Major Sanford, who\nhad previously risen, and reminded her that the time and their\nengagements made it necessary to leave the good company; which, indeed,\nthey both appeared very willing to do. General Richman and lady took\nevery method in their power to remove my chagrin and atone for the\nabsence of my fair one; but ill did they succeed. They told me that Miss\nWharton had not the most distant idea of my visiting there this\nafternoon, much less of the design of my visit; that for some months\ntogether she had been lately confined by the sickness of Mr. Haly, whom\nshe attended during the whole of his last illness; which confinement had\neventually increased her desire of indulging her natural disposition for\ngayety. She had, however, they said, an excellent heart and reflecting\nmind, a great share of sensibility, and a temper peculiarly formed for\nthe enjoyments of social life. \"But this gentleman, madam, who is her\ngallant this evening,--is his character unexceptionable? Will a lady of\ndelicacy associate with an immoral, not to say profligate, man?\" \"The\nrank and fortune of Major Sanford,\" said Mrs. Richman, \"procure him\nrespect; his specious manners render him acceptable in public company;\nbut I must own that he is not the person with whom I wish my cousin to\nbe connected even for a moment. She never consulted me so little on any\nsubject as that of his card this morning. Before I had time to object,\nshe dismissed the servant; and I forbore to destroy her expected\nhappiness by acquainting her with my disapprobation of her partner. Her\nomission was not design; it was juvenile indiscretion. We must, my dear\nsir,\" continued she, \"look with a candid eye on such eccentricities.\nFaults, not foibles, require the severity of censure.\" \"Far, madam, be\nit from me to censure any conduct which as yet I have observed in Miss\nWharton; she has too great an interest in my heart to admit of that.\"\n\nWe now went into more general conversation. Tea was served; and I soon\nafter took leave. General Richman, however, insisted on my dining with\nhim on Thursday; which I promised. And here I am again over head and\nears in the hypo--a disease, you will say, peculiar to students. I\nbelieve it peculiar to lovers; and with that class I must now rank\nmyself, though I did not know, until this evening, that I was so much\nengaged as I find I really am. I knew, indeed, that I was extremely\npleased with this amiable girl; that I was interested in her favor; that\nI was happier in her company than any where else; with innumerable other\ncircumstances, which would have told me the truth had I examined them.\nBut be that as it may, I hope and trust that I am, and ever shall be, a\nreasonable creature, and not suffer my judgment to be misled by the\noperations of a blind passion.\n\nI shall now lay aside this subject; endeavor to divest even my\nimagination of the charmer; and return, until Thursday, to the\ncontemplation of those truths and duties which have a happy tendency to\ncalm the jarring elements which compose our mortal frame. Adieu.\n\nJ. BOYER.\n\n\nLETTER VIII.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nWe had an elegant ball, last night, Charles; and what is still more to\nthe taste of your old friend, I had an elegant partner; one exactly\ncalculated to please my fancy--gay, volatile, apparently thoughtless of\nevery thing but present enjoyment. It was Miss Eliza Wharton--a young\nlady whose agreeable person, polished manners, and refined talents have\nrendered her the toast of the country around for these two years; though\nfor half that time she has had a clerical lover imposed on her by her\nfriends; for I am told it was not agreeable to her inclination. By this\nsame clerical lover of hers she was for several months confined as a\nnurse. But his death has happily relieved her; and she now returns to\nthe world with redoubled lustre. At present she is a visitor to Mrs.\nRichman, who is a relation. I first saw her on a party of pleasure at\nMr. Frazier's, where we walked, talked, sang, and danced together. I\nthought her cousin watched her with a jealous eye; for she is, you must\nknow, a prude; and immaculate--more so than you or I--must be the man\nwho claims admission to her society. But I fancy this young lady is a\ncoquette; and if so, I shall avenge my sex by retaliating the mischiefs\nshe meditates against us. Not that I have any ill designs, but only to\nplay off her own artillery by using a little unmeaning gallantry. And\nlet her beware of the consequences. A young clergyman came in at General\nRichman's yesterday, while I was waiting for Eliza, who was much more\ncordially received by the general and his lady than was your humble\nservant; but I lay that up.\n\nWhen she entered the room, an air of mutual embarrassment was evident.\nThe lady recovered her assurance much more easily than the gentleman. I\nam just going to ride, and shall make it in my way to call and inquire\nafter the health of my dulcinea. Therefore, adieu for the present.\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER IX.\n\nTO MISS LUCY FREEMAN.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI am not so happy to-day in the recollection of last evening's\nentertainment as I was in the enjoyment.\n\nThe explanation which I promised you from Mrs. Richman yesterday I could\nnot obtain. When I went down to dinner some friends of General Richman's\nhad accidentally dropped in, which precluded all particular\nconversation. I retired soon to dress, and saw Mrs. Richman no more till\nI was informed that Major Sanford waited for me. But I was surprised, on\ngoing into the parlor, to find Mr. Boyer there. I blushed and stammered;\nbut I know not why; for certain I am that I neither love nor fear the\ngood man yet, whatever I may do some future day. I would not be\nunderstood that I do not respect and esteem him; for I do both. But\nthese are calm passions, which soothe rather than agitate the mind. It\nwas not the consciousness of any impropriety of conduct; for I was far\nfrom feeling any. The entertainment for which I was prepared was such as\nvirtue would not disapprove, and my gallant was a man of fortune,\nfashion, and, for aught I knew, of unblemished character.\n\nBut Mr. Boyer was much more disconcerted than myself. Indeed, he did not\nrecover his philosophy while I staid. I believe, by some hints I have\nreceived since, that he had some particular views in which he was\ndisappointed.\n\nOur ball had every charm which could render a ball delightful. My\npartner was all ease, politeness, and attention; and your friend was as\nmuch flattered and caressed as vanity itself could wish. We returned to\nGeneral Richman's about two. Major Sanford asked leave to call and\ninquire after my health this morning; and I am now expecting him. I rose\nto breakfast. The late hour of retiring to rest had not depressed, but\nrather exhilarated, my spirits. My friends were waiting for me in their\nparlor. They received me sociably, inquired after my health, my last\nevening's entertainment, the company, &c.; when, after a little pause,\nMrs. Richman said, \"And how do you like Major Sanford, Eliza?\" \"Very\nwell indeed, madam; I think him a finished gentleman. Will you, who are\na connoisseur, allow him that title?\" \"No, my dear; in my opinion he\nfalls far below it, since he is deficient in one of the great essentials\nof the character; and that is _virtue_.\" \"I am surprised,\" said I; \"but\nhow has he incurred so severe a censure?\" \"By being a professed\nlibertine; by having but too successfully, practised the arts of\nseduction; by triumphing in the destruction of innocence and the peace\nof families.\" \"O, why was I not informed of this before? But perhaps\nthese are old affairs--the effects of juvenile folly--crimes of which he\nmay have repented, and which charity ought to obliterate.\" \"No, my dear,\nthey are recent facts---facts which he dares not deny--facts for which\nhe ought to be banished from all virtuous society. I should have\nintimated this to you before; but your precipitate acceptance of his\ninvitation deprived me of an opportunity until it was too late to\nprevent your going with him; and we thought it best to protract your\nenjoyment as long as possible, not doubting but your virtue and delicacy\nwould, in future, guard you against the like deception.\"\n\n\"Must I, then, become an avowed prude at once, and refuse him admission\nif he call in compliance with the customary forms?\" \"By no means. I am\nsensible that even the false maxims of the world must be complied with\nin a degree. But a man of Major Sanford's art can easily distinguish\nbetween a forbidding and an encouraging reception. The former may, in\nthis case, be given without any breach of the rules of politeness.\"\nAstonished and mortified, I knew not what further to say. I had been so\npleased with the man that I wished to plead in his favor; but virtue and\nprudence forbade. I therefore rose and retired. He is this moment, I am\ntold, below stairs; so that I must bid you adieu until the next post.\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER X.\n\nTO THE SAME.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nUpon closing my last, I walked down, and found Major Sanford alone. He\nmet me at the door of the parlor, and, taking my hand with an air of\naffectionate tenderness, led me to a seat, and took one beside me. I\nbelieve the gloom of suspicion had not entirely forsaken my brow. He\nappeared, however, not to notice it, but, after the compliments of the\nday had passed, entered into an easy and agreeable conversation on the\npleasures of society--a conversation perfectly adapted to my taste, and\ncalculated to dissipate my chagrin and pass the time imperceptibly. He\ninquired the place of my native abode; and, having informed him, he said\nhe had thoughts of purchasing the seat of Captain Pribble, in that\nneighborhood, for his residence; and could he be assured of my society\nand friendship, his resolution would be fixed. I answered his compliment\nonly by a slight bow. He took leave, and I retired to dress for the day,\nbeing engaged to accompany my cousin to dine at Mr. Lawrence's--a\ngentleman of fortune and fashion in this vicinity. Mr. Lawrence has but\none daughter, heiress to a large estate, with an agreeable form, but a\ncountenance which, to me, indicates not much soul. I was surprised in\nthe afternoon to see Major Sanford alight at the gate. He entered with\nthe familiarity of an old acquaintance, and, after accosting each of the\ncompany, told me, with a low bow, that he did not expect the happiness\nof seeing me again so soon. I received his compliment with a conscious\nawkwardness. Mrs. Richman's morning lecture still rang in my head; and\nher watchful eye now traced every turn of mine and every action of the\nmajor's. Indeed, his assiduity was painful to me; yet I found it\nimpossible to disengage myself a moment from him, till the close of the\nday brought our carriage to the door; when he handed me in, and,\npressing my hand to his lips, retired.\n\nWhat shall I say about this extraordinary man? Shall I own to you, my\nfriend, that he is pleasing to me? His person, his manners, his\nsituation, all combine to charm my fancy, and, to my lively imagination,\nstrew the path of life with flowers. What a pity, my dear Lucy, that the\ngraces and virtues are not oftener united! They must, however, meet in\nthe man of my choice; and till I find such a one, I shall continue to\nsubscribe my name\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XI.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nWell, Charles, I have been manoeuvring to-day a little revengefully.\nThat, you will say, is out of character. So baleful a passion does not\neasily find admission among those softer ones which you well know I\ncherish. However, I am a mere Proteus, and can assume any shape that\nwill best answer my purpose.\n\nI called this afternoon, as I told you I intended, at General Richman's.\nI waited some time in the parlor alone before Eliza appeared; and when\nshe did appear, the distant reserve of her manners and the pensiveness\nof her countenance convinced me that she had been vexed, and I doubted\nnot but Peter Sanford was the occasion. Her wise cousin, I could have\nsworn, had been giving her a detail of the vices of her gallant, and\nwarning her against the dangers of associating with him in future.\nNotwithstanding, I took no notice of any alteration in her behavior, but\nentered with the utmost facetiousness into a conversation which I\nthought most to her taste. By degrees she assumed her usual vivacity;\ncheerfulness and good humor again animated her countenance. I tarried\nas long as decency would admit. She having intimated that they were to\ndine at my friend Lawrence's, I caught at this information, and\ndetermined to follow them, and tease the jealous Mrs. Richman by playing\noff all the gallantry I was master of in her presence.\n\nI went, and succeeded to the utmost of my wishes, as I read in the\nvexation visible in the one, and the ease and attention displayed by the\nother. I believe, too, that I have charmed the eye, at least, of the\namiable Eliza. Indeed, Charles, she is a fine girl. I think it would\nhurt my conscience to wound her mind or reputation. Were I disposed to\nmarry, I am persuaded she would make an excellent wife; but that, you\nknow, is no part of my plan, so long as I can keep out of the noose.\nWhenever I do submit to be shackled, it must be from a necessity of\nmending my fortune. This girl would be far from doing that. However, I\nam pleased with her acquaintance, and mean not to abuse her credulity\nand good nature, if I can help it.\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER XII.\n\nTO MISS LUCY FREEMAN.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nThe heart of your friend is again besieged. Whether it will surrender to\nthe assailants or not I am unable at present to determine. Sometimes I\nthink of becoming a predestinarian, and submitting implicitly to fate,\nwithout any exercise of free will; but, as mine seems to be a wayward\none, I would counteract the operations of it, if possible.\n\nMrs. Richman told me this morning that she hoped I should be as\nagreeably entertained this afternoon as I had been the preceding; that\nshe expected Mr. Boyer to dine and take tea, and doubted not but he\nwould be as attentive and sincere to me, if not as gay and polite, as\nthe gentleman who obtruded his civilities yesterday. I replied that I\nhad no reason to doubt the sincerity of the one or the other, having\nnever put them to the test, nor did I imagine I ever should. \"Your\nfriends, Eliza,\" said she, \"would be very happy to see you united to a\nman of Mr. Boyer's worth, and so agreeably settled as he has a prospect\nof being.\" \"I hope,\" said I, \"that my friends are not so weary of my\ncompany as to wish to dispose of me. I am too happy in my present\nconnections to quit them for new ones. Marriage is the tomb of\nfriendship. It appears to me a very selfish state. Why do people in\ngeneral, as soon as they are married, centre all their cares, their\nconcerns, and pleasures in their own families? Former acquaintances are\nneglected or forgotten; the tenderest ties between friends are weakened\nor dissolved; and benevolence itself moves in a very limited sphere.\"\n\"It is the glory of the marriage state,\" she rejoined, \"to refine by\ncircumscribing our enjoyments. Here we can repose in safety.\n\n  'The friendships of the world are oft\n  Confed'racies in vice, or leagues in pleasure:\n  Ours has the purest virtue for its basis;\n  And such a friendship ends not but with life.'\n\nTrue, we cannot always pay that attention to former associates which we\nmay wish; but the little community which we superintend is quite as\nimportant an object, and certainly renders us more beneficial to the\npublic. True benevolence, though it may change its objects, is not\nlimited by time or place. Its effects are the same, and, aided by a\nsecond self, are rendered more diffusive and salutary.\"\n\nSome pleasantry passed, and we retired to dress. When summoned to\ndinner, I found Mr. Boyer below. If what is sometimes said be true, that\nlove is diffident, reserved, and unassuming, this man must be tinctured\nwith it. These symptoms were visible in his deportment when I entered\nthe room. However, he soon recovered himself, and the conversation took\na general turn. The festive board was crowned with sociability, and we\nfound in reality \"the feast of reason and the flow of soul.\" After we\nrose from table, a walk in the garden was proposed--an amusement we are\nall peculiarly fond of. Mr. Boyer offered me his arm. When at a\nsufficient distance from our company, he begged leave to congratulate\nhimself on having an opportunity, which he had ardently desired for some\ntime, of declaring to me his attachment, and of soliciting an interest\nin my favor; or, if he might be allowed the term, affection. I replied,\n\"That, sir, is indeed laying claim to an important interest. I believe\nyou must substitute some more indifferent epithet for the present.\"\n\"Well, then,\" said he, \"if it must be so, let it be esteem or\nfriendship.\" \"Indeed, sir,\" said I, \"you are entitled to them both.\nMerit has always a share in that bank; and I know of none who has a\nlarger claim on that score than Mr. Boyer.\" I suppose my manner was\nhardly serious enough for what he considered a weighty cause. He was a\nlittle disconcerted, but, soon regaining his presence of mind, entreated\nme, with an air of earnestness, to encourage his suit, to admit his\naddresses, and, if possible, to reward his love. I told him that this\nwas rather a sudden affair to me, and that I could not answer him\nwithout consideration. \"Well, then,\" said he, \"take what time you think\nproper; only relieve my suspense as soon as may be. Shall I visit you\nagain to-morrow?\" \"O, not so soon,\" said I; \"next Monday, I believe,\nwill be early enough. I will endeavor to be at home.\" He thanked me even\nfor that favor, recommended himself once more to my kindness, and we\nwalked towards the company, returned with them to the house, and he soon\ntook leave. I immediately retired to write this letter, which I shall\nclose without a single observation on the subject until I know your\nopinion.\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XIII.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nAnd so you wish to have my opinion before you know the result of your\nown.\n\nThis is playing a little too much with my patience; but, however, I will\ngratify you this once, in hopes that my epistle may have a good effect.\nYou will ask, perhaps, whether I would influence your judgment. I\nanswer, No, provided you will exercise it yourself; but I am a little\napprehensive that your fancy will mislead you. Methinks I can gather\nfrom your letters a predilection for this Major Sanford. But he is a\nrake, my dear friend; and can a lady of your delicacy and refinement\nthink of forming a connection with a man of that character? I hope not;\nnay, I am confident you do not. You mean only to exhibit a few more\ngirlish airs before you turn matron; but I am persuaded, if you wish to\nlead down the dance of life with regularity, you will not find a more\nexcellent partner than Mr. Boyer. Whatever you can reasonably expect in\na lover, husband, or friend, you may perceive to be united in this\nworthy man. His taste is undebauched, his manners not vitiated, his\nmorals uncorrupted. His situation in life is, perhaps, as elevated as\nyou have a right to claim. Forgive my plainness, Eliza. It is the task\nof friendship, sometimes, to tell disagreeable truths. I know your\nambition is to make a distinguished figure in the first class of\npolished society, to shine in the gay circle of fashionable amusements,\nand to bear off the palm amidst the votaries of pleasure. But these are\nfading honors, unsatisfactory enjoyments, incapable of gratifying those\nimmortal principles of reason and religion which have been implanted in\nyour mind by Nature, assiduously cultivated by the best of parents, and\nexerted, I trust, by yourself. Let me advise you, then, in conducting\nthis affair,--an affair big, perhaps, with your future fate,--to lay\naside those coquettish airs which you sometimes put on; and remember\nthat you are not dealing with a fop, who will take advantage of every\nconcession, but with a man of sense and honor, who will properly\nestimate your condescension and frankness. Act, then, with that modest\nfreedom, that dignified unreserve, which bespeak conscious rectitude and\nsincerity of heart.\n\nI shall be extremely anxious to hear the process and progress of this\nbusiness. Relieve my impatience as soon as possible; and believe me\nyours with undissembled affection.\n\nLUCY FREEMAN.\n\n\nLETTER XIV.\n\nTO MISS LUCY FREEMAN.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI have received, and read again and again, your friendly epistle. My\nreason and judgment entirely coincide with your opinion; but my fancy\nclaims some share in the decision; and I cannot yet tell which will\npreponderate. This was the day fixed for deciding Mr. Boyer's cause. My\nfriends here gave me a long dissertation on his merits. Your letter,\nlikewise, had its weight; and I was candidly summoning up the _pros_ and\n_cons_ in the garden, whither I had walked, (General Richman and lady\nhaving rode out,) when I was informed that he was waiting in the parlor.\nI went immediately in, (a good symptom, you will say,) and received him\nvery graciously. After the first compliments were over, he seemed eager\nto improve the opportunity to enter directly on the subject of his\npresent visit. It is needless for me to recite to you, who have long\nbeen acquainted with the whole process of courtship, the declarations,\npropositions, protestations, entreaties, looks, words, and actions of a\nlover. They are, I believe, much the same in the whole sex, allowing for\ntheir different dispositions, educations, and characters; but you are\nimpatient, I know, for the conclusion.\n\nYou have hastily perused the preceding lines, and are straining your eye\nforward to my part of the farce; for such it may prove, after all. Well,\nthen, not to play too long with the curiosity which I know to be excited\nand actuated by real friendship, I will relieve it. I think you would\nhave been pleased to have seen my gravity on this important occasion.\nWith all the candor and frankness which I was capable of assuming, I\nthus answered his long harangue, to which I had listened without\ninterrupting him: \"Self-knowledge, sir, that most important of all\nsciences, I have yet to learn. Such have been my situations in life, and\nthe natural volatility of my temper, that I have looked but little into\nmy own heart in regard to its future wishes and views. From a scene of\nconstraint and confinement, ill suited to my years and inclination, I\nhave just launched into society. My heart beats high in expectation of\nits fancied joys. My sanguine imagination paints, in alluring colors,\nthe charms of youth and freedom, regulated by virtue and innocence. Of\nthese I wish to partake. While I own myself under obligations for the\nesteem which you are pleased to profess for me, and, in return,\nacknowledge that neither your person nor manners are disagreeable to me,\nI recoil at the thought of immediately forming a connection which must\nconfine me to the duties of domestic life, and make me dependent for\nhappiness, perhaps, too, for subsistence, upon a class of people who\nwill claim the right of scrutinizing every part of my conduct, and, by\ncensuring those foibles which I am conscious of not having prudence to\navoid, may render me completely miserable. While, therefore, I receive\nyour visits, and cultivate towards you sentiments of friendship and\nesteem, I would not have you consider me as confined to your society, or\nobligated to a future connection. Our short acquaintance renders it\nimpossible for me to decide what the operations of my mind may\nhereafter be. You must either quit the subject, or leave me to the\nexercise of my free will, which, perhaps, may coincide with your present\nwishes.\" \"Madam,\" said he, \"far is the wish from me to restrain your\nperson or mind. In your breast I will repose my cause. It shall be my\nstudy to merit a return of affection; and I doubt not but generosity and\nhonor will influence your conduct towards me. I expect soon to settle\namong a generous and enlightened people, where I flatter myself I shall\nbe exempt from those difficulties and embarrassments to which too many\nof my brethren are subject. The local situation is agreeable, the\nsociety refined and polished; and if, in addition, I may obtain that\nfelicity which you are formed to bestow in a family connection, I shall\nbe happy indeed.\"\n\nHe spoke with emphasis. The tear of sensibility sparkled in his eye. I\ninvoluntarily gave him my hand, which he pressed with ardor to his lips;\nthen, rising, he walked to the window to conceal his emotion. I rang the\nbell and ordered tea, during and after which we shared that social\nconverse which is the true zest of life, and in which I am persuaded\nnone but virtuous minds can participate. General Richman and lady\nreturned with the shades of the evening. The penetrating eye of my\ncousin traced in _our_ countenances the progress of the cause, and the\nsmile of approbation animated _hers_. Mr. Boyer asked the favor of my\ncompany to ride to-morrow morning; which was granted. He tarried to\nsupper, and took his leave. I retired immediately to my chamber, to\nwhich I was followed by Mrs. Richman. I related to her the conversation\nand the encouragement which I had given to Mr. Boyer. She was pleased,\nbut insisted that I should own myself somewhat engaged to him. This, I\ntold her, I should never do to any man before the indissoluble knot was\ntied. \"That,\" said I, \"will be time enough to resign my freedom.\" She\nreplied, that I had wrong ideas of freedom and matrimony; but she hoped\nthat Mr. Boyer would happily rectify them.\n\nI have now, my dear friend, given you an account of my present\nsituation, and leave you to judge for yourself concerning it. Write me\nyour opinion, and believe me ever yours,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XV.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nI congratulate you, my dear Eliza, on the stability of your conduct\ntowards Mr. Boyer. Pursue the system which you have adopted, and I dare\nsay that happiness will crown your future days. You are indeed very\ntenacious of your freedom, as you call it; but that is a play about\nwords. A man of Mr. Boyer's honor and good sense will never abridge any\nprivileges which virtue can claim.\n\nWhen do you return to embellish our society here? I am impatient to see\nyou, and likewise this amiable man. I am much interested in his favor.\nBy the way, I am told that Major Sanford has been to look at the seat of\nCaptain Pribble, which is upon sale. It is reported that he will\nprobably purchase it. Many of our gentry are pleased with the prospect\nof such a neighbor. \"As an accomplished gentleman,\" say they, \"he will\nbe an agreeable addition to our social parties; and as a man of property\nand public spirit, he will be an advantage to the town.\" But from what I\nhave heard of him, I am far from supposing him a desirable acquisition\nin either of these respects. A man of a vicious character cannot be a\ngood member of society. In order to that, his principles and practice\nmust be uncorrupted; in his morals, at least, he must be a man of\nprobity and honor. Of these qualifications, if I mistake not, this\ngallant of yours cannot boast. But I shall not set up for a censor. I\nhope neither you nor I shall have much connection with him. My swain\ninterests himself very much in your affairs. You will possibly think him\nimpertinent; but I give his curiosity a softer name. Should I own to you\nthat I place great confidence in his integrity and honor, you would,\nperhaps, laugh at my weakness; but, my dear, I have pride enough to keep\nme above coquetry or prudery, and discretion enough, I hope, to secure\nme from the errors of both. With him I am determined to walk the future\nround of life. What folly, then, would it be to affect reserve and\ndistance relative to an affair in which I have so much interest! Not\nthat I am going to betray your secrets; these I have no right to\ndivulge; but I must be the judge what may, and what may not, be\ncommunicated. I am very much pressed for an early day of consummation;\nbut I shall not listen to a request of that kind till your return. Such\nis my regard for you, that a union of love would be imperfect if\nfriendship attended not the rites. Adieu.\n\nLUCY FREEMAN.\n\n\nLETTER XVI.\n\nTO MISS LUCY FREEMAN.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nWe go on charmingly here, almost as soft and smooth as your ladyship. It\nseems to me that love must stagnate if it have not a light breeze of\ndiscord once in a while to keep it in motion. We have not tried any yet,\nhowever. We had a lovely tour this forenoon, were out three long hours,\nand returned to dinner in perfect harmony.\n\nMr. Boyer informed me that he should set out to-morrow morning for his\nfuture residence, and soon put on the sacred bands. He solicited an\nepistolary correspondence, at the same time, as an alleviation of the\ncare which that weighty charge would bring on his mind. I consented,\ntelling him that he must not expect any thing more than general subjects\nfrom me.\n\nWe were somewhat interrupted in our confidential intercourse, in the\nafternoon, by the arrival of Major Sanford. I cannot say that I was not\nagreeably relieved. So sweet a repast, for several hours together, was\nrather sickening to my taste. My inamorato looked a little mortified at\nthe cheerful reception which I gave the intruder, and joined not so\nplacidly in the social conversation as I could have wished.\n\nWhen Mr. Boyer, after the major took leave, pressed me to give him some\nassurance of my constancy, I only reminded him of the terms of our\nengagement. Seeing me decided, he was silent on the subject, and soon\nbade me an affectionate adieu, not expecting, as he told me, the\npleasure of a personal interview again for two or three months.\n\nThus far we have proceeded in this sober business. A good beginning, you\nwill say. Perhaps it is. I do not, however, feel myself greatly\ninterested in the progress of the negotiation. Time consolidate my\naffections, and enable me to fix them on some particular object. At\npresent the most lively emotions of my heart are those of friendship,\nthat friendship which I hope you will soon participate with your\nfaithful\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XVII.\n\nTO MR. SELBY.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI have succeeded in my addresses to the lovely Eliza Wharton--as far,\nat least, as I had any reason to expect from our short acquaintance. I\nfind the graces of her person and mind rise in my esteem, and have\nalready enjoyed in her society some of the happiest hours of my life.\nShe is kind, affable, and condescending; yet I must own that I have not\nbeen able to infuse into her bosom the ardor which I feel in my own. I\nknow that the native modesty of the sex would restrain the discovery;\nbut there is an animation of countenance, which betrays the sensations\nof the heart, that I find wanting in hers on this occasion.\n\nI have just taken leave of my fair, and propose returning to-morrow\nmorning to take upon me the solemn charge which lies with such weight\nupon my mind that I need every support, both human and divine. Eliza has\npromised to correspond with me. From this I anticipate a source of\npleasure which alone can atone for her absence.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nJ. BOYER.\n\n\nLETTER XVIII.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nDo you know, Charles, that I have commenced lover? I was always a\ngeneral one, but now I am somewhat particular. I shall be the more\ninterested, as I am likely to meet with difficulties; and it is the\nglory of a rake, as well as of a Christian, to combat obstacles. This\nsame Eliza, of whom I have told you, has really made more impression on\nmy heart than I was aware of, or than the sex, take them as they rise,\nare wont to do. But she is besieged by a priest--a likely lad though. I\nknow not how it is, but they are commonly successful with the girls,\neven the gayest of them. This one, too, has the interest of all her\nfriends, as I am told. I called yesterday at General Richman's, and\nfound this pair together, apparently too happy in each other's society\nfor my wishes. I must own that I felt a glow of jealousy, which I never\nexperienced before, and vowed revenge for the pain it gave me, though\nbut momentary. Yet Eliza's reception of me was visibly cordial; nay, I\nfancied my company as pleasing to her as that which she had before. I\ntarried not long, but left him to the enjoyment of that pleasure which I\nflatter myself will be but shortlived. O, I have another plan in my\nhead--a plan of necessity, which, you know, is the mother of invention.\nIt is this: I am very much courted and caressed by the family of Mr.\nLawrence, a man of large property in this neighborhood. He has only one\nchild--a daughter, with whom I imagine the old folks intend to shackle\nme in the bonds of matrimony. The girl looks very well; she has no soul,\nthough, that I can discover; she is heiress, nevertheless, to a great\nfortune, and that is all the soul I wish for in a wife. In truth,\nCharles, I know of no other way to mend my circumstances. But lisp not a\nword of my embarrassments for your life. Show and equipage are my hobby\nhorse; and if any female wishes to share them with me, and will furnish\nme with the means of supporting them, I have no objection. Could I\nconform to the sober rules of wedded life, and renounce those dear\nenjoyments of dissipation in which I have so long indulged, I know not\nthe lady in the world with whom I would sooner form a connection of this\nsort than with Eliza Wharton. But it will never do. If my fortune or\nhers were better, I would risk a union; but as they are, no idea of the\nkind can be admitted. I shall endeavor, notwithstanding, to enjoy her\ncompany as long as possible. Though I cannot possess her wholly myself,\nI will not tamely see her the property of another.\n\nI am now going to call at General Richman's, in hopes of an opportunity\nto profess my devotion to her. I know I am not a welcome visitor to the\nfamily; but I am independent of their censure or esteem, and mean to act\naccordingly.\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER XIX.\n\nTO MISS LUCY FREEMAN.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI find the ideas of sobriety and domestic solitude I have been\ncultivating for three days past somewhat deranged by the interruption of\na visitor, with whom I know you will not be pleased. It is no other than\nMajor Sanford. I was walking alone in the garden yesterday, when he\nsuddenly appeared to my view. \"How happy am I,\" said he, seizing my\nhand, \"in this opportunity of finding you alone--an opportunity, Miss\nWharton, which I must improve in expatiating on a theme that fills my\nheart and solely animates my frame!\"\n\nI was startled at his impetuosity, and displeased with his freedom.\nWithdrawing my hand, I told him that my retirement was sacred. He bowed\nsubmissively; begged pardon for his intrusion; alleged that he found\nnobody but the servants in the house; that they informed him I was alone\nin the garden--which intelligence was too pleasing for him to consult\nany forms of ceremony for the regulation of his conduct. He then went on\nrhapsodically to declare his passion; his suspicions that I was forming\na connection with Mr. Boyer, which would effectually destroy all his\nhopes of future happiness. He painted the restraint, the confinement,\nthe embarrassments to which a woman connected with a man of Mr. Boyer's\nprofession must be subjected, however agreeable his person might be. He\nasked if my generous mind could submit to cares and perplexities like\nthese; whether I could not find greater sources of enjoyment in a more\nelevated sphere of life, or share pleasures better suited to my genius\nand disposition, even in a single state. I listened to him\ninvoluntarily. My heart did not approve his sentiments; but my ear was\ncharmed with his rhetoric, and my fancy captivated by his address.\n\nHe invited my confidence by the most ardent professions of friendship,\nand labored to remove my suspicions by vows of sincerity. I was induced\nby his importunity gradually to disclose the state of affairs between\nMr. Boyer and myself. He listened eagerly; wished not, he said, to\ninfluence me unduly; but if I were not otherwise engaged, might he\npresume to solicit a place in my friendship and esteem, be admitted to\nenjoy my society, to visit me as an acquaintance, and to attend my\nexcursions and amusements as a brother, if not more? I replied that I\nwas a pensioner of friendship at present; that friends were extremely\nrefined in their notions of propriety; and that I had no right to\nreceive visitants independent of them. \"I understand you, madam,\" said\nhe. \"You intimate that my company is not agreeable to them; but I know\nnot why. Surely my rank in life is as elevated, and my knowledge of and\nacceptance in the world are as extensive, as General Richman's.\" \"I\nhope,\" said I, \"since we are engaged in the conversation, that you will\nexcuse my frankness if I tell you that the understanding and virtue of\nthis worthy couple induce them, without any regard to rank, to bestow\ntheir esteem wherever it is merited. I cannot say that you are not a\nsharer. Your own heart can best determine whether upon their principles\nyou are or not.\" He appeared mortified and chagrined; and we had walked\nsome distance without exchanging a word or a look. At last he rejoined,\n\"I plead guilty to the charge, madam, which they have undoubtedly\nbrought against me, of imprudence and folly in many particulars; yet of\nmalignancy and vice I am innocent. Brought up in affluence, inured from\nmy infancy to the gratification of every passion, the indulgence of\nevery wish, it is not strange that a life of dissipation and gayety\nshould prove alluring to a youthful mind which had no care but to\nprocure what is deemed enjoyment. In this pursuit I have, perhaps,\ndeviated from the rigid rules of discretion and the harsher laws of\nmorality. But let the veil of charity be drawn over my faults; let the\neye of candor impartially examine my present behavior; let the kind and\nlenient hand of friendship assist in directing my future steps; and\nperhaps I may not prove unworthy of associating with the respectable\ninhabitants of this happy mansion; for such I am sure it must be while\nhonored with Miss Wharton's presence. But, circumstanced as you and I\nare at present, I will not sue for your attention as a lover, but rest\ncontented, if possible, with that share of kindness and regard which\nyour benevolence may afford me as a friend.\" I bowed in approbation of\nhis resolution. He pressed my hand with ardor to his lips; and at that\ninstant General Richman entered the garden. He approached us cheerfully,\noffered Major Sanford his hand with apparent cordiality, and told us\npleasantly that he hoped he should not be considered as an intruder. \"By\nno means, sir,\" said Major Sanford; \"it is I who have incurred that\nimputation. I called this afternoon to pay you my respects, when, being\ninformed that you and your lady were abroad, and that Miss Wharton was\nin the garden, I took the liberty to invade her retirement. She has\ngraciously forgiven my crime, and I was just affixing the seal to my\npardon as you entered.\"\n\nWe then returned into the house. Mrs. Richman received us politely.\nDuring tea, the conversation turned on literary subjects, in which I\ncannot say that the major bore a very distinguished part. After he was\ngone, Mrs. Richman said, \"I hope you have been agreeably entertained,\nMiss Wharton.\" \"I did not choose my company, madam,\" said I. \"Nor,\" said\nshe, \"did you refuse it, I presume.\" \"Would you not have me respect the\nrights of hospitality towards your guests when you are absent, madam?\"\n\"If you had acted from that motive, I own my obligations to you, my\ndear; but even that consideration can hardly reconcile me to the\nsacrifice of time which you have made to the amusement of a seducer.\" \"I\nhope, madam, you do not think me an object of seduction.\" \"I do not\nthink you seducible; nor was Richardson's Clarissa till she made herself\nthe victim by her own indiscretion. Pardon me, Eliza--this is a second\nLovelace. I am alarmed by his artful intrusions. His insinuating\nattentions to you are characteristic of the man. Come, I presume you are\nnot interested to keep his secrets if you know them; will you give me a\nlittle sketch of his conversation?\" \"Most willingly,\" said I, and\naccordingly related the whole. When I had concluded, she shook her\nhead, and replied, \"Beware, my friend, of his arts. Your own heart is\ntoo sincere to suspect treachery and dissimulation in another; but\nsuffer not your ear to be charmed by the siren voice of flattery, nor\nyour eye to be caught by the phantom of gayety and pleasure. Remember\nyour engagements to Mr. Boyer. Let sincerity and virtue be your guides,\nand they will lead you to happiness and peace.\" She waited not for an\nanswer, but, immediately rising, begged leave to retire, alleging that\nshe was fatigued. General Richman accompanied her, and I hastened to my\napartment, where I have written thus far, and shall send it on for your\ncomments. I begin to think of returning soon to your circle. One\ninducement is, that I may be free from the intrusions of this man.\nAdieu.\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XX.\n\nTO MRS. M. WHARTON.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nFrom the conversation of the polite, the sedate, the engaging, and the\ngay,--from corresponding with the learned, the sentimental, and the\nrefined,--my heart and my pen turn with ardor and alacrity to a tender\nand affectionate parent, the faithful guardian and guide of my youth,\nthe unchanging friend of my riper years. The different dispositions of\nvarious associates sometimes perplex the mind which seeks direction; but\nin the disinterested affection of the maternal breast we fear no\ndissonance of passion, no jarring interests, no disunion of love. In\nthis seat of felicity is every enjoyment which fancy can form, or\nfriendship, with affluence, bestow; but still my mind frequently returns\nto the happy shades of my nativity. I wish there to impart my pleasures,\nand share the counsels of my best, my long-tried, and experienced\nfriend. At this time, my dear mamma, I am peculiarly solicitous for your\nadvice. I am again importuned to listen to the voice of love; again\ncalled upon to accept the addresses of a gentleman of merit and\nrespectability. You will know the character of the man when I tell you\nit is Mr. Boyer. But his situation in life! I dare not enter it. My\ndisposition is not calculated for that sphere. There are duties arising\nfrom the station which I fear I should not be able to fulfil, cares and\nrestraints to which I could not submit. _This_ man is not disagreeable\nto me; but if I must enter the connubial state, are there not _others_\nwho may be equally pleasing in their persons, and whose profession may\nbe more conformable to my taste? You, madam, have passed through this\nscene of trial with honor and applause. But, alas! can your volatile\ndaughter ever acquire your wisdom--ever possess your resolution,\ndignity, and prudence?\n\nI hope soon to converse with you personally upon the subject, and to\nprofit by your precepts and example. I anticipate the hour of my return\nto your bosom with impatience. My daily thoughts and nightly dreams\nrestore me to the society of my beloved mamma; and, till I enjoy in\nreality, I subscribe myself your dutiful daughter,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XXI.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nHow welcome to me, my dear Eliza, are the tidings of your return! My\nwidowed heart has mourned your absence, and languished for the company\nof its now dearest connection. When stripped of one dependence, the mind\nnaturally collects and rests itself in another. Your father's death\ndeprived me, for a while, of every enjoyment. But a reviving sense of\nthe duties which I owed to a rising family roused me from the lethargy\nof grief. In my cares I found an alleviation of my sorrows. The\nexpanding virtues of my children soothed and exhilarated my drooping\nspirits, and my attention to their education and interest was amply\nrewarded by their proficiency and duty. In them every hope, every\npleasure, now centres. They are the axis on which revolves the temporal\nfelicity of their mother. Judge, then, my dear, how anxiously I must\nwatch, how solicitously I must regard, every circumstance which relates\nto their welfare and prosperity! Exquisitely alive to these sensations,\nyour letter awakens my hopes and my fears. As you are young and\ncharming, a thousand dangers lurk unseen around you. I wish you to find\na friend and protector worthy of being rewarded by your love and your\nsociety. Such a one I think Mr. Boyer will prove. I am, therefore,\nsorry, since there can be no other, that his profession should be an\nobjection in your mind. You say that I have experienced the scenes of\ntrial connected with that station. I have, indeed; and I will tell you\nthe result of this experience. It is, that I have found it replete with\nhappiness. No class of society has domestic enjoyment more at command\nthan clergymen. Their circumstances are generally a decent competency.\nThey are removed alike from the perplexing cares of want and from the\ndistracting parade of wealth. They are respected by all ranks, and\npartakers of the best company. With regard to its being a dependent\nsituation, what one is not so? Are we not all links in the great chain\nof society, some more, some less important, but each upheld by others,\nthroughout the confederated whole? In whatever situation we are placed,\nour greater or less degree of happiness must be derived from ourselves.\nHappiness is in a great measure the result of our own dispositions and\nactions. Let us conduct uprightly and justly; with propriety and\nsteadiness; not servilely cringing for favor, nor arrogantly claiming\nmore attention and respect than our due; let us bear with fortitude the\nprovidential and unavoidable evils of life, and we shall spend our days\nwith respectability and contentment at least.\n\nI will not expatiate on the topic of your letter till we have a personal\ninterview, for which I am indeed impatient. Return, my daughter, as soon\nas politeness will allow, to your expecting friends; more especially to\nthe fond embraces of your affectionate mother.\n\nM. WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XXII.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nHAMPSHIRE.\n\nCan time, can distance, can absence allay or extinguish the sentiments\nof refined affection, the ardor of true love? No, my dear Eliza. If I\nmay judge by my own heart, I shall say they cannot. Amidst the parade\nwhich has attended me, the interesting scenes in which I have been\nengaged, and the weighty cares which have occupied my attention, your\nidea has been the solace of my retired moments, the soother of every\nanxious thought. I recall with pleasure the conversation which we have\nshared. I dwell with rapture on the marks of favor which I have received\nfrom you. My first wish is the continuance and increase of these favors;\nmy highest ambition, to deserve them. I look forward and anticipate with\nimpatience the future enjoyment of your society, and hope we shall one\nday experience the reality of those beautiful lines of Thomson:--\n\n        \"--an elegant sufficiency,\n  Content, retirement, rural quiet, friendship,\n  Books, ease, and alternate labor; useful life,\n  Progressive virtue, and approving Heaven;\n  These are the matchless joys of virtuous love.\n\nMr. Selby, my particular friend, will have the honor of delivering this\nletter. He will be able to give you any information, relative to our\npublic transactions, which you may wish. May I solicit the favor of a\nline, through him, in return? It will relieve, in some measure, the\ntediousness of this separation. I intend to pay my respects to you\npersonally in about a fortnight; till when I subscribe myself your\nsincere and affectionate friend,\n\nJ. BOYER.\n\n\nLETTER XXIII.\n\nTO THE REV. J. BOYER.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI have executed your commission, and been amply rewarded for my trouble\nby the pleasures I enjoyed in the society of the agreeable family to\nwhich I was introduced; especially of the amiable and accomplished lady\nwho is the object of your particular regard. I think she fully justifies\nyour partiality to her. She appears to possess both the virtues and the\ngraces. Her form is fine, and her countenance interests us at once in\nher favor. There is a mixture of dignity and ease which commands respect\nand conciliates affection. After these encomiums, will you permit me to\nsay there is an air of gayety in her appearance and deportment which\nsavors a little of coquetry? I am persuaded, however, that she has too\nmuch good sense to practise its arts. She received your letter very\ngraciously, asked leave to retire a few moments, and returned with a\nsmile of complacency on her brow, which I construe favorably to you.\n\nThere was a Mr. Lawrence, with his lady and daughter, and a certain\nMajor Sanford, at the house. The latter, I believe, in the modern sense\nof the phrase, _is much of a gentleman_; that is, a man of show and\nfashion.\n\nMiss Wharton asked me when I should leave town, and when I should\nreturn, or have an opportunity of conveyance to Hampshire. I told her I\nshould write by the next post, and, if she had any commands, would be\nhappy to execute them. She would send a line to her friend, she said, if\nI would take the trouble to enclose it in my letter. I readily\nconsented, and told her that I would call and receive her favor\nto-morrow morning. This chitchat was a little aside; but I could not but\nobserve that the aforesaid Major Sanford had dropped his part in the\nconversation of the rest of the company, and was attending to us, though\nhe endeavored to conceal his attention by looking carelessly over a\nplay which lay on the window by him. Yet he evidently watched every word\nand action of Miss Wharton, as if he were really interested in her\nmovements.\n\nIt is said she has many admirers, and I conceive it very possible that\nthis may be one of them; though, truly, I do not think that she would\nesteem such a conquest any great honor. I now joined in the general\ntopic of conversation, which was politics; Mrs. Richman and Miss Wharton\njudiciously, yet modestly, bore a part; while the other ladies amused\nthemselves with Major Sanford, who was making his sage remarks on the\nplay, which he still kept in his hand. General Richman at length\nobserved that we had formed into parties. Major Sanford, upon, this,\nlaid aside his book. Miss Lawrence simpered, and looked as if she was\nwell pleased with being in a party with so fine a man; while her mother\nreplied that she never meddled with politics. \"Miss Wharton and I,\" said\nMrs. Richman, \"must beg leave to differ from you, madam. We think\nourselves interested in the welfare and prosperity of our country; and,\nconsequently, claim the right of inquiring into those affairs which may\nconduce to or interfere with the common weal. We shall not be called to\nthe senate or the field to assert its privileges and defend its rights,\nbut we shall feel, for the honor and safety of our friends and\nconnections who are thus employed. If the community flourish and enjoy\nhealth and freedom, shall we not share in the happy effects? If it be\noppressed and disturbed, shall we not endure our proportion of the evil?\nWhy, then, should the love of our country be a masculine passion only?\nWhy should government, which involves the peace and order of the society\nof which we are a part, be wholly excluded from our observation?\" Mrs.\nLawrence made some slight reply, and waived the subject. The gentlemen\napplauded Mrs. Richman's sentiments as truly Roman, and, what was more,\nthey said, truly republican.\n\nI rose to take leave, observing to Miss Wharton that I should call\nto-morrow, as agreed. Upon this, General Richman politely requested the\nfavor of my company at dinner. I accepted his invitation, and bade them\ngood night. I shall do the same to you for the present, as I intend,\nto-morrow, to scribble the cover, which is to enclose your Eliza's\nletter.\n\nT. SELBY.\n\n\nLETTER XXIV.\n\nTO THE REV. J. BOYER.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI resume my pen, having just returned from General Richman's; not with\nan expectation, however, of your reading this till you have perused and\nreperused the enclosed. I can bear such neglect in this case, as I have\nbeen alike interested myself.\n\nI went to General Richman's at twelve o'clock. About a mile from thence,\nupon turning a corner, I observed a gentleman and lady on horseback,\nsome way before me, riding at a very moderate pace, and seemingly in\nclose conversation. I kept at the same distance from them till I saw\nthem stop at the general's gate. I then put on, and, coming up with them\njust as they alighted, was surprised to find them no other than Major\nSanford and Miss Wharton. They were both a little disconcerted at my\nsalutation: I know not why. Miss Wharton invited him in; but he\ndeclined, being engaged to dine. General Richman received us at the\ndoor. As I handed Miss Wharton in, he observed, jocosely, that she had\nchanged company. \"Yes, sir,\" she replied, \"more than once since I went\nout, as you doubtless observed.\" \"I was not aware,\" said Mrs. Richman,\n\"that Major Sanford was to be of your party to-day.\" \"It was quite\naccidental, madam,\" said Miss Wharton. \"Miss Lawrence and I had agreed,\nlast evening, to take a little airing this forenoon. A young gentleman,\na relation of hers, who is making them a visit, was to attend us.\n\n\"We had not rode more than two miles when we were overtaken by Major\nSanford, who very politely asked leave to join our party. Miss Lawrence\nvery readily consented; and we had a very sociable ride. The fineness of\nthe day induced me to protract the enjoyment of it abroad; but Miss\nLawrence declined riding so far as I proposed, as she had engaged\ncompany to dine. We therefore parted till the evening, when we are to\nmeet again.\" \"What, another engagement!\" said Mrs. Richman. \"Only to\nthe assembly, madam.\" \"May I inquire after your gallant, my dear? But I\nhave no right, perhaps, to be inquisitive,\" said Mrs. Richman. Miss\nWharton made no reply, and the conversation took a general turn. Miss\nWharton sustained her part with great propriety. Indeed, she discovers a\nfund of useful knowledge and extensive reading, which render her\npeculiarly entertaining; while the brilliancy of her wit, the fluency of\nher language, the vivacity and ease of her manners are inexpressibly\nengaging. I am going myself to the assembly this evening, though I did\nnot mention it to General Richman. I therefore took my leave soon after\ndinner.\n\nI have heard so much in praise of Miss Wharton's penmanship, in\naddition to her other endowments, that I am almost tempted to break the\nseal of her letter to you; but I forbear. Wishing you much happiness in\nthe perusal of it, and more in the possession of its writer, I subscribe\nmyself yours, &c.,\n\nT. SELBY.\n\n\nLETTER XXV.\n\nTO THE REV. J. BOYER.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nSir: Your favor of the 4th instant came to hand yesterday. I received it\nwith pleasure, and embrace this early opportunity of contributing my\npart to a correspondence tending to promote a friendly and social\nintercourse. An epistolary communication between the sexes has been with\nsome a subject of satire and censure; but unjustly, in my opinion. With\npersons of refinement and information, it may be a source of\nentertainment and utility. The knowledge and masculine virtues of your\nsex may be softened and rendered more diffusive by the inquisitiveness,\nvivacity, and docility of ours, drawn forth and exercised by each\nother.\n\nIn regard to the _particular_ subject of yours, I shall be silent. Ideas\nof that kind are better conveyed, on my part, by words than by the pen.\n\nI congratulate you on your agreeable settlement, and hope it will be\nproductive of real and lasting happiness. I am convinced that felicity\nis not confined to any particular station or condition in life; yet,\nmethinks, some are better calculated to afford it to me than others.\n\nYour extract from a favorite poet is charmingly descriptive; but is it\nnot difficult to ascertain what we can pronounce \"an elegant\nsufficiency\"? Perhaps you will answer, as some others have done, we can\nattain it by circumscribing our wishes within the compass of our\nabilities. I am not very avaricious; yet I must own that I should like\nto enjoy it without so much trouble as that would cost me.\n\nExcuse my seeming levity. You have flattered my cheerfulness by\ncommending it, and must, therefore, indulge me in the exercise of it. I\ncannot conveniently be at the pains of restraining its sallies when I\nwrite in confidence.\n\nIs a sprightly disposition, in your view, indicative of a giddy mind\nor an innocent heart? Of the latter, I presume; for I know you are not a\nmisanthrope.\n\nWe expect the pleasure of Mr. Selby's company to dinner. You are\ncertainly under obligations to his friendship for the liberal encomiums\nhe bestowed on you and your prospects yesterday. Mrs. Richman rallied\nme, after he was gone, on my listening ear. The general and she unite in\nrequesting me to present their respects.\n\nWishing you health and happiness, I subscribe myself your friend,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XXVI.\n\nTO MISS LUCY FREEMAN.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI am perplexed and embarrassed, my friend, by the assiduous attentions\nof this Major Sanford. I shall write circumstantially and frankly to\nyou, that I may have the benefit of your advice. He came here last\nMonday in company with Mr. Lawrence, his wife, and daughter, to make us\na visit. While they were present, a Mr. Selby, a particular friend of\nMr. Boyer, came in, and delivered me a letter from him. I was really\nhappy in the reception of this proof of his affection. His friend gave a\nvery flattering account of his situation and prospects.\n\nThe watchful eye of Major Sanford traced every word and action\nrespecting Mr. Boyer with an attention which seemed to border on\nanxiety. That, however, did not restrain, but rather accelerated, my\nvivacity and inquisitiveness on the subject; for I wished to know\nwhether it would produce any real effect upon him or not.\n\nAfter Mr. Selby's departure, he appeared pensive and thoughtful the\nremainder of the evening, and evidently sought an opportunity of\nspeaking to me aside, which I studiously avoided. Miss Lawrence and I\nformed an engagement to take an airing in the morning on horseback,\nattended by a relation of hers who is now with them. They called for me\nabout ten, when we immediately set out upon our preconcerted excursion.\nWe had not proceeded far before we were met by Major Sanford. He was\nextremely polite, and finding our destination was not particular, begged\nleave to join our party. This was granted; and we had an agreeable tour\nfor several miles, the time being passed in easy and unstudied remarks\nupon obvious occurrences. Major Sanford could not, however, conceal his\nparticular attention to me, which rather nettled Miss Lawrence. She grew\nsomewhat serious, and declined riding so far as we had intended,\nalleging that she expected company to dine.\n\nMajor Sanford, understanding that she was going to the assembly in the\nevening with Mr. Gordon, solicited me to accept a ticket, and form a\nparty with them. The entertainment was alluring, and I consented. When\nwe had parted with Miss Lawrence, Major Sanford insisted on my riding a\nlittle farther, saying he must converse with me on a particular subject,\nand if I refused him this opportunity, that he must visit me at my\nresidence, let it offend whom it would. I yielded to his importunity,\nand we rode on. He then told me that his mind was in a state of suspense\nand agitation which was very painful to bear, and which I only could\nrelieve; that my cheerful reception of Mr. Boyer's letter yesterday, and\ndeportment respecting him, had awakened in his breast all the pangs of\njealousy which the most ardent love could feel; that my treatment of Mr.\nBoyer's friend convinced him that I was more interested in his affairs\nthan I was willing to own; that he foresaw himself to be condemned to an\neternal separation, and the total loss of my favor and society, as soon\nas time and circumstances would allow.\n\nHis zeal, his pathos, alarmed me. I begged him to be calm. \"To you,\"\nsaid I, \"as a friend, I have intrusted my situation in relation to Mr.\nBoyer. You know that I am under no special obligation to him, and I do\nnot intend to form any immediate connection.\" \"Mr. Boyer must have\ndifferent ideas, madam; and he has reason for them, if I may judge by\nappearances. When do you expect another visit from him?\" \"In about a\nfortnight.\" \"And is my fate to be then decided? and so decided, as I\nfear it will be, through the influence of your friends, if not by your\nown inclination?\" \"My friends, sir, will not control, they will only\nadvise to what they think most for my interest, and I hope that my\nconduct will not be unworthy of their approbation.\" \"Pardon me, my dear\nEliza,\" said he, \"if I am impertinent; it is my regard for you which\nimpels me to the presumption. Do you intend to give your hand to Mr.\nBoyer?\" \"I do not intend to give my hand to any man at present. I have\nbut lately entered society, and wish, for a while, to enjoy my freedom\nin the participation of pleasures suited to my age and sex.\" \"These,\"\nsaid he, \"you are aware, I suppose, when you form a connection with that\nman, you must renounce, and content yourself with a confinement to the\ntedious round of domestic duties, the pedantic conversation of\nscholars, and the invidious criticisms of a whole town.\" \"I have been\naccustomed,\" said I, \"and am therefore attached, to men of letters; and\nas to the praise or censure of the populace, I hope always to enjoy that\napprobation of conscience which will render me superior to both. But you\nforget your promise not to talk in this style, and have deviated far\nfrom the character of a friend and brother, with, which you consented to\nrest satisfied.\" \"Yes; but I find myself unequal to the task. I am not\nstoic enough tamely to make so great a sacrifice. I must plead for an\ninterest in your favor till you banish me from your presence, and tell\nme plainly that you hate me.\" We had by this time reached the gate, and\nas we dismounted, were unexpectedly accosted by Mr. Selby, who had come,\nagreeably to promise, to dine with us, and receive my letter to Mr.\nBoyer.\n\nMajor Sanford took his leave as General Richman appeared at the door.\nThe general and his lady rallied me on my change of company, but very\nprudently concealed their sentiments of Major Sanford while Mr. Selby\nwas present. Nothing material occurred before and during dinner, soon\nafter which Mr. Selby went away. I retired to dress for the assembly,\nand had nearly completed the labor of the toilet when Mrs. Richman\nentered. \"My friendship for you, my dear Eliza,\" said she, \"interests\nme so much in your affairs that I cannot repress my curiosity to know\nwho has the honor of your hand this evening.\" \"If it be any honor,\" said\nI, \"it will be conferred on Major Sanford.\" \"I think it far too great to\nbe thus bestowed,\" returned she. \"It is perfectly astonishing to me that\nthe virtuous part of my sex will countenance, caress, and encourage\nthose men whose profession it is to blast their reputation, destroy\ntheir peace, and triumph in their infamy.\" \"Is this, madam, the avowed\ndesign of Major Sanford?\" \"I know not what he avows, but his practice\ntoo plainly bespeaks his principles and views.\" \"Does he now practise\nthe arts you mention? or do you refer to past follies?\" \"I cannot answer\nfor his present conduct; his past has established his character.\" \"You,\nmadam, are an advocate for charity; that, perhaps, if exercised in this\ninstance, might lead you to think it possible for him to reform, to\nbecome a valuable member of society, and, when connected with a lady of\nvirtue and refinement, to be capable of making a good husband.\" \"I\ncannot conceive that such a lady would be willing to risk her all upon\nthe slender prospect of his reformation. I hope the one with whom I am\nconversing has no inclination to so hazardous an experiment.\" \"Why, not\nmuch.\" \"Not much! If you have any, why do you continue to encourage Mr.\nBoyer's addresses?\" \"I am not sufficiently acquainted with either, yet,\nto determine which to take. At present, I shall not confine myself in\nany way. In regard to these men, my fancy and my judgment are in scales;\nsometimes one preponderates, sometimes the other; which will finally\nprevail, time alone can reveal.\" \"O my cousin, beware of the delusions\nof fancy! Reason must be our guide if we would expect durable\nhappiness.\" At this instant a servant opened the door, and told me that\nMajor Sanford waited in the parlor. Being ready, I wished Mrs. Richman a\ngood evening, and went down. Neither General Richman nor his lady\nappeared. He therefore handed me immediately into his phaeton, and we\nwere soon in the assembly room.\n\nI was surprised, on my entrance, to find Mr. Selby there, as he did not\nmention, at dinner, his intention of going. He attached himself to our\nparty, and, in the intervals of dancing, took every opportunity of\nconversing with me. These, however, were not many; for Major Sanford\nassiduously precluded the possibility of my being much engaged by any\none else. We passed the evening very agreeably; but the major's\nimportunity was rather troublesome as we returned home. He insisted upon\nmy declaring whether Mr. Boyer really possessed my affections, and\nwhether I intended to confer myself on him or not. \"If,\" said he, \"you\nanswer me in the affirmative, I must despair; but if you have not\nabsolutely decided against me, I will still hope that my persevering\nassiduity, my faithful love, may at last be rewarded.\" I told him that I\nwas under no obligation to give him any account of my disposition\ntowards another, and that he must remember the terms of our present\nassociation to which he had subscribed. I therefore begged him to waive\nthe subject now, if not forever. He asked my pardon, if he had been\nimpertinent, but desired leave to renew his request that I would receive\nhis visits, his friendly visits. I replied that I could not grant this,\nand that he must blame himself, not me, if he was an unwelcome guest at\nGeneral Richman's. He lamented the prejudices which my friends had\nimbibed against him, but flattered himself that I was more liberal than\nto be influenced by them without any positive proof of demerit, as it\nwas impossible that his conduct towards me should ever deviate from the\nstrictest rules of honor and love.\n\nWhat shall I say now, my friend? This man to an agreeable person has\nsuperadded graceful manners, an amiable temper, and a fortune sufficient\nto insure the enjoyments of all the pleasing varieties of social life.\nPerhaps a gay disposition and a lax education may have betrayed him into\nsome scenes of dissipation. But is it not an adage generally received,\nthat \"_a reformed rake makes the best husband_\"? My fancy leads me for\nhappiness to the festive haunts of fashionable life. I am at present,\nand know not but I ever shall be, too volatile for a confinement to\ndomestic avocations and sedentary pleasures. I dare not, therefore,\nplace myself in a situation where these must be indispensable. Mr.\nBoyer's person and character are agreeable. I really esteem the man. My\nreason and judgment, as I have observed before, declare for a connection\nwith him, as a state of tranquillity and rational happiness. But the\nidea of relinquishing those delightful amusements and flattering\nattentions which wealth and equipage bestow is painful. Why were not the\nvirtues of the one and the graces and affluence of the other combined? I\nshould then have been happy indeed. But, as the case now stands, I am\nloath to give up either; being doubtful which will conduce most to my\nfelicity.\n\nPray write me impartially; let me know your real sentiments, for I rely\ngreatly upon your opinion. I am, &c.,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XXVII.\n\nTO THE REV. MR. BOYER.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI am quite a convert to Pope's assertion, that\n\n  \"Every woman is at heart a rake.\"\n\nHow else can we account for the pleasure which they evidently receive\nfrom the society, the flattery, the caresses of men of that character?\nEven the most virtuous of them seem naturally prone to gayety, to\npleasure, and, I had almost said, to dissipation. How else shall we\naccount for the existence of this disposition in your favorite fair? It\ncannot be the result of her education. Such a one as she has received is\ncalculated to give her a very different turn of mind. You must forgive\nme, my friend, for I am a little vexed and alarmed on your-account. I\nwent last evening to the assembly, as I told you in my last that I\nintended. I was purposely without a partner, that I might have the\nliberty to exercise my gallantry as circumstances should invite. Indeed\nI must own that my particular design was to observe Miss Wharton's\nmovements, being rather inclined to jealousy in your behalf. She was\nhanded into the assembly room by Major Sanford. The brilliance of their\nappearance, the levity of their manners, and the contrast of their\ncharacters I found to be a general subject of speculation. I endeavored\nto associate with Miss Wharton, but found it impossible to detach her a\nmoment from the coxcomb who attended her. If she has any idea of a\nconnection with you, why does she continue to associate with another,\nespecially with one of so opposite a description? I am seriously afraid\nthat there is more intimacy between them than there ought to be,\nconsidering the encouragement she has given you.\n\nI hope you will not be offended by my freedom in this matter. It\noriginates in a concern for your honor and future happiness. I am\nanxious lest you should be made the dupe of a coquette, and your peace\nof mind fall a sacrifice to an artful debauchee. Yet I must believe that\nMiss Wharton has, in reality, all that virtue and good sense of which\nshe enjoys the reputation; but her present conduct is mysterious.\n\nI have said enough (more than I ought, perhaps) to awaken your attention\nto circumstances which _may_ lead to important events. If they appear of\nlittle or no consequence to you, you will at least ascribe the mention\nof them to motives of sincere regard in your friend and humble servant,\n\nT. SELBY.\n\n\nLETTER XXVIII.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI go on finely with my amour. I have every encouragement that I could\nwish. Indeed my fair one does not verbally declare in my favor; but\nthen, according to the vulgar proverb, that \"_actions speak louder than\nwords,_\" I have no reason to complain; since she evidently approves my\ngallantry, is pleased with my company, and listens to my flattery. Her\nsagacious friends have undoubtedly given her a detail of my vices. If,\ntherefore, my past conduct has been repugnant to her notions of\npropriety, why does she not act consistently, and refuse at once to\nassociate with a man whose character she cannot esteem? But no; that,\nCharles, is no part of the female plan; our entrapping a few of their\nsex only discovers the gayety of our dispositions, the insinuating\ngraces of our manners, and the irresistible charms of our persons and\naddress. These qualifications are very alluring to the sprightly fancy\nof the fair. They think to enjoy the pleasures which result from this\nsource, while their vanity and ignorance prompt each one to imagine\nherself superior to delusion, and to anticipate the honor of reclaiming\nthe libertine and reforming the rake. I don't know, however, but this\ngirl will really have that merit with me; for I am so much attached to\nher that I begin to suspect I should sooner become a convert to sobriety\nthan lose her. I cannot find that I have made much impression on her\nheart as yet. Want of success in this point mortifies me extremely, as\nit is the first time I ever failed. Besides, I am apprehensive that she\nis prepossessed in favor of the other swain, the clerical lover, whom I\nhave mentioned to you before. The chord, therefore, upon which I play\nthe most, is the dissimilarity of their dispositions and pleasures. I\nendeavor to detach her from him, and disaffect her towards him; knowing\nthat, if I can separate them entirely, I shall be more likely to succeed\nin my plan. Not that I have any thoughts of marrying her myself; that\nwill not do at present. But I love her too well to see her connected\nwith another for life. I must own myself a little revengeful, too, in\nthis affair. I wish to punish her friends, as she calls them, for their\nmalice towards me, for their cold and negligent treatment of me whenever\nI go to the house. I know that to frustrate their designs of a\nconnection between Mr. Boyer and Eliza would be a grievous\ndisappointment. I have not yet determined to seduce her, though, with\nall her pretensions to virtue, I do not think it impossible. And if I\nshould, she can blame none but herself, since she knows my character,\nand has no reason to wonder if I act consistently with it. If she will\nplay with a lion, let her beware of his paw, I say. At present, I wish\ninnocently to enjoy her society; it is a luxury which I never tasted\nbefore. She is the very soul of pleasure. The gayest circle is\nirradiated by her presence, and the highest entertainment receives its\ngreatest charms from her smiles. Besides, I have purchased the seat of\nCaptain Pribble, about a mile from her mother's; and can I think of\nsuffering her to leave the neighborhood just as I enter it? I shall\nexert every nerve to prevent that, and hope to meet with the usual\nsuccess of\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER XXIX.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nYou desire me to write to you, my friend; but if you had not, I should\nby no means have refrained. I tremble at the precipice on which you\nstand, and must echo and re\u00c3\u00abcho the seasonable admonition of the\nexcellent Mrs. Richman, \"Beware of the delusions of fancy.\" You are\nstrangely infatuated by them! Let not the magic arts of that worthless\nSanford lead you, like an _ignis fatuus_, from the path of rectitude and\nvirtue.\n\nI do not find, in all your conversations with him, that one word about\nmarriage drops from his lips. This is mysterious. No, it is\ncharacteristic of the man. Suppose, however, that his views are\nhonorable; yet what can you expect, what can you promise yourself, from\nsuch a connection? \"A reformed rake,\" you say, \"makes the best\nhusband\"--a trite, but a very erroneous maxim, as the fatal experience\nof thousands of our sex can testify. In the first place, I believe that\nrakes very seldom _do_ reform while their fortunes and constitutions\nenable them to pursue their licentious pleasures. But even allowing this\nto happen; can a woman of refinement and delicacy enjoy the society of a\nman whose mind has been corrupted, whose taste has been vitiated, and\nwho has contracted a depravity, both of sentiment and manners, which no\ndegree of repentance can wholly efface? Besides, of true love they are\nabsolutely incapable. Their passions have been much too hackneyed to\nadmit so pure a flame. You cannot anticipate sincere and lasting respect\nfrom them. They have been so long accustomed to the company of those of\nour sex who deserve no esteem, that the greatest dignity and purity of\ncharacter can never excite it in their breasts. They are naturally prone\nto jealousy. Habituated to an intercourse with the baser part of the\nsex, they level the whole, and seldom believe any to be incorruptible.\nThey are always hardhearted and cruel. How else could they triumph in\nthe miseries which they frequently occasion? Their specious manners may\nrender them agreeable companions abroad, but at home the evil\npropensities of their minds will invariably predominate. They are\nsteeled against the tender affections which render domestic life\ndelightful; strangers to the kind, the endearing sympathies of husband,\nfather, and friend. The thousand nameless attentions which soften the\nrugged path of life are neglected, and deemed unworthy of notice, by\npersons who have been inured to scenes of dissipation and debauchery.\nAnd is a man of this description to be the partner, the companion, the\nbosom friend of my Eliza? Forbid it, Heaven! Let not the noble qualities\nso lavishly bestowed upon her be thus unworthily sacrificed!\n\nYou seem to be particularly charmed with the fortune of Major Sanford,\nwith the gayety of his appearance, with the splendor of his equipage,\nwith the politeness of his manners, with what you call the graces of\nhis person. These, alas! are superficial, insnaring endowments. As to\nfortune, prudence, economy, and regularity are necessary to preserve it\nwhen possessed. Of these Major Sanford is certainly destitute--unless\ncommon fame (which more frequently tells the truth than some are willing\nto allow) does him great injustice. As to external parade, it will not\nsatisfy the rational mind when it aspires to those substantial pleasures\nfor which yours is formed. And as to the graces of person and manners,\nthey are but a wretched substitute for those virtues which adorn and\ndignify human life. Can you, who have always been used to serenity and\norder in a family, to rational, refined, and improving conversation,\nrelinquish them, and launch into the whirlpool of frivolity, where the\ncorrect taste and the delicate sensibility which you possess must\nconstantly be wounded by the frothy and illiberal sallies of licentious\nwit?\n\nThis, my dear, is but a faint picture of the situation to which you seem\ninclined. Reverse the scene, and you will perceive the alternative which\nis submitted to your option in a virtuous connection with Mr. Boyer.\nRemember that you are acting for life, and that your happiness in this\nworld, perhaps in the next, depends on your present choice.\n\nI called last evening to see your mamma. She is fondly anticipating\nyour return, and rejoicing in the prospect of your agreeable and speedy\nsettlement. I could not find it in my heart to distress her by\nintimating that you had other views. I wish her benevolent bosom\nnevermore to feel the pangs of disappointed hope.\n\nI am busily engaged in preparing for my nuptials. The solemn words, \"As\nlong as ye both shall live,\" render me thoughtful and serious. I hope\nfor your enlivening presence soon, which will prove a seasonable cordial\nto the spirits of your\n\nLUCY FREEMAN.\n\n\nLETTER XXX.\n\nTO MISS LUCY FREEMAN.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI believe your spirits need a cordial indeed, my dear Lucy, after\ndrawing so dreadful a portrait of my swain. But I call him mine no\nlonger. I renounce him entirely. My friends shall be gratified; and if\ntheir predictions are verified, I shall be happy in a union with a man\nof their choice. General Richman and lady have labored abundantly to\nprove that my ruin was inevitable if I did not immediately break all\nintercourse with Major Sanford. I promised a compliance with their\nwishes, and have accomplished the task, though a hard one I found it.\nLast Thursday he was here, and desired leave to spend an hour with me. I\nreadily consented, assuring my friends it should be the last hour which\nI would ever spend in his company.\n\nHe told me that he was obliged to leave town for a few days; and as I\nshould probably see Mr. Boyer before his return, he could not depart in\npeace without once more endeavoring to interest me in his favor, to\nobtain some token of esteem, some glimpse of hope that I would not\nutterly reject him, to support him in his absence. I thanked him for the\npolite attention he had paid me since our acquaintance, told him that I\nshould ever retain a grateful sense of his partiality to me, that he\nwould ever share my best wishes, but that all connection of the kind to\nwhich he alluded must from that time forever cease.\n\nHe exerted all his eloquence to obtain a retraction of that sentence,\nand ran with the greatest volubility through all the protestations,\nprayers, entreaties, professions, and assurances which love could feel\nor art contrive. I had resolution, however, to resist them, and to\ncommand my own emotions on the occasion better than my natural\nsensibility gave me reason to expect.\n\nFinding every effort vain, he rose precipitately, and bade me adieu. I\nurged his tarrying to tea; but he declined, saying that he must retire\nto his chamber, being, in his present state of mind, unfit for any\nsociety, as he was banished from mine. I offered him my hand, which he\npressed with ardor to his lips, and, bowing in silence, left the room.\n\nThus terminated this affair--an affair which, perhaps, was only the\neffect of mere gallantry on his part, and of unmeaning pleasantry on\nmine, and which, I am sorry to say, has given my friends so much anxiety\nand concern. I am under obligations to them for their kind solicitude,\nhowever causeless it may have been.\n\nAs an agreeable companion, as a polite and finished gallant, Major\nSanford is all that the most lively fancy could wish. And as you have\nalways affirmed that I was a little inclined to coquetry, can you wonder\nat my exercising it upon so happy a subject? Besides, when I thought\nmore seriously, his liberal fortune was extremely alluring to me, who,\nyou know, have been hitherto confined to the rigid rules of prudence and\neconomy, not to say necessity, in my finances.\n\nMiss Lawrence called on me yesterday, as she was taking the air, and\nasked me whether Major Sanford took leave of me when he left town. \"He\nwas here last week,\" said I, \"but I did not know that he was gone away.\"\n\"O, yes,\" she replied, \"he is gone to take possession of his seat which\nhe has lately purchased of Captain Pribble. I am told it is superb; and\nit ought to be, if it has the honor of his residence.\" \"Then you have a\ngreat opinion of Major Sanford,\" said I. \"Certainly; and has not every\nbody else?\" said she. \"I am sure he is a very fine gentleman.\" Mrs.\nRichman smiled rather contemptuously, and I changed the subject. I\nbelieve that the innocent heart of this simple girl is a little taken\nin.\n\nI have just received a letter from Mr. Boyer in the usual style. He\nexpects the superlative happiness of kissing my hand next week. O, dear!\nI believe I must begin to fix my phiz. Let me run to the glass, and try\nif I can make up one that will look _madamish_. Yes, I succeeded very\nwell.\n\nI congratulate you on your new neighbor; but I advise friend George to\nhave the Gordian knot tied immediately, lest you should be insnared by\nthis bewitching squire.\n\nI have been trying to seduce General Richman to accompany me to the\nassembly this evening, but cannot prevail. Were Mrs. Richman able to go\nwith us, he would be very happy to wait on us together; but, to tell the\ntruth, he had rather enjoy her company at home than any which is to be\nfound abroad. I rallied him on his old-fashioned taste, but my heart\napproved and applauded his attachment. I despise the married man or\nwoman who harbors an inclination to partake of separate pleasures.\n\nI am told that a servant man inquires for me below--the messenger of\nsome enamoured swain, I suppose. I will step down and learn what message\nhe brings.\n\nNothing extraordinary; it is only a card of compliments from a Mr.\nEmmons, a respectable merchant of this city, requesting the honor to\nwait on me to the assembly this evening--a welcome request, which I made\nno hesitation to grant. If I must resign these favorite amusements, let\nme enjoy as large a share as possible till the time arrives. I must\nrepair to the toilet, and adorn for a new conquest the person of\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XXXI.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nI am very happy to find you are in so good spirits, Eliza, after parting\nwith your favorite swain; for I perceive that he is really the favorite\nof your fancy, though your heart cannot esteem him; and, independent of\nthat, no sensations can be durable.\n\nI can tell you some news of this strange man. He has arrived, and taken\npossession of his seat. Having given general invitations, he has been\ncalled upon and welcomed by most of the neighboring gentry. Yesterday he\nmade an elegant entertainment. Friend George (as you call him) and I\nwere of the number who had cards. Twenty-one couple went, I am told. We\ndid not go. I consider my time too valuable to be spent in cultivating\nacquaintance with a person from whom neither pleasure nor improvement is\nto be expected. His profuseness may bribe the unthinking multitude to\nshow him respect; but he must know that, though\n\n  \"Places and honors have been bought for gold,\n  Esteem and love were never to be sold.\"\n\nI look upon the vicious habits and abandoned character of Major Sanford\nto have more pernicious effects on society than the perpetrations of the\nrobber and the assassin. These, when detected, are rigidly punished by\nthe laws of the land. If their lives be spared, they are shunned by\nsociety, and treated with every mark of disapprobation and contempt.\nBut, to the disgrace of humanity and virtue, the assassin of honor, the\nwretch who breaks the peace of families, who robs virgin innocence of\nits charms, who triumphs over the ill-placed confidence of the\ninexperienced, unsuspecting, and too credulous fair, is received and\ncaressed, not only by his own sex, to which he is a reproach, but even\nby ours, who have every conceivable reason to despise and avoid him.\nInfluenced by these principles, I am neither ashamed nor afraid openly\nto avow my sentiments of this man, and my reasons for treating him with\nthe most pointed neglect.\n\nI write warmly on the subject; for it is a subject in which I think the\nhonor and happiness of my sex concerned. I wish they would more\ngenerally espouse their own cause. It would conduce to the public, weal,\nand to their personal respectability. I rejoice, heartily, that you have\nhad resolution to resist his allurements, to detect and repel his\nartifices. Resolution in such a case is absolutely necessary; for,\n\n  \"In spite of all the virtue we can boast,\n  The woman that deliberates is lost.\"\n\nAs I was riding out yesterday I met your mamma. She wondered that I was\nnot one of the party at our new neighbor's. \"The reason, madam,\" said I,\n\"is, that I do not like the character of the man.\" \"I know nothing of\nhim,\" said she; \"he is quite a stranger to me, only as he called at my\nhouse last week to pay me his respects, as he said, for the sake of my\nlate husband, whose memory he revered, and because I was the mother of\nMiss Eliza Wharton, with whom he had the honor of some little\nacquaintance. His manners are engaging, and I am sorry to hear that his\nmorals are corrupt.\"\n\nThis, my dear, is a very extraordinary visit. I fear that he has not yet\nlaid aside his arts. Be still on your guard, is the advice of your\nsincere and faithful friend,\n\nLUCY FREEMAN.\n\n\nLETTER XXXII.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nI am really banished and rejected--desired nevermore to think of the\ngirl I love with a view of indulging that love or of rendering it\nacceptable to its object. You will perhaps dispute the propriety of the\nterm, and tell me it is not love--it is only gallantry, and a desire to\nexercise it with her as a favorite nymph. I neither know nor care by\nwhat appellation you distinguish it; but it truly gives me pain. I have\nnot felt one sensation of genuine pleasure since I heard my sentence;\nyet I acquiesced in it, and submissively took my leave; though I doubt\nnot but I shall retaliate the indignity one time or other.\n\nI have taken possession of my new purchase--an elegant and delightful\nresidence. It is rendered more so by being in the vicinity of my\ncharmer's native abode. This circumstance will conduce much to my\nenjoyment, if I can succeed in my plan of separating her from Mr. Boyer.\nI know that my situation and mode of life are far more pleasing to her\nthan his, and shall therefore trust to my appearance and address for a\nre\u00c3\u00abstablishment in her favor. I intend, if possible, to ingratiate\nmyself with her particular friends. For this purpose I called last week\nat her mother's to pay my respects to her (so I told the good woman) as\nan object of my particular regard, and as the parent of a young lady\nwhom I had the honor to know and admire. She received me very civilly,\nthanked me for my attention, and invited me to call whenever I had\nopportunity; which was the very thing I wanted. I intend, likewise, to\ncourt popularity. I don't know but I must accept, by and by, some\nlucrative office in the civil department; yet I cannot bear the idea of\nconfinement to business. It appears to me quite inconsistent with the\ncharacter of a gentleman; I am sure it is with that of a man of\npleasure. But something I must do; for I tell you, in confidence, that I\nwas obliged to mortgage this place because I had not wherewithal to pay\nfor it. But I shall manage matters very well, I have no doubt, and keep\nup the appearance of affluence till I find some lady in a strait for a\nhusband whose fortune will enable me to extricate myself from these\nembarrassments. Do come and see me, Charles; for, notwithstanding all my\ngayety and parade, I have some turns of the hypo, some qualms of\nconscience, you will call them; but I meddle not with such obsolete\nwords. And so good by to you, says\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER XXXIII.\n\nTO MISS LUCY FREEMAN.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nMy dear friend: I believe I must begin to assume airs of gravity; and\nthey will not be quite so foreign to my feelings now as at some other\ntimes. You shall know the reason. I have been associated for three days\nwith sentiment and sobriety in the person of Mr. Boyer. I don't know but\nthis man will seduce me into matrimony. He is very eloquent upon the\nsubject; and his manners are so solemn that I am strongly tempted--yet I\ndare not--to laugh. Really, Lucy, there is something extremely engaging,\nand soothing, too, in virtuous and refined conversation. It is a source\nof enjoyment which cannot be realized by the dissolute and unreflecting.\nBut then this particular theme of his is not a favorite one to me; I\nmean as connected with its consequences--care and confinement. However,\nI have compounded the matter with him, and conditioned that he shall\nexpatiate on the subject, and call it by what name he pleases,\n_platonic_ or _conjugal_, provided he will let me take my own time for\nthe consummation. I have consented that he shall escort me next week to\nsee my mamma and my Lucy. O, how the idea of returning to that revered\nmansion, to those beloved friends, exhilarates my spirits!\n\nGeneral Richman's politeness to me has induced him to invite a large\nparty of those gentlemen and ladies who have been particularly attentive\nto me during my residence here to dine and take tea to-morrow. After\nthat, I expect to be engaged in making farewell visits till I leave the\nplace. I shall, therefore, forego the pleasure of telling you any\noccurrences subsequent to this date until you see and converse with your\nsincere friend,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XXXIV.\n\nTO MRS. RICHMAN.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nDear madam: The day after I left your hospitable dwelling brought me\nsafe to that of my honored mamma; to the seat of maternal and filial\naffection; of social ease and domestic peace; of every species of\nhappiness which can result from religion and virtue, from refinement in\nmorals and manners.\n\nI found my brother and his wife, with Lucy Freeman and Mr. Sumner,\nwaiting to receive and bid me welcome. I flew with ecstasy to the bosom\nof my mamma, who received me with her accustomed affection, testified by\nthe expressive tears of tenderness which stole silently down her widowed\ncheek. She was unable to speak. I was equally so. We therefore indulged\na moment the pleasing emotions of sympathizing sensibility. When\ndisengaged from her fond embrace, I was saluted by the others in turn;\nand, having recovered myself, I presented Mr. Boyer to each of the\ncompany, and each of the company to him. He was cordially received by\nall, but more especially by my mamma.\n\nThe next day I was called upon and welcomed by several of my neighboring\nacquaintance; among whom I was not a little surprised to see Major\nSanford. He came in company with Mr. Stoddard and lady, whom he\novertook, as he told me, near by; and, as they informed him that the\ndesign of their visit was to welcome me home, he readily accepted their\ninvitation to partake of the pleasure which every one must receive on my\nreturn. I bowed slightly at his compliment, taking no visible notice of\nany peculiarity of expression either in his words or looks.\n\nHis politeness to Mr. Boyer appeared to be the result of habit; Mr.\nBoyer's to him to be forced by respect to the company to which he had\ngained admission. I dare say that each felt a conscious superiority--the\none on the score of merit, the other on that of fortune. Which ought to\noutweigh the judicious mind will easily decide. The scale, as I once\nobserved to you, will turn as fancy or reason preponderates. I believe\nthe esteem which I now have for Mr. Boyer will keep me steady; except,\nperhaps, some little eccentricities now and then, just by way of\nvariety. I am going to-morrow morning to spend a few days with Lucy\nFreeman, to assist in the preparation for, and the solemnization of, her\nnuptials. Mr. Boyer, in the mean time, will tarry among his friends in\ntown. My mamma is excessively partial to him, though I am not yet\njealous that she means to rival me. I am not certain, however, but it\nmight be happy for him if she should; for I suspect, not withstanding\nthe disparity of her age, that she is better calculated to make him a\ngood wife than I am or ever shall be.\n\nBut to be sober. Please, madam, to make my compliments acceptable to\nthose of your neighbors, whose politeness and attention to me while at\nyour house have laid me under particular obligations of gratitude and\nrespect. My best regards attend General Richman. Pray tell him that,\nthough I never expect to be so good a wife as he is blessed with, yet I\nintend, after a while, (when I have sowed all my wild oats,) to make a\ntolerable one.\n\nI am anxious to hear of a wished-for event, and of your safety. All who\nknow you feel interested in your health and happiness, but none more\nwarmly than your obliged and affectionate\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XXXV.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nI write a line, at Mrs. Richman's request, just to inform you, Eliza,\nthat, yesterday, that lovely and beloved woman presented me with a\ndaughter. This event awakens new sensations in my mind, and calls into\nexercise a kind of affection which had before lain dormant. I feel\nalready the tenderness of a parent, while imagination fondly traces the\nmother's likeness in the infant form. Mrs. Richman expects to receive\nyour congratulations in a letter by the next post. She bids me tell\nyou, moreover, that she hopes soon to receive an invitation, and be able\nto attend, to the consummation you talk of. Give Mrs. Richman's and my\nparticular regards to your excellent mother and to the worthy Mr. Boyer.\nWith sentiments of esteem and friendship, I am, &c.,\n\nS. RICHMAN.\n\n\nLETTER XXXVI.\n\nTO MRS. RICHMAN.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nFrom the scenes of festive mirth, from the conviviality of rejoicing\nfriends, and from the dissipating amusements of the gay world, I retire\nwith alacrity, to hail my beloved friend on the important charge which\nshe has received; on the accession to her family, and, may I not say, on\nthe addition to her care? since that care will be more than\ncounterbalanced by the pleasure it confers. Hail, happy babe! ushered\ninto the world by the best of mothers; entitled by birthright to virtue\nand honor; defended by parental love from the weakness of infancy and\nchildhood, by guardian wisdom from the perils of youth, and by affluent\nindependence from the griping hand of poverty in more advanced life! May\nthese animating prospects be realized by your little daughter, and may\nyou long enjoy the rich reward of seeing her all that you wish.\n\nYesterday, my dear friend, Lucy Freeman, gave her hand to the amiable\nand accomplished Mr. George Sumner. A large circle of congratulating\nfriends were present. Her dress was such as wealth and elegance\nrequired. Her deportment was every thing that modesty and propriety\ncould suggest. They are, indeed, a charming couple. The consonance of\ntheir dispositions, the similarity of their tastes, and the equality of\ntheir ages are a sure pledge of happiness. Every eye beamed with\npleasure on the occasion, and every tongue echoed the wishes of\nbenevolence. Mine only was silent. Though not less interested in the\nfelicity of my friend than the rest, yet the idea of a separation,\nperhaps of an alienation of affection, by means of her entire devotion\nto another, cast an involuntary gloom over my mind. Mr. Boyer took my\nhand after the ceremony was past. \"Permit me, Miss Wharton,\" said he,\n\"to lead you to your lovely friend; her happiness must be heightened by\nyour participation of it.\" \"O, no,\" said I, \"I am too selfish for that.\nShe has conferred upon another that affection which I wished to engross.\nMy love was too fervent to admit a rival.\" \"Retaliate, then,\" said he,\n\"this fancied wrong by doing likewise.\" I observed that this was not a\nproper time to discuss that subject, and, resuming my seat, endeavored\nto put on the appearance of my accustomed vivacity. I need not relate\nthe remaining particulars of-the evening's entertainment. Mr. Boyer\nreturned with my mamma, and I remained at Mrs. Freeman's.\n\nWe are to have a ball here this evening. Mr. Boyer has been with us, and\ntried to monopolize my company; but in vain. I am too much engaged by\nthe exhilarating scenes around for attending to a subject which affords\nno variety. I shall not close this till to-morrow.\n\nI am rather fatigued with the amusements of last night, which were\nprotracted to a late hour. Mr. Boyer was present; and I was pleased to\nsee him not averse to the entertainment, though his profession prevented\nhim from taking an active part. As all the neighboring gentry were\ninvited, Mr. Freeman would by no means omit Major Sanford, which his\ndaughter earnestly solicited. It happened (unfortunately, shall I say?)\nthat I drew him for a partner. Yet I must own that I felt very little\nreluctance to my lot. He is an excellent dancer, and well calculated for\na companion in the hours of mirth and gayety. I regretted Mr. Boyer's\nbeing present, however, because my enjoyment seemed to give him pain. I\nhope he is not inclined to the passion of jealousy. If he is, I fear it\nwill be somewhat exercised.\n\nLucy Freeman, now Mrs. Sumner, removes next week to Boston. I have\nagreed to accompany her, and spend a month or two in her family. This\nwill give variety to the journey of life. Be so kind as to direct your\nnext letter to me there.\n\nKiss the dear little babe for me. Give love, compliments, &c., as\nrespectively due; and believe me, with every sentiment of respect, your\naffectionate\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XXXVII.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nDear Charles: My hopes begin to revive. I am again permitted to\nassociate with my Eliza--invited to the same entertainment. She does not\nrefuse to join with me in the mazy dance, and partake the scenes of\nfestive mirth. Nay, more; she allows me to press her hand to my lips,\nand listens to the sighing accents of love. Love her I certainly do.\nWould to Heaven I could marry her! Would to Heaven I had preserved my\nfortune, or she had one to supply its place! I am distracted at the idea\nof losing her forever. I am sometimes tempted to solicit her hand in\nserious earnest; but if I should, poverty and want must be the\nconsequence. Her disappointment in the expectation of affluence and\nsplendor, which I believe her ruling passion, would afford a perpetual\nsource of discontent and mutual wretchedness.\n\nShe is going to Boston with her friend, Mrs. Sumner. I must follow her.\nI must break the connection which is rapidly forming between her and Mr.\nBoyer, and enjoy her society a while longer, if no more.\n\nI have had a little intimation from New Haven that Miss Lawrence is\npartial to me, and might easily be obtained, with a handsome property\ninto the bargain. I am neither pleased with nor averse to the girl; but\nshe has money, and that may supply the place of love, by enabling me to\npursue independent pleasures. This she must expect, if she marries a man\nof my cast. She, doubtless, knows my character; and if she is so vain of\nher charms or influence as to think of reforming or confining me, she\nmust bear the consequences.\n\nHowever, I can keep my head up at present without recourse to the noose\nof matrimony, and shall therefore defer any particular attention to her\ntill necessity requires it. I am, &c.,\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER XXXVIII.\n\nTO MRS. M. WHARTON.\n\nBOSTON.\n\nYou commanded me, my dear mamma, to write to you. That command I\ncheerfully obey, in testimony of my ready submission and respect. No\nother avocation could arrest my time, which is now completely occupied\nin scenes of amusement.\n\nMrs. Sumner is agreeably settled and situated. She appears to be\npossessed of every blessing which can render life desirable. Almost\nevery day since our arrival has been engrossed by visitants. Our\nevenings we have devoted to company abroad; and that more generally than\nwe should otherwise have done, as my stay is limited to so short a\nperiod. The museum, the theatres, the circus, and the assemblies have\nbeen frequented.\n\nMrs. Sumner has made me several presents; notwithstanding which, the\narticles requisite to a fashionable appearance have involved me in\nconsiderable expense. I fear that you will think me extravagant when you\nare told how much.\n\nMr. Boyer tarried in town about a week, having business. He appeared a\nlittle concerned at my taste for dissipation, as he once termed it. He\neven took the liberty to converse seriously on the subject.\n\nI was displeased with his freedom, and reminded him that I had the\ndisposal of my own time as yet, and that, while I escaped the censure of\nmy own heart, I hoped that no one else would presume to arraign it. He\napologized, and gave up his argument.\n\nI was much surprised, the first time I went to the play, to see Major\nSanford in the very next box. He immediately joined our party; and\nwherever I have been since, I have been almost sure to meet him.\n\nMr. Boyer has taken his departure; and I do not expect to see him again\ntill I return home.\n\nO mamma, I am embarrassed about this man. His worth I acknowledge; nay,\nI esteem him very highly. But can there be happiness with such a\ndisparity of dispositions?\n\nI shall soon return to the bosom of domestic tranquillity, to the arms\nof maternal tenderness, where I can deliberate and advise at leisure\nabout this important matter. Till when, I am, &c.,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XXXIX.\n\nTO MR. T. SELBY.\n\nHAMPSHIRE.\n\nDear sir: I believe that I owe you an apology for my long silence. But\nmy time has been much engrossed of late, and my mind much more so. When\nit will be otherwise I cannot foresee. I fear, my friend, that there is\nsome foundation for your suspicions respecting my beloved Eliza. What\npity it is that so fair a form, so accomplished a mind, should be\ntarnished in the smallest degree by the follies of coquetry! If this be\nthe fact, which I am loath to believe, all my regard for her shall never\nmake me the dupe of it.\n\nWhen I arrived at her residence at New Haven, where I told you in my\nlast I was soon to go, she gave me a most cordial reception. Her whole\nbehavior to me was correspondent with those sentiments of esteem and\naffection which she modestly avowed. She permitted me to accompany her\nto Hartford, to restore her to her mother, and to declare my wish to\nreceive her again from her hand. Thus far all was harmony and happiness.\nAs all my wishes were consistent with virtue and honor, she readily\nindulged them. She took apparent pleasure in my company, encouraged my\nhopes of a future union, and listened to the tender accents of love.\n\nBut the scenes of gayety which invited her attention reversed her\nconduct. The delightful hours of mutual confidence, of sentimental\nconverse, and of the interchange of refined affection were no more.\nInstead of these, parties were formed unpleasing to my taste, and every\nopportunity was embraced to join in diversions in which she knew I could\nnot consistently take a share. I, however, acquiesced in her pleasure,\nthough I sometimes thought myself neglected, and even hinted it to her\nmother. The old lady apologized for her daughter, by alleging that she\nhad been absent for a long time; that her acquaintances were rejoiced\nat her return, and welcomed her by striving to promote her amusement.\n\nOne of her most intimate friends was married during my stay, and she\nappeared deeply interested in the event. She spent several days in\nassisting her previous to the celebration. I resided, in the mean time,\nat her mamma's, visiting her at her friend's, where Major Sanford, among\nothers, was received as a guest. Mrs. Sumner acquainted me that she had\nprevailed on Miss Wharton to go and spend a few weeks with her at\nBoston, whither she was removing, and urged my accompanying them. I\nendeavored to excuse myself, as I had been absent from my people a\nconsiderable time, and my return was now expected. But their importunity\nwas so great, and Eliza's declaration that it would be very agreeable to\nher so tempting, that I consented. Here I took lodgings, and spent about\na week, taking every opportunity to converse with Eliza, striving to\ndiscover her real disposition towards me. I mentioned the inconvenience\nof visiting her so often as I wished, and suggested my desire to enter,\nas soon as might be, into a family relation. I painted, in the most\nalluring colors, the pleasures resulting from domestic tranquillity,\nmutual confidence, and conjugal affection, and insisted on her declaring\nfrankly whether she designed to share this happiness with me, and when\nit should commence. She owned that she intended to give me her hand,\nbut when she should be ready she could not yet determine. She pretended\na promise from me to wait her time, to consent that she should share the\npleasures of the fashionable world as long as she chose, &c.\n\nI then attempted to convince her of her mistaken ideas of pleasure; that\nthe scenes of dissipation, of which she was so passionately fond,\nafforded no true enjoyment; that the adulation of the coxcomb could not\ngive durability to her charms, or secure the approbation of the wise and\ngood; nor could the fashionable amusements of brilliant assemblies and\ncrowded theatres furnish the mind with\n\n  \"That which nothing earthly gives or can destroy--\n  The soul's calm sunshine and the heartfelt joy.\"\n\nThese friendly suggestions, I found, were considered as the theme of a\npriest, and my desire to detach her from such empty pursuits as the\nselfishness of a lover. She was even offended at my freedom, and warmly\naffirmed that no one had a right to arraign her conduct. I mentioned\nMajor Sanford, who was then in town, and who (though she went to places\nof public resort with Mr. and Mrs. Sumner) always met and gallanted her\nhome. She rallied me upon my jealousy, as she termed it, wished that I\nwould attend her myself, and then she should need no other gallant. I\nanswered that I had rather resign that honor to another, but wished, for\nher sake, that he might be a gentleman whose character would not\ndisgrace the company with which he associated. She appeared mortified\nand chagrined in the extreme. However, she studiously suppressed her\nemotions, and even soothed me with the blandishments of female softness.\nWe parted amicably. She promised to return soon and prepare for a\ncompliance with my wishes. I cannot refuse to believe her. I cannot\ncease to love her. My heart is in her possession. She has a perfect\ncommand of my passions. Persuasion dwells on her tongue. With all the\nboasted fortitude and resolution of our sex, we are but mere machines.\nLet love once pervade our breasts, and its object may mould us into any\nform that pleases her fancy, or even caprice.\n\nI have just received a letter from Eliza, informing me of her return to\nHartford. To-morrow I shall set out on a visit to the dear girl; for, my\nfriend, notwithstanding all her foibles, she is very dear to me. Before\nyou hear from me again I expect that the happy day will be fixed--the\nday which shall unite in the-most sacred bands this lovely maid and your\nfaithful friend,\n\nJ. BOYER.\n\n\nLETTER XL.\n\nTO MR. T. SELBY.\n\nHAMPSHIRE.\n\nI have returned; and the day, indeed, is fixed; but O, how different\nfrom my fond expectations! It is not the day of union, but the day of\nfinal separation; the day which divides me from my charmer; the day\nwhich breaks asunder the bands of love; the day on which my reason\nassumes its empire, and triumphs over the arts of a finished coquette.\nCongratulate me, my friend, that I have thus overcome my feelings, and\nrepelled the infatuating wiles of a deceitful girl. I would not be\nunderstood to impeach Miss Wharton's virtue; I mean her chastity.\nVirtue, in the common acceptation of the term, as applied to the sex, is\nconfined to that particular, you know. But in my view, this is of little\nimportance where all other virtues are wanting.\n\nWhen I arrived at Mrs. Wharton's, and inquired for Eliza, I was told\nthat she had rode out, but was soon expected home. An hour after, a\nphaeton stopped at the door, from which my fair one alighted, and was\nhanded into the house by Major Sanford, who immediately took leave. I\nmet her, and offered my hand, which she received with apparent\ntenderness.\n\nWhen the family had retired after supper, and left us to talk on our\nparticular affairs, I found the same indecision, the same loathness to\nbring our courtship to a period, as formerly. Her previous excuses were\nrenewed, and her wishes to have a union still longer delayed were\nzealously urged. She could not bear the idea of confinement to the cares\nof a married life at present, and begged me to defer all solicitation on\nthat subject to some future day. I found my temper rise, and told her\nplainly that I was not thus to be trifled with; that if her regard for\nme was sincere, if she really intended to form a connection with me, she\ncould not thus protract the time, try my patience, and prefer every\nother pleasure to the rational interchange of affection, to the calm\ndelights of domestic life. But in vain did I argue against her false\nnotions of happiness, in vain did I represent the dangerous system of\nconduct which she now pursued, and urge her to accept, before it was too\nlate, the hand and heart which were devoted to her service. That, she\nsaid, she purposed ere long to do, and hoped amply to reward my faithful\nlove; but she could not fix the time this evening. She must consider a\nlittle further, and likewise consult her mother. \"Is it not Major\nSanford whom you wish to consult, madam?\" said I. She blushed, and gave\nme no answer. \"Tell me, Eliza,\" I continued, \"tell me frankly, if he has\nnot supplanted me in your affections--if he be not the cause of my being\nthus evasively, thus cruelly, treated.\" \"Major Sanford, sir,\" replied\nshe, \"has done you no harm. He is a particular friend of mine, a polite\ngentleman, and an agreeable neighbor, and therefore I treat him with\ncivility; but he is not so much interested in my concerns as to alter my\ndisposition towards any other person.\" \"Why,\" said I, \"do you talk of\nfriendship with a man of his character? Between his society and mine\nthere is a great contrast. Such opposite pursuits and inclinations\ncannot be equally pleasing to the same taste. It is, therefore,\nnecessary that you renounce the one to enjoy the other; I will give you\ntime to decide which. I am going to a friend's house to spend the night,\nand will call on you to-morrow, if agreeable, and converse with you\nfurther upon the matter.\" She bowed assent, and I retired.\n\nThe next afternoon I went, as agreed, and found her mamma and her alone\nin the parlor. She was very pensive, and appeared to have been in tears.\nThe sight affected me. The idea of having treated her harshly the\nevening before disarmed me of my resolution to insist on her decision\nthat day. I invited her to ride with me and visit a friend, to which\nshe readily consented. We spent our time agreeably. I forbore to press\nher on the subject of our future union, but strove rather to soothe her\nmind, and inspire her with sentiments of tenderness towards me. I\nconducted her home, and returned early in the evening to my friend's,\nwho met me at the door, and jocosely told me that he expected that I\nshould now rob them of their agreeable neighbor. \"But,\" added he, \"we\nhave been apprehensive that you would be rivalled if you delayed your\nvisit much longer.\" \"I did not suspect a rival,\" said I. \"Who can the\nhappy man be?\" \"I can say nothing from personal observation,\" said he;\n\"but fame, of late, has talked loudly of Major Sanford and Miss Wharton.\nBe not alarmed,\" continued he, seeing me look grave; \"I presume no harm\nis intended; the major is a man of gallantry, and Miss Wharton is a gay\nlady; but I dare say that your connection will be happy, _if it be\nformed_\" I noticed a particular emphasis on the word _if_; and, as we\nwere alone, I followed him with questions till the whole affair was\ndeveloped. I informed him of my embarrassment, and he gave me to\nunderstand that Eliza's conduct had, for some time past, been a subject\nof speculation in the town; that, formerly, her character was highly\nesteemed; but that her intimacy with a man of Sanford's known\nlibertinism, more especially as she was supposed to be engaged to\nanother, had rendered her very censurable; that they were often\ntogether; that wherever she went he was sure to follow, as if by\nappointment; that they walked, talked, sung, and danced together in all\ncompanies; that some supposed he he would marry her; others, that he\nonly meditated adding her name to the black catalogue of deluded\nwretches, whom he had already ruined!\n\nI rose, and walked the room in great agitation. He apologized for his\nfreedom; was sorry if he had wounded my feelings; but friendship alone\nhad induced him frankly to declare the truth, that I might guard against\nduplicity and deceit.\n\nI thanked him for his kind intensions; and assured him that I should not\nquit the town till I had terminated this affair, in one way or another.\n\nI retired to bed, but sleep was a stranger to my eyes. With the dawn I\nrose; and after breakfast walked to Mrs. Wharton's, who informed me,\nthat Eliza was in her chamber, writing to a friend, but would be down in\na few minutes. I entered into conversation with the old lady on the\nsubject of her daughter's conduct; hinted my suspicions of the cause,\nand declared my resolution of knowing my destiny immediately. She\nendeavored to extenuate, and excuse her as much as possible; but frankly\nowned that her behavior was mysterious; that no pains had been wanting,\non her part, to alter and rectify it; that she had remonstrated,\nexpostulated, advised and entreated, as often as occasion required. She\nhoped that my resolution would have a good effect, as she knew that her\ndaughter esteemed me very highly.\n\nIn this manner we conversed till the clock struck twelve; and, Eliza not\nappearing, I desired her mamma to send up word that I waited to see her.\nThe maid returned with an answer that she was indisposed, and had lain\ndown. Mrs. Wharton observed that she had not slept for several nights,\nand complained of the headache in the morning. The girl added that she\nwould wait on Mr. Boyer in the evening. Upon this information I rose,\nand abruptly took my leave. I went to dine with a friend, to whom I had\nengaged myself the day before; but my mind was too much agitated to\nenjoy either the company or the dinner. I excused myself from tarrying\nto tea, and returned to Miss Wharton's. On inquiry, I was told that\nEliza had gone to walk in the garden, but desired that no person might\nintrude on her retirement. The singularity of the request awakened my\ncuriosity, and determined me to follow her. I sought her in vain in\ndifferent parts of the garden, till, going towards an arbor, almost\nconcealed from sight by surrounding shrubbery, I discovered her sitting\nin close conversation with Major Sanford! My blood chilled in my veins,\nand I stood petrified with astonishment at the disclosure of such\nbaseness and deceit. They both rose in visible confusion. I dared not\ntrust myself to accost them. My passions were raised, and I feared that\nI might say or do something unbecoming my character. I therefore gave\nthem a look of indignation and contempt, and retreated to the house. I\ntraversed the parlor hastily, overwhelmed with chagrin and resentment.\nMrs. Wharton inquired the cause. I attempted to tell her, but my tongue\nrefused utterance. While in this situation, Eliza entered the room. She\nwas not less discomposed than myself. She sat down at the window and\nwept. Her mamma wept likewise. At length she recovered herself, in a\ndegree, and desired me to sit down. I answered, No, and continued\nwalking. \"Will you,\" said she, \"permit me to vindicate my conduct, and\nexplain my motives?\" \"Your conduct,\" said I, \"cannot be vindicated; your\nmotives need no explanation; they are too apparent. How, Miss Wharton,\nhave I merited this treatment from you? But I can bear it no longer.\nYour indifference to me proceeds from an attachment to another, and,\nforgive me if I add, to one who is the disgrace of his own sex and the\ndestroyer of yours. I have been too long the dupe of your dissimulation\nand coquetry--too long has my peace of mind been sacrificed to the arts\nof a woman whose conduct has proved her unworthy of my regard;\ninsensible to love, gratitude, and honor.\n\n\"To you, madam,\" said I, turning to her mother, \"I acknowledge my\nobligations for your friendship, politeness, and attention. I once hoped\nfor the privilege of rocking for you the cradle of declining age. I am\ndeprived of that privilege; but I pray that you may never want a child\nwhose love and duty shall prove a source of consolation and comfort.\n\n\"Farewell. If we never meet again in this life, I hope and trust we\nshall in a better--where the parent's eye shall cease to weep for the\ndisobedience of a child, and the lover's heart to bleed for the\ninfidelity of his mistress.\"\n\nI turned to Eliza, and attempted to speak; but her extreme emotion\nsoftened me, and I could not command my voice. I took her hand, and\nbowing, in token of an adieu, went precipitately out of the house. The\nresidence of my friend, with whom I lodged, was at no great distance,\nand thither I repaired. As I met him in the entry, I rushed by him, and\nbetook myself to my chamber. The fever of resentment and the tumult of\npassion began now to give place to the softer emotions of the soul. I\nfound myself perfectly unmanned. I gave free scope to the sensibility\nof my heart; and the effeminate relief of tears materially lightened the\nload which oppressed me.\n\nAfter this arduous struggle I went to bed, and slept more calmly than\nfor several nights before. The next morning I wrote a farewell letter to\nEliza, (a copy of which I shall enclose to you,) and, ordering my horse\nto be brought, left town immediately.\n\nMy resentment of her behavior has much assisted me in erasing her image\nfrom my breast. In this exertion I have succeeded beyond my most\nsanguine expectations. The more I reflect on her temper and disposition,\nthe more my gratitude is enlivened towards the wise Disposer of all\nevents for enabling me to break asunder the snares of the deluder. I am\nconvinced that the gayety and extravagance of her taste, the frivolous\nlevity of her manners, disqualify her for the station in which I wished\nto have placed her. These considerations, together with that resignation\nto an overruling Providence which the religion I profess and teach\nrequires me to cultivate, induce me cheerfully to adopt the following\nlines of an ingenious poet:--\n\n  \"Since all the downward tracts of time\n    God's watchful eye surveys,\n  O, who so wise to choose our lot,\n    Or regulate our ways?\n\n  \"Since none can doubt his equal love,\n    Unmeasurably kind,\n  To his unerring, gracious will\n    Be every wish, resigned.\n\n  \"Good when he gives, supremely good;\n    Not less when he denies;\n  E'en crosses from his sovereign hand\n    Are blessings in disguise.\"\n\nI am, &c.,                 J. BOYER.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\n[_Enclosed in the foregoing_.]\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nMadam: Fearing that my resolution may not be proof against the eloquence\nof those charms which has so long commanded me, I take this method of\nbidding you a final adieu. I write not as a lover,--that connection\nbetween us is forever dissolved,--but I address you as a friend; as a\nfriend to your happiness, to your reputation, to your temporal and\neternal welfare. I will not rehearse the innumerable instances of your\nimprudence and misconduct which have fallen under my observation. Your\nown heart must be your monitor. Suffice it for me to warn you against\nthe dangerous tendency of so dissipated a life, and to tell you that I\nhave traced (I believe aright) the cause of your dissimulation and\nindifference to me. They are an aversion to the sober, rational, frugal\nmode of living to which my profession leads; a fondness for the parade,\nthe gayety, not to say the licentiousness, of a station calculated to\ngratify such a disposition; and a prepossession for Major Sanford,\ninfused into your giddy mind by the frippery, flattery, and artifice of\nthat worthless and abandoned man. Hence you preferred a connection with\nhim, if it could be accomplished; but a doubt whether it could, together\nwith the advice of your friends, who have kindly espoused my cause, has\nrestrained you from the avowal of your real sentiments, and led you to\ncontinue your civilities to me. What the result of your coquetry would\nhave been had I waited for it, I cannot say; nor have I now any desire\nor interest to know. I tear from my breast the idea which I have long\ncherished of future union and happiness with you in the conjugal state.\nI bid a last farewell to these fond hopes, and leave you forever.\n\nFor your own sake, however, let me conjure you to review your conduct,\nand, before you have advanced beyond the possibility of returning to\nrectitude and honor, to restrain your steps from the dangerous path in\nwhich you now tread.\n\nFly Major Sanford. That man is a deceiver. Trust not his professions.\nThey are certainly insincere, or he would not affect concealment; he\nwould not induce you to a clandestine intercourse. Many have been the\nvictims to his treachery. O Eliza, add not to the number. Banish him\nfrom your society if you wish to preserve your virtue unsullied, your\ncharacter unsuspicious. It already begins to depreciate. Snatch it from\nthe envenomed tongue of slander before it receive an incurable wound.\n\nMany faults have been visible to me, over which my affection once drew a\nveil. That veil is now removed; and acting the part of a disinterested\nfriend, I shall mention some few of them with freedom. There is a levity\nin your manners which is inconsistent with the solidity and decorum\nbecoming a lady who has arrived to years of discretion. There is also an\nunwarrantable extravagance betrayed in your dress. Prudence and economy\nare such necessary, at least such decent, virtues, that they claim the\nattention of every female, whatever be her station or her property. To\nthese virtues you are apparently inattentive. Too large a portion of\nyour time is devoted to the adorning of your person.\n\nThink not that I write thus plainly from resentment. No, it is from\nbenevolence. I mention your foibles, not to reproach you with them, but\nthat you may consider their nature and effects, and renounce them.\n\nI wish you to regard this letter as the legacy of a friend, and to\nimprove it accordingly. I shall leave town before you receive it. O, how\ndifferent are my sensations at going from what they were when I came!\nBut I forbear description. Think not, Eliza, that I leave you with\nindifference. The conquest is great, the trial more than I can calmly\nsupport; yet the consciousness of duty affords consolation---a duty I\nconceive it to be which I owe to myself and to the people of my charge,\nwho are interested in my future connection.\n\nI wish not for an answer; my resolution is unalterably fixed. But should\nyou hereafter be convinced of the justice of my conduct, and become a\nconvert to my advice, I shall be happy to hear it.\n\nThat you may have wisdom to keep you from falling, and conduct you\nsafely through this state of trial to the regions of immortal bliss, is\nthe fervent prayer of your sincere friend and humble servant,\n\nJ. BOYER.\n\n\nLETTER XLI.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nThe retirement of my native home is not so gloomy, since my return from\nBoston, as I expected, from the contrast between them. Indeed, the\ncustoms and amusements of this place are materially altered since the\nresidence of Major Sanford among us. The dull, old-fashioned sobriety\nwhich formerly prevailed is nearly banished, and cheerfulness, vivacity,\nand enjoyment are substituted in its stead. Pleasure is now diffused\nthrough all ranks of the people, especially the rich; and surely it\nought to be cultivated, since the wisest of men informs us that a merry\nheart \"doth good like a medicine.\" As human life hath many diseases\nwhich require medicines, are we not right in selecting the most\nagreeable and palatable? Major Sanford's example has had great influence\nupon our society in general; and though some of our old ones think him\nrather licentious, yet, for aught I can see, he is as strict an observer\nof decorum as the best of them. True, he seldom goes to church; but\nwhat of that? The Deity is not confined to temples made with hands. He\nmay worship him as devoutly elsewhere, if he chooses; and who has a\nright to say he does not?\n\nHis return from Boston was but a day or two after mine. He paid me an\nearly visit, and, indeed, has been very attentive ever since. My mamma\nis somewhat precise in her notions of propriety, and, of course, blames\nme for associating so freely with him. She says that my engagements to\nMr. Boyer ought to render me more sedate, and more indifferent to the\ngallantry of mere pleasure _hunters_, to use her phrase. But I think\notherwise. If I am to become a recluse, let me at least enjoy those\namusements which are suited to my taste a short time first. Why should I\nrefuse the polite attentions of this gentleman? They smooth the rugged\npath of life, and wonderfully accelerate the lagging wheels of time.\n\nIndeed, Lucy, he has an admirable talent for contributing to vary and\nincrease amusement. We have few hours unimproved. Some new plan of\npleasure and sociability is constantly courting our adoption. He lives\nin all the magnificence of a prince: and why should I, who can doubtless\nshare that magnificence if I please, forego the advantages and\nindulgences it offers, merely to gratify those friends who pretend to\nbe better judges of my happiness than I am myself? I have not yet told\nmy mamma that he entertains me with the lover's theme, or, at least,\nthat I listen to it. Yet I must own to you, from whom I have never\nconcealed an action or idea, that his situation in life charms my\nimagination; that the apparent fervor and sincerity of his passion\naffect my heart. Yet there is something extremely problematical in his\nconduct. He is very urgent with me to dissolve my connection with Mr.\nBoyer, and engage not to marry him without his consent, or knowledge, to\nsay no more. He warmly applauds my wish still longer to enjoy the\nfreedom and independence of a single state, and professedly adopts it\nfor his own. While he would disconnect me from another, he mysteriously\nconceals his own intentions and views. In conversation with him\nyesterday, I plainly told him that his conduct was unaccountable; that,\nif his professions and designs were honorable, he could not neglect to\nmention them to my mamma; that I should no longer consent to carry on a\nclandestine intercourse with him; that I hourly expected Mr. Boyer, whom\nI esteemed, and who was the favorite of my friends; and that, unless he\nacted openly in this affair before his arrival, I should give my hand to\nhim.\n\nHe appeared thunderstruck at this declaration. All his words and actions\nwere indicative of the most violent emotions of mind. He entreated me\nto recall the sentence; for I knew not, he said, his motives for\nsecrecy; yet he solemnly swore that they were honorable. I replied in\nthe words of the poet,--\n\n  \"Trust not a man; they are by nature cruel,\n  False, deceitful, treacherous, and inconstant.\n  When a man talks of love, with caution hear him;\n  But if he swear, he'll certainly deceive you.\"\n\nHe begged that he might know by what means he had provoked my\nsuspicions; by what means he had forfeited my confidence. His\nimportunity vanquished my fortitude; and before we parted, I again\npromised to make him acquainted, from time to time, with the progress of\nmy connection with Mr. Boyer.\n\nNow, my dear friend, I want your advice more than ever. I am\ninadvertently embarrassed by this man; and how to extricate myself I\nknow not. I am sensible that the power is in my hands; but the\ndisposition (shall I confess it?) is wanting.\n\n  \"I know the right; and I approve it too;\n  I know the wrong, and yet the wrong pursue.\"\n\nI have just received a card from Major Sanford, inviting me to ride\nthis afternoon. At first I thought of returning a negative answer; but,\nrecollecting that Mr. Boyer must soon be here, I concluded it best to\nembrace this opportunity of talking further with him. I must now prepare\nto go, but shall not close this letter, for I intend writing in\ncontinuation, as events occur, till this important business is decided.\n\n_Tuesday evening_.--The little tour which I mentioned to you this\nafternoon was not productive of a final determination. The same plea was\nrepeated over and over again without closing the cause. On my return I\nfound Mr. Boyer waiting to receive me. My heart beat an involuntary\nwelcome. I received him very cordially, though with a kind of pleasure\nmixed with apprehension. I must own that his conversation and manners\nare much better calculated to bear the scrutinizing eye of a refined\nunderstanding and taste than Major Sanford's. But whether the fancy\nought not to be consulted about our settlement in life, is with me a\nquestion.\n\nWhen we parted last I had promised Mr. Boyer to inform him positively,\nat this visit, when my hand should be given. He therefore came, as he\ntold me in the course of our conversation, with the resolution of\nclaiming the fulfilment of this promise.\n\nI begged absolution, told him that I could not possibly satisfy his\nclaim, and sought still to evade and put off the important decision. He\ngrew warm, and affirmed that I treated him ungenerously and made\nneedless delays. He even accused me of indifference towards him, and of\npartiality to another. Major Sanford, he believed, was the man who\nrobbed him of the affection which he had supposed his due. He warned me\nagainst any intercourse with him, and insisted that I must renounce the\nsociety of the one or the other immediately.\n\nHe would leave me, he said, this evening, and call to-morrow to know the\nresult of my determination. It was late before he bade me good night,\nsince which I have written these particulars. It is now time to lay\naside my pen, and deliberate what course to take.\n\n_Wednesday evening_.--Last night I closed not my eyes. I rose this\nmorning with the sun, and went into the garden till breakfast. My mamma\ndoubtless saw the disorder of my mind, but kindly avoided any inquiry\nabout it. She was affectionately attentive to me, but said nothing of my\nparticular concerns. I mentioned not my embarrassment to her. She had\ndeclared herself in favor of Mr. Boyer; therefore I had no expectation\nthat she would advise impartially. I retired to my chamber, and\nremained in a kind of revery for more than an hour, when I was roused by\nthe rattling of a carriage at the door. I hastened to the window, and\nsaw Major Sanford just driving away. The idea of his having been to\nconverse with my mamma gave me new sensations. A thousand perplexities\noccurred to my mind relative to the part most proper for me to act in\nthis critical situation. All these might have been avoided, had I gone\ndown and inquired into the matter; but this I delayed till dinner. My\nmamma then informed me that Major Sanford had been with her, and\ninquired for me, but that she thought it unnecessary to call me, as she\npresumed I had no particular business with him. I knew the motives by\nwhich she was actuated, and was vexed at her evasions. I told her\nplainly that she would never carry her point in this way; that Thought\nmyself capable of conducting my own affairs, and wished her not to\ninterfere, except by her advice, which I should always listen to and\ncomply with when I could possibly make it consistent with my inclination\nand interest. She wept at my undutiful anger, (of which I have severely\nrepented since,) and affectionately replied, that my happiness was the\nobject of her wishes and prayers; conformably to which she felt\nconstrained freely to speak her mind, though it incurred my displeasure.\nShe then went through again with all the comparative circumstances and\nmerits of the two candidates for my favor, which have perpetually rung\nin my ears for months. I shed tears at the idea of my embarrassment; and\nin this condition Mr. Boyer found us. He appeared to be affected by my\nvisible disorder, and, without inquiring the cause, endeavored to\ndissipate it. This was kindly done. He conversed upon indifferent\nsubjects, and invited me to ride, and take tea with your mamma, to which\nI readily consented. We found her at home, and passed the time\nagreeably, excepting the alloy of your absence. Mr. Boyer touched\nlightly on the subject of our last evening's debate, but expatiated\nlargely on the pleasing power of love, and hoped that we should one day\nboth realize and exemplify it in perfection. When we returned he\nobserved that it was late, and took his leave, telling me that he should\ncall to-morrow, and begged that I would then relieve his suspense. As I\nwas retiring to bed, the maid gave me a hint that Major Sanford's\nservant had been here and left a letter. I turned instantly back to my\nmamma, and, telling her my information, demanded the letter. She hesitated,\nbut I insisted on having it; and seeing me resolute, she reluctantly gave it\ninto my hand. It contained the following words:--\n\n\"Am I forsaken? am I abandoned? O my adorable Eliza, have you sacrificed\nme to my rival? have you condemned me to perpetual banishment without a\nhearing?\n\n\"I came this day to plead my cause at your feet, but was cruelly denied\nthe privilege of seeing you. My mind is all anarchy and confusion. My\nsoul is harrowed up with jealousy. I will be revenged on those who\nseparate us, if that distracting event take place. But it is from your\nlips only that I can hear my sentence. You must witness its effects. To\nwhat lengths my despair may carry me I know not. You are the arbitress\nof my fate.\n\n\"Let me conjure you to meet me in your garden to-morrow at any hour you\nshall appoint. My servant will call for an answer in the morning. Deny\nme not an interview, but have pity on your faithful     SANFORD.\"\n\nI wrote for answer that I would meet him to-morrow, at five o'clock in\nthe afternoon.\n\nI have now before me another night for consideration, and shall pass it\nin that employment. I purpose not to see Mr. Boyer till I have conversed\nwith Major Sanford.\n\n_Thursday morning_.--The morning dawns, and ushers in the day--a day,\nperhaps, big with the fate of your friend. What that fate may be is\nwrapped in the womb of futurity--that futurity which a kind Providence\nhas wisely concealed from the penetration of mortals.\n\nAfter mature consideration, after revolving and re-revolving every\ncircumstance on both sides of the question, I have nearly determined, in\ncompliance with the advice of my friends and the dictates of my own\njudgment, to give Mr. Boyer the preference, and with him to tread the\nfuture round of life.\n\nAs to the despair of Major Sanford, it does not much alarm me. Such\nviolent passions are seldom so deeply rooted as to produce lasting\neffects. I must, however, keep my word, and meet him according to\npromise.\n\nMr. Boyer is below. My mamma has just sent me word that he wished to see\nme. My reply was, that I had lain down, which was a fact.\n\n_One o'clock._--My mamma, alarmed by my indisposition, has visited my\napartment. I soon convinced her that it was but trifling, owing\nprincipally to the want of sleep, and that an airing in the garden,\nwhich I intended towards night, would restore me.\n\n_Ten o'clock at night_.--The day is past; and such a day it has been as\nI hope nevermore to see. At the hour appointed, I went, tolerably\ncomposed and resolute, into the garden. I had taken several turns, and\nretired into the little arbor, where you and I have spent so many happy\nhours, before Major Sanford entered. When he appeared, a consciousness\nof the impropriety of this clandestine intercourse suffused my cheek,\nand gave a coldness to my manners. He immediately penetrated the cause,\nand observed that my very countenance told him he was no longer a\nwelcome guest to me. I asked him if he ought so to be, since his motives\nfor seeking admission were unworthy of being communicated to my friends.\nThat, he said, was not the case, but that prudence in the present\ninstance required a temporary concealment. He then undertook to\nexculpate himself from blame, assuring me that as soon as I should\ndiscountenance the expectations of Mr. Boyer, and discontinue the\nreception of his address, his intentions should be made known. He was\nenlarging upon this topic, when we heard a footstep approaching us, and,\nlooking up, saw Mr. Boyer within a few paces of the arbor. Confusion\nseized us both. We rose involuntarily from our seats, but were mute as\nstatues. He spoke not a word, but casting a look of indignant accusation\nat me,--a glance which penetrated my very soul,--turned on his heel,\nand walked hastily back to the house.\n\nI stood a few moments, considering what course to take, though shame and\nregret had almost taken from me the power of thought.\n\nMajor Sanford took my hand. I withdrew it from him. \"I _must_ leave\nyou,\" said I. \"Where will you go?\" said he. \"I will go and try to\nretrieve my character. It has suffered greatly by this fatal interview.\"\n\nHe threw himself at my feet, and exclaimed, \"Leave me not, Eliza; I\nconjure you not to leave me.\" \"Let me go now,\" I rejoined, \"or I bid you\nfarewell forever.\" I flew precipitately by him, and went into the\nparlor, where I found Mr. Boyer and my mamma, the one traversing the\nroom in the greatest agitation, the other in a flood of tears. Their\nappearance affected me, and I wept like an infant. When I had a little\nrecovered myself, I begged him to sit down. He answered, No. I then told\nhim that however unjustifiable my conduct might appear, perhaps I might\nexplain it to his satisfaction if he would hear me; that my motives were\ninnocent, though they doubtless wore the aspect of criminality in his\nview. He sternly replied, that no palliation could avail; that my\nmotives were sufficiently notorious. He accused me of treating him ill,\nof rendering him the dupe of coquetting artifice, of having an intrigue\nwith Major Sanford, and declared his determination to leave me forever,\nas unworthy of his regard, and incapable of love, gratitude, or honor.\nThere was too much reason in support of his accusations for me to\ngainsay them, had his impetuosity suffered me to attempt it.\n\nBut, in truth, I had no inclination to self-defence. My natural vivacity\nhad forsaken me, and I listened without interrupting him to the fluency\nof reproachful language which his resentment inspired. He took a very\nsolemn and affectionate leave of my mamma, thanking her for her\npoliteness, and wishing her much future felicity. He attempted to\naddress me, I suppose, somewhat in the same way; but his sensibility\nsomewhat overcame him, and he only took my hand, and, bowing in silence,\ndeparted.\n\nThe want of rest for two long nights together, the exercise of mind, and\nconflict of passions which now tortured my breast, were too much for me\nto support.\n\nWhen I saw that he was gone, that he had actually forsaken me, I\nfainted. My mamma, with the assistance of the maid, soon restored me.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes and beheld this amiable and tender parent watching\nand attending me with the most anxious concern, without one reproachful\nword, without one accusing look, my reflections upon the part I had\nacted, in defeating her benevolent wishes, were exquisitely afflictive.\nBut we mutually forbore to mention the occasion of my illness; and I\ncomplied with her advice to take some refreshment, and retire to my\nchamber. I am so much fatigued by the exertions of the day that rest is\nabsolutely necessary; and I lay aside my pen to seek it.\n\n_Friday morning_.--When I shall again receive the balmy influence of\nsleep, I know not. It has absolutely forsaken me at present. I have had\na most restless night. Every awakening idea presented itself to my\nimagination; whether I had sustained a real loss in Mr. Boyer's\ndeparture, reflections on my own misconduct, with the censure of my\nfriends, and the ill-natured remarks of my enemies, excited the most\npainful anxiety in my mind.\n\nI am going down; but how shall I see my mamma? To her I will confess my\nfaults, in her maternal breast repose my cares, and by her friendly\nadvice regulate my conduct. Had I done this before, I might have escaped\nthis trouble, and saved both her and myself many distressing emotions.\n\n_Friday evening_'.--I have had a long conversation with my mamma, which\nhas greatly relieved my mind. She has soothed me with the most endearing\ntenderness.\n\nMr. Atkins, with whom Mr. Boyer lodged while in town, called here this\nafternoon. I did not see him; but he told my mamma that Mr. Boyer had\nreturned home, and left a letter for me, which he had promised to convey\nwith his own hand. By this I am convinced that the die is absolutely\ncast with respect to him, and that no attempts on my part to bring about\na reconciliation would be either prudent or successful. He has\npenetrated the cause of my proceedings; and such is his resentment, that\nI am inclined not much to regret his avoiding another interview.\n\nMy excuses would be deemed utterly insufficient, and truth would not\nbefriend and justify me.\n\nAs I know you are impatient to hear from me, I will now despatch this\nlong letter without any other addition than that I am your sincere\nfriend,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XLII.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nWell, Charles, the show is over, as we Yankees say, and the girl is my\nown; that is, if I will have her. I shall take my own time for that,\nhowever. I have carried my point, and am amply revenged on the whole\nposse of those dear friends of hers. She was entangled by a promise (not\nto marry this priest without my knowledge) which her conscience would\nnot let her break. Thank God, I have no conscience. If I had, I believe\nit would make wretched work with me. I suppose she intended to have one\nor the other of us, but preferred me. I have escaped the noose this\ntime, and I'll be fairly hanged if I ever get so near it again; for\nindeed, Charles, I was seriously alarmed. I watched all their motions,\nand the appearance of harmony between them awakened all my activity and\nzeal. So great was my infatuation, that I verily believe I should have\nasked her in marriage, and risked the consequences, rather than to have\nlost her.\n\nI went to the house while Mr. Boyer was in town; but her mamma refused\nto call her, or to acquaint her that I was there. I then wrote a\ndespairing letter, and obtained a conference with her in the garden.\nThis was a fortunate event for me. True, Eliza was very haughty, and\nresolutely insisted on an immediate declaration or rejection; and I\ncannot say what would have been the result if Mr. Boyer had not\nsurprised us together. He gave us a pretty harsh look, and retired\nwithout speaking a word.\n\nI endeavored to detain Eliza, but in vain. She left me on my knees,\nwhich are always ready to bend on such occasions.\n\nThis finished the matter, it seems. I rose, and went into a neighbor's\nto observe what happened, and in about half an hour saw Mr. Boyer come\nout and go to his lodgings. \"This,\" said I to myself, \"is a good omen.\"\nI went home, and was informed, next day, that he had mounted his horse\nand departed.\n\nI heard nothing more of her till yesterday, when I determined to know\nhow she stood affected towards me. I therefore paid her a visit, her\nmamma being luckily abroad.\n\nShe received me very placidly, and told me, on inquiry, that Mr.\nBoyer's resentment at her meeting me in the garden was so great that he\nhad bade her a final adieu. I congratulated myself on having no rival,\nhoped that her favor would now be unbiased, and that in due time I\nshould reap the reward of my fidelity. She begged me not to mention the\nsubject, said she had been perplexed by our competition, and wished not\nto hear any thing further about it at present. I bowed in obedience to\nher commands, and changed the discourse.\n\nI informed her that I was about taking a tour to the southward; that I\nshould be absent several months, and trusted that on my return her\nembarrassments would be over.\n\nI left her with regret After all, Charles, she is the _summum bonum_ of\nmy life. I must have her in some way or other. Nobody else shall, I am\nresolved.\n\nI am making preparations for my journey, which, between you and me, is\noccasioned by the prospect of making a speculation, by which I hope to\nmend my affairs. The voyage will at least lessen my expenses, and screen\nme from the importunity of creditors till I can look about me.\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER XLIII.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nNEW HAVEN.\n\nMy dear Eliza: Through the medium of my friends at Hartford, I have been\ninformed of the progress of your affairs as they have transpired. The\ndetail which my sister gave me of your separation from Mr. Boyer was\npainful, as I had long contemplated a happy union between you; but still\nmore disagreeable sensations possessed my breast when told that you had\nsuffered your lively spirits to be depressed, and resigned yourself to\nsolitude and dejection.\n\nWhy, my dear friend, should you allow this event thus to affect you?\nHeaven, I doubt not, has happiness still in store for you--perhaps\ngreater than you could have enjoyed in that connection. If the\nconviction of any misconduct on your part gives you pain, dissipate it\nby the reflection that unerring rectitude is not the lot of mortals;\nthat few are to be found who have not deviated, in a greater or less\ndegree, from the maxims of prudence. Our greatest mistakes may teach\nlessons which will be useful through life.\n\nBut I will not moralize. Come and see us, and we will talk over the\nmatter once, and then dismiss it forever. Do prevail on your mamma to\npart with you a month or two at least. I wish you to witness how well I\nmanage my nursery business. You will be charmed with little Harriet. I\nam already enough of the mother to think her a miniature of beauty and\nperfection.\n\nHow natural and how easy the transition from one stage of life to\nanother! Not long since, I was a gay, volatile girl, seeking\nsatisfaction in fashionable circles and amusements; but now I am\nthoroughly domesticated. All my happiness is centred within the limits\nof my own walls, and I grudge every moment that calls me from the\npleasing scenes of domestic life. Not that I am so selfish as to exclude\nmy friends from my affection or society. I feel interested in their\nconcerns, and enjoy their company. I must own, however, that conjugal\nand parental love are the mainsprings of my life. The conduct of some\nmothers, in depriving their helpless offspring of the care and kindness\nwhich none but a mother can feel, is to me unaccountable. There are many\nnameless attentions which nothing short of maternal tenderness and\nsolicitude can pay, and for which the endearing smiles and progressive\nimprovements of the lovely babe are an ample reward.\n\nHow delightful to trace from day to day the expansion of reason and the\ndawnings of intelligence! O, how I anticipate the time when these\nfaculties shall be displayed by the organs of speech, when the lisping\naccent shall heighten our present pleasure, and the young idea be\ncapable of direction \"how to shoot\"! General Richman is not less\ninterested by these enjoyments than myself. All the father beams in his\neye; all the husband reigns in his heart and pervades his every action.\n\nMiss Lawrence is soon to be married to Mr. Laiton. I believe he is a\nmere fortune hunter. Indeed, she has little to recommend her to any\nother. Nature has not been very bountiful either to her body or mind.\nHer parents have been shamefully deficient in her education, but have\nsecured to her what they think the chief good--not considering that\nhappiness is by no means the invariable attendant of wealth.\n\nI hope this incoherent scrawl will amuse, while it induces you speedily\nto favor us with another visit.\n\nMy best wishes attend your honored mamma, while I subscribe myself, &c.,\n\nA. RICHMAN.\n\n\nLETTER XLIV.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nI am extremely depressed, my dear Lucy. The agitating scenes through\nwhich I have lately passed have broken my spirits, and rendered me unfit\nfor society. Major Sanford has visited me, and taken his leave. He is\ngone to the southward on a tour of two or three months. I declined any\nfurther conversation with him on the subject of love. At present I wish\nnot to hear it mentioned by any one.\n\nI have received a very friendly and consolatory letter from Mrs.\nRichman. She invites me to spend a few months with her, which, with my\nmamma's consent, I shall do. I hope the change of situation and company\nwill dissipate the gloom which hangs over my mind.\n\nIt is a common observation, that we know not the value of a blessing but\nby deprivation. This is strictly verified in my case. I was insensible\nof my regard for Mr. Boyer till this fatal separation took place. His\nmerit and worth now appear in the brightest colors. I am convinced of\nthat excellence which I once slighted, and the shade of departed\nhappiness haunts me perpetually. I am sometimes tempted to write to him\nand confess my faults; to tell him the situation of my mind, and to\noffer him my hand; but he has precluded all hopes of success by the\nseverity of his letter to me. At any rate, I shall do nothing of the\nkind till my return from New Haven.\n\nI am the more willing to leave home as my affairs are made a town talk.\nMy mamma persuades me to disregard it; but how can I rise superior to\n\"the world's dread laugh, which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn\"?\n\nPray remember me to Mr. Sumner. You are happy, my friend, in the love\nand esteem of a worthy man, but more happy still in deserving them.\nAdieu.\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XLV.\n\nTO THE SAME.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nI have returned to the once smiling seat of maternal affection; but I\nfind not repose and happiness even here.\n\nIn the society of my amiable friends at New Haven, I enjoyed every thing\nthat friendship could bestow; but rest to a disturbed mind was not in\ntheir power.\n\nI was on various parties of pleasure, and passed through different\nscenes of amusement; but with me they have lost their charms. I relished\nthem not as formerly.\n\nMrs. Richman advises me to write to Mr. Boyer, and I have concluded to\nact accordingly. If it answer no other purpose, it will be a relief to\nmy mind. If he ever felt for me the tenderness and regard which he\nprofessed, I think they cannot be entirely obliterated. If they still\nremain, perhaps I may rekindle the gentle flame, and we may both be\nhappy. I may at least recall his esteem, and that will be a satisfaction\nto my conscious mind.\n\nI wonder what has become of Major Sanford. Has he, too, forsaken me? Is\nit possible for him wilfully to neglect me? I will not entertain so\ninjurious a suspicion. Yet, if it were the case, it would not affect me\nlike Mr. Boyer's disaffection; for I frankly own that my fancy, and a\ntaste for gayety of life, induced me to cherish the idea of a connection\nwith Major Sanford; while Mr. Boyer's real merit has imprinted those\nsentiments of esteem and love in my heart which time can never efface.\n\nInstead of two or three, more than twelve months have elapsed, and I\nhave not received a line from Major Sanford in all that time, which I\nfully expected, though he made no mention of writing; nor have I heard a\nsyllable about him, except a report circulated by his servants, that he\nis on the point of marrying, which I do not believe. No; it is\nimpossible. I am persuaded that his passion for me was sincere, however\ndeceitful he may have been with others. But I will not bestow an anxious\nthought upon him. My design relative to Mr. Boyer demands my whole\nattention.\n\nMy hopes and fears alternately prevail, and my resolution is extremely\nfluctuating. How it finally terminates you shall hear in my next. Pray\nwrite to me soon. I stand in need of the consoling power of friendship.\nNothing can beguile my pensive hours, and exhilarate my drooping\nspirits, like your letters.\n\nLet me know how you are to be entertained this winter at the theatre.\nThat, you know, is a favorite amusement of mine. You see I can step out\nof myself a little. Afford an assisting hand, and perhaps I may again be\nfit for society.\n\nELIZA WHARTON\n\n\nLETTER XLVI.\n\nTO THE REV. J. BOYER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nSir: It is partly in compliance with your desire, in your last letter to\nme, in which you tell me \"that when I am convinced of the justice of\nyour conduct, and become a convert to your advice, you shall be happy to\nhear it,\" and partly from a wish to inform you that such is in truth my\npresent state of mind, that I now write to you.\n\nI cannot but hope that this letter, coming from the hand which you once\nsought, will not be unacceptable.\n\nPope very justly observes, that \"every year is a critic on the last.\"\nThe truth of this observation is fully exemplified in my years. How\nseverely this condemns the follies of the preceding, my own heart alone\ncan testify.\n\nI shall not offer any palliation or apology for my misconduct. You told\nme it admitted none. I frankly confess it; and if the most humble\nacknowledgment of my offences, with an assurance that they have cost me\nthe deepest repentance, can in any degree atone for them, I now make\nthat atonement. Casting off the veil of dissimulation, I shall write\nwith frankness, believing you possessed of more honor than to make any\nungenerous use of the confidence reposed in you.\n\nTo say that I ever esteemed you may, perhaps, appear paradoxical when\ncompared with certain circumstances which occurred during our\nacquaintance; but to assert that I loved you may be deemed still more\nso. Yet these are real facts--facts of which I was then sensible, and by\nwhich I am now more than ever affected.\n\nI think you formerly remarked that absence served but to heighten real\nlove. This I find by experience. Need I blush to declare these\nsentiments, when occasion like this calls for the avowal? I will go even\nfurther, and offer you that heart which you once prized, that hand which\nyou once solicited. The sentiments of affection which you then\ncultivated, though suppressed, I flatter myself are not wholly\nobliterated. Suffer me, then, to rekindle the latent flame, to revive\nthat friendship and tenderness which I have so foolishly neglected. The\nendeavor of my future life shall be to reward your benevolence, and\nperhaps we may yet be happy together.\n\nBut let not this offer of myself constrain you. Let not pity influence\nyour conduct. I would have your return, if that pleasing event take\nplace, a voluntary act. Receive, or consent not to confer, happiness.\n\nI thought it a duty which I owed to you, and to myself, to make this\nexpiation, this sacrifice of female reserve, for the wrongs I have done\nyou. As such I wish you to accept it; and if your affections are\nentirely alienated or otherwise engaged, if you cannot again command the\nrespect and love which I would recall, do not despise me for the\nconcessions I have made. Think as favorably of my past faults and of my\npresent disposition as charity will allow. Continue, if possible, to be\nmy friend, though you cease to be my lover.\n\nShould this letter find you in the full possession of happiness, let not\nthe idea of your once loved Eliza, thus intruding itself again upon your\nthoughts, interrupt your enjoyments. May some distinguished female, as\ndeserving as fair, partake with you of that bliss which I have\nforfeited.\n\nWhatever may be my destiny, my best wishes shall ever attend you, and a\npleasing remembrance of your honorable attentions preside, till death,\nin the breast of\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER XLVII.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nHAMPSHIRE.\n\nMadam: As I was sitting last evening in my study, a letter was handed me\nby a servant; upon which I no sooner cast my eye than I recognized, with\nsurprise, the hand and seal of my once loved, but to me long lost,\nEliza. I opened it hastily, and with still greater surprise read the\ncontents.\n\nYou write with frankness; I shall answer in the same manner.\n\nOn reviewing our former intercourse, be assured that I have not an\naccusing thought in my heart. The regard which I felt for you was tender\nand animated, but it was not of that passionate kind which ends in\ndeath or despair. It was governed by reason, and had a nobler object in\nview than mere sensual gratification. It was excited by the appearance\nof excellent qualities. Your conduct, at length, convinced me it was\nmisplaced; that you possessed not in reality those charms which I had\nfondly ascribed to you. They were inconsistent, I conceived, with that\nartifice and dissimulation of which you strove to render me the dupe.\nBut, thank Heaven, the snare was broken. My eyes were open to discover\nyour folly; and my heart, engaged as it was, exerted resolution and\nstrength to burst asunder the chain by which you held me enslaved, and\nto assert the rights of an injured man.\n\nThe parting scene you remember. I reluctantly bade you adieu. I tore\nmyself from you, determined to eradicate your idea from my breast. Long\nand severe was the struggle; at last I vanquished, as I thought, every\ntender passion of my soul, (for they all centred in you,) and resigned\nmyself to my God and my duty, devoting those affections to friendship\nwhich had been disappointed in love. But they are again called into\nexercise. The virtuous, the amiable, the accomplished Maria Selby\npossesses my entire confidence and esteem; and I trust I am not deceived\nwhen I think her highly deserving of both. With her I expect soon to be\nunited in the most sacred and endearing of human relations, with her to\npass my future days in serenity and peace.\n\nYour letter, therefore, came too late, were there no other obstacle to\nthe renewal of our connection. I hope at the close of life, when we take\na retrospect of the past, that neither of us shall have reason to regret\nour separation.\n\nPermit me to add, that for your own sake, and for the sake of your\never-valued friends, I sincerely rejoice that your mind has regained its\nnative strength and beauty; that you have emerged from the shade of\nfanciful vanity. For although, to adopt your own phrase, I cease to\nstyle myself your lover, among the number of your friends I am happy to\nbe reckoned. As such, let me conjure you, by all that is dear and\ndesirable, both in this life and another, to adhere with undeviating\nexactness to the paths of rectitude and innocence, and to improve the\nnoble talents which Heaven has liberally bestowed upon you in rendering\nyourself amiable and, useful to your friends. Thus will you secure your\nown, while you promote the happiness of all around you.\n\nI shall ever cherish sentiments of kindness towards you, and with\ngratitude remember your condescension in the testimony of regard which\nyou have given me in your last letter.\n\nI hope soon to hear that your heart and hand are bestowed on some worthy\nman, who deserves the happiness you are formed to communicate. Whatever\nwe may have called errors will, on my part, be forever buried in\noblivion; and for your own peace of mind I entreat you to forget that\nany idea of a connection between us ever existed.\n\nI shall always rejoice at the news of your welfare, and my ardent\nprayers will daily arise for your temporal and eternal felicity.\n\nJ. BOYER.\n\n\nLETTER XLVIII.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nHealth, placid serenity, and every domestic pleasure are the lot of my\nfriend; while I, who once possessed the means of each, and the capacity\nof tasting them, have been tossed upon the waves of folly, till I am\nshipwrecked on the shoals of despair.\n\nO my friend, I am undone. I am slighted, rejected, by the man who once\nsought my hand, by the man who still retains my heart. And what adds an\ninsupportable poignancy to the reflection is self-condemnation. From\nthis inward torture where shall I flee? Where shall I seek that\nhappiness which I have madly trifled away?\n\nThe enclosed letters[A] will show you whence this tumult of soul arises.\nBut I blame not Mr. Boyer. He has acted nobly. I approve his conduct,\nthough it operates my ruin.\n\nHe is worthy of his intended bride, and she is---what I am not--worthy\nof him. Peace and joy be their portion both here and hereafter. But what\nare now my prospects? What are to be the future enjoyments of my life?\n\nO that I had not written to Mr. Boyer! By confessing my faults, and by\navowing my partiality to him, I have given him the power of triumphing\nin my distress; of returning to my tortured heart all the pangs of\nslighted love. And what have I now to console me? My bloom is\ndecreasing, my health is sensibly impaired. Those talents, with the\npossession of which I have been flattered, will be of little avail when\nunsupported by respectability of character. My mamma, who knows too well\nthe distraction of my mind, endeavors to soothe and compose me on\nChristian principles; but they have not their desired effect. I dare not\nconverse freely with her on the subject of my present uneasiness, lest I\nshould distress her. I am therefore obliged to conceal my disquietude,\nand appear as cheerful as possible in her company, though my heart is\nready to burst with grief. O that you were near me, as formerly, to\nshare and alleviate my cares!. To have some friend in whom I could\nrepose confidence, and with whom I could freely converse and advise on\nthis occasion, would be an unspeakable comfort. Such a one, next to\nyourself, I think Julia Granby to be. With your leave and consent, I\nshould esteem it a special favor if she would come and spend a few\nmonths with me. My mamma joins in this request. I would write to her on\nthe subject, but cannot compose myself at present. Will you prefer my\npetition for me?\n\nIf I have not forfeited your friendship, my dear Mrs. Sumner, write to\nme, and pour its healing balm into the wounded mind of your\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n[Footnote A: See the two preceding letters.]\n\n\nLETTER XLIX.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nYour truly romantic letter came safe to hand. Indeed, my dear, it would\nmake a very pretty figure in a novel. A bleeding heart, slighted love,\nand all the _et ceteras_ of romance enter into the composition.\n\nExcuse this raillery, and I will now write more seriously. You refer\nyourself to my friendship for consolation. It shall be exerted for the\npurpose. But I must act the part of a skilful surgeon, and probe the\nwound which I undertake to heal.\n\nWhere, O Eliza Wharton, where is that fund of sense and sentiment which\nonce animated your engaging form? Where that strength of mind, that\nindependence of soul, that alacrity and sprightliness of deportment,\nwhich formerly raised you superior to every adverse occurrence? Why have\nyou resigned these valuable endowments, and suffered yourself to become\nthe sport of contending passions?\n\nYou have now emerged from that mist of fanciful folly which in a measure\nobscured the brilliance of your youthful days.\n\nTrue, you figured among the first-rate coquettes, while your friends,\nwho knew your accomplishments, lamented the misapplication of them; but\nnow they rejoice at the returning empire of reason.\n\nTrue, you have erred; misled by the gayety of your disposition, and that\nvolatility and inconsideration which were incident to your years; but\nyou have seen and nobly confessed your errors. Why do you talk of\nslighted love? True, Mr. Boyer, supposing you disregarded him,\ntransferred his affections to another object; but have you not your\nadmirers still among men of real merit? Are you not esteemed and\ncaressed by numbers who know you capable of shining in a distinguished\nsphere of life? Turn then, my friend, from the gloomy prospect which\nyour disturbed imagination has brought into view. Let reason and\nreligion erect their throne in your breast; obey their dictates, and be\nhappy. Past experience will point out the quicksands which you are to\navoid in your future course.\n\nDate then, from this, a new era of life; and may every moment be\nattended with felicity. Follow Mr. Boyer's advice and forget all former\nconnections.\n\nJulia accepts your invitation. Nothing short of your request could\ninduce me to part with her. She is a good girl, and her society will\namuse and instruct you. I am, &c.,\n\nLUCY SUMNER.\n\n\nLETTER L.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nMy Julia Granby has arrived. She is all that I once was--easy,\nsprightly, _debonnaire_. Already has she done much towards relieving my\nmind. She endeavors to divert and lead my thoughts into a different\nchannel from that to which they are now prone. Yesterday we had each an\ninvitation to a ball. She labored hard to prevail on me to go, but I\nobstinately refused. I cannot yet mix with gay and cheerful circles. I\ntherefore alleged that I was indisposed, and persuaded her to go without\nme.\n\nThe events of my life have always been unaccountably wayward. In many\ninstances I have been ready to suppose that some evil genius presided\nover my actions, which has directed them contrary to the sober dictates\nof my own judgment. I am sometimes tempted to adopt the sentiment\nexpressed in the following lines of the poet:--\n\n  \"To you, great gods, I make my last appeal;\n  O, clear my conscience, or my crimes reveal!\n  If wandering through the paths of life I've run,\n  And backward trod the steps I sought to shun,\n  Impute my errors to your own decree;\n  My feet were guilty, but my heart was free.\"\n\nI suppose you will tell me that the fate I accuse through the poet is\nonly the result of my own imprudence. Well, be it what it may,--either\nthe impulse of my own passions or some higher efficiency,--sure I am\nthat I pay dear for its operation.\n\nI have heard it remarked that experience is the preceptor of fools, but\nthat the wise need not its instruction. I believe I must be content to\nrank accordingly, and endeavor to reap advantage from its tuition.\n\nJulia urges me to revisit the scenes of amusements and pleasure, in\nwhich, she tells me, she is actuated by selfish motives. She wishes it\nfor her own sake. She likes neither to be secluded from them nor to go\nalone. I am sometimes half inclined to seek in festive mirth a refuge\nfrom thought and reflection. I would escape, if possible, from the idea\nof Mr. Boyer. This I have never been able to accomplish since he dropped\na tear upon my hand and left me. I marked the spot with my eye, and\ntwenty times in a day do I view it, and fondly imagine it still there.\nHow could I give him pain! I hope his happy Maria never will. I hope she\nwill reward that merit which I have slighted. But I forbear. This theme\ncarries away my pen if I but touch upon it. And no wonder, for it is the\nsole exercise of my thoughts. Yet I will endeavor to divert them. Send\nme some new books; not such, however, as will require much attention.\nLet them be plays and novels, or any thing else that will amuse or\nextort a smile. Julia and I have been rambling in the garden. She\ninsisted upon my going with her into the arbor, where I was surprised\nwith Major Sanford. What a crowd of painful ideas rushed upon my\nimagination! I believe she repented of her rashness. But no more of\nthis. I must lay aside my pen, for I can write nothing else.\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER LI.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nDear madam: You commanded me to write you respecting Miss Wharton, and I\nobey. But I cannot describe to you the surprising change which she has\nundergone. Her vivacity has certainly forsaken her; and she has actually\nbecome, what she once dreaded above all things, a recluse. She flies\nfrom company as eagerly as she formerly sought it; her mamma is\nexceedingly distressed by the settled melancholy which appears in her\ndarling child; but neither of us think it best to mention the subject to\nher. We endeavor to find means to amuse her; and we flatter ourselves\nthat the prospect of success rather increases. It would add greatly to\nmy happiness to contribute, in any degree, to restore her to herself, to\nher friends, and to society.\n\nWe are all invited to dine abroad to-morrow; and, to oblige me, she has\nconsented to go.\n\nPray, madam, write to her often. Your letters may do much for her. She\nis still feelingly alive to the power of friendship; and none can\nexercise it upon her to greater acceptance or with more advantage than\nyourself.\n\nMajor Sanford's house is undergoing a complete repair. The report is,\nthat he is soon to be married. Miss Wharton has heard, but does not\nbelieve it. I hope for her sake it will prove true; for, at any rate, he\nis about returning; and from her mamma's account of his past conduct\ntowards Eliza, were he to return unconnected, he would probably renew\nhis attentions; and though they might end in marriage, her happiness\nwould not be secured. She has too nice a sense of love and honor to\ncompound with his licentious principles. A man who has been dissolute\nbefore marriage will very seldom be faithful afterwards.\n\nI went into Eliza's chamber the other day, and found her with a\nminiature picture in her hand. \"You pretend to be a physiognomist,\nJulia,\" said she. \"What can you trace in that countenance?\" I guessed\nwhose it was; and looking wistfully at it, replied, \"I believe the\noriginal is an artful, designing man. He looks to me like a\nChesterfieldian. Pray who is he?\" \"Major Sanford,\" said she; \"and I am\nafraid you have hit his character exactly. Sure I am that the appearance\nof those traits in it has made my heart ache.\" She wept as she spoke it.\n\nPoor girl, I wish he may never give you greater cause to weep! She is\nstrongly blind to the vices and imperfections of this man. Though\nnaturally penetrating, he has somehow or other cast a deceptious mist\nover her imagination with respect to himself. She professes neither to\nlove nor esteem him, and owns that his ungenerous artifice misled her in\nher treatment of Mr. Boyer. Yet she has forgiven him, and thinks him a\npleasing companion.\n\nHow prone to error is the human mind! how much lighter than the breath\nof zephyrs the operations of fancy! Strange, then, it should ever\npreponderate over the weightier powers of the understanding.\n\nBut I will not moralize. My business here is to dissipate, not to\ncollect, ideas; and I must regulate myself accordingly.\n\nI am endeavoring to prepare Eliza, by degrees, to accompany me to Boston\nthe ensuing winter, but think it doubtful whether I shall succeed. I\nshall, however, return myself: till when, I am, &c.,\n\nJULIA GRANBY.\n\n\nLETTER LII.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nBOSTON.\n\nMy dear Eliza: I received yours of the 24th ult., and thank you for it,\nthough it did not afford me those lively sensations of pleasure which I\nusually feel at the perusal of your letters. It inspired me both with\nconcern and chagrin--with concern lest your dejection of mind should\naffect your health, and with chagrin at your apparent indulgence of\nmelancholy. Indeed, my friend, your own happiness and honor require you\nto dissipate the cloud which hangs over your imagination.\n\nRise then above it, and prove yourself superior to the adverse\noccurrences which have befallen you. It is by surmounting difficulties,\nnot by sinking under them, that we discover our fortitude. True courage\nconsists not in flying from the storms of life, but in braving and\nsteering through them with prudence. Avoid solitude. It is the bane of a\ndisordered mind, though of great utility to a healthy one. Your once\nfavorite amusements court your attention. Refuse not their\nsolicitations. I have contributed my mite by sending you a few books,\nsuch as you requested. They are of the lighter kind of reading, yet\nperfectly chaste, and, if I mistake not, well adapted to your taste.\n\nYou wish to hear from our theatre. I believe it will be well supplied\nwith performers this winter. Come and see whether they can afford you\nany entertainment. Last evening I attended a tragedy; but never will I\nattend another. I have not yet been able to erase the gloom which it\nimpressed upon my mind. It was Romeo and Juliet. Distressing enough to\nsensibility this! Are there not real woes (if not in our own families,\nat least among our own friends and neighbors) sufficient to exercise our\nsympathy and pity, without introducing fictitious ones into our very\ndiversions? How can that be a diversion which racks the soul with grief,\neven though that grief be imaginary? The introduction of a funeral\nsolemnity upon the stage is shocking indeed!\n\nDeath is too serious a matter to be sported with. An opening grave\ncannot be a source of amusement to any considerate mind. The closing\nscene of life can be no pastime when realized. It must therefore awaken\npainful sensations in the representation.\n\nThe circus is a place of fashionable resort of late, but not agreeable\nto-me. I think it inconsistent with the delicacy of a lady even to\nwitness the indecorums which are practised there, especially when the\nperformers of equestrian feats are of our own sex. To see a woman depart\nso far from the female character as to assume the masculine habit and\nattitude, and appear entirely indifferent even to the externals of\nmodesty, is truly disgusting, and ought not to be countenanced by our\nattendance, much less by our approbation. But, setting aside the\ncircumstance, I cannot conceive it to be a pleasure to sit a whole\nevening trembling with apprehension lest the poor wight of a horseman,\nor juggler, or whatever he is to be called, should break his neck in\ncontributing to our entertainment.\n\nWith Mr. Bowen's museum I think you were much pleased. He has made a\nnumber of judicious additions to it since you were here. It is a source\nof rational and refined amusement. Here the eye is gratified, the\nimagination charmed, and the understanding improved. It will bear\nfrequent reviews without palling on the taste. It always affords\nsomething new; and, for one, I am never a weary spectator. Our other\npublic and private places of resort are much as you left them.\n\nI am happy in my present situation; but when the summer returns, I\nintend to visit my native home. Again, my Eliza, will we ramble together\nin those retired shades which friendship has rendered so delightful to\nus. Adieu, my friend, till then. Be cheerful, and you will yet be happy.\n\nLUCY SUMNER.\n\n\nLETTER LIII.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nGracious Heaven! What have I heard? Major Sanford is married! Yes; the\nungrateful, the deceitful wretch is married. He has forsworn, he has\nperjured and given himself to another. That, you will say, is nothing\nstrange. It is characteristic of the man. It may be so; but I could not\nbe convinced of his perfidy till now.\n\nPerhaps it is all for the best. Perhaps, had he remained unconnected, he\nmight still have deceived me; but now I defy his arts.\n\nThey tell me he has married a woman of fortune. I suppose he thinks, as\nI once did, that wealth can insure happiness. I wish he may enjoy it.\n\nThis event would not affect me at all were it not for the depression of\nspirits which I feel in consequence of a previous disappointment; since\nwhich every thing of the kind agitates and overcomes me. I will not see\nhim. If I do, I shall betray my weakness, and flatter his vanity, as he\nwill doubtless think he has the power of mortifying me by his\nconnection with another.\n\nBefore this news discomposed me, I had attained to a good degree of\ncheerfulness. Your kind letter, seconded by Julia's exertions, had\nassisted me in regulating my sensibility. I have been frequently into\ncompany, and find my relish for it gradually returning.\n\nI intend to accept the pleasure, to which you invite me, of spending a\nlittle time with you this winter. Julia and I will come together.\nVarying the scene may contribute effectually to dissipate the gloom of\nmy imagination. I would fly to almost any resort rather than my own\nmind. What a dreadful thing it is to be afraid of one's own reflections,\nwhich ought to be a constant source of enjoyment! But I will not\nmoralize. I am sufficiently melancholy without any additional cause to\nincrease it.\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER LIV.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nDear Deighton: Who do you think is writing to you? Why, it is your old\nfriend, metamorphosed into a _married man_! You stare, and can hardly\ncredit the assertion. I cannot realize it myself; yet I assure you,\nCharles, it is absolutely true. Necessity, dire necessity, forced me\ninto this dernier resort. I told you some time ago it would come to\nthis.\n\nI stood aloof as long as possible; but in vain did I attempt to shun the\nnoose. I must either fly to this resource or give up all my show,\nequipage, and pleasure, and degenerate into a downright, plodding money\ncatcher for a subsistence. I chose the first; and who would not? Yet I\nfeel some remorse at taking the girl to wife from no better motives. She\nis really too good for such an imposition. But she must blame herself if\nshe suffer hereafter; for she was visibly captivated by my external\nappearance, and wanted but very little solicitation to confer herself\nand fortune on so charming a fellow. Her parents opposed her inclination\nfor a while, because I was a stranger, and rather too gay for their\ntaste. But she had not been used to contradiction, and could not bear\nit, and therefore they ventured not to cross her. So I bore off the\nprize; and a prize she really is--five thousand pounds in possession,\nand more in reversion, if I do not forfeit it. This will compensate for\nsome of my past mistakes, and set matters right for the present. I think\nit doing much better than to have taken the little Lawrence girl I told\nyou of with half the sum. Besides, my Nancy is a handsomer and more\nagreeable person; but that is of little consequence to me, you know.\n\"Beauty soon grows familiar to the lover.\" Were I a lover, it would be\nof no great avail. A lover I am, yet not of my wife. The dart which I\nreceived from Miss Wharton sticks fast in my heart; and, I assure you, I\ncould hardly persuade myself even to appear unfaithful to her. O Eliza!\naccuse me not of infidelity; for your image is my constant companion. A\nthousand times have I cursed the unpropitious stars which withheld from\nher a fortune. That would have enabled me to marry her; and with her\neven wedlock would have been supportable.\n\nI am told that she is still single. Her sober lover never returned. Had\nhe loved as I did, and do, he could not have been so precipitate. But\nthese stoic souls are good for nothing, that I know of, but,\n\n  \"Fixed, like a plant, to one peculiar spot,\n  To draw nutrition, propagate, and rot.\"\n\nI want to see Eliza, and I must see her; yet I dread an interview. I\nshall frankly confess my motives for marrying, and the reasons of my\nconduct before I went away. I shall own that my circumstances would not\nallow me to possess her, and yet that I could not resign her to another.\n\nWhen I make up the matter with her, I shall solicit her friendship for\nmy wife. By this means I may enjoy her society, at least, which will\nalleviate the confinement of a married state. To my spouse I must be as\ncivil as possible. I really wish she had less merit, that I might have a\nplausible excuse for neglecting her.\n\nTo-morrow I shall go to Mrs. Wharton's. I am very much taken up with\ncomplimental visits at present. What deference is always paid to\nequipage! They may talk of their virtue, their learning, and what not;\nbut, without either of them, I shall bear off the palm of respect from\nthose who have them, unadorned with gold and its shining appendages.\n\nEvery thing hereabouts recalls Eliza to my mind. I impatiently\nanticipate the hour which will convey me to her presence.\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER LV.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nA new scene has opened upon us to-day, my dear Mrs. Sumner--a visit from\nMajor Sanford. My mamma, Miss Granby, and myself were sitting together\nin the chamber. Miss Granby was entertaining us by reading aloud in\nMillot's Elements of History, when a servant rapped at the door, and\nhanded in the following billet:--\n\n\"Will Miss Wharton condescend to converse a few moments with her\nonce-favored Sanford? He is but too sensible that he has forfeited all\nclaim to the privilege. He therefore presumes not to request it on the\nscore of merit, nor of former acquaintance, but solicits it from her\nbenevolence and pity.\"\n\nI read and showed it to my mamma and Julia. \"What,\" said I, \"shall I do?\nI wish not to see him. His artifice has destroyed my peace of mind, and\nhis presence may open the wounds which time is closing.\" \"Act,\" said my\nmamma, \"agreeably to the dictates of your own judgment.\" \"I see no harm\nin conversing with him,\" said Julia. \"Perhaps it may remove some\ndisagreeable thoughts which now oppress and give you pain. And as he is\nno longer a candidate for your affections,\" added she with a smile, \"it\nwill be less hazardous than formerly. He will not have the insolence to\nspeak, nor you the folly to hear, the language of love.\"\n\nHe was accordingly invited in. When I rose to go down, I hesitated, and\neven trembled. \"I fear,\" said I to myself, \"it will be too much for me;\nyet why should it? Conscious innocence will support me. This he has\nnot.\" When I entered the room he stepped forward to meet me. Confusion\nand shame were visibly depicted in his countenance. He approached me\nhastily and without uttering a word, took my hand. I withdrew it. \"O\nMiss Wharton,\" said he, \"despise me not. I am convinced that I deserve\nyour displeasure and disdain; but my own heart has avenged your cause.\"\n\"To your own heart, then,\" said I, \"I will leave you. But why do you\nagain seek an interview with one whom you have endeavored to\nmislead--with one whom you have treated with unmerited neglect?\"\n\n\"Justice to myself required my appearing before you, that, by confessing\nmy faults and obtaining your forgiveness, I might soften the reproaches\nof my own mind.\" \"Will you be seated, sir?\" said I. \"Will you,\" rejoined\nhe, \"condescend to sit with me, Eliza?\" \"I will, sir,\" answered I \"The\nrights of hospitality I shall not infringe. In my own house, therefore,\nI shall treat you with civility.\" \"Indeed,\" said he, \"you are very\nsevere; but I have provoked all the coldness and reserve which you can\ninflict.\n\n\"I am a married man, Eliza.\" \"So I understand,\" said I; \"and I hope you\nwill never treat your wife with that dissimulation and falsehood which\nyou have exercised towards me.\" \"Would to Heaven,\" exclaimed he, \"that\nyou were my wife. I should not, then, fail in my love or duty as a\nhusband; yet she is an amiable girl, and, had I a heart to give her, I\nmight still be happy; but that, alas! I can never recall.\" \"Why, then,\"\nsaid I, \"did you marry her? You were, doubtless, master of your own\nactions.\" \"No,\" said he, \"I was not. The embarrassed state of my affairs\nprecluded the possibility of acting as I wished. Loving you most\nardently, I was anxious to prevent your union with another, till I could\nso far improve my circumstances as to secure you from poverty and want\nin a connection with me. My regard was too sincere to permit me to\ndeceive you by a marriage which might have proved unhappy for us both.\nMy pride forbade my telling you the motives of my delay; and I left you\nto see if I could place myself in a situation worthy of your acceptance.\nThis I could not effect, and, therefore, have run the risk of my future\nhappiness by marrying a lady of affluence. This secures to me the\nexternals of enjoyment, but my heart, I fear, will never participate it;\nyet it affords me some degree of satisfaction that I have not involved\nyou in distress. The only alleviation of which my banishment from you is\ncapable, is your forgiveness. In compassion, then, refuse it not. It\ncannot injure you. To me it will be worth millions.\" He wept. Yes, Lucy,\nthis libertine, this man of pleasure and gallantly, wept. I really\npitied him from my heart. \"I forgive you,\" said I, \"and wish you happy;\nyet on this condition only, that you never again pollute my ears with\nthe recital of your infamous passion. Yes, infamous I call it; for what\nsofter appellation can be given to such professions from a married man?\nHarbor not an idea of me, in future, inconsistent with the love and\nfidelity which you owe your wife; much less presume to mention it, if\nyou wish not to be detested by me, and forever banished from my\npresence.\" He expressed gratitude for his absolution, even upon these\nterms, and hoped his future conduct would entitle him to my friendship\nand esteem. \"That,\" I replied, \"time only can determine.\"\n\nOne favor more he begged leave to solicit; which was, that I would be a\nneighbor to his wife. \"She was a stranger,\" he said, \"and would deem my\nsociety a particular privilege.\" This, I told him, I could not grant at\npresent, whatever I might do hereafter. He did not urge it any further,\nbut inquired after my mamma, and expressed a wish to see her. I rang the\nbell, and ordered her and Miss Granby to be called. When they came he\nwas very polite to them both, and, after usual compliments, told my\nmamma that he was happy in having obtained my forgiveness, to which he\nwas anxious to have her seal affixed. \"My daughter,\" said she, \"is the\ninjured party; and if she be satisfied, I shall not complain.\" He\nthanked her for her condescension, informed her that he was married, and\nrequested her to visit his wife. We then conversed upon different\nsubjects for a short time, and he took his leave. A sigh escaped him as\nhe departed, and a gloom was visible in his countenance which I never\nobserved before.\n\nI must acknowledge that this interview has given me satisfaction. I have\noften told you, that if I married Major Sanford, it would be from a\npredilection for his situation in life. How wretched must have been my\nlot, had I discovered, too late, that he was by no means possessed of\nthe independence which I fondly anticipated! I knew not my own heart,\nwhen I contemplated a connection with him. Little did I think that my\nregard for Mr. Boyer was so deeply rooted as I now find it. I foolishly\nimagined that I could turn my affections into what channel I pleased.\nWhat, then, must have been my feelings, when I found myself deprived\nboth of inward peace and outward enjoyment! I begin now to emerge from\nthe darkness in which I have been long benighted. I hope the tragic\ncomedy, in which I have acted so conspicuous a part, will come to a\nhappy end.\n\nJulia and I talk, now and then, of a journey to Boston. As yet, I have\nnot resolution to act with much decision upon the subject; but, wherever\nI am, and whatever may be my fate, I shall always be yours in truth,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER LVI.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nI begin to hope we shall come to rights here by and by. Major Sanford\nhas returned, has made us a visit, and a treaty of peace and amity (but\nnot of commerce) is ratified. Eliza appears to be rapidly returning to\nher former cheerfulness--if not gayety. I hope she will not diverge too\nfar from her present sedateness and solidity; yet I am not without\napprehensions of danger on that score. One extreme commonly succeeds\nanother. She tells me that she assiduously cultivates her natural\nvivacity; that she finds her taste for company and amusements\nincreasing; that she dreads being alone, because past scenes arise to\nview which vex and discompose her.\n\nThese are indications of a mind not perfectly right. I flatter myself,\nhowever, that the time is not far distant when her passions will vibrate\nwith regularity.\n\nI need not repeat to you any thing relative to Major Sanford's\nconciliatory visit. Eliza has given you a particular, and, I believe, a\nfaithful detail. I was called down to see this wonderful man, and\ndisliked him exceedingly. I am astonished that Eliza's penetrating eye\nhas not long since read his vices in his very countenance. I am told by\na friend, who has visited them, that he has an agreeable wife; and I\nwish she may find him a husband of the same description; but I very much\ndoubt the accomplishment of my wish, for I have no charity for these\nreformed rakes.\n\nWe were walking abroad the other afternoon, and met Major Sanford and\nlady. Eliza did not see them till they were very near us. She started,\nturned pale, and then colored like crimson. I cannot but think a little\nenvy rankled in her heart. Major Sanford very politely accosted us, and\ncongratulated Mrs. Sanford on this opportunity of introducing her to a\nparticular friend, presenting Eliza. She received her with an easy\ndignity, and bade her welcome to this part of the country. Mrs. Sanford\nanswered her modestly, hoped for the pleasure of a further acquaintance,\nand urged us, as we were not far from their house, to return with them\nto tea. We declined, and wishing each other good evening, parted. Major\nSanford's eyes were riveted on Eliza the whole time we were together,\nand he seemed loath to remove them when we separated. I suspect there is\nsome truth in his tale of love. I shall therefore discourage Eliza from\nassociating with him under any pretext whatever. She appeared more\npensive and thoughtful than common as we returned home, and said little\nthe rest of the evening, but next morning was as chatty as ever.\n\nShe is warm in the praises of Mrs. Sanford, thinks her an accomplished\nwoman, and wonders that the major could suggest an idea of marrying her\nfor her money. She intends, she says, to visit her soon, and wishes me\nto accompany her. This, for her own sake, I shall defer as long as\npossible. I am, &c.,\n\nJULIA GRANBY.\n\n\nLETTER LVII.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nBy Julia's advice we have neglected the repeated invitations of Major\nSanford to visit and commence neighborhood with them till yesterday,\nwhen we received a polite billet requesting the honor of our company to\ndine. My mamma declined going, but said she had no objection to our\ncompliance with the message if we thought proper. Julia and I\naccordingly went. We found a large company assembled in a spacious hall,\nsplendidly furnished and decorated. They were all very polite and\nattentive to me, but none more so than Major Sanford and his lady, who\njointly strove to dissipate the pensiveness of my mind, which I found it\nimpossible to conceal. When we were summoned to dinner, the major, being\nnear me, offered his hand, and, leading me into the dining room, seated\nme at a table furnished with all the variety which could please the eye\nor regale the taste of the most luxurious epicure. The conversation\nturned on various subjects--literary, political, and miscellaneous. In\nthe evening we had a ball. Major Sanford gave the hand of his wife to a\nMr. Grey, alleging that he was a stranger, and therefore entitled to\nparticular attention, and then solicited mine himself. I was on the\npoint of refusing him, but recollecting that it might have the\nappearance of continued resentment, contrary to my declaration of\nforgiving what was past, I complied. He was all kindness and assiduity;\nthe more so, I imagined, with a view to make amends for his former\ningratitude and neglect. Tenderness is now peculiarly soothing to my\nwounded heart. He took an opportunity of conversing with his wife and me\ntogether, hoped she would be honored with my friendship and\nacquaintance, and begged for her sake that I would not be a stranger at\nhis house. His Nancy, he said, was far removed from her maternal\nfriends, but I could supply their place if I would generously undertake\nthe task. She joined in expressing the same sentiments and wishes.\n\"Alas! sir,\" said I, \"Eliza Wharton is not now what she once was. I\nlabor under a depression of spirits which must render my company rather\npainful than pleasing to my friends.\" The idea of what I had been,\ncontrasted with what I then was, touched my sensibility, and I could not\nrestrain the too officious tear from stealing down my cheek. He took me\nby the hand, and said, \"You distress me, Miss Wharton; indeed you\ndistress me. Happiness must and shall attend you. Cursed be the wretch\nwho could wound a heart like yours.\"\n\nJulia Granby now joined us. An inquisitive concern was visible in her\ncountenance.\n\nI related this conversation to her after we returned home; but she\napproved it not.\n\nShe thought Major Sanford too particularly attentive to me, considering\nwhat had previously happened. She said it would be noticed by others,\nand the world would make unfavorable remarks upon any appearance of\nintimacy between us. \"I care not for that,\" said I; \"it is an\nill-natured, misjudging world, and I am not obliged to sacrifice my\nfriends to its opinion. Were Major Sanford a single man, I should avoid\nhis society; but since he is married, since his wife is young,\nbeautiful, and lovely, he can have no temptation to injure me. I\ntherefore see no evil which can arise from the cultivation of friendship\nwith her at least. I relish company so little, that I may surely be\nindulged in selecting that which is most agreeable to my taste, to\nprevent my becoming quite a misanthrope.\" I thank you, my dear Mrs.\nSumner, for your kind letter. It was a seasonable cordial to my mind,\nand I will endeavor to profit by your advice. Your remarks on the public\nentertainments are amusing, and, as far as I am a judge, perfectly\njust. I think it a pity they have not female managers for the theatre. I\nbelieve it would be under much better regulations than at present.\n\nWith cordial respects to Mr. Sumner, I subscribe myself, yours in\nsincerity,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER LVIII.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nRejoice with me, my friend, that I have made my peace with the mistress\nof my heart. No devotee could have been more sincere in his penitence\nthan I was in mine. Indeed, Charles, I never knew I had so much\nsensibility before. Why, I was as much a woman as the very weakest of\nthe sex.\n\nBut I dealt very plainly and sincerely with her, to be sure; and this\natones for all past offences, and procures absolution for many others\nyet to be committed.\n\nThe dear girl was not inexorable; she was as placable and condescending\nas I could expect, considering the nature of the crime, which was\napparently slighting her person and charms by marrying another. This,\nyou know, is one of the nicest points with the ladies. Attack their\nhonor, that is, their chastity, and they construe it to be the effect of\nexcessive love, which hurries you a little beyond the bounds of\nprudence. But touch their vanity by preferring another, and they will\nseldom pardon you. You will say I am very severe upon the sex; and have\nI not reason to be so, since I have found so many frail ones among them?\nThis, however, is departing from my subject.\n\nEliza is extremely altered. Her pale, dejected countenance, with the\nsedateness of her manners, so different from the lively glow of health,\ncheerfulness, and activity which formerly animated her appearance and\ndeportment, struck me very disagreeably.\n\nWith all my gallantry and fluency in love matters, I was unable to\nacquit myself tolerably, or to address her with any degree of ease and\nconfidence. She was very calm, and spoke with great indifference about\nmy marriage, &c., which mortified me exceedingly. Yet I cannot consent\nto believe that her present depression of spirits arises solely from\nMr. Boyer's infidelity. I flatter myself that I am of sufficient\nconsequence to her to have contributed in a degree.\n\nWhen I inquired after her health, she told me she had been indisposed;\nbut was now much better. This indisposition, I am informed, was purely\nmental; and I am happy to observe her recovering from it. I frequently\nvisit her, sometimes with and sometimes without my wife, of whom,\nthrough my mediation, she has become a favorite. I have married, and\naccording to the general opinion reformed. Yet I suspect my reformation,\nlike most others of the kind, will prove instable as \"the baseless\nfabric of a vision,\" unless I banish myself entirely from her society.\nBut that I can never do; for she is still lovely in my eyes, and I\ncannot control my passions.\n\nWhen absent from her I am lost to every thing but her idea. My wife\nbegins to rally me on my fondness for Miss Wharton. She asked me the\nother day if she had a fortune. \"No,\" said I; \"if she had I should have\nmarried her.\" This wounded her sensibility. I repented of my sincerity,\nand made my peace for that time. Yet I find myself growing extremely\nirritable, and she must take heed how she provokes me; for I do not love\nher, and I think the name of wife becomes more and more distasteful to\nme every day.\n\nIn my mind, Eliza has no competitor. But I must keep up appearances,\nthough I endeavor to regain her love. I imagine that the enjoyment of\nher society as a neighbor and friend may content me for the present, and\nrender my condition supportable.\n\nFarewell, Charles. I hope you will never be embarrassed with a wife, nor\nlack some favorite nymph to supply the place of one.\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER LIX.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nDear Lucy: I intended this week to have journeyed to Boston with Julia\nGranby; but my resolution fails me. I find it painful even to think of\nmixing again with the gay multitude. I believe the melancholy\nreflections by which I am oppressed will be more effectually, if not\nmore easily, surmounted by tarrying where they are rendered familiar,\nthan by going from them awhile and then returning.\n\nJulia will therefore go without me. I envy her no enjoyment there,\nexcept your company.\n\nThe substitution of friendship, in the place of love, for Major Sanford,\nI find productive of agreeable sensations. With him, he assures me, it\nis a far more calm and rational pleasure. _He_ treats me with the\naffection and tenderness of a brother, and his _wife,_ who exceeds him\nin professions of regard, with all the consoling softness and attention\nof a sister. Indeed, their politeness has greatly contributed to revive\nthe cheerfulness of my natural disposition. I believe the major's former\npartiality to me as a lover is entirely obliterated; and for my part, I\nfeel as little restraint in his company and his lady's as in that of any\nother in the neighborhood.\n\nI very much regret the departure of Julia, and hope you will permit her\nto return to me again as soon as possible. She is a valuable friend. Her\nmind is well cultivated, and she has treasured up a fund of knowledge\nand information which renders her company both agreeable and useful in\nevery situation of life. We lately spent the afternoon and evening at\nMr. Smith's. They had a considerable number of visitants, and among the\nrest Major Sanford. His wife was expected, but did not come, being\nindisposed.\n\n\nI believe, my friend, you must excuse me if my letters are shorter than\nformerly. Writing is not so agreeable to me as it used to be. I love my\nfriends as well as ever, but I think they must be weary of the gloom and\ndulness which pervade my present correspondence. When my pen shall have\nregained its original fluency and alertness, I will resume and prolong\nthe pleasing task.\n\nI am, my dear Lucy, yours most affectionately,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER LX.\n\nTO THE SAME.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nDear madam: Agreeably to your desire every art has been tried, every\nallurement held out, every argument used, and every plan adopted, which\nMrs. Wharton and I could devise to induce Eliza to accompany me to\nBoston; but all in vain. Sometimes she has been almost persuaded to a\ncompliance with our united request, but soon has resolutely determined\nagainst it. I have observed her sentiments to be suddenly changed after\nbeing in company with Major Sanford. This alarms us exceedingly. Indeed,\nthe major seems to have insinuated himself into her good opinion more\nthan ever. She is flattered into the belief that his attention to her is\npurely the result of friendship and benevolence.\n\nI have not so favorable an opinion of the man as to suppose him capable\nof either. He has become very familiar here. He calls in almost every\nday. Sometimes he but just inquires after our health, and sometimes\nmakes long visits. The latter is his invariable practice when he finds\nEliza alone. Mrs. Wharton always avoids seeing him if she can. She\ndreads, she says, his approaching the house.\n\nI entered the parlor the other day, somewhat suddenly, and found him\nsitting very near Eliza, in a low conversation. They both rose in\napparent confusion, and he soon retired.\n\nWhen he was gone, \"I suspect,\" said I, \"that the major was whispering a\ntale of love, Eliza.\" \"Do you imagine,\" said she, \"that I would listen\nto such a theme from a married man?\" \"I hope not,\" said I, \"but his\nconduct towards you indicates a revival of his former sentiments, at\nleast.\" \"I was not aware of that,\" said she. \"As yet I have observed\nnothing in his behavior to me inconsistent with the purest friendship.\"\n\nWe drank tea not long since at Mr. Smith's. Late in the afternoon Major\nSanford made his appearance, to apologize, as he said, for Mrs. Sanford,\nwho was indisposed, and could not enjoy the pleasure of the visit she\nhad contemplated. He was very gay the whole evening; and when the\ncompany separated, he was the first to present his arm to Eliza, who\naccepted it without hesitation. A Mr. Newhall attended me, and we\nendeavored to keep them company; but they evidently chose to walk by\nthemselves. Mr. Newhall observed, that if Major Sanford were not married\nhe should suspect he still intended a union with Miss Wharton. I\nreplied, that their former intercourse, having terminated in friendship,\nrendered them more familiar with each other than with the generality of\ntheir acquaintance.\n\nWhen we reached the house, Mr. Newhall chose not to go in, and took his\nleave. I waited at the door for Eliza and Major Sanford. At some little\ndistance, I saw him press her hand to his lips. It vexed me exceedingly;\nand no sooner had they come up, than I sullenly bade them good night,\nand walked directly in. Eliza soon followed me. I sat down by the fire\nin a thoughtful posture. She did the same. In this situation we both\nremained for some time without speaking a word. At length she said, \"You\nseem not to have enjoyed your walk, Miss Granby: did you not like your\ngallant?\" \"Yes,\" said I, \"very well; but I am mortified that you were\nnot better provided for.\" \"I make no complaint,\" rejoined she; \"I was\nvery well entertained.\" \"That is what displeases me,\" said I; \"I mean\nyour visible fondness for the society of such a man. Were you averse to\nit, as you ought to be, there would be no danger. But he has an alluring\ntongue and a treacherous heart. How can you be pleased and entertained\nby his conversation? To me it appears totally repugnant to that\nrefinement and delicacy for which you have always been esteemed.\n\n\"His assiduity and obtrusion ought to alarm you. You well know what his\ncharacter has been. Marriage has not changed his disposition. It is only\na cloak which conceals it. Trust him not, then, my dear Eliza; if you\ndo, depend upon it you will find his professions of friendship to be\nmere hypocrisy and deceit. I fear that he is acting over again the same\nunworthy arts which formerly misled you. Beware of his wiles. Your\nfriends are anxious for you. They tremble at your professed regard and\napparent intimacy with that unprincipled man.\" \"My friends,\" said she,\n\"are very jealous of me lately. I know not how I have forfeited their\nconfidence, or incurred their suspicion.\" \"By encouraging that\nattention,\" I warmly replied, \"and receiving those caresses, from a\nmarried man which are due from him to none but his wife. He is a villain\nif he deceived her into marriage by insincere professions of love. If he\nhad then an affection for her, and has already discarded it, he is\nequally guilty. Can _you_ expect sincerity from the man who withholds it\nfrom an amiable and deserving wife? No, Eliza; it is not love which\ninduces him to entertain you with the subject. It is a baser passion;\nand if you disdain not his artifice, if you listen to his flattery, you\nwill, I fear, fall a victim to his evil machinations. If he conducted\nlike a man of honor, he would merit your esteem; but his behavior is\nquite the reverse: yet, vile as he is, he would not dare to lisp his\ninsolent hopes of your regard if you punished his presumption with the\nindignation it deserves; if you spurned from your presence the\nungrateful wretch who would requite your condescension by triumphing in\nyour ruin.\"\n\nShe now burst into tears, and begged me to drop the subject. Her mind,\nshe said, was racked by her own reflections. She could bear but little.\nKindness deceived, and censure distressed her.\n\nI assured her of my good intentions; that, as I saw her danger, I\nthought it a duty of the friendship and affection I bore her solemnly to\nwarn her against it before we parted. We talked over the matter more\ncalmly, till she professed herself resolved in future to avoid his\ncompany, and reject his insinuations.\n\nThe next day, as I walked out, I met Major Sanford. He accosted me very\ncivilly. I barely bade him good morning, and passed on.\n\nI made it in my way to call at his house, and bid Mrs. Sanford adieu;\nnot expecting another opportunity equally favorable. When I entered the\nparlor, she was playing a melancholy air on the harpsichord. She rose,\nand gave me a polite and graceful reception. I told her, as I was soon\nto leave the town, I called to take my leave of her--a compliment which\nher attention to me required. \"Are you going to leave us then, Miss\nGranby?\" said she. \"I shall regret your departure exceedingly. I have so\nfew friends in this part of the country, that it will give me sensible\npain to part with one I so highly value.\"\n\nI told her, in the course of conversation, that I expected the pleasure\nof seeing her yesterday at Mr. Smith's, and was very sorry for the\nindisposition which prevented her favoring us with her company.\n\"Indeed,\" said she, \"I did not know I was expected there. Were you\nthere, pray?\" \"Yes,\" said I; \"and Major Sanford excused your not coming,\non the account I have mentioned.\" \"Well,\" said she, \"this is the first\nword that I ever heard about it; he told me that business led him\nabroad. Did he gallant any lady?\" \"O,\" said I, \"he was with us all\ntogether. We had no particular gallants.\"\n\nSeeing her curiosity excited, I heartily repented saying any thing of\nthe matter, and waived the subject. Little did I suspect him to have\nbeen guilty of so base an artifice. It was evidently contrived to\nfacilitate an interview with Eliza.\n\nWhen I returned, I related this affair to Mrs. Wharton and her daughter.\nThe old lady and I expatiated largely on the vileness of this conduct,\nand endeavored to expose it to Eliza's view in its true colors. She\npretended not to justify it; yet she looked as if she wished it in her\npower.\n\nI am now preparing for my journey to Boston, which I must, however,\ndefer another week for the sake of a more agreeable passage in the\nstage. I regret leaving Eliza. I tremble at her danger. She has not the\nresolution to resist temptation which she once possessed. Her mind is\nsurprisingly weakened. She appears sensible of this, yet adds to it by\nyielding to her own imbecility. You will receive a letter from her with\nthis, though I had much difficulty to persuade her to write. She has\nunfortunately become very averse to this, her once favorite amusement.\n\nAs I shall soon have the pleasure of conversing with you personally, I\nconclude without any other addition to this scrawl than the name of your\nobliged\n\nJULIA GRANBY.\n\n\nLETTER LXI.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nBOSTON.\n\nMy dear friend: I have received your letters, and must own to you that\nthe perusal of them gave me pain. Pardon my suspicions, Eliza; they are\nexcited by real friendship. Julia, you say, approves not Major Sanford's\nparticular attention to you. Neither do I. If you recollect and examine\nhis conversation in his conciliatory visit, you will find it replete\nwith sentiments for the avowal of which he ought to be banished from all\nvirtuous society.\n\nDoes he not insidiously declare that you are the only object of his\naffections; that his union with another was formed from interested\nviews; and, though that other is acknowledged to be amiable and\nexcellent, still he has not a heart to bestow, and expects not happiness\nwith her? Does this discover even the appearance of amendment? Has he\nnot, by false pretensions, misled a virtuous woman, and induced her to\nform a connection with him? She was a stranger to his manner of life,\nand doubtless allured, as you have been, by flattery, deceit, and\nexternal appearance, to trust his honor, little thinking him wholly\ndevoid of that sacred tie. What is the reward of her confidence?\nInsensibility to her charms, neglect of her person, and professed\nattachment to another!\n\nIs he a man, my dear Eliza, whose friendship you wish to cultivate? Can\nthat heavenly passion reside in a breast which is the seat of treachery,\nduplicity, and ingratitude? You are too sensible of its purity and worth\nto suppose it possible. The confessions of his own mouth condemn him.\nThey convince me that he is still the abandoned libertine, and that\nmarriage is but the cloak of his intrigues. His officious attentions to\nyou are alarming to your friends. Your own mind weakened, and peculiarly\nsusceptible of tender impressions, beware how you receive them from\nhim. Listen not a moment to his flattering professions; it is an insult\nupon your understanding for him to offer them; it is derogatory to\nvirtue for you to hear them.\n\nSlight not the opinion of the world. We are dependent beings; and while\nthe smallest traces of virtuous sensibility remain, we must feel the\nforce of that dependence in a greater or less degree. No female, whose\nmind is uncorrupted, can be indifferent to reputation. It is an\ninestimable jewel, the loss of which can never be repaired. While\nretained, it affords conscious peace to our own minds, and insures the\nesteem and respect of all around us.\n\nBlessed with the company of so disinterested and faithful a friend as\nJulia Granby, some deference is certainly due to her opinion and advice.\nTo an enlarged understanding, a cultivated taste, and an extensive\nknowledge of the world, she unites the most liberal sentiments with a\nbenevolence and candor of disposition, which render her equally\ndeserving of your confidence and affection.\n\nI cannot relinquish my claim to a visit from you this winter. Marriage\nhas not alienated nor weakened my regard for my friends. Come, then, to\nyour faithful Lucy. Have you sorrows? I will soothe and alleviate them.\nHave you cares? I will dispel them. Have you pleasures? I will heighten\nthem. Come, then, let me fold you to my expecting heart. My happiness\nwill be partly suspended till your society renders it complete. Adieu.\n\nLUCY SUMNER.\n\n\nLETTER LXII.\n\nTO MISS JULIA GRANBY.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nDear Julia: I hope Mrs. Sumner and you will excuse my writing but one\nletter in answer to the number I have received from you both. Writing is\nan employment which suits me not at present. It was pleasing to me\nformerly, and therefore, by recalling the idea of circumstances and\nevents which frequently occupied my pen in happier days, it now gives me\npain. Yet I have just written a long consolatory letter to Mrs. Richman.\nShe has buried, her babe--her little Harriet, of whom she was dotingly\nfond.\n\nIt was a custom with some of the ancients, we are told, to weep at the\nbirth of their children. Often should we be impelled to a compliance\nwith this custom, could we foresee the future incidents of their lives.\nI think, at least, that the uncertainty of their conduct and condition\nin more advanced age may reconcile us to their removal to a happier\nstate before they are capable of tasting the bitterness of woe.\n\n  \"Happy the babe, who, privileged by fate\n  To shorter labors and a lighter weight,\n  Received but yesterday the gift of breath,\n  Ordered to-morrow to return to death.\"\n\nOur domestic affairs are much as when you left us. Nothing remarkable\nhas occurred in the neighborhood worth communicating. The company and\namusements of the town are as usual, I suppose. I frequent neither of\nthem. Having incurred so much censure by the indulgence of a gay\ndisposition, I am now trying what a recluse and solitary mode of life\nwill, produce. You will call me splenetic. I own it. I am pleased with\nnobody; still less with myself. I look around for happiness, and find it\nnot. The world is to me a desert. If I indulge myself in temporary\nenjoyment, the consciousness or apprehension of doing amiss destroys my\npeace of mind. And when I have recourse to books, if I read those of\nserious descriptions, they remind me of an awful futurity, for which I\nam unprepared; if history, it discloses facts in which I have no\ninterest; if novels, they exhibit scenes of pleasure which I have no\nprospect of realizing.\n\nMy mamma is solicitously attentive to my happiness; and though she fails\nof promoting it, yet I endeavor to save her the pangs of disappointment\nby appearing what she wishes.\n\nI anticipate, and yet I dread, your return; a paradox this, which time\nalone can solve.\n\nContinue writing to me, and entreat Mrs. Sumner, in my name, to do\nlikewise. Your benevolence must be your reward.\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER LXIII.\n\nTO MISS ELIZA WHARTON.\n\nBOSTON.\n\nA paradox, indeed, is the greater part of your letter to us, my dear\nEliza. We had fondly flattered ourselves that the melancholy of your\nmind was exterminated. I hope no new cause has revived it. Little did I\nintend, when I left you, to have been absent so long; but Mrs. Summer's\ndisappointment, in her plan of spending the summer at Hartford, induced\nme, in compliance with her request, to prolong my residence here. But\nfor your sake, she now consents to my leaving her, in hopes I may be so\nhappy as to contribute to your amusement.\n\nI am both pleased and instructed by the conduct of this amiable woman.\nAs I always endeavored to imitate her discreet, and modest behavior in a\nsingle state, so likewise shall I take her for a pattern should I ever\nenter a married life. She is most happily united. Mr. Sumner, to all the\ngraces and accomplishments of the gentleman, adds the still more\nimportant and essential properties of virtue, integrity, and honor. I\nwas once present when a person was recommended to her for a husband. She\nobjected that he was a rake. \"True,\" said the other, \"he has been, but\nhe has reformed.\" \"That will never do for me,\" rejoined she; \"I wish my\nfuture companion to need no reformation\"--a sentiment worthy the\nattention of our whole sex; the general adoption of which, I am\npersuaded, would have a happy influence upon the manners of the other.\n\nI hope neither you nor I, Eliza, shall ever be tried by a man of\ndebauched principles. Such characters I conceive to be totally unfit\nfor the society of women who have any claim to virtue and delicacy.\n\nI intend to be with you in about a month. If agreeable to you, we will\nvisit and spend a few weeks with the afflicted Mrs. Richman. I sincerely\nsympathize with her under her bereavement. I know her fondness for you\nwill render your company very consoling to her; and I flatter myself\nthat I should not be an unwelcome guest.\n\nMake my respects to your mamma, and believe me ever yours,\n\nJULIA GRANBY.\n\n\nLETTER LXIV.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nDear madam: I have arrived in safety to the mansion of our once happy\nand social friends. But I cannot describe to you how changed, how\ngreatly changed this amiable family appears since I left it. Mrs.\nWharton met me at the door, and, tenderly embracing, bade me a cordial\nwelcome. \"You are come, Julia,\" said she, \"I hope, to revive and comfort\nus. We have been very solitary during your absence.\" \"I am happy,\nmadam,\" said I, \"to return; and my endeavors to restore cheerfulness and\ncontent shall not be wanting. But where is Eliza?\" By this time we had\nreached the back parlor, whither Mrs. Wharton led me; and, the door\nbeing open, I saw Eliza reclined on a settee, in a very thoughtful\nposture. When I advanced to meet her, she never moved, but sat, \"like\nPatience on a monument, smiling at Grief.\"\n\nI stopped involuntarily, and involuntarily raising my eyes to heaven,\nexclaimed, \"Is that Eliza Wharton?\" She burst into tears, and attempted\nto rise, but sank again into her seat. Seeing her thus affected, I sat\ndown by her, and, throwing my arm about her neck, \"Why these tears?\"\nsaid I. \"Why this distress, my dear friend? Let not the return of your\nJulia give you pain; she comes to soothe you with the consolations of\nfriendship.\" \"It is not pain,\" said she, clasping me to her breast; \"it\nis pleasure too exquisite for my weak nerves to bear. See you not,\nJulia, how I am altered? Should you have known me for the sprightly girl\nwho was always welcome at the haunts of hilarity and mirth?\" \"Indeed,\"\nsaid I, \"you appear indisposed; but I will be your physician. Company\nand change of air will, I doubt not, restore you.\" \"Will these cure\ndisorders of the mind, Julia?\" \"They will have a powerful tendency to\nremove them, if rightly applied; and I profess considerable skill in\nthat art Come,\" continued I, \"we will try these medicines in the\nmorning. Let us rise early, and step into the chaise, and, after riding\na few miles, call and breakfast with Mrs. Freeman. I have some\ncommissions from her daughter. We shall be agreeably entertained there,\nyou know.\"\n\nBeing summoned to supper, I took her by the hand, and we walked into\nanother room, where we found her brother and his wife, with her mamma,\nwaiting for us. We were all very chatty; even Eliza resumed, in a\ndegree, her former sociability. A settled gloom, notwithstanding,\nbrooded on her countenance; and a deep sigh often escaped her in spite\nof her evident endeavors to suppress it. She went to bed before us, when\nher mamma informed me that her health had been declining for some\nmonths; that she never complained, but studiously concealed every\nsymptom of indisposition. Whether it were any real disorder of body, or\nwhether it arose from her depression of spirits, she could not tell, but\nsupposed they operated together, and mutually heightened each other.\n\nI inquired after Major Sanford; whether he and Eliza had associated\ntogether during my absence. Sometimes, she said, they seemed on good\nterms, and he frequently called to see her; at others they had very\nlittle, if any, correspondence at all. She told me that Eliza never went\nabroad, and was very loath to see company at home; that her chief\namusement consisted in solitary walks; that the dreadful idea of her\nmeeting Major Sanford in these walks had now and then intruded upon her\nimagination; that she had not the least evidence of the fact, however,\nand, indeed, was afraid to make any inquiries into the matter, lest her\nown suspicions should be discovered; that the major's character was\nworse than ever; that he was much abroad, and frequently entertained\nlarge parties of worthless bacchanalians at his house; that common\nreport said he treated his wife with indifference, neglect, and ill\nnature; with many other circumstances which it is not material to\nrelate.\n\nAdieu, my dear friend, for the present. When occasion requires, you\nshall hear again from your affectionate\n\nJULIA GRANBY.\n\n\nLETTER LXV.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nGood news, Charles, good news! I have arrived to the utmost bounds of my\nwishes--the full possession of my adorable Eliza. I have heard a\nquotation from a certain book, but what book it was I have forgotten, if\nI ever knew. No matter for that; the quotation is, that \"stolen waters\nare sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.\" If it has reference\nto the pleasures which I have enjoyed with Eliza, I like it hugely, as\nTristram Shandy's father said of Yorick's sermon; and I think it fully\nverified.\n\nI had a long and tedious siege. Every method which love could suggest,\nor art invent, was adopted. I was sometimes ready to despair, under an\nidea that her resolution was unconquerable, her virtue impregnable.\nIndeed, I should have given over the pursuit long ago, but for the hopes\nof success I entertained from her parleying with me, and, in reliance\nupon her own strength, endeavoring to combat and counteract my designs.\nWhenever this has been the case, Charles, I have never yet been defeated\nin my plan. If a lady will consent to enter the lists against the\nantagonist of her honor, she may be sure of losing the prize. Besides,\nwere her delicacy genuine, she would banish the man at once who presumed\nto doubt, which he certainly does who attempts to vanquish it. But far\nbe it from me to criticize the pretensions of the sex. If I gain the\nrich reward of my dissimulation and gallantry, that, you know, is all I\nwant.\n\nTo return, then, to the point. An unlucky, but not a miraculous accident\nhas taken place which must soon expose our amour. What can be done? At\nthe first discovery, absolute distraction seized the soul of Eliza,\nwhich has since terminated in a fixed melancholy. Her health, too, is\nmuch impaired. She thinks herself rapidly declining, and I tremble when\nI see her emaciated form.\n\nMy wife has been reduced very low of late. She brought me a boy a few\nweeks past, a dead one though.\n\nThese circumstances give me neither pain nor pleasure. I am too much\nengrossed by my divinity to take an interest in any thing else. True, I\nhave lately suffered myself to be somewhat engaged here and there by a\nfew jovial lads who assist me in dispelling the anxious thoughts which\nmy perplexed situation excites. I must, however, seek some means to\nrelieve Eliza's distress. My finances are low; but the last fraction\nshall be expended in her service, if she need it.\n\nJulia Granby is expected at Mrs. Wharton's every hour. I fear that her\ninquisitorial eye will soon detect our intrigue and obstruct its\ncontinuation. Now, there's a girl, Charles, I should never attempt to\nseduce; yet she is a most alluring object, I assure you. But the dignity\nof her manners forbids all assaults upon her virtue. Why, the very\nexpression of her eye blasts in the bud every thought derogatory to her\nhonor, and tells you plainly that the first insinuation of the kind\nwould be punished with eternal banishment and displeasure. Of her there\nis no danger. But I can write no more, except that I am, &c.,\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER LXVI.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nO my friend, I have a tale to unfold--a tale which will rend every nerve\nof sympathizing pity, which will rack the breast of sensibility, and\nunspeakably distress your benevolent heart. Eliza--O, the ruined, lost\nEliza!\n\nI want words to express the emotions of indignation and grief which\noppress me. But I will endeavor to compose myself, and relate the\ncircumstances as they came to my knowledge.\n\nAfter my last letter Eliza remained much in the same gloomy situation as\nI found her. She refused to go, agreeably to her promise, to visit your\nmamma, and, under one pretext or another, has constantly declined\naccompanying me any where else since my arrival.\n\nTill last Thursday night she slept in the same bed with me, when she\nexcused herself by saying she was restless, and should disturb my\nrepose. I yielded to her humor of taking a different apartment, little\nsuspecting the real cause. She frequently walked out, and though I\nsometimes followed, I very seldom found her. Two or three times, when I\nhappened to be awake, I heard her go down stairs; and, on inquiry in the\nmorning, she told me that she was very thirsty, and went down for water.\nI observed a degree of hesitancy in her answers for which I could not\naccount. But last night the dreadful mystery was developed. A little\nbefore day, I heard the front door open with great caution. I sprang\nfrom my bed, and, running to the window, saw by the light of the moon a\nman going from the house. Soon after, I perceived a footstep upon the\nstairs, which carefully approached, and entered Eliza's chamber.\n\nJudge of my astonishment, my surprise, my feelings upon this occasion. I\ndoubted not but Major Sanford was the person I had seen; and the\ndiscovery of Eliza's guilt in this infamous intrigue almost deprived me\nof thought and recollection. My blood thrilled with horror at this\nsacrifice of virtue. After a while I recovered myself, and put on my\nclothes. But what to do I knew not--whether to go directly to her\nchamber, and let her know that she was detected, or to wait another\nopportunity.\n\nI resolved on the first. The day had now dawned. I tapped at her door,\nand she bade me come in. She was sitting in an easy chair by the side of\nher bed. As I entered she withdrew her handkerchief from her face, and,\nlooking earnestly at me, said, \"What procures me the favor of a visit at\nthis early hour, Miss Granby?\" \"I was disturbed,\" said I, \"and wished\nnot to return to my bed. But what breaks your rest, and calls you up so\nunseasonably, Eliza?\" \"Remorse and despair,\" answered she, weeping.\n\"After what I have witnessed, this morning,\" rejoined I, \"I cannot\nwonder at it. Was it not Major Sanford whom I saw go from the house some\ntime ago?\" She was silent, but tears flowed abundantly. \"It is too\nlate,\" continued I, \"to deny or evade. Answer my question sincerely;\nfor, believe me, Eliza, it is not malice, but concern for you, which\nprompts it.\" \"I will answer you, Julia,\" said she. \"You have discovered\na secret which harrows up my very soul--a secret which I wished you to\nknow, but could not exert resolution to reveal. Yes, it was Major\nSanford--the man who has robbed me of my peace, who has triumphed in my\ndestruction, and who will cause my sun to set at noon.\"\n\n\"I shudder,\" said I, \"at your confession! Wretched, deluded girl! Is\nthis a return for your parent's love and assiduous care; for your\nfriends' solicitude and premonitory advice? You are ruined, you say! You\nhave sacrificed your virtue to an abandoned, despicable profligate! And\nyou live to acknowledge and bear your infamy!\" \"I do,\" said she; \"but\nnot long shall I support this burden. See you not, Julia, my decaying\nframe, my faded cheek, and tottering limbs? Soon shall I be insensible\nto censure and reproach. Soon shall I be sequestered in that mansion\n'where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the weary are at\nrest.'\" \"Rest!\" said I; \"can you expect to find rest, either in this\nworld or another, with such a weight of guilt on your head?\" She\nexclaimed, with great emotion, \"Add not to the upbraidings of a wounded\nspirit. Have pity upon me, O my friend, have pity upon me. Could you\nknow what I suffer, you would think me sufficiently punished.\" \"I wish\nyou no other punishment,\" said I, \"than what may effect your repentance\nand reformation. But your mother, Eliza! She cannot long be ignorant of\nyour fall; and I tremble to think of her distress. It will break her\nwidowed heart. How has she loved, how has she doted upon you! Dreadful\nis the requital which you have made.\" \"My mother,\" rejoined she, \"O,\nname her not! The very sound is distraction to me. O my Julia, if your\nheart be not shut against mercy and compassion towards me, aid me\nthrough this trying scene. Let my situation call forth your pity, and\ninduce you, undeserving as I am, to exert it in my behalf.\"\n\nDuring this time, I had walked the chamber. My spirits had been raised\nabove their natural key, and were exhausted. I sat down, but thought I\nshould have fainted, till a copious flood of tears gave me relief. Eliza\nwas extremely affected. The appearance of calamity which she exhibited\nwould have softened the most obdurate anger. Indeed, I feared some\nimmediate and fatal effect. I therefore seated myself beside her; and\nassuming an air of kindness, \"Compose yourself, Eliza,\" said I; \"I\nrepeat what I told you before--it is the purest friendship which thus\ninterests me in your concerns. This, under the direction of charity,\ninduces me again to offer you my hand. Yet you have erred against\nknowledge and reason, against warning and counsel. You have forfeited\nthe favor of your friends, and reluctant will be their forgiveness.\" \"I\nplead guilty,\" said she, \"to all your charges. From the general voice I\nexpect no clemency. If I can make my peace with my mother, it is all I\nseek or wish on this side the grave. In your benevolence I confide for\nthis. In you I hope to find an intercessor. By the remembrance of our\nformer affection and happiness, I conjure you, refuse me not At present,\nI entreat you to conceal from her this distressing tale. A short,\nreprieve is all I ask.\" \"Why,\" said I, \"should you defer it? When the\npainful task is over, you may find relief in her lenient kindness.\"\n\"After she knows my condition, I cannot see her,\" resumed she, \"till I\nam assured of her forgiveness. I have not strength to support the\nappearance of her anger and grief. I will write to her what I cannot\nspeak. You must bear the melancholy message, and plead for me, that her\ndispleasure may not follow me to the grave, whither I am rapidly\nhastening.\" \"Be assured,\" replied I, \"that I will keep your secret as\nlong as prudence requires. But I must leave you now; your mamma will\nwonder at our being thus closeted together. When opportunity presents,\nwe will converse further on the subject. In the mean time keep yourself\nas composed as possible, if you would avoid suspicion.\" She raised her\nclasped hands, and with a piteous look, threw her handkerchief over her\nface, and reclined in her chair, without speaking a word. I returned to\nmy chamber, and endeavored to dissipate every idea which might tend to\ndisorder my countenance, and break the silence I wished to observe\nrelative to what had happened.\n\nWhen I went down, Mrs. Wharton desired me to step up and inform Eliza\nthat breakfast was ready. She told me she could not yet compose herself\nsufficiently to see her mamma, and begged me to excuse her absence as I\nthought proper. I accordingly returned for answer to Mrs. Wharton, that\nEliza had rested but indifferently, and being somewhat indisposed, would\nnot come down, but wished me to bring her a bowl of chocolate, when we\nhad breakfasted. I was obliged studiously to suppress even my thoughts\nconcerning her, lest the emotions they excited might be observed. Mrs.\nWharton conversed much of her daughter, and expressed great concern\nabout her health and state of mind. Her return to this state of\ndejection, after having recovered her spirits and cheerfulness in a\ngreat degree, was owing, she feared, to some cause unknown to her; and\nshe entreated me to extract the secret, if possible. I assured her of my\nbest endeavors, and doubted not, I told her, but I should be able in a\nfew days to effect what she wished.\n\nEliza came down and walked in the garden before dinner; at which she\ncommanded herself much better than I expected. She said that a little\nride might, she imagined, be of service to her, and asked me if I would\naccompany her a few miles in the afternoon. Her mamma was much pleased\nwith the proposition, and the chaise was accordingly ordered.\n\nI observed to Eliza, as we rode, that with her natural and acquired\nabilities, with her advantages of education, with her opportunities of\nknowing the world, and of tracing the virtues and vices of mankind to\ntheir origin, I was surprised at her becoming the prey of an insidious\nlibertine, with whose character she was well acquainted, and whose\nprinciples, she was fully apprised, would prompt him to deceive and\nbetray her. \"Your surprise is very natural,\" said she. \"The same will\ndoubtless be felt and expressed by every one to whom my sad story is\nrelated. But the cause may be found in that unrestrained levity of\ndisposition, that fondness for dissipation and coquetry, which alienated\nthe affections of Mr. Boyer from me. This event fatally depressed and\nenfeebled my mind. I embraced with avidity the consoling power of\nfriendship, insnaringly offered by my seducer; vainly inferring, from\nhis marriage with a virtuous woman, that he had seen the error of his\nways, and forsaken his licentious practices, as he affirmed, and I, fool\nthat I was, believed it.\n\n\"It is needless for me to rehearse the perfidious arts by which he\ninsinuated himself into my affections and gained my confidence. Suffice\nit to say, he effected his purpose. But not long did I continue in the\ndelusive dream of sensual gratification. I soon awoke to a most poignant\nsense of his baseness, and of my own crime and misery. I would have fled\nfrom him; I would have renounced him forever, and by a life of sincere\nhumility and repentance endeavored to make my peace with Heaven, and to\nobliterate, by the rectitude of my future conduct, the guilt I had\nincurred; but I found it too late. My circumstances called for\nattention; and I had no one to participate my cares, to witness my\ndistress, and to alleviate my sorrows, but him. I could not therefore\nprevail on myself wholly to renounce his society. At times I have\nadmitted his visits, always meeting him in the garden, or grove\nadjoining; till, of late, the weather and my ill health induced me to\ncomply with his solicitations, and receive him into the parlor.\n\n\"Not long, however, shall I be subject to these embarrassments. Grief\nhas undermined my constitution. My health has fallen a sacrifice to a\ndisordered mind. But I regret not its departure. I have not a single\nwish to live. Nothing which the world affords can restore my former\nserenity and happiness.\n\n\"The little innocent I bear will quickly disclose its mother's shame.\nGod Almighty grant it may not live as a monument of my guilt, and a\npartaker of the infamy and sorrow, which is all I have to bequeath it.\nShould it be continued in life, it will never know the tenderness of a\nparent; and, perhaps, want and disgrace may be its wretched portion. The\ngreatest consolation I can have will be to carry it with me to a state\nof eternal rest; which, vile as I am, I hope to obtain, through the\ninfinite mercy of Heaven, as revealed in the gospel of Christ. I must\nsee Major Sanford again. It is necessary to converse further with him in\norder to carry my plan of operation into execution.\"\n\n\"What is this plan of operation, Eliza?\" said I. \"I am on the rack of\nanxiety for your safety.\" \"Be patient,\" continued she, \"and you shall\nsoon be informed. To-morrow I shall write my dreadful story to my\nmother. She will be acquainted with my future intentions; and you shall\nknow, at the same time, the destination of your lost friend.\" \"I hope,\"\nsaid I, \"that you have formed no resolution against your own life.\" \"God\nforbid,\" rejoined she. \"My breath is in his hands; let him do what\nseemeth good in his sight! Keep my secret one day longer, and I will never\nmore impose so painful a silence upon you.\"\n\nBy this time we had reached home. She drank tea with composure, and soon\nretired to rest. Mrs. Wharton eagerly inquired whether I had found out\nthe cause of Eliza's melancholy. \"I have urged her,\" said I, \"on the\nsubject; but she alleges that she has particular reasons for present\nconcealment. She has, notwithstanding, promised to let me know the day\nafter to-morrow.\" \"O,\" said she, \"I shall not rest till the period\narrives.\" \"Dear, good woman,\" said I to myself, \"I fear you will never\nrest afterwards.\"\n\nThis is our present situation. Think what a scene rises to the view of\nyour Julia. She must share the distress of others, though her own\nfeelings on this unhappy occasion are too keen to admit a moment's\nserenity. My greatest relief is in writing to you; which I shall do\nagain by the next post. In the mean time, I must beg leave to subscribe\nmyself sincerely yours,\n\nJULIA GRANBY.\n\n\nLETTER LXVII.\n\nTO THE SAME.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nAll is now lost; lost indeed! She is gone! Yes, my dear friend, our\nbeloved Eliza is gone! Never more shall we behold this once amiable\ncompanion, this once innocent and happy girl. She has forsaken, and, as\nshe says, bid an everlasting adieu to her home, her afflicted parent,\nand her friends. But I will take up my melancholy story where I left it\nin my last.\n\nShe went, as she told me she expected, into the garden, and met her\ndetestable paramour. In about an hour she returned, and went directly to\nher chamber. At one o'clock I went up, and found her writing, and\nweeping. I begged her to compose herself, and go down to dinner. No, she\nsaid, she should not eat; and was not fit to appear before any body. I\nremonstrated against her immoderate grief, represented the injury she\nmust sustain by the indulgence of it, and conjured her to suppress the\nviolence of its emotions.\n\nShe entreated me to excuse her to her mamma; said she was writing to\nher, and found it a task too painful to be performed with any degree of\ncomposure; that she was almost ready to sink under the weight of her\naffliction; but hoped and prayed for support both in this and another\ntrying scene which awaited her. In compliance with her desire, I now\nleft her, and told her mamma that she was very busy writing, wished not\nto be interrupted at present, but would take some refreshment an hour or\ntwo hence. I visited her again about four o'clock; when she appeared\nmore calm and tranquil.\n\n\"It is finished,\" said she, as I entered her apartment; \"it is\nfinished.\" \"What,\" said I, \"is finished?\" \"No matter,\" replied she; \"you\nwill know all to-morrow, Julia.\" She complained of excessive fatigue,\nand expressed an inclination to lie down; in which I assisted her, and\nthen retired. Some time after, her mamma went up, and found her still on\nthe bed. She rose, however, and accompanied her down stairs. I met her\nat the door of the parlor, and, taking her by the hand, inquired how she\ndid. \"O Julia, miserably indeed,\" said she. \"How severely does my\nmother's kindness reproach me! How insupportably it increases my\nself-condemnation!\" She wept; she rung her hands, and walked the room in\nthe greatest agony. Mrs. Wharton was exceedingly distressed by her\nappearance. \"Tell me, Eliza,\" said she, \"tell me the cause of your\ntrouble. O, kill me not by your mysterious concealment. My dear child,\nlet me by sharing alleviate your affliction.\" \"Ask me not, madam,\" said\nshe; \"O my mother, I conjure you not to insist on my divulging to-night\nthe fatal secret which engrosses and distracts my mind; to-morrow I will\nhide nothing from you.\" \"I will press you no further,\" rejoined her\nmamma. \"Choose your own time, my dear; but remember, I must participate\nyour grief, though I know not the cause.\"\n\nSupper was brought in, and we endeavored to prevail on Eliza to eat, but\nin vain. She sat down in compliance with our united importunities; but\nneither of us tasted food. It was removed untouched. For a while, Mrs.\nWharton and I gazed in silent anguish upon the spectacle of woe before\nus. At length Eliza rose to retire. \"Julia,\" said she, \"you will call at\nmy chamber as you pass to your own?\" I assented. She then approached her\nmamma, fell upon her knees before her, and clasping her hand, said, in\nbroken accents, \"O madam, can you forgive a wretch, who has forfeited\nyour love, your kindness, and your compassion?\" \"Surely, Eliza,\" said\nshe, \"you are not that being! No, it is impossible! But however great\nyour transgression, be assured of my forgiveness, my compassion, and my\ncontinued love.\" Saying this, she threw her arms about her daughter's\nneck, and affectionately kissed her. Eliza struggled from her embrace,\nand looking at her with wild despair, exclaimed, \"This is too much! O,\nthis unmerited goodness is more than I can bear!\" She then rushed\nprecipitately out of the room, and left us overwhelmed in sympathy and\nastonishment.\n\nWhen Mrs. Wharton had recovered herself a little, she observed that\nEliza's brain was evidently disordered. \"Nothing else,\" continued she,\n\"could impel her to act in this extraordinary manner.\" At first she was\nresolved to follow her; but I dissuaded her from it, alleging that, as\nshe had desired me to come into her chamber, I thought it better for me\nto go alone. She acquiesced, but said she should not think of going to\nbed, but would, however, retire to her chamber, and seek consolation\nthere. I bade her good night, and went up to Eliza, who took me by the\nhand, and led me to the toilet, upon which she laid the two enclosed\nletters, the one to her mamma, and the other to me. \"These,\" said she,\n\"contain what I had not resolution to express. Promise me, Julia, that\nthey shall not be opened till to-morrow morning.\" \"I will,\" said I. \"I\nhave thought and wept,\" continued she, \"till I have almost exhausted my\nstrength and my reason. I would now obtain a little respite, that I may\nprepare my mind for the account I am one day to give at a higher\ntribunal than that of earthly friends. For this purpose, what I have\nwritten, and what I shall yet say to you, must close the account between\nyou and me.\" \"I have certainly no balance against you,\" said I. \"In my\nbreast you are fully acquitted. Your penitential tears have obliterated\nyour guilt and blotted out your errors with your Julia. Henceforth, be\nthey all forgotten. Live, and be happy.\" \"Talk not,\" said she, \"of life;\nit would be a vain hope, though I cherished it myself.\n\n  'That I must die, it is my only comfort;\n  Death is the privilege of human nature,\n  And life without it were not worth the taking.\n  Thither the poor, the prisoner, and the mourner\n  Fly for relief, and lay their burdens down.'\n\nYou have forgiven me, Julia; my mother has assured me of her\nforgiveness; and what have I more to wish? My heart is much lightened by\nthese kind assurances; they will be a great support to me in the\ndreadful hour which awaits me.\" \"What mean you, Eliza?\" said I. \"I fear\nsome dreadful purpose labors in your mind.\" \"O, no,\" she replied; \"you\nmay be assured your fear is groundless. I know not what I say; my brain\nis on fire; I am all confusion. Leave me, Julia; when I have had a\nlittle rest, I shall be composed. These letters have almost distracted\nme; but they are written, and I am comparatively easy.\" \"I will not\nleave you, Eliza,\" said I, \"unless you will go directly to bed, and\nendeavor to rest.\" \"I will,\" said she, \"and the sooner the better.\" I\ntenderly embraced her, and retired, though not to bed. About an hour\nafter, I returned to her chamber, and opening the door very softly,\nfound her apparently asleep. I acquainted Mrs. Wharton with her\nsituation, which was a great consolation to us both, and encouraged us\nto go to bed: having suffered much in my mind, and being much fatigued,\nI soon fell asleep; but the rattling of a carriage, which appeared to\nstop a little distance from the house, awoke me. I listened a moment,\nand heard the door turn slowly on its hinges. I sprang from my bed, and\nreached the window just in time to see a female handed into a chaise by\na man who hastily followed her, and drove furiously away. I at once\nconcluded they could be no other than Eliza and Major Sanford. Under\nthis impression I made no delay, but ran immediately to her chamber. A\ncandle was burning on the table, but Eliza was not there. I thought it\nbest to acquaint her mamma with the melancholy discovery, and, stepping\nto her apartment for the purpose, found her rising. She had heard me\nwalk, and was anxious to know the cause. \"What is the matter, Julia?\"\nsaid she; \"what is the matter?\" \"Dear madam,\" said I, \"arm yourself with\nfortitude.\" \"What new occurrence demands it?\" rejoined she. \"Eliza has\nleft us.\" \"Left us! What mean you?\" \"She has just gone; I saw her handed\ninto a chaise, which instantly disappeared.\"\n\nAt this intelligence she gave a shriek, and fell back on her bed. I\nalarmed the family, and by their assistance soon recovered her. She\ndesired me to inform her of every particular relative to her elopement,\nwhich I did, and then delivered her the letter which Eliza had left for\nher. \"I suspect,\" said she, as she took it; \"I have long suspected what\nI dared not believe. The anguish of my mind has been known only to\nmyself and my God.\" I could not answer her, and therefore withdrew. When\nI had read Eliza's letter to me, and wept over the sad fall, and, as I\nfear, the total loss of this once amiable and accomplished girl, I\nreturned to Mrs. Wharton. She was sitting in her easy chair, and still\nheld the fatal letter in her hand. When I entered, she fixed her\nstreaming eyes upon me, and exclaimed, \"O Julia, this is more than the\nbitterness of death.\" \"True, madam,\" said I, \"your affliction must be\ngreat; yet that all-gracious Being who controls every event is able, and\nI trust disposed, to support you.\" \"To him,\" replied she, \"I desire\nhumbly to resign myself; but I think I could have borne almost any other\ncalamity with greater resignation and composure than this. With how much\ncomparative ease could I have followed her to the grave at any period\nsince her birth! O, my child, my child! dear, very dear, hast thou been\nto my fond heart. Little did I think it possible for you to prepare so\ndreadful a cup of sorrow for your widowed mother. But where,\" continued\nshe, \"where can the poor fugitive have fled? Where can she find that\nprotection and tenderness, which, notwithstanding her great apostasy, I\nshould never have withheld? From whom can she receive those kind\nattentions which her situation demands.\"\n\nThe agitation of her mind had exhausted her strength, and I prevailed on\nher to refresh and endeavor to compose herself to rest, assuring her of\nmy utmost exertions to find out Eliza's retreat, and restore her to a\nmother's arms.\n\nI am obliged to suppress my own emotions, and to bend all my thoughts\ntowards the alleviation of Mrs. Wharton's anxiety and grief.\n\nMajor Sanford is from home, as I expected; and I am determined, if he\nreturn, to see him myself, and extort from him the place of Eliza's\nconcealment. Her flight in her present state of health is inexpressibly\ndistressing to her mother; and unless we find her soon, I dread the\neffects.\n\nI shall not close this till I have seen or heard from the vile\nmiscreant who has involved a worthy family in wretchedness.\n\n_Friday morning._--Two days have elapsed without affording us much\nrelief. Last evening, I was told that Major Sanford was at home. I\nimmediately wrote him a billet, entreating and conjuring him to let me\nknow where the hapless Eliza had fled. He returned me the following\nanswer:--\n\n\"Miss Granby need be under no apprehensions respecting the situation of\nour beloved Eliza. She is well provided for, conveniently accommodated,\nand has every thing to make her happy which love and affluence can give.\n\n\"Major Sanford has solemnly sworn not to discover her retreat. She\nwishes to avoid the accusations of her friends till she is better able\nto bear them.\n\n\"Her mother may rest assured of immediate information, should any danger\nthreaten her amiable daughter; and also of having seasonable notice of\nher safety.\"\n\nAlthough little dependence can be placed upon this man, yet these\nassurances have, in a great degree, calmed our minds. We are, however,\ncontriving means to explore the refuge of the wanderer, and hope, by\ntracing his steps, to accomplish our purpose. This we have engaged a\nfriend to do.\n\nI know, my dear Mrs. Sumner, the kind interest you will take in this\ndisastrous affair. I tremble to think what the event may be. To relieve\nyour suspense, however, I shall write you every circumstance as It\noccurs; but at present, I shall only enclose Eliza's letters to her\nmamma and me, and subscribe myself your sincere and obliged friend,\n\nJULIA GRANBY.\n\n\nLETTER LXVIII.\n\nTO MRS. M. WHARTON.\n\nTUESDAY.\n\nMy honored and dear mamma: In what words, in what language shall I\naddress you? What shall I say on a subject which deprives me of the\npower of expression? Would to God I had been totally deprived of that\npower before so fatal a subject required its exertion. Repentance comes\ntoo late, when it cannot prevent the evil lamented: for your kindness,\nyour more than maternal affection towards me, from my infancy to the\npresent moment, a long life of filial duty and unerring rectitude could\nhardly compensate. How greatly deficient in gratitude must I appear,\nthen, while I confess that precept and example, counsel and advice,\ninstruction and admonition, have been all lost upon me!\n\nYour kind endeavors to promote my happiness have been repaid by the\ninexcusable folly of sacrificing it. The various emotions of shame and\nremorse, penitence and regret, which torture and distract my guilty\nbreast, exceed description. Yes, madam, your Eliza has fallen, fallen\nindeed. She has become the victim of her own indiscretion, and of the\nintrigue and artifice of a designing libertine, who is the husband of\nanother. She is polluted, and no more worthy of her parentage. She flies\nfrom you, not to conceal her guilt, (that she humbly and penitently\nowns,) but to avoid what she has never experienced, and feels herself\nunable to support--a mother's frown; to escape the heart-rending sight\nof a parent's grief, occasioned by the crimes of her guilty child.\n\nI have become a reproach and disgrace to my friends. The consciousness\nof having forfeited their favor and incurred their disapprobation and\nresentment induces me to conceal from them the place of my retirement;\nbut lest your benevolence should render you anxious for my comfort in my\npresent situation, I take the liberty to assure you that I am amply\nprovided for.\n\nI have no claim even upon your pity; but from my long experience of your\ntenderness. I presume to hope it will be extended to me. O my mother, if\nyou knew what the state of my mind is, and has been for months past, you\nwould surely compassionate my case. Could tears efface the stain which I\nhave brought upon my family, it would long since have been washed away;\nbut, alas! tears are in vain; and vain is my bitter repentance; it\ncannot obliterate my crime, nor restore me to innocence and peace. In\nthis life I have no ideas of happiness. These I have wholly resigned.\nThe only hope which affords me any solace is that of your forgiveness.\nIf the deepest contrition can make an atonement,--if the severest pains,\nboth of body and mind, can restore me to your charity,--you will not be\ninexorable. O, let my sufferings be deemed a sufficient punishment, and\nadd not the insupportable weight of a parent's wrath. At present I\ncannot see you. The effect of my crime is too obvious to be longer\nconcealed, to elude the invidious eye of curiosity. This night,\ntherefore, I leave your hospitable mansion. This night I become a\nwretched wanderer from my paternal roof. O that the grave were this\nnight to be my lodging! Then should I lie down and be at rest. Trusting\nin the mercy of God, through the mediation of his Son, I think I could\nmeet my heavenly Father with more composure and confidence than my\nearthly parent.\n\nLet not the faults and misfortunes of your daughter oppress your mind.\nRather let the conviction of having faithfully discharged your duty to\nyour lost child support and console you in this trying scene.\n\nSince I wrote the above, you have kindly granted me your forgiveness,\nthough you knew not how great, how aggravated was my offence. You\nforgive me, you say. O, the harmonious, the transporting sound! It has\nrevived my drooping spirits, and will enable me to encounter, with\nresolution, the trials before me.\n\nFarewell, my dear mamma! Pity and pray for your ruined child; and be\nassured that affection and gratitude will be the last sentiments which\nexpire in the breast of your repenting daughter,\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER LXIX.\n\nTO MISS JULIA GRANBY.\n\nTUESDAY.\n\nMy dear friend: By that endearing title you permit me still to address\nyou, and such you have always proved yourself by a participation of my\ndistresses, as well as by the consoling voice of pity and forgiveness.\nWhat destiny Providence designs for me I know not, but I have my\nforebodings that this is the last time I shall ever accost you. Nor does\nthis apprehension arise merely from a disturbed imagination. I have\nreason to think myself in a confirmed consumption, which commonly proves\nfatal to persons in my situation. I have carefully concealed every\ncomplaint of the kind from my mamma, for fear of distressing her; yet I\nhave never been insensible of their probable issue, and have bidden a\nsincere welcome to them, as the harbingers of my speedy release from a\nlife of guilt and woe.\n\nI am going from you, Julia. This night separates us, perhaps, forever. I\nhave not resolution to encounter the tears of my friends, and therefore\nseek shelter among strangers, where none knows or is interested in my\nmelancholy story. The place of my seclusion I studiously conceal; yet I\nshall take measures that you may be apprised of my fate.\n\nShould it please God to spare and restore me to health, I shall return,\nand endeavor, by a life of penitence and rectitude, to expiate my past\noffences. But should I be called from this scene of action, and leave\nbehind me a helpless babe, the innocent sufferer of its mother's shame,\nO Julia, let your friendship for me extend to the little stranger.\nIntercede with my mother to take it under her protection, and transfer\nto it all her affection for me; to train it up in the ways of piety and\nvirtue, that it may compensate her for the afflictions which I have\noccasioned.\n\nOne thing more I have to request. Plead for me with my two best friends,\nMrs. Richman and Mrs. Sumner. I ask you not to palliate my faults,--that\ncannot be done,--but to obtain, if possible, their forgiveness. I cannot\nwrite all my full mind suggests on this subject. You know the purport,\nand can better express it for me.\n\nAnd now, my dear Julia, recommending myself again to your benevolence,\nto your charity, and (may I add?) to your affection, and entreating that\nthe fatal consequences of my folly, now fallen upon my devoted head, may\nsuffice for my punishment, let me conjure you to bury my crimes in the\ngrave with me, and to preserve the remembrance of my former virtues,\nwhich engaged your love and confidence; more especially of that ardent\nesteem for you, which will glow till the last expiring breath of your\ndespairing\n\nELIZA WHARTON.\n\n\nLETTER LXX.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nI have, at last, accomplished the removal of my darling girl from a\nplace where she thought every eye accused and every heart condemned her.\n\nShe has become quite romantic in her notions. She would not permit me to\naccompany her, lest it should be reported that we had eloped together. I\nprovided amply for her future exigencies, and conveyed her by night to\nthe distance of ten or twelve miles, where we met the stage, in which I\nhad previously secured her a seat. The agony of her grief at being thus\nobliged to leave her mother's house baffles all description.\n\nIt very sensibly affected me, I know. I was almost a penitent. I am\nsure I acted like one, whether I were sincere or not. She chose to go\nwhere she was totally unknown. She would leave the stage, she said,\nbefore it reached Boston, and take passage in a more private carriage to\nSalem, or its vicinity, where she would fix her abode; chalking the\ninitials of my name over the door, as a signal to me of her residence.\n\nShe is exceedingly depressed, and says she neither expects nor wishes to\nsurvive her lying in. Insanity, for aught I know, must be my lot if she\nshould die. But I will not harbor the idea. I hope, one time or other,\nto have the power to make her amends, even by marriage. My wife may be\nprovoked, I imagine, to sue for a divorce. If she should, she would find\nno difficulty in obtaining it, and then I would take Eliza in her stead;\nthough I confess that the idea of being thus connected with a woman whom\nI have been enabled to dishonor, would be rather hard to surmount. It\nwould hurt even my delicacy, little as you may think me to possess, to\nhave a wife whom I know to be seducible. And on this account I cannot be\npositive that even Eliza would retain my love.\n\nMy Nancy and I have lived a pretty uncomfortable life of late. She has\nbeen very suspicious of my amour with Eliza, and now and then expressed\nher jealous sentiments a little more warmly than my patience would\nbear. But the news of Eliza's circumstances and retirement, being\npublicly talked of, have reached her ears, and rendered her quite\noutrageous. She tells me she will no longer brook my indifference and\ninfidelity; intends soon to return to her father's house, and extricate\nherself from me entirely. My general reply to all this is, that she knew\nmy character before we married, and could reasonably expect nothing less\nthan what has happened. I shall not oppose her leaving me, as it may\nconduce to the execution of the plan I have hinted above.\n\nTo-morrow I shall set out to visit my disconsolate fair one. From my\nvery soul I pity her, and wish I could have preserved her virtue\nconsistently with the indulgence of my passion. To her I lay not the\nprincipal blame, as in like cases I do the sex in general. My finesse\nwas too well planned for detection, and my snares too deeply laid for\nany one to escape who had the least warmth in her constitution, or\naffection in her heart. I shall, therefore, be the less whimsical about\na future connection, and the more solicitous to make her reparation,\nshould it ever be in my power.\n\nHer friends are all in arms about her. I dare say I have the\nimprecations of the whole fraternity. They may thank themselves in\npart, for I always swore revenge for their dislike and coldness towards\nme. Had they been politic, they would have conducted more like the\naborigines of the country, who are said to worship the devil out of\nfear.\n\nI am afraid I shall be obliged to remove my quarters, for Eliza was so\ngreat a favorite in town that I am looked upon with an evil eye. I\npleaded with her, before we parted last, to forgive my seducing her,\nalleged my ardent love, and my inability to possess her in any other\nway. \"How,\" said she, \"can that be love which destroys its object? But\ngranting what you say, you have frustrated your own purpose. You have\ndeprived yourself-of my society, which might have been innocently\nenjoyed. You have cut me off from life in the midst of my days. You have\nrendered me the reproach of my friends, the disgrace of my family and a\ndishonor to virtue and my sex. But I forgive you,\" added she. \"Yes,\nSanford, I forgive you, and sincerely pray for your repentance and\nreformation. I hope to be the last wretched female sacrificed by you to\nthe arts of falsehood and seduction. May my unhappy story serve as a\nbeacon to warn the American fair of the dangerous tendency and\ndestructive consequences of associating with men of your character, of\ndestroying their time and risking their reputation by the practice of\ncoquetry and its attendant follies. But for these I might have been\nhonorably connected, and capable, at this moment, of diffusing and\nreceiving happiness. But for your arts I might have remained a blessing\nto society, as well as the delight and comfort of my friends. You being\na married man unspeakably aggravates both your guilt and mine. This\ncircumstance annexes indelible shame to our crime. You have rent asunder\nthe tenderest ties of nature. You have broken the bonds of conjugal\nlove, which ought ever to be kept sacred and inviolate. You have filled\nwith grief and discontent the heart of your amiable wife, whom\ngratitude, if no other principle, should have induced you to cherish\nwith tenderness; and I, wretch that I am, have been your accomplice. But\nI cease to reproach you. You have acted but too consistently with the\ncharacter which I was sufficiently apprised you sustained. The blame,\nthen, may be retorted on myself, for disregarding the counsels,\nwarnings, and admonitions of my best friends. You have prided yourself\nin the character of a libertine. Glory no longer in your shame. You have\naccomplished your designs, your dreadful designs, against me. Let this\nsuffice. Add not to the number of those deluded creatures who will one\nday rise up in judgment against you and condemn you.\"\n\nBy this time we had nearly reached the inn, and were soon to part. I\nseized her hand, and exclaimed, \"You must not leave me, Eliza, with that\nawful anathema on your lips. O, say that you will forget my past\nfaults.\" \"That,\" said she, \"I shall soon do; for in the grave there is\nno remembrance.\" This, to my mind, was a harsher sentence than the\nother, and almost threw me into despair. Never was I so wrought upon\nbefore. I knew not what to say or do. She saw my distress, and kindly\nsoftened her manner. \"If I am severe,\" said she, \"it is because I wish\nto impress your mind with such a sense of your offences against your\nMaker, your friends, and society in general, as may effect your\nrepentance and amendment. I wish not to be your accuser, but your\nreformer. On several accounts, I view my own crime in a more aggravated\nlight than yours; but my conscience is awakened to a conviction of my\nguilt. Yours, I fear, is not. Let me conjure you to return home, and\nendeavor, by your future kindness and fidelity to your wife, to make her\nall the amends in your power. By a life of virtue and religion, you may\nyet become a valuable member of society, and secure happiness both here\nand hereafter.\"\n\nI begged leave to visit her retirement next week, not in continuation of\nour amour, but as a friend solicitous to know her situation and welfare.\nUnable to speak, she only bowed assent. The stage being now ready, I\nwhispered some tender things in her ear, and kissing her cheek, which\nwas all she would permit, suffered her to depart.\n\nMy body remains behind; but my soul, if I have any, went with her.\n\nThis was a horrid lecture, Charles. She brought every charge against me\nwhich a fruitful and gloomy imagination could suggest. But I hope when\nshe recovers she will resume her former cheerfulness, and become as kind\nand agreeable as ever. My anxiety for her safety is very great. I trust,\nhowever, it will soon be removed, and peace and pleasure be restored to\nyour humble servant,\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER LXXI.\n\nTO MRS. LUCY SUMNER.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nThe drama is now closed! A tragical one it has proved!\n\nHow sincerely, my dear Mrs. Sumner, must the friends of our departed\nEliza sympathize with each other, and with her afflicted, bereaved\nparent!\n\nYou have doubtless seen the account in the public papers which gave us\nthe melancholy intelligence. But I will give you a detail of\ncircumstances.\n\nA few days after my last was written, we heard that Major Sanford's\nproperty was attached, and he a prisoner in his own house. He was the\nlast man to whom we wished to apply for information respecting the\nforlorn wanderer; yet we had no other resource. And after waiting a\nfortnight in the most cruel suspense, we wrote a billet, entreating him,\nif possible, to give some intelligence concerning her. He replied that\nhe was unhappily deprived of all means of knowing himself, but hoped\nsoon to relieve his own and our anxiety about her.\n\nIn this situation we continued till a neighbor (purposely, we since\nconcluded) sent us a Boston paper. Mrs. Wharton took it, and unconscious\nof its contents, observed that the perusal might divert her a few\nmoments. She read for some time, when it suddenly dropped upon the\nfloor. She clasped her hands together, and raising her streaming eyes to\nheaven, exclaimed, \"It is the Lord; let him do what he will. Be still, O\nmy soul, and know that he is God.\"\n\n\"What, madam,\" said I, \"can be the matter?\" She answered not, but, with\ninexpressible anguish depicted in her countenance, pointed to the paper.\nI took it up, and soon found the fatal paragraph. I shall not attempt to\npaint our heartfelt grief and lamentation upon this occasion; for we had\nno doubt of Eliza's being the person described, as a stranger, who died,\nat Danvers, last July. Her delivery of a child, her dejected state of\nmind, the marks upon her linen, indeed every circumstance in the\nadvertisement, convinced us, beyond dispute, that it could be no other.\nMrs. Wharton retired immediately to her chamber, where she continued\noverwhelmed with sorrow that night and the following day. Such in fact\nhas been her habitual frame ever since; though the endeavors of her\nfriends, who have sought to console her, have rendered her somewhat more\nconversable. My testimony of Eliza's penitence before her departure is a\nsource of comfort to this disconsolate parent. She fondly cherished the\nidea that, having expiated her offence by sincere repentance and\namendment, her deluded child finally made a happy exchange of worlds.\nBut the desperate resolution, which she formed and executed, of becoming\na fugitive, of deserting her mother's house and protection, and of\nwandering and dying among strangers, is a most distressing reflection\nto her friends; especially to her mother, in whose breast so many\npainful ideas arise, that she finds it extremely difficult to compose\nherself to that resignation which she evidently strives to exemplify.\n\nEliza's brother has been to visit her last retreat, and to learn the\nparticulars of her melancholy exit. He relates that she was well\naccommodated, and had every attention and assistance which her situation\nrequired. The people where she resided appear to have a lively sense of\nher merit and misfortunes. They testify her modest deportment, her\nfortitude under the sufferings to which she was called, and the serenity\nand composure with which she bade a last adieu to the world. Mr. Wharton\nhas brought back several scraps of her writing, containing miscellaneous\nreflections on her situation, the death of her babe, and the absence of\nher friends. Some of these were written before, some after, her\nconfinement. These valuable testimonies of the affecting sense and calm\nexpectation she entertained of her approaching dissolution are\ncalculated to soothe and comfort the minds of mourning connections. They\ngreatly alleviate the regret occasioned by her absence at this awful\nperiod. Her elopement can be equalled only by the infatuation which\ncaused her ruin.\n\n  \"But let no one reproach her memory.\n  Her life has paid the forfeit of her folly.\n  Let that suffice.\"\n\n\nI am told that Major Sanford is quite frantic. Sure I am that he has\nreason to be. If the mischiefs he has brought upon others return upon\nhis own head, dreadful indeed must be his portion. His wife has left\nhim, and returned to her parents. His estate, which has been long\nmortgaged, is taken from him, and poverty and disgrace await him. Heaven\nseldom leaves injured innocence unavenged. Wretch that he is, he ought\nforever to be banished from human society! I shall continue with Mrs.\nWharton till the lenient hand of time has assuaged her sorrows, and then\nmake my promised visit to you. I will bring Eliza's posthumous papers\nwith me when I come to Boston, as I have not time to copy them now.\n\nI foresee, my dear Mrs. Sumner, that this disastrous affair will suspend\nyour enjoyments, as it has mine. But what are our feelings, compared\nwith the pangs which rend a parent's heart? This parent I here behold\ninhumanly stripped of the best solace of her declining years by the\ninsnaring machinations of a profligate debauchee. Not only the life,\nbut, what was still dearer, the reputation and virtue? of the\nunfortunate Eliza have fallen victims at the shrine of _libertinism_.\nDetested be the epithet. Let it henceforth bear its true signature, and\ncandor itself shall call it _lust_ and _brutality_. Execrable is the\nman, however arrayed in magnificence, crowned with wealth, or decorated\nwith the external graces and accomplishments of fashionable life, who\nshall presume to display them at the expense of virtue and innocence.\nSacred name attended with real blessings--blessings too useful and\nimportant to be trifled away. My resentment at the base arts which must\nhave been employed to complete the seduction of Eliza I cannot suppress.\nI wish them to be exposed, and stamped with universal ignominy. Nor do I\ndoubt but you will join with me in execrating the measures by which _we_\nhave been robbed of so valuable a friend, and _society_ of so ornamental\na member. I am, &c.,\n\nJULIA GRANBY.\n\n\nLETTER LXXII.\n\nTO MR. CHARLES DEIGHTON.\n\nHARTFORD.\n\nConfusion, horror, and despair are the portion of your wretched, unhappy\nfriend. O Deighton, I am undone. Misery irremediable is my future lot.\nShe is gone; yes, she is gone forever. The darling of my soul, the\ncentre of all my wishes and enjoyments, is no more. Cruel fate has\nsnatched her from me, and she is irretrievably lost. I rave, and then\nreflect; I reflect, and then rave. I have no patience to bear this\ncalamity, nor power to remedy it. Where shall I fly from the upbraidings\nof my mind, which accuse me as the murderer of my Eliza? I would fly to\ndeath, and seek a refuge in the grave; but the forebodings of a\nretribution to come I cannot away with. O that I had seen her! that I\nhad once more asked her forgiveness! But even that privilege, that\nconsolation, was denied me! The day on which I meant to visit her, most\nof my property was attached, and, to secure the rest, I was obliged to\nshut my doors and become a prisoner in my own house. High living, and\nold debts incurred by extravagance, had reduced the fortune of my wife\nto very little, and I could not satisfy the clamorous demands of my\ncreditors.\n\nI would have given millions, had I possessed them, to have been at\nliberty to see, and to have had the power to preserve Eliza from death.\nBut in vain was my anxiety; it could not relieve, it could not liberate\nme. When I first heard the dreadful tidings of her exit, I believe I\nacted like a madman; indeed, I am little else now. I have compounded\nwith my creditors, and resigned the whole of my property. Thus that\nsplendor and equipage, to secure which I have sacrificed a virtuous\nwoman, is taken from me. That poverty, the dread of which prevented my\nforming an honorable connection with an amiable and accomplished\ngirl,--the only one I ever loved,--has fallen with redoubled vengeance\nupon my guilty head, and I must become a vagabond on the earth.\n\nI shall fly my country as soon as possible. I shall go from every object\nwhich reminds me of my departed Eliza; but never, never shall I\neradicate from my bosom the idea of her excellence, nor the painful\nremembrance of the injuries I have done her. Her shade will perpetually\nhaunt me; the image of her--as she appeared when mounting the carriage\nwhich conveyed her forever from my sight, waving her hand in token of a\nlast adieu--will always be present to my imagination; the solemn counsel\nshe gave me before we parted, never more to meet, will not cease to\nresound in my ears.\n\nWhile my being is prolonged, I must feel the disgraceful and torturing\neffects of my guilt in seducing her. How madly have I deprived her of\nhappiness, of reputation, of life! Her friends, could they know the\npangs of contrition and the horrors of conscience which attend me,\nwould be amply revenged.\n\nIt is said she quitted the world with composure and peace. Well she\nmight. She had not that insupportable weight of iniquity which sinks me\nto despair. She found consolation in that religion which I have\nridiculed as priestcraft and hypocrisy. But, whether it be true or\nfalse, would to Heaven I could now enjoy the comforts which its votaries\nevidently feel.\n\nMy wife has left me. As we lived together without love, we parted\nwithout regret.\n\nNow, Charles, I am to bid you a long, perhaps a last farewell. Where I\nshall roam in future, I neither know nor care. I shall go where the name\nof Sanford is unknown, and his person and sorrows unnoticed.\n\nIn this happy clime I have nothing to induce my stay. I have not money\nto support me with my profligate companions, nor have I any relish, at\npresent, for their society. By the virtuous part of the community I am\nshunned as the pest and bane of social enjoyment. In short, I am\ndebarred from every kind of happiness. If I look back, I recoil with\nhorror from the black catalogue of vices which have stained my past\nlife, and reduced me to indigence and contempt. If I look forward, I\nshudder at the prospects which my foreboding mind presents to view both\nin this and a coming world. This is a deplorable, yet just, picture of\nmyself. How totally the reverse of what I once appeared!\n\nLet it warn you, my friend, to shun the dangerous paths which I have\ntrodden, that you may never be involved in the hopeless ignominy and\nwretchedness of\n\nPETER SANFORD.\n\n\nLETTER LXXIII.\n\nTO MISS JULIA GRANBY.\n\nBOSTON.\n\nA melancholy tale have you unfolded, my dear Julia; and tragic indeed is\nthe concluding scene.\n\nIs she then gone? gone in this most distressing manner? Have I lost my\nonce-loved friend? lost her in a way which I could never have conceived\nto be possible?\n\nOur days of childhood were spent together in the same pursuits, in the\nsame amusements. Our riper years increased our mutual affection, and\nmaturer judgment most firmly cemented our friendship. Can I, then,\ncalmly resign her to so severe a fate? Can I bear the idea of her being\nlost to honor, to fame, and to life? No; she shall still live in the\nheart of her faithful Lucy, whose experience of her numerous virtues and\nengaging qualities has imprinted her image too deeply on the memory to\nbe obliterated. However she may have erred, her sincere repentance is\nsufficient to restore her to charity.\n\nYour letter gave me the first information of this awful event. I had\ntaken a short excursion into the country, where I had not seen the\npapers, or, if I had, paid little or no attention to them. By your\ndirections I found the distressing narrative of her exit. The poignancy\nof my grief, and the unavailing lamentations which the intelligence\nexcited, need no delineation. To scenes of this nature you have been\nhabituated in the mansion of sorrow where you reside.\n\nHow sincerely I sympathize with the bereaved parent of the dear,\ndeceased Eliza, I can feel, but have not power to express. Let it be her\nconsolation that her child is at rest. The resolution which carried this\ndeluded wanderer thus far from her friends, and supported her through\nher various trials, is astonishing. Happy would it have been had she\nexerted an equal degree of fortitude in repelling the first attacks upon\nher virtue. But she is no more, and Heaven forbid that I should accuse\nor reproach her.\n\nYet in what language shall I express my abhorrence of the monster whose\ndetestable arts have blasted one of the fairest flowers in creation? I\nleave him to God and his own conscience. Already is he exposed in his\ntrue colors. Vengeance already begins to overtake him. His sordid mind\nmust now suffer the deprivation of those sensual gratifications beyond\nwhich he is incapable of enjoyment.\n\nUpon your reflecting and steady mind, my dear Julia, I need not\ninculcate the lessons which may be drawn from this woe-fraught tale; but\nfor the sake of my sex in general, I wish it engraved upon every heart,\nthat virtue alone, independent of the trappings of wealth, the parade of\nequipage, and the adulation of gallantry, can secure lasting felicity.\nFrom the melancholy story of Eliza Wharton let the American fair learn\nto reject with disdain every insinuation derogatory to their true\ndignity and honor. Let them despise and forever banish the man who can\nglory in the seduction of innocence and the ruin of reputation. To\nassociate is to approve; to approve is to be betrayed.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nLUCY SUMNER.\n\n\nLETTER LXXIV.\n\nTO MRS. M. WHARTON.\n\nBOSTON.\n\nDear madam: We have paid the last tribute of respect to your beloved\ndaughter. The day after my arrival, Mrs. Sumner proposed that we should\nvisit the sad spot which contains the remains of our once amiable\nfriend. \"The grave of Eliza Wharton,\" said she, \"shall not be unbedewed\nby the tears of friendship.\"\n\nYesterday we went accordingly, and were much pleased with the apparent\nsincerity of the people in their assurances that every thing in their\npower had been done to render her situation comfortable. The minutest\ncircumstances were faithfully related; and, from the state of her mind\nin her last hours, I think much comfort may be derived to her afflicted\nfriends.\n\nWe spent a mournful hour in the place where she is interred, and then\nreturned to the inn, while Mrs. Sumner gave orders for a decent stone to\nbe erected over her grave, with the following inscription:--\n\n  THIS HUMBLE STONE,\n  IN MEMORY OF\n  ELIZA WHARTON,\n  IS INSCRIBED BY HER WEEPING FRIENDS, TO WHOM SHE\n  ENDEARED HERSELF\n  BY UNCOMMON TENDERNESS AND AFFECTION.\n  ENDOWED WITH SUPERIOR ACQUIREMENTS, SHE WAS STILL MORE\n  DISTINGUISHED\n  BY HUMILITY AND BENEVOLENCE.\n  LET CANDOR THROW A VEIL OVER HER FRAILTIES, FOR GREAT WAS\n  HER CHARITY TO OTHERS.\n  SHE SUSTAINED THE LAST PAINFUL SCENE\n  FAR FROM EVERY FRIEND,\n  AND EXHIBITED AN EXAMPLE OF CALM RESIGNATION.\n  HER DEPARTURE WAS ON THE 25TH DAY OF JULY, A.D.----, IN\n  THE 37TH YEAR OF HER AGE;\n  AND THE TEARS OF STRANGERS WATERED HER GRAVE.\n\nI hope, madam, that you will derive satisfaction from these exertions of\nfriendship, and that, united to the many other sources of consolation\nwith which you are furnished, they may alleviate your grief, and, while\nthey leave the pleasing remembrance of her virtues, add the supporting\npersuasion that your Eliza is happy.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nJULIA GRANBY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Coquette, by Hannah Webster Foster\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE COQUETTE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 12431-8.txt or 12431-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/2\/4\/3\/12431\/\n\nProduced by Curtis Weyant, Erin Martin, Leah Moser and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":838,"split":"train"}
