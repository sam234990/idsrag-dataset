{"ori_id":"760ac32a76b6c6b360c4453cf79724f9fc86b9b2","title":"History of the Peloponnesian War","context":"History of the Peloponnesian War\n The first book of the History, after a brief review of early Greek history and some programmatic historiographical commentary, seeks to explain why the Peloponnesian War broke out when it did and what its causes were. Except for a few short excursuses (notably 6.54-58 on the Tyrant Slayers), the remainder of the History (books 2 through 8) rigidly maintains its focus on the Peloponnesian War to the exclusion of other topics.\nWhile the History concentrates on the military aspects of the Peloponnesian War, it uses these events as a medium to suggest several other themes closely related to the war. It specifically discusses in several passages the socially and culturally degenerative effects of war on humanity itself. The History is especially concerned with the lawlessness and atrocities committed by Greek citizens to each other in the name of one side or another in the war. Some events depicted in the History, such as the Melian dialogue, describe early instances of realpolitik or power politics.\nThe History is preoccupied with the interplay of justice and power in political and military decision-making. Thucydides' presentation is decidedly ambivalent on this theme. While the History seems to suggest that considerations of justice are artificial and necessarily capitulate to power, it sometimes also shows a significant degree of empathy with those who suffer from the exigencies of the war.\nFor the most part, the History does not discuss topics such as the art and architecture of Greece.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The History of the Peloponnesian War, by Thucydides\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

This belief was not without\nits grounds. The preparations of both the combatants were in every\ndepartment in the last state of perfection; and he could see the rest of\nthe Hellenic race taking sides in the quarrel; those who delayed doing\nso at once having it in contemplation. Indeed this was the greatest\nmovement yet known in history, not only of the Hellenes, but of a large\npart of the barbarian world--I had almost said of mankind. For though\nthe events of remote antiquity, and even those that more immediately\npreceded the war, could not from lapse of time be clearly ascertained,\nyet the evidences which an inquiry carried as far back as was\npracticable leads me to trust, all point to the conclusion that there\nwas nothing on a great scale, either in war or in other matters.\n\nFor instance, it is evident that the country now called Hellas had in\nancient times no settled population; on the contrary, migrations were of\nfrequent occurrence, the several tribes readily abandoning their homes\nunder the pressure of superior numbers. Without commerce, without\nfreedom of communication either by land or sea, cultivating no more\nof their territory than the exigencies of life required, destitute of\ncapital, never planting their land (for they could not tell when an\ninvader might not come and take it all away, and when he did come\nthey had no walls to stop him), thinking that the necessities of daily\nsustenance could be supplied at one place as well as another, they cared\nlittle for shifting their habitation, and consequently neither built\nlarge cities nor attained to any other form of greatness. The richest\nsoils were always most subject to this change of masters; such as the\ndistrict now called Thessaly, Boeotia, most of the Peloponnese, Arcadia\nexcepted, and the most fertile parts of the rest of Hellas. The goodness\nof the land favoured the aggrandizement of particular individuals, and\nthus created faction which proved a fertile source of ruin. It also\ninvited invasion. Accordingly Attica, from the poverty of its soil\nenjoying from a very remote period freedom from faction, never changed\nits inhabitants. And here is no inconsiderable exemplification of\nmy assertion that the migrations were the cause of there being no\ncorrespondent growth in other parts. The most powerful victims of war or\nfaction from the rest of Hellas took refuge with the Athenians as a\nsafe retreat; and at an early period, becoming naturalized, swelled the\nalready large population of the city to such a height that Attica became\nat last too small to hold them, and they had to send out colonies to\nIonia.\n\nThere is also another circumstance that contributes not a little to my\nconviction of the weakness of ancient times. Before the Trojan war\nthere is no indication of any common action in Hellas, nor indeed of the\nuniversal prevalence of the name; on the contrary, before the time of\nHellen, son of Deucalion, no such appellation existed, but the country\nwent by the names of the different tribes, in particular of the\nPelasgian. It was not till Hellen and his sons grew strong in Phthiotis,\nand were invited as allies into the other cities, that one by one they\ngradually acquired from the connection the name of Hellenes; though a\nlong time elapsed before that name could fasten itself upon all. The\nbest proof of this is furnished by Homer. Born long after the Trojan\nWar, he nowhere calls all of them by that name, nor indeed any of them\nexcept the followers of Achilles from Phthiotis, who were the original\nHellenes: in his poems they are called Danaans, Argives, and Achaeans.\nHe does not even use the term barbarian, probably because the\nHellenes had not yet been marked off from the rest of the world by one\ndistinctive appellation. It appears therefore that the several Hellenic\ncommunities, comprising not only those who first acquired the name,\ncity by city, as they came to understand each other, but also those who\nassumed it afterwards as the name of the whole people, were before the\nTrojan war prevented by their want of strength and the absence of mutual\nintercourse from displaying any collective action.\n\nIndeed, they could not unite for this expedition till they had gained\nincreased familiarity with the sea. And the first person known to us by\ntradition as having established a navy is Minos. He made himself master\nof what is now called the Hellenic sea, and ruled over the Cyclades,\ninto most of which he sent the first colonies, expelling the Carians\nand appointing his own sons governors; and thus did his best to put down\npiracy in those waters, a necessary step to secure the revenues for his\nown use.\n\nFor in early times the Hellenes and the barbarians of the coast and\nislands, as communication by sea became more common, were tempted to\nturn pirates, under the conduct of their most powerful men; the motives\nbeing to serve their own cupidity and to support the needy. They\nwould fall upon a town unprotected by walls, and consisting of a mere\ncollection of villages, and would plunder it; indeed, this came to be\nthe main source of their livelihood, no disgrace being yet attached to\nsuch an achievement, but even some glory. An illustration of this\nis furnished by the honour with which some of the inhabitants of the\ncontinent still regard a successful marauder, and by the question we\nfind the old poets everywhere representing the people as asking of\nvoyagers--\"Are they pirates?\"--as if those who are asked the question\nwould have no idea of disclaiming the imputation, or their interrogators\nof reproaching them for it. The same rapine prevailed also by land.\n\nAnd even at the present day many of Hellas still follow the old fashion,\nthe Ozolian Locrians for instance, the Aetolians, the Acarnanians, and\nthat region of the continent; and the custom of carrying arms is still\nkept up among these continentals, from the old piratical habits.\nThe whole of Hellas used once to carry arms, their habitations being\nunprotected and their communication with each other unsafe; indeed,\nto wear arms was as much a part of everyday life with them as with the\nbarbarians. And the fact that the people in these parts of Hellas are\nstill living in the old way points to a time when the same mode of life\nwas once equally common to all. The Athenians were the first to lay\naside their weapons, and to adopt an easier and more luxurious mode of\nlife; indeed, it is only lately that their rich old men left off the\nluxury of wearing undergarments of linen, and fastening a knot of their\nhair with a tie of golden grasshoppers, a fashion which spread to\ntheir Ionian kindred and long prevailed among the old men there. On the\ncontrary, a modest style of dressing, more in conformity with modern\nideas, was first adopted by the Lacedaemonians, the rich doing their\nbest to assimilate their way of life to that of the common people.\nThey also set the example of contending naked, publicly stripping and\nanointing themselves with oil in their gymnastic exercises. Formerly,\neven in the Olympic contests, the athletes who contended wore belts\nacross their middles; and it is but a few years since that the practice\nceased. To this day among some of the barbarians, especially in Asia,\nwhen prizes for boxing and wrestling are offered, belts are worn by the\ncombatants. And there are many other points in which a likeness might be\nshown between the life of the Hellenic world of old and the barbarian of\nto-day.\n\nWith respect to their towns, later on, at an era of increased facilities\nof navigation and a greater supply of capital, we find the shores\nbecoming the site of walled towns, and the isthmuses being occupied for\nthe purposes of commerce and defence against a neighbour. But the old\ntowns, on account of the great prevalence of piracy, were built away\nfrom the sea, whether on the islands or the continent, and still remain\nin their old sites. For the pirates used to plunder one another, and\nindeed all coast populations, whether seafaring or not.\n\nThe islanders, too, were great pirates. These islanders were Carians and\nPhoenicians, by whom most of the islands were colonized, as was proved\nby the following fact. During the purification of Delos by Athens in\nthis war all the graves in the island were taken up, and it was found\nthat above half their inmates were Carians: they were identified by the\nfashion of the arms buried with them, and by the method of interment,\nwhich was the same as the Carians still follow. But as soon as Minos\nhad formed his navy, communication by sea became easier, as he colonized\nmost of the islands, and thus expelled the malefactors. The coast\npopulation now began to apply themselves more closely to the acquisition\nof wealth, and their life became more settled; some even began to build\nthemselves walls on the strength of their newly acquired riches. For the\nlove of gain would reconcile the weaker to the dominion of the stronger,\nand the possession of capital enabled the more powerful to reduce the\nsmaller towns to subjection. And it was at a somewhat later stage of\nthis development that they went on the expedition against Troy.\n\nWhat enabled Agamemnon to raise the armament was more, in my opinion,\nhis superiority in strength, than the oaths of Tyndareus, which\nbound the suitors to follow him. Indeed, the account given by those\nPeloponnesians who have been the recipients of the most credible\ntradition is this. First of all Pelops, arriving among a needy\npopulation from Asia with vast wealth, acquired such power that,\nstranger though he was, the country was called after him; and this power\nfortune saw fit materially to increase in the hands of his descendants.\nEurystheus had been killed in Attica by the Heraclids. Atreus was his\nmother's brother; and to the hands of his relation, who had left his\nfather on account of the death of Chrysippus, Eurystheus, when he set\nout on his expedition, had committed Mycenae and the government. As time\nwent on and Eurystheus did not return, Atreus complied with the\nwishes of the Mycenaeans, who were influenced by fear of the\nHeraclids--besides, his power seemed considerable, and he had not\nneglected to court the favour of the populace--and assumed the sceptre\nof Mycenae and the rest of the dominions of Eurystheus. And so the\npower of the descendants of Pelops came to be greater than that of the\ndescendants of Perseus. To all this Agamemnon succeeded. He had also a\nnavy far stronger than his contemporaries, so that, in my opinion,\nfear was quite as strong an element as love in the formation of the\nconfederate expedition. The strength of his navy is shown by the fact\nthat his own was the largest contingent, and that of the Arcadians was\nfurnished by him; this at least is what Homer says, if his testimony is\ndeemed sufficient. Besides, in his account of the transmission of the\nsceptre, he calls him\n\n   Of many an isle, and of all Argos king.\n\nNow Agamemnon's was a continental power; and he could not have been\nmaster of any except the adjacent islands (and these would not be many),\nbut through the possession of a fleet.\n\nAnd from this expedition we may infer the character of earlier\nenterprises. Now Mycenae may have been a small place, and many of the\ntowns of that age may appear comparatively insignificant, but no exact\nobserver would therefore feel justified in rejecting the estimate given\nby the poets and by tradition of the magnitude of the armament. For I\nsuppose if Lacedaemon were to become desolate, and the temples and the\nfoundations of the public buildings were left, that as time went on\nthere would be a strong disposition with posterity to refuse to accept\nher fame as a true exponent of her power. And yet they occupy two-fifths\nof Peloponnese and lead the whole, not to speak of their numerous allies\nwithout. Still, as the city is neither built in a compact form nor\nadorned with magnificent temples and public edifices, but composed of\nvillages after the old fashion of Hellas, there would be an impression\nof inadequacy. Whereas, if Athens were to suffer the same misfortune,\nI suppose that any inference from the appearance presented to the eye\nwould make her power to have been twice as great as it is. We have\ntherefore no right to be sceptical, nor to content ourselves with an\ninspection of a town to the exclusion of a consideration of its power;\nbut we may safely conclude that the armament in question surpassed\nall before it, as it fell short of modern efforts; if we can here also\naccept the testimony of Homer's poems, in which, without allowing for\nthe exaggeration which a poet would feel himself licensed to employ, we\ncan see that it was far from equalling ours. He has represented it as\nconsisting of twelve hundred vessels; the Boeotian complement of each\nship being a hundred and twenty men, that of the ships of Philoctetes\nfifty. By this, I conceive, he meant to convey the maximum and the\nminimum complement: at any rate, he does not specify the amount of any\nothers in his catalogue of the ships. That they were all rowers as well\nas warriors we see from his account of the ships of Philoctetes, in\nwhich all the men at the oar are bowmen. Now it is improbable that\nmany supernumeraries sailed, if we except the kings and high officers;\nespecially as they had to cross the open sea with munitions of war,\nin ships, moreover, that had no decks, but were equipped in the old\npiratical fashion. So that if we strike the average of the largest\nand smallest ships, the number of those who sailed will appear\ninconsiderable, representing, as they did, the whole force of Hellas.\nAnd this was due not so much to scarcity of men as of money. Difficulty\nof subsistence made the invaders reduce the numbers of the army to a\npoint at which it might live on the country during the prosecution of\nthe war. Even after the victory they obtained on their arrival--and a\nvictory there must have been, or the fortifications of the naval camp\ncould never have been built--there is no indication of their whole\nforce having been employed; on the contrary, they seem to have turned to\ncultivation of the Chersonese and to piracy from want of supplies. This\nwas what really enabled the Trojans to keep the field for ten years\nagainst them; the dispersion of the enemy making them always a match for\nthe detachment left behind. If they had brought plenty of supplies with\nthem, and had persevered in the war without scattering for piracy and\nagriculture, they would have easily defeated the Trojans in the field,\nsince they could hold their own against them with the division on\nservice. In short, if they had stuck to the siege, the capture of Troy\nwould have cost them less time and less trouble. But as want of money\nproved the weakness of earlier expeditions, so from the same cause\neven the one in question, more famous than its predecessors, may be\npronounced on the evidence of what it effected to have been inferior to\nits renown and to the current opinion about it formed under the tuition\nof the poets.\n\nEven after the Trojan War, Hellas was still engaged in removing and\nsettling, and thus could not attain to the quiet which must precede\ngrowth. The late return of the Hellenes from Ilium caused many\nrevolutions, and factions ensued almost everywhere; and it was the\ncitizens thus driven into exile who founded the cities. Sixty years\nafter the capture of Ilium, the modern Boeotians were driven out of\nArne by the Thessalians, and settled in the present Boeotia, the former\nCadmeis; though there was a division of them there before, some of whom\njoined the expedition to Ilium. Twenty years later, the Dorians and the\nHeraclids became masters of Peloponnese; so that much had to be done\nand many years had to elapse before Hellas could attain to a durable\ntranquillity undisturbed by removals, and could begin to send out\ncolonies, as Athens did to Ionia and most of the islands, and the\nPeloponnesians to most of Italy and Sicily and some places in the rest\nof Hellas. All these places were founded subsequently to the war with\nTroy.\n\nBut as the power of Hellas grew, and the acquisition of wealth became\nmore an object, the revenues of the states increasing, tyrannies were\nby their means established almost everywhere--the old form of government\nbeing hereditary monarchy with definite prerogatives--and Hellas began\nto fit out fleets and apply herself more closely to the sea. It is said\nthat the Corinthians were the first to approach the modern style of\nnaval architecture, and that Corinth was the first place in Hellas where\ngalleys were built; and we have Ameinocles, a Corinthian shipwright,\nmaking four ships for the Samians. Dating from the end of this war, it\nis nearly three hundred years ago that Ameinocles went to Samos. Again,\nthe earliest sea-fight in history was between the Corinthians and\nCorcyraeans; this was about two hundred and sixty years ago, dating from\nthe same time. Planted on an isthmus, Corinth had from time out of mind\nbeen a commercial emporium; as formerly almost all communication between\nthe Hellenes within and without Peloponnese was carried on overland, and\nthe Corinthian territory was the highway through which it travelled.\nShe had consequently great money resources, as is shown by the epithet\n\"wealthy\" bestowed by the old poets on the place, and this enabled her,\nwhen traffic by sea became more common, to procure her navy and put down\npiracy; and as she could offer a mart for both branches of the trade,\nshe acquired for herself all the power which a large revenue affords.\nSubsequently the Ionians attained to great naval strength in the reign\nof Cyrus, the first king of the Persians, and of his son Cambyses, and\nwhile they were at war with the former commanded for a while the Ionian\nsea. Polycrates also, the tyrant of Samos, had a powerful navy in the\nreign of Cambyses, with which he reduced many of the islands, and among\nthem Rhenea, which he consecrated to the Delian Apollo. About this time\nalso the Phocaeans, while they were founding Marseilles, defeated the\nCarthaginians in a sea-fight. These were the most powerful navies. And\neven these, although so many generations had elapsed since the Trojan\nwar, seem to have been principally composed of the old fifty-oars and\nlong-boats, and to have counted few galleys among their ranks. Indeed it\nwas only shortly the Persian war, and the death of Darius the successor\nof Cambyses, that the Sicilian tyrants and the Corcyraeans acquired any\nlarge number of galleys. For after these there were no navies of any\naccount in Hellas till the expedition of Xerxes; Aegina, Athens, and\nothers may have possessed a few vessels, but they were principally\nfifty-oars. It was quite at the end of this period that the war with\nAegina and the prospect of the barbarian invasion enabled Themistocles\nto persuade the Athenians to build the fleet with which they fought at\nSalamis; and even these vessels had not complete decks.\n\nThe navies, then, of the Hellenes during the period we have traversed\nwere what I have described. All their insignificance did not prevent\ntheir being an element of the greatest power to those who cultivated\nthem, alike in revenue and in dominion. They were the means by which the\nislands were reached and reduced, those of the smallest area falling the\neasiest prey. Wars by land there were none, none at least by which\npower was acquired; we have the usual border contests, but of distant\nexpeditions with conquest for object we hear nothing among the Hellenes.\nThere was no union of subject cities round a great state, no spontaneous\ncombination of equals for confederate expeditions; what fighting there\nwas consisted merely of local warfare between rival neighbours. The\nnearest approach to a coalition took place in the old war between\nChalcis and Eretria; this was a quarrel in which the rest of the\nHellenic name did to some extent take sides.\n\nVarious, too, were the obstacles which the national growth encountered\nin various localities. The power of the Ionians was advancing with rapid\nstrides, when it came into collision with Persia, under King Cyrus, who,\nafter having dethroned Croesus and overrun everything between the Halys\nand the sea, stopped not till he had reduced the cities of the coast;\nthe islands being only left to be subdued by Darius and the Phoenician\nnavy.\n\nAgain, wherever there were tyrants, their habit of providing simply\nfor themselves, of looking solely to their personal comfort and family\naggrandizement, made safety the great aim of their policy, and prevented\nanything great proceeding from them; though they would each have their\naffairs with their immediate neighbours. All this is only true of the\nmother country, for in Sicily they attained to very great power. Thus\nfor a long time everywhere in Hellas do we find causes which make the\nstates alike incapable of combination for great and national ends, or of\nany vigorous action of their own.\n\nBut at last a time came when the tyrants of Athens and the far older\ntyrannies of the rest of Hellas were, with the exception of those in\nSicily, once and for all put down by Lacedaemon; for this city, though\nafter the settlement of the Dorians, its present inhabitants, it\nsuffered from factions for an unparalleled length of time, still at a\nvery early period obtained good laws, and enjoyed a freedom from tyrants\nwhich was unbroken; it has possessed the same form of government for\nmore than four hundred years, reckoning to the end of the late war, and\nhas thus been in a position to arrange the affairs of the other states.\nNot many years after the deposition of the tyrants, the battle of\nMarathon was fought between the Medes and the Athenians. Ten years\nafterwards, the barbarian returned with the armada for the subjugation\nof Hellas. In the face of this great danger, the command of the\nconfederate Hellenes was assumed by the Lacedaemonians in virtue of\ntheir superior power; and the Athenians, having made up their minds to\nabandon their city, broke up their homes, threw themselves into their\nships, and became a naval people. This coalition, after repulsing the\nbarbarian, soon afterwards split into two sections, which included the\nHellenes who had revolted from the King, as well as those who had aided\nhim in the war. At the end of the one stood Athens, at the head of the\nother Lacedaemon, one the first naval, the other the first military\npower in Hellas. For a short time the league held together, till the\nLacedaemonians and Athenians quarrelled and made war upon each other\nwith their allies, a duel into which all the Hellenes sooner or later\nwere drawn, though some might at first remain neutral. So that the whole\nperiod from the Median war to this, with some peaceful intervals, was\nspent by each power in war, either with its rival, or with its own\nrevolted allies, and consequently afforded them constant practice in\nmilitary matters, and that experience which is learnt in the school of\ndanger.\n\nThe policy of Lacedaemon was not to exact tribute from her allies, but\nmerely to secure their subservience to her interests by establishing\noligarchies among them; Athens, on the contrary, had by degrees deprived\nhers of their ships, and imposed instead contributions in money on\nall except Chios and Lesbos. Both found their resources for this\nwar separately to exceed the sum of their strength when the alliance\nflourished intact.\n\nHaving now given the result of my inquiries into early times, I grant\nthat there will be a difficulty in believing every particular detail.\nThe way that most men deal with traditions, even traditions of their\nown country, is to receive them all alike as they are delivered, without\napplying any critical test whatever. The general Athenian public fancy\nthat Hipparchus was tyrant when he fell by the hands of Harmodius\nand Aristogiton, not knowing that Hippias, the eldest of the sons of\nPisistratus, was really supreme, and that Hipparchus and Thessalus were\nhis brothers; and that Harmodius and Aristogiton suspecting, on the very\nday, nay at the very moment fixed on for the deed, that information had\nbeen conveyed to Hippias by their accomplices, concluded that he had\nbeen warned, and did not attack him, yet, not liking to be apprehended\nand risk their lives for nothing, fell upon Hipparchus near the\ntemple of the daughters of Leos, and slew him as he was arranging the\nPanathenaic procession.\n\nThere are many other unfounded ideas current among the rest of the\nHellenes, even on matters of contemporary history, which have not\nbeen obscured by time. For instance, there is the notion that the\nLacedaemonian kings have two votes each, the fact being that they have\nonly one; and that there is a company of Pitane, there being simply no\nsuch thing. So little pains do the vulgar take in the investigation\nof truth, accepting readily the first story that comes to hand. On the\nwhole, however, the conclusions I have drawn from the proofs quoted may,\nI believe, safely be relied on. Assuredly they will not be disturbed\neither by the lays of a poet displaying the exaggeration of his craft,\nor by the compositions of the chroniclers that are attractive at truth's\nexpense; the subjects they treat of being out of the reach of evidence,\nand time having robbed most of them of historical value by enthroning\nthem in the region of legend. Turning from these, we can rest satisfied\nwith having proceeded upon the clearest data, and having arrived at\nconclusions as exact as can be expected in matters of such antiquity.\nTo come to this war: despite the known disposition of the actors in a\nstruggle to overrate its importance, and when it is over to return to\ntheir admiration of earlier events, yet an examination of the facts will\nshow that it was much greater than the wars which preceded it.\n\nWith reference to the speeches in this history, some were delivered\nbefore the war began, others while it was going on; some I heard myself,\nothers I got from various quarters; it was in all cases difficult to\ncarry them word for word in one's memory, so my habit has been to make\nthe speakers say what was in my opinion demanded of them by the various\noccasions, of course adhering as closely as possible to the general\nsense of what they really said. And with reference to the narrative of\nevents, far from permitting myself to derive it from the first source\nthat came to hand, I did not even trust my own impressions, but it\nrests partly on what I saw myself, partly on what others saw for me,\nthe accuracy of the report being always tried by the most severe and\ndetailed tests possible. My conclusions have cost me some labour from\nthe want of coincidence between accounts of the same occurrences by\ndifferent eye-witnesses, arising sometimes from imperfect memory,\nsometimes from undue partiality for one side or the other. The absence\nof romance in my history will, I fear, detract somewhat from its\ninterest; but if it be judged useful by those inquirers who desire\nan exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the interpretation of the\nfuture, which in the course of human things must resemble if it does not\nreflect it, I shall be content. In fine, I have written my work, not as\nan essay which is to win the applause of the moment, but as a possession\nfor all time.\n\nThe Median War, the greatest achievement of past times, yet found a\nspeedy decision in two actions by sea and two by land. The Peloponnesian\nWar was prolonged to an immense length, and, long as it was, it was\nshort without parallel for the misfortunes that it brought upon Hellas.\nNever had so many cities been taken and laid desolate, here by the\nbarbarians, here by the parties contending (the old inhabitants being\nsometimes removed to make room for others); never was there so much\nbanishing and blood-shedding, now on the field of battle, now in the\nstrife of faction. Old stories of occurrences handed down by tradition,\nbut scantily confirmed by experience, suddenly ceased to be incredible;\nthere were earthquakes of unparalleled extent and violence; eclipses of\nthe sun occurred with a frequency unrecorded in previous history; there\nwere great droughts in sundry places and consequent famines, and that\nmost calamitous and awfully fatal visitation, the plague. All this\ncame upon them with the late war, which was begun by the Athenians and\nPeloponnesians by the dissolution of the thirty years' truce made after\nthe conquest of Euboea. To the question why they broke the treaty, I\nanswer by placing first an account of their grounds of complaint and\npoints of difference, that no one may ever have to ask the immediate\ncause which plunged the Hellenes into a war of such magnitude. The\nreal cause I consider to be the one which was formally most kept out\nof sight. The growth of the power of Athens, and the alarm which this\ninspired in Lacedaemon, made war inevitable. Still it is well to give\nthe grounds alleged by either side which led to the dissolution of the\ntreaty and the breaking out of the war.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_Causes of the War--The Affair of Epidamnus--The Affair of Potidaea_\n\nThe city of Epidamnus stands on the right of the entrance of the Ionic\nGulf. Its vicinity is inhabited by the Taulantians, an Illyrian\npeople. The place is a colony from Corcyra, founded by Phalius, son\nof Eratocleides, of the family of the Heraclids, who had according to\nancient usage been summoned for the purpose from Corinth, the mother\ncountry. The colonists were joined by some Corinthians, and others of\nthe Dorian race. Now, as time went on, the city of Epidamnus became\ngreat and populous; but falling a prey to factions arising, it is\nsaid, from a war with her neighbours the barbarians, she became much\nenfeebled, and lost a considerable amount of her power. The last act\nbefore the war was the expulsion of the nobles by the people. The exiled\nparty joined the barbarians, and proceeded to plunder those in the city\nby sea and land; and the Epidamnians, finding themselves hard pressed,\nsent ambassadors to Corcyra beseeching their mother country not to allow\nthem to perish, but to make up matters between them and the exiles,\nand to rid them of the war with the barbarians. The ambassadors seated\nthemselves in the temple of Hera as suppliants, and made the above\nrequests to the Corcyraeans. But the Corcyraeans refused to accept their\nsupplication, and they were dismissed without having effected anything.\n\nWhen the Epidamnians found that no help could be expected from Corcyra,\nthey were in a strait what to do next. So they sent to Delphi and\ninquired of the God whether they should deliver their city to the\nCorinthians and endeavour to obtain some assistance from their founders.\nThe answer he gave them was to deliver the city and place themselves\nunder Corinthian protection. So the Epidamnians went to Corinth and\ndelivered over the colony in obedience to the commands of the oracle.\nThey showed that their founder came from Corinth, and revealed the\nanswer of the god; and they begged them not to allow them to perish,\nbut to assist them. This the Corinthians consented to do. Believing the\ncolony to belong as much to themselves as to the Corcyraeans, they felt\nit to be a kind of duty to undertake their protection. Besides, they\nhated the Corcyraeans for their contempt of the mother country. Instead\nof meeting with the usual honours accorded to the parent city by every\nother colony at public assemblies, such as precedence at sacrifices,\nCorinth found herself treated with contempt by a power which in point of\nwealth could stand comparison with any even of the richest communities\nin Hellas, which possessed great military strength, and which sometimes\ncould not repress a pride in the high naval position of an island\nwhose nautical renown dated from the days of its old inhabitants, the\nPhaeacians. This was one reason of the care that they lavished on their\nfleet, which became very efficient; indeed they began the war with a\nforce of a hundred and twenty galleys.\n\nAll these grievances made Corinth eager to send the promised aid to\nEpidamnus. Advertisement was made for volunteer settlers, and a force of\nAmbraciots, Leucadians, and Corinthians was dispatched. They marched by\nland to Apollonia, a Corinthian colony, the route by sea being avoided\nfrom fear of Corcyraean interruption. When the Corcyraeans heard of the\narrival of the settlers and troops in Epidamnus, and the surrender of\nthe colony to Corinth, they took fire. Instantly putting to sea with\nfive-and-twenty ships, which were quickly followed by others, they\ninsolently commanded the Epidamnians to receive back the banished\nnobles--(it must be premised that the Epidamnian exiles had come to\nCorcyra and, pointing to the sepulchres of their ancestors, had appealed\nto their kindred to restore them)--and to dismiss the Corinthian\ngarrison and settlers. But to all this the Epidamnians turned a deaf\near. Upon this the Corcyraeans commenced operations against them with\na fleet of forty sail. They took with them the exiles, with a view\nto their restoration, and also secured the services of the Illyrians.\nSitting down before the city, they issued a proclamation to the effect\nthat any of the natives that chose, and the foreigners, might depart\nunharmed, with the alternative of being treated as enemies. On their\nrefusal the Corcyraeans proceeded to besiege the city, which stands\non an isthmus; and the Corinthians, receiving intelligence of the\ninvestment of Epidamnus, got together an armament and proclaimed a\ncolony to Epidamnus, perfect political equality being guaranteed to all\nwho chose to go. Any who were not prepared to sail at once might, by\npaying down the sum of fifty Corinthian drachmae, have a share in the\ncolony without leaving Corinth. Great numbers took advantage of this\nproclamation, some being ready to start directly, others paying the\nrequisite forfeit. In case of their passage being disputed by the\nCorcyraeans, several cities were asked to lend them a convoy. Megara\nprepared to accompany them with eight ships, Pale in Cephallonia with\nfour; Epidaurus furnished five, Hermione one, Troezen two, Leucas ten,\nand Ambracia eight. The Thebans and Phliasians were asked for money, the\nEleans for hulls as well; while Corinth herself furnished thirty ships\nand three thousand heavy infantry.\n\nWhen the Corcyraeans heard of their preparations they came to Corinth\nwith envoys from Lacedaemon and Sicyon, whom they persuaded to accompany\nthem, and bade her recall the garrison and settlers, as she had nothing\nto do with Epidamnus. If, however, she had any claims to make, they were\nwilling to submit the matter to the arbitration of such of the cities in\nPeloponnese as should be chosen by mutual agreement, and that the colony\nshould remain with the city to whom the arbitrators might assign it.\nThey were also willing to refer the matter to the oracle at Delphi. If,\nin defiance of their protestations, war was appealed to, they should be\nthemselves compelled by this violence to seek friends in quarters where\nthey had no desire to seek them, and to make even old ties give way to\nthe necessity of assistance. The answer they got from Corinth was that,\nif they would withdraw their fleet and the barbarians from Epidamnus,\nnegotiation might be possible; but, while the town was still being\nbesieged, going before arbitrators was out of the question. The\nCorcyraeans retorted that if Corinth would withdraw her troops from\nEpidamnus they would withdraw theirs, or they were ready to let both\nparties remain in statu quo, an armistice being concluded till judgment\ncould be given.\n\nTurning a deaf ear to all these proposals, when their ships were manned\nand their allies had come in, the Corinthians sent a herald before them\nto declare war and, getting under way with seventy-five ships and two\nthousand heavy infantry, sailed for Epidamnus to give battle to the\nCorcyraeans. The fleet was under the command of Aristeus, son of\nPellichas, Callicrates, son of Callias, and Timanor, son of Timanthes;\nthe troops under that of Archetimus, son of Eurytimus, and Isarchidas,\nson of Isarchus. When they had reached Actium in the territory of\nAnactorium, at the mouth of the mouth of the Gulf of Ambracia, where\nthe temple of Apollo stands, the Corcyraeans sent on a herald in a light\nboat to warn them not to sail against them. Meanwhile they proceeded\nto man their ships, all of which had been equipped for action, the old\nvessels being undergirded to make them seaworthy. On the return of the\nherald without any peaceful answer from the Corinthians, their ships\nbeing now manned, they put out to sea to meet the enemy with a fleet of\neighty sail (forty were engaged in the siege of Epidamnus), formed\nline, and went into action, and gained a decisive victory, and destroyed\nfifteen of the Corinthian vessels. The same day had seen Epidamnus\ncompelled by its besiegers to capitulate; the conditions being that the\nforeigners should be sold, and the Corinthians kept as prisoners of war,\ntill their fate should be otherwise decided.\n\nAfter the engagement the Corcyraeans set up a trophy on Leukimme, a\nheadland of Corcyra, and slew all their captives except the Corinthians,\nwhom they kept as prisoners of war. Defeated at sea, the Corinthians and\ntheir allies repaired home, and left the Corcyraeans masters of all\nthe sea about those parts. Sailing to Leucas, a Corinthian colony, they\nravaged their territory, and burnt Cyllene, the harbour of the Eleans,\nbecause they had furnished ships and money to Corinth. For almost the\nwhole of the period that followed the battle they remained masters of\nthe sea, and the allies of Corinth were harassed by Corcyraean cruisers.\nAt last Corinth, roused by the sufferings of her allies, sent out ships\nand troops in the fall of the summer, who formed an encampment at Actium\nand about Chimerium, in Thesprotis, for the protection of Leucas and\nthe rest of the friendly cities. The Corcyraeans on their part formed a\nsimilar station on Leukimme. Neither party made any movement, but they\nremained confronting each other till the end of the summer, and winter\nwas at hand before either of them returned home.\n\nCorinth, exasperated by the war with the Corcyraeans, spent the whole of\nthe year after the engagement and that succeeding it in building ships,\nand in straining every nerve to form an efficient fleet; rowers being\ndrawn from Peloponnese and the rest of Hellas by the inducement of large\nbounties. The Corcyraeans, alarmed at the news of their preparations,\nbeing without a single ally in Hellas (for they had not enrolled\nthemselves either in the Athenian or in the Lacedaemonian confederacy),\ndecided to repair to Athens in order to enter into alliance and to\nendeavour to procure support from her. Corinth also, hearing of their\nintentions, sent an embassy to Athens to prevent the Corcyraean navy\nbeing joined by the Athenian, and her prospect of ordering the war\naccording to her wishes being thus impeded. An assembly was convoked,\nand the rival advocates appeared: the Corcyraeans spoke as follows:\n\n\"Athenians! when a people that have not rendered any important service\nor support to their neighbours in times past, for which they might claim\nto be repaid, appear before them as we now appear before you to solicit\ntheir assistance, they may fairly be required to satisfy certain\npreliminary conditions. They should show, first, that it is expedient\nor at least safe to grant their request; next, that they will retain a\nlasting sense of the kindness. But if they cannot clearly establish any\nof these points, they must not be annoyed if they meet with a rebuff.\nNow the Corcyraeans believe that with their petition for assistance they\ncan also give you a satisfactory answer on these points, and they have\ntherefore dispatched us hither. It has so happened that our policy as\nregards you with respect to this request, turns out to be inconsistent,\nand as regards our interests, to be at the present crisis inexpedient.\nWe say inconsistent, because a power which has never in the whole of her\npast history been willing to ally herself with any of her neighbours,\nis now found asking them to ally themselves with her. And we say\ninexpedient, because in our present war with Corinth it has left us in\na position of entire isolation, and what once seemed the wise precaution\nof refusing to involve ourselves in alliances with other powers, lest we\nshould also involve ourselves in risks of their choosing, has now proved\nto be folly and weakness. It is true that in the late naval engagement\nwe drove back the Corinthians from our shores single-handed. But they\nhave now got together a still larger armament from Peloponnese and the\nrest of Hellas; and we, seeing our utter inability to cope with them\nwithout foreign aid, and the magnitude of the danger which subjection\nto them implies, find it necessary to ask help from you and from every\nother power. And we hope to be excused if we forswear our old principle\nof complete political isolation, a principle which was not adopted with\nany sinister intention, but was rather the consequence of an error in\njudgment.\n\n\"Now there are many reasons why in the event of your compliance you will\ncongratulate yourselves on this request having been made to you. First,\nbecause your assistance will be rendered to a power which, herself\ninoffensive, is a victim to the injustice of others. Secondly, because\nall that we most value is at stake in the present contest, and your\nwelcome of us under these circumstances will be a proof of goodwill\nwhich will ever keep alive the gratitude you will lay up in our hearts.\nThirdly, yourselves excepted, we are the greatest naval power in Hellas.\nMoreover, can you conceive a stroke of good fortune more rare in\nitself, or more disheartening to your enemies, than that the power whose\nadhesion you would have valued above much material and moral strength\nshould present herself self-invited, should deliver herself into your\nhands without danger and without expense, and should lastly put you\nin the way of gaining a high character in the eyes of the world, the\ngratitude of those whom you shall assist, and a great accession of\nstrength for yourselves? You may search all history without finding\nmany instances of a people gaining all these advantages at once, or\nmany instances of a power that comes in quest of assistance being in\na position to give to the people whose alliance she solicits as much\nsafety and honour as she will receive. But it will be urged that it\nis only in the case of a war that we shall be found useful. To this\nwe answer that if any of you imagine that that war is far off, he is\ngrievously mistaken, and is blind to the fact that Lacedaemon regards\nyou with jealousy and desires war, and that Corinth is powerful\nthere--the same, remember, that is your enemy, and is even now trying\nto subdue us as a preliminary to attacking you. And this she does to\nprevent our becoming united by a common enmity, and her having us both\non her hands, and also to ensure getting the start of you in one of two\nways, either by crippling our power or by making its strength her own.\nNow it is our policy to be beforehand with her--that is, for Corcyra to\nmake an offer of alliance and for you to accept it; in fact, we ought to\nform plans against her instead of waiting to defeat the plans she forms\nagainst us.\n\n\"If she asserts that for you to receive a colony of hers into alliance\nis not right, let her know that every colony that is well treated\nhonours its parent state, but becomes estranged from it by injustice.\nFor colonists are not sent forth on the understanding that they are to\nbe the slaves of those that remain behind, but that they are to be their\nequals. And that Corinth was injuring us is clear. Invited to refer the\ndispute about Epidamnus to arbitration, they chose to prosecute their\ncomplaints war rather than by a fair trial. And let their conduct\ntowards us who are their kindred be a warning to you not to be misled\nby their deceit, nor to yield to their direct requests; concessions to\nadversaries only end in self-reproach, and the more strictly they are\navoided the greater will be the chance of security.\n\n\"If it be urged that your reception of us will be a breach of the treaty\nexisting between you and Lacedaemon, the answer is that we are a neutral\nstate, and that one of the express provisions of that treaty is that\nit shall be competent for any Hellenic state that is neutral to join\nwhichever side it pleases. And it is intolerable for Corinth to be\nallowed to obtain men for her navy not only from her allies, but also\nfrom the rest of Hellas, no small number being furnished by your own\nsubjects; while we are to be excluded both from the alliance left open\nto us by treaty, and from any assistance that we might get from other\nquarters, and you are to be accused of political immorality if you\ncomply with our request. On the other hand, we shall have much greater\ncause to complain of you, if you do not comply with it; if we, who are\nin peril and are no enemies of yours, meet with a repulse at your hands,\nwhile Corinth, who is the aggressor and your enemy, not only meets with\nno hindrance from you, but is even allowed to draw material for war from\nyour dependencies. This ought not to be, but you should either forbid\nher enlisting men in your dominions, or you should lend us too what help\nyou may think advisable.\n\n\"But your real policy is to afford us avowed countenance and support.\nThe advantages of this course, as we premised in the beginning of our\nspeech, are many. We mention one that is perhaps the chief. Could there\nbe a clearer guarantee of our good faith than is offered by the fact\nthat the power which is at enmity with you is also at enmity with us,\nand that that power is fully able to punish defection? And there is a\nwide difference between declining the alliance of an inland and of\na maritime power. For your first endeavour should be to prevent, if\npossible, the existence of any naval power except your own; failing\nthis, to secure the friendship of the strongest that does exist. And if\nany of you believe that what we urge is expedient, but fear to act upon\nthis belief, lest it should lead to a breach of the treaty, you must\nremember that on the one hand, whatever your fears, your strength will\nbe formidable to your antagonists; on the other, whatever the confidence\nyou derive from refusing to receive us, your weakness will have no\nterrors for a strong enemy. You must also remember that your decision\nis for Athens no less than Corcyra, and that you are not making the\nbest provision for her interests, if at a time when you are anxiously\nscanning the horizon that you may be in readiness for the breaking out\nof the war which is all but upon you, you hesitate to attach to your\nside a place whose adhesion or estrangement is alike pregnant with\nthe most vital consequences. For it lies conveniently for the\ncoast-navigation in the direction of Italy and Sicily, being able to bar\nthe passage of naval reinforcements from thence to Peloponnese, and\nfrom Peloponnese thither; and it is in other respects a most desirable\nstation. To sum up as shortly as possible, embracing both general and\nparticular considerations, let this show you the folly of sacrificing\nus. Remember that there are but three considerable naval powers in\nHellas--Athens, Corcyra, and Corinth--and that if you allow two of these\nthree to become one, and Corinth to secure us for herself, you will have\nto hold the sea against the united fleets of Corcyra and Peloponnese.\nBut if you receive us, you will have our ships to reinforce you in the\nstruggle.\"\n\nSuch were the words of the Corcyraeans. After they had finished, the\nCorinthians spoke as follows:\n\n\"These Corcyraeans in the speech we have just heard do not confine\nthemselves to the question of their reception into your alliance. They\nalso talk of our being guilty of injustice, and their being the victims\nof an unjustifiable war. It becomes necessary for us to touch upon both\nthese points before we proceed to the rest of what we have to say, that\nyou may have a more correct idea of the grounds of our claim, and have\ngood cause to reject their petition. According to them, their old policy\nof refusing all offers of alliance was a policy of moderation. It was in\nfact adopted for bad ends, not for good; indeed their conduct is such\nas to make them by no means desirous of having allies present to witness\nit, or of having the shame of asking their concurrence. Besides,\ntheir geographical situation makes them independent of others, and\nconsequently the decision in cases where they injure any lies not with\njudges appointed by mutual agreement, but with themselves, because,\nwhile they seldom make voyages to their neighbours, they are constantly\nbeing visited by foreign vessels which are compelled to put in to\nCorcyra. In short, the object that they propose to themselves, in their\nspecious policy of complete isolation, is not to avoid sharing in the\ncrimes of others, but to secure monopoly of crime to themselves--the\nlicence of outrage wherever they can compel, of fraud wherever they can\nelude, and the enjoyment of their gains without shame. And yet if they\nwere the honest men they pretend to be, the less hold that others had\nupon them, the stronger would be the light in which they might have put\ntheir honesty by giving and taking what was just.\n\n\"But such has not been their conduct either towards others or towards\nus. The attitude of our colony towards us has always been one of\nestrangement and is now one of hostility; for, say they: 'We were not\nsent out to be ill-treated.' We rejoin that we did not found the colony\nto be insulted by them, but to be their head and to be regarded with\na proper respect. At any rate our other colonies honour us, and we\nare much beloved by our colonists; and clearly, if the majority are\nsatisfied with us, these can have no good reason for a dissatisfaction\nin which they stand alone, and we are not acting improperly in making\nwar against them, nor are we making war against them without having\nreceived signal provocation. Besides, if we were in the wrong, it would\nbe honourable in them to give way to our wishes, and disgraceful for us\nto trample on their moderation; but in the pride and licence of wealth\nthey have sinned again and again against us, and never more deeply than\nwhen Epidamnus, our dependency, which they took no steps to claim in its\ndistress upon our coming to relieve it, was by them seized, and is now\nheld by force of arms.\n\n\"As to their allegation that they wished the question to be first\nsubmitted to arbitration, it is obvious that a challenge coming from the\nparty who is safe in a commanding position cannot gain the credit due\nonly to him who, before appealing to arms, in deeds as well as words,\nplaces himself on a level with his adversary. In their case, it was not\nbefore they laid siege to the place, but after they at length understood\nthat we should not tamely suffer it, that they thought of the specious\nword arbitration. And not satisfied with their own misconduct there,\nthey appear here now requiring you to join with them not in alliance but\nin crime, and to receive them in spite of their being at enmity with us.\nBut it was when they stood firmest that they should have made overtures\nto you, and not at a time when we have been wronged and they are in\nperil; nor yet at a time when you will be admitting to a share in your\nprotection those who never admitted you to a share in their power, and\nwill be incurring an equal amount of blame from us with those in whose\noffences you had no hand. No, they should have shared their power with\nyou before they asked you to share your fortunes with them.\n\n\"So then the reality of the grievances we come to complain of, and the\nviolence and rapacity of our opponents, have both been proved. But that\nyou cannot equitably receive them, this you have still to learn. It may\nbe true that one of the provisions of the treaty is that it shall be\ncompetent for any state, whose name was not down on the list, to join\nwhichever side it pleases. But this agreement is not meant for those\nwhose object in joining is the injury of other powers, but for those\nwhose need of support does not arise from the fact of defection, and\nwhose adhesion will not bring to the power that is mad enough to receive\nthem war instead of peace; which will be the case with you, if you\nrefuse to listen to us. For you cannot become their auxiliary and remain\nour friend; if you join in their attack, you must share the punishment\nwhich the defenders inflict on them. And yet you have the best possible\nright to be neutral, or, failing this, you should on the contrary join\nus against them. Corinth is at least in treaty with you; with Corcyra\nyou were never even in truce. But do not lay down the principle that\ndefection is to be patronized. Did we on the defection of the Samians\nrecord our vote against you, when the rest of the Peloponnesian powers\nwere equally divided on the question whether they should assist them?\nNo, we told them to their face that every power has a right to punish\nits own allies. Why, if you make it your policy to receive and assist\nall offenders, you will find that just as many of your dependencies will\ncome over to us, and the principle that you establish will press less\nheavily on us than on yourselves.\n\n\"This then is what Hellenic law entitles us to demand as a right. But\nwe have also advice to offer and claims on your gratitude, which, since\nthere is no danger of our injuring you, as we are not enemies, and since\nour friendship does not amount to very frequent intercourse, we say\nought to be liquidated at the present juncture. When you were in want\nof ships of war for the war against the Aeginetans, before the Persian\ninvasion, Corinth supplied you with twenty vessels. That good turn, and\nthe line we took on the Samian question, when we were the cause of the\nPeloponnesians refusing to assist them, enabled you to conquer Aegina\nand to punish Samos. And we acted thus at crises when, if ever, men are\nwont in their efforts against their enemies to forget everything for the\nsake of victory, regarding him who assists them then as a friend, even\nif thus far he has been a foe, and him who opposes them then as a foe,\neven if he has thus far been a friend; indeed they allow their real\ninterests to suffer from their absorbing preoccupation in the struggle.\n\n\"Weigh well these considerations, and let your youth learn what they are\nfrom their elders, and let them determine to do unto us as we have done\nunto you. And let them not acknowledge the justice of what we say,\nbut dispute its wisdom in the contingency of war. Not only is the\nstraightest path generally speaking the wisest; but the coming of the\nwar, which the Corcyraeans have used as a bugbear to persuade you to do\nwrong, is still uncertain, and it is not worth while to be carried away\nby it into gaining the instant and declared enmity of Corinth. It were,\nrather, wise to try and counteract the unfavourable impression which\nyour conduct to Megara has created. For kindness opportunely shown has a\ngreater power of removing old grievances than the facts of the case\nmay warrant. And do not be seduced by the prospect of a great naval\nalliance. Abstinence from all injustice to other first-rate powers is\na greater tower of strength than anything that can be gained by the\nsacrifice of permanent tranquillity for an apparent temporary advantage.\nIt is now our turn to benefit by the principle that we laid down at\nLacedaemon, that every power has a right to punish her own allies.\nWe now claim to receive the same from you, and protest against your\nrewarding us for benefiting you by our vote by injuring us by yours.\nOn the contrary, return us like for like, remembering that this is\nthat very crisis in which he who lends aid is most a friend, and he who\nopposes is most a foe. And for these Corcyraeans--neither receive them\ninto alliance in our despite, nor be their abettors in crime. So do, and\nyou will act as we have a right to expect of you, and at the same time\nbest consult your own interests.\"\n\nSuch were the words of the Corinthians.\n\nWhen the Athenians had heard both out, two assemblies were held. In the\nfirst there was a manifest disposition to listen to the representations\nof Corinth; in the second, public feeling had changed and an alliance\nwith Corcyra was decided on, with certain reservations. It was to be a\ndefensive, not an offensive alliance. It did not involve a breach of the\ntreaty with Peloponnese: Athens could not be required to join Corcyra in\nany attack upon Corinth. But each of the contracting parties had a right\nto the other's assistance against invasion, whether of his own territory\nor that of an ally. For it began now to be felt that the coming of the\nPeloponnesian war was only a question of time, and no one was willing\nto see a naval power of such magnitude as Corcyra sacrificed to Corinth;\nthough if they could let them weaken each other by mutual conflict, it\nwould be no bad preparation for the struggle which Athens might one day\nhave to wage with Corinth and the other naval powers. At the same time\nthe island seemed to lie conveniently on the coasting passage to Italy\nand Sicily. With these views, Athens received Corcyra into alliance and,\non the departure of the Corinthians not long afterwards, sent ten ships\nto their assistance. They were commanded by Lacedaemonius, the son\nof Cimon, Diotimus, the son of Strombichus, and Proteas, the son of\nEpicles. Their instructions were to avoid collision with the Corinthian\nfleet except under certain circumstances. If it sailed to Corcyra and\nthreatened a landing on her coast, or in any of her possessions, they\nwere to do their utmost to prevent it. These instructions were prompted\nby an anxiety to avoid a breach of the treaty.\n\nMeanwhile the Corinthians completed their preparations, and sailed for\nCorcyra with a hundred and fifty ships. Of these Elis furnished ten,\nMegara twelve, Leucas ten, Ambracia twenty-seven, Anactorium one, and\nCorinth herself ninety. Each of these contingents had its own admiral,\nthe Corinthian being under the command of Xenoclides, son of Euthycles,\nwith four colleagues. Sailing from Leucas, they made land at the part\nof the continent opposite Corcyra. They anchored in the harbour of\nChimerium, in the territory of Thesprotis, above which, at some distance\nfrom the sea, lies the city of Ephyre, in the Elean district. By this\ncity the Acherusian lake pours its waters into the sea. It gets its name\nfrom the river Acheron, which flows through Thesprotis and falls into\nthe lake. There also the river Thyamis flows, forming the boundary\nbetween Thesprotis and Kestrine; and between these rivers rises the\npoint of Chimerium. In this part of the continent the Corinthians now\ncame to anchor, and formed an encampment. When the Corcyraeans saw them\ncoming, they manned a hundred and ten ships, commanded by Meikiades,\nAisimides, and Eurybatus, and stationed themselves at one of the Sybota\nisles; the ten Athenian ships being present. On Point Leukimme they\nposted their land forces, and a thousand heavy infantry who had come\nfrom Zacynthus to their assistance. Nor were the Corinthians on the\nmainland without their allies. The barbarians flocked in large numbers\nto their assistance, the inhabitants of this part of the continent being\nold allies of theirs.\n\nWhen the Corinthian preparations were completed, they took three days'\nprovisions and put out from Chimerium by night, ready for action.\nSailing with the dawn, they sighted the Corcyraean fleet out at sea and\ncoming towards them. When they perceived each other, both sides formed\nin order of battle. On the Corcyraean right wing lay the Athenian ships,\nthe rest of the line being occupied by their own vessels formed in three\nsquadrons, each of which was commanded by one of the three admirals.\nSuch was the Corcyraean formation. The Corinthian was as follows: on the\nright wing lay the Megarian and Ambraciot ships, in the centre the rest\nof the allies in order. But the left was composed of the best sailers\nin the Corinthian navy, to encounter the Athenians and the right wing of\nthe Corcyraeans. As soon as the signals were raised on either side, they\njoined battle. Both sides had a large number of heavy infantry on their\ndecks, and a large number of archers and darters, the old imperfect\narmament still prevailing. The sea-fight was an obstinate one, though\nnot remarkable for its science; indeed it was more like a battle by\nland. Whenever they charged each other, the multitude and crush of the\nvessels made it by no means easy to get loose; besides, their hopes of\nvictory lay principally in the heavy infantry on the decks, who stood\nand fought in order, the ships remaining stationary. The manoeuvre of\nbreaking the line was not tried; in short, strength and pluck had more\nshare in the fight than science. Everywhere tumult reigned, the battle\nbeing one scene of confusion; meanwhile the Athenian ships, by coming\nup to the Corcyraeans whenever they were pressed, served to alarm the\nenemy, though their commanders could not join in the battle from fear of\ntheir instructions. The right wing of the Corinthians suffered most. The\nCorcyraeans routed it, and chased them in disorder to the continent with\ntwenty ships, sailed up to their camp, and burnt the tents which they\nfound empty, and plundered the stuff. So in this quarter the Corinthians\nand their allies were defeated, and the Corcyraeans were victorious.\nBut where the Corinthians themselves were, on the left, they gained\na decided success; the scanty forces of the Corcyraeans being further\nweakened by the want of the twenty ships absent on the pursuit. Seeing\nthe Corcyraeans hard pressed, the Athenians began at length to assist\nthem more unequivocally. At first, it is true, they refrained from\ncharging any ships; but when the rout was becoming patent, and the\nCorinthians were pressing on, the time at last came when every one set\nto, and all distinction was laid aside, and it came to this point, that\nthe Corinthians and Athenians raised their hands against each other.\n\nAfter the rout, the Corinthians, instead of employing themselves in\nlashing fast and hauling after them the hulls of the vessels which they\nhad disabled, turned their attention to the men, whom they butchered as\nthey sailed through, not caring so much to make prisoners. Some even of\ntheir own friends were slain by them, by mistake, in their ignorance of\nthe defeat of the right wing For the number of the ships on both sides,\nand the distance to which they covered the sea, made it difficult, after\nthey had once joined, to distinguish between the conquering and the\nconquered; this battle proving far greater than any before it, any at\nleast between Hellenes, for the number of vessels engaged. After the\nCorinthians had chased the Corcyraeans to the land, they turned to the\nwrecks and their dead, most of whom they succeeded in getting hold of\nand conveying to Sybota, the rendezvous of the land forces furnished by\ntheir barbarian allies. Sybota, it must be known, is a desert harbour of\nThesprotis. This task over, they mustered anew, and sailed against the\nCorcyraeans, who on their part advanced to meet them with all their\nships that were fit for service and remaining to them, accompanied by\nthe Athenian vessels, fearing that they might attempt a landing in their\nterritory. It was by this time getting late, and the paean had been sung\nfor the attack, when the Corinthians suddenly began to back water. They\nhad observed twenty Athenian ships sailing up, which had been sent out\nafterwards to reinforce the ten vessels by the Athenians, who feared, as\nit turned out justly, the defeat of the Corcyraeans and the inability\nof their handful of ships to protect them. These ships were thus seen\nby the Corinthians first. They suspected that they were from Athens, and\nthat those which they saw were not all, but that there were more behind;\nthey accordingly began to retire. The Corcyraeans meanwhile had not\nsighted them, as they were advancing from a point which they could not\nso well see, and were wondering why the Corinthians were backing water,\nwhen some caught sight of them, and cried out that there were ships in\nsight ahead. Upon this they also retired; for it was now getting dark,\nand the retreat of the Corinthians had suspended hostilities. Thus\nthey parted from each other, and the battle ceased with night. The\nCorcyraeans were in their camp at Leukimme, when these twenty ships from\nAthens, under the command of Glaucon, the son of Leagrus, and Andocides,\nson of Leogoras, bore on through the corpses and the wrecks, and sailed\nup to the camp, not long after they were sighted. It was now night, and\nthe Corcyraeans feared that they might be hostile vessels; but they soon\nknew them, and the ships came to anchor.\n\nThe next day the thirty Athenian vessels put out to sea, accompanied by\nall the Corcyraean ships that were seaworthy, and sailed to the harbour\nat Sybota, where the Corinthians lay, to see if they would engage. The\nCorinthians put out from the land and formed a line in the open sea, but\nbeyond this made no further movement, having no intention of assuming\nthe offensive. For they saw reinforcements arrived fresh from Athens,\nand themselves confronted by numerous difficulties, such as the\nnecessity of guarding the prisoners whom they had on board and the want\nof all means of refitting their ships in a desert place. What they were\nthinking more about was how their voyage home was to be effected; they\nfeared that the Athenians might consider that the treaty was dissolved\nby the collision which had occurred, and forbid their departure.\n\nAccordingly they resolved to put some men on board a boat, and send them\nwithout a herald's wand to the Athenians, as an experiment. Having done\nso, they spoke as follows: \"You do wrong, Athenians, to begin war and\nbreak the treaty. Engaged in chastising our enemies, we find you placing\nyourselves in our path in arms against us. Now if your intentions are to\nprevent us sailing to Corcyra, or anywhere else that we may wish, and if\nyou are for breaking the treaty, first take us that are here and treat\nus as enemies.\" Such was what they said, and all the Corcyraean armament\nthat were within hearing immediately called out to take them and kill\nthem. But the Athenians answered as follows: \"Neither are we beginning\nwar, Peloponnesians, nor are we breaking the treaty; but these\nCorcyraeans are our allies, and we are come to help them. So if you want\nto sail anywhere else, we place no obstacle in your way; but if you are\ngoing to sail against Corcyra, or any of her possessions, we shall do\nour best to stop you.\"\n\nReceiving this answer from the Athenians, the Corinthians commenced\npreparations for their voyage home, and set up a trophy in Sybota, on\nthe continent; while the Corcyraeans took up the wrecks and dead that\nhad been carried out to them by the current, and by a wind which rose in\nthe night and scattered them in all directions, and set up their trophy\nin Sybota, on the island, as victors. The reasons each side had for\nclaiming the victory were these. The Corinthians had been victorious\nin the sea-fight until night; and having thus been enabled to carry\noff most wrecks and dead, they were in possession of no fewer than a\nthousand prisoners of war, and had sunk close upon seventy vessels. The\nCorcyraeans had destroyed about thirty ships, and after the arrival of\nthe Athenians had taken up the wrecks and dead on their side; they had\nbesides seen the Corinthians retire before them, backing water on sight\nof the Athenian vessels, and upon the arrival of the Athenians refuse to\nsail out against them from Sybota. Thus both sides claimed the victory.\n\nThe Corinthians on the voyage home took Anactorium, which stands at the\nmouth of the Ambracian gulf. The place was taken by treachery, being\ncommon ground to the Corcyraeans and Corinthians. After establishing\nCorinthian settlers there, they retired home. Eight hundred of the\nCorcyraeans were slaves; these they sold; two hundred and fifty they\nretained in captivity, and treated with great attention, in the hope\nthat they might bring over their country to Corinth on their return;\nmost of them being, as it happened, men of very high position in\nCorcyra. In this way Corcyra maintained her political existence in the\nwar with Corinth, and the Athenian vessels left the island. This was\nthe first cause of the war that Corinth had against the Athenians,\nviz., that they had fought against them with the Corcyraeans in time of\ntreaty.\n\nAlmost immediately after this, fresh differences arose between the\nAthenians and Peloponnesians, and contributed their share to the war.\nCorinth was forming schemes for retaliation, and Athens suspected her\nhostility. The Potidaeans, who inhabit the isthmus of Pallene, being a\nCorinthian colony, but tributary allies of Athens, were ordered to\nraze the wall looking towards Pallene, to give hostages, to dismiss the\nCorinthian magistrates, and in future not to receive the persons sent\nfrom Corinth annually to succeed them. It was feared that they might be\npersuaded by Perdiccas and the Corinthians to revolt, and might draw the\nrest of the allies in the direction of Thrace to revolt with them.\nThese precautions against the Potidaeans were taken by the Athenians\nimmediately after the battle at Corcyra. Not only was Corinth at\nlength openly hostile, but Perdiccas, son of Alexander, king of the\nMacedonians, had from an old friend and ally been made an enemy. He\nhad been made an enemy by the Athenians entering into alliance with his\nbrother Philip and Derdas, who were in league against him. In his alarm\nhe had sent to Lacedaemon to try and involve the Athenians in a war with\nthe Peloponnesians, and was endeavouring to win over Corinth in order\nto bring about the revolt of Potidaea. He also made overtures to the\nChalcidians in the direction of Thrace, and to the Bottiaeans, to\npersuade them to join in the revolt; for he thought that if these places\non the border could be made his allies, it would be easier to carry\non the war with their co-operation. Alive to all this, and wishing to\nanticipate the revolt of the cities, the Athenians acted as follows.\nThey were just then sending off thirty ships and a thousand heavy\ninfantry for his country under the command of Archestratus, son of\nLycomedes, with four colleagues. They instructed the captains to take\nhostages of the Potidaeans, to raze the wall, and to be on their guard\nagainst the revolt of the neighbouring cities.\n\nMeanwhile the Potidaeans sent envoys to Athens on the chance of\npersuading them to take no new steps in their matters; they also went\nto Lacedaemon with the Corinthians to secure support in case of need.\nFailing after prolonged negotiation to obtain anything satisfactory\nfrom the Athenians; being unable, for all they could say, to prevent the\nvessels that were destined for Macedonia from also sailing against them;\nand receiving from the Lacedaemonian government a promise to invade\nAttica, if the Athenians should attack Potidaea, the Potidaeans, thus\nfavoured by the moment, at last entered into league with the Chalcidians\nand Bottiaeans, and revolted. And Perdiccas induced the Chalcidians to\nabandon and demolish their towns on the seaboard and, settling inland at\nOlynthus, to make that one city a strong place: meanwhile to those who\nfollowed his advice he gave a part of his territory in Mygdonia round\nLake Bolbe as a place of abode while the war against the Athenians\nshould last. They accordingly demolished their towns, removed inland and\nprepared for war. The thirty ships of the Athenians, arriving before\nthe Thracian places, found Potidaea and the rest in revolt. Their\ncommanders, considering it to be quite impossible with their present\nforce to carry on war with Perdiccas and with the confederate towns\nas well turned to Macedonia, their original destination, and, having\nestablished themselves there, carried on war in co-operation with\nPhilip, and the brothers of Derdas, who had invaded the country from the\ninterior.\n\nMeanwhile the Corinthians, with Potidaea in revolt and the Athenian\nships on the coast of Macedonia, alarmed for the safety of the place\nand thinking its danger theirs, sent volunteers from Corinth, and\nmercenaries from the rest of Peloponnese, to the number of sixteen\nhundred heavy infantry in all, and four hundred light troops. Aristeus,\nson of Adimantus, who was always a steady friend to the Potidaeans, took\ncommand of the expedition, and it was principally for love of him that\nmost of the men from Corinth volunteered. They arrived in Thrace forty\ndays after the revolt of Potidaea.\n\nThe Athenians also immediately received the news of the revolt of the\ncities. On being informed that Aristeus and his reinforcements were on\ntheir way, they sent two thousand heavy infantry of their own citizens\nand forty ships against the places in revolt, under the command\nof Callias, son of Calliades, and four colleagues. They arrived in\nMacedonia first, and found the force of a thousand men that had been\nfirst sent out, just become masters of Therme and besieging Pydna.\nAccordingly they also joined in the investment, and besieged Pydna for\na while. Subsequently they came to terms and concluded a forced alliance\nwith Perdiccas, hastened by the calls of Potidaea and by the arrival of\nAristeus at that place. They withdrew from Macedonia, going to Beroea\nand thence to Strepsa, and, after a futile attempt on the latter place,\nthey pursued by land their march to Potidaea with three thousand heavy\ninfantry of their own citizens, besides a number of their allies, and\nsix hundred Macedonian horsemen, the followers of Philip and Pausanias.\nWith these sailed seventy ships along the coast. Advancing by short\nmarches, on the third day they arrived at Gigonus, where they encamped.\n\nMeanwhile the Potidaeans and the Peloponnesians with Aristeus were\nencamped on the side looking towards Olynthus on the isthmus, in\nexpectation of the Athenians, and had established their market outside\nthe city. The allies had chosen Aristeus general of all the infantry;\nwhile the command of the cavalry was given to Perdiccas, who had at\nonce left the alliance of the Athenians and gone back to that of the\nPotidaeans, having deputed Iolaus as his general: The plan of Aristeus\nwas to keep his own force on the isthmus, and await the attack of the\nAthenians; leaving the Chalcidians and the allies outside the isthmus,\nand the two hundred cavalry from Perdiccas in Olynthus to act upon the\nAthenian rear, on the occasion of their advancing against him; and thus\nto place the enemy between two fires. While Callias the Athenian general\nand his colleagues dispatched the Macedonian horse and a few of the\nallies to Olynthus, to prevent any movement being made from that\nquarter, the Athenians themselves broke up their camp and marched\nagainst Potidaea. After they had arrived at the isthmus, and saw the\nenemy preparing for battle, they formed against him, and soon afterwards\nengaged. The wing of Aristeus, with the Corinthians and other picked\ntroops round him, routed the wing opposed to it, and followed for\na considerable distance in pursuit. But the rest of the army of the\nPotidaeans and of the Peloponnesians was defeated by the Athenians,\nand took refuge within the fortifications. Returning from the pursuit,\nAristeus perceived the defeat of the rest of the army. Being at a\nloss which of the two risks to choose, whether to go to Olynthus or to\nPotidaea, he at last determined to draw his men into as small a space\nas possible, and force his way with a run into Potidaea. Not without\ndifficulty, through a storm of missiles, he passed along by the\nbreakwater through the sea, and brought off most of his men safe,\nthough a few were lost. Meanwhile the auxiliaries of the Potidaeans from\nOlynthus, which is about seven miles off and in sight of Potidaea, when\nthe battle began and the signals were raised, advanced a little way\nto render assistance; and the Macedonian horse formed against them to\nprevent it. But on victory speedily declaring for the Athenians and the\nsignals being taken down, they retired back within the wall; and the\nMacedonians returned to the Athenians. Thus there were no cavalry\npresent on either side. After the battle the Athenians set up a trophy,\nand gave back their dead to the Potidaeans under truce. The Potidaeans\nand their allies had close upon three hundred killed; the Athenians a\nhundred and fifty of their own citizens, and Callias their general.\n\nThe wall on the side of the isthmus had now works at once raised against\nit, and manned by the Athenians. That on the side of Pallene had no\nworks raised against it. They did not think themselves strong enough at\nonce to keep a garrison in the isthmus and to cross over to Pallene and\nraise works there; they were afraid that the Potidaeans and their allies\nmight take advantage of their division to attack them. Meanwhile the\nAthenians at home learning that there were no works at Pallene, some\ntime afterwards sent off sixteen hundred heavy infantry of their own\ncitizens under the command of Phormio, son of Asopius. Arrived at\nPallene, he fixed his headquarters at Aphytis, and led his army against\nPotidaea by short marches, ravaging the country as he advanced. No one\nventuring to meet him in the field, he raised works against the wall\non the side of Pallene. So at length Potidaea was strongly invested on\neither side, and from the sea by the ships co-operating in the blockade.\nAristeus, seeing its investment complete, and having no hope of its\nsalvation, except in the event of some movement from the Peloponnese, or\nof some other improbable contingency, advised all except five hundred\nto watch for a wind and sail out of the place, in order that their\nprovisions might last the longer. He was willing to be himself one of\nthose who remained. Unable to persuade them, and desirous of acting on\nthe next alternative, and of having things outside in the best posture\npossible, he eluded the guardships of the Athenians and sailed out.\nRemaining among the Chalcidians, he continued to carry on the war; in\nparticular he laid an ambuscade near the city of the Sermylians, and cut\noff many of them; he also communicated with Peloponnese, and tried to\ncontrive some method by which help might be brought. Meanwhile, after\nthe completion of the investment of Potidaea, Phormio next employed\nhis sixteen hundred men in ravaging Chalcidice and Bottica: some of the\ntowns also were taken by him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Congress of the Peloponnesian Confederacy at Lacedaemon_\n\nThe Athenians and Peloponnesians had these antecedent grounds of\ncomplaint against each other: the complaint of Corinth was that her\ncolony of Potidaea, and Corinthian and Peloponnesian citizens within it,\nwere being besieged; that of Athens against the Peloponnesians that they\nhad incited a town of hers, a member of her alliance and a contributor\nto her revenue, to revolt, and had come and were openly fighting against\nher on the side of the Potidaeans. For all this, war had not yet\nbroken out: there was still truce for a while; for this was a private\nenterprise on the part of Corinth.\n\nBut the siege of Potidaea put an end to her inaction; she had men inside\nit: besides, she feared for the place. Immediately summoning the allies\nto Lacedaemon, she came and loudly accused Athens of breach of the\ntreaty and aggression on the rights of Peloponnese. With her, the\nAeginetans, formally unrepresented from fear of Athens, in secret proved\nnot the least urgent of the advocates for war, asserting that they had\nnot the independence guaranteed to them by the treaty. After extending\nthe summons to any of their allies and others who might have complaints\nto make of Athenian aggression, the Lacedaemonians held their ordinary\nassembly, and invited them to speak. There were many who came forward\nand made their several accusations; among them the Megarians, in a\nlong list of grievances, called special attention to the fact of their\nexclusion from the ports of the Athenian empire and the market of\nAthens, in defiance of the treaty. Last of all the Corinthians\ncame forward, and having let those who preceded them inflame the\nLacedaemonians, now followed with a speech to this effect:\n\n\"Lacedaemonians! the confidence which you feel in your constitution and\nsocial order, inclines you to receive any reflections of ours on other\npowers with a certain scepticism. Hence springs your moderation, but\nhence also the rather limited knowledge which you betray in dealing with\nforeign politics. Time after time was our voice raised to warn you of\nthe blows about to be dealt us by Athens, and time after time, instead\nof taking the trouble to ascertain the worth of our communications, you\ncontented yourselves with suspecting the speakers of being inspired\nby private interest. And so, instead of calling these allies together\nbefore the blow fell, you have delayed to do so till we are smarting\nunder it; allies among whom we have not the worst title to speak, as\nhaving the greatest complaints to make, complaints of Athenian outrage\nand Lacedaemonian neglect. Now if these assaults on the rights of Hellas\nhad been made in the dark, you might be unacquainted with the facts, and\nit would be our duty to enlighten you. As it is, long speeches are not\nneeded where you see servitude accomplished for some of us, meditated\nfor others--in particular for our allies--and prolonged preparations in\nthe aggressor against the hour of war. Or what, pray, is the meaning of\ntheir reception of Corcyra by fraud, and their holding it against us\nby force? what of the siege of Potidaea?--places one of which lies most\nconveniently for any action against the Thracian towns; while the other\nwould have contributed a very large navy to the Peloponnesians?\n\n\"For all this you are responsible. You it was who first allowed them\nto fortify their city after the Median war, and afterwards to erect the\nlong walls--you who, then and now, are always depriving of freedom not\nonly those whom they have enslaved, but also those who have as yet been\nyour allies. For the true author of the subjugation of a people is not\nso much the immediate agent, as the power which permits it having the\nmeans to prevent it; particularly if that power aspires to the glory of\nbeing the liberator of Hellas. We are at last assembled. It has not been\neasy to assemble, nor even now are our objects defined. We ought not to\nbe still inquiring into the fact of our wrongs, but into the means of\nour defence. For the aggressors with matured plans to oppose to our\nindecision have cast threats aside and betaken themselves to action. And\nwe know what are the paths by which Athenian aggression travels, and how\ninsidious is its progress. A degree of confidence she may feel from the\nidea that your bluntness of perception prevents your noticing her; but\nit is nothing to the impulse which her advance will receive from\nthe knowledge that you see, but do not care to interfere. You,\nLacedaemonians, of all the Hellenes are alone inactive, and defend\nyourselves not by doing anything but by looking as if you would do\nsomething; you alone wait till the power of an enemy is becoming twice\nits original size, instead of crushing it in its infancy. And yet the\nworld used to say that you were to be depended upon; but in your case,\nwe fear, it said more than the truth. The Mede, we ourselves know, had\ntime to come from the ends of the earth to Peloponnese, without any\nforce of yours worthy of the name advancing to meet him. But this was a\ndistant enemy. Well, Athens at all events is a near neighbour, and yet\nAthens you utterly disregard; against Athens you prefer to act on the\ndefensive instead of on the offensive, and to make it an affair of\nchances by deferring the struggle till she has grown far stronger than\nat first. And yet you know that on the whole the rock on which the\nbarbarian was wrecked was himself, and that if our present enemy Athens\nhas not again and again annihilated us, we owe it more to her blunders\nthan to your protection; Indeed, expectations from you have before now\nbeen the ruin of some, whose faith induced them to omit preparation.\n\n\"We hope that none of you will consider these words of remonstrance to\nbe rather words of hostility; men remonstrate with friends who are\nin error, accusations they reserve for enemies who have wronged them.\nBesides, we consider that we have as good a right as any one to point\nout a neighbour's faults, particularly when we contemplate the great\ncontrast between the two national characters; a contrast of which,\nas far as we can see, you have little perception, having never yet\nconsidered what sort of antagonists you will encounter in the Athenians,\nhow widely, how absolutely different from yourselves. The Athenians are\naddicted to innovation, and their designs are characterized by swiftness\nalike in conception and execution; you have a genius for keeping what\nyou have got, accompanied by a total want of invention, and when forced\nto act you never go far enough. Again, they are adventurous beyond\ntheir power, and daring beyond their judgment, and in danger they are\nsanguine; your wont is to attempt less than is justified by your power,\nto mistrust even what is sanctioned by your judgment, and to fancy that\nfrom danger there is no release. Further, there is promptitude on their\nside against procrastination on yours; they are never at home, you\nare never from it: for they hope by their absence to extend their\nacquisitions, you fear by your advance to endanger what you have left\nbehind. They are swift to follow up a success, and slow to recoil from a\nreverse. Their bodies they spend ungrudgingly in their country's cause;\ntheir intellect they jealously husband to be employed in her service. A\nscheme unexecuted is with them a positive loss, a successful enterprise\na comparative failure. The deficiency created by the miscarriage of an\nundertaking is soon filled up by fresh hopes; for they alone are enabled\nto call a thing hoped for a thing got, by the speed with which they act\nupon their resolutions. Thus they toil on in trouble and danger all the\ndays of their life, with little opportunity for enjoying, being ever\nengaged in getting: their only idea of a holiday is to do what the\noccasion demands, and to them laborious occupation is less of a\nmisfortune than the peace of a quiet life. To describe their character\nin a word, one might truly say that they were born into the world to\ntake no rest themselves and to give none to others.\n\n\"Such is Athens, your antagonist. And yet, Lacedaemonians, you still\ndelay, and fail to see that peace stays longest with those, who are not\nmore careful to use their power justly than to show their determination\nnot to submit to injustice. On the contrary, your ideal of fair dealing\nis based on the principle that, if you do not injure others, you need\nnot risk your own fortunes in preventing others from injuring you. Now\nyou could scarcely have succeeded in such a policy even with a neighbour\nlike yourselves; but in the present instance, as we have just shown,\nyour habits are old-fashioned as compared with theirs. It is the law as\nin art, so in politics, that improvements ever prevail; and though fixed\nusages may be best for undisturbed communities, constant necessities of\naction must be accompanied by the constant improvement of methods. Thus\nit happens that the vast experience of Athens has carried her further\nthan you on the path of innovation.\n\n\"Here, at least, let your procrastination end. For the present, assist\nyour allies and Potidaea in particular, as you promised, by a speedy\ninvasion of Attica, and do not sacrifice friends and kindred to their\nbitterest enemies, and drive the rest of us in despair to some other\nalliance. Such a step would not be condemned either by the Gods who\nreceived our oaths, or by the men who witnessed them. The breach of a\ntreaty cannot be laid to the people whom desertion compels to seek new\nrelations, but to the power that fails to assist its confederate. But if\nyou will only act, we will stand by you; it would be unnatural for us to\nchange, and never should we meet with such a congenial ally. For these\nreasons choose the right course, and endeavour not to let Peloponnese\nunder your supremacy degenerate from the prestige that it enjoyed under\nthat of your ancestors.\"\n\nSuch were the words of the Corinthians. There happened to be Athenian\nenvoys present at Lacedaemon on other business. On hearing the speeches\nthey thought themselves called upon to come before the Lacedaemonians.\nTheir intention was not to offer a defence on any of the charges which\nthe cities brought against them, but to show on a comprehensive view\nthat it was not a matter to be hastily decided on, but one that demanded\nfurther consideration. There was also a wish to call attention to\nthe great power of Athens, and to refresh the memory of the old and\nenlighten the ignorance of the young, from a notion that their words\nmight have the effect of inducing them to prefer tranquillity to war. So\nthey came to the Lacedaemonians and said that they too, if there was no\nobjection, wished to speak to their assembly. They replied by inviting\nthem to come forward. The Athenians advanced, and spoke as follows:\n\n\"The object of our mission here was not to argue with your allies, but\nto attend to the matters on which our state dispatched us. However, the\nvehemence of the outcry that we hear against us has prevailed on us to\ncome forward. It is not to combat the accusations of the cities (indeed\nyou are not the judges before whom either we or they can plead), but to\nprevent your taking the wrong course on matters of great importance by\nyielding too readily to the persuasions of your allies. We also wish to\nshow on a review of the whole indictment that we have a fair title to\nour possessions, and that our country has claims to consideration. We\nneed not refer to remote antiquity: there we could appeal to the voice\nof tradition, but not to the experience of our audience. But to the\nMedian War and contemporary history we must refer, although we are\nrather tired of continually bringing this subject forward. In our action\nduring that war we ran great risk to obtain certain advantages: you had\nyour share in the solid results, do not try to rob us of all share in\nthe good that the glory may do us. However, the story shall be told not\nso much to deprecate hostility as to testify against it, and to show,\nif you are so ill advised as to enter into a struggle with Athens, what\nsort of an antagonist she is likely to prove. We assert that at Marathon\nwe were at the front, and faced the barbarian single-handed. That when\nhe came the second time, unable to cope with him by land we went\non board our ships with all our people, and joined in the action at\nSalamis. This prevented his taking the Peloponnesian states in detail,\nand ravaging them with his fleet; when the multitude of his vessels\nwould have made any combination for self-defence impossible. The best\nproof of this was furnished by the invader himself. Defeated at sea, he\nconsidered his power to be no longer what it had been, and retired as\nspeedily as possible with the greater part of his army.\n\n\"Such, then, was the result of the matter, and it was clearly proved\nthat it was on the fleet of Hellas that her cause depended. Well, to\nthis result we contributed three very useful elements, viz., the\nlargest number of ships, the ablest commander, and the most unhesitating\npatriotism. Our contingent of ships was little less than two-thirds of\nthe whole four hundred; the commander was Themistocles, through\nwhom chiefly it was that the battle took place in the straits, the\nacknowledged salvation of our cause. Indeed, this was the reason of\nyour receiving him with honours such as had never been accorded to any\nforeign visitor. While for daring patriotism we had no competitors.\nReceiving no reinforcements from behind, seeing everything in front of\nus already subjugated, we had the spirit, after abandoning our city,\nafter sacrificing our property (instead of deserting the remainder of\nthe league or depriving them of our services by dispersing), to throw\nourselves into our ships and meet the danger, without a thought of\nresenting your neglect to assist us. We assert, therefore, that we\nconferred on you quite as much as we received. For you had a stake to\nfight for; the cities which you had left were still filled with your\nhomes, and you had the prospect of enjoying them again; and your coming\nwas prompted quite as much by fear for yourselves as for us; at all\nevents, you never appeared till we had nothing left to lose. But we left\nbehind us a city that was a city no longer, and staked our lives for a\ncity that had an existence only in desperate hope, and so bore our full\nshare in your deliverance and in ours. But if we had copied others, and\nallowed fears for our territory to make us give in our adhesion to the\nMede before you came, or if we had suffered our ruin to break our spirit\nand prevent us embarking in our ships, your naval inferiority would have\nmade a sea-fight unnecessary, and his objects would have been peaceably\nattained.\n\n\"Surely, Lacedaemonians, neither by the patriotism that we displayed at\nthat crisis, nor by the wisdom of our counsels, do we merit our extreme\nunpopularity with the Hellenes, not at least unpopularity for our\nempire. That empire we acquired by no violent means, but because you\nwere unwilling to prosecute to its conclusion the war against the\nbarbarian, and because the allies attached themselves to us and\nspontaneously asked us to assume the command. And the nature of the case\nfirst compelled us to advance our empire to its present height; fear\nbeing our principal motive, though honour and interest afterwards\ncame in. And at last, when almost all hated us, when some had already\nrevolted and had been subdued, when you had ceased to be the friends\nthat you once were, and had become objects of suspicion and dislike,\nit appeared no longer safe to give up our empire; especially as all\nwho left us would fall to you. And no one can quarrel with a people for\nmaking, in matters of tremendous risk, the best provision that it can\nfor its interest.\n\n\"You, at all events, Lacedaemonians, have used your supremacy to settle\nthe states in Peloponnese as is agreeable to you. And if at the period\nof which we were speaking you had persevered to the end of the matter,\nand had incurred hatred in your command, we are sure that you would\nhave made yourselves just as galling to the allies, and would have been\nforced to choose between a strong government and danger to yourselves.\nIt follows that it was not a very wonderful action, or contrary to the\ncommon practice of mankind, if we did accept an empire that was offered\nto us, and refused to give it up under the pressure of three of the\nstrongest motives, fear, honour, and interest. And it was not we who\nset the example, for it has always been law that the weaker should be\nsubject to the stronger. Besides, we believed ourselves to be worthy\nof our position, and so you thought us till now, when calculations of\ninterest have made you take up the cry of justice--a consideration which\nno one ever yet brought forward to hinder his ambition when he had a\nchance of gaining anything by might. And praise is due to all who,\nif not so superior to human nature as to refuse dominion, yet respect\njustice more than their position compels them to do.\n\n\"We imagine that our moderation would be best demonstrated by the\nconduct of others who should be placed in our position; but even our\nequity has very unreasonably subjected us to condemnation instead of\napproval. Our abatement of our rights in the contract trials with our\nallies, and our causing them to be decided by impartial laws at Athens,\nhave gained us the character of being litigious. And none care to\ninquire why this reproach is not brought against other imperial powers,\nwho treat their subjects with less moderation than we do; the secret\nbeing that where force can be used, law is not needed. But our subjects\nare so habituated to associate with us as equals that any defeat\nwhatever that clashes with their notions of justice, whether it proceeds\nfrom a legal judgment or from the power which our empire gives us, makes\nthem forget to be grateful for being allowed to retain most of their\npossessions, and more vexed at a part being taken, than if we had from\nthe first cast law aside and openly gratified our covetousness. If we\nhad done so, not even would they have disputed that the weaker must give\nway to the stronger. Men's indignation, it seems, is more excited by\nlegal wrong than by violent wrong; the first looks like being cheated by\nan equal, the second like being compelled by a superior. At all events\nthey contrived to put up with much worse treatment than this from the\nMede, yet they think our rule severe, and this is to be expected, for\nthe present always weighs heavy on the conquered. This at least is\ncertain. If you were to succeed in overthrowing us and in taking our\nplace, you would speedily lose the popularity with which fear of us\nhas invested you, if your policy of to-day is at all to tally with\nthe sample that you gave of it during the brief period of your command\nagainst the Mede. Not only is your life at home regulated by rules and\ninstitutions incompatible with those of others, but your citizens abroad\nact neither on these rules nor on those which are recognized by the rest\nof Hellas.\n\n\"Take time then in forming your resolution, as the matter is of great\nimportance; and do not be persuaded by the opinions and complaints of\nothers to bring trouble on yourselves, but consider the vast influence\nof accident in war, before you are engaged in it. As it continues, it\ngenerally becomes an affair of chances, chances from which neither of\nus is exempt, and whose event we must risk in the dark. It is a common\nmistake in going to war to begin at the wrong end, to act first, and\nwait for disaster to discuss the matter. But we are not yet by any means\nso misguided, nor, so far as we can see, are you; accordingly, while it\nis still open to us both to choose aright, we bid you not to dissolve\nthe treaty, or to break your oaths, but to have our differences settled\nby arbitration according to our agreement. Or else we take the gods who\nheard the oaths to witness, and if you begin hostilities, whatever line\nof action you choose, we will try not to be behindhand in repelling\nyou.\"\n\nSuch were the words of the Athenians. After the Lacedaemonians had heard\nthe complaints of the allies against the Athenians, and the observations\nof the latter, they made all withdraw, and consulted by themselves on\nthe question before them. The opinions of the majority all led to the\nsame conclusion; the Athenians were open aggressors, and war must be\ndeclared at once. But Archidamus, the Lacedaemonian king, came forward,\nwho had the reputation of being at once a wise and a moderate man, and\nmade the following speech:\n\n\"I have not lived so long, Lacedaemonians, without having had the\nexperience of many wars, and I see those among you of the same age as\nmyself, who will not fall into the common misfortune of longing for\nwar from inexperience or from a belief in its advantage and its safety.\nThis, the war on which you are now debating, would be one of the\ngreatest magnitude, on a sober consideration of the matter. In a\nstruggle with Peloponnesians and neighbours our strength is of the same\ncharacter, and it is possible to move swiftly on the different points.\nBut a struggle with a people who live in a distant land, who have also\nan extraordinary familiarity with the sea, and who are in the highest\nstate of preparation in every other department; with wealth private and\npublic, with ships, and horses, and heavy infantry, and a population\nsuch as no one other Hellenic place can equal, and lastly a number\nof tributary allies--what can justify us in rashly beginning such a\nstruggle? wherein is our trust that we should rush on it unprepared? Is\nit in our ships? There we are inferior; while if we are to practise and\nbecome a match for them, time must intervene. Is it in our money? There\nwe have a far greater deficiency. We neither have it in our treasury,\nnor are we ready to contribute it from our private funds. Confidence\nmight possibly be felt in our superiority in heavy infantry and\npopulation, which will enable us to invade and devastate their lands.\nBut the Athenians have plenty of other land in their empire, and\ncan import what they want by sea. Again, if we are to attempt an\ninsurrection of their allies, these will have to be supported with a\nfleet, most of them being islanders. What then is to be our war? For\nunless we can either beat them at sea, or deprive them of the revenues\nwhich feed their navy, we shall meet with little but disaster. Meanwhile\nour honour will be pledged to keeping on, particularly if it be the\nopinion that we began the quarrel. For let us never be elated by the\nfatal hope of the war being quickly ended by the devastation of their\nlands. I fear rather that we may leave it as a legacy to our children;\nso improbable is it that the Athenian spirit will be the slave of their\nland, or Athenian experience be cowed by war.\n\n\"Not that I would bid you be so unfeeling as to suffer them to injure\nyour allies, and to refrain from unmasking their intrigues; but I do bid\nyou not to take up arms at once, but to send and remonstrate with\nthem in a tone not too suggestive of war, nor again too suggestive\nof submission, and to employ the interval in perfecting our own\npreparations. The means will be, first, the acquisition of allies,\nHellenic or barbarian it matters not, so long as they are an accession\nto our strength naval or pecuniary--I say Hellenic or barbarian, because\nthe odium of such an accession to all who like us are the objects of\nthe designs of the Athenians is taken away by the law of\nself-preservation--and secondly the development of our home resources.\nIf they listen to our embassy, so much the better; but if not, after\nthe lapse of two or three years our position will have become materially\nstrengthened, and we can then attack them if we think proper. Perhaps\nby that time the sight of our preparations, backed by language equally\nsignificant, will have disposed them to submission, while their land\nis still untouched, and while their counsels may be directed to the\nretention of advantages as yet undestroyed. For the only light in which\nyou can view their land is that of a hostage in your hands, a hostage\nthe more valuable the better it is cultivated. This you ought to spare\nas long as possible, and not make them desperate, and so increase the\ndifficulty of dealing with them. For if while still unprepared, hurried\naway by the complaints of our allies, we are induced to lay it waste,\nhave a care that we do not bring deep disgrace and deep perplexity upon\nPeloponnese. Complaints, whether of communities or individuals, it is\npossible to adjust; but war undertaken by a coalition for sectional\ninterests, whose progress there is no means of foreseeing, does not\neasily admit of creditable settlement.\n\n\"And none need think it cowardice for a number of confederates to pause\nbefore they attack a single city. The Athenians have allies as numerous\nas our own, and allies that pay tribute, and war is a matter not so much\nof arms as of money, which makes arms of use. And this is more than ever\ntrue in a struggle between a continental and a maritime power. First,\nthen, let us provide money, and not allow ourselves to be carried away\nby the talk of our allies before we have done so: as we shall have the\nlargest share of responsibility for the consequences be they good or\nbad, we have also a right to a tranquil inquiry respecting them.\n\n\"And the slowness and procrastination, the parts of our character that\nare most assailed by their criticism, need not make you blush. If\nwe undertake the war without preparation, we should by hastening its\ncommencement only delay its conclusion: further, a free and a famous\ncity has through all time been ours. The quality which they condemn is\nreally nothing but a wise moderation; thanks to its possession, we\nalone do not become insolent in success and give way less than others in\nmisfortune; we are not carried away by the pleasure of hearing ourselves\ncheered on to risks which our judgment condemns; nor, if annoyed, are\nwe any the more convinced by attempts to exasperate us by accusation.\nWe are both warlike and wise, and it is our sense of order that makes\nus so. We are warlike, because self-control contains honour as a\nchief constituent, and honour bravery. And we are wise, because we are\neducated with too little learning to despise the laws, and with too\nsevere a self-control to disobey them, and are brought up not to be\ntoo knowing in useless matters--such as the knowledge which can give a\nspecious criticism of an enemy's plans in theory, but fails to assail\nthem with equal success in practice--but are taught to consider that\nthe schemes of our enemies are not dissimilar to our own, and that the\nfreaks of chance are not determinable by calculation. In practice we\nalways base our preparations against an enemy on the assumption that his\nplans are good; indeed, it is right to rest our hopes not on a belief\nin his blunders, but on the soundness of our provisions. Nor ought we to\nbelieve that there is much difference between man and man, but to think\nthat the superiority lies with him who is reared in the severest school.\nThese practices, then, which our ancestors have delivered to us, and by\nwhose maintenance we have always profited, must not be given up. And\nwe must not be hurried into deciding in a day's brief space a question\nwhich concerns many lives and fortunes and many cities, and in which\nhonour is deeply involved--but we must decide calmly. This our strength\npeculiarly enables us to do. As for the Athenians, send to them on the\nmatter of Potidaea, send on the matter of the alleged wrongs of the\nallies, particularly as they are prepared with legal satisfaction; and\nto proceed against one who offers arbitration as against a wrongdoer,\nlaw forbids. Meanwhile do not omit preparation for war. This decision\nwill be the best for yourselves, the most terrible to your opponents.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Archidamus. Last came forward Sthenelaidas, one\nof the ephors for that year, and spoke to the Lacedaemonians as follows:\n\n\"The long speech of the Athenians I do not pretend to understand. They\nsaid a good deal in praise of themselves, but nowhere denied that they\nare injuring our allies and Peloponnese. And yet if they behaved well\nagainst the Mede then, but ill towards us now, they deserve double\npunishment for having ceased to be good and for having become bad. We\nmeanwhile are the same then and now, and shall not, if we are wise,\ndisregard the wrongs of our allies, or put off till to-morrow the duty\nof assisting those who must suffer to-day. Others have much money and\nships and horses, but we have good allies whom we must not give up to\nthe Athenians, nor by lawsuits and words decide the matter, as it is\nanything but in word that we are harmed, but render instant and powerful\nhelp. And let us not be told that it is fitting for us to deliberate\nunder injustice; long deliberation is rather fitting for those who have\ninjustice in contemplation. Vote therefore, Lacedaemonians, for war,\nas the honour of Sparta demands, and neither allow the further\naggrandizement of Athens, nor betray our allies to ruin, but with the\ngods let us advance against the aggressors.\"\n\nWith these words he, as ephor, himself put the question to the assembly\nof the Lacedaemonians. He said that he could not determine which was\nthe loudest acclamation (their mode of decision is by acclamation not\nby voting); the fact being that he wished to make them declare their\nopinion openly and thus to increase their ardour for war. Accordingly\nhe said: \"All Lacedaemonians who are of opinion that the treaty has\nbeen broken, and that Athens is guilty, leave your seats and go there,\"\npointing out a certain place; \"all who are of the opposite opinion,\nthere.\" They accordingly stood up and divided; and those who held that\nthe treaty had been broken were in a decided majority. Summoning the\nallies, they told them that their opinion was that Athens had been\nguilty of injustice, but that they wished to convoke all the allies and\nput it to the vote; in order that they might make war, if they decided\nto do so, on a common resolution. Having thus gained their point, the\ndelegates returned home at once; the Athenian envoys a little later,\nwhen they had dispatched the objects of their mission. This decision of\nthe assembly, judging that the treaty had been broken, was made in the\nfourteenth year of the thirty years' truce, which was entered into after\nthe affair of Euboea.\n\nThe Lacedaemonians voted that the treaty had been broken, and that the\nwar must be declared, not so much because they were persuaded by the\narguments of the allies, as because they feared the growth of the power\nof the Athenians, seeing most of Hellas already subject to them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_From the end of the Persian to the beginning of the Peloponnesian\nWar--The Progress from Supremacy to Empire_\n\nThe way in which Athens came to be placed in the circumstances under\nwhich her power grew was this. After the Medes had returned from Europe,\ndefeated by sea and land by the Hellenes, and after those of them who\nhad fled with their ships to Mycale had been destroyed, Leotychides,\nking of the Lacedaemonians, the commander of the Hellenes at Mycale,\ndeparted home with the allies from Peloponnese. But the Athenians and\nthe allies from Ionia and Hellespont, who had now revolted from the\nKing, remained and laid siege to Sestos, which was still held by the\nMedes. After wintering before it, they became masters of the place on\nits evacuation by the barbarians; and after this they sailed away from\nHellespont to their respective cities. Meanwhile the Athenian people,\nafter the departure of the barbarian from their country, at once\nproceeded to carry over their children and wives, and such property\nas they had left, from the places where they had deposited them, and\nprepared to rebuild their city and their walls. For only isolated\nportions of the circumference had been left standing, and most of\nthe houses were in ruins; though a few remained, in which the Persian\ngrandees had taken up their quarters.\n\nPerceiving what they were going to do, the Lacedaemonians sent an\nembassy to Athens. They would have themselves preferred to see neither\nher nor any other city in possession of a wall; though here they acted\nprincipally at the instigation of their allies, who were alarmed at\nthe strength of her newly acquired navy and the valour which she had\ndisplayed in the war with the Medes. They begged her not only to abstain\nfrom building walls for herself, but also to join them in throwing down\nthe walls that still held together of the ultra-Peloponnesian cities.\nThe real meaning of their advice, the suspicion that it contained\nagainst the Athenians, was not proclaimed; it was urged that so the\nbarbarian, in the event of a third invasion, would not have any strong\nplace, such as he now had in Thebes, for his base of operations; and\nthat Peloponnese would suffice for all as a base both for retreat and\noffence. After the Lacedaemonians had thus spoken, they were, on the\nadvice of Themistocles, immediately dismissed by the Athenians, with\nthe answer that ambassadors should be sent to Sparta to discuss the\nquestion. Themistocles told the Athenians to send him off with all speed\nto Lacedaemon, but not to dispatch his colleagues as soon as they had\nselected them, but to wait until they had raised their wall to the\nheight from which defence was possible. Meanwhile the whole population\nin the city was to labour at the wall, the Athenians, their wives, and\ntheir children, sparing no edifice, private or public, which might be\nof any use to the work, but throwing all down. After giving these\ninstructions, and adding that he would be responsible for all other\nmatters there, he departed. Arrived at Lacedaemon he did not seek an\naudience with the authorities, but tried to gain time and made excuses.\nWhen any of the government asked him why he did not appear in the\nassembly, he would say that he was waiting for his colleagues, who had\nbeen detained in Athens by some engagement; however, that he expected\ntheir speedy arrival, and wondered that they were not yet there. At\nfirst the Lacedaemonians trusted the words of Themistocles, through\ntheir friendship for him; but when others arrived, all distinctly\ndeclaring that the work was going on and already attaining some\nelevation, they did not know how to disbelieve it. Aware of this, he\ntold them that rumours are deceptive, and should not be trusted; they\nshould send some reputable persons from Sparta to inspect, whose report\nmight be trusted. They dispatched them accordingly. Concerning these\nThemistocles secretly sent word to the Athenians to detain them as far\nas possible without putting them under open constraint, and not to let\nthem go until they had themselves returned. For his colleagues had\nnow joined him, Abronichus, son of Lysicles, and Aristides, son of\nLysimachus, with the news that the wall was sufficiently advanced;\nand he feared that when the Lacedaemonians heard the facts, they might\nrefuse to let them go. So the Athenians detained the envoys according to\nhis message, and Themistocles had an audience with the Lacedaemonians,\nand at last openly told them that Athens was now fortified sufficiently\nto protect its inhabitants; that any embassy which the Lacedaemonians or\ntheir allies might wish to send to them should in future proceed on\nthe assumption that the people to whom they were going was able to\ndistinguish both its own and the general interests. That when the\nAthenians thought fit to abandon their city and to embark in their\nships, they ventured on that perilous step without consulting them;\nand that on the other hand, wherever they had deliberated with the\nLacedaemonians, they had proved themselves to be in judgment second to\nnone. That they now thought it fit that their city should have a wall,\nand that this would be more for the advantage of both the citizens of\nAthens and the Hellenic confederacy; for without equal military strength\nit was impossible to contribute equal or fair counsel to the common\ninterest. It followed, he observed, either that all the members of the\nconfederacy should be without walls, or that the present step should be\nconsidered a right one.\n\nThe Lacedaemonians did not betray any open signs of anger against the\nAthenians at what they heard. The embassy, it seems, was prompted not\nby a desire to obstruct, but to guide the counsels of their government:\nbesides, Spartan feeling was at that time very friendly towards Athens\non account of the patriotism which she had displayed in the struggle\nwith the Mede. Still the defeat of their wishes could not but cause\nthem secret annoyance. The envoys of each state departed home without\ncomplaint.\n\nIn this way the Athenians walled their city in a little while. To\nthis day the building shows signs of the haste of its execution; the\nfoundations are laid of stones of all kinds, and in some places not\nwrought or fitted, but placed just in the order in which they were\nbrought by the different hands; and many columns, too, from tombs, and\nsculptured stones were put in with the rest. For the bounds of the city\nwere extended at every point of the circumference; and so they laid\nhands on everything without exception in their haste. Themistocles also\npersuaded them to finish the walls of Piraeus, which had been begun\nbefore, in his year of office as archon; being influenced alike by the\nfineness of a locality that has three natural harbours, and by the great\nstart which the Athenians would gain in the acquisition of power by\nbecoming a naval people. For he first ventured to tell them to stick to\nthe sea and forthwith began to lay the foundations of the empire. It was\nby his advice, too, that they built the walls of that thickness which\ncan still be discerned round Piraeus, the stones being brought up by\ntwo wagons meeting each other. Between the walls thus formed there\nwas neither rubble nor mortar, but great stones hewn square and fitted\ntogether, cramped to each other on the outside with iron and lead. About\nhalf the height that he intended was finished. His idea was by their\nsize and thickness to keep off the attacks of an enemy; he thought that\nthey might be adequately defended by a small garrison of invalids, and\nthe rest be freed for service in the fleet. For the fleet claimed most\nof his attention. He saw, as I think, that the approach by sea was\neasier for the king's army than that by land: he also thought Piraeus\nmore valuable than the upper city; indeed, he was always advising the\nAthenians, if a day should come when they were hard pressed by land,\nto go down into Piraeus, and defy the world with their fleet. Thus,\ntherefore, the Athenians completed their wall, and commenced their other\nbuildings immediately after the retreat of the Mede.\n\nMeanwhile Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus, was sent out from Lacedaemon as\ncommander-in-chief of the Hellenes, with twenty ships from Peloponnese.\nWith him sailed the Athenians with thirty ships, and a number of the\nother allies. They made an expedition against Cyprus and subdued most of\nthe island, and afterwards against Byzantium, which was in the hands of\nthe Medes, and compelled it to surrender. This event took place while\nthe Spartans were still supreme. But the violence of Pausanias had\nalready begun to be disagreeable to the Hellenes, particularly to the\nIonians and the newly liberated populations. These resorted to the\nAthenians and requested them as their kinsmen to become their leaders,\nand to stop any attempt at violence on the part of Pausanias. The\nAthenians accepted their overtures, and determined to put down any\nattempt of the kind and to settle everything else as their interests\nmight seem to demand. In the meantime the Lacedaemonians recalled\nPausanias for an investigation of the reports which had reached them.\nManifold and grave accusations had been brought against him by Hellenes\narriving in Sparta; and, to all appearance, there had been in him more\nof the mimicry of a despot than of the attitude of a general. As it\nhappened, his recall came just at the time when the hatred which he\nhad inspired had induced the allies to desert him, the soldiers from\nPeloponnese excepted, and to range themselves by the side of the\nAthenians. On his arrival at Lacedaemon, he was censured for his\nprivate acts of oppression, but was acquitted on the heaviest counts and\npronounced not guilty; it must be known that the charge of Medism formed\none of the principal, and to all appearance one of the best founded,\narticles against him. The Lacedaemonians did not, however, restore him\nto his command, but sent out Dorkis and certain others with a small\nforce; who found the allies no longer inclined to concede to them the\nsupremacy. Perceiving this they departed, and the Lacedaemonians did\nnot send out any to succeed them. They feared for those who went out\na deterioration similar to that observable in Pausanias; besides,\nthey desired to be rid of the Median War, and were satisfied of the\ncompetency of the Athenians for the position, and of their friendship at\nthe time towards themselves.\n\nThe Athenians, having thus succeeded to the supremacy by the voluntary\nact of the allies through their hatred of Pausanias, fixed which cities\nwere to contribute money against the barbarian, which ships; their\nprofessed object being to retaliate for their sufferings by ravaging\nthe King's country. Now was the time that the office of \"Treasurers for\nHellas\" was first instituted by the Athenians. These officers received\nthe tribute, as the money contributed was called. The tribute was first\nfixed at four hundred and sixty talents. The common treasury was at\nDelos, and the congresses were held in the temple. Their supremacy\ncommenced with independent allies who acted on the resolutions of a\ncommon congress. It was marked by the following undertakings in war and\nin administration during the interval between the Median and the present\nwar, against the barbarian, against their own rebel allies, and against\nthe Peloponnesian powers which would come in contact with them on\nvarious occasions. My excuse for relating these events, and for\nventuring on this digression, is that this passage of history has been\nomitted by all my predecessors, who have confined themselves either\nto Hellenic history before the Median War, or the Median War itself.\nHellanicus, it is true, did touch on these events in his Athenian\nhistory; but he is somewhat concise and not accurate in his dates.\nBesides, the history of these events contains an explanation of the\ngrowth of the Athenian empire.\n\nFirst the Athenians besieged and captured Eion on the Strymon from the\nMedes, and made slaves of the inhabitants, being under the command of\nCimon, son of Miltiades. Next they enslaved Scyros, the island in the\nAegean, containing a Dolopian population, and colonized it themselves.\nThis was followed by a war against Carystus, in which the rest of Euboea\nremained neutral, and which was ended by surrender on conditions. After\nthis Naxos left the confederacy, and a war ensued, and she had to return\nafter a siege; this was the first instance of the engagement being\nbroken by the subjugation of an allied city, a precedent which\nwas followed by that of the rest in the order which circumstances\nprescribed. Of all the causes of defection, that connected with arrears\nof tribute and vessels, and with failure of service, was the chief;\nfor the Athenians were very severe and exacting, and made themselves\noffensive by applying the screw of necessity to men who were not used\nto and in fact not disposed for any continuous labour. In some other\nrespects the Athenians were not the old popular rulers they had been\nat first; and if they had more than their fair share of service, it\nwas correspondingly easy for them to reduce any that tried to leave the\nconfederacy. For this the allies had themselves to blame; the wish to\nget off service making most of them arrange to pay their share of the\nexpense in money instead of in ships, and so to avoid having to leave\ntheir homes. Thus while Athens was increasing her navy with the funds\nwhich they contributed, a revolt always found them without resources or\nexperience for war.\n\nNext we come to the actions by land and by sea at the river Eurymedon,\nbetween the Athenians with their allies, and the Medes, when the\nAthenians won both battles on the same day under the conduct of Cimon,\nson of Miltiades, and captured and destroyed the whole Phoenician fleet,\nconsisting of two hundred vessels. Some time afterwards occurred the\ndefection of the Thasians, caused by disagreements about the marts on\nthe opposite coast of Thrace, and about the mine in their possession.\nSailing with a fleet to Thasos, the Athenians defeated them at sea and\neffected a landing on the island. About the same time they sent ten\nthousand settlers of their own citizens and the allies to settle\nthe place then called Ennea Hodoi or Nine Ways, now Amphipolis. They\nsucceeded in gaining possession of Ennea Hodoi from the Edonians, but on\nadvancing into the interior of Thrace were cut off in Drabescus, a town\nof the Edonians, by the assembled Thracians, who regarded the settlement\nof the place Ennea Hodoi as an act of hostility. Meanwhile the Thasians\nbeing defeated in the field and suffering siege, appealed to Lacedaemon,\nand desired her to assist them by an invasion of Attica. Without\ninforming Athens, she promised and intended to do so, but was prevented\nby the occurrence of the earthquake, accompanied by the secession of the\nHelots and the Thuriats and Aethaeans of the Perioeci to Ithome. Most of\nthe Helots were the descendants of the old Messenians that were enslaved\nin the famous war; and so all of them came to be called Messenians. So\nthe Lacedaemonians being engaged in a war with the rebels in Ithome,\nthe Thasians in the third year of the siege obtained terms from\nthe Athenians by razing their walls, delivering up their ships, and\narranging to pay the moneys demanded at once, and tribute in future;\ngiving up their possessions on the continent together with the mine.\n\nThe Lacedaemonians, meanwhile, finding the war against the rebels in\nIthome likely to last, invoked the aid of their allies, and especially\nof the Athenians, who came in some force under the command of Cimon.\nThe reason for this pressing summons lay in their reputed skill in\nsiege operations; a long siege had taught the Lacedaemonians their own\ndeficiency in this art, else they would have taken the place by assault.\nThe first open quarrel between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians arose\nout of this expedition. The Lacedaemonians, when assault failed to take\nthe place, apprehensive of the enterprising and revolutionary character\nof the Athenians, and further looking upon them as of alien extraction,\nbegan to fear that, if they remained, they might be tempted by the\nbesieged in Ithome to attempt some political changes. They accordingly\ndismissed them alone of the allies, without declaring their suspicions,\nbut merely saying that they had now no need of them. But the Athenians,\naware that their dismissal did not proceed from the more honourable\nreason of the two, but from suspicions which had been conceived, went\naway deeply offended, and conscious of having done nothing to merit such\ntreatment from the Lacedaemonians; and the instant that they returned\nhome they broke off the alliance which had been made against the Mede,\nand allied themselves with Sparta's enemy Argos; each of the contracting\nparties taking the same oaths and making the same alliance with the\nThessalians.\n\nMeanwhile the rebels in Ithome, unable to prolong further a ten years'\nresistance, surrendered to Lacedaemon; the conditions being that they\nshould depart from Peloponnese under safe conduct, and should never set\nfoot in it again: any one who might hereafter be found there was to be\nthe slave of his captor. It must be known that the Lacedaemonians had\nan old oracle from Delphi, to the effect that they should let go the\nsuppliant of Zeus at Ithome. So they went forth with their children and\ntheir wives, and being received by Athens from the hatred that she now\nfelt for the Lacedaemonians, were located at Naupactus, which she had\nlately taken from the Ozolian Locrians. The Athenians received\nanother addition to their confederacy in the Megarians; who left the\nLacedaemonian alliance, annoyed by a war about boundaries forced on\nthem by Corinth. The Athenians occupied Megara and Pegae, and built the\nMegarians their long walls from the city to Nisaea, in which they placed\nan Athenian garrison. This was the principal cause of the Corinthians\nconceiving such a deadly hatred against Athens.\n\nMeanwhile Inaros, son of Psammetichus, a Libyan king of the Libyans on\nthe Egyptian border, having his headquarters at Marea, the town\nabove Pharos, caused a revolt of almost the whole of Egypt from King\nArtaxerxes and, placing himself at its head, invited the Athenians to\nhis assistance. Abandoning a Cyprian expedition upon which they happened\nto be engaged with two hundred ships of their own and their allies,\nthey arrived in Egypt and sailed from the sea into the Nile, and making\nthemselves masters of the river and two-thirds of Memphis, addressed\nthemselves to the attack of the remaining third, which is called White\nCastle. Within it were Persians and Medes who had taken refuge there,\nand Egyptians who had not joined the rebellion.\n\nMeanwhile the Athenians, making a descent from their fleet upon\nHaliae, were engaged by a force of Corinthians and Epidaurians; and\nthe Corinthians were victorious. Afterwards the Athenians engaged the\nPeloponnesian fleet off Cecruphalia; and the Athenians were victorious.\nSubsequently war broke out between Aegina and Athens, and there was a\ngreat battle at sea off Aegina between the Athenians and Aeginetans,\neach being aided by their allies; in which victory remained with the\nAthenians, who took seventy of the enemy's ships, and landed in the\ncountry and commenced a siege under the command of Leocrates, son\nof Stroebus. Upon this the Peloponnesians, desirous of aiding the\nAeginetans, threw into Aegina a force of three hundred heavy infantry,\nwho had before been serving with the Corinthians and Epidaurians.\nMeanwhile the Corinthians and their allies occupied the heights of\nGeraneia, and marched down into the Megarid, in the belief that, with a\nlarge force absent in Aegina and Egypt, Athens would be unable to help\nthe Megarians without raising the siege of Aegina. But the Athenians,\ninstead of moving the army of Aegina, raised a force of the old and\nyoung men that had been left in the city, and marched into the\nMegarid under the command of Myronides. After a drawn battle with the\nCorinthians, the rival hosts parted, each with the impression that they\nhad gained the victory. The Athenians, however, if anything, had rather\nthe advantage, and on the departure of the Corinthians set up a trophy.\nUrged by the taunts of the elders in their city, the Corinthians made\ntheir preparations, and about twelve days afterwards came and set up\ntheir trophy as victors. Sallying out from Megara, the Athenians cut\noff the party that was employed in erecting the trophy, and engaged and\ndefeated the rest. In the retreat of the vanquished army, a considerable\ndivision, pressed by the pursuers and mistaking the road, dashed into a\nfield on some private property, with a deep trench all round it, and\nno way out. Being acquainted with the place, the Athenians hemmed their\nfront with heavy infantry and, placing the light troops round in a\ncircle, stoned all who had gone in. Corinth here suffered a severe blow.\nThe bulk of her army continued its retreat home.\n\nAbout this time the Athenians began to build the long walls to the sea,\nthat towards Phalerum and that towards Piraeus. Meanwhile the Phocians\nmade an expedition against Doris, the old home of the Lacedaemonians,\ncontaining the towns of Boeum, Kitinium, and Erineum. They had taken\none of these towns, when the Lacedaemonians under Nicomedes, son of\nCleombrotus, commanding for King Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, who was\nstill a minor, came to the aid of the Dorians with fifteen hundred\nheavy infantry of their own, and ten thousand of their allies. After\ncompelling the Phocians to restore the town on conditions, they began\ntheir retreat. The route by sea, across the Crissaean Gulf, exposed them\nto the risk of being stopped by the Athenian fleet; that across Geraneia\nseemed scarcely safe, the Athenians holding Megara and Pegae. For the\npass was a difficult one, and was always guarded by the Athenians; and,\nin the present instance, the Lacedaemonians had information that they\nmeant to dispute their passage. So they resolved to remain in Boeotia,\nand to consider which would be the safest line of march. They had also\nanother reason for this resolve. Secret encouragement had been given\nthem by a party in Athens, who hoped to put an end to the reign of\ndemocracy and the building of the Long Walls. Meanwhile the Athenians\nmarched against them with their whole levy and a thousand Argives and\nthe respective contingents of the rest of their allies. Altogether they\nwere fourteen thousand strong. The march was prompted by the notion that\nthe Lacedaemonians were at a loss how to effect their passage, and also\nby suspicions of an attempt to overthrow the democracy. Some cavalry\nalso joined the Athenians from their Thessalian allies; but these went\nover to the Lacedaemonians during the battle.\n\nThe battle was fought at Tanagra in Boeotia. After heavy loss on both\nsides, victory declared for the Lacedaemonians and their allies.\nAfter entering the Megarid and cutting down the fruit trees, the\nLacedaemonians returned home across Geraneia and the isthmus. Sixty-two\ndays after the battle the Athenians marched into Boeotia under the\ncommand of Myronides, defeated the Boeotians in battle at Oenophyta, and\nbecame masters of Boeotia and Phocis. They dismantled the walls of the\nTanagraeans, took a hundred of the richest men of the Opuntian Locrians\nas hostages, and finished their own long walls. This was followed by the\nsurrender of the Aeginetans to Athens on conditions; they pulled down\ntheir walls, gave up their ships, and agreed to pay tribute in future.\nThe Athenians sailed round Peloponnese under Tolmides, son of\nTolmaeus, burnt the arsenal of Lacedaemon, took Chalcis, a town of the\nCorinthians, and in a descent upon Sicyon defeated the Sicyonians in\nbattle.\n\nMeanwhile the Athenians in Egypt and their allies were still there,\nand encountered all the vicissitudes of war. First the Athenians were\nmasters of Egypt, and the King sent Megabazus a Persian to Lacedaemon\nwith money to bribe the Peloponnesians to invade Attica and so draw off\nthe Athenians from Egypt. Finding that the matter made no progress, and\nthat the money was only being wasted, he recalled Megabazus with the\nremainder of the money, and sent Megabuzus, son of Zopyrus, a Persian,\nwith a large army to Egypt. Arriving by land he defeated the Egyptians\nand their allies in a battle, and drove the Hellenes out of Memphis, and\nat length shut them up in the island of Prosopitis, where he besieged\nthem for a year and six months. At last, draining the canal of its\nwaters, which he diverted into another channel, he left their ships high\nand dry and joined most of the island to the mainland, and then marched\nover on foot and captured it. Thus the enterprise of the Hellenes came\nto ruin after six years of war. Of all that large host a few travelling\nthrough Libya reached Cyrene in safety, but most of them perished. And\nthus Egypt returned to its subjection to the King, except Amyrtaeus, the\nking in the marshes, whom they were unable to capture from the extent\nof the marsh; the marshmen being also the most warlike of the Egyptians.\nInaros, the Libyan king, the sole author of the Egyptian revolt, was\nbetrayed, taken, and crucified. Meanwhile a relieving squadron of fifty\nvessels had sailed from Athens and the rest of the confederacy for\nEgypt. They put in to shore at the Mendesian mouth of the Nile, in total\nignorance of what had occurred. Attacked on the land side by the\ntroops, and from the sea by the Phoenician navy, most of the ships were\ndestroyed; the few remaining being saved by retreat. Such was the end of\nthe great expedition of the Athenians and their allies to Egypt.\n\nMeanwhile Orestes, son of Echecratidas, the Thessalian king, being an\nexile from Thessaly, persuaded the Athenians to restore him. Taking with\nthem the Boeotians and Phocians their allies, the Athenians marched to\nPharsalus in Thessaly. They became masters of the country, though only\nin the immediate vicinity of the camp; beyond which they could not go\nfor fear of the Thessalian cavalry. But they failed to take the city\nor to attain any of the other objects of their expedition, and returned\nhome with Orestes without having effected anything. Not long after this\na thousand of the Athenians embarked in the vessels that were at Pegae\n(Pegae, it must be remembered, was now theirs), and sailed along the\ncoast to Sicyon under the command of Pericles, son of Xanthippus.\nLanding in Sicyon and defeating the Sicyonians who engaged them, they\nimmediately took with them the Achaeans and, sailing across, marched\nagainst and laid siege to Oeniadae in Acarnania. Failing however to take\nit, they returned home.\n\nThree years afterwards a truce was made between the Peloponnesians and\nAthenians for five years. Released from Hellenic war, the Athenians made\nan expedition to Cyprus with two hundred vessels of their own and their\nallies, under the command of Cimon. Sixty of these were detached to\nEgypt at the instance of Amyrtaeus, the king in the marshes; the rest\nlaid siege to Kitium, from which, however, they were compelled to retire\nby the death of Cimon and by scarcity of provisions. Sailing off Salamis\nin Cyprus, they fought with the Phoenicians, Cyprians, and Cilicians by\nland and sea, and, being victorious on both elements departed home,\nand with them the returned squadron from Egypt. After this the\nLacedaemonians marched out on a sacred war, and, becoming masters of the\ntemple at Delphi, it in the hands of the Delphians. Immediately after\ntheir retreat, the Athenians marched out, became masters of the temple,\nand placed it in the hands of the Phocians.\n\nSome time after this, Orchomenus, Chaeronea, and some other places in\nBoeotia being in the hands of the Boeotian exiles, the Athenians marched\nagainst the above-mentioned hostile places with a thousand Athenian\nheavy infantry and the allied contingents, under the command of\nTolmides, son of Tolmaeus. They took Chaeronea, and made slaves of the\ninhabitants, and, leaving a garrison, commenced their return. On\ntheir road they were attacked at Coronea by the Boeotian exiles from\nOrchomenus, with some Locrians and Euboean exiles, and others who were\nof the same way of thinking, were defeated in battle, and some killed,\nothers taken captive. The Athenians evacuated all Boeotia by a treaty\nproviding for the recovery of the men; and the exiled Boeotians\nreturned, and with all the rest regained their independence.\n\nThis was soon afterwards followed by the revolt of Euboea from Athens.\nPericles had already crossed over with an army of Athenians to the\nisland, when news was brought to him that Megara had revolted, that\nthe Peloponnesians were on the point of invading Attica, and that the\nAthenian garrison had been cut off by the Megarians, with the exception\nof a few who had taken refuge in Nisaea. The Megarians had introduced\nthe Corinthians, Sicyonians, and Epidaurians into the town before they\nrevolted. Meanwhile Pericles brought his army back in all haste from\nEuboea. After this the Peloponnesians marched into Attica as far as\nEleusis and Thrius, ravaging the country under the conduct of King\nPleistoanax, the son of Pausanias, and without advancing further\nreturned home. The Athenians then crossed over again to Euboea under\nthe command of Pericles, and subdued the whole of the island: all but\nHistiaea was settled by convention; the Histiaeans they expelled from\ntheir homes, and occupied their territory themselves.\n\nNot long after their return from Euboea, they made a truce with the\nLacedaemonians and their allies for thirty years, giving up the posts\nwhich they occupied in Peloponnese--Nisaea, Pegae, Troezen, and Achaia.\nIn the sixth year of the truce, war broke out between the Samians and\nMilesians about Priene. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens\nwith loud complaints against the Samians. In this they were joined by\ncertain private persons from Samos itself, who wished to revolutionize\nthe government. Accordingly the Athenians sailed to Samos with forty\nships and set up a democracy; took hostages from the Samians, fifty boys\nand as many men, lodged them in Lemnos, and after leaving a garrison in\nthe island returned home. But some of the Samians had not remained in\nthe island, but had fled to the continent. Making an agreement with the\nmost powerful of those in the city, and an alliance with Pissuthnes, son\nof Hystaspes, the then satrap of Sardis, they got together a force of\nseven hundred mercenaries, and under cover of night crossed over to\nSamos. Their first step was to rise on the commons, most of whom they\nsecured; their next to steal their hostages from Lemnos; after which\nthey revolted, gave up the Athenian garrison left with them and its\ncommanders to Pissuthnes, and instantly prepared for an expedition\nagainst Miletus. The Byzantines also revolted with them.\n\nAs soon as the Athenians heard the news, they sailed with sixty ships\nagainst Samos. Sixteen of these went to Caria to look out for the\nPhoenician fleet, and to Chios and Lesbos carrying round orders for\nreinforcements, and so never engaged; but forty-four ships under the\ncommand of Pericles with nine colleagues gave battle, off the island of\nTragia, to seventy Samian vessels, of which twenty were transports, as\nthey were sailing from Miletus. Victory remained with the Athenians.\nReinforced afterwards by forty ships from Athens, and twenty-five Chian\nand Lesbian vessels, the Athenians landed, and having the superiority by\nland invested the city with three walls; it was also invested from the\nsea. Meanwhile Pericles took sixty ships from the blockading squadron,\nand departed in haste for Caunus and Caria, intelligence having been\nbrought in of the approach of the Phoenician fleet to the aid of the\nSamians; indeed Stesagoras and others had left the island with five\nships to bring them. But in the meantime the Samians made a sudden\nsally, and fell on the camp, which they found unfortified. Destroying\nthe look-out vessels, and engaging and defeating such as were being\nlaunched to meet them, they remained masters of their own seas for\nfourteen days, and carried in and carried out what they pleased. But\non the arrival of Pericles, they were once more shut up. Fresh\nreinforcements afterwards arrived--forty ships from Athens with\nThucydides, Hagnon, and Phormio; twenty with Tlepolemus and Anticles,\nand thirty vessels from Chios and Lesbos. After a brief attempt at\nfighting, the Samians, unable to hold out, were reduced after a nine\nmonths' siege and surrendered on conditions; they razed their walls,\ngave hostages, delivered up their ships, and arranged to pay the\nexpenses of the war by instalments. The Byzantines also agreed to be\nsubject as before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_Second Congress at Lacedaemon--Preparations for War and Diplomatic\nSkirmishes--Cylon--Pausanias--Themistocles_\n\nAfter this, though not many years later, we at length come to what\nhas been already related, the affairs of Corcyra and Potidaea, and the\nevents that served as a pretext for the present war. All these actions\nof the Hellenes against each other and the barbarian occurred in the\nfifty years' interval between the retreat of Xerxes and the beginning of\nthe present war. During this interval the Athenians succeeded in placing\ntheir empire on a firmer basis, and advanced their own home power to a\nvery great height. The Lacedaemonians, though fully aware of it, opposed\nit only for a little while, but remained inactive during most of the\nperiod, being of old slow to go to war except under the pressure of\nnecessity, and in the present instance being hampered by wars at home;\nuntil the growth of the Athenian power could be no longer ignored, and\ntheir own confederacy became the object of its encroachments. They then\nfelt that they could endure it no longer, but that the time had come\nfor them to throw themselves heart and soul upon the hostile power, and\nbreak it, if they could, by commencing the present war. And though the\nLacedaemonians had made up their own minds on the fact of the breach of\nthe treaty and the guilt of the Athenians, yet they sent to Delphi and\ninquired of the God whether it would be well with them if they went to\nwar; and, as it is reported, received from him the answer that if they\nput their whole strength into the war, victory would be theirs, and\nthe promise that he himself would be with them, whether invoked or\nuninvoked. Still they wished to summon their allies again, and to take\ntheir vote on the propriety of making war. After the ambassadors from\nthe confederates had arrived and a congress had been convened, they all\nspoke their minds, most of them denouncing the Athenians and demanding\nthat the war should begin. In particular the Corinthians. They had\nbefore on their own account canvassed the cities in detail to induce\nthem to vote for the war, in the fear that it might come too late to\nsave Potidaea; they were present also on this occasion, and came forward\nthe last, and made the following speech:\n\n\"Fellow allies, we can no longer accuse the Lacedaemonians of having\nfailed in their duty: they have not only voted for war themselves,\nbut have assembled us here for that purpose. We say their duty, for\nsupremacy has its duties. Besides equitably administering private\ninterests, leaders are required to show a special care for the common\nwelfare in return for the special honours accorded to them by all in\nother ways. For ourselves, all who have already had dealings with the\nAthenians require no warning to be on their guard against them. The\nstates more inland and out of the highway of communication should\nunderstand that, if they omit to support the coast powers, the result\nwill be to injure the transit of their produce for exportation and the\nreception in exchange of their imports from the sea; and they must not\nbe careless judges of what is now said, as if it had nothing to do with\nthem, but must expect that the sacrifice of the powers on the coast will\none day be followed by the extension of the danger to the interior,\nand must recognize that their own interests are deeply involved in this\ndiscussion. For these reasons they should not hesitate to exchange peace\nfor war. If wise men remain quiet, while they are not injured, brave\nmen abandon peace for war when they are injured, returning to an\nunderstanding on a favourable opportunity: in fact, they are neither\nintoxicated by their success in war, nor disposed to take an injury for\nthe sake of the delightful tranquillity of peace. Indeed, to falter for\nthe sake of such delights is, if you remain inactive, the quickest way\nof losing the sweets of repose to which you cling; while to conceive\nextravagant pretensions from success in war is to forget how hollow is\nthe confidence by which you are elated. For if many ill-conceived plans\nhave succeeded through the still greater fatuity of an opponent, many\nmore, apparently well laid, have on the contrary ended in disgrace. The\nconfidence with which we form our schemes is never completely justified\nin their execution; speculation is carried on in safety, but, when it\ncomes to action, fear causes failure.\n\n\"To apply these rules to ourselves, if we are now kindling war it is\nunder the pressure of injury, with adequate grounds of complaint; and\nafter we have chastised the Athenians we will in season desist. We have\nmany reasons to expect success--first, superiority in numbers and in\nmilitary experience, and secondly our general and unvarying obedience in\nthe execution of orders. The naval strength which they possess shall\nbe raised by us from our respective antecedent resources, and from the\nmoneys at Olympia and Delphi. A loan from these enables us to seduce\ntheir foreign sailors by the offer of higher pay. For the power of\nAthens is more mercenary than national; while ours will not be exposed\nto the same risk, as its strength lies more in men than in money. A\nsingle defeat at sea is in all likelihood their ruin: should they\nhold out, in that case there will be the more time for us to exercise\nourselves in naval matters; and as soon as we have arrived at an\nequality in science, we need scarcely ask whether we shall be their\nsuperiors in courage. For the advantages that we have by nature they\ncannot acquire by education; while their superiority in science must be\nremoved by our practice. The money required for these objects shall be\nprovided by our contributions: nothing indeed could be more monstrous\nthan the suggestion that, while their allies never tire of contributing\nfor their own servitude, we should refuse to spend for vengeance and\nself-preservation the treasure which by such refusal we shall forfeit to\nAthenian rapacity and see employed for our own ruin.\n\n\"We have also other ways of carrying on the war, such as revolt of their\nallies, the surest method of depriving them of their revenues, which are\nthe source of their strength, and establishment of fortified positions\nin their country, and various operations which cannot be foreseen at\npresent. For war of all things proceeds least upon definite rules, but\ndraws principally upon itself for contrivances to meet an emergency; and\nin such cases the party who faces the struggle and keeps his temper\nbest meets with most security, and he who loses his temper about it\nwith correspondent disaster. Let us also reflect that if it was merely\na number of disputes of territory between rival neighbours, it might be\nborne; but here we have an enemy in Athens that is a match for our whole\ncoalition, and more than a match for any of its members; so that unless\nas a body and as individual nationalities and individual cities we make\nan unanimous stand against her, she will easily conquer us divided and\nin detail. That conquest, terrible as it may sound, would, it must be\nknown, have no other end than slavery pure and simple; a word which\nPeloponnese cannot even hear whispered without disgrace, or without\ndisgrace see so many states abused by one. Meanwhile the opinion would\nbe either that we were justly so used, or that we put up with it from\ncowardice, and were proving degenerate sons in not even securing for\nourselves the freedom which our fathers gave to Hellas; and in allowing\nthe establishment in Hellas of a tyrant state, though in individual\nstates we think it our duty to put down sole rulers. And we do not know\nhow this conduct can be held free from three of the gravest failings,\nwant of sense, of courage, or of vigilance. For we do not suppose that\nyou have taken refuge in that contempt of an enemy which has proved so\nfatal in so many instances--a feeling which from the numbers that it has\nruined has come to be called not contemptuous but contemptible.\n\n\"There is, however, no advantage in reflections on the past further\nthan may be of service to the present. For the future we must provide by\nmaintaining what the present gives us and redoubling our efforts; it is\nhereditary to us to win virtue as the fruit of labour, and you must\nnot change the habit, even though you should have a slight advantage\nin wealth and resources; for it is not right that what was won in want\nshould be lost in plenty; no, we must boldly advance to the war for many\nreasons; the god has commanded it and promised to be with us, and the\nrest of Hellas will all join in the struggle, part from fear, part from\ninterest. You will be the first to break a treaty which the god, in\nadvising us to go to war, judges to be violated already, but rather to\nsupport a treaty that has been outraged: indeed, treaties are broken not\nby resistance but by aggression.\n\n\"Your position, therefore, from whatever quarter you may view it, will\namply justify you in going to war; and this step we recommend in the\ninterests of all, bearing in mind that identity of interest is the\nsurest of bonds, whether between states or individuals. Delay not,\ntherefore, to assist Potidaea, a Dorian city besieged by Ionians, which\nis quite a reversal of the order of things; nor to assert the freedom\nof the rest. It is impossible for us to wait any longer when waiting\ncan only mean immediate disaster for some of us, and, if it comes to be\nknown that we have conferred but do not venture to protect ourselves,\nlike disaster in the near future for the rest. Delay not, fellow allies,\nbut, convinced of the necessity of the crisis and the wisdom of this\ncounsel, vote for the war, undeterred by its immediate terrors, but\nlooking beyond to the lasting peace by which it will be succeeded. Out\nof war peace gains fresh stability, but to refuse to abandon repose for\nwar is not so sure a method of avoiding danger. We must believe that\nthe tyrant city that has been established in Hellas has been established\nagainst all alike, with a programme of universal empire, part fulfilled,\npart in contemplation; let us then attack and reduce it, and win\nfuture security for ourselves and freedom for the Hellenes who are now\nenslaved.\"\n\nSuch were the words of the Corinthians. The Lacedaemonians, having now\nheard all, give their opinion, took the vote of all the allied states\npresent in order, great and small alike; and the majority voted for war.\nThis decided, it was still impossible for them to commence at once, from\ntheir want of preparation; but it was resolved that the means requisite\nwere to be procured by the different states, and that there was to be\nno delay. And indeed, in spite of the time occupied with the necessary\narrangements, less than a year elapsed before Attica was invaded, and\nthe war openly begun.\n\nThis interval was spent in sending embassies to Athens charged with\ncomplaints, in order to obtain as good a pretext for war as possible,\nin the event of her paying no attention to them. The first Lacedaemonian\nembassy was to order the Athenians to drive out the curse of the\ngoddess; the history of which is as follows. In former generations there\nwas an Athenian of the name of Cylon, a victor at the Olympic games,\nof good birth and powerful position, who had married a daughter of\nTheagenes, a Megarian, at that time tyrant of Megara. Now this Cylon was\ninquiring at Delphi; when he was told by the god to seize the Acropolis\nof Athens on the grand festival of Zeus. Accordingly, procuring a force\nfrom Theagenes and persuading his friends to join him, when the\nOlympic festival in Peloponnese came, he seized the Acropolis, with the\nintention of making himself tyrant, thinking that this was the grand\nfestival of Zeus, and also an occasion appropriate for a victor at the\nOlympic games. Whether the grand festival that was meant was in Attica\nor elsewhere was a question which he never thought of, and which the\noracle did not offer to solve. For the Athenians also have a festival\nwhich is called the grand festival of Zeus Meilichios or Gracious, viz.,\nthe Diasia. It is celebrated outside the city, and the whole people\nsacrifice not real victims but a number of bloodless offerings peculiar\nto the country. However, fancying he had chosen the right time, he made\nthe attempt. As soon as the Athenians perceived it, they flocked in, one\nand all, from the country, and sat down, and laid siege to the citadel.\nBut as time went on, weary of the labour of blockade, most of them\ndeparted; the responsibility of keeping guard being left to the nine\narchons, with plenary powers to arrange everything according to their\ngood judgment. It must be known that at that time most political\nfunctions were discharged by the nine archons. Meanwhile Cylon and\nhis besieged companions were distressed for want of food and water.\nAccordingly Cylon and his brother made their escape; but the rest\nbeing hard pressed, and some even dying of famine, seated themselves as\nsuppliants at the altar in the Acropolis. The Athenians who were charged\nwith the duty of keeping guard, when they saw them at the point of death\nin the temple, raised them up on the understanding that no harm should\nbe done to them, led them out, and slew them. Some who as they passed by\ntook refuge at the altars of the awful goddesses were dispatched on the\nspot. From this deed the men who killed them were called accursed and\nguilty against the goddess, they and their descendants. Accordingly\nthese cursed ones were driven out by the Athenians, driven out again by\nCleomenes of Lacedaemon and an Athenian faction; the living were driven\nout, and the bones of the dead were taken up; thus they were cast out.\nFor all that, they came back afterwards, and their descendants are still\nin the city.\n\nThis, then was the curse that the Lacedaemonians ordered them to drive\nout. They were actuated primarily, as they pretended, by a care for the\nhonour of the gods; but they also know that Pericles, son of Xanthippus,\nwas connected with the curse on his mother's side, and they thought that\nhis banishment would materially advance their designs on Athens. Not\nthat they really hoped to succeed in procuring this; they rather thought\nto create a prejudice against him in the eyes of his countrymen from the\nfeeling that the war would be partly caused by his misfortune. For being\nthe most powerful man of his time, and the leading Athenian statesman,\nhe opposed the Lacedaemonians in everything, and would have no\nconcessions, but ever urged the Athenians on to war.\n\nThe Athenians retorted by ordering the Lacedaemonians to drive out the\ncurse of Taenarus. The Lacedaemonians had once raised up some Helot\nsuppliants from the temple of Poseidon at Taenarus, led them away and\nslain them; for which they believe the great earthquake at Sparta to\nhave been a retribution. The Athenians also ordered them to drive out\nthe curse of the goddess of the Brazen House; the history of which is\nas follows. After Pausanias the Lacedaemonian had been recalled by the\nSpartans from his command in the Hellespont (this is his first recall),\nand had been tried by them and acquitted, not being again sent out in a\npublic capacity, he took a galley of Hermione on his own responsibility,\nwithout the authority of the Lacedaemonians, and arrived as a private\nperson in the Hellespont. He came ostensibly for the Hellenic war,\nreally to carry on his intrigues with the King, which he had begun\nbefore his recall, being ambitious of reigning over Hellas. The\ncircumstance which first enabled him to lay the King under an\nobligation, and to make a beginning of the whole design, was this. Some\nconnections and kinsmen of the King had been taken in Byzantium, on its\ncapture from the Medes, when he was first there, after the return from\nCyprus. These captives he sent off to the King without the knowledge\nof the rest of the allies, the account being that they had escaped from\nhim. He managed this with the help of Gongylus, an Eretrian, whom he had\nplaced in charge of Byzantium and the prisoners. He also gave Gongylus\na letter for the King, the contents of which were as follows, as was\nafterwards discovered: \"Pausanias, the general of Sparta, anxious to do\nyou a favour, sends you these his prisoners of war. I propose also, with\nyour approval, to marry your daughter, and to make Sparta and the rest\nof Hellas subject to you. I may say that I think I am able to do this,\nwith your co-operation. Accordingly if any of this please you, send\na safe man to the sea through whom we may in future conduct our\ncorrespondence.\"\n\nThis was all that was revealed in the writing, and Xerxes was pleased\nwith the letter. He sent off Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, to the sea\nwith orders to supersede Megabates, the previous governor in the satrapy\nof Daskylion, and to send over as quickly as possible to Pausanias at\nByzantium a letter which he entrusted to him; to show him the royal\nsignet, and to execute any commission which he might receive from\nPausanias on the King's matters with all care and fidelity. Artabazus\non his arrival carried the King's orders into effect, and sent over the\nletter, which contained the following answer: \"Thus saith King Xerxes\nto Pausanias. For the men whom you have saved for me across sea from\nByzantium, an obligation is laid up for you in our house, recorded for\never; and with your proposals I am well pleased. Let neither night nor\nday stop you from diligently performing any of your promises to me;\nneither for cost of gold nor of silver let them be hindered, nor yet for\nnumber of troops, wherever it may be that their presence is needed; but\nwith Artabazus, an honourable man whom I send you, boldly advance my\nobjects and yours, as may be most for the honour and interest of us\nboth.\"\n\nBefore held in high honour by the Hellenes as the hero of Plataea,\nPausanias, after the receipt of this letter, became prouder than ever,\nand could no longer live in the usual style, but went out of Byzantium\nin a Median dress, was attended on his march through Thrace by a\nbodyguard of Medes and Egyptians, kept a Persian table, and was quite\nunable to contain his intentions, but betrayed by his conduct in trifles\nwhat his ambition looked one day to enact on a grander scale. He also\nmade himself difficult of access, and displayed so violent a temper to\nevery one without exception that no one could come near him. Indeed,\nthis was the principal reason why the confederacy went over to the\nAthenians.\n\nThe above-mentioned conduct, coming to the ears of the Lacedaemonians,\noccasioned his first recall. And after his second voyage out in the ship\nof Hermione, without their orders, he gave proofs of similar behaviour.\nBesieged and expelled from Byzantium by the Athenians, he did not return\nto Sparta; but news came that he had settled at Colonae in the Troad,\nand was intriguing with the barbarians, and that his stay there was for\nno good purpose; and the ephors, now no longer hesitating, sent him a\nherald and a scytale with orders to accompany the herald or be declared\na public enemy. Anxious above everything to avoid suspicion, and\nconfident that he could quash the charge by means of money, he returned\na second time to Sparta. At first thrown into prison by the ephors\n(whose powers enable them to do this to the King), soon compromised\nthe matter and came out again, and offered himself for trial to any who\nwished to institute an inquiry concerning him.\n\nNow the Spartans had no tangible proof against him--neither his enemies\nnor the nation--of that indubitable kind required for the punishment\nof a member of the royal family, and at that moment in high office; he\nbeing regent for his first cousin King Pleistarchus, Leonidas's son, who\nwas still a minor. But by his contempt of the laws and imitation of the\nbarbarians, he gave grounds for much suspicion of his being discontented\nwith things established; all the occasions on which he had in any way\ndeparted from the regular customs were passed in review, and it was\nremembered that he had taken upon himself to have inscribed on\nthe tripod at Delphi, which was dedicated by the Hellenes as the\nfirst-fruits of the spoil of the Medes, the following couplet:\n\n   The Mede defeated, great Pausanias raised\n   This monument, that Phoebus might be praised.\n\nAt the time the Lacedaemonians had at once erased the couplet, and\ninscribed the names of the cities that had aided in the overthrow of\nthe barbarian and dedicated the offering. Yet it was considered that\nPausanias had here been guilty of a grave offence, which, interpreted\nby the light of the attitude which he had since assumed, gained a\nnew significance, and seemed to be quite in keeping with his present\nschemes. Besides, they were informed that he was even intriguing with\nthe Helots; and such indeed was the fact, for he promised them freedom\nand citizenship if they would join him in insurrection and would\nhelp him to carry out his plans to the end. Even now, mistrusting the\nevidence even of the Helots themselves, the ephors would not consent\nto take any decided step against him; in accordance with their regular\ncustom towards themselves, namely, to be slow in taking any irrevocable\nresolve in the matter of a Spartan citizen without indisputable proof.\nAt last, it is said, the person who was going to carry to Artabazus the\nlast letter for the King, a man of Argilus, once the favourite and most\ntrusty servant of Pausanias, turned informer. Alarmed by the reflection\nthat none of the previous messengers had ever returned, having\ncounterfeited the seal, in order that, if he found himself mistaken in\nhis surmises, or if Pausanias should ask to make some correction, he\nmight not be discovered, he undid the letter, and found the postscript\nthat he had suspected, viz. an order to put him to death.\n\nOn being shown the letter, the ephors now felt more certain. Still, they\nwished to hear Pausanias commit himself with their own ears. Accordingly\nthe man went by appointment to Taenarus as a suppliant, and there built\nhimself a hut divided into two by a partition; within which he concealed\nsome of the ephors and let them hear the whole matter plainly. For\nPausanias came to him and asked him the reason of his suppliant\nposition; and the man reproached him with the order that he had\nwritten concerning him, and one by one declared all the rest of the\ncircumstances, how he who had never yet brought him into any danger,\nwhile employed as agent between him and the King, was yet just like the\nmass of his servants to be rewarded with death. Admitting all this, and\ntelling him not to be angry about the matter, Pausanias gave him the\npledge of raising him up from the temple, and begged him to set off as\nquickly as possible, and not to hinder the business in hand.\n\nThe ephors listened carefully, and then departed, taking no action for\nthe moment, but, having at last attained to certainty, were preparing\nto arrest him in the city. It is reported that, as he was about to be\narrested in the street, he saw from the face of one of the ephors what\nhe was coming for; another, too, made him a secret signal, and betrayed\nit to him from kindness. Setting off with a run for the temple of the\ngoddess of the Brazen House, the enclosure of which was near at hand, he\nsucceeded in taking sanctuary before they took him, and entering into a\nsmall chamber, which formed part of the temple, to avoid being exposed\nto the weather, lay still there. The ephors, for the moment distanced\nin the pursuit, afterwards took off the roof of the chamber, and having\nmade sure that he was inside, shut him in, barricaded the doors, and\nstaying before the place, reduced him by starvation. When they found\nthat he was on the point of expiring, just as he was, in the chamber,\nthey brought him out of the temple, while the breath was still in him,\nand as soon as he was brought out he died. They were going to throw\nhim into the Kaiadas, where they cast criminals, but finally decided to\ninter him somewhere near. But the god at Delphi afterwards ordered the\nLacedaemonians to remove the tomb to the place of his death--where he\nnow lies in the consecrated ground, as an inscription on a monument\ndeclares--and, as what had been done was a curse to them, to give back\ntwo bodies instead of one to the goddess of the Brazen House. So they\nhad two brazen statues made, and dedicated them as a substitute for\nPausanias. The Athenians retorted by telling the Lacedaemonians to drive\nout what the god himself had pronounced to be a curse.\n\nTo return to the Medism of Pausanias. Matter was found in the course\nof the inquiry to implicate Themistocles; and the Lacedaemonians\naccordingly sent envoys to the Athenians and required them to punish him\nas they had punished Pausanias. The Athenians consented to do so. But\nhe had, as it happened, been ostracized, and, with a residence at Argos,\nwas in the habit of visiting other parts of Peloponnese. So they sent\nwith the Lacedaemonians, who were ready to join in the pursuit, persons\nwith instructions to take him wherever they found him. But Themistocles\ngot scent of their intentions, and fled from Peloponnese to Corcyra,\nwhich was under obligations towards him. But the Corcyraeans alleged\nthat they could not venture to shelter him at the cost of offending\nAthens and Lacedaemon, and they conveyed him over to the continent\nopposite. Pursued by the officers who hung on the report of his\nmovements, at a loss where to turn, he was compelled to stop at the\nhouse of Admetus, the Molossian king, though they were not on friendly\nterms. Admetus happened not to be indoors, but his wife, to whom he made\nhimself a suppliant, instructed him to take their child in his arms\nand sit down by the hearth. Soon afterwards Admetus came in, and\nThemistocles told him who he was, and begged him not to revenge on\nThemistocles in exile any opposition which his requests might have\nexperienced from Themistocles at Athens. Indeed, he was now far too\nlow for his revenge; retaliation was only honourable between equals.\nBesides, his opposition to the king had only affected the success of a\nrequest, not the safety of his person; if the king were to give him up\nto the pursuers that he mentioned, and the fate which they intended for\nhim, he would just be consigning him to certain death.\n\nThe King listened to him and raised him up with his son, as he was\nsitting with him in his arms after the most effectual method of\nsupplication, and on the arrival of the Lacedaemonians not long\nafterwards, refused to give him up for anything they could say, but sent\nhim off by land to the other sea to Pydna in Alexander's dominions, as\nhe wished to go to the Persian king. There he met with a merchantman\non the point of starting for Ionia. Going on board, he was carried by\na storm to the Athenian squadron which was blockading Naxos. In his\nalarm--he was luckily unknown to the people in the vessel--he told\nthe master who he was and what he was flying for, and said that, if\nhe refused to save him, he would declare that he was taking him for a\nbribe. Meanwhile their safety consisted in letting no one leave the ship\nuntil a favourable time for sailing should arise. If he complied with\nhis wishes, he promised him a proper recompense. The master acted as he\ndesired, and, after lying to for a day and a night out of reach of the\nsquadron, at length arrived at Ephesus.\n\nAfter having rewarded him with a present of money, as soon as he\nreceived some from his friends at Athens and from his secret hoards at\nArgos, Themistocles started inland with one of the coast Persians, and\nsent a letter to King Artaxerxes, Xerxes's son, who had just come to the\nthrone. Its contents were as follows: \"I, Themistocles, am come to\nyou, who did your house more harm than any of the Hellenes, when I\nwas compelled to defend myself against your father's invasion--harm,\nhowever, far surpassed by the good that I did him during his retreat,\nwhich brought no danger for me but much for him. For the past, you are a\ngood turn in my debt\"--here he mentioned the warning sent to Xerxes from\nSalamis to retreat, as well as his finding the bridges unbroken, which,\nas he falsely pretended, was due to him--\"for the present, able to do\nyou great service, I am here, pursued by the Hellenes for my friendship\nfor you. However, I desire a year's grace, when I shall be able to\ndeclare in person the objects of my coming.\"\n\nIt is said that the King approved his intention, and told him to do as\nhe said. He employed the interval in making what progress he could in\nthe study of the Persian tongue, and of the customs of the country.\nArrived at court at the end of the year, he attained to very high\nconsideration there, such as no Hellene has ever possessed before or\nsince; partly from his splendid antecedents, partly from the hopes\nwhich he held out of effecting for him the subjugation of Hellas, but\nprincipally by the proof which experience daily gave of his capacity.\nFor Themistocles was a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs\nof genius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration\nquite extraordinary and unparalleled. By his own native capacity, alike\nunformed and unsupplemented by study, he was at once the best judge in\nthose sudden crises which admit of little or of no deliberation, and the\nbest prophet of the future, even to its most distant possibilities. An\nable theoretical expositor of all that came within the sphere of his\npractice, he was not without the power of passing an adequate judgment\nin matters in which he had no experience. He could also excellently\ndivine the good and evil which lay hid in the unseen future. In fine,\nwhether we consider the extent of his natural powers, or the slightness\nof his application, this extraordinary man must be allowed to have\nsurpassed all others in the faculty of intuitively meeting an emergency.\nDisease was the real cause of his death; though there is a story of his\nhaving ended his life by poison, on finding himself unable to fulfil his\npromises to the king. However this may be, there is a monument to him\nin the marketplace of Asiatic Magnesia. He was governor of the district,\nthe King having given him Magnesia, which brought in fifty talents a\nyear, for bread, Lampsacus, which was considered to be the richest wine\ncountry, for wine, and Myos for other provisions. His bones, it is said,\nwere conveyed home by his relatives in accordance with his wishes, and\ninterred in Attic ground. This was done without the knowledge of the\nAthenians; as it is against the law to bury in Attica an outlaw\nfor treason. So ends the history of Pausanias and Themistocles, the\nLacedaemonian and the Athenian, the most famous men of their time in\nHellas.\n\nTo return to the Lacedaemonians. The history of their first embassy,\nthe injunctions which it conveyed, and the rejoinder which it provoked,\nconcerning the expulsion of the accursed persons, have been related\nalready. It was followed by a second, which ordered Athens to raise the\nsiege of Potidaea, and to respect the independence of Aegina. Above all,\nit gave her most distinctly to understand that war might be prevented\nby the revocation of the Megara decree, excluding the Megarians from the\nuse of Athenian harbours and of the market of Athens. But Athens was\nnot inclined either to revoke the decree, or to entertain their other\nproposals; she accused the Megarians of pushing their cultivation into\nthe consecrated ground and the unenclosed land on the border, and of\nharbouring her runaway slaves. At last an embassy arrived with the\nLacedaemonian ultimatum. The ambassadors were Ramphias, Melesippus, and\nAgesander. Not a word was said on any of the old subjects; there was\nsimply this: \"Lacedaemon wishes the peace to continue, and there is no\nreason why it should not, if you would leave the Hellenes independent.\"\nUpon this the Athenians held an assembly, and laid the matter before\ntheir consideration. It was resolved to deliberate once for all on all\ntheir demands, and to give them an answer. There were many speakers who\ncame forward and gave their support to one side or the other, urging\nthe necessity of war, or the revocation of the decree and the folly\nof allowing it to stand in the way of peace. Among them came forward\nPericles, son of Xanthippus, the first man of his time at Athens, ablest\nalike in counsel and in action, and gave the following advice:\n\n\"There is one principle, Athenians, which I hold to through everything,\nand that is the principle of no concession to the Peloponnesians. I know\nthat the spirit which inspires men while they are being persuaded to\nmake war is not always retained in action; that as circumstances change,\nresolutions change. Yet I see that now as before the same, almost\nliterally the same, counsel is demanded of me; and I put it to those of\nyou who are allowing yourselves to be persuaded, to support the national\nresolves even in the case of reverses, or to forfeit all credit for\ntheir wisdom in the event of success. For sometimes the course of things\nis as arbitrary as the plans of man; indeed this is why we usually blame\nchance for whatever does not happen as we expected. Now it was clear\nbefore that Lacedaemon entertained designs against us; it is still\nmore clear now. The treaty provides that we shall mutually submit our\ndifferences to legal settlement, and that we shall meanwhile each keep\nwhat we have. Yet the Lacedaemonians never yet made us any such offer,\nnever yet would accept from us any such offer; on the contrary, they\nwish complaints to be settled by war instead of by negotiation; and\nin the end we find them here dropping the tone of expostulation and\nadopting that of command. They order us to raise the siege of Potidaea,\nto let Aegina be independent, to revoke the Megara decree; and they\nconclude with an ultimatum warning us to leave the Hellenes independent.\nI hope that you will none of you think that we shall be going to war\nfor a trifle if we refuse to revoke the Megara decree, which appears\nin front of their complaints, and the revocation of which is to save us\nfrom war, or let any feeling of self-reproach linger in your minds, as\nif you went to war for slight cause. Why, this trifle contains the whole\nseal and trial of your resolution. If you give way, you will instantly\nhave to meet some greater demand, as having been frightened into\nobedience in the first instance; while a firm refusal will make them\nclearly understand that they must treat you more as equals. Make your\ndecision therefore at once, either to submit before you are harmed, or\nif we are to go to war, as I for one think we ought, to do so without\ncaring whether the ostensible cause be great or small, resolved\nagainst making concessions or consenting to a precarious tenure of our\npossessions. For all claims from an equal, urged upon a neighbour as\ncommands before any attempt at legal settlement, be they great or be\nthey small, have only one meaning, and that is slavery.\n\n\"As to the war and the resources of either party, a detailed comparison\nwill not show you the inferiority of Athens. Personally engaged in the\ncultivation of their land, without funds either private or public, the\nPeloponnesians are also without experience in long wars across sea, from\nthe strict limit which poverty imposes on their attacks upon each other.\nPowers of this description are quite incapable of often manning a fleet\nor often sending out an army: they cannot afford the absence from their\nhomes, the expenditure from their own funds; and besides, they have not\ncommand of the sea. Capital, it must be remembered, maintains a war more\nthan forced contributions. Farmers are a class of men that are always\nmore ready to serve in person than in purse. Confident that the former\nwill survive the dangers, they are by no means so sure that the latter\nwill not be prematurely exhausted, especially if the war last longer\nthan they expect, which it very likely will. In a single battle the\nPeloponnesians and their allies may be able to defy all Hellas, but they\nare incapacitated from carrying on a war against a power different in\ncharacter from their own, by the want of the single council-chamber\nrequisite to prompt and vigorous action, and the substitution of a diet\ncomposed of various races, in which every state possesses an equal vote,\nand each presses its own ends, a condition of things which generally\nresults in no action at all. The great wish of some is to avenge\nthemselves on some particular enemy, the great wish of others to save\ntheir own pocket. Slow in assembling, they devote a very small fraction\nof the time to the consideration of any public object, most of it to the\nprosecution of their own objects. Meanwhile each fancies that no harm\nwill come of his neglect, that it is the business of somebody else\nto look after this or that for him; and so, by the same notion being\nentertained by all separately, the common cause imperceptibly decays.\n\n\"But the principal point is the hindrance that they will experience from\nwant of money. The slowness with which it comes in will cause delay; but\nthe opportunities of war wait for no man. Again, we need not be alarmed\neither at the possibility of their raising fortifications in Attica, or\nat their navy. It would be difficult for any system of fortifications to\nestablish a rival city, even in time of peace, much more, surely, in\nan enemy's country, with Athens just as much fortified against it as it\nagainst Athens; while a mere post might be able to do some harm to the\ncountry by incursions and by the facilities which it would afford for\ndesertion, but can never prevent our sailing into their country and\nraising fortifications there, and making reprisals with our powerful\nfleet. For our naval skill is of more use to us for service on land,\nthan their military skill for service at sea. Familiarity with the sea\nthey will not find an easy acquisition. If you who have been practising\nat it ever since the Median invasion have not yet brought it to\nperfection, is there any chance of anything considerable being effected\nby an agricultural, unseafaring population, who will besides be\nprevented from practising by the constant presence of strong squadrons\nof observation from Athens? With a small squadron they might hazard an\nengagement, encouraging their ignorance by numbers; but the restraint of\na strong force will prevent their moving, and through want of practice\nthey will grow more clumsy, and consequently more timid. It must be kept\nin mind that seamanship, just like anything else, is a matter of art,\nand will not admit of being taken up occasionally as an occupation for\ntimes of leisure; on the contrary, it is so exacting as to leave leisure\nfor nothing else.\n\n\"Even if they were to touch the moneys at Olympia or Delphi, and try to\nseduce our foreign sailors by the temptation of higher pay, that would\nonly be a serious danger if we could not still be a match for them by\nembarking our own citizens and the aliens resident among us. But in fact\nby this means we are always a match for them; and, best of all, we have\na larger and higher class of native coxswains and sailors among our own\ncitizens than all the rest of Hellas. And to say nothing of the danger\nof such a step, none of our foreign sailors would consent to become an\noutlaw from his country, and to take service with them and their hopes,\nfor the sake of a few days' high pay.\n\n\"This, I think, is a tolerably fair account of the position of the\nPeloponnesians; that of Athens is free from the defects that I have\ncriticized in them, and has other advantages of its own, which they can\nshow nothing to equal. If they march against our country we will sail\nagainst theirs, and it will then be found that the desolation of\nthe whole of Attica is not the same as that of even a fraction of\nPeloponnese; for they will not be able to supply the deficiency except\nby a battle, while we have plenty of land both on the islands and the\ncontinent. The rule of the sea is indeed a great matter. Consider for\na moment. Suppose that we were islanders; can you conceive a more\nimpregnable position? Well, this in future should, as far as possible,\nbe our conception of our position. Dismissing all thought of our land\nand houses, we must vigilantly guard the sea and the city. No irritation\nthat we may feel for the former must provoke us to a battle with the\nnumerical superiority of the Peloponnesians. A victory would only be\nsucceeded by another battle against the same superiority: a reverse\ninvolves the loss of our allies, the source of our strength, who will\nnot remain quiet a day after we become unable to march against them. We\nmust cry not over the loss of houses and land but of men's lives; since\nhouses and land do not gain men, but men them. And if I had thought that\nI could persuade you, I would have bid you go out and lay them waste\nwith your own hands, and show the Peloponnesians that this at any rate\nwill not make you submit.\n\n\"I have many other reasons to hope for a favourable issue, if you can\nconsent not to combine schemes of fresh conquest with the conduct of\nthe war, and will abstain from wilfully involving yourselves in other\ndangers; indeed, I am more afraid of our own blunders than of the\nenemy's devices. But these matters shall be explained in another speech,\nas events require; for the present dismiss these men with the answer\nthat we will allow Megara the use of our market and harbours, when the\nLacedaemonians suspend their alien acts in favour of us and our allies,\nthere being nothing in the treaty to prevent either one or the other:\nthat we will leave the cities independent, if independent we found them\nwhen we made the treaty, and when the Lacedaemonians grant to their\ncities an independence not involving subservience to Lacedaemonian\ninterests, but such as each severally may desire: that we are willing\nto give the legal satisfaction which our agreements specify, and that we\nshall not commence hostilities, but shall resist those who do commence\nthem. This is an answer agreeable at once to the rights and the dignity\nof Athens. It must be thoroughly understood that war is a necessity; but\nthat the more readily we accept it, the less will be the ardour of\nour opponents, and that out of the greatest dangers communities and\nindividuals acquire the greatest glory. Did not our fathers resist the\nMedes not only with resources far different from ours, but even when\nthose resources had been abandoned; and more by wisdom than by fortune,\nmore by daring than by strength, did not they beat off the barbarian and\nadvance their affairs to their present height? We must not fall behind\nthem, but must resist our enemies in any way and in every way, and\nattempt to hand down our power to our posterity unimpaired.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Pericles. The Athenians, persuaded of the wisdom\nof his advice, voted as he desired, and answered the Lacedaemonians as\nhe recommended, both on the separate points and in the general; they\nwould do nothing on dictation, but were ready to have the complaints\nsettled in a fair and impartial manner by the legal method, which the\nterms of the truce prescribed. So the envoys departed home and did not\nreturn again.\n\nThese were the charges and differences existing between the rival powers\nbefore the war, arising immediately from the affair at Epidamnus and\nCorcyra. Still intercourse continued in spite of them, and mutual\ncommunication. It was carried on without heralds, but not without\nsuspicion, as events were occurring which were equivalent to a breach of\nthe treaty and matter for war.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_Beginning of the Peloponnesian War--First Invasion of Attica--Funeral\nOration of Pericles_\n\nThe war between the Athenians and Peloponnesians and the allies on\neither side now really begins. For now all intercourse except through\nthe medium of heralds ceased, and hostilities were commenced and\nprosecuted without intermission. The history follows the chronological\norder of events by summers and winters.\n\nThe thirty years' truce which was entered into after the conquest of\nEuboea lasted fourteen years. In the fifteenth, in the forty-eighth year\nof the priestess-ship of Chrysis at Argos, in the ephorate of Aenesias\nat Sparta, in the last month but two of the archonship of Pythodorus\nat Athens, and six months after the battle of Potidaea, just at the\nbeginning of spring, a Theban force a little over three hundred strong,\nunder the command of their Boeotarchs, Pythangelus, son of Phyleides,\nand Diemporus, son of Onetorides, about the first watch of the night,\nmade an armed entry into Plataea, a town of Boeotia in alliance with\nAthens. The gates were opened to them by a Plataean called Naucleides,\nwho, with his party, had invited them in, meaning to put to death the\ncitizens of the opposite party, bring over the city to Thebes, and thus\nobtain power for themselves. This was arranged through Eurymachus, son\nof Leontiades, a person of great influence at Thebes. For Plataea had\nalways been at variance with Thebes; and the latter, foreseeing that war\nwas at hand, wished to surprise her old enemy in time of peace, before\nhostilities had actually broken out. Indeed this was how they got in so\neasily without being observed, as no guard had been posted. After the\nsoldiers had grounded arms in the market-place, those who had invited\nthem in wished them to set to work at once and go to their enemies'\nhouses. This, however, the Thebans refused to do, but determined to\nmake a conciliatory proclamation, and if possible to come to a friendly\nunderstanding with the citizens. Their herald accordingly invited\nany who wished to resume their old place in the confederacy of their\ncountrymen to ground arms with them, for they thought that in this way\nthe city would readily join them.\n\nOn becoming aware of the presence of the Thebans within their gates, and\nof the sudden occupation of the town, the Plataeans concluded in\ntheir alarm that more had entered than was really the case, the night\npreventing their seeing them. They accordingly came to terms and,\naccepting the proposal, made no movement; especially as the Thebans\noffered none of them any violence. But somehow or other, during the\nnegotiations, they discovered the scanty numbers of the Thebans, and\ndecided that they could easily attack and overpower them; the mass of\nthe Plataeans being averse to revolting from Athens. At all events they\nresolved to attempt it. Digging through the party walls of the houses,\nthey thus managed to join each other without being seen going through\nthe streets, in which they placed wagons without the beasts in them, to\nserve as a barricade, and arranged everything else as seemed convenient\nfor the occasion. When everything had been done that circumstances\npermitted, they watched their opportunity and went out of their houses\nagainst the enemy. It was still night, though daybreak was at hand: in\ndaylight it was thought that their attack would be met by men full of\ncourage and on equal terms with their assailants, while in darkness\nit would fall upon panic-stricken troops, who would also be at a\ndisadvantage from their enemy's knowledge of the locality. So they made\ntheir assault at once, and came to close quarters as quickly as they\ncould.\n\nThe Thebans, finding themselves outwitted, immediately closed up to\nrepel all attacks made upon them. Twice or thrice they beat back their\nassailants. But the men shouted and charged them, the women and slaves\nscreamed and yelled from the houses and pelted them with stones and\ntiles; besides, it had been raining hard all night; and so at last their\ncourage gave way, and they turned and fled through the town. Most of the\nfugitives were quite ignorant of the right ways out, and this, with the\nmud, and the darkness caused by the moon being in her last quarter, and\nthe fact that their pursuers knew their way about and could easily stop\ntheir escape, proved fatal to many. The only gate open was the one\nby which they had entered, and this was shut by one of the Plataeans\ndriving the spike of a javelin into the bar instead of the bolt; so that\neven here there was no longer any means of exit. They were now chased\nall over the town. Some got on the wall and threw themselves over, in\nmost cases with a fatal result. One party managed to find a deserted\ngate, and obtaining an axe from a woman, cut through the bar; but as\nthey were soon observed only a few succeeded in getting out. Others were\ncut off in detail in different parts of the city. The most numerous and\ncompact body rushed into a large building next to the city wall: the\ndoors on the side of the street happened to be open, and the Thebans\nfancied that they were the gates of the town, and that there was a\npassage right through to the outside. The Plataeans, seeing their\nenemies in a trap, now consulted whether they should set fire to the\nbuilding and burn them just as they were, or whether there was anything\nelse that they could do with them; until at length these and the rest\nof the Theban survivors found wandering about the town agreed to an\nunconditional surrender of themselves and their arms to the Plataeans.\n\nWhile such was the fate of the party in Plataea, the rest of the Thebans\nwho were to have joined them with all their forces before daybreak, in\ncase of anything miscarrying with the body that had entered, received\nthe news of the affair on the road, and pressed forward to their\nsuccour. Now Plataea is nearly eight miles from Thebes, and their march\ndelayed by the rain that had fallen in the night, for the river Asopus\nhad risen and was not easy of passage; and so, having to march in the\nrain, and being hindered in crossing the river, they arrived too late,\nand found the whole party either slain or captive. When they learned\nwhat had happened, they at once formed a design against the Plataeans\noutside the city. As the attack had been made in time of peace, and was\nperfectly unexpected, there were of course men and stock in the fields;\nand the Thebans wished if possible to have some prisoners to exchange\nagainst their countrymen in the town, should any chance to have been\ntaken alive. Such was their plan. But the Plataeans suspected their\nintention almost before it was formed, and becoming alarmed for\ntheir fellow citizens outside the town, sent a herald to the Thebans,\nreproaching them for their unscrupulous attempt to seize their city in\ntime of peace, and warning them against any outrage on those outside.\nShould the warning be disregarded, they threatened to put to death the\nmen they had in their hands, but added that, on the Thebans retiring\nfrom their territory, they would surrender the prisoners to their\nfriends. This is the Theban account of the matter, and they say that\nthey had an oath given them. The Plataeans, on the other hand, do not\nadmit any promise of an immediate surrender, but make it contingent upon\nsubsequent negotiation: the oath they deny altogether. Be this as it\nmay, upon the Thebans retiring from their territory without committing\nany injury, the Plataeans hastily got in whatever they had in the\ncountry and immediately put the men to death. The prisoners were a\nhundred and eighty in number; Eurymachus, the person with whom the\ntraitors had negotiated, being one.\n\nThis done, the Plataeans sent a messenger to Athens, gave back the dead\nto the Thebans under a truce, and arranged things in the city as seemed\nbest to meet the present emergency. The Athenians meanwhile, having\nhad word of the affair sent them immediately after its occurrence, had\ninstantly seized all the Boeotians in Attica, and sent a herald to the\nPlataeans to forbid their proceeding to extremities with their Theban\nprisoners without instructions from Athens. The news of the men's death\nhad of course not arrived; the first messenger having left Plataea just\nwhen the Thebans entered it, the second just after their defeat and\ncapture; so there was no later news. Thus the Athenians sent orders\nin ignorance of the facts; and the herald on his arrival found the\nmen slain. After this the Athenians marched to Plataea and brought in\nprovisions, and left a garrison in the place, also taking away the women\nand children and such of the men as were least efficient.\n\nAfter the affair at Plataea, the treaty had been broken by an overt\nact, and Athens at once prepared for war, as did also Lacedaemon and her\nallies. They resolved to send embassies to the King and to such other of\nthe barbarian powers as either party could look to for assistance,\nand tried to ally themselves with the independent states at home.\nLacedaemon, in addition to the existing marine, gave orders to the\nstates that had declared for her in Italy and Sicily to build vessels\nup to a grand total of five hundred, the quota of each city being\ndetermined by its size, and also to provide a specified sum of money.\nTill these were ready they were to remain neutral and to admit single\nAthenian ships into their harbours. Athens on her part reviewed her\nexisting confederacy, and sent embassies to the places more\nimmediately round Peloponnese--Corcyra, Cephallenia, Acarnania, and\nZacynthus--perceiving that if these could be relied on she could carry\nthe war all round Peloponnese.\n\nAnd if both sides nourished the boldest hopes and put forth their utmost\nstrength for the war, this was only natural. Zeal is always at its\nheight at the commencement of an undertaking; and on this particular\noccasion Peloponnese and Athens were both full of young men whose\ninexperience made them eager to take up arms, while the rest of Hellas\nstood straining with excitement at the conflict of its leading cities.\nEverywhere predictions were being recited and oracles being chanted\nby such persons as collect them, and this not only in the contending\ncities. Further, some while before this, there was an earthquake at\nDelos, for the first time in the memory of the Hellenes. This was said\nand thought to be ominous of the events impending; indeed, nothing of\nthe kind that happened was allowed to pass without remark. The good\nwishes of men made greatly for the Lacedaemonians, especially as they\nproclaimed themselves the liberators of Hellas. No private or public\neffort that could help them in speech or action was omitted; each\nthinking that the cause suffered wherever he could not himself see to\nit. So general was the indignation felt against Athens, whether by those\nwho wished to escape from her empire, or were apprehensive of being\nabsorbed by it. Such were the preparations and such the feelings with\nwhich the contest opened.\n\nThe allies of the two belligerents were the following. These were the\nallies of Lacedaemon: all the Peloponnesians within the Isthmus except\nthe Argives and Achaeans, who were neutral; Pellene being the only\nAchaean city that first joined in the war, though her example was\nafterwards followed by the rest. Outside Peloponnese the Megarians,\nLocrians, Boeotians, Phocians, Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Anactorians.\nOf these, ships were furnished by the Corinthians, Megarians,\nSicyonians, Pellenians, Eleans, Ambraciots, and Leucadians; and\ncavalry by the Boeotians, Phocians, and Locrians. The other states\nsent infantry. This was the Lacedaemonian confederacy. That of Athens\ncomprised the Chians, Lesbians, Plataeans, the Messenians in Naupactus,\nmost of the Acarnanians, the Corcyraeans, Zacynthians, and some\ntributary cities in the following countries, viz., Caria upon the sea\nwith her Dorian neighbours, Ionia, the Hellespont, the Thracian towns,\nthe islands lying between Peloponnese and Crete towards the east, and\nall the Cyclades except Melos and Thera. Of these, ships were furnished\nby Chios, Lesbos, and Corcyra, infantry and money by the rest. Such were\nthe allies of either party and their resources for the war.\n\nImmediately after the affair at Plataea, Lacedaemon sent round orders\nto the cities in Peloponnese and the rest of her confederacy to prepare\ntroops and the provisions requisite for a foreign campaign, in order to\ninvade Attica. The several states were ready at the time appointed and\nassembled at the Isthmus: the contingent of each city being two-thirds\nof its whole force. After the whole army had mustered, the Lacedaemonian\nking, Archidamus, the leader of the expedition, called together the\ngenerals of all the states and the principal persons and officers, and\nexhorted them as follows:\n\n\"Peloponnesians and allies, our fathers made many campaigns both within\nand without Peloponnese, and the elder men among us here are not without\nexperience in war. Yet we have never set out with a larger force than\nthe present; and if our numbers and efficiency are remarkable, so also\nis the power of the state against which we march. We ought not then\nto show ourselves inferior to our ancestors, or unequal to our own\nreputation. For the hopes and attention of all Hellas are bent upon the\npresent effort, and its sympathy is with the enemy of the hated Athens.\nTherefore, numerous as the invading army may appear to be, and certain\nas some may think it that our adversary will not meet us in the field,\nthis is no sort of justification for the least negligence upon the\nmarch; but the officers and men of each particular city should always be\nprepared for the advent of danger in their own quarters. The course of\nwar cannot be foreseen, and its attacks are generally dictated by\nthe impulse of the moment; and where overweening self-confidence has\ndespised preparation, a wise apprehension often been able to make head\nagainst superior numbers. Not that confidence is out of place in an army\nof invasion, but in an enemy's country it should also be accompanied by\nthe precautions of apprehension: troops will by this combination be best\ninspired for dealing a blow, and best secured against receiving one.\nIn the present instance, the city against which we are going, far from\nbeing so impotent for defence, is on the contrary most excellently\nequipped at all points; so that we have every reason to expect that\nthey will take the field against us, and that if they have not set out\nalready before we are there, they will certainly do so when they see us\nin their territory wasting and destroying their property. For men\nare always exasperated at suffering injuries to which they are not\naccustomed, and on seeing them inflicted before their very eyes; and\nwhere least inclined for reflection, rush with the greatest heat to\naction. The Athenians are the very people of all others to do this, as\nthey aspire to rule the rest of the world, and are more in the habit of\ninvading and ravaging their neighbours' territory, than of seeing their\nown treated in the like fashion. Considering, therefore, the power\nof the state against which we are marching, and the greatness of the\nreputation which, according to the event, we shall win or lose for our\nancestors and ourselves, remember as you follow where you may be led to\nregard discipline and vigilance as of the first importance, and to obey\nwith alacrity the orders transmitted to you; as nothing contributes so\nmuch to the credit and safety of an army as the union of large bodies by\na single discipline.\"\n\nWith this brief speech dismissing the assembly, Archidamus first sent\noff Melesippus, son of Diacritus, a Spartan, to Athens, in case she\nshould be more inclined to submit on seeing the Peloponnesians actually\non the march. But the Athenians did not admit into the city or to their\nassembly, Pericles having already carried a motion against admitting\neither herald or embassy from the Lacedaemonians after they had once\nmarched out.\n\nThe herald was accordingly sent away without an audience, and ordered to\nbe beyond the frontier that same day; in future, if those who sent\nhim had a proposition to make, they must retire to their own territory\nbefore they dispatched embassies to Athens. An escort was sent with\nMelesippus to prevent his holding communication with any one. When he\nreached the frontier and was just going to be dismissed, he departed\nwith these words: \"This day will be the beginning of great misfortunes\nto the Hellenes.\" As soon as he arrived at the camp, and Archidamus\nlearnt that the Athenians had still no thoughts of submitting, he at\nlength began his march, and advanced with his army into their territory.\nMeanwhile the Boeotians, sending their contingent and cavalry to join\nthe Peloponnesian expedition, went to Plataea with the remainder and\nlaid waste the country.\n\nWhile the Peloponnesians were still mustering at the Isthmus, or on the\nmarch before they invaded Attica, Pericles, son of Xanthippus, one of\nthe ten generals of the Athenians, finding that the invasion was to\ntake place, conceived the idea that Archidamus, who happened to be his\nfriend, might possibly pass by his estate without ravaging it. This he\nmight do, either from a personal wish to oblige him, or acting under\ninstructions from Lacedaemon for the purpose of creating a prejudice\nagainst him, as had been before attempted in the demand for the\nexpulsion of the accursed family. He accordingly took the precaution of\nannouncing to the Athenians in the assembly that, although Archidamus\nwas his friend, yet this friendship should not extend to the detriment\nof the state, and that in case the enemy should make his houses and\nlands an exception to the rest and not pillage them, he at once gave\nthem up to be public property, so that they should not bring him into\nsuspicion. He also gave the citizens some advice on their present\naffairs in the same strain as before. They were to prepare for the war,\nand to carry in their property from the country. They were not to go out\nto battle, but to come into the city and guard it, and get ready their\nfleet, in which their real strength lay. They were also to keep a tight\nrein on their allies--the strength of Athens being derived from the\nmoney brought in by their payments, and success in war depending\nprincipally upon conduct and capital, had no reason to despond. Apart\nfrom other sources of income, an average revenue of six hundred talents\nof silver was drawn from the tribute of the allies; and there were still\nsix thousand talents of coined silver in the Acropolis, out of nine\nthousand seven hundred that had once been there, from which the\nmoney had been taken for the porch of the Acropolis, the other public\nbuildings, and for Potidaea. This did not include the uncoined gold\nand silver in public and private offerings, the sacred vessels for the\nprocessions and games, the Median spoils, and similar resources to the\namount of five hundred talents. To this he added the treasures of the\nother temples. These were by no means inconsiderable, and might fairly\nbe used. Nay, if they were ever absolutely driven to it, they might\ntake even the gold ornaments of Athene herself; for the statue contained\nforty talents of pure gold and it was all removable. This might be used\nfor self-preservation, and must every penny of it be restored. Such was\ntheir financial position--surely a satisfactory one. Then they had an\narmy of thirteen thousand heavy infantry, besides sixteen thousand\nmore in the garrisons and on home duty at Athens. This was at first the\nnumber of men on guard in the event of an invasion: it was composed of\nthe oldest and youngest levies and the resident aliens who had heavy\narmour. The Phaleric wall ran for four miles, before it joined that\nround the city; and of this last nearly five had a guard, although part\nof it was left without one, viz., that between the Long Wall and the\nPhaleric. Then there were the Long Walls to Piraeus, a distance of\nsome four miles and a half, the outer of which was manned. Lastly, the\ncircumference of Piraeus with Munychia was nearly seven miles and a\nhalf; only half of this, however, was guarded. Pericles also showed\nthem that they had twelve hundred horse including mounted archers, with\nsixteen hundred archers unmounted, and three hundred galleys fit for\nservice. Such were the resources of Athens in the different departments\nwhen the Peloponnesian invasion was impending and hostilities were\nbeing commenced. Pericles also urged his usual arguments for expecting a\nfavourable issue to the war.\n\nThe Athenians listened to his advice, and began to carry in their wives\nand children from the country, and all their household furniture, even\nto the woodwork of their houses which they took down. Their sheep and\ncattle they sent over to Euboea and the adjacent islands. But they found\nit hard to move, as most of them had been always used to live in the\ncountry.\n\nFrom very early times this had been more the case with the Athenians\nthan with others. Under Cecrops and the first kings, down to the reign\nof Theseus, Attica had always consisted of a number of independent\ntownships, each with its own town hall and magistrates. Except in times\nof danger the king at Athens was not consulted; in ordinary seasons\nthey carried on their government and settled their affairs without his\ninterference; sometimes even they waged war against him, as in the\ncase of the Eleusinians with Eumolpus against Erechtheus. In Theseus,\nhowever, they had a king of equal intelligence and power; and one of\nthe chief features in his organization of the country was to abolish the\ncouncil-chambers and magistrates of the petty cities, and to merge them\nin the single council-chamber and town hall of the present capital.\nIndividuals might still enjoy their private property just as before, but\nthey were henceforth compelled to have only one political centre, viz.,\nAthens; which thus counted all the inhabitants of Attica among her\ncitizens, so that when Theseus died he left a great state behind him.\nIndeed, from him dates the Synoecia, or Feast of Union; which is paid\nfor by the state, and which the Athenians still keep in honour of the\ngoddess. Before this the city consisted of the present citadel and the\ndistrict beneath it looking rather towards the south. This is shown by\nthe fact that the temples of the other deities, besides that of Athene,\nare in the citadel; and even those that are outside it are mostly\nsituated in this quarter of the city, as that of the Olympian Zeus, of\nthe Pythian Apollo, of Earth, and of Dionysus in the Marshes, the same\nin whose honour the older Dionysia are to this day celebrated in the\nmonth of Anthesterion not only by the Athenians but also by their Ionian\ndescendants. There are also other ancient temples in this quarter. The\nfountain too, which, since the alteration made by the tyrants, has been\ncalled Enneacrounos, or Nine Pipes, but which, when the spring was open,\nwent by the name of Callirhoe, or Fairwater, was in those days, from\nbeing so near, used for the most important offices. Indeed, the old\nfashion of using the water before marriage and for other sacred purposes\nis still kept up. Again, from their old residence in that quarter, the\ncitadel is still known among Athenians as the city.\n\nThe Athenians thus long lived scattered over Attica in independent\ntownships. Even after the centralization of Theseus, old habit still\nprevailed; and from the early times down to the present war most\nAthenians still lived in the country with their families and households,\nand were consequently not at all inclined to move now, especially\nas they had only just restored their establishments after the Median\ninvasion. Deep was their trouble and discontent at abandoning their\nhouses and the hereditary temples of the ancient constitution, and at\nhaving to change their habits of life and to bid farewell to what each\nregarded as his native city.\n\nWhen they arrived at Athens, though a few had houses of their own to\ngo to, or could find an asylum with friends or relatives, by far the\ngreater number had to take up their dwelling in the parts of the city\nthat were not built over and in the temples and chapels of the heroes,\nexcept the Acropolis and the temple of the Eleusinian Demeter and such\nother Places as were always kept closed. The occupation of the plot of\nground lying below the citadel called the Pelasgian had been forbidden\nby a curse; and there was also an ominous fragment of a Pythian oracle\nwhich said:\n\nLeave the Pelasgian parcel desolate, Woe worth the day that men inhabit\nit!\n\nYet this too was now built over in the necessity of the moment. And in\nmy opinion, if the oracle proved true, it was in the opposite sense to\nwhat was expected. For the misfortunes of the state did not arise from\nthe unlawful occupation, but the necessity of the occupation from the\nwar; and though the god did not mention this, he foresaw that it would\nbe an evil day for Athens in which the plot came to be inhabited. Many\nalso took up their quarters in the towers of the walls or wherever else\nthey could. For when they were all come in, the city proved too small\nto hold them; though afterwards they divided the Long Walls and a\ngreat part of Piraeus into lots and settled there. All this while great\nattention was being given to the war; the allies were being mustered,\nand an armament of a hundred ships equipped for Peloponnese. Such was\nthe state of preparation at Athens.\n\nMeanwhile the army of the Peloponnesians was advancing. The first town\nthey came to in Attica was Oenoe, where they to enter the country.\nSitting down before it, they prepared to assault the wall with engines\nand otherwise. Oenoe, standing upon the Athenian and Boeotian border,\nwas of course a walled town, and was used as a fortress by the Athenians\nin time of war. So the Peloponnesians prepared for their assault, and\nwasted some valuable time before the place. This delay brought the\ngravest censure upon Archidamus. Even during the levying of the war he\nhad credit for weakness and Athenian sympathies by the half measures he\nhad advocated; and after the army had assembled he had further injured\nhimself in public estimation by his loitering at the Isthmus and the\nslowness with which the rest of the march had been conducted. But all\nthis was as nothing to the delay at Oenoe. During this interval the\nAthenians were carrying in their property; and it was the belief of the\nPeloponnesians that a quick advance would have found everything still\nout, had it not been for his procrastination. Such was the feeling\nof the army towards Archidamus during the siege. But he, it is said,\nexpected that the Athenians would shrink from letting their land be\nwasted, and would make their submission while it was still uninjured;\nand this was why he waited.\n\nBut after he had assaulted Oenoe, and every possible attempt to take it\nhad failed, as no herald came from Athens, he at last broke up his camp\nand invaded Attica. This was about eighty days after the Theban attempt\nupon Plataea, just in the middle of summer, when the corn was ripe, and\nArchidamus, son of Zeuxis, king of Lacedaemon, was in command. Encamping\nin Eleusis and the Thriasian plain, they began their ravages, and\nputting to flight some Athenian horse at a place called Rheiti, or\nthe Brooks, they then advanced, keeping Mount Aegaleus on their right,\nthrough Cropia, until they reached Acharnae, the largest of the Athenian\ndemes or townships. Sitting down before it, they formed a camp there,\nand continued their ravages for a long while.\n\nThe reason why Archidamus remained in order of battle at Acharnae during\nthis incursion, instead of descending into the plain, is said to have\nbeen this. He hoped that the Athenians might possibly be tempted by\nthe multitude of their youth and the unprecedented efficiency of their\nservice to come out to battle and attempt to stop the devastation\nof their lands. Accordingly, as they had met him at Eleusis or the\nThriasian plain, he tried if they could be provoked to a sally by the\nspectacle of a camp at Acharnae. He thought the place itself a good\nposition for encamping; and it seemed likely that such an important\npart of the state as the three thousand heavy infantry of the Acharnians\nwould refuse to submit to the ruin of their property, and would force\na battle on the rest of the citizens. On the other hand, should the\nAthenians not take the field during this incursion, he could then\nfearlessly ravage the plain in future invasions, and extend his advance\nup to the very walls of Athens. After the Acharnians had lost their own\nproperty they would be less willing to risk themselves for that of their\nneighbours; and so there would be division in the Athenian counsels.\nThese were the motives of Archidamus for remaining at Acharnae.\n\nIn the meanwhile, as long as the army was at Eleusis and the Thriasian\nplain, hopes were still entertained of its not advancing any nearer. It\nwas remembered that Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, king of Lacedaemon,\nhad invaded Attica with a Peloponnesian army fourteen years before, but\nhad retreated without advancing farther than Eleusis and Thria, which\nindeed proved the cause of his exile from Sparta, as it was thought\nhe had been bribed to retreat. But when they saw the army at Acharnae,\nbarely seven miles from Athens, they lost all patience. The territory of\nAthens was being ravaged before the very eyes of the Athenians, a sight\nwhich the young men had never seen before and the old only in the\nMedian wars; and it was naturally thought a grievous insult, and the\ndetermination was universal, especially among the young men, to sally\nforth and stop it. Knots were formed in the streets and engaged in hot\ndiscussion; for if the proposed sally was warmly recommended, it was\nalso in some cases opposed. Oracles of the most various import were\nrecited by the collectors, and found eager listeners in one or other of\nthe disputants. Foremost in pressing for the sally were the Acharnians,\nas constituting no small part of the army of the state, and as it was\ntheir land that was being ravaged. In short, the whole city was in a\nmost excited state; Pericles was the object of general indignation; his\nprevious counsels were totally forgotten; he was abused for not leading\nout the army which he commanded, and was made responsible for the whole\nof the public suffering.\n\nHe, meanwhile, seeing anger and infatuation just now in the ascendant,\nand of his wisdom in refusing a sally, would not call either assembly or\nmeeting of the people, fearing the fatal results of a debate inspired\nby passion and not by prudence. Accordingly he addressed himself to\nthe defence of the city, and kept it as quiet as possible, though he\nconstantly sent out cavalry to prevent raids on the lands near the city\nfrom flying parties of the enemy. There was a trifling affair at Phrygia\nbetween a squadron of the Athenian horse with the Thessalians and the\nBoeotian cavalry; in which the former had rather the best of it, until\nthe heavy infantry advanced to the support of the Boeotians, when the\nThessalians and Athenians were routed and lost a few men, whose bodies,\nhowever, were recovered the same day without a truce. The next day the\nPeloponnesians set up a trophy. Ancient alliance brought the Thessalians\nto the aid of Athens; those who came being the Larisaeans, Pharsalians,\nCranonians, Pyrasians, Gyrtonians, and Pheraeans. The Larisaean\ncommanders were Polymedes and Aristonus, two party leaders in Larisa;\nthe Pharsalian general was Menon; each of the other cities had also its\nown commander.\n\nIn the meantime the Peloponnesians, as the Athenians did not come out\nto engage them, broke up from Acharnae and ravaged some of the demes\nbetween Mount Parnes and Brilessus. While they were in Attica the\nAthenians sent off the hundred ships which they had been preparing round\nPeloponnese, with a thousand heavy infantry and four hundred archers on\nboard, under the command of Carcinus, son of Xenotimus, Proteas, son of\nEpicles, and Socrates, son of Antigenes. This armament weighed anchor\nand started on its cruise, and the Peloponnesians, after remaining in\nAttica as long as their provisions lasted, retired through Boeotia by a\ndifferent road to that by which they had entered. As they passed Oropus\nthey ravaged the territory of Graea, which is held by the Oropians from\nAthens, and reaching Peloponnese broke up to their respective cities.\n\nAfter they had retired the Athenians set guards by land and sea at the\npoints at which they intended to have regular stations during the war.\nThey also resolved to set apart a special fund of a thousand talents\nfrom the moneys in the Acropolis. This was not to be spent, but the\ncurrent expenses of the war were to be otherwise provided for. If any\none should move or put to the vote a proposition for using the money for\nany purpose whatever except that of defending the city in the event\nof the enemy bringing a fleet to make an attack by sea, it should be a\ncapital offence. With this sum of money they also set aside a special\nfleet of one hundred galleys, the best ships of each year, with their\ncaptains. None of these were to be used except with the money and\nagainst the same peril, should such peril arise.\n\nMeanwhile the Athenians in the hundred ships round Peloponnese,\nreinforced by a Corcyraean squadron of fifty vessels and some others\nof the allies in those parts, cruised about the coasts and ravaged the\ncountry. Among other places they landed in Laconia and made an assault\nupon Methone; there being no garrison in the place, and the wall being\nweak. But it so happened that Brasidas, son of Tellis, a Spartan, was\nin command of a guard for the defence of the district. Hearing of the\nattack, he hurried with a hundred heavy infantry to the assistance of\nthe besieged, and dashing through the army of the Athenians, which was\nscattered over the country and had its attention turned to the wall,\nthrew himself into Methone. He lost a few men in making good his\nentrance, but saved the place and won the thanks of Sparta by his\nexploit, being thus the first officer who obtained this notice during\nthe war. The Athenians at once weighed anchor and continued their\ncruise. Touching at Pheia in Elis, they ravaged the country for two days\nand defeated a picked force of three hundred men that had come from the\nvale of Elis and the immediate neighbourhood to the rescue. But a stiff\nsquall came down upon them, and, not liking to face it in a place\nwhere there was no harbour, most of them got on board their ships, and\ndoubling Point Ichthys sailed into the port of Pheia. In the meantime\nthe Messenians, and some others who could not get on board, marched over\nby land and took Pheia. The fleet afterwards sailed round and picked\nthem up and then put to sea; Pheia being evacuated, as the main army of\nthe Eleans had now come up. The Athenians continued their cruise, and\nravaged other places on the coast.\n\nAbout the same time the Athenians sent thirty ships to cruise round\nLocris and also to guard Euboea; Cleopompus, son of Clinias, being in\ncommand. Making descents from the fleet he ravaged certain places on\nthe sea-coast, and captured Thronium and took hostages from it. He also\ndefeated at Alope the Locrians that had assembled to resist him.\n\nDuring the summer the Athenians also expelled the Aeginetans with their\nwives and children from Aegina, on the ground of their having been the\nchief agents in bringing the war upon them. Besides, Aegina lies so near\nPeloponnese that it seemed safer to send colonists of their own to hold\nit, and shortly afterwards the settlers were sent out. The banished\nAeginetans found an asylum in Thyrea, which was given to them by\nLacedaemon, not only on account of her quarrel with Athens, but also\nbecause the Aeginetans had laid her under obligations at the time of the\nearthquake and the revolt of the Helots. The territory of Thyrea is on\nthe frontier of Argolis and Laconia, reaching down to the sea. Those of\nthe Aeginetans who did not settle here were scattered over the rest of\nHellas.\n\nThe same summer, at the beginning of a new lunar month, the only time by\nthe way at which it appears possible, the sun was eclipsed after noon.\nAfter it had assumed the form of a crescent and some of the stars had\ncome out, it returned to its natural shape.\n\nDuring the same summer Nymphodorus, son of Pythes, an Abderite, whose\nsister Sitalces had married, was made their proxenus by the Athenians\nand sent for to Athens. They had hitherto considered him their enemy;\nbut he had great influence with Sitalces, and they wished this prince\nto become their ally. Sitalces was the son of Teres and King of the\nThracians. Teres, the father of Sitalces, was the first to establish the\ngreat kingdom of the Odrysians on a scale quite unknown to the rest of\nThrace, a large portion of the Thracians being independent. This Teres\nis in no way related to Tereus who married Pandion's daughter Procne\nfrom Athens; nor indeed did they belong to the same part of Thrace.\nTereus lived in Daulis, part of what is now called Phocis, but which at\nthat time was inhabited by Thracians. It was in this land that the\nwomen perpetrated the outrage upon Itys; and many of the poets when they\nmention the nightingale call it the Daulian bird. Besides, Pandion in\ncontracting an alliance for his daughter would consider the advantages\nof mutual assistance, and would naturally prefer a match at the above\nmoderate distance to the journey of many days which separates Athens\nfrom the Odrysians. Again the names are different; and this Teres was\nking of the Odrysians, the first by the way who attained to any power.\nSitalces, his son, was now sought as an ally by the Athenians, who\ndesired his aid in the reduction of the Thracian towns and of Perdiccas.\nComing to Athens, Nymphodorus concluded the alliance with Sitalces and\nmade his son Sadocus an Athenian citizen, and promised to finish the\nwar in Thrace by persuading Sitalces to send the Athenians a force of\nThracian horse and targeteers. He also reconciled them with Perdiccas,\nand induced them to restore Therme to him; upon which Perdiccas at\nonce joined the Athenians and Phormio in an expedition against the\nChalcidians. Thus Sitalces, son of Teres, King of the Thracians, and\nPerdiccas, son of Alexander, King of the Macedonians, became allies of\nAthens.\n\nMeanwhile the Athenians in the hundred vessels were still cruising round\nPeloponnese. After taking Sollium, a town belonging to Corinth, and\npresenting the city and territory to the Acarnanians of Palaira, they\nstormed Astacus, expelled its tyrant Evarchus, and gained the place for\ntheir confederacy. Next they sailed to the island of Cephallenia and\nbrought it over without using force. Cephallenia lies off Acarnania and\nLeucas, and consists of four states, the Paleans, Cranians, Samaeans,\nand Pronaeans. Not long afterwards the fleet returned to Athens. Towards\nthe autumn of this year the Athenians invaded the Megarid with their\nwhole levy, resident aliens included, under the command of Pericles, son\nof Xanthippus. The Athenians in the hundred ships round Peloponnese\non their journey home had just reached Aegina, and hearing that the\ncitizens at home were in full force at Megara, now sailed over and\njoined them. This was without doubt the largest army of Athenians ever\nassembled, the state being still in the flower of her strength and yet\nunvisited by the plague. Full ten thousand heavy infantry were in\nthe field, all Athenian citizens, besides the three thousand before\nPotidaea. Then the resident aliens who joined in the incursion were\nat least three thousand strong; besides which there was a multitude of\nlight troops. They ravaged the greater part of the territory, and then\nretired. Other incursions into the Megarid were afterwards made by\nthe Athenians annually during the war, sometimes only with cavalry,\nsometimes with all their forces. This went on until the capture of\nNisaea. Atalanta also, the desert island off the Opuntian coast, was\ntowards the end of this summer converted into a fortified post by the\nAthenians, in order to prevent privateers issuing from Opus and the rest\nof Locris and plundering Euboea. Such were the events of this summer\nafter the return of the Peloponnesians from Attica.\n\nIn the ensuing winter the Acarnanian Evarchus, wishing to return to\nAstacus, persuaded the Corinthians to sail over with forty ships and\nfifteen hundred heavy infantry and restore him; himself also hiring\nsome mercenaries. In command of the force were Euphamidas, son of\nAristonymus, Timoxenus, son of Timocrates, and Eumachus, son of Chrysis,\nwho sailed over and restored him and, after failing in an attempt on\nsome places on the Acarnanian coast which they were desirous of\ngaining, began their voyage home. Coasting along shore they touched at\nCephallenia and made a descent on the Cranian territory, and losing some\nmen by the treachery of the Cranians, who fell suddenly upon them after\nhaving agreed to treat, put to sea somewhat hurriedly and returned home.\n\nIn the same winter the Athenians gave a funeral at the public cost\nto those who had first fallen in this war. It was a custom of their\nancestors, and the manner of it is as follows. Three days before the\nceremony, the bones of the dead are laid out in a tent which has been\nerected; and their friends bring to their relatives such offerings as\nthey please. In the funeral procession cypress coffins are borne in\ncars, one for each tribe; the bones of the deceased being placed in the\ncoffin of their tribe. Among these is carried one empty bier decked for\nthe missing, that is, for those whose bodies could not be recovered. Any\ncitizen or stranger who pleases, joins in the procession: and the female\nrelatives are there to wail at the burial. The dead are laid in the\npublic sepulchre in the Beautiful suburb of the city, in which those\nwho fall in war are always buried; with the exception of those slain at\nMarathon, who for their singular and extraordinary valour were interred\non the spot where they fell. After the bodies have been laid in the\nearth, a man chosen by the state, of approved wisdom and eminent\nreputation, pronounces over them an appropriate panegyric; after which\nall retire. Such is the manner of the burying; and throughout the whole\nof the war, whenever the occasion arose, the established custom was\nobserved. Meanwhile these were the first that had fallen, and Pericles,\nson of Xanthippus, was chosen to pronounce their eulogium. When the\nproper time arrived, he advanced from the sepulchre to an elevated\nplatform in order to be heard by as many of the crowd as possible, and\nspoke as follows:\n\n\"Most of my predecessors in this place have commended him who made this\nspeech part of the law, telling us that it is well that it should be\ndelivered at the burial of those who fall in battle. For myself, I\nshould have thought that the worth which had displayed itself in deeds\nwould be sufficiently rewarded by honours also shown by deeds; such as\nyou now see in this funeral prepared at the people's cost. And I could\nhave wished that the reputations of many brave men were not to be\nimperilled in the mouth of a single individual, to stand or fall\naccording as he spoke well or ill. For it is hard to speak properly upon\na subject where it is even difficult to convince your hearers that you\nare speaking the truth. On the one hand, the friend who is familiar with\nevery fact of the story may think that some point has not been set\nforth with that fullness which he wishes and knows it to deserve; on the\nother, he who is a stranger to the matter may be led by envy to suspect\nexaggeration if he hears anything above his own nature. For men can\nendure to hear others praised only so long as they can severally\npersuade themselves of their own ability to equal the actions recounted:\nwhen this point is passed, envy comes in and with it incredulity.\nHowever, since our ancestors have stamped this custom with their\napproval, it becomes my duty to obey the law and to try to satisfy your\nseveral wishes and opinions as best I may.\n\n\"I shall begin with our ancestors: it is both just and proper that they\nshould have the honour of the first mention on an occasion like the\npresent. They dwelt in the country without break in the succession from\ngeneration to generation, and handed it down free to the present time by\ntheir valour. And if our more remote ancestors deserve praise, much more\ndo our own fathers, who added to their inheritance the empire which we\nnow possess, and spared no pains to be able to leave their acquisitions\nto us of the present generation. Lastly, there are few parts of our\ndominions that have not been augmented by those of us here, who are\nstill more or less in the vigour of life; while the mother country has\nbeen furnished by us with everything that can enable her to depend on\nher own resources whether for war or for peace. That part of our history\nwhich tells of the military achievements which gave us our several\npossessions, or of the ready valour with which either we or our fathers\nstemmed the tide of Hellenic or foreign aggression, is a theme too\nfamiliar to my hearers for me to dilate on, and I shall therefore pass\nit by. But what was the road by which we reached our position, what the\nform of government under which our greatness grew, what the national\nhabits out of which it sprang; these are questions which I may try to\nsolve before I proceed to my panegyric upon these men; since I think\nthis to be a subject upon which on the present occasion a speaker may\nproperly dwell, and to which the whole assemblage, whether citizens or\nforeigners, may listen with advantage.\n\n\"Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are\nrather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration\nfavours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a\ndemocracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in\ntheir private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public\nlife falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being\nallowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if\na man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of\nhis condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also\nto our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous surveillance\nover each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry with our\nneighbour for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those injurious\nlooks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they inflict no\npositive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations does not\nmake us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief safeguard,\nteaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws, particularly such as\nregard the protection of the injured, whether they are actually on the\nstatute book, or belong to that code which, although unwritten, yet\ncannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.\n\n\"Further, we provide plenty of means for the mind to refresh itself from\nbusiness. We celebrate games and sacrifices all the year round, and the\nelegance of our private establishments forms a daily source of pleasure\nand helps to banish the spleen; while the magnitude of our city draws\nthe produce of the world into our harbour, so that to the Athenian the\nfruits of other countries are as familiar a luxury as those of his own.\n\n\"If we turn to our military policy, there also we differ from our\nantagonists. We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien\nacts exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing,\nalthough the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our liberality;\ntrusting less in system and policy than to the native spirit of our\ncitizens; while in education, where our rivals from their very cradles\nby a painful discipline seek after manliness, at Athens we live exactly\nas we please, and yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate\ndanger. In proof of this it may be noticed that the Lacedaemonians\ndo not invade our country alone, but bring with them all their\nconfederates; while we Athenians advance unsupported into the territory\nof a neighbour, and fighting upon a foreign soil usually vanquish with\nease men who are defending their homes. Our united force was never\nyet encountered by any enemy, because we have at once to attend to our\nmarine and to dispatch our citizens by land upon a hundred different\nservices; so that, wherever they engage with some such fraction of our\nstrength, a success against a detachment is magnified into a victory\nover the nation, and a defeat into a reverse suffered at the hands of\nour entire people. And yet if with habits not of labour but of ease,\nand courage not of art but of nature, we are still willing to encounter\ndanger, we have the double advantage of escaping the experience of\nhardships in anticipation and of facing them in the hour of need as\nfearlessly as those who are never free from them.\n\n\"Nor are these the only points in which our city is worthy of\nadmiration. We cultivate refinement without extravagance and knowledge\nwithout effeminacy; wealth we employ more for use than for show, and\nplace the real disgrace of poverty not in owning to the fact but\nin declining the struggle against it. Our public men have, besides\npolitics, their private affairs to attend to, and our ordinary citizens,\nthough occupied with the pursuits of industry, are still fair judges of\npublic matters; for, unlike any other nation, regarding him who takes no\npart in these duties not as unambitious but as useless, we Athenians\nare able to judge at all events if we cannot originate, and, instead\nof looking on discussion as a stumbling-block in the way of action, we\nthink it an indispensable preliminary to any wise action at all. Again,\nin our enterprises we present the singular spectacle of daring and\ndeliberation, each carried to its highest point, and both united in\nthe same persons; although usually decision is the fruit of ignorance,\nhesitation of reflection. But the palm of courage will surely be\nadjudged most justly to those, who best know the difference between\nhardship and pleasure and yet are never tempted to shrink from danger.\nIn generosity we are equally singular, acquiring our friends by\nconferring, not by receiving, favours. Yet, of course, the doer of the\nfavour is the firmer friend of the two, in order by continued kindness\nto keep the recipient in his debt; while the debtor feels less keenly\nfrom the very consciousness that the return he makes will be a payment,\nnot a free gift. And it is only the Athenians, who, fearless of\nconsequences, confer their benefits not from calculations of expediency,\nbut in the confidence of liberality.\n\n\"In short, I say that as a city we are the school of Hellas, while I\ndoubt if the world can produce a man who, where he has only himself to\ndepend upon, is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so happy a\nversatility, as the Athenian. And that this is no mere boast thrown\nout for the occasion, but plain matter of fact, the power of the state\nacquired by these habits proves. For Athens alone of her contemporaries\nis found when tested to be greater than her reputation, and alone gives\nno occasion to her assailants to blush at the antagonist by whom they\nhave been worsted, or to her subjects to question her title by merit to\nrule. Rather, the admiration of the present and succeeding ages will be\nours, since we have not left our power without witness, but have shown\nit by mighty proofs; and far from needing a Homer for our panegyrist, or\nother of his craft whose verses might charm for the moment only for the\nimpression which they gave to melt at the touch of fact, we have forced\nevery sea and land to be the highway of our daring, and everywhere,\nwhether for evil or for good, have left imperishable monuments behind\nus. Such is the Athens for which these men, in the assertion of their\nresolve not to lose her, nobly fought and died; and well may every one\nof their survivors be ready to suffer in her cause.\n\n\"Indeed if I have dwelt at some length upon the character of our\ncountry, it has been to show that our stake in the struggle is not the\nsame as theirs who have no such blessings to lose, and also that the\npanegyric of the men over whom I am now speaking might be by definite\nproofs established. That panegyric is now in a great measure complete;\nfor the Athens that I have celebrated is only what the heroism of\nthese and their like have made her, men whose fame, unlike that of most\nHellenes, will be found to be only commensurate with their deserts. And\nif a test of worth be wanted, it is to be found in their closing scene,\nand this not only in cases in which it set the final seal upon their\nmerit, but also in those in which it gave the first intimation of their\nhaving any. For there is justice in the claim that steadfastness in\nhis country's battles should be as a cloak to cover a man's other\nimperfections; since the good action has blotted out the bad, and his\nmerit as a citizen more than outweighed his demerits as an individual.\nBut none of these allowed either wealth with its prospect of future\nenjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its hope of a day of\nfreedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from danger. No, holding that\nvengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal\nblessings, and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they\njoyfully determined to accept the risk, to make sure of their vengeance,\nand to let their wishes wait; and while committing to hope the\nuncertainty of final success, in the business before them they thought\nfit to act boldly and trust in themselves. Thus choosing to die\nresisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from\ndishonour, but met danger face to face, and after one brief moment,\nwhile at the summit of their fortune, escaped, not from their fear, but\nfrom their glory.\n\n\"So died these men as became Athenians. You, their survivors, must\ndetermine to have as unfaltering a resolution in the field, though you\nmay pray that it may have a happier issue. And not contented with ideas\nderived only from words of the advantages which are bound up with the\ndefence of your country, though these would furnish a valuable text to\na speaker even before an audience so alive to them as the present, you\nmust yourselves realize the power of Athens, and feed your eyes upon her\nfrom day to day, till love of her fills your hearts; and then, when\nall her greatness shall break upon you, you must reflect that it was by\ncourage, sense of duty, and a keen feeling of honour in action that\nmen were enabled to win all this, and that no personal failure in an\nenterprise could make them consent to deprive their country of their\nvalour, but they laid it at her feet as the most glorious contribution\nthat they could offer. For this offering of their lives made in common\nby them all they each of them individually received that renown which\nnever grows old, and for a sepulchre, not so much that in which their\nbones have been deposited, but that noblest of shrines wherein their\nglory is laid up to be eternally remembered upon every occasion on which\ndeed or story shall call for its commemoration. For heroes have the\nwhole earth for their tomb; and in lands far from their own, where the\ncolumn with its epitaph declares it, there is enshrined in every breast\na record unwritten with no tablet to preserve it, except that of the\nheart. These take as your model and, judging happiness to be the fruit\nof freedom and freedom of valour, never decline the dangers of war. For\nit is not the miserable that would most justly be unsparing of their\nlives; these have nothing to hope for: it is rather they to whom\ncontinued life may bring reverses as yet unknown, and to whom a fall, if\nit came, would be most tremendous in its consequences. And surely, to\na man of spirit, the degradation of cowardice must be immeasurably more\ngrievous than the unfelt death which strikes him in the midst of his\nstrength and patriotism!\n\n\"Comfort, therefore, not condolence, is what I have to offer to the\nparents of the dead who may be here. Numberless are the chances to\nwhich, as they know, the life of man is subject; but fortunate indeed\nare they who draw for their lot a death so glorious as that which has\ncaused your mourning, and to whom life has been so exactly measured as\nto terminate in the happiness in which it has been passed. Still I know\nthat this is a hard saying, especially when those are in question of\nwhom you will constantly be reminded by seeing in the homes of others\nblessings of which once you also boasted: for grief is felt not so much\nfor the want of what we have never known, as for the loss of that to\nwhich we have been long accustomed. Yet you who are still of an age to\nbeget children must bear up in the hope of having others in their stead;\nnot only will they help you to forget those whom you have lost, but will\nbe to the state at once a reinforcement and a security; for never can\na fair or just policy be expected of the citizen who does not, like\nhis fellows, bring to the decision the interests and apprehensions of a\nfather. While those of you who have passed your prime must congratulate\nyourselves with the thought that the best part of your life was\nfortunate, and that the brief span that remains will be cheered by the\nfame of the departed. For it is only the love of honour that never grows\nold; and honour it is, not gain, as some would have it, that rejoices\nthe heart of age and helplessness.\n\n\"Turning to the sons or brothers of the dead, I see an arduous struggle\nbefore you. When a man is gone, all are wont to praise him, and should\nyour merit be ever so transcendent, you will still find it difficult not\nmerely to overtake, but even to approach their renown. The living have\nenvy to contend with, while those who are no longer in our path are\nhonoured with a goodwill into which rivalry does not enter. On the other\nhand, if I must say anything on the subject of female excellence to\nthose of you who will now be in widowhood, it will be all comprised in\nthis brief exhortation. Great will be your glory in not falling short of\nyour natural character; and greatest will be hers who is least talked of\namong the men, whether for good or for bad.\n\n\"My task is now finished. I have performed it to the best of my ability,\nand in word, at least, the requirements of the law are now satisfied. If\ndeeds be in question, those who are here interred have received part of\ntheir honours already, and for the rest, their children will be brought\nup till manhood at the public expense: the state thus offers a valuable\nprize, as the garland of victory in this race of valour, for the reward\nboth of those who have fallen and their survivors. And where the rewards\nfor merit are greatest, there are found the best citizens.\n\n\"And now that you have brought to a close your lamentations for your\nrelatives, you may depart.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_Second Year of the War--The Plague of Athens--Position and Policy of\nPericles--Fall of Potidaea_\n\nSuch was the funeral that took place during this winter, with which the\nfirst year of the war came to an end. In the first days of summer the\nLacedaemonians and their allies, with two-thirds of their forces\nas before, invaded Attica, under the command of Archidamus, son of\nZeuxidamus, King of Lacedaemon, and sat down and laid waste the country.\nNot many days after their arrival in Attica the plague first began to\nshow itself among the Athenians. It was said that it had broken out in\nmany places previously in the neighbourhood of Lemnos and elsewhere;\nbut a pestilence of such extent and mortality was nowhere remembered.\nNeither were the physicians at first of any service, ignorant as they\nwere of the proper way to treat it, but they died themselves the most\nthickly, as they visited the sick most often; nor did any human art\nsucceed any better. Supplications in the temples, divinations, and so\nforth were found equally futile, till the overwhelming nature of the\ndisaster at last put a stop to them altogether.\n\nIt first began, it is said, in the parts of Ethiopia above Egypt,\nand thence descended into Egypt and Libya and into most of the King's\ncountry. Suddenly falling upon Athens, it first attacked the\npopulation in Piraeus--which was the occasion of their saying that the\nPeloponnesians had poisoned the reservoirs, there being as yet no wells\nthere--and afterwards appeared in the upper city, when the deaths became\nmuch more frequent. All speculation as to its origin and its causes, if\ncauses can be found adequate to produce so great a disturbance, I leave\nto other writers, whether lay or professional; for myself, I shall\nsimply set down its nature, and explain the symptoms by which perhaps\nit may be recognized by the student, if it should ever break out again.\nThis I can the better do, as I had the disease myself, and watched its\noperation in the case of others.\n\nThat year then is admitted to have been otherwise unprecedentedly free\nfrom sickness; and such few cases as occurred all determined in this.\nAs a rule, however, there was no ostensible cause; but people in good\nhealth were all of a sudden attacked by violent heats in the head, and\nredness and inflammation in the eyes, the inward parts, such as the\nthroat or tongue, becoming bloody and emitting an unnatural and fetid\nbreath. These symptoms were followed by sneezing and hoarseness, after\nwhich the pain soon reached the chest, and produced a hard cough. When\nit fixed in the stomach, it upset it; and discharges of bile of every\nkind named by physicians ensued, accompanied by very great distress.\nIn most cases also an ineffectual retching followed, producing violent\nspasms, which in some cases ceased soon after, in others much later.\nExternally the body was not very hot to the touch, nor pale in its\nappearance, but reddish, livid, and breaking out into small pustules and\nulcers. But internally it burned so that the patient could not bear to\nhave on him clothing or linen even of the very lightest description; or\nindeed to be otherwise than stark naked. What they would have liked best\nwould have been to throw themselves into cold water; as indeed was done\nby some of the neglected sick, who plunged into the rain-tanks in their\nagonies of unquenchable thirst; though it made no difference whether\nthey drank little or much. Besides this, the miserable feeling of not\nbeing able to rest or sleep never ceased to torment them. The body\nmeanwhile did not waste away so long as the distemper was at its\nheight, but held out to a marvel against its ravages; so that when\nthey succumbed, as in most cases, on the seventh or eighth day to the\ninternal inflammation, they had still some strength in them. But if they\npassed this stage, and the disease descended further into the bowels,\ninducing a violent ulceration there accompanied by severe diarrhoea,\nthis brought on a weakness which was generally fatal. For the disorder\nfirst settled in the head, ran its course from thence through the whole\nof the body, and, even where it did not prove mortal, it still left its\nmark on the extremities; for it settled in the privy parts, the fingers\nand the toes, and many escaped with the loss of these, some too with\nthat of their eyes. Others again were seized with an entire loss of\nmemory on their first recovery, and did not know either themselves or\ntheir friends.\n\nBut while the nature of the distemper was such as to baffle all\ndescription, and its attacks almost too grievous for human nature to\nendure, it was still in the following circumstance that its difference\nfrom all ordinary disorders was most clearly shown. All the birds and\nbeasts that prey upon human bodies, either abstained from touching them\n(though there were many lying unburied), or died after tasting them.\nIn proof of this, it was noticed that birds of this kind actually\ndisappeared; they were not about the bodies, or indeed to be seen at\nall. But of course the effects which I have mentioned could best be\nstudied in a domestic animal like the dog.\n\nSuch then, if we pass over the varieties of particular cases which were\nmany and peculiar, were the general features of the distemper. Meanwhile\nthe town enjoyed an immunity from all the ordinary disorders; or if any\ncase occurred, it ended in this. Some died in neglect, others in the\nmidst of every attention. No remedy was found that could be used as a\nspecific; for what did good in one case, did harm in another. Strong\nand weak constitutions proved equally incapable of resistance, all alike\nbeing swept away, although dieted with the utmost precaution. By far the\nmost terrible feature in the malady was the dejection which ensued\nwhen any one felt himself sickening, for the despair into which they\ninstantly fell took away their power of resistance, and left them a\nmuch easier prey to the disorder; besides which, there was the awful\nspectacle of men dying like sheep, through having caught the infection\nin nursing each other. This caused the greatest mortality. On the\none hand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished from\nneglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of\na nurse: on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the\nconsequence. This was especially the case with such as made any\npretensions to goodness: honour made them unsparing of themselves in\ntheir attendance in their friends' houses, where even the members of the\nfamily were at last worn out by the moans of the dying, and succumbed to\nthe force of the disaster. Yet it was with those who had recovered from\nthe disease that the sick and the dying found most compassion. These\nknew what it was from experience, and had now no fear for themselves;\nfor the same man was never attacked twice--never at least fatally.\nAnd such persons not only received the congratulations of others, but\nthemselves also, in the elation of the moment, half entertained the vain\nhope that they were for the future safe from any disease whatsoever.\n\nAn aggravation of the existing calamity was the influx from the country\ninto the city, and this was especially felt by the new arrivals. As\nthere were no houses to receive them, they had to be lodged at the hot\nseason of the year in stifling cabins, where the mortality raged without\nrestraint. The bodies of dying men lay one upon another, and half-dead\ncreatures reeled about the streets and gathered round all the fountains\nin their longing for water. The sacred places also in which they had\nquartered themselves were full of corpses of persons that had died\nthere, just as they were; for as the disaster passed all bounds, men,\nnot knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of\neverything, whether sacred or profane. All the burial rites before in\nuse were entirely upset, and they buried the bodies as best they could.\nMany from want of the proper appliances, through so many of their\nfriends having died already, had recourse to the most shameless\nsepultures: sometimes getting the start of those who had raised a pile,\nthey threw their own dead body upon the stranger's pyre and ignited it;\nsometimes they tossed the corpse which they were carrying on the top of\nanother that was burning, and so went off.\n\nNor was this the only form of lawless extravagance which owed its origin\nto the plague. Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly done\nin a corner, and not just as they pleased, seeing the rapid transitions\nproduced by persons in prosperity suddenly dying and those who before\nhad nothing succeeding to their property. So they resolved to spend\nquickly and enjoy themselves, regarding their lives and riches as alike\nthings of a day. Perseverance in what men called honour was popular with\nnone, it was so uncertain whether they would be spared to attain\nthe object; but it was settled that present enjoyment, and all that\ncontributed to it, was both honourable and useful. Fear of gods or law\nof man there was none to restrain them. As for the first, they judged it\nto be just the same whether they worshipped them or not, as they saw all\nalike perishing; and for the last, no one expected to live to be brought\nto trial for his offences, but each felt that a far severer sentence had\nbeen already passed upon them all and hung ever over their heads, and\nbefore this fell it was only reasonable to enjoy life a little.\n\nSuch was the nature of the calamity, and heavily did it weigh on the\nAthenians; death raging within the city and devastation without.\nAmong other things which they remembered in their distress was, very\nnaturally, the following verse which the old men said had long ago been\nuttered:\n\n   A Dorian war shall come and with it death.\n\nSo a dispute arose as to whether dearth and not death had not been the\nword in the verse; but at the present juncture, it was of course decided\nin favour of the latter; for the people made their recollection fit\nin with their sufferings. I fancy, however, that if another Dorian\nwar should ever afterwards come upon us, and a dearth should happen to\naccompany it, the verse will probably be read accordingly. The oracle\nalso which had been given to the Lacedaemonians was now remembered by\nthose who knew of it. When the god was asked whether they should go to\nwar, he answered that if they put their might into it, victory would be\ntheirs, and that he would himself be with them. With this oracle\nevents were supposed to tally. For the plague broke out as soon as the\nPeloponnesians invaded Attica, and never entering Peloponnese (not\nat least to an extent worth noticing), committed its worst ravages at\nAthens, and next to Athens, at the most populous of the other towns.\nSuch was the history of the plague.\n\nAfter ravaging the plain, the Peloponnesians advanced into the Paralian\nregion as far as Laurium, where the Athenian silver mines are, and first\nlaid waste the side looking towards Peloponnese, next that which faces\nEuboea and Andros. But Pericles, who was still general, held the same\nopinion as in the former invasion, and would not let the Athenians march\nout against them.\n\nHowever, while they were still in the plain, and had not yet entered\nthe Paralian land, he had prepared an armament of a hundred ships for\nPeloponnese, and when all was ready put out to sea. On board the ships\nhe took four thousand Athenian heavy infantry, and three hundred\ncavalry in horse transports, and then for the first time made out of old\ngalleys; fifty Chian and Lesbian vessels also joining in the expedition.\nWhen this Athenian armament put out to sea, they left the Peloponnesians\nin Attica in the Paralian region. Arriving at Epidaurus in Peloponnese\nthey ravaged most of the territory, and even had hopes of taking the\ntown by an assault: in this however they were not successful. Putting\nout from Epidaurus, they laid waste the territory of Troezen, Halieis,\nand Hermione, all towns on the coast of Peloponnese, and thence sailing\nto Prasiai, a maritime town in Laconia, ravaged part of its territory,\nand took and sacked the place itself; after which they returned home,\nbut found the Peloponnesians gone and no longer in Attica.\n\nDuring the whole time that the Peloponnesians were in Attica and the\nAthenians on the expedition in their ships, men kept dying of the plague\nboth in the armament and in Athens. Indeed it was actually asserted\nthat the departure of the Peloponnesians was hastened by fear of the\ndisorder; as they heard from deserters that it was in the city, and\nalso could see the burials going on. Yet in this invasion they remained\nlonger than in any other, and ravaged the whole country, for they were\nabout forty days in Attica.\n\nThe same summer Hagnon, son of Nicias, and Cleopompus, son of Clinias,\nthe colleagues of Pericles, took the armament of which he had lately\nmade use, and went off upon an expedition against the Chalcidians in the\ndirection of Thrace and Potidaea, which was still under siege. As soon\nas they arrived, they brought up their engines against Potidaea and\ntried every means of taking it, but did not succeed either in capturing\nthe city or in doing anything else worthy of their preparations. For the\nplague attacked them here also, and committed such havoc as to cripple\nthem completely, even the previously healthy soldiers of the former\nexpedition catching the infection from Hagnon's troops; while Phormio\nand the sixteen hundred men whom he commanded only escaped by being no\nlonger in the neighbourhood of the Chalcidians. The end of it was that\nHagnon returned with his ships to Athens, having lost one thousand and\nfifty out of four thousand heavy infantry in about forty days; though\nthe soldiers stationed there before remained in the country and carried\non the siege of Potidaea.\n\nAfter the second invasion of the Peloponnesians a change came over the\nspirit of the Athenians. Their land had now been twice laid waste; and\nwar and pestilence at once pressed heavy upon them. They began to find\nfault with Pericles, as the author of the war and the cause of all their\nmisfortunes, and became eager to come to terms with Lacedaemon, and\nactually sent ambassadors thither, who did not however succeed in their\nmission. Their despair was now complete and all vented itself upon\nPericles. When he saw them exasperated at the present turn of affairs\nand acting exactly as he had anticipated, he called an assembly,\nbeing (it must be remembered) still general, with the double object of\nrestoring confidence and of leading them from these angry feelings to a\ncalmer and more hopeful state of mind. He accordingly came forward and\nspoke as follows:\n\n\"I was not unprepared for the indignation of which I have been the\nobject, as I know its causes; and I have called an assembly for the\npurpose of reminding you upon certain points, and of protesting against\nyour being unreasonably irritated with me, or cowed by your sufferings.\nI am of opinion that national greatness is more for the advantage of\nprivate citizens, than any individual well-being coupled with public\nhumiliation. A man may be personally ever so well off, and yet if his\ncountry be ruined he must be ruined with it; whereas a flourishing\ncommonwealth always affords chances of salvation to unfortunate\nindividuals. Since then a state can support the misfortunes of private\ncitizens, while they cannot support hers, it is surely the duty of every\none to be forward in her defence, and not like you to be so confounded\nwith your domestic afflictions as to give up all thoughts of the common\nsafety, and to blame me for having counselled war and yourselves for\nhaving voted it. And yet if you are angry with me, it is with one who,\nas I believe, is second to no man either in knowledge of the proper\npolicy, or in the ability to expound it, and who is moreover not only a\npatriot but an honest one. A man possessing that knowledge without that\nfaculty of exposition might as well have no idea at all on the matter:\nif he had both these gifts, but no love for his country, he would be but\na cold advocate for her interests; while were his patriotism not proof\nagainst bribery, everything would go for a price. So that if you thought\nthat I was even moderately distinguished for these qualities when you\ntook my advice and went to war, there is certainly no reason now why I\nshould be charged with having done wrong.\n\n\"For those of course who have a free choice in the matter and whose\nfortunes are not at stake, war is the greatest of follies. But if the\nonly choice was between submission with loss of independence, and danger\nwith the hope of preserving that independence, in such a case it is he\nwho will not accept the risk that deserves blame, not he who will. I am\nthe same man and do not alter, it is you who change, since in fact you\ntook my advice while unhurt, and waited for misfortune to repent of\nit; and the apparent error of my policy lies in the infirmity of your\nresolution, since the suffering that it entails is being felt by every\none among you, while its advantage is still remote and obscure to all,\nand a great and sudden reverse having befallen you, your mind is too\nmuch depressed to persevere in your resolves. For before what is sudden,\nunexpected, and least within calculation, the spirit quails; and putting\nall else aside, the plague has certainly been an emergency of this kind.\nBorn, however, as you are, citizens of a great state, and brought up, as\nyou have been, with habits equal to your birth, you should be ready to\nface the greatest disasters and still to keep unimpaired the lustre of\nyour name. For the judgment of mankind is as relentless to the weakness\nthat falls short of a recognized renown, as it is jealous of the\narrogance that aspires higher than its due. Cease then to grieve for\nyour private afflictions, and address yourselves instead to the safety\nof the commonwealth.\n\n\"If you shrink before the exertions which the war makes necessary,\nand fear that after all they may not have a happy result, you know the\nreasons by which I have often demonstrated to you the groundlessness\nof your apprehensions. If those are not enough, I will now reveal an\nadvantage arising from the greatness of your dominion, which I think\nhas never yet suggested itself to you, which I never mentioned in my\nprevious speeches, and which has so bold a sound that I should scarce\nadventure it now, were it not for the unnatural depression which I see\naround me. You perhaps think that your empire extends only over your\nallies; I will declare to you the truth. The visible field of action has\ntwo parts, land and sea. In the whole of one of these you are completely\nsupreme, not merely as far as you use it at present, but also to what\nfurther extent you may think fit: in fine, your naval resources are\nsuch that your vessels may go where they please, without the King or any\nother nation on earth being able to stop them. So that although you\nmay think it a great privation to lose the use of your land and houses,\nstill you must see that this power is something widely different; and\ninstead of fretting on their account, you should really regard them in\nthe light of the gardens and other accessories that embellish a great\nfortune, and as, in comparison, of little moment. You should know too\nthat liberty preserved by your efforts will easily recover for us what\nwe have lost, while, the knee once bowed, even what you have will pass\nfrom you. Your fathers receiving these possessions not from others, but\nfrom themselves, did not let slip what their labour had acquired, but\ndelivered them safe to you; and in this respect at least you must prove\nyourselves their equals, remembering that to lose what one has got is\nmore disgraceful than to be balked in getting, and you must confront\nyour enemies not merely with spirit but with disdain. Confidence indeed\na blissful ignorance can impart, ay, even to a coward's breast, but\ndisdain is the privilege of those who, like us, have been assured\nby reflection of their superiority to their adversary. And where the\nchances are the same, knowledge fortifies courage by the contempt which\nis its consequence, its trust being placed, not in hope, which is\nthe prop of the desperate, but in a judgment grounded upon existing\nresources, whose anticipations are more to be depended upon.\n\n\"Again, your country has a right to your services in sustaining the\nglories of her position. These are a common source of pride to you all,\nand you cannot decline the burdens of empire and still expect to share\nits honours. You should remember also that what you are fighting against\nis not merely slavery as an exchange for independence, but also loss\nof empire and danger from the animosities incurred in its exercise.\nBesides, to recede is no longer possible, if indeed any of you in the\nalarm of the moment has become enamoured of the honesty of such an\nunambitious part. For what you hold is, to speak somewhat plainly, a\ntyranny; to take it perhaps was wrong, but to let it go is unsafe. And\nmen of these retiring views, making converts of others, would quickly\nruin a state; indeed the result would be the same if they could live\nindependent by themselves; for the retiring and unambitious are\nnever secure without vigorous protectors at their side; in fine, such\nqualities are useless to an imperial city, though they may help a\ndependency to an unmolested servitude.\n\n\"But you must not be seduced by citizens like these or angry with\nme--who, if I voted for war, only did as you did yourselves--in spite of\nthe enemy having invaded your country and done what you could be\ncertain that he would do, if you refused to comply with his demands; and\nalthough besides what we counted for, the plague has come upon us--the\nonly point indeed at which our calculation has been at fault. It is\nthis, I know, that has had a large share in making me more unpopular\nthan I should otherwise have been--quite undeservedly, unless you are\nalso prepared to give me the credit of any success with which chance may\npresent you. Besides, the hand of heaven must be borne with resignation,\nthat of the enemy with fortitude; this was the old way at Athens, and do\nnot you prevent it being so still. Remember, too, that if your country\nhas the greatest name in all the world, it is because she never bent\nbefore disaster; because she has expended more life and effort in war\nthan any other city, and has won for herself a power greater than\nany hitherto known, the memory of which will descend to the latest\nposterity; even if now, in obedience to the general law of decay, we\nshould ever be forced to yield, still it will be remembered that we held\nrule over more Hellenes than any other Hellenic state, that we sustained\nthe greatest wars against their united or separate powers, and inhabited\na city unrivalled by any other in resources or magnitude. These glories\nmay incur the censure of the slow and unambitious; but in the breast of\nenergy they will awake emulation, and in those who must remain without\nthem an envious regret. Hatred and unpopularity at the moment have\nfallen to the lot of all who have aspired to rule others; but where\nodium must be incurred, true wisdom incurs it for the highest objects.\nHatred also is short-lived; but that which makes the splendour of the\npresent and the glory of the future remains for ever unforgotten. Make\nyour decision, therefore, for glory then and honour now, and attain\nboth objects by instant and zealous effort: do not send heralds to\nLacedaemon, and do not betray any sign of being oppressed by your\npresent sufferings, since they whose minds are least sensitive to\ncalamity, and whose hands are most quick to meet it, are the greatest\nmen and the greatest communities.\"\n\nSuch were the arguments by which Pericles tried to cure the Athenians\nof their anger against him and to divert their thoughts from their\nimmediate afflictions. As a community he succeeded in convincing them;\nthey not only gave up all idea of sending to Lacedaemon, but applied\nthemselves with increased energy to the war; still as private\nindividuals they could not help smarting under their sufferings,\nthe common people having been deprived of the little that they were\npossessed, while the higher orders had lost fine properties with costly\nestablishments and buildings in the country, and, worst of all, had\nwar instead of peace. In fact, the public feeling against him did not\nsubside until he had been fined. Not long afterwards, however, according\nto the way of the multitude, they again elected him general and\ncommitted all their affairs to his hands, having now become less\nsensitive to their private and domestic afflictions, and understanding\nthat he was the best man of all for the public necessities. For as\nlong as he was at the head of the state during the peace, he pursued a\nmoderate and conservative policy; and in his time its greatness was at\nits height. When the war broke out, here also he seems to have rightly\ngauged the power of his country. He outlived its commencement two years\nand six months, and the correctness of his previsions respecting it\nbecame better known by his death. He told them to wait quietly, to pay\nattention to their marine, to attempt no new conquests, and to expose\nthe city to no hazards during the war, and doing this, promised them a\nfavourable result. What they did was the very contrary, allowing private\nambitions and private interests, in matters apparently quite foreign\nto the war, to lead them into projects unjust both to themselves and to\ntheir allies--projects whose success would only conduce to the honour\nand advantage of private persons, and whose failure entailed certain\ndisaster on the country in the war. The causes of this are not far to\nseek. Pericles indeed, by his rank, ability, and known integrity, was\nenabled to exercise an independent control over the multitude--in short,\nto lead them instead of being led by them; for as he never sought power\nby improper means, he was never compelled to flatter them, but, on the\ncontrary, enjoyed so high an estimation that he could afford to anger\nthem by contradiction. Whenever he saw them unseasonably and insolently\nelated, he would with a word reduce them to alarm; on the other hand,\nif they fell victims to a panic, he could at once restore them to\nconfidence. In short, what was nominally a democracy became in his hands\ngovernment by the first citizen. With his successors it was different.\nMore on a level with one another, and each grasping at supremacy, they\nended by committing even the conduct of state affairs to the whims\nof the multitude. This, as might have been expected in a great and\nsovereign state, produced a host of blunders, and amongst them\nthe Sicilian expedition; though this failed not so much through a\nmiscalculation of the power of those against whom it was sent,\nas through a fault in the senders in not taking the best measures\nafterwards to assist those who had gone out, but choosing rather to\noccupy themselves with private cabals for the leadership of the commons,\nby which they not only paralysed operations in the field, but also first\nintroduced civil discord at home. Yet after losing most of their fleet\nbesides other forces in Sicily, and with faction already dominant in the\ncity, they could still for three years make head against their original\nadversaries, joined not only by the Sicilians, but also by their own\nallies nearly all in revolt, and at last by the King's son, Cyrus, who\nfurnished the funds for the Peloponnesian navy. Nor did they finally\nsuccumb till they fell the victims of their own intestine disorders.\nSo superfluously abundant were the resources from which the genius of\nPericles foresaw an easy triumph in the war over the unaided forces of\nthe Peloponnesians.\n\nDuring the same summer the Lacedaemonians and their allies made an\nexpedition with a hundred ships against Zacynthus, an island lying off\nthe coast of Elis, peopled by a colony of Achaeans from Peloponnese,\nand in alliance with Athens. There were a thousand Lacedaemonian heavy\ninfantry on board, and Cnemus, a Spartan, as admiral. They made a\ndescent from their ships, and ravaged most of the country; but as the\ninhabitants would not submit, they sailed back home.\n\nAt the end of the same summer the Corinthian Aristeus, Aneristus,\nNicolaus, and Stratodemus, envoys from Lacedaemon, Timagoras, a Tegean,\nand a private individual named Pollis from Argos, on their way to\nAsia to persuade the King to supply funds and join in the war, came\nto Sitalces, son of Teres in Thrace, with the idea of inducing him, if\npossible, to forsake the alliance of Athens and to march on Potidaea\nthen besieged by an Athenian force, and also of getting conveyed by his\nmeans to their destination across the Hellespont to Pharnabazus, who was\nto send them up the country to the King. But there chanced to be with\nSitalces some Athenian ambassadors--Learchus, son of Callimachus, and\nAmeiniades, son of Philemon--who persuaded Sitalces' son, Sadocus, the\nnew Athenian citizen, to put the men into their hands and thus prevent\ntheir crossing over to the King and doing their part to injure the\ncountry of his choice. He accordingly had them seized, as they were\ntravelling through Thrace to the vessel in which they were to cross the\nHellespont, by a party whom he had sent on with Learchus and Ameiniades,\nand gave orders for their delivery to the Athenian ambassadors, by whom\nthey were brought to Athens. On their arrival, the Athenians, afraid\nthat Aristeus, who had been notably the prime mover in the previous\naffairs of Potidaea and their Thracian possessions, might live to do\nthem still more mischief if he escaped, slew them all the same day,\nwithout giving them a trial or hearing the defence which they wished to\noffer, and cast their bodies into a pit; thinking themselves\njustified in using in retaliation the same mode of warfare which the\nLacedaemonians had begun, when they slew and cast into pits all the\nAthenian and allied traders whom they caught on board the merchantmen\nround Peloponnese. Indeed, at the outset of the war, the Lacedaemonians\nbutchered as enemies all whom they took on the sea, whether allies of\nAthens or neutrals.\n\nAbout the same time towards the close of the summer, the Ambraciot\nforces, with a number of barbarians that they had raised, marched\nagainst the Amphilochian Argos and the rest of that country. The origin\nof their enmity against the Argives was this. This Argos and the rest\nof Amphilochia were colonized by Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus.\nDissatisfied with the state of affairs at home on his return thither\nafter the Trojan War, he built this city in the Ambracian Gulf, and\nnamed it Argos after his own country. This was the largest town in\nAmphilochia, and its inhabitants the most powerful. Under the\npressure of misfortune many generations afterwards, they called in the\nAmbraciots, their neighbours on the Amphilochian border, to join their\ncolony; and it was by this union with the Ambraciots that they learnt\ntheir present Hellenic speech, the rest of the Amphilochians being\nbarbarians. After a time the Ambraciots expelled the Argives and held\nthe city themselves. Upon this the Amphilochians gave themselves over\nto the Acarnanians; and the two together called the Athenians, who sent\nthem Phormio as general and thirty ships; upon whose arrival they took\nArgos by storm, and made slaves of the Ambraciots; and the Amphilochians\nand Acarnanians inhabited the town in common. After this began the\nalliance between the Athenians and Acarnanians. The enmity of the\nAmbraciots against the Argives thus commenced with the enslavement\nof their citizens; and afterwards during the war they collected\nthis armament among themselves and the Chaonians, and other of the\nneighbouring barbarians. Arrived before Argos, they became masters of\nthe country; but not being successful in their attacks upon the town,\nreturned home and dispersed among their different peoples.\n\nSuch were the events of the summer. The ensuing winter the Athenians\nsent twenty ships round Peloponnese, under the command of Phormio, who\nstationed himself at Naupactus and kept watch against any one sailing in\nor out of Corinth and the Crissaean Gulf. Six others went to Caria and\nLycia under Melesander, to collect tribute in those parts, and also to\nprevent the Peloponnesian privateers from taking up their station in\nthose waters and molesting the passage of the merchantmen from Phaselis\nand Phoenicia and the adjoining continent. However, Melesander, going up\nthe country into Lycia with a force of Athenians from the ships and the\nallies, was defeated and killed in battle, with the loss of a number of\nhis troops.\n\nThe same winter the Potidaeans at length found themselves no longer able\nto hold out against their besiegers. The inroads of the Peloponnesians\ninto Attica had not had the desired effect of making the Athenians raise\nthe siege. Provisions there were none left; and so far had distress for\nfood gone in Potidaea that, besides a number of other horrors, instances\nhad even occurred of the people having eaten one another. In this\nextremity they at last made proposals for capitulating to the\nAthenian generals in command against them--Xenophon, son of Euripides,\nHestiodorus, son of Aristocleides, and Phanomachus, son of Callimachus.\nThe generals accepted their proposals, seeing the sufferings of the army\nin so exposed a position; besides which the state had already spent two\nthousand talents upon the siege. The terms of the capitulation were as\nfollows: a free passage out for themselves, their children, wives and\nauxiliaries, with one garment apiece, the women with two, and a fixed\nsum of money for their journey. Under this treaty they went out\nto Chalcidice and other places, according as was their power. The\nAthenians, however, blamed the generals for granting terms without\ninstructions from home, being of opinion that the place would have had\nto surrender at discretion. They afterwards sent settlers of their own\nto Potidaea, and colonized it. Such were the events of the winter,\nand so ended the second year of this war of which Thucydides was the\nhistorian.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_Third Year of the War--Investment of Plataea--Naval Victories of\nPhormio--Thracian Irruption into Macedonia under Sitalces_\n\nThe next summer the Peloponnesians and their allies, instead of invading\nAttica, marched against Plataea, under the command of Archidamus, son of\nZeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians. He had encamped his army and\nwas about to lay waste the country, when the Plataeans hastened to send\nenvoys to him, and spoke as follows: \"Archidamus and Lacedaemonians,\nin invading the Plataean territory, you do what is wrong in itself,\nand worthy neither of yourselves nor of the fathers who begot you.\nPausanias, son of Cleombrotus, your countryman, after freeing Hellas\nfrom the Medes with the help of those Hellenes who were willing to\nundertake the risk of the battle fought near our city, offered sacrifice\nto Zeus the Liberator in the marketplace of Plataea, and calling all the\nallies together restored to the Plataeans their city and territory, and\ndeclared it independent and inviolate against aggression or conquest.\nShould any such be attempted, the allies present were to help according\nto their power. Your fathers rewarded us thus for the courage and\npatriotism that we displayed at that perilous epoch; but you do just the\ncontrary, coming with our bitterest enemies, the Thebans, to enslave us.\nWe appeal, therefore, to the gods to whom the oaths were then made, to\nthe gods of your ancestors, and lastly to those of our country, and call\nupon you to refrain from violating our territory or transgressing the\noaths, and to let us live independent, as Pausanias decreed.\"\n\nThe Plataeans had got thus far when they were cut short by Archidamus\nsaying: \"There is justice, Plataeans, in what you say, if you act up\nto your words. According, to the grant of Pausanias, continue to\nbe independent yourselves, and join in freeing those of your fellow\ncountrymen who, after sharing in the perils of that period, joined in\nthe oaths to you, and are now subject to the Athenians; for it is to\nfree them and the rest that all this provision and war has been made.\nI could wish that you would share our labours and abide by the oaths\nyourselves; if this is impossible, do what we have already required of\nyou--remain neutral, enjoying your own; join neither side, but receive\nboth as friends, neither as allies for the war. With this we shall be\nsatisfied.\" Such were the words of Archidamus. The Plataeans, after\nhearing what he had to say, went into the city and acquainted the people\nwith what had passed, and presently returned for answer that it was\nimpossible for them to do what he proposed without consulting the\nAthenians, with whom their children and wives now were; besides which\nthey had their fears for the town. After his departure, what was to\nprevent the Athenians from coming and taking it out of their hands, or\nthe Thebans, who would be included in the oaths, from taking advantage\nof the proposed neutrality to make a second attempt to seize the city?\nUpon these points he tried to reassure them by saying: \"You have only to\ndeliver over the city and houses to us Lacedaemonians, to point out the\nboundaries of your land, the number of your fruit-trees, and whatever\nelse can be numerically stated, and yourselves to withdraw wherever you\nlike as long as the war shall last. When it is over we will restore to\nyou whatever we received, and in the interim hold it in trust and keep\nit in cultivation, paying you a sufficient allowance.\"\n\nWhen they had heard what he had to say, they re-entered the city, and\nafter consulting with the people said that they wished first to acquaint\nthe Athenians with this proposal, and in the event of their approving to\naccede to it; in the meantime they asked him to grant them a truce and\nnot to lay waste their territory. He accordingly granted a truce for the\nnumber of days requisite for the journey, and meanwhile abstained\nfrom ravaging their territory. The Plataean envoys went to Athens, and\nconsulted with the Athenians, and returned with the following message\nto those in the city: \"The Athenians say, Plataeans, that they never\nhitherto, since we became their allies, on any occasion abandoned us to\nan enemy, nor will they now neglect us, but will help us according\nto their ability; and they adjure you by the oaths which your fathers\nswore, to keep the alliance unaltered.\"\n\nOn the delivery of this message by the envoys, the Plataeans resolved\nnot to be unfaithful to the Athenians but to endure, if it must be,\nseeing their lands laid waste and any other trials that might come to\nthem, and not to send out again, but to answer from the wall that it was\nimpossible for them to do as the Lacedaemonians proposed. As soon as\nhe had received this answer, King Archidamus proceeded first to make a\nsolemn appeal to the gods and heroes of the country in words following:\n\"Ye gods and heroes of the Plataean territory, be my witnesses that not\nas aggressors originally, nor until these had first departed from the\ncommon oath, did we invade this land, in which our fathers offered you\ntheir prayers before defeating the Medes, and which you made auspicious\nto the Hellenic arms; nor shall we be aggressors in the measures to\nwhich we may now resort, since we have made many fair proposals but have\nnot been successful. Graciously accord that those who were the first\nto offend may be punished for it, and that vengeance may be attained by\nthose who would righteously inflict it.\"\n\nAfter this appeal to the gods Archidamus put his army in motion. First\nhe enclosed the town with a palisade formed of the fruit-trees which\nthey cut down, to prevent further egress from Plataea; next they threw\nup a mound against the city, hoping that the largeness of the\nforce employed would ensure the speedy reduction of the place. They\naccordingly cut down timber from Cithaeron, and built it up on either\nside, laying it like lattice-work to serve as a wall to keep the mound\nfrom spreading abroad, and carried to it wood and stones and earth and\nwhatever other material might help to complete it. They continued to\nwork at the mound for seventy days and nights without intermission,\nbeing divided into relief parties to allow of some being employed in\ncarrying while others took sleep and refreshment; the Lacedaemonian\nofficer attached to each contingent keeping the men to the work. But the\nPlataeans, observing the progress of the mound, constructed a wall of\nwood and fixed it upon that part of the city wall against which the\nmound was being erected, and built up bricks inside it which they took\nfrom the neighbouring houses. The timbers served to bind the building\ntogether, and to prevent its becoming weak as it advanced in height;\nit had also a covering of skins and hides, which protected the woodwork\nagainst the attacks of burning missiles and allowed the men to work\nin safety. Thus the wall was raised to a great height, and the mound\nopposite made no less rapid progress. The Plataeans also thought of\nanother expedient; they pulled out part of the wall upon which the mound\nabutted, and carried the earth into the city.\n\nDiscovering this the Peloponnesians twisted up clay in wattles of reed\nand threw it into the breach formed in the mound, in order to give it\nconsistency and prevent its being carried away like the soil. Stopped\nin this way the Plataeans changed their mode of operation, and digging\na mine from the town calculated their way under the mound, and began to\ncarry off its material as before. This went on for a long while without\nthe enemy outside finding it out, so that for all they threw on the\ntop their mound made no progress in proportion, being carried away from\nbeneath and constantly settling down in the vacuum. But the Plataeans,\nfearing that even thus they might not be able to hold out against the\nsuperior numbers of the enemy, had yet another invention. They stopped\nworking at the large building in front of the mound, and starting at\neither end of it inside from the old low wall, built a new one in the\nform of a crescent running in towards the town; in order that in the\nevent of the great wall being taken this might remain, and the enemy\nhave to throw up a fresh mound against it, and as they advanced within\nmight not only have their trouble over again, but also be exposed to\nmissiles on their flanks. While raising the mound the Peloponnesians\nalso brought up engines against the city, one of which was brought up\nupon the mound against the great building and shook down a good piece of\nit, to the no small alarm of the Plataeans. Others were advanced\nagainst different parts of the wall but were lassoed and broken by the\nPlataeans; who also hung up great beams by long iron chains from either\nextremity of two poles laid on the wall and projecting over it, and drew\nthem up at an angle whenever any point was threatened by the engine,\nand loosing their hold let the beam go with its chains slack, so that it\nfell with a run and snapped off the nose of the battering ram.\n\nAfter this the Peloponnesians, finding that their engines effected\nnothing, and that their mound was met by the counterwork, concluded that\ntheir present means of offence were unequal to the taking of the city,\nand prepared for its circumvallation. First, however, they determined to\ntry the effects of fire and see whether they could not, with the help of\na wind, burn the town, as it was not a large one; indeed they thought of\nevery possible expedient by which the place might be reduced without the\nexpense of a blockade. They accordingly brought faggots of brushwood and\nthrew them from the mound, first into the space between it and the wall;\nand this soon becoming full from the number of hands at work, they next\nheaped the faggots up as far into the town as they could reach from the\ntop, and then lighted the wood by setting fire to it with sulphur and\npitch. The consequence was a fire greater than any one had ever yet seen\nproduced by human agency, though it could not of course be compared to\nthe spontaneous conflagrations sometimes known to occur through the wind\nrubbing the branches of a mountain forest together. And this fire was\nnot only remarkable for its magnitude, but was also, at the end of so\nmany perils, within an ace of proving fatal to the Plataeans; a great\npart of the town became entirely inaccessible, and had a wind blown upon\nit, in accordance with the hopes of the enemy, nothing could have saved\nthem. As it was, there is also a story of heavy rain and thunder having\ncome on by which the fire was put out and the danger averted.\n\nFailing in this last attempt the Peloponnesians left a portion of\ntheir forces on the spot, dismissing the rest, and built a wall of\ncircumvallation round the town, dividing the ground among the various\ncities present; a ditch being made within and without the lines, from\nwhich they got their bricks. All being finished by about the rising\nof Arcturus, they left men enough to man half the wall, the rest being\nmanned by the Boeotians, and drawing off their army dispersed to their\nseveral cities. The Plataeans had before sent off their wives and\nchildren and oldest men and the mass of the non-combatants to Athens; so\nthat the number of the besieged left in the place comprised four hundred\nof their own citizens, eighty Athenians, and a hundred and ten women\nto bake their bread. This was the sum total at the commencement of the\nsiege, and there was no one else within the walls, bond or free. Such\nwere the arrangements made for the blockade of Plataea.\n\nThe same summer and simultaneously with the expedition against Plataea,\nthe Athenians marched with two thousand heavy infantry and two hundred\nhorse against the Chalcidians in the direction of Thrace and the\nBottiaeans, just as the corn was getting ripe, under the command\nof Xenophon, son of Euripides, with two colleagues. Arriving before\nSpartolus in Bottiaea, they destroyed the corn and had some hopes of the\ncity coming over through the intrigues of a faction within. But those\nof a different way of thinking had sent to Olynthus; and a garrison of\nheavy infantry and other troops arrived accordingly. These issuing\nfrom Spartolus were engaged by the Athenians in front of the town: the\nChalcidian heavy infantry, and some auxiliaries with them, were beaten\nand retreated into Spartolus; but the Chalcidian horse and light troops\ndefeated the horse and light troops of the Athenians. The Chalcidians\nhad already a few targeteers from Crusis, and presently after the battle\nwere joined by some others from Olynthus; upon seeing whom the light\ntroops from Spartolus, emboldened by this accession and by their\nprevious success, with the help of the Chalcidian horse and the\nreinforcement just arrived again attacked the Athenians, who retired\nupon the two divisions which they had left with their baggage. Whenever\nthe Athenians advanced, their adversary gave way, pressing them with\nmissiles the instant they began to retire. The Chalcidian horse also,\nriding up and charging them just as they pleased, at last caused a\npanic amongst them and routed and pursued them to a great distance. The\nAthenians took refuge in Potidaea, and afterwards recovered their dead\nunder truce, and returned to Athens with the remnant of their army;\nfour hundred and thirty men and all the generals having fallen. The\nChalcidians and Bottiaeans set up a trophy, took up their dead, and\ndispersed to their several cities.\n\nThe same summer, not long after this, the Ambraciots and Chaonians,\nbeing desirous of reducing the whole of Acarnania and detaching it\nfrom Athens, persuaded the Lacedaemonians to equip a fleet from\ntheir confederacy and send a thousand heavy infantry to Acarnania,\nrepresenting that, if a combined movement were made by land and sea,\nthe coast Acarnanians would be unable to march, and the conquest\nof Zacynthus and Cephallenia easily following on the possession of\nAcarnania, the cruise round Peloponnese would be no longer so convenient\nfor the Athenians. Besides which there was a hope of taking Naupactus.\nThe Lacedaemonians accordingly at once sent off a few vessels with\nCnemus, who was still high admiral, and the heavy infantry on board; and\nsent round orders for the fleet to equip as quickly as possible and sail\nto Leucas. The Corinthians were the most forward in the business; the\nAmbraciots being a colony of theirs. While the ships from Corinth,\nSicyon, and the neighbourhood were getting ready, and those from Leucas,\nAnactorium, and Ambracia, which had arrived before, were waiting for\nthem at Leucas, Cnemus and his thousand heavy infantry had run into the\ngulf, giving the slip to Phormio, the commander of the Athenian squadron\nstationed off Naupactus, and began at once to prepare for the land\nexpedition. The Hellenic troops with him consisted of the Ambraciots,\nLeucadians, and Anactorians, and the thousand Peloponnesians with whom\nhe came; the barbarian of a thousand Chaonians, who, belonging to a\nnation that has no king, were led by Photys and Nicanor, the two members\nof the royal family to whom the chieftainship for that year had been\nconfided. With the Chaonians came also some Thesprotians, like them\nwithout a king, some Molossians and Atintanians led by Sabylinthus, the\nguardian of King Tharyps who was still a minor, and some Paravaeans,\nunder their king Oroedus, accompanied by a thousand Orestians, subjects\nof King Antichus and placed by him under the command of Oroedus. There\nwere also a thousand Macedonians sent by Perdiccas without the knowledge\nof the Athenians, but they arrived too late. With this force Cnemus set\nout, without waiting for the fleet from Corinth. Passing through\nthe territory of Amphilochian Argos, and sacking the open village of\nLimnaea, they advanced to Stratus the Acarnanian capital; this once\ntaken, the rest of the country, they felt convinced, would speedily\nfollow.\n\nThe Acarnanians, finding themselves invaded by a large army by land, and\nfrom the sea threatened by a hostile fleet, made no combined attempt\nat resistance, but remained to defend their homes, and sent for help to\nPhormio, who replied that, when a fleet was on the point of sailing from\nCorinth, it was impossible for him to leave Naupactus unprotected. The\nPeloponnesians meanwhile and their allies advanced upon Stratus in three\ndivisions, with the intention of encamping near it and attempting the\nwall by force if they failed to succeed by negotiation. The order of\nmarch was as follows: the centre was occupied by the Chaonians and the\nrest of the barbarians, with the Leucadians and Anactorians and\ntheir followers on the right, and Cnemus with the Peloponnesians and\nAmbraciots on the left; each division being a long way off from, and\nsometimes even out of sight of, the others. The Hellenes advanced in\ngood order, keeping a look-out till they encamped in a good position;\nbut the Chaonians, filled with self-confidence, and having the highest\ncharacter for courage among the tribes of that part of the continent,\nwithout waiting to occupy their camp, rushed on with the rest of the\nbarbarians, in the idea that they should take the town by assault and\nobtain the sole glory of the enterprise. While they were coming on, the\nStratians, becoming aware how things stood, and thinking that the defeat\nof this division would considerably dishearten the Hellenes behind it,\noccupied the environs of the town with ambuscades, and as soon as\nthey approached engaged them at close quarters from the city and the\nambuscades. A panic seizing the Chaonians, great numbers of them\nwere slain; and as soon as they were seen to give way the rest of the\nbarbarians turned and fled. Owing to the distance by which their allies\nhad preceded them, neither of the Hellenic divisions knew anything of\nthe battle, but fancied they were hastening on to encamp. However, when\nthe flying barbarians broke in upon them, they opened their ranks to\nreceive them, brought their divisions together, and stopped quiet where\nthey were for the day; the Stratians not offering to engage them, as the\nrest of the Acarnanians had not yet arrived, but contenting themselves\nwith slinging at them from a distance, which distressed them greatly, as\nthere was no stirring without their armour. The Acarnanians would seem\nto excel in this mode of warfare.\n\nAs soon as night fell, Cnemus hastily drew off his army to the river\nAnapus, about nine miles from Stratus, recovering his dead next day\nunder truce, and being there joined by the friendly Oeniadae, fell back\nupon their city before the enemy's reinforcements came up. From hence\neach returned home; and the Stratians set up a trophy for the battle\nwith the barbarians.\n\nMeanwhile the fleet from Corinth and the rest of the confederates in the\nCrissaean Gulf, which was to have co-operated with Cnemus and prevented\nthe coast Acarnanians from joining their countrymen in the interior,\nwas disabled from doing so by being compelled about the same time as the\nbattle at Stratus to fight with Phormio and the twenty Athenian vessels\nstationed at Naupactus. For they were watched, as they coasted along out\nof the gulf, by Phormio, who wished to attack in the open sea. But the\nCorinthians and allies had started for Acarnania without any idea of\nfighting at sea, and with vessels more like transports for carrying\nsoldiers; besides which, they never dreamed of the twenty Athenian ships\nventuring to engage their forty-seven. However, while they were coasting\nalong their own shore, there were the Athenians sailing along in line\nwith them; and when they tried to cross over from Patrae in Achaea to\nthe mainland on the other side, on their way to Acarnania, they saw them\nagain coming out from Chalcis and the river Evenus to meet them. They\nslipped from their moorings in the night, but were observed, and were at\nlength compelled to fight in mid passage. Each state that contributed\nto the armament had its own general; the Corinthian commanders were\nMachaon, Isocrates, and Agatharchidas. The Peloponnesians ranged their\nvessels in as large a circle as possible without leaving an opening,\nwith the prows outside and the sterns in; and placed within all the\nsmall craft in company, and their five best sailers to issue out at a\nmoment's notice and strengthen any point threatened by the enemy.\n\nThe Athenians, formed in line, sailed round and round them, and forced\nthem to contract their circle, by continually brushing past and making\nas though they would attack at once, having been previously cautioned\nby Phormio not to do so till he gave the signal. His hope was that the\nPeloponnesians would not retain their order like a force on shore, but\nthat the ships would fall foul of one another and the small craft cause\nconfusion; and if the wind should blow from the gulf (in expectation\nof which he kept sailing round them, and which usually rose towards\nmorning), they would not, he felt sure, remain steady an instant. He\nalso thought that it rested with him to attack when he pleased, as his\nships were better sailers, and that an attack timed by the coming of the\nwind would tell best. When the wind came down, the enemy's ships were\nnow in a narrow space, and what with the wind and the small craft\ndashing against them, at once fell into confusion: ship fell foul of\nship, while the crews were pushing them off with poles, and by their\nshouting, swearing, and struggling with one another, made captains'\norders and boatswains' cries alike inaudible, and through being unable\nfor want of practice to clear their oars in the rough water, prevented\nthe vessels from obeying their helmsmen properly. At this moment Phormio\ngave the signal, and the Athenians attacked. Sinking first one of\nthe admirals, they then disabled all they came across, so that no one\nthought of resistance for the confusion, but fled for Patrae and Dyme in\nAchaea. The Athenians gave chase and captured twelve ships, and taking\nmost of the men out of them sailed to Molycrium, and after setting up\na trophy on the promontory of Rhium and dedicating a ship to Poseidon,\nreturned to Naupactus. As for the Peloponnesians, they at once sailed\nwith their remaining ships along the coast from Dyme and Patrae to\nCyllene, the Eleian arsenal; where Cnemus, and the ships from Leucas\nthat were to have joined them, also arrived after the battle at Stratus.\n\nThe Lacedaemonians now sent to the fleet to Cnemus three\ncommissioners--Timocrates, Bradidas, and Lycophron--with orders to\nprepare to engage again with better fortune, and not to be driven from\nthe sea by a few vessels; for they could not at all account for their\ndiscomfiture, the less so as it was their first attempt at sea; and\nthey fancied that it was not that their marine was so inferior, but that\nthere had been misconduct somewhere, not considering the long experience\nof the Athenians as compared with the little practice which they had had\nthemselves. The commissioners were accordingly sent in anger. As soon\nas they arrived they set to work with Cnemus to order ships from the\ndifferent states, and to put those which they already had in fighting\norder. Meanwhile Phormio sent word to Athens of their preparations and\nhis own victory, and desired as many ships as possible to be speedily\nsent to him, as he stood in daily expectation of a battle. Twenty were\naccordingly sent, but instructions were given to their commander to go\nfirst to Crete. For Nicias, a Cretan of Gortys, who was proxenus of\nthe Athenians, had persuaded them to sail against Cydonia, promising\nto procure the reduction of that hostile town; his real wish being to\noblige the Polichnitans, neighbours of the Cydonians. He accordingly\nwent with the ships to Crete, and, accompanied by the Polichnitans,\nlaid waste the lands of the Cydonians; and, what with adverse winds and\nstress of weather wasted no little time there.\n\nWhile the Athenians were thus detained in Crete, the Peloponnesians in\nCyllene got ready for battle, and coasted along to Panormus in Achaea,\nwhere their land army had come to support them. Phormio also coasted\nalong to Molycrian Rhium, and anchored outside it with twenty ships,\nthe same as he had fought with before. This Rhium was friendly to the\nAthenians. The other, in Peloponnese, lies opposite to it; the sea\nbetween them is about three-quarters of a mile broad, and forms the\nmouth of the Crissaean gulf. At this, the Achaean Rhium, not far off\nPanormus, where their army lay, the Peloponnesians now cast anchor with\nseventy-seven ships, when they saw the Athenians do so. For six or seven\ndays they remained opposite each other, practising and preparing for the\nbattle; the one resolved not to sail out of the Rhia into the open sea,\nfor fear of the disaster which had already happened to them, the other\nnot to sail into the straits, thinking it advantageous to the enemy, to\nfight in the narrows. At last Cnemus and Brasidas and the rest of the\nPeloponnesian commanders, being desirous of bringing on a battle as\nsoon as possible, before reinforcements should arrive from Athens, and\nnoticing that the men were most of them cowed by the previous defeat and\nout of heart for the business, first called them together and encouraged\nthem as follows:\n\n\"Peloponnesians, the late engagement, which may have made some of you\nafraid of the one now in prospect, really gives no just ground for\napprehension. Preparation for it, as you know, there was little enough;\nand the object of our voyage was not so much to fight at sea as an\nexpedition by land. Besides this, the chances of war were largely\nagainst us; and perhaps also inexperience had something to do with our\nfailure in our first naval action. It was not, therefore, cowardice that\nproduced our defeat, nor ought the determination which force has not\nquelled, but which still has a word to say with its adversary, to lose\nits edge from the result of an accident; but admitting the possibility\nof a chance miscarriage, we should know that brave hearts must be always\nbrave, and while they remain so can never put forward inexperience as an\nexcuse for misconduct. Nor are you so behind the enemy in experience\nas you are ahead of him in courage; and although the science of your\nopponents would, if valour accompanied it, have also the presence of\nmind to carry out at in emergency the lesson it has learnt, yet a faint\nheart will make all art powerless in the face of danger. For fear takes\naway presence of mind, and without valour art is useless. Against their\nsuperior experience set your superior daring, and against the fear\ninduced by defeat the fact of your having been then unprepared;\nremember, too, that you have always the advantage of superior numbers,\nand of engaging off your own coast, supported by your heavy infantry;\nand as a rule, numbers and equipment give victory. At no point,\ntherefore, is defeat likely; and as for our previous mistakes, the very\nfact of their occurrence will teach us better for the future. Steersmen\nand sailors may, therefore, confidently attend to their several duties,\nnone quitting the station assigned to them: as for ourselves, we\npromise to prepare for the engagement at least as well as your previous\ncommanders, and to give no excuse for any one misconducting himself.\nShould any insist on doing so, he shall meet with the punishment he\ndeserves, while the brave shall be honoured with the appropriate rewards\nof valour.\"\n\nThe Peloponnesian commanders encouraged their men after this fashion.\nPhormio, meanwhile, being himself not without fears for the courage of\nhis men, and noticing that they were forming in groups among themselves\nand were alarmed at the odds against them, desired to call them together\nand give them confidence and counsel in the present emergency. He had\nbefore continually told them, and had accustomed their minds to the\nidea, that there was no numerical superiority that they could not face;\nand the men themselves had long been persuaded that Athenians need never\nretire before any quantity of Peloponnesian vessels. At the moment,\nhowever, he saw that they were dispirited by the sight before them, and\nwishing to refresh their confidence, called them together and spoke as\nfollows:\n\n\"I see, my men, that you are frightened by the number of the enemy, and\nI have accordingly called you together, not liking you to be afraid of\nwhat is not really terrible. In the first place, the Peloponnesians,\nalready defeated, and not even themselves thinking that they are a match\nfor us, have not ventured to meet us on equal terms, but have equipped\nthis multitude of ships against us. Next, as to that upon which they\nmost rely, the courage which they suppose constitutional to them, their\nconfidence here only arises from the success which their experience in\nland service usually gives them, and which they fancy will do the same\nfor them at sea. But this advantage will in all justice belong to us\non this element, if to them on that; as they are not superior to us\nin courage, but we are each of us more confident, according to our\nexperience in our particular department. Besides, as the Lacedaemonians\nuse their supremacy over their allies to promote their own glory, they\nare most of them being brought into danger against their will, or they\nwould never, after such a decided defeat, have ventured upon a fresh\nengagement. You need not, therefore, be afraid of their dash. You, on\nthe contrary, inspire a much greater and better founded alarm, both\nbecause of your late victory and also of their belief that we should not\nface them unless about to do something worthy of a success so signal.\nAn adversary numerically superior, like the one before us, comes into\naction trusting more to strength than to resolution; while he who\nvoluntarily confronts tremendous odds must have very great internal\nresources to draw upon. For these reasons the Peloponnesians fear\nour irrational audacity more than they would ever have done a more\ncommensurate preparation. Besides, many armaments have before now\nsuccumbed to an inferior through want of skill or sometimes of courage;\nneither of which defects certainly are ours. As to the battle, it shall\nnot be, if I can help it, in the strait, nor will I sail in there at\nall; seeing that in a contest between a number of clumsily managed\nvessels and a small, fast, well-handled squadron, want of sea room is\nan undoubted disadvantage. One cannot run down an enemy properly without\nhaving a sight of him a good way off, nor can one retire at need when\npressed; one can neither break the line nor return upon his rear, the\nproper tactics for a fast sailer; but the naval action necessarily\nbecomes a land one, in which numbers must decide the matter. For all\nthis I will provide as far as can be. Do you stay at your posts by your\nships, and be sharp at catching the word of command, the more so as we\nare observing one another from so short a distance; and in action think\norder and silence all-important--qualities useful in war generally, and\nin naval engagements in particular; and behave before the enemy in a\nmanner worthy of your past exploits. The issues you will fight for are\ngreat--to destroy the naval hopes of the Peloponnesians or to bring\nnearer to the Athenians their fears for the sea. And I may once more\nremind you that you have defeated most of them already; and beaten men\ndo not face a danger twice with the same determination.\"\n\nSuch was the exhortation of Phormio. The Peloponnesians finding that the\nAthenians did not sail into the gulf and the narrows, in order to lead\nthem in whether they wished it or not, put out at dawn, and forming four\nabreast, sailed inside the gulf in the direction of their own country,\nthe right wing leading as they had lain at anchor. In this wing were\nplaced twenty of their best sailers; so that in the event of Phormio\nthinking that their object was Naupactus, and coasting along thither to\nsave the place, the Athenians might not be able to escape their onset\nby getting outside their wing, but might be cut off by the vessels in\nquestion. As they expected, Phormio, in alarm for the place at that\nmoment emptied of its garrison, as soon as he saw them put out,\nreluctantly and hurriedly embarked and sailed along shore; the Messenian\nland forces moving along also to support him. The Peloponnesians seeing\nhim coasting along with his ships in single file, and by this inside\nthe gulf and close inshore as they so much wished, at one signal tacked\nsuddenly and bore down in line at their best speed on the Athenians,\nhoping to cut off the whole squadron. The eleven leading vessels,\nhowever, escaped the Peloponnesian wing and its sudden movement, and\nreached the more open water; but the rest were overtaken as they tried\nto run through, driven ashore and disabled; such of the crews being\nslain as had not swum out of them. Some of the ships the Peloponnesians\nlashed to their own, and towed off empty; one they took with the men\nin it; others were just being towed off, when they were saved by the\nMessenians dashing into the sea with their armour and fighting from the\ndecks that they had boarded.\n\nThus far victory was with the Peloponnesians, and the Athenian fleet\ndestroyed; the twenty ships in the right wing being meanwhile in chase\nof the eleven Athenian vessels that had escaped their sudden movement\nand reached the more open water. These, with the exception of one\nship, all outsailed them and got safe into Naupactus, and forming close\ninshore opposite the temple of Apollo, with their prows facing the\nenemy, prepared to defend themselves in case the Peloponnesians should\nsail inshore against them. After a while the Peloponnesians came up,\nchanting the paean for their victory as they sailed on; the single\nAthenian ship remaining being chased by a Leucadian far ahead of the\nrest. But there happened to be a merchantman lying at anchor in the\nroadstead, which the Athenian ship found time to sail round, and struck\nthe Leucadian in chase amidships and sank her. An exploit so sudden and\nunexpected produced a panic among the Peloponnesians; and having fallen\nout of order in the excitement of victory, some of them dropped their\noars and stopped their way in order to let the main body come up--an\nunsafe thing to do considering how near they were to the enemy's prows;\nwhile others ran aground in the shallows, in their ignorance of the\nlocalities.\n\nElated at this incident, the Athenians at one word gave a cheer, and\ndashed at the enemy, who, embarrassed by his mistakes and the disorder\nin which he found himself, only stood for an instant, and then fled for\nPanormus, whence he had put out. The Athenians following on his heels\ntook the six vessels nearest them, and recovered those of their own\nwhich had been disabled close inshore and taken in tow at the beginning\nof the action; they killed some of the crews and took some prisoners.\nOn board the Leucadian which went down off the merchantman, was the\nLacedaemonian Timocrates, who killed himself when the ship was sunk, and\nwas cast up in the harbour of Naupactus. The Athenians on their return\nset up a trophy on the spot from which they had put out and turned the\nday, and picking up the wrecks and dead that were on their shore, gave\nback to the enemy their dead under truce. The Peloponnesians also set\nup a trophy as victors for the defeat inflicted upon the ships they\nhad disabled in shore, and dedicated the vessel which they had taken at\nAchaean Rhium, side by side with the trophy. After this, apprehensive of\nthe reinforcement expected from Athens, all except the Leucadians sailed\ninto the Crissaean Gulf for Corinth. Not long after their retreat, the\ntwenty Athenian ships, which were to have joined Phormio before the\nbattle, arrived at Naupactus.\n\nThus the summer ended. Winter was now at hand; but dispersing the fleet,\nwhich had retired to Corinth and the Crissaean Gulf, Cnemus, Brasidas,\nand the other Peloponnesian captains allowed themselves to be persuaded\nby the Megarians to make an attempt upon Piraeus, the port of Athens,\nwhich from her decided superiority at sea had been naturally left\nunguarded and open. Their plan was as follows: The men were each to take\ntheir oar, cushion, and rowlock thong, and, going overland from Corinth\nto the sea on the Athenian side, to get to Megara as quickly as they\ncould, and launching forty vessels, which happened to be in the docks at\nNisaea, to sail at once to Piraeus. There was no fleet on the look-out\nin the harbour, and no one had the least idea of the enemy attempting\na surprise; while an open attack would, it was thought, never be\ndeliberately ventured on, or, if in contemplation, would be speedily\nknown at Athens. Their plan formed, the next step was to put it in\nexecution. Arriving by night and launching the vessels from Nisaea, they\nsailed, not to Piraeus as they had originally intended, being afraid\nof the risk, besides which there was some talk of a wind having stopped\nthem, but to the point of Salamis that looks towards Megara; where there\nwas a fort and a squadron of three ships to prevent anything sailing in\nor out of Megara. This fort they assaulted, and towed off the galleys\nempty, and surprising the inhabitants began to lay waste the rest of the\nisland.\n\nMeanwhile fire signals were raised to alarm Athens, and a panic ensued\nthere as serious as any that occurred during the war. The idea in the\ncity was that the enemy had already sailed into Piraeus: in Piraeus it\nwas thought that they had taken Salamis and might at any moment arrive\nin the port; as indeed might easily have been done if their hearts had\nbeen a little firmer: certainly no wind would have prevented them. As\nsoon as day broke, the Athenians assembled in full force, launched their\nships, and embarking in haste and uproar went with the fleet to Salamis,\nwhile their soldiery mounted guard in Piraeus. The Peloponnesians, on\nbecoming aware of the coming relief, after they had overrun most of\nSalamis, hastily sailed off with their plunder and captives and the\nthree ships from Fort Budorum to Nisaea; the state of their ships also\ncausing them some anxiety, as it was a long while since they had\nbeen launched, and they were not water-tight. Arrived at Megara, they\nreturned back on foot to Corinth. The Athenians finding them no longer\nat Salamis, sailed back themselves; and after this made arrangements for\nguarding Piraeus more diligently in future, by closing the harbours, and\nby other suitable precautions.\n\nAbout the same time, at the beginning of this winter, Sitalces, son\nof Teres, the Odrysian king of Thrace, made an expedition against\nPerdiccas, son of Alexander, king of Macedonia, and the Chalcidians in\nthe neighbourhood of Thrace; his object being to enforce one promise and\nfulfil another. On the one hand Perdiccas had made him a promise,\nwhen hard pressed at the commencement of the war, upon condition that\nSitalces should reconcile the Athenians to him and not attempt to\nrestore his brother and enemy, the pretender Philip, but had not offered\nto fulfil his engagement; on the other he, Sitalces, on entering into\nalliance with the Athenians, had agreed to put an end to the Chalcidian\nwar in Thrace. These were the two objects of his invasion. With him he\nbrought Amyntas, the son of Philip, whom he destined for the throne of\nMacedonia, and some Athenian envoys then at his court on this business,\nand Hagnon as general; for the Athenians were to join him against\nthe Chalcidians with a fleet and as many soldiers as they could get\ntogether.\n\nBeginning with the Odrysians, he first called out the Thracian tribes\nsubject to him between Mounts Haemus and Rhodope and the Euxine and\nHellespont; next the Getae beyond Haemus, and the other hordes settled\nsouth of the Danube in the neighbourhood of the Euxine, who, like the\nGetae, border on the Scythians and are armed in the same manner, being\nall mounted archers. Besides these he summoned many of the hill Thracian\nindependent swordsmen, called Dii and mostly inhabiting Mount Rhodope,\nsome of whom came as mercenaries, others as volunteers; also the\nAgrianes and Laeaeans, and the rest of the Paeonian tribes in his\nempire, at the confines of which these lay, extending up to the Laeaean\nPaeonians and the river Strymon, which flows from Mount Scombrus through\nthe country of the Agrianes and Laeaeans; there the empire of Sitalces\nends and the territory of the independent Paeonians begins. Bordering\non the Triballi, also independent, were the Treres and Tilataeans, who\ndwell to the north of Mount Scombrus and extend towards the setting sun\nas far as the river Oskius. This river rises in the same mountains\nas the Nestus and Hebrus, a wild and extensive range connected with\nRhodope.\n\nThe empire of the Odrysians extended along the seaboard from Abdera to\nthe mouth of the Danube in the Euxine. The navigation of this coast by\nthe shortest route takes a merchantman four days and four nights with\na wind astern the whole way: by land an active man, travelling by the\nshortest road, can get from Abdera to the Danube in eleven days. Such\nwas the length of its coast line. Inland from Byzantium to the Laeaeans\nand the Strymon, the farthest limit of its extension into the interior,\nit is a journey of thirteen days for an active man. The tribute from\nall the barbarian districts and the Hellenic cities, taking what they\nbrought in under Seuthes, the successor of Sitalces, who raised it to\nits greatest height, amounted to about four hundred talents in gold and\nsilver. There were also presents in gold and silver to a no less amount,\nbesides stuff, plain and embroidered, and other articles, made not only\nfor the king, but also for the Odrysian lords and nobles. For there was\nhere established a custom opposite to that prevailing in the Persian\nkingdom, namely, of taking rather than giving; more disgrace being\nattached to not giving when asked than to asking and being refused;\nand although this prevailed elsewhere in Thrace, it was practised most\nextensively among the powerful Odrysians, it being impossible to get\nanything done without a present. It was thus a very powerful kingdom;\nin revenue and general prosperity surpassing all in Europe between the\nIonian Gulf and the Euxine, and in numbers and military resources coming\ndecidedly next to the Scythians, with whom indeed no people in Europe\ncan bear comparison, there not being even in Asia any nation singly a\nmatch for them if unanimous, though of course they are not on a level\nwith other races in general intelligence and the arts of civilized life.\n\nIt was the master of this empire that now prepared to take the field.\nWhen everything was ready, he set out on his march for Macedonia, first\nthrough his own dominions, next over the desolate range of Cercine that\ndivides the Sintians and Paeonians, crossing by a road which he had made\nby felling the timber on a former campaign against the latter people.\nPassing over these mountains, with the Paeonians on his right and the\nSintians and Maedians on the left, he finally arrived at Doberus,\nin Paeonia, losing none of his army on the march, except perhaps by\nsickness, but receiving some augmentations, many of the independent\nThracians volunteering to join him in the hope of plunder; so that\nthe whole is said to have formed a grand total of a hundred and fifty\nthousand. Most of this was infantry, though there was about a third\ncavalry, furnished principally by the Odrysians themselves and next to\nthem by the Getae. The most warlike of the infantry were the independent\nswordsmen who came down from Rhodope; the rest of the mixed multitude\nthat followed him being chiefly formidable by their numbers.\n\nAssembling in Doberus, they prepared for descending from the heights\nupon Lower Macedonia, where the dominions of Perdiccas lay; for the\nLyncestae, Elimiots, and other tribes more inland, though Macedonians by\nblood, and allies and dependants of their kindred, still have their\nown separate governments. The country on the sea coast, now called\nMacedonia, was first acquired by Alexander, the father of Perdiccas, and\nhis ancestors, originally Temenids from Argos. This was effected by the\nexpulsion from Pieria of the Pierians, who afterwards inhabited Phagres\nand other places under Mount Pangaeus, beyond the Strymon (indeed the\ncountry between Pangaeus and the sea is still called the Pierian Gulf);\nof the Bottiaeans, at present neighbours of the Chalcidians, from\nBottia, and by the acquisition in Paeonia of a narrow strip along the\nriver Axius extending to Pella and the sea; the district of Mygdonia,\nbetween the Axius and the Strymon, being also added by the expulsion of\nthe Edonians. From Eordia also were driven the Eordians, most of\nwhom perished, though a few of them still live round Physca, and\nthe Almopians from Almopia. These Macedonians also conquered places\nbelonging to the other tribes, which are still theirs--Anthemus,\nCrestonia, Bisaltia, and much of Macedonia proper. The whole is\nnow called Macedonia, and at the time of the invasion of Sitalces,\nPerdiccas, Alexander's son, was the reigning king.\n\nThese Macedonians, unable to take the field against so numerous an\ninvader, shut themselves up in such strong places and fortresses as the\ncountry possessed. Of these there was no great number, most of those now\nfound in the country having been erected subsequently by Archelaus, the\nson of Perdiccas, on his accession, who also cut straight roads, and\notherwise put the kingdom on a better footing as regards horses, heavy\ninfantry, and other war material than had been done by all the eight\nkings that preceded him. Advancing from Doberus, the Thracian host first\ninvaded what had been once Philip's government, and took Idomene by\nassault, Gortynia, Atalanta, and some other places by negotiation, these\nlast coming over for love of Philip's son, Amyntas, then with Sitalces.\nLaying siege to Europus, and failing to take it, he next advanced into\nthe rest of Macedonia to the left of Pella and Cyrrhus, not proceeding\nbeyond this into Bottiaea and Pieria, but staying to lay waste Mygdonia,\nCrestonia, and Anthemus.\n\nThe Macedonians never even thought of meeting him with infantry; but the\nThracian host was, as opportunity offered, attacked by handfuls of their\nhorse, which had been reinforced from their allies in the interior.\nArmed with cuirasses, and excellent horsemen, wherever these charged\nthey overthrew all before them, but ran considerable risk in entangling\nthemselves in the masses of the enemy, and so finally desisted from\nthese efforts, deciding that they were not strong enough to venture\nagainst numbers so superior.\n\nMeanwhile Sitalces opened negotiations with Perdiccas on the objects of\nhis expedition; and finding that the Athenians, not believing that he\nwould come, did not appear with their fleet, though they sent presents\nand envoys, dispatched a large part of his army against the Chalcidians\nand Bottiaeans, and shutting them up inside their walls laid waste their\ncountry. While he remained in these parts, the people farther south,\nsuch as the Thessalians, Magnetes, and the other tribes subject to the\nThessalians, and the Hellenes as far as Thermopylae, all feared that the\narmy might advance against them, and prepared accordingly. These fears\nwere shared by the Thracians beyond the Strymon to the north, who\ninhabited the plains, such as the Panaeans, the Odomanti, the Droi,\nand the Dersaeans, all of whom are independent. It was even matter of\nconversation among the Hellenes who were enemies of Athens whether he\nmight not be invited by his ally to advance also against them. Meanwhile\nhe held Chalcidice and Bottice and Macedonia, and was ravaging them\nall; but finding that he was not succeeding in any of the objects of\nhis invasion, and that his army was without provisions and was suffering\nfrom the severity of the season, he listened to the advice of Seuthes,\nson of Spardacus, his nephew and highest officer, and decided to retreat\nwithout delay. This Seuthes had been secretly gained by Perdiccas by the\npromise of his sister in marriage with a rich dowry. In accordance with\nthis advice, and after a stay of thirty days in all, eight of which\nwere spent in Chalcidice, he retired home as quickly as he could; and\nPerdiccas afterwards gave his sister Stratonice to Seuthes as he had\npromised. Such was the history of the expedition of Sitalces.\n\nIn the course of this winter, after the dispersion of the Peloponnesian\nfleet, the Athenians in Naupactus, under Phormio, coasted along to\nAstacus and disembarked, and marched into the interior of Acarnania with\nfour hundred Athenian heavy infantry and four hundred Messenians.\nAfter expelling some suspected persons from Stratus, Coronta, and other\nplaces, and restoring Cynes, son of Theolytus, to Coronta, they returned\nto their ships, deciding that it was impossible in the winter season to\nmarch against Oeniadae, a place which, unlike the rest of Acarnania, had\nbeen always hostile to them; for the river Achelous flowing from Mount\nPindus through Dolopia and the country of the Agraeans and Amphilochians\nand the plain of Acarnania, past the town of Stratus in the upper part\nof its course, forms lakes where it falls into the sea round Oeniadae,\nand thus makes it impracticable for an army in winter by reason of the\nwater. Opposite to Oeniadae lie most of the islands called Echinades,\nso close to the mouths of the Achelous that that powerful stream is\nconstantly forming deposits against them, and has already joined some\nof the islands to the continent, and seems likely in no long while to do\nthe same with the rest. For the current is strong, deep, and turbid,\nand the islands are so thick together that they serve to imprison the\nalluvial deposit and prevent its dispersing, lying, as they do, not\nin one line, but irregularly, so as to leave no direct passage for the\nwater into the open sea. The islands in question are uninhabited and of\nno great size. There is also a story that Alcmaeon, son of Amphiraus,\nduring his wanderings after the murder of his mother was bidden by\nApollo to inhabit this spot, through an oracle which intimated that he\nwould have no release from his terrors until he should find a country to\ndwell in which had not been seen by the sun, or existed as land at\nthe time he slew his mother; all else being to him polluted ground.\nPerplexed at this, the story goes on to say, he at last observed this\ndeposit of the Achelous, and considered that a place sufficient to\nsupport life upon, might have been thrown up during the long interval\nthat had elapsed since the death of his mother and the beginning of\nhis wanderings. Settling, therefore, in the district round Oeniadae, he\nfounded a dominion, and left the country its name from his son Acarnan.\nSuch is the story we have received concerning Alcmaeon.\n\nThe Athenians and Phormio putting back from Acarnania and arriving at\nNaupactus, sailed home to Athens in the spring, taking with them the\nships that they had captured, and such of the prisoners made in the late\nactions as were freemen; who were exchanged, man for man. And so ended\nthis winter, and the third year of this war, of which Thucydides was the\nhistorian.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_Fourth and Fifth Years of the War--Revolt of Mitylene_\n\nThe next summer, just as the corn was getting ripe, the Peloponnesians\nand their allies invaded Attica under the command of Archidamus, son\nof Zeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians, and sat down and ravaged\nthe land; the Athenian horse as usual attacking them, wherever it was\npracticable, and preventing the mass of the light troops from advancing\nfrom their camp and wasting the parts near the city. After staying\nthe time for which they had taken provisions, the invaders retired and\ndispersed to their several cities.\n\nImmediately after the invasion of the Peloponnesians all Lesbos, except\nMethymna, revolted from the Athenians. The Lesbians had wished to revolt\neven before the war, but the Lacedaemonians would not receive them; and\nyet now when they did revolt, they were compelled to do so sooner than\nthey had intended. While they were waiting until the moles for their\nharbours and the ships and walls that they had in building should be\nfinished, and for the arrival of archers and corn and other things that\nthey were engaged in fetching from the Pontus, the Tenedians, with whom\nthey were at enmity, and the Methymnians, and some factious persons in\nMitylene itself, who were proxeni of Athens, informed the Athenians\nthat the Mitylenians were forcibly uniting the island under their\nsovereignty, and that the preparations about which they were so\nactive, were all concerted with the Boeotians their kindred and the\nLacedaemonians with a view to a revolt, and that, unless they were\nimmediately prevented, Athens would lose Lesbos.\n\nHowever, the Athenians, distressed by the plague, and by the war that\nhad recently broken out and was now raging, thought it a serious matter\nto add Lesbos with its fleet and untouched resources to the list of\ntheir enemies; and at first would not believe the charge, giving too\nmuch weight to their wish that it might not be true. But when an embassy\nwhich they sent had failed to persuade the Mitylenians to give up the\nunion and preparations complained of, they became alarmed, and resolved\nto strike the first blow. They accordingly suddenly sent off forty ships\nthat had been got ready to sail round Peloponnese, under the command\nof Cleippides, son of Deinias, and two others; word having been brought\nthem of a festival in honour of the Malean Apollo outside the town,\nwhich is kept by the whole people of Mitylene, and at which, if haste\nwere made, they might hope to take them by surprise. If this plan\nsucceeded, well and good; if not, they were to order the Mitylenians to\ndeliver up their ships and to pull down their walls, and if they did not\nobey, to declare war. The ships accordingly set out; the ten galleys,\nforming the contingent of the Mitylenians present with the fleet\naccording to the terms of the alliance, being detained by the Athenians,\nand their crews placed in custody. However, the Mitylenians were\ninformed of the expedition by a man who crossed from Athens to Euboea,\nand going overland to Geraestus, sailed from thence by a merchantman\nwhich he found on the point of putting to sea, and so arrived at\nMitylene the third day after leaving Athens. The Mitylenians accordingly\nrefrained from going out to the temple at Malea, and moreover barricaded\nand kept guard round the half-finished parts of their walls and\nharbours.\n\nWhen the Athenians sailed in not long after and saw how things stood,\nthe generals delivered their orders, and upon the Mitylenians refusing\nto obey, commenced hostilities. The Mitylenians, thus compelled to go to\nwar without notice and unprepared, at first sailed out with their fleet\nand made some show of fighting, a little in front of the harbour; but\nbeing driven back by the Athenian ships, immediately offered to treat\nwith the commanders, wishing, if possible, to get the ships away for the\npresent upon any tolerable terms. The Athenian commanders accepted their\noffers, being themselves fearful that they might not be able to cope\nwith the whole of Lesbos; and an armistice having been concluded, the\nMitylenians sent to Athens one of the informers, already repentant of\nhis conduct, and others with him, to try to persuade the Athenians of\nthe innocence of their intentions and to get the fleet recalled. In the\nmeantime, having no great hope of a favourable answer from Athens, they\nalso sent off a galley with envoys to Lacedaemon, unobserved by the\nAthenian fleet which was anchored at Malea to the north of the town.\n\nWhile these envoys, reaching Lacedaemon after a difficult journey\nacross the open sea, were negotiating for succours being sent them, the\nambassadors from Athens returned without having effected anything;\nand hostilities were at once begun by the Mitylenians and the rest of\nLesbos, with the exception of the Methymnians, who came to the aid of\nthe Athenians with the Imbrians and Lemnians and some few of the other\nallies. The Mitylenians made a sortie with all their forces against the\nAthenian camp; and a battle ensued, in which they gained some slight\nadvantage, but retired notwithstanding, not feeling sufficient\nconfidence in themselves to spend the night upon the field. After\nthis they kept quiet, wishing to wait for the chance of reinforcements\narriving from Peloponnese before making a second venture, being\nencouraged by the arrival of Meleas, a Laconian, and Hermaeondas, a\nTheban, who had been sent off before the insurrection but had been\nunable to reach Lesbos before the Athenian expedition, and who now stole\nin in a galley after the battle, and advised them to send another galley\nand envoys back with them, which the Mitylenians accordingly did.\n\nMeanwhile the Athenians, greatly encouraged by the inaction of the\nMitylenians, summoned allies to their aid, who came in all the quicker\nfrom seeing so little vigour displayed by the Lesbians, and bringing\nround their ships to a new station to the south of the town, fortified\ntwo camps, one on each side of the city, and instituted a blockade of\nboth the harbours. The sea was thus closed against the Mitylenians, who,\nhowever, commanded the whole country, with the rest of the Lesbians who\nhad now joined them; the Athenians only holding a limited area round\ntheir camps, and using Malea more as the station for their ships and\ntheir market.\n\nWhile the war went on in this way at Mitylene, the Athenians, about the\nsame time in this summer, also sent thirty ships to Peloponnese under\nAsopius, son of Phormio; the Acarnanians insisting that the commander\nsent should be some son or relative of Phormio. As the ships coasted\nalong shore they ravaged the seaboard of Laconia; after which Asopius\nsent most of the fleet home, and himself went on with twelve vessels to\nNaupactus, and afterwards raising the whole Acarnanian population made\nan expedition against Oeniadae, the fleet sailing along the Achelous,\nwhile the army laid waste the country. The inhabitants, however, showing\nno signs of submitting, he dismissed the land forces and himself sailed\nto Leucas, and making a descent upon Nericus was cut off during his\nretreat, and most of his troops with him, by the people in those parts\naided by some coastguards; after which the Athenians sailed away,\nrecovering their dead from the Leucadians under truce.\n\nMeanwhile the envoys of the Mitylenians sent out in the first ship were\ntold by the Lacedaemonians to come to Olympia, in order that the rest\nof the allies might hear them and decide upon their matter, and so they\njourneyed thither. It was the Olympiad in which the Rhodian Dorieus\ngained his second victory, and the envoys having been introduced to make\ntheir speech after the festival, spoke as follows:\n\n\"Lacedaemonians and allies, the rule established among the Hellenes\nis not unknown to us. Those who revolt in war and forsake their former\nconfederacy are favourably regarded by those who receive them, in so\nfar as they are of use to them, but otherwise are thought less well of,\nthrough being considered traitors to their former friends. Nor is this\nan unfair way of judging, where the rebels and the power from whom they\nsecede are at one in policy and sympathy, and a match for each other\nin resources and power, and where no reasonable ground exists for the\nrebellion. But with us and the Athenians this was not the case; and no\none need think the worse of us for revolting from them in danger, after\nhaving been honoured by them in time of peace.\n\n\"Justice and honesty will be the first topics of our speech, especially\nas we are asking for alliance; because we know that there can never be\nany solid friendship between individuals, or union between communities\nthat is worth the name, unless the parties be persuaded of each other's\nhonesty, and be generally congenial the one to the other; since from\ndifference in feeling springs also difference in conduct. Between\nourselves and the Athenians alliance began, when you withdrew from the\nMedian War and they remained to finish the business. But we did not\nbecome allies of the Athenians for the subjugation of the Hellenes, but\nallies of the Hellenes for their liberation from the Mede; and as long\nas the Athenians led us fairly we followed them loyally; but when we saw\nthem relax their hostility to the Mede, to try to compass the subjection\nof the allies, then our apprehensions began. Unable, however, to unite\nand defend themselves, on account of the number of confederates that had\nvotes, all the allies were enslaved, except ourselves and the Chians,\nwho continued to send our contingents as independent and nominally free.\nTrust in Athens as a leader, however, we could no longer feel, judging\nby the examples already given; it being unlikely that she would reduce\nour fellow confederates, and not do the same by us who were left, if\never she had the power.\n\n\"Had we all been still independent, we could have had more faith in\ntheir not attempting any change; but the greater number being their\nsubjects, while they were treating us as equals, they would naturally\nchafe under this solitary instance of independence as contrasted with\nthe submission of the majority; particularly as they daily grew more\npowerful, and we more destitute. Now the only sure basis of an alliance\nis for each party to be equally afraid of the other; he who would like\nto encroach is then deterred by the reflection that he will not have\nodds in his favour. Again, if we were left independent, it was only\nbecause they thought they saw their way to empire more clearly by\nspecious language and by the paths of policy than by those of force.\nNot only were we useful as evidence that powers who had votes, like\nthemselves, would not, surely, join them in their expeditions, against\ntheir will, without the party attacked being in the wrong; but the same\nsystem also enabled them to lead the stronger states against the weaker\nfirst, and so to leave the former to the last, stripped of their natural\nallies, and less capable of resistance. But if they had begun with us,\nwhile all the states still had their resources under their own control,\nand there was a centre to rally round, the work of subjugation would\nhave been found less easy. Besides this, our navy gave them some\napprehension: it was always possible that it might unite with you or\nwith some other power, and become dangerous to Athens. The court which\nwe paid to their commons and its leaders for the time being also helped\nus to maintain our independence. However, we did not expect to be able\nto do so much longer, if this war had not broken out, from the examples\nthat we had had of their conduct to the rest.\n\n\"How then could we put our trust in such friendship or freedom as we\nhad here? We accepted each other against our inclination; fear made them\ncourt us in war, and us them in peace; sympathy, the ordinary basis of\nconfidence, had its place supplied by terror, fear having more share\nthan friendship in detaining us in the alliance; and the first party\nthat should be encouraged by the hope of impunity was certain to break\nfaith with the other. So that to condemn us for being the first to break\noff, because they delay the blow that we dread, instead of ourselves\ndelaying to know for certain whether it will be dealt or not, is to take\na false view of the case. For if we were equally able with them to\nmeet their plots and imitate their delay, we should be their equals and\nshould be under no necessity of being their subjects; but the liberty of\noffence being always theirs, that of defence ought clearly to be ours.\n\n\"Such, Lacedaemonians and allies, are the grounds and the reasons of\nour revolt; clear enough to convince our hearers of the fairness of our\nconduct, and sufficient to alarm ourselves, and to make us turn to some\nmeans of safety. This we wished to do long ago, when we sent to you on\nthe subject while the peace yet lasted, but were balked by your refusing\nto receive us; and now, upon the Boeotians inviting us, we at once\nresponded to the call, and decided upon a twofold revolt, from the\nHellenes and from the Athenians, not to aid the latter in harming the\nformer, but to join in their liberation, and not to allow the Athenians\nin the end to destroy us, but to act in time against them. Our revolt,\nhowever, has taken place prematurely and without preparation--a fact\nwhich makes it all the more incumbent on you to receive us into alliance\nand to send us speedy relief, in order to show that you support your\nfriends, and at the same time do harm to your enemies. You have an\nopportunity such as you never had before. Disease and expenditure have\nwasted the Athenians: their ships are either cruising round your coasts,\nor engaged in blockading us; and it is not probable that they will have\nany to spare, if you invade them a second time this summer by sea and\nland; but they will either offer no resistance to your vessels, or\nwithdraw from both our shores. Nor must it be thought that this is a\ncase of putting yourselves into danger for a country which is not yours.\nLesbos may appear far off, but when help is wanted she will be found\nnear enough. It is not in Attica that the war will be decided, as some\nimagine, but in the countries by which Attica is supported; and the\nAthenian revenue is drawn from the allies, and will become still larger\nif they reduce us; as not only will no other state revolt, but our\nresources will be added to theirs, and we shall be treated worse than\nthose that were enslaved before. But if you will frankly support us, you\nwill add to your side a state that has a large navy, which is your\ngreat want; you will smooth the way to the overthrow of the Athenians by\ndepriving them of their allies, who will be greatly encouraged to come\nover; and you will free yourselves from the imputation made against\nyou, of not supporting insurrection. In short, only show yourselves as\nliberators, and you may count upon having the advantage in the war.\n\n\"Respect, therefore, the hopes placed in you by the Hellenes, and that\nOlympian Zeus, in whose temple we stand as very suppliants; become the\nallies and defenders of the Mitylenians, and do not sacrifice us, who\nput our lives upon the hazard, in a cause in which general good will\nresult to all from our success, and still more general harm if we fail\nthrough your refusing to help us; but be the men that the Hellenes think\nyou, and our fears desire.\"\n\nSuch were the words of the Mitylenians. After hearing them out, the\nLacedaemonians and confederates granted what they urged, and took\nthe Lesbians into alliance, and deciding in favour of the invasion of\nAttica, told the allies present to march as quickly as possible to\nthe Isthmus with two-thirds of their forces; and arriving there first\nthemselves, got ready hauling machines to carry their ships across from\nCorinth to the sea on the side of Athens, in order to make their attack\nby sea and land at once. However, the zeal which they displayed was not\nimitated by the rest of the confederates, who came in but slowly, being\nengaged in harvesting their corn and sick of making expeditions.\n\nMeanwhile the Athenians, aware that the preparations of the enemy were\ndue to his conviction of their weakness, and wishing to show him that he\nwas mistaken, and that they were able, without moving the Lesbian fleet,\nto repel with ease that with which they were menaced from Peloponnese,\nmanned a hundred ships by embarking the citizens of Athens, except the\nknights and Pentacosiomedimni, and the resident aliens; and putting\nout to the Isthmus, displayed their power, and made descents upon\nPeloponnese wherever they pleased. A disappointment so signal made the\nLacedaemonians think that the Lesbians had not spoken the truth; and\nembarrassed by the non-appearance of the confederates, coupled with the\nnews that the thirty ships round Peloponnese were ravaging the lands\nnear Sparta, they went back home. Afterwards, however, they got ready\na fleet to send to Lesbos, and ordering a total of forty ships from\nthe different cities in the league, appointed Alcidas to command the\nexpedition in his capacity of high admiral. Meanwhile the Athenians in\nthe hundred ships, upon seeing the Lacedaemonians go home, went home\nlikewise.\n\nIf, at the time that this fleet was at sea, Athens had almost the\nlargest number of first-rate ships in commission that she ever possessed\nat any one moment, she had as many or even more when the war began. At\nthat time one hundred guarded Attica, Euboea, and Salamis; a hundred\nmore were cruising round Peloponnese, besides those employed at Potidaea\nand in other places; making a grand total of two hundred and fifty\nvessels employed on active service in a single summer. It was this, with\nPotidaea, that most exhausted her revenues--Potidaea being blockaded\nby a force of heavy infantry (each drawing two drachmae a day, one for\nhimself and another for his servant), which amounted to three thousand\nat first, and was kept at this number down to the end of the siege;\nbesides sixteen hundred with Phormio who went away before it was over;\nand the ships being all paid at the same rate. In this way her money was\nwasted at first; and this was the largest number of ships ever manned by\nher.\n\nAbout the same time that the Lacedaemonians were at the Isthmus, the\nMitylenians marched by land with their mercenaries against Methymna,\nwhich they thought to gain by treachery. After assaulting the town, and\nnot meeting with the success that they anticipated, they withdrew to\nAntissa, Pyrrha, and Eresus; and taking measures for the better security\nof these towns and strengthening their walls, hastily returned home.\nAfter their departure the Methymnians marched against Antissa, but\nwere defeated in a sortie by the Antissians and their mercenaries,\nand retreated in haste after losing many of their number. Word of this\nreaching Athens, and the Athenians learning that the Mitylenians were\nmasters of the country and their own soldiers unable to hold them\nin check, they sent out about the beginning of autumn Paches, son of\nEpicurus, to take the command, and a thousand Athenian heavy infantry;\nwho worked their own passage and, arriving at Mitylene, built a single\nwall all round it, forts being erected at some of the strongest points.\nMitylene was thus blockaded strictly on both sides, by land and by sea;\nand winter now drew near.\n\nThe Athenians needing money for the siege, although they had for the\nfirst time raised a contribution of two hundred talents from their own\ncitizens, now sent out twelve ships to levy subsidies from their allies,\nwith Lysicles and four others in command. After cruising to different\nplaces and laying them under contribution, Lysicles went up the country\nfrom Myus, in Caria, across the plain of the Meander, as far as the hill\nof Sandius; and being attacked by the Carians and the people of Anaia,\nwas slain with many of his soldiers.\n\nThe same winter the Plataeans, who were still being besieged by the\nPeloponnesians and Boeotians, distressed by the failure of their\nprovisions, and seeing no hope of relief from Athens, nor any other\nmeans of safety, formed a scheme with the Athenians besieged with them\nfor escaping, if possible, by forcing their way over the enemy's walls;\nthe attempt having been suggested by Theaenetus, son of Tolmides, a\nsoothsayer, and Eupompides, son of Daimachus, one of their generals. At\nfirst all were to join: afterwards, half hung back, thinking the risk\ngreat; about two hundred and twenty, however, voluntarily persevered in\nthe attempt, which was carried out in the following way. Ladders were\nmade to match the height of the enemy's wall, which they measured by\nthe layers of bricks, the side turned towards them not being thoroughly\nwhitewashed. These were counted by many persons at once; and though some\nmight miss the right calculation, most would hit upon it, particularly\nas they counted over and over again, and were no great way from the\nwall, but could see it easily enough for their purpose. The length\nrequired for the ladders was thus obtained, being calculated from the\nbreadth of the brick.\n\nNow the wall of the Peloponnesians was constructed as follows. It\nconsisted of two lines drawn round the place, one against the Plataeans,\nthe other against any attack on the outside from Athens, about sixteen\nfeet apart. The intermediate space of sixteen feet was occupied by huts\nportioned out among the soldiers on guard, and built in one block, so as\nto give the appearance of a single thick wall with battlements on either\nside. At intervals of every ten battlements were towers of considerable\nsize, and the same breadth as the wall, reaching right across from its\ninner to its outer face, with no means of passing except through the\nmiddle. Accordingly on stormy and wet nights the battlements were\ndeserted, and guard kept from the towers, which were not far apart and\nroofed in above.\n\nSuch being the structure of the wall by which the Plataeans were\nblockaded, when their preparations were completed, they waited for a\nstormy night of wind and rain and without any moon, and then set out,\nguided by the authors of the enterprise. Crossing first the ditch that\nran round the town, they next gained the wall of the enemy unperceived\nby the sentinels, who did not see them in the darkness, or hear them,\nas the wind drowned with its roar the noise of their approach; besides\nwhich they kept a good way off from each other, that they might not be\nbetrayed by the clash of their weapons. They were also lightly equipped,\nand had only the left foot shod to preserve them from slipping in the\nmire. They came up to the battlements at one of the intermediate spaces\nwhere they knew them to be unguarded: those who carried the ladders went\nfirst and planted them; next twelve light-armed soldiers with only a\ndagger and a breastplate mounted, led by Ammias, son of Coroebus, who\nwas the first on the wall; his followers getting up after him and going\nsix to each of the towers. After these came another party of light\ntroops armed with spears, whose shields, that they might advance the\neasier, were carried by men behind, who were to hand them to them when\nthey found themselves in presence of the enemy. After a good many had\nmounted they were discovered by the sentinels in the towers, by the\nnoise made by a tile which was knocked down by one of the Plataeans as\nhe was laying hold of the battlements. The alarm was instantly given,\nand the troops rushed to the wall, not knowing the nature of the danger,\nowing to the dark night and stormy weather; the Plataeans in the town\nhaving also chosen that moment to make a sortie against the wall of the\nPeloponnesians upon the side opposite to that on which their men\nwere getting over, in order to divert the attention of the besiegers.\nAccordingly they remained distracted at their several posts, without any\nventuring to stir to give help from his own station, and at a loss\nto guess what was going on. Meanwhile the three hundred set aside for\nservice on emergencies went outside the wall in the direction of the\nalarm. Fire-signals of an attack were also raised towards Thebes; but\nthe Plataeans in the town at once displayed a number of others, prepared\nbeforehand for this very purpose, in order to render the enemy's signals\nunintelligible, and to prevent his friends getting a true idea of what\nwas passing and coming to his aid before their comrades who had gone out\nshould have made good their escape and be in safety.\n\nMeanwhile the first of the scaling party that had got up, after\ncarrying both the towers and putting the sentinels to the sword, posted\nthemselves inside to prevent any one coming through against them; and\nrearing ladders from the wall, sent several men up on the towers, and\nfrom their summit and base kept in check all of the enemy that came up,\nwith their missiles, while their main body planted a number of ladders\nagainst the wall, and knocking down the battlements, passed over between\nthe towers; each as soon as he had got over taking up his station at the\nedge of the ditch, and plying from thence with arrows and darts any who\ncame along the wall to stop the passage of his comrades. When all were\nover, the party on the towers came down, the last of them not without\ndifficulty, and proceeded to the ditch, just as the three hundred came\nup carrying torches. The Plataeans, standing on the edge of the ditch\nin the dark, had a good view of their opponents, and discharged their\narrows and darts upon the unarmed parts of their bodies, while they\nthemselves could not be so well seen in the obscurity for the torches;\nand thus even the last of them got over the ditch, though not without\neffort and difficulty; as ice had formed in it, not strong enough to\nwalk upon, but of that watery kind which generally comes with a wind\nmore east than north, and the snow which this wind had caused to fall\nduring the night had made the water in the ditch rise, so that they\ncould scarcely breast it as they crossed. However, it was mainly the\nviolence of the storm that enabled them to effect their escape at all.\n\nStarting from the ditch, the Plataeans went all together along the road\nleading to Thebes, keeping the chapel of the hero Androcrates upon their\nright; considering that the last road which the Peloponnesians would\nsuspect them of having taken would be that towards their enemies'\ncountry. Indeed they could see them pursuing with torches upon the\nAthens road towards Cithaeron and Druoskephalai or Oakheads. After going\nfor rather more than half a mile upon the road to Thebes, the Plataeans\nturned off and took that leading to the mountain, to Erythrae and\nHysiae, and reaching the hills, made good their escape to Athens, two\nhundred and twelve men in all; some of their number having turned back\ninto the town before getting over the wall, and one archer having been\ntaken prisoner at the outer ditch. Meanwhile the Peloponnesians gave up\nthe pursuit and returned to their posts; and the Plataeans in the town,\nknowing nothing of what had passed, and informed by those who had turned\nback that not a man had escaped, sent out a herald as soon as it was day\nto make a truce for the recovery of the dead bodies, and then, learning\nthe truth, desisted. In this way the Plataean party got over and were\nsaved.\n\nTowards the close of the same winter, Salaethus, a Lacedaemonian,\nwas sent out in a galley from Lacedaemon to Mitylene. Going by sea to\nPyrrha, and from thence overland, he passed along the bed of a torrent,\nwhere the line of circumvallation was passable, and thus entering\nunperceived into Mitylene told the magistrates that Attica would\ncertainly be invaded, and the forty ships destined to relieve them\narrive, and that he had been sent on to announce this and to superintend\nmatters generally. The Mitylenians upon this took courage, and laid\naside the idea of treating with the Athenians; and now this winter\nended, and with it ended the fourth year of the war of which Thucydides\nwas the historian.\n\nThe next summer the Peloponnesians sent off the forty-two ships for\nMitylene, under Alcidas, their high admiral, and themselves and their\nallies invaded Attica, their object being to distract the Athenians by\na double movement, and thus to make it less easy for them to act against\nthe fleet sailing to Mitylene. The commander in this invasion was\nCleomenes, in the place of King Pausanias, son of Pleistoanax, his\nnephew, who was still a minor. Not content with laying waste whatever\nhad shot up in the parts which they had before devastated, the invaders\nnow extended their ravages to lands passed over in their previous\nincursions; so that this invasion was more severely felt by the\nAthenians than any except the second; the enemy staying on and on until\nthey had overrun most of the country, in the expectation of hearing\nfrom Lesbos of something having been achieved by their fleet, which they\nthought must now have got over. However, as they did not obtain any\nof the results expected, and their provisions began to run short, they\nretreated and dispersed to their different cities.\n\nIn the meantime the Mitylenians, finding their provisions failing, while\nthe fleet from Peloponnese was loitering on the way instead of appearing\nat Mitylene, were compelled to come to terms with the Athenians in the\nfollowing manner. Salaethus having himself ceased to expect the fleet\nto arrive, now armed the commons with heavy armour, which they had not\nbefore possessed, with the intention of making a sortie against the\nAthenians. The commons, however, no sooner found themselves possessed of\narms than they refused any longer to obey their officers; and forming\nin knots together, told the authorities to bring out in public the\nprovisions and divide them amongst them all, or they would themselves\ncome to terms with the Athenians and deliver up the city.\n\nThe government, aware of their inability to prevent this, and of the\ndanger they would be in, if left out of the capitulation, publicly\nagreed with Paches and the army to surrender Mitylene at discretion\nand to admit the troops into the town; upon the understanding that the\nMitylenians should be allowed to send an embassy to Athens to plead\ntheir cause, and that Paches should not imprison, make slaves of, or put\nto death any of the citizens until its return. Such were the terms of\nthe capitulation; in spite of which the chief authors of the negotiation\nwith Lacedaemon were so completely overcome by terror when the army\nentered that they went and seated themselves by the altars, from which\nthey were raised up by Paches under promise that he would do them no\nwrong, and lodged by him in Tenedos, until he should learn the pleasure\nof the Athenians concerning them. Paches also sent some galleys and\nseized Antissa, and took such other military measures as he thought\nadvisable.\n\nMeanwhile the Peloponnesians in the forty ships, who ought to have made\nall haste to relieve Mitylene, lost time in coming round Peloponnese\nitself, and proceeding leisurely on the remainder of the voyage, made\nDelos without having been seen by the Athenians at Athens, and from\nthence arriving at Icarus and Myconus, there first heard of the fall\nof Mitylene. Wishing to know the truth, they put into Embatum, in the\nErythraeid, about seven days after the capture of the town. Here they\nlearned the truth, and began to consider what they were to do; and\nTeutiaplus, an Elean, addressed them as follows:\n\n\"Alcidas and Peloponnesians who share with me the command of this\narmament, my advice is to sail just as we are to Mitylene, before we\nhave been heard of. We may expect to find the Athenians as much off\ntheir guard as men generally are who have just taken a city: this will\ncertainly be so by sea, where they have no idea of any enemy attacking\nthem, and where our strength, as it happens, mainly lies; while even\ntheir land forces are probably scattered about the houses in the\ncarelessness of victory. If therefore we were to fall upon them suddenly\nand in the night, I have hopes, with the help of the well-wishers that\nwe may have left inside the town, that we shall become masters of the\nplace. Let us not shrink from the risk, but let us remember that this is\njust the occasion for one of the baseless panics common in war: and that\nto be able to guard against these in one's own case, and to detect the\nmoment when an attack will find an enemy at this disadvantage, is what\nmakes a successful general.\"\n\nThese words of Teutiaplus failing to move Alcidas, some of the Ionian\nexiles and the Lesbians with the expedition began to urge him, since\nthis seemed too dangerous, to seize one of the Ionian cities or the\nAeolic town of Cyme, to use as a base for effecting the revolt of Ionia.\nThis was by no means a hopeless enterprise, as their coming was welcome\neverywhere; their object would be by this move to deprive Athens of\nher chief source of revenue, and at the same time to saddle her with\nexpense, if she chose to blockade them; and they would probably induce\nPissuthnes to join them in the war. However, Alcidas gave this proposal\nas bad a reception as the other, being eager, since he had come too late\nfor Mitylene, to find himself back in Peloponnese as soon as possible.\n\nAccordingly he put out from Embatum and proceeded along shore; and\ntouching at the Teian town, Myonnesus, there butchered most of the\nprisoners that he had taken on his passage. Upon his coming to anchor at\nEphesus, envoys came to him from the Samians at Anaia, and told him that\nhe was not going the right way to free Hellas in massacring men who had\nnever raised a hand against him, and who were not enemies of his, but\nallies of Athens against their will, and that if he did not stop he\nwould turn many more friends into enemies than enemies into friends.\nAlcidas agreed to this, and let go all the Chians still in his hands and\nsome of the others that he had taken; the inhabitants, instead of flying\nat the sight of his vessels, rather coming up to them, taking them\nfor Athenian, having no sort of expectation that while the Athenians\ncommanded the sea Peloponnesian ships would venture over to Ionia.\n\nFrom Ephesus Alcidas set sail in haste and fled. He had been seen by\nthe Salaminian and Paralian galleys, which happened to be sailing from\nAthens, while still at anchor off Clarus; and fearing pursuit he now\nmade across the open sea, fully determined to touch nowhere, if he could\nhelp it, until he got to Peloponnese. Meanwhile news of him had come in\nto Paches from the Erythraeid, and indeed from all quarters. As Ionia\nwas unfortified, great fears were felt that the Peloponnesians coasting\nalong shore, even if they did not intend to stay, might make descents\nin passing and plunder the towns; and now the Paralian and Salaminian,\nhaving seen him at Clarus, themselves brought intelligence of the fact.\nPaches accordingly gave hot chase, and continued the pursuit as far as\nthe isle of Patmos, and then finding that Alcidas had got on too far to\nbe overtaken, came back again. Meanwhile he thought it fortunate that,\nas he had not fallen in with them out at sea, he had not overtaken them\nanywhere where they would have been forced to encamp, and so give him\nthe trouble of blockading them.\n\nOn his return along shore he touched, among other places, at Notium, the\nport of Colophon, where the Colophonians had settled after the capture\nof the upper town by Itamenes and the barbarians, who had been called in\nby certain individuals in a party quarrel. The capture of the town took\nplace about the time of the second Peloponnesian invasion of Attica.\nHowever, the refugees, after settling at Notium, again split up into\nfactions, one of which called in Arcadian and barbarian mercenaries\nfrom Pissuthnes and, entrenching these in a quarter apart, formed a new\ncommunity with the Median party of the Colophonians who joined them from\nthe upper town. Their opponents had retired into exile, and now called\nin Paches, who invited Hippias, the commander of the Arcadians in the\nfortified quarter, to a parley, upon condition that, if they could\nnot agree, he was to be put back safe and sound in the fortification.\nHowever, upon his coming out to him, he put him into custody, though not\nin chains, and attacked suddenly and took by surprise the fortification,\nand putting the Arcadians and the barbarians found in it to the sword,\nafterwards took Hippias into it as he had promised, and, as soon as he\nwas inside, seized him and shot him down. Paches then gave up Notium to\nthe Colophonians not of the Median party; and settlers were afterwards\nsent out from Athens, and the place colonized according to Athenian\nlaws, after collecting all the Colophonians found in any of the cities.\n\nArrived at Mitylene, Paches reduced Pyrrha and Eresus; and finding the\nLacedaemonian, Salaethus, in hiding in the town, sent him off to Athens,\ntogether with the Mitylenians that he had placed in Tenedos, and any\nother persons that he thought concerned in the revolt. He also sent\nback the greater part of his forces, remaining with the rest to settle\nMitylene and the rest of Lesbos as he thought best.\n\nUpon the arrival of the prisoners with Salaethus, the Athenians at once\nput the latter to death, although he offered, among other things, to\nprocure the withdrawal of the Peloponnesians from Plataea, which was\nstill under siege; and after deliberating as to what they should do with\nthe former, in the fury of the moment determined to put to death not\nonly the prisoners at Athens, but the whole adult male population of\nMitylene, and to make slaves of the women and children. It was remarked\nthat Mitylene had revolted without being, like the rest, subjected to\nthe empire; and what above all swelled the wrath of the Athenians was\nthe fact of the Peloponnesian fleet having ventured over to Ionia to her\nsupport, a fact which was held to argue a long meditated rebellion.\nThey accordingly sent a galley to communicate the decree to Paches,\ncommanding him to lose no time in dispatching the Mitylenians. The\nmorrow brought repentance with it and reflection on the horrid cruelty\nof a decree, which condemned a whole city to the fate merited only by\nthe guilty. This was no sooner perceived by the Mitylenian ambassadors\nat Athens and their Athenian supporters, than they moved the authorities\nto put the question again to the vote; which they the more easily\nconsented to do, as they themselves plainly saw that most of the\ncitizens wished some one to give them an opportunity for reconsidering\nthe matter. An assembly was therefore at once called, and after much\nexpression of opinion upon both sides, Cleon, son of Cleaenetus, the\nsame who had carried the former motion of putting the Mitylenians to\ndeath, the most violent man at Athens, and at that time by far the most\npowerful with the commons, came forward again and spoke as follows:\n\n\"I have often before now been convinced that a democracy is incapable\nof empire, and never more so than by your present change of mind in the\nmatter of Mitylene. Fears or plots being unknown to you in your daily\nrelations with each other, you feel just the same with regard to your\nallies, and never reflect that the mistakes into which you may be led by\nlistening to their appeals, or by giving way to your own compassion, are\nfull of danger to yourselves, and bring you no thanks for your weakness\nfrom your allies; entirely forgetting that your empire is a despotism\nand your subjects disaffected conspirators, whose obedience is ensured\nnot by your suicidal concessions, but by the superiority given you by\nyour own strength and not their loyalty. The most alarming feature in\nthe case is the constant change of measures with which we appear to be\nthreatened, and our seeming ignorance of the fact that bad laws which\nare never changed are better for a city than good ones that have no\nauthority; that unlearned loyalty is more serviceable than quick-witted\ninsubordination; and that ordinary men usually manage public affairs\nbetter than their more gifted fellows. The latter are always wanting to\nappear wiser than the laws, and to overrule every proposition brought\nforward, thinking that they cannot show their wit in more important\nmatters, and by such behaviour too often ruin their country; while those\nwho mistrust their own cleverness are content to be less learned than\nthe laws, and less able to pick holes in the speech of a good speaker;\nand being fair judges rather than rival athletes, generally conduct\naffairs successfully. These we ought to imitate, instead of being led on\nby cleverness and intellectual rivalry to advise your people against our\nreal opinions.\n\n\"For myself, I adhere to my former opinion, and wonder at those who have\nproposed to reopen the case of the Mitylenians, and who are thus causing\na delay which is all in favour of the guilty, by making the sufferer\nproceed against the offender with the edge of his anger blunted;\nalthough where vengeance follows most closely upon the wrong, it best\nequals it and most amply requites it. I wonder also who will be the man\nwho will maintain the contrary, and will pretend to show that the crimes\nof the Mitylenians are of service to us, and our misfortunes injurious\nto the allies. Such a man must plainly either have such confidence in\nhis rhetoric as to adventure to prove that what has been once for all\ndecided is still undetermined, or be bribed to try to delude us by\nelaborate sophisms. In such contests the state gives the rewards to\nothers, and takes the dangers for herself. The persons to blame are\nyou who are so foolish as to institute these contests; who go to see an\noration as you would to see a sight, take your facts on hearsay, judge\nof the practicability of a project by the wit of its advocates, and\ntrust for the truth as to past events not to the fact which you saw\nmore than to the clever strictures which you heard; the easy victims of\nnew-fangled arguments, unwilling to follow received conclusions; slaves\nto every new paradox, despisers of the commonplace; the first wish of\nevery man being that he could speak himself, the next to rival those who\ncan speak by seeming to be quite up with their ideas by applauding\nevery hit almost before it is made, and by being as quick in catching\nan argument as you are slow in foreseeing its consequences; asking, if\nI may so say, for something different from the conditions under which\nwe live, and yet comprehending inadequately those very conditions;\nvery slaves to the pleasure of the ear, and more like the audience of a\nrhetorician than the council of a city.\n\n\"In order to keep you from this, I proceed to show that no one state has\never injured you as much as Mitylene. I can make allowance for those who\nrevolt because they cannot bear our empire, or who have been forced\nto do so by the enemy. But for those who possessed an island with\nfortifications; who could fear our enemies only by sea, and there had\ntheir own force of galleys to protect them; who were independent and\nheld in the highest honour by you--to act as these have done, this\nis not revolt--revolt implies oppression; it is deliberate and wanton\naggression; an attempt to ruin us by siding with our bitterest enemies;\na worse offence than a war undertaken on their own account in the\nacquisition of power. The fate of those of their neighbours who had\nalready rebelled and had been subdued was no lesson to them; their own\nprosperity could not dissuade them from affronting danger; but blindly\nconfident in the future, and full of hopes beyond their power though\nnot beyond their ambition, they declared war and made their decision to\nprefer might to right, their attack being determined not by provocation\nbut by the moment which seemed propitious. The truth is that great\ngood fortune coming suddenly and unexpectedly tends to make a people\ninsolent; in most cases it is safer for mankind to have success in\nreason than out of reason; and it is easier for them, one may say, to\nstave off adversity than to preserve prosperity. Our mistake has been\nto distinguish the Mitylenians as we have done: had they been long\nago treated like the rest, they never would have so far forgotten\nthemselves, human nature being as surely made arrogant by consideration\nas it is awed by firmness. Let them now therefore be punished as their\ncrime requires, and do not, while you condemn the aristocracy, absolve\nthe people. This is certain, that all attacked you without distinction,\nalthough they might have come over to us and been now again in\npossession of their city. But no, they thought it safer to throw in\ntheir lot with the aristocracy and so joined their rebellion! Consider\ntherefore: if you subject to the same punishment the ally who is forced\nto rebel by the enemy, and him who does so by his own free choice, which\nof them, think you, is there that will not rebel upon the slightest\npretext; when the reward of success is freedom, and the penalty of\nfailure nothing so very terrible? We meanwhile shall have to risk our\nmoney and our lives against one state after another; and if successful,\nshall receive a ruined town from which we can no longer draw the revenue\nupon which our strength depends; while if unsuccessful, we shall have\nan enemy the more upon our hands, and shall spend the time that might be\nemployed in combating our existing foes in warring with our own allies.\n\n\"No hope, therefore, that rhetoric may instil or money purchase, of the\nmercy due to human infirmity must be held out to the Mitylenians. Their\noffence was not involuntary, but of malice and deliberate; and mercy\nis only for unwilling offenders. I therefore, now as before, persist\nagainst your reversing your first decision, or giving way to the\nthree failings most fatal to empire--pity, sentiment, and indulgence.\nCompassion is due to those who can reciprocate the feeling, not to those\nwho will never pity us in return, but are our natural and necessary\nfoes: the orators who charm us with sentiment may find other less\nimportant arenas for their talents, in the place of one where the city\npays a heavy penalty for a momentary pleasure, themselves receiving fine\nacknowledgments for their fine phrases; while indulgence should be shown\ntowards those who will be our friends in future, instead of towards men\nwho will remain just what they were, and as much our enemies as before.\nTo sum up shortly, I say that if you follow my advice you will do what\nis just towards the Mitylenians, and at the same time expedient;\nwhile by a different decision you will not oblige them so much as pass\nsentence upon yourselves. For if they were right in rebelling, you must\nbe wrong in ruling. However, if, right or wrong, you determine to rule,\nyou must carry out your principle and punish the Mitylenians as your\ninterest requires; or else you must give up your empire and cultivate\nhonesty without danger. Make up your minds, therefore, to give them\nlike for like; and do not let the victims who escaped the plot be more\ninsensible than the conspirators who hatched it; but reflect what\nthey would have done if victorious over you, especially they were the\naggressors. It is they who wrong their neighbour without a cause, that\npursue their victim to the death, on account of the danger which they\nforesee in letting their enemy survive; since the object of a wanton\nwrong is more dangerous, if he escape, than an enemy who has not this to\ncomplain of. Do not, therefore, be traitors to yourselves, but recall\nas nearly as possible the moment of suffering and the supreme importance\nwhich you then attached to their reduction; and now pay them back in\ntheir turn, without yielding to present weakness or forgetting the peril\nthat once hung over you. Punish them as they deserve, and teach your\nother allies by a striking example that the penalty of rebellion is\ndeath. Let them once understand this and you will not have so often to\nneglect your enemies while you are fighting with your own confederates.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Cleon. After him Diodotus, son of Eucrates, who\nhad also in the previous assembly spoken most strongly against putting\nthe Mitylenians to death, came forward and spoke as follows:\n\n\"I do not blame the persons who have reopened the case of the\nMitylenians, nor do I approve the protests which we have heard against\nimportant questions being frequently debated. I think the two things\nmost opposed to good counsel are haste and passion; haste usually goes\nhand in hand with folly, passion with coarseness and narrowness of mind.\nAs for the argument that speech ought not to be the exponent of action,\nthe man who uses it must be either senseless or interested: senseless\nif he believes it possible to treat of the uncertain future through any\nother medium; interested if, wishing to carry a disgraceful measure and\ndoubting his ability to speak well in a bad cause, he thinks to\nfrighten opponents and hearers by well-aimed calumny. What is still more\nintolerable is to accuse a speaker of making a display in order to be\npaid for it. If ignorance only were imputed, an unsuccessful speaker\nmight retire with a reputation for honesty, if not for wisdom; while the\ncharge of dishonesty makes him suspected, if successful, and thought, if\ndefeated, not only a fool but a rogue. The city is no gainer by such a\nsystem, since fear deprives it of its advisers; although in truth, if\nour speakers are to make such assertions, it would be better for the\ncountry if they could not speak at all, as we should then make fewer\nblunders. The good citizen ought to triumph not by frightening his\nopponents but by beating them fairly in argument; and a wise city,\nwithout over-distinguishing its best advisers, will nevertheless\nnot deprive them of their due, and, far from punishing an unlucky\ncounsellor, will not even regard him as disgraced. In this way\nsuccessful orators would be least tempted to sacrifice their convictions\nto popularity, in the hope of still higher honours, and unsuccessful\nspeakers to resort to the same popular arts in order to win over the\nmultitude.\n\n\"This is not our way; and, besides, the moment that a man is suspected\nof giving advice, however good, from corrupt motives, we feel such a\ngrudge against him for the gain which after all we are not certain he\nwill receive, that we deprive the city of its certain benefit. Plain\ngood advice has thus come to be no less suspected than bad; and the\nadvocate of the most monstrous measures is not more obliged to use\ndeceit to gain the people, than the best counsellor is to lie in order\nto be believed. The city and the city only, owing to these refinements,\ncan never be served openly and without disguise; he who does serve it\nopenly being always suspected of serving himself in some secret way in\nreturn. Still, considering the magnitude of the interests involved, and\nthe position of affairs, we orators must make it our business to look\na little farther than you who judge offhand; especially as we, your\nadvisers, are responsible, while you, our audience, are not so. For if\nthose who gave the advice, and those who took it, suffered equally, you\nwould judge more calmly; as it is, you visit the disasters into which\nthe whim of the moment may have led you upon the single person of your\nadviser, not upon yourselves, his numerous companions in error.\n\n\"However, I have not come forward either to oppose or to accuse in the\nmatter of Mitylene; indeed, the question before us as sensible men is\nnot their guilt, but our interests. Though I prove them ever so guilty,\nI shall not, therefore, advise their death, unless it be expedient;\nnor though they should have claims to indulgence, shall I recommend it,\nunless it be dearly for the good of the country. I consider that we are\ndeliberating for the future more than for the present; and where Cleon\nis so positive as to the useful deterrent effects that will follow from\nmaking rebellion capital, I, who consider the interests of the future\nquite as much as he, as positively maintain the contrary. And I require\nyou not to reject my useful considerations for his specious ones: his\nspeech may have the attraction of seeming the more just in your present\ntemper against Mitylene; but we are not in a court of justice, but in a\npolitical assembly; and the question is not justice, but how to make the\nMitylenians useful to Athens.\n\n\"Now of course communities have enacted the penalty of death for many\noffences far lighter than this: still hope leads men to venture, and no\none ever yet put himself in peril without the inward conviction that he\nwould succeed in his design. Again, was there ever city rebelling that\ndid not believe that it possessed either in itself or in its alliances\nresources adequate to the enterprise? All, states and individuals, are\nalike prone to err, and there is no law that will prevent them; or\nwhy should men have exhausted the list of punishments in search of\nenactments to protect them from evildoers? It is probable that in early\ntimes the penalties for the greatest offences were less severe, and\nthat, as these were disregarded, the penalty of death has been by\ndegrees in most cases arrived at, which is itself disregarded in like\nmanner. Either then some means of terror more terrible than this must be\ndiscovered, or it must be owned that this restraint is useless; and that\nas long as poverty gives men the courage of necessity, or plenty fills\nthem with the ambition which belongs to insolence and pride, and the\nother conditions of life remain each under the thraldom of some fatal\nand master passion, so long will the impulse never be wanting to drive\nmen into danger. Hope also and cupidity, the one leading and the other\nfollowing, the one conceiving the attempt, the other suggesting the\nfacility of succeeding, cause the widest ruin, and, although invisible\nagents, are far stronger than the dangers that are seen. Fortune,\ntoo, powerfully helps the delusion and, by the unexpected aid that she\nsometimes lends, tempts men to venture with inferior means; and this is\nespecially the case with communities, because the stakes played for are\nthe highest, freedom or empire, and, when all are acting together, each\nman irrationally magnifies his own capacity. In fine, it is impossible\nto prevent, and only great simplicity can hope to prevent, human nature\ndoing what it has once set its mind upon, by force of law or by any\nother deterrent force whatsoever.\n\n\"We must not, therefore, commit ourselves to a false policy through a\nbelief in the efficacy of the punishment of death, or exclude rebels\nfrom the hope of repentance and an early atonement of their error.\nConsider a moment. At present, if a city that has already revolted\nperceive that it cannot succeed, it will come to terms while it is still\nable to refund expenses, and pay tribute afterwards. In the other case,\nwhat city, think you, would not prepare better than is now done, and\nhold out to the last against its besiegers, if it is all one whether it\nsurrender late or soon? And how can it be otherwise than hurtful to us\nto be put to the expense of a siege, because surrender is out of the\nquestion; and if we take the city, to receive a ruined town from which\nwe can no longer draw the revenue which forms our real strength against\nthe enemy? We must not, therefore, sit as strict judges of the offenders\nto our own prejudice, but rather see how by moderate chastisements we\nmay be enabled to benefit in future by the revenue-producing powers\nof our dependencies; and we must make up our minds to look for our\nprotection not to legal terrors but to careful administration. At\npresent we do exactly the opposite. When a free community, held\nin subjection by force, rises, as is only natural, and asserts its\nindependence, it is no sooner reduced than we fancy ourselves obliged\nto punish it severely; although the right course with freemen is not to\nchastise them rigorously when they do rise, but rigorously to watch them\nbefore they rise, and to prevent their ever entertaining the idea,\nand, the insurrection suppressed, to make as few responsible for it as\npossible.\n\n\"Only consider what a blunder you would commit in doing as Cleon\nrecommends. As things are at present, in all the cities the people\nis your friend, and either does not revolt with the oligarchy, or, if\nforced to do so, becomes at once the enemy of the insurgents; so that in\nthe war with the hostile city you have the masses on your side. But\nif you butcher the people of Mitylene, who had nothing to do with\nthe revolt, and who, as soon as they got arms, of their own motion\nsurrendered the town, first you will commit the crime of killing your\nbenefactors; and next you will play directly into the hands of the\nhigher classes, who when they induce their cities to rise, will\nimmediately have the people on their side, through your having announced\nin advance the same punishment for those who are guilty and for those\nwho are not. On the contrary, even if they were guilty, you ought to\nseem not to notice it, in order to avoid alienating the only class\nstill friendly to us. In short, I consider it far more useful for the\npreservation of our empire voluntarily to put up with injustice, than\nto put to death, however justly, those whom it is our interest to keep\nalive. As for Cleon's idea that in punishment the claims of justice and\nexpediency can both be satisfied, facts do not confirm the possibility\nof such a combination.\n\n\"Confess, therefore, that this is the wisest course, and without\nconceding too much either to pity or to indulgence, by neither of which\nmotives do I any more than Cleon wish you to be influenced, upon the\nplain merits of the case before you, be persuaded by me to try calmly\nthose of the Mitylenians whom Paches sent off as guilty, and to leave\nthe rest undisturbed. This is at once best for the future, and most\nterrible to your enemies at the present moment; inasmuch as good policy\nagainst an adversary is superior to the blind attacks of brute force.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Diodotus. The two opinions thus expressed were\nthe ones that most directly contradicted each other; and the Athenians,\nnotwithstanding their change of feeling, now proceeded to a division,\nin which the show of hands was almost equal, although the motion of\nDiodotus carried the day. Another galley was at once sent off in haste,\nfor fear that the first might reach Lesbos in the interval, and the\ncity be found destroyed; the first ship having about a day and a\nnight's start. Wine and barley-cakes were provided for the vessel by the\nMitylenian ambassadors, and great promises made if they arrived in time;\nwhich caused the men to use such diligence upon the voyage that they\ntook their meals of barley-cakes kneaded with oil and wine as they\nrowed, and only slept by turns while the others were at the oar. Luckily\nthey met with no contrary wind, and the first ship making no haste\nupon so horrid an errand, while the second pressed on in the manner\ndescribed, the first arrived so little before them, that Paches had\nonly just had time to read the decree, and to prepare to execute the\nsentence, when the second put into port and prevented the massacre. The\ndanger of Mitylene had indeed been great.\n\nThe other party whom Paches had sent off as the prime movers in the\nrebellion, were upon Cleon's motion put to death by the Athenians, the\nnumber being rather more than a thousand. The Athenians also demolished\nthe walls of the Mitylenians, and took possession of their ships.\nAfterwards tribute was not imposed upon the Lesbians; but all their\nland, except that of the Methymnians, was divided into three thousand\nallotments, three hundred of which were reserved as sacred for the gods,\nand the rest assigned by lot to Athenian shareholders, who were sent out\nto the island. With these the Lesbians agreed to pay a rent of two\nminae a year for each allotment, and cultivated the land themselves. The\nAthenians also took possession of the towns on the continent belonging\nto the Mitylenians, which thus became for the future subject to Athens.\nSuch were the events that took place at Lesbos.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_Fifth Year of the War--Trial and Execution of the Plataeans--\nCorcyraean Revolution_\n\nDuring the same summer, after the reduction of Lesbos, the Athenians\nunder Nicias, son of Niceratus, made an expedition against the island\nof Minoa, which lies off Megara and was used as a fortified post by the\nMegarians, who had built a tower upon it. Nicias wished to enable the\nAthenians to maintain their blockade from this nearer station instead\nof from Budorum and Salamis; to stop the Peloponnesian galleys and\nprivateers sailing out unobserved from the island, as they had been in\nthe habit of doing; and at the same time prevent anything from coming\ninto Megara. Accordingly, after taking two towers projecting on the side\nof Nisaea, by engines from the sea, and clearing the entrance into the\nchannel between the island and the shore, he next proceeded to cut off\nall communication by building a wall on the mainland at the point where\na bridge across a morass enabled succours to be thrown into the island,\nwhich was not far off from the continent. A few days sufficing to\naccomplish this, he afterwards raised some works in the island also, and\nleaving a garrison there, departed with his forces.\n\nAbout the same time in this summer, the Plataeans, being now without\nprovisions and unable to support the siege, surrendered to the\nPeloponnesians in the following manner. An assault had been made upon\nthe wall, which the Plataeans were unable to repel. The Lacedaemonian\ncommander, perceiving their weakness, wished to avoid taking the place\nby storm; his instructions from Lacedaemon having been so conceived, in\norder that if at any future time peace should be made with Athens, and\nthey should agree each to restore the places that they had taken in the\nwar, Plataea might be held to have come over voluntarily, and not be\nincluded in the list. He accordingly sent a herald to them to ask\nif they were willing voluntarily to surrender the town to the\nLacedaemonians, and accept them as their judges, upon the understanding\nthat the guilty should be punished, but no one without form of law. The\nPlataeans were now in the last state of weakness, and the herald had\nno sooner delivered his message than they surrendered the town. The\nPeloponnesians fed them for some days until the judges from Lacedaemon,\nwho were five in number, arrived. Upon their arrival no charge was\npreferred; they simply called up the Plataeans, and asked them whether\nthey had done the Lacedaemonians and allies any service in the war\nthen raging. The Plataeans asked leave to speak at greater length,\nand deputed two of their number to represent them: Astymachus, son of\nAsopolaus, and Lacon, son of Aeimnestus, proxenus of the Lacedaemonians,\nwho came forward and spoke as follows:\n\n\"Lacedaemonians, when we surrendered our city we trusted in you, and\nlooked forward to a trial more agreeable to the forms of law than the\npresent, to which we had no idea of being subjected; the judges also in\nwhose hands we consented to place ourselves were you, and you only (from\nwhom we thought we were most likely to obtain justice), and not other\npersons, as is now the case. As matters stand, we are afraid that we\nhave been doubly deceived. We have good reason to suspect, not only that\nthe issue to be tried is the most terrible of all, but that you will not\nprove impartial; if we may argue from the fact that no accusation was\nfirst brought forward for us to answer, but we had ourselves to ask\nleave to speak, and from the question being put so shortly, that a true\nanswer to it tells against us, while a false one can be contradicted. In\nthis dilemma, our safest, and indeed our only course, seems to be to say\nsomething at all risks: placed as we are, we could scarcely be silent\nwithout being tormented by the damning thought that speaking might have\nsaved us. Another difficulty that we have to encounter is the difficulty\nof convincing you. Were we unknown to each other we might profit by\nbringing forward new matter with which you were unacquainted: as it is,\nwe can tell you nothing that you do not know already, and we fear, not\nthat you have condemned us in your own minds of having failed in our\nduty towards you, and make this our crime, but that to please a third\nparty we have to submit to a trial the result of which is already\ndecided. Nevertheless, we will place before you what we can justly urge,\nnot only on the question of the quarrel which the Thebans have against\nus, but also as addressing you and the rest of the Hellenes; and we will\nremind you of our good services, and endeavour to prevail with you.\n\n\"To your short question, whether we have done the Lacedaemonians and\nallies any service in this war, we say, if you ask us as enemies, that\nto refrain from serving you was not to do you injury; if as friends,\nthat you are more in fault for having marched against us. During the\npeace, and against the Mede, we acted well: we have not now been the\nfirst to break the peace, and we were the only Boeotians who then joined\nin defending against the Mede the liberty of Hellas. Although an inland\npeople, we were present at the action at Artemisium; in the battle that\ntook place in our territory we fought by the side of yourselves and\nPausanias; and in all the other Hellenic exploits of the time we took\na part quite out of proportion to our strength. Besides, you, as\nLacedaemonians, ought not to forget that at the time of the great panic\nat Sparta, after the earthquake, caused by the secession of the Helots\nto Ithome, we sent the third part of our citizens to assist you.\n\n\"On these great and historical occasions such was the part that we\nchose, although afterwards we became your enemies. For this you were to\nblame. When we asked for your alliance against our Theban oppressors,\nyou rejected our petition, and told us to go to the Athenians who were\nour neighbours, as you lived too far off. In the war we never have done\nto you, and never should have done to you, anything unreasonable. If we\nrefused to desert the Athenians when you asked us, we did no wrong; they\nhad helped us against the Thebans when you drew back, and we could no\nlonger give them up with honour; especially as we had obtained their\nalliance and had been admitted to their citizenship at our own request,\nand after receiving benefits at their hands; but it was plainly our duty\nloyally to obey their orders. Besides, the faults that either of you may\ncommit in your supremacy must be laid, not upon the followers, but on\nthe chiefs that lead them astray.\n\n\"With regard to the Thebans, they have wronged us repeatedly, and\ntheir last aggression, which has been the means of bringing us into our\npresent position, is within your own knowledge. In seizing our city in\ntime of peace, and what is more at a holy time in the month, they justly\nencountered our vengeance, in accordance with the universal law which\nsanctions resistance to an invader; and it cannot now be right that we\nshould suffer on their account. By taking your own immediate interest\nand their animosity as the test of justice, you will prove yourselves to\nbe rather waiters on expediency than judges of right; although if they\nseem useful to you now, we and the rest of the Hellenes gave you\nmuch more valuable help at a time of greater need. Now you are the\nassailants, and others fear you; but at the crisis to which we allude,\nwhen the barbarian threatened all with slavery, the Thebans were on\nhis side. It is just, therefore, to put our patriotism then against\nour error now, if error there has been; and you will find the merit\noutweighing the fault, and displayed at a juncture when there were few\nHellenes who would set their valour against the strength of Xerxes,\nand when greater praise was theirs who preferred the dangerous path of\nhonour to the safe course of consulting their own interest with respect\nto the invasion. To these few we belonged, and highly were we honoured\nfor it; and yet we now fear to perish by having again acted on the same\nprinciples, and chosen to act well with Athens sooner than wisely with\nSparta. Yet in justice the same cases should be decided in the same way,\nand policy should not mean anything else than lasting gratitude for\nthe service of good ally combined with a proper attention to one's own\nimmediate interest.\n\n\"Consider also that at present the Hellenes generally regard you as a\npattern of worth and honour; and if you pass an unjust sentence upon us\nin this which is no obscure cause, but one in which you, the judges,\nare as illustrious as we, the prisoners, are blameless, take care\nthat displeasure be not felt at an unworthy decision in the matter of\nhonourable men made by men yet more honourable than they, and at the\nconsecration in the national temples of spoils taken from the\nPlataeans, the benefactors of Hellas. Shocking indeed will it seem for\nLacedaemonians to destroy Plataea, and for the city whose name your\nfathers inscribed upon the tripod at Delphi for its good service, to\nbe by you blotted out from the map of Hellas, to please the Thebans. To\nsuch a depth of misfortune have we fallen that, while the Medes' success\nhad been our ruin, Thebans now supplant us in your once fond regards;\nand we have been subjected to two dangers, the greatest of any--that of\ndying of starvation then, if we had not surrendered our town, and now of\nbeing tried for our lives. So that we Plataeans, after exertions beyond\nour power in the cause of the Hellenes, are rejected by all, forsaken\nand unassisted; helped by none of our allies, and reduced to doubt the\nstability of our only hope, yourselves.\n\n\"Still, in the name of the gods who once presided over our confederacy,\nand of our own good service in the Hellenic cause, we adjure you to\nrelent; to recall the decision which we fear that the Thebans may have\nobtained from you; to ask back the gift that you have given them, that\nthey disgrace not you by slaying us; to gain a pure instead of a guilty\ngratitude, and not to gratify others to be yourselves rewarded with\nshame. Our lives may be quickly taken, but it will be a heavy task to\nwipe away the infamy of the deed; as we are no enemies whom you might\njustly punish, but friends forced into taking arms against you. To grant\nus our lives would be, therefore, a righteous judgment; if you consider\nalso that we are prisoners who surrendered of their own accord,\nstretching out our hands for quarter, whose slaughter Hellenic law\nforbids, and who besides were always your benefactors. Look at the\nsepulchres of your fathers, slain by the Medes and buried in our\ncountry, whom year by year we honoured with garments and all other dues,\nand the first-fruits of all that our land produced in their season,\nas friends from a friendly country and allies to our old companions\nin arms. Should you not decide aright, your conduct would be the very\nopposite to ours. Consider only: Pausanias buried them thinking that he\nwas laying them in friendly ground and among men as friendly; but you,\nif you kill us and make the Plataean territory Theban, will leave\nyour fathers and kinsmen in a hostile soil and among their murderers,\ndeprived of the honours which they now enjoy. What is more, you will\nenslave the land in which the freedom of the Hellenes was won, make\ndesolate the temples of the gods to whom they prayed before they\novercame the Medes, and take away your ancestral sacrifices from those\nwho founded and instituted them.\n\n\"It were not to your glory, Lacedaemonians, either to offend in this way\nagainst the common law of the Hellenes and against your own ancestors,\nor to kill us your benefactors to gratify another's hatred without\nhaving been wronged yourselves: it were more so to spare us and to yield\nto the impressions of a reasonable compassion; reflecting not merely\non the awful fate in store for us, but also on the character of the\nsufferers, and on the impossibility of predicting how soon misfortune\nmay fall even upon those who deserve it not. We, as we have a right to\ndo and as our need impels us, entreat you, calling aloud upon the gods\nat whose common altar all the Hellenes worship, to hear our request, to\nbe not unmindful of the oaths which your fathers swore, and which we\nnow plead--we supplicate you by the tombs of your fathers, and appeal\nto those that are gone to save us from falling into the hands of the\nThebans and their dearest friends from being given up to their most\ndetested foes. We also remind you of that day on which we did the most\nglorious deeds, by your fathers' sides, we who now on this are like to\nsuffer the most dreadful fate. Finally, to do what is necessary and\nyet most difficult for men in our situation--that is, to make an end of\nspeaking, since with that ending the peril of our lives draws near--in\nconclusion we say that we did not surrender our city to the Thebans (to\nthat we would have preferred inglorious starvation), but trusted in and\ncapitulated to you; and it would be just, if we fail to persuade you, to\nput us back in the same position and let us take the chance that falls\nto us. And at the same time we adjure you not to give us up--your\nsuppliants, Lacedaemonians, out of your hands and faith, Plataeans\nforemost of the Hellenic patriots, to Thebans, our most hated\nenemies--but to be our saviours, and not, while you free the rest of the\nHellenes, to bring us to destruction.\"\n\nSuch were the words of the Plataeans. The Thebans, afraid that the\nLacedaemonians might be moved by what they had heard, came forward and\nsaid that they too desired to address them, since the Plataeans had,\nagainst their wish, been allowed to speak at length instead of being\nconfined to a simple answer to the question. Leave being granted, the\nThebans spoke as follows:\n\n\"We should never have asked to make this speech if the Plataeans on\ntheir side had contented themselves with shortly answering the question,\nand had not turned round and made charges against us, coupled with a\nlong defence of themselves upon matters outside the present inquiry and\nnot even the subject of accusation, and with praise of what no one\nfinds fault with. However, since they have done so, we must answer their\ncharges and refute their self-praise, in order that neither our bad name\nnor their good may help them, but that you may hear the real truth on\nboth points, and so decide.\n\n\"The origin of our quarrel was this. We settled Plataea some time after\nthe rest of Boeotia, together with other places out of which we had\ndriven the mixed population. The Plataeans not choosing to recognize our\nsupremacy, as had been first arranged, but separating themselves from\nthe rest of the Boeotians, and proving traitors to their nationality,\nwe used compulsion; upon which they went over to the Athenians, and with\nthem did as much harm, for which we retaliated.\n\n\"Next, when the barbarian invaded Hellas, they say that they were the\nonly Boeotians who did not Medize; and this is where they most glorify\nthemselves and abuse us. We say that if they did not Medize, it was\nbecause the Athenians did not do so either; just as afterwards when the\nAthenians attacked the Hellenes they, the Plataeans, were again the only\nBoeotians who Atticized. And yet consider the forms of our respective\ngovernments when we so acted. Our city at that juncture had neither an\noligarchical constitution in which all the nobles enjoyed equal\nrights, nor a democracy, but that which is most opposed to law and good\ngovernment and nearest a tyranny--the rule of a close cabal. These,\nhoping to strengthen their individual power by the success of the Mede,\nkept down by force the people, and brought him into the town. The city\nas a whole was not its own mistress when it so acted, and ought not to\nbe reproached for the errors that it committed while deprived of its\nconstitution. Examine only how we acted after the departure of the Mede\nand the recovery of the constitution; when the Athenians attacked the\nrest of Hellas and endeavoured to subjugate our country, of the greater\npart of which faction had already made them masters. Did not we fight\nand conquer at Coronea and liberate Boeotia, and do we not now actively\ncontribute to the liberation of the rest, providing horses to the cause\nand a force unequalled by that of any other state in the confederacy?\n\n\"Let this suffice to excuse us for our Medism. We will now endeavour\nto show that you have injured the Hellenes more than we, and are more\ndeserving of condign punishment. It was in defence against us, say you,\nthat you became allies and citizens of Athens. If so, you ought only\nto have called in the Athenians against us, instead of joining them in\nattacking others: it was open to you to do this if you ever felt that\nthey were leading you where you did not wish to follow, as Lacedaemon\nwas already your ally against the Mede, as you so much insist; and this\nwas surely sufficient to keep us off, and above all to allow you to\ndeliberate in security. Nevertheless, of your own choice and without\ncompulsion you chose to throw your lot in with Athens. And you say that\nit had been base for you to betray your benefactors; but it was surely\nfar baser and more iniquitous to sacrifice the whole body of the\nHellenes, your fellow confederates, who were liberating Hellas, than the\nAthenians only, who were enslaving it. The return that you made them was\ntherefore neither equal nor honourable, since you called them in, as you\nsay, because you were being oppressed yourselves, and then became their\naccomplices in oppressing others; although baseness rather consists in\nnot returning like for like than in not returning what is justly due but\nmust be unjustly paid.\n\n\"Meanwhile, after thus plainly showing that it was not for the sake\nof the Hellenes that you alone then did not Medize, but because the\nAthenians did not do so either, and you wished to side with them and\nto be against the rest; you now claim the benefit of good deeds done\nto please your neighbours. This cannot be admitted: you chose the\nAthenians, and with them you must stand or fall. Nor can you plead the\nleague then made and claim that it should now protect you. You abandoned\nthat league, and offended against it by helping instead of hindering the\nsubjugation of the Aeginetans and others of its members, and that not\nunder compulsion, but while in enjoyment of the same institutions that\nyou enjoy to the present hour, and no one forcing you as in our case.\nLastly, an invitation was addressed to you before you were blockaded\nto be neutral and join neither party: this you did not accept. Who then\nmerit the detestation of the Hellenes more justly than you, you who\nsought their ruin under the mask of honour? The former virtues that you\nallege you now show not to be proper to your character; the real bent of\nyour nature has been at length damningly proved: when the Athenians took\nthe path of injustice you followed them.\n\n\"Of our unwilling Medism and your wilful Atticizing this then is our\nexplanation. The last wrong wrong of which you complain consists in our\nhaving, as you say, lawlessly invaded your town in time of peace and\nfestival. Here again we cannot think that we were more in fault than\nyourselves. If of our own proper motion we made an armed attack upon\nyour city and ravaged your territory, we are guilty; but if the first\nmen among you in estate and family, wishing to put an end to the foreign\nconnection and to restore you to the common Boeotian country, of their\nown free will invited us, wherein is our crime? Where wrong is done,\nthose who lead, as you say, are more to blame than those who follow. Not\nthat, in our judgment, wrong was done either by them or by us. Citizens\nlike yourselves, and with more at stake than you, they opened their own\nwalls and introduced us into their own city, not as foes but as friends,\nto prevent the bad among you from becoming worse; to give honest men\ntheir due; to reform principles without attacking persons, since\nyou were not to be banished from your city, but brought home to your\nkindred, nor to be made enemies to any, but friends alike to all.\n\n\"That our intention was not hostile is proved by our behaviour. We did\nno harm to any one, but publicly invited those who wished to live under\na national, Boeotian government to come over to us; which as first you\ngladly did, and made an agreement with us and remained tranquil, until\nyou became aware of the smallness of our numbers. Now it is possible\nthat there may have been something not quite fair in our entering\nwithout the consent of your commons. At any rate you did not repay us in\nkind. Instead of refraining, as we had done, from violence, and inducing\nus to retire by negotiation, you fell upon us in violation of your\nagreement, and slew some of us in fight, of which we do not so much\ncomplain, for in that there was a certain justice; but others who held\nout their hands and received quarter, and whose lives you subsequently\npromised us, you lawlessly butchered. If this was not abominable, what\nis? And after these three crimes committed one after the other--the\nviolation of your agreement, the murder of the men afterwards, and the\nlying breach of your promise not to kill them, if we refrained from\ninjuring your property in the country--you still affirm that we are the\ncriminals and yourselves pretend to escape justice. Not so, if these\nyour judges decide aright, but you will be punished for all together.\n\n\"Such, Lacedaemonians, are the facts. We have gone into them at some\nlength both on your account and on our own, that you may fed that\nyou will justly condemn the prisoners, and we, that we have given an\nadditional sanction to our vengeance. We would also prevent you from\nbeing melted by hearing of their past virtues, if any such they had:\nthese may be fairly appealed to by the victims of injustice, but only\naggravate the guilt of criminals, since they offend against their better\nnature. Nor let them gain anything by crying and wailing, by calling\nupon your fathers' tombs and their own desolate condition. Against this\nwe point to the far more dreadful fate of our youth, butchered at their\nhands; the fathers of whom either fell at Coronea, bringing Boeotia over\nto you, or seated, forlorn old men by desolate hearths, with far more\nreason implore your justice upon the prisoners. The pity which they\nappeal to is rather due to men who suffer unworthily; those who suffer\njustly as they do are on the contrary subjects for triumph. For their\npresent desolate condition they have themselves to blame, since they\nwilfully rejected the better alliance. Their lawless act was not\nprovoked by any action of ours: hate, not justice, inspired their\ndecision; and even now the satisfaction which they afford us is not\nadequate; they will suffer by a legal sentence, not as they pretend\nas suppliants asking for quarter in battle, but as prisoners who have\nsurrendered upon agreement to take their trial. Vindicate, therefore,\nLacedaemonians, the Hellenic law which they have broken; and to us, the\nvictims of its violation, grant the reward merited by our zeal. Nor let\nus be supplanted in your favour by their harangues, but offer an example\nto the Hellenes, that the contests to which you invite them are of\ndeeds, not words: good deeds can be shortly stated, but where wrong is\ndone a wealth of language is needed to veil its deformity. However, if\nleading powers were to do what you are now doing, and putting one short\nquestion to all alike were to decide accordingly, men would be less\ntempted to seek fine phrases to cover bad actions.\"\n\nSuch were the words of the Thebans. The Lacedaemonian judges decided\nthat the question whether they had received any service from the\nPlataeans in the war, was a fair one for them to put; as they had\nalways invited them to be neutral, agreeably to the original covenant of\nPausanias after the defeat of the Mede, and had again definitely offered\nthem the same conditions before the blockade. This offer having\nbeen refused, they were now, they conceived, by the loyalty of their\nintention released from their covenant; and having, as they considered,\nsuffered evil at the hands of the Plataeans, they brought them in again\none by one and asked each of them the same question, that is to say,\nwhether they had done the Lacedaemonians and allies any service in the\nwar; and upon their saying that they had not, took them out and slew\nthem, all without exception. The number of Plataeans thus massacred was\nnot less than two hundred, with twenty-five Athenians who had shared in\nthe siege. The women were taken as slaves. The city the Thebans gave\nfor about a year to some political emigrants from Megara and to the\nsurviving Plataeans of their own party to inhabit, and afterwards razed\nit to the ground from the very foundations, and built on to the precinct\nof Hera an inn two hundred feet square, with rooms all round above\nand below, making use for this purpose of the roofs and doors of the\nPlataeans: of the rest of the materials in the wall, the brass and the\niron, they made couches which they dedicated to Hera, for whom they also\nbuilt a stone chapel of a hundred feet square. The land they confiscated\nand let out on a ten years' lease to Theban occupiers. The adverse\nattitude of the Lacedaemonians in the whole Plataean affair was mainly\nadopted to please the Thebans, who were thought to be useful in the war\nat that moment raging. Such was the end of Plataea, in the ninety-third\nyear after she became the ally of Athens.\n\nMeanwhile, the forty ships of the Peloponnesians that had gone to the\nrelief of the Lesbians, and which we left flying across the open\nsea, pursued by the Athenians, were caught in a storm off Crete, and\nscattering from thence made their way to Peloponnese, where they found\nat Cyllene thirteen Leucadian and Ambraciot galleys, with Brasidas, son\nof Tellis, lately arrived as counsellor to Alcidas; the Lacedaemonians,\nupon the failure of the Lesbian expedition, having resolved to\nstrengthen their fleet and sail to Corcyra, where a revolution had\nbroken out, so as to arrive there before the twelve Athenian ships at\nNaupactus could be reinforced from Athens. Brasidas and Alcidas began to\nprepare accordingly.\n\nThe Corcyraean revolution began with the return of the prisoners taken\nin the sea-fights off Epidamnus. These the Corinthians had released,\nnominally upon the security of eight hundred talents given by their\nproxeni, but in reality upon their engagement to bring over Corcyra to\nCorinth. These men proceeded to canvass each of the citizens, and to\nintrigue with the view of detaching the city from Athens. Upon the\narrival of an Athenian and a Corinthian vessel, with envoys on board, a\nconference was held in which the Corcyraeans voted to remain allies of\nthe Athenians according to their agreement, but to be friends of the\nPeloponnesians as they had been formerly. Meanwhile, the returned\nprisoners brought Peithias, a volunteer proxenus of the Athenians and\nleader of the commons, to trial, upon the charge of enslaving Corcyra to\nAthens. He, being acquitted, retorted by accusing five of the richest\nof their number of cutting stakes in the ground sacred to Zeus and\nAlcinous; the legal penalty being a stater for each stake. Upon their\nconviction, the amount of the penalty being very large, they seated\nthemselves as suppliants in the temples to be allowed to pay it by\ninstalments; but Peithias, who was one of the senate, prevailed upon\nthat body to enforce the law; upon which the accused, rendered desperate\nby the law, and also learning that Peithias had the intention, while\nstill a member of the senate, to persuade the people to conclude a\ndefensive and offensive alliance with Athens, banded together armed with\ndaggers, and suddenly bursting into the senate killed Peithias and sixty\nothers, senators and private persons; some few only of the party\nof Peithias taking refuge in the Athenian galley, which had not yet\ndeparted.\n\nAfter this outrage, the conspirators summoned the Corcyraeans to an\nassembly, and said that this would turn out for the best, and would\nsave them from being enslaved by Athens: for the future, they moved\nto receive neither party unless they came peacefully in a single ship,\ntreating any larger number as enemies. This motion made, they compelled\nit to be adopted, and instantly sent off envoys to Athens to justify\nwhat had been done and to dissuade the refugees there from any hostile\nproceedings which might lead to a reaction.\n\nUpon the arrival of the embassy, the Athenians arrested the envoys and\nall who listened to them, as revolutionists, and lodged them in Aegina.\nMeanwhile a Corinthian galley arriving in the island with Lacedaemonian\nenvoys, the dominant Corcyraean party attacked the commons and defeated\nthem in battle. Night coming on, the commons took refuge in the\nAcropolis and the higher parts of the city, and concentrated themselves\nthere, having also possession of the Hyllaic harbour; their adversaries\noccupying the market-place, where most of them lived, and the harbour\nadjoining, looking towards the mainland.\n\nThe next day passed in skirmishes of little importance, each party\nsending into the country to offer freedom to the slaves and to invite\nthem to join them. The mass of the slaves answered the appeal of the\ncommons; their antagonists being reinforced by eight hundred mercenaries\nfrom the continent.\n\nAfter a day's interval hostilities recommenced, victory remaining with\nthe commons, who had the advantage in numbers and position, the women\nalso valiantly assisting them, pelting with tiles from the houses, and\nsupporting the melee with a fortitude beyond their sex. Towards dusk,\nthe oligarchs in full rout, fearing that the victorious commons might\nassault and carry the arsenal and put them to the sword, fired the\nhouses round the marketplace and the lodging-houses, in order to bar\ntheir advance; sparing neither their own, nor those of their neighbours;\nby which much stuff of the merchants was consumed and the city risked\ntotal destruction, if a wind had come to help the flame by blowing on\nit. Hostilities now ceasing, both sides kept quiet, passing the night\non guard, while the Corinthian ship stole out to sea upon the victory\nof the commons, and most of the mercenaries passed over secretly to the\ncontinent.\n\nThe next day the Athenian general, Nicostratus, son of Diitrephes, came\nup from Naupactus with twelve ships and five hundred Messenian heavy\ninfantry. He at once endeavoured to bring about a settlement, and\npersuaded the two parties to agree together to bring to trial ten of the\nringleaders, who presently fled, while the rest were to live in\npeace, making terms with each other, and entering into a defensive and\noffensive alliance with the Athenians. This arranged, he was about to\nsail away, when the leaders of the commons induced him to leave them\nfive of his ships to make their adversaries less disposed to move, while\nthey manned and sent with him an equal number of their own. He had no\nsooner consented, than they began to enroll their enemies for the\nships; and these, fearing that they might be sent off to Athens, seated\nthemselves as suppliants in the temple of the Dioscuri. An attempt on\nthe part of Nicostratus to reassure them and to persuade them to rise\nproving unsuccessful, the commons armed upon this pretext, alleging\nthe refusal of their adversaries to sail with them as a proof of the\nhollowness of their intentions, and took their arms out of their houses,\nand would have dispatched some whom they fell in with, if Nicostratus\nhad not prevented it. The rest of the party, seeing what was going on,\nseated themselves as suppliants in the temple of Hera, being not less\nthan four hundred in number; until the commons, fearing that they might\nadopt some desperate resolution, induced them to rise, and conveyed them\nover to the island in front of the temple, where provisions were sent\nacross to them.\n\nAt this stage in the revolution, on the fourth or fifth day after the\nremoval of the men to the island, the Peloponnesian ships arrived from\nCyllene where they had been stationed since their return from Ionia,\nfifty-three in number, still under the command of Alcidas, but with\nBrasidas also on board as his adviser; and dropping anchor at Sybota, a\nharbour on the mainland, at daybreak made sail for Corcyra.\n\nThe Corcyraeans in great confusion and alarm at the state of things in\nthe city and at the approach of the invader, at once proceeded to equip\nsixty vessels, which they sent out, as fast as they were manned, against\nthe enemy, in spite of the Athenians recommending them to let them sail\nout first, and to follow themselves afterwards with all their ships\ntogether. Upon their vessels coming up to the enemy in this straggling\nfashion, two immediately deserted: in others the crews were fighting\namong themselves, and there was no order in anything that was done; so\nthat the Peloponnesians, seeing their confusion, placed twenty ships to\noppose the Corcyraeans, and ranged the rest against the twelve Athenian\nships, amongst which were the two vessels Salaminia and Paralus.\n\nWhile the Corcyraeans, attacking without judgment and in small\ndetachments, were already crippled by their own misconduct, the\nAthenians, afraid of the numbers of the enemy and of being surrounded,\ndid not venture to attack the main body or even the centre of the\ndivision opposed to them, but fell upon its wing and sank one vessel;\nafter which the Peloponnesians formed in a circle, and the Athenians\nrowed round them and tried to throw them into disorder. Perceiving this,\nthe division opposed to the Corcyraeans, fearing a repetition of the\ndisaster of Naupactus, came to support their friends, and the whole\nfleet now bore down, united, upon the Athenians, who retired before it,\nbacking water, retiring as leisurely as possible in order to give the\nCorcyraeans time to escape, while the enemy was thus kept occupied. Such\nwas the character of this sea-fight, which lasted until sunset.\n\nThe Corcyraeans now feared that the enemy would follow up their victory\nand sail against the town and rescue the men in the island, or strike\nsome other blow equally decisive, and accordingly carried the men\nover again to the temple of Hera, and kept guard over the city. The\nPeloponnesians, however, although victorious in the sea-fight, did not\nventure to attack the town, but took the thirteen Corcyraean vessels\nwhich they had captured, and with them sailed back to the continent\nfrom whence they had put out. The next day equally they refrained\nfrom attacking the city, although the disorder and panic were at their\nheight, and though Brasidas, it is said, urged Alcidas, his superior\nofficer, to do so, but they landed upon the promontory of Leukimme and\nlaid waste the country.\n\nMeanwhile the commons in Corcyra, being still in great fear of the fleet\nattacking them, came to a parley with the suppliants and their friends,\nin order to save the town; and prevailed upon some of them to go on\nboard the ships, of which they still manned thirty, against the expected\nattack. But the Peloponnesians after ravaging the country until midday\nsailed away, and towards nightfall were informed by beacon signals of\nthe approach of sixty Athenian vessels from Leucas, under the command of\nEurymedon, son of Thucles; which had been sent off by the Athenians upon\nthe news of the revolution and of the fleet with Alcidas being about to\nsail for Corcyra.\n\nThe Peloponnesians accordingly at once set off in haste by night for\nhome, coasting along shore; and hauling their ships across the Isthmus\nof Leucas, in order not to be seen doubling it, so departed. The\nCorcyraeans, made aware of the approach of the Athenian fleet and of the\ndeparture of the enemy, brought the Messenians from outside the walls\ninto the town, and ordered the fleet which they had manned to sail round\ninto the Hyllaic harbour; and while it was so doing, slew such of their\nenemies as they laid hands on, dispatching afterwards, as they landed\nthem, those whom they had persuaded to go on board the ships. Next they\nwent to the sanctuary of Hera and persuaded about fifty men to take\ntheir trial, and condemned them all to death. The mass of the suppliants\nwho had refused to do so, on seeing what was taking place, slew each\nother there in the consecrated ground; while some hanged themselves upon\nthe trees, and others destroyed themselves as they were severally\nable. During seven days that Eurymedon stayed with his sixty ships, the\nCorcyraeans were engaged in butchering those of their fellow citizens\nwhom they regarded as their enemies: and although the crime imputed was\nthat of attempting to put down the democracy, some were slain also for\nprivate hatred, others by their debtors because of the moneys owed to\nthem. Death thus raged in every shape; and, as usually happens at such\ntimes, there was no length to which violence did not go; sons were\nkilled by their fathers, and suppliants dragged from the altar or slain\nupon it; while some were even walled up in the temple of Dionysus and\ndied there.\n\nSo bloody was the march of the revolution, and the impression which it\nmade was the greater as it was one of the first to occur. Later on, one\nmay say, the whole Hellenic world was convulsed; struggles being every,\nwhere made by the popular chiefs to bring in the Athenians, and by the\noligarchs to introduce the Lacedaemonians. In peace there would have\nbeen neither the pretext nor the wish to make such an invitation; but\nin war, with an alliance always at the command of either faction for\nthe hurt of their adversaries and their own corresponding advantage,\nopportunities for bringing in the foreigner were never wanting to the\nrevolutionary parties. The sufferings which revolution entailed upon\nthe cities were many and terrible, such as have occurred and always will\noccur, as long as the nature of mankind remains the same; though in a\nseverer or milder form, and varying in their symptoms, according to the\nvariety of the particular cases. In peace and prosperity, states and\nindividuals have better sentiments, because they do not find themselves\nsuddenly confronted with imperious necessities; but war takes away the\neasy supply of daily wants, and so proves a rough master, that brings\nmost men's characters to a level with their fortunes. Revolution thus\nran its course from city to city, and the places which it arrived at\nlast, from having heard what had been done before, carried to a still\ngreater excess the refinement of their inventions, as manifested in the\ncunning of their enterprises and the atrocity of their reprisals. Words\nhad to change their ordinary meaning and to take that which was now\ngiven them. Reckless audacity came to be considered the courage of a\nloyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious cowardice; moderation was held\nto be a cloak for unmanliness; ability to see all sides of a question,\ninaptness to act on any. Frantic violence became the attribute of\nmanliness; cautious plotting, a justifiable means of self-defence. The\nadvocate of extreme measures was always trustworthy; his opponent a\nman to be suspected. To succeed in a plot was to have a shrewd head, to\ndivine a plot a still shrewder; but to try to provide against having\nto do either was to break up your party and to be afraid of your\nadversaries. In fine, to forestall an intending criminal, or to suggest\nthe idea of a crime where it was wanting, was equally commended until\neven blood became a weaker tie than party, from the superior readiness\nof those united by the latter to dare everything without reserve;\nfor such associations had not in view the blessings derivable from\nestablished institutions but were formed by ambition for their\noverthrow; and the confidence of their members in each other rested\nless on any religious sanction than upon complicity in crime. The fair\nproposals of an adversary were met with jealous precautions by the\nstronger of the two, and not with a generous confidence. Revenge\nalso was held of more account than self-preservation. Oaths of\nreconciliation, being only proffered on either side to meet an immediate\ndifficulty, only held good so long as no other weapon was at hand; but\nwhen opportunity offered, he who first ventured to seize it and to take\nhis enemy off his guard, thought this perfidious vengeance sweeter than\nan open one, since, considerations of safety apart, success by treachery\nwon him the palm of superior intelligence. Indeed it is generally the\ncase that men are readier to call rogues clever than simpletons honest,\nand are as ashamed of being the second as they are proud of being the\nfirst. The cause of all these evils was the lust for power arising from\ngreed and ambition; and from these passions proceeded the violence of\nparties once engaged in contention. The leaders in the cities, each\nprovided with the fairest professions, on the one side with the cry\nof political equality of the people, on the other of a moderate\naristocracy, sought prizes for themselves in those public interests\nwhich they pretended to cherish, and, recoiling from no means in their\nstruggles for ascendancy engaged in the direst excesses; in their acts\nof vengeance they went to even greater lengths, not stopping at what\njustice or the good of the state demanded, but making the party caprice\nof the moment their only standard, and invoking with equal readiness the\ncondemnation of an unjust verdict or the authority of the strong arm\nto glut the animosities of the hour. Thus religion was in honour with\nneither party; but the use of fair phrases to arrive at guilty ends was\nin high reputation. Meanwhile the moderate part of the citizens perished\nbetween the two, either for not joining in the quarrel, or because envy\nwould not suffer them to escape.\n\nThus every form of iniquity took root in the Hellenic countries by\nreason of the troubles. The ancient simplicity into which honour so\nlargely entered was laughed down and disappeared; and society became\ndivided into camps in which no man trusted his fellow. To put an end to\nthis, there was neither promise to be depended upon, nor oath that could\ncommand respect; but all parties dwelling rather in their calculation\nupon the hopelessness of a permanent state of things, were more intent\nupon self-defence than capable of confidence. In this contest\nthe blunter wits were most successful. Apprehensive of their own\ndeficiencies and of the cleverness of their antagonists, they feared to\nbe worsted in debate and to be surprised by the combinations of their\nmore versatile opponents, and so at once boldly had recourse to action:\nwhile their adversaries, arrogantly thinking that they should know\nin time, and that it was unnecessary to secure by action what policy\nafforded, often fell victims to their want of precaution.\n\nMeanwhile Corcyra gave the first example of most of the crimes alluded\nto; of the reprisals exacted by the governed who had never experienced\nequitable treatment or indeed aught but insolence from their\nrulers--when their hour came; of the iniquitous resolves of those who\ndesired to get rid of their accustomed poverty, and ardently coveted\ntheir neighbours' goods; and lastly, of the savage and pitiless excesses\ninto which men who had begun the struggle, not in a class but in a party\nspirit, were hurried by their ungovernable passions. In the confusion\ninto which life was now thrown in the cities, human nature, always\nrebelling against the law and now its master, gladly showed itself\nungoverned in passion, above respect for justice, and the enemy of all\nsuperiority; since revenge would not have been set above religion, and\ngain above justice, had it not been for the fatal power of envy. Indeed\nmen too often take upon themselves in the prosecution of their revenge\nto set the example of doing away with those general laws to which all\nalike can look for salvation in adversity, instead of allowing them to\nsubsist against the day of danger when their aid may be required.\n\nWhile the revolutionary passions thus for the first time displayed\nthemselves in the factions of Corcyra, Eurymedon and the Athenian fleet\nsailed away; after which some five hundred Corcyraean exiles who had\nsucceeded in escaping, took some forts on the mainland, and becoming\nmasters of the Corcyraean territory over the water, made this their base\nto Plunder their countrymen in the island, and did so much damage as to\ncause a severe famine in the town. They also sent envoys to Lacedaemon\nand Corinth to negotiate their restoration; but meeting with no success,\nafterwards got together boats and mercenaries and crossed over to the\nisland, being about six hundred in all; and burning their boats so as to\nhave no hope except in becoming masters of the country, went up to Mount\nIstone, and fortifying themselves there, began to annoy those in the\ncity and obtained command of the country.\n\nAt the close of the same summer the Athenians sent twenty ships\nunder the command of Laches, son of Melanopus, and Charoeades, son of\nEuphiletus, to Sicily, where the Syracusans and Leontines were at\nwar. The Syracusans had for allies all the Dorian cities except\nCamarina--these had been included in the Lacedaemonian confederacy from\nthe commencement of the war, though they had not taken any active part\nin it--the Leontines had Camarina and the Chalcidian cities. In Italy\nthe Locrians were for the Syracusans, the Rhegians for their Leontine\nkinsmen. The allies of the Leontines now sent to Athens and appealed\nto their ancient alliance and to their Ionian origin, to persuade the\nAthenians to send them a fleet, as the Syracusans were blockading them\nby land and sea. The Athenians sent it upon the plea of their common\ndescent, but in reality to prevent the exportation of Sicilian corn\nto Peloponnese and to test the possibility of bringing Sicily into\nsubjection. Accordingly they established themselves at Rhegium in Italy,\nand from thence carried on the war in concert with their allies.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_Year of the War--Campaigns of Demosthenes in Western Greece--Ruin of\nAmbracia_\n\nSummer was now over. The winter following, the plague a second time\nattacked the Athenians; for although it had never entirely left them,\nstill there had been a notable abatement in its ravages. The second\nvisit lasted no less than a year, the first having lasted two; and\nnothing distressed the Athenians and reduced their power more than this.\nNo less than four thousand four hundred heavy infantry in the ranks died\nof it and three hundred cavalry, besides a number of the multitude\nthat was never ascertained. At the same time took place the numerous\nearthquakes in Athens, Euboea, and Boeotia, particularly at Orchomenus\nin the last-named country.\n\nThe same winter the Athenians in Sicily and the Rhegians, with thirty\nships, made an expedition against the islands of Aeolus; it being\nimpossible to invade them in summer, owing to the want of water. These\nislands are occupied by the Liparaeans, a Cnidian colony, who live\nin one of them of no great size called Lipara; and from this as their\nheadquarters cultivate the rest, Didyme, Strongyle, and Hiera. In Hiera\nthe people in those parts believe that Hephaestus has his forge, from\nthe quantity of flame which they see it send out by night, and of smoke\nby day. These islands lie off the coast of the Sicels and Messinese, and\nwere allies of the Syracusans. The Athenians laid waste their land,\nand as the inhabitants did not submit, sailed back to Rhegium. Thus the\nwinter ended, and with it ended the fifth year of this war, of which\nThucydides was the historian.\n\nThe next summer the Peloponnesians and their allies set out to invade\nAttica under the command of Agis, son of Archidamus, and went as far\nas the Isthmus, but numerous earthquakes occurring, turned back again\nwithout the invasion taking place. About the same time that these\nearthquakes were so common, the sea at Orobiae, in Euboea, retiring from\nthe then line of coast, returned in a huge wave and invaded a great part\nof the town, and retreated leaving some of it still under water; so\nthat what was once land is now sea; such of the inhabitants perishing as\ncould not run up to the higher ground in time. A similar inundation\nalso occurred at Atalanta, the island off the Opuntian Locrian coast,\ncarrying away part of the Athenian fort and wrecking one of two ships\nwhich were drawn up on the beach. At Peparethus also the sea retreated\na little, without however any inundation following; and an earthquake\nthrew down part of the wall, the town hall, and a few other buildings.\nThe cause, in my opinion, of this phenomenon must be sought in the\nearthquake. At the point where its shock has been the most violent, the\nsea is driven back and, suddenly recoiling with redoubled force, causes\nthe inundation. Without an earthquake I do not see how such an accident\ncould happen.\n\nDuring the same summer different operations were carried on by the\ndifferent belligerents in Sicily; by the Siceliots themselves against\neach other, and by the Athenians and their allies: I shall however\nconfine myself to the actions in which the Athenians took part, choosing\nthe most important. The death of the Athenian general Charoeades, killed\nby the Syracusans in battle, left Laches in the sole command of the\nfleet, which he now directed in concert with the allies against Mylae,\na place belonging to the Messinese. Two Messinese battalions in garrison\nat Mylae laid an ambush for the party landing from the ships, but were\nrouted with great slaughter by the Athenians and their allies, who\nthereupon assaulted the fortification and compelled them to surrender\nthe Acropolis and to march with them upon Messina. This town afterwards\nalso submitted upon the approach of the Athenians and their allies, and\ngave hostages and all other securities required.\n\nThe same summer the Athenians sent thirty ships round Peloponnese under\nDemosthenes, son of Alcisthenes, and Procles, son of Theodorus, and\nsixty others, with two thousand heavy infantry, against Melos, under\nNicias, son of Niceratus; wishing to reduce the Melians, who, although\nislanders, refused to be subjects of Athens or even to join her\nconfederacy. The devastation of their land not procuring their\nsubmission, the fleet, weighing from Melos, sailed to Oropus in the\nterritory of Graea, and landing at nightfall, the heavy infantry started\nat once from the ships by land for Tanagra in Boeotia, where they were\nmet by the whole levy from Athens, agreeably to a concerted signal,\nunder the command of Hipponicus, son of Callias, and Eurymedon, son of\nThucles. They encamped, and passing that day in ravaging the Tanagraean\nterritory, remained there for the night; and next day, after defeating\nthose of the Tanagraeans who sailed out against them and some Thebans\nwho had come up to help the Tanagraeans, took some arms, set up a\ntrophy, and retired, the troops to the city and the others to the ships.\nNicias with his sixty ships coasted alongshore and ravaged the Locrian\nseaboard, and so returned home.\n\nAbout this time the Lacedaemonians founded their colony of Heraclea in\nTrachis, their object being the following: the Malians form in all three\ntribes, the Paralians, the Hiereans, and the Trachinians. The last\nof these having suffered severely in a war with their neighbours\nthe Oetaeans, at first intended to give themselves up to Athens; but\nafterwards fearing not to find in her the security that they sought,\nsent to Lacedaemon, having chosen Tisamenus for their ambassador. In\nthis embassy joined also the Dorians from the mother country of the\nLacedaemonians, with the same request, as they themselves also suffered\nfrom the same enemy. After hearing them, the Lacedaemonians determined\nto send out the colony, wishing to assist the Trachinians and Dorians,\nand also because they thought that the proposed town would lie\nconveniently for the purposes of the war against the Athenians. A fleet\nmight be got ready there against Euboea, with the advantage of a short\npassage to the island; and the town would also be useful as a station on\nthe road to Thrace. In short, everything made the Lacedaemonians\neager to found the place. After first consulting the god at Delphi and\nreceiving a favourable answer, they sent off the colonists, Spartans,\nand Perioeci, inviting also any of the rest of the Hellenes who might\nwish to accompany them, except Ionians, Achaeans, and certain other\nnationalities; three Lacedaemonians leading as founders of the colony,\nLeon, Alcidas, and Damagon. The settlement effected, they fortified anew\nthe city, now called Heraclea, distant about four miles and a half from\nThermopylae and two miles and a quarter from the sea, and commenced\nbuilding docks, closing the side towards Thermopylae just by the pass\nitself, in order that they might be easily defended.\n\nThe foundation of this town, evidently meant to annoy Euboea (the\npassage across to Cenaeum in that island being a short one), at first\ncaused some alarm at Athens, which the event however did nothing to\njustify, the town never giving them any trouble. The reason of this\nwas as follows. The Thessalians, who were sovereign in those parts, and\nwhose territory was menaced by its foundation, were afraid that it might\nprove a very powerful neighbour, and accordingly continually harassed\nand made war upon the new settlers, until they at last wore them out in\nspite of their originally considerable numbers, people flocking from\nall quarters to a place founded by the Lacedaemonians, and thus thought\nsecure of prosperity. On the other hand the Lacedaemonians themselves,\nin the persons of their governors, did their full share towards ruining\nits prosperity and reducing its population, as they frightened away the\ngreater part of the inhabitants by governing harshly and in some cases\nnot fairly, and thus made it easier for their neighbours to prevail\nagainst them.\n\nThe same summer, about the same time that the Athenians were detained\nat Melos, their fellow citizens in the thirty ships cruising round\nPeloponnese, after cutting off some guards in an ambush at Ellomenus in\nLeucadia, subsequently went against Leucas itself with a large armament,\nhaving been reinforced by the whole levy of the Acarnanians except\nOeniadae, and by the Zacynthians and Cephallenians and fifteen ships\nfrom Corcyra. While the Leucadians witnessed the devastation of their\nland, without and within the isthmus upon which the town of Leucas and\nthe temple of Apollo stand, without making any movement on account\nof the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, the Acarnanians urged\nDemosthenes, the Athenian general, to build a wall so as to cut off\nthe town from the continent, a measure which they were convinced would\nsecure its capture and rid them once and for all of a most troublesome\nenemy.\n\nDemosthenes however had in the meanwhile been persuaded by the\nMessenians that it was a fine opportunity for him, having so large an\narmy assembled, to attack the Aetolians, who were not only the enemies\nof Naupactus, but whose reduction would further make it easy to gain\nthe rest of that part of the continent for the Athenians. The Aetolian\nnation, although numerous and warlike, yet dwelt in unwalled villages\nscattered far apart, and had nothing but light armour, and might,\naccording to the Messenians, be subdued without much difficulty before\nsuccours could arrive. The plan which they recommended was to attack\nfirst the Apodotians, next the Ophionians, and after these the\nEurytanians, who are the largest tribe in Aetolia, and speak, as is\nsaid, a language exceedingly difficult to understand, and eat their\nflesh raw. These once subdued, the rest would easily come in.\n\nTo this plan Demosthenes consented, not only to please the Messenians,\nbut also in the belief that by adding the Aetolians to his other\ncontinental allies he would be able, without aid from home, to march\nagainst the Boeotians by way of Ozolian Locris to Kytinium in Doris,\nkeeping Parnassus on his right until he descended to the Phocians, whom\nhe could force to join him if their ancient friendship for Athens did\nnot, as he anticipated, at once decide them to do so. Arrived in Phocis\nhe was already upon the frontier of Boeotia. He accordingly weighed from\nLeucas, against the wish of the Acarnanians, and with his whole armament\nsailed along the coast to Sollium, where he communicated to them his\nintention; and upon their refusing to agree to it on account of the\nnon-investment of Leucas, himself with the rest of the forces, the\nCephallenians, the Messenians, and Zacynthians, and three hundred\nAthenian marines from his own ships (the fifteen Corcyraean vessels\nhaving departed), started on his expedition against the Aetolians. His\nbase he established at Oeneon in Locris, as the Ozolian Locrians were\nallies of Athens and were to meet him with all their forces in the\ninterior. Being neighbours of the Aetolians and armed in the same way,\nit was thought that they would be of great service upon the expedition,\nfrom their acquaintance with the localities and the warfare of the\ninhabitants.\n\nAfter bivouacking with the army in the precinct of Nemean Zeus, in\nwhich the poet Hesiod is said to have been killed by the people of the\ncountry, according to an oracle which had foretold that he should die in\nNemea, Demosthenes set out at daybreak to invade Aetolia. The first day\nhe took Potidania, the next Krokyle, and the third Tichium, where he\nhalted and sent back the booty to Eupalium in Locris, having determined\nto pursue his conquests as far as the Ophionians, and, in the event\nof their refusing to submit, to return to Naupactus and make them the\nobjects of a second expedition. Meanwhile the Aetolians had been aware\nof his design from the moment of its formation, and as soon as the army\ninvaded their country came up in great force with all their tribes;\neven the most remote Ophionians, the Bomiensians, and Calliensians, who\nextend towards the Malian Gulf, being among the number.\n\nThe Messenians, however, adhered to their original advice. Assuring\nDemosthenes that the Aetolians were an easy conquest, they urged him to\npush on as rapidly as possible, and to try to take the villages as fast\nas he came up to them, without waiting until the whole nation should be\nin arms against him. Led on by his advisers and trusting in his fortune,\nas he had met with no opposition, without waiting for his Locrian\nreinforcements, who were to have supplied him with the light-armed\ndarters in which he was most deficient, he advanced and stormed\nAegitium, the inhabitants flying before him and posting themselves upon\nthe hills above the town, which stood on high ground about nine miles\nfrom the sea. Meanwhile the Aetolians had gathered to the rescue, and\nnow attacked the Athenians and their allies, running down from the hills\non every side and darting their javelins, falling back when the Athenian\narmy advanced, and coming on as it retired; and for a long while the\nbattle was of this character, alternate advance and retreat, in both\nwhich operations the Athenians had the worst.\n\nStill as long as their archers had arrows left and were able to use\nthem, they held out, the light-armed Aetolians retiring before the\narrows; but after the captain of the archers had been killed and his men\nscattered, the soldiers, wearied out with the constant repetition of the\nsame exertions and hard pressed by the Aetolians with their javelins, at\nlast turned and fled, and falling into pathless gullies and places that\nthey were unacquainted with, thus perished, the Messenian Chromon,\ntheir guide, having also unfortunately been killed. A great many were\novertaken in the pursuit by the swift-footed and light-armed Aetolians,\nand fell beneath their javelins; the greater number however missed their\nroad and rushed into the wood, which had no ways out, and which was soon\nfired and burnt round them by the enemy. Indeed the Athenian army fell\nvictims to death in every form, and suffered all the vicissitudes of\nflight; the survivors escaped with difficulty to the sea and Oeneon in\nLocris, whence they had set out. Many of the allies were killed, and\nabout one hundred and twenty Athenian heavy infantry, not a man less,\nand all in the prime of life. These were by far the best men in the city\nof Athens that fell during this war. Among the slain was also Procles,\nthe colleague of Demosthenes. Meanwhile the Athenians took up their\ndead under truce from the Aetolians, and retired to Naupactus, and from\nthence went in their ships to Athens; Demosthenes staying behind in\nNaupactus and in the neighbourhood, being afraid to face the Athenians\nafter the disaster.\n\nAbout the same time the Athenians on the coast of Sicily sailed to\nLocris, and in a descent which they made from the ships defeated the\nLocrians who came against them, and took a fort upon the river Halex.\n\nThe same summer the Aetolians, who before the Athenian expedition had\nsent an embassy to Corinth and Lacedaemon, composed of Tolophus, an\nOphionian, Boriades, an Eurytanian, and Tisander, an Apodotian, obtained\nthat an army should be sent them against Naupactus, which had invited\nthe Athenian invasion. The Lacedaemonians accordingly sent off towards\nautumn three thousand heavy infantry of the allies, five hundred of whom\nwere from Heraclea, the newly founded city in Trachis, under the command\nof Eurylochus, a Spartan, accompanied by Macarius and Menedaius, also\nSpartans.\n\nThe army having assembled at Delphi, Eurylochus sent a herald to the\nOzolian Locrians; the road to Naupactus lying through their territory,\nand he having besides conceived the idea of detaching them from Athens.\nHis chief abettors in Locris were the Amphissians, who were alarmed at\nthe hostility of the Phocians. These first gave hostages themselves, and\ninduced the rest to do the same for fear of the invading army; first,\ntheir neighbours the Myonians, who held the most difficult of the\npasses, and after them the Ipnians, Messapians, Tritaeans, Chalaeans,\nTolophonians, Hessians, and Oeanthians, all of whom joined in the\nexpedition; the Olpaeans contenting themselves with giving hostages,\nwithout accompanying the invasion; and the Hyaeans refusing to do\neither, until the capture of Polis, one of their villages.\n\nHis preparations completed, Eurylochus lodged the hostages in Kytinium,\nin Doris, and advanced upon Naupactus through the country of the\nLocrians, taking upon his way Oeneon and Eupalium, two of their towns\nthat refused to join him. Arrived in the Naupactian territory, and\nhaving been now joined by the Aetolians, the army laid waste the land\nand took the suburb of the town, which was unfortified; and after this\nMolycrium also, a Corinthian colony subject to Athens. Meanwhile the\nAthenian Demosthenes, who since the affair in Aetolia had remained near\nNaupactus, having had notice of the army and fearing for the town, went\nand persuaded the Acarnanians, although not without difficulty because\nof his departure from Leucas, to go to the relief of Naupactus. They\naccordingly sent with him on board his ships a thousand heavy infantry,\nwho threw themselves into the place and saved it; the extent of its\nwall and the small number of its defenders otherwise placing it in the\ngreatest danger. Meanwhile Eurylochus and his companions, finding that\nthis force had entered and that it was impossible to storm the town,\nwithdrew, not to Peloponnese, but to the country once called Aeolis, and\nnow Calydon and Pleuron, and to the places in that neighbourhood, and\nProschium in Aetolia; the Ambraciots having come and urged them to\ncombine with them in attacking Amphilochian Argos and the rest of\nAmphilochia and Acarnania; affirming that the conquest of these\ncountries would bring all the continent into alliance with Lacedaemon.\nTo this Eurylochus consented, and dismissing the Aetolians, now remained\nquiet with his army in those parts, until the time should come for the\nAmbraciots to take the field, and for him to join them before Argos.\n\nSummer was now over. The winter ensuing, the Athenians in Sicily with\ntheir Hellenic allies, and such of the Sicel subjects or allies of\nSyracuse as had revolted from her and joined their army, marched\nagainst the Sicel town Inessa, the acropolis of which was held by\nthe Syracusans, and after attacking it without being able to take it,\nretired. In the retreat, the allies retreating after the Athenians were\nattacked by the Syracusans from the fort, and a large part of their army\nrouted with great slaughter. After this, Laches and the Athenians from\nthe ships made some descents in Locris, and defeating the Locrians,\nwho came against them with Proxenus, son of Capaton, upon the river\nCaicinus, took some arms and departed.\n\nThe same winter the Athenians purified Delos, in compliance, it appears,\nwith a certain oracle. It had been purified before by Pisistratus the\ntyrant; not indeed the whole island, but as much of it as could be seen\nfrom the temple. All of it was, however, now purified in the following\nway. All the sepulchres of those that had died in Delos were taken up,\nand for the future it was commanded that no one should be allowed either\nto die or to give birth to a child in the island; but that they should\nbe carried over to Rhenea, which is so near to Delos that Polycrates,\ntyrant of Samos, having added Rhenea to his other island conquests\nduring his period of naval ascendancy, dedicated it to the Delian Apollo\nby binding it to Delos with a chain.\n\nThe Athenians, after the purification, celebrated, for the first time,\nthe quinquennial festival of the Delian games. Once upon a time,\nindeed, there was a great assemblage of the Ionians and the neighbouring\nislanders at Delos, who used to come to the festival, as the Ionians\nnow do to that of Ephesus, and athletic and poetical contests took place\nthere, and the cities brought choirs of dancers. Nothing can be clearer\non this point than the following verses of Homer, taken from a hymn to\nApollo:\n\n   Phoebus, wherever thou strayest, far or near,\n   Delos was still of all thy haunts most dear.\n   Thither the robed Ionians take their way\n   With wife and child to keep thy holiday,\n   Invoke thy favour on each manly game,\n   And dance and sing in honour of thy name.\n\nThat there was also a poetical contest in which the Ionians went to\ncontend, again is shown by the following, taken from the same hymn.\nAfter celebrating the Delian dance of the women, he ends his song of\npraise with these verses, in which he also alludes to himself:\n\n   Well, may Apollo keep you all! and so,\n   Sweethearts, good-bye--yet tell me not I go\n   Out from your hearts; and if in after hours\n   Some other wanderer in this world of ours\n   Touch at your shores, and ask your maidens here\n   Who sings the songs the sweetest to your ear,\n   Think of me then, and answer with a smile,\n   'A blind old man of Scio's rocky isle.'\n\nHomer thus attests that there was anciently a great assembly and\nfestival at Delos. In later times, although the islanders and the\nAthenians continued to send the choirs of dancers with sacrifices, the\ncontests and most of the ceremonies were abolished, probably through\nadversity, until the Athenians celebrated the games upon this occasion\nwith the novelty of horse-races.\n\nThe same winter the Ambraciots, as they had promised Eurylochus when\nthey retained his army, marched out against Amphilochian Argos with\nthree thousand heavy infantry, and invading the Argive territory\noccupied Olpae, a stronghold on a hill near the sea, which had been\nformerly fortified by the Acarnanians and used as the place of assizes\nfor their nation, and which is about two miles and three-quarters from\nthe city of Argos upon the sea-coast. Meanwhile the Acarnanians went\nwith a part of their forces to the relief of Argos, and with the rest\nencamped in Amphilochia at the place called Crenae, or the Wells,\nto watch for Eurylochus and his Peloponnesians, and to prevent their\npassing through and effecting their junction with the Ambraciots;\nwhile they also sent for Demosthenes, the commander of the Aetolian\nexpedition, to be their leader, and for the twenty Athenian ships that\nwere cruising off Peloponnese under the command of Aristotle, son\nof Timocrates, and Hierophon, son of Antimnestus. On their part, the\nAmbraciots at Olpae sent a messenger to their own city, to beg them to\ncome with their whole levy to their assistance, fearing that the army of\nEurylochus might not be able to pass through the Acarnanians, and that\nthey might themselves be obliged to fight single-handed, or be unable to\nretreat, if they wished it, without danger.\n\nMeanwhile Eurylochus and his Peloponnesians, learning that the\nAmbraciots at Olpae had arrived, set out from Proschium with all haste\nto join them, and crossing the Achelous advanced through Acarnania,\nwhich they found deserted by its population, who had gone to the relief\nof Argos; keeping on their right the city of the Stratians and its\ngarrison, and on their left the rest of Acarnania. Traversing the\nterritory of the Stratians, they advanced through Phytia, next, skirting\nMedeon, through Limnaea; after which they left Acarnania behind them\nand entered a friendly country, that of the Agraeans. From thence they\nreached and crossed Mount Thymaus, which belongs to the Agraeans, and\ndescended into the Argive territory after nightfall, and passing\nbetween the city of Argos and the Acarnanian posts at Crenae, joined the\nAmbraciots at Olpae.\n\nUniting here at daybreak, they sat down at the place called Metropolis,\nand encamped. Not long afterwards the Athenians in the twenty ships came\ninto the Ambracian Gulf to support the Argives, with Demosthenes and two\nhundred Messenian heavy infantry, and sixty Athenian archers. While the\nfleet off Olpae blockaded the hill from the sea, the Acarnanians and a\nfew of the Amphilochians, most of whom were kept back by force by the\nAmbraciots, had already arrived at Argos, and were preparing to give\nbattle to the enemy, having chosen Demosthenes to command the whole of\nthe allied army in concert with their own generals. Demosthenes led them\nnear to Olpae and encamped, a great ravine separating the two armies.\nDuring five days they remained inactive; on the sixth both sides formed\nin order of battle. The army of the Peloponnesians was the largest and\noutflanked their opponents; and Demosthenes fearing that his right might\nbe surrounded, placed in ambush in a hollow way overgrown with bushes\nsome four hundred heavy infantry and light troops, who were to rise up\nat the moment of the onset behind the projecting left wing of the enemy,\nand to take them in the rear. When both sides were ready they joined\nbattle; Demosthenes being on the right wing with the Messenians and a\nfew Athenians, while the rest of the line was made up of the different\ndivisions of the Acarnanians, and of the Amphilochian carters. The\nPeloponnesians and Ambraciots were drawn up pell-mell together, with\nthe exception of the Mantineans, who were massed on the left, without\nhowever reaching to the extremity of the wing, where Eurylochus and his\nmen confronted the Messenians and Demosthenes.\n\nThe Peloponnesians were now well engaged and with their outflanking wing\nwere upon the point of turning their enemy's right; when the Acarnanians\nfrom the ambuscade set upon them from behind, and broke them at the\nfirst attack, without their staying to resist; while the panic into\nwhich they fell caused the flight of most of their army, terrified\nbeyond measure at seeing the division of Eurylochus and their best\ntroops cut to pieces. Most of the work was done by Demosthenes and his\nMessenians, who were posted in this part of the field. Meanwhile the\nAmbraciots (who are the best soldiers in those countries) and the troops\nupon the right wing, defeated the division opposed to them and pursued\nit to Argos. Returning from the pursuit, they found their main body\ndefeated; and hard pressed by the Acarnanians, with difficulty made good\ntheir passage to Olpae, suffering heavy loss on the way, as they dashed\non without discipline or order, the Mantineans excepted, who kept their\nranks best of any in the army during the retreat.\n\nThe battle did not end until the evening. The next day Menedaius, who on\nthe death of Eurylochus and Macarius had succeeded to the sole command,\nbeing at a loss after so signal a defeat how to stay and sustain a\nsiege, cut off as he was by land and by the Athenian fleet by sea, and\nequally so how to retreat in safety, opened a parley with Demosthenes\nand the Acarnanian generals for a truce and permission to retreat, and\nat the same time for the recovery of the dead. The dead they gave back\nto him, and setting up a trophy took up their own also to the number of\nabout three hundred. The retreat demanded they refused publicly to the\narmy; but permission to depart without delay was secretly granted to the\nMantineans and to Menedaius and the other commanders and principal men\nof the Peloponnesians by Demosthenes and his Acarnanian colleagues; who\ndesired to strip the Ambraciots and the mercenary host of foreigners of\ntheir supporters; and, above all, to discredit the Lacedaemonians\nand Peloponnesians with the Hellenes in those parts, as traitors and\nself-seekers.\n\nWhile the enemy was taking up his dead and hastily burying them as he\ncould, and those who obtained permission were secretly planning their\nretreat, word was brought to Demosthenes and the Acarnanians that the\nAmbraciots from the city, in compliance with the first message from\nOlpae, were on the march with their whole levy through Amphilochia to\njoin their countrymen at Olpae, knowing nothing of what had occurred.\nDemosthenes prepared to march with his army against them, and meanwhile\nsent on at once a strong division to beset the roads and occupy the\nstrong positions. In the meantime the Mantineans and others included\nin the agreement went out under the pretence of gathering herbs and\nfirewood, and stole off by twos and threes, picking on the way the\nthings which they professed to have come out for, until they had gone\nsome distance from Olpae, when they quickened their pace. The Ambraciots\nand such of the rest as had accompanied them in larger parties, seeing\nthem going on, pushed on in their turn, and began running in order to\ncatch them up. The Acarnanians at first thought that all alike were\ndeparting without permission, and began to pursue the Peloponnesians;\nand believing that they were being betrayed, even threw a dart or two at\nsome of their generals who tried to stop them and told them that leave\nhad been given. Eventually, however, they let pass the Mantineans and\nPeloponnesians, and slew only the Ambraciots, there being much dispute\nand difficulty in distinguishing whether a man was an Ambraciot or a\nPeloponnesian. The number thus slain was about two hundred; the rest\nescaped into the bordering territory of Agraea, and found refuge with\nSalynthius, the friendly king of the Agraeans.\n\nMeanwhile the Ambraciots from the city arrived at Idomene. Idomene\nconsists of two lofty hills, the higher of which the troops sent on by\nDemosthenes succeeded in occupying after nightfall, unobserved by the\nAmbraciots, who had meanwhile ascended the smaller and bivouacked under\nit. After supper Demosthenes set out with the rest of the army, as soon\nas it was evening; himself with half his force making for the pass, and\nthe remainder going by the Amphilochian hills. At dawn he fell upon the\nAmbraciots while they were still abed, ignorant of what had passed,\nand fully thinking that it was their own countrymen--Demosthenes having\npurposely put the Messenians in front with orders to address them in\nthe Doric dialect, and thus to inspire confidence in the sentinels,\nwho would not be able to see them as it was still night. In this way he\nrouted their army as soon as he attacked it, slaying most of them where\nthey were, the rest breaking away in flight over the hills. The roads,\nhowever, were already occupied, and while the Amphilochians knew their\nown country, the Ambraciots were ignorant of it and could not tell which\nway to turn, and had also heavy armour as against a light-armed enemy,\nand so fell into ravines and into the ambushes which had been set for\nthem, and perished there. In their manifold efforts to escape some even\nturned to the sea, which was not far off, and seeing the Athenian ships\ncoasting alongshore just while the action was going on, swam off to\nthem, thinking it better in the panic they were in, to perish, if perish\nthey must, by the hands of the Athenians, than by those of the barbarous\nand detested Amphilochians. Of the large Ambraciot force destroyed\nin this manner, a few only reached the city in safety; while the\nAcarnanians, after stripping the dead and setting up a trophy, returned\nto Argos.\n\nThe next day arrived a herald from the Ambraciots who had fled from\nOlpae to the Agraeans, to ask leave to take up the dead that had fallen\nafter the first engagement, when they left the camp with the Mantineans\nand their companions, without, like them, having had permission to do\nso. At the sight of the arms of the Ambraciots from the city, the herald\nwas astonished at their number, knowing nothing of the disaster and\nfancying that they were those of their own party. Some one asked him\nwhat he was so astonished at, and how many of them had been killed,\nfancying in his turn that this was the herald from the troops at\nIdomene. He replied: \"About two hundred\"; upon which his interrogator\ntook him up, saying: \"Why, the arms you see here are of more than a\nthousand.\" The herald replied: \"Then they are not the arms of those who\nfought with us?\" The other answered: \"Yes, they are, if at least you\nfought at Idomene yesterday.\" \"But we fought with no one yesterday;\nbut the day before in the retreat.\" \"However that may be, we fought\nyesterday with those who came to reinforce you from the city of the\nAmbraciots.\" When the herald heard this and knew that the reinforcement\nfrom the city had been destroyed, he broke into wailing and, stunned\nat the magnitude of the present evils, went away at once without having\nperformed his errand, or again asking for the dead bodies. Indeed, this\nwas by far the greatest disaster that befell any one Hellenic city in an\nequal number of days during this war; and I have not set down the number\nof the dead, because the amount stated seems so out of proportion to\nthe size of the city as to be incredible. In any case I know that if\nthe Acarnanians and Amphilochians had wished to take Ambracia as the\nAthenians and Demosthenes advised, they would have done so without a\nblow; as it was, they feared that if the Athenians had it they would be\nworse neighbours to them than the present.\n\nAfter this the Acarnanians allotted a third of the spoils to the\nAthenians, and divided the rest among their own different towns. The\nshare of the Athenians was captured on the voyage home; the arms now\ndeposited in the Attic temples are three hundred panoplies, which the\nAcarnanians set apart for Demosthenes, and which he brought to Athens\nin person, his return to his country after the Aetolian disaster being\nrendered less hazardous by this exploit. The Athenians in the twenty\nships also went off to Naupactus. The Acarnanians and Amphilochians,\nafter the departure of Demosthenes and the Athenians, granted the\nAmbraciots and Peloponnesians who had taken refuge with Salynthius\nand the Agraeans a free retreat from Oeniadae, to which place they had\nremoved from the country of Salynthius, and for the future concluded\nwith the Ambraciots a treaty and alliance for one hundred years,\nupon the terms following. It was to be a defensive, not an offensive\nalliance; the Ambraciots could not be required to march with the\nAcarnanians against the Peloponnesians, nor the Acarnanians with the\nAmbraciots against the Athenians; for the rest the Ambraciots were to\ngive up the places and hostages that they held of the Amphilochians,\nand not to give help to Anactorium, which was at enmity with the\nAcarnanians. With this arrangement they put an end to the war. After\nthis the Corinthians sent a garrison of their own citizens to Ambracia,\ncomposed of three hundred heavy infantry, under the command of\nXenocleides, son of Euthycles, who reached their destination after a\ndifficult journey across the continent. Such was the history of the\naffair of Ambracia.\n\nThe same winter the Athenians in Sicily made a descent from their\nships upon the territory of Himera, in concert with the Sicels, who had\ninvaded its borders from the interior, and also sailed to the islands\nof Aeolus. Upon their return to Rhegium they found the Athenian general,\nPythodorus, son of Isolochus, come to supersede Laches in the command\nof the fleet. The allies in Sicily had sailed to Athens and induced the\nAthenians to send out more vessels to their assistance, pointing out\nthat the Syracusans who already commanded their land were making efforts\nto get together a navy, to avoid being any longer excluded from the sea\nby a few vessels. The Athenians proceeded to man forty ships to send to\nthem, thinking that the war in Sicily would thus be the sooner\nended, and also wishing to exercise their navy. One of the generals,\nPythodorus, was accordingly sent out with a few ships; Sophocles, son\nof Sostratides, and Eurymedon, son of Thucles, being destined to follow\nwith the main body. Meanwhile Pythodorus had taken the command of\nLaches' ships, and towards the end of winter sailed against the Locrian\nfort, which Laches had formerly taken, and returned after being defeated\nin battle by the Locrians.\n\nIn the first days of this spring, the stream of fire issued from Etna,\nas on former occasions, and destroyed some land of the Catanians, who\nlive upon Mount Etna, which is the largest mountain in Sicily. Fifty\nyears, it is said, had elapsed since the last eruption, there having\nbeen three in all since the Hellenes have inhabited Sicily. Such were\nthe events of this winter; and with it ended the sixth year of this war,\nof which Thucydides was the historian.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n_Seventh Year of the War--Occupation of Pylos--Surrender of the Spartan\nArmy in Sphacteria_\n\nNext summer, about the time of the corn's coming into ear, ten Syracusan\nand as many Locrian vessels sailed to Messina, in Sicily, and occupied\nthe town upon the invitation of the inhabitants; and Messina revolted\nfrom the Athenians. The Syracusans contrived this chiefly because they\nsaw that the place afforded an approach to Sicily, and feared that the\nAthenians might hereafter use it as a base for attacking them with a\nlarger force; the Locrians because they wished to carry on hostilities\nfrom both sides of the strait and to reduce their enemies, the people of\nRhegium. Meanwhile, the Locrians had invaded the Rhegian territory with\nall their forces, to prevent their succouring Messina, and also at\nthe instance of some exiles from Rhegium who were with them; the long\nfactions by which that town had been torn rendering it for the moment\nincapable of resistance, and thus furnishing an additional temptation\nto the invaders. After devastating the country the Locrian land forces\nretired, their ships remaining to guard Messina, while others were being\nmanned for the same destination to carry on the war from thence.\n\nAbout the same time in the spring, before the corn was ripe, the\nPeloponnesians and their allies invaded Attica under Agis, the son of\nArchidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians, and sat down and laid waste the\ncountry. Meanwhile the Athenians sent off the forty ships which they\nhad been preparing to Sicily, with the remaining generals Eurymedon\nand Sophocles; their colleague Pythodorus having already preceded them\nthither. These had also instructions as they sailed by to look to the\nCorcyraeans in the town, who were being plundered by the exiles in the\nmountain. To support these exiles sixty Peloponnesian vessels had lately\nsailed, it being thought that the famine raging in the city would\nmake it easy for them to reduce it. Demosthenes also, who had remained\nwithout employment since his return from Acarnania, applied and\nobtained permission to use the fleet, if he wished it, upon the coast of\nPeloponnese.\n\nOff Laconia they heard that the Peloponnesian ships were already at\nCorcyra, upon which Eurymedon and Sophocles wished to hasten to the\nisland, but Demosthenes required them first to touch at Pylos and do\nwhat was wanted there, before continuing their voyage. While they were\nmaking objections, a squall chanced to come on and carried the fleet\ninto Pylos. Demosthenes at once urged them to fortify the place, it\nbeing for this that he had come on the voyage, and made them observe\nthere was plenty of stone and timber on the spot, and that the place\nwas strong by nature, and together with much of the country round\nunoccupied; Pylos, or Coryphasium, as the Lacedaemonians call it, being\nabout forty-five miles distant from Sparta, and situated in the old\ncountry of the Messenians. The commanders told him that there was no\nlack of desert headlands in Peloponnese if he wished to put the city\nto expense by occupying them. He, however, thought that this place was\ndistinguished from others of the kind by having a harbour close by;\nwhile the Messenians, the old natives of the country, speaking the same\ndialect as the Lacedaemonians, could do them the greatest mischief\nby their incursions from it, and would at the same time be a trusty\ngarrison.\n\nAfter speaking to the captains of companies on the subject, and failing\nto persuade either the generals or the soldiers, he remained inactive\nwith the rest from stress of weather; until the soldiers themselves\nwanting occupation were seized with a sudden impulse to go round and\nfortify the place. Accordingly they set to work in earnest, and having\nno iron tools, picked up stones, and put them together as they happened\nto fit, and where mortar was needed, carried it on their backs for want\nof hods, stooping down to make it stay on, and clasping their hands\ntogether behind to prevent it falling off; sparing no effort to be\nable to complete the most vulnerable points before the arrival of the\nLacedaemonians, most of the place being sufficiently strong by nature\nwithout further fortifications.\n\nMeanwhile the Lacedaemonians were celebrating a festival, and also at\nfirst made light of the news, in the idea that whenever they chose to\ntake the field the place would be immediately evacuated by the enemy or\neasily taken by force; the absence of their army before Athens having\nalso something to do with their delay. The Athenians fortified the\nplace on the land side, and where it most required it, in six days, and\nleaving Demosthenes with five ships to garrison it, with the main body\nof the fleet hastened on their voyage to Corcyra and Sicily.\n\nAs soon as the Peloponnesians in Attica heard of the occupation of\nPylos, they hurried back home; the Lacedaemonians and their king Agis\nthinking that the matter touched them nearly. Besides having made their\ninvasion early in the season, and while the corn was still green, most\nof their troops were short of provisions: the weather also was unusually\nbad for the time of year, and greatly distressed their army. Many\nreasons thus combined to hasten their departure and to make this\ninvasion a very short one; indeed they only stayed fifteen days in\nAttica.\n\nAbout the same time the Athenian general Simonides getting together a\nfew Athenians from the garrisons, and a number of the allies in those\nparts, took Eion in Thrace, a Mendaean colony and hostile to Athens, by\ntreachery, but had no sooner done so than the Chalcidians and Bottiaeans\ncame up and beat him out of it, with the loss of many of his soldiers.\n\nOn the return of the Peloponnesians from Attica, the Spartans themselves\nand the nearest of the Perioeci at once set out for Pylos, the other\nLacedaemonians following more slowly, as they had just come in from\nanother campaign. Word was also sent round Peloponnese to come up as\nquickly as possible to Pylos; while the sixty Peloponnesian ships were\nsent for from Corcyra, and being dragged by their crews across the\nisthmus of Leucas, passed unperceived by the Athenian squadron at\nZacynthus, and reached Pylos, where the land forces had arrived before\nthem. Before the Peloponnesian fleet sailed in, Demosthenes found time\nto send out unobserved two ships to inform Eurymedon and the Athenians\non board the fleet at Zacynthus of the danger of Pylos and to summon\nthem to his assistance. While the ships hastened on their voyage in\nobedience to the orders of Demosthenes, the Lacedaemonians prepared to\nassault the fort by land and sea, hoping to capture with ease a work\nconstructed in haste, and held by a feeble garrison. Meanwhile, as they\nexpected the Athenian ships to arrive from Zacynthus, they intended, if\nthey failed to take the place before, to block up the entrances of the\nharbour to prevent their being able to anchor inside it. For the island\nof Sphacteria, stretching along in a line close in front of the harbour,\nat once makes it safe and narrows its entrances, leaving a passage for\ntwo ships on the side nearest Pylos and the Athenian fortifications, and\nfor eight or nine on that next the rest of the mainland: for the rest,\nthe island was entirely covered with wood, and without paths through\nnot being inhabited, and about one mile and five furlongs in length.\nThe inlets the Lacedaemonians meant to close with a line of ships placed\nclose together, with their prows turned towards the sea, and, meanwhile,\nfearing that the enemy might make use of the island to operate against\nthem, carried over some heavy infantry thither, stationing others along\nthe coast. By this means the island and the continent would be alike\nhostile to the Athenians, as they would be unable to land on either; and\nthe shore of Pylos itself outside the inlet towards the open sea having\nno harbour, and, therefore, presenting no point which they could use as\na base to relieve their countrymen, they, the Lacedaemonians, without\nsea-fight or risk would in all probability become masters of the place,\noccupied as it had been on the spur of the moment, and unfurnished with\nprovisions. This being determined, they carried over to the island the\nheavy infantry, drafted by lot from all the companies. Some others had\ncrossed over before in relief parties, but these last who were\nleft there were four hundred and twenty in number, with their Helot\nattendants, commanded by Epitadas, son of Molobrus.\n\nMeanwhile Demosthenes, seeing the Lacedaemonians about to attack him\nby sea and land at once, himself was not idle. He drew up under the\nfortification and enclosed in a stockade the galleys remaining to him of\nthose which had been left him, arming the sailors taken out of them with\npoor shields made most of them of osier, it being impossible to procure\narms in such a desert place, and even these having been obtained from a\nthirty-oared Messenian privateer and a boat belonging to some Messenians\nwho happened to have come to them. Among these Messenians were forty\nheavy infantry, whom he made use of with the rest. Posting most of his\nmen, unarmed and armed, upon the best fortified and strong points of the\nplace towards the interior, with orders to repel any attack of the land\nforces, he picked sixty heavy infantry and a few archers from his whole\nforce, and with these went outside the wall down to the sea, where he\nthought that the enemy would most likely attempt to land. Although the\nground was difficult and rocky, looking towards the open sea, the fact\nthat this was the weakest part of the wall would, he thought, encourage\ntheir ardour, as the Athenians, confident in their naval superiority,\nhad here paid little attention to their defences, and the enemy if he\ncould force a landing might feel secure of taking the place. At this\npoint, accordingly, going down to the water's edge, he posted his heavy\ninfantry to prevent, if possible, a landing, and encouraged them in the\nfollowing terms:\n\n\"Soldiers and comrades in this adventure, I hope that none of you in our\npresent strait will think to show his wit by exactly calculating all the\nperils that encompass us, but that you will rather hasten to close with\nthe enemy, without staying to count the odds, seeing in this your best\nchance of safety. In emergencies like ours calculation is out of place;\nthe sooner the danger is faced the better. To my mind also most of the\nchances are for us, if we will only stand fast and not throw away our\nadvantages, overawed by the numbers of the enemy. One of the points in\nour favour is the awkwardness of the landing. This, however, only helps\nus if we stand our ground. If we give way it will be practicable enough,\nin spite of its natural difficulty, without a defender; and the enemy\nwill instantly become more formidable from the difficulty he will have\nin retreating, supposing that we succeed in repulsing him, which we\nshall find it easier to do, while he is on board his ships, than after\nhe has landed and meets us on equal terms. As to his numbers, these need\nnot too much alarm you. Large as they may be he can only engage in\nsmall detachments, from the impossibility of bringing to. Besides, the\nnumerical superiority that we have to meet is not that of an army on\nland with everything else equal, but of troops on board ship, upon an\nelement where many favourable accidents are required to act with effect.\nI therefore consider that his difficulties may be fairly set against our\nnumerical deficiencies, and at the same time I charge you, as Athenians\nwho know by experience what landing from ships on a hostile territory\nmeans, and how impossible it is to drive back an enemy determined enough\nto stand his ground and not to be frightened away by the surf and the\nterrors of the ships sailing in, to stand fast in the present emergency,\nbeat back the enemy at the water's edge, and save yourselves and the\nplace.\"\n\nThus encouraged by Demosthenes, the Athenians felt more confident, and\nwent down to meet the enemy, posting themselves along the edge of\nthe sea. The Lacedaemonians now put themselves in movement and\nsimultaneously assaulted the fortification with their land forces\nand with their ships, forty-three in number, under their admiral,\nThrasymelidas, son of Cratesicles, a Spartan, who made his attack just\nwhere Demosthenes expected. The Athenians had thus to defend themselves\non both sides, from the land and from the sea; the enemy rowing up in\nsmall detachments, the one relieving the other--it being impossible for\nmany to bring to at once--and showing great ardour and cheering\neach other on, in the endeavour to force a passage and to take the\nfortification. He who most distinguished himself was Brasidas. Captain\nof a galley, and seeing that the captains and steersmen, impressed by\nthe difficulty of the position, hung back even where a landing might\nhave seemed possible, for fear of wrecking their vessels, he shouted\nout to them, that they must never allow the enemy to fortify himself\nin their country for the sake of saving timber, but must shiver their\nvessels and force a landing; and bade the allies, instead of hesitating\nin such a moment to sacrifice their ships for Lacedaemon in return\nfor her many benefits, to run them boldly aground, land in one way or\nanother, and make themselves masters of the place and its garrison.\n\nNot content with this exhortation, he forced his own steersman to run\nhis ship ashore, and stepping on to the gangway, was endeavouring to\nland, when he was cut down by the Athenians, and after receiving many\nwounds fainted away. Falling into the bows, his shield slipped off\nhis arm into the sea, and being thrown ashore was picked up by the\nAthenians, and afterwards used for the trophy which they set up for this\nattack. The rest also did their best, but were not able to land, owing\nto the difficulty of the ground and the unflinching tenacity of\nthe Athenians. It was a strange reversal of the order of things for\nAthenians to be fighting from the land, and from Laconian land too,\nagainst Lacedaemonians coming from the sea; while Lacedaemonians were\ntrying to land from shipboard in their own country, now become hostile,\nto attack Athenians, although the former were chiefly famous at the\ntime as an inland people and superior by land, the latter as a maritime\npeople with a navy that had no equal.\n\nAfter continuing their attacks during that day and most of the next, the\nPeloponnesians desisted, and the day after sent some of their ships to\nAsine for timber to make engines, hoping to take by their aid, in spite\nof its height, the wall opposite the harbour, where the landing was\neasiest. At this moment the Athenian fleet from Zacynthus arrived, now\nnumbering fifty sail, having been reinforced by some of the ships on\nguard at Naupactus and by four Chian vessels. Seeing the coast and\nthe island both crowded with heavy infantry, and the hostile ships in\nharbour showing no signs of sailing out, at a loss where to anchor, they\nsailed for the moment to the desert island of Prote, not far off, where\nthey passed the night. The next day they got under way in readiness to\nengage in the open sea if the enemy chose to put out to meet them, being\ndetermined in the event of his not doing so to sail in and attack him.\nThe Lacedaemonians did not put out to sea, and having omitted to close\nthe inlets as they had intended, remained quiet on shore, engaged in\nmanning their ships and getting ready, in the case of any one sailing\nin, to fight in the harbour, which is a fairly large one.\n\nPerceiving this, the Athenians advanced against them by each inlet, and\nfalling on the enemy's fleet, most of which was by this time afloat and\nin line, at once put it to flight, and giving chase as far as the short\ndistance allowed, disabled a good many vessels and took five, one with\nits crew on board; dashing in at the rest that had taken refuge on\nshore, and battering some that were still being manned, before they\ncould put out, and lashing on to their own ships and towing off empty\nothers whose crews had fled. At this sight the Lacedaemonians, maddened\nby a disaster which cut off their men on the island, rushed to the\nrescue, and going into the sea with their heavy armour, laid hold of\nthe ships and tried to drag them back, each man thinking that success\ndepended on his individual exertions. Great was the melee, and quite\nin contradiction to the naval tactics usual to the two combatants; the\nLacedaemonians in their excitement and dismay being actually engaged in\na sea-fight on land, while the victorious Athenians, in their eagerness\nto push their success as far as possible, were carrying on a land-fight\nfrom their ships. After great exertions and numerous wounds on both\nsides they separated, the Lacedaemonians saving their empty ships,\nexcept those first taken; and both parties returning to their camp, the\nAthenians set up a trophy, gave back the dead, secured the wrecks, and\nat once began to cruise round and jealously watch the island, with its\nintercepted garrison, while the Peloponnesians on the mainland, whose\ncontingents had now all come up, stayed where they were before Pylos.\n\nWhen the news of what had happened at Pylos reached Sparta, the disaster\nwas thought so serious that the Lacedaemonians resolved that the\nauthorities should go down to the camp, and decide on the spot what was\nbest to be done. There, seeing that it was impossible to help their men,\nand not wishing to risk their being reduced by hunger or overpowered by\nnumbers, they determined, with the consent of the Athenian generals,\nto conclude an armistice at Pylos and send envoys to Athens to obtain\na convention, and to endeavour to get back their men as quickly as\npossible.\n\nThe generals accepting their offers, an armistice was concluded upon the\nterms following:\n\nThat the Lacedaemonians should bring to Pylos and deliver up to the\nAthenians the ships that had fought in the late engagement, and all\nin Laconia that were vessels of war, and should make no attack on the\nfortification either by land or by sea.\n\nThat the Athenians should allow the Lacedaemonians on the mainland to\nsend to the men in the island a certain fixed quantity of corn ready\nkneaded, that is to say, two quarts of barley meal, one pint of wine,\nand a piece of meat for each man, and half the same quantity for a\nservant.\n\nThat this allowance should be sent in under the eyes of the Athenians,\nand that no boat should sail to the island except openly.\n\nThat the Athenians should continue to the island same as before,\nwithout however landing upon it, and should refrain from attacking the\nPeloponnesian troops either by land or by sea.\n\nThat if either party should infringe any of these terms in the slightest\nparticular, the armistice should be at once void.\n\nThat the armistice should hold good until the return of the\nLacedaemonian envoys from Athens--the Athenians sending them thither\nin a galley and bringing them back again--and upon the arrival of the\nenvoys should be at an end, and the ships be restored by the Athenians\nin the same state as they received them.\n\nSuch were the terms of the armistice, and the ships were delivered over\nto the number of sixty, and the envoys sent off accordingly. Arrived at\nAthens they spoke as follows:\n\n\"Athenians, the Lacedaemonians sent us to try to find some way of\nsettling the affair of our men on the island, that shall be at once\nsatisfactory to our interests, and as consistent with our dignity in\nour misfortune as circumstances permit. We can venture to speak at some\nlength without any departure from the habit of our country. Men of few\nwords where many are not wanted, we can be less brief when there is a\nmatter of importance to be illustrated and an end to be served by its\nillustration. Meanwhile we beg you to take what we may say, not in a\nhostile spirit, nor as if we thought you ignorant and wished to\nlecture you, but rather as a suggestion on the best course to be taken,\naddressed to intelligent judges. You can now, if you choose, employ your\npresent success to advantage, so as to keep what you have got and gain\nhonour and reputation besides, and you can avoid the mistake of those\nwho meet with an extraordinary piece of good fortune, and are led on by\nhope to grasp continually at something further, through having already\nsucceeded without expecting it. While those who have known most\nvicissitudes of good and bad, have also justly least faith in their\nprosperity; and to teach your city and ours this lesson experience has\nnot been wanting.\n\n\"To be convinced of this you have only to look at our present\nmisfortune. What power in Hellas stood higher than we did? and yet we\nare come to you, although we formerly thought ourselves more able\nto grant what we are now here to ask. Nevertheless, we have not been\nbrought to this by any decay in our power, or through having our heads\nturned by aggrandizement; no, our resources are what they have always\nbeen, and our error has been an error of judgment, to which all are\nequally liable. Accordingly, the prosperity which your city now enjoys,\nand the accession that it has lately received, must not make you fancy\nthat fortune will be always with you. Indeed sensible men are prudent\nenough to treat their gains as precarious, just as they would also\nkeep a clear head in adversity, and think that war, so far from staying\nwithin the limit to which a combatant may wish to confine it, will run\nthe course that its chances prescribe; and thus, not being puffed up by\nconfidence in military success, they are less likely to come to grief,\nand most ready to make peace, if they can, while their fortune lasts.\nThis, Athenians, you have a good opportunity to do now with us, and thus\nto escape the possible disasters which may follow upon your refusal, and\nthe consequent imputation of having owed to accident even your present\nadvantages, when you might have left behind you a reputation for power\nand wisdom which nothing could endanger.\n\n\"The Lacedaemonians accordingly invite you to make a treaty and to end\nthe war, and offer peace and alliance and the most friendly and intimate\nrelations in every way and on every occasion between us; and in return\nask for the men on the island, thinking it better for both parties\nnot to stand out to the end, on the chance of some favourable accident\nenabling the men to force their way out, or of their being compelled\nto succumb under the pressure of blockade. Indeed if great enmities are\never to be really settled, we think it will be, not by the system of\nrevenge and military success, and by forcing an opponent to swear to a\ntreaty to his disadvantage, but when the more fortunate combatant waives\nthese his privileges, to be guided by gentler feelings conquers his\nrival in generosity, and accords peace on more moderate conditions than\nhe expected. From that moment, instead of the debt of revenge which\nviolence must entail, his adversary owes a debt of generosity to be paid\nin kind, and is inclined by honour to stand to his agreement. And men\noftener act in this manner towards their greatest enemies than where the\nquarrel is of less importance; they are also by nature as glad to give\nway to those who first yield to them, as they are apt to be provoked by\narrogance to risks condemned by their own judgment.\n\n\"To apply this to ourselves: if peace was ever desirable for both\nparties, it is surely so at the present moment, before anything\nirremediable befall us and force us to hate you eternally, personally\nas well as politically, and you to miss the advantages that we now offer\nyou. While the issue is still in doubt, and you have reputation and our\nfriendship in prospect, and we the compromise of our misfortune before\nanything fatal occur, let us be reconciled, and for ourselves choose\npeace instead of war, and grant to the rest of the Hellenes a remission\nfrom their sufferings, for which be sure they will think they have\nchiefly you to thank. The war that they labour under they know not which\nbegan, but the peace that concludes it, as it depends on your decision,\nwill by their gratitude be laid to your door. By such a decision you\ncan become firm friends with the Lacedaemonians at their own invitation,\nwhich you do not force from them, but oblige them by accepting. And from\nthis friendship consider the advantages that are likely to follow: when\nAttica and Sparta are at one, the rest of Hellas, be sure, will remain\nin respectful inferiority before its heads.\"\n\nSuch were the words of the Lacedaemonians, their idea being that the\nAthenians, already desirous of a truce and only kept back by their\nopposition, would joyfully accept a peace freely offered, and give back\nthe men. The Athenians, however, having the men on the island, thought\nthat the treaty would be ready for them whenever they chose to make it,\nand grasped at something further. Foremost to encourage them in this\npolicy was Cleon, son of Cleaenetus, a popular leader of the time\nand very powerful with the multitude, who persuaded them to answer as\nfollows: First, the men in the island must surrender themselves and\ntheir arms and be brought to Athens. Next, the Lacedaemonians must\nrestore Nisaea, Pegae, Troezen, and Achaia, all places acquired not by\narms, but by the previous convention, under which they had been ceded by\nAthens herself at a moment of disaster, when a truce was more necessary\nto her than at present. This done they might take back their men, and\nmake a truce for as long as both parties might agree.\n\nTo this answer the envoys made no reply, but asked that commissioners\nmight be chosen with whom they might confer on each point, and quietly\ntalk the matter over and try to come to some agreement. Hereupon Cleon\nviolently assailed them, saying that he knew from the first that they\nhad no right intentions, and that it was clear enough now by their\nrefusing to speak before the people, and wanting to confer in secret\nwith a committee of two or three. No, if they meant anything honest let\nthem say it out before all. The Lacedaemonians, however, seeing that\nwhatever concessions they might be prepared to make in their misfortune,\nit was impossible for them to speak before the multitude and lose credit\nwith their allies for a negotiation which might after all miscarry, and\non the other hand, that the Athenians would never grant what they\nasked upon moderate terms, returned from Athens without having effected\nanything.\n\nTheir arrival at once put an end to the armistice at Pylos, and the\nLacedaemonians asked back their ships according to the convention. The\nAthenians, however, alleged an attack on the fort in contravention of\nthe truce, and other grievances seemingly not worth mentioning, and\nrefused to give them back, insisting upon the clause by which the\nslightest infringement made the armistice void. The Lacedaemonians,\nafter denying the contravention and protesting against their bad faith\nin the matter of the ships, went away and earnestly addressed themselves\nto the war. Hostilities were now carried on at Pylos upon both sides\nwith vigour. The Athenians cruised round the island all day with two\nships going different ways; and by night, except on the seaward side in\nwindy weather, anchored round it with their whole fleet, which, having\nbeen reinforced by twenty ships from Athens come to aid in the blockade,\nnow numbered seventy sail; while the Peloponnesians remained encamped on\nthe continent, making attacks on the fort, and on the look-out for any\nopportunity which might offer itself for the deliverance of their men.\n\nMeanwhile the Syracusans and their allies in Sicily had brought up\nto the squadron guarding Messina the reinforcement which we left them\npreparing, and carried on the war from thence, incited chiefly by the\nLocrians from hatred of the Rhegians, whose territory they had invaded\nwith all their forces. The Syracusans also wished to try their fortune\nat sea, seeing that the Athenians had only a few ships actually at\nRhegium, and hearing that the main fleet destined to join them was\nengaged in blockading the island. A naval victory, they thought, would\nenable them to blockade Rhegium by sea and land, and easily to reduce\nit; a success which would at once place their affairs upon a solid\nbasis, the promontory of Rhegium in Italy and Messina in Sicily being so\nnear each other that it would be impossible for the Athenians to cruise\nagainst them and command the strait. The strait in question consists\nof the sea between Rhegium and Messina, at the point where Sicily\napproaches nearest to the continent, and is the Charybdis through which\nthe story makes Ulysses sail; and the narrowness of the passage and\nthe strength of the current that pours in from the vast Tyrrhenian and\nSicilian mains, have rightly given it a bad reputation.\n\nIn this strait the Syracusans and their allies were compelled to fight,\nlate in the day, about the passage of a boat, putting out with rather\nmore than thirty ships against sixteen Athenian and eight Rhegian\nvessels. Defeated by the Athenians they hastily set off, each for\nhimself, to their own stations at Messina and Rhegium, with the loss of\none ship; night coming on before the battle was finished. After this\nthe Locrians retired from the Rhegian territory, and the ships of the\nSyracusans and their allies united and came to anchor at Cape Pelorus,\nin the territory of Messina, where their land forces joined them. Here\nthe Athenians and Rhegians sailed up, and seeing the ships unmanned,\nmade an attack, in which they in their turn lost one vessel, which was\ncaught by a grappling iron, the crew saving themselves by swimming.\nAfter this the Syracusans got on board their ships, and while they were\nbeing towed alongshore to Messina, were again attacked by the Athenians,\nbut suddenly got out to sea and became the assailants, and caused them\nto lose another vessel. After thus holding their own in the voyage\nalongshore and in the engagement as above described, the Syracusans\nsailed on into the harbour of Messina.\n\nMeanwhile the Athenians, having received warning that Camarina was\nabout to be betrayed to the Syracusans by Archias and his party, sailed\nthither; and the Messinese took this opportunity to attack by sea and\nland with all their forces their Chalcidian neighbour, Naxos. The first\nday they forced the Naxians to keep their walls, and laid waste their\ncountry; the next they sailed round with their ships, and laid waste\ntheir land on the river Akesines, while their land forces menaced the\ncity. Meanwhile the Sicels came down from the high country in great\nnumbers, to aid against the Messinese; and the Naxians, elated at the\nsight, and animated by a belief that the Leontines and their other\nHellenic allies were coming to their support, suddenly sallied out from\nthe town, and attacked and routed the Messinese, killing more than a\nthousand of them; while the remainder suffered severely in their retreat\nhome, being attacked by the barbarians on the road, and most of them\ncut off. The ships put in to Messina, and afterwards dispersed for their\ndifferent homes. The Leontines and their allies, with the Athenians,\nupon this at once turned their arms against the now weakened Messina,\nand attacked, the Athenians with their ships on the side of the harbour,\nand the land forces on that of the town. The Messinese, however,\nsallying out with Demoteles and some Locrians who had been left to\ngarrison the city after the disaster, suddenly attacked and routed most\nof the Leontine army, killing a great number; upon seeing which the\nAthenians landed from their ships, and falling on the Messinese in\ndisorder chased them back into the town, and setting up a trophy retired\nto Rhegium. After this the Hellenes in Sicily continued to make war on\neach other by land, without the Athenians.\n\nMeanwhile the Athenians at Pylos were still besieging the Lacedaemonians\nin the island, the Peloponnesian forces on the continent remaining where\nthey were. The blockade was very laborious for the Athenians from want\nof food and water; there was no spring except one in the citadel of\nPylos itself, and that not a large one, and most of them were obliged to\ngrub up the shingle on the sea beach and drink such water as they could\nfind. They also suffered from want of room, being encamped in a narrow\nspace; and as there was no anchorage for the ships, some took their\nmeals on shore in their turn, while the others were anchored out at sea.\nBut their greatest discouragement arose from the unexpectedly long time\nwhich it took to reduce a body of men shut up in a desert island, with\nonly brackish water to drink, a matter which they had imagined would\ntake them only a few days. The fact was that the Lacedaemonians had made\nadvertisement for volunteers to carry into the island ground corn, wine,\ncheese, and any other food useful in a siege; high prices being offered,\nand freedom promised to any of the Helots who should succeed in doing\nso. The Helots accordingly were most forward to engage in this risky\ntraffic, putting off from this or that part of Peloponnese, and running\nin by night on the seaward side of the island. They were best pleased,\nhowever, when they could catch a wind to carry them in. It was more easy\nto elude the look-out of the galleys, when it blew from the seaward,\nas it became impossible for them to anchor round the island; while\nthe Helots had their boats rated at their value in money, and ran them\nashore, without caring how they landed, being sure to find the soldiers\nwaiting for them at the landing-places. But all who risked it in fair\nweather were taken. Divers also swam in under water from the harbour,\ndragging by a cord in skins poppyseed mixed with honey, and bruised\nlinseed; these at first escaped notice, but afterwards a look-out was\nkept for them. In short, both sides tried every possible contrivance,\nthe one to throw in provisions, and the other to prevent their\nintroduction.\n\nAt Athens, meanwhile, the news that the army was in great distress, and\nthat corn found its way in to the men in the island, caused no small\nperplexity; and the Athenians began to fear that winter might come on\nand find them still engaged in the blockade. They saw that the convoying\nof provisions round Peloponnese would be then impossible. The country\noffered no resources in itself, and even in summer they could not send\nround enough. The blockade of a place without harbours could no\nlonger be kept up; and the men would either escape by the siege being\nabandoned, or would watch for bad weather and sail out in the boats that\nbrought in their corn. What caused still more alarm was the attitude\nof the Lacedaemonians, who must, it was thought by the Athenians, feel\nthemselves on strong ground not to send them any more envoys; and\nthey began to repent having rejected the treaty. Cleon, perceiving the\ndisfavour with which he was regarded for having stood in the way of the\nconvention, now said that their informants did not speak the truth; and\nupon the messengers recommending them, if they did not believe them, to\nsend some commissioners to see, Cleon himself and Theagenes were chosen\nby the Athenians as commissioners. Aware that he would now be obliged\neither to say what had been already said by the men whom he was\nslandering, or be proved a liar if he said the contrary, he told the\nAthenians, whom he saw to be not altogether disinclined for a fresh\nexpedition, that instead of sending and wasting their time and\nopportunities, if they believed what was told them, they ought to sail\nagainst the men. And pointing at Nicias, son of Niceratus, then general,\nwhom he hated, he tauntingly said that it would be easy, if they had\nmen for generals, to sail with a force and take those in the island, and\nthat if he had himself been in command, he would have done it.\n\nNicias, seeing the Athenians murmuring against Cleon for not sailing now\nif it seemed to him so easy, and further seeing himself the object of\nattack, told him that for all that the generals cared, he might take\nwhat force he chose and make the attempt. At first Cleon fancied that\nthis resignation was merely a figure of speech, and was ready to go, but\nfinding that it was seriously meant, he drew back, and said that Nicias,\nnot he, was general, being now frightened, and having never supposed\nthat Nicias would go so far as to retire in his favour. Nicias, however,\nrepeated his offer, and resigned the command against Pylos, and called\nthe Athenians to witness that he did so. And as the multitude is wont to\ndo, the more Cleon shrank from the expedition and tried to back out\nof what he had said, the more they encouraged Nicias to hand over his\ncommand, and clamoured at Cleon to go. At last, not knowing how to get\nout of his words, he undertook the expedition, and came forward and said\nthat he was not afraid of the Lacedaemonians, but would sail without\ntaking any one from the city with him, except the Lemnians and Imbrians\nthat were at Athens, with some targeteers that had come up from Aenus,\nand four hundred archers from other quarters. With these and the\nsoldiers at Pylos, he would within twenty days either bring the\nLacedaemonians alive, or kill them on the spot. The Athenians could not\nhelp laughing at his fatuity, while sensible men comforted themselves\nwith the reflection that they must gain in either circumstance; either\nthey would be rid of Cleon, which they rather hoped, or if disappointed\nin this expectation, would reduce the Lacedaemonians.\n\nAfter he had settled everything in the assembly, and the Athenians\nhad voted him the command of the expedition, he chose as his colleague\nDemosthenes, one of the generals at Pylos, and pushed forward the\npreparations for his voyage. His choice fell upon Demosthenes because\nhe heard that he was contemplating a descent on the island; the soldiers\ndistressed by the difficulties of the position, and rather besieged than\nbesiegers, being eager to fight it out, while the firing of the island\nhad increased the confidence of the general. He had been at first\nafraid, because the island having never been inhabited was almost\nentirely covered with wood and without paths, thinking this to be in\nthe enemy's favour, as he might land with a large force, and yet might\nsuffer loss by an attack from an unseen position. The mistakes and\nforces of the enemy the wood would in a great measure conceal from him,\nwhile every blunder of his own troops would be at once detected, and\nthey would be thus able to fall upon him unexpectedly just where they\npleased, the attack being always in their power. If, on the other hand,\nhe should force them to engage in the thicket, the smaller number who\nknew the country would, he thought, have the advantage over the\nlarger who were ignorant of it, while his own army might be cut off\nimperceptibly, in spite of its numbers, as the men would not be able to\nsee where to succour each other.\n\nThe Aetolian disaster, which had been mainly caused by the wood, had not\na little to do with these reflections. Meanwhile, one of the soldiers\nwho were compelled by want of room to land on the extremities of\nthe island and take their dinners, with outposts fixed to prevent a\nsurprise, set fire to a little of the wood without meaning to do so;\nand as it came on to blow soon afterwards, almost the whole was consumed\nbefore they were aware of it. Demosthenes was now able for the first\ntime to see how numerous the Lacedaemonians really were, having up to\nthis moment been under the impression that they took in provisions for a\nsmaller number; he also saw that the Athenians thought success important\nand were anxious about it, and that it was now easier to land on the\nisland, and accordingly got ready for the attempt, sent for troops\nfrom the allies in the neighbourhood, and pushed forward his other\npreparations. At this moment Cleon arrived at Pylos with the troops\nwhich he had asked for, having sent on word to say that he was coming.\nThe first step taken by the two generals after their meeting was to send\na herald to the camp on the mainland, to ask if they were disposed\nto avoid all risk and to order the men on the island to surrender\nthemselves and their arms, to be kept in gentle custody until some\ngeneral convention should be concluded.\n\nOn the rejection of this proposition the generals let one day pass, and\nthe next, embarking all their heavy infantry on board a few ships,\nput out by night, and a little before dawn landed on both sides of the\nisland from the open sea and from the harbour, being about eight hundred\nstrong, and advanced with a run against the first post in the island.\n\nThe enemy had distributed his force as follows: In this first post there\nwere about thirty heavy infantry; the centre and most level part,\nwhere the water was, was held by the main body, and by Epitadas their\ncommander; while a small party guarded the very end of the island,\ntowards Pylos, which was precipitous on the sea-side and very difficult\nto attack from the land, and where there was also a sort of old fort of\nstones rudely put together, which they thought might be useful to them,\nin case they should be forced to retreat. Such was their disposition.\n\nThe advanced post thus attacked by the Athenians was at once put to the\nsword, the men being scarcely out of bed and still arming, the landing\nhaving taken them by surprise, as they fancied the ships were only\nsailing as usual to their stations for the night. As soon as day broke,\nthe rest of the army landed, that is to say, all the crews of rather\nmore than seventy ships, except the lowest rank of oars, with the\narms they carried, eight hundred archers, and as many targeteers, the\nMessenian reinforcements, and all the other troops on duty round Pylos,\nexcept the garrison on the fort. The tactics of Demosthenes had divided\nthem into companies of two hundred, more or less, and made them occupy\nthe highest points in order to paralyse the enemy by surrounding him on\nevery side and thus leaving him without any tangible adversary, exposed\nto the cross-fire of their host; plied by those in his rear if he\nattacked in front, and by those on one flank if he moved against those\non the other. In short, wherever he went he would have the assailants\nbehind him, and these light-armed assailants, the most awkward of all;\narrows, darts, stones, and slings making them formidable at a distance,\nand there being no means of getting at them at close quarters, as they\ncould conquer flying, and the moment their pursuer turned they were upon\nhim. Such was the idea that inspired Demosthenes in his conception of\nthe descent, and presided over its execution.\n\nMeanwhile the main body of the troops in the island (that under\nEpitadas), seeing their outpost cut off and an army advancing against\nthem, serried their ranks and pressed forward to close with the Athenian\nheavy infantry in front of them, the light troops being upon their\nflanks and rear. However, they were not able to engage or to profit by\ntheir superior skill, the light troops keeping them in check on either\nside with their missiles, and the heavy infantry remaining stationary\ninstead of advancing to meet them; and although they routed the light\ntroops wherever they ran up and approached too closely, yet they\nretreated fighting, being lightly equipped, and easily getting the start\nin their flight, from the difficult and rugged nature of the ground,\nin an island hitherto desert, over which the Lacedaemonians could not\npursue them with their heavy armour.\n\nAfter this skirmishing had lasted some little while, the Lacedaemonians\nbecame unable to dash out with the same rapidity as before upon the\npoints attacked, and the light troops finding that they now fought with\nless vigour, became more confident. They could see with their own eyes\nthat they were many times more numerous than the enemy; they were now\nmore familiar with his aspect and found him less terrible, the result\nnot having justified the apprehensions which they had suffered,\nwhen they first landed in slavish dismay at the idea of attacking\nLacedaemonians; and accordingly their fear changing to disdain, they\nnow rushed all together with loud shouts upon them, and pelted them with\nstones, darts, and arrows, whichever came first to hand. The shouting\naccompanying their onset confounded the Lacedaemonians, unaccustomed to\nthis mode of fighting; dust rose from the newly burnt wood, and it was\nimpossible to see in front of one with the arrows and stones flying\nthrough clouds of dust from the hands of numerous assailants. The\nLacedaemonians had now to sustain a rude conflict; their caps would not\nkeep out the arrows, darts had broken off in the armour of the wounded,\nwhile they themselves were helpless for offence, being prevented from\nusing their eyes to see what was before them, and unable to hear the\nwords of command for the hubbub raised by the enemy; danger encompassed\nthem on every side, and there was no hope of any means of defence or\nsafety.\n\nAt last, after many had been already wounded in the confined space in\nwhich they were fighting, they formed in close order and retired on\nthe fort at the end of the island, which was not far off, and to their\nfriends who held it. The moment they gave way, the light troops became\nbolder and pressed upon them, shouting louder than ever, and killed\nas many as they came up with in their retreat, but most of the\nLacedaemonians made good their escape to the fort, and with the garrison\nin it ranged themselves all along its whole extent to repulse the enemy\nwherever it was assailable. The Athenians pursuing, unable to surround\nand hem them in, owing to the strength of the ground, attacked them in\nfront and tried to storm the position. For a long time, indeed for most\nof the day, both sides held out against all the torments of the battle,\nthirst, and sun, the one endeavouring to drive the enemy from the high\nground, the other to maintain himself upon it, it being now more easy\nfor the Lacedaemonians to defend themselves than before, as they could\nnot be surrounded on the flanks.\n\nThe struggle began to seem endless, when the commander of the Messenians\ncame to Cleon and Demosthenes, and told them that they were losing their\nlabour: but if they would give him some archers and light troops to\ngo round on the enemy's rear by a way he would undertake to find, he\nthought he could force the approach. Upon receiving what he asked for,\nhe started from a point out of sight in order not to be seen by the\nenemy, and creeping on wherever the precipices of the island permitted,\nand where the Lacedaemonians, trusting to the strength of the ground,\nkept no guard, succeeded after the greatest difficulty in getting round\nwithout their seeing him, and suddenly appeared on the high ground in\ntheir rear, to the dismay of the surprised enemy and the still greater\njoy of his expectant friends. The Lacedaemonians thus placed between two\nfires, and in the same dilemma, to compare small things with great, as\nat Thermopylae, where the defenders were cut off through the Persians\ngetting round by the path, being now attacked in front and behind, began\nto give way, and overcome by the odds against them and exhausted from\nwant of food, retreated.\n\nThe Athenians were already masters of the approaches when Cleon and\nDemosthenes perceiving that, if the enemy gave way a single step\nfurther, they would be destroyed by their soldiery, put a stop to the\nbattle and held their men back; wishing to take the Lacedaemonians alive\nto Athens, and hoping that their stubbornness might relax on hearing the\noffer of terms, and that they might surrender and yield to the present\noverwhelming danger. Proclamation was accordingly made, to know if they\nwould surrender themselves and their arms to the Athenians to be dealt\nat their discretion.\n\nThe Lacedaemonians hearing this offer, most of them lowered their\nshields and waved their hands to show that they accepted it. Hostilities\nnow ceased, and a parley was held between Cleon and Demosthenes and\nStyphon, son of Pharax, on the other side; since Epitadas, the first of\nthe previous commanders, had been killed, and Hippagretas, the next in\ncommand, left for dead among the slain, though still alive, and thus\nthe command had devolved upon Styphon according to the law, in case of\nanything happening to his superiors. Styphon and his companions said\nthey wished to send a herald to the Lacedaemonians on the mainland, to\nknow what they were to do. The Athenians would not let any of them go,\nbut themselves called for heralds from the mainland, and after questions\nhad been carried backwards and forwards two or three times, the last man\nthat passed over from the Lacedaemonians on the continent brought this\nmessage: \"The Lacedaemonians bid you to decide for yourselves so long as\nyou do nothing dishonourable\"; upon which after consulting together they\nsurrendered themselves and their arms. The Athenians, after guarding\nthem that day and night, the next morning set up a trophy in the island,\nand got ready to sail, giving their prisoners in batches to be guarded\nby the captains of the galleys; and the Lacedaemonians sent a herald and\ntook up their dead. The number of the killed and prisoners taken in the\nisland was as follows: four hundred and twenty heavy infantry had passed\nover; three hundred all but eight were taken alive to Athens; the rest\nwere killed. About a hundred and twenty of the prisoners were Spartans.\nThe Athenian loss was small, the battle not having been fought at close\nquarters.\n\nThe blockade in all, counting from the fight at sea to the battle in\nthe island, had lasted seventy-two days. For twenty of these, during the\nabsence of the envoys sent to treat for peace, the men had provisions\ngiven them, for the rest they were fed by the smugglers. Corn and other\nvictual was found in the island; the commander Epitadas having kept\nthe men upon half rations. The Athenians and Peloponnesians now each\nwithdrew their forces from Pylos, and went home, and crazy as Cleon's\npromise was, he fulfilled it, by bringing the men to Athens within the\ntwenty days as he had pledged himself to do.\n\nNothing that happened in the war surprised the Hellenes so much as this.\nIt was the opinion that no force or famine could make the Lacedaemonians\ngive up their arms, but that they would fight on as they could, and\ndie with them in their hands: indeed people could scarcely believe that\nthose who had surrendered were of the same stuff as the fallen; and\nan Athenian ally, who some time after insultingly asked one of the\nprisoners from the island if those that had fallen were men of honour,\nreceived for answer that the atraktos--that is, the arrow--would be\nworth a great deal if it could tell men of honour from the rest; in\nallusion to the fact that the killed were those whom the stones and the\narrows happened to hit.\n\nUpon the arrival of the men the Athenians determined to keep them in\nprison until the peace, and if the Peloponnesians invaded their country\nin the interval, to bring them out and put them to death. Meanwhile the\ndefence of Pylos was not forgotten; the Messenians from Naupactus sent\nto their old country, to which Pylos formerly belonged, some of the\nlikeliest of their number, and began a series of incursions into\nLaconia, which their common dialect rendered most destructive. The\nLacedaemonians, hitherto without experience of incursions or a warfare\nof the kind, finding the Helots deserting, and fearing the march of\nrevolution in their country, began to be seriously uneasy, and in spite\nof their unwillingness to betray this to the Athenians began to send\nenvoys to Athens, and tried to recover Pylos and the prisoners. The\nAthenians, however, kept grasping at more, and dismissed envoy after\nenvoy without their having effected anything. Such was the history of\nthe affair of Pylos.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n_Seventh and Eighth Years of the War--End of Corcyraean Revolution--\nPeace of Gela--Capture of Nisaea_\n\nThe same summer, directly after these events, the Athenians made an\nexpedition against the territory of Corinth with eighty ships and two\nthousand Athenian heavy infantry, and two hundred cavalry on board horse\ntransports, accompanied by the Milesians, Andrians, and Carystians from\nthe allies, under the command of Nicias, son of Niceratus, with two\ncolleagues. Putting out to sea they made land at daybreak between\nChersonese and Rheitus, at the beach of the country underneath\nthe Solygian hill, upon which the Dorians in old times established\nthemselves and carried on war against the Aeolian inhabitants of\nCorinth, and where a village now stands called Solygia. The beach where\nthe fleet came to is about a mile and a half from the village, seven\nmiles from Corinth, and two and a quarter from the Isthmus. The\nCorinthians had heard from Argos of the coming of the Athenian armament,\nand had all come up to the Isthmus long before, with the exception of\nthose who lived beyond it, and also of five hundred who were away in\ngarrison in Ambracia and Leucadia; and they were there in full force\nwatching for the Athenians to land. These last, however, gave them the\nslip by coming in the dark; and being informed by signals of the\nfact the Corinthians left half their number at Cenchreae, in case the\nAthenians should go against Crommyon, and marched in all haste to the\nrescue.\n\nBattus, one of the two generals present at the action, went with\na company to defend the village of Solygia, which was unfortified;\nLycophron remaining to give battle with the rest. The Corinthians first\nattacked the right wing of the Athenians, which had just landed in front\nof Chersonese, and afterwards the rest of the army. The battle was an\nobstinate one, and fought throughout hand to hand. The right wing of the\nAthenians and Carystians, who had been placed at the end of the\nline, received and with some difficulty repulsed the Corinthians,\nwho thereupon retreated to a wall upon the rising ground behind, and\nthrowing down the stones upon them, came on again singing the paean, and\nbeing received by the Athenians, were again engaged at close quarters.\nAt this moment a Corinthian company having come to the relief of the\nleft wing, routed and pursued the Athenian right to the sea, whence they\nwere in their turn driven back by the Athenians and Carystians from\nthe ships. Meanwhile the rest of the army on either side fought on\ntenaciously, especially the right wing of the Corinthians, where\nLycophron sustained the attack of the Athenian left, which it was feared\nmight attempt the village of Solygia.\n\nAfter holding on for a long while without either giving way, the\nAthenians aided by their horse, of which the enemy had none, at length\nrouted the Corinthians, who retired to the hill and, halting, remained\nquiet there, without coming down again. It was in this rout of the right\nwing that they had the most killed, Lycophron their general being among\nthe number. The rest of the army, broken and put to flight in this way\nwithout being seriously pursued or hurried, retired to the high ground\nand there took up its position. The Athenians, finding that the enemy no\nlonger offered to engage them, stripped his dead and took up their own\nand immediately set up a trophy. Meanwhile, the half of the Corinthians\nleft at Cenchreae to guard against the Athenians sailing on Crommyon,\nalthough unable to see the battle for Mount Oneion, found out what was\ngoing on by the dust, and hurried up to the rescue; as did also the\nolder Corinthians from the town, upon discovering what had occurred. The\nAthenians seeing them all coming against them, and thinking that they\nwere reinforcements arriving from the neighbouring Peloponnesians,\nwithdrew in haste to their ships with their spoils and their own dead,\nexcept two that they left behind, not being able to find them, and going\non board crossed over to the islands opposite, and from thence sent a\nherald, and took up under truce the bodies which they had left behind.\nTwo hundred and twelve Corinthians fell in the battle, and rather less\nthan fifty Athenians.\n\nWeighing from the islands, the Athenians sailed the same day to Crommyon\nin the Corinthian territory, about thirteen miles from the city, and\ncoming to anchor laid waste the country, and passed the night there. The\nnext day, after first coasting along to the territory of Epidaurus\nand making a descent there, they came to Methana between Epidaurus\nand Troezen, and drew a wall across and fortified the isthmus of the\npeninsula, and left a post there from which incursions were henceforth\nmade upon the country of Troezen, Haliae, and Epidaurus. After walling\noff this spot, the fleet sailed off home.\n\nWhile these events were going on, Eurymedon and Sophocles had put to sea\nwith the Athenian fleet from Pylos on their way to Sicily and, arriving\nat Corcyra, joined the townsmen in an expedition against the party\nestablished on Mount Istone, who had crossed over, as I have mentioned,\nafter the revolution and become masters of the country, to the great\nhurt of the inhabitants. Their stronghold having been taken by an\nattack, the garrison took refuge in a body upon some high ground and\nthere capitulated, agreeing to give up their mercenary auxiliaries, lay\ndown their arms, and commit themselves to the discretion of the Athenian\npeople. The generals carried them across under truce to the island of\nPtychia, to be kept in custody until they could be sent to Athens, upon\nthe understanding that, if any were caught running away, all would\nlose the benefit of the treaty. Meanwhile the leaders of the Corcyraean\ncommons, afraid that the Athenians might spare the lives of the\nprisoners, had recourse to the following stratagem. They gained over\nsome few men on the island by secretly sending friends with instructions\nto provide them with a boat, and to tell them, as if for their own\nsakes, that they had best escape as quickly as possible, as the Athenian\ngenerals were going to give them up to the Corcyraean people.\n\nThese representations succeeding, it was so arranged that the men were\ncaught sailing out in the boat that was provided, and the treaty became\nvoid accordingly, and the whole body were given up to the Corcyraeans.\nFor this result the Athenian generals were in a great measure\nresponsible; their evident disinclination to sail for Sicily, and\nthus to leave to others the honour of conducting the men to Athens,\nencouraged the intriguers in their design and seemed to affirm the truth\nof their representations. The prisoners thus handed over were shut up\nby the Corcyraeans in a large building, and afterwards taken out by\ntwenties and led past two lines of heavy infantry, one on each side,\nbeing bound together, and beaten and stabbed by the men in the lines\nwhenever any saw pass a personal enemy; while men carrying whips went by\ntheir side and hastened on the road those that walked too slowly.\n\nAs many as sixty men were taken out and killed in this way without the\nknowledge of their friends in the building, who fancied they were merely\nbeing moved from one prison to another. At last, however, someone opened\ntheir eyes to the truth, upon which they called upon the Athenians to\nkill them themselves, if such was their pleasure, and refused any longer\nto go out of the building, and said they would do all they could to\nprevent any one coming in. The Corcyraeans, not liking themselves to\nforce a passage by the doors, got up on the top of the building, and\nbreaking through the roof, threw down the tiles and let fly arrows at\nthem, from which the prisoners sheltered themselves as well as they\ncould. Most of their number, meanwhile, were engaged in dispatching\nthemselves by thrusting into their throats the arrows shot by the enemy,\nand hanging themselves with the cords taken from some beds that happened\nto be there, and with strips made from their clothing; adopting, in\nshort, every possible means of self-destruction, and also falling\nvictims to the missiles of their enemies on the roof. Night came on\nwhile these horrors were enacting, and most of it had passed before they\nwere concluded. When it was day the Corcyraeans threw them in layers\nupon wagons and carried them out of the city. All the women taken in\nthe stronghold were sold as slaves. In this way the Corcyraeans of the\nmountain were destroyed by the commons; and so after terrible excesses\nthe party strife came to an end, at least as far as the period of this\nwar is concerned, for of one party there was practically nothing left.\nMeanwhile the Athenians sailed off to Sicily, their primary destination,\nand carried on the war with their allies there.\n\nAt the close of the summer, the Athenians at Naupactus and the\nAcarnanians made an expedition against Anactorium, the Corinthian town\nlying at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, and took it by treachery;\nand the Acarnanians themselves, sending settlers from all parts of\nAcarnania, occupied the place.\n\nSummer was now over. During the winter ensuing, Aristides, son of\nArchippus, one of the commanders of the Athenian ships sent to collect\nmoney from the allies, arrested at Eion, on the Strymon, Artaphernes,\na Persian, on his way from the King to Lacedaemon. He was conducted\nto Athens, where the Athenians got his dispatches translated from the\nAssyrian character and read them. With numerous references to other\nsubjects, they in substance told the Lacedaemonians that the King did\nnot know what they wanted, as of the many ambassadors they had sent him\nno two ever told the same story; if however they were prepared to speak\nplainly they might send him some envoys with this Persian. The Athenians\nafterwards sent back Artaphernes in a galley to Ephesus, and ambassadors\nwith him, who heard there of the death of King Artaxerxes, son of\nXerxes, which took place about that time, and so returned home.\n\nThe same winter the Chians pulled down their new wall at the command of\nthe Athenians, who suspected them of meditating an insurrection, after\nfirst however obtaining pledges from the Athenians, and security as far\nas this was possible for their continuing to treat them as before. Thus\nthe winter ended, and with it ended the seventh year of this war of\nwhich Thucydides is the historian.\n\nIn first days of the next summer there was an eclipse of the sun at the\ntime of new moon, and in the early part of the same month an earthquake.\nMeanwhile, the Mitylenian and other Lesbian exiles set out, for the\nmost part from the continent, with mercenaries hired in Peloponnese, and\nothers levied on the spot, and took Rhoeteum, but restored it without\ninjury on the receipt of two thousand Phocaean staters. After this they\nmarched against Antandrus and took the town by treachery, their plan\nbeing to free Antandrus and the rest of the Actaean towns, formerly\nowned by Mitylene but now held by the Athenians. Once fortified there,\nthey would have every facility for ship-building from the vicinity\nof Ida and the consequent abundance of timber, and plenty of other\nsupplies, and might from this base easily ravage Lesbos, which was\nnot far off, and make themselves masters of the Aeolian towns on the\ncontinent.\n\nWhile these were the schemes of the exiles, the Athenians in the same\nsummer made an expedition with sixty ships, two thousand heavy infantry,\na few cavalry, and some allied troops from Miletus and other parts,\nagainst Cythera, under the command of Nicias, son of Niceratus,\nNicostratus, son of Diotrephes, and Autocles, son of Tolmaeus. Cythera\nis an island lying off Laconia, opposite Malea; the inhabitants are\nLacedaemonians of the class of the Perioeci; and an officer called the\njudge of Cythera went over to the place annually from Sparta. A garrison\nof heavy infantry was also regularly sent there, and great attention\npaid to the island, as it was the landing-place for the merchantmen from\nEgypt and Libya, and at the same time secured Laconia from the attacks\nof privateers from the sea, at the only point where it is assailable, as\nthe whole coast rises abruptly towards the Sicilian and Cretan seas.\n\nComing to land here with their armament, the Athenians with ten ships\nand two thousand Milesian heavy infantry took the town of Scandea, on\nthe sea; and with the rest of their forces landing on the side of the\nisland looking towards Malea, went against the lower town of Cythera,\nwhere they found all the inhabitants encamped. A battle ensuing, the\nCytherians held their ground for some little while, and then turned\nand fled into the upper town, where they soon afterwards capitulated to\nNicias and his colleagues, agreeing to leave their fate to the decision\nof the Athenians, their lives only being safe. A correspondence had\npreviously been going on between Nicias and certain of the inhabitants,\nwhich caused the surrender to be effected more speedily, and upon terms\nmore advantageous, present and future, for the Cytherians; who would\notherwise have been expelled by the Athenians on account of their being\nLacedaemonians and their island being so near to Laconia. After the\ncapitulation, the Athenians occupied the town of Scandea near the\nharbour, and appointing a garrison for Cythera, sailed to Asine, Helus,\nand most of the places on the sea, and making descents and passing the\nnight on shore at such spots as were convenient, continued ravaging the\ncountry for about seven days.\n\nThe Lacedaemonians seeing the Athenians masters of Cythera, and\nexpecting descents of the kind upon their coasts, nowhere opposed\nthem in force, but sent garrisons here and there through the country,\nconsisting of as many heavy infantry as the points menaced seemed to\nrequire, and generally stood very much upon the defensive. After the\nsevere and unexpected blow that had befallen them in the island, the\noccupation of Pylos and Cythera, and the apparition on every side of\na war whose rapidity defied precaution, they lived in constant fear\nof internal revolution, and now took the unusual step of raising four\nhundred horse and a force of archers, and became more timid than ever\nin military matters, finding themselves involved in a maritime struggle,\nwhich their organization had never contemplated, and that against\nAthenians, with whom an enterprise unattempted was always looked upon\nas a success sacrificed. Besides this, their late numerous reverses\nof fortune, coming close one upon another without any reason, had\nthoroughly unnerved them, and they were always afraid of a second\ndisaster like that on the island, and thus scarcely dared to take the\nfield, but fancied that they could not stir without a blunder, for\nbeing new to the experience of adversity they had lost all confidence in\nthemselves.\n\nAccordingly they now allowed the Athenians to ravage their seaboard,\nwithout making any movement, the garrisons in whose neighbourhood the\ndescents were made always thinking their numbers insufficient, and\nsharing the general feeling. A single garrison which ventured to resist,\nnear Cotyrta and Aphrodisia, struck terror by its charge into the\nscattered mob of light troops, but retreated, upon being received by the\nheavy infantry, with the loss of a few men and some arms, for which the\nAthenians set up a trophy, and then sailed off to Cythera. From thence\nthey sailed round to Epidaurus Limera, ravaged part of the country,\nand so came to Thyrea in the Cynurian territory, upon the Argive and\nLaconian border. This district had been given by its Lacedaemonian\nowners to the expelled Aeginetans to inhabit, in return for their good\noffices at the time of the earthquake and the rising of the Helots; and\nalso because, although subjects of Athens, they had always sided with\nLacedaemon.\n\nWhile the Athenians were still at sea, the Aeginetans evacuated a fort\nwhich they were building upon the coast, and retreated into the upper\ntown where they lived, rather more than a mile from the sea. One of the\nLacedaemonian district garrisons which was helping them in the work,\nrefused to enter here with them at their entreaty, thinking it dangerous\nto shut themselves up within the wall, and retiring to the high ground\nremained quiet, not considering themselves a match for the enemy.\nMeanwhile the Athenians landed, and instantly advanced with all their\nforces and took Thyrea. The town they burnt, pillaging what was in\nit; the Aeginetans who were not slain in action they took with them to\nAthens, with Tantalus, son of Patrocles, their Lacedaemonian commander,\nwho had been wounded and taken prisoner. They also took with them a\nfew men from Cythera whom they thought it safest to remove. These the\nAthenians determined to lodge in the islands: the rest of the Cytherians\nwere to retain their lands and pay four talents tribute; the Aeginetans\ncaptured to be all put to death, on account of the old inveterate feud;\nand Tantalus to share the imprisonment of the Lacedaemonians taken on\nthe island.\n\nThe same summer, the inhabitants of Camarina and Gela in Sicily first\nmade an armistice with each other, after which embassies from all\nthe other Sicilian cities assembled at Gela to try to bring about a\npacification. After many expressions of opinion on one side and the\nother, according to the griefs and pretensions of the different\nparties complaining, Hermocrates, son of Hermon, a Syracusan, the\nmost influential man among them, addressed the following words to the\nassembly:\n\n\"If I now address you, Sicilians, it is not because my city is the least\nin Sicily or the greatest sufferer by the war, but in order to state\npublicly what appears to me to be the best policy for the whole island.\nThat war is an evil is a proposition so familiar to every one that it\nwould be tedious to develop it. No one is forced to engage in it by\nignorance, or kept out of it by fear, if he fancies there is anything to\nbe gained by it. To the former the gain appears greater than the danger,\nwhile the latter would rather stand the risk than put up with any\nimmediate sacrifice. But if both should happen to have chosen the\nwrong moment for acting in this way, advice to make peace would not be\nunserviceable; and this, if we did but see it, is just what we stand\nmost in need of at the present juncture.\n\n\"I suppose that no one will dispute that we went to war at first in\norder to serve our own several interests, that we are now, in view\nof the same interests, debating how we can make peace; and that if\nwe separate without having as we think our rights, we shall go to war\nagain. And yet, as men of sense, we ought to see that our separate\ninterests are not alone at stake in the present congress: there is also\nthe question whether we have still time to save Sicily, the whole of\nwhich in my opinion is menaced by Athenian ambition; and we ought to\nfind in the name of that people more imperious arguments for peace than\nany which I can advance, when we see the first power in Hellas watching\nour mistakes with the few ships that she has at present in our waters,\nand under the fair name of alliance speciously seeking to turn to\naccount the natural hostility that exists between us. If we go to war,\nand call in to help us a people that are ready enough to carry their\narms even where they are not invited; and if we injure ourselves at\nour own expense, and at the same time serve as the pioneers of their\ndominion, we may expect, when they see us worn out, that they will\none day come with a larger armament, and seek to bring all of us into\nsubjection.\n\n\"And yet as sensible men, if we call in allies and court danger,\nit should be in order to enrich our different countries with new\nacquisitions, and not to ruin what they possess already; and we should\nunderstand that the intestine discords which are so fatal to communities\ngenerally, will be equally so to Sicily, if we, its inhabitants,\nabsorbed in our local quarrels, neglect the common enemy. These\nconsiderations should reconcile individual with individual, and city\nwith city, and unite us in a common effort to save the whole of Sicily.\nNor should any one imagine that the Dorians only are enemies of Athens,\nwhile the Chalcidian race is secured by its Ionian blood; the attack in\nquestion is not inspired by hatred of one of two nationalities, but by\na desire for the good things in Sicily, the common property of us all.\nThis is proved by the Athenian reception of the Chalcidian invitation:\nan ally who has never given them any assistance whatever, at once\nreceives from them almost more than the treaty entitles him to. That the\nAthenians should cherish this ambition and practise this policy is very\nexcusable; and I do not blame those who wish to rule, but those who are\nover-ready to serve. It is just as much in men's nature to rule those\nwho submit to them, as it is to resist those who molest them; one is not\nless invariable than the other. Meanwhile all who see these dangers\nand refuse to provide for them properly, or who have come here without\nhaving made up their minds that our first duty is to unite to get rid of\nthe common peril, are mistaken. The quickest way to be rid of it is to\nmake peace with each other; since the Athenians menace us not from their\nown country, but from that of those who invited them here. In this way\ninstead of war issuing in war, peace quietly ends our quarrels; and the\nguests who come hither under fair pretences for bad ends, will have good\nreason for going away without having attained them.\n\n\"So far as regards the Athenians, such are the great advantages proved\ninherent in a wise policy. Independently of this, in the face of the\nuniversal consent, that peace is the first of blessings, how can we\nrefuse to make it amongst ourselves; or do you not think that the good\nwhich you have, and the ills that you complain of, would be better\npreserved and cured by quiet than by war; that peace has its honours and\nsplendours of a less perilous kind, not to mention the numerous other\nblessings that one might dilate on, with the not less numerous miseries\nof war? These considerations should teach you not to disregard my words,\nbut rather to look in them every one for his own safety. If there be any\nhere who feels certain either by right or might to effect his object,\nlet not this surprise be to him too severe a disappointment. Let him\nremember that many before now have tried to chastise a wrongdoer, and\nfailing to punish their enemy have not even saved themselves; while\nmany who have trusted in force to gain an advantage, instead of gaining\nanything more, have been doomed to lose what they had. Vengeance is not\nnecessarily successful because wrong has been done, or strength sure\nbecause it is confident; but the incalculable element in the future\nexercises the widest influence, and is the most treacherous, and yet in\nfact the most useful of all things, as it frightens us all equally, and\nthus makes us consider before attacking each other.\n\n\"Let us therefore now allow the undefined fear of this unknown future,\nand the immediate terror of the Athenians' presence, to produce their\nnatural impression, and let us consider any failure to carry out\nthe programmes that we may each have sketched out for ourselves as\nsufficiently accounted for by these obstacles, and send away the\nintruder from the country; and if everlasting peace be impossible\nbetween us, let us at all events make a treaty for as long a term as\npossible, and put off our private differences to another day. In fine,\nlet us recognize that the adoption of my advice will leave us each\ncitizens of a free state, and as such arbiters of our own destiny, able\nto return good or bad offices with equal effect; while its rejection\nwill make us dependent on others, and thus not only impotent to repel\nan insult, but on the most favourable supposition, friends to our direst\nenemies, and at feud with our natural friends.\n\n\"For myself, though, as I said at first, the representative of a great\ncity, and able to think less of defending myself than of attacking\nothers, I am prepared to concede something in prevision of these\ndangers. I am not inclined to ruin myself for the sake of hurting my\nenemies, or so blinded by animosity as to think myself equally master\nof my own plans and of fortune which I cannot command; but I am ready\nto give up anything in reason. I call upon the rest of you to imitate\nmy conduct of your own free will, without being forced to do so by the\nenemy. There is no disgrace in connections giving way to one another,\na Dorian to a Dorian, or a Chalcidian to his brethren; above and beyond\nthis we are neighbours, live in the same country, are girt by the same\nsea, and go by the same name of Sicilians. We shall go to war again, I\nsuppose, when the time comes, and again make peace among ourselves by\nmeans of future congresses; but the foreign invader, if we are wise,\nwill always find us united against him, since the hurt of one is the\ndanger of all; and we shall never, in future, invite into the island\neither allies or mediators. By so acting we shall at the present moment\ndo for Sicily a double service, ridding her at once of the Athenians,\nand of civil war, and in future shall live in freedom at home, and be\nless menaced from abroad.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Hermocrates. The Sicilians took his advice, and\ncame to an understanding among themselves to end the war, each keeping\nwhat they had--the Camarinaeans taking Morgantina at a price fixed to\nbe paid to the Syracusans--and the allies of the Athenians called the\nofficers in command, and told them that they were going to make peace\nand that they would be included in the treaty. The generals assenting,\nthe peace was concluded, and the Athenian fleet afterwards sailed\naway from Sicily. Upon their arrival at Athens, the Athenians banished\nPythodorus and Sophocles, and fined Eurymedon for having taken bribes\nto depart when they might have subdued Sicily. So thoroughly had the\npresent prosperity persuaded the citizens that nothing could withstand\nthem, and that they could achieve what was possible and impracticable\nalike, with means ample or inadequate it mattered not. The secret of\nthis was their general extraordinary success, which made them confuse\ntheir strength with their hopes.\n\nThe same summer the Megarians in the city, pressed by the hostilities of\nthe Athenians, who invaded their country twice every year with all their\nforces, and harassed by the incursions of their own exiles at Pegae,\nwho had been expelled in a revolution by the popular party, began to ask\neach other whether it would not be better to receive back their exiles,\nand free the town from one of its two scourges. The friends of the\nemigrants, perceiving the agitation, now more openly than before\ndemanded the adoption of this proposition; and the leaders of the\ncommons, seeing that the sufferings of the times had tired out\nthe constancy of their supporters, entered in their alarm into\ncorrespondence with the Athenian generals, Hippocrates, son of Ariphron,\nand Demosthenes, son of Alcisthenes, and resolved to betray the town,\nthinking this less dangerous to themselves than the return of the party\nwhich they had banished. It was accordingly arranged that the Athenians\nshould first take the long walls extending for nearly a mile from the\ncity to the port of Nisaea, to prevent the Peloponnesians coming to the\nrescue from that place, where they formed the sole garrison to secure\nthe fidelity of Megara; and that after this the attempt should be made\nto put into their hands the upper town, which it was thought would then\ncome over with less difficulty.\n\nThe Athenians, after plans had been arranged between themselves and\ntheir correspondents both as to words and actions, sailed by night to\nMinoa, the island off Megara, with six hundred heavy infantry under the\ncommand of Hippocrates, and took post in a quarry not far off, out of\nwhich bricks used to be taken for the walls; while Demosthenes, the\nother commander, with a detachment of Plataean light troops and another\nof Peripoli, placed himself in ambush in the precinct of Enyalius, which\nwas still nearer. No one knew of it, except those whose business it was\nto know that night. A little before daybreak, the traitors in Megara\nbegan to act. Every night for a long time back, under pretence of\nmarauding, in order to have a means of opening the gates, they had been\nused, with the consent of the officer in command, to carry by night a\nsculling boat upon a cart along the ditch to the sea, and so to sail\nout, bringing it back again before day upon the cart, and taking it\nwithin the wall through the gates, in order, as they pretended, to\nbaffle the Athenian blockade at Minoa, there being no boat to be seen in\nthe harbour. On the present occasion the cart was already at the gates,\nwhich had been opened in the usual way for the boat, when the Athenians,\nwith whom this had been concerted, saw it, and ran at the top of their\nspeed from the ambush in order to reach the gates before they were shut\nagain, and while the cart was still there to prevent their being closed;\ntheir Megarian accomplices at the same moment killing the guard at\nthe gates. The first to run in was Demosthenes with his Plataeans and\nPeripoli, just where the trophy now stands; and he was no sooner within\nthe gates than the Plataeans engaged and defeated the nearest party\nof Peloponnesians who had taken the alarm and come to the rescue, and\nsecured the gates for the approaching Athenian heavy infantry.\n\nAfter this, each of the Athenians as fast as they entered went against\nthe wall. A few of the Peloponnesian garrison stood their ground at\nfirst, and tried to repel the assault, and some of them were killed; but\nthe main body took fright and fled; the night attack and the sight of\nthe Megarian traitors in arms against them making them think that all\nMegara had gone over to the enemy. It so happened also that the Athenian\nherald of his own idea called out and invited any of the Megarians that\nwished, to join the Athenian ranks; and this was no sooner heard by the\ngarrison than they gave way, and, convinced that they were the victims\nof a concerted attack, took refuge in Nisaea. By daybreak, the walls\nbeing now taken and the Megarians in the city in great agitation, the\npersons who had negotiated with the Athenians, supported by the rest of\nthe popular party which was privy to the plot, said that they ought to\nopen the gates and march out to battle. It had been concerted between\nthem that the Athenians should rush in, the moment that the gates were\nopened, while the conspirators were to be distinguished from the rest by\nbeing anointed with oil, and so to avoid being hurt. They could open the\ngates with more security, as four thousand Athenian heavy infantry from\nEleusis, and six hundred horse, had marched all night, according to\nagreement, and were now close at hand. The conspirators were all ready\nanointed and at their posts by the gates, when one of their accomplices\ndenounced the plot to the opposite party, who gathered together and came\nin a body, and roundly said that they must not march out--a thing they\nhad never yet ventured on even when in greater force than at present--or\nwantonly compromise the safety of the town, and that if what they said\nwas not attended to, the battle would have to be fought in Megara. For\nthe rest, they gave no signs of their knowledge of the intrigue, but\nstoutly maintained that their advice was the best, and meanwhile\nkept close by and watched the gates, making it impossible for the\nconspirators to effect their purpose.\n\nThe Athenian generals seeing that some obstacle had arisen, and that\nthe capture of the town by force was no longer practicable, at once\nproceeded to invest Nisaea, thinking that, if they could take it\nbefore relief arrived, the surrender of Megara would soon follow.\nIron, stone-masons, and everything else required quickly coming up from\nAthens, the Athenians started from the wall which they occupied, and\nfrom this point built a cross wall looking towards Megara down to the\nsea on either side of Nisaea; the ditch and the walls being divided\namong the army, stones and bricks taken from the suburb, and the\nfruit-trees and timber cut down to make a palisade wherever this\nseemed necessary; the houses also in the suburb with the addition of\nbattlements sometimes entering into the fortification. The whole of this\nday the work continued, and by the afternoon of the next the wall was\nall but completed, when the garrison in Nisaea, alarmed by the absolute\nwant of provisions, which they used to take in for the day from the\nupper town, not anticipating any speedy relief from the Peloponnesians,\nand supposing Megara to be hostile, capitulated to the Athenians on\ncondition that they should give up their arms, and should each be\nransomed for a stipulated sum; their Lacedaemonian commander, and any\nothers of his countrymen in the place, being left to the discretion of\nthe Athenians. On these conditions they surrendered and came out, and\nthe Athenians broke down the long walls at their point of junction\nwith Megara, took possession of Nisaea, and went on with their other\npreparations.\n\nJust at this time the Lacedaemonian Brasidas, son of Tellis, happened to\nbe in the neighbourhood of Sicyon and Corinth, getting ready an army for\nThrace. As soon as he heard of the capture of the walls, fearing for\nthe Peloponnesians in Nisaea and the safety of Megara, he sent to the\nBoeotians to meet him as quickly as possible at Tripodiscus, a village\nso called of the Megarid, under Mount Geraneia, and went himself, with\ntwo thousand seven hundred Corinthian heavy infantry, four hundred\nPhliasians, six hundred Sicyonians, and such troops of his own as he had\nalready levied, expecting to find Nisaea not yet taken. Hearing of its\nfall (he had marched out by night to Tripodiscus), he took three hundred\npicked men from the army, without waiting till his coming should be\nknown, and came up to Megara unobserved by the Athenians, who were down\nby the sea, ostensibly, and really if possible, to attempt Nisaea, but\nabove all to get into Megara and secure the town. He accordingly\ninvited the townspeople to admit his party, saying that he had hopes of\nrecovering Nisaea.\n\nHowever, one of the Megarian factions feared that he might expel them\nand restore the exiles; the other that the commons, apprehensive of this\nvery danger, might set upon them, and the city be thus destroyed by a\nbattle within its gates under the eyes of the ambushed Athenians. He was\naccordingly refused admittance, both parties electing to remain quiet\nand await the event; each expecting a battle between the Athenians\nand the relieving army, and thinking it safer to see their friends\nvictorious before declaring in their favour.\n\nUnable to carry his point, Brasidas went back to the rest of the army.\nAt daybreak the Boeotians joined him. Having determined to relieve\nMegara, whose danger they considered their own, even before hearing from\nBrasidas, they were already in full force at Plataea, when his messenger\narrived to add spurs to their resolution; and they at once sent on to\nhim two thousand two hundred heavy infantry, and six hundred horse,\nreturning home with the main body. The whole army thus assembled\nnumbered six thousand heavy infantry. The Athenian heavy infantry were\ndrawn up by Nisaea and the sea; but the light troops being scattered\nover the plain were attacked by the Boeotian horse and driven to the\nsea, being taken entirely by surprise, as on previous occasions no\nrelief had ever come to the Megarians from any quarter. Here the\nBoeotians were in their turn charged and engaged by the Athenian horse,\nand a cavalry action ensued which lasted a long time, and in which\nboth parties claimed the victory. The Athenians killed and stripped\nthe leader of the Boeotian horse and some few of his comrades who had\ncharged right up to Nisaea, and remaining masters of the bodies gave\nthem back under truce, and set up a trophy; but regarding the action\nas a whole the forces separated without either side having gained\na decisive advantage, the Boeotians returning to their army and the\nAthenians to Nisaea.\n\nAfter this Brasidas and the army came nearer to the sea and to Megara,\nand taking up a convenient position, remained quiet in order of battle,\nexpecting to be attacked by the Athenians and knowing that the Megarians\nwere waiting to see which would be the victor. This attitude seemed\nto present two advantages. Without taking the offensive or willingly\nprovoking the hazards of a battle, they openly showed their readiness to\nfight, and thus without bearing the burden of the day would fairly\nreap its honours; while at the same time they effectually served their\ninterests at Megara. For if they had failed to show themselves they\nwould not have had a chance, but would have certainly been considered\nvanquished, and have lost the town. As it was, the Athenians might\npossibly not be inclined to accept their challenge, and their object\nwould be attained without fighting. And so it turned out. The Athenians\nformed outside the long walls and, the enemy not attacking, there\nremained motionless; their generals having decided that the risk was too\nunequal. In fact most of their objects had been already attained; and\nthey would have to begin a battle against superior numbers, and if\nvictorious could only gain Megara, while a defeat would destroy the\nflower of their heavy soldiery. For the enemy it was different; as even\nthe states actually represented in his army risked each only a part of\nits entire force, he might well be more audacious. Accordingly, after\nwaiting for some time without either side attacking, the Athenians\nwithdrew to Nisaea, and the Peloponnesians after them to the point from\nwhich they had set out. The friends of the Megarian exiles now threw\naside their hesitation, and opened the gates to Brasidas and the\ncommanders from the different states--looking upon him as the victor\nand upon the Athenians as having declined the battle--and receiving\nthem into the town proceeded to discuss matters with them; the party in\ncorrespondence with the Athenians being paralysed by the turn things had\ntaken.\n\nAfterwards Brasidas let the allies go home, and himself went back\nto Corinth, to prepare for his expedition to Thrace, his original\ndestination. The Athenians also returning home, the Megarians in the\ncity most implicated in the Athenian negotiation, knowing that they had\nbeen detected, presently disappeared; while the rest conferred with the\nfriends of the exiles, and restored the party at Pegae, after binding\nthem under solemn oaths to take no vengeance for the past, and only to\nconsult the real interests of the town. However, as soon as they were\nin office, they held a review of the heavy infantry, and separating the\nbattalions, picked out about a hundred of their enemies, and of those\nwho were thought to be most involved in the correspondence with the\nAthenians, brought them before the people, and compelling the vote to be\ngiven openly, had them condemned and executed, and established a close\noligarchy in the town--a revolution which lasted a very long while,\nalthough effected by a very few partisans.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n_Eighth and Ninth Years of the War--Invasion of Boeotia--Fall of\nAmphipolis--Brilliant Successes of Brasidas_\n\nThe same summer the Mitylenians were about to fortify Antandrus, as\nthey had intended, when Demodocus and Aristides, the commanders of the\nAthenian squadron engaged in levying subsidies, heard on the Hellespont\nof what was being done to the place (Lamachus their colleague having\nsailed with ten ships into the Pontus) and conceived fears of its\nbecoming a second Anaia-the place in which the Samian exiles had\nestablished themselves to annoy Samos, helping the Peloponnesians by\nsending pilots to their navy, and keeping the city in agitation and\nreceiving all its outlaws. They accordingly got together a force from\nthe allies and set sail, defeated in battle the troops that met them\nfrom Antandrus, and retook the place. Not long after, Lamachus, who had\nsailed into the Pontus, lost his ships at anchor in the river Calex, in\nthe territory of Heraclea, rain having fallen in the interior and the\nflood coming suddenly down upon them; and himself and his troops passed\nby land through the Bithynian Thracians on the Asiatic side, and arrived\nat Chalcedon, the Megarian colony at the mouth of the Pontus.\n\nThe same summer the Athenian general, Demosthenes, arrived at Naupactus\nwith forty ships immediately after the return from the Megarid.\nHippocrates and himself had had overtures made to them by certain men\nin the cities in Boeotia, who wished to change the constitution and\nintroduce a democracy as at Athens; Ptoeodorus, a Theban exile, being\nthe chief mover in this intrigue. The seaport town of Siphae, in the bay\nof Crisae, in the Thespian territory, was to be betrayed to them by one\nparty; Chaeronea (a dependency of what was formerly called the Minyan,\nnow the Boeotian, Orchomenus) to be put into their hands by another from\nthat town, whose exiles were very active in the business, hiring men in\nPeloponnese. Some Phocians also were in the plot, Chaeronea being the\nfrontier town of Boeotia and close to Phanotis in Phocia. Meanwhile\nthe Athenians were to seize Delium, the sanctuary of Apollo, in the\nterritory of Tanagra looking towards Euboea; and all these events were\nto take place simultaneously upon a day appointed, in order that the\nBoeotians might be unable to unite to oppose them at Delium, being\neverywhere detained by disturbances at home. Should the enterprise\nsucceed, and Delium be fortified, its authors confidently expected that\neven if no revolution should immediately follow in Boeotia, yet\nwith these places in their hands, and the country being harassed by\nincursions, and a refuge in each instance near for the partisans engaged\nin them, things would not remain as they were, but that the rebels being\nsupported by the Athenians and the forces of the oligarchs divided, it\nwould be possible after a while to settle matters according to their\nwishes.\n\nSuch was the plot in contemplation. Hippocrates with a force raised at\nhome awaited the proper moment to take the field against the Boeotians;\nwhile he sent on Demosthenes with the forty ships above mentioned to\nNaupactus, to raise in those parts an army of Acarnanians and of the\nother allies, and sail and receive Siphae from the conspirators; a\nday having been agreed on for the simultaneous execution of both these\noperations. Demosthenes on his arrival found Oeniadae already compelled\nby the united Acarnanians to join the Athenian confederacy, and himself\nraising all the allies in those countries marched against and subdued\nSalynthius and the Agraeans; after which he devoted himself to the\npreparations necessary to enable him to be at Siphae by the time\nappointed.\n\nAbout the same time in the summer, Brasidas set out on his march for the\nThracian places with seventeen hundred heavy infantry, and arriving at\nHeraclea in Trachis, from thence sent on a messenger to his friends\nat Pharsalus, to ask them to conduct himself and his army through the\ncountry. Accordingly there came to Melitia in Achaia Panaerus, Dorus,\nHippolochidas, Torylaus, and Strophacus, the Chalcidian proxenus, under\nwhose escort he resumed his march, being accompanied also by other\nThessalians, among whom was Niconidas from Larissa, a friend of\nPerdiccas. It was never very easy to traverse Thessaly without an\nescort; and throughout all Hellas for an armed force to pass without\nleave through a neighbour's country was a delicate step to take. Besides\nthis the Thessalian people had always sympathized with the Athenians.\nIndeed if instead of the customary close oligarchy there had been a\nconstitutional government in Thessaly, he would never have been able\nto proceed; since even as it was, he was met on his march at the\nriver Enipeus by certain of the opposite party who forbade his further\nprogress, and complained of his making the attempt without the consent\nof the nation. To this his escort answered that they had no intention\nof taking him through against their will; they were only friends in\nattendance on an unexpected visitor. Brasidas himself added that he came\nas a friend to Thessaly and its inhabitants, his arms not being directed\nagainst them but against the Athenians, with whom he was at war,\nand that although he knew of no quarrel between the Thessalians and\nLacedaemonians to prevent the two nations having access to each other's\nterritory, he neither would nor could proceed against their wishes; he\ncould only beg them not to stop him. With this answer they went away,\nand he took the advice of his escort, and pushed on without halting,\nbefore a greater force might gather to prevent him. Thus in the day that\nhe set out from Melitia he performed the whole distance to Pharsalus,\nand encamped on the river Apidanus; and so to Phacium and from thence to\nPerrhaebia. Here his Thessalian escort went back, and the Perrhaebians,\nwho are subjects of Thessaly, set him down at Dium in the dominions\nof Perdiccas, a Macedonian town under Mount Olympus, looking towards\nThessaly.\n\nIn this way Brasidas hurried through Thessaly before any one could\nbe got ready to stop him, and reached Perdiccas and Chalcidice. The\ndeparture of the army from Peloponnese had been procured by the\nThracian towns in revolt against Athens and by Perdiccas, alarmed at the\nsuccesses of the Athenians. The Chalcidians thought that they would be\nthe first objects of an Athenian expedition, not that the neighbouring\ntowns which had not yet revolted did not also secretly join in the\ninvitation; and Perdiccas also had his apprehensions on account of his\nold quarrels with the Athenians, although not openly at war with them,\nand above all wished to reduce Arrhabaeus, king of the Lyncestians. It\nhad been less difficult for them to get an army to leave Peloponnese,\nbecause of the ill fortune of the Lacedaemonians at the present moment.\nThe attacks of the Athenians upon Peloponnese, and in particular upon\nLaconia, might, it was hoped, be diverted most effectually by annoying\nthem in return, and by sending an army to their allies, especially\nas they were willing to maintain it and asked for it to aid them in\nrevolting. The Lacedaemonians were also glad to have an excuse for\nsending some of the Helots out of the country, for fear that the present\naspect of affairs and the occupation of Pylos might encourage them to\nmove. Indeed fear of their numbers and obstinacy even persuaded the\nLacedaemonians to the action which I shall now relate, their policy at\nall times having been governed by the necessity of taking precautions\nagainst them. The Helots were invited by a proclamation to pick out\nthose of their number who claimed to have most distinguished themselves\nagainst the enemy, in order that they might receive their freedom; the\nobject being to test them, as it was thought that the first to claim\ntheir freedom would be the most high-spirited and the most apt to\nrebel. As many as two thousand were selected accordingly, who crowned\nthemselves and went round the temples, rejoicing in their new freedom.\nThe Spartans, however, soon afterwards did away with them, and no one\never knew how each of them perished. The Spartans now therefore gladly\nsent seven hundred as heavy infantry with Brasidas, who recruited the\nrest of his force by means of money in Peloponnese.\n\nBrasidas himself was sent out by the Lacedaemonians mainly at his\nown desire, although the Chalcidians also were eager to have a man so\nthorough as he had shown himself whenever there was anything to be done\nat Sparta, and whose after-service abroad proved of the utmost use to\nhis country. At the present moment his just and moderate conduct towards\nthe towns generally succeeded in procuring their revolt, besides\nthe places which he managed to take by treachery; and thus when the\nLacedaemonians desired to treat, as they ultimately did, they had places\nto offer in exchange, and the burden of war meanwhile shifted from\nPeloponnese. Later on in the war, after the events in Sicily, the\npresent valour and conduct of Brasidas, known by experience to some,\nby hearsay to others, was what mainly created in the allies of Athens a\nfeeling for the Lacedaemonians. He was the first who went out and\nshowed himself so good a man at all points as to leave behind him the\nconviction that the rest were like him.\n\nMeanwhile his arrival in the Thracian country no sooner became known\nto the Athenians than they declared war against Perdiccas, whom they\nregarded as the author of the expedition, and kept a closer watch on\ntheir allies in that quarter.\n\nUpon the arrival of Brasidas and his army, Perdiccas immediately started\nwith them and with his own forces against Arrhabaeus, son of Bromerus,\nking of the Lyncestian Macedonians, his neighbour, with whom he had a\nquarrel and whom he wished to subdue. However, when he arrived with his\narmy and Brasidas at the pass leading into Lyncus, Brasidas told him\nthat before commencing hostilities he wished to go and try to persuade\nArrhabaeus to become the ally of Lacedaemon, this latter having already\nmade overtures intimating his willingness to make Brasidas arbitrator\nbetween them, and the Chalcidian envoys accompanying him having warned\nhim not to remove the apprehensions of Perdiccas, in order to ensure his\ngreater zeal in their cause. Besides, the envoys of Perdiccas had talked\nat Lacedaemon about his bringing many of the places round him into\nalliance with them; and thus Brasidas thought he might take a larger\nview of the question of Arrhabaeus. Perdiccas however retorted that he\nhad not brought him with him to arbitrate in their quarrel, but to put\ndown the enemies whom he might point out to him; and that while he,\nPerdiccas, maintained half his army it was a breach of faith for\nBrasidas to parley with Arrhabaeus. Nevertheless Brasidas disregarded\nthe wishes of Perdiccas and held the parley in spite of him, and\nsuffered himself to be persuaded to lead off the army without invading\nthe country of Arrhabaeus; after which Perdiccas, holding that faith had\nnot been kept with him, contributed only a third instead of half of the\nsupport of the army.\n\nThe same summer, without loss of time, Brasidas marched with the\nChalcidians against Acanthus, a colony of the Andrians, a little before\nvintage. The inhabitants were divided into two parties on the question\nof receiving him; those who had joined the Chalcidians in inviting him,\nand the popular party. However, fear for their fruit, which was still\nout, enabled Brasidas to persuade the multitude to admit him alone, and\nto hear what he had to say before making a decision; and he was admitted\naccordingly and appeared before the people, and not being a bad speaker\nfor a Lacedaemonian, addressed them as follows:\n\n\"Acanthians, the Lacedaemonians have sent out me and my army to make\ngood the reason that we gave for the war when we began it, viz., that we\nwere going to war with the Athenians in order to free Hellas. Our delay\nin coming has been caused by mistaken expectations as to the war at\nhome, which led us to hope, by our own unassisted efforts and without\nyour risking anything, to effect the speedy downfall of the Athenians;\nand you must not blame us for this, as we are now come the moment that\nwe were able, prepared with your aid to do our best to subdue them.\nMeanwhile I am astonished at finding your gates shut against me, and at\nnot meeting with a better welcome. We Lacedaemonians thought of you as\nallies eager to have us, to whom we should come in spirit even before we\nwere with you in body; and in this expectation undertook all the risks\nof a march of many days through a strange country, so far did our zeal\ncarry us. It will be a terrible thing if after this you have other\nintentions, and mean to stand in the way of your own and Hellenic\nfreedom. It is not merely that you oppose me yourselves; but wherever I\nmay go people will be less inclined to join me, on the score that you,\nto whom I first came--an important town like Acanthus, and prudent men\nlike the Acanthians--refused to admit me. I shall have nothing to prove\nthat the reason which I advance is the true one; it will be said either\nthat there is something unfair in the freedom which I offer, or that\nI am in insufficient force and unable to protect you against an attack\nfrom Athens. Yet when I went with the army which I now have to the\nrelief of Nisaea, the Athenians did not venture to engage me although\nin greater force than I; and it is not likely they will ever send across\nsea against you an army as numerous as they had at Nisaea. And for\nmyself, I have come here not to hurt but to free the Hellenes, witness\nthe solemn oaths by which I have bound my government that the allies\nthat I may bring over shall be independent; and besides my object in\ncoming is not by force or fraud to obtain your alliance, but to\noffer you mine to help you against your Athenian masters. I protest,\ntherefore, against any suspicions of my intentions after the guarantees\nwhich I offer, and equally so against doubts of my ability to protect\nyou, and I invite you to join me without hesitation.\n\n\"Some of you may hang back because they have private enemies, and fear\nthat I may put the city into the hands of a party: none need be more\ntranquil than they. I am not come here to help this party or that; and I\ndo not consider that I should be bringing you freedom in any real sense,\nif I should disregard your constitution, and enslave the many to the few\nor the few to the many. This would be heavier than a foreign yoke; and\nwe Lacedaemonians, instead of being thanked for our pains, should get\nneither honour nor glory, but, contrariwise, reproaches. The charges\nwhich strengthen our hands in the war against the Athenians would on\nour own showing be merited by ourselves, and more hateful in us than in\nthose who make no pretensions to honesty; as it is more disgraceful for\npersons of character to take what they covet by fair-seeming fraud than\nby open force; the one aggression having for its justification the might\nwhich fortune gives, the other being simply a piece of clever roguery.\nA matter which concerns us thus nearly we naturally look to most\njealously; and over and above the oaths that I have mentioned, what\nstronger assurance can you have, when you see that our words, compared\nwith the actual facts, produce the necessary conviction that it is our\ninterest to act as we say?\n\n\"If to these considerations of mine you put in the plea of inability,\nand claim that your friendly feeling should save you from being hurt by\nyour refusal; if you say that freedom, in your opinion, is not without\nits dangers, and that it is right to offer it to those who can accept\nit, but not to force it on any against their will, then I shall take the\ngods and heroes of your country to witness that I came for your good and\nwas rejected, and shall do my best to compel you by laying waste your\nland. I shall do so without scruple, being justified by the necessity\nwhich constrains me, first, to prevent the Lacedaemonians from being\ndamaged by you, their friends, in the event of your nonadhesion, through\nthe moneys that you pay to the Athenians; and secondly, to prevent the\nHellenes from being hindered by you in shaking off their servitude.\nOtherwise indeed we should have no right to act as we propose; except\nin the name of some public interest, what call should we Lacedaemonians\nhave to free those who do not wish it? Empire we do not aspire to: it\nis what we are labouring to put down; and we should wrong the greater\nnumber if we allowed you to stand in the way of the independence that\nwe offer to all. Endeavour, therefore, to decide wisely, and strive to\nbegin the work of liberation for the Hellenes, and lay up for\nyourselves endless renown, while you escape private loss, and cover your\ncommonwealth with glory.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Brasidas. The Acanthians, after much had been\nsaid on both sides of the question, gave their votes in secret, and the\nmajority, influenced by the seductive arguments of Brasidas and by fear\nfor their fruit, decided to revolt from Athens; not however admitting\nthe army until they had taken his personal security for the oaths sworn\nby his government before they sent him out, assuring the independence of\nthe allies whom he might bring over. Not long after, Stagirus, a colony\nof the Andrians, followed their example and revolted.\n\nSuch were the events of this summer. It was in the first days of the\nwinter following that the places in Boeotia were to be put into the\nhands of the Athenian generals, Hippocrates and Demosthenes, the latter\nof whom was to go with his ships to Siphae, the former to Delium. A\nmistake, however, was made in the days on which they were each to start;\nand Demosthenes, sailing first to Siphae, with the Acarnanians and many\nof the allies from those parts on board, failed to effect anything,\nthrough the plot having been betrayed by Nicomachus, a Phocian from\nPhanotis, who told the Lacedaemonians, and they the Boeotians. Succours\naccordingly flocked in from all parts of Boeotia, Hippocrates not being\nyet there to make his diversion, and Siphae and Chaeronea were promptly\nsecured, and the conspirators, informed of the mistake, did not venture\non any movement in the towns.\n\nMeanwhile Hippocrates made a levy in mass of the citizens, resident\naliens, and foreigners in Athens, and arrived at his destination after\nthe Boeotians had already come back from Siphae, and encamping his\narmy began to fortify Delium, the sanctuary of Apollo, in the following\nmanner. A trench was dug all round the temple and the consecrated\nground, and the earth thrown up from the excavation was made to do\nduty as a wall, in which stakes were also planted, the vines round the\nsanctuary being cut down and thrown in, together with stones and bricks\npulled down from the houses near; every means, in short, being used\nto run up the rampart. Wooden towers were also erected where they\nwere wanted, and where there was no part of the temple buildings left\nstanding, as on the side where the gallery once existing had fallen in.\nThe work was begun on the third day after leaving home, and continued\nduring the fourth, and till dinnertime on the fifth, when most of it\nbeing now finished the army removed from Delium about a mile and a\nquarter on its way home. From this point most of the light troops went\nstraight on, while the heavy infantry halted and remained where they\nwere; Hippocrates having stayed behind at Delium to arrange the posts,\nand to give directions for the completion of such part of the outworks\nas had been left unfinished.\n\nDuring the days thus employed the Boeotians were mustering at Tanagra,\nand by the time that they had come in from all the towns, found the\nAthenians already on their way home. The rest of the eleven Boeotarchs\nwere against giving battle, as the enemy was no longer in Boeotia, the\nAthenians being just over the Oropian border, when they halted; but\nPagondas, son of Aeolidas, one of the Boeotarchs of Thebes (Arianthides,\nson of Lysimachidas, being the other), and then commander-in-chief,\nthought it best to hazard a battle. He accordingly called the men to\nhim, company after company, to prevent their all leaving their arms at\nonce, and urged them to attack the Athenians, and stand the issue of a\nbattle, speaking as follows:\n\n\"Boeotians, the idea that we ought not to give battle to the Athenians,\nunless we came up with them in Boeotia, is one which should never have\nentered into the head of any of us, your generals. It was to annoy\nBoeotia that they crossed the frontier and built a fort in our country;\nand they are therefore, I imagine, our enemies wherever we may come up\nwith them, and from wheresoever they may have come to act as enemies\ndo. And if any one has taken up with the idea in question for reasons of\nsafety, it is high time for him to change his mind. The party attacked,\nwhose own country is in danger, can scarcely discuss what is prudent\nwith the calmness of men who are in full enjoyment of what they have\ngot, and are thinking of attacking a neighbour in order to get more. It\nis your national habit, in your country or out of it, to oppose the same\nresistance to a foreign invader; and when that invader is Athenian, and\nlives upon your frontier besides, it is doubly imperative to do so. As\nbetween neighbours generally, freedom means simply a determination\nto hold one's own; and with neighbours like these, who are trying to\nenslave near and far alike, there is nothing for it but to fight it out\nto the last. Look at the condition of the Euboeans and of most of the\nrest of Hellas, and be convinced that others have to fight with their\nneighbours for this frontier or that, but that for us conquest means one\nfrontier for the whole country, about which no dispute can be made, for\nthey will simply come and take by force what we have. So much more have\nwe to fear from this neighbour than from another. Besides, people who,\nlike the Athenians in the present instance, are tempted by pride of\nstrength to attack their neighbours, usually march most confidently\nagainst those who keep still, and only defend themselves in their own\ncountry, but think twice before they grapple with those who meet them\noutside their frontier and strike the first blow if opportunity offers.\nThe Athenians have shown us this themselves; the defeat which we\ninflicted upon them at Coronea, at the time when our quarrels had\nallowed them to occupy the country, has given great security to Boeotia\nuntil the present day. Remembering this, the old must equal their\nancient exploits, and the young, the sons of the heroes of that time,\nmust endeavour not to disgrace their native valour; and trusting in the\nhelp of the god whose temple has been sacrilegiously fortified, and\nin the victims which in our sacrifices have proved propitious, we must\nmarch against the enemy, and teach him that he must go and get what he\nwants by attacking someone who will not resist him, but that men whose\nglory it is to be always ready to give battle for the liberty of their\nown country, and never unjustly to enslave that of others, will not let\nhim go without a struggle.\"\n\nBy these arguments Pagondas persuaded the Boeotians to attack the\nAthenians, and quickly breaking up his camp led his army forward, it\nbeing now late in the day. On nearing the enemy, he halted in a position\nwhere a hill intervening prevented the two armies from seeing each\nother, and then formed and prepared for action. Meanwhile Hippocrates\nat Delium, informed of the approach of the Boeotians, sent orders to his\ntroops to throw themselves into line, and himself joined them not long\nafterwards, leaving about three hundred horse behind him at Delium,\nat once to guard the place in case of attack, and to watch their\nopportunity and fall upon the Boeotians during the battle. The Boeotians\nplaced a detachment to deal with these, and when everything was arranged\nto their satisfaction appeared over the hill, and halted in the order\nwhich they had determined on, to the number of seven thousand heavy\ninfantry, more than ten thousand light troops, one thousand horse, and\nfive hundred targeteers. On their right were the Thebans and those of\ntheir province, in the centre the Haliartians, Coronaeans, Copaeans,\nand the other people around the lake, and on the left the Thespians,\nTanagraeans, and Orchomenians, the cavalry and the light troops being at\nthe extremity of each wing. The Thebans formed twenty-five shields deep,\nthe rest as they pleased. Such was the strength and disposition of the\nBoeotian army.\n\nOn the side of the Athenians, the heavy infantry throughout the whole\narmy formed eight deep, being in numbers equal to the enemy, with the\ncavalry upon the two wings. Light troops regularly armed there were none\nin the army, nor had there ever been any at Athens. Those who had joined\nin the invasion, though many times more numerous than those of the\nenemy, had mostly followed unarmed, as part of the levy in mass of the\ncitizens and foreigners at Athens, and having started first on their way\nhome were not present in any number. The armies being now in line and\nupon the point of engaging, Hippocrates, the general, passed along the\nAthenian ranks, and encouraged them as follows:\n\n\"Athenians, I shall only say a few words to you, but brave men require\nno more, and they are addressed more to your understanding than to your\ncourage. None of you must fancy that we are going out of our way to\nrun this risk in the country of another. Fought in their territory the\nbattle will be for ours: if we conquer, the Peloponnesians will never\ninvade your country without the Boeotian horse, and in one battle you\nwill win Boeotia and in a manner free Attica. Advance to meet them\nthen like citizens of a country in which you all glory as the first in\nHellas, and like sons of the fathers who beat them at Oenophyta with\nMyronides and thus gained possession of Boeotia.\"\n\nHippocrates had got half through the army with his exhortation, when\nthe Boeotians, after a few more hasty words from Pagondas, struck up the\npaean, and came against them from the hill; the Athenians advancing to\nmeet them, and closing at a run. The extreme wing of neither army came\ninto action, one like the other being stopped by the water-courses in\nthe way; the rest engaged with the utmost obstinacy, shield against\nshield. The Boeotian left, as far as the centre, was worsted by the\nAthenians. The Thespians in that part of the field suffered most\nseverely. The troops alongside them having given way, they were\nsurrounded in a narrow space and cut down fighting hand to hand; some\nof the Athenians also fell into confusion in surrounding the enemy\nand mistook and so killed each other. In this part of the field the\nBoeotians were beaten, and retreated upon the troops still fighting; but\nthe right, where the Thebans were, got the better of the Athenians and\nshoved them further and further back, though gradually at first. It so\nhappened also that Pagondas, seeing the distress of his left, had sent\ntwo squadrons of horse, where they could not be seen, round the hill,\nand their sudden appearance struck a panic into the victorious wing of\nthe Athenians, who thought that it was another army coming against them.\nAt length in both parts of the field, disturbed by this panic, and with\ntheir line broken by the advancing Thebans, the whole Athenian army took\nto flight. Some made for Delium and the sea, some for Oropus, others for\nMount Parnes, or wherever they had hopes of safety, pursued and cut down\nby the Boeotians, and in particular by the cavalry, composed partly\nof Boeotians and partly of Locrians, who had come up just as the rout\nbegan. Night however coming on to interrupt the pursuit, the mass of the\nfugitives escaped more easily than they would otherwise have done. The\nnext day the troops at Oropus and Delium returned home by sea, after\nleaving a garrison in the latter place, which they continued to hold\nnotwithstanding the defeat.\n\nThe Boeotians set up a trophy, took up their own dead, and stripped\nthose of the enemy, and leaving a guard over them retired to Tanagra,\nthere to take measures for attacking Delium. Meanwhile a herald came\nfrom the Athenians to ask for the dead, but was met and turned back by\na Boeotian herald, who told him that he would effect nothing until\nthe return of himself the Boeotian herald, and who then went on to the\nAthenians, and told them on the part of the Boeotians that they had\ndone wrong in transgressing the law of the Hellenes. Of what use was the\nuniversal custom protecting the temples in an invaded country, if the\nAthenians were to fortify Delium and live there, acting exactly as\nif they were on unconsecrated ground, and drawing and using for their\npurposes the water which they, the Boeotians, never touched except for\nsacred uses? Accordingly for the god as well as for themselves, in the\nname of the deities concerned, and of Apollo, the Boeotians invited them\nfirst to evacuate the temple, if they wished to take up the dead that\nbelonged to them.\n\nAfter these words from the herald, the Athenians sent their own herald\nto the Boeotians to say that they had not done any wrong to the temple,\nand for the future would do it no more harm than they could help;\nnot having occupied it originally in any such design, but to defend\nthemselves from it against those who were really wronging them. The law\nof the Hellenes was that conquest of a country, whether more or less\nextensive, carried with it possession of the temples in that country,\nwith the obligation to keep up the usual ceremonies, at least as far\nas possible. The Boeotians and most other people who had turned out the\nowners of a country, and put themselves in their places by force, now\nheld as of right the temples which they originally entered as usurpers.\nIf the Athenians could have conquered more of Boeotia this would have\nbeen the case with them: as things stood, the piece of it which they\nhad got they should treat as their own, and not quit unless obliged. The\nwater they had disturbed under the impulsion of a necessity which they\nhad not wantonly incurred, having been forced to use it in defending\nthemselves against the Boeotians who first invaded Attica. Besides,\nanything done under the pressure of war and danger might reasonably\nclaim indulgence even in the eye of the god; or why, pray, were the\naltars the asylum for involuntary offences? Transgression also was a\nterm applied to presumptuous offenders, not to the victims of adverse\ncircumstances. In short, which were most impious--the Boeotians who\nwished to barter dead bodies for holy places, or the Athenians who\nrefused to give up holy places to obtain what was theirs by right? The\ncondition of evacuating Boeotia must therefore be withdrawn. They were\nno longer in Boeotia. They stood where they stood by the right of the\nsword. All that the Boeotians had to do was to tell them to take up\ntheir dead under a truce according to the national custom.\n\nThe Boeotians replied that if they were in Boeotia, they must evacuate\nthat country before taking up their dead; if they were in their own\nterritory, they could do as they pleased: for they knew that, although\nthe Oropid where the bodies as it chanced were lying (the battle having\nbeen fought on the borders) was subject to Athens, yet the Athenians\ncould not get them without their leave. Besides, why should they grant a\ntruce for Athenian ground? And what could be fairer than to tell them\nto evacuate Boeotia if they wished to get what they asked? The\nAthenian herald accordingly returned with this answer, without having\naccomplished his object.\n\nMeanwhile the Boeotians at once sent for darters and slingers from the\nMalian Gulf, and with two thousand Corinthian heavy infantry who had\njoined them after the battle, the Peloponnesian garrison which had\nevacuated Nisaea, and some Megarians with them, marched against Delium,\nand attacked the fort, and after divers efforts finally succeeded in\ntaking it by an engine of the following description. They sawed in two\nand scooped out a great beam from end to end, and fitting it nicely\ntogether again like a pipe, hung by chains a cauldron at one extremity,\nwith which communicated an iron tube projecting from the beam, which\nwas itself in great part plated with iron. This they brought up from\na distance upon carts to the part of the wall principally composed of\nvines and timber, and when it was near, inserted huge bellows into their\nend of the beam and blew with them. The blast passing closely confined\ninto the cauldron, which was filled with lighted coals, sulphur and\npitch, made a great blaze, and set fire to the wall, which soon became\nuntenable for its defenders, who left it and fled; and in this way the\nfort was taken. Of the garrison some were killed and two hundred made\nprisoners; most of the rest got on board their ships and returned home.\n\nSoon after the fall of Delium, which took place seventeen days after\nthe battle, the Athenian herald, without knowing what had happened, came\nagain for the dead, which were now restored by the Boeotians, who no\nlonger answered as at first. Not quite five hundred Boeotians fell in\nthe battle, and nearly one thousand Athenians, including Hippocrates the\ngeneral, besides a great number of light troops and camp followers.\n\nSoon after this battle Demosthenes, after the failure of his voyage to\nSiphae and of the plot on the town, availed himself of the Acarnanian\nand Agraean troops and of the four hundred Athenian heavy infantry\nwhich he had on board, to make a descent on the Sicyonian coast. Before\nhowever all his ships had come to shore, the Sicyonians came up and\nrouted and chased to their ships those that had landed, killing some and\ntaking others prisoners; after which they set up a trophy, and gave back\nthe dead under truce.\n\nAbout the same time with the affair of Delium took place the death\nof Sitalces, king of the Odrysians, who was defeated in battle, in a\ncampaign against the Triballi; Seuthes, son of Sparadocus, his nephew,\nsucceeding to the kingdom of the Odrysians, and of the rest of Thrace\nruled by Sitalces.\n\nThe same winter Brasidas, with his allies in the Thracian places,\nmarched against Amphipolis, the Athenian colony on the river Strymon.\nA settlement upon the spot on which the city now stands was before\nattempted by Aristagoras, the Milesian (when he fled from King Darius),\nwho was however dislodged by the Edonians; and thirty-two years later\nby the Athenians, who sent thither ten thousand settlers of their own\ncitizens, and whoever else chose to go. These were cut off at Drabescus\nby the Thracians. Twenty-nine years after, the Athenians returned\n(Hagnon, son of Nicias, being sent out as leader of the colony) and\ndrove out the Edonians, and founded a town on the spot, formerly called\nEnnea Hodoi or Nine Ways. The base from which they started was Eion,\ntheir commercial seaport at the mouth of the river, not more than three\nmiles from the present town, which Hagnon named Amphipolis, because\nthe Strymon flows round it on two sides, and he built it so as to be\nconspicuous from the sea and land alike, running a long wall across from\nriver to river, to complete the circumference.\n\nBrasidas now marched against this town, starting from Arne in\nChalcidice. Arriving about dusk at Aulon and Bromiscus, where the lake\nof Bolbe runs into the sea, he supped there, and went on during the\nnight. The weather was stormy and it was snowing a little, which\nencouraged him to hurry on, in order, if possible, to take every one at\nAmphipolis by surprise, except the party who were to betray it. The plot\nwas carried on by some natives of Argilus, an Andrian colony, residing\nin Amphipolis, where they had also other accomplices gained over by\nPerdiccas or the Chalcidians. But the most active in the matter were the\ninhabitants of Argilus itself, which is close by, who had always been\nsuspected by the Athenians, and had had designs on the place. These men\nnow saw their opportunity arrive with Brasidas, and having for some\ntime been in correspondence with their countrymen in Amphipolis for the\nbetrayal of the town, at once received him into Argilus, and revolted\nfrom the Athenians, and that same night took him on to the bridge over\nthe river; where he found only a small guard to oppose him, the town\nbeing at some distance from the passage, and the walls not reaching down\nto it as at present. This guard he easily drove in, partly through\nthere being treason in their ranks, partly from the stormy state of the\nweather and the suddenness of his attack, and so got across the\nbridge, and immediately became master of all the property outside; the\nAmphipolitans having houses all over the quarter.\n\nThe passage of Brasidas was a complete surprise to the people in the\ntown; and the capture of many of those outside, and the flight of the\nrest within the wall, combined to produce great confusion among the\ncitizens; especially as they did not trust one another. It is even said\nthat if Brasidas, instead of stopping to pillage, had advanced straight\nagainst the town, he would probably have taken it. In fact, however, he\nestablished himself where he was and overran the country outside, and\nfor the present remained inactive, vainly awaiting a demonstration\non the part of his friends within. Meanwhile the party opposed to the\ntraitors proved numerous enough to prevent the gates being immediately\nthrown open, and in concert with Eucles, the general, who had come\nfrom Athens to defend the place, sent to the other commander in Thrace,\nThucydides, son of Olorus, the author of this history, who was at the\nisle of Thasos, a Parian colony, half a day's sail from Amphipolis, to\ntell him to come to their relief. On receipt of this message he at once\nset sail with seven ships which he had with him, in order, if possible,\nto reach Amphipolis in time to prevent its capitulation, or in any case\nto save Eion.\n\nMeanwhile Brasidas, afraid of succours arriving by sea from Thasos, and\nlearning that Thucydides possessed the right of working the gold\nmines in that part of Thrace, and had thus great influence with the\ninhabitants of the continent, hastened to gain the town, if possible,\nbefore the people of Amphipolis should be encouraged by his arrival to\nhope that he could save them by getting together a force of allies from\nthe sea and from Thrace, and so refuse to surrender. He accordingly\noffered moderate terms, proclaiming that any of the Amphipolitans and\nAthenians who chose, might continue to enjoy their property with full\nrights of citizenship; while those who did not wish to stay had five\ndays to depart, taking their property with them.\n\nThe bulk of the inhabitants, upon hearing this, began to change their\nminds, especially as only a small number of the citizens were Athenians,\nthe majority having come from different quarters, and many of the\nprisoners outside had relations within the walls. They found the\nproclamation a fair one in comparison of what their fear had suggested;\nthe Athenians being glad to go out, as they thought they ran more risk\nthan the rest, and further, did not expect any speedy relief, and the\nmultitude generally being content at being left in possession of their\ncivic rights, and at such an unexpected reprieve from danger. The\npartisans of Brasidas now openly advocated this course, seeing that the\nfeeling of the people had changed, and that they no longer gave ear\nto the Athenian general present; and thus the surrender was made and\nBrasidas was admitted by them on the terms of his proclamation. In this\nway they gave up the city, and late in the same day Thucydides and his\nships entered the harbour of Eion, Brasidas having just got hold of\nAmphipolis, and having been within a night of taking Eion: had the ships\nbeen less prompt in relieving it, in the morning it would have been his.\n\nAfter this Thucydides put all in order at Eion to secure it against any\npresent or future attack of Brasidas, and received such as had elected\nto come there from the interior according to the terms agreed on.\nMeanwhile Brasidas suddenly sailed with a number of boats down the river\nto Eion to see if he could not seize the point running out from the\nwall, and so command the entrance; at the same time he attempted it by\nland, but was beaten off on both sides and had to content himself with\narranging matters at Amphipolis and in the neighbourhood. Myrcinus, an\nEdonian town, also came over to him; the Edonian king Pittacus having\nbeen killed by the sons of Goaxis and his own wife Brauro; and Galepsus\nand Oesime, which are Thasian colonies, not long after followed its\nexample. Perdiccas too came up immediately after the capture and joined\nin these arrangements.\n\nThe news that Amphipolis was in the hands of the enemy caused great\nalarm at Athens. Not only was the town valuable for the timber it\nafforded for shipbuilding, and the money that it brought in; but also,\nalthough the escort of the Thessalians gave the Lacedaemonians a means\nof reaching the allies of Athens as far as the Strymon, yet as long as\nthey were not masters of the bridge but were watched on the side of Eion\nby the Athenian galleys, and on the land side impeded by a large and\nextensive lake formed by the waters of the river, it was impossible\nfor them to go any further. Now, on the contrary, the path seemed open.\nThere was also the fear of the allies revolting, owing to the moderation\ndisplayed by Brasidas in all his conduct, and to the declarations which\nhe was everywhere making that he sent out to free Hellas. The towns\nsubject to the Athenians, hearing of the capture of Amphipolis and of\nthe terms accorded to it, and of the gentleness of Brasidas, felt most\nstrongly encouraged to change their condition, and sent secret messages\nto him, begging him to come on to them; each wishing to be the first to\nrevolt. Indeed there seemed to be no danger in so doing; their mistake\nin their estimate of the Athenian power was as great as that power\nafterwards turned out to be, and their judgment was based more upon\nblind wishing than upon any sound prevision; for it is a habit of\nmankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for, and to use\nsovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy. Besides the\nlate severe blow which the Athenians had met with in Boeotia, joined\nto the seductive, though untrue, statements of Brasidas, about the\nAthenians not having ventured to engage his single army at Nisaea, made\nthe allies confident, and caused them to believe that no Athenian force\nwould be sent against them. Above all the wish to do what was\nagreeable at the moment, and the likelihood that they should find the\nLacedaemonians full of zeal at starting, made them eager to venture.\nObserving this, the Athenians sent garrisons to the different towns, as\nfar as was possible at such short notice and in winter; while Brasidas\nsent dispatches to Lacedaemon asking for reinforcements, and\nhimself made preparations for building galleys in the Strymon. The\nLacedaemonians however did not send him any, partly through envy on\nthe part of their chief men, partly because they were more bent on\nrecovering the prisoners of the island and ending the war.\n\nThe same winter the Megarians took and razed to the foundations the long\nwalls which had been occupied by the Athenians; and Brasidas after the\ncapture of Amphipolis marched with his allies against Acte, a promontory\nrunning out from the King's dike with an inward curve, and ending\nin Athos, a lofty mountain looking towards the Aegean Sea. In it are\nvarious towns, Sane, an Andrian colony, close to the canal, and facing\nthe sea in the direction of Euboea; the others being Thyssus, Cleone,\nAcrothoi, Olophyxus, and Dium, inhabited by mixed barbarian races\nspeaking the two languages. There is also a small Chalcidian element;\nbut the greater number are Tyrrheno-Pelasgians once settled in Lemnos\nand Athens, and Bisaltians, Crestonians, and Edonians; the towns being\nall small ones. Most of these came over to Brasidas; but Sane and Dium\nheld out and saw their land ravaged by him and his army.\n\nUpon their not submitting, he at once marched against Torone in\nChalcidice, which was held by an Athenian garrison, having been invited\nby a few persons who were prepared to hand over the town. Arriving in\nthe dark a little before daybreak, he sat down with his army near the\ntemple of the Dioscuri, rather more than a quarter of a mile from the\ncity. The rest of the town of Torone and the Athenians in garrison did\nnot perceive his approach; but his partisans knowing that he was coming\n(a few of them had secretly gone out to meet him) were on the watch for\nhis arrival, and were no sooner aware of it than they took it to them\nseven light-armed men with daggers, who alone of twenty men ordered\non this service dared to enter, commanded by Lysistratus an Olynthian.\nThese passed through the sea wall, and without being seen went up and\nput to the sword the garrison of the highest post in the town, which\nstands on a hill, and broke open the postern on the side of Canastraeum.\n\nBrasidas meanwhile came a little nearer and then halted with his main\nbody, sending on one hundred targeteers to be ready to rush in first,\nthe moment that a gate should be thrown open and the beacon lighted as\nagreed. After some time passed in waiting and wondering at the delay,\nthe targeteers by degrees got up close to the town. The Toronaeans\ninside at work with the party that had entered had by this time broken\ndown the postern and opened the gates leading to the market-place by\ncutting through the bar, and first brought some men round and let\nthem in by the postern, in order to strike a panic into the surprised\ntownsmen by suddenly attacking them from behind and on both sides at\nonce; after which they raised the fire-signal as had been agreed, and\ntook in by the market gates the rest of the targeteers.\n\nBrasidas seeing the signal told the troops to rise, and dashed forward\namid the loud hurrahs of his men, which carried dismay among the\nastonished townspeople. Some burst in straight by the gate, others over\nsome square pieces of timber placed against the wall (which has fallen\ndown and was being rebuilt) to draw up stones; Brasidas and the greater\nnumber making straight uphill for the higher part of the town, in order\nto take it from top to bottom, and once for all, while the rest of the\nmultitude spread in all directions.\n\nThe capture of the town was effected before the great body of the\nToronaeans had recovered from their surprise and confusion; but\nthe conspirators and the citizens of their party at once joined the\ninvaders. About fifty of the Athenian heavy infantry happened to be\nsleeping in the market-place when the alarm reached them. A few of these\nwere killed fighting; the rest escaped, some by land, others to the two\nships on the station, and took refuge in Lecythus, a fort garrisoned by\ntheir own men in the corner of the town running out into the sea and\ncut off by a narrow isthmus; where they were joined by the Toronaeans of\ntheir party.\n\nDay now arrived, and the town being secured, Brasidas made a\nproclamation to the Toronaeans who had taken refuge with the Athenians,\nto come out, as many as chose, to their homes without fearing for their\nrights or persons, and sent a herald to invite the Athenians to accept a\ntruce, and to evacuate Lecythus with their property, as being Chalcidian\nground. The Athenians refused this offer, but asked for a truce for a\nday to take up their dead. Brasidas granted it for two days, which he\nemployed in fortifying the houses near, and the Athenians in doing\nthe same to their positions. Meanwhile he called a meeting of the\nToronaeans, and said very much what he had said at Acanthus, namely,\nthat they must not look upon those who had negotiated with him for the\ncapture of the town as bad men or as traitors, as they had not acted as\nthey had done from corrupt motives or in order to enslave the city, but\nfor the good and freedom of Torone; nor again must those who had not\nshared in the enterprise fancy that they would not equally reap its\nfruits, as he had not come to destroy either city or individual. This\nwas the reason of his proclamation to those that had fled for refuge to\nthe Athenians: he thought none the worse of them for their friendship\nfor the Athenians; he believed that they had only to make trial of the\nLacedaemonians to like them as well, or even much better, as acting much\nmore justly: it was for want of such a trial that they were now afraid\nof them. Meanwhile he warned all of them to prepare to be staunch\nallies, and for being held responsible for all faults in future: for the\npast, they had not wronged the Lacedaemonians but had been wronged by\nothers who were too strong for them, and any opposition that they might\nhave offered him could be excused.\n\nHaving encouraged them with this address, as soon as the truce expired\nhe made his attack upon Lecythus; the Athenians defending themselves\nfrom a poor wall and from some houses with parapets. One day they beat\nhim off; the next the enemy were preparing to bring up an engine against\nthem from which they meant to throw fire upon the wooden defences, and\nthe troops were already coming up to the point where they fancied they\ncould best bring up the engine, and where place was most assailable;\nmeanwhile the Athenians put a wooden tower upon a house opposite, and\ncarried up a quantity of jars and casks of water and big stones, and a\nlarge number of men also climbed up. The house thus laden too heavily\nsuddenly broke down with a loud crash; at which the men who were near\nand saw it were more vexed than frightened; but those not so near, and\nstill more those furthest off, thought that the place was already taken\nat that point, and fled in haste to the sea and the ships.\n\nBrasidas, perceiving that they were deserting the parapet, and seeing\nwhat was going on, dashed forward with his troops, and immediately took\nthe fort, and put to the sword all whom he found in it. In this way the\nplace was evacuated by the Athenians, who went across in their boats\nand ships to Pallene. Now there is a temple of Athene in Lecythus, and\nBrasidas had proclaimed in the moment of making the assault that he\nwould give thirty silver minae to the man first on the wall. Being now\nof opinion that the capture was scarcely due to human means, he gave\nthe thirty minae to the goddess for her temple, and razed and cleared\nLecythus, and made the whole of it consecrated ground. The rest of\nthe winter he spent in settling the places in his hands, and in making\ndesigns upon the rest; and with the expiration of the winter the eighth\nyear of this war ended.\n\nIn the spring of the summer following, the Lacedaemonians and Athenians\nmade an armistice for a year; the Athenians thinking that they would\nthus have full leisure to take their precautions before Brasidas could\nprocure the revolt of any more of their towns, and might also, if it\nsuited them, conclude a general peace; the Lacedaemonians divining the\nactual fears of the Athenians, and thinking that after once tasting a\nrespite from trouble and misery they would be more disposed to consent\nto a reconciliation, and to give back the prisoners, and make a treaty\nfor the longer period. The great idea of the Lacedaemonians was to get\nback their men while Brasidas's good fortune lasted: further successes\nmight make the struggle a less unequal one in Chalcidice, but would\nleave them still deprived of their men, and even in Chalcidice not more\nthan a match for the Athenians and by no means certain of victory. An\narmistice was accordingly concluded by Lacedaemon and her allies upon\nthe terms following:\n\n1. As to the temple and oracle of the Pythian Apollo, we are agreed that\nwhosoever will shall have access to it, without fraud or fear, according\nto the usages of his forefathers. The Lacedaemonians and the allies\npresent agree to this, and promise to send heralds to the Boeotians and\nPhocians, and to do their best to persuade them to agree likewise.\n\n2. As to the treasure of the god, we agree to exert ourselves to detect\nall malversators, truly and honestly following the customs of our\nforefathers, we and you and all others willing to do so, all following\nthe customs of our forefathers. As to these points the Lacedaemonians\nand the other allies are agreed as has been said.\n\n3. As to what follows, the Lacedaemonians and the other allies agree,\nif the Athenians conclude a treaty, to remain, each of us in our own\nterritory, retaining our respective acquisitions: the garrison\nin Coryphasium keeping within Buphras and Tomeus: that in Cythera\nattempting no communication with the Peloponnesian confederacy, neither\nwe with them, nor they with us: that in Nisaea and Minoa not crossing\nthe road leading from the gates of the temple of Nisus to that of\nPoseidon and from thence straight to the bridge at Minoa: the Megarians\nand the allies being equally bound not to cross this road, and\nthe Athenians retaining the island they have taken, without any\ncommunication on either side: as to Troezen, each side retaining what it\nhas, and as was arranged with the Athenians.\n\n4. As to the use of the sea, so far as refers to their own coast and to\nthat of their confederacy, that the Lacedaemonians and their allies may\nvoyage upon it in any vessel rowed by oars and of not more than five\nhundred talents tonnage, not a vessel of war.\n\n5. That all heralds and embassies, with as many attendants as they\nplease, for concluding the war and adjusting claims, shall have free\npassage, going and coming, to Peloponnese or Athens by land and by sea.\n\n6. That during the truce, deserters whether bond or free shall be\nreceived neither by you, nor by us.\n\n7. Further, that satisfaction shall be given by you to us and by us to\nyou according to the public law of our several countries, all disputes\nbeing settled by law without recourse to hostilities.\n\nThe Lacedaemonians and allies agree to these articles; but if you have\nanything fairer or juster to suggest, come to Lacedaemon and let us\nknow: whatever shall be just will meet with no objection either from\nthe Lacedaemonians or from the allies. Only let those who come come with\nfull powers, as you desire us. The truce shall be for one year.\n\nApproved by the people.\n\nThe tribe of Acamantis had the prytany, Phoenippus was secretary,\nNiciades chairman. Laches moved, in the name of the good luck of the\nAthenians, that they should conclude the armistice upon the terms agreed\nupon by the Lacedaemonians and the allies. It was agreed accordingly\nin the popular assembly that the armistice should be for one year,\nbeginning that very day, the fourteenth of the month of Elaphebolion;\nduring which time ambassadors and heralds should go and come between the\ntwo countries to discuss the bases of a pacification. That the generals\nand prytanes should call an assembly of the people, in which the\nAthenians should first consult on the peace, and on the mode in which\nthe embassy for putting an end to the war should be admitted. That the\nembassy now present should at once take the engagement before the people\nto keep well and truly this truce for one year.\n\nOn these terms the Lacedaemonians concluded with the Athenians and their\nallies on the twelfth day of the Spartan month Gerastius; the allies\nalso taking the oaths. Those who concluded and poured the libation\nwere Taurus, son of Echetimides, Athenaeus, son of Pericleidas, and\nPhilocharidas, son of Eryxidaidas, Lacedaemonians; Aeneas, son of\nOcytus, and Euphamidas, son of Aristonymus, Corinthians; Damotimus, son\nof Naucrates, and Onasimus, son of Megacles, Sicyonians; Nicasus, son of\nCecalus, and Menecrates, son of Amphidorus, Megarians; and Amphias, son\nof Eupaidas, an Epidaurian; and the Athenian generals Nicostratus, son\nof Diitrephes, Nicias, son of Niceratus, and Autocles, son of Tolmaeus.\nSuch was the armistice, and during the whole of it conferences went on\non the subject of a pacification.\n\nIn the days in which they were going backwards and forwards to these\nconferences, Scione, a town in Pallene, revolted from Athens, and went\nover to Brasidas. The Scionaeans say that they are Pallenians from\nPeloponnese, and that their first founders on their voyage from Troy\nwere carried in to this spot by the storm which the Achaeans were\ncaught in, and there settled. The Scionaeans had no sooner revolted than\nBrasidas crossed over by night to Scione, with a friendly galley ahead\nand himself in a small boat some way behind; his idea being that if he\nfell in with a vessel larger than the boat he would have the galley to\ndefend him, while a ship that was a match for the galley would probably\nneglect the small vessel to attack the large one, and thus leave\nhim time to escape. His passage effected, he called a meeting of the\nScionaeans and spoke to the same effect as at Acanthus and Torone,\nadding that they merited the utmost commendation, in that, in spite of\nPallene within the isthmus being cut off by the Athenian occupation\nof Potidaea and of their own practically insular position, they had\nof their own free will gone forward to meet their liberty instead of\ntimorously waiting until they had been by force compelled to their own\nmanifest good. This was a sign that they would valiantly undergo any\ntrial, however great; and if he should order affairs as he intended,\nhe should count them among the truest and sincerest friends of the\nLacedaemonians, and would in every other way honour them.\n\nThe Scionaeans were elated by his language, and even those who had\nat first disapproved of what was being done catching the general\nconfidence, they determined on a vigorous conduct of the war, and\nwelcomed Brasidas with all possible honours, publicly crowning him\nwith a crown of gold as the liberator of Hellas; while private persons\ncrowded round him and decked him with garlands as though he had been an\nathlete. Meanwhile Brasidas left them a small garrison for the present\nand crossed back again, and not long afterwards sent over a larger\nforce, intending with the help of the Scionaeans to attempt Mende and\nPotidaea before the Athenians should arrive; Scione, he felt, being too\nlike an island for them not to relieve it. He had besides intelligence\nin the above towns about their betrayal.\n\nIn the midst of his designs upon the towns in question, a galley\narrived with the commissioners carrying round the news of the armistice,\nAristonymus for the Athenians and Athenaeus for the Lacedaemonians. The\ntroops now crossed back to Torone, and the commissioners gave Brasidas\nnotice of the convention. All the Lacedaemonian allies in Thrace\naccepted what had been done; and Aristonymus made no difficulty about\nthe rest, but finding, on counting the days, that the Scionaeans had\nrevolted after the date of the convention, refused to include them in\nit. To this Brasidas earnestly objected, asserting that the revolt took\nplace before, and would not give up the town. Upon Aristonymus reporting\nthe case to Athens, the people at once prepared to send an expedition\nto Scione. Upon this, envoys arrived from Lacedaemon, alleging that this\nwould be a breach of the truce, and laying claim to the town upon the\nfaith of the assertion of Brasidas, and meanwhile offering to submit the\nquestion to arbitration. Arbitration, however, was what the Athenians\ndid not choose to risk; being determined to send troops at once to\nthe place, and furious at the idea of even the islanders now daring to\nrevolt, in a vain reliance upon the power of the Lacedaemonians by land.\nBesides the facts of the revolt were rather as the Athenians contended,\nthe Scionaeans having revolted two days after the convention. Cleon\naccordingly succeeded in carrying a decree to reduce and put to death\nthe Scionaeans; and the Athenians employed the leisure which they now\nenjoyed in preparing for the expedition.\n\nMeanwhile Mende revolted, a town in Pallene and a colony of the\nEretrians, and was received without scruple by Brasidas, in spite of its\nhaving evidently come over during the armistice, on account of certain\ninfringements of the truce alleged by him against the Athenians. This\naudacity of Mende was partly caused by seeing Brasidas forward in the\nmatter and by the conclusions drawn from his refusal to betray Scione;\nand besides, the conspirators in Mende were few, and, as I have already\nintimated, had carried on their practices too long not to fear detection\nfor themselves, and not to wish to force the inclination of the\nmultitude. This news made the Athenians more furious than ever, and they\nat once prepared against both towns. Brasidas, expecting their arrival,\nconveyed away to Olynthus in Chalcidice the women and children of\nthe Scionaeans and Mendaeans, and sent over to them five hundred\nPeloponnesian heavy infantry and three hundred Chalcidian targeteers,\nall under the command of Polydamidas.\n\nLeaving these two towns to prepare together against the speedy arrival\nof the Athenians, Brasidas and Perdiccas started on a second joint\nexpedition into Lyncus against Arrhabaeus; the latter with the forces\nof his Macedonian subjects, and a corps of heavy infantry composed of\nHellenes domiciled in the country; the former with the Peloponnesians\nwhom he still had with him and the Chalcidians, Acanthians, and the rest\nin such force as they were able. In all there were about three thousand\nHellenic heavy infantry, accompanied by all the Macedonian cavalry with\nthe Chalcidians, near one thousand strong, besides an immense crowd\nof barbarians. On entering the country of Arrhabaeus, they found the\nLyncestians encamped awaiting them, and themselves took up a position\nopposite. The infantry on either side were upon a hill, with a plain\nbetween them, into which the horse of both armies first galloped down\nand engaged a cavalry action. After this the Lyncestian heavy infantry\nadvanced from their hill to join their cavalry and offered battle; upon\nwhich Brasidas and Perdiccas also came down to meet them, and engaged\nand routed them with heavy loss; the survivors taking refuge upon the\nheights and there remaining inactive. The victors now set up a trophy\nand waited two or three days for the Illyrian mercenaries who were to\njoin Perdiccas. Perdiccas then wished to go on and attack the villages\nof Arrhabaeus, and to sit still no longer; but Brasidas, afraid that the\nAthenians might sail up during his absence, and of something happening\nto Mende, and seeing besides that the Illyrians did not appear, far from\nseconding this wish was anxious to return.\n\nWhile they were thus disputing, the news arrived that the Illyrians\nhad actually betrayed Perdiccas and had joined Arrhabaeus; and the fear\ninspired by their warlike character made both parties now think it best\nto retreat. However, owing to the dispute, nothing had been settled as\nto when they should start; and night coming on, the Macedonians and\nthe barbarian crowd took fright in a moment in one of those mysterious\npanics to which great armies are liable; and persuaded that an army many\ntimes more numerous than that which had really arrived was advancing and\nall but upon them, suddenly broke and fled in the direction of home,\nand thus compelled Perdiccas, who at first did not perceive what had\noccurred, to depart without seeing Brasidas, the two armies being\nencamped at a considerable distance from each other. At daybreak\nBrasidas, perceiving that the Macedonians had gone on, and that the\nIllyrians and Arrhabaeus were on the point of attacking him, formed his\nheavy infantry into a square, with the light troops in the centre, and\nhimself also prepared to retreat. Posting his youngest soldiers to dash\nout wherever the enemy should attack them, he himself with three hundred\npicked men in the rear intended to face about during the retreat and\nbeat off the most forward of their assailants, Meanwhile, before the\nenemy approached, he sought to sustain the courage of his soldiers with\nthe following hasty exhortation:\n\n\"Peloponnesians, if I did not suspect you of being dismayed at being\nleft alone to sustain the attack of a numerous and barbarian enemy,\nI should just have said a few words to you as usual without further\nexplanation. As it is, in the face of the desertion of our friends and\nthe numbers of the enemy, I have some advice and information to offer,\nwhich, brief as they must be, will, I hope, suffice for the more\nimportant points. The bravery that you habitually display in war does\nnot depend on your having allies at your side in this or that encounter,\nbut on your native courage; nor have numbers any terrors for citizens of\nstates like yours, in which the many do not rule the few, but rather the\nfew the many, owing their position to nothing else than to superiority\nin the field. Inexperience now makes you afraid of barbarians; and yet\nthe trial of strength which you had with the Macedonians among them, and\nmy own judgment, confirmed by what I hear from others, should be enough\nto satisfy you that they will not prove formidable. Where an enemy\nseems strong but is really weak, a true knowledge of the facts makes his\nadversary the bolder, just as a serious antagonist is encountered most\nconfidently by those who do not know him. Thus the present enemy might\nterrify an inexperienced imagination; they are formidable in outward\nbulk, their loud yelling is unbearable, and the brandishing of their\nweapons in the air has a threatening appearance. But when it comes to\nreal fighting with an opponent who stands his ground, they are not what\nthey seemed; they have no regular order that they should be ashamed of\ndeserting their positions when hard pressed; flight and attack are\nwith them equally honourable, and afford no test of courage; their\nindependent mode of fighting never leaving any one who wants to run away\nwithout a fair excuse for so doing. In short, they think frightening\nyou at a secure distance a surer game than meeting you hand to hand;\notherwise they would have done the one and not the other. You can thus\nplainly see that the terrors with which they were at first invested are\nin fact trifling enough, though to the eye and ear very prominent. Stand\nyour ground therefore when they advance, and again wait your opportunity\nto retire in good order, and you will reach a place of safety all the\nsooner, and will know for ever afterwards that rabble such as these, to\nthose who sustain their first attack, do but show off their courage by\nthreats of the terrible things that they are going to do, at a distance,\nbut with those who give way to them are quick enough to display their\nheroism in pursuit when they can do so without danger.\"\n\nWith this brief address Brasidas began to lead off his army. Seeing\nthis, the barbarians came on with much shouting and hubbub, thinking\nthat he was flying and that they would overtake him and cut him off. But\nwherever they charged they found the young men ready to dash out against\nthem, while Brasidas with his picked company sustained their onset. Thus\nthe Peloponnesians withstood the first attack, to the surprise of the\nenemy, and afterwards received and repulsed them as fast as they came\non, retiring as soon as their opponents became quiet. The main body of\nthe barbarians ceased therefore to molest the Hellenes with Brasidas in\nthe open country, and leaving behind a certain number to harass their\nmarch, the rest went on after the flying Macedonians, slaying those\nwith whom they came up, and so arrived in time to occupy the narrow pass\nbetween two hills that leads into the country of Arrhabaeus. They knew\nthat this was the only way by which Brasidas could retreat, and now\nproceeded to surround him just as he entered the most impracticable part\nof the road, in order to cut him off.\n\nBrasidas, perceiving their intention, told his three hundred to run on\nwithout order, each as quickly as he could, to the hill which seemed\neasiest to take, and to try to dislodge the barbarians already there,\nbefore they should be joined by the main body closing round him. These\nattacked and overpowered the party upon the hill, and the main army\nof the Hellenes now advanced with less difficulty towards it--the\nbarbarians being terrified at seeing their men on that side driven from\nthe height and no longer following the main body, who, they considered,\nhad gained the frontier and made good their escape. The heights once\ngained, Brasidas now proceeded more securely, and the same day arrived\nat Arnisa, the first town in the dominions of Perdiccas. The soldiers,\nenraged at the desertion of the Macedonians, vented their rage on all\ntheir yokes of oxen which they found on the road, and on any baggage\nwhich had tumbled off (as might easily happen in the panic of a night\nretreat), by unyoking and cutting down the cattle and taking the baggage\nfor themselves. From this moment Perdiccas began to regard Brasidas as\nan enemy and to feel against the Peloponnesians a hatred which could\nnot be congenial to the adversary of the Athenians. However, he departed\nfrom his natural interests and made it his endeavour to come to terms\nwith the latter and to get rid of the former.\n\nOn his return from Macedonia to Torone, Brasidas found the Athenians\nalready masters of Mende, and remained quiet where he was, thinking\nit now out of his power to cross over into Pallene and assist the\nMendaeans, but he kept good watch over Torone. For about the same time\nas the campaign in Lyncus, the Athenians sailed upon the expedition\nwhich we left them preparing against Mende and Scione, with fifty ships,\nten of which were Chians, one thousand Athenian heavy infantry and six\nhundred archers, one hundred Thracian mercenaries and some targeteers\ndrawn from their allies in the neighbourhood, under the command of\nNicias, son of Niceratus, and Nicostratus, son of Diitrephes. Weighing\nfrom Potidaea, the fleet came to land opposite the temple of Poseidon,\nand proceeded against Mende; the men of which town, reinforced by three\nhundred Scionaeans, with their Peloponnesian auxiliaries, seven hundred\nheavy infantry in all, under Polydamidas, they found encamped upon a\nstrong hill outside the city. These Nicias, with one hundred and twenty\nlight-armed Methonaeans, sixty picked men from the Athenian heavy\ninfantry, and all the archers, tried to reach by a path running up\nthe hill, but received a wound and found himself unable to force the\nposition; while Nicostratus, with all the rest of the army, advancing\nupon the hill, which was naturally difficult, by a different approach\nfurther off, was thrown into utter disorder; and the whole Athenian\narmy narrowly escaped being defeated. For that day, as the Mendaeans and\ntheir allies showed no signs of yielding, the Athenians retreated and\nencamped, and the Mendaeans at nightfall returned into the town.\n\nThe next day the Athenians sailed round to the Scione side, and took the\nsuburb, and all day plundered the country, without any one coming out\nagainst them, partly because of intestine disturbances in the town; and\nthe following night the three hundred Scionaeans returned home. On the\nmorrow Nicias advanced with half the army to the frontier of Scione and\nlaid waste the country; while Nicostratus with the remainder sat down\nbefore the town near the upper gate on the road to Potidaea. The arms\nof the Mendaeans and of their Peloponnesian auxiliaries within the wall\nhappened to be piled in that quarter, where Polydamidas accordingly\nbegan to draw them up for battle, encouraging the Mendaeans to make a\nsortie. At this moment one of the popular party answered him factiously\nthat they would not go out and did not want a war, and for thus\nanswering was dragged by the arm and knocked about by Polydamidas.\nHereupon the infuriated commons at once seized their arms and rushed\nat the Peloponnesians and at their allies of the opposite faction. The\ntroops thus assaulted were at once routed, partly from the suddenness\nof the conflict and partly through fear of the gates being opened to the\nAthenians, with whom they imagined that the attack had been concerted.\nAs many as were not killed on the spot took refuge in the citadel,\nwhich they had held from the first; and the whole, Athenian army, Nicias\nhaving by this time returned and being close to the city, now burst into\nMende, which had opened its gates without any convention, and sacked it\njust as if they had taken it by storm, the generals even finding some\ndifficulty in restraining them from also massacring the inhabitants.\nAfter this the Athenians told the Mendaeans that they might retain their\ncivil rights, and themselves judge the supposed authors of the revolt;\nand cut off the party in the citadel by a wall built down to the sea\non either side, appointing troops to maintain the blockade. Having thus\nsecured Mende, they proceeded against Scione.\n\nThe Scionaeans and Peloponnesians marched out against them, occupying a\nstrong hill in front of the town, which had to be captured by the enemy\nbefore they could invest the place. The Athenians stormed the hill,\ndefeated and dislodged its occupants, and, having encamped and set up\na trophy, prepared for the work of circumvallation. Not long after they\nhad begun their operations, the auxiliaries besieged in the citadel of\nMende forced the guard by the sea-side and arrived by night at Scione,\ninto which most of them succeeded in entering, passing through the\nbesieging army.\n\nWhile the investment of Scione was in progress, Perdiccas sent a herald\nto the Athenian generals and made peace with the Athenians, through\nspite against Brasidas for the retreat from Lyncus, from which moment\nindeed he had begun to negotiate. The Lacedaemonian Ischagoras was just\nthen upon the point of starting with an army overland to join Brasidas;\nand Perdiccas, being now required by Nicias to give some proof of the\nsincerity of his reconciliation to the Athenians, and being himself\nno longer disposed to let the Peloponnesians into his country, put in\nmotion his friends in Thessaly, with whose chief men he always took\ncare to have relations, and so effectually stopped the army and its\npreparation that they did not even try the Thessalians. Ischagoras\nhimself, however, with Ameinias and Aristeus, succeeded in reaching\nBrasidas; they had been commissioned by the Lacedaemonians to inspect\nthe state of affairs, and brought out from Sparta (in violation of all\nprecedent) some of their young men to put in command of the towns,\nto guard against their being entrusted to the persons upon the spot.\nBrasidas accordingly placed Clearidas, son of Cleonymus, in Amphipolis,\nand Pasitelidas, son of Hegesander, in Torone.\n\nThe same summer the Thebans dismantled the wall of the Thespians on the\ncharge of Atticism, having always wished to do so, and now finding it\nan easy matter, as the flower of the Thespian youth had perished in the\nbattle with the Athenians. The same summer also the temple of Hera at\nArgos was burnt down, through Chrysis, the priestess, placing a lighted\ntorch near the garlands and then falling asleep, so that they all caught\nfire and were in a blaze before she observed it. Chrysis that very night\nfled to Phlius for fear of the Argives, who, agreeably to the law in\nsuch a case, appointed another priestess named Phaeinis. Chrysis at the\ntime of her flight had been priestess for eight years of the present war\nand half the ninth. At the close of the summer the investment of Scione\nwas completed, and the Athenians, leaving a detachment to maintain the\nblockade, returned with the rest of their army.\n\nDuring the winter following, the Athenians and Lacedaemonians were\nkept quiet by the armistice; but the Mantineans and Tegeans, and their\nrespective allies, fought a battle at Laodicium, in the Oresthid. The\nvictory remained doubtful, as each side routed one of the wings opposed\nto them, and both set up trophies and sent spoils to Delphi. After heavy\nloss on both sides the battle was undecided, and night interrupted\nthe action; yet the Tegeans passed the night on the field and set up\na trophy at once, while the Mantineans withdrew to Bucolion and set up\ntheirs afterwards.\n\nAt the close of the same winter, in fact almost in spring, Brasidas made\nan attempt upon Potidaea. He arrived by night, and succeeded in planting\na ladder against the wall without being discovered, the ladder being\nplanted just in the interval between the passing round of the bell and\nthe return of the man who brought it back. Upon the garrison, however,\ntaking the alarm immediately afterwards, before his men came up, he\nquickly led off his troops, without waiting until it was day. So ended\nthe winter and the ninth year of this war of which Thucydides is the\nhistorian.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n_Tenth Year of the War--Death of Cleon and Brasidas--Peace of Nicias_\n\nThe next summer the truce for a year ended, after lasting until the\nPythian games. During the armistice the Athenians expelled the Delians\nfrom Delos, concluding that they must have been polluted by some old\noffence at the time of their consecration, and that this had been the\nomission in the previous purification of the island, which, as I have\nrelated, had been thought to have been duly accomplished by the removal\nof the graves of the dead. The Delians had Atramyttium in Asia given\nthem by Pharnaces, and settled there as they removed from Delos.\n\nMeanwhile Cleon prevailed on the Athenians to let him set sail at the\nexpiration of the armistice for the towns in the direction of Thrace\nwith twelve hundred heavy infantry and three hundred horse from Athens,\na large force of the allies, and thirty ships. First touching at the\nstill besieged Scione, and taking some heavy infantry from the army\nthere, he next sailed into Cophos, a harbour in the territory of\nTorone, which is not far from the town. From thence, having learnt from\ndeserters that Brasidas was not in Torone, and that its garrison was not\nstrong enough to give him battle, he advanced with his army against the\ntown, sending ten ships to sail round into the harbour. He first came to\nthe fortification lately thrown up in front of the town by Brasidas in\norder to take in the suburb, to do which he had pulled down part of the\noriginal wall and made it all one city. To this point Pasitelidas, the\nLacedaemonian commander, with such garrison as there was in the place,\nhurried to repel the Athenian assault; but finding himself hard pressed,\nand seeing the ships that had been sent round sailing into the harbour,\nPasitelidas began to be afraid that they might get up to the city before\nits defenders were there and, the fortification being also carried, he\nmight be taken prisoner, and so abandoned the outwork and ran into the\ntown. But the Athenians from the ships had already taken Torone, and\ntheir land forces following at his heels burst in with him with a rush\nover the part of the old wall that had been pulled down, killing some of\nthe Peloponnesians and Toronaeans in the melee, and making prisoners\nof the rest, and Pasitelidas their commander amongst them. Brasidas\nmeanwhile had advanced to relieve Torone, and had only about four miles\nmore to go when he heard of its fall on the road, and turned back again.\nCleon and the Athenians set up two trophies, one by the harbour, the\nother by the fortification and, making slaves of the wives and children\nof the Toronaeans, sent the men with the Peloponnesians and any\nChalcidians that were there, to the number of seven hundred, to Athens;\nwhence, however, they all came home afterwards, the Peloponnesians on\nthe conclusion of peace, and the rest by being exchanged against other\nprisoners with the Olynthians. About the same time Panactum, a fortress\non the Athenian border, was taken by treachery by the Boeotians.\nMeanwhile Cleon, after placing a garrison in Torone, weighed anchor and\nsailed around Athos on his way to Amphipolis.\n\nAbout the same time Phaeax, son of Erasistratus, set sail with two\ncolleagues as ambassador from Athens to Italy and Sicily. The Leontines,\nupon the departure of the Athenians from Sicily after the pacification,\nhad placed a number of new citizens upon the roll, and the commons had\na design for redividing the land; but the upper classes, aware of their\nintention, called in the Syracusans and expelled the commons. These last\nwere scattered in various directions; but the upper classes came to an\nagreement with the Syracusans, abandoned and laid waste their city, and\nwent and lived at Syracuse, where they were made citizens. Afterwards\nsome of them were dissatisfied, and leaving Syracuse occupied Phocaeae,\na quarter of the town of Leontini, and Bricinniae, a strong place in the\nLeontine country, and being there joined by most of the exiled commons\ncarried on war from the fortifications. The Athenians hearing this, sent\nPhaeax to see if they could not by some means so convince their allies\nthere and the rest of the Sicilians of the ambitious designs of Syracuse\nas to induce them to form a general coalition against her, and thus save\nthe commons of Leontini. Arrived in Sicily, Phaeax succeeded at Camarina\nand Agrigentum, but meeting with a repulse at Gela did not go on to\nthe rest, as he saw that he should not succeed with them, but returned\nthrough the country of the Sicels to Catana, and after visiting\nBricinniae as he passed, and encouraging its inhabitants, sailed back to\nAthens.\n\nDuring his voyage along the coast to and from Sicily, he treated with\nsome cities in Italy on the subject of friendship with Athens, and also\nfell in with some Locrian settlers exiled from Messina, who had been\nsent thither when the Locrians were called in by one of the factions\nthat divided Messina after the pacification of Sicily, and Messina came\nfor a time into the hands of the Locrians. These being met by Phaeax on\ntheir return home received no injury at his hands, as the Locrians had\nagreed with him for a treaty with Athens. They were the only people\nof the allies who, when the reconciliation between the Sicilians took\nplace, had not made peace with her; nor indeed would they have done\nso now, if they had not been pressed by a war with the Hipponians and\nMedmaeans who lived on their border, and were colonists of theirs.\nPhaeax meanwhile proceeded on his voyage, and at length arrived at\nAthens.\n\nCleon, whom we left on his voyage from Torone to Amphipolis, made Eion\nhis base, and after an unsuccessful assault upon the Andrian colony\nof Stagirus, took Galepsus, a colony of Thasos, by storm. He now sent\nenvoys to Perdiccas to command his attendance with an army, as\nprovided by the alliance; and others to Thrace, to Polles, king of the\nOdomantians, who was to bring as many Thracian mercenaries as possible;\nand himself remained inactive in Eion, awaiting their arrival. Informed\nof this, Brasidas on his part took up a position of observation upon\nCerdylium, a place situated in the Argilian country on high ground\nacross the river, not far from Amphipolis, and commanding a view on all\nsides, and thus made it impossible for Cleon's army to move without\nhis seeing it; for he fully expected that Cleon, despising the scanty\nnumbers of his opponent, would march against Amphipolis with the\nforce that he had got with him. At the same time Brasidas made\nhis preparations, calling to his standard fifteen hundred Thracian\nmercenaries and all the Edonians, horse and targeteers; he also had\na thousand Myrcinian and Chalcidian targeteers, besides those in\nAmphipolis, and a force of heavy infantry numbering altogether about two\nthousand, and three hundred Hellenic horse. Fifteen hundred of these he\nhad with him upon Cerdylium; the rest were stationed with Clearidas in\nAmphipolis.\n\nAfter remaining quiet for some time, Cleon was at length obliged to do\nas Brasidas expected. His soldiers, tired of their inactivity, began\nalso seriously to reflect on the weakness and incompetence of their\ncommander, and the skill and valour that would be opposed to him, and on\ntheir own original unwillingness to accompany him. These murmurs coming\nto the ears of Cleon, he resolved not to disgust the army by keeping it\nin the same place, and broke up his camp and advanced. The temper of\nthe general was what it had been at Pylos, his success on that occasion\nhaving given him confidence in his capacity. He never dreamed of any one\ncoming out to fight him, but said that he was rather going up to view\nthe place; and if he waited for his reinforcements, it was not in order\nto make victory secure in case he should be compelled to engage, but\nto be enabled to surround and storm the city. He accordingly came and\nposted his army upon a strong hill in front of Amphipolis, and proceeded\nto examine the lake formed by the Strymon, and how the town lay on the\nside of Thrace. He thought to retire at pleasure without fighting, as\nthere was no one to be seen upon the wall or coming out of the gates,\nall of which were shut. Indeed, it seemed a mistake not to have brought\ndown engines with him; he could then have taken the town, there being no\none to defend it.\n\nAs soon as Brasidas saw the Athenians in motion he descended himself\nfrom Cerdylium and entered Amphipolis. He did not venture to go out in\nregular order against the Athenians: he mistrusted his strength, and\nthought it inadequate to the attempt; not in numbers--these were not so\nunequal--but in quality, the flower of the Athenian army being in the\nfield, with the best of the Lemnians and Imbrians. He therefore prepared\nto assail them by stratagem. By showing the enemy the number of his\ntroops, and the shifts which he had been put to to to arm them, he\nthought that he should have less chance of beating him than by not\nletting him have a sight of them, and thus learn how good a right he\nhad to despise them. He accordingly picked out a hundred and fifty heavy\ninfantry and, putting the rest under Clearidas, determined to attack\nsuddenly before the Athenians retired; thinking that he should not have\nagain such a chance of catching them alone, if their reinforcements were\nonce allowed to come up; and so calling all his soldiers together in\norder to encourage them and explain his intention, spoke as follows:\n\n\"Peloponnesians, the character of the country from which we have come,\none which has always owed its freedom to valour, and the fact that you\nare Dorians and the enemy you are about to fight Ionians, whom you are\naccustomed to beat, are things that do not need further comment. But the\nplan of attack that I propose to pursue, this it is as well to explain,\nin order that the fact of our adventuring with a part instead of with\nthe whole of our forces may not damp your courage by the apparent\ndisadvantage at which it places you. I imagine it is the poor opinion\nthat he has of us, and the fact that he has no idea of any one coming\nout to engage him, that has made the enemy march up to the place and\ncarelessly look about him as he is doing, without noticing us. But the\nmost successful soldier will always be the man who most happily detects\na blunder like this, and who carefully consulting his own means makes\nhis attack not so much by open and regular approaches, as by seizing the\nopportunity of the moment; and these stratagems, which do the greatest\nservice to our friends by most completely deceiving our enemies,\nhave the most brilliant name in war. Therefore, while their careless\nconfidence continues, and they are still thinking, as in my judgment\nthey are now doing, more of retreat than of maintaining their position,\nwhile their spirit is slack and not high-strung with expectation, I with\nthe men under my command will, if possible, take them by surprise and\nfall with a run upon their centre; and do you, Clearidas, afterwards,\nwhen you see me already upon them, and, as is likely, dealing terror\namong them, take with you the Amphipolitans, and the rest of the allies,\nand suddenly open the gates and dash at them, and hasten to engage as\nquickly as you can. That is our best chance of establishing a panic\namong them, as a fresh assailant has always more terrors for an enemy\nthan the one he is immediately engaged with. Show yourself a brave\nman, as a Spartan should; and do you, allies, follow him like men, and\nremember that zeal, honour, and obedience mark the good soldier, and\nthat this day will make you either free men and allies of Lacedaemon, or\nslaves of Athens; even if you escape without personal loss of liberty\nor life, your bondage will be on harsher terms than before, and you will\nalso hinder the liberation of the rest of the Hellenes. No cowardice\nthen on your part, seeing the greatness of the issues at stake, and I\nwill show that what I preach to others I can practise myself.\"\n\nAfter this brief speech Brasidas himself prepared for the sally, and\nplaced the rest with Clearidas at the Thracian gates to support him as\nhad been agreed. Meanwhile he had been seen coming down from Cerdylium\nand then in the city, which is overlooked from the outside, sacrificing\nnear the temple of Athene; in short, all his movements had been\nobserved, and word was brought to Cleon, who had at the moment gone on\nto look about him, that the whole of the enemy's force could be seen\nin the town, and that the feet of horses and men in great numbers were\nvisible under the gates, as if a sally were intended. Upon hearing this\nhe went up to look, and having done so, being unwilling to venture upon\nthe decisive step of a battle before his reinforcements came up, and\nfancying that he would have time to retire, bid the retreat be sounded\nand sent orders to the men to effect it by moving on the left wing in\nthe direction of Eion, which was indeed the only way practicable. This\nhowever not being quick enough for him, he joined the retreat in person\nand made the right wing wheel round, thus turning its unarmed side\nto the enemy. It was then that Brasidas, seeing the Athenian force in\nmotion and his opportunity come, said to the men with him and the rest:\n\"Those fellows will never stand before us, one can see that by the way\ntheir spears and heads are going. Troops which do as they do seldom\nstand a charge. Quick, someone, and open the gates I spoke of, and let\nus be out and at them with no fears for the result.\" Accordingly\nissuing out by the palisade gate and by the first in the long wall then\nexisting, he ran at the top of his speed along the straight road, where\nthe trophy now stands as you go by the steepest part of the hill, and\nfell upon and routed the centre of the Athenians, panic-stricken by\ntheir own disorder and astounded at his audacity. At the same moment\nClearidas in execution of his orders issued out from the Thracian gates\nto support him, and also attacked the enemy. The result was that the\nAthenians, suddenly and unexpectedly attacked on both sides, fell into\nconfusion; and their left towards Eion, which had already got on some\ndistance, at once broke and fled. Just as it was in full retreat and\nBrasidas was passing on to attack the right, he received a wound; but\nhis fall was not perceived by the Athenians, as he was taken up by those\nnear him and carried off the field. The Athenian right made a better\nstand, and though Cleon, who from the first had no thought of fighting,\nat once fled and was overtaken and slain by a Myrcinian targeteer, his\ninfantry forming in close order upon the hill twice or thrice repulsed\nthe attacks of Clearidas, and did not finally give way until they were\nsurrounded and routed by the missiles of the Myrcinian and Chalcidian\nhorse and the targeteers. Thus the Athenian army was all now in flight;\nand such as escaped being killed in the battle, or by the Chalcidian\nhorse and the targeteers, dispersed among the hills, and with difficulty\nmade their way to Eion. The men who had taken up and rescued Brasidas,\nbrought him into the town with the breath still in him: he lived to hear\nof the victory of his troops, and not long after expired. The rest of\nthe army returning with Clearidas from the pursuit stripped the dead and\nset up a trophy.\n\nAfter this all the allies attended in arms and buried Brasidas at the\npublic expense in the city, in front of what is now the marketplace, and\nthe Amphipolitans, having enclosed his tomb, ever afterwards sacrifice\nto him as a hero and have given to him the honour of games and annual\nofferings. They constituted him the founder of their colony, and pulled\ndown the Hagnonic erections, and obliterated everything that could be\ninterpreted as a memorial of his having founded the place; for they\nconsidered that Brasidas had been their preserver, and courting as they\ndid the alliance of Lacedaemon for fear of Athens, in their present\nhostile relations with the latter they could no longer with the same\nadvantage or satisfaction pay Hagnon his honours. They also gave the\nAthenians back their dead. About six hundred of the latter had fallen\nand only seven of the enemy, owing to there having been no regular\nengagement, but the affair of accident and panic that I have described.\nAfter taking up their dead the Athenians sailed off home, while\nClearidas and his troops remained to arrange matters at Amphipolis.\n\nAbout the same time three Lacedaemonians--Ramphias, Autocharidas, and\nEpicydidas--led a reinforcement of nine hundred heavy infantry to the\ntowns in the direction of Thrace, and arriving at Heraclea in Trachis\nreformed matters there as seemed good to them. While they delayed there,\nthis battle took place and so the summer ended.\n\nWith the beginning of the winter following, Ramphias and his companions\npenetrated as far as Pierium in Thessaly; but as the Thessalians opposed\ntheir further advance, and Brasidas whom they came to reinforce was\ndead, they turned back home, thinking that the moment had gone by,\nthe Athenians being defeated and gone, and themselves not equal to the\nexecution of Brasidas's designs. The main cause however of their return\nwas because they knew that when they set out Lacedaemonian opinion was\nreally in favour of peace.\n\nIndeed it so happened that directly after the battle of Amphipolis and\nthe retreat of Ramphias from Thessaly, both sides ceased to prosecute\nthe war and turned their attention to peace. Athens had suffered\nseverely at Delium, and again shortly afterwards at Amphipolis, and\nhad no longer that confidence in her strength which had made her before\nrefuse to treat, in the belief of ultimate victory which her success\nat the moment had inspired; besides, she was afraid of her allies being\ntempted by her reverses to rebel more generally, and repented having\nlet go the splendid opportunity for peace which the affair of Pylos had\noffered. Lacedaemon, on the other hand, found the event of the war to\nfalsify her notion that a few years would suffice for the overthrow of\nthe power of the Athenians by the devastation of their land. She had\nsuffered on the island a disaster hitherto unknown at Sparta; she saw\nher country plundered from Pylos and Cythera; the Helots were deserting,\nand she was in constant apprehension that those who remained in\nPeloponnese would rely upon those outside and take advantage of the\nsituation to renew their old attempts at revolution. Besides this, as\nchance would have it, her thirty years' truce with the Argives was upon\nthe point of expiring; and they refused to renew it unless Cynuria were\nrestored to them; so that it seemed impossible to fight Argos and\nAthens at once. She also suspected some of the cities in Peloponnese of\nintending to go over to the enemy and that was indeed the case.\n\nThese considerations made both sides disposed for an accommodation; the\nLacedaemonians being probably the most eager, as they ardently desired\nto recover the men taken upon the island, the Spartans among whom\nbelonged to the first families and were accordingly related to the\ngoverning body in Lacedaemon. Negotiations had been begun directly after\ntheir capture, but the Athenians in their hour of triumph would not\nconsent to any reasonable terms; though after their defeat at Delium,\nLacedaemon, knowing that they would be now more inclined to listen,\nat once concluded the armistice for a year, during which they were to\nconfer together and see if a longer period could not be agreed upon.\n\nNow, however, after the Athenian defeat at Amphipolis, and the death of\nCleon and Brasidas, who had been the two principal opponents of peace on\neither side--the latter from the success and honour which war gave him,\nthe former because he thought that, if tranquillity were restored,\nhis crimes would be more open to detection and his slanders less\ncredited--the foremost candidates for power in either city, Pleistoanax,\nson of Pausanias, king of Lacedaemon, and Nicias, son of Niceratus, the\nmost fortunate general of his time, each desired peace more ardently\nthan ever. Nicias, while still happy and honoured, wished to secure his\ngood fortune, to obtain a present release from trouble for himself and\nhis countrymen, and hand down to posterity a name as an ever-successful\nstatesman, and thought the way to do this was to keep out of danger and\ncommit himself as little as possible to fortune, and that peace alone\nmade this keeping out of danger possible. Pleistoanax, again, was\nassailed by his enemies for his restoration, and regularly held up by\nthem to the prejudice of his countrymen, upon every reverse that befell\nthem, as though his unjust restoration were the cause; the accusation\nbeing that he and his brother Aristocles had bribed the prophetess of\nDelphi to tell the Lacedaemonian deputations which successively arrived\nat the temple to bring home the seed of the demigod son of Zeus from\nabroad, else they would have to plough with a silver share. In this\nway, it was insisted, in time he had induced the Lacedaemonians in\nthe nineteenth year of his exile to Lycaeum (whither he had gone when\nbanished on suspicion of having been bribed to retreat from Attica, and\nhad built half his house within the consecrated precinct of Zeus for\nfear of the Lacedaemonians), to restore him with the same dances and\nsacrifices with which they had instituted their kings upon the first\nsettlement of Lacedaemon. The smart of this accusation, and the\nreflection that in peace no disaster could occur, and that when\nLacedaemon had recovered her men there would be nothing for his enemies\nto take hold of (whereas, while war lasted, the highest station must\nalways bear the scandal of everything that went wrong), made him\nardently desire a settlement. Accordingly this winter was employed in\nconferences; and as spring rapidly approached, the Lacedaemonians sent\nround orders to the cities to prepare for a fortified occupation of\nAttica, and held this as a sword over the heads of the Athenians to\ninduce them to listen to their overtures; and at last, after many claims\nhad been urged on either side at the conferences a peace was agreed on\nupon the following basis. Each party was to restore its conquests,\nbut Athens was to keep Nisaea; her demand for Plataea being met by\nthe Thebans asserting that they had acquired the place not by force or\ntreachery, but by the voluntary adhesion upon agreement of its citizens;\nand the same, according to the Athenian account, being the history of\nher acquisition of Nisaea. This arranged, the Lacedaemonians\nsummoned their allies, and all voting for peace except the Boeotians,\nCorinthians, Eleans, and Megarians, who did not approve of these\nproceedings, they concluded the treaty and made peace, each of the\ncontracting parties swearing to the following articles:\n\nThe Athenians and Lacedaemonians and their allies made a treaty, and\nswore to it, city by city, as follows;\n\n1. Touching the national temples, there shall be a free passage by land\nand by sea to all who wish it, to sacrifice, travel, consult, and attend\nthe oracle or games, according to the customs of their countries.\n\n2. The temple and shrine of Apollo at Delphi and the Delphians shall\nbe governed by their own laws, taxed by their own state, and judged by\ntheir own judges, the land and the people, according to the custom of\ntheir country.\n\n3. The treaty shall be binding for fifty years upon the Athenians and\nthe allies of the Athenians, and upon the Lacedaemonians and the allies\nof the Lacedaemonians, without fraud or hurt by land or by sea.\n\n4. It shall not be lawful to take up arms, with intent to do hurt,\neither for the Lacedaemonians and their allies against the Athenians\nand their allies, or for the Athenians and their allies against the\nLacedaemonians and their allies, in any way or means whatsoever. But\nshould any difference arise between them they are to have recourse to\nlaw and oaths, according as may be agreed between the parties.\n\n5. The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall give back Amphipolis to\nthe Athenians. Nevertheless, in the case of cities given up by the\nLacedaemonians to the Athenians, the inhabitants shall be allowed to go\nwhere they please and to take their property with them: and the cities\nshall be independent, paying only the tribute of Aristides. And it shall\nnot be lawful for the Athenians or their allies to carry on war against\nthem after the treaty has been concluded, so long as the tribute is\npaid. The cities referred to are Argilus, Stagirus, Acanthus, Scolus,\nOlynthus, and Spartolus. These cities shall be neutral, allies neither\nof the Lacedaemonians nor of the Athenians: but if the cities consent,\nit shall be lawful for the Athenians to make them their allies, provided\nalways that the cities wish it. The Mecybernaeans, Sanaeans, and\nSingaeans shall inhabit their own cities, as also the Olynthians and\nAcanthians: but the Lacedaemonians and their allies shall give back\nPanactum to the Athenians.\n\n6. The Athenians shall give back Coryphasium, Cythera, Methana,\nLacedaemonians that are in the prison at Athens or elsewhere in the\nAthenian dominions, and shall let go the Peloponnesians besieged in\nScione, and all others in Scione that are allies of the Lacedaemonians,\nand all whom Brasidas sent in there, and any others of the allies of the\nLacedaemonians that may be in the prison at Athens or elsewhere in the\nAthenian dominions.\n\n7. The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall in like manner give back\nany of the Athenians or their allies that they may have in their hands.\n\n8. In the case of Scione, Torone, and Sermylium, and any other cities\nthat the Athenians may have, the Athenians may adopt such measures as\nthey please.\n\n9. The Athenians shall take an oath to the Lacedaemonians and their\nallies, city by city. Every man shall swear by the most binding oath of\nhis country, seventeen from each city. The oath shall be as follows; \"I\nwill abide by this agreement and treaty honestly and without deceit.\"\nIn the same way an oath shall be taken by the Lacedaemonians and their\nallies to the Athenians: and the oath shall be renewed annually by both\nparties. Pillars shall be erected at Olympia, Pythia, the Isthmus, at\nAthens in the Acropolis, and at Lacedaemon in the temple at Amyclae.\n\n10. If anything be forgotten, whatever it be, and on whatever point, it\nshall be consistent with their oath for both parties, the Athenians and\nLacedaemonians, to alter it, according to their discretion.\n\nThe treaty begins from the ephoralty of Pleistolas in Lacedaemon, on the\n27th day of the month of Artemisium, and from the archonship, of Alcaeus\nat Athens, on the 25th day of the month of Elaphebolion. Those who\ntook the oath and poured the libations for the Lacedaemonians were\nPleistoanax, Agis, Pleistolas, Damagetis, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus,\nDaithus, Ischagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antippus, Tellis,\nAlcinadas, Empedias, Menas, and Laphilus: for the Athenians, Lampon,\nIsthmonicus, Nicias, Laches, Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon,\nMyrtilus, Thrasycles, Theagenes, Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates,\nLeon, Lamachus, and Demosthenes.\n\nThis treaty was made in the spring, just at the end of winter, directly\nafter the city festival of Dionysus, just ten years, with the difference\nof a few days, from the first invasion of Attica and the commencement of\nthis war. This must be calculated by the seasons rather than by trusting\nto the enumeration of the names of the several magistrates or offices of\nhonour that are used to mark past events. Accuracy is impossible where\nan event may have occurred in the beginning, or middle, or at any period\nin their tenure of office. But by computing by summers and winters, the\nmethod adopted in this history, it will be found that, each of these\namounting to half a year, there were ten summers and as many winters\ncontained in this first war.\n\nMeanwhile the Lacedaemonians, to whose lot it fell to begin the work\nof restitution, immediately set free all the prisoners of war in their\npossession, and sent Ischagoras, Menas, and Philocharidas as envoys to\nthe towns in the direction of Thrace, to order Clearidas to hand over\nAmphipolis to the Athenians, and the rest of their allies each to accept\nthe treaty as it affected them. They, however, did not like its\nterms, and refused to accept it; Clearidas also, willing to oblige the\nChalcidians, would not hand over the town, averring his inability to\ndo so against their will. Meanwhile he hastened in person to Lacedaemon\nwith envoys from the place, to defend his disobedience against the\npossible accusations of Ischagoras and his companions, and also to see\nwhether it was too late for the agreement to be altered; and on\nfinding the Lacedaemonians were bound, quickly set out back again with\ninstructions from them to hand over the place, if possible, or at all\nevents to bring out the Peloponnesians that were in it.\n\nThe allies happened to be present in person at Lacedaemon, and those\nwho had not accepted the treaty were now asked by the Lacedaemonians\nto adopt it. This, however, they refused to do, for the same reasons\nas before, unless a fairer one than the present were agreed upon;\nand remaining firm in their determination were dismissed by the\nLacedaemonians, who now decided on forming an alliance with the\nAthenians, thinking that Argos, who had refused the application of\nAmpelidas and Lichas for a renewal of the treaty, would without Athens\nbe no longer formidable, and that the rest of the Peloponnese would be\nmost likely to keep quiet, if the coveted alliance of Athens were\nshut against them. Accordingly, after conference with the Athenian\nambassadors, an alliance was agreed upon and oaths were exchanged, upon\nthe terms following:\n\n1. The Lacedaemonians shall be allies of the Athenians for fifty years.\n\n2. Should any enemy invade the territory of Lacedaemon and injure\nthe Lacedaemonians, the Athenians shall help in such way as they most\neffectively can, according to their power. But if the invader be gone\nafter plundering the country, that city shall be the enemy of Lacedaemon\nand Athens, and shall be chastised by both, and one shall not make peace\nwithout the other. This to be honestly, loyally, and without fraud.\n\n3. Should any enemy invade the territory of Athens and injure the\nAthenians, the Lacedaemonians shall help them in such way as they most\neffectively can, according to their power. But if the invader be gone\nafter plundering the country, that city shall be the enemy of Lacedaemon\nand Athens, and shall be chastised by both, and one shall not make peace\nwithout the other. This to be honestly, loyally, and without fraud.\n\n4. Should the slave population rise, the Athenians shall help the\nLacedaemonians with all their might, according to their power.\n\n5. This treaty shall be sworn to by the same persons on either side that\nswore to the other. It shall be renewed annually by the Lacedaemonians\ngoing to Athens for the Dionysia, and the Athenians to Lacedaemon\nfor the Hyacinthia, and a pillar shall be set up by either party: at\nLacedaemon near the statue of Apollo at Amyclae, and at Athens on the\nAcropolis near the statue of Athene. Should the Lacedaemonians\nand Athenians see to add to or take away from the alliance in any\nparticular, it shall be consistent with their oaths for both parties to\ndo so, according to their discretion.\n\nThose who took the oath for the Lacedaemonians were Pleistoanax,\nAgis, Pleistolas, Damagetus, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus, Daithus,\nIschagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antippus, Alcinadas, Tellis,\nEmpedias, Menas, and Laphilus; for the Athenians, Lampon, Isthmionicus,\nLaches, Nicias, Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon, Myrtilus,\nThrasycles, Theagenes, Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates, Leon,\nLamachus, and Demosthenes.\n\nThis alliance was made not long after the treaty; and the Athenians gave\nback the men from the island to the Lacedaemonians, and the summer of\nthe eleventh year began. This completes the history of the first war,\nwhich occupied the whole of the ten years previously.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n_Feeling against Sparta in Peloponnese--League of the Mantineans,\nEleans, Argives, and Athenians--Battle of Mantinea and breaking up of\nthe League_\n\nAfter the treaty and the alliance between the Lacedaemonians and\nAthenians, concluded after the ten years' war, in the ephorate of\nPleistolas at Lacedaemon, and the archonship of Alcaeus at Athens, the\nstates which had accepted them were at peace; but the Corinthians and\nsome of the cities in Peloponnese trying to disturb the settlement,\na fresh agitation was instantly commenced by the allies against\nLacedaemon. Further, the Lacedaemonians, as time went on, became\nsuspected by the Athenians through their not performing some of the\nprovisions in the treaty; and though for six years and ten months\nthey abstained from invasion of each other's territory, yet abroad an\nunstable armistice did not prevent either party doing the other the most\neffectual injury, until they were finally obliged to break the treaty\nmade after the ten years' war and to have recourse to open hostilities.\n\nThe history of this period has been also written by the same Thucydides,\nan Athenian, in the chronological order of events by summers and\nwinters, to the time when the Lacedaemonians and their allies put an end\nto the Athenian empire, and took the Long Walls and Piraeus. The war had\nthen lasted for twenty-seven years in all. Only a mistaken judgment can\nobject to including the interval of treaty in the war. Looked at by the\nlight of facts it cannot, it will be found, be rationally considered\na state of peace, where neither party either gave or got back all that\nthey had agreed, apart from the violations of it which occurred on both\nsides in the Mantinean and Epidaurian wars and other instances, and\nthe fact that the allies in the direction of Thrace were in as open\nhostility as ever, while the Boeotians had only a truce renewed every\nten days. So that the first ten years' war, the treacherous armistice\nthat followed it, and the subsequent war will, calculating by the\nseasons, be found to make up the number of years which I have mentioned,\nwith the difference of a few days, and to afford an instance of faith\nin oracles being for once justified by the event. I certainly all along\nremember from the beginning to the end of the war its being commonly\ndeclared that it would last thrice nine years. I lived through the whole\nof it, being of an age to comprehend events, and giving my attention to\nthem in order to know the exact truth about them. It was also my fate\nto be an exile from my country for twenty years after my command at\nAmphipolis; and being present with both parties, and more especially\nwith the Peloponnesians by reason of my exile, I had leisure to observe\naffairs somewhat particularly. I will accordingly now relate the\ndifferences that arose after the ten years' war, the breach of the\ntreaty, and the hostilities that followed.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the fifty years' truce and of the subsequent\nalliance, the embassies from Peloponnese which had been summoned for\nthis business returned from Lacedaemon. The rest went straight home, but\nthe Corinthians first turned aside to Argos and opened negotiations with\nsome of the men in office there, pointing out that Lacedaemon could have\nno good end in view, but only the subjugation of Peloponnese, or she\nwould never have entered into treaty and alliance with the once detested\nAthenians, and that the duty of consulting for the safety of Peloponnese\nhad now fallen upon Argos, who should immediately pass a decree\ninviting any Hellenic state that chose, such state being independent and\naccustomed to meet fellow powers upon the fair and equal ground of law\nand justice, to make a defensive alliance with the Argives; appointing\na few individuals with plenipotentiary powers, instead of making the\npeople the medium of negotiation, in order that, in the case of an\napplicant being rejected, the fact of his overtures might not be\nmade public. They said that many would come over from hatred of the\nLacedaemonians. After this explanation of their views, the Corinthians\nreturned home.\n\nThe persons with whom they had communicated reported the proposal to\ntheir government and people, and the Argives passed the decree and chose\ntwelve men to negotiate an alliance for any Hellenic state that wished\nit, except Athens and Lacedaemon, neither of which should be able to\njoin without reference to the Argive people. Argos came into the\nplan the more readily because she saw that war with Lacedaemon was\ninevitable, the truce being on the point of expiring; and also because\nshe hoped to gain the supremacy of Peloponnese. For at this time\nLacedaemon had sunk very low in public estimation because of her\ndisasters, while the Argives were in a most flourishing condition,\nhaving taken no part in the Attic war, but having on the contrary\nprofited largely by their neutrality. The Argives accordingly prepared\nto receive into alliance any of the Hellenes that desired it.\n\nThe Mantineans and their allies were the first to come over through fear\nof the Lacedaemonians. Having taken advantage of the war against Athens\nto reduce a large part of Arcadia into subjection, they thought that\nLacedaemon would not leave them undisturbed in their conquests, now\nthat she had leisure to interfere, and consequently gladly turned to a\npowerful city like Argos, the historical enemy of the Lacedaemonians,\nand a sister democracy. Upon the defection of Mantinea, the rest of\nPeloponnese at once began to agitate the propriety of following her\nexample, conceiving that the Mantineans not have changed sides without\ngood reason; besides which they were angry with Lacedaemon among other\nreasons for having inserted in the treaty with Athens that it should\nbe consistent with their oaths for both parties, Lacedaemonians and\nAthenians, to add to or take away from it according to their discretion.\nIt was this clause that was the real origin of the panic in Peloponnese,\nby exciting suspicions of a Lacedaemonian and Athenian combination\nagainst their liberties: any alteration should properly have been made\nconditional upon the consent of the whole body of the allies. With these\napprehensions there was a very general desire in each state to place\nitself in alliance with Argos.\n\nIn the meantime the Lacedaemonians perceiving the agitation going on in\nPeloponnese, and that Corinth was the author of it and was herself about\nto enter into alliance with the Argives, sent ambassadors thither in the\nhope of preventing what was in contemplation. They accused her of having\nbrought it all about, and told her that she could not desert Lacedaemon\nand become the ally of Argos, without adding violation of her oaths to\nthe crime which she had already committed in not accepting the treaty\nwith Athens, when it had been expressly agreed that the decision of\nthe majority of the allies should be binding, unless the gods or heroes\nstood in the way. Corinth in her answer, delivered before those of her\nallies who had like her refused to accept the treaty, and whom she had\npreviously invited to attend, refrained from openly stating the injuries\nshe complained of, such as the non-recovery of Sollium or Anactorium\nfrom the Athenians, or any other point in which she thought she had been\nprejudiced, but took shelter under the pretext that she could not give\nup her Thracian allies, to whom her separate individual security had\nbeen given, when they first rebelled with Potidaea, as well as upon\nsubsequent occasions. She denied, therefore, that she committed any\nviolation of her oaths to the allies in not entering into the treaty\nwith Athens; having sworn upon the faith of the gods to her Thracian\nfriends, she could not honestly give them up. Besides, the expression\nwas, \"unless the gods or heroes stand in the way.\" Now here, as it\nappeared to her, the gods stood in the way. This was what she said on\nthe subject of her former oaths. As to the Argive alliance, she would\nconfer with her friends and do whatever was right. The Lacedaemonian\nenvoys returning home, some Argive ambassadors who happened to be in\nCorinth pressed her to conclude the alliance without further delay, but\nwere told to attend at the next congress to be held at Corinth.\n\nImmediately afterwards an Elean embassy arrived, and first making an\nalliance with Corinth went on from thence to Argos, according to their\ninstructions, and became allies of the Argives, their country being just\nthen at enmity with Lacedaemon and Lepreum. Some time back there had\nbeen a war between the Lepreans and some of the Arcadians; and the\nEleans being called in by the former with the offer of half their lands,\nhad put an end to the war, and leaving the land in the hands of its\nLeprean occupiers had imposed upon them the tribute of a talent to the\nOlympian Zeus. Till the Attic war this tribute was paid by the Lepreans,\nwho then took the war as an excuse for no longer doing so, and upon the\nEleans using force appealed to Lacedaemon. The case was thus submitted\nto her arbitrament; but the Eleans, suspecting the fairness of the\ntribunal, renounced the reference and laid waste the Leprean territory.\nThe Lacedaemonians nevertheless decided that the Lepreans were\nindependent and the Eleans aggressors, and as the latter did not abide\nby the arbitration, sent a garrison of heavy infantry into Lepreum. Upon\nthis the Eleans, holding that Lacedaemon had received one of their rebel\nsubjects, put forward the convention providing that each confederate\nshould come out of the Attic war in possession of what he had when he\nwent into it, and considering that justice had not been done them\nwent over to the Argives, and now made the alliance through their\nambassadors, who had been instructed for that purpose. Immediately\nafter them the Corinthians and the Thracian Chalcidians became allies\nof Argos. Meanwhile the Boeotians and Megarians, who acted together,\nremained quiet, being left to do as they pleased by Lacedaemon, and\nthinking that the Argive democracy would not suit so well with their\naristocratic government as the Lacedaemonian constitution.\n\nAbout the same time in this summer Athens succeeded in reducing Scione,\nput the adult males to death, and, making slaves of the women and\nchildren, gave the land for the Plataeans to live in. She also brought\nback the Delians to Delos, moved by her misfortunes in the field and by\nthe commands of the god at Delphi. Meanwhile the Phocians and Locrians\ncommenced hostilities. The Corinthians and Argives, being now in\nalliance, went to Tegea to bring about its defection from Lacedaemon,\nseeing that, if so considerable a state could be persuaded to join,\nall Peloponnese would be with them. But when the Tegeans said that they\nwould do nothing against Lacedaemon, the hitherto zealous Corinthians\nrelaxed their activity, and began to fear that none of the rest would\nnow come over. Still they went to the Boeotians and tried to persuade\nthem to alliance and a common action generally with Argos and\nthemselves, and also begged them to go with them to Athens and obtain\nfor them a ten days' truce similar to that made between the Athenians\nand Boeotians not long after the fifty years' treaty, and, in the event\nof the Athenians refusing, to throw up the armistice, and not make\nany truce in future without Corinth. These were the requests of the\nCorinthians. The Boeotians stopped them on the subject of the Argive\nalliance, but went with them to Athens, where however they failed\nto obtain the ten days' truce; the Athenian answer being that\nthe Corinthians had truce already, as being allies of Lacedaemon.\nNevertheless the Boeotians did not throw up their ten days' truce, in\nspite of the prayers and reproaches of the Corinthians for their breach\nof faith; and these last had to content themselves with a de facto\narmistice with Athens.\n\nThe same summer the Lacedaemonians marched into Arcadia with their whole\nlevy under Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, king of Lacedaemon, against\nthe Parrhasians, who were subjects of Mantinea, and a faction of whom\nhad invited their aid. They also meant to demolish, if possible, the\nfort of Cypsela which the Mantineans had built and garrisoned in the\nParrhasian territory, to annoy the district of Sciritis in Laconia. The\nLacedaemonians accordingly laid waste the Parrhasian country, and the\nMantineans, placing their town in the hands of an Argive garrison,\naddressed themselves to the defence of their confederacy, but being\nunable to save Cypsela or the Parrhasian towns went back to Mantinea.\nMeanwhile the Lacedaemonians made the Parrhasians independent, razed the\nfortress, and returned home.\n\nThe same summer the soldiers from Thrace who had gone out with\nBrasidas came back, having been brought from thence after the treaty by\nClearidas; and the Lacedaemonians decreed that the Helots who had fought\nwith Brasidas should be free and allowed to live where they liked, and\nnot long afterwards settled them with the Neodamodes at Lepreum, which\nis situated on the Laconian and Elean border; Lacedaemon being at this\ntime at enmity with Elis. Those however of the Spartans who had been\ntaken prisoners on the island and had surrendered their arms might, it\nwas feared, suppose that they were to be subjected to some degradation\nin consequence of their misfortune, and so make some attempt at\nrevolution, if left in possession of their franchise. These were\ntherefore at once disfranchised, although some of them were in office at\nthe time, and thus placed under a disability to take office, or buy and\nsell anything. After some time, however, the franchise was restored to\nthem.\n\nThe same summer the Dians took Thyssus, a town on Acte by Athos in\nalliance with Athens. During the whole of this summer intercourse\nbetween the Athenians and Peloponnesians continued, although each party\nbegan to suspect the other directly after the treaty, because of the\nplaces specified in it not being restored. Lacedaemon, to whose lot it\nhad fallen to begin by restoring Amphipolis and the other towns, had\nnot done so. She had equally failed to get the treaty accepted by her\nThracian allies, or by the Boeotians or the Corinthians; although she\nwas continually promising to unite with Athens in compelling their\ncompliance, if it were longer refused. She also kept fixing a time at\nwhich those who still refused to come in were to be declared enemies\nto both parties, but took care not to bind herself by any written\nagreement. Meanwhile the Athenians, seeing none of these professions\nperformed in fact, began to suspect the honesty of her intentions, and\nconsequently not only refused to comply with her demands for Pylos, but\nalso repented having given up the prisoners from the island, and kept\ntight hold of the other places, until Lacedaemon's part of the treaty\nshould be fulfilled. Lacedaemon, on the other hand, said she had done\nwhat she could, having given up the Athenian prisoners of war in her\npossession, evacuated Thrace, and performed everything else in her\npower. Amphipolis it was out of her ability to restore; but she would\nendeavour to bring the Boeotians and Corinthians into the treaty, to\nrecover Panactum, and send home all the Athenian prisoners of war in\nBoeotia. Meanwhile she required that Pylos should be restored, or at all\nevents that the Messenians and Helots should be withdrawn, as her troops\nhad been from Thrace, and the place garrisoned, if necessary, by the\nAthenians themselves. After a number of different conferences held\nduring the summer, she succeeded in persuading Athens to withdraw from\nPylos the Messenians and the rest of the Helots and deserters from\nLaconia, who were accordingly settled by her at Cranii in Cephallenia.\nThus during this summer there was peace and intercourse between the two\npeoples.\n\nNext winter, however, the ephors under whom the treaty had been made\nwere no longer in office, and some of their successors were directly\nopposed to it. Embassies now arrived from the Lacedaemonian confederacy,\nand the Athenians, Boeotians, and Corinthians also presented themselves\nat Lacedaemon, and after much discussion and no agreement between them,\nseparated for their several homes; when Cleobulus and Xenares, the two\nephors who were the most anxious to break off the treaty, took advantage\nof this opportunity to communicate privately with the Boeotians and\nCorinthians, and, advising them to act as much as possible together,\ninstructed the former first to enter into alliance with Argos, and then\ntry and bring themselves and the Argives into alliance with Lacedaemon.\nThe Boeotians would so be least likely to be compelled to come into the\nAttic treaty; and the Lacedaemonians would prefer gaining the friendship\nand alliance of Argos even at the price of the hostility of Athens\nand the rupture of the treaty. The Boeotians knew that an honourable\nfriendship with Argos had been long the desire of Lacedaemon; for the\nLacedaemonians believed that this would considerably facilitate the\nconduct of the war outside Peloponnese. Meanwhile they begged the\nBoeotians to place Panactum in her hands in order that she might, if\npossible, obtain Pylos in exchange for it, and so be more in a position\nto resume hostilities with Athens.\n\nAfter receiving these instructions for their governments from Xenares\nand Cleobulus and their friends at Lacedaemon, the Boeotians and\nCorinthians departed. On their way home they were joined by two persons\nhigh in office at Argos, who had waited for them on the road, and who\nnow sounded them upon the possibility of the Boeotians joining the\nCorinthians, Eleans, and Mantineans in becoming the allies of Argos, in\nthe idea that if this could be effected they would be able, thus united,\nto make peace or war as they pleased either against Lacedaemon or any\nother power. The Boeotian envoys were were pleased at thus hearing\nthemselves accidentally asked to do what their friends at Lacedaemon\nhad told them; and the two Argives perceiving that their proposal was\nagreeable, departed with a promise to send ambassadors to the Boeotians.\nOn their arrival the Boeotians reported to the Boeotarchs what had been\nsaid to them at Lacedaemon and also by the Argives who had met them,\nand the Boeotarchs, pleased with the idea, embraced it with the more\neagerness from the lucky coincidence of Argos soliciting the very thing\nwanted by their friends at Lacedaemon. Shortly afterwards ambassadors\nappeared from Argos with the proposals indicated; and the Boeotarchs\napproved of the terms and dismissed the ambassadors with a promise to\nsend envoys to Argos to negotiate the alliance.\n\nIn the meantime it was decided by the Boeotarchs, the Corinthians,\nthe Megarians, and the envoys from Thrace first to interchange oaths\ntogether to give help to each other whenever it was required and not\nto make war or peace except in common; after which the Boeotians and\nMegarians, who acted together, should make the alliance with Argos. But\nbefore the oaths were taken the Boeotarchs communicated these proposals\nto the four councils of the Boeotians, in whom the supreme power\nresides, and advised them to interchange oaths with all such cities as\nshould be willing to enter into a defensive league with the Boeotians.\nBut the members of the Boeotian councils refused their assent to the\nproposal, being afraid of offending Lacedaemon by entering into a league\nwith the deserter Corinth; the Boeotarchs not having acquainted\nthem with what had passed at Lacedaemon and with the advice given by\nCleobulus and Xenares and the Boeotian partisans there, namely, that\nthey should become allies of Corinth and Argos as a preliminary to a\njunction with Lacedaemon; fancying that, even if they should say nothing\nabout this, the councils would not vote against what had been decided\nand advised by the Boeotarchs. This difficulty arising, the Corinthians\nand the envoys from Thrace departed without anything having been\nconcluded; and the Boeotarchs, who had previously intended after\ncarrying this to try and effect the alliance with Argos, now omitted to\nbring the Argive question before the councils, or to send to Argos the\nenvoys whom they had promised; and a general coldness and delay ensued\nin the matter.\n\nIn this same winter Mecyberna was assaulted and taken by the Olynthians,\nhaving an Athenian garrison inside it.\n\nAll this while negotiations had been going on between the Athenians\nand Lacedaemonians about the conquests still retained by each, and\nLacedaemon, hoping that if Athens were to get back Panactum from the\nBoeotians she might herself recover Pylos, now sent an embassy to\nthe Boeotians, and begged them to place Panactum and their Athenian\nprisoners in her hands, in order that she might exchange them for Pylos.\nThis the Boeotians refused to do, unless Lacedaemon made a separate\nalliance with them as she had done with Athens. Lacedaemon knew that\nthis would be a breach of faith to Athens, as it had been agreed that\nneither of them should make peace or war without the other; yet wishing\nto obtain Panactum which she hoped to exchange for Pylos, and the party\nwho pressed for the dissolution of the treaty strongly affecting the\nBoeotian connection, she at length concluded the alliance just as\nwinter gave way to spring; and Panactum was instantly razed. And so the\neleventh year of the war ended.\n\nIn the first days of the summer following, the Argives, seeing that the\npromised ambassadors from Boeotia did not arrive, and that Panactum\nwas being demolished, and that a separate alliance had been concluded\nbetween the Boeotians and Lacedaemonians, began to be afraid that Argos\nmight be left alone, and all the confederacy go over to Lacedaemon. They\nfancied that the Boeotians had been persuaded by the Lacedaemonians to\nraze Panactum and to enter into the treaty with the Athenians, and that\nAthens was privy to this arrangement, and even her alliance, therefore,\nno longer open to them--a resource which they had always counted\nupon, by reason of the dissensions existing, in the event of the\nnoncontinuance of their treaty with Lacedaemon. In this strait the\nArgives, afraid that, as the result of refusing to renew the treaty with\nLacedaemon and of aspiring to the supremacy in Peloponnese, they would\nhave the Lacedaemonians, Tegeans, Boeotians, and Athenians on their\nhands all at once, now hastily sent off Eustrophus and Aeson, who seemed\nthe persons most likely to be acceptable, as envoys to Lacedaemon,\nwith the view of making as good a treaty as they could with the\nLacedaemonians, upon such terms as could be got, and being left in\npeace.\n\nHaving reached Lacedaemon, their ambassadors proceeded to negotiate the\nterms of the proposed treaty. What the Argives first demanded was that\nthey might be allowed to refer to the arbitration of some state or\nprivate person the question of the Cynurian land, a piece of frontier\nterritory about which they have always been disputing, and which\ncontains the towns of Thyrea and Anthene, and is occupied by the\nLacedaemonians. The Lacedaemonians at first said that they could not\nallow this point to be discussed, but were ready to conclude upon the\nold terms. Eventually, however, the Argive ambassadors succeeded in\nobtaining from them this concession: For the present there was to be\na truce for fifty years, but it should be competent for either party,\nthere being neither plague nor war in Lacedaemon or Argos, to give a\nformal challenge and decide the question of this territory by battle, as\non a former occasion, when both sides claimed the victory; pursuit\nnot being allowed beyond the frontier of Argos or Lacedaemon. The\nLacedaemonians at first thought this mere folly; but at last, anxious\nat any cost to have the friendship of Argos they agreed to the terms\ndemanded, and reduced them to writing. However, before any of this\nshould become binding, the ambassadors were to return to Argos and\ncommunicate with their people and, in the event of their approval, to\ncome at the feast of the Hyacinthia and take the oaths.\n\nThe envoys returned accordingly. In the meantime, while the\nArgives were engaged in these negotiations, the Lacedaemonian\nambassadors--Andromedes, Phaedimus, and Antimenidas--who were to receive\nthe prisoners from the Boeotians and restore them and Panactum to the\nAthenians, found that the Boeotians had themselves razed Panactum, upon\nthe plea that oaths had been anciently exchanged between their people\nand the Athenians, after a dispute on the subject to the effect that\nneither should inhabit the place, but that they should graze it in\ncommon. As for the Athenian prisoners of war in the hands of the\nBoeotians, these were delivered over to Andromedes and his colleagues,\nand by them conveyed to Athens and given back. The envoys at the same\ntime announced the razing of Panactum, which to them seemed as good as\nits restitution, as it would no longer lodge an enemy of Athens. This\nannouncement was received with great indignation by the Athenians,\nwho thought that the Lacedaemonians had played them false, both in the\nmatter of the demolition of Panactum, which ought to have been restored\nto them standing, and in having, as they now heard, made a separate\nalliance with the Boeotians, in spite of their previous promise to join\nAthens in compelling the adhesion of those who refused to accede to\nthe treaty. The Athenians also considered the other points in which\nLacedaemon had failed in her compact, and thinking that they had been\noverreached, gave an angry answer to the ambassadors and sent them away.\n\nThe breach between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians having gone thus\nfar, the party at Athens, also, who wished to cancel the treaty,\nimmediately put themselves in motion. Foremost amongst these was\nAlcibiades, son of Clinias, a man yet young in years for any other\nHellenic city, but distinguished by the splendour of his ancestry.\nAlcibiades thought the Argive alliance really preferable, not that\npersonal pique had not also a great deal to do with his opposition; he\nbeing offended with the Lacedaemonians for having negotiated the treaty\nthrough Nicias and Laches, and having overlooked him on account of his\nyouth, and also for not having shown him the respect due to the ancient\nconnection of his family with them as their proxeni, which, renounced\nby his grandfather, he had lately himself thought to renew by his\nattentions to their prisoners taken in the island. Being thus, as he\nthought, slighted on all hands, he had in the first instance spoken\nagainst the treaty, saying that the Lacedaemonians were not to be\ntrusted, but that they only treated, in order to be enabled by this\nmeans to crush Argos, and afterwards to attack Athens alone; and now,\nimmediately upon the above occurring, he sent privately to the Argives,\ntelling them to come as quickly as possible to Athens, accompanied by\nthe Mantineans and Eleans, with proposals of alliance; as the moment was\npropitious and he himself would do all he could to help them.\n\nUpon receiving this message and discovering that the Athenians, far from\nbeing privy to the Boeotian alliance, were involved in a serious quarrel\nwith the Lacedaemonians, the Argives paid no further attention to the\nembassy which they had just sent to Lacedaemon on the subject of the\ntreaty, and began to incline rather towards the Athenians, reflecting\nthat, in the event of war, they would thus have on their side a city\nthat was not only an ancient ally of Argos, but a sister democracy\nand very powerful at sea. They accordingly at once sent ambassadors to\nAthens to treat for an alliance, accompanied by others from Elis and\nMantinea.\n\nAt the same time arrived in haste from Lacedaemon an embassy consisting\nof persons reputed well disposed towards the Athenians--Philocharidas,\nLeon, and Endius--for fear that the Athenians in their irritation\nmight conclude alliance with the Argives, and also to ask back Pylos in\nexchange for Panactum, and in defence of the alliance with the Boeotians\nto plead that it had not been made to hurt the Athenians. Upon the\nenvoys speaking in the senate upon these points, and stating that they\nhad come with full powers to settle all others at issue between them,\nAlcibiades became afraid that, if they were to repeat these statements\nto the popular assembly, they might gain the multitude, and the\nArgive alliance might be rejected, and accordingly had recourse to\nthe following stratagem. He persuaded the Lacedaemonians by a solemn\nassurance that if they would say nothing of their full powers in\nthe assembly, he would give back Pylos to them (himself, the present\nopponent of its restitution, engaging to obtain this from the\nAthenians), and would settle the other points at issue. His plan was to\ndetach them from Nicias and to disgrace them before the people, as being\nwithout sincerity in their intentions, or even common consistency in\ntheir language, and so to get the Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans taken\ninto alliance. This plan proved successful. When the envoys appeared\nbefore the people, and upon the question being put to them, did not say\nas they had said in the senate, that they had come with full powers,\nthe Athenians lost all patience, and carried away by Alcibiades, who\nthundered more loudly than ever against the Lacedaemonians, were ready\ninstantly to introduce the Argives and their companions and to take\nthem into alliance. An earthquake, however, occurring, before anything\ndefinite had been done, this assembly was adjourned.\n\nIn the assembly held the next day, Nicias, in spite of the\nLacedaemonians having been deceived themselves, and having allowed\nhim to be deceived also in not admitting that they had come with\nfull powers, still maintained that it was best to be friends with the\nLacedaemonians, and, letting the Argive proposals stand over, to send\nonce more to Lacedaemon and learn her intentions. The adjournment of\nthe war could only increase their own prestige and injure that of their\nrivals; the excellent state of their affairs making it their interest to\npreserve this prosperity as long as possible, while those of Lacedaemon\nwere so desperate that the sooner she could try her fortune again the\nbetter. He succeeded accordingly in persuading them to send ambassadors,\nhimself being among the number, to invite the Lacedaemonians, if they\nwere really sincere, to restore Panactum intact with Amphipolis, and\nto abandon their alliance with the Boeotians (unless they consented to\naccede to the treaty), agreeably to the stipulation which forbade either\nto treat without the other. The ambassadors were also directed to say\nthat the Athenians, had they wished to play false, might already have\nmade alliance with the Argives, who were indeed come to Athens for that\nvery purpose, and went off furnished with instructions as to any other\ncomplaints that the Athenians had to make. Having reached Lacedaemon,\nthey communicated their instructions, and concluded by telling the\nLacedaemonians that unless they gave up their alliance with the\nBoeotians, in the event of their not acceding to the treaty, the\nAthenians for their part would ally themselves with the Argives and\ntheir friends. The Lacedaemonians, however, refused to give up the\nBoeotian alliance--the party of Xenares the ephor, and such as shared\ntheir view, carrying the day upon this point--but renewed the oaths at\nthe request of Nicias, who feared to return without having accomplished\nanything and to be disgraced; as was indeed his fate, he being held\nthe author of the treaty with Lacedaemon. When he returned, and the\nAthenians heard that nothing had been done at Lacedaemon, they flew into\na passion, and deciding that faith had not been kept with them, took\nadvantage of the presence of the Argives and their allies, who had been\nintroduced by Alcibiades, and made a treaty and alliance with them upon\nthe terms following:\n\nThe Athenians, Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans, acting for themselves\nand the allies in their respective empires, made a treaty for a hundred\nyears, to be without fraud or hurt by land and by sea.\n\n1. It shall not be lawful to carry on war, either for the Argives,\nEleans, Mantineans, and their allies, against the Athenians, or the\nallies in the Athenian empire: or for the Athenians and their allies\nagainst the Argives, Eleans, Mantineans, or their allies, in any way or\nmeans whatsoever.\n\nThe Athenians, Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans shall be allies for a\nhundred years upon the terms following:\n\n2. If an enemy invade the country of the Athenians, the Argives, Eleans,\nand Mantineans shall go to the relief of Athens, according as the\nAthenians may require by message, in such way as they most effectually\ncan, to the best of their power. But if the invader be gone after\nplundering the territory, the offending state shall be the enemy of\nthe Argives, Mantineans, Eleans, and Athenians, and war shall be made\nagainst it by all these cities: and no one of the cities shall be able\nto make peace with that state, except all the above cities agree to do\nso.\n\n3. Likewise the Athenians shall go to the relief of Argos, Mantinea,\nand Elis, if an enemy invade the country of Elis, Mantinea, or Argos,\naccording as the above cities may require by message, in such way\nas they most effectually can, to the best of their power. But if the\ninvader be gone after plundering the territory, the state offending\nshall be the enemy of the Athenians, Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans,\nand war shall be made against it by all these cities, and peace may not\nbe made with that state except all the above cities agree to it.\n\n4. No armed force shall be allowed to pass for hostile purposes through\nthe country of the powers contracting, or of the allies in their\nrespective empires, or to go by sea, except all the cities--that is to\nsay, Athens, Argos, Mantinea, and Elis--vote for such passage.\n\n5. The relieving troops shall be maintained by the city sending them for\nthirty days from their arrival in the city that has required them, and\nupon their return in the same way: if their services be desired for a\nlonger period, the city that sent for them shall maintain them, at the\nrate of three Aeginetan obols per day for a heavy-armed soldier, archer,\nor light soldier, and an Aeginetan drachma for a trooper.\n\n6. The city sending for the troops shall have the command when the war\nis in its own country: but in case of the cities resolving upon a joint\nexpedition the command shall be equally divided among all the cities.\n\n7. The treaty shall be sworn to by the Athenians for themselves and\ntheir allies, by the Argives, Mantineans, Eleans, and their allies, by\neach state individually. Each shall swear the oath most binding in his\ncountry over full-grown victims: the oath being as follows:\n\n\"I STAND BY THE ALLIANCE AND ITS ARTICLES, JUSTLY, INNOCENTLY, AND\nSINCERELY, AND I WILL NOT TRANSGRESS THE SAME IN ANY WAY OR MEANS\nWHATSOEVER.\"\n\nThe oath shall be taken at Athens by the Senate and the magistrates, the\nPrytanes administering it: at Argos by the Senate, the Eighty, and the\nArtynae, the Eighty administering it: at Mantinea by the Demiurgi,\nthe Senate, and the other magistrates, the Theori and Polemarchs\nadministering it: at Elis by the Demiurgi, the magistrates, and the Six\nHundred, the Demiurgi and the Thesmophylaces administering it. The oaths\nshall be renewed by the Athenians going to Elis, Mantinea, and Argos\nthirty days before the Olympic games: by the Argives, Mantineans,\nand Eleans going to Athens ten days before the great feast of the\nPanathenaea. The articles of the treaty, the oaths, and the alliance\nshall be inscribed on a stone pillar by the Athenians in the citadel,\nby the Argives in the market-place, in the temple of Apollo: by the\nMantineans in the temple of Zeus, in the market-place: and a brazen\npillar shall be erected jointly by them at the Olympic games now at\nhand. Should the above cities see good to make any addition in these\narticles, whatever all the above cities shall agree upon, after\nconsulting together, shall be binding.\n\nAlthough the treaty and alliances were thus concluded, still the treaty\nbetween the Lacedaemonians and Athenians was not renounced by either\nparty. Meanwhile Corinth, although the ally of the Argives, did not\naccede to the new treaty, any more than she had done to the alliance,\ndefensive and offensive, formed before this between the Eleans, Argives,\nand Mantineans, when she declared herself content with the first\nalliance, which was defensive only, and which bound them to help each\nother, but not to join in attacking any. The Corinthians thus stood\naloof from their allies, and again turned their thoughts towards\nLacedaemon.\n\nAt the Olympic games which were held this summer, and in which the\nArcadian Androsthenes was victor the first time in the wrestling and\nboxing, the Lacedaemonians were excluded from the temple by the Eleans,\nand thus prevented from sacrificing or contending, for having refused\nto pay the fine specified in the Olympic law imposed upon them by the\nEleans, who alleged that they had attacked Fort Phyrcus, and sent heavy\ninfantry of theirs into Lepreum during the Olympic truce. The amount of\nthe fine was two thousand minae, two for each heavy-armed soldier, as\nthe law prescribes. The Lacedaemonians sent envoys, and pleaded that the\nimposition was unjust; saying that the truce had not yet been proclaimed\nat Lacedaemon when the heavy infantry were sent off. But the Eleans\naffirmed that the armistice with them had already begun (they\nproclaim it first among themselves), and that the aggression of the\nLacedaemonians had taken them by surprise while they were living\nquietly as in time of peace, and not expecting anything. Upon this the\nLacedaemonians submitted, that if the Eleans really believed that they\nhad committed an aggression, it was useless after that to proclaim the\ntruce at Lacedaemon; but they had proclaimed it notwithstanding, as\nbelieving nothing of the kind, and from that moment the Lacedaemonians\nhad made no attack upon their country. Nevertheless the Eleans adhered\nto what they had said, that nothing would persuade them that an\naggression had not been committed; if, however, the Lacedaemonians would\nrestore Lepreum, they would give up their own share of the money and pay\nthat of the god for them.\n\nAs this proposal was not accepted, the Eleans tried a second. Instead\nof restoring Lepreum, if this was objected to, the Lacedaemonians should\nascend the altar of the Olympian Zeus, as they were so anxious to have\naccess to the temple, and swear before the Hellenes that they would\nsurely pay the fine at a later day. This being also refused, the\nLacedaemonians were excluded from the temple, the sacrifice, and\nthe games, and sacrificed at home; the Lepreans being the only other\nHellenes who did not attend. Still the Eleans were afraid of the\nLacedaemonians sacrificing by force, and kept guard with a heavy-armed\ncompany of their young men; being also joined by a thousand Argives, the\nsame number of Mantineans, and by some Athenian cavalry who stayed at\nHarpina during the feast. Great fears were felt in the assembly of\nthe Lacedaemonians coming in arms, especially after Lichas, son of\nArcesilaus, a Lacedaemonian, had been scourged on the course by the\numpires; because, upon his horses being the winners, and the Boeotian\npeople being proclaimed the victor on account of his having no right\nto enter, he came forward on the course and crowned the charioteer, in\norder to show that the chariot was his. After this incident all\nwere more afraid than ever, and firmly looked for a disturbance: the\nLacedaemonians, however, kept quiet, and let the feast pass by, as we\nhave seen. After the Olympic games, the Argives and the allies repaired\nto Corinth to invite her to come over to them. There they found some\nLacedaemonian envoys; and a long discussion ensued, which after all\nended in nothing, as an earthquake occurred, and they dispersed to their\ndifferent homes.\n\nSummer was now over. The winter following a battle took place between\nthe Heracleots in Trachinia and the Aenianians, Dolopians, Malians, and\ncertain of the Thessalians, all tribes bordering on and hostile to the\ntown, which directly menaced their country. Accordingly, after having\nopposed and harassed it from its very foundation by every means in their\npower, they now in this battle defeated the Heracleots, Xenares, son of\nCnidis, their Lacedaemonian commander, being among the slain. Thus the\nwinter ended and the twelfth year of this war ended also. After the\nbattle, Heraclea was so terribly reduced that in the first days of the\nsummer following the Boeotians occupied the place and sent away the\nLacedaemonian Agesippidas for misgovernment, fearing that the town might\nbe taken by the Athenians while the Lacedaemonians were distracted\nwith the affairs of Peloponnese. The Lacedaemonians, nevertheless, were\noffended with them for what they had done.\n\nThe same summer Alcibiades, son of Clinias, now one of the generals\nat Athens, in concert with the Argives and the allies, went into\nPeloponnese with a few Athenian heavy infantry and archers and some of\nthe allies in those parts whom he took up as he passed, and with this\narmy marched here and there through Peloponnese, and settled various\nmatters connected with the alliance, and among other things induced the\nPatrians to carry their walls down to the sea, intending himself also\nto build a fort near the Achaean Rhium. However, the Corinthians and\nSicyonians, and all others who would have suffered by its being built,\ncame up and hindered him.\n\nThe same summer war broke out between the Epidaurians and Argives. The\npretext was that the Epidaurians did not send an offering for their\npasture-land to Apollo Pythaeus, as they were bound to do, the Argives\nhaving the chief management of the temple; but, apart from this pretext,\nAlcibiades and the Argives were determined, if possible, to gain\npossession of Epidaurus, and thus to ensure the neutrality of Corinth\nand give the Athenians a shorter passage for their reinforcements from\nAegina than if they had to sail round Scyllaeum. The Argives accordingly\nprepared to invade Epidaurus by themselves, to exact the offering.\n\nAbout the same time the Lacedaemonians marched out with all their people\nto Leuctra upon their frontier, opposite to Mount Lycaeum, under the\ncommand of Agis, son of Archidamus, without any one knowing their\ndestination, not even the cities that sent the contingents. The\nsacrifices, however, for crossing the frontier not proving propitious,\nthe Lacedaemonians returned home themselves, and sent word to the allies\nto be ready to march after the month ensuing, which happened to be the\nmonth of Carneus, a holy time for the Dorians. Upon the retreat of the\nLacedaemonians the Argives marched out on the last day but three of the\nmonth before Carneus, and keeping this as the day during the whole time\nthat they were out, invaded and plundered Epidaurus. The Epidaurians\nsummoned their allies to their aid, some of whom pleaded the month as\nan excuse; others came as far as the frontier of Epidaurus and there\nremained inactive.\n\nWhile the Argives were in Epidaurus embassies from the cities assembled\nat Mantinea, upon the invitation of the Athenians. The conference having\nbegun, the Corinthian Euphamidas said that their actions did not agree\nwith their words; while they were sitting deliberating about peace, the\nEpidaurians and their allies and the Argives were arrayed against each\nother in arms; deputies from each party should first go and separate the\narmies, and then the talk about peace might be resumed. In compliance\nwith this suggestion, they went and brought back the Argives from\nEpidaurus, and afterwards reassembled, but without succeeding any\nbetter in coming to a conclusion; and the Argives a second time invaded\nEpidaurus and plundered the country. The Lacedaemonians also marched out\nto Caryae; but the frontier sacrifices again proving unfavourable, they\nwent back again, and the Argives, after ravaging about a third of the\nEpidaurian territory, returned home. Meanwhile a thousand Athenian heavy\ninfantry had come to their aid under the command of Alcibiades, but\nfinding that the Lacedaemonian expedition was at an end, and that they\nwere no longer wanted, went back again.\n\nSo passed the summer. The next winter the Lacedaemonians managed to\nelude the vigilance of the Athenians, and sent in a garrison of three\nhundred men to Epidaurus, under the command of Agesippidas. Upon this\nthe Argives went to the Athenians and complained of their having allowed\nan enemy to pass by sea, in spite of the clause in the treaty by which\nthe allies were not to allow an enemy to pass through their country.\nUnless, therefore, they now put the Messenians and Helots in Pylos to\nannoy the Lacedaemonians, they, the Argives, should consider that faith\nhad not been kept with them. The Athenians were persuaded by Alcibiades\nto inscribe at the bottom of the Laconian pillar that the Lacedaemonians\nhad not kept their oaths, and to convey the Helots at Cranii to Pylos\nto plunder the country; but for the rest they remained quiet as\nbefore. During this winter hostilities went on between the Argives and\nEpidaurians, without any pitched battle taking place, but only forays\nand ambuscades, in which the losses were small and fell now on one side\nand now on the other. At the close of the winter, towards the beginning\nof spring, the Argives went with scaling ladders to Epidaurus, expecting\nto find it left unguarded on account of the war and to be able to take\nit by assault, but returned unsuccessful. And the winter ended, and with\nit the thirteenth year of the war ended also.\n\nIn the middle of the next summer the Lacedaemonians, seeing the\nEpidaurians, their allies, in distress, and the rest of Peloponnese\neither in revolt or disaffected, concluded that it was high time for\nthem to interfere if they wished to stop the progress of the evil, and\naccordingly with their full force, the Helots included, took the field\nagainst Argos, under the command of Agis, son of Archidamus, king of the\nLacedaemonians. The Tegeans and the other Arcadian allies of Lacedaemon\njoined in the expedition. The allies from the rest of Peloponnese and\nfrom outside mustered at Phlius; the Boeotians with five thousand heavy\ninfantry and as many light troops, and five hundred horse and the same\nnumber of dismounted troopers; the Corinthians with two thousand heavy\ninfantry; the rest more or less as might happen; and the Phliasians with\nall their forces, the army being in their country.\n\nThe preparations of the Lacedaemonians from the first had been known to\nthe Argives, who did not, however, take the field until the enemy was on\nhis road to join the rest at Phlius. Reinforced by the Mantineans with\ntheir allies, and by three thousand Elean heavy infantry, they advanced\nand fell in with the Lacedaemonians at Methydrium in Arcadia. Each party\ntook up its position upon a hill, and the Argives prepared to engage the\nLacedaemonians while they were alone; but Agis eluded them by breaking\nup his camp in the night, and proceeded to join the rest of the allies\nat Phlius. The Argives discovering this at daybreak, marched first\nto Argos and then to the Nemean road, by which they expected the\nLacedaemonians and their allies would come down. However, Agis,\ninstead of taking this road as they expected, gave the Lacedaemonians,\nArcadians, and Epidaurians their orders, and went along another\ndifficult road, and descended into the plain of Argos. The Corinthians,\nPellenians, and Phliasians marched by another steep road; while the\nBoeotians, Megarians, and Sicyonians had instructions to come down by\nthe Nemean road where the Argives were posted, in order that, if the\nenemy advanced into the plain against the troops of Agis, they might\nfall upon his rear with their cavalry. These dispositions concluded,\nAgis invaded the plain and began to ravage Saminthus and other places.\n\nDiscovering this, the Argives came up from Nemea, day having now\ndawned. On their way they fell in with the troops of the Phliasians and\nCorinthians, and killed a few of the Phliasians and had perhaps a\nfew more of their own men killed by the Corinthians. Meanwhile the\nBoeotians, Megarians, and Sicyonians, advancing upon Nemea according to\ntheir instructions, found the Argives no longer there, as they had gone\ndown on seeing their property ravaged, and were now forming for battle,\nthe Lacedaemonians imitating their example. The Argives were now\ncompletely surrounded; from the plain the Lacedaemonians and their\nallies shut them off from their city; above them were the Corinthians,\nPhliasians, and Pellenians; and on the side of Nemea the Boeotians,\nSicyonians, and Megarians. Meanwhile their army was without cavalry, the\nAthenians alone among the allies not having yet arrived. Now the bulk of\nthe Argives and their allies did not see the danger of their position,\nbut thought that they could not have a fairer field, having intercepted\nthe Lacedaemonians in their own country and close to the city. Two men,\nhowever, in the Argive army, Thrasylus, one of the five generals, and\nAlciphron, the Lacedaemonian proxenus, just as the armies were upon the\npoint of engaging, went and held a parley with Agis and urged him not to\nbring on a battle, as the Argives were ready to refer to fair and equal\narbitration whatever complaints the Lacedaemonians might have against\nthem, and to make a treaty and live in peace in future.\n\nThe Argives who made these statements did so upon their own authority,\nnot by order of the people, and Agis on his accepted their proposals,\nand without himself either consulting the majority, simply communicated\nthe matter to a single individual, one of the high officers accompanying\nthe expedition, and granted the Argives a truce for four months, in\nwhich to fulfil their promises; after which he immediately led off the\narmy without giving any explanation to any of the other allies. The\nLacedaemonians and allies followed their general out of respect for the\nlaw, but amongst themselves loudly blamed Agis for going away from so\nfair a field (the enemy being hemmed in on every side by infantry and\ncavalry) without having done anything worthy of their strength. Indeed\nthis was by far the finest Hellenic army ever yet brought together; and\nit should have been seen while it was still united at Nemea, with the\nLacedaemonians in full force, the Arcadians, Boeotians, Corinthians,\nSicyonians, Pellenians, Phliasians and Megarians, and all these the\nflower of their respective populations, thinking themselves a match not\nmerely for the Argive confederacy, but for another such added to it. The\narmy thus retired blaming Agis, and returned every man to his home. The\nArgives however blamed still more loudly the persons who had concluded\nthe truce without consulting the people, themselves thinking that they\nhad let escape with the Lacedaemonians an opportunity such as they\nshould never see again; as the struggle would have been under the walls\nof their city, and by the side of many and brave allies. On their return\naccordingly they began to stone Thrasylus in the bed of the Charadrus,\nwhere they try all military causes before entering the city. Thrasylus\nfled to the altar, and so saved his life; his property however they\nconfiscated.\n\nAfter this arrived a thousand Athenian heavy infantry and three hundred\nhorse, under the command of Laches and Nicostratus; whom the Argives,\nbeing nevertheless loath to break the truce with the Lacedaemonians,\nbegged to depart, and refused to bring before the people, to whom they\nhad a communication to make, until compelled to do so by the entreaties\nof the Mantineans and Eleans, who were still at Argos. The Athenians, by\nthe mouth of Alcibiades their ambassador there present, told the Argives\nand the allies that they had no right to make a truce at all without\nthe consent of their fellow confederates, and now that the Athenians\nhad arrived so opportunely the war ought to be resumed. These arguments\nproving successful with the allies, they immediately marched upon\nOrchomenos, all except the Argives, who, although they had consented\nlike the rest, stayed behind at first, but eventually joined the others.\nThey now all sat down and besieged Orchomenos, and made assaults upon\nit; one of their reasons for desiring to gain this place being that\nhostages from Arcadia had been lodged there by the Lacedaemonians. The\nOrchomenians, alarmed at the weakness of their wall and the numbers of\nthe enemy, and at the risk they ran of perishing before relief arrived,\ncapitulated upon condition of joining the league, of giving hostages of\ntheir own to the Mantineans, and giving up those lodged with them by the\nLacedaemonians. Orchomenos thus secured, the allies now consulted as to\nwhich of the remaining places they should attack next. The Eleans\nwere urgent for Lepreum; the Mantineans for Tegea; and the Argives and\nAthenians giving their support to the Mantineans, the Eleans went home\nin a rage at their not having voted for Lepreum; while the rest of the\nallies made ready at Mantinea for going against Tegea, which a party\ninside had arranged to put into their hands.\n\nMeanwhile the Lacedaemonians, upon their return from Argos after\nconcluding the four months' truce, vehemently blamed Agis for not having\nsubdued Argos, after an opportunity such as they thought they had never\nhad before; for it was no easy matter to bring so many and so good\nallies together. But when the news arrived of the capture of Orchomenos,\nthey became more angry than ever, and, departing from all precedent, in\nthe heat of the moment had almost decided to raze his house, and to fine\nhim ten thousand drachmae. Agis however entreated them to do none of\nthese things, promising to atone for his fault by good service in the\nfield, failing which they might then do to him whatever they pleased;\nand they accordingly abstained from razing his house or fining him\nas they had threatened to do, and now made a law, hitherto unknown at\nLacedaemon, attaching to him ten Spartans as counsellors, without whose\nconsent he should have no power to lead an army out of the city.\n\nAt this juncture arrived word from their friends in Tegea that, unless\nthey speedily appeared, Tegea would go over from them to the Argives and\ntheir allies, if it had not gone over already. Upon this news a force\nmarched out from Lacedaemon, of the Spartans and Helots and all their\npeople, and that instantly and upon a scale never before witnessed.\nAdvancing to Orestheum in Maenalia, they directed the Arcadians in their\nleague to follow close after them to Tegea, and, going on themselves as\nfar as Orestheum, from thence sent back the sixth part of the Spartans,\nconsisting of the oldest and youngest men, to guard their homes, and\nwith the rest of their army arrived at Tegea; where their Arcadian\nallies soon after joined them. Meanwhile they sent to Corinth, to the\nBoeotians, the Phocians, and Locrians, with orders to come up as quickly\nas possible to Mantinea. These had but short notice; and it was not easy\nexcept all together, and after waiting for each other, to pass through\nthe enemy's country, which lay right across and blocked up the line of\ncommunication. Nevertheless they made what haste they could. Meanwhile\nthe Lacedaemonians with the Arcadian allies that had joined them,\nentered the territory of Mantinea, and encamping near the temple of\nHeracles began to plunder the country.\n\nHere they were seen by the Argives and their allies, who immediately\ntook up a strong and difficult position, and formed in order of battle.\nThe Lacedaemonians at once advanced against them, and came on within a\nstone's throw or javelin's cast, when one of the older men, seeing the\nenemy's position to be a strong one, hallooed to Agis that he was minded\nto cure one evil with another; meaning that he wished to make amends for\nhis retreat, which had been so much blamed, from Argos, by his present\nuntimely precipitation. Meanwhile Agis, whether in consequence of this\nhalloo or of some sudden new idea of his own, quickly led back his army\nwithout engaging, and entering the Tegean territory, began to turn off\ninto that of Mantinea the water about which the Mantineans and Tegeans\nare always fighting, on account of the extensive damage it does to\nwhichever of the two countries it falls into. His object in this was to\nmake the Argives and their allies come down from the hill, to resist the\ndiversion of the water, as they would be sure to do when they knew of\nit, and thus to fight the battle in the plain. He accordingly stayed\nthat day where he was, engaged in turning off the water. The Argives\nand their allies were at first amazed at the sudden retreat of the enemy\nafter advancing so near, and did not know what to make of it; but when\nhe had gone away and disappeared, without their having stirred to pursue\nhim, they began anew to find fault with their generals, who had not\nonly let the Lacedaemonians get off before, when they were so happily\nintercepted before Argos, but who now again allowed them to run away,\nwithout any one pursuing them, and to escape at their leisure while the\nArgive army was leisurely betrayed.  The generals, half-stunned for the\nmoment, afterwards led them down from the hill, and went forward and\nencamped in the plain, with the intention of attacking the enemy.\n\nThe next day the Argives and their allies formed in the order in which\nthey meant to fight, if they chanced to encounter the enemy; and the\nLacedaemonians returning from the water to their old encampment by the\ntemple of Heracles, suddenly saw their adversaries close in front of\nthem, all in complete order, and advanced from the hill. A shock like\nthat of the present moment the Lacedaemonians do not ever remember\nto have experienced: there was scant time for preparation, as they\ninstantly and hastily fell into their ranks, Agis, their king, directing\neverything, agreeably to the law. For when a king is in the field all\ncommands proceed from him: he gives the word to the Polemarchs; they to\nthe Lochages; these to the Pentecostyes; these again to the Enomotarchs,\nand these last to the Enomoties. In short all orders required pass\nin the same way and quickly reach the troops; as almost the whole\nLacedaemonian army, save for a small part, consists of officers under\nofficers, and the care of what is to be done falls upon many.\n\nIn this battle the left wing was composed of the Sciritae, who in a\nLacedaemonian army have always that post to themselves alone; next to\nthese were the soldiers of Brasidas from Thrace, and the Neodamodes with\nthem; then came the Lacedaemonians themselves, company after company,\nwith the Arcadians of Heraea at their side. After these were the\nMaenalians, and on the right wing the Tegeans with a few of the\nLacedaemonians at the extremity; their cavalry being posted upon the two\nwings. Such was the Lacedaemonian formation. That of their opponents was\nas follows: On the right were the Mantineans, the action taking place in\ntheir country; next to them the allies from Arcadia; after whom came the\nthousand picked men of the Argives, to whom the state had given a long\ncourse of military training at the public expense; next to them the rest\nof the Argives, and after them their allies, the Cleonaeans and Orneans,\nand lastly the Athenians on the extreme left, and lastly the Athenians\non the extreme left, and their own cavalry with them.\n\nSuch were the order and the forces of the two combatants. The\nLacedaemonian army looked the largest; though as to putting down the\nnumbers of either host, or of the contingents composing it, I could not\ndo so with any accuracy. Owing to the secrecy of their government the\nnumber of the Lacedaemonians was not known, and men are so apt to brag\nabout the forces of their country that the estimate of their opponents\nwas not trusted. The following calculation, however, makes it possible\nto estimate the numbers of the Lacedaemonians present upon this\noccasion. There were seven companies in the field without counting the\nSciritae, who numbered six hundred men: in each company there were four\nPentecostyes, and in the Pentecosty four Enomoties. The first rank of\nthe Enomoty was composed of four soldiers: as to the depth, although\nthey had not been all drawn up alike, but as each captain chose, they\nwere generally ranged eight deep; the first rank along the whole line,\nexclusive of the Sciritae, consisted of four hundred and forty-eight\nmen.\n\nThe armies being now on the eve of engaging, each contingent received\nsome words of encouragement from its own commander. The Mantineans were,\nreminded that they were going to fight for their country and to avoid\nreturning to the experience of servitude after having tasted that\nof empire; the Argives, that they would contend for their ancient\nsupremacy, to regain their once equal share of Peloponnese of which they\nhad been so long deprived, and to punish an enemy and a neighbour for a\nthousand wrongs; the Athenians, of the glory of gaining the honours of\nthe day with so many and brave allies in arms, and that a victory over\nthe Lacedaemonians in Peloponnese would cement and extend their empire,\nand would besides preserve Attica from all invasions in future. These\nwere the incitements addressed to the Argives and their allies. The\nLacedaemonians meanwhile, man to man, and with their war-songs in\nthe ranks, exhorted each brave comrade to remember what he had learnt\nbefore; well aware that the long training of action was of more\nsaving virtue than any brief verbal exhortation, though never so well\ndelivered.\n\nAfter this they joined battle, the Argives and their allies advancing\nwith haste and fury, the Lacedaemonians slowly and to the music of many\nflute-players--a standing institution in their army, that has nothing to\ndo with religion, but is meant to make them advance evenly, stepping in\ntime, without break their order, as large armies are apt to do in the\nmoment of engaging.\n\nJust before the battle joined, King Agis resolved upon the following\nmanoeuvre. All armies are alike in this: on going into action they get\nforced out rather on their right wing, and one and the other overlap\nwith this adversary's left; because fear makes each man do his best\nto shelter his unarmed side with the shield of the man next him on the\nright, thinking that the closer the shields are locked together the\nbetter will he be protected. The man primarily responsible for this is\nthe first upon the right wing, who is always striving to withdraw from\nthe enemy his unarmed side; and the same apprehension makes the rest\nfollow him. On the present occasion the Mantineans reached with their\nwing far beyond the Sciritae, and the Lacedaemonians and Tegeans still\nfarther beyond the Athenians, as their army was the largest. Agis,\nafraid of his left being surrounded, and thinking that the Mantineans\noutflanked it too far, ordered the Sciritae and Brasideans to move\nout from their place in the ranks and make the line even with the\nMantineans, and told the Polemarchs Hipponoidas and Aristocles to\nfill up the gap thus formed, by throwing themselves into it with two\ncompanies taken from the right wing; thinking that his right would still\nbe strong enough and to spare, and that the line fronting the Mantineans\nwould gain in solidity.\n\nHowever, as he gave these orders in the moment of the onset, and at\nshort notice, it so happened that Aristocles and Hipponoidas would not\nmove over, for which offence they were afterwards banished from Sparta,\nas having been guilty of cowardice; and the enemy meanwhile closed\nbefore the Sciritae (whom Agis on seeing that the two companies did\nnot move over ordered to return to their place) had time to fill up\nthe breach in question. Now it was, however, that the Lacedaemonians,\nutterly worsted in respect of skill, showed themselves as superior in\npoint of courage. As soon as they came to close quarters with the enemy,\nthe Mantinean right broke their Sciritae and Brasideans, and, bursting\nin with their allies and the thousand picked Argives into the unclosed\nbreach in their line, cut up and surrounded the Lacedaemonians, and\ndrove them in full rout to the wagons, slaying some of the older men on\nguard there. But the Lacedaemonians, worsted in this part of the field,\nwith the rest of their army, and especially the centre, where the three\nhundred knights, as they are called, fought round King Agis, fell on\nthe older men of the Argives and the five companies so named, and on\nthe Cleonaeans, the Orneans, and the Athenians next them, and instantly\nrouted them; the greater number not even waiting to strike a blow, but\ngiving way the moment that they came on, some even being trodden under\nfoot, in their fear of being overtaken by their assailants.\n\nThe army of the Argives and their allies, having given way in this\nquarter, was now completely cut in two, and the Lacedaemonian and Tegean\nright simultaneously closing round the Athenians with the troops that\noutflanked them, these last found themselves placed between two fires,\nbeing surrounded on one side and already defeated on the other. Indeed\nthey would have suffered more severely than any other part of the army,\nbut for the services of the cavalry which they had with them. Agis also\non perceiving the distress of his left opposed to the Mantineans and the\nthousand Argives, ordered all the army to advance to the support of the\ndefeated wing; and while this took place, as the enemy moved past and\nslanted away from them, the Athenians escaped at their leisure, and\nwith them the beaten Argive division. Meanwhile the Mantineans and their\nallies and the picked body of the Argives ceased to press the enemy,\nand seeing their friends defeated and the Lacedaemonians in full advance\nupon them, took to flight. Many of the Mantineans perished; but the bulk\nof the picked body of the Argives made good their escape. The flight\nand retreat, however, were neither hurried nor long; the Lacedaemonians\nfighting long and stubbornly until the rout of their enemy, but that\nonce effected, pursuing for a short time and not far.\n\nSuch was the battle, as nearly as possible as I have described it; the\ngreatest that had occurred for a very long while among the Hellenes,\nand joined by the most considerable states. The Lacedaemonians took up\na position in front of the enemy's dead, and immediately set up a trophy\nand stripped the slain; they took up their own dead and carried them\nback to Tegea, where they buried them, and restored those of the enemy\nunder truce. The Argives, Orneans, and Cleonaeans had seven hundred\nkilled; the Mantineans two hundred, and the Athenians and Aeginetans\nalso two hundred, with both their generals. On the side of the\nLacedaemonians, the allies did not suffer any loss worth speaking of: as\nto the Lacedaemonians themselves it was difficult to learn the truth; it\nis said, however, that there were slain about three hundred of them.\n\nWhile the battle was impending, Pleistoanax, the other king, set out\nwith a reinforcement composed of the oldest and youngest men, and got\nas far as Tegea, where he heard of the victory and went back again. The\nLacedaemonians also sent and turned back the allies from Corinth and\nfrom beyond the Isthmus, and returning themselves dismissed their\nallies, and kept the Carnean holidays, which happened to be at that\ntime. The imputations cast upon them by the Hellenes at the time,\nwhether of cowardice on account of the disaster in the island, or of\nmismanagement and slowness generally, were all wiped out by this single\naction: fortune, it was thought, might have humbled them, but the men\nthemselves were the same as ever.\n\nThe day before this battle, the Epidaurians with all their forces\ninvaded the deserted Argive territory, and cut off many of the guards\nleft there in the absence of the Argive army. After the battle three\nthousand Elean heavy infantry arriving to aid the Mantineans, and a\nreinforcement of one thousand Athenians, all these allies marched\nat once against Epidaurus, while the Lacedaemonians were keeping the\nCarnea, and dividing the work among them began to build a wall round\nthe city. The rest left off; but the Athenians finished at once the part\nassigned to them round Cape Heraeum; and having all joined in leaving\na garrison in the fortification in question, they returned to their\nrespective cities.\n\nSummer now came to an end. In the first days of the next winter, when\nthe Carnean holidays were over, the Lacedaemonians took the field, and\narriving at Tegea sent on to Argos proposals of accommodation. They had\nbefore had a party in the town desirous of overthrowing the democracy;\nand after the battle that had been fought, these were now far more in a\nposition to persuade the people to listen to terms. Their plan was first\nto make a treaty with the Lacedaemonians, to be followed by an alliance,\nand after this to fall upon the commons. Lichas, son of Arcesilaus, the\nArgive proxenus, accordingly arrived at Argos with two proposals from\nLacedaemon, to regulate the conditions of war or peace, according as\nthey preferred the one or the other. After much discussion, Alcibiades\nhappening to be in the town, the Lacedaemonian party, who now ventured\nto act openly, persuaded the Argives to accept the proposal for\naccommodation; which ran as follows:\n\nThe assembly of the Lacedaemonians agrees to treat with the Argives upon\nthe terms following:\n\n1. The Argives shall restore to the Orchomenians their children, and\nto the Maenalians their men, and shall restore the men they have in\nMantinea to the Lacedaemonians.\n\n2. They shall evacuate Epidaurus, and raze the fortification there. If\nthe Athenians refuse to withdraw from Epidaurus, they shall be declared\nenemies of the Argives and of the Lacedaemonians, and of the allies of\nthe Lacedaemonians and the allies of the Argives.\n\n3. If the Lacedaemonians have any children in their custody, they shall\nrestore them every one to his city.\n\n4. As to the offering to the god, the Argives, if they wish, shall\nimpose an oath upon the Epidaurians, but, if not, they shall swear it\nthemselves.\n\n5. All the cities in Peloponnese, both small and great, shall be\nindependent according to the customs of their country.\n\n6. If any of the powers outside Peloponnese invade Peloponnesian\nterritory, the parties contracting shall unite to repel them, on such\nterms as they may agree upon, as being most fair for the Peloponnesians.\n\n7. All allies of the Lacedaemonians outside Peloponnese shall be on the\nsame footing as the Lacedaemonians, and the allies of the Argives shall\nbe on the same footing as the Argives, being left in enjoyment of their\nown possessions.\n\n8. This treaty shall be shown to the allies, and shall be concluded, if\nthey approve; if the allies think fit, they may send the treaty to be\nconsidered at home.\n\nThe Argives began by accepting this proposal, and the Lacedaemonian army\nreturned home from Tegea. After this intercourse was renewed between\nthem, and not long afterwards the same party contrived that the Argives\nshould give up the league with the Mantineans, Eleans, and Athenians,\nand should make a treaty and alliance with the Lacedaemonians; which was\nconsequently done upon the terms following:\n\nThe Lacedaemonians and Argives agree to a treaty and alliance for fifty\nyears upon the terms following:\n\n1. All disputes shall be decided by fair and impartial arbitration,\nagreeably to the customs of the two countries.\n\n2. The rest of the cities in Peloponnese may be included in this treaty\nand alliance, as independent and sovereign, in full enjoyment of\nwhat they possess, all disputes being decided by fair and impartial\narbitration, agreeably to the customs of the said cities.\n\n3. All allies of the Lacedaemonians outside Peloponnese shall be upon\nthe same footing as the Lacedaemonians themselves, and the allies of\nthe Argives shall be upon the same footing as the Argives themselves,\ncontinuing to enjoy what they possess.\n\n4. If it shall be anywhere necessary to make an expedition in common,\nthe Lacedaemonians and Argives shall consult upon it and decide, as may\nbe most fair for the allies.\n\n5. If any of the cities, whether inside or outside Peloponnese, have a\nquestion whether of frontiers or otherwise, it must be settled, but if\none allied city should have a quarrel with another allied city, it\nmust be referred to some third city thought impartial by both parties.\nPrivate citizens shall have their disputes decided according to the laws\nof their several countries.\n\nThe treaty and above alliance concluded, each party at once released\neverything whether acquired by war or otherwise, and thenceforth acting\nin common voted to receive neither herald nor embassy from the Athenians\nunless they evacuated their forts and withdrew from Peloponnese, and\nalso to make neither peace nor war with any, except jointly. Zeal was\nnot wanting: both parties sent envoys to the Thracian places and to\nPerdiccas, and persuaded the latter to join their league. Still he did\nnot at once break off from Athens, although minded to do so upon seeing\nthe way shown him by Argos, the original home of his family. They also\nrenewed their old oaths with the Chalcidians and took new ones: the\nArgives, besides, sent ambassadors to the Athenians, bidding them\nevacuate the fort at Epidaurus. The Athenians, seeing their own men\noutnumbered by the rest of the garrison, sent Demosthenes to bring them\nout. This general, under colour of a gymnastic contest which he arranged\non his arrival, got the rest of the garrison out of the place, and shut\nthe gates behind them. Afterwards the Athenians renewed their treaty\nwith the Epidaurians, and by themselves gave up the fortress.\n\nAfter the defection of Argos from the league, the Mantineans, though\nthey held out at first, in the end finding themselves powerless without\nthe Argives, themselves too came to terms with Lacedaemon, and gave up\ntheir sovereignty over the towns. The Lacedaemonians and Argives, each a\nthousand strong, now took the field together, and the former first went\nby themselves to Sicyon and made the government there more oligarchical\nthan before, and then both, uniting, put down the democracy at Argos and\nset up an oligarchy favourable to Lacedaemon. These events occurred at\nthe close of the winter, just before spring; and the fourteenth year of\nthe war ended. The next summer the people of Dium, in Athos, revolted\nfrom the Athenians to the Chalcidians, and the Lacedaemonians settled\naffairs in Achaea in a way more agreeable to the interests of their\ncountry. Meanwhile the popular party at Argos little by little\ngathered new consistency and courage, and waited for the moment of the\nGymnopaedic festival at Lacedaemon, and then fell upon the oligarchs.\nAfter a fight in the city, victory declared for the commons, who slew\nsome of their opponents and banished others. The Lacedaemonians for a\nlong while let the messages of their friends at Argos remain without\neffect. At last they put off the Gymnopaediae and marched to their\nsuccour, but learning at Tegea the defeat of the oligarchs, refused to\ngo any further in spite of the entreaties of those who had escaped,\nand returned home and kept the festival. Later on, envoys arrived with\nmessages from the Argives in the town and from the exiles, when the\nallies were also at Sparta; and after much had been said on both sides,\nthe Lacedaemonians decided that the party in the town had done wrong,\nand resolved to march against Argos, but kept delaying and putting\noff the matter. Meanwhile the commons at Argos, in fear of the\nLacedaemonians, began again to court the Athenian alliance, which they\nwere convinced would be of the greatest service to them; and accordingly\nproceeded to build long walls to the sea, in order that in case of a\nblockade by land; with the help of the Athenians they might have the\nadvantage of importing what they wanted by sea. Some of the cities in\nPeloponnese were also privy to the building of these walls; and the\nArgives with all their people, women and slaves not excepted, addressed\nthemselves to the work, while carpenters and masons came to them from\nAthens.\n\nSummer was now over. The winter following the Lacedaemonians, hearing of\nthe walls that were building, marched against Argos with their allies,\nthe Corinthians excepted, being also not without intelligence in the\ncity itself; Agis, son of Archidamus, their king, was in command. The\nintelligence which they counted upon within the town came to nothing;\nthey however took and razed the walls which were being built, and after\ncapturing the Argive town Hysiae and killing all the freemen that fell\ninto their hands, went back and dispersed every man to his city. After\nthis the Argives marched into Phlius and plundered it for harbouring\ntheir exiles, most of whom had settled there, and so returned home.\nThe same winter the Athenians blockaded Macedonia, on the score of the\nleague entered into by Perdiccas with the Argives and Lacedaemonians,\nand also of his breach of his engagements on the occasion of the\nexpedition prepared by Athens against the Chalcidians in the direction\nof Thrace and against Amphipolis, under the command of Nicias, son of\nNiceratus, which had to be broken up mainly because of his desertion.\nHe was therefore proclaimed an enemy. And thus the winter ended, and the\nfifteenth year of the war ended with it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n_Sixteenth Year of the War--The Melian Conference--Fate of Melos_\n\nThe next summer Alcibiades sailed with twenty ships to Argos and seized\nthe suspected persons still left of the Lacedaemonian faction to the\nnumber of three hundred, whom the Athenians forthwith lodged in the\nneighbouring islands of their empire. The Athenians also made an\nexpedition against the isle of Melos with thirty ships of their own, six\nChian, and two Lesbian vessels, sixteen hundred heavy infantry, three\nhundred archers, and twenty mounted archers from Athens, and about\nfifteen hundred heavy infantry from the allies and the islanders.\nThe Melians are a colony of Lacedaemon that would not submit to the\nAthenians like the other islanders, and at first remained neutral and\ntook no part in the struggle, but afterwards upon the Athenians using\nviolence and plundering their territory, assumed an attitude of open\nhostility. Cleomedes, son of Lycomedes, and Tisias, son of Tisimachus,\nthe generals, encamping in their territory with the above armament,\nbefore doing any harm to their land, sent envoys to negotiate. These the\nMelians did not bring before the people, but bade them state the object\nof their mission to the magistrates and the few; upon which the Athenian\nenvoys spoke as follows:\n\nAthenians. Since the negotiations are not to go on before the people, in\norder that we may not be able to speak straight on without interruption,\nand deceive the ears of the multitude by seductive arguments which would\npass without refutation (for we know that this is the meaning of our\nbeing brought before the few), what if you who sit there were to pursue\na method more cautious still? Make no set speech yourselves, but take\nus up at whatever you do not like, and settle that before going any\nfarther. And first tell us if this proposition of ours suits you.\n\nThe Melian commissioners answered:\n\nMelians. To the fairness of quietly instructing each other as you\npropose there is nothing to object; but your military preparations are\ntoo far advanced to agree with what you say, as we see you are come to\nbe judges in your own cause, and that all we can reasonably expect\nfrom this negotiation is war, if we prove to have right on our side and\nrefuse to submit, and in the contrary case, slavery.\n\nAthenians. If you have met to reason about presentiments of the future,\nor for anything else than to consult for the safety of your state upon\nthe facts that you see before you, we will give over; otherwise we will\ngo on.\n\nMelians. It is natural and excusable for men in our position to turn\nmore ways than one both in thought and utterance. However, the question\nin this conference is, as you say, the safety of our country; and the\ndiscussion, if you please, can proceed in the way which you propose.\n\nAthenians. For ourselves, we shall not trouble you with specious\npretences--either of how we have a right to our empire because we\noverthrew the Mede, or are now attacking you because of wrong that you\nhave done us--and make a long speech which would not be believed; and in\nreturn we hope that you, instead of thinking to influence us by saying\nthat you did not join the Lacedaemonians, although their colonists, or\nthat you have done us no wrong, will aim at what is feasible, holding\nin view the real sentiments of us both; since you know as well as we\ndo that right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in\npower, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they\nmust.\n\nMelians. As we think, at any rate, it is expedient--we speak as we\nare obliged, since you enjoin us to let right alone and talk only of\ninterest--that you should not destroy what is our common protection, the\nprivilege of being allowed in danger to invoke what is fair and right,\nand even to profit by arguments not strictly valid if they can be got\nto pass current. And you are as much interested in this as any, as your\nfall would be a signal for the heaviest vengeance and an example for the\nworld to meditate upon.\n\nAthenians. The end of our empire, if end it should, does not frighten\nus: a rival empire like Lacedaemon, even if Lacedaemon was our real\nantagonist, is not so terrible to the vanquished as subjects who by\nthemselves attack and overpower their rulers. This, however, is a risk\nthat we are content to take. We will now proceed to show you that we are\ncome here in the interest of our empire, and that we shall say what we\nare now going to say, for the preservation of your country; as we\nwould fain exercise that empire over you without trouble, and see you\npreserved for the good of us both.\n\nMelians. And how, pray, could it turn out as good for us to serve as for\nyou to rule?\n\nAthenians. Because you would have the advantage of submitting before\nsuffering the worst, and we should gain by not destroying you.\n\nMelians. So that you would not consent to our being neutral, friends\ninstead of enemies, but allies of neither side.\n\nAthenians. No; for your hostility cannot so much hurt us as your\nfriendship will be an argument to our subjects of our weakness, and your\nenmity of our power.\n\nMelians. Is that your subjects' idea of equity, to put those who have\nnothing to do with you in the same category with peoples that are most\nof them your own colonists, and some conquered rebels?\n\nAthenians. As far as right goes they think one has as much of it as the\nother, and that if any maintain their independence it is because they\nare strong, and that if we do not molest them it is because we are\nafraid; so that besides extending our empire we should gain in security\nby your subjection; the fact that you are islanders and weaker than\nothers rendering it all the more important that you should not succeed\nin baffling the masters of the sea.\n\nMelians. But do you consider that there is no security in the policy\nwhich we indicate? For here again if you debar us from talking about\njustice and invite us to obey your interest, we also must explain ours,\nand try to persuade you, if the two happen to coincide. How can you\navoid making enemies of all existing neutrals who shall look at case\nfrom it that one day or another you will attack them? And what is this\nbut to make greater the enemies that you have already, and to force\nothers to become so who would otherwise have never thought of it?\n\nAthenians. Why, the fact is that continentals generally give us but\nlittle alarm; the liberty which they enjoy will long prevent their\ntaking precautions against us; it is rather islanders like yourselves,\noutside our empire, and subjects smarting under the yoke, who would\nbe the most likely to take a rash step and lead themselves and us into\nobvious danger.\n\nMelians. Well then, if you risk so much to retain your empire, and your\nsubjects to get rid of it, it were surely great baseness and cowardice\nin us who are still free not to try everything that can be tried, before\nsubmitting to your yoke.\n\nAthenians. Not if you are well advised, the contest not being an equal\none, with honour as the prize and shame as the penalty, but a question\nof self-preservation and of not resisting those who are far stronger\nthan you are.\n\nMelians. But we know that the fortune of war is sometimes more impartial\nthan the disproportion of numbers might lead one to suppose; to submit\nis to give ourselves over to despair, while action still preserves for\nus a hope that we may stand erect.\n\nAthenians. Hope, danger's comforter, may be indulged in by those who\nhave abundant resources, if not without loss at all events without ruin;\nbut its nature is to be extravagant, and those who go so far as to put\ntheir all upon the venture see it in its true colours only when they are\nruined; but so long as the discovery would enable them to guard against\nit, it is never found wanting. Let not this be the case with you, who\nare weak and hang on a single turn of the scale; nor be like the vulgar,\nwho, abandoning such security as human means may still afford, when\nvisible hopes fail them in extremity, turn to invisible, to prophecies\nand oracles, and other such inventions that delude men with hopes to\ntheir destruction.\n\nMelians. You may be sure that we are as well aware as you of the\ndifficulty of contending against your power and fortune, unless the\nterms be equal. But we trust that the gods may grant us fortune as good\nas yours, since we are just men fighting against unjust, and that what\nwe want in power will be made up by the alliance of the Lacedaemonians,\nwho are bound, if only for very shame, to come to the aid of their\nkindred. Our confidence, therefore, after all is not so utterly\nirrational.\n\nAthenians. When you speak of the favour of the gods, we may as fairly\nhope for that as yourselves; neither our pretensions nor our conduct\nbeing in any way contrary to what men believe of the gods, or practise\namong themselves. Of the gods we believe, and of men we know, that by a\nnecessary law of their nature they rule wherever they can. And it is not\nas if we were the first to make this law, or to act upon it when made:\nwe found it existing before us, and shall leave it to exist for ever\nafter us; all we do is to make use of it, knowing that you and everybody\nelse, having the same power as we have, would do the same as we do.\nThus, as far as the gods are concerned, we have no fear and no reason to\nfear that we shall be at a disadvantage. But when we come to your notion\nabout the Lacedaemonians, which leads you to believe that shame will\nmake them help you, here we bless your simplicity but do not envy your\nfolly. The Lacedaemonians, when their own interests or their country's\nlaws are in question, are the worthiest men alive; of their conduct\ntowards others much might be said, but no clearer idea of it could be\ngiven than by shortly saying that of all the men we know they are most\nconspicuous in considering what is agreeable honourable, and what is\nexpedient just. Such a way of thinking does not promise much for the\nsafety which you now unreasonably count upon.\n\nMelians. But it is for this very reason that we now trust to their\nrespect for expediency to prevent them from betraying the Melians, their\ncolonists, and thereby losing the confidence of their friends in Hellas\nand helping their enemies.\n\nAthenians. Then you do not adopt the view that expediency goes with\nsecurity, while justice and honour cannot be followed without danger;\nand danger the Lacedaemonians generally court as little as possible.\n\nMelians. But we believe that they would be more likely to face even\ndanger for our sake, and with more confidence than for others, as our\nnearness to Peloponnese makes it easier for them to act, and our common\nblood ensures our fidelity.\n\nAthenians. Yes, but what an intending ally trusts to is not the goodwill\nof those who ask his aid, but a decided superiority of power for action;\nand the Lacedaemonians look to this even more than others. At least,\nsuch is their distrust of their home resources that it is only with\nnumerous allies that they attack a neighbour; now is it likely that\nwhile we are masters of the sea they will cross over to an island?\n\nMelians. But they would have others to send. The Cretan Sea is a wide\none, and it is more difficult for those who command it to intercept\nothers, than for those who wish to elude them to do so safely. And\nshould the Lacedaemonians miscarry in this, they would fall upon your\nland, and upon those left of your allies whom Brasidas did not reach;\nand instead of places which are not yours, you will have to fight for\nyour own country and your own confederacy.\n\nAthenians. Some diversion of the kind you speak of you may one day\nexperience, only to learn, as others have done, that the Athenians never\nonce yet withdrew from a siege for fear of any. But we are struck by\nthe fact that, after saying you would consult for the safety of your\ncountry, in all this discussion you have mentioned nothing which men\nmight trust in and think to be saved by. Your strongest arguments depend\nupon hope and the future, and your actual resources are too scanty, as\ncompared with those arrayed against you, for you to come out victorious.\nYou will therefore show great blindness of judgment, unless, after\nallowing us to retire, you can find some counsel more prudent than this.\nYou will surely not be caught by that idea of disgrace, which in dangers\nthat are disgraceful, and at the same time too plain to be mistaken,\nproves so fatal to mankind; since in too many cases the very men that\nhave their eyes perfectly open to what they are rushing into, let the\nthing called disgrace, by the mere influence of a seductive name, lead\nthem on to a point at which they become so enslaved by the phrase as in\nfact to fall wilfully into hopeless disaster, and incur disgrace more\ndisgraceful as the companion of error, than when it comes as the result\nof misfortune. This, if you are well advised, you will guard against;\nand you will not think it dishonourable to submit to the greatest\ncity in Hellas, when it makes you the moderate offer of becoming its\ntributary ally, without ceasing to enjoy the country that belongs to\nyou; nor when you have the choice given you between war and security,\nwill you be so blinded as to choose the worse. And it is certain that\nthose who do not yield to their equals, who keep terms with their\nsuperiors, and are moderate towards their inferiors, on the whole\nsucceed best. Think over the matter, therefore, after our withdrawal,\nand reflect once and again that it is for your country that you are\nconsulting, that you have not more than one, and that upon this one\ndeliberation depends its prosperity or ruin.\n\nThe Athenians now withdrew from the conference; and the Melians, left\nto themselves, came to a decision corresponding with what they had\nmaintained in the discussion, and answered: \"Our resolution, Athenians,\nis the same as it was at first. We will not in a moment deprive of\nfreedom a city that has been inhabited these seven hundred years; but we\nput our trust in the fortune by which the gods have preserved it until\nnow, and in the help of men, that is, of the Lacedaemonians; and so we\nwill try and save ourselves. Meanwhile we invite you to allow us to be\nfriends to you and foes to neither party, and to retire from our country\nafter making such a treaty as shall seem fit to us both.\"\n\nSuch was the answer of the Melians. The Athenians now departing from the\nconference said: \"Well, you alone, as it seems to us, judging from these\nresolutions, regard what is future as more certain than what is before\nyour eyes, and what is out of sight, in your eagerness, as already\ncoming to pass; and as you have staked most on, and trusted most in,\nthe Lacedaemonians, your fortune, and your hopes, so will you be most\ncompletely deceived.\"\n\nThe Athenian envoys now returned to the army; and the Melians showing\nno signs of yielding, the generals at once betook themselves to\nhostilities, and drew a line of circumvallation round the Melians,\ndividing the work among the different states. Subsequently the Athenians\nreturned with most of their army, leaving behind them a certain number\nof their own citizens and of the allies to keep guard by land and sea.\nThe force thus left stayed on and besieged the place.\n\nAbout the same time the Argives invaded the territory of Phlius and lost\neighty men cut off in an ambush by the Phliasians and Argive exiles.\nMeanwhile the Athenians at Pylos took so much plunder from the\nLacedaemonians that the latter, although they still refrained from\nbreaking off the treaty and going to war with Athens, yet proclaimed\nthat any of their people that chose might plunder the Athenians. The\nCorinthians also commenced hostilities with the Athenians for private\nquarrels of their own; but the rest of the Peloponnesians stayed\nquiet. Meanwhile the Melians attacked by night and took the part of the\nAthenian lines over against the market, and killed some of the men, and\nbrought in corn and all else that they could find useful to them, and\nso returned and kept quiet, while the Athenians took measures to keep\nbetter guard in future.\n\nSummer was now over. The next winter the Lacedaemonians intended to\ninvade the Argive territory, but arriving at the frontier found\nthe sacrifices for crossing unfavourable, and went back again. This\nintention of theirs gave the Argives suspicions of certain of their\nfellow citizens, some of whom they arrested; others, however, escaped\nthem. About the same time the Melians again took another part of\nthe Athenian lines which were but feebly garrisoned. Reinforcements\nafterwards arriving from Athens in consequence, under the command of\nPhilocrates, son of Demeas, the siege was now pressed vigorously;\nand some treachery taking place inside, the Melians surrendered at\ndiscretion to the Athenians, who put to death all the grown men whom\nthey took, and sold the women and children for slaves, and subsequently\nsent out five hundred colonists and inhabited the place themselves.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VI\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n_Seventeenth Year of the War--The Sicilian Campaign--Affair of the\nHermae--Departure of the Expedition_\n\nThe same winter the Athenians resolved to sail again to Sicily, with a\ngreater armament than that under Laches and Eurymedon, and, if possible,\nto conquer the island; most of them being ignorant of its size and of\nthe number of its inhabitants, Hellenic and barbarian, and of the fact\nthat they were undertaking a war not much inferior to that against the\nPeloponnesians. For the voyage round Sicily in a merchantman is not far\nshort of eight days; and yet, large as the island is, there are only two\nmiles of sea to prevent its being mainland.\n\nIt was settled originally as follows, and the peoples that occupied it\nare these. The earliest inhabitants spoken of in any part of the country\nare the Cyclopes and Laestrygones; but I cannot tell of what race\nthey were, or whence they came or whither they went, and must leave my\nreaders to what the poets have said of them and to what may be generally\nknown concerning them. The Sicanians appear to have been the next\nsettlers, although they pretend to have been the first of all and\naborigines; but the facts show that they were Iberians, driven by the\nLigurians from the river Sicanus in Iberia. It was from them that the\nisland, before called Trinacria, took its name of Sicania, and to the\npresent day they inhabit the west of Sicily. On the fall of Ilium, some\nof the Trojans escaped from the Achaeans, came in ships to Sicily, and\nsettled next to the Sicanians under the general name of Elymi; their\ntowns being called Eryx and Egesta. With them settled some of the\nPhocians carried on their way from Troy by a storm, first to Libya, and\nafterwards from thence to Sicily. The Sicels crossed over to Sicily from\ntheir first home Italy, flying from the Opicans, as tradition says and\nas seems not unlikely, upon rafts, having watched till the wind set down\nthe strait to effect the passage; although perhaps they may have sailed\nover in some other way. Even at the present day there are still Sicels\nin Italy; and the country got its name of Italy from Italus, a king of\nthe Sicels, so called. These went with a great host to Sicily, defeated\nthe Sicanians in battle and forced them to remove to the south and west\nof the island, which thus came to be called Sicily instead of Sicania,\nand after they crossed over continued to enjoy the richest parts of the\ncountry for near three hundred years before any Hellenes came to Sicily;\nindeed they still hold the centre and north of the island. There were\nalso Phoenicians living all round Sicily, who had occupied promontories\nupon the sea coasts and the islets adjacent for the purpose of trading\nwith the Sicels. But when the Hellenes began to arrive in considerable\nnumbers by sea, the Phoenicians abandoned most of their stations, and\ndrawing together took up their abode in Motye, Soloeis, and Panormus,\nnear the Elymi, partly because they confided in their alliance, and also\nbecause these are the nearest points for the voyage between Carthage and\nSicily.\n\nThese were the barbarians in Sicily, settled as I have said. Of the\nHellenes, the first to arrive were Chalcidians from Euboea with\nThucles, their founder. They founded Naxos and built the altar to\nApollo Archegetes, which now stands outside the town, and upon which the\ndeputies for the games sacrifice before sailing from Sicily. Syracuse\nwas founded the year afterwards by Archias, one of the Heraclids from\nCorinth, who began by driving out the Sicels from the island upon which\nthe inner city now stands, though it is no longer surrounded by water:\nin process of time the outer town also was taken within the walls and\nbecame populous. Meanwhile Thucles and the Chalcidians set out from\nNaxos in the fifth year after the foundation of Syracuse, and drove\nout the Sicels by arms and founded Leontini and afterwards Catana; the\nCatanians themselves choosing Evarchus as their founder.\n\nAbout the same time Lamis arrived in Sicily with a colony from Megara,\nand after founding a place called Trotilus beyond the river Pantacyas,\nand afterwards leaving it and for a short while joining the Chalcidians\nat Leontini, was driven out by them and founded Thapsus. After his death\nhis companions were driven out of Thapsus, and founded a place called\nthe Hyblaean Megara; Hyblon, a Sicel king, having given up the place and\ninviting them thither. Here they lived two hundred and forty-five years;\nafter which they were expelled from the city and the country by the\nSyracusan tyrant Gelo. Before their expulsion, however, a hundred\nyears after they had settled there, they sent out Pamillus and founded\nSelinus; he having come from their mother country Megara to join them in\nits foundation. Gela was founded by Antiphemus from Rhodes and Entimus\nfrom Crete, who joined in leading a colony thither, in the forty-fifth\nyear after the foundation of Syracuse. The town took its name from the\nriver Gelas, the place where the citadel now stands, and which was first\nfortified, being called Lindii. The institutions which they adopted were\nDorian. Near one hundred and eight years after the foundation of Gela,\nthe Geloans founded Acragas (Agrigentum), so called from the river of\nthat name, and made Aristonous and Pystilus their founders; giving their\nown institutions to the colony. Zancle was originally founded by\npirates from Cuma, the Chalcidian town in the country of the Opicans:\nafterwards, however, large numbers came from Chalcis and the rest of\nEuboea, and helped to people the place; the founders being Perieres and\nCrataemenes from Cuma and Chalcis respectively. It first had the name\nof Zancle given it by the Sicels, because the place is shaped like a\nsickle, which the Sicels call zanclon; but upon the original settlers\nbeing afterwards expelled by some Samians and other Ionians who landed\nin Sicily flying from the Medes, and the Samians in their turn not long\nafterwards by Anaxilas, tyrant of Rhegium, the town was by him colonized\nwith a mixed population, and its name changed to Messina, after his old\ncountry.\n\nHimera was founded from Zancle by Euclides, Simus, and Sacon, most of\nthose who went to the colony being Chalcidians; though they were joined\nby some exiles from Syracuse, defeated in a civil war, called the\nMyletidae. The language was a mixture of Chalcidian and Doric, but the\ninstitutions which prevailed were the Chalcidian. Acrae and Casmenae\nwere founded by the Syracusans; Acrae seventy years after Syracuse,\nCasmenae nearly twenty after Acrae. Camarina was first founded by\nthe Syracusans, close upon a hundred and thirty-five years after the\nbuilding of Syracuse; its founders being Daxon and Menecolus. But\nthe Camarinaeans being expelled by arms by the Syracusans for having\nrevolted, Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela, some time later receiving their\nland in ransom for some Syracusan prisoners, resettled Camarina, himself\nacting as its founder. Lastly, it was again depopulated by Gelo, and\nsettled once more for the third time by the Geloans.\n\nSuch is the list of the peoples, Hellenic and barbarian, inhabiting\nSicily, and such the magnitude of the island which the Athenians were\nnow bent upon invading; being ambitious in real truth of conquering the\nwhole, although they had also the specious design of succouring their\nkindred and other allies in the island. But they were especially incited\nby envoys from Egesta, who had come to Athens and invoked their aid more\nurgently than ever. The Egestaeans had gone to war with their neighbours\nthe Selinuntines upon questions of marriage and disputed territory,\nand the Selinuntines had procured the alliance of the Syracusans, and\npressed Egesta hard by land and sea. The Egestaeans now reminded the\nAthenians of the alliance made in the time of Laches, during the former\nLeontine war, and begged them to send a fleet to their aid, and among a\nnumber of other considerations urged as a capital argument that if\nthe Syracusans were allowed to go unpunished for their depopulation of\nLeontini, to ruin the allies still left to Athens in Sicily, and to get\nthe whole power of the island into their hands, there would be a danger\nof their one day coming with a large force, as Dorians, to the aid\nof their Dorian brethren, and as colonists, to the aid of the\nPeloponnesians who had sent them out, and joining these in pulling down\nthe Athenian empire. The Athenians would, therefore, do well to unite\nwith the allies still left to them, and to make a stand against the\nSyracusans; especially as they, the Egestaeans, were prepared to furnish\nmoney sufficient for the war. The Athenians, hearing these arguments\nconstantly repeated in their assemblies by the Egestaeans and their\nsupporters, voted first to send envoys to Egesta, to see if there was\nreally the money that they talked of in the treasury and temples, and\nat the same time to ascertain in what posture was the war with the\nSelinuntines.\n\nThe envoys of the Athenians were accordingly dispatched to Sicily.\nThe same winter the Lacedaemonians and their allies, the Corinthians\nexcepted, marched into the Argive territory, and ravaged a small part\nof the land, and took some yokes of oxen and carried off some corn. They\nalso settled the Argive exiles at Orneae, and left them a few soldiers\ntaken from the rest of the army; and after making a truce for a certain\nwhile, according to which neither Orneatae nor Argives were to injure\neach other's territory, returned home with the army. Not long afterwards\nthe Athenians came with thirty ships and six hundred heavy infantry, and\nthe Argives joining them with all their forces, marched out and besieged\nthe men in Orneae for one day; but the garrison escaped by night, the\nbesiegers having bivouacked some way off. The next day the Argives,\ndiscovering it, razed Orneae to the ground, and went back again; after\nwhich the Athenians went home in their ships. Meanwhile the Athenians\ntook by sea to Methone on the Macedonian border some cavalry of their\nown and the Macedonian exiles that were at Athens, and plundered the\ncountry of Perdiccas. Upon this the Lacedaemonians sent to the Thracian\nChalcidians, who had a truce with Athens from one ten days to another,\nurging them to join Perdiccas in the war, which they refused to do. And\nthe winter ended, and with it ended the sixteenth year of this war of\nwhich Thucydides is the historian.\n\nEarly in the spring of the following summer the Athenian envoys arrived\nfrom Sicily, and the Egestaeans with them, bringing sixty talents of\nuncoined silver, as a month's pay for sixty ships, which they were to\nask to have sent them. The Athenians held an assembly and, after hearing\nfrom the Egestaeans and their own envoys a report, as attractive as it\nwas untrue, upon the state of affairs generally, and in particular as to\nthe money, of which, it was said, there was abundance in the temples and\nthe treasury, voted to send sixty ships to Sicily, under the command of\nAlcibiades, son of Clinias, Nicias, son of Niceratus, and Lamachus, son\nof Xenophanes, who were appointed with full powers; they were to help\nthe Egestaeans against the Selinuntines, to restore Leontini upon\ngaining any advantage in the war, and to order all other matters in\nSicily as they should deem best for the interests of Athens. Five days\nafter this a second assembly was held, to consider the speediest means\nof equipping the ships, and to vote whatever else might be required by\nthe generals for the expedition; and Nicias, who had been chosen to the\ncommand against his will, and who thought that the state was not well\nadvised, but upon a slight aid specious pretext was aspiring to the\nconquest of the whole of Sicily, a great matter to achieve, came forward\nin the hope of diverting the Athenians from the enterprise, and gave\nthem the following counsel:\n\n\"Although this assembly was convened to consider the preparations to be\nmade for sailing to Sicily, I think, notwithstanding, that we have still\nthis question to examine, whether it be better to send out the ships at\nall, and that we ought not to give so little consideration to a matter\nof such moment, or let ourselves be persuaded by foreigners into\nundertaking a war with which we have nothing to do. And yet,\nindividually, I gain in honour by such a course, and fear as little as\nother men for my person--not that I think a man need be any the worse\ncitizen for taking some thought for his person and estate; on the\ncontrary, such a man would for his own sake desire the prosperity of his\ncountry more than others--nevertheless, as I have never spoken against\nmy convictions to gain honour, I shall not begin to do so now, but shall\nsay what I think best. Against your character any words of mine would be\nweak enough, if I were to advise your keeping what you have got and\nnot risking what is actually yours for advantages which are dubious\nin themselves, and which you may or may not attain. I will, therefore,\ncontent myself with showing that your ardour is out of season, and your\nambition not easy of accomplishment.\n\n\"I affirm, then, that you leave many enemies behind you here to go\nyonder and bring more back with you. You imagine, perhaps, that the\ntreaty which you have made can be trusted; a treaty that will continue\nto exist nominally, as long as you keep quiet--for nominal it has\nbecome, owing to the practices of certain men here and at Sparta--but\nwhich in the event of a serious reverse in any quarter would not delay\nour enemies a moment in attacking us; first, because the convention was\nforced upon them by disaster and was less honourable to them than to us;\nand secondly, because in this very convention there are many points that\nare still disputed. Again, some of the most powerful states have never\nyet accepted the arrangement at all. Some of these are at open war with\nus; others (as the Lacedaemonians do not yet move) are restrained by\ntruces renewed every ten days, and it is only too probable that if they\nfound our power divided, as we are hurrying to divide it, they would\nattack us vigorously with the Siceliots, whose alliance they would\nhave in the past valued as they would that of few others. A man ought,\ntherefore, to consider these points, and not to think of running risks\nwith a country placed so critically, or of grasping at another empire\nbefore we have secured the one we have already; for in fact the Thracian\nChalcidians have been all these years in revolt from us without being\nyet subdued, and others on the continents yield us but a doubtful\nobedience. Meanwhile the Egestaeans, our allies, have been wronged, and\nwe run to help them, while the rebels who have so long wronged us still\nwait for punishment.\n\n\"And yet the latter, if brought under, might be kept under; while the\nSicilians, even if conquered, are too far off and too numerous to be\nruled without difficulty. Now it is folly to go against men who could\nnot be kept under even if conquered, while failure would leave us in\na very different position from that which we occupied before the\nenterprise. The Siceliots, again, to take them as they are at present,\nin the event of a Syracusan conquest (the favourite bugbear of the\nEgestaeans), would to my thinking be even less dangerous to us than\nbefore. At present they might possibly come here as separate states for\nlove of Lacedaemon; in the other case one empire would scarcely attack\nanother; for after joining the Peloponnesians to overthrow ours, they\ncould only expect to see the same hands overthrow their own in the same\nway. The Hellenes in Sicily would fear us most if we never went there at\nall, and next to this, if after displaying our power we went away again\nas soon as possible. We all know that that which is farthest off,\nand the reputation of which can least be tested, is the object of\nadmiration; at the least reverse they would at once begin to look down\nupon us, and would join our enemies here against us. You have yourselves\nexperienced this with regard to the Lacedaemonians and their allies,\nwhom your unexpected success, as compared with what you feared at first,\nhas made you suddenly despise, tempting you further to aspire to\nthe conquest of Sicily. Instead, however, of being puffed up by the\nmisfortunes of your adversaries, you ought to think of breaking their\nspirit before giving yourselves up to confidence, and to understand that\nthe one thought awakened in the Lacedaemonians by their disgrace is how\nthey may even now, if possible, overthrow us and repair their dishonour;\ninasmuch as military reputation is their oldest and chiefest study.\nOur struggle, therefore, if we are wise, will not be for the barbarian\nEgestaeans in Sicily, but how to defend ourselves most effectually\nagainst the oligarchical machinations of Lacedaemon.\n\n\"We should also remember that we are but now enjoying some respite from\na great pestilence and from war, to the no small benefit of our estates\nand persons, and that it is right to employ these at home on our own\nbehalf, instead of using them on behalf of these exiles whose interest\nit is to lie as fairly as they can, who do nothing but talk themselves\nand leave the danger to others, and who if they succeed will show no\nproper gratitude, and if they fail will drag down their friends with\nthem. And if there be any man here, overjoyed at being chosen to\ncommand, who urges you to make the expedition, merely for ends of his\nown--specially if he be still too young to command--who seeks to be\nadmired for his stud of horses, but on account of its heavy expenses\nhopes for some profit from his appointment, do not allow such a one to\nmaintain his private splendour at his country's risk, but remember that\nsuch persons injure the public fortune while they squander their own,\nand that this is a matter of importance, and not for a young man to\ndecide or hastily to take in hand.\n\n\"When I see such persons now sitting here at the side of that same\nindividual and summoned by him, alarm seizes me; and I, in my turn,\nsummon any of the older men that may have such a person sitting next him\nnot to let himself be shamed down, for fear of being thought a coward\nif he do not vote for war, but, remembering how rarely success is got\nby wishing and how often by forecast, to leave to them the mad dream\nof conquest, and as a true lover of his country, now threatened by the\ngreatest danger in its history, to hold up his hand on the other side;\nto vote that the Siceliots be left in the limits now existing between\nus, limits of which no one can complain (the Ionian sea for the coasting\nvoyage, and the Sicilian across the open main), to enjoy their own\npossessions and to settle their own quarrels; that the Egestaeans, for\ntheir part, be told to end by themselves with the Selinuntines the war\nwhich they began without consulting the Athenians; and that for the\nfuture we do not enter into alliance, as we have been used to do, with\npeople whom we must help in their need, and who can never help us in\nours.\n\n\"And you, Prytanis, if you think it your duty to care for the\ncommonwealth, and if you wish to show yourself a good citizen, put\nthe question to the vote, and take a second time the opinions of the\nAthenians. If you are afraid to move the question again, consider that\na violation of the law cannot carry any prejudice with so many abettors,\nthat you will be the physician of your misguided city, and that the\nvirtue of men in office is briefly this, to do their country as much\ngood as they can, or in any case no harm that they can avoid.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Nicias. Most of the Athenians that came forward\nspoke in favour of the expedition, and of not annulling what had\nbeen voted, although some spoke on the other side. By far the warmest\nadvocate of the expedition was, however, Alcibiades, son of Clinias, who\nwished to thwart Nicias both as his political opponent and also because\nof the attack he had made upon him in his speech, and who was, besides,\nexceedingly ambitious of a command by which he hoped to reduce Sicily\nand Carthage, and personally to gain in wealth and reputation by means\nof his successes. For the position he held among the citizens led him\nto indulge his tastes beyond what his real means would bear, both in\nkeeping horses and in the rest of his expenditure; and this later on had\nnot a little to do with the ruin of the Athenian state. Alarmed at the\ngreatness of his licence in his own life and habits, and of the ambition\nwhich he showed in all things soever that he undertook, the mass of\nthe people set him down as a pretender to the tyranny, and became his\nenemies; and although publicly his conduct of the war was as good as\ncould be desired, individually, his habits gave offence to every one,\nand caused them to commit affairs to other hands, and thus before long\nto ruin the city. Meanwhile he now came forward and gave the following\nadvice to the Athenians:\n\n\"Athenians, I have a better right to command than others--I must begin\nwith this as Nicias has attacked me--and at the same time I believe\nmyself to be worthy of it. The things for which I am abused, bring fame\nto my ancestors and to myself, and to the country profit besides. The\nHellenes, after expecting to see our city ruined by the war, concluded\nit to be even greater than it really is, by reason of the magnificence\nwith which I represented it at the Olympic games, when I sent into\nthe lists seven chariots, a number never before entered by any private\nperson, and won the first prize, and was second and fourth, and took\ncare to have everything else in a style worthy of my victory. Custom\nregards such displays as honourable, and they cannot be made without\nleaving behind them an impression of power. Again, any splendour that\nI may have exhibited at home in providing choruses or otherwise, is\nnaturally envied by my fellow citizens, but in the eyes of foreigners\nhas an air of strength as in the other instance. And this is no useless\nfolly, when a man at his own private cost benefits not himself only, but\nhis city: nor is it unfair that he who prides himself on his position\nshould refuse to be upon an equality with the rest. He who is badly off\nhas his misfortunes all to himself, and as we do not see men courted in\nadversity, on the like principle a man ought to accept the insolence of\nprosperity; or else, let him first mete out equal measure to all, and\nthen demand to have it meted out to him. What I know is that persons of\nthis kind and all others that have attained to any distinction, although\nthey may be unpopular in their lifetime in their relations with their\nfellow-men and especially with their equals, leave to posterity the\ndesire of claiming connection with them even without any ground, and\nare vaunted by the country to which they belonged, not as strangers or\nill-doers, but as fellow-countrymen and heroes. Such are my aspirations,\nand however I am abused for them in private, the question is whether\nany one manages public affairs better than I do. Having united the most\npowerful states of Peloponnese, without great danger or expense to you,\nI compelled the Lacedaemonians to stake their all upon the issue of a\nsingle day at Mantinea; and although victorious in the battle, they have\nnever since fully recovered confidence.\n\n\"Thus did my youth and so-called monstrous folly find fitting arguments\nto deal with the power of the Peloponnesians, and by its ardour win\ntheir confidence and prevail. And do not be afraid of my youth now,\nbut while I am still in its flower, and Nicias appears fortunate, avail\nyourselves to the utmost of the services of us both. Neither rescind\nyour resolution to sail to Sicily, on the ground that you would be going\nto attack a great power. The cities in Sicily are peopled by motley\nrabbles, and easily change their institutions and adopt new ones in\ntheir stead; and consequently the inhabitants, being without any feeling\nof patriotism, are not provided with arms for their persons, and have\nnot regularly established themselves on the land; every man thinks that\neither by fair words or by party strife he can obtain something at the\npublic expense, and then in the event of a catastrophe settle in some\nother country, and makes his preparations accordingly. From a mob like\nthis you need not look for either unanimity in counsel or concert in\naction; but they will probably one by one come in as they get a fair\noffer, especially if they are torn by civil strife as we are told.\nMoreover, the Siceliots have not so many heavy infantry as they boast;\njust as the Hellenes generally did not prove so numerous as each state\nreckoned itself, but Hellas greatly over-estimated their numbers, and\nhas hardly had an adequate force of heavy infantry throughout this war.\nThe states in Sicily, therefore, from all that I can hear, will be found\nas I say, and I have not pointed out all our advantages, for we\nshall have the help of many barbarians, who from their hatred of the\nSyracusans will join us in attacking them; nor will the powers at home\nprove any hindrance, if you judge rightly. Our fathers with these very\nadversaries, which it is said we shall now leave behind us when we\nsail, and the Mede as their enemy as well, were able to win the empire,\ndepending solely on their superiority at sea. The Peloponnesians had\nnever so little hope against us as at present; and let them be ever so\nsanguine, although strong enough to invade our country even if we stay\nat home, they can never hurt us with their navy, as we leave one of our\nown behind us that is a match for them.\n\n\"In this state of things what reason can we give to ourselves for\nholding back, or what excuse can we offer to our allies in Sicily for\nnot helping them? They are our confederates, and we are bound to assist\nthem, without objecting that they have not assisted us. We did not take\nthem into alliance to have them to help us in Hellas, but that they\nmight so annoy our enemies in Sicily as to prevent them from coming over\nhere and attacking us. It is thus that empire has been won, both by us\nand by all others that have held it, by a constant readiness to support\nall, whether barbarians or Hellenes, that invite assistance; since if\nall were to keep quiet or to pick and choose whom they ought to assist,\nwe should make but few new conquests, and should imperil those we have\nalready won. Men do not rest content with parrying the attacks of a\nsuperior, but often strike the first blow to prevent the attack being\nmade. And we cannot fix the exact point at which our empire shall\nstop; we have reached a position in which we must not be content with\nretaining but must scheme to extend it, for, if we cease to rule others,\nwe are in danger of being ruled ourselves. Nor can you look at inaction\nfrom the same point of view as others, unless you are prepared to change\nyour habits and make them like theirs.\n\n\"Be convinced, then, that we shall augment our power at home by this\nadventure abroad, and let us make the expedition, and so humble the\npride of the Peloponnesians by sailing off to Sicily, and letting them\nsee how little we care for the peace that we are now enjoying; and at\nthe same time we shall either become masters, as we very easily may, of\nthe whole of Hellas through the accession of the Sicilian Hellenes, or\nin any case ruin the Syracusans, to the no small advantage of ourselves\nand our allies. The faculty of staying if successful, or of returning,\nwill be secured to us by our navy, as we shall be superior at sea to all\nthe Siceliots put together. And do not let the do-nothing policy which\nNicias advocates, or his setting of the young against the old, turn you\nfrom your purpose, but in the good old fashion by which our fathers,\nold and young together, by their united counsels brought our affairs\nto their present height, do you endeavour still to advance them;\nunderstanding that neither youth nor old age can do anything the one\nwithout the other, but that levity, sobriety, and deliberate judgment\nare strongest when united, and that, by sinking into inaction, the city,\nlike everything else, will wear itself out, and its skill in everything\ndecay; while each fresh struggle will give it fresh experience, and\nmake it more used to defend itself not in word but in deed. In short,\nmy conviction is that a city not inactive by nature could not choose a\nquicker way to ruin itself than by suddenly adopting such a policy, and\nthat the safest rule of life is to take one's character and institutions\nfor better and for worse, and to live up to them as closely as one can.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Alcibiades. After hearing him and the Egestaeans\nand some Leontine exiles, who came forward reminding them of their oaths\nand imploring their assistance, the Athenians became more eager for the\nexpedition than before. Nicias, perceiving that it would be now useless\nto try to deter them by the old line of argument, but thinking that\nhe might perhaps alter their resolution by the extravagance of his\nestimates, came forward a second time and spoke as follows:\n\n\"I see, Athenians, that you are thoroughly bent upon the expedition, and\ntherefore hope that all will turn out as we wish, and proceed to give\nyou my opinion at the present juncture. From all that I hear we are\ngoing against cities that are great and not subject to one another, or\nin need of change, so as to be glad to pass from enforced servitude\nto an easier condition, or in the least likely to accept our rule in\nexchange for freedom; and, to take only the Hellenic towns, they are\nvery numerous for one island. Besides Naxos and Catana, which I expect\nto join us from their connection with Leontini, there are seven others\narmed at all points just like our own power, particularly Selinus and\nSyracuse, the chief objects of our expedition. These are full of heavy\ninfantry, archers, and darters, have galleys in abundance and crowds to\nman them; they have also money, partly in the hands of private persons,\npartly in the temples at Selinus, and at Syracuse first-fruits from some\nof the barbarians as well. But their chief advantage over us lies in\nthe number of their horses, and in the fact that they grow their corn at\nhome instead of importing it.\n\n\"Against a power of this kind it will not do to have merely a weak naval\narmament, but we shall want also a large land army to sail with us, if\nwe are to do anything worthy of our ambition, and are not to be shut out\nfrom the country by a numerous cavalry; especially if the cities should\ntake alarm and combine, and we should be left without friends (except\nthe Egestaeans) to furnish us with horse to defend ourselves with. It\nwould be disgraceful to have to retire under compulsion, or to send\nback for reinforcements, owing to want of reflection at first: we must\ntherefore start from home with a competent force, seeing that we are\ngoing to sail far from our country, and upon an expedition not like any\nwhich you may undertaken undertaken the quality of allies, among your\nsubject states here in Hellas, where any additional supplies needed were\neasily drawn from the friendly territory; but we are cutting ourselves\noff, and going to a land entirely strange, from which during four months\nin winter it is not even easy for a messenger get to Athens.\n\n\"I think, therefore, that we ought to take great numbers of heavy\ninfantry, both from Athens and from our allies, and not merely from our\nsubjects, but also any we may be able to get for love or for money in\nPeloponnese, and great numbers also of archers and slingers, to make\nhead against the Sicilian horse. Meanwhile we must have an overwhelming\nsuperiority at sea, to enable us the more easily to carry in what we\nwant; and we must take our own corn in merchant vessels, that is to say,\nwheat and parched barley, and bakers from the mills compelled to serve\nfor pay in the proper proportion; in order that in case of our being\nweather-bound the armament may not want provisions, as it is not every\ncity that will be able to entertain numbers like ours. We must also\nprovide ourselves with everything else as far as we can, so as not to be\ndependent upon others; and above all we must take with us from home as\nmuch money as possible, as the sums talked of as ready at Egesta are\nreadier, you may be sure, in talk than in any other way.\n\n\"Indeed, even if we leave Athens with a force not only equal to that of\nthe enemy except in the number of heavy infantry in the field, but\neven at all points superior to him, we shall still find it difficult to\nconquer Sicily or save ourselves. We must not disguise from ourselves\nthat we go to found a city among strangers and enemies, and that he who\nundertakes such an enterprise should be prepared to become master of the\ncountry the first day he lands, or failing in this to find everything\nhostile to him. Fearing this, and knowing that we shall have need of\nmuch good counsel and more good fortune--a hard matter for mortal man to\naspire to--I wish as far as may be to make myself independent of fortune\nbefore sailing, and when I do sail, to be as safe as a strong force\ncan make me. This I believe to be surest for the country at large,\nand safest for us who are to go on the expedition. If any one thinks\ndifferently I resign to him my command.\"\n\nWith this Nicias concluded, thinking that he should either disgust the\nAthenians by the magnitude of the undertaking, or, if obliged to sail\non the expedition, would thus do so in the safest way possible. The\nAthenians, however, far from having their taste for the voyage taken\naway by the burdensomeness of the preparations, became more eager for it\nthan ever; and just the contrary took place of what Nicias had thought,\nas it was held that he had given good advice, and that the expedition\nwould be the safest in the world. All alike fell in love with the\nenterprise. The older men thought that they would either subdue the\nplaces against which they were to sail, or at all events, with so\nlarge a force, meet with no disaster; those in the prime of life felt\na longing for foreign sights and spectacles, and had no doubt that they\nshould come safe home again; while the idea of the common people and the\nsoldiery was to earn wages at the moment, and make conquests that would\nsupply a never-ending fund of pay for the future. With this enthusiasm\nof the majority, the few that liked it not, feared to appear unpatriotic\nby holding up their hands against it, and so kept quiet.\n\nAt last one of the Athenians came forward and called upon Nicias and\ntold him that he ought not to make excuses or put them off, but say at\nonce before them all what forces the Athenians should vote him. Upon\nthis he said, not without reluctance, that he would advise upon that\nmatter more at leisure with his colleagues; as far however as he could\nsee at present, they must sail with at least one hundred galleys--the\nAthenians providing as many transports as they might determine, and\nsending for others from the allies--not less than five thousand heavy\ninfantry in all, Athenian and allied, and if possible more; and the rest\nof the armament in proportion; archers from home and from Crete, and\nslingers, and whatever else might seem desirable, being got ready by the\ngenerals and taken with them.\n\nUpon hearing this the Athenians at once voted that the generals should\nhave full powers in the matter of the numbers of the army and of the\nexpedition generally, to do as they judged best for the interests of\nAthens. After this the preparations began; messages being sent to\nthe allies and the rolls drawn up at home. And as the city had just\nrecovered from the plague and the long war, and a number of young\nmen had grown up and capital had accumulated by reason of the truce,\neverything was the more easily provided.\n\nIn the midst of these preparations all the stone Hermae in the city of\nAthens, that is to say the customary square figures, so common in the\ndoorways of private houses and temples, had in one night most of them\ntheir fares mutilated. No one knew who had done it, but large public\nrewards were offered to find the authors; and it was further voted\nthat any one who knew of any other act of impiety having been committed\nshould come and give information without fear of consequences, whether\nhe were citizen, alien, or slave. The matter was taken up the more\nseriously, as it was thought to be ominous for the expedition, and part\nof a conspiracy to bring about a revolution and to upset the democracy.\n\nInformation was given accordingly by some resident aliens and body\nservants, not about the Hermae but about some previous mutilations of\nother images perpetrated by young men in a drunken frolic, and of mock\ncelebrations of the mysteries, averred to take place in private houses.\nAlcibiades being implicated in this charge, it was taken hold of by\nthose who could least endure him, because he stood in the way of their\nobtaining the undisturbed direction of the people, and who thought\nthat if he were once removed the first place would be theirs. These\naccordingly magnified the matter and loudly proclaimed that the affair\nof the mysteries and the mutilation of the Hermae were part and parcel\nof a scheme to overthrow the democracy, and that nothing of all this had\nbeen done without Alcibiades; the proofs alleged being the general and\nundemocratic licence of his life and habits.\n\nAlcibiades repelled on the spot the charges in question, and also before\ngoing on the expedition, the preparations for which were now complete,\noffered to stand his trial, that it might be seen whether he was guilty\nof the acts imputed to him; desiring to be punished if found guilty,\nbut, if acquitted, to take the command. Meanwhile he protested against\ntheir receiving slanders against him in his absence, and begged them\nrather to put him to death at once if he were guilty, and pointed out\nthe imprudence of sending him out at the head of so large an army, with\nso serious a charge still undecided. But his enemies feared that he\nwould have the army for him if he were tried immediately, and that the\npeople might relent in favour of the man whom they already caressed\nas the cause of the Argives and some of the Mantineans joining in the\nexpedition, and did their utmost to get this proposition rejected,\nputting forward other orators who said that he ought at present to sail\nand not delay the departure of the army, and be tried on his return\nwithin a fixed number of days; their plan being to have him sent for\nand brought home for trial upon some graver charge, which they would the\nmore easily get up in his absence. Accordingly it was decreed that he\nshould sail.\n\nAfter this the departure for Sicily took place, it being now about\nmidsummer. Most of the allies, with the corn transports and the smaller\ncraft and the rest of the expedition, had already received orders to\nmuster at Corcyra, to cross the Ionian Sea from thence in a body to the\nIapygian promontory. But the Athenians themselves, and such of their\nallies as happened to be with them, went down to Piraeus upon a day\nappointed at daybreak, and began to man the ships for putting out to\nsea. With them also went down the whole population, one may say, of the\ncity, both citizens and foreigners; the inhabitants of the country each\nescorting those that belonged to them, their friends, their relatives,\nor their sons, with hope and lamentation upon their way, as they thought\nof the conquests which they hoped to make, or of the friends whom they\nmight never see again, considering the long voyage which they were going\nto make from their country. Indeed, at this moment, when they were now\nupon the point of parting from one another, the danger came more home to\nthem than when they voted for the expedition; although the strength of\nthe armament, and the profuse provision which they remarked in every\ndepartment, was a sight that could not but comfort them. As for the\nforeigners and the rest of the crowd, they simply went to see a sight\nworth looking at and passing all belief.\n\nIndeed this armament that first sailed out was by far the most costly\nand splendid Hellenic force that had ever been sent out by a single city\nup to that time. In mere number of ships and heavy infantry that against\nEpidaurus under Pericles, and the same when going against Potidaea under\nHagnon, was not inferior; containing as it did four thousand Athenian\nheavy infantry, three hundred horse, and one hundred galleys accompanied\nby fifty Lesbian and Chian vessels and many allies besides. But these\nwere sent upon a short voyage and with a scanty equipment. The present\nexpedition was formed in contemplation of a long term of service by land\nand sea alike, and was furnished with ships and troops so as to be ready\nfor either as required. The fleet had been elaborately equipped at great\ncost to the captains and the state; the treasury giving a drachma a day\nto each seaman, and providing empty ships, sixty men-of-war and forty\ntransports, and manning these with the best crews obtainable; while the\ncaptains gave a bounty in addition to the pay from the treasury to\nthe thranitae and crews generally, besides spending lavishly upon\nfigure-heads and equipments, and one and all making the utmost exertions\nto enable their own ships to excel in beauty and fast sailing. Meanwhile\nthe land forces had been picked from the best muster-rolls, and vied\nwith each other in paying great attention to their arms and personal\naccoutrements. From this resulted not only a rivalry among themselves in\ntheir different departments, but an idea among the rest of the Hellenes\nthat it was more a display of power and resources than an armament\nagainst an enemy. For if any one had counted up the public expenditure\nof the state, and the private outlay of individuals--that is to say,\nthe sums which the state had already spent upon the expedition and was\nsending out in the hands of the generals, and those which individuals\nhad expended upon their personal outfit, or as captains of galleys had\nlaid out and were still to lay out upon their vessels; and if he had\nadded to this the journey money which each was likely to have provided\nhimself with, independently of the pay from the treasury, for a voyage\nof such length, and what the soldiers or traders took with them for the\npurpose of exchange--it would have been found that many talents in all\nwere being taken out of the city. Indeed the expedition became not\nless famous for its wonderful boldness and for the splendour of its\nappearance, than for its overwhelming strength as compared with the\npeoples against whom it was directed, and for the fact that this was the\nlongest passage from home hitherto attempted, and the most ambitious in\nits objects considering the resources of those who undertook it.\n\nThe ships being now manned, and everything put on board with which they\nmeant to sail, the trumpet commanded silence, and the prayers customary\nbefore putting out to sea were offered, not in each ship by itself, but\nby all together to the voice of a herald; and bowls of wine were mixed\nthrough all the armament, and libations made by the soldiers and their\nofficers in gold and silver goblets. In their prayers joined also the\ncrowds on shore, the citizens and all others that wished them well. The\nhymn sung and the libations finished, they put out to sea, and first\nout in column then raced each other as far as Aegina, and so hastened to\nreach Corcyra, where the rest of the allied forces were also assembling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n_Seventeenth Year of the War--Parties at Syracuse--Story of Harmodius\nand Aristogiton--Disgrace of Alcibiades_\n\nMeanwhile at Syracuse news came in from many quarters of the expedition,\nbut for a long while met with no credence whatever. Indeed, an assembly\nwas held in which speeches, as will be seen, were delivered by\ndifferent orators, believing or contradicting the report of the Athenian\nexpedition; among whom Hermocrates, son of Hermon, came forward, being\npersuaded that he knew the truth of the matter, and gave the following\ncounsel:\n\n\"Although I shall perhaps be no better believed than others have been\nwhen I speak upon the reality of the expedition, and although I know\nthat those who either make or repeat statements thought not worthy of\nbelief not only gain no converts but are thought fools for their pains,\nI shall certainly not be frightened into holding my tongue when the\nstate is in danger, and when I am persuaded that I can speak with more\nauthority on the matter than other persons. Much as you wonder at it,\nthe Athenians nevertheless have set out against us with a large force,\nnaval and military, professedly to help the Egestaeans and to restore\nLeontini, but really to conquer Sicily, and above all our city, which\nonce gained, the rest, they think, will easily follow. Make up your\nminds, therefore, to see them speedily here, and see how you can best\nrepel them with the means under your hand, and do be taken off your\nguard through despising the news, or neglect the common weal through\ndisbelieving it. Meanwhile those who believe me need not be dismayed at\nthe force or daring of the enemy. They will not be able to do us more\nhurt than we shall do them; nor is the greatness of their armament\naltogether without advantage to us. Indeed, the greater it is the\nbetter, with regard to the rest of the Siceliots, whom dismay will make\nmore ready to join us; and if we defeat or drive them away, disappointed\nof the objects of their ambition (for I do not fear for a moment that\nthey will get what they want), it will be a most glorious exploit for\nus, and in my judgment by no means an unlikely one. Few indeed have been\nthe large armaments, either Hellenic or barbarian, that have gone far\nfrom home and been successful. They cannot be more numerous than the\npeople of the country and their neighbours, all of whom fear leagues\ntogether; and if they miscarry for want of supplies in a foreign land,\nto those against whom their plans were laid none the less they leave\nrenown, although they may themselves have been the main cause of their\nown discomfort. Thus these very Athenians rose by the defeat of the\nMede, in a great measure due to accidental causes, from the mere fact\nthat Athens had been the object of his attack; and this may very well be\nthe case with us also.\n\n\"Let us, therefore, confidently begin preparations here; let us send and\nconfirm some of the Sicels, and obtain the friendship and alliance\nof others, and dispatch envoys to the rest of Sicily to show that the\ndanger is common to all, and to Italy to get them to become our allies,\nor at all events to refuse to receive the Athenians. I also think that\nit would be best to send to Carthage as well; they are by no means there\nwithout apprehension, but it is their constant fear that the Athenians\nmay one day attack their city, and they may perhaps think that they\nmight themselves suffer by letting Sicily be sacrificed, and be willing\nto help us secretly if not openly, in one way if not in another. They\nare the best able to do so, if they will, of any of the present day, as\nthey possess most gold and silver, by which war, like everything else,\nflourishes. Let us also send to Lacedaemon and Corinth, and ask them to\ncome here and help us as soon as possible, and to keep alive the war in\nHellas. But the true thing of all others, in my opinion, to do at the\npresent moment, is what you, with your constitutional love of quiet,\nwill be slow to see, and what I must nevertheless mention. If we\nSiceliots, all together, or at least as many as possible besides\nourselves, would only launch the whole of our actual navy with two\nmonths' provisions, and meet the Athenians at Tarentum and the Iapygian\npromontory, and show them that before fighting for Sicily they must\nfirst fight for their passage across the Ionian Sea, we should strike\ndismay into their army, and set them on thinking that we have a base for\nour defensive--for Tarentum is ready to receive us--while they have a\nwide sea to cross with all their armament, which could with difficulty\nkeep its order through so long a voyage, and would be easy for us to\nattack as it came on slowly and in small detachments. On the other hand,\nif they were to lighten their vessels, and draw together their fast\nsailers and with these attack us, we could either fall upon them when\nthey were wearied with rowing, or if we did not choose to do so, we\ncould retire to Tarentum; while they, having crossed with few provisions\njust to give battle, would be hard put to it in desolate places, and\nwould either have to remain and be blockaded, or to try to sail along\nthe coast, abandoning the rest of their armament, and being further\ndiscouraged by not knowing for certain whether the cities would receive\nthem. In my opinion this consideration alone would be sufficient to\ndeter them from putting out from Corcyra; and what with deliberating and\nreconnoitring our numbers and whereabouts, they would let the season\ngo on until winter was upon them, or, confounded by so unexpected a\ncircumstance, would break up the expedition, especially as their most\nexperienced general has, as I hear, taken the command against his will,\nand would grasp at the first excuse offered by any serious demonstration\nof ours. We should also be reported, I am certain, as more numerous\nthan we really are, and men's minds are affected by what they hear,\nand besides the first to attack, or to show that they mean to defend\nthemselves against an attack, inspire greater fear because men see that\nthey are ready for the emergency. This would just be the case with the\nAthenians at present. They are now attacking us in the belief that we\nshall not resist, having a right to judge us severely because we did\nnot help the Lacedaemonians in crushing them; but if they were to see\nus showing a courage for which they are not prepared, they would be more\ndismayed by the surprise than they could ever be by our actual power. I\ncould wish to persuade you to show this courage; but if this cannot be,\nat all events lose not a moment in preparing generally for the war;\nand remember all of you that contempt for an assailant is best shown by\nbravery in action, but that for the present the best course is to accept\nthe preparations which fear inspires as giving the surest promise of\nsafety, and to act as if the danger was real. That the Athenians are\ncoming to attack us, and are already upon the voyage, and all but\nhere--this is what I am sure of.\"\n\nThus far spoke Hermocrates. Meanwhile the people of Syracuse were at\ngreat strife among themselves; some contending that the Athenians had no\nidea of coming and that there was no truth in what he said; some asking\nif they did come what harm they could do that would not be repaid them\ntenfold in return; while others made light of the whole affair and\nturned it into ridicule. In short, there were few that believed\nHermocrates and feared for the future. Meanwhile Athenagoras, the leader\nof the people and very powerful at that time with the masses, came\nforward and spoke as follows:\n\n\"For the Athenians, he who does not wish that they may be as misguided\nas they are supposed to be, and that they may come here to become our\nsubjects, is either a coward or a traitor to his country; while as for\nthose who carry such tidings and fill you with so much alarm, I wonder\nless at their audacity than at their folly if they flatter themselves\nthat we do not see through them. The fact is that they have their\nprivate reasons to be afraid, and wish to throw the city into\nconsternation to have their own terrors cast into the shade by the\npublic alarm. In short, this is what these reports are worth; they do\nnot arise of themselves, but are concocted by men who are always causing\nagitation here in Sicily. However, if you are well advised, you will\nnot be guided in your calculation of probabilities by what these persons\ntell you, but by what shrewd men and of large experience, as I esteem\nthe Athenians to be, would be likely to do. Now it is not likely that\nthey would leave the Peloponnesians behind them, and before they have\nwell ended the war in Hellas wantonly come in quest of a new war quite\nas arduous in Sicily; indeed, in my judgment, they are only too glad\nthat we do not go and attack them, being so many and so great cities as\nwe are.\n\n\"However, if they should come as is reported, I consider Sicily better\nable to go through with the war than Peloponnese, as being at all points\nbetter prepared, and our city by itself far more than a match for this\npretended army of invasion, even were it twice as large again. I know\nthat they will not have horses with them, or get any here, except a\nfew perhaps from the Egestaeans; or be able to bring a force of heavy\ninfantry equal in number to our own, in ships which will already have\nenough to do to come all this distance, however lightly laden, not to\nspeak of the transport of the other stores required against a city of\nthis magnitude, which will be no slight quantity. In fact, so strong is\nmy opinion upon the subject, that I do not well see how they could\navoid annihilation if they brought with them another city as large as\nSyracuse, and settled down and carried on war from our frontier; much\nless can they hope to succeed with all Sicily hostile to them, as\nall Sicily will be, and with only a camp pitched from the ships, and\ncomposed of tents and bare necessaries, from which they would not be\nable to stir far for fear of our cavalry.\n\n\"But the Athenians see this as I tell you, and as I have reason to know\nare looking after their possessions at home, while persons here invent\nstories that neither are true nor ever will be. Nor is this the first\ntime that I see these persons, when they cannot resort to deeds, trying\nby such stories and by others even more abominable to frighten your\npeople and get into their hands the government: it is what I see always.\nAnd I cannot help fearing that trying so often they may one day succeed,\nand that we, as long as we do not feel the smart, may prove too weak for\nthe task of prevention, or, when the offenders are known, of pursuit.\nThe result is that our city is rarely at rest, but is subject to\nconstant troubles and to contests as frequent against herself as against\nthe enemy, not to speak of occasional tyrannies and infamous cabals.\nHowever, I will try, if you will support me, to let nothing of this\nhappen in our time, by gaining you, the many, and by chastising the\nauthors of such machinations, not merely when they are caught in the\nact--a difficult feat to accomplish--but also for what they have the\nwish though not the power to do; as it is necessary to punish an enemy\nnot only for what he does, but also beforehand for what he intends to\ndo, if the first to relax precaution would not be also the first to\nsuffer. I shall also reprove, watch, and on occasion warn the few--the\nmost effectual way, in my opinion, of turning them from their evil\ncourses. And after all, as I have often asked, what would you have,\nyoung men? Would you hold office at once? The law forbids it, a law\nenacted rather because you are not competent than to disgrace you when\ncompetent. Meanwhile you would not be on a legal equality with the many!\nBut how can it be right that citizens of the same state should be held\nunworthy of the same privileges?\n\n\"It will be said, perhaps, that democracy is neither wise nor equitable,\nbut that the holders of property are also the best fitted to rule. I\nsay, on the contrary, first, that the word demos, or people, includes\nthe whole state, oligarchy only a part; next, that if the best guardians\nof property are the rich, and the best counsellors the wise, none\ncan hear and decide so well as the many; and that all these talents,\nseverally and collectively, have their just place in a democracy. But an\noligarchy gives the many their share of the danger, and not content with\nthe largest part takes and keeps the whole of the profit; and this is\nwhat the powerful and young among you aspire to, but in a great city\ncannot possibly obtain.\n\n\"But even now, foolish men, most senseless of all the Hellenes that I\nknow, if you have no sense of the wickedness of your designs, or most\ncriminal if you have that sense and still dare to pursue them--even now,\nif it is not a case for repentance, you may still learn wisdom, and\nthus advance the interest of the country, the common interest of us all.\nReflect that in the country's prosperity the men of merit in your ranks\nwill have a share and a larger share than the great mass of your fellow\ncountrymen, but that if you have other designs you run a risk of being\ndeprived of all; and desist from reports like these, as the people know\nyour object and will not put up with it. If the Athenians arrive, this\ncity will repulse them in a manner worthy of itself; we have moreover,\ngenerals who will see to this matter. And if nothing of this be true, as\nI incline to believe, the city will not be thrown into a panic by your\nintelligence, or impose upon itself a self-chosen servitude by choosing\nyou for its rulers; the city itself will look into the matter, and will\njudge your words as if they were acts, and, instead of allowing itself\nto be deprived of its liberty by listening to you, will strive to\npreserve that liberty, by taking care to have always at hand the means\nof making itself respected.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Athenagoras. One of the generals now stood up and\nstopped any other speakers coming forward, adding these words of his own\nwith reference to the matter in hand: \"It is not well for speakers to\nutter calumnies against one another, or for their hearers to entertain\nthem; we ought rather to look to the intelligence that we have received,\nand see how each man by himself and the city as a whole may best prepare\nto repel the invaders. Even if there be no need, there is no harm in\nthe state being furnished with horses and arms and all other insignia of\nwar; and we will undertake to see to and order this, and to send round\nto the cities to reconnoitre and do all else that may appear desirable.\nPart of this we have seen to already, and whatever we discover shall\nbe laid before you.\" After these words from the general, the Syracusans\ndeparted from the assembly.\n\nIn the meantime the Athenians with all their allies had now arrived at\nCorcyra. Here the generals began by again reviewing the armament, and\nmade arrangements as to the order in which they were to anchor and\nencamp, and dividing the whole fleet into three divisions, allotted one\nto each of their number, to avoid sailing all together and being thus\nembarrassed for water, harbourage, or provisions at the stations which\nthey might touch at, and at the same time to be generally better ordered\nand easier to handle, by each squadron having its own commander. Next\nthey sent on three ships to Italy and Sicily to find out which of the\ncities would receive them, with instructions to meet them on the way and\nlet them know before they put in to land.\n\nAfter this the Athenians weighed from Corcyra, and proceeded to cross\nto Sicily with an armament now consisting of one hundred and thirty-four\ngalleys in all (besides two Rhodian fifty-oars), of which one hundred\nwere Athenian vessels--sixty men-of-war, and forty troopships--and the\nremainder from Chios and the other allies; five thousand and one hundred\nheavy infantry in all, that is to say, fifteen hundred Athenian citizens\nfrom the rolls at Athens and seven hundred Thetes shipped as marines,\nand the rest allied troops, some of them Athenian subjects, and besides\nthese five hundred Argives, and two hundred and fifty Mantineans serving\nfor hire; four hundred and eighty archers in all, eighty of whom were\nCretans, seven hundred slingers from Rhodes, one hundred and twenty\nlight-armed exiles from Megara, and one horse-transport carrying thirty\nhorses.\n\nSuch was the strength of the first armament that sailed over for the\nwar. The supplies for this force were carried by thirty ships of\nburden laden with corn, which conveyed the bakers, stone-masons, and\ncarpenters, and the tools for raising fortifications, accompanied by one\nhundred boats, like the former pressed into the service, besides many\nother boats and ships of burden which followed the armament voluntarily\nfor purposes of trade; all of which now left Corcyra and struck across\nthe Ionian Sea together. The whole force making land at the Iapygian\npromontory and Tarentum, with more or less good fortune, coasted along\nthe shores of Italy, the cities shutting their markets and gates against\nthem, and according them nothing but water and liberty to anchor, and\nTarentum and Locri not even that, until they arrived at Rhegium, the\nextreme point of Italy. Here at length they reunited, and not gaining\nadmission within the walls pitched a camp outside the city in the\nprecinct of Artemis, where a market was also provided for them, and drew\ntheir ships on shore and kept quiet. Meanwhile they opened negotiations\nwith the Rhegians, and called upon them as Chalcidians to assist their\nLeontine kinsmen; to which the Rhegians replied that they would not\nside with either party, but should await the decision of the rest of\nthe Italiots, and do as they did. Upon this the Athenians now began to\nconsider what would be the best action to take in the affairs of Sicily,\nand meanwhile waited for the ships sent on to come back from Egesta, in\norder to know whether there was really there the money mentioned by the\nmessengers at Athens.\n\nIn the meantime came in from all quarters to the Syracusans, as well as\nfrom their own officers sent to reconnoitre, the positive tidings that\nthe fleet was at Rhegium; upon which they laid aside their incredulity\nand threw themselves heart and soul into the work of preparation.\nGuards or envoys, as the case might be, were sent round to the Sicels,\ngarrisons put into the posts of the Peripoli in the country, horses and\narms reviewed in the city to see that nothing was wanting, and all other\nsteps taken to prepare for a war which might be upon them at any moment.\n\nMeanwhile the three ships that had been sent on came from Egesta to the\nAthenians at Rhegium, with the news that so far from there being the\nsums promised, all that could be produced was thirty talents. The\ngenerals were not a little disheartened at being thus disappointed\nat the outset, and by the refusal to join in the expedition of the\nRhegians, the people they had first tried to gain and had had had most\nreason to count upon, from their relationship to the Leontines and\nconstant friendship for Athens. If Nicias was prepared for the news\nfrom Egesta, his two colleagues were taken completely by surprise. The\nEgestaeans had had recourse to the following stratagem, when the first\nenvoys from Athens came to inspect their resources. They took the envoys\nin question to the temple of Aphrodite at Eryx and showed them the\ntreasures deposited there: bowls, wine-ladles, censers, and a large\nnumber of other pieces of plate, which from being in silver gave an\nimpression of wealth quite out of proportion to their really small\nvalue. They also privately entertained the ships' crews, and collected\nall the cups of gold and silver that they could find in Egesta itself or\ncould borrow in the neighbouring Phoenician and Hellenic towns, and each\nbrought them to the banquets as their own; and as all used pretty nearly\nthe same, and everywhere a great quantity of plate was shown, the effect\nwas most dazzling upon the Athenian sailors, and made them talk loudly\nof the riches they had seen when they got back to Athens. The dupes in\nquestion--who had in their turn persuaded the rest--when the news got\nabroad that there was not the money supposed at Egesta, were much blamed\nby the soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile the generals consulted upon what was to be done. The opinion\nof Nicias was to sail with all the armament to Selinus, the main object\nof the expedition, and if the Egestaeans could provide money for the\nwhole force, to advise accordingly; but if they could not, to require\nthem to supply provisions for the sixty ships that they had asked for,\nto stay and settle matters between them and the Selinuntines either\nby force or by agreement, and then to coast past the other cities, and\nafter displaying the power of Athens and proving their zeal for their\nfriends and allies, to sail home again (unless they should have some\nsudden and unexpected opportunity of serving the Leontines, or of\nbringing over some of the other cities), and not to endanger the state\nby wasting its home resources.\n\nAlcibiades said that a great expedition like the present must not\ndisgrace itself by going away without having done anything; heralds must\nbe sent to all the cities except Selinus and Syracuse, and efforts\nbe made to make some of the Sicels revolt from the Syracusans, and to\nobtain the friendship of others, in order to have corn and troops; and\nfirst of all to gain the Messinese, who lay right in the passage and\nentrance to Sicily, and would afford an excellent harbour and base for\nthe army. Thus, after bringing over the towns and knowing who would\nbe their allies in the war, they might at length attack Syracuse and\nSelinus; unless the latter came to terms with Egesta and the former\nceased to oppose the restoration of Leontini.\n\nLamachus, on the other hand, said that they ought to sail straight to\nSyracuse, and fight their battle at once under the walls of the town\nwhile the people were still unprepared, and the panic at its height.\nEvery armament was most terrible at first; if it allowed time to run on\nwithout showing itself, men's courage revived, and they saw it appear\nat last almost with indifference. By attacking suddenly, while Syracuse\nstill trembled at their coming, they would have the best chance of\ngaining a victory for themselves and of striking a complete panic into\nthe enemy by the aspect of their numbers--which would never appear so\nconsiderable as at present--by the anticipation of coming disaster, and\nabove all by the immediate danger of the engagement. They might also\ncount upon surprising many in the fields outside, incredulous of their\ncoming; and at the moment that the enemy was carrying in his property\nthe army would not want for booty if it sat down in force before the\ncity. The rest of the Siceliots would thus be immediately less\ndisposed to enter into alliance with the Syracusans, and would join the\nAthenians, without waiting to see which were the strongest. They must\nmake Megara their naval station as a place to retreat to and a base from\nwhich to attack: it was an uninhabited place at no great distance from\nSyracuse either by land or by sea.\n\nAfter speaking to this effect, Lamachus nevertheless gave his support\nto the opinion of Alcibiades. After this Alcibiades sailed in his own\nvessel across to Messina with proposals of alliance, but met with no\nsuccess, the inhabitants answering that they could not receive him\nwithin their walls, though they would provide him with a market outside.\nUpon this he sailed back to Rhegium. Immediately upon his return the\ngenerals manned and victualled sixty ships out of the whole fleet and\ncoasted along to Naxos, leaving the rest of the armament behind them\nat Rhegium with one of their number. Received by the Naxians, they then\ncoasted on to Catana, and being refused admittance by the inhabitants,\nthere being a Syracusan party in the town, went on to the river Terias.\nHere they bivouacked, and the next day sailed in single file to Syracuse\nwith all their ships except ten which they sent on in front to sail\ninto the great harbour and see if there was any fleet launched, and\nto proclaim by herald from shipboard that the Athenians were come\nto restore the Leontines to their country, as being their allies and\nkinsmen, and that such of them, therefore, as were in Syracuse should\nleave it without fear and join their friends and benefactors the\nAthenians. After making this proclamation and reconnoitring the city and\nthe harbours, and the features of the country which they would have to\nmake their base of operations in the war, they sailed back to Catana.\n\nAn assembly being held here, the inhabitants refused to receive the\narmament, but invited the generals to come in and say what they desired;\nand while Alcibiades was speaking and the citizens were intent on the\nassembly, the soldiers broke down an ill-walled-up postern gate\nwithout being observed, and getting inside the town, flocked into the\nmarketplace. The Syracusan party in the town no sooner saw the army\ninside than they became frightened and withdrew, not being at all\nnumerous; while the rest voted for an alliance with the Athenians and\ninvited them to fetch the rest of their forces from Rhegium. After this\nthe Athenians sailed to Rhegium, and put off, this time with all the\narmament, for Catana, and fell to work at their camp immediately upon\ntheir arrival.\n\nMeanwhile word was brought them from Camarina that if they went there\nthe town would go over to them, and also that the Syracusans were\nmanning a fleet. The Athenians accordingly sailed alongshore with all\ntheir armament, first to Syracuse, where they found no fleet manning,\nand so always along the coast to Camarina, where they brought to at the\nbeach, and sent a herald to the people, who, however, refused to receive\nthem, saying that their oaths bound them to receive the Athenians only\nwith a single vessel, unless they themselves sent for more. Disappointed\nhere, the Athenians now sailed back again, and after landing and\nplundering on Syracusan territory and losing some stragglers from their\nlight infantry through the coming up of the Syracusan horse, so got back\nto Catana.\n\nThere they found the Salaminia come from Athens for Alcibiades, with\norders for him to sail home to answer the charges which the state\nbrought against him, and for certain others of the soldiers who with\nhim were accused of sacrilege in the matter of the mysteries and of the\nHermae. For the Athenians, after the departure of the expedition, had\ncontinued as active as ever in investigating the facts of the mysteries\nand of the Hermae, and, instead of testing the informers, in their\nsuspicious temper welcomed all indifferently, arresting and imprisoning\nthe best citizens upon the evidence of rascals, and preferring to sift\nthe matter to the bottom sooner than to let an accused person of good\ncharacter pass unquestioned, owing to the rascality of the informer. The\ncommons had heard how oppressive the tyranny of Pisistratus and his sons\nhad become before it ended, and further that that had been put down at\nlast, not by themselves and Harmodius, but by the Lacedaemonians, and so\nwere always in fear and took everything suspiciously.\n\nIndeed, the daring action of Aristogiton and Harmodius was undertaken\nin consequence of a love affair, which I shall relate at some length, to\nshow that the Athenians are not more accurate than the rest of the world\nin their accounts of their own tyrants and of the facts of their own\nhistory. Pisistratus dying at an advanced age in possession of the\ntyranny, was succeeded by his eldest son, Hippias, and not Hipparchus,\nas is vulgarly believed. Harmodius was then in the flower of youthful\nbeauty, and Aristogiton, a citizen in the middle rank of life, was his\nlover and possessed him. Solicited without success by Hipparchus, son of\nPisistratus, Harmodius told Aristogiton, and the enraged lover, afraid\nthat the powerful Hipparchus might take Harmodius by force, immediately\nformed a design, such as his condition in life permitted, for\noverthrowing the tyranny. In the meantime Hipparchus, after a second\nsolicitation of Harmodius, attended with no better success, unwilling\nto use violence, arranged to insult him in some covert way. Indeed,\ngenerally their government was not grievous to the multitude, or in any\nway odious in practice; and these tyrants cultivated wisdom and virtue\nas much as any, and without exacting from the Athenians more than a\ntwentieth of their income, splendidly adorned their city, and carried on\ntheir wars, and provided sacrifices for the temples. For the rest, the\ncity was left in full enjoyment of its existing laws, except that care\nwas always taken to have the offices in the hands of some one of the\nfamily. Among those of them that held the yearly archonship at Athens\nwas Pisistratus, son of the tyrant Hippias, and named after his\ngrandfather, who dedicated during his term of office the altar to the\ntwelve gods in the market-place, and that of Apollo in the Pythian\nprecinct. The Athenian people afterwards built on to and lengthened the\naltar in the market-place, and obliterated the inscription; but that in\nthe Pythian precinct can still be seen, though in faded letters, and is\nto the following effect:\n\nPisistratus, the son of Hippias, Sent up this record of his archonship\nIn precinct of Apollo Pythias.\n\nThat Hippias was the eldest son and succeeded to the government, is what\nI positively assert as a fact upon which I have had more exact accounts\nthan others, and may be also ascertained by the following circumstance.\nHe is the only one of the legitimate brothers that appears to have had\nchildren; as the altar shows, and the pillar placed in the Athenian\nAcropolis, commemorating the crime of the tyrants, which mentions no\nchild of Thessalus or of Hipparchus, but five of Hippias, which he had\nby Myrrhine, daughter of Callias, son of Hyperechides; and naturally\nthe eldest would have married first. Again, his name comes first on the\npillar after that of his father; and this too is quite natural, as\nhe was the eldest after him, and the reigning tyrant. Nor can I ever\nbelieve that Hippias would have obtained the tyranny so easily, if\nHipparchus had been in power when he was killed, and he, Hippias, had\nhad to establish himself upon the same day; but he had no doubt been\nlong accustomed to overawe the citizens, and to be obeyed by his\nmercenaries, and thus not only conquered, but conquered with ease,\nwithout experiencing any of the embarrassment of a younger brother\nunused to the exercise of authority. It was the sad fate which made\nHipparchus famous that got him also the credit with posterity of having\nbeen tyrant.\n\nTo return to Harmodius; Hipparchus having been repulsed in his\nsolicitations insulted him as he had resolved, by first inviting a\nsister of his, a young girl, to come and bear a basket in a certain\nprocession, and then rejecting her, on the plea that she had never been\ninvited at all owing to her unworthiness. If Harmodius was indignant at\nthis, Aristogiton for his sake now became more exasperated than ever;\nand having arranged everything with those who were to join them in the\nenterprise, they only waited for the great feast of the Panathenaea, the\nsole day upon which the citizens forming part of the procession could\nmeet together in arms without suspicion. Aristogiton and Harmodius were\nto begin, but were to be supported immediately by their accomplices\nagainst the bodyguard. The conspirators were not many, for better\nsecurity, besides which they hoped that those not in the plot would be\ncarried away by the example of a few daring spirits, and use the arms in\ntheir hands to recover their liberty.\n\nAt last the festival arrived; and Hippias with his bodyguard was outside\nthe city in the Ceramicus, arranging how the different parts of the\nprocession were to proceed. Harmodius and Aristogiton had already\ntheir daggers and were getting ready to act, when seeing one of their\naccomplices talking familiarly with Hippias, who was easy of access to\nevery one, they took fright, and concluded that they were discovered and\non the point of being taken; and eager if possible to be revenged first\nupon the man who had wronged them and for whom they had undertaken all\nthis risk, they rushed, as they were, within the gates, and meeting\nwith Hipparchus by the Leocorium recklessly fell upon him at once,\ninfuriated, Aristogiton by love, and Harmodius by insult, and smote him\nand slew him. Aristogiton escaped the guards at the moment, through the\ncrowd running up, but was afterwards taken and dispatched in no merciful\nway: Harmodius was killed on the spot.\n\nWhen the news was brought to Hippias in the Ceramicus, he at once\nproceeded not to the scene of action, but to the armed men in the\nprocession, before they, being some distance away, knew anything of the\nmatter, and composing his features for the occasion, so as not to betray\nhimself, pointed to a certain spot, and bade them repair thither without\ntheir arms. They withdrew accordingly, fancying he had something to say;\nupon which he told the mercenaries to remove the arms, and there and\nthen picked out the men he thought guilty and all found with daggers,\nthe shield and spear being the usual weapons for a procession.\n\nIn this way offended love first led Harmodius and Aristogiton to\nconspire, and the alarm of the moment to commit the rash action\nrecounted. After this the tyranny pressed harder on the Athenians, and\nHippias, now grown more fearful, put to death many of the citizens, and\nat the same time began to turn his eyes abroad for a refuge in case of\nrevolution. Thus, although an Athenian, he gave his daughter, Archedice,\nto a Lampsacene, Aeantides, son of the tyrant of Lampsacus, seeing that\nthey had great influence with Darius. And there is her tomb in Lampsacus\nwith this inscription:\n\nArchedice lies buried in this earth, Hippias her sire, and Athens gave\nher birth; Unto her bosom pride was never known, Though daughter, wife,\nand sister to the throne.\n\nHippias, after reigning three years longer over the Athenians,\nwas deposed in the fourth by the Lacedaemonians and the banished\nAlcmaeonidae, and went with a safe conduct to Sigeum, and to Aeantides\nat Lampsacus, and from thence to King Darius; from whose court he set\nout twenty years after, in his old age, and came with the Medes to\nMarathon.\n\nWith these events in their minds, and recalling everything they knew by\nhearsay on the subject, the Athenian people grow difficult of humour and\nsuspicious of the persons charged in the affair of the mysteries, and\npersuaded that all that had taken place was part of an oligarchical and\nmonarchical conspiracy. In the state of irritation thus produced, many\npersons of consideration had been already thrown into prison, and\nfar from showing any signs of abating, public feeling grew daily more\nsavage, and more arrests were made; until at last one of those in\ncustody, thought to be the most guilty of all, was induced by a fellow\nprisoner to make a revelation, whether true or not is a matter on which\nthere are two opinions, no one having been able, either then or since,\nto say for certain who did the deed. However this may be, the other\nfound arguments to persuade him, that even if he had not done it, he\nought to save himself by gaining a promise of impunity, and free the\nstate of its present suspicions; as he would be surer of safety if he\nconfessed after promise of impunity than if he denied and were brought\nto trial. He accordingly made a revelation, affecting himself and others\nin the affair of the Hermae; and the Athenian people, glad at last, as\nthey supposed, to get at the truth, and furious until then at not being\nable to discover those who had conspired against the commons, at once\nlet go the informer and all the rest whom he had not denounced, and\nbringing the accused to trial executed as many as were apprehended, and\ncondemned to death such as had fled and set a price upon their heads.\nIn this it was, after all, not clear whether the sufferers had been\npunished unjustly, while in any case the rest of the city received\nimmediate and manifest relief.\n\nTo return to Alcibiades: public feeling was very hostile to him, being\nworked on by the same enemies who had attacked him before he went out;\nand now that the Athenians fancied that they had got at the truth of\nthe matter of the Hermae, they believed more firmly than ever that\nthe affair of the mysteries also, in which he was implicated, had been\ncontrived by him in the same intention and was connected with the plot\nagainst the democracy. Meanwhile it so happened that, just at the time\nof this agitation, a small force of Lacedaemonians had advanced as far\nas the Isthmus, in pursuance of some scheme with the Boeotians. It was\nnow thought that this had come by appointment, at his instigation, and\nnot on account of the Boeotians, and that, if the citizens had not\nacted on the information received, and forestalled them by arresting the\nprisoners, the city would have been betrayed. The citizens went so far\nas to sleep one night armed in the temple of Theseus within the walls.\nThe friends also of Alcibiades at Argos were just at this time suspected\nof a design to attack the commons; and the Argive hostages deposited in\nthe islands were given up by the Athenians to the Argive people to be\nput to death upon that account: in short, everywhere something was found\nto create suspicion against Alcibiades. It was therefore decided to\nbring him to trial and execute him, and the Salaminia was sent to Sicily\nfor him and the others named in the information, with instructions to\norder him to come and answer the charges against him, but not to arrest\nhim, because they wished to avoid causing any agitation in the army or\namong the enemy in Sicily, and above all to retain the services of the\nMantineans and Argives, who, it was thought, had been induced to join\nby his influence. Alcibiades, with his own ship and his fellow accused,\naccordingly sailed off with the Salaminia from Sicily, as though to\nreturn to Athens, and went with her as far as Thurii, and there they\nleft the ship and disappeared, being afraid to go home for trial with\nsuch a prejudice existing against them. The crew of the Salaminia stayed\nsome time looking for Alcibiades and his companions, and at length, as\nthey were nowhere to be found, set sail and departed. Alcibiades, now an\noutlaw, crossed in a boat not long after from Thurii to Peloponnese; and\nthe Athenians passed sentence of death by default upon him and those in\nhis company.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n_Seventeenth and Eighteenth Years of the War--Inaction of the Athenian\nArmy--Alcibiades at Sparta--Investment of Syracuse_\n\nThe Athenian generals left in Sicily now divided the armament into two\nparts, and, each taking one by lot, sailed with the whole for Selinus\nand Egesta, wishing to know whether the Egestaeans would give the money,\nand to look into the question of Selinus and ascertain the state of the\nquarrel between her and Egesta. Coasting along Sicily, with the shore\non their left, on the side towards the Tyrrhene Gulf they touched at\nHimera, the only Hellenic city in that part of the island, and being\nrefused admission resumed their voyage. On their way they took Hyccara,\na petty Sicanian seaport, nevertheless at war with Egesta, and making\nslaves of the inhabitants gave up the town to the Egestaeans, some of\nwhose horse had joined them; after which the army proceeded through the\nterritory of the Sicels until it reached Catana, while the fleet sailed\nalong the coast with the slaves on board. Meanwhile Nicias sailed\nstraight from Hyccara along the coast and went to Egesta and, after\ntransacting his other business and receiving thirty talents, rejoined\nthe forces. They now sold their slaves for the sum of one hundred and\ntwenty talents, and sailed round to their Sicel allies to urge them to\nsend troops; and meanwhile went with half their own force to the hostile\ntown of Hybla in the territory of Gela, but did not succeed in taking\nit.\n\nSummer was now over. The winter following, the Athenians at once began\nto prepare for moving on Syracuse, and the Syracusans on their side\nfor marching against them. From the moment when the Athenians failed to\nattack them instantly as they at first feared and expected, every day\nthat passed did something to revive their courage; and when they saw\nthem sailing far away from them on the other side of Sicily, and going\nto Hybla only to fail in their attempts to storm it, they thought less\nof them than ever, and called upon their generals, as the multitude is\napt to do in its moments of confidence, to lead them to Catana, since\nthe enemy would not come to them. Parties also of the Syracusan horse\nemployed in reconnoitring constantly rode up to the Athenian armament,\nand among other insults asked them whether they had not really come to\nsettle with the Syracusans in a foreign country rather than to resettle\nthe Leontines in their own.\n\nAware of this, the Athenian generals determined to draw them out in mass\nas far as possible from the city, and themselves in the meantime to sail\nby night alongshore, and take up at their leisure a convenient position.\nThis they knew they could not so well do, if they had to disembark from\ntheir ships in front of a force prepared for them, or to go by land\nopenly. The numerous cavalry of the Syracusans (a force which they were\nthemselves without) would then be able to do the greatest mischief to\ntheir light troops and the crowd that followed them; but this plan would\nenable them to take up a position in which the horse could do them no\nhurt worth speaking of, some Syracusan exiles with the army having told\nthem of the spot near the Olympieum, which they afterwards occupied. In\npursuance of their idea, the generals imagined the following stratagem.\nThey sent to Syracuse a man devoted to them, and by the Syracusan\ngenerals thought to be no less in their interest; he was a native of\nCatana, and said he came from persons in that place, whose names the\nSyracusan generals were acquainted with, and whom they knew to be among\nthe members of their party still left in the city. He told them that\nthe Athenians passed the night in the town, at some distance from their\narms, and that if the Syracusans would name a day and come with all\ntheir people at daybreak to attack the armament, they, their friends,\nwould close the gates upon the troops in the city, and set fire to the\nvessels, while the Syracusans would easily take the camp by an attack\nupon the stockade. In this they would be aided by many of the Catanians,\nwho were already prepared to act, and from whom he himself came.\n\nThe generals of the Syracusans, who did not want confidence, and who had\nintended even without this to march on Catana, believed the man without\nany sufficient inquiry, fixed at once a day upon which they would be\nthere, and dismissed him, and the Selinuntines and others of their\nallies having now arrived, gave orders for all the Syracusans to march\nout in mass. Their preparations completed, and the time fixed for their\narrival being at hand, they set out for Catana, and passed the night\nupon the river Symaethus, in the Leontine territory. Meanwhile the\nAthenians no sooner knew of their approach than they took all their\nforces and such of the Sicels or others as had joined them, put them on\nboard their ships and boats, and sailed by night to Syracuse. Thus, when\nmorning broke the Athenians were landing opposite the Olympieum ready\nto seize their camping ground, and the Syracusan horse having ridden up\nfirst to Catana and found that all the armament had put to sea, turned\nback and told the infantry, and then all turned back together, and went\nto the relief of the city.\n\nIn the meantime, as the march before the Syracusans was a long one, the\nAthenians quietly sat down their army in a convenient position,\nwhere they could begin an engagement when they pleased, and where the\nSyracusan cavalry would have least opportunity of annoying them, either\nbefore or during the action, being fenced off on one side by walls,\nhouses, trees, and by a marsh, and on the other by cliffs. They also\nfelled the neighbouring trees and carried them down to the sea, and\nformed a palisade alongside of their ships, and with stones which they\npicked up and wood hastily raised a fort at Daskon, the most vulnerable\npoint of their position, and broke down the bridge over the Anapus.\nThese preparations were allowed to go on without any interruption from\nthe city, the first hostile force to appear being the Syracusan cavalry,\nfollowed afterwards by all the foot together. At first they came close\nup to the Athenian army, and then, finding that they did not offer to\nengage, crossed the Helorine road and encamped for the night.\n\nThe next day the Athenians and their allies prepared for battle, their\ndispositions being as follows: Their right wing was occupied by the\nArgives and Mantineans, the centre by the Athenians, and the rest of the\nfield by the other allies. Half their army was drawn up eight deep in\nadvance, half close to their tents in a hollow square, formed also eight\ndeep, which had orders to look out and be ready to go to the support of\nthe troops hardest pressed. The camp followers were placed inside this\nreserve. The Syracusans, meanwhile, formed their heavy infantry sixteen\ndeep, consisting of the mass levy of their own people, and such\nallies as had joined them, the strongest contingent being that of the\nSelinuntines; next to them the cavalry of the Geloans, numbering two\nhundred in all, with about twenty horse and fifty archers from Camarina.\nThe cavalry was posted on their right, full twelve hundred strong, and\nnext to it the darters. As the Athenians were about to begin the attack,\nNicias went along the lines, and addressed these words of encouragement\nto the army and the nations composing it:\n\n\"Soldiers, a long exhortation is little needed by men like ourselves,\nwho are here to fight in the same battle, the force itself being, to my\nthinking, more fit to inspire confidence than a fine speech with a weak\narmy. Where we have Argives, Mantineans, Athenians, and the first of the\nislanders in the ranks together, it were strange indeed, with so\nmany and so brave companions in arms, if we did not feel confident\nof victory; especially when we have mass levies opposed to our picked\ntroops, and what is more, Siceliots, who may disdain us but will not\nstand against us, their skill not being at all commensurate to their\nrashness. You may also remember that we are far from home and have no\nfriendly land near, except what your own swords shall win you; and here\nI put before you a motive just the reverse of that which the enemy are\nappealing to; their cry being that they shall fight for their country,\nmine that we shall fight for a country that is not ours, where we must\nconquer or hardly get away, as we shall have their horse upon us in\ngreat numbers. Remember, therefore, your renown, and go boldly against\nthe enemy, thinking the present strait and necessity more terrible than\nthey.\"\n\nAfter this address Nicias at once led on the army. The Syracusans were\nnot at that moment expecting an immediate engagement, and some had even\ngone away to the town, which was close by; these now ran up as hard as\nthey could and, though behind time, took their places here or there\nin the main body as fast as they joined it. Want of zeal or daring was\ncertainly not the fault of the Syracusans, either in this or the other\nbattles, but although not inferior in courage, so far as their military\nscience might carry them, when this failed them they were compelled to\ngive up their resolution also. On the present occasion, although they\nhad not supposed that the Athenians would begin the attack, and although\nconstrained to stand upon their defence at short notice, they at once\ntook up their arms and advanced to meet them. First, the stone-throwers,\nslingers, and archers of either army began skirmishing, and routed or\nwere routed by one another, as might be expected between light troops;\nnext, soothsayers brought forward the usual victims, and trumpeters\nurged on the heavy infantry to the charge; and thus they advanced,\nthe Syracusans to fight for their country, and each individual for\nhis safety that day and liberty hereafter; in the enemy's army, the\nAthenians to make another's country theirs and to save their own from\nsuffering by their defeat; the Argives and independent allies to help\nthem in getting what they came for, and to earn by victory another sight\nof the country they had left behind; while the subject allies owed most\nof their ardour to the desire of self-preservation, which they could\nonly hope for if victorious; next to which, as a secondary motive, came\nthe chance of serving on easier terms, after helping the Athenians to a\nfresh conquest.\n\nThe armies now came to close quarters, and for a long while fought\nwithout either giving ground. Meanwhile there occurred some claps of\nthunder with lightning and heavy rain, which did not fail to add to\nthe fears of the party fighting for the first time, and very little\nacquainted with war; while to their more experienced adversaries these\nphenomena appeared to be produced by the time of year, and much more\nalarm was felt at the continued resistance of the enemy. At last the\nArgives drove in the Syracusan left, and after them the Athenians routed\nthe troops opposed to them, and the Syracusan army was thus cut in two\nand betook itself to flight. The Athenians did not pursue far, being\nheld in check by the numerous and undefeated Syracusan horse, who\nattacked and drove back any of their heavy infantry whom they saw\npursuing in advance of the rest; in spite of which the victors followed\nso far as was safe in a body, and then went back and set up a trophy.\nMeanwhile the Syracusans rallied at the Helorine road, where they\nre-formed as well as they could under the circumstances, and even sent\na garrison of their own citizens to the Olympieum, fearing that the\nAthenians might lay hands on some of the treasures there. The rest\nreturned to the town.\n\nThe Athenians, however, did not go to the temple, but collected their\ndead and laid them upon a pyre, and passed the night upon the field. The\nnext day they gave the enemy back their dead under truce, to the number\nof about two hundred and sixty, Syracusans and allies, and gathered\ntogether the bones of their own, some fifty, Athenians and allies,\nand taking the spoils of the enemy, sailed back to Catana. It was now\nwinter; and it did not seem possible for the moment to carry on the war\nbefore Syracuse, until horse should have been sent for from Athens\nand levied among the allies in Sicily--to do away with their utter\ninferiority in cavalry--and money should have been collected in the\ncountry and received from Athens, and until some of the cities, which\nthey hoped would be now more disposed to listen to them after\nthe battle, should have been brought over, and corn and all other\nnecessaries provided, for a campaign in the spring against Syracuse.\n\nWith this intention they sailed off to Naxos and Catana for the winter.\nMeanwhile the Syracusans burned their dead and then held an assembly,\nin which Hermocrates, son of Hermon, a man who with a general ability\nof the first order had given proofs of military capacity and brilliant\ncourage in the war, came forward and encouraged them, and told them not\nto let what had occurred make them give way, since their spirit had\nnot been conquered, but their want of discipline had done the mischief.\nStill they had not been beaten by so much as might have been expected,\nespecially as they were, one might say, novices in the art of war, an\narmy of artisans opposed to the most practised soldiers in Hellas. What\nhad also done great mischief was the number of the generals (there were\nfifteen of them) and the quantity of orders given, combined with the\ndisorder and insubordination of the troops. But if they were to have\na few skilful generals, and used this winter in preparing their heavy\ninfantry, finding arms for such as had not got any, so as to make them\nas numerous as possible, and forcing them to attend to their training\ngenerally, they would have every chance of beating their adversaries,\ncourage being already theirs and discipline in the field having thus\nbeen added to it. Indeed, both these qualities would improve, since\ndanger would exercise them in discipline, while their courage would\nbe led to surpass itself by the confidence which skill inspires. The\ngenerals should be few and elected with full powers, and an oath should\nbe taken to leave them entire discretion in their command: if they\nadopted this plan, their secrets would be better kept, all preparations\nwould be properly made, and there would be no room for excuses.\n\nThe Syracusans heard him, and voted everything as he advised, and\nelected three generals, Hermocrates himself, Heraclides, son of\nLysimachus, and Sicanus, son of Execestes. They also sent envoys to\nCorinth and Lacedaemon to procure a force of allies to join them, and to\ninduce the Lacedaemonians for their sakes openly to address themselves\nin real earnest to the war against the Athenians, that they might either\nhave to leave Sicily or be less able to send reinforcements to their\narmy there.\n\nThe Athenian forces at Catana now at once sailed against Messina, in the\nexpectation of its being betrayed to them. The intrigue, however, after\nall came to nothing: Alcibiades, who was in the secret, when he left\nhis command upon the summons from home, foreseeing that he would be\noutlawed, gave information of the plot to the friends of the Syracusans\nin Messina, who had at once put to death its authors, and now rose in\narms against the opposite faction with those of their way of thinking,\nand succeeded in preventing the admission of the Athenians. The latter\nwaited for thirteen days, and then, as they were exposed to the weather\nand without provisions, and met with no success, went back to Naxos,\nwhere they made places for their ships to lie in, erected a palisade\nround their camp, and retired into winter quarters; meanwhile they sent\na galley to Athens for money and cavalry to join them in the spring.\nDuring the winter the Syracusans built a wall on to the city, so as\nto take in the statue of Apollo Temenites, all along the side looking\ntowards Epipolae, to make the task of circumvallation longer and more\ndifficult, in case of their being defeated, and also erected a fort at\nMegara and another in the Olympieum, and stuck palisades along the sea\nwherever there was a landing Place. Meanwhile, as they knew that the\nAthenians were wintering at Naxos, they marched with all their people to\nCatana, and ravaged the land and set fire to the tents and encampment\nof the Athenians, and so returned home. Learning also that the Athenians\nwere sending an embassy to Camarina, on the strength of the alliance\nconcluded in the time of Laches, to gain, if possible, that city, they\nsent another from Syracuse to oppose them. They had a shrewd suspicion\nthat the Camarinaeans had not sent what they did send for the first\nbattle very willingly; and they now feared that they would refuse to\nassist them at all in future, after seeing the success of the Athenians\nin the action, and would join the latter on the strength of their\nold friendship. Hermocrates, with some others, accordingly arrived at\nCamarina from Syracuse, and Euphemus and others from the Athenians; and\nan assembly of the Camarinaeans having been convened, Hermocrates spoke\nas follows, in the hope of prejudicing them against the Athenians:\n\n\"Camarinaeans, we did not come on this embassy because we were afraid of\nyour being frightened by the actual forces of the Athenians, but rather\nof your being gained by what they would say to you before you heard\nanything from us. They are come to Sicily with the pretext that you\nknow, and the intention which we all suspect, in my opinion less to\nrestore the Leontines to their homes than to oust us from ours; as it\nis out of all reason that they should restore in Sicily the cities that\nthey lay waste in Hellas, or should cherish the Leontine Chalcidians\nbecause of their Ionian blood and keep in servitude the Euboean\nChalcidians, of whom the Leontines are a colony. No; but the same policy\nwhich has proved so successful in Hellas is now being tried in Sicily.\nAfter being chosen as the leaders of the Ionians and of the other allies\nof Athenian origin, to punish the Mede, the Athenians accused some of\nfailure in military service, some of fighting against each other, and\nothers, as the case might be, upon any colourable pretext that could\nbe found, until they thus subdued them all. In fine, in the struggle\nagainst the Medes, the Athenians did not fight for the liberty of the\nHellenes, or the Hellenes for their own liberty, but the former to make\ntheir countrymen serve them instead of him, the latter to change one\nmaster for another, wiser indeed than the first, but wiser for evil.\n\n\"But we are not now come to declare to an audience familiar with them\nthe misdeeds of a state so open to accusation as is the Athenian, but\nmuch rather to blame ourselves, who, with the warnings we possess in the\nHellenes in those parts that have been enslaved through not supporting\neach other, and seeing the same sophisms being now tried upon\nourselves--such as restorations of Leontine kinsfolk and support of\nEgestaean allies--do not stand together and resolutely show them\nthat here are no Ionians, or Hellespontines, or islanders, who change\ncontinually, but always serve a master, sometimes the Mede and sometimes\nsome other, but free Dorians from independent Peloponnese, dwelling in\nSicily. Or, are we waiting until we be taken in detail, one city after\nanother; knowing as we do that in no other way can we be conquered, and\nseeing that they turn to this plan, so as to divide some of us by words,\nto draw some by the bait of an alliance into open war with each other,\nand to ruin others by such flattery as different circumstances may\nrender acceptable? And do we fancy when destruction first overtakes a\ndistant fellow countryman that the danger will not come to each of us\nalso, or that he who suffers before us will suffer in himself alone?\n\n\"As for the Camarinaean who says that it is the Syracusan, not he,\nthat is the enemy of the Athenian, and who thinks it hard to have to\nencounter risk in behalf of my country, I would have him bear in mind\nthat he will fight in my country, not more for mine than for his own,\nand by so much the more safely in that he will enter on the struggle\nnot alone, after the way has been cleared by my ruin, but with me as his\nally, and that the object of the Athenian is not so much to punish the\nenmity of the Syracusan as to use me as a blind to secure the friendship\nof the Camarinaean. As for him who envies or even fears us (and envied\nand feared great powers must always be), and who on this account wishes\nSyracuse to be humbled to teach us a lesson, but would still have her\nsurvive, in the interest of his own security the wish that he indulges\nis not humanly possible. A man can control his own desires, but\nhe cannot likewise control circumstances; and in the event of his\ncalculations proving mistaken, he may live to bewail his own misfortune,\nand wish to be again envying my prosperity. An idle wish, if he now\nsacrifice us and refuse to take his share of perils which are the same,\nin reality though not in name, for him as for us; what is nominally the\npreservation of our power being really his own salvation. It was to be\nexpected that you, of all people in the world, Camarinaeans, being our\nimmediate neighbours and the next in danger, would have foreseen this,\nand instead of supporting us in the lukewarm way that you are now doing,\nwould rather come to us of your own accord, and be now offering at\nSyracuse the aid which you would have asked for at Camarina, if to\nCamarina the Athenians had first come, to encourage us to resist the\ninvader. Neither you, however, nor the rest have as yet bestirred\nyourselves in this direction.\n\n\"Fear perhaps will make you study to do right both by us and by the\ninvaders, and plead that you have an alliance with the Athenians.\nBut you made that alliance, not against your friends, but against the\nenemies that might attack you, and to help the Athenians when they were\nwronged by others, not when as now they are wronging their neighbours.\nEven the Rhegians, Chalcidians though they be, refuse to help to restore\nthe Chalcidian Leontines; and it would be strange if, while they suspect\nthe gist of this fine pretence and are wise without reason, you, with\nevery reason on your side, should yet choose to assist your natural\nenemies, and should join with their direst foes in undoing those whom\nnature has made your own kinsfolk. This is not to do right; but you\nshould help us without fear of their armament, which has no terrors if\nwe hold together, but only if we let them succeed in their endeavours\nto separate us; since even after attacking us by ourselves and being\nvictorious in battle, they had to go off without effecting their\npurpose.\n\n\"United, therefore, we have no cause to despair, but rather new\nencouragement to league together; especially as succour will come to us\nfrom the Peloponnesians, in military matters the undoubted superiors of\nthe Athenians. And you need not think that your prudent policy of taking\nsides with neither, because allies of both, is either safe for you or\nfair to us. Practically it is not as fair as it pretends to be. If the\nvanquished be defeated, and the victor conquer, through your refusing to\njoin, what is the effect of your abstention but to leave the former to\nperish unaided, and to allow the latter to offend unhindered? And yet it\nwere more honourable to join those who are not only the injured party,\nbut your own kindred, and by so doing to defend the common interests of\nSicily and save your friends the Athenians from doing wrong.\n\n\"In conclusion, we Syracusans say that it is useless for us to\ndemonstrate either to you or to the rest what you know already as well\nas we do; but we entreat, and if our entreaty fail, we protest that we\nare menaced by our eternal enemies the Ionians, and are betrayed by\nyou our fellow Dorians. If the Athenians reduce us, they will owe their\nvictory to your decision, but in their own name will reap the honour,\nand will receive as the prize of their triumph the very men who enabled\nthem to gain it. On the other hand, if we are the conquerors, you\nwill have to pay for having been the cause of our danger. Consider,\ntherefore; and now make your choice between the security which present\nservitude offers and the prospect of conquering with us and so escaping\ndisgraceful submission to an Athenian master and avoiding the lasting\nenmity of Syracuse.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Hermocrates; after whom Euphemus, the Athenian\nambassador, spoke as follows:\n\n\"Although we came here only to renew the former alliance, the attack of\nthe Syracusans compels us to speak of our empire and of the good right\nwe have to it. The best proof of this the speaker himself furnished,\nwhen he called the Ionians eternal enemies of the Dorians. It is the\nfact; and the Peloponnesian Dorians being our superiors in numbers and\nnext neighbours, we Ionians looked out for the best means of escaping\ntheir domination. After the Median War we had a fleet, and so got rid of\nthe empire and supremacy of the Lacedaemonians, who had no right to give\norders to us more than we to them, except that of being the strongest at\nthat moment; and being appointed leaders of the King's former subjects,\nwe continue to be so, thinking that we are least likely to fall under\nthe dominion of the Peloponnesians, if we have a force to defend\nourselves with, and in strict truth having done nothing unfair in\nreducing to subjection the Ionians and islanders, the kinsfolk whom the\nSyracusans say we have enslaved. They, our kinsfolk, came against their\nmother country, that is to say against us, together with the Mede, and,\ninstead of having the courage to revolt and sacrifice their property as\nwe did when we abandoned our city, chose to be slaves themselves, and to\ntry to make us so.\n\n\"We, therefore, deserve to rule because we placed the largest fleet and\nan unflinching patriotism at the service of the Hellenes, and because\nthese, our subjects, did us mischief by their ready subservience to the\nMedes; and, desert apart, we seek to strengthen ourselves against the\nPeloponnesians. We make no fine profession of having a right to rule\nbecause we overthrew the barbarian single-handed, or because we risked\nwhat we did risk for the freedom of the subjects in question any more\nthan for that of all, and for our own: no one can be quarrelled with\nfor providing for his proper safety. If we are now here in Sicily, it\nis equally in the interest of our security, with which we perceive that\nyour interest also coincides. We prove this from the conduct which\nthe Syracusans cast against us and which you somewhat too timorously\nsuspect; knowing that those whom fear has made suspicious may be carried\naway by the charm of eloquence for the moment, but when they come to act\nfollow their interests.\n\n\"Now, as we have said, fear makes us hold our empire in Hellas, and fear\nmakes us now come, with the help of our friends, to order safely matters\nin Sicily, and not to enslave any but rather to prevent any from\nbeing enslaved. Meanwhile, let no one imagine that we are interesting\nourselves in you without your having anything to do with us, seeing\nthat, if you are preserved and able to make head against the\nSyracusans, they will be less likely to harm us by sending troops to the\nPeloponnesians. In this way you have everything to do with us, and on\nthis account it is perfectly reasonable for us to restore the Leontines,\nand to make them, not subjects like their kinsmen in Euboea, but as\npowerful as possible, to help us by annoying the Syracusans from their\nfrontier. In Hellas we are alone a match for our enemies; and as for the\nassertion that it is out of all reason that we should free the Sicilian,\nwhile we enslave the Chalcidian, the fact is that the latter is useful\nto us by being without arms and contributing money only; while the\nformer, the Leontines and our other friends, cannot be too independent.\n\n\"Besides, for tyrants and imperial cities nothing is unreasonable if\nexpedient, no one a kinsman unless sure; but friendship or enmity is\neverywhere an affair of time and circumstance. Here, in Sicily, our\ninterest is not to weaken our friends, but by means of their strength to\ncripple our enemies. Why doubt this? In Hellas we treat our allies as\nwe find them useful. The Chians and Methymnians govern themselves and\nfurnish ships; most of the rest have harder terms and pay tribute in\nmoney; while others, although islanders and easy for us to take,\nare free altogether, because they occupy convenient positions round\nPeloponnese. In our settlement of the states here in Sicily, we should\ntherefore; naturally be guided by our interest, and by fear, as we say,\nof the Syracusans. Their ambition is to rule you, their object to use\nthe suspicions that we excite to unite you, and then, when we have gone\naway without effecting anything, by force or through your isolation, to\nbecome the masters of Sicily. And masters they must become, if you unite\nwith them; as a force of that magnitude would be no longer easy for us\nto deal with united, and they would be more than a match for you as soon\nas we were away.\n\n\"Any other view of the case is condemned by the facts. When you first\nasked us over, the fear which you held out was that of danger to Athens\nif we let you come under the dominion of Syracuse; and it is not right\nnow to mistrust the very same argument by which you claimed to convince\nus, or to give way to suspicion because we are come with a larger force\nagainst the power of that city. Those whom you should really distrust\nare the Syracusans. We are not able to stay here without you, and if\nwe proved perfidious enough to bring you into subjection, we should be\nunable to keep you in bondage, owing to the length of the voyage and\nthe difficulty of guarding large, and in a military sense continental,\ntowns: they, the Syracusans, live close to you, not in a camp, but in\na city greater than the force we have with us, plot always against you,\nnever let slip an opportunity once offered, as they have shown in the\ncase of the Leontines and others, and now have the face, just as if you\nwere fools, to invite you to aid them against the power that hinders\nthis, and that has thus far maintained Sicily independent. We, as\nagainst them, invite you to a much more real safety, when we beg you\nnot to betray that common safety which we each have in the other, and\nto reflect that they, even without allies, will, by their numbers,\nhave always the way open to you, while you will not often have the\nopportunity of defending yourselves with such numerous auxiliaries;\nif, through your suspicions, you once let these go away unsuccessful\nor defeated, you will wish to see if only a handful of them back again,\nwhen the day is past in which their presence could do anything for you.\n\n\"But we hope, Camarinaeans, that the calumnies of the Syracusans will\nnot be allowed to succeed either with you or with the rest: we have told\nyou the whole truth upon the things we are suspected of, and will now\nbriefly recapitulate, in the hope of convincing you. We assert that we\nare rulers in Hellas in order not to be subjects; liberators in Sicily\nthat we may not be harmed by the Sicilians; that we are compelled to\ninterfere in many things, because we have many things to guard against;\nand that now, as before, we are come as allies to those of you who\nsuffer wrong in this island, not without invitation but upon invitation.\nAccordingly, instead of making yourselves judges or censors of our\nconduct, and trying to turn us, which it were now difficult to do, so\nfar as there is anything in our interfering policy or in our character\nthat chimes in with your interest, this take and make use of; and\nbe sure that, far from being injurious to all alike, to most of the\nHellenes that policy is even beneficial. Thanks to it, all men in\nall places, even where we are not, who either apprehend or meditate\naggression, from the near prospect before them, in the one case, of\nobtaining our intervention in their favour, in the other, of our arrival\nmaking the venture dangerous, find themselves constrained, respectively,\nto be moderate against their will, and to be preserved without trouble\nof their own. Do not you reject this security that is open to all who\ndesire it, and is now offered to you; but do like others, and instead of\nbeing always on the defensive against the Syracusans, unite with us, and\nin your turn at last threaten them.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Euphemus. What the Camarinaeans felt was this.\nSympathizing with the Athenians, except in so far as they might be\nafraid of their subjugating Sicily, they had always been at enmity with\ntheir neighbour Syracuse. From the very fact, however, that they were\ntheir neighbours, they feared the Syracusans most of the two, and being\napprehensive of their conquering even without them, both sent them\nin the first instance the few horsemen mentioned, and for the future\ndetermined to support them most in fact, although as sparingly as\npossible; but for the moment in order not to seem to slight the\nAthenians, especially as they had been successful in the engagement, to\nanswer both alike. Agreeably to this resolution they answered that\nas both the contending parties happened to be allies of theirs, they\nthought it most consistent with their oaths at present to side with\nneither; with which answer the ambassadors of either party departed.\n\nIn the meantime, while Syracuse pursued her preparations for war, the\nAthenians were encamped at Naxos, and tried by negotiation to gain\nas many of the Sicels as possible. Those more in the low lands, and\nsubjects of Syracuse, mostly held aloof; but the peoples of the interior\nwho had never been otherwise than independent, with few exceptions, at\nonce joined the Athenians, and brought down corn to the army, and in\nsome cases even money. The Athenians marched against those who refused\nto join, and forced some of them to do so; in the case of others they\nwere stopped by the Syracusans sending garrisons and reinforcements.\nMeanwhile the Athenians moved their winter quarters from Naxos to\nCatana, and reconstructed the camp burnt by the Syracusans, and stayed\nthere the rest of the winter. They also sent a galley to Carthage,\nwith proffers of friendship, on the chance of obtaining assistance,\nand another to Tyrrhenia; some of the cities there having spontaneously\noffered to join them in the war. They also sent round to the Sicels and\nto Egesta, desiring them to send them as many horses as possible, and\nmeanwhile prepared bricks, iron, and all other things necessary for the\nwork of circumvallation, intending by the spring to begin hostilities.\n\nIn the meantime the Syracusan envoys dispatched to Corinth and\nLacedaemon tried as they passed along the coast to persuade the Italiots\nto interfere with the proceedings of the Athenians, which threatened\nItaly quite as much as Syracuse, and having arrived at Corinth made a\nspeech calling on the Corinthians to assist them on the ground of their\ncommon origin. The Corinthians voted at once to aid them heart and soul\nthemselves, and then sent on envoys with them to Lacedaemon, to help\nthem to persuade her also to prosecute the war with the Athenians more\nopenly at home and to send succours to Sicily. The envoys from Corinth\nhaving reached Lacedaemon found there Alcibiades with his fellow\nrefugees, who had at once crossed over in a trading vessel from Thurii,\nfirst to Cyllene in Elis, and afterwards from thence to Lacedaemon;\nupon the Lacedaemonians' own invitation, after first obtaining a safe\nconduct, as he feared them for the part he had taken in the affair\nof Mantinea. The result was that the Corinthians, Syracusans, and\nAlcibiades, pressing all the same request in the assembly of the\nLacedaemonians, succeeded in persuading them; but as the ephors and the\nauthorities, although resolved to send envoys to Syracuse to prevent\ntheir surrendering to the Athenians, showed no disposition to send them\nany assistance, Alcibiades now came forward and inflamed and stirred the\nLacedaemonians by speaking as follows:\n\n\"I am forced first to speak to you of the prejudice with which I am\nregarded, in order that suspicion may not make you disinclined to listen\nto me upon public matters. The connection, with you as your proxeni,\nwhich the ancestors of our family by reason of some discontent\nrenounced, I personally tried to renew by my good offices towards you,\nin particular upon the occasion of the disaster at Pylos. But although I\nmaintained this friendly attitude, you yet chose to negotiate the peace\nwith the Athenians through my enemies, and thus to strengthen them and\nto discredit me. You had therefore no right to complain if I turned to\nthe Mantineans and Argives, and seized other occasions of thwarting and\ninjuring you; and the time has now come when those among you, who in\nthe bitterness of the moment may have been then unfairly angry with me,\nshould look at the matter in its true light, and take a different view.\nThose again who judged me unfavourably, because I leaned rather to the\nside of the commons, must not think that their dislike is any better\nfounded. We have always been hostile to tyrants, and all who oppose\narbitrary power are called commons; hence we continued to act as leaders\nof the multitude; besides which, as democracy was the government of\nthe city, it was necessary in most things to conform to established\nconditions. However, we endeavoured to be more moderate than the\nlicentious temper of the times; and while there were others, formerly\nas now, who tried to lead the multitude astray--the same who banished\nme--our party was that of the whole people, our creed being to do our\npart in preserving the form of government under which the city enjoyed\nthe utmost greatness and freedom, and which we had found existing. As\nfor democracy, the men of sense among us knew what it was, and I perhaps\nas well as any, as I have the more cause to complain of it; but there is\nnothing new to be said of a patent absurdity; meanwhile we did not think\nit safe to alter it under the pressure of your hostility.\n\n\"So much then for the prejudices with which I am regarded: I now can\ncall your attention to the questions you must consider, and upon which\nsuperior knowledge perhaps permits me to speak. We sailed to Sicily\nfirst to conquer, if possible, the Siceliots, and after them the\nItaliots also, and finally to assail the empire and city of Carthage.\nIn the event of all or most of these schemes succeeding, we were then\nto attack Peloponnese, bringing with us the entire force of the Hellenes\nlately acquired in those parts, and taking a number of barbarians into\nour pay, such as the Iberians and others in those countries, confessedly\nthe most warlike known, and building numerous galleys in addition to\nthose which we had already, timber being plentiful in Italy; and with\nthis fleet blockading Peloponnese from the sea and assailing it with\nour armies by land, taking some of the cities by storm, drawing works of\ncircumvallation round others, we hoped without difficulty to effect its\nreduction, and after this to rule the whole of the Hellenic name. Money\nand corn meanwhile for the better execution of these plans were to be\nsupplied in sufficient quantities by the newly acquired places in those\ncountries, independently of our revenues here at home.\n\n\"You have thus heard the history of the present expedition from the man\nwho most exactly knows what our objects were; and the remaining generals\nwill, if they can, carry these out just the same. But that the states in\nSicily must succumb if you do not help them, I will now show. Although\nthe Siceliots, with all their inexperience, might even now be saved if\ntheir forces were united, the Syracusans alone, beaten already in one\nbattle with all their people and blockaded from the sea, will be unable\nto withstand the Athenian armament that is now there. But if Syracuse\nfalls, all Sicily falls also, and Italy immediately afterwards; and the\ndanger which I just now spoke of from that quarter will before long be\nupon you. None need therefore fancy that Sicily only is in question;\nPeloponnese will be so also, unless you speedily do as I tell you, and\nsend on board ship to Syracuse troops that shall able to row their ships\nthemselves, and serve as heavy infantry the moment that they land;\nand what I consider even more important than the troops, a Spartan\nas commanding officer to discipline the forces already on foot and to\ncompel recusants to serve. The friends that you have already will thus\nbecome more confident, and the waverers will be encouraged to join\nyou. Meanwhile you must carry on the war here more openly, that the\nSyracusans, seeing that you do not forget them, may put heart into their\nresistance, and that the Athenians may be less able to reinforce their\narmament. You must fortify Decelea in Attica, the blow of which the\nAthenians are always most afraid and the only one that they think they\nhave not experienced in the present war; the surest method of harming an\nenemy being to find out what he most fears, and to choose this means of\nattacking him, since every one naturally knows best his own weak points\nand fears accordingly. The fortification in question, while it benefits\nyou, will create difficulties for your adversaries, of which I shall\npass over many, and shall only mention the chief. Whatever property\nthere is in the country will most of it become yours, either by capture\nor surrender; and the Athenians will at once be deprived of their\nrevenues from the silver mines at Laurium, of their present gains from\ntheir land and from the law courts, and above all of the revenue from\ntheir allies, which will be paid less regularly, as they lose their awe\nof Athens and see you addressing yourselves with vigour to the war.\nThe zeal and speed with which all this shall be done depends,\nLacedaemonians, upon yourselves; as to its possibility, I am quite\nconfident, and I have little fear of being mistaken.\n\n\"Meanwhile I hope that none of you will think any the worse of me if,\nafter having hitherto passed as a lover of my country, I now actively\njoin its worst enemies in attacking it, or will suspect what I say as\nthe fruit of an outlaw's enthusiasm. I am an outlaw from the iniquity\nof those who drove me forth, not, if you will be guided by me, from your\nservice; my worst enemies are not you who only harmed your foes, but\nthey who forced their friends to become enemies; and love of country is\nwhat I do not feel when I am wronged, but what I felt when secure in my\nrights as a citizen. Indeed I do not consider that I am now attacking\na country that is still mine; I am rather trying to recover one that is\nmine no longer; and the true lover of his country is not he who consents\nto lose it unjustly rather than attack it, but he who longs for it so\nmuch that he will go all lengths to recover it. For myself, therefore,\nLacedaemonians, I beg you to use me without scruple for danger and\ntrouble of every kind, and to remember the argument in every one's\nmouth, that if I did you great harm as an enemy, I could likewise do you\ngood service as a friend, inasmuch as I know the plans of the Athenians,\nwhile I only guessed yours. For yourselves I entreat you to believe that\nyour most capital interests are now under deliberation; and I urge you\nto send without hesitation the expeditions to Sicily and Attica; by the\npresence of a small part of your forces you will save important cities\nin that island, and you will destroy the power of Athens both present\nand prospective; after this you will dwell in security and enjoy the\nsupremacy over all Hellas, resting not on force but upon consent and\naffection.\"\n\nSuch were the words of Alcibiades. The Lacedaemonians, who had\nthemselves before intended to march against Athens, but were still\nwaiting and looking about them, at once became much more in earnest\nwhen they received this particular information from Alcibiades, and\nconsidered that they had heard it from the man who best knew the truth\nof the matter. Accordingly they now turned their attention to the\nfortifying of Decelea and sending immediate aid to the Sicilians; and\nnaming Gylippus, son of Cleandridas, to the command of the Syracusans,\nbade him consult with that people and with the Corinthians and arrange\nfor succours reaching the island, in the best and speediest way possible\nunder the circumstances. Gylippus desired the Corinthians to send him at\nonce two ships to Asine, and to prepare the rest that they intended to\nsend, and to have them ready to sail at the proper time. Having settled\nthis, the envoys departed from Lacedaemon.\n\nIn the meantime arrived the Athenian galley from Sicily sent by the\ngenerals for money and cavalry; and the Athenians, after hearing\nwhat they wanted, voted to send the supplies for the armament and the\ncavalry. And the winter ended, and with it ended the seventeenth year of\nthe present war of which Thucydides is the historian.\n\nThe next summer, at the very beginning of the season, the Athenians in\nSicily put out from Catana, and sailed along shore to Megara in Sicily,\nfrom which, as I have mentioned above, the Syracusans expelled the\ninhabitants in the time of their tyrant Gelo, themselves occupying the\nterritory. Here the Athenians landed and laid waste the country, and\nafter an unsuccessful attack upon a fort of the Syracusans, went on with\nthe fleet and army to the river Terias, and advancing inland laid waste\nthe plain and set fire to the corn; and after killing some of a small\nSyracusan party which they encountered, and setting up a trophy,\nwent back again to their ships. They now sailed to Catana and took in\nprovisions there, and going with their whole force against Centoripa,\na town of the Sicels, acquired it by capitulation, and departed, after\nalso burning the corn of the Inessaeans and Hybleans. Upon their return\nto Catana they found the horsemen arrived from Athens, to the number of\ntwo hundred and fifty (with their equipments, but without their horses\nwhich were to be procured upon the spot), and thirty mounted archers and\nthree hundred talents of silver.\n\nThe same spring the Lacedaemonians marched against Argos, and went as\nfar as Cleonae, when an earthquake occurred and caused them to return.\nAfter this the Argives invaded the Thyreatid, which is on their border,\nand took much booty from the Lacedaemonians, which was sold for no less\nthan twenty-five talents. The same summer, not long after, the\nThespian commons made an attack upon the party in office, which was\nnot successful, but succours arrived from Thebes, and some were caught,\nwhile others took refuge at Athens.\n\nThe same summer the Syracusans learned that the Athenians had been\njoined by their cavalry, and were on the point of marching against them;\nand seeing that without becoming masters of Epipolae, a precipitous\nspot situated exactly over the town, the Athenians could not, even if\nvictorious in battle, easily invest them, they determined to guard its\napproaches, in order that the enemy might not ascend unobserved by this,\nthe sole way by which ascent was possible, as the remainder is lofty\nground, and falls right down to the city, and can all be seen from\ninside; and as it lies above the rest the place is called by the\nSyracusans Epipolae or Overtown. They accordingly went out in mass at\ndaybreak into the meadow along the river Anapus, their new generals,\nHermocrates and his colleagues, having just come into office, and held\na review of their heavy infantry, from whom they first selected a\npicked body of six hundred, under the command of Diomilus, an exile\nfrom Andros, to guard Epipolae, and to be ready to muster at a moment's\nnotice to help wherever help should be required.\n\nMeanwhile the Athenians, the very same morning, were holding a review,\nhaving already made land unobserved with all the armament from Catana,\nopposite a place called Leon, not much more than half a mile from\nEpipolae, where they disembarked their army, bringing the fleet to\nanchor at Thapsus, a peninsula running out into the sea, with a narrow\nisthmus, and not far from the city of Syracuse either by land or water.\nWhile the naval force of the Athenians threw a stockade across the\nisthmus and remained quiet at Thapsus, the land army immediately went on\nat a run to Epipolae, and succeeded in getting up by Euryelus before\nthe Syracusans perceived them, or could come up from the meadow and the\nreview. Diomilus with his six hundred and the rest advanced as quickly\nas they could, but they had nearly three miles to go from the meadow\nbefore reaching them. Attacking in this way in considerable disorder,\nthe Syracusans were defeated in battle at Epipolae and retired to the\ntown, with a loss of about three hundred killed, and Diomilus among the\nnumber. After this the Athenians set up a trophy and restored to the\nSyracusans their dead under truce, and next day descended to Syracuse\nitself; and no one coming out to meet them, reascended and built a fort\nat Labdalum, upon the edge of the cliffs of Epipolae, looking towards\nMegara, to serve as a magazine for their baggage and money, whenever\nthey advanced to battle or to work at the lines.\n\nNot long afterwards three hundred cavalry came to them from Egesta, and\nabout a hundred from the Sicels, Naxians, and others; and thus, with the\ntwo hundred and fifty from Athens, for whom they had got horses from\nthe Egestaeans and Catanians, besides others that they bought, they now\nmustered six hundred and fifty cavalry in all. After posting a garrison\nin Labdalum, they advanced to Syca, where they sat down and quickly\nbuilt the Circle or centre of their wall of circumvallation. The\nSyracusans, appalled at the rapidity with which the work advanced,\ndetermined to go out against them and give battle and interrupt it; and\nthe two armies were already in battle array, when the Syracusan generals\nobserved that their troops found such difficulty in getting into line,\nand were in such disorder, that they led them back into the town, except\npart of the cavalry. These remained and hindered the Athenians from\ncarrying stones or dispersing to any great distance, until a tribe of\nthe Athenian heavy infantry, with all the cavalry, charged and routed\nthe Syracusan horse with some loss; after which they set up a trophy for\nthe cavalry action.\n\nThe next day the Athenians began building the wall to the north of the\nCircle, at the same time collecting stone and timber, which they kept\nlaying down towards Trogilus along the shortest line for their works\nfrom the great harbour to the sea; while the Syracusans, guided by their\ngenerals, and above all by Hermocrates, instead of risking any more\ngeneral engagements, determined to build a counterwork in the direction\nin which the Athenians were going to carry their wall. If this could be\ncompleted in time, the enemy's lines would be cut; and meanwhile, if he\nwere to attempt to interrupt them by an attack, they would send a part\nof their forces against him, and would secure the approaches beforehand\nwith their stockade, while the Athenians would have to leave off working\nwith their whole force in order to attend to them. They accordingly\nsallied forth and began to build, starting from their city, running\na cross wall below the Athenian Circle, cutting down the olives and\nerecting wooden towers. As the Athenian fleet had not yet sailed round\ninto the great harbour, the Syracusans still commanded the seacoast, and\nthe Athenians brought their provisions by land from Thapsus.\n\nThe Syracusans now thought the stockades and stonework of their\ncounterwall sufficiently far advanced; and as the Athenians, afraid of\nbeing divided and so fighting at a disadvantage, and intent upon their\nown wall, did not come out to interrupt them, they left one tribe to\nguard the new work and went back into the city. Meanwhile the Athenians\ndestroyed their pipes of drinking-water carried underground into the\ncity; and watching until the rest of the Syracusans were in their tents\nat midday, and some even gone away into the city, and those in the\nstockade keeping but indifferent guard, appointed three hundred picked\nmen of their own, and some men picked from the light troops and\narmed for the purpose, to run suddenly as fast as they could to the\ncounterwork, while the rest of the army advanced in two divisions, the\none with one of the generals to the city in case of a sortie, the other\nwith the other general to the stockade by the postern gate. The three\nhundred attacked and took the stockade, abandoned by its garrison, who\ntook refuge in the outworks round the statue of Apollo Temenites. Here\nthe pursuers burst in with them, and after getting in were beaten out by\nthe Syracusans, and some few of the Argives and Athenians slain; after\nwhich the whole army retired, and having demolished the counterwork and\npulled up the stockade, carried away the stakes to their own lines, and\nset up a trophy.\n\nThe next day the Athenians from the Circle proceeded to fortify the\ncliff above the marsh which on this side of Epipolae looks towards the\ngreat harbour; this being also the shortest line for their work to\ngo down across the plain and the marsh to the harbour. Meanwhile the\nSyracusans marched out and began a second stockade, starting from the\ncity, across the middle of the marsh, digging a trench alongside to make\nit impossible for the Athenians to carry their wall down to the sea. As\nsoon as the Athenians had finished their work at the cliff they again\nattacked the stockade and ditch of the Syracusans. Ordering the fleet\nto sail round from Thapsus into the great harbour of Syracuse, they\ndescended at about dawn from Epipolae into the plain, and laying doors\nand planks over the marsh, where it was muddy and firmest, crossed over\non these, and by daybreak took the ditch and the stockade, except a\nsmall portion which they captured afterwards. A battle now ensued, in\nwhich the Athenians were victorious, the right wing of the Syracusans\nflying to the town and the left to the river. The three hundred picked\nAthenians, wishing to cut off their passage, pressed on at a run to the\nbridge, when the alarmed Syracusans, who had with them most of their\ncavalry, closed and routed them, hurling them back upon the Athenian\nright wing, the first tribe of which was thrown into a panic by the\nshock. Seeing this, Lamachus came to their aid from the Athenian left\nwith a few archers and with the Argives, and crossing a ditch, was left\nalone with a few that had crossed with him, and was killed with five or\nsix of his men. These the Syracusans managed immediately to snatch up\nin haste and get across the river into a place of security, themselves\nretreating as the rest of the Athenian army now came up.\n\nMeanwhile those who had at first fled for refuge to the city, seeing the\nturn affairs were taking, now rallied from the town and formed against\nthe Athenians in front of them, sending also a part of their number to\nthe Circle on Epipolae, which they hoped to take while denuded of its\ndefenders. These took and destroyed the Athenian outwork of a thousand\nfeet, the Circle itself being saved by Nicias, who happened to have been\nleft in it through illness, and who now ordered the servants to set fire\nto the engines and timber thrown down before the wall; want of men, as\nhe was aware, rendering all other means of escape impossible. This step\nwas justified by the result, the Syracusans not coming any further on\naccount of the fire, but retreating. Meanwhile succours were coming up\nfrom the Athenians below, who had put to flight the troops opposed to\nthem; and the fleet also, according to orders, was sailing from Thapsus\ninto the great harbour. Seeing this, the troops on the heights retired\nin haste, and the whole army of the Syracusans re-entered the city,\nthinking that with their present force they would no longer be able to\nhinder the wall reaching the sea.\n\nAfter this the Athenians set up a trophy and restored to the Syracusans\ntheir dead under truce, receiving in return Lamachus and those who had\nfallen with him. The whole of their forces, naval and military, being\nnow with them, they began from Epipolae and the cliffs and enclosed\nthe Syracusans with a double wall down to the sea. Provisions were now\nbrought in for the armament from all parts of Italy; and many of the\nSicels, who had hitherto been looking to see how things went, came as\nallies to the Athenians: there also arrived three ships of fifty oars\nfrom Tyrrhenia. Meanwhile everything else progressed favourably for\ntheir hopes. The Syracusans began to despair of finding safety in arms,\nno relief having reached them from Peloponnese, and were now proposing\nterms of capitulation among themselves and to Nicias, who after the\ndeath of Lamachus was left sole commander. No decision was come to, but,\nas was natural with men in difficulties and besieged more straitly than\nbefore, there was much discussion with Nicias and still more in the\ntown. Their present misfortunes had also made them suspicious of\none another; and the blame of their disasters was thrown upon the\nill-fortune or treachery of the generals under whose command they had\nhappened; and these were deposed and others, Heraclides, Eucles, and\nTellias, elected in their stead.\n\nMeanwhile the Lacedaemonian, Gylippus, and the ships from Corinth\nwere now off Leucas, intent upon going with all haste to the relief of\nSicily. The reports that reached them being of an alarming kind, and all\nagreeing in the falsehood that Syracuse was already completely invested,\nGylippus abandoned all hope of Sicily, and wishing to save Italy,\nrapidly crossed the Ionian Sea to Tarentum with the Corinthian, Pythen,\ntwo Laconian, and two Corinthian vessels, leaving the Corinthians to\nfollow him after manning, in addition to their own ten, two Leucadian\nand two Ambraciot ships. From Tarentum Gylippus first went on an embassy\nto Thurii, and claimed anew the rights of citizenship which his father\nhad enjoyed; failing to bring over the townspeople, he weighed anchor\nand coasted along Italy. Opposite the Terinaean Gulf he was caught\nby the wind which blows violently and steadily from the north in that\nquarter, and was carried out to sea; and after experiencing very rough\nweather, remade Tarentum, where he hauled ashore and refitted such of\nhis ships as had suffered most from the tempest. Nicias heard of his\napproach, but, like the Thurians, despised the scanty number of his\nships, and set down piracy as the only probable object of the voyage,\nand so took no precautions for the present.\n\nAbout the same time in this summer, the Lacedaemonians invaded Argos\nwith their allies, and laid waste most of the country. The Athenians\nwent with thirty ships to the relief of the Argives, thus breaking their\ntreaty with the Lacedaemonians in the most overt manner. Up to this time\nincursions from Pylos, descents on the coast of the rest of Peloponnese,\ninstead of on the Laconian, had been the extent of their co-operation\nwith the Argives and Mantineans; and although the Argives had often\nbegged them to land, if only for a moment, with their heavy infantry in\nLaconia, lay waste ever so little of it with them, and depart, they had\nalways refused to do so. Now, however, under the command of Phytodorus,\nLaespodius, and Demaratus, they landed at Epidaurus Limera, Prasiae,\nand other places, and plundered the country; and thus furnished the\nLacedaemonians with a better pretext for hostilities against Athens.\nAfter the Athenians had retired from Argos with their fleet, and the\nLacedaemonians also, the Argives made an incursion into the Phlisaid,\nand returned home after ravaging their land and killing some of the\ninhabitants.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VII\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n_Eighteenth and Nineteenth Years of the War--Arrival of Gylippus at\nSyracuse--Fortification of Decelea--Successes of the Syracusans_\n\nAfter refitting their ships, Gylippus and Pythen coasted along from\nTarentum to Epizephyrian Locris. They now received the more correct\ninformation that Syracuse was not yet completely invested, but that\nit was still possible for an army arriving at Epipolae to effect an\nentrance; and they consulted, accordingly, whether they should keep\nSicily on their right and risk sailing in by sea, or, leaving it on\ntheir left, should first sail to Himera and, taking with them the\nHimeraeans and any others that might agree to join them, go to Syracuse\nby land. Finally they determined to sail for Himera, especially as the\nfour Athenian ships which Nicias had at length sent off, on hearing that\nthey were at Locris, had not yet arrived at Rhegium. Accordingly, before\nthese reached their post, the Peloponnesians crossed the strait and,\nafter touching at Rhegium and Messina, came to Himera. Arrived there,\nthey persuaded the Himeraeans to join in the war, and not only to go\nwith them themselves but to provide arms for the seamen from their\nvessels which they had drawn ashore at Himera; and they sent and\nappointed a place for the Selinuntines to meet them with all their\nforces. A few troops were also promised by the Geloans and some of the\nSicels, who were now ready to join them with much greater alacrity,\nowing to the recent death of Archonidas, a powerful Sicel king in that\nneighbourhood and friendly to Athens, and owing also to the vigour shown\nby Gylippus in coming from Lacedaemon. Gylippus now took with him about\nseven hundred of his sailors and marines, that number only having arms,\na thousand heavy infantry and light troops from Himera with a body of\na hundred horse, some light troops and cavalry from Selinus, a few\nGeloans, and Sicels numbering a thousand in all, and set out on his\nmarch for Syracuse.\n\nMeanwhile the Corinthian fleet from Leucas made all haste to arrive; and\none of their commanders, Gongylus, starting last with a single ship, was\nthe first to reach Syracuse, a little before Gylippus. Gongylus found\nthe Syracusans on the point of holding an assembly to consider whether\nthey should put an end to the war. This he prevented, and reassured\nthem by telling them that more vessels were still to arrive, and that\nGylippus, son of Cleandridas, had been dispatched by the Lacedaemonians\nto take the command. Upon this the Syracusans took courage, and\nimmediately marched out with all their forces to meet Gylippus, who they\nfound was now close at hand. Meanwhile Gylippus, after taking Ietae, a\nfort of the Sicels, on his way, formed his army in order of battle, and\nso arrived at Epipolae, and ascending by Euryelus, as the Athenians had\ndone at first, now advanced with the Syracusans against the Athenian\nlines. His arrival chanced at a critical moment. The Athenians had\nalready finished a double wall of six or seven furlongs to the great\nharbour, with the exception of a small portion next the sea, which they\nwere still engaged upon; and in the remainder of the circle towards\nTrogilus on the other sea, stones had been laid ready for building for\nthe greater part of the distance, and some points had been left half\nfinished, while others were entirely completed. The danger of Syracuse\nhad indeed been great.\n\nMeanwhile the Athenians, recovering from the confusion into which\nthey had been first thrown by the sudden approach of Gylippus and\nthe Syracusans, formed in order of battle. Gylippus halted at a short\ndistance off and sent on a herald to tell them that, if they would\nevacuate Sicily with bag and baggage within five days' time, he\nwas willing to make a truce accordingly. The Athenians treated this\nproposition with contempt, and dismissed the herald without an answer.\nAfter this both sides began to prepare for action. Gylippus, observing\nthat the Syracusans were in disorder and did not easily fall into line,\ndrew off his troops more into the open ground, while Nicias did not lead\non the Athenians but lay still by his own wall. When Gylippus saw that\nthey did not come on, he led off his army to the citadel of the quarter\nof Apollo Temenites, and passed the night there. On the following day\nhe led out the main body of his army, and, drawing them up in order of\nbattle before the walls of the Athenians to prevent their going to the\nrelief of any other quarter, dispatched a strong force against Fort\nLabdalum, and took it, and put all whom he found in it to the sword,\nthe place not being within sight of the Athenians. On the same day an\nAthenian galley that lay moored off the harbour was captured by the\nSyracusans.\n\nAfter this the Syracusans and their allies began to carry a single wall,\nstarting from the city, in a slanting direction up Epipolae, in order\nthat the Athenians, unless they could hinder the work, might be no\nlonger able to invest them. Meanwhile the Athenians, having now finished\ntheir wall down to the sea, had come up to the heights; and part of\ntheir wall being weak, Gylippus drew out his army by night and attacked\nit. However, the Athenians who happened to be bivouacking outside took\nthe alarm and came out to meet him, upon seeing which he quickly led his\nmen back again. The Athenians now built their wall higher, and in future\nkept guard at this point themselves, disposing their confederates along\nthe remainder of the works, at the stations assigned to them. Nicias\nalso determined to fortify Plemmyrium, a promontory over against the\ncity, which juts out and narrows the mouth of the Great Harbour. He\nthought that the fortification of this place would make it easier to\nbring in supplies, as they would be able to carry on their blockade from\na less distance, near to the port occupied by the Syracusans; instead\nof being obliged, upon every movement of the enemy's navy, to put out\nagainst them from the bottom of the great harbour. Besides this, he now\nbegan to pay more attention to the war by sea, seeing that the coming\nof Gylippus had diminished their hopes by land. Accordingly, he conveyed\nover his ships and some troops, and built three forts in which he placed\nmost of his baggage, and moored there for the future the larger craft\nand men-of-war. This was the first and chief occasion of the losses\nwhich the crews experienced. The water which they used was scarce\nand had to be fetched from far, and the sailors could not go out for\nfirewood without being cut off by the Syracusan horse, who were masters\nof the country; a third of the enemy's cavalry being stationed at the\nlittle town of Olympieum, to prevent plundering incursions on the part\nof the Athenians at Plemmyrium. Meanwhile Nicias learned that the rest\nof the Corinthian fleet was approaching, and sent twenty ships to watch\nfor them, with orders to be on the look-out for them about Locris and\nRhegium and the approach to Sicily.\n\nGylippus, meanwhile, went on with the wall across Epipolae, using the\nstones which the Athenians had laid down for their own wall, and at the\nsame time constantly led out the Syracusans and their allies, and formed\nthem in order of battle in front of the lines, the Athenians forming\nagainst him. At last he thought that the moment was come, and began the\nattack; and a hand-to-hand fight ensued between the lines, where the\nSyracusan cavalry could be of no use; and the Syracusans and their\nallies were defeated and took up their dead under truce, while the\nAthenians erected a trophy. After this Gylippus called the soldiers\ntogether, and said that the fault was not theirs but his; he had kept\ntheir lines too much within the works, and had thus deprived them of\nthe services of their cavalry and darters. He would now, therefore, lead\nthem on a second time. He begged them to remember that in material force\nthey would be fully a match for their opponents, while, with respect\nto moral advantages, it were intolerable if Peloponnesians and Dorians\nshould not feel confident of overcoming Ionians and islanders with the\nmotley rabble that accompanied them, and of driving them out of the\ncountry.\n\nAfter this he embraced the first opportunity that offered of again\nleading them against the enemy. Now Nicias and the Athenians held the\nopinion that even if the Syracusans should not wish to offer battle, it\nwas necessary for them to prevent the building of the cross wall, as it\nalready almost overlapped the extreme point of their own, and if it went\nany further it would from that moment make no difference whether they\nfought ever so many successful actions, or never fought at all. They\naccordingly came out to meet the Syracusans. Gylippus led out his heavy\ninfantry further from the fortifications than on the former occasion,\nand so joined battle; posting his horse and darters upon the flank\nof the Athenians in the open space, where the works of the two walls\nterminated. During the engagement the cavalry attacked and routed the\nleft wing of the Athenians, which was opposed to them; and the rest\nof the Athenian army was in consequence defeated by the Syracusans and\ndriven headlong within their lines. The night following the Syracusans\ncarried their wall up to the Athenian works and passed them, thus\nputting it out of their power any longer to stop them, and depriving\nthem, even if victorious in the field, of all chance of investing the\ncity for the future.\n\nAfter this the remaining twelve vessels of the Corinthians, Ambraciots,\nand Leucadians sailed into the harbour under the command of Erasinides,\na Corinthian, having eluded the Athenian ships on guard, and helped\nthe Syracusans in completing the remainder of the cross wall. Meanwhile\nGylippus went into the rest of Sicily to raise land and naval forces,\nand also to bring over any of the cities that either were lukewarm in\nthe cause or had hitherto kept out of the war altogether. Syracusan and\nCorinthian envoys were also dispatched to Lacedaemon and Corinth to get\na fresh force sent over, in any way that might offer, either in\nmerchant vessels or transports, or in any other manner likely to prove\nsuccessful, as the Athenians too were sending for reinforcements; while\nthe Syracusans proceeded to man a fleet and to exercise, meaning to\ntry their fortune in this way also, and generally became exceedingly\nconfident.\n\nNicias perceiving this, and seeing the strength of the enemy and his\nown difficulties daily increasing, himself also sent to Athens. He had\nbefore sent frequent reports of events as they occurred, and felt it\nespecially incumbent upon him to do so now, as he thought that they were\nin a critical position, and that, unless speedily recalled or strongly\nreinforced from home, they had no hope of safety. He feared, however,\nthat the messengers, either through inability to speak, or through\nfailure of memory, or from a wish to please the multitude, might not\nreport the truth, and so thought it best to write a letter, to ensure\nthat the Athenians should know his own opinion without its being lost in\ntransmission, and be able to decide upon the real facts of the case.\n\nHis emissaries, accordingly, departed with the letter and the requisite\nverbal instructions; and he attended to the affairs of the army, making\nit his aim now to keep on the defensive and to avoid any unnecessary\ndanger.\n\nAt the close of the same summer the Athenian general Euetion marched\nin concert with Perdiccas with a large body of Thracians against\nAmphipolis, and failing to take it brought some galleys round into\nthe Strymon, and blockaded the town from the river, having his base at\nHimeraeum.\n\nSummer was now over. The winter ensuing, the persons sent by Nicias,\nreaching Athens, gave the verbal messages which had been entrusted to\nthem, and answered any questions that were asked them, and delivered\nthe letter. The clerk of the city now came forward and read out to the\nAthenians the letter, which was as follows:\n\n\"Our past operations, Athenians, have been made known to you by many\nother letters; it is now time for you to become equally familiar with\nour present condition, and to take your measures accordingly. We had\ndefeated in most of our engagements with them the Syracusans, against\nwhom we were sent, and we had built the works which we now occupy, when\nGylippus arrived from Lacedaemon with an army obtained from Peloponnese\nand from some of the cities in Sicily. In our first battle with him we\nwere victorious; in the battle on the following day we were overpowered\nby a multitude of cavalry and darters, and compelled to retire within\nour lines. We have now, therefore, been forced by the numbers of those\nopposed to us to discontinue the work of circumvallation, and to remain\ninactive; being unable to make use even of all the force we have, since\na large portion of our heavy infantry is absorbed in the defence of our\nlines. Meanwhile the enemy have carried a single wall past our lines,\nthus making it impossible for us to invest them in future, until this\ncross wall be attacked by a strong force and captured. So that the\nbesieger in name has become, at least from the land side, the besieged\nin reality; as we are prevented by their cavalry from even going for any\ndistance into the country.\n\n\"Besides this, an embassy has been dispatched to Peloponnese to procure\nreinforcements, and Gylippus has gone to the cities in Sicily, partly\nin the hope of inducing those that are at present neutral to join him in\nthe war, partly of bringing from his allies additional contingents for\nthe land forces and material for the navy. For I understand that they\ncontemplate a combined attack, upon our lines with their land forces and\nwith their fleet by sea. You must none of you be surprised that I say by\nsea also. They have discovered that the length of the time we have now\nbeen in commission has rotted our ships and wasted our crews, and that\nwith the entireness of our crews and the soundness of our ships the\npristine efficiency of our navy has departed. For it is impossible\nfor us to haul our ships ashore and careen them, because, the\nenemy's vessels being as many or more than our own, we are constantly\nanticipating an attack. Indeed, they may be seen exercising, and it lies\nwith them to take the initiative; and not having to maintain a blockade,\nthey have greater facilities for drying their ships.\n\n\"This we should scarcely be able to do, even if we had plenty of ships\nto spare, and were freed from our present necessity of exhausting all\nour strength upon the blockade. For it is already difficult to carry\nin supplies past Syracuse; and were we to relax our vigilance in the\nslightest degree it would become impossible. The losses which our crews\nhave suffered and still continue to suffer arise from the following\ncauses. Expeditions for fuel and for forage, and the distance from\nwhich water has to be fetched, cause our sailors to be cut off by the\nSyracusan cavalry; the loss of our previous superiority emboldens our\nslaves to desert; our foreign seamen are impressed by the unexpected\nappearance of a navy against us, and the strength of the enemy's\nresistance; such of them as were pressed into the service take the\nfirst opportunity of departing to their respective cities; such as were\noriginally seduced by the temptation of high pay, and expected little\nfighting and large gains, leave us either by desertion to the enemy\nor by availing themselves of one or other of the various facilities of\nescape which the magnitude of Sicily affords them. Some even engage in\ntrade themselves and prevail upon the captains to take Hyccaric slaves\non board in their place; thus they have ruined the efficiency of our\nnavy.\n\n\"Now I need not remind you that the time during which a crew is in its\nprime is short, and that the number of sailors who can start a ship on\nher way and keep the rowing in time is small. But by far my greatest\ntrouble is, that holding the post which I do, I am prevented by the\nnatural indocility of the Athenian seaman from putting a stop to these\nevils; and that meanwhile we have no source from which to recruit our\ncrews, which the enemy can do from many quarters, but are compelled to\ndepend both for supplying the crews in service and for making good\nour losses upon the men whom we brought with us. For our present\nconfederates, Naxos and Catana, are incapable of supplying us. There is\nonly one thing more wanting to our opponents, I mean the defection of\nour Italian markets. If they were to see you neglect to relieve us from\nour present condition, and were to go over to the enemy, famine would\ncompel us to evacuate, and Syracuse would finish the war without a blow.\n\n\"I might, it is true, have written to you something different and\nmore agreeable than this, but nothing certainly more useful, if it is\ndesirable for you to know the real state of things here before taking\nyour measures. Besides I know that it is your nature to love to be\ntold the best side of things, and then to blame the teller if the\nexpectations which he has raised in your minds are not answered by the\nresult; and I therefore thought it safest to declare to you the truth.\n\n\"Now you are not to think that either your generals or your soldiers\nhave ceased to be a match for the forces originally opposed to them.\nBut you are to reflect that a general Sicilian coalition is being formed\nagainst us; that a fresh army is expected from Peloponnese, while the\nforce we have here is unable to cope even with our present antagonists;\nand you must promptly decide either to recall us or to send out to us\nanother fleet and army as numerous again, with a large sum of money,\nand someone to succeed me, as a disease in the kidneys unfits me for\nretaining my post. I have, I think, some claim on your indulgence, as\nwhile I was in my prime I did you much good service in my commands. But\nwhatever you mean to do, do it at the commencement of spring and without\ndelay, as the enemy will obtain his Sicilian reinforcements shortly,\nthose from Peloponnese after a longer interval; and unless you attend\nto the matter the former will be here before you, while the latter will\nelude you as they have done before.\"\n\nSuch were the contents of Nicias's letter. When the Athenians had heard\nit they refused to accept his resignation, but chose him two colleagues,\nnaming Menander and Euthydemus, two of the officers at the seat of war,\nto fill their places until their arrival, that Nicias might not be left\nalone in his sickness to bear the whole weight of affairs. They also\nvoted to send out another army and navy, drawn partly from the Athenians\non the muster-roll, partly from the allies. The colleagues chosen for\nNicias were Demosthenes, son of Alcisthenes, and Eurymedon, son of\nThucles. Eurymedon was sent off at once, about the time of the winter\nsolstice, with ten ships, a hundred and twenty talents of silver, and\ninstructions to tell the army that reinforcements would arrive, and that\ncare would be taken of them; but Demosthenes stayed behind to organize\nthe expedition, meaning to start as soon as it was spring, and sent for\ntroops to the allies, and meanwhile got together money, ships, and heavy\ninfantry at home.\n\nThe Athenians also sent twenty vessels round Peloponnese to prevent\nany one crossing over to Sicily from Corinth or Peloponnese. For the\nCorinthians, filled with confidence by the favourable alteration in\nSicilian affairs which had been reported by the envoys upon their\narrival, and convinced that the fleet which they had before sent out\nhad not been without its use, were now preparing to dispatch a force of\nheavy infantry in merchant vessels to Sicily, while the Lacedaemonians\ndid the like for the rest of Peloponnese. The Corinthians also manned\na fleet of twenty-five vessels, intending to try the result of a battle\nwith the squadron on guard at Naupactus, and meanwhile to make it\nless easy for the Athenians there to hinder the departure of their\nmerchantmen, by obliging them to keep an eye upon the galleys thus\narrayed against them.\n\nIn the meantime the Lacedaemonians prepared for their invasion of\nAttica, in accordance with their own previous resolve, and at the\ninstigation of the Syracusans and Corinthians, who wished for an\ninvasion to arrest the reinforcements which they heard that Athens\nwas about to send to Sicily. Alcibiades also urgently advised the\nfortification of Decelea, and a vigorous prosecution of the war. But the\nLacedaemonians derived most encouragement from the belief that\nAthens, with two wars on her hands, against themselves and against the\nSiceliots, would be more easy to subdue, and from the conviction that\nshe had been the first to infringe the truce. In the former war, they\nconsidered, the offence had been more on their own side, both on account\nof the entrance of the Thebans into Plataea in time of peace, and also\nof their own refusal to listen to the Athenian offer of arbitration, in\nspite of the clause in the former treaty that where arbitration should\nbe offered there should be no appeal to arms. For this reason they\nthought that they deserved their misfortunes, and took to heart\nseriously the disaster at Pylos and whatever else had befallen them.\nBut when, besides the ravages from Pylos, which went on without any\nintermission, the thirty Athenian ships came out from Argos and wasted\npart of Epidaurus, Prasiae, and other places; when upon every dispute\nthat arose as to the interpretation of any doubtful point in the treaty,\ntheir own offers of arbitration were always rejected by the Athenians,\nthe Lacedaemonians at length decided that Athens had now committed the\nvery same offence as they had before done, and had become the guilty\nparty; and they began to be full of ardour for the war. They spent this\nwinter in sending round to their allies for iron, and in getting ready\nthe other implements for building their fort; and meanwhile began\nraising at home, and also by forced requisitions in the rest of\nPeloponnese, a force to be sent out in the merchantmen to their allies\nin Sicily. Winter thus ended, and with it the eighteenth year of this\nwar of which Thucydides is the historian.\n\nIn the first days of the spring following, at an earlier period than\nusual, the Lacedaemonians and their allies invaded Attica, under the\ncommand of Agis, son of Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians. They\nbegan by devastating the parts bordering upon the plain, and next\nproceeded to fortify Decelea, dividing the work among the different\ncities. Decelea is about thirteen or fourteen miles from the city of\nAthens, and the same distance or not much further from Boeotia; and the\nfort was meant to annoy the plain and the richest parts of the country,\nbeing in sight of Athens. While the Peloponnesians and their allies in\nAttica were engaged in the work of fortification, their countrymen\nat home sent off, at about the same time, the heavy infantry in the\nmerchant vessels to Sicily; the Lacedaemonians furnishing a picked force\nof Helots and Neodamodes (or freedmen), six hundred heavy infantry in\nall, under the command of Eccritus, a Spartan; and the Boeotians three\nhundred heavy infantry, commanded by two Thebans, Xenon and Nicon, and\nby Hegesander, a Thespian. These were among the first to put out into\nthe open sea, starting from Taenarus in Laconia. Not long after their\ndeparture the Corinthians sent off a force of five hundred heavy\ninfantry, consisting partly of men from Corinth itself, and partly\nof Arcadian mercenaries, placed under the command of Alexarchus, a\nCorinthian. The Sicyonians also sent off two hundred heavy infantry at\nsame time as the Corinthians, under the command of Sargeus, a Sicyonian.\nMeantime the five-and-twenty vessels manned by Corinth during the winter\nlay confronting the twenty Athenian ships at Naupactus until the heavy\ninfantry in the merchantmen were fairly on their way from Peloponnese;\nthus fulfilling the object for which they had been manned originally,\nwhich was to divert the attention of the Athenians from the merchantmen\nto the galleys.\n\nDuring this time the Athenians were not idle. Simultaneously with the\nfortification of Decelea, at the very beginning of spring, they sent\nthirty ships round Peloponnese, under Charicles, son of Apollodorus,\nwith instructions to call at Argos and demand a force of their heavy\ninfantry for the fleet, agreeably to the alliance. At the same time\nthey dispatched Demosthenes to Sicily, as they had intended, with sixty\nAthenian and five Chian vessels, twelve hundred Athenian heavy infantry\nfrom the muster-roll, and as many of the islanders as could be raised\nin the different quarters, drawing upon the other subject allies for\nwhatever they could supply that would be of use for the war. Demosthenes\nwas instructed first to sail round with Charicles and to operate with\nhim upon the coasts of Laconia, and accordingly sailed to Aegina and\nthere waited for the remainder of his armament, and for Charicles to\nfetch the Argive troops.\n\nIn Sicily, about the same time in this spring, Gylippus came to Syracuse\nwith as many troops as he could bring from the cities which he had\npersuaded to join. Calling the Syracusans together, he told them\nthat they must man as many ships as possible, and try their hand at\na sea-fight, by which he hoped to achieve an advantage in the war not\nunworthy of the risk. With him Hermocrates actively joined in trying to\nencourage his countrymen to attack the Athenians at sea, saying that the\nlatter had not inherited their naval prowess nor would they retain\nit for ever; they had been landsmen even to a greater degree than the\nSyracusans, and had only become a maritime power when obliged by the\nMede. Besides, to daring spirits like the Athenians, a daring adversary\nwould seem the most formidable; and the Athenian plan of paralysing by\nthe boldness of their attack a neighbour often not their inferior in\nstrength could now be used against them with as good effect by the\nSyracusans. He was convinced also that the unlooked-for spectacle of\nSyracusans daring to face the Athenian navy would cause a terror to the\nenemy, the advantages of which would far outweigh any loss that Athenian\nscience might inflict upon their inexperience. He accordingly urged\nthem to throw aside their fears and to try their fortune at sea; and the\nSyracusans, under the influence of Gylippus and Hermocrates, and perhaps\nsome others, made up their minds for the sea-fight and began to man\ntheir vessels.\n\nWhen the fleet was ready, Gylippus led out the whole army by night; his\nplan being to assault in person the forts on Plemmyrium by land, while\nthirty-five Syracusan galleys sailed according to appointment against\nthe enemy from the great harbour, and the forty-five remaining came\nround from the lesser harbour, where they had their arsenal, in order\nto effect a junction with those inside and simultaneously to attack\nPlemmyrium, and thus to distract the Athenians by assaulting them on\ntwo sides at once. The Athenians quickly manned sixty ships, and with\ntwenty-five of these engaged the thirty-five of the Syracusans in the\ngreat harbour, sending the rest to meet those sailing round from the\narsenal; and an action now ensued directly in front of the mouth of the\ngreat harbour, maintained with equal tenacity on both sides; the one\nwishing to force the passage, the other to prevent them.\n\nIn the meantime, while the Athenians in Plemmyrium were down at the sea,\nattending to the engagement, Gylippus made a sudden attack on the forts\nin the early morning and took the largest first, and afterwards the two\nsmaller, whose garrisons did not wait for him, seeing the largest\nso easily taken. At the fall of the first fort, the men from it who\nsucceeded in taking refuge in their boats and merchantmen, found great\ndifficulty in reaching the camp, as the Syracusans were having the best\nof it in the engagement in the great harbour, and sent a fast-sailing\ngalley to pursue them. But when the two others fell, the Syracusans were\nnow being defeated; and the fugitives from these sailed alongshore with\nmore ease. The Syracusan ships fighting off the mouth of the harbour\nforced their way through the Athenian vessels and sailing in without\nany order fell foul of one another, and transferred the victory to the\nAthenians; who not only routed the squadron in question, but also that\nby which they were at first being defeated in the harbour, sinking\neleven of the Syracusan vessels and killing most of the men, except\nthe crews of three ships whom they made prisoners. Their own loss was\nconfined to three vessels; and after hauling ashore the Syracusan wrecks\nand setting up a trophy upon the islet in front of Plemmyrium, they\nretired to their own camp.\n\nUnsuccessful at sea, the Syracusans had nevertheless the forts in\nPlemmyrium, for which they set up three trophies. One of the two last\ntaken they razed, but put in order and garrisoned the two others. In the\ncapture of the forts a great many men were killed and made prisoners,\nand a great quantity of property was taken in all. As the Athenians had\nused them as a magazine, there was a large stock of goods and corn of\nthe merchants inside, and also a large stock belonging to the captains;\nthe masts and other furniture of forty galleys being taken, besides\nthree galleys which had been drawn up on shore. Indeed the first and\nchiefest cause of the ruin of the Athenian army was the capture of\nPlemmyrium; even the entrance of the harbour being now no longer safe\nfor carrying in provisions, as the Syracusan vessels were stationed\nthere to prevent it, and nothing could be brought in without fighting;\nbesides the general impression of dismay and discouragement produced\nupon the army.\n\nAfter this the Syracusans sent out twelve ships under the command\nof Agatharchus, a Syracusan. One of these went to Peloponnese with\nambassadors to describe the hopeful state of their affairs, and to\nincite the Peloponnesians to prosecute the war there even more actively\nthan they were now doing, while the eleven others sailed to Italy,\nhearing that vessels laden with stores were on their way to the\nAthenians. After falling in with and destroying most of the vessels in\nquestion, and burning in the Caulonian territory a quantity of timber\nfor shipbuilding, which had been got ready for the Athenians, the\nSyracusan squadron went to Locri, and one of the merchantmen from\nPeloponnese coming in, while they were at anchor there, carrying\nThespian heavy infantry, took these on board and sailed alongshore\ntowards home. The Athenians were on the look-out for them with twenty\nships at Megara, but were only able to take one vessel with its crew;\nthe rest getting clear off to Syracuse. There was also some skirmishing\nin the harbour about the piles which the Syracusans had driven in the\nsea in front of the old docks, to allow their ships to lie at anchor\ninside, without being hurt by the Athenians sailing up and running them\ndown. The Athenians brought up to them a ship of ten thousand talents\nburden furnished with wooden turrets and screens, and fastened ropes\nround the piles from their boats, wrenched them up and broke them, or\ndived down and sawed them in two. Meanwhile the Syracusans plied them\nwith missiles from the docks, to which they replied from their large\nvessel; until at last most of the piles were removed by the Athenians.\nBut the most awkward part of the stockade was the part out of sight:\nsome of the piles which had been driven in did not appear above water,\nso that it was dangerous to sail up, for fear of running the ships upon\nthem, just as upon a reef, through not seeing them. However divers went\ndown and sawed off even these for reward; although the Syracusans drove\nin others. Indeed there was no end to the contrivances to which they\nresorted against each other, as might be expected between two hostile\narmies confronting each other at such a short distance: and skirmishes\nand all kinds of other attempts were of constant occurrence. Meanwhile\nthe Syracusans sent embassies to the cities, composed of Corinthians,\nAmbraciots, and Lacedaemonians, to tell them of the capture of\nPlemmyrium, and that their defeat in the sea-fight was due less to the\nstrength of the enemy than to their own disorder; and generally, to let\nthem know that they were full of hope, and to desire them to come to\ntheir help with ships and troops, as the Athenians were expected with a\nfresh army, and if the one already there could be destroyed before the\nother arrived, the war would be at an end.\n\nWhile the contending parties in Sicily were thus engaged, Demosthenes,\nhaving now got together the armament with which he was to go to the\nisland, put out from Aegina, and making sail for Peloponnese, joined\nCharicles and the thirty ships of the Athenians. Taking on board the\nheavy infantry from Argos they sailed to Laconia, and, after first\nplundering part of Epidaurus Limera, landed on the coast of Laconia,\nopposite Cythera, where the temple of Apollo stands, and, laying waste\npart of the country, fortified a sort of isthmus, to which the Helots of\nthe Lacedaemonians might desert, and from whence plundering incursions\nmight be made as from Pylos. Demosthenes helped to occupy this place,\nand then immediately sailed on to Corcyra to take up some of the\nallies in that island, and so to proceed without delay to Sicily; while\nCharicles waited until he had completed the fortification of the place\nand, leaving a garrison there, returned home subsequently with his\nthirty ships and the Argives also.\n\nThis same summer arrived at Athens thirteen hundred targeteers, Thracian\nswordsmen of the tribe of the Dii, who were to have sailed to Sicily\nwith Demosthenes. Since they had come too late, the Athenians determined\nto send them back to Thrace, whence they had come; to keep them for\nthe Decelean war appearing too expensive, as the pay of each man was\na drachma a day. Indeed since Decelea had been first fortified by the\nwhole Peloponnesian army during this summer, and then occupied for the\nannoyance of the country by the garrisons from the cities relieving\neach other at stated intervals, it had been doing great mischief to the\nAthenians; in fact this occupation, by the destruction of property and\nloss of men which resulted from it, was one of the principal causes of\ntheir ruin. Previously the invasions were short, and did not prevent\ntheir enjoying their land during the rest of the time: the enemy was now\npermanently fixed in Attica; at one time it was an attack in force, at\nanother it was the regular garrison overrunning the country and making\nforays for its subsistence, and the Lacedaemonian king, Agis, was in the\nfield and diligently prosecuting the war; great mischief was therefore\ndone to the Athenians. They were deprived of their whole country: more\nthan twenty thousand slaves had deserted, a great part of them artisans,\nand all their sheep and beasts of burden were lost; and as the cavalry\nrode out daily upon excursions to Decelea and to guard the country,\ntheir horses were either lamed by being constantly worked upon rocky\nground, or wounded by the enemy.\n\nBesides, the transport of provisions from Euboea, which had before been\ncarried on so much more quickly overland by Decelea from Oropus, was now\neffected at great cost by sea round Sunium; everything the city required\nhad to be imported from abroad, and instead of a city it became a\nfortress. Summer and winter the Athenians were worn out by having to\nkeep guard on the fortifications, during the day by turns, by night all\ntogether, the cavalry excepted, at the different military posts or upon\nthe wall. But what most oppressed them was that they had two wars at\nonce, and had thus reached a pitch of frenzy which no one would have\nbelieved possible if he had heard of it before it had come to pass.\nFor could any one have imagined that even when besieged by the\nPeloponnesians entrenched in Attica, they would still, instead of\nwithdrawing from Sicily, stay on there besieging in like manner\nSyracuse, a town (taken as a town) in no way inferior to Athens, or\nwould so thoroughly upset the Hellenic estimate of their strength and\naudacity, as to give the spectacle of a people which, at the beginning\nof the war, some thought might hold out one year, some two, none more\nthan three, if the Peloponnesians invaded their country, now seventeen\nyears after the first invasion, after having already suffered from all\nthe evils of war, going to Sicily and undertaking a new war nothing\ninferior to that which they already had with the Peloponnesians? These\ncauses, the great losses from Decelea, and the other heavy charges that\nfell upon them, produced their financial embarrassment; and it was at\nthis time that they imposed upon their subjects, instead of the tribute,\nthe tax of a twentieth upon all imports and exports by sea, which they\nthought would bring them in more money; their expenditure being now not\nthe same as at first, but having grown with the war while their revenues\ndecayed.\n\nAccordingly, not wishing to incur expense in their present want of\nmoney, they sent back at once the Thracians who came too late for\nDemosthenes, under the conduct of Diitrephes, who was instructed, as\nthey were to pass through the Euripus, to make use of them if possible\nin the voyage alongshore to injure the enemy. Diitrephes first landed\nthem at Tanagra and hastily snatched some booty; he then sailed across\nthe Euripus in the evening from Chalcis in Euboea and disembarking in\nBoeotia led them against Mycalessus. The night he passed unobserved\nnear the temple of Hermes, not quite two miles from Mycalessus, and\nat daybreak assaulted and took the town, which is not a large one; the\ninhabitants being off their guard and not expecting that any one would\never come up so far from the sea to molest them, the wall too being\nweak, and in some places having tumbled down, while in others it had\nnot been built to any height, and the gates also being left open through\ntheir feeling of security. The Thracians bursting into Mycalessus sacked\nthe houses and temples, and butchered the inhabitants, sparing neither\nyouth nor age, but killing all they fell in with, one after the other,\nchildren and women, and even beasts of burden, and whatever other\nliving creatures they saw; the Thracian race, like the bloodiest of the\nbarbarians, being even more so when it has nothing to fear. Everywhere\nconfusion reigned and death in all its shapes; and in particular they\nattacked a boys' school, the largest that there was in the place, into\nwhich the children had just gone, and massacred them all. In short, the\ndisaster falling upon the whole town was unsurpassed in magnitude, and\nunapproached by any in suddenness and in horror.\n\nMeanwhile the Thebans heard of it and marched to the rescue, and\novertaking the Thracians before they had gone far, recovered the plunder\nand drove them in panic to the Euripus and the sea, where the vessels\nwhich brought them were lying. The greatest slaughter took place while\nthey were embarking, as they did not know how to swim, and those in\nthe vessels on seeing what was going on on on shore moored them out\nof bowshot: in the rest of the retreat the Thracians made a very\nrespectable defence against the Theban horse, by which they were first\nattacked, dashing out and closing their ranks according to the tactics\nof their country, and lost only a few men in that part of the affair. A\ngood number who were after plunder were actually caught in the town and\nput to death. Altogether the Thracians had two hundred and fifty killed\nout of thirteen hundred, the Thebans and the rest who came to the rescue\nabout twenty, troopers and heavy infantry, with Scirphondas, one of\nthe Boeotarchs. The Mycalessians lost a large proportion of their\npopulation.\n\nWhile Mycalessus thus experienced a calamity for its extent as\nlamentable as any that happened in the war, Demosthenes, whom we left\nsailing to Corcyra, after the building of the fort in Laconia, found\na merchantman lying at Phea in Elis, in which the Corinthian heavy\ninfantry were to cross to Sicily. The ship he destroyed, but the men\nescaped, and subsequently got another in which they pursued their\nvoyage. After this, arriving at Zacynthus and Cephallenia, he took a\nbody of heavy infantry on board, and sending for some of the Messenians\nfrom Naupactus, crossed over to the opposite coast of Acarnania, to\nAlyzia, and to Anactorium which was held by the Athenians. While he was\nin these parts he was met by Eurymedon returning from Sicily, where he\nhad been sent, as has been mentioned, during the winter, with the money\nfor the army, who told him the news, and also that he had heard, while\nat sea, that the Syracusans had taken Plemmyrium. Here, also, Conon\ncame to them, the commander at Naupactus, with news that the twenty-five\nCorinthian ships stationed opposite to him, far from giving over the\nwar, were meditating an engagement; and he therefore begged them to send\nhim some ships, as his own eighteen were not a match for the enemy's\ntwenty-five. Demosthenes and Eurymedon, accordingly, sent ten of their\nbest sailers with Conon to reinforce the squadron at Naupactus, and\nmeanwhile prepared for the muster of their forces; Eurymedon, who was\nnow the colleague of Demosthenes, and had turned back in consequence of\nhis appointment, sailing to Corcyra to tell them to man fifteen ships\nand to enlist heavy infantry; while Demosthenes raised slingers and\ndarters from the parts about Acarnania.\n\nMeanwhile the envoys, already mentioned, who had gone from Syracuse\nto the cities after the capture of Plemmyrium, had succeeded in their\nmission, and were about to bring the army that they had collected, when\nNicias got scent of it, and sent to the Centoripae and Alicyaeans and\nother of the friendly Sicels, who held the passes, not to let the enemy\nthrough, but to combine to prevent their passing, there being no other\nway by which they could even attempt it, as the Agrigentines would not\ngive them a passage through their country. Agreeably to this request the\nSicels laid a triple ambuscade for the Siceliots upon their march,\nand attacking them suddenly, while off their guard, killed about eight\nhundred of them and all the envoys, the Corinthian only excepted, by\nwhom fifteen hundred who escaped were conducted to Syracuse.\n\nAbout the same time the Camarinaeans also came to the assistance of\nSyracuse with five hundred heavy infantry, three hundred darters, and as\nmany archers, while the Geloans sent crews for five ships, four hundred\ndarters, and two hundred horse. Indeed almost the whole of Sicily,\nexcept the Agrigentines, who were neutral, now ceased merely to watch\nevents as it had hitherto done, and actively joined Syracuse against the\nAthenians.\n\nWhile the Syracusans after the Sicel disaster put off any immediate\nattack upon the Athenians, Demosthenes and Eurymedon, whose forces from\nCorcyra and the continent were now ready, crossed the Ionian Gulf with\nall their armament to the Iapygian promontory, and starting from thence\ntouched at the Choerades Isles lying off Iapygia, where they took on\nboard a hundred and fifty Iapygian darters of the Messapian tribe, and\nafter renewing an old friendship with Artas the chief, who had furnished\nthem with the darters, arrived at Metapontium in Italy. Here they\npersuaded their allies the Metapontines to send with them three hundred\ndarters and two galleys, and with this reinforcement coasted on to\nThurii, where they found the party hostile to Athens recently expelled\nby a revolution, and accordingly remained there to muster and review the\nwhole army, to see if any had been left behind, and to prevail upon\nthe Thurians resolutely to join them in their expedition, and in the\ncircumstances in which they found themselves to conclude a defensive and\noffensive alliance with the Athenians.\n\nAbout the same time the Peloponnesians in the twenty-five ships\nstationed opposite to the squadron at Naupactus to protect the passage\nof the transports to Sicily had got ready for engaging, and manning\nsome additional vessels, so as to be numerically little inferior to the\nAthenians, anchored off Erineus in Achaia in the Rhypic country. The\nplace off which they lay being in the form of a crescent, the land\nforces furnished by the Corinthians and their allies on the spot came\nup and ranged themselves upon the projecting headlands on either side,\nwhile the fleet, under the command of Polyanthes, a Corinthian, held\nthe intervening space and blocked up the entrance. The Athenians under\nDiphilus now sailed out against them with thirty-three ships from\nNaupactus, and the Corinthians, at first not moving, at length thought\nthey saw their opportunity, raised the signal, and advanced and engaged\nthe Athenians. After an obstinate struggle, the Corinthians lost three\nships, and without sinking any altogether, disabled seven of the enemy,\nwhich were struck prow to prow and had their foreships stove in by the\nCorinthian vessels, whose cheeks had been strengthened for this very\npurpose. After an action of this even character, in which either party\ncould claim the victory (although the Athenians became masters of the\nwrecks through the wind driving them out to sea, the Corinthians not\nputting out again to meet them), the two combatants parted. No pursuit\ntook place, and no prisoners were made on either side; the Corinthians\nand Peloponnesians who were fighting near the shore escaping with ease,\nand none of the Athenian vessels having been sunk. The Athenians now\nsailed back to Naupactus, and the Corinthians immediately set up a\ntrophy as victors, because they had disabled a greater number of the\nenemy's ships. Moreover they held that they had not been worsted, for\nthe very same reason that their opponent held that he had not been\nvictorious; the Corinthians considering that they were conquerors,\nif not decidedly conquered, and the Athenians thinking themselves\nvanquished, because not decidedly victorious. However, when the\nPeloponnesians sailed off and their land forces had dispersed, the\nAthenians also set up a trophy as victors in Achaia, about two miles and\na quarter from Erineus, the Corinthian station.\n\nThis was the termination of the action at Naupactus. To return to\nDemosthenes and Eurymedon: the Thurians having now got ready to join\nin the expedition with seven hundred heavy infantry and three hundred\ndarters, the two generals ordered the ships to sail along the coast to\nthe Crotonian territory, and meanwhile held a review of all the land\nforces upon the river Sybaris, and then led them through the Thurian\ncountry. Arrived at the river Hylias, they here received a message\nfrom the Crotonians, saying that they would not allow the army to pass\nthrough their country; upon which the Athenians descended towards the\nshore, and bivouacked near the sea and the mouth of the Hylias, where\nthe fleet also met them, and the next day embarked and sailed along the\ncoast touching at all the cities except Locri, until they came to Petra\nin the Rhegian territory.\n\nMeanwhile the Syracusans hearing of their approach resolved to make a\nsecond attempt with their fleet and their other forces on shore, which\nthey had been collecting for this very purpose in order to do something\nbefore their arrival. In addition to other improvements suggested by the\nformer sea-fight which they now adopted in the equipment of their navy,\nthey cut down their prows to a smaller compass to make them more\nsolid and made their cheeks stouter, and from these let stays into the\nvessels' sides for a length of six cubits within and without, in the\nsame way as the Corinthians had altered their prows before engaging the\nsquadron at Naupactus. The Syracusans thought that they would thus have\nan advantage over the Athenian vessels, which were not constructed with\nequal strength, but were slight in the bows, from their being more used\nto sail round and charge the enemy's side than to meet him prow to prow,\nand that the battle being in the great harbour, with a great many ships\nin not much room, was also a fact in their favour. Charging prow to\nprow, they would stave in the enemy's bows, by striking with solid and\nstout beaks against hollow and weak ones; and secondly, the Athenians\nfor want of room would be unable to use their favourite manoeuvre of\nbreaking the line or of sailing round, as the Syracusans would do their\nbest not to let them do the one, and want of room would prevent their\ndoing the other. This charging prow to prow, which had hitherto been\nthought want of skill in a helmsman, would be the Syracusans' chief\nmanoeuvre, as being that which they should find most useful, since the\nAthenians, if repulsed, would not be able to back water in any direction\nexcept towards the shore, and that only for a little way, and in the\nlittle space in front of their own camp. The rest of the harbour would\nbe commanded by the Syracusans; and the Athenians, if hard pressed, by\ncrowding together in a small space and all to the same point, would\nrun foul of one another and fall into disorder, which was, in fact, the\nthing that did the Athenians most harm in all the sea-fights, they not\nhaving, like the Syracusans, the whole harbour to retreat over. As to\ntheir sailing round into the open sea, this would be impossible, with\nthe Syracusans in possession of the way out and in, especially as\nPlemmyrium would be hostile to them, and the mouth of the harbour was\nnot large.\n\nWith these contrivances to suit their skill and ability, and now more\nconfident after the previous sea-fight, the Syracusans attacked by land\nand sea at once. The town force Gylippus led out a little the first and\nbrought them up to the wall of the Athenians, where it looked towards\nthe city, while the force from the Olympieum, that is to say, the heavy\ninfantry that were there with the horse and the light troops of the\nSyracusans, advanced against the wall from the opposite side; the ships\nof the Syracusans and allies sailing out immediately afterwards. The\nAthenians at first fancied that they were to be attacked by land\nonly, and it was not without alarm that they saw the fleet suddenly\napproaching as well; and while some were forming upon the walls and\nin front of them against the advancing enemy, and some marching out in\nhaste against the numbers of horse and darters coming from the Olympieum\nand from outside, others manned the ships or rushed down to the beach\nto oppose the enemy, and when the ships were manned put out with\nseventy-five sail against about eighty of the Syracusans.\n\nAfter spending a great part of the day in advancing and retreating\nand skirmishing with each other, without either being able to gain any\nadvantage worth speaking of, except that the Syracusans sank one or two\nof the Athenian vessels, they parted, the land force at the same time\nretiring from the lines. The next day the Syracusans remained quiet, and\ngave no signs of what they were going to do; but Nicias, seeing that the\nbattle had been a drawn one, and expecting that they would attack again,\ncompelled the captains to refit any of the ships that had suffered, and\nmoored merchant vessels before the stockade which they had driven\ninto the sea in front of their ships, to serve instead of an enclosed\nharbour, at about two hundred feet from each other, in order that any\nship that was hard pressed might be able to retreat in safety and sail\nout again at leisure. These preparations occupied the Athenians all day\nuntil nightfall.\n\nThe next day the Syracusans began operations at an earlier hour, but\nwith the same plan of attack by land and sea. A great part of the day\nthe rivals spent as before, confronting and skirmishing with each\nother; until at last Ariston, son of Pyrrhicus, a Corinthian, the ablest\nhelmsman in the Syracusan service, persuaded their naval commanders to\nsend to the officials in the city, and tell them to move the sale market\nas quickly as they could down to the sea, and oblige every one to\nbring whatever eatables he had and sell them there, thus enabling the\ncommanders to land the crews and dine at once close to the ships, and\nshortly afterwards, the selfsame day, to attack the Athenians again when\nthey were not expecting it.\n\nIn compliance with this advice a messenger was sent and the market got\nready, upon which the Syracusans suddenly backed water and withdrew to\nthe town, and at once landed and took their dinner upon the spot; while\nthe Athenians, supposing that they had returned to the town because\nthey felt they were beaten, disembarked at their leisure and set about\ngetting their dinners and about their other occupations, under the idea\nthat they done with fighting for that day. Suddenly the Syracusans had\nmanned their ships and again sailed against them; and the Athenians, in\ngreat confusion and most of them fasting, got on board, and with great\ndifficulty put out to meet them. For some time both parties remained on\nthe defensive without engaging, until the Athenians at last resolved not\nto let themselves be worn out by waiting where they were, but to attack\nwithout delay, and giving a cheer, went into action. The Syracusans\nreceived them, and charging prow to prow as they had intended, stove in\na great part of the Athenian foreships by the strength of their beaks;\nthe darters on the decks also did great damage to the Athenians, but\nstill greater damage was done by the Syracusans who went about in small\nboats, ran in upon the oars of the Athenian galleys, and sailed against\ntheir sides, and discharged from thence their darts upon the sailors.\n\nAt last, fighting hard in this fashion, the Syracusans gained the\nvictory, and the Athenians turned and fled between the merchantmen\nto their own station. The Syracusan ships pursued them as far as the\nmerchantmen, where they were stopped by the beams armed with dolphins\nsuspended from those vessels over the passage. Two of the Syracusan\nvessels went too near in the excitement of victory and were destroyed,\none of them being taken with its crew. After sinking seven of the\nAthenian vessels and disabling many, and taking most of the men\nprisoners and killing others, the Syracusans retired and set up trophies\nfor both the engagements, being now confident of having a decided\nsuperiority by sea, and by no means despairing of equal success by land.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n_Nineteenth Year of the War--Arrival of Demosthenes--Defeat of the\nAthenians at Epipolae--Folly and Obstinancy of Nicias_\n\nIn the meantime, while the Syracusans were preparing for a second attack\nupon both elements, Demosthenes and Eurymedon arrived with the succours\nfrom Athens, consisting of about seventy-three ships, including the\nforeigners; nearly five thousand heavy infantry, Athenian and allied;\na large number of darters, Hellenic and barbarian, and slingers and\narchers and everything else upon a corresponding scale. The Syracusans\nand their allies were for the moment not a little dismayed at the idea\nthat there was to be no term or ending to their dangers, seeing, in\nspite of the fortification of Decelea, a new army arrive nearly equal to\nthe former, and the power of Athens proving so great in every quarter.\nOn the other hand, the first Athenian armament regained a certain\nconfidence in the midst of its misfortunes. Demosthenes, seeing how\nmatters stood, felt that he could not drag on and fare as Nicias had\ndone, who by wintering in Catana instead of at once attacking Syracuse\nhad allowed the terror of his first arrival to evaporate in contempt,\nand had given time to Gylippus to arrive with a force from Peloponnese,\nwhich the Syracusans would never have sent for if he had attacked\nimmediately; for they fancied that they were a match for him by\nthemselves, and would not have discovered their inferiority until they\nwere already invested, and even if they then sent for succours, they\nwould no longer have been equally able to profit by their arrival.\nRecollecting this, and well aware that it was now on the first day\nafter his arrival that he like Nicias was most formidable to the enemy,\nDemosthenes determined to lose no time in drawing the utmost profit from\nthe consternation at the moment inspired by his army; and seeing that\nthe counterwall of the Syracusans, which hindered the Athenians from\ninvesting them, was a single one, and that he who should become master\nof the way up to Epipolae, and afterwards of the camp there, would find\nno difficulty in taking it, as no one would even wait for his attack,\nmade all haste to attempt the enterprise. This he took to be the\nshortest way of ending the war, as he would either succeed and take\nSyracuse, or would lead back the armament instead of frittering away the\nlives of the Athenians engaged in the expedition and the resources of\nthe country at large.\n\nFirst therefore the Athenians went out and laid waste the lands of the\nSyracusans about the Anapus and carried all before them as at first by\nland and by sea, the Syracusans not offering to oppose them upon\neither element, unless it were with their cavalry and darters from the\nOlympieum. Next Demosthenes resolved to attempt the counterwall first by\nmeans of engines. As however the engines that he brought up were burnt\nby the enemy fighting from the wall, and the rest of the forces repulsed\nafter attacking at many different points, he determined to delay\nno longer, and having obtained the consent of Nicias and his fellow\ncommanders, proceeded to put in execution his plan of attacking\nEpipolae. As by day it seemed impossible to approach and get up without\nbeing observed, he ordered provisions for five days, took all the masons\nand carpenters, and other things, such as arrows, and everything else\nthat they could want for the work of fortification if successful, and,\nafter the first watch, set out with Eurymedon and Menander and the whole\narmy for Epipolae, Nicias being left behind in the lines. Having come\nup by the hill of Euryelus (where the former army had ascended at first)\nunobserved by the enemy's guards, they went up to the fort which the\nSyracusans had there, and took it, and put to the sword part of the\ngarrison. The greater number, however, escaped at once and gave the\nalarm to the camps, of which there were three upon Epipolae, defended by\noutworks, one of the Syracusans, one of the other Siceliots, and one of\nthe allies; and also to the six hundred Syracusans forming the original\ngarrison for this part of Epipolae. These at once advanced against the\nassailants and, falling in with Demosthenes and the Athenians, were\nrouted by them after a sharp resistance, the victors immediately pushing\non, eager to achieve the objects of the attack without giving time for\ntheir ardour to cool; meanwhile others from the very beginning were\ntaking the counterwall of the Syracusans, which was abandoned by its\ngarrison, and pulling down the battlements. The Syracusans and the\nallies, and Gylippus with the troops under his command, advanced to the\nrescue from the outworks, but engaged in some consternation (a night\nattack being a piece of audacity which they had never expected), and\nwere at first compelled to retreat. But while the Athenians, flushed\nwith their victory, now advanced with less order, wishing to make their\nway as quickly as possible through the whole force of the enemy not yet\nengaged, without relaxing their attack or giving them time to rally, the\nBoeotians made the first stand against them, attacked them, routed them,\nand put them to flight.\n\nThe Athenians now fell into great disorder and perplexity, so that it\nwas not easy to get from one side or the other any detailed account\nof the affair. By day certainly the combatants have a clearer notion,\nthough even then by no means of all that takes place, no one knowing\nmuch of anything that does not go on in his own immediate neighbourhood;\nbut in a night engagement (and this was the only one that occurred\nbetween great armies during the war) how could any one know anything for\ncertain? Although there was a bright moon they saw each other only as\nmen do by moonlight, that is to say, they could distinguish the form of\nthe body, but could not tell for certain whether it was a friend or an\nenemy. Both had great numbers of heavy infantry moving about in a small\nspace. Some of the Athenians were already defeated, while others were\ncoming up yet unconquered for their first attack. A large part also\nof the rest of their forces either had only just got up, or were still\nascending, so that they did not know which way to march. Owing to the\nrout that had taken place all in front was now in confusion, and\nthe noise made it difficult to distinguish anything. The victorious\nSyracusans and allies were cheering each other on with loud cries, by\nnight the only possible means of communication, and meanwhile receiving\nall who came against them; while the Athenians were seeking for one\nanother, taking all in front of them for enemies, even although they\nmight be some of their now flying friends; and by constantly asking\nfor the watchword, which was their only means of recognition, not only\ncaused great confusion among themselves by asking all at once, but also\nmade it known to the enemy, whose own they did not so readily discover,\nas the Syracusans were victorious and not scattered, and thus less\neasily mistaken. The result was that if the Athenians fell in with a\nparty of the enemy that was weaker than they, it escaped them through\nknowing their watchword; while if they themselves failed to answer they\nwere put to the sword. But what hurt them as much, or indeed more than\nanything else, was the singing of the paean, from the perplexity which\nit caused by being nearly the same on either side; the Argives and\nCorcyraeans and any other Dorian peoples in the army, struck terror into\nthe Athenians whenever they raised their paean, no less than did the\nenemy. Thus, after being once thrown into disorder, they ended by coming\ninto collision with each other in many parts of the field, friends with\nfriends, and citizens with citizens, and not only terrified one another,\nbut even came to blows and could only be parted with difficulty. In the\npursuit many perished by throwing themselves down the cliffs, the way\ndown from Epipolae being narrow; and of those who got down safely into\nthe plain, although many, especially those who belonged to the first\narmament, escaped through their better acquaintance with the locality,\nsome of the newcomers lost their way and wandered over the country, and\nwere cut off in the morning by the Syracusan cavalry and killed.\n\nThe next day the Syracusans set up two trophies, one upon Epipolae where\nthe ascent had been made, and the other on the spot where the first\ncheck was given by the Boeotians; and the Athenians took back their\ndead under truce. A great many of the Athenians and allies were killed,\nalthough still more arms were taken than could be accounted for by the\nnumber of the dead, as some of those who were obliged to leap down from\nthe cliffs without their shields escaped with their lives and did not\nperish like the rest.\n\nAfter this the Syracusans, recovering their old confidence at such an\nunexpected stroke of good fortune, dispatched Sicanus with fifteen ships\nto Agrigentum where there was a revolution, to induce if possible the\ncity to join them; while Gylippus again went by land into the rest\nof Sicily to bring up reinforcements, being now in hope of taking the\nAthenian lines by storm, after the result of the affair on Epipolae.\n\nIn the meantime the Athenian generals consulted upon the disaster\nwhich had happened, and upon the general weakness of the army. They saw\nthemselves unsuccessful in their enterprises, and the soldiers disgusted\nwith their stay; disease being rife among them owing to its being the\nsickly season of the year, and to the marshy and unhealthy nature of\nthe spot in which they were encamped; and the state of their affairs\ngenerally being thought desperate. Accordingly, Demosthenes was of\nopinion that they ought not to stay any longer; but agreeably to his\noriginal idea in risking the attempt upon Epipolae, now that this had\nfailed, he gave his vote for going away without further loss of time,\nwhile the sea might yet be crossed, and their late reinforcement might\ngive them the superiority at all events on that element. He also said\nthat it would be more profitable for the state to carry on the war\nagainst those who were building fortifications in Attica, than against\nthe Syracusans whom it was no longer easy to subdue; besides which it\nwas not right to squander large sums of money to no purpose by going on\nwith the siege.\n\nThis was the opinion of Demosthenes. Nicias, without denying the bad\nstate of their affairs, was unwilling to avow their weakness, or to have\nit reported to the enemy that the Athenians in full council were openly\nvoting for retreat; for in that case they would be much less likely\nto effect it when they wanted without discovery. Moreover, his own\nparticular information still gave him reason to hope that the affairs\nof the enemy would soon be in a worse state than their own, if the\nAthenians persevered in the siege; as they would wear out the Syracusans\nby want of money, especially with the more extensive command of the sea\nnow given them by their present navy. Besides this, there was a party\nin Syracuse who wished to betray the city to the Athenians, and\nkept sending him messages and telling him not to raise the siege.\nAccordingly, knowing this and really waiting because he hesitated\nbetween the two courses and wished to see his way more clearly, in his\npublic speech on this occasion he refused to lead off the army, saying\nhe was sure the Athenians would never approve of their returning without\na vote of theirs. Those who would vote upon their conduct, instead of\njudging the facts as eye-witnesses like themselves and not from what\nthey might hear from hostile critics, would simply be guided by the\ncalumnies of the first clever speaker; while many, indeed most, of the\nsoldiers on the spot, who now so loudly proclaimed the danger of their\nposition, when they reached Athens would proclaim just as loudly the\nopposite, and would say that their generals had been bribed to betray\nthem and return. For himself, therefore, who knew the Athenian temper,\nsooner than perish under a dishonourable charge and by an unjust\nsentence at the hands of the Athenians, he would rather take his chance\nand die, if die he must, a soldier's death at the hand of the enemy.\nBesides, after all, the Syracusans were in a worse case than themselves.\nWhat with paying mercenaries, spending upon fortified posts, and now for\na full year maintaining a large navy, they were already at a loss and\nwould soon be at a standstill: they had already spent two thousand\ntalents and incurred heavy debts besides, and could not lose even\never so small a fraction of their present force through not paying it,\nwithout ruin to their cause; depending as they did more upon mercenaries\nthan upon soldiers obliged to serve, like their own. He therefore said\nthat they ought to stay and carry on the siege, and not depart defeated\nin point of money, in which they were much superior.\n\nNicias spoke positively because he had exact information of the\nfinancial distress at Syracuse, and also because of the strength of the\nAthenian party there which kept sending him messages not to raise the\nsiege; besides which he had more confidence than before in his fleet,\nand felt sure at least of its success. Demosthenes, however, would not\nhear for a moment of continuing the siege, but said that if they could\nnot lead off the army without a decree from Athens, and if they were\nobliged to stay on, they ought to remove to Thapsus or Catana; where\ntheir land forces would have a wide extent of country to overrun, and\ncould live by plundering the enemy, and would thus do them damage; while\nthe fleet would have the open sea to fight in, that is to say, instead\nof a narrow space which was all in the enemy's favour, a wide sea-room\nwhere their science would be of use, and where they could retreat or\nadvance without being confined or circumscribed either when they put\nout or put in. In any case he was altogether opposed to their staying on\nwhere they were, and insisted on removing at once, as quickly and with\nas little delay as possible; and in this judgment Eurymedon agreed.\nNicias however still objecting, a certain diffidence and hesitation\ncame over them, with a suspicion that Nicias might have some further\ninformation to make him so positive.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n_Nineteenth Year of the War--Battles in the Great Harbour--Retreat and\nAnnihilation of the Athenian Army_\n\nWhile the Athenians lingered on in this way without moving from where\nthey were, Gylippus and Sicanus now arrived at Syracuse. Sicanus had\nfailed to gain Agrigentum, the party friendly to the Syracusans having\nbeen driven out while he was still at Gela; but Gylippus was accompanied\nnot only by a large number of troops raised in Sicily, but by the heavy\ninfantry sent off in the spring from Peloponnese in the merchantmen, who\nhad arrived at Selinus from Libya. They had been carried to Libya by a\nstorm, and having obtained two galleys and pilots from the Cyrenians,\non their voyage alongshore had taken sides with the Euesperitae and had\ndefeated the Libyans who were besieging them, and from thence coasting\non to Neapolis, a Carthaginian mart, and the nearest point to Sicily,\nfrom which it is only two days' and a night's voyage, there crossed\nover and came to Selinus. Immediately upon their arrival the Syracusans\nprepared to attack the Athenians again by land and sea at once. The\nAthenian generals seeing a fresh army come to the aid of the enemy, and\nthat their own circumstances, far from improving, were becoming daily\nworse, and above all distressed by the sickness of the soldiers, now\nbegan to repent of not having removed before; and Nicias no longer\noffering the same opposition, except by urging that there should be\nno open voting, they gave orders as secretly as possible for all to be\nprepared to sail out from the camp at a given signal. All was at last\nready, and they were on the point of sailing away, when an eclipse of\nthe moon, which was then at the full, took place. Most of the Athenians,\ndeeply impressed by this occurrence, now urged the generals to wait; and\nNicias, who was somewhat over-addicted to divination and practices\nof that kind, refused from that moment even to take the question of\ndeparture into consideration, until they had waited the thrice nine days\nprescribed by the soothsayers.\n\nThe besiegers were thus condemned to stay in the country; and the\nSyracusans, getting wind of what had happened, became more eager than\never to press the Athenians, who had now themselves acknowledged\nthat they were no longer their superiors either by sea or by land, as\notherwise they would never have planned to sail away. Besides which\nthe Syracusans did not wish them to settle in any other part of Sicily,\nwhere they would be more difficult to deal with, but desired to force\nthem to fight at sea as quickly as possible, in a position favourable\nto themselves. Accordingly they manned their ships and practised for\nas many days as they thought sufficient. When the moment arrived they\nassaulted on the first day the Athenian lines, and upon a small force of\nheavy infantry and horse sallying out against them by certain gates, cut\noff some of the former and routed and pursued them to the lines, where,\nas the entrance was narrow, the Athenians lost seventy horses and some\nfew of the heavy infantry.\n\nDrawing off their troops for this day, on the next the Syracusans went\nout with a fleet of seventy-six sail, and at the same time advanced with\ntheir land forces against the lines. The Athenians put out to meet\nthem with eighty-six ships, came to close quarters, and engaged. The\nSyracusans and their allies first defeated the Athenian centre, and then\ncaught Eurymedon, the commander of the right wing, who was sailing out\nfrom the line more towards the land in order to surround the enemy, in\nthe hollow and recess of the harbour, and killed him and destroyed the\nships accompanying him; after which they now chased the whole Athenian\nfleet before them and drove them ashore.\n\nGylippus seeing the enemy's fleet defeated and carried ashore beyond\ntheir stockades and camp, ran down to the breakwater with some of his\ntroops, in order to cut off the men as they landed and make it easier\nfor the Syracusans to tow off the vessels by the shore being friendly\nground. The Tyrrhenians who guarded this point for the Athenians, seeing\nthem come on in disorder, advanced out against them and attacked and\nrouted their van, hurling it into the marsh of Lysimeleia. Afterwards\nthe Syracusan and allied troops arrived in greater numbers, and the\nAthenians fearing for their ships came up also to the rescue and engaged\nthem, and defeated and pursued them to some distance and killed a few of\ntheir heavy infantry. They succeeded in rescuing most of their ships\nand brought them down by their camp; eighteen however were taken by the\nSyracusans and their allies, and all the men killed. The rest the enemy\ntried to burn by means of an old merchantman which they filled with\nfaggots and pine-wood, set on fire, and let drift down the wind which\nblew full on the Athenians. The Athenians, however, alarmed for their\nships, contrived means for stopping it and putting it out, and checking\nthe flames and the nearer approach of the merchantman, thus escaped the\ndanger.\n\nAfter this the Syracusans set up a trophy for the sea-fight and for the\nheavy infantry whom they had cut off up at the lines, where they took\nthe horses; and the Athenians for the rout of the foot driven by the\nTyrrhenians into the marsh, and for their own victory with the rest of\nthe army.\n\nThe Syracusans had now gained a decisive victory at sea, where until now\nthey had feared the reinforcement brought by Demosthenes, and deep,\nin consequence, was the despondency of the Athenians, and great their\ndisappointment, and greater still their regret for having come on the\nexpedition. These were the only cities that they had yet encountered,\nsimilar to their own in character, under democracies like themselves,\nwhich had ships and horses, and were of considerable magnitude. They had\nbeen unable to divide and bring them over by holding out the prospect\nof changes in their governments, or to crush them by their great\nsuperiority in force, but had failed in most of their attempts, and\nbeing already in perplexity, had now been defeated at sea, where\ndefeat could never have been expected, and were thus plunged deeper in\nembarrassment than ever.\n\nMeanwhile the Syracusans immediately began to sail freely along the\nharbour, and determined to close up its mouth, so that the Athenians\nmight not be able to steal out in future, even if they wished. Indeed,\nthe Syracusans no longer thought only of saving themselves, but also how\nto hinder the escape of the enemy; thinking, and thinking rightly, that\nthey were now much the stronger, and that to conquer the Athenians and\ntheir allies by land and sea would win them great glory in Hellas. The\nrest of the Hellenes would thus immediately be either freed or released\nfrom apprehension, as the remaining forces of Athens would be henceforth\nunable to sustain the war that would be waged against her; while they,\nthe Syracusans, would be regarded as the authors of this deliverance,\nand would be held in high admiration, not only with all men now living\nbut also with posterity. Nor were these the only considerations that\ngave dignity to the struggle. They would thus conquer not only the\nAthenians but also their numerous allies, and conquer not alone,\nbut with their companions in arms, commanding side by side with the\nCorinthians and Lacedaemonians, having offered their city to stand in\nthe van of danger, and having been in a great measure the pioneers of\nnaval success.\n\nIndeed, there were never so many peoples assembled before a single city,\nif we except the grand total gathered together in this war under Athens\nand Lacedaemon. The following were the states on either side who came\nto Syracuse to fight for or against Sicily, to help to conquer or\ndefend the island. Right or community of blood was not the bond of union\nbetween them, so much as interest or compulsion as the case might be.\nThe Athenians themselves being Ionians went against the Dorians of\nSyracuse of their own free will; and the peoples still speaking Attic\nand using the Athenian laws, the Lemnians, Imbrians, and Aeginetans,\nthat is to say the then occupants of Aegina, being their colonists,\nwent with them. To these must be also added the Hestiaeans dwelling\nat Hestiaea in Euboea. Of the rest some joined in the expedition as\nsubjects of the Athenians, others as independent allies, others as\nmercenaries. To the number of the subjects paying tribute belonged the\nEretrians, Chalcidians, Styrians, and Carystians from Euboea; the Ceans,\nAndrians, and Tenians from the islands; and the Milesians, Samians, and\nChians from Ionia. The Chians, however, joined as independent allies,\npaying no tribute, but furnishing ships. Most of these were Ionians and\ndescended from the Athenians, except the Carystians, who are Dryopes,\nand although subjects and obliged to serve, were still Ionians fighting\nagainst Dorians. Besides these there were men of Aeolic race, the\nMethymnians, subjects who provided ships, not tribute, and the Tenedians\nand Aenians who paid tribute. These Aeolians fought against their\nAeolian founders, the Boeotians in the Syracusan army, because they\nwere obliged, while the Plataeans, the only native Boeotians opposed to\nBoeotians, did so upon a just quarrel. Of the Rhodians and Cytherians,\nboth Dorians, the latter, Lacedaemonian colonists, fought in the\nAthenian ranks against their Lacedaemonian countrymen with Gylippus;\nwhile the Rhodians, Argives by race, were compelled to bear arms against\nthe Dorian Syracusans and their own colonists, the Geloans, serving with\nthe Syracusans. Of the islanders round Peloponnese, the Cephallenians\nand Zacynthians accompanied the Athenians as independent allies,\nalthough their insular position really left them little choice in\nthe matter, owing to the maritime supremacy of Athens, while the\nCorcyraeans, who were not only Dorians but Corinthians, were openly\nserving against Corinthians and Syracusans, although colonists of the\nformer and of the same race as the latter, under colour of compulsion,\nbut really out of free will through hatred of Corinth. The Messenians,\nas they are now called in Naupactus and from Pylos, then held by the\nAthenians, were taken with them to the war. There were also a few\nMegarian exiles, whose fate it was to be now fighting against the\nMegarian Selinuntines.\n\nThe engagement of the rest was more of a voluntary nature. It was less\nthe league than hatred of the Lacedaemonians and the immediate private\nadvantage of each individual that persuaded the Dorian Argives to join\nthe Ionian Athenians in a war against Dorians; while the Mantineans and\nother Arcadian mercenaries, accustomed to go against the enemy pointed\nout to them at the moment, were led by interest to regard the Arcadians\nserving with the Corinthians as just as much their enemies as any\nothers. The Cretans and Aetolians also served for hire, and the Cretans\nwho had joined the Rhodians in founding Gela, thus came to consent to\nfight for pay against, instead of for, their colonists. There were also\nsome Acarnanians paid to serve, although they came chiefly for love of\nDemosthenes and out of goodwill to the Athenians whose allies they\nwere. These all lived on the Hellenic side of the Ionian Gulf. Of the\nItaliots, there were the Thurians and Metapontines, dragged into\nthe quarrel by the stern necessities of a time of revolution; of the\nSiceliots, the Naxians and the Catanians; and of the barbarians, the\nEgestaeans, who called in the Athenians, most of the Sicels, and outside\nSicily some Tyrrhenian enemies of Syracuse and Iapygian mercenaries.\n\nSuch were the peoples serving with the Athenians. Against these the\nSyracusans had the Camarinaeans their neighbours, the Geloans who\nlive next to them; then passing over the neutral Agrigentines, the\nSelinuntines settled on the farther side of the island. These inhabit\nthe part of Sicily looking towards Libya; the Himeraeans came from the\nside towards the Tyrrhenian Sea, being the only Hellenic inhabitants in\nthat quarter, and the only people that came from thence to the aid of\nthe Syracusans. Of the Hellenes in Sicily the above peoples joined in\nthe war, all Dorians and independent, and of the barbarians the Sicels\nonly, that is to say, such as did not go over to the Athenians. Of the\nHellenes outside Sicily there were the Lacedaemonians, who provided a\nSpartan to take the command, and a force of Neodamodes or Freedmen, and\nof Helots; the Corinthians, who alone joined with naval and land forces,\nwith their Leucadian and Ambraciot kinsmen; some mercenaries sent by\nCorinth from Arcadia; some Sicyonians forced to serve, and from outside\nPeloponnese the Boeotians. In comparison, however, with these foreign\nauxiliaries, the great Siceliot cities furnished more in every\ndepartment--numbers of heavy infantry, ships, and horses, and an immense\nmultitude besides having been brought together; while in comparison,\nagain, one may say, with all the rest put together, more was provided by\nthe Syracusans themselves, both from the greatness of the city and from\nthe fact that they were in the greatest danger.\n\nSuch were the auxiliaries brought together on either side, all of which\nhad by this time joined, neither party experiencing any subsequent\naccession. It was no wonder, therefore, if the Syracusans and their\nallies thought that it would win them great glory if they could follow\nup their recent victory in the sea-fight by the capture of the whole\nAthenian armada, without letting it escape either by sea or by land.\nThey began at once to close up the Great Harbour by means of boats,\nmerchant vessels, and galleys moored broadside across its mouth, which\nis nearly a mile wide, and made all their other arrangements for the\nevent of the Athenians again venturing to fight at sea. There was, in\nfact, nothing little either in their plans or their ideas.\n\nThe Athenians, seeing them closing up the harbour and informed of their\nfurther designs, called a council of war. The generals and colonels\nassembled and discussed the difficulties of the situation; the point\nwhich pressed most being that they no longer had provisions for\nimmediate use (having sent on to Catana to tell them not to send any, in\nthe belief that they were going away), and that they would not have any\nin future unless they could command the sea. They therefore determined\nto evacuate their upper lines, to enclose with a cross wall and garrison\na small space close to the ships, only just sufficient to hold their\nstores and sick, and manning all the ships, seaworthy or not, with every\nman that could be spared from the rest of their land forces, to fight it\nout at sea, and, if victorious, to go to Catana, if not, to burn their\nvessels, form in close order, and retreat by land for the nearest\nfriendly place they could reach, Hellenic or barbarian. This was no\nsooner settled than carried into effect; they descended gradually from\nthe upper lines and manned all their vessels, compelling all to go on\nboard who were of age to be in any way of use. They thus succeeded in\nmanning about one hundred and ten ships in all, on board of which they\nembarked a number of archers and darters taken from the Acarnanians and\nfrom the other foreigners, making all other provisions allowed by the\nnature of their plan and by the necessities which imposed it. All was\nnow nearly ready, and Nicias, seeing the soldiery disheartened by their\nunprecedented and decided defeat at sea, and by reason of the scarcity\nof provisions eager to fight it out as soon as possible, called them all\ntogether, and first addressed them, speaking as follows:\n\n\"Soldiers of the Athenians and of the allies, we have all an equal\ninterest in the coming struggle, in which life and country are at stake\nfor us quite as much as they can be for the enemy; since if our fleet\nwins the day, each can see his native city again, wherever that city may\nbe. You must not lose heart, or be like men without any experience, who\nfail in a first essay and ever afterwards fearfully forebode a future\nas disastrous. But let the Athenians among you who have already had\nexperience of many wars, and the allies who have joined us in so many\nexpeditions, remember the surprises of war, and with the hope that\nfortune will not be always against us, prepare to fight again in a\nmanner worthy of the number which you see yourselves to be.\n\n\"Now, whatever we thought would be of service against the crush of\nvessels in such a narrow harbour, and against the force upon the decks\nof the enemy, from which we suffered before, has all been considered\nwith the helmsmen, and, as far as our means allowed, provided. A number\nof archers and darters will go on board, and a multitude that we should\nnot have employed in an action in the open sea, where our science would\nbe crippled by the weight of the vessels; but in the present land-fight\nthat we are forced to make from shipboard all this will be useful. We\nhave also discovered the changes in construction that we must make to\nmeet theirs; and against the thickness of their cheeks, which did us the\ngreatest mischief, we have provided grappling-irons, which will prevent\nan assailant backing water after charging, if the soldiers on deck here\ndo their duty; since we are absolutely compelled to fight a land battle\nfrom the fleet, and it seems to be our interest neither to back water\nourselves, nor to let the enemy do so, especially as the shore, except\nso much of it as may be held by our troops, is hostile ground.\n\n\"You must remember this and fight on as long as you can, and must not\nlet yourselves be driven ashore, but once alongside must make up your\nminds not to part company until you have swept the heavy infantry from\nthe enemy's deck. I say this more for the heavy infantry than for the\nseamen, as it is more the business of the men on deck; and our land\nforces are even now on the whole the strongest. The sailors I advise,\nand at the same time implore, not to be too much daunted by their\nmisfortunes, now that we have our decks better armed and greater number\nof vessels. Bear in mind how well worth preserving is the pleasure felt\nby those of you who through your knowledge of our language and imitation\nof our manners were always considered Athenians, even though not so in\nreality, and as such were honoured throughout Hellas, and had your full\nshare of the advantages of our empire, and more than your share in\nthe respect of our subjects and in protection from ill treatment. You,\ntherefore, with whom alone we freely share our empire, we now justly\nrequire not to betray that empire in its extremity, and in scorn of\nCorinthians, whom you have often conquered, and of Siceliots, none of\nwhom so much as presumed to stand against us when our navy was in its\nprime, we ask you to repel them, and to show that even in sickness and\ndisaster your skill is more than a match for the fortune and vigour of\nany other.\n\n\"For the Athenians among you I add once more this reflection: You left\nbehind you no more such ships in your docks as these, no more heavy\ninfantry in their flower; if you do aught but conquer, our enemies here\nwill immediately sail thither, and those that are left of us at Athens\nwill become unable to repel their home assailants, reinforced by\nthese new allies. Here you will fall at once into the hands of the\nSyracusans--I need not remind you of the intentions with which you\nattacked them--and your countrymen at home will fall into those of\nthe Lacedaemonians. Since the fate of both thus hangs upon this single\nbattle, now, if ever, stand firm, and remember, each and all, that you\nwho are now going on board are the army and navy of the Athenians, and\nall that is left of the state and the great name of Athens, in whose\ndefence if any man has any advantage in skill or courage, now is the\ntime for him to show it, and thus serve himself and save all.\"\n\nAfter this address Nicias at once gave orders to man the ships.\nMeanwhile Gylippus and the Syracusans could perceive by the preparations\nwhich they saw going on that the Athenians meant to fight at sea. They\nhad also notice of the grappling-irons, against which they specially\nprovided by stretching hides over the prows and much of the upper part\nof their vessels, in order that the irons when thrown might slip off\nwithout taking hold. All being now ready, the generals and Gylippus\naddressed them in the following terms:\n\n\"Syracusans and allies, the glorious character of our past achievements\nand the no less glorious results at issue in the coming battle are,\nwe think, understood by most of you, or you would never have thrown\nyourselves with such ardour into the struggle; and if there be any one\nnot as fully aware of the facts as he ought to be, we will declare them\nto him. The Athenians came to this country first to effect the conquest\nof Sicily, and after that, if successful, of Peloponnese and the rest of\nHellas, possessing already the greatest empire yet known, of present or\nformer times, among the Hellenes. Here for the first time they found\nin you men who faced their navy which made them masters everywhere; you\nhave already defeated them in the previous sea-fights, and will in all\nlikelihood defeat them again now. When men are once checked in what they\nconsider their special excellence, their whole opinion of themselves\nsuffers more than if they had not at first believed in their\nsuperiority, the unexpected shock to their pride causing them to give\nway more than their real strength warrants; and this is probably now the\ncase with the Athenians.\n\n\"With us it is different. The original estimate of ourselves which gave\nus courage in the days of our unskilfulness has been strengthened, while\nthe conviction superadded to it that we must be the best seamen of the\ntime, if we have conquered the best, has given a double measure of\nhope to every man among us; and, for the most part, where there is the\ngreatest hope, there is also the greatest ardour for action. The means\nto combat us which they have tried to find in copying our armament are\nfamiliar to our warfare, and will be met by proper provisions; while\nthey will never be able to have a number of heavy infantry on their\ndecks, contrary to their custom, and a number of darters (born landsmen,\none may say, Acarnanians and others, embarked afloat, who will not know\nhow to discharge their weapons when they have to keep still), without\nhampering their vessels and falling all into confusion among themselves\nthrough fighting not according to their own tactics. For they will gain\nnothing by the number of their ships--I say this to those of you who may\nbe alarmed by having to fight against odds--as a quantity of ships in a\nconfined space will only be slower in executing the movements required,\nand most exposed to injury from our means of offence. Indeed, if you\nwould know the plain truth, as we are credibly informed, the excess of\ntheir sufferings and the necessities of their present distress have made\nthem desperate; they have no confidence in their force, but wish to\ntry their fortune in the only way they can, and either to force their\npassage and sail out, or after this to retreat by land, it being\nimpossible for them to be worse off than they are.\n\n\"The fortune of our greatest enemies having thus betrayed itself, and\ntheir disorder being what I have described, let us engage in anger,\nconvinced that, as between adversaries, nothing is more legitimate\nthan to claim to sate the whole wrath of one's soul in punishing the\naggressor, and nothing more sweet, as the proverb has it, than the\nvengeance upon an enemy, which it will now be ours to take. That enemies\nthey are and mortal enemies you all know, since they came here to\nenslave our country, and if successful had in reserve for our men all\nthat is most dreadful, and for our children and wives all that is\nmost dishonourable, and for the whole city the name which conveys the\ngreatest reproach. None should therefore relent or think it gain if they\ngo away without further danger to us. This they will do just the same,\neven if they get the victory; while if we succeed, as we may expect, in\nchastising them, and in handing down to all Sicily her ancient freedom\nstrengthened and confirmed, we shall have achieved no mean triumph. And\nthe rarest dangers are those in which failure brings little loss and\nsuccess the greatest advantage.\"\n\nAfter the above address to the soldiers on their side, the Syracusan\ngenerals and Gylippus now perceived that the Athenians were manning\ntheir ships, and immediately proceeded to man their own also. Meanwhile\nNicias, appalled by the position of affairs, realizing the greatness and\nthe nearness of the danger now that they were on the point of putting\nout from shore, and thinking, as men are apt to think in great crises,\nthat when all has been done they have still something left to do, and\nwhen all has been said that they have not yet said enough, again called\non the captains one by one, addressing each by his father's name and by\nhis own, and by that of his tribe, and adjured them not to belie their\nown personal renown, or to obscure the hereditary virtues for which\ntheir ancestors were illustrious: he reminded them of their country, the\nfreest of the free, and of the unfettered discretion allowed in it to\nall to live as they pleased; and added other arguments such as men would\nuse at such a crisis, and which, with little alteration, are made to\nserve on all occasions alike--appeals to wives, children, and national\ngods--without caring whether they are thought commonplace, but\nloudly invoking them in the belief that they will be of use in the\nconsternation of the moment. Having thus admonished them, not, he felt,\nas he would, but as he could, Nicias withdrew and led the troops to the\nsea, and ranged them in as long a line as he was able, in order to aid\nas far as possible in sustaining the courage of the men afloat; while\nDemosthenes, Menander, and Euthydemus, who took the command on board,\nput out from their own camp and sailed straight to the barrier across\nthe mouth of the harbour and to the passage left open, to try to force\ntheir way out.\n\nThe Syracusans and their allies had already put out with about the same\nnumber of ships as before, a part of which kept guard at the outlet, and\nthe remainder all round the rest of the harbour, in order to attack the\nAthenians on all sides at once; while the land forces held themselves in\nreadiness at the points at which the vessels might put into the shore.\nThe Syracusan fleet was commanded by Sicanus and Agatharchus, who had\neach a wing of the whole force, with Pythen and the Corinthians in the\ncentre. When the rest of the Athenians came up to the barrier, with the\nfirst shock of their charge they overpowered the ships stationed there,\nand tried to undo the fastenings; after this, as the Syracusans and\nallies bore down upon them from all quarters, the action spread from the\nbarrier over the whole harbour, and was more obstinately disputed than\nany of the preceding ones. On either side the rowers showed great zeal\nin bringing up their vessels at the boatswains' orders, and the helmsmen\ngreat skill in manoeuvring, and great emulation one with another; while\nthe ships once alongside, the soldiers on board did their best not to\nlet the service on deck be outdone by the others; in short, every man\nstrove to prove himself the first in his particular department. And as\nmany ships were engaged in a small compass (for these were the largest\nfleets fighting in the narrowest space ever known, being together little\nshort of two hundred), the regular attacks with the beak were few, there\nbeing no opportunity of backing water or of breaking the line; while the\ncollisions caused by one ship chancing to run foul of another, either\nin flying from or attacking a third, were more frequent. So long as a\nvessel was coming up to the charge the men on the decks rained darts and\narrows and stones upon her; but once alongside, the heavy infantry tried\nto board each other's vessel, fighting hand to hand. In many quarters\nit happened, by reason of the narrow room, that a vessel was charging an\nenemy on one side and being charged herself on another, and that two or\nsometimes more ships had perforce got entangled round one, obliging the\nhelmsmen to attend to defence here, offence there, not to one thing at\nonce, but to many on all sides; while the huge din caused by the number\nof ships crashing together not only spread terror, but made the orders\nof the boatswains inaudible. The boatswains on either side in the\ndischarge of their duty and in the heat of the conflict shouted\nincessantly orders and appeals to their men; the Athenians they urged to\nforce the passage out, and now if ever to show their mettle and lay hold\nof a safe return to their country; to the Syracusans and their allies\nthey cried that it would be glorious to prevent the escape of the enemy,\nand, conquering, to exalt the countries that were theirs. The generals,\nmoreover, on either side, if they saw any in any part of the battle\nbacking ashore without being forced to do so, called out to the captain\nby name and asked him--the Athenians, whether they were retreating\nbecause they thought the thrice hostile shore more their own than that\nsea which had cost them so much labour to win; the Syracusans, whether\nthey were flying from the flying Athenians, whom they well knew to be\neager to escape in whatever way they could.\n\nMeanwhile the two armies on shore, while victory hung in the balance,\nwere a prey to the most agonizing and conflicting emotions; the natives\nthirsting for more glory than they had already won, while the invaders\nfeared to find themselves in even worse plight than before. The all of\nthe Athenians being set upon their fleet, their fear for the event was\nlike nothing they had ever felt; while their view of the struggle was\nnecessarily as chequered as the battle itself. Close to the scene of\naction and not all looking at the same point at once, some saw their\nfriends victorious and took courage and fell to calling upon heaven not\nto deprive them of salvation, while others who had their eyes turned\nupon the losers, wailed and cried aloud, and, although spectators, were\nmore overcome than the actual combatants. Others, again, were gazing\nat some spot where the battle was evenly disputed; as the strife\nwas protracted without decision, their swaying bodies reflected the\nagitation of their minds, and they suffered the worst agony of all,\never just within reach of safety or just on the point of destruction.\nIn short, in that one Athenian army as long as the sea-fight remained\ndoubtful there was every sound to be heard at once, shrieks, cheers, \"We\nwin,\" \"We lose,\" and all the other manifold exclamations that a great\nhost would necessarily utter in great peril; and with the men in the\nfleet it was nearly the same; until at last the Syracusans and their\nallies, after the battle had lasted a long while, put the Athenians to\nflight, and with much shouting and cheering chased them in open rout to\nthe shore. The naval force, one one way, one another, as many as were\nnot taken afloat now ran ashore and rushed from on board their ships\nto their camp; while the army, no more divided, but carried away by one\nimpulse, all with shrieks and groans deplored the event, and ran down,\nsome to help the ships, others to guard what was left of their wall,\nwhile the remaining and most numerous part already began to consider how\nthey should save themselves. Indeed, the panic of the present moment\nhad never been surpassed. They now suffered very nearly what they had\ninflicted at Pylos; as then the Lacedaemonians with the loss of their\nfleet lost also the men who had crossed over to the island, so now the\nAthenians had no hope of escaping by land, without the help of some\nextraordinary accident.\n\nThe sea-fight having been a severe one, and many ships and lives having\nbeen lost on both sides, the victorious Syracusans and their allies now\npicked up their wrecks and dead, and sailed off to the city and set up\na trophy. The Athenians, overwhelmed by their misfortune, never even\nthought of asking leave to take up their dead or wrecks, but wished to\nretreat that very night. Demosthenes, however, went to Nicias and gave\nit as his opinion that they should man the ships they had left and make\nanother effort to force their passage out next morning; saying that they\nhad still left more ships fit for service than the enemy, the Athenians\nhaving about sixty remaining as against less than fifty of their\nopponents. Nicias was quite of his mind; but when they wished to man the\nvessels, the sailors refused to go on board, being so utterly overcome\nby their defeat as no longer to believe in the possibility of success.\n\nAccordingly they all now made up their minds to retreat by land.\nMeanwhile the Syracusan Hermocrates--suspecting their intention, and\nimpressed by the danger of allowing a force of that magnitude to retire\nby land, establish itself in some other part of Sicily, and from thence\nrenew the war--went and stated his views to the authorities, and pointed\nout to them that they ought not to let the enemy get away by night, but\nthat all the Syracusans and their allies should at once march out and\nblock up the roads and seize and guard the passes. The authorities were\nentirely of his opinion, and thought that it ought to be done, but on\nthe other hand felt sure that the people, who had given themselves over\nto rejoicing, and were taking their ease after a great battle at sea,\nwould not be easily brought to obey; besides, they were celebrating a\nfestival, having on that day a sacrifice to Heracles, and most of them\nin their rapture at the victory had fallen to drinking at the festival,\nand would probably consent to anything sooner than to take up their\narms and march out at that moment. For these reasons the thing appeared\nimpracticable to the magistrates; and Hermocrates, finding himself\nunable to do anything further with them, had now recourse to the\nfollowing stratagem of his own. What he feared was that the Athenians\nmight quietly get the start of them by passing the most difficult places\nduring the night; and he therefore sent, as soon as it was dusk, some\nfriends of his own to the camp with some horsemen who rode up within\nearshot and called out to some of the men, as though they were\nwell-wishers of the Athenians, and told them to tell Nicias (who had\nin fact some correspondents who informed him of what went on inside the\ntown) not to lead off the army by night as the Syracusans were guarding\nthe roads, but to make his preparations at his leisure and to retreat\nby day. After saying this they departed; and their hearers informed the\nAthenian generals, who put off going for that night on the strength of\nthis message, not doubting its sincerity.\n\nSince after all they had not set out at once, they now determined to\nstay also the following day to give time to the soldiers to pack up as\nwell as they could the most useful articles, and, leaving everything\nelse behind, to start only with what was strictly necessary for their\npersonal subsistence. Meanwhile the Syracusans and Gylippus marched out\nand blocked up the roads through the country by which the Athenians were\nlikely to pass, and kept guard at the fords of the streams and rivers,\nposting themselves so as to receive them and stop the army where they\nthought best; while their fleet sailed up to the beach and towed off the\nships of the Athenians. Some few were burned by the Athenians themselves\nas they had intended; the rest the Syracusans lashed on to their own\nat their leisure as they had been thrown up on shore, without any one\ntrying to stop them, and conveyed to the town.\n\nAfter this, Nicias and Demosthenes now thinking that enough had been\ndone in the way of preparation, the removal of the army took place\nupon the second day after the sea-fight. It was a lamentable scene,\nnot merely from the single circumstance that they were retreating after\nhaving lost all their ships, their great hopes gone, and themselves and\nthe state in peril; but also in leaving the camp there were things most\ngrievous for every eye and heart to contemplate. The dead lay unburied,\nand each man as he recognized a friend among them shuddered with grief\nand horror; while the living whom they were leaving behind, wounded or\nsick, were to the living far more shocking than the dead, and more to\nbe pitied than those who had perished. These fell to entreating and\nbewailing until their friends knew not what to do, begging them to take\nthem and loudly calling to each individual comrade or relative whom they\ncould see, hanging upon the necks of their tent-fellows in the act of\ndeparture, and following as far as they could, and, when their bodily\nstrength failed them, calling again and again upon heaven and shrieking\naloud as they were left behind. So that the whole army being filled with\ntears and distracted after this fashion found it not easy to go, even\nfrom an enemy's land, where they had already suffered evils too great\nfor tears and in the unknown future before them feared to suffer more.\nDejection and self-condemnation were also rife among them. Indeed they\ncould only be compared to a starved-out town, and that no small one,\nescaping; the whole multitude upon the march being not less than forty\nthousand men. All carried anything they could which might be of use,\nand the heavy infantry and troopers, contrary to their wont, while under\narms carried their own victuals, in some cases for want of servants, in\nothers through not trusting them; as they had long been deserting and\nnow did so in greater numbers than ever. Yet even thus they did not\ncarry enough, as there was no longer food in the camp. Moreover their\ndisgrace generally, and the universality of their sufferings, however to\na certain extent alleviated by being borne in company, were still\nfelt at the moment a heavy burden, especially when they contrasted the\nsplendour and glory of their setting out with the humiliation in which\nit had ended. For this was by far the greatest reverse that ever befell\nan Hellenic army. They had come to enslave others, and were departing in\nfear of being enslaved themselves: they had sailed out with prayer\nand paeans, and now started to go back with omens directly contrary;\ntravelling by land instead of by sea, and trusting not in their fleet\nbut in their heavy infantry. Nevertheless the greatness of the danger\nstill impending made all this appear tolerable.\n\nNicias seeing the army dejected and greatly altered, passed along the\nranks and encouraged and comforted them as far as was possible under the\ncircumstances, raising his voice still higher and higher as he went from\none company to another in his earnestness, and in his anxiety that the\nbenefit of his words might reach as many as possible:\n\n\"Athenians and allies, even in our present position we must still hope\non, since men have ere now been saved from worse straits than this;\nand you must not condemn yourselves too severely either because of your\ndisasters or because of your present unmerited sufferings. I myself who\nam not superior to any of you in strength--indeed you see how I am in\nmy sickness--and who in the gifts of fortune am, I think, whether in\nprivate life or otherwise, the equal of any, am now exposed to the same\ndanger as the meanest among you; and yet my life has been one of much\ndevotion toward the gods, and of much justice and without offence toward\nmen. I have, therefore, still a strong hope for the future, and our\nmisfortunes do not terrify me as much as they might. Indeed we may hope\nthat they will be lightened: our enemies have had good fortune enough;\nand if any of the gods was offended at our expedition, we have been\nalready amply punished. Others before us have attacked their neighbours\nand have done what men will do without suffering more than they could\nbear; and we may now justly expect to find the gods more kind, for we\nhave become fitter objects for their pity than their jealousy. And\nthen look at yourselves, mark the numbers and efficiency of the heavy\ninfantry marching in your ranks, and do not give way too much to\ndespondency, but reflect that you are yourselves at once a city wherever\nyou sit down, and that there is no other in Sicily that could easily\nresist your attack, or expel you when once established. The safety and\norder of the march is for yourselves to look to; the one thought of\neach man being that the spot on which he may be forced to fight must\nbe conquered and held as his country and stronghold. Meanwhile we shall\nhasten on our way night and day alike, as our provisions are scanty;\nand if we can reach some friendly place of the Sicels, whom fear of the\nSyracusans still keeps true to us, you may forthwith consider yourselves\nsafe. A message has been sent on to them with directions to meet us with\nsupplies of food. To sum up, be convinced, soldiers, that you must be\nbrave, as there is no place near for your cowardice to take refuge in,\nand that if you now escape from the enemy, you may all see again what\nyour hearts desire, while those of you who are Athenians will raise up\nagain the great power of the state, fallen though it be. Men make the\ncity and not walls or ships without men in them.\"\n\nAs he made this address, Nicias went along the ranks, and brought back\nto their place any of the troops that he saw straggling out of the line;\nwhile Demosthenes did as much for his part of the army, addressing them\nin words very similar. The army marched in a hollow square, the division\nunder Nicias leading, and that of Demosthenes following, the heavy\ninfantry being outside and the baggage-carriers and the bulk of the army\nin the middle. When they arrived at the ford of the river Anapus there\nthey found drawn up a body of the Syracusans and allies, and routing\nthese, made good their passage and pushed on, harassed by the charges of\nthe Syracusan horse and by the missiles of their light troops. On that\nday they advanced about four miles and a half, halting for the night\nupon a certain hill. On the next they started early and got on about\ntwo miles further, and descended into a place in the plain and there\nencamped, in order to procure some eatables from the houses, as the\nplace was inhabited, and to carry on with them water from thence, as for\nmany furlongs in front, in the direction in which they were going, it\nwas not plentiful. The Syracusans meanwhile went on and fortified the\npass in front, where there was a steep hill with a rocky ravine on\neach side of it, called the Acraean cliff. The next day the Athenians\nadvancing found themselves impeded by the missiles and charges of the\nhorse and darters, both very numerous, of the Syracusans and allies;\nand after fighting for a long while, at length retired to the same camp,\nwhere they had no longer provisions as before, it being impossible to\nleave their position by reason of the cavalry.\n\nEarly next morning they started afresh and forced their way to the\nhill, which had been fortified, where they found before them the enemy's\ninfantry drawn up many shields deep to defend the fortification, the\npass being narrow. The Athenians assaulted the work, but were greeted\nby a storm of missiles from the hill, which told with the greater\neffect through its being a steep one, and unable to force the passage,\nretreated again and rested. Meanwhile occurred some claps of thunder and\nrain, as often happens towards autumn, which still further disheartened\nthe Athenians, who thought all these things to be omens of their\napproaching ruin. While they were resting, Gylippus and the Syracusans\nsent a part of their army to throw up works in their rear on the way by\nwhich they had advanced; however, the Athenians immediately sent some\nof their men and prevented them; after which they retreated more towards\nthe plain and halted for the night. When they advanced the next day the\nSyracusans surrounded and attacked them on every side, and disabled many\nof them, falling back if the Athenians advanced and coming on if they\nretired, and in particular assaulting their rear, in the hope of routing\nthem in detail, and thus striking a panic into the whole army. For a\nlong while the Athenians persevered in this fashion, but after advancing\nfor four or five furlongs halted to rest in the plain, the Syracusans\nalso withdrawing to their own camp.\n\nDuring the night Nicias and Demosthenes, seeing the wretched condition\nof their troops, now in want of every kind of necessary, and numbers of\nthem disabled in the numerous attacks of the enemy, determined to light\nas many fires as possible, and to lead off the army, no longer by the\nsame route as they had intended, but towards the sea in the opposite\ndirection to that guarded by the Syracusans. The whole of this route was\nleading the army not to Catana but to the other side of Sicily, towards\nCamarina, Gela, and the other Hellenic and barbarian towns in that\nquarter. They accordingly lit a number of fires and set out by night.\nNow all armies, and the greatest most of all, are liable to fears and\nalarms, especially when they are marching by night through an enemy's\ncountry and with the enemy near; and the Athenians falling into one of\nthese panics, the leading division, that of Nicias, kept together and\ngot on a good way in front, while that of Demosthenes, comprising rather\nmore than half the army, got separated and marched on in some disorder.\nBy morning, however, they reached the sea, and getting into the Helorine\nroad, pushed on in order to reach the river Cacyparis, and to follow the\nstream up through the interior, where they hoped to be met by the Sicels\nwhom they had sent for. Arrived at the river, they found there also a\nSyracusan party engaged in barring the passage of the ford with a wall\nand a palisade, and forcing this guard, crossed the river and went on to\nanother called the Erineus, according to the advice of their guides.\n\nMeanwhile, when day came and the Syracusans and allies found that the\nAthenians were gone, most of them accused Gylippus of having let them\nescape on purpose, and hastily pursuing by the road which they had\nno difficulty in finding that they had taken, overtook them about\ndinner-time. They first came up with the troops under Demosthenes, who\nwere behind and marching somewhat slowly and in disorder, owing to the\nnight panic above referred to, and at once attacked and engaged them,\nthe Syracusan horse surrounding them with more ease now that they were\nseparated from the rest and hemming them in on one spot. The division of\nNicias was five or six miles on in front, as he led them more rapidly,\nthinking that under the circumstances their safety lay not in staying\nand fighting, unless obliged, but in retreating as fast as possible, and\nonly fighting when forced to do so. On the other hand, Demosthenes was,\ngenerally speaking, harassed more incessantly, as his post in the rear\nleft him the first exposed to the attacks of the enemy; and now, finding\nthat the Syracusans were in pursuit, he omitted to push on, in order to\nform his men for battle, and so lingered until he was surrounded by\nhis pursuers and himself and the Athenians with him placed in the most\ndistressing position, being huddled into an enclosure with a wall all\nround it, a road on this side and on that, and olive-trees in great\nnumber, where missiles were showered in upon them from every quarter.\nThis mode of attack the Syracusans had with good reason adopted in\npreference to fighting at close quarters, as to risk a struggle with\ndesperate men was now more for the advantage of the Athenians than for\ntheir own; besides, their success had now become so certain that they\nbegan to spare themselves a little in order not to be cut off in the\nmoment of victory, thinking too that, as it was, they would be able in\nthis way to subdue and capture the enemy.\n\nIn fact, after plying the Athenians and allies all day long from every\nside with missiles, they at length saw that they were worn out with\ntheir wounds and other sufferings; and Gylippus and the Syracusans and\ntheir allies made a proclamation, offering their liberty to any of the\nislanders who chose to come over to them; and some few cities went\nover. Afterwards a capitulation was agreed upon for all the rest with\nDemosthenes, to lay down their arms on condition that no one was to\nbe put to death either by violence or imprisonment or want of the\nnecessaries of life. Upon this they surrendered to the number of six\nthousand in all, laying down all the money in their possession, which\nfilled the hollows of four shields, and were immediately conveyed by the\nSyracusans to the town.\n\nMeanwhile Nicias with his division arrived that day at the river\nErineus, crossed over, and posted his army upon some high ground upon\nthe other side. The next day the Syracusans overtook him and told him\nthat the troops under Demosthenes had surrendered, and invited him to\nfollow their example. Incredulous of the fact, Nicias asked for a truce\nto send a horseman to see, and upon the return of the messenger with\nthe tidings that they had surrendered, sent a herald to Gylippus and the\nSyracusans, saying that he was ready to agree with them on behalf of the\nAthenians to repay whatever money the Syracusans had spent upon the war\nif they would let his army go; and offered until the money was paid to\ngive Athenians as hostages, one for every talent. The Syracusans and\nGylippus rejected this proposition, and attacked this division as they\nhad the other, standing all round and plying them with missiles until\nthe evening. Food and necessaries were as miserably wanting to the\ntroops of Nicias as they had been to their comrades; nevertheless they\nwatched for the quiet of the night to resume their march. But as they\nwere taking up their arms the Syracusans perceived it and raised their\npaean, upon which the Athenians, finding that they were discovered, laid\nthem down again, except about three hundred men who forced their way\nthrough the guards and went on during the night as they were able.\n\nAs soon as it was day Nicias put his army in motion, pressed, as before,\nby the Syracusans and their allies, pelted from every side by their\nmissiles, and struck down by their javelins. The Athenians pushed on for\nthe Assinarus, impelled by the attacks made upon them from every side\nby a numerous cavalry and the swarm of other arms, fancying that they\nshould breathe more freely if once across the river, and driven on also\nby their exhaustion and craving for water. Once there they rushed in,\nand all order was at an end, each man wanting to cross first, and the\nattacks of the enemy making it difficult to cross at all; forced to\nhuddle together, they fell against and trod down one another, some dying\nimmediately upon the javelins, others getting entangled together and\nstumbling over the articles of baggage, without being able to rise\nagain. Meanwhile the opposite bank, which was steep, was lined by the\nSyracusans, who showered missiles down upon the Athenians, most of them\ndrinking greedily and heaped together in disorder in the hollow bed\nof the river. The Peloponnesians also came down and butchered them,\nespecially those in the water, which was thus immediately spoiled, but\nwhich they went on drinking just the same, mud and all, bloody as it\nwas, most even fighting to have it.\n\nAt last, when many dead now lay piled one upon another in the stream,\nand part of the army had been destroyed at the river, and the few that\nescaped from thence cut off by the cavalry, Nicias surrendered himself\nto Gylippus, whom he trusted more than he did the Syracusans, and told\nhim and the Lacedaemonians to do what they liked with him, but to stop\nthe slaughter of the soldiers. Gylippus, after this, immediately gave\norders to make prisoners; upon which the rest were brought together\nalive, except a large number secreted by the soldiery, and a party\nwas sent in pursuit of the three hundred who had got through the guard\nduring the night, and who were now taken with the rest. The number of\nthe enemy collected as public property was not considerable; but\nthat secreted was very large, and all Sicily was filled with them,\nno convention having been made in their case as for those taken with\nDemosthenes. Besides this, a large portion were killed outright, the\ncarnage being very great, and not exceeded by any in this Sicilian war.\nIn the numerous other encounters upon the march, not a few also had\nfallen. Nevertheless many escaped, some at the moment, others served as\nslaves, and then ran away subsequently. These found refuge at Catana.\n\nThe Syracusans and their allies now mustered and took up the spoils and\nas many prisoners as they could, and went back to the city. The rest of\ntheir Athenian and allied captives were deposited in the quarries, this\nseeming the safest way of keeping them; but Nicias and Demosthenes were\nbutchered, against the will of Gylippus, who thought that it would\nbe the crown of his triumph if he could take the enemy's generals to\nLacedaemon. One of them, as it happened, Demosthenes, was one of her\ngreatest enemies, on account of the affair of the island and of Pylos;\nwhile the other, Nicias, was for the same reasons one of her greatest\nfriends, owing to his exertions to procure the release of the prisoners\nby persuading the Athenians to make peace. For these reasons the\nLacedaemonians felt kindly towards him; and it was in this that Nicias\nhimself mainly confided when he surrendered to Gylippus. But some of the\nSyracusans who had been in correspondence with him were afraid, it was\nsaid, of his being put to the torture and troubling their success by his\nrevelations; others, especially the Corinthians, of his escaping, as he\nwas wealthy, by means of bribes, and living to do them further mischief;\nand these persuaded the allies and put him to death. This or the like\nwas the cause of the death of a man who, of all the Hellenes in my time,\nleast deserved such a fate, seeing that the whole course of his life had\nbeen regulated with strict attention to virtue.\n\nThe prisoners in the quarries were at first hardly treated by the\nSyracusans. Crowded in a narrow hole, without any roof to cover them,\nthe heat of the sun and the stifling closeness of the air tormented them\nduring the day, and then the nights, which came on autumnal and chilly,\nmade them ill by the violence of the change; besides, as they had to do\neverything in the same place for want of room, and the bodies of those\nwho died of their wounds or from the variation in the temperature,\nor from similar causes, were left heaped together one upon another,\nintolerable stenches arose; while hunger and thirst never ceased to\nafflict them, each man during eight months having only half a pint of\nwater and a pint of corn given him daily. In short, no single suffering\nto be apprehended by men thrust into such a place was spared them. For\nsome seventy days they thus lived all together, after which all, except\nthe Athenians and any Siceliots or Italiots who had joined in the\nexpedition, were sold. The total number of prisoners taken it would be\ndifficult to state exactly, but it could not have been less than seven\nthousand.\n\nThis was the greatest Hellenic achievement of any in thig war, or, in my\nopinion, in Hellenic history; at once most glorious to the victors, and\nmost calamitous to the conquered. They were beaten at all points and\naltogether; all that they suffered was great; they were destroyed,\nas the saying is, with a total destruction, their fleet, their army,\neverything was destroyed, and few out of many returned home. Such were\nthe events in Sicily.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VIII\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n_Nineteenth and Twentieth Years of the War--Revolt of Ionia--\nIntervention of Persia--The War in Ionia_\n\nWhen the news was brought to Athens, for a long while they disbelieved\neven the most respectable of the soldiers who had themselves escaped\nfrom the scene of action and clearly reported the matter, a destruction\nso complete not being thought credible. When the conviction was forced\nupon them, they were angry with the orators who had joined in promoting\nthe expedition, just as if they had not themselves voted it, and were\nenraged also with the reciters of oracles and soothsayers, and all\nother omen-mongers of the time who had encouraged them to hope that\nthey should conquer Sicily. Already distressed at all points and in all\nquarters, after what had now happened, they were seized by a fear and\nconsternation quite without example. It was grievous enough for the\nstate and for every man in his proper person to lose so many heavy\ninfantry, cavalry, and able-bodied troops, and to see none left to\nreplace them; but when they saw, also, that they had not sufficient\nships in their docks, or money in the treasury, or crews for the ships,\nthey began to despair of salvation. They thought that their enemies in\nSicily would immediately sail with their fleet against Piraeus, inflamed\nby so signal a victory; while their adversaries at home, redoubling\nall their preparations, would vigorously attack them by sea and land at\nonce, aided by their own revolted confederates. Nevertheless, with\nsuch means as they had, it was determined to resist to the last, and to\nprovide timber and money, and to equip a fleet as they best could, to\ntake steps to secure their confederates and above all Euboea, to reform\nthings in the city upon a more economical footing, and to elect a board\nof elders to advise upon the state of affairs as occasion should arise.\nIn short, as is the way of a democracy, in the panic of the moment they\nwere ready to be as prudent as possible.\n\nThese resolves were at once carried into effect. Summer was now over.\nThe winter ensuing saw all Hellas stirring under the impression of\nthe great Athenian disaster in Sicily. Neutrals now felt that even if\nuninvited they ought no longer to stand aloof from the war, but should\nvolunteer to march against the Athenians, who, as they severally\nreflected, would probably have come against them if the Sicilian\ncampaign had succeeded. Besides, they considered that the war would now\nbe short, and that it would be creditable for them to take part in it.\nMeanwhile the allies of the Lacedaemonians felt all more anxious than\never to see a speedy end to their heavy labours. But above all, the\nsubjects of the Athenians showed a readiness to revolt even beyond their\nability, judging the circumstances with passion, and refusing even to\nhear of the Athenians being able to last out the coming summer. Beyond\nall this, Lacedaemon was encouraged by the near prospect of being joined\nin great force in the spring by her allies in Sicily, lately forced by\nevents to acquire their navy. With these reasons for confidence in every\nquarter, the Lacedaemonians now resolved to throw themselves without\nreserve into the war, considering that, once it was happily terminated,\nthey would be finally delivered from such dangers as that which would\nhave threatened them from Athens, if she had become mistress of Sicily,\nand that the overthrow of the Athenians would leave them in quiet\nenjoyment of the supremacy over all Hellas.\n\nTheir king, Agis, accordingly set out at once during this winter with\nsome troops from Decelea, and levied from the allies contributions for\nthe fleet, and turning towards the Malian Gulf exacted a sum of money\nfrom the Oetaeans by carrying off most of their cattle in reprisal for\ntheir old hostility, and, in spite of the protests and opposition of the\nThessalians, forced the Achaeans of Phthiotis and the other subjects\nof the Thessalians in those parts to give him money and hostages, and\ndeposited the hostages at Corinth, and tried to bring their countrymen\ninto the confederacy. The Lacedaemonians now issued a requisition to the\ncities for building a hundred ships, fixing their own quota and that\nof the Boeotians at twenty-five each; that of the Phocians and Locrians\ntogether at fifteen; that of the Corinthians at fifteen; that of the\nArcadians, Pellenians, and Sicyonians together at ten; and that of the\nMegarians, Troezenians, Epidaurians, and Hermionians together at\nten also; and meanwhile made every other preparation for commencing\nhostilities by the spring.\n\nIn the meantime the Athenians were not idle. During this same winter,\nas they had determined, they contributed timber and pushed on their\nship-building, and fortified Sunium to enable their corn-ships to round\nit in safety, and evacuated the fort in Laconia which they had built on\ntheir way to Sicily; while they also, for economy, cut down any other\nexpenses that seemed unnecessary, and above all kept a careful look-out\nagainst the revolt of their confederates.\n\nWhile both parties were thus engaged, and were as intent upon preparing\nfor the war as they had been at the outset, the Euboeans first of all\nsent envoys during this winter to Agis to treat of their revolting from\nAthens. Agis accepted their proposals, and sent for Alcamenes, son of\nSthenelaidas, and Melanthus from Lacedaemon, to take the command in\nEuboea. These accordingly arrived with some three hundred Neodamodes,\nand Agis began to arrange for their crossing over. But in the meanwhile\narrived some Lesbians, who also wished to revolt; and these being\nsupported by the Boeotians, Agis was persuaded to defer acting in the\nmatter of Euboea, and made arrangements for the revolt of the Lesbians,\ngiving them Alcamenes, who was to have sailed to Euboea, as governor,\nand himself promising them ten ships, and the Boeotians the same number.\nAll this was done without instructions from home, as Agis while at\nDecelea with the army that he commanded had power to send troops to\nwhatever quarter he pleased, and to levy men and money. During this\nperiod, one might say, the allies obeyed him much more than they did the\nLacedaemonians in the city, as the force he had with him made him feared\nat once wherever he went. While Agis was engaged with the Lesbians, the\nChians and Erythraeans, who were also ready to revolt, applied, not to\nhim but at Lacedaemon; where they arrived accompanied by an ambassador\nfrom Tissaphernes, the commander of King Darius, son of Artaxerxes, in\nthe maritime districts, who invited the Peloponnesians to come over, and\npromised to maintain their army. The King had lately called upon him\nfor the tribute from his government, for which he was in arrears, being\nunable to raise it from the Hellenic towns by reason of the Athenians;\nand he therefore calculated that by weakening the Athenians he should\nget the tribute better paid, and should also draw the Lacedaemonians\ninto alliance with the King; and by this means, as the King had\ncommanded him, take alive or dead Amorges, the bastard son of\nPissuthnes, who was in rebellion on the coast of Caria.\n\nWhile the Chians and Tissaphernes thus joined to effect the same\nobject, about the same time Calligeitus, son of Laophon, a Megarian,\nand Timagoras, son of Athenagoras, a Cyzicene, both of them exiles from\ntheir country and living at the court of Pharnabazus, son of Pharnaces,\narrived at Lacedaemon upon a mission from Pharnabazus, to procure a\nfleet for the Hellespont; by means of which, if possible, he might\nhimself effect the object of Tissaphernes' ambition and cause the cities\nin his government to revolt from the Athenians, and so get the\ntribute, and by his own agency obtain for the King the alliance of the\nLacedaemonians.\n\nThe emissaries of Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes treating apart, a keen\ncompetition now ensued at Lacedaemon as to whether a fleet and army\nshould be sent first to Ionia and Chios, or to the Hellespont. The\nLacedaemonians, however, decidedly favoured the Chians and Tissaphernes,\nwho were seconded by Alcibiades, the family friend of Endius, one of the\nephors for that year. Indeed, this is how their house got its Laconic\nname, Alcibiades being the family name of Endius. Nevertheless the\nLacedaemonians first sent to Chios Phrynis, one of the Perioeci, to\nsee whether they had as many ships as they said, and whether their city\ngenerally was as great as was reported; and upon his bringing word that\nthey had been told the truth, immediately entered into alliance with the\nChians and Erythraeans, and voted to send them forty ships, there being\nalready, according to the statement of the Chians, not less than sixty\nin the island. At first the Lacedaemonians meant to send ten of these\nforty themselves, with Melanchridas their admiral; but afterwards,\nan earthquake having occurred, they sent Chalcideus instead of\nMelanchridas, and instead of the ten ships equipped only five in\nLaconia. And the winter ended, and with it ended also the nineteenth\nyear of this war of which Thucydides is the historian.\n\nAt the beginning of the next summer the Chians were urging that the\nfleet should be sent off, being afraid that the Athenians, from whom all\nthese embassies were kept a secret, might find out what was going on,\nand the Lacedaemonians at once sent three Spartans to Corinth to haul\nthe ships as quickly as possible across the Isthmus from the other sea\nto that on the side of Athens, and to order them all to sail to Chios,\nthose which Agis was equipping for Lesbos not excepted. The number of\nships from the allied states was thirty-nine in all.\n\nMeanwhile Calligeitus and Timagoras did not join on behalf of\nPharnabazus in the expedition to Chios or give the money--twenty-five\ntalents--which they had brought with them to help in dispatching\na force, but determined to sail afterwards with another force by\nthemselves. Agis, on the other hand, seeing the Lacedaemonians bent upon\ngoing to Chios first, himself came in to their views; and the allies\nassembled at Corinth and held a council, in which they decided to sail\nfirst to Chios under the command of Chalcideus, who was equipping the\nfive vessels in Laconia, then to Lesbos, under the command of Alcamenes,\nthe same whom Agis had fixed upon, and lastly to go to the Hellespont,\nwhere the command was given to Clearchus, son of Ramphias. Meanwhile\nthey would take only half the ships across the Isthmus first, and let\nthose sail off at once, in order that the Athenians might attend less to\nthe departing squadron than to those to be taken across afterwards, as\nno care had been taken to keep this voyage secret through contempt of\nthe impotence of the Athenians, who had as yet no fleet of any account\nupon the sea. Agreeably to this determination, twenty-one vessels were\nat once conveyed across the Isthmus.\n\nThey were now impatient to set sail, but the Corinthians were not\nwilling to accompany them until they had celebrated the Isthmian\nfestival, which fell at that time. Upon this Agis proposed to them to\nsave their scruples about breaking the Isthmian truce by taking the\nexpedition upon himself. The Corinthians not consenting to this, a delay\nensued, during which the Athenians conceived suspicions of what was\npreparing at Chios, and sent Aristocrates, one of their generals, and\ncharged them with the fact, and, upon the denial of the Chians, ordered\nthem to send with them a contingent of ships, as faithful confederates.\nSeven were sent accordingly. The reason of the dispatch of the ships\nlay in the fact that the mass of the Chians were not privy to the\nnegotiations, while the few who were in the secret did not wish to break\nwith the multitude until they had something positive to lean upon,\nand no longer expected the Peloponnesians to arrive by reason of their\ndelay.\n\nIn the meantime the Isthmian games took place, and the Athenians, who\nhad been also invited, went to attend them, and now seeing more clearly\ninto the designs of the Chians, as soon as they returned to Athens took\nmeasures to prevent the fleet putting out from Cenchreae without\ntheir knowledge. After the festival the Peloponnesians set sail\nwith twenty-one ships for Chios, under the command of Alcamenes. The\nAthenians first sailed against them with an equal number, drawing off\ntowards the open sea. The enemy, however, turning back before he had\nfollowed them far, the Athenians returned also, not trusting the seven\nChian ships which formed part of their number, and afterwards manned\nthirty-seven vessels in all and chased him on his passage alongshore\ninto Spiraeum, a desert Corinthian port on the edge of the Epidaurian\nfrontier. After losing one ship out at sea, the Peloponnesians got the\nrest together and brought them to anchor. The Athenians now attacked not\nonly from the sea with their fleet, but also disembarked upon the coast;\nand a melee ensued of the most confused and violent kind, in which the\nAthenians disabled most of the enemy's vessels and killed Alcamenes\ntheir commander, losing also a few of their own men.\n\nAfter this they separated, and the Athenians, detaching a sufficient\nnumber of ships to blockade those of the enemy, anchored with the rest\nat the islet adjacent, upon which they proceeded to encamp, and sent to\nAthens for reinforcements; the Peloponnesians having been joined on the\nday after the battle by the Corinthians, who came to help the ships, and\nby the other inhabitants in the vicinity not long afterwards. These\nsaw the difficulty of keeping guard in a desert place, and in their\nperplexity at first thought of burning the ships, but finally resolved\nto haul them up on shore and sit down and guard them with their land\nforces until a convenient opportunity for escaping should present\nitself. Agis also, on being informed of the disaster, sent them a\nSpartan of the name of Thermon. The Lacedaemonians first received the\nnews of the fleet having put out from the Isthmus, Alcamenes having been\nordered by the ephors to send off a horseman when this took place,\nand immediately resolved to dispatch their own five vessels under\nChalcideus, and Alcibiades with him. But while they were full of this\nresolution came the second news of the fleet having taken refuge in\nSpiraeum; and disheartened at their first step in the Ionian war proving\na failure, they laid aside the idea of sending the ships from their own\ncountry, and even wished to recall some that had already sailed.\n\nPerceiving this, Alcibiades again persuaded Endius and the other ephors\nto persevere in the expedition, saying that the voyage would be made\nbefore the Chians heard of the fleet's misfortune, and that as soon as\nhe set foot in Ionia, he should, by assuring them of the weakness of the\nAthenians and the zeal of Lacedaemon, have no difficulty in persuading\nthe cities to revolt, as they would readily believe his testimony. He\nalso represented to Endius himself in private that it would be glorious\nfor him to be the means of making Ionia revolt and the King become the\nally of Lacedaemon, instead of that honour being left to Agis (Agis,\nit must be remembered, was the enemy of Alcibiades); and Endius and his\ncolleagues thus persuaded, he put to sea with the five ships and the\nLacedaemonian Chalcideus, and made all haste upon the voyage.\n\nAbout this time the sixteen Peloponnesian ships from Sicily, which had\nserved through the war with Gylippus, were caught on their return off\nLeucadia and roughly handled by the twenty-seven Athenian vessels under\nHippocles, son of Menippus, on the lookout for the ships from Sicily.\nAfter losing one of their number, the rest escaped from the Athenians\nand sailed into Corinth.\n\nMeanwhile Chalcideus and Alcibiades seized all they met with on their\nvoyage, to prevent news of their coming, and let them go at Corycus,\nthe first point which they touched at in the continent. Here they were\nvisited by some of their Chian correspondents and, being urged by them\nto sail up to the town without announcing their coming, arrived suddenly\nbefore Chios. The many were amazed and confounded, while the few had\nso arranged that the council should be sitting at the time; and after\nspeeches from Chalcideus and Alcibiades stating that many more ships\nwere sailing up, but saying nothing of the fleet being blockaded in\nSpiraeum, the Chians revolted from the Athenians, and the Erythraeans\nimmediately afterwards. After this three vessels sailed over to\nClazomenae, and made that city revolt also; and the Clazomenians\nimmediately crossed over to the mainland and began to fortify Polichna,\nin order to retreat there, in case of necessity, from the island where\nthey dwelt.\n\nWhile the revolted places were all engaged in fortifying and preparing\nfor the war, news of Chios speedily reached Athens. The Athenians\nthought the danger by which they were now menaced great and\nunmistakable, and that the rest of their allies would not consent to\nkeep quiet after the secession of the greatest of their number. In the\nconsternation of the moment they at once took off the penalty attaching\nto whoever proposed or put to the vote a proposal for using the thousand\ntalents which they had jealously avoided touching throughout the whole\nwar, and voted to employ them to man a large number of ships, and\nto send off at once under Strombichides, son of Diotimus, the eight\nvessels, forming part of the blockading fleet at Spiraeum, which\nhad left the blockade and had returned after pursuing and failing to\novertake the vessels with Chalcideus. These were to be followed\nshortly afterwards by twelve more under Thrasycles, also taken from the\nblockade. They also recalled the seven Chian vessels, forming part of\ntheir squadron blockading the fleet in Spiraeum, and giving the slaves\non board their liberty, put the freemen in confinement, and speedily\nmanned and sent out ten fresh ships to blockade the Peloponnesians in\nthe place of all those that had departed, and decided to man thirty\nmore. Zeal was not wanting, and no effort was spared to send relief to\nChios.\n\nIn the meantime Strombichides with his eight ships arrived at Samos,\nand, taking one Samian vessel, sailed to Teos and required them to\nremain quiet. Chalcideus also set sail with twenty-three ships for Teos\nfrom Chios, the land forces of the Clazomenians and Erythraeans moving\nalongshore to support him. Informed of this in time, Strombichides put\nout from Teos before their arrival, and while out at sea, seeing the\nnumber of the ships from Chios, fled towards Samos, chased by the enemy.\nThe Teians at first would not receive the land forces, but upon the\nflight of the Athenians took them into the town. There they waited for\nsome time for Chalcideus to return from the pursuit, and as time went on\nwithout his appearing, began themselves to demolish the wall which the\nAthenians had built on the land side of the city of the Teians, being\nassisted by a few of the barbarians who had come up under the command of\nStages, the lieutenant of Tissaphernes.\n\nMeanwhile Chalcideus and Alcibiades, after chasing Strombichides into\nSamos, armed the crews of the ships from Peloponnese and left them at\nChios, and filling their places with substitutes from Chios and manning\ntwenty others, sailed off to effect the revolt of Miletus. The wish of\nAlcibiades, who had friends among the leading men of the Milesians, was\nto bring over the town before the arrival of the ships from Peloponnese,\nand thus, by causing the revolt of as many cities as possible with the\nhelp of the Chian power and of Chalcideus, to secure the honour for the\nChians and himself and Chalcideus, and, as he had promised, for Endius\nwho had sent them out. Not discovered until their voyage was nearly\ncompleted, they arrived a little before Strombichides and Thrasycles\n(who had just come with twelve ships from Athens, and had joined\nStrombichides in pursuing them), and occasioned the revolt of Miletus.\nThe Athenians sailing up close on their heels with nineteen ships found\nMiletus closed against them, and took up their station at the\nadjacent island of Lade. The first alliance between the King and the\nLacedaemonians was now concluded immediately upon the revolt of the\nMilesians, by Tissaphernes and Chalcideus, and was as follows:\n\nThe Lacedaemonians and their allies made a treaty with the King and\nTissaphernes upon the terms following:\n\n1. Whatever country or cities the King has, or the King's ancestors had,\nshall be the king's: and whatever came in to the Athenians from these\ncities, either money or any other thing, the King and the Lacedaemonians\nand their allies shall jointly hinder the Athenians from receiving\neither money or any other thing.\n\n2. The war with the Athenians shall be carried on jointly by the King\nand by the Lacedaemonians and their allies: and it shall not be lawful\nto make peace with the Athenians except both agree, the King on his side\nand the Lacedaemonians and their allies on theirs.\n\n3. If any revolt from the King, they shall be the enemies of\nthe Lacedaemonians and their allies. And if any revolt from the\nLacedaemonians and their allies, they shall be the enemies of the King\nin like manner.\n\nThis was the alliance. After this the Chians immediately manned ten more\nvessels and sailed for Anaia, in order to gain intelligence of those\nin Miletus, and also to make the cities revolt. A message, however,\nreaching them from Chalcideus to tell them to go back again, and that\nAmorges was at hand with an army by land, they sailed to the temple of\nZeus, and there sighting ten more ships sailing up with which Diomedon\nhad started from Athens after Thrasycles, fled, one ship to Ephesus,\nthe rest to Teos. The Athenians took four of their ships empty, the men\nfinding time to escape ashore; the rest took refuge in the city of the\nTeians; after which the Athenians sailed off to Samos, while the Chians\nput to sea with their remaining vessels, accompanied by the land forces,\nand caused Lebedos to revolt, and after it Erae. After this they both\nreturned home, the fleet and the army.\n\nAbout the same time the twenty ships of the Peloponnesians in Spiraeum,\nwhich we left chased to land and blockaded by an equal number of\nAthenians, suddenly sallied out and defeated the blockading squadron,\ntook four of their ships, and, sailing back to Cenchreae, prepared again\nfor the voyage to Chios and Ionia. Here they were joined by Astyochus\nas high admiral from Lacedaemon, henceforth invested with the supreme\ncommand at sea. The land forces now withdrawing from Teos, Tissaphernes\nrepaired thither in person with an army and completed the demolition of\nanything that was left of the wall, and so departed. Not long after his\ndeparture Diomedon arrived with ten Athenian ships, and, having made\na convention by which the Teians admitted him as they had the enemy,\ncoasted along to Erae, and, failing in an attempt upon the town, sailed\nback again.\n\nAbout this time took place the rising of the commons at Samos against\nthe upper classes, in concert with some Athenians, who were there in\nthree vessels. The Samian commons put to death some two hundred in all\nof the upper classes, and banished four hundred more, and themselves\ntook their land and houses; after which the Athenians decreed their\nindependence, being now sure of their fidelity, and the commons\nhenceforth governed the city, excluding the landholders from all share\nin affairs, and forbidding any of the commons to give his daughter in\nmarriage to them or to take a wife from them in future.\n\nAfter this, during the same summer, the Chians, whose zeal continued as\nactive as ever, and who even without the Peloponnesians found themselves\nin sufficient force to effect the revolt of the cities and also wished\nto have as many companions in peril as possible, made an expedition with\nthirteen ships of their own to Lesbos; the instructions from Lacedaemon\nbeing to go to that island next, and from thence to the Hellespont.\nMeanwhile the land forces of the Peloponnesians who were with the Chians\nand of the allies on the spot, moved alongshore for Clazomenae and Cuma,\nunder the command of Eualas, a Spartan; while the fleet under Diniadas,\none of the Perioeci, first sailed up to Methymna and caused it to\nrevolt, and, leaving four ships there, with the rest procured the revolt\nof Mitylene.\n\nIn the meantime Astyochus, the Lacedaemonian admiral, set sail from\nCenchreae with four ships, as he had intended, and arrived at Chios.\nOn the third day after his arrival, the Athenian ships, twenty-five in\nnumber, sailed to Lesbos under Diomedon and Leon, who had lately arrived\nwith a reinforcement of ten ships from Athens. Late in the same day\nAstyochus put to sea, and taking one Chian vessel with him sailed to\nLesbos to render what assistance he could. Arrived at Pyrrha, and from\nthence the next day at Eresus, he there learned that Mitylene had been\ntaken, almost without a blow, by the Athenians, who had sailed up and\nunexpectedly put into the harbour, had beaten the Chian ships, and\nlanding and defeating the troops opposed to them had become masters of\nthe city. Informed of this by the Eresians and the Chian ships, which\nhad been left with Eubulus at Methymna, and had fled upon the capture of\nMitylene, and three of which he now fell in with, one having been taken\nby the Athenians, Astyochus did not go on to Mitylene, but raised and\narmed Eresus, and, sending the heavy infantry from his own ships by land\nunder Eteonicus to Antissa and Methymna, himself proceeded alongshore\nthither with the ships which he had with him and with the three Chians,\nin the hope that the Methymnians upon seeing them would be encouraged to\npersevere in their revolt. As, however, everything went against him\nin Lesbos, he took up his own force and sailed back to Chios; the land\nforces on board, which were to have gone to the Hellespont, being also\nconveyed back to their different cities. After this six of the allied\nPeloponnesian ships at Cenchreae joined the forces at Chios. The\nAthenians, after restoring matters to their old state in Lesbos, set\nsail from thence and took Polichna, the place that the Clazomenians were\nfortifying on the continent, and carried the inhabitants back to their\ntown upon the island, except the authors of the revolt, who withdrew to\nDaphnus; and thus Clazomenae became once more Athenian.\n\nThe same summer the Athenians in the twenty ships at Lade, blockading\nMiletus, made a descent at Panormus in the Milesian territory, and\nkilled Chalcideus the Lacedaemonian commander, who had come with a\nfew men against them, and the third day after sailed over and set up\na trophy, which, as they were not masters of the country, was however\npulled down by the Milesians. Meanwhile Leon and Diomedon with the\nAthenian fleet from Lesbos issuing from the Oenussae, the isles off\nChios, and from their forts of Sidussa and Pteleum in the Erythraeid,\nand from Lesbos, carried on the war against the Chians from the ships,\nhaving on board heavy infantry from the rolls pressed to serve as\nmarines. Landing in Cardamyle and in Bolissus they defeated with heavy\nloss the Chians that took the field against them and, laying desolate\nthe places in that neighbourhood, defeated the Chians again in another\nbattle at Phanae, and in a third at Leuconium. After this the Chians\nceased to meet them in the field, while the Athenians devastated the\ncountry, which was beautifully stocked and had remained uninjured ever\nsince the Median wars. Indeed, after the Lacedaemonians, the Chians are\nthe only people that I have known who knew how to be wise in prosperity,\nand who ordered their city the more securely the greater it grew. Nor\nwas this revolt, in which they might seem to have erred on the side of\nrashness, ventured upon until they had numerous and gallant allies to\nshare the danger with them, and until they perceived the Athenians\nafter the Sicilian disaster themselves no longer denying the thoroughly\ndesperate state of their affairs. And if they were thrown out by one\nof the surprises which upset human calculations, they found out their\nmistake in company with many others who believed, like them, in the\nspeedy collapse of the Athenian power. While they were thus blockaded\nfrom the sea and plundered by land, some of the citizens undertook to\nbring the city over to the Athenians. Apprised of this the authorities\ntook no action themselves, but brought Astyochus, the admiral, from\nErythrae, with four ships that he had with him, and considered how they\ncould most quietly, either by taking hostages or by some other means,\nput an end to the conspiracy.\n\nWhile the Chians were thus engaged, a thousand Athenian heavy infantry\nand fifteen hundred Argives (five hundred of whom were light troops\nfurnished with armour by the Athenians), and one thousand of the allies,\ntowards the close of the same summer sailed from Athens in forty-eight\nships, some of which were transports, under the command of Phrynichus,\nOnomacles, and Scironides, and putting into Samos crossed over and\nencamped at Miletus. Upon this the Milesians came out to the number of\neight hundred heavy infantry, with the Peloponnesians who had come with\nChalcideus, and some foreign mercenaries of Tissaphernes, Tissaphernes\nhimself and his cavalry, and engaged the Athenians and their allies.\nWhile the Argives rushed forward on their own wing with the careless\ndisdain of men advancing against Ionians who would never stand their\ncharge, and were defeated by the Milesians with a loss little short of\nthree hundred men, the Athenians first defeated the Peloponnesians, and\ndriving before them the barbarians and the ruck of the army, without\nengaging the Milesians, who after the rout of the Argives retreated into\nthe town upon seeing their comrades worsted, crowned their victory by\ngrounding their arms under the very walls of Miletus. Thus, in this\nbattle, the Ionians on both sides overcame the Dorians, the Athenians\ndefeating the Peloponnesians opposed to them, and the Milesians the\nArgives. After setting up a trophy, the Athenians prepared to draw a\nwall round the place, which stood upon an isthmus; thinking that, if\nthey could gain Miletus, the other towns also would easily come over to\nthem.\n\nMeanwhile about dusk tidings reached them that the fifty-five ships\nfrom Peloponnese and Sicily might be instantly expected. Of these the\nSiceliots, urged principally by the Syracusan Hermocrates to join\nin giving the finishing blow to the power of Athens, furnished\ntwenty-two--twenty from Syracuse, and two from Silenus; and the ships\nthat we left preparing in Peloponnese being now ready, both squadrons\nhad been entrusted to Therimenes, a Lacedaemonian, to take to Astyochus,\nthe admiral. They now put in first at Leros the island off Miletus, and\nfrom thence, discovering that the Athenians were before the town, sailed\ninto the Iasic Gulf, in order to learn how matters stood at Miletus.\nMeanwhile Alcibiades came on horseback to Teichiussa in the Milesian\nterritory, the point of the gulf at which they had put in for the night,\nand told them of the battle in which he had fought in person by the side\nof the Milesians and Tissaphernes, and advised them, if they did not\nwish to sacrifice Ionia and their cause, to fly to the relief of Miletus\nand hinder its investment.\n\nAccordingly they resolved to relieve it the next morning. Meanwhile\nPhrynichus, the Athenian commander, had received precise intelligence of\nthe fleet from Leros, and when his colleagues expressed a wish to keep\nthe sea and fight it out, flatly refused either to stay himself or to\nlet them or any one else do so if he could help it. Where they could\nhereafter contend, after full and undisturbed preparation, with an exact\nknowledge of the number of the enemy's fleet and of the force which they\ncould oppose to him, he would never allow the reproach of disgrace to\ndrive him into a risk that was unreasonable. It was no disgrace for an\nAthenian fleet to retreat when it suited them: put it as they would, it\nwould be more disgraceful to be beaten, and to expose the city not only\nto disgrace, but to the most serious danger. After its late misfortunes\nit could hardly be justified in voluntarily taking the offensive even\nwith the strongest force, except in a case of absolute necessity:\nmuch less then without compulsion could it rush upon peril of its own\nseeking. He told them to take up their wounded as quickly as they could\nand the troops and stores which they had brought with them, and leaving\nbehind what they had taken from the enemy's country, in order to lighten\nthe ships, to sail off to Samos, and there concentrating all their ships\nto attack as opportunity served. As he spoke so he acted; and thus not\nnow more than afterwards, nor in this alone but in all that he had to do\nwith, did Phrynichus show himself a man of sense. In this way that\nvery evening the Athenians broke up from before Miletus, leaving their\nvictory unfinished, and the Argives, mortified at their disaster,\npromptly sailed off home from Samos.\n\nAs soon as it was morning the Peloponnesians weighed from Teichiussa and\nput into Miletus after the departure of the Athenians; they stayed one\nday, and on the next took with them the Chian vessels originally chased\ninto port with Chalcideus, and resolved to sail back for the tackle\nwhich they had put on shore at Teichiussa. Upon their arrival\nTissaphernes came to them with his land forces and induced them to sail\nto Iasus, which was held by his enemy Amorges. Accordingly they suddenly\nattacked and took Iasus, whose inhabitants never imagined that the ships\ncould be other than Athenian. The Syracusans distinguished themselves\nmost in the action. Amorges, a bastard of Pissuthnes and a rebel from\nthe King, was taken alive and handed over to Tissaphernes, to carry to\nthe King, if he chose, according to his orders: Iasus was sacked by the\narmy, who found a very great booty there, the place being wealthy from\nancient date. The mercenaries serving with Amorges the Peloponnesians\nreceived and enrolled in their army without doing them any harm,\nsince most of them came from Peloponnese, and handed over the town to\nTissaphernes with all the captives, bond or free, at the stipulated\nprice of one Doric stater a head; after which they returned to Miletus.\nPedaritus, son of Leon, who had been sent by the Lacedaemonians to take\nthe command at Chios, they dispatched by land as far as Erythrae with\nthe mercenaries taken from Amorges; appointing Philip to remain as\ngovernor of Miletus.\n\nSummer was now over. The winter following, Tissaphernes put Iasus in a\nstate of defence, and passing on to Miletus distributed a month's pay to\nall the ships as he had promised at Lacedaemon, at the rate of an Attic\ndrachma a day for each man. In future, however, he was resolved not to\ngive more than three obols, until he had consulted the King; when if the\nKing should so order he would give, he said, the full drachma. However,\nupon the protest of the Syracusan general Hermocrates (for as Therimenes\nwas not admiral, but only accompanied them in order to hand over the\nships to Astyochus, he made little difficulty about the pay), it was\nagreed that the amount of five ships' pay should be given over and above\nthe three obols a day for each man; Tissaphernes paying thirty talents\na month for fifty-five ships, and to the rest, for as many ships as they\nhad beyond that number, at the same rate.\n\nThe same winter the Athenians in Samos, having been joined by\nthirty-five more vessels from home under Charminus, Strombichides, and\nEuctemon, called in their squadron at Chios and all the rest, intending\nto blockade Miletus with their navy, and to send a fleet and an army\nagainst Chios; drawing lots for the respective services. This intention\nthey carried into effect; Strombichides, Onamacles, and Euctemon sailing\nagainst Chios, which fell to their lot, with thirty ships and a part\nof the thousand heavy infantry, who had been to Miletus, in transports;\nwhile the rest remained masters of the sea with seventy-four ships at\nSamos, and advanced upon Miletus.\n\nMeanwhile Astyochus, whom we left at Chios collecting the hostages\nrequired in consequence of the conspiracy, stopped upon learning that\nthe fleet with Therimenes had arrived, and that the affairs of the\nleague were in a more flourishing condition, and putting out to sea with\nten Peloponnesian and as many Chian vessels, after a futile attack upon\nPteleum, coasted on to Clazomenae, and ordered the Athenian party to\nremove inland to Daphnus, and to join the Peloponnesians, an order in\nwhich also joined Tamos the king's lieutenant in Ionia. This order being\ndisregarded, Astyochus made an attack upon the town, which was unwalled,\nand having failed to take it was himself carried off by a strong gale\nto Phocaea and Cuma, while the rest of the ships put in at the islands\nadjacent to Clazomenae--Marathussa, Pele, and Drymussa. Here they were\ndetained eight days by the winds, and, plundering and consuming all the\nproperty of the Clazomenians there deposited, put the rest on shipboard\nand sailed off to Phocaea and Cuma to join Astyochus.\n\nWhile he was there, envoys arrived from the Lesbians who wished to\nrevolt again. With Astyochus they were successful; but the Corinthians\nand the other allies being averse to it by reason of their former\nfailure, he weighed anchor and set sail for Chios, where they eventually\narrived from different quarters, the fleet having been scattered by a\nstorm. After this Pedaritus, whom we left marching along the coast from\nMiletus, arrived at Erythrae, and thence crossed over with his army to\nChios, where he found also about five hundred soldiers who had been left\nthere by Chalcideus from the five ships with their arms. Meanwhile some\nLesbians making offers to revolt, Astyochus urged upon Pedaritus and the\nChians that they ought to go with their ships and effect the revolt\nof Lesbos, and so increase the number of their allies, or, if not\nsuccessful, at all events harm the Athenians. The Chians, however,\nturned a deaf ear to this, and Pedaritus flatly refused to give up to\nhim the Chian vessels.\n\nUpon this Astyochus took five Corinthian and one Megarian vessel,\nwith another from Hermione, and the ships which had come with him from\nLaconia, and set sail for Miletus to assume his command as admiral;\nafter telling the Chians with many threats that he would certainly\nnot come and help them if they should be in need. At Corycus in the\nErythraeid he brought to for the night; the Athenian armament sailing\nfrom Samos against Chios being only separated from him by a hill, upon\nthe other side of which it brought to; so that neither perceived the\nother. But a letter arriving in the night from Pedaritus to say that\nsome liberated Erythraean prisoners had come from Samos to betray\nErythrae, Astyochus at once put back to Erythrae, and so just escaped\nfalling in with the Athenians. Here Pedaritus sailed over to join him;\nand after inquiry into the pretended treachery, finding that the whole\nstory had been made up to procure the escape of the men from Samos, they\nacquitted them of the charge, and sailed away, Pedaritus to Chios and\nAstyochus to Miletus as he had intended.\n\nMeanwhile the Athenian armament sailing round Corycus fell in with three\nChian men-of-war off Arginus, and gave immediate chase. A great storm\ncoming on, the Chians with difficulty took refuge in the harbour; the\nthree Athenian vessels most forward in the pursuit being wrecked\nand thrown up near the city of Chios, and the crews slain or taken\nprisoners. The rest of the Athenian fleet took refuge in the harbour\ncalled Phoenicus, under Mount Mimas, and from thence afterwards put into\nLesbos and prepared for the work of fortification.\n\nThe same winter the Lacedaemonian Hippocrates sailed out from\nPeloponnese with ten Thurian ships under the command of Dorieus, son of\nDiagoras, and two colleagues, one Laconian and one Syracusan vessel,\nand arrived at Cnidus, which had already revolted at the instigation of\nTissaphernes. When their arrival was known at Miletus, orders came to\nthem to leave half their squadron to guard Cnidus, and with the rest to\ncruise round Triopium and seize all the merchantmen arriving from Egypt.\nTriopium is a promontory of Cnidus and sacred to Apollo. This coming to\nthe knowledge of the Athenians, they sailed from Samos and captured\nthe six ships on the watch at Triopium, the crews escaping out of them.\nAfter this the Athenians sailed into Cnidus and made an assault upon\nthe town, which was unfortified, and all but took it; and the next\nday assaulted it again, but with less effect, as the inhabitants had\nimproved their defences during the night, and had been reinforced by the\ncrews escaped from the ships at Triopium. The Athenians now withdrew,\nand after plundering the Cnidian territory sailed back to Samos.\n\nAbout the same time Astyochus came to the fleet at Miletus. The\nPeloponnesian camp was still plentifully supplied, being in receipt of\nsufficient pay, and the soldiers having still in hand the large booty\ntaken at Iasus. The Milesians also showed great ardour for the war.\nNevertheless the Peloponnesians thought the first convention with\nTissaphernes, made with Chalcideus, defective, and more advantageous\nto him than to them, and consequently while Therimenes was still there\nconcluded another, which was as follows:\n\nThe convention of the Lacedaemonians and the allies with King Darius and\nthe sons of the King, and with Tissaphernes for a treaty and friendship,\nas follows:\n\n1. Neither the Lacedaemonians nor the allies of the Lacedaemonians shall\nmake war against or otherwise injure any country or cities that belong\nto King Darius or did belong to his father or to his ancestors; neither\nshall the Lacedaemonians nor the allies of the Lacedaemonians exact\ntribute from such cities. Neither shall King Darius nor any of\nthe subjects of the King make war against or otherwise injure the\nLacedaemonians or their allies.\n\n2. If the Lacedaemonians or their allies should require any assistance\nfrom the King, or the King from the Lacedaemonians or their allies,\nwhatever they both agree upon they shall be right in doing.\n\n3. Both shall carry on jointly the war against the Athenians and their\nallies: and if they make peace, both shall do so jointly.\n\n4. The expense of all troops in the King's country, sent for by the\nKing, shall be borne by the King.\n\n5. If any of the states comprised in this convention with the King\nattack the King's country, the rest shall stop them and aid the King\nto the best of their power. And if any in the King's country or in the\ncountries under the King's rule attack the country of the Lacedaemonians\nor their allies, the King shall stop it and help them to the best of his\npower.\n\nAfter this convention Therimenes handed over the fleet to Astyochus,\nsailed off in a small boat, and was lost. The Athenian armament had\nnow crossed over from Lesbos to Chios, and being master by sea and land\nbegan to fortify Delphinium, a place naturally strong on the land side,\nprovided with more than one harbour, and also not far from the city of\nChios. Meanwhile the Chians remained inactive. Already defeated in\nso many battles, they were now also at discord among themselves; the\nexecution of the party of Tydeus, son of Ion, by Pedaritus upon the\ncharge of Atticism, followed by the forcible imposition of an oligarchy\nupon the rest of the city, having made them suspicious of one another;\nand they therefore thought neither themselves not the mercenaries under\nPedaritus a match for the enemy. They sent, however, to Miletus to beg\nAstyochus to assist them, which he refused to do, and was accordingly\ndenounced at Lacedaemon by Pedaritus as a traitor. Such was the state of\nthe Athenian affairs at Chios; while their fleet at Samos kept sailing\nout against the enemy in Miletus, until they found that he would not\naccept their challenge, and then retired again to Samos and remained\nquiet.\n\nIn the same winter the twenty-seven ships equipped by the Lacedaemonians\nfor Pharnabazus through the agency of the Megarian Calligeitus, and the\nCyzicene Timagoras, put out from Peloponnese and sailed for Ionia about\nthe time of the solstice, under the command of Antisthenes, a Spartan.\nWith them the Lacedaemonians also sent eleven Spartans as advisers to\nAstyochus; Lichas, son of Arcesilaus, being among the number. Arrived at\nMiletus, their orders were to aid in generally superintending the good\nconduct of the war; to send off the above ships or a greater or less\nnumber to the Hellespont to Pharnabazus, if they thought proper,\nappointing Clearchus, son of Ramphias, who sailed with them, to the\ncommand; and further, if they thought proper, to make Antisthenes\nadmiral, dismissing Astyochus, whom the letters of Pedaritus had caused\nto be regarded with suspicion. Sailing accordingly from Malea across\nthe open sea, the squadron touched at Melos and there fell in with ten\nAthenian ships, three of which they took empty and burned. After this,\nbeing afraid that the Athenian vessels escaped from Melos might, as\nthey in fact did, give information of their approach to the Athenians at\nSamos, they sailed to Crete, and having lengthened their voyage by\nway of precaution made land at Caunus in Asia, from whence considering\nthemselves in safety they sent a message to the fleet at Miletus for a\nconvoy along the coast.\n\nMeanwhile the Chians and Pedaritus, undeterred by the backwardness of\nAstyochus, went on sending messengers pressing him to come with all\nthe fleet to assist them against their besiegers, and not to leave the\ngreatest of the allied states in Ionia to be shut up by sea and overrun\nand pillaged by land. There were more slaves at Chios than in any one\nother city except Lacedaemon, and being also by reason of their numbers\npunished more rigorously when they offended, most of them, when they saw\nthe Athenian armament firmly established in the island with a fortified\nposition, immediately deserted to the enemy, and through their knowledge\nof the country did the greatest mischief. The Chians therefore urged\nupon Astyochus that it was his duty to assist them, while there was\nstill a hope and a possibility of stopping the enemy's progress, while\nDelphinium was still in process of fortification and unfinished, and\nbefore the completion of a higher rampart which was being added to\nprotect the camp and fleet of their besiegers. Astyochus now saw that\nthe allies also wished it and prepared to go, in spite of his intention\nto the contrary owing to the threat already referred to.\n\nIn the meantime news came from Caunus of the arrival of the twenty-seven\nships with the Lacedaemonian commissioners; and Astyochus, postponing\neverything to the duty of convoying a fleet of that importance, in\norder to be more able to command the sea, and to the safe conduct of the\nLacedaemonians sent as spies over his behaviour, at once gave up going\nto Chios and set sail for Caunus. As he coasted along he landed at the\nMeropid Cos and sacked the city, which was unfortified and had been\nlately laid in ruins by an earthquake, by far the greatest in living\nmemory, and, as the inhabitants had fled to the mountains, overran the\ncountry and made booty of all it contained, letting go, however, the\nfree men. From Cos arriving in the night at Cnidus he was constrained by\nthe representations of the Cnidians not to disembark the sailors, but to\nsail as he was straight against the twenty Athenian vessels, which with\nCharminus, one of the commanders at Samos, were on the watch for the\nvery twenty-seven ships from Peloponnese which Astyochus was himself\nsailing to join; the Athenians in Samos having heard from Melos of their\napproach, and Charminus being on the look-out off Syme, Chalce, Rhodes,\nand Lycia, as he now heard that they were at Caunus.\n\nAstyochus accordingly sailed as he was to Syme, before he was heard of,\nin the hope of catching the enemy somewhere out at sea. Rain, however,\nand foggy weather encountered him, and caused his ships to straggle\nand get into disorder in the dark. In the morning his fleet had parted\ncompany and was most of it still straggling round the island, and the\nleft wing only in sight of Charminus and the Athenians, who took it for\nthe squadron which they were watching for from Caunus, and hastily put\nout against it with part only of their twenty vessels, and attacking\nimmediately sank three ships and disabled others, and had the advantage\nin the action until the main body of the fleet unexpectedly hove in\nsight, when they were surrounded on every side. Upon this they took to\nflight, and after losing six ships with the rest escaped to Teutlussa\nor Beet Island, and from thence to Halicarnassus. After this the\nPeloponnesians put into Cnidus and, being joined by the twenty-seven\nships from Caunus, sailed all together and set up a trophy in Syme, and\nthen returned to anchor at Cnidus.\n\nAs soon as the Athenians knew of the sea-fight, they sailed with all the\nships at Samos to Syme, and, without attacking or being attacked by the\nfleet at Cnidus, took the ships' tackle left at Syme, and touching at\nLorymi on the mainland sailed back to Samos. Meanwhile the Peloponnesian\nships, being now all at Cnidus, underwent such repairs as were\nneeded; while the eleven Lacedaemonian commissioners conferred with\nTissaphernes, who had come to meet them, upon the points which did not\nsatisfy them in the past transactions, and upon the best and mutually\nmost advantageous manner of conducting the war in future. The severest\ncritic of the present proceedings was Lichas, who said that neither\nof the treaties could stand, neither that of Chalcideus, nor that of\nTherimenes; it being monstrous that the King should at this date pretend\nto the possession of all the country formerly ruled by himself or by his\nancestors--a pretension which implicitly put back under the yoke all the\nislands--Thessaly, Locris, and everything as far as Boeotia--and made\nthe Lacedaemonians give to the Hellenes instead of liberty a Median\nmaster. He therefore invited Tissaphernes to conclude another and a\nbetter treaty, as they certainly would not recognize those existing\nand did not want any of his pay upon such conditions. This offended\nTissaphernes so much that he went away in a rage without settling\nanything.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n_Twentieth and Twenty-first Years of the War--Intrigues of\nAlcibiades--Withdrawal of the Persian Subsidies--Oligarchical Coup\nd'Etat at Athens--Patriotism of the Army at Samos_\n\nThe Peloponnesians now determined to sail to Rhodes, upon the invitation\nof some of the principal men there, hoping to gain an island powerful by\nthe number of its seamen and by its land forces, and also thinking that\nthey would be able to maintain their fleet from their own confederacy,\nwithout having to ask for money from Tissaphernes. They accordingly\nat once set sail that same winter from Cnidus, and first put in with\nninety-four ships at Camirus in the Rhodian country, to the great alarm\nof the mass of the inhabitants, who were not privy to the intrigue, and\nwho consequently fled, especially as the town was unfortified. They were\nafterwards, however, assembled by the Lacedaemonians together with\nthe inhabitants of the two other towns of Lindus and Ialysus; and the\nRhodians were persuaded to revolt from the Athenians and the island went\nover to the Peloponnesians. Meanwhile the Athenians had received the\nalarm and set sail with the fleet from Samos to forestall them, and came\nwithin sight of the island, but being a little too late sailed off for\nthe moment to Chalce, and from thence to Samos, and subsequently waged\nwar against Rhodes, issuing from Chalce, Cos, and Samos.\n\nThe Peloponnesians now levied a contribution of thirty-two talents from\nthe Rhodians, after which they hauled their ships ashore and for eighty\ndays remained inactive. During this time, and even earlier, before they\nremoved to Rhodes, the following intrigues took place. After the\ndeath of Chalcideus and the battle at Miletus, Alcibiades began to be\nsuspected by the Peloponnesians; and Astyochus received from Lacedaemon\nan order from them to put him to death, he being the personal enemy of\nAgis, and in other respects thought unworthy of confidence. Alcibiades\nin his alarm first withdrew to Tissaphernes, and immediately began to\ndo all he could with him to injure the Peloponnesian cause. Henceforth\nbecoming his adviser in everything, he cut down the pay from an Attic\ndrachma to three obols a day, and even this not paid too regularly; and\ntold Tissaphernes to say to the Peloponnesians that the Athenians, whose\nmaritime experience was of an older date than their own, only gave their\nmen three obols, not so much from poverty as to prevent their seamen\nbeing corrupted by being too well off, and injuring their condition by\nspending money upon enervating indulgences, and also paid their crews\nirregularly in order to have a security against their deserting in the\narrears which they would leave behind them. He also told Tissaphernes\nto bribe the captains and generals of the cities, and so to obtain their\nconnivance--an expedient which succeeded with all except the Syracusans,\nHermocrates alone opposing him on behalf of the whole confederacy.\nMeanwhile the cities asking for money Alcibiades sent off, by roundly\ntelling them in the name of Tissaphernes that it was great impudence\nin the Chians, the richest people in Hellas, not content with being\ndefended by a foreign force, to expect others to risk not only their\nlives but their money as well in behalf of their freedom; while the\nother cities, he said, had had to pay largely to Athens before their\nrebellion, and could not justly refuse to contribute as much or even\nmore now for their own selves. He also pointed out that Tissaphernes was\nat present carrying on the war at his own charges, and had good cause\nfor economy, but that as soon as he received remittances from the king\nhe would give them their pay in full and do what was reasonable for the\ncities.\n\nAlcibiades further advised Tissaphernes not to be in too great a\nhurry to end the war, or to let himself be persuaded to bring up the\nPhoenician fleet which he was equipping, or to provide pay for more\nHellenes, and thus put the power by land and sea into the same hands;\nbut to leave each of the contending parties in possession of one\nelement, thus enabling the king when he found one troublesome to call\nin the other. For if the command of the sea and land were united in one\nhand, he would not know where to turn for help to overthrow the dominant\npower; unless he at last chose to stand up himself, and go through with\nthe struggle at great expense and hazard. The cheapest plan was to let\nthe Hellenes wear each other out, at a small share of the expense and\nwithout risk to himself. Besides, he would find the Athenians the most\nconvenient partners in empire as they did not aim at conquests on\nshore, and carried on the war upon principles and with a practice most\nadvantageous to the King; being prepared to combine to conquer the sea\nfor Athens, and for the King all the Hellenes inhabiting his country,\nwhom the Peloponnesians, on the contrary, had come to liberate. Now it\nwas not likely that the Lacedaemonians would free the Hellenes from the\nHellenic Athenians, without freeing them also from the barbarian Mede,\nunless overthrown by him in the meanwhile. Alcibiades therefore urged\nhim to wear them both out at first, and, after docking the Athenian\npower as much as he could, forthwith to rid the country of the\nPeloponnesians. In the main Tissaphernes approved of this policy, so far\nat least as could be conjectured from his behaviour; since he now gave\nhis confidence to Alcibiades in recognition of his good advice, and kept\nthe Peloponnesians short of money, and would not let them fight at sea,\nbut ruined their cause by pretending that the Phoenician fleet would\narrive, and that they would thus be enabled to contend with the odds in\ntheir favour, and so made their navy lose its efficiency, which had been\nvery remarkable, and generally betrayed a coolness in the war that was\ntoo plain to be mistaken.\n\nAlcibiades gave this advice to Tissaphernes and the King, with whom he\nthen was, not merely because he thought it really the best, but because\nhe was studying means to effect his restoration to his country, well\nknowing that if he did not destroy it he might one day hope to persuade\nthe Athenians to recall him, and thinking that his best chance of\npersuading them lay in letting them see that he possessed the favour of\nTissaphernes. The event proved him to be right. When the Athenians at\nSamos found that he had influence with Tissaphernes, principally of\ntheir own motion (though partly also through Alcibiades himself sending\nword to their chief men to tell the best men in the army that, if there\nwere only an oligarchy in the place of the rascally democracy that had\nbanished him, he would be glad to return to his country and to make\nTissaphernes their friend), the captains and chief men in the armament\nat once embraced the idea of subverting the democracy.\n\nThe design was first mooted in the camp, and afterwards from thence\nreached the city. Some persons crossed over from Samos and had an\ninterview with Alcibiades, who immediately offered to make first\nTissaphernes, and afterwards the King, their friend, if they would give\nup the democracy and make it possible for the King to trust them.\nThe higher class, who also suffered most severely from the war, now\nconceived great hopes of getting the government into their own hands,\nand of triumphing over the enemy. Upon their return to Samos the\nemissaries formed their partisans into a club, and openly told the mass\nof the armament that the King would be their friend, and would\nprovide them with money, if Alcibiades were restored and the democracy\nabolished. The multitude, if at first irritated by these intrigues, were\nnevertheless kept quiet by the advantageous prospect of the pay from the\nKing; and the oligarchical conspirators, after making this communication\nto the people, now re-examined the proposals of Alcibiades among\nthemselves, with most of their associates. Unlike the rest, who thought\nthem advantageous and trustworthy, Phrynichus, who was still general,\nby no means approved of the proposals. Alcibiades, he rightly thought,\ncared no more for an oligarchy than for a democracy, and only sought to\nchange the institutions of his country in order to get himself recalled\nby his associates; while for themselves their one object should be\nto avoid civil discord. It was not the King's interest, when the\nPeloponnesians were now their equals at sea, and in possession of some\nof the chief cities in his empire, to go out of his way to side with\nthe Athenians whom he did not trust, when he might make friends of the\nPeloponnesians who had never injured him. And as for the allied states\nto whom oligarchy was now offered, because the democracy was to be put\ndown at Athens, he well knew that this would not make the rebels come in\nany the sooner, or confirm the loyal in their allegiance; as the allies\nwould never prefer servitude with an oligarchy or democracy to freedom\nwith the constitution which they actually enjoyed, to whichever type it\nbelonged. Besides, the cities thought that the so-called better classes\nwould prove just as oppressive as the commons, as being those who\noriginated, proposed, and for the most part benefited from the acts of\nthe commons injurious to the confederates. Indeed, if it depended on the\nbetter classes, the confederates would be put to death without trial and\nwith violence; while the commons were their refuge and the chastiser\nof these men. This he positively knew that the cities had learned\nby experience, and that such was their opinion. The propositions of\nAlcibiades, and the intrigues now in progress, could therefore never\nmeet with his approval.\n\nHowever, the members of the club assembled, agreeably to their original\ndetermination, accepted what was proposed, and prepared to send Pisander\nand others on an embassy to Athens to treat for the restoration of\nAlcibiades and the abolition of the democracy in the city, and thus to\nmake Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians.\n\nPhrynichus now saw that there would be a proposal to restore Alcibiades,\nand that the Athenians would consent to it; and fearing after what he\nhad said against it that Alcibiades, if restored, would revenge himself\nupon him for his opposition, had recourse to the following expedient.\nHe sent a secret letter to the Lacedaemonian admiral Astyochus, who was\nstill in the neighbourhood of Miletus, to tell him that Alcibiades was\nruining their cause by making Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians,\nand containing an express revelation of the rest of the intrigue,\ndesiring to be excused if he sought to harm his enemy even at the\nexpense of the interests of his country. However, Astyochus, instead\nof thinking of punishing Alcibiades, who, besides, no longer ventured\nwithin his reach as formerly, went up to him and Tissaphernes at\nMagnesia, communicated to them the letter from Samos, and turned\ninformer, and, if report may be trusted, became the paid creature\nof Tissaphernes, undertaking to inform him as to this and all other\nmatters; which was also the reason why he did not remonstrate more\nstrongly against the pay not being given in full. Upon this Alcibiades\ninstantly sent to the authorities at Samos a letter against Phrynichus,\nstating what he had done, and requiring that he should be put to\ndeath. Phrynichus distracted, and placed in the utmost peril by the\ndenunciation, sent again to Astyochus, reproaching him with having so\nill kept the secret of his previous letter, and saying that he was now\nprepared to give them an opportunity of destroying the whole Athenian\narmament at Samos; giving a detailed account of the means which he\nshould employ, Samos being unfortified, and pleading that, being in\ndanger of his life on their account, he could not now be blamed for\ndoing this or anything else to escape being destroyed by his mortal\nenemies. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades.\n\nMeanwhile Phrynichus having had timely notice that he was playing him\nfalse, and that a letter on the subject was on the point of arriving\nfrom Alcibiades, himself anticipated the news, and told the army that\nthe enemy, seeing that Samos was unfortified and the fleet not all\nstationed within the harbour, meant to attack the camp, that he could\nbe certain of this intelligence, and that they must fortify Samos as\nquickly as possible, and generally look to their defences. It will be\nremembered that he was general, and had himself authority to carry out\nthese measures. Accordingly they addressed themselves to the work\nof fortification, and Samos was thus fortified sooner than it\nwould otherwise have been. Not long afterwards came the letter from\nAlcibiades, saying that the army was betrayed by Phrynichus, and the\nenemy about to attack it. Alcibiades, however, gained no credit, it\nbeing thought that he was in the secret of the enemy's designs, and had\ntried to fasten them upon Phrynichus, and to make out that he was their\naccomplice, out of hatred; and consequently far from hurting him he\nrather bore witness to what he had said by this intelligence.\n\nAfter this Alcibiades set to work to persuade Tissaphernes to become\nthe friend of the Athenians. Tissaphernes, although afraid of the\nPeloponnesians because they had more ships in Asia than the Athenians,\nwas yet disposed to be persuaded if he could, especially after\nhis quarrel with the Peloponnesians at Cnidus about the treaty of\nTherimenes. The quarrel had already taken place, as the Peloponnesians\nwere by this time actually at Rhodes; and in it the original argument\nof Alcibiades touching the liberation of all the towns by the\nLacedaemonians had been verified by the declaration of Lichas that it\nwas impossible to submit to a convention which made the King master of\nall the states at any former time ruled by himself or by his fathers.\n\nWhile Alcibiades was besieging the favour of Tissaphernes with an\nearnestness proportioned to the greatness of the issue, the Athenian\nenvoys who had been dispatched from Samos with Pisander arrived at\nAthens, and made a speech before the people, giving a brief summary\nof their views, and particularly insisting that, if Alcibiades were\nrecalled and the democratic constitution changed, they could have the\nKing as their ally, and would be able to overcome the Peloponnesians.\nA number of speakers opposed them on the question of the democracy, the\nenemies of Alcibiades cried out against the scandal of a restoration to\nbe effected by a violation of the constitution, and the Eumolpidae\nand Ceryces protested in behalf of the mysteries, the cause of his\nbanishment, and called upon the gods to avert his recall; when Pisander,\nin the midst of much opposition and abuse, came forward, and taking each\nof his opponents aside asked him the following question: In the face\nof the fact that the Peloponnesians had as many ships as their own\nconfronting them at sea, more cities in alliance with them, and the King\nand Tissaphernes to supply them with money, of which the Athenians had\nnone left, had he any hope of saving the state, unless someone could\ninduce the King to come over to their side? Upon their replying that\nthey had not, he then plainly said to them: \"This we cannot have unless\nwe have a more moderate form of government, and put the offices into\nfewer hands, and so gain the King's confidence, and forthwith restore\nAlcibiades, who is the only man living that can bring this about. The\nsafety of the state, not the form of its government, is for the moment\nthe most pressing question, as we can always change afterwards whatever\nwe do not like.\"\n\nThe people were at first highly irritated at the mention of an\noligarchy, but upon understanding clearly from Pisander that this was\nthe only resource left, they took counsel of their fears, and promised\nthemselves some day to change the government again, and gave way. They\naccordingly voted that Pisander should sail with ten others and make the\nbest arrangement that they could with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades. At\nthe same time the people, upon a false accusation of Pisander, dismissed\nPhrynichus from his post together with his colleague Scironides, sending\nDiomedon and Leon to replace them in the command of the fleet. The\naccusation was that Phrynichus had betrayed Iasus and Amorges; and\nPisander brought it because he thought him a man unfit for the business\nnow in hand with Alcibiades. Pisander also went the round of all the\nclubs already existing in the city for help in lawsuits and elections,\nand urged them to draw together and to unite their efforts for the\noverthrow of the democracy; and after taking all other measures required\nby the circumstances, so that no time might be lost, set off with his\nten companions on his voyage to Tissaphernes.\n\nIn the same winter Leon and Diomedon, who had by this time joined the\nfleet, made an attack upon Rhodes. The ships of the Peloponnesians they\nfound hauled up on shore, and, after making a descent upon the coast and\ndefeating the Rhodians who appeared in the field against them, withdrew\nto Chalce and made that place their base of operations instead of Cos,\nas they could better observe from thence if the Peloponnesian fleet\nput out to sea. Meanwhile Xenophantes, a Laconian, came to Rhodes\nfrom Pedaritus at Chios, with the news that the fortification of the\nAthenians was now finished, and that, unless the whole Peloponnesian\nfleet came to the rescue, the cause in Chios must be lost. Upon this\nthey resolved to go to his relief. In the meantime Pedaritus, with the\nmercenaries that he had with him and the whole force of the Chians, made\nan assault upon the work round the Athenian ships and took a portion\nof it, and got possession of some vessels that were hauled up on shore,\nwhen the Athenians sallied out to the rescue, and first routing the\nChians, next defeated the remainder of the force round Pedaritus, who\nwas himself killed, with many of the Chians, a great number of arms\nbeing also taken.\n\nAfter this the Chians were besieged even more straitly than before\nby land and sea, and the famine in the place was great. Meanwhile the\nAthenian envoys with Pisander arrived at the court of Tissaphernes, and\nconferred with him about the proposed agreement. However, Alcibiades,\nnot being altogether sure of Tissaphernes (who feared the Peloponnesians\nmore than the Athenians, and besides wished to wear out both parties,\nas Alcibiades himself had recommended), had recourse to the following\nstratagem to make the treaty between the Athenians and Tissaphernes\nmiscarry by reason of the magnitude of his demands. In my opinion\nTissaphernes desired this result, fear being his motive; while\nAlcibiades, who now saw that Tissaphernes was determined not to treat\non any terms, wished the Athenians to think, not that he was unable to\npersuade Tissaphernes, but that after the latter had been persuaded and\nwas willing to join them, they had not conceded enough to him. For the\ndemands of Alcibiades, speaking for Tissaphernes, who was present, were\nso extravagant that the Athenians, although for a long while they agreed\nto whatever he asked, yet had to bear the blame of failure: he required\nthe cession of the whole of Ionia, next of the islands adjacent, besides\nother concessions, and these passed without opposition; at last, in the\nthird interview, Alcibiades, who now feared a complete discovery of his\ninability, required them to allow the King to build ships and sail along\nhis own coast wherever and with as many as he pleased. Upon this the\nAthenians would yield no further, and concluding that there was nothing\nto be done, but that they had been deceived by Alcibiades, went away in\na passion and proceeded to Samos.\n\nTissaphernes immediately after this, in the same winter, proceeded\nalong shore to Caunus, desiring to bring the Peloponnesian fleet back\nto Miletus, and to supply them with pay, making a fresh convention upon\nsuch terms as he could get, in order not to bring matters to an absolute\nbreach between them. He was afraid that if many of their ships were left\nwithout pay they would be compelled to engage and be defeated, or that\ntheir vessels being left without hands the Athenians would attain\ntheir objects without his assistance. Still more he feared that the\nPeloponnesians might ravage the continent in search of supplies. Having\ncalculated and considered all this, agreeably to his plan of keeping the\ntwo sides equal, he now sent for the Peloponnesians and gave them pay,\nand concluded with them a third treaty in words following:\n\nIn the thirteenth year of the reign of Darius, while Alexippidas was\nephor at Lacedaemon, a convention was concluded in the plain of the\nMaeander by the Lacedaemonians and their allies with Tissaphernes,\nHieramenes, and the sons of Pharnaces, concerning the affairs of the\nKing and of the Lacedaemonians and their allies.\n\n1. The country of the King in Asia shall be the King's, and the King\nshall treat his own country as he pleases.\n\n2. The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall not invade or injure the\nKing's country: neither shall the King invade or injure that of the\nLacedaemonians or of their allies. If any of the Lacedaemonians or of\ntheir allies invade or injure the King's country, the Lacedaemonians and\ntheir allies shall prevent it: and if any from the King's country invade\nor injure the country of the Lacedaemonians or of their allies, the King\nshall prevent it.\n\n3. Tissaphernes shall provide pay for the ships now present, according\nto the agreement, until the arrival of the King's vessels: but after the\narrival of the King's vessels the Lacedaemonians and their allies may\npay their own ships if they wish it. If, however, they choose to receive\nthe pay from Tissaphernes, Tissaphernes shall furnish it: and the\nLacedaemonians and their allies shall repay him at the end of the war\nsuch moneys as they shall have received.\n\n4. After the vessels have arrived, the ships of the Lacedaemonians and\nof their allies and those of the King shall carry on the war jointly,\naccording as Tissaphernes and the Lacedaemonians and their allies shall\nthink best. If they wish to make peace with the Athenians, they shall\nmake peace also jointly.\n\nThis was the treaty. After this Tissaphernes prepared to bring up the\nPhoenician fleet according to agreement, and to make good his other\npromises, or at all events wished to make it appear that he was so\npreparing.\n\nWinter was now drawing towards its close, when the Boeotians took Oropus\nby treachery, though held by an Athenian garrison. Their accomplices in\nthis were some of the Eretrians and of the Oropians themselves, who\nwere plotting the revolt of Euboea, as the place was exactly opposite\nEretria, and while in Athenian hands was necessarily a source of great\nannoyance to Eretria and the rest of Euboea. Oropus being in their\nhands, the Eretrians now came to Rhodes to invite the Peloponnesians\ninto Euboea. The latter, however, were rather bent on the relief of the\ndistressed Chians, and accordingly put out to sea and sailed with all\ntheir ships from Rhodes. Off Triopium they sighted the Athenian fleet\nout at sea sailing from Chalce, and, neither attacking the other,\narrived, the latter at Samos, the Peloponnesians at Miletus, seeing that\nit was no longer possible to relieve Chios without a battle. And this\nwinter ended, and with it ended the twentieth year of this war of which\nThucydides is the historian.\n\nEarly in the spring of the summer following, Dercyllidas, a Spartan, was\nsent with a small force by land to the Hellespont to effect the revolt\nof Abydos, which is a Milesian colony; and the Chians, while Astyochus\nwas at a loss how to help them, were compelled to fight at sea by the\npressure of the siege. While Astyochus was still at Rhodes they had\nreceived from Miletus, as their commander after the death of Pedaritus,\na Spartan named Leon, who had come out with Antisthenes, and twelve\nvessels which had been on guard at Miletus, five of which were Thurian,\nfour Syracusans, one from Anaia, one Milesian, and one Leon's own.\nAccordingly the Chians marched out in mass and took up a strong\nposition, while thirty-six of their ships put out and engaged thirty-two\nof the Athenians; and after a tough fight, in which the Chians and their\nallies had rather the best of it, as it was now late, retired to their\ncity.\n\nImmediately after this Dercyllidas arrived by land from Miletus; and\nAbydos in the Hellespont revolted to him and Pharnabazus, and Lampsacus\ntwo days later. Upon receipt of this news Strombichides hastily sailed\nfrom Chios with twenty-four Athenian ships, some transports carrying\nheavy infantry being of the number, and defeating the Lampsacenes who\ncame out against him, took Lampsacus, which was unfortified, at the\nfirst assault, and making prize of the slaves and goods restored the\nfreemen to their homes, and went on to Abydos. The inhabitants, however,\nrefusing to capitulate, and his assaults failing to take the place, he\nsailed over to the coast opposite, and appointed Sestos, the town in the\nChersonese held by the Medes at a former period in this history, as the\ncentre for the defence of the whole Hellespont.\n\nIn the meantime the Chians commanded the sea more than before; and the\nPeloponnesians at Miletus and Astyochus, hearing of the sea-fight and\nof the departure of the squadron with Strombichides, took fresh courage.\nCoasting along with two vessels to Chios, Astyochus took the ships from\nthat place, and now moved with the whole fleet upon Samos, from whence,\nhowever, he sailed back to Miletus, as the Athenians did not put out\nagainst him, owing to their suspicions of one another. For it was about\nthis time, or even before, that the democracy was put down at Athens.\nWhen Pisander and the envoys returned from Tissaphernes to Samos they at\nonce strengthened still further their interest in the army itself, and\ninstigated the upper class in Samos to join them in establishing an\noligarchy, the very form of government which a party of them had\nlately risen to avoid. At the same time the Athenians at Samos, after a\nconsultation among themselves, determined to let Alcibiades alone, since\nhe refused to join them, and besides was not the man for an oligarchy;\nand now that they were once embarked, to see for themselves how they\ncould best prevent the ruin of their cause, and meanwhile to sustain the\nwar, and to contribute without stint money and all else that might be\nrequired from their own private estates, as they would henceforth labour\nfor themselves alone.\n\nAfter encouraging each other in these resolutions, they now at once\nsent off half the envoys and Pisander to do what was necessary at Athens\n(with instructions to establish oligarchies on their way in all the\nsubject cities which they might touch at), and dispatched the other half\nin different directions to the other dependencies. Diitrephes also, who\nwas in the neighbourhood of Chios, and had been elected to the command\nof the Thracian towns, was sent off to his government, and arriving\nat Thasos abolished the democracy there. Two months, however, had not\nelapsed after his departure before the Thasians began to fortify their\ntown, being already tired of an aristocracy with Athens, and in daily\nexpectation of freedom from Lacedaemon. Indeed there was a party of them\n(whom the Athenians had banished), with the Peloponnesians, who with\ntheir friends in the town were already making every exertion to bring\na squadron, and to effect the revolt of Thasos; and this party thus saw\nexactly what they most wanted done, that is to say, the reformation of\nthe government without risk, and the abolition of the democracy which\nwould have opposed them. Things at Thasos thus turned out just the\ncontrary to what the oligarchical conspirators at Athens expected; and\nthe same in my opinion was the case in many of the other dependencies;\nas the cities no sooner got a moderate government and liberty of action,\nthan they went on to absolute freedom without being at all seduced by\nthe show of reform offered by the Athenians.\n\nPisander and his colleagues on their voyage alongshore abolished, as had\nbeen determined, the democracies in the cities, and also took some heavy\ninfantry from certain places as their allies, and so came to Athens.\nHere they found most of the work already done by their associates. Some\nof the younger men had banded together, and secretly assassinated one\nAndrocles, the chief leader of the commons, and mainly responsible for\nthe banishment of Alcibiades; Androcles being singled out both because\nhe was a popular leader and because they sought by his death to\nrecommend themselves to Alcibiades, who was, as they supposed, to be\nrecalled, and to make Tissaphernes their friend. There were also some\nother obnoxious persons whom they secretly did away with in the same\nmanner. Meanwhile their cry in public was that no pay should be given\nexcept to persons serving in the war, and that not more than five\nthousand should share in the government, and those such as were most\nable to serve the state in person and in purse.\n\nBut this was a mere catchword for the multitude, as the authors of the\nrevolution were really to govern. However, the Assembly and the Council\nof the Bean still met notwithstanding, although they discussed nothing\nthat was not approved of by the conspirators, who both supplied the\nspeakers and reviewed in advance what they were to say. Fear, and the\nsight of the numbers of the conspirators, closed the mouths of the rest;\nor if any ventured to rise in opposition, he was presently put to death\nin some convenient way, and there was neither search for the murderers\nnor justice to be had against them if suspected; but the people remained\nmotionless, being so thoroughly cowed that men thought themselves lucky\nto escape violence, even when they held their tongues. An exaggerated\nbelief in the numbers of the conspirators also demoralized the people,\nrendered helpless by the magnitude of the city, and by their want of\nintelligence with each other, and being without means of finding out\nwhat those numbers really were. For the same reason it was impossible\nfor any one to open his grief to a neighbour and to concert measures to\ndefend himself, as he would have had to speak either to one whom he\ndid not know, or whom he knew but did not trust. Indeed all the popular\nparty approached each other with suspicion, each thinking his neighbour\nconcerned in what was going on, the conspirators having in their ranks\npersons whom no one could ever have believed capable of joining an\noligarchy; and these it was who made the many so suspicious, and so\nhelped to procure impunity for the few, by confirming the commons in\ntheir mistrust of one another.\n\nAt this juncture arrived Pisander and his colleagues, who lost no time\nin doing the rest. First they assembled the people, and moved to elect\nten commissioners with full powers to frame a constitution, and that\nwhen this was done they should on an appointed day lay before the people\ntheir opinion as to the best mode of governing the city. Afterwards,\nwhen the day arrived, the conspirators enclosed the assembly in Colonus,\na temple of Poseidon, a little more than a mile outside the city; when\nthe commissioners simply brought forward this single motion, that any\nAthenian might propose with impunity whatever measure he pleased, heavy\npenalties being imposed upon any who should indict for illegality, or\notherwise molest him for so doing. The way thus cleared, it was now\nplainly declared that all tenure of office and receipt of pay under the\nexisting institutions were at an end, and that five men must be elected\nas presidents, who should in their turn elect one hundred, and each\nof the hundred three apiece; and that this body thus made up to four\nhundred should enter the council chamber with full powers and govern\nas they judged best, and should convene the five thousand whenever they\npleased.\n\nThe man who moved this resolution was Pisander, who was throughout\nthe chief ostensible agent in putting down the democracy. But he who\nconcerted the whole affair, and prepared the way for the catastrophe,\nand who had given the greatest thought to the matter, was Antiphon,\none of the best men of his day in Athens; who, with a head to contrive\nmeasures and a tongue to recommend them, did not willingly come forward\nin the assembly or upon any public scene, being ill looked upon by the\nmultitude owing to his reputation for talent; and who yet was the one\nman best able to aid in the courts, or before the assembly, the suitors\nwho required his opinion. Indeed, when he was afterwards himself tried\nfor his life on the charge of having been concerned in setting up this\nvery government, when the Four Hundred were overthrown and hardly dealt\nwith by the commons, he made what would seem to be the best defence of\nany known up to my time. Phrynichus also went beyond all others in his\nzeal for the oligarchy. Afraid of Alcibiades, and assured that he was\nno stranger to his intrigues with Astyochus at Samos, he held that\nno oligarchy was ever likely to restore him, and once embarked in the\nenterprise, proved, where danger was to be faced, by far the staunchest\nof them all. Theramenes, son of Hagnon, was also one of the foremost of\nthe subverters of the democracy--a man as able in council as in debate.\nConducted by so many and by such sagacious heads, the enterprise, great\nas it was, not unnaturally went forward; although it was no light matter\nto deprive the Athenian people of its freedom, almost a hundred years\nafter the deposition of the tyrants, when it had been not only not\nsubject to any during the whole of that period, but accustomed during\nmore than half of it to rule over subjects of its own.\n\nThe assembly ratified the proposed constitution, without a single\nopposing voice, and was then dissolved; after which the Four Hundred\nwere brought into the council chamber in the following way. On account\nof the enemy at Decelea, all the Athenians were constantly on the wall\nor in the ranks at the various military posts. On that day the persons\nnot in the secret were allowed to go home as usual, while orders were\ngiven to the accomplices of the conspirators to hang about, without\nmaking any demonstration, at some little distance from the posts, and in\ncase of any opposition to what was being done, to seize the arms and\nput it down. There were also some Andrians and Tenians, three hundred\nCarystians, and some of the settlers in Aegina come with their own arms\nfor this very purpose, who had received similar instructions. These\ndispositions completed, the Four Hundred went, each with a dagger\nconcealed about his person, accompanied by one hundred and twenty\nHellenic youths, whom they employed wherever violence was needed, and\nappeared before the Councillors of the Bean in the council chamber, and\ntold them to take their pay and be gone; themselves bringing it for the\nwhole of the residue of their term of office, and giving it to them as\nthey went out.\n\nUpon the Council withdrawing in this way without venturing any\nobjection, and the rest of the citizens making no movement, the Four\nHundred entered the council chamber, and for the present contented\nthemselves with drawing lots for their Prytanes, and making their\nprayers and sacrifices to the gods upon entering office, but afterwards\ndeparted widely from the democratic system of government, and except\nthat on account of Alcibiades they did not recall the exiles, ruled the\ncity by force; putting to death some men, though not many, whom they\nthought it convenient to remove, and imprisoning and banishing others.\nThey also sent to Agis, the Lacedaemonian king, at Decelea, to say\nthat they desired to make peace, and that he might reasonably be more\ndisposed to treat now that he had them to deal with instead of the\ninconstant commons.\n\nAgis, however, did not believe in the tranquillity of the city, or that\nthe commons would thus in a moment give up their ancient liberty,\nbut thought that the sight of a large Lacedaemonian force would be\nsufficient to excite them if they were not already in commotion, of\nwhich he was by no means certain. He accordingly gave to the envoys of\nthe Four Hundred an answer which held out no hopes of an accommodation,\nand sending for large reinforcements from Peloponnese, not long\nafterwards, with these and his garrison from Decelea, descended to the\nvery walls of Athens; hoping either that civil disturbances might help\nto subdue them to his terms, or that, in the confusion to be expected\nwithin and without the city, they might even surrender without a blow\nbeing struck; at all events he thought he would succeed in seizing the\nLong Walls, bared of their defenders. However, the Athenians saw him\ncome close up, without making the least disturbance within the city; and\nsending out their cavalry, and a number of their heavy infantry, light\ntroops, and archers, shot down some of his soldiers who approached too\nnear, and got possession of some arms and dead. Upon this Agis, at last\nconvinced, led his army back again and, remaining with his own troops in\nthe old position at Decelea, sent the reinforcement back home, after a\nfew days' stay in Attica. After this the Four Hundred persevering sent\nanother embassy to Agis, and now meeting with a better reception, at his\nsuggestion dispatched envoys to Lacedaemon to negotiate a treaty, being\ndesirous of making peace.\n\nThey also sent ten men to Samos to reassure the army, and to explain\nthat the oligarchy was not established for the hurt of the city or the\ncitizens, but for the salvation of the country at large; and that there\nwere five thousand, not four hundred only, concerned; although, what\nwith their expeditions and employments abroad, the Athenians had never\nyet assembled to discuss a question important enough to bring five\nthousand of them together. The emissaries were also told what to say\nupon all other points, and were so sent off immediately after the\nestablishment of the new government, which feared, as it turned out\njustly, that the mass of seamen would not be willing to remain under the\noligarchical constitution, and, the evil beginning there, might be the\nmeans of their overthrow.\n\nIndeed at Samos the question of the oligarchy had already entered upon a\nnew phase, the following events having taken place just at the time that\nthe Four Hundred were conspiring. That part of the Samian population\nwhich has been mentioned as rising against the upper class, and as\nbeing the democratic party, had now turned round, and yielding to the\nsolicitations of Pisander during his visit, and of the Athenians in\nthe conspiracy at Samos, had bound themselves by oaths to the number\nof three hundred, and were about to fall upon the rest of their fellow\ncitizens, whom they now in their turn regarded as the democratic party.\nMeanwhile they put to death one Hyperbolus, an Athenian, a pestilent\nfellow that had been ostracized, not from fear of his influence or\nposition, but because he was a rascal and a disgrace to the city; being\naided in this by Charminus, one of the generals, and by some of the\nAthenians with them, to whom they had sworn friendship, and with whom\nthey perpetrated other acts of the kind, and now determined to attack\nthe people. The latter got wind of what was coming, and told two of the\ngenerals, Leon and Diomedon, who, on account of the credit which they\nenjoyed with the commons, were unwilling supporters of the oligarchy;\nand also Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus, the former a captain of a galley,\nthe latter serving with the heavy infantry, besides certain others who\nhad ever been thought most opposed to the conspirators, entreating them\nnot to look on and see them destroyed, and Samos, the sole remaining\nstay of their empire, lost to the Athenians. Upon hearing this, the\npersons whom they addressed now went round the soldiers one by one, and\nurged them to resist, especially the crew of the Paralus, which was made\nup entirely of Athenians and freemen, and had from time out of mind been\nenemies of oligarchy, even when there was no such thing existing; and\nLeon and Diomedon left behind some ships for their protection in case\nof their sailing away anywhere themselves. Accordingly, when the Three\nHundred attacked the people, all these came to the rescue, and foremost\nof all the crew of the Paralus; and the Samian commons gained the\nvictory, and putting to death some thirty of the Three Hundred, and\nbanishing three others of the ringleaders, accorded an amnesty to the\nrest, and lived together under a democratic government for the future.\n\nThe ship Paralus, with Chaereas, son of Archestratus, on board, an\nAthenian who had taken an active part in the revolution, was now without\nloss of time sent off by the Samians and the army to Athens to report\nwhat had occurred; the fact that the Four Hundred were in power\nnot being yet known. When they sailed into harbour the Four Hundred\nimmediately arrested two or three of the Parali and, taking the vessel\nfrom the rest, shifted them into a troopship and set them to keep guard\nround Euboea. Chaereas, however, managed to secrete himself as soon as\nhe saw how things stood, and returning to Samos, drew a picture to the\nsoldiers of the horrors enacting at Athens, in which everything was\nexaggerated; saying that all were punished with stripes, that no one\ncould say a word against the holders of power, that the soldiers' wives\nand children were outraged, and that it was intended to seize and\nshut up the relatives of all in the army at Samos who were not of\nthe government's way of thinking, to be put to death in case of their\ndisobedience; besides a host of other injurious inventions.\n\nOn hearing this the first thought of the army was to fall upon the chief\nauthors of the oligarchy and upon all the rest concerned. Eventually,\nhowever, they desisted from this idea upon the men of moderate views\nopposing it and warning them against ruining their cause, with the enemy\nclose at hand and ready for battle. After this, Thrasybulus, son of\nLycus, and Thrasyllus, the chief leaders in the revolution, now wishing\nin the most public manner to change the government at Samos to a\ndemocracy, bound all the soldiers by the most tremendous oaths, and\nthose of the oligarchical party more than any, to accept a democratic\ngovernment, to be united, to prosecute actively the war with the\nPeloponnesians, and to be enemies of the Four Hundred, and to hold no\ncommunication with them. The same oath was also taken by all the Samians\nof full age; and the soldiers associated the Samians in all their\naffairs and in the fruits of their dangers, having the conviction that\nthere was no way of escape for themselves or for them, but that the\nsuccess of the Four Hundred or of the enemy at Miletus must be their\nruin.\n\nThe struggle now was between the army trying to force a democracy upon\nthe city, and the Four Hundred an oligarchy upon the camp. Meanwhile the\nsoldiers forthwith held an assembly, in which they deposed the former\ngenerals and any of the captains whom they suspected, and chose\nnew captains and generals to replace them, besides Thrasybulus and\nThrasyllus, whom they had already. They also stood up and encouraged one\nanother, and among other things urged that they ought not to lose heart\nbecause the city had revolted from them, as the party seceding was\nsmaller and in every way poorer in resources than themselves. They had\nthe whole fleet with which to compel the other cities in their empire to\ngive them money just as if they had their base in the capital, having a\ncity in Samos which, so far from wanting strength, had when at war been\nwithin an ace of depriving the Athenians of the command of the sea,\nwhile as far as the enemy was concerned they had the same base of\noperations as before. Indeed, with the fleet in their hands, they were\nbetter able to provide themselves with supplies than the government\nat home. It was their advanced position at Samos which had throughout\nenabled the home authorities to command the entrance into Piraeus; and\nif they refused to give them back the constitution, they would now find\nthat the army was more in a position to exclude them from the sea than\nthey were to exclude the army. Besides, the city was of little or no use\ntowards enabling them to overcome the enemy; and they had lost nothing\nin losing those who had no longer either money to send them (the\nsoldiers having to find this for themselves), or good counsel, which\nentitles cities to direct armies. On the contrary, even in this the\nhome government had done wrong in abolishing the institutions of their\nancestors, while the army maintained the said institutions, and would\ntry to force the home government to do so likewise. So that even in\npoint of good counsel the camp had as good counsellors as the city.\nMoreover, they had but to grant him security for his person and his\nrecall, and Alcibiades would be only too glad to procure them the\nalliance of the King. And above all if they failed altogether, with the\nnavy which they possessed, they had numbers of places to retire to in\nwhich they would find cities and lands.\n\nDebating together and comforting themselves after this manner, they\npushed on their war measures as actively as ever; and the ten envoys\nsent to Samos by the Four Hundred, learning how matters stood while they\nwere still at Delos, stayed quiet there.  About this time a cry arose a\n Peloponnesian fleet at Miletus that Astyochus and Tissaphernes\nwere ruining their cause. Astyochus had not been willing to fight at\nsea--either before, while they were still in full vigour and the\nfleet of the Athenians small, or now, when the enemy was, as they were\ninformed, in a state of sedition and his ships not yet united--but kept\nthem waiting for the Phoenician fleet from Tissaphernes, which had only\na nominal existence, at the risk of wasting away in inactivity. While\nTissaphernes not only did not bring up the fleet in question, but was\nruining their navy by payments made irregularly, and even then not made\nin full. They must therefore, they insisted, delay no longer, but fight\na decisive naval engagement. The Syracusans were the most urgent of any.\n\nThe confederates and Astyochus, aware of these murmurs, had already\ndecided in council to fight a decisive battle; and when the news reached\nthem of the disturbance at Samos, they put to sea with all their ships,\none hundred and ten in number, and, ordering the Milesians to move by\nland upon Mycale, set sail thither. The Athenians with the eighty-two\nships from Samos were at the moment lying at Glauce in Mycale, a\npoint where Samos approaches near to the continent; and, seeing the\nPeloponnesian fleet sailing against them, retired into Samos, not\nthinking themselves numerically strong enough to stake their all upon a\nbattle. Besides, they had notice from Miletus of the wish of the enemy\nto engage, and were expecting to be joined from the Hellespont by\nStrombichides, to whom a messenger had been already dispatched, with\nthe ships that had gone from Chios to Abydos. The Athenians accordingly\nwithdrew to Samos, and the Peloponnesians put in at Mycale, and\nencamped with the land forces of the Milesians and the people of the\nneighbourhood. The next day they were about to sail against Samos, when\ntidings reached them of the arrival of Strombichides with the squadron\nfrom the Hellespont, upon which they immediately sailed back to Miletus.\nThe Athenians, thus reinforced, now in their turn sailed against Miletus\nwith a hundred and eight ships, wishing to fight a decisive battle, but,\nas no one put out to meet them, sailed back to Samos.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n_Twenty-first Year of the War--Recall of Alcibiades to Samos--Revolt of\nEuboea and Downfall of the Four Hundred--Battle of Cynossema_\n\nIn the same summer, immediately after this, the Peloponnesians\nhaving refused to fight with their fleet united, through not thinking\nthemselves a match for the enemy, and being at a loss where to look for\nmoney for such a number of ships, especially as Tissaphernes proved so\nbad a paymaster, sent off Clearchus, son of Ramphias, with forty ships\nto Pharnabazus, agreeably to the original instructions from Peloponnese;\nPharnabazus inviting them and being prepared to furnish pay, and\nByzantium besides sending offers to revolt to them. These Peloponnesian\nships accordingly put out into the open sea, in order to escape the\nobservation of the Athenians, and being overtaken by a storm, the\nmajority with Clearchus got into Delos, and afterwards returned to\nMiletus, whence Clearchus proceeded by land to the Hellespont to take\nthe command: ten, however, of their number, under the Megarian Helixus,\nmade good their passage to the Hellespont, and effected the revolt of\nByzantium. After this, the commanders at Samos were informed of it, and\nsent a squadron against them to guard the Hellespont; and an encounter\ntook place before Byzantium between eight vessels on either side.\n\nMeanwhile the chiefs at Samos, and especially Thrasybulus, who from the\nmoment that he had changed the government had remained firmly resolved\nto recall Alcibiades, at last in an assembly brought over the mass of\nthe soldiery, and upon their voting for his recall and amnesty, sailed\nover to Tissaphernes and brought Alcibiades to Samos, being convinced\nthat their only chance of salvation lay in his bringing over\nTissaphernes from the Peloponnesians to themselves. An assembly was\nthen held in which Alcibiades complained of and deplored his private\nmisfortune in having been banished, and speaking at great length\nupon public affairs, highly incited their hopes for the future, and\nextravagantly magnified his own influence with Tissaphernes. His object\nin this was to make the oligarchical government at Athens afraid of him,\nto hasten the dissolution of the clubs, to increase his credit with the\narmy at Samos and heighten their own confidence, and lastly to prejudice\nthe enemy as strongly as possible against Tissaphernes, and blast the\nhopes which they entertained. Alcibiades accordingly held out to the\narmy such extravagant promises as the following: that Tissaphernes had\nsolemnly assured him that if he could only trust the Athenians they\nshould never want for supplies while he had anything left, no, not even\nif he should have to coin his own silver couch, and that he would bring\nthe Phoenician fleet now at Aspendus to the Athenians instead of to the\nPeloponnesians; but that he could only trust the Athenians if Alcibiades\nwere recalled to be his security for them.\n\nUpon hearing this and much more besides, the Athenians at once elected\nhim general together with the former ones, and put all their affairs\ninto his hands. There was now not a man in the army who would have\nexchanged his present hopes of safety and vengeance upon the Four\nHundred for any consideration whatever; and after what they had been\ntold they were now inclined to disdain the enemy before them, and to\nsail at once for Piraeus. To the plan of sailing for Piraeus, leaving\ntheir more immediate enemies behind them, Alcibiades opposed the most\npositive refusal, in spite of the numbers that insisted upon it,\nsaying that now that he had been elected general he would first sail\nto Tissaphernes and concert with him measures for carrying on the\nwar. Accordingly, upon leaving this assembly, he immediately took\nhis departure in order to have it thought that there was an entire\nconfidence between them, and also wishing to increase his consideration\nwith Tissaphernes, and to show that he had now been elected general and\nwas in a position to do him good or evil as he chose; thus managing\nto frighten the Athenians with Tissaphernes and Tissaphernes with the\nAthenians.\n\nMeanwhile the Peloponnesians at Miletus heard of the recall of\nAlcibiades and, already distrustful of Tissaphernes, now became far more\ndisgusted with him than ever. Indeed after their refusal to go out\nand give battle to the Athenians when they appeared before Miletus,\nTissaphernes had grown slacker than ever in his payments; and even\nbefore this, on account of Alcibiades, his unpopularity had been on\nthe increase. Gathering together, just as before, the soldiers and some\npersons of consideration besides the soldiery began to reckon up how\nthey had never yet received their pay in full; that what they did\nreceive was small in quantity, and even that paid irregularly, and that\nunless they fought a decisive battle or removed to some station where\nthey could get supplies, the ships' crews would desert; and that it\nwas all the fault of Astyochus, who humoured Tissaphernes for his own\nprivate advantage.\n\nThe army was engaged in these reflections, when the following\ndisturbance took place about the person of Astyochus. Most of the\nSyracusan and Thurian sailors were freemen, and these the freest crews\nin the armament were likewise the boldest in setting upon Astyochus and\ndemanding their pay. The latter answered somewhat stiffly and threatened\nthem, and when Dorieus spoke up for his own sailors even went so far\nas to lift his baton against him; upon seeing which the mass of men, in\nsailor fashion, rushed in a fury to strike Astyochus. He, however, saw\nthem in time and fled for refuge to an altar; and they were thus parted\nwithout his being struck. Meanwhile the fort built by Tissaphernes in\nMiletus was surprised and taken by the Milesians, and the garrison in\nit turned out--an act which met with the approval of the rest of the\nallies, and in particular of the Syracusans, but which found no favour\nwith Lichas, who said moreover that the Milesians and the rest in the\nKing's country ought to show a reasonable submission to Tissaphernes and\nto pay him court, until the war should be happily settled. The Milesians\nwere angry with him for this and for other things of the kind, and upon\nhis afterwards dying of sickness, would not allow him to be buried where\nthe Lacedaemonians with the army desired.\n\nThe discontent of the army with Astyochus and Tissaphernes had reached\nthis pitch, when Mindarus arrived from Lacedaemon to succeed Astyochus\nas admiral, and assumed the command. Astyochus now set sail for home;\nand Tissaphernes sent with him one of his confidants, Gaulites, a\nCarian, who spoke the two languages, to complain of the Milesians for\nthe affair of the fort, and at the same time to defend himself against\nthe Milesians, who were, as he was aware, on their way to Sparta chiefly\nto denounce his conduct, and had with them Hermocrates, who was to\naccuse Tissaphernes of joining with Alcibiades to ruin the Peloponnesian\ncause and of playing a double game. Indeed Hermocrates had always\nbeen at enmity with him about the pay not being restored in full;\nand eventually when he was banished from Syracuse, and new\ncommanders--Potamis, Myscon, and Demarchus--had come out to Miletus to\nthe ships of the Syracusans, Tissaphernes, pressed harder than ever upon\nhim in his exile, and among other charges against him accused him of\nhaving once asked him for money, and then given himself out as his enemy\nbecause he failed to obtain it.\n\nWhile Astyochus and the Milesians and Hermocrates made sail for\nLacedaemon, Alcibiades had now crossed back from Tissaphernes to Samos.\nAfter his return the envoys of the Four Hundred sent, as has been\nmentioned above, to pacify and explain matters to the forces at Samos,\narrived from Delos; and an assembly was held in which they attempted to\nspeak. The soldiers at first would not hear them, and cried out to\nput to death the subverters of the democracy, but at last, after some\ndifficulty, calmed down and gave them a hearing. Upon this the envoys\nproceeded to inform them that the recent change had been made to save\nthe city, and not to ruin it or to deliver it over to the enemy, for\nthey had already had an opportunity of doing this when he invaded the\ncountry during their government; that all the Five Thousand would have\ntheir proper share in the government; and that their hearers' relatives\nhad neither outrage, as Chaereas had slanderously reported, nor other\nill treatment to complain of, but were all in undisturbed enjoyment of\ntheir property just as they had left them. Besides these they made a\nnumber of other statements which had no better success with their angry\nauditors; and amid a host of different opinions the one which found most\nfavour was that of sailing to Piraeus. Now it was that Alcibiades for\nthe first time did the state a service, and one of the most signal kind.\nFor when the Athenians at Samos were bent upon sailing against their\ncountrymen, in which case Ionia and the Hellespont would most certainly\nat once have passed into possession of the enemy, Alcibiades it was who\nprevented them. At that moment, when no other man would have been able\nto hold back the multitude, he put a stop to the intended expedition,\nand rebuked and turned aside the resentment felt, on personal grounds,\nagainst the envoys; he dismissed them with an answer from himself,\nto the effect that he did not object to the government of the Five\nThousand, but insisted that the Four Hundred should be deposed and the\nCouncil of Five Hundred reinstated in power: meanwhile any retrenchments\nfor economy, by which pay might be better found for the armament, met\nwith his entire approval. Generally, he bade them hold out and show a\nbold face to the enemy, since if the city were saved there was good hope\nthat the two parties might some day be reconciled, whereas if either\nwere once destroyed, that at Samos, or that at Athens, there would no\nlonger be any one to be reconciled to. Meanwhile arrived envoys from the\nArgives, with offers of support to the Athenian commons at Samos: these\nwere thanked by Alcibiades, and dismissed with a request to come when\ncalled upon. The Argives were accompanied by the crew of the Paralus,\nwhom we left placed in a troopship by the Four Hundred with orders to\ncruise round Euboea, and who being employed to carry to Lacedaemon some\nAthenian envoys sent by the Four Hundred--Laespodias, Aristophon,\nand Melesias--as they sailed by Argos laid hands upon the envoys, and\ndelivering them over to the Argives as the chief subverters of the\ndemocracy, themselves, instead of returning to Athens, took the Argive\nenvoys on board, and came to Samos in the galley which had been confided\nto them.\n\nThe same summer at the time that the return of Alcibiades coupled\nwith the general conduct of Tissaphernes had carried to its height the\ndiscontent of the Peloponnesians, who no longer entertained any doubt of\nhis having joined the Athenians, Tissaphernes wishing, it would seem,\nto clear himself to them of these charges, prepared to go after the\nPhoenician fleet to Aspendus, and invited Lichas to go with him; saying\nthat he would appoint Tamos as his lieutenant to provide pay for the\narmament during his own absence. Accounts differ, and it is not easy to\nascertain with what intention he went to Aspendus, and did not bring the\nfleet after all. That one hundred and forty-seven Phoenician ships came\nas far as Aspendus is certain; but why they did not come on has been\nvariously accounted for. Some think that he went away in pursuance\nof his plan of wasting the Peloponnesian resources, since at any\nrate Tamos, his lieutenant, far from being any better, proved a worse\npaymaster than himself: others that he brought the Phoenicians to\nAspendus to exact money from them for their discharge, having never\nintended to employ them: others again that it was in view of the outcry\nagainst him at Lacedaemon, in order that it might be said that he was\nnot in fault, but that the ships were really manned and that he had\ncertainly gone to fetch them. To myself it seems only too evident that\nhe did not bring up the fleet because he wished to wear out and paralyse\nthe Hellenic forces, that is, to waste their strength by the time lost\nduring his journey to Aspendus, and to keep them evenly balanced by not\nthrowing his weight into either scale. Had he wished to finish the war,\nhe could have done so, assuming of course that he made his appearance in\na way which left no room for doubt; as by bringing up the fleet he would\nin all probability have given the victory to the Lacedaemonians, whose\nnavy, even as it was, faced the Athenian more as an equal than as an\ninferior. But what convicts him most clearly, is the excuse which he put\nforward for not bringing the ships. He said that the number assembled\nwas less than the King had ordered; but surely it would only have\nenhanced his credit if he spent little of the King's money and effected\nthe same end at less cost. In any case, whatever was his intention,\nTissaphernes went to Aspendus and saw the Phoenicians; and the\nPeloponnesians at his desire sent a Lacedaemonian called Philip with two\ngalleys to fetch the fleet.\n\nAlcibiades finding that Tissaphernes had gone to Aspendus, himself\nsailed thither with thirteen ships, promising to do a great and\ncertain service to the Athenians at Samos, as he would either bring the\nPhoenician fleet to the Athenians, or at all events prevent its\njoining the Peloponnesians. In all probability he had long known that\nTissaphernes never meant to bring the fleet at all, and wished to\ncompromise him as much as possible in the eyes of the Peloponnesians\nthrough his apparent friendship for himself and the Athenians, and thus\nin a manner to oblige him to join their side.\n\nWhile Alcibiades weighed anchor and sailed eastward straight for\nPhaselis and Caunus, the envoys sent by the Four Hundred to Samos\narrived at Athens. Upon their delivering the message from Alcibiades,\ntelling them to hold out and to show a firm front to the enemy, and\nsaying that he had great hopes of reconciling them with the army and\nof overcoming the Peloponnesians, the majority of the members of the\noligarchy, who were already discontented and only too much inclined to\nbe quit of the business in any safe way that they could, were at once\ngreatly strengthened in their resolve. These now banded together and\nstrongly criticized the administration, their leaders being some of\nthe principal generals and men in office under the oligarchy, such as\nTheramenes, son of Hagnon, Aristocrates, son of Scellias, and others;\nwho, although among the most prominent members of the government (being\nafraid, as they said, of the army at Samos, and most especially of\nAlcibiades, and also lest the envoys whom they had sent to Lacedaemon\nmight do the state some harm without the authority of the people),\nwithout insisting on objections to the excessive concentration of power\nin a few hands, yet urged that the Five Thousand must be shown to exist\nnot merely in name but in reality, and the constitution placed upon\na fairer basis. But this was merely their political cry; most of them\nbeing driven by private ambition into the line of conduct so surely\nfatal to oligarchies that arise out of democracies. For all at once\npretend to be not only equals but each the chief and master of his\nfellows; while under a democracy a disappointed candidate accepts his\ndefeat more easily, because he has not the humiliation of being beaten\nby his equals. But what most clearly encouraged the malcontents was the\npower of Alcibiades at Samos, and their own disbelief in the stability\nof the oligarchy; and it was now a race between them as to which should\nfirst become the leader of the commons.\n\nMeanwhile the leaders and members of the Four Hundred most opposed to a\ndemocratic form of government--Phrynichus who had had the quarrel with\nAlcibiades during his command at Samos, Aristarchus the bitter and\ninveterate enemy of the commons, and Pisander and Antiphon and others\nof the chiefs who already as soon as they entered upon power, and again\nwhen the army at Samos seceded from them and declared for a democracy,\nhad sent envoys from their own body to Lacedaemon and made every effort\nfor peace, and had built the wall in Eetionia--now redoubled their\nexertions when their envoys returned from Samos, and they saw not only\nthe people but their own most trusted associates turning against them.\nAlarmed at the state of things at Athens as at Samos, they now sent off\nin haste Antiphon and Phrynichus and ten others with injunctions to make\npeace with Lacedaemon upon any terms, no matter what, that should be at\nall tolerable. Meanwhile they pushed on more actively than ever with the\nwall in Eetionia. Now the meaning of this wall, according to Theramenes\nand his supporters, was not so much to keep out the army of Samos, in\ncase of its trying to force its way into Piraeus, as to be able to let\nin, at pleasure, the fleet and army of the enemy. For Eetionia is a mole\nof Piraeus, close alongside of the entrance of the harbour, and was now\nfortified in connection with the wall already existing on the land side,\nso that a few men placed in it might be able to command the entrance;\nthe old wall on the land side and the new one now being built within on\nthe side of the sea, both ending in one of the two towers standing at\nthe narrow mouth of the harbour. They also walled off the largest porch\nin Piraeus which was in immediate connection with this wall, and kept\nit in their own hands, compelling all to unload there the corn that came\ninto the harbour, and what they had in stock, and to take it out from\nthence when they sold it.\n\nThese measures had long provoked the murmurs of Theramenes, and when\nthe envoys returned from Lacedaemon without having effected any general\npacification, he affirmed that this wall was like to prove the ruin of\nthe state. At this moment forty-two ships from Peloponnese, including\nsome Siceliot and Italiot vessels from Locri and Tarentum, had been\ninvited over by the Euboeans and were already riding off Las in Laconia\npreparing for the voyage to Euboea, under the command of Agesandridas,\nson of Agesander, a Spartan. Theramenes now affirmed that this squadron\nwas destined not so much to aid Euboea as the party fortifying Eetionia,\nand that unless precautions were speedily taken the city would be\nsurprised and lost. This was no mere calumny, there being really some\nsuch plan entertained by the accused. Their first wish was to have the\noligarchy without giving up the empire; failing this to keep their ships\nand walls and be independent; while, if this also were denied them,\nsooner than be the first victims of the restored democracy, they were\nresolved to call in the enemy and make peace, give up their walls and\nships, and at all costs retain possession of the government, if their\nlives were only assured to them.\n\nFor this reason they pushed forward the construction of their work with\nposterns and entrances and means of introducing the enemy, being eager\nto have it finished in time. Meanwhile the murmurs against them were at\nfirst confined to a few persons and went on in secret, until Phrynichus,\nafter his return from the embassy to Lacedaemon, was laid wait for and\nstabbed in full market by one of the Peripoli, falling down dead before\nhe had gone far from the council chamber. The assassin escaped; but\nhis accomplice, an Argive, was taken and put to the torture by the Four\nHundred, without their being able to extract from him the name of his\nemployer, or anything further than that he knew of many men who used\nto assemble at the house of the commander of the Peripoli and at\nother houses. Here the matter was allowed to drop. This so emboldened\nTheramenes and Aristocrates and the rest of their partisans in the Four\nHundred and out of doors, that they now resolved to act. For by this\ntime the ships had sailed round from Las, and anchoring at Epidaurus had\noverrun Aegina; and Theramenes asserted that, being bound for Euboea,\nthey would never have sailed in to Aegina and come back to anchor at\nEpidaurus, unless they had been invited to come to aid in the designs\nof which he had always accused the government. Further inaction\nhad therefore now become impossible. In the end, after a great many\nseditious harangues and suspicions, they set to work in real earnest.\nThe heavy infantry in Piraeus building the wall in Eetionia, among\nwhom was Aristocrates, a colonel, with his own tribe, laid hands upon\nAlexicles, a general under the oligarchy and the devoted adherent of the\ncabal, and took him into a house and confined him there. In this they\nwere assisted by one Hermon, commander of the Peripoli in Munychia,\nand others, and above all had with them the great bulk of the heavy\ninfantry. As soon as the news reached the Four Hundred, who happened to\nbe sitting in the council chamber, all except the disaffected wished at\nonce to go to the posts where the arms were, and menaced Theramenes\nand his party. Theramenes defended himself, and said that he was ready\nimmediately to go and help to rescue Alexicles; and taking with him one\nof the generals belonging to his party, went down to Piraeus, followed\nby Aristarchus and some young men of the cavalry. All was now panic and\nconfusion. Those in the city imagined that Piraeus was already taken and\nthe prisoner put to death, while those in Piraeus expected every moment\nto be attacked by the party in the city. The older men, however, stopped\nthe persons running up and down the town and making for the stands of\narms; and Thucydides the Pharsalian, proxenus of the city, came forward\nand threw himself in the way of the rival factions, and appealed to them\nnot to ruin the state, while the enemy was still at hand waiting for his\nopportunity, and so at length succeeded in quieting them and in keeping\ntheir hands off each other. Meanwhile Theramenes came down to Piraeus,\nbeing himself one of the generals, and raged and stormed against the\nheavy infantry, while Aristarchus and the adversaries of the people were\nangry in right earnest. Most of the heavy infantry, however, went on\nwith the business without faltering, and asked Theramenes if he thought\nthe wall had been constructed for any good purpose, and whether it would\nnot be better that it should be pulled down. To this he answered that if\nthey thought it best to pull it down, he for his part agreed with them.\nUpon this the heavy infantry and a number of the people in Piraeus\nimmediately got up on the fortification and began to demolish it. Now\ntheir cry to the multitude was that all should join in the work who\nwished the Five Thousand to govern instead of the Four Hundred. For\ninstead of saying in so many words \"all who wished the commons to\ngovern,\" they still disguised themselves under the name of the Five\nThousand; being afraid that these might really exist, and that they\nmight be speaking to one of their number and get into trouble through\nignorance. Indeed this was why the Four Hundred neither wished the Five\nThousand to exist, nor to have it known that they did not exist; being\nof opinion that to give themselves so many partners in empire would be\ndownright democracy, while the mystery in question would make the people\nafraid of one another.\n\nThe next day the Four Hundred, although alarmed, nevertheless assembled\nin the council chamber, while the heavy infantry in Piraeus,\nafter having released their prisoner Alexicles and pulled down the\nfortification, went with their arms to the theatre of Dionysus, close to\nMunychia, and there held an assembly in which they decided to march into\nthe city, and setting forth accordingly halted in the Anaceum. Here they\nwere joined by some delegates from the Four Hundred, who reasoned\nwith them one by one, and persuaded those whom they saw to be the most\nmoderate to remain quiet themselves, and to keep in the rest; saying\nthat they would make known the Five Thousand, and have the Four Hundred\nchosen from them in rotation, as should be decided by the Five Thousand,\nand meanwhile entreated them not to ruin the state or drive it into the\narms of the enemy. After a great many had spoken and had been spoken to,\nthe whole body of heavy infantry became calmer than before, absorbed\nby their fears for the country at large, and now agreed to hold upon an\nappointed day an assembly in the theatre of Dionysus for the restoration\nof concord.\n\nWhen the day came for the assembly in the theatre, and they were upon\nthe point of assembling, news arrived that the forty-two ships under\nAgesandridas were sailing from Megara along the coast of Salamis. The\npeople to a man now thought that it was just what Theramenes and\nhis party had so often said, that the ships were sailing to the\nfortification, and concluded that they had done well to demolish it.\nBut though it may possibly have been by appointment that Agesandridas\nhovered about Epidaurus and the neighbourhood, he would also naturally\nbe kept there by the hope of an opportunity arising out of the\ntroubles in the town. In any case the Athenians, on receipt of the news\nimmediately ran down in mass to Piraeus, seeing themselves threatened\nby the enemy with a worse war than their war among themselves, not at\na distance, but close to the harbour of Athens. Some went on board the\nships already afloat, while others launched fresh vessels, or ran to\ndefend the walls and the mouth of the harbour.\n\nMeanwhile the Peloponnesian vessels sailed by, and rounding Sunium\nanchored between Thoricus and Prasiae, and afterwards arrived at Oropus.\nThe Athenians, with revolution in the city, and unwilling to lose a\nmoment in going to the relief of their most important possession (for\nEuboea was everything to them now that they were shut out from Attica),\nwere compelled to put to sea in haste and with untrained crews, and sent\nThymochares with some vessels to Eretria. These upon their arrival, with\nthe ships already in Euboea, made up a total of thirty-six vessels, and\nwere immediately forced to engage. For Agesandridas, after his crews had\ndined, put out from Oropus, which is about seven miles from Eretria by\nsea; and the Athenians, seeing him sailing up, immediately began to man\ntheir vessels. The sailors, however, instead of being by their ships, as\nthey supposed, were gone away to purchase provisions for their dinner\nin the houses in the outskirts of the town; the Eretrians having so\narranged that there should be nothing on sale in the marketplace, in\norder that the Athenians might be a long time in manning their ships,\nand, the enemy's attack taking them by surprise, might be compelled to\nput to sea just as they were. A signal also was raised in Eretria to\ngive them notice in Oropus when to put to sea. The Athenians, forced\nto put out so poorly prepared, engaged off the harbour of Eretria, and\nafter holding their own for some little while notwithstanding, were at\nlength put to flight and chased to the shore. Such of their number as\ntook refuge in Eretria, which they presumed to be friendly to them,\nfound their fate in that city, being butchered by the inhabitants; while\nthose who fled to the Athenian fort in the Eretrian territory, and the\nvessels which got to Chalcis, were saved. The Peloponnesians, after\ntaking twenty-two Athenian ships, and killing or making prisoners of the\ncrews, set up a trophy, and not long afterwards effected the revolt\nof the whole of Euboea (except Oreus, which was held by the Athenians\nthemselves), and made a general settlement of the affairs of the island.\n\nWhen the news of what had happened in Euboea reached Athens, a panic\nensued such as they had never before known. Neither the disaster in\nSicily, great as it seemed at the time, nor any other had ever so much\nalarmed them. The camp at Samos was in revolt; they had no more ships or\nmen to man them; they were at discord among themselves and might at any\nmoment come to blows; and a disaster of this magnitude coming on the top\nof all, by which they lost their fleet, and worst of all Euboea, which\nwas of more value to them than Attica, could not occur without throwing\nthem into the deepest despondency. Meanwhile their greatest and most\nimmediate trouble was the possibility that the enemy, emboldened by his\nvictory, might make straight for them and sail against Piraeus, which\nthey had no longer ships to defend; and every moment they expected him\nto arrive. This, with a little more courage, he might easily have done,\nin which case he would either have increased the dissensions of the city\nby his presence, or, if he had stayed to besiege it, have compelled the\nfleet from Ionia, although the enemy of the oligarchy, to come to the\nrescue of their country and of their relatives, and in the meantime\nwould have become master of the Hellespont, Ionia, the islands, and of\neverything as far as Euboea, or, to speak roundly, of the whole Athenian\nempire. But here, as on so many other occasions, the Lacedaemonians\nproved the most convenient people in the world for the Athenians to\nbe at war with. The wide difference between the two characters, the\nslowness and want of energy of the Lacedaemonians as contrasted with the\ndash and enterprise of their opponents, proved of the greatest service,\nespecially to a maritime empire like Athens. Indeed this was shown by\nthe Syracusans, who were most like the Athenians in character, and also\nmost successful in combating them.\n\nNevertheless, upon receipt of the news, the Athenians manned twenty\nships and called immediately a first assembly in the Pnyx, where they\nhad been used to meet formerly, and deposed the Four Hundred and voted\nto hand over the government to the Five Thousand, of which body all who\nfurnished a suit of armour were to be members, decreeing also that no\none should receive pay for the discharge of any office, or if he did\nshould be held accursed. Many other assemblies were held afterwards,\nin which law-makers were elected and all other measures taken to form a\nconstitution. It was during the first period of this constitution that\nthe Athenians appear to have enjoyed the best government that they ever\ndid, at least in my time. For the fusion of the high and the low was\neffected with judgment, and this was what first enabled the state to\nraise up her head after her manifold disasters. They also voted for the\nrecall of Alcibiades and of other exiles, and sent to him and to the\ncamp at Samos, and urged them to devote themselves vigorously to the\nwar.\n\nUpon this revolution taking place, the party of Pisander and Alexicles\nand the chiefs of the oligarchs immediately withdrew to Decelea, with\nthe single exception of Aristarchus, one of the generals, who hastily\ntook some of the most barbarian of the archers and marched to Oenoe.\nThis was a fort of the Athenians upon the Boeotian border, at that\nmoment besieged by the Corinthians, irritated by the loss of a party\nreturning from Decelea, who had been cut off by the garrison. The\nCorinthians had volunteered for this service, and had called upon the\nBoeotians to assist them. After communicating with them, Aristarchus\ndeceived the garrison in Oenoe by telling them that their countrymen\nin the city had compounded with the Lacedaemonians, and that one of the\nterms of the capitulation was that they must surrender the place to the\nBoeotians. The garrison believed him as he was general, and besides knew\nnothing of what had occurred owing to the siege, and so evacuated the\nfort under truce. In this way the Boeotians gained possession of Oenoe,\nand the oligarchy and the troubles at Athens ended.\n\nTo return to the Peloponnesians in Miletus. No pay was forthcoming from\nany of the agents deputed by Tissaphernes for that purpose upon his\ndeparture for Aspendus; neither the Phoenician fleet nor Tissaphernes\nshowed any signs of appearing, and Philip, who had been sent with him,\nand another Spartan, Hippocrates, who was at Phaselis, wrote word to\nMindarus, the admiral, that the ships were not coming at all, and that\nthey were being grossly abused by Tissaphernes. Meanwhile Pharnabazus\nwas inviting them to come, and making every effort to get the fleet and,\nlike Tissaphernes, to cause the revolt of the cities in his government\nstill subject to Athens, founding great hopes on his success; until at\nlength, at about the period of the summer which we have now reached,\nMindarus yielded to his importunities, and, with great order and at a\nmoment's notice, in order to elude the enemy at Samos, weighed anchor\nwith seventy-three ships from Miletus and set sail for the Hellespont.\nThither sixteen vessels had already preceded him in the same summer, and\nhad overrun part of the Chersonese. Being caught in a storm, Mindarus\nwas compelled to run in to Icarus and, after being detained five or six\ndays there by stress of weather, arrived at Chios.\n\nMeanwhile Thrasyllus had heard of his having put out from Miletus,\nand immediately set sail with fifty-five ships from Samos, in haste to\narrive before him in the Hellespont. But learning that he was at Chios,\nand expecting that he would stay there, he posted scouts in Lesbos\nand on the continent opposite to prevent the fleet moving without his\nknowing it, and himself coasted along to Methymna, and gave orders to\nprepare meal and other necessaries, in order to attack them from\nLesbos in the event of their remaining for any length of time at Chios.\nMeanwhile he resolved to sail against Eresus, a town in Lesbos which\nhad revolted, and, if he could, to take it. For some of the principal\nMethymnian exiles had carried over about fifty heavy infantry, their\nsworn associates, from Cuma, and hiring others from the continent, so as\nto make up three hundred in all, chose Anaxander, a Theban, to command\nthem, on account of the community of blood existing between the Thebans\nand the Lesbians, and first attacked Methymna. Balked in this attempt by\nthe advance of the Athenian guards from Mitylene, and repulsed a second\ntime in a battle outside the city, they then crossed the mountain and\neffected the revolt of Eresus. Thrasyllus accordingly determined to go\nthere with all his ships and to attack the place. Meanwhile Thrasybulus\nhad preceded him thither with five ships from Samos, as soon as he heard\nthat the exiles had crossed over, and coming too late to save Eresus,\nwent on and anchored before the town. Here they were joined also by two\nvessels on their way home from the Hellespont, and by the ships of the\nMethymnians, making a grand total of sixty-seven vessels; and the forces\non board now made ready with engines and every other means available to\ndo their utmost to storm Eresus.\n\nIn the meantime Mindarus and the Peloponnesian fleet at Chios, after\ntaking provisions for two days and receiving three Chian pieces of money\nfor each man from the Chians, on the third day put out in haste from the\nisland; in order to avoid falling in with the ships at Eresus, they did\nnot make for the open sea, but keeping Lesbos on their left, sailed for\nthe continent. After touching at the port of Carteria, in the Phocaeid,\nand dining, they went on along the Cumaean coast and supped at\nArginusae, on the continent over against Mitylene. From thence they\ncontinued their voyage along the coast, although it was late in the\nnight, and arriving at Harmatus on the continent opposite Methymna,\ndined there; and swiftly passing Lectum, Larisa, Hamaxitus, and the\nneighbouring towns, arrived a little before midnight at Rhoeteum. Here\nthey were now in the Hellespont. Some of the ships also put in at Sigeum\nand at other places in the neighbourhood.\n\nMeanwhile the warnings of the fire signals and the sudden increase in\nthe number of fires on the enemy's shore informed the eighteen Athenian\nships at Sestos of the approach of the Peloponnesian fleet. That very\nnight they set sail in haste just as they were, and, hugging the shore\nof the Chersonese, coasted along to Elaeus, in order to sail out into\nthe open sea away from the fleet of the enemy.\n\nAfter passing unobserved the sixteen ships at Abydos, which had\nnevertheless been warned by their approaching friends to be on the\nalert to prevent their sailing out, at dawn they sighted the fleet of\nMindarus, which immediately gave chase. All had not time to get away;\nthe greater number however escaped to Imbros and Lemnos, while four\nof the hindmost were overtaken off Elaeus. One of these was stranded\nopposite to the temple of Protesilaus and taken with its crew, two\nothers without their crews; the fourth was abandoned on the shore of\nImbros and burned by the enemy.\n\nAfter this the Peloponnesians were joined by the squadron from Abydos,\nwhich made up their fleet to a grand total of eighty-six vessels; they\nspent the day in unsuccessfully besieging Elaeus, and then sailed back\nto Abydos. Meanwhile the Athenians, deceived by their scouts, and never\ndreaming of the enemy's fleet getting by undetected, were tranquilly\nbesieging Eresus. As soon as they heard the news they instantly\nabandoned Eresus, and made with all speed for the Hellespont, and after\ntaking two of the Peloponnesian ships which had been carried out too\nfar into the open sea in the ardour of the pursuit and now fell in their\nway, the next day dropped anchor at Elaeus, and, bringing back the\nships that had taken refuge at Imbros, during five days prepared for the\ncoming engagement.\n\nAfter this they engaged in the following way. The Athenians formed in\ncolumn and sailed close alongshore to Sestos; upon perceiving which the\nPeloponnesians put out from Abydos to meet them. Realizing that a battle\nwas now imminent, both combatants extended their flank; the Athenians\nalong the Chersonese from Idacus to Arrhiani with seventy-six ships;\nthe Peloponnesians from Abydos to Dardanus with eighty-six. The\nPeloponnesian right wing was occupied by the Syracusans, their left by\nMindarus in person with the best sailers in the navy; the Athenian left\nby Thrasyllus, their right by Thrasybulus, the other commanders being\nin different parts of the fleet. The Peloponnesians hastened to engage\nfirst, and outflanking with their left the Athenian right sought to cut\nthem off, if possible, from sailing out of the straits, and to drive\ntheir centre upon the shore, which was not far off. The Athenians\nperceiving their intention extended their own wing and outsailed them,\nwhile their left had by this time passed the point of Cynossema. This,\nhowever, obliged them to thin and weaken their centre, especially\nas they had fewer ships than the enemy, and as the coast round Point\nCynossema formed a sharp angle which prevented their seeing what was\ngoing on on the other side of it.\n\nThe Peloponnesians now attacked their centre and drove ashore the ships\nof the Athenians, and disembarked to follow up their victory. No help\ncould be given to the centre either by the squadron of Thrasybulus on\nthe right, on account of the number of ships attacking him, or by that\nof Thrasyllus on the left, from whom the point of Cynossema hid what\nwas going on, and who was also hindered by his Syracusan and other\nopponents, whose numbers were fully equal to his own. At length,\nhowever, the Peloponnesians in the confidence of victory began to\nscatter in pursuit of the ships of the enemy, and allowed a considerable\npart of their fleet to get into disorder. On seeing this the squadron\nof Thrasybulus discontinued their lateral movement and, facing about,\nattacked and routed the ships opposed to them, and next fell roughly\nupon the scattered vessels of the victorious Peloponnesian division, and\nput most of them to flight without a blow. The Syracusans also had by\nthis time given way before the squadron of Thrasyllus, and now openly\ntook to flight upon seeing the flight of their comrades.\n\nThe rout was now complete. Most of the Peloponnesians fled for refuge\nfirst to the river Midius, and afterwards to Abydos. Only a few\nships were taken by the Athenians; as owing to the narrowness of the\nHellespont the enemy had not far to go to be in safety. Nevertheless\nnothing could have been more opportune for them than this victory. Up to\nthis time they had feared the Peloponnesian fleet, owing to a number\nof petty losses and to the disaster in Sicily; but they now ceased\nto mistrust themselves or any longer to think their enemies good for\nanything at sea. Meanwhile they took from the enemy eight Chian\nvessels, five Corinthian, two Ambraciot, two Boeotian, one Leucadian,\nLacedaemonian, Syracusan, and Pellenian, losing fifteen of their own.\nAfter setting up a trophy upon Point Cynossema, securing the wrecks, and\nrestoring to the enemy his dead under truce, they sent off a galley to\nAthens with the news of their victory. The arrival of this vessel with\nits unhoped-for good news, after the recent disasters of Euboea, and\nin the revolution at Athens, gave fresh courage to the Athenians, and\ncaused them to believe that if they put their shoulders to the wheel\ntheir cause might yet prevail.\n\nOn the fourth day after the sea-fight the Athenians in Sestos having\nhastily refitted their ships sailed against Cyzicus, which had revolted.\nOff Harpagium and Priapus they sighted at anchor the eight vessels from\nByzantium, and, sailing up and routing the troops on shore, took the\nships, and then went on and recovered the town of Cyzicus, which was\nunfortified, and levied money from the citizens. In the meantime the\nPeloponnesians sailed from Abydos to Elaeus, and recovered such of their\ncaptured galleys as were still uninjured, the rest having been burned by\nthe Elaeusians, and sent Hippocrates and Epicles to Euboea to fetch the\nsquadron from that island.\n\nAbout the same time Alcibiades returned with his thirteen ships from\nCaunus and Phaselis to Samos, bringing word that he had prevented\nthe Phoenician fleet from joining the Peloponnesians, and had made\nTissaphernes more friendly to the Athenians than before. Alcibiades\nnow manned nine more ships, and levied large sums of money from the\nHalicarnassians, and fortified Cos. After doing this and placing a\ngovernor in Cos, he sailed back to Samos, autumn being now at hand.\nMeanwhile Tissaphernes, upon hearing that the Peloponnesian fleet had\nsailed from Miletus to the Hellespont, set off again back from Aspendus,\nand made all sail for Ionia. While the Peloponnesians were in the\nHellespont, the Antandrians, a people of Aeolic extraction, conveyed by\nland across Mount Ida some heavy infantry from Abydos, and introduced\nthem into the town; having been ill-treated by Arsaces, the Persian\nlieutenant of Tissaphernes. This same Arsaces had, upon pretence of\na secret quarrel, invited the chief men of the Delians to undertake\nmilitary service (these were Delians who had settled at Atramyttium\nafter having been driven from their homes by the Athenians for the sake\nof purifying Delos); and after drawing them out from their town as his\nfriends and allies, had laid wait for them at dinner, and surrounded\nthem and caused them to be shot down by his soldiers. This deed made the\nAntandrians fear that he might some day do them some mischief; and as\nhe also laid upon them burdens too heavy for them to bear, they expelled\nhis garrison from their citadel.\n\nTissaphernes, upon hearing of this act of the Peloponnesians in addition\nto what had occurred at Miletus and Cnidus, where his garrisons had been\nalso expelled, now saw that the breach between them was serious; and\nfearing further injury from them, and being also vexed to think that\nPharnabazus should receive them, and in less time and at less cost\nperhaps succeed better against Athens than he had done, determined to\nrejoin them in the Hellespont, in order to complain of the events at\nAntandros and excuse himself as best he could in the matter of the\nPhoenician fleet and of the other charges against him. Accordingly he\nwent first to Ephesus and offered sacrifice to Artemis....\n\n[When the winter after this summer is over the twenty-first year of this\nwar will be completed. ]\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The History of the Peloponnesian War, by Thucydides\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PELOPONNESIAN WAR ***\n\n***** This file should be named 7142.txt or 7142.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/7\/1\/4\/7142\/\n\nProduced by Albert Imrie\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.

To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1267,"split":"test"}
