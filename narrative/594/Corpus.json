Moments later, he is in a padded room with a straight jacket on, throwing his body against the padded walls.\nThe film cuts to November 1999, when a group of young tourists\u2014Stephen and his pregnant wife, Tristen, who are researching the Blair Witch for a book they are writing; Erica, a Wiccan; and Kim, a goth psychic\u2014arrive in Burkittsville, Maryland, after seeing The Blair Witch Project. Jeff, a local man, is their tour guide and a paranormal investigator who says his equipment will capture any supernatural events that happen while they visit the Blair Witch site.\nThey camp for the night in the ruins of Rustin Parr's house, and Jeff places cameras around to capture anything supernatural. As the group gets drunk around a campfire, another tour group arrives and claims to have jurisdiction over the ruins. Jeff and his group convince the others that they saw something horrifying at Coffin Rock earlier, and the other group leaves to investigate. Jeff and his group wake the next morning with no memory of the previous night. Tristen and Stephen's research documents are shredded and strewn about, and Jeff's cameras are destroyed. However, Jeff's tapes are found unharmed in the same spot the Blair Witch Project footage was discovered. Tristen notices that she is bleeding and has miscarried.\nThe group goes to the Burkittsville hospital, where Tristen's miscarriage is confirmed. As she is about to be discharged, Tristen sees a ghostly young girl walking away backwards. Jeff takes the group back to his home, an abandoned broom factory against a steep hill in the woods. It has an elaborate security system, surveillance cameras, and a front door alarm. That evening, the group reviews Jeff's tapes and find hours of footage to be missing. Only one scene remains, which depicts a naked Erica holding onto a tree and swinging around it backward. Erica remembers no such event and runs off to pray, weeping as she does so. Each of the members of the group now begins to have hallucinations of horrible things (like eating a dead owl, murdering someone, or being locked in an asylum). Kim borrows Jeff's van to drive in to town to pick up food and alcohol, and has a heated argument with the convenience store cashier. The van she drives is attacked by locals as she leaves, and she crashes the vehicle into a telephone pole after swerving to avoid ghostly children walking along the road. Back at Jeff's, she reaches into her shopping bag and pricks herself on a small, bloody nail file stuck among the bottles of beer she purchased.\nThe three tourists decide to leave the next morning, but Erica mysteriously disappears and no one heard the front door \"barking dog\" alarm sound to indicate she'd left. Kim discovers Erica's clothes, surrounded by a circle of lit candles. They attempt to call Erica's father at his office, but are told by his secretary that he has no children. Jeff discovers his van is wrecked, but Kim says she had only dented the fender. The county sheriff calls to say that the other tour group was found disemboweled on Coffin Rock. He demands that Jeff reveal what he knows about the crime, but Jeff denies any involvement and hangs up. Kim decides to call for help, but while looking for a telephone directory discovers dossiers on each of the tourists in Jeff's desk. Tristen (whose mental health is rapidly deteriorating) suddenly claims she can see Erica through a window, naked and swinging around a tree. Stephen runs outside to confront Erica, but the walkway connecting the building to the hill collapses under him when he does so. As he climbs to safety, Stephen sees the same girl Tristen did in the hospital. The sheriff calls again and says he is at Jeff's front door. The security monitor shows the bridge is now intact. Jeff hears the sheriff shouting at the door, goes downstairs, grabs a shotgun from a closet, and opens the door\u2014but the bridge has returned to its damaged state and the sheriff is nowhere. Stephen, Kim, and Tristen arrive as Jeff opens the closet to put the gun away, and all three discover Erica's corpse in the closet.\nTristen, in a hallucinatory state, chants about \"reversing the evil,\" leading Kim to suggest they play Jeff's damaged tapes in reverse. The footage now shows Tristen leading the group in satanic worship and a drunken orgy, followed by a subsequent ritual murder of the other tour group. Jeff begins taping Tristen as Stephen demands that she confess to killing Erica. Tristen alternately sneers at the others and asks them for help, luring them to the second floor. Stephen accuses Tristen of deliberately killing their baby. Tristen ties a rope around her own neck, threatening to kill herself. Stephen pushes her over the second-floor banister in a moment of rage, and causes her to hang herself.\nAfter a jump cut, the audience sees that Jeff, Stephen, and Kim have been arrested. Each is interrogated separately, with the police showing each person footage of their crimes. Security camera footage shows Kim stabbing the cashier in the neck with the cashier's nail file. Surveillance camera footage shows a naked Jeff killing Erica, arranging her clothes, and putting her dead body in the closet. Jeff's video shows Stephen assaulting Tristen, accusing her of being a witch and pushing her over the banister (but not Tristen putting the rope around her own neck). All three, close to a nervous breakdown, protest they never did any of those things.\n<html>\n\n<head>\n<title>\"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2,\" early draft, by Dick Beebe<\/title>\n<\/head>\n\n<body>\n<pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         <u>BLAIR WITCH II<\/u>\n\n\n                               By\n\n                           Dick Beebe\n\n\n                        Original Story By\n\n                    Joe Berlinger & Dick Beebe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        <u>FIRST DRAFT (Revised)<\/u>\n\n                                        January 10, 2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     BLACK SCREEN\n\n     And in that darkness, white words silently FADE UP:\n\n               <b>The following is based on actual events.

The camera travels with his gaze: atop\n     nearly every other grave marker is a black candle melted into the\n     stone.\n\n                              KID #1\n                    What do you think all these candles\n                    are for?\n\n                              KID #2\n                    I wouldn't touch 'em.\n\n     CUT BACK TO:\n\n     Sheriff Cravens on Video.\n\n                              SHERIFF\n                    Nothing much we can do--just enforce\n                    the curfew.

Then turns and walks away, rubbing his\n     eyes with a thumb and forefinger like a headache the size of\n     Manitoba just hit him.\n\n                              SHERIFF\n                    You'll excuse me--\n\n     CUT TO:\n\n     An office in L.A.

Impatient, trying to put\n     pieces that don't fit together.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    Where?\n\n                              COTTER\n                    Down there in the Park.\n\n     Heather looks up. Cotter is looking down through the big room's\n     huge windows; he's waving to someone.\n\n     Heather gets up. Slowly peers over the loft railing. Squints.\n\n     HEATHER'S POV\n\n     A stark-naked Domini is standing in Druid Hill Park. Looking up at\n     them.\n\n     EXT. DRUID HILL PARK - JUST AFTER - NIGHT\n\n     Heather and Cotter's pace slows drastically as they try and\n     navigate the overgrown pathways inside the Park. The flora is dense\n     below and above--moonlight barely penetrates where they're walking.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    Domini...?\n\n     Cotter puts a finger to her lip. Whispers:\n\n                              COTTER\n                    Not the place you want to\n                    announce your arrival.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    How's she going to know where\n                    to--\n\n                              COTTER\n                    --things got a way of finding\n                    <u>you<\/u> here.\n\n     They walk.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    It's <u>freezing<\/u>.\n\n                              COTTER\n                    Next time try putting on shoes--\n\n     --the two of them stop dead in their tracks. Through the thicket\n     ahead of them they can see a clearing. Illuminated by the moon is\n     what appears to be an old\n\n     WOODEN OX CART\n\n     with SNOW drifted up nearly to the hubs of its wheels.\n\n     HEATHER AND COTTER\n\n     are suddenly so cold they can see their breath in the air.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    What the fuck--??\n\n                              COTTER\n                    --I don't know.\n\n     He grabs her hand and pulls her through the thicket. They enter\n\n     THE CLEARING\n\n     the snow is now gone. Where the cart was is now just a stack of\n     rotting cut brush. A clean-up effort someone must have started,\n     then abandoned. Heather and Cotter stare at each other, baffled--\n     and not a little afraid.\n\n                              COTTER\n                    The moon trying to shoot down\n                    through all these trees--can make\n                    things funky--\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    --I saw what I saw.\n\n                              COTTER\n                    Yeah.

She's clenching a sharp stick in it.\n     The Little Boys are gone. The body of the Dead Man is not.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    I didn't.\n\n     She grabs his hand, pulls him up. They start running.\n\n     INT. COTTER'S KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n     Heather and Cotter at the table, still out of breath and shaking,\n     as they tell Nick what happened.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    --and one of the little boys,\n                    his name was James.

They all look:\n\n     ANNA\n\n     is standing there, laughing with her hand against her mouth like a\n     little child. She sing-songs:\n\n                              ANNA\n                    I could see up your dress.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT\n\n     Cotter, Heather and Nick watch the monitors on the table in\n     silence. Drinking coffee. They all look majorly exhausted--but none\n     of them look in any immediate danger of falling asleep. Their eyes\n     dart from monitor to monitor, relievedly seeing nothing--except\n     Anna tossing restlessly in bed.\n\n     Heather sees that Nick is massaging something on his forearm that's\n     making him wince. Without a word, she rolls his sleeve up:\n\n     A wine-colored mark that looks vaguely like a jagged J.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    Gothic rune--the letter \"S.\"\n\n                              NICK\n                    Or a blood blister--or a bruise.\n\n                              COTTER\n                    Must be that blue collar life we\n                    all lead.\n\n     Cotter pulls up his pant leg: two blurry burgundy marks--crescent\n     shapes overlapping each other.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    That's a \"j.\"\n\n                              COTTER\n                    For \"James?\"\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    Goes right along with these two.\n\n     She pulls back her hair--where jaw meets neck: two smudgey marks\n     that together look like badly-drawn lowercase \"n\"s.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    Put 'em together that's a \"k.\"\n                    James Kurth--\n\n                              NICK\n                    --or Lyme Disease or poison sumac,\n                    or God knows what-else we could have\n                    picked up in the woods.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    You <u>know<\/u> what we picked up in the\n                    woods--\n\n     --and then there's a sharp knock at the door.\n\n     All three sets of eyes zoom towards the sound, but no one moves.\n\n     The knocking grows louder, more insistent. Still, they remain\n     frozen. Frightened.\n\n     They look at the monitor giving an angle of the door\/elevator.\n\n     Nothing can be seen--just a dark blur in the door's peephole\n     indicating someone's standing in the elevator.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    Who?\n\n                              COTTER\n                    No one ever comes here.\n\n                              NICK\n                    Have to open the door to find\n                    out.\n\n     The knocking increases, along with muffled shouts of:\n\n                              VOICE BEHIND THE DOOR\n                    Cotter...?

The rapping and\n     shouting increasing in volume with each step.\n\n     Finally, a deep breath. And then Cotter looks through the peep\n     hole. He sees:\n\n     SID\n\n     his Techie friend from the Film Lab glowering back at him.\n\n                              SID\n                    I know you're in there, you\n                    piece of shit!\n\n                              COTTER\n                         (quietly)\n                    You have to go.\n\n                              SID\n                    Not until I get that Beta Cam\n                    back!

Sits down in front of the\n     monitors. Watches as the knocking continues. Finally stops. The\n     expression on Cotter's face never changes.\n\n     TIME CUT TO - THE SAME - SEVERAL HOURS LATER\n\n     So quiet, so tense, they can hear the clocks ticking all over the\n     loft: 4:10a.m.\n\n                              NICK\n                    I should check on Anna.\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    Check the monitor, she's <u>fine<\/u>.\n\n                              NICK\n                    She's far from \"fine.\"\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    You're needed here--keep watching--\n\n                              COTTER\n                    --f'chrissake, Heather, it's not\n                    like the two of us are gonna doze\n                    off he leaves for two seconds--\n\n                              HEATHER\n                    --I don't trust anybody, not even\n                    me, anymore--\n\n                              COTTER\n                    --shhhh! #5, there's something up\n                    there!\n\n     Their eyes all go to the Monitor with the view of Cotter's work\n     loft.
