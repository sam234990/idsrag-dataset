On a hunting expedition, one moonlit night, Ren\u00e9 asks Chactas, the old man who adopted him, to relate the story of his life.\nAt the age of seventeen, the Natchez Chactas loses his father during a battle against the Muscogees. He flees to St Augustine, Florida, where he is raised in the household of the Spaniard Lopez. After 2\u00bd years, he sets out for home, but is captured by the Muscogees and Seminoles. The chief Simagan sentences him to be burnt in their village.\nThe women take pity on him during the weeks of travel, and each night bring him gifts. Atala, the half-caste Christian daughter of Simagan, tries in vain to help him escape. On arrival at Apalachucla, his bonds are loosed and he is saved from death by her intervention. They run away and roam the wilderness for 27 days before being caught in a huge storm. While they are sheltering, Atala tells Chactas that her father was Lopez, and he realises that she is the daughter of his erstwhile benefactor.\nLightning strikes a tree close by, and they run at random before hearing a church bell. Encountering a dog, they are met by its owner, P\u00e8re Aubry, and he leads them through the storm to his idyllic mission. Aubry's kindness and force of personality impress Chactas greatly.\nAtala falls in love with Chactas, but cannot marry him as she has taken a vow of chastity. In despair she takes poison. Aubry assumes that she is merely ill, but in the presence of Chactas she reveals what she has done, and Chactas is filled with anger until the missionary tells them that in fact Christianity permits the renunciation of vows. They tend her, but she dies, and the day after the funeral, Chactas takes Aubry's advice and leaves the mission.\nIn an epilogue it is revealed that Aubry was later killed by Cherokees, and that, according to Chactas's granddaughter, neither Ren\u00e9 nor the aged Chactas survived a massacre during an uprising. The full account of Chactas's wanderings after Atala's death, in Les Natchez, gives a somewhat different version of their fates.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Atala, by Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Auguste de Chateaubriand\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

But his fame rests not merely upon\nhis literary achievements. His services as a statesman and the record\nand example of his private life-even his sufferings and misfortunes-have\nserved to enhance his reputation and endear his memory, both among\nhis own countrymen, and among just, noble and patriotic minds in other\nlands. He was great both by his character and abilities; and, while his\ncelebrity is undiminished by the lapse of time, his works are still read\nand will long continue to be read and admired, even through all\nchanges in the manners and sentiments of mankind. Fashions and modes in\nliterature and art, as in society, come and go; new institutions\narise, demanding new methods and modifying cherished customs; and men's\nthoughts enlarge and widen with improved conditions, as with the\ninevitable progress of the age. But the master mind ever asserts its\npower. He who has once truly stirred the human heart in its purest\ndepths speaks not alone to his own generation, but appeals to all other\nhearts and belongs to all his race. His good gifts are the birthright\nof the world. The rank of Chateaubriand has been fixed by the united\njudgment of his associates and his successors; and since time has\nallayed the fierce passions which raged in France during his lifetime,\nhis character is more and more deeply respected and admired. His\nsincerity of purpose and enlightened understanding, his grandeur and\nnobility of thought, his energy of action and loftiness of aim, preserve\nfor him ever his exalted position, made brilliant by the fires of genius\nand perpetuated by the force of truth.\n\nChateaubriand was born at St. Malo in September, 1768, and died in\nParis, after an active and most eventful career, on the fourth of July,\n1848. The earlier portion of his life was passed in the quiet of his\nhome at Combourg. At the termination of his collegiate training at Dole\nand Rennes, he entered the army, in which he soon gained promotion. At\nabout the age of nineteen he was presented at court, became acquainted\nwith the fashionable world, and was received and welcomed into the\nchoicest literary circles of Paris, where he gained the friendship of La\nHarpe, Fontanes, Malesherbes, and others among the distinguished savants\nof that period. It was a troubled and stormy epoch in France. The social\nand political forces which culminated in the great Revolution were\nbeginning to be seriously felt, and faction, turbulence and anarchy\nwere already rife in Paris when Chateaubriand left his native shores for\nAmerica, moved by a desire to discover the northwest passage, but also\nwith an attendant purpose, long cherished, of observing the mode of life\nand studying the characteristics of the aborigines, for the purpose\nof embodying in his writings the impressions thus gained of man in a\nprimitive condition.\n\nFrom this period to the time of his death his life was a singular series\nof vicissitudes--at one time the brilliant and revered statesman, at\nanother the voluntary abdicator of all his rights and honors; and even,\nat one bitter passage of his existence, living in an unwarmed London\ngarret and obtaining a precarious livelihood by giving lessons in his\nnative tongue and translating for the booksellers.\n\nThe utter upheaval of affairs in France brought the greatest distress\nupon himself, his family and his immediate friends, and, with the\nsensitive heart of genius, the blows which had fallen so keenly\ndoubtless engendered the melancholy cast with which his writings are\nsometimes tinged. His first work, an idyllic poem, showed little of\nthe genius so finely developed in after years; but his finest literary\nproductions--\"The Martyrs,\" \"The Last of the Abencerages\" and\n\"The Genius of Christianity,\" to which \"Atala\" and \"Ren\u00c3\u00a9\" properly\nbelong--remain a splendid monument to his powers and exhibit his earnest\ndesire to be numbered among the benefactors and enlighteners of mankind.\n\nThe present work, \"Atala,\" is the gathered fruit of his previous studies\namid the wilds of America. It abounds in sparkling description, romantic\nincident and sentiments tender and heroic. It is pervaded by purity of\ntone and elevation of thought, qualities the more commendable and marked\nbecause produced in an age proverbially lax and frivolous.\n\nThe illustrations of M. Dor\u00c3\u00a9 have given an additional value to this\ntale, so simple, so unsophisticated, yet blooming with all the wild\nluxuriance of nature. The artist has added his gifts to those of the\npoet; and those acquainted only with his ready and original powers as\nthe delineator of farce and drollery, or of the exceptionally tragic and\nhorrible, will find new cause for admiration in these quiet renderings\nof the primeval beauties of the American wild--its plains and forests,\nits still lagoons and roaring cataracts, its mountain slopes and deep\ndefiles--all its aspects of rudest workmanship--and will welcome these\nefforts of his genius in the lovely realm of descriptive art, wedded as\nthey are to the exquisite simplicity of this Indian romance. As in\nhis other works, here may be noted the same surpassing fertility of\nresource, the same alertness of intellect and readiness and swiftness of\ntouch; but there may also be found new proofs of his complete sympathy\nwith all that is picturesque in forest beauty and his high intuitive\nperception of every possible phase of nature in her wildest caprice and\nmost tender bloom.\n\nWe append the following extracts from different prefaces to the author's\nwritings, as constituting what is explanatory of the story that follows:\n\n\n[From the Preface to the First Edition.]\n\n\"I was still very young when I conceived the idea of composing an epic\non 'The Man of Nature,' to depict the manners of savages, by uniting\nthem with some well-known event. After the discovery of America, I saw\nno subject more interesting, especially to Frenchmen, than the massacre\nof the Natchez colony in Louisiana, in 1727. All the Indian tribes\nconspiring, after two centuries of oppression, for the restoration of\nliberty to the New World, appeared to me to offer a subject almost as\nattractive as the conquest of Mexico. I put some fragments of the work\nto paper; but I soon found that I was weak in local coloring, and\nthat, if I wished to produce a picture of real resemblance, it became\nnecessary for me, in imitation of Homer's example, to visit the tribes I\nwas desirous of describing.\n\n\"In 1789 I made M. de Malesherbes acquainted with my idea of going to\nAmerica; but, wishing at the same time to give a useful object to my\nvoyage, I formed the project of discovering the overland passage so long\nsought after, and concerning which even Captain Cook himself had left\nsome doubts. I started, visited the American solitudes, and returned\nwith plans for a second voyage, which was to last nine years. I proposed\nto traverse the entire continent of North America, afterwards to explore\nthe coasts to the north of California, and to return by Hudson's Bay,\nrounding the pole. M. de Malesherbes undertook to submit my plans to the\nGovernment, and it was then that he listened to the first fragments of\nthe little work I now offer to the public. The Revolution put a stop\nto all my projects. Covered with the blood of my only brother, of my\nsister-in-law, and of the illustrious old man, their father; having\nseen my mother and another talented sister die in consequence of the\ntreatment they had undergone in prison, I wandered forth to foreign\nlands, where the only friend I had preserved stabbed himself in my arms.\n\n\"Of all my manuscripts upon America, I have only saved some fragments,\n'Atala' in particular, which was itself but an episode of 'The Natchez.'\n'Atala' was written in the desert, beneath the huts of the savages. I do\nnot know whether the public will like the story, which quits all beaten\ntracks, and represents a nature and manners altogether foreign to\nEurope. There is no adventure in 'Atala.' It is a sort of poem, half\ndescriptive, half dramatic. It consists entirely in the portraiture of\ntwo lovers walking and talking together in the solitudes, and in the\npicture of the trials of love in the midst of the calm of the desert.\nI have endeavored to give to this work the most antique forms. It is\ndivided into Prologue, Recital and Epilogue. The principal parts of the\nstory have each a denomination, such as 'The Hunters,' 'The Laborers,'\netc.; and it was thus that, in the early ages of Greece, the rhapsodists\nsang, under different titles, fragments of the 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey.'\"\n\n\"The moralities I have been desirous of inculcating in 'Atala' are\neasily discoverable, and as they are summed up in the Epilogue, I need\nnot speak of them here. I will merely say a word or two concerning\nChactas, the lover of Atala.\n\n\"He is a savage more than half civilized, since he knows not only the\nliving, but also the dead languages of Europe. He can therefore express\nhimself in a mixed style, suitable to the line upon which he stands,\nbetween society and nature. This circumstance has given me some\nadvantages, by permitting Chactas to speak as a savage in the\ndescription of manners, and as a European in the dramatic portions of\nthe narrative. Without that the work must have been abandoned. If I had\nalways made use of the Indian style, 'Atala' would have been Hebrew for\nthe reader.\n\n\"As to the missionary, he is a simple priest, who speaks without\nblushing of the Cross, of the blood of his Divine Master, of the\ncorrupted flesh, etc.; in one word, he is really a priest. I am aware\nthat it is difficult to depict such a character without awakening ideas\nof ridicule in the minds of certain readers. Where I do not draw a tear,\nI may raise a smile; that must depend upon individual sentiment.\"\n\n\"I must say a last word as to 'Atala.' The subject is not entirely of my\ninvention. It is certain that there was a savage at the galleys and\nat the court of Louis XIV.; it is certain that a French missionary\naccomplished the facts I have related; it is certain that I saw savages\nin the American forests carrying away the bones of their forefathers,\nand a young mother exposing the body of her child upon the branches of a\ntree. Some other circumstances narrated are also veritable, but as they\nare not of general interest, it is needless for me to speak of them.\"\n\n\n[From the Preface to \"Alain\" and \"Ren\u00c3\u00a9\" published in 1805. ]\n\n\"I have been stopped in the corrections neither by the consideration of\nthe cost of the book, nor by that of the length of the work. A few years\nhave sufficed to make me acquainted with the weak or defective portions\nof that episode. Obedient upon this point to the critics, even so far\nas to reproach myself with an excess of docility, I have proved to those\nwho attacked me that I never remain voluntarily in error, and that,\nat all times and upon all subjects, I am ready to give way to lights\nsuperior to my own. 'Atala' has been reprinted eleven times--five times\nseparately and six times in the 'Genius of Christianity.' If those\neleven editions were compared, scarcely two would be found to be\naltogether alike.\n\n\"The twelfth, which I now publish, has been revised with the greatest\ncare. I have consulted the friends prompt to censure me; I have weighed\neach phrase, examined every word. The style, freed from certain epithets\nwhich embarrassed it, proceeds perhaps more naturally and with greater\nsimplicity. I have introduced more order and logic into certain ideas,\nand I have effaced even the slightest inaccuracies of language. M. de\nla Harpe observed to me, on the subject of 'Atala,' 'If you will shut\nyourself up with me only for a few hours, that time will suffice for\nwiping out the spots that cause your critics to cry out so loudly.' I\nhave passed four years in the revision of this episode; but it is now as\nI intend it to remain. It is at present the only 'Atala' I shall ever in\nfuture acknowledge.\"\n\n*****\n\n\"The new nature and the new manners I have described have also drawn\nupon me another ill-considered reproach. I have been taken for the\ninventor of certain extraordinary details, whereas I merely repeated\ncircumstances well known to all travellers. Some notes added to the\npresent edition of 'Atala' would easily have justified this assertion;\nbut if I had introduced them at every point where each reader might have\nlooked for them, they would soon have exceeded the length of the work\nitself. I therefore gave up the idea of annotations.\"\n\n[Illustration: 010]\n\n[Illustration: 011]\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nFrance formerly possessed in North America a vast empire, extending from\nLabrador to the Floridas, and from the shores of the Atlantic to the\nmost distant lakes of Upper Canada.\n\nFour great rivers, deriving their sources from the same mountains,\ndivided these immense regions: the river St. Lawrence, which is lost to\nthe east in the gulf of that name; the Western River, whose waters flow\non to seas unknown; the river Bourbon, which runs from south to north\ninto Hudson's Bay; and the Mississippi, whose waters fall from north to\nsouth into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe last-named river, in its course of more than a thousand leagues,\nwaters a delicious country, called by the inhabitants of the United\nStates the New Eden, to which the French left the pretty appellation of\nLouisiana. A thousand other rivers, tributaries of the Mississippi--the\nMissouri, the Illinois, the Arkansas, the Wabache, the Tennessee--enrich\nit with their mud and fertilize it with their waters. When all these\nrivers have been swollen by the deluges of winter, uprooted trees,\nforming large portions of forests torn down by tempests, crowd about\ntheir sources. In a short time the mud cements the torn trees together,\nand they become enchained by creepers, which, taking root in every\ndirection, bind and consolidate the d\u00c3\u00a9bris. Carried away by the foaming\nwaves, the rafts descend to the Mississippi, which, taking possession\nof them, hurries them down towards the Gulf of Mexico, throws them upon\nsandbanks, and so increases the number of its mouths. At intervals the\nswollen river raises its voice whilst passing over the resisting heaps,\nand spreads its overflowing waters around the colonnades of the forests,\nand the pyramids of the Indian tombs: and so the Mississippi is the Nile\nof these deserts. But grace is always united to splendor in the scenes\nof Nature: while the mid-stream bears away towards the sea the dead\ntrunks of pine-trees and oaks, the lateral currents on either side\nconvey along the shores floating islands of pistias and nenuphars,\nwhose yellow roses stand out like little pavilions. Green serpents, blue\nherons, pink flamingoes, and baby crocodiles embark as passengers on\nthese rafts of flowers; and the brilliant colony, unfolding to the wind\nits golden sails, glides along slumberingly till it arrives at some\nretired creek in the river.\n\nThe two shores of the Mississippi present the most extraordinary\npicture. On the western border vast savannahs spread away farther than\nthe eye can reach, and their waves of verdure, as they recede, appear\nto rise gradually into the azure sky, where they fade away. In these\nlimitless meadows herds of three or four thousand wild buffaloes wander\nat random. Sometimes, cleaving the waters as it swims, a bison, laden\nwith years, comes to repose among the high grass on an island of the\nMississippi, its forehead ornamented with two crescents, and its ancient\nand slimy beard giving it the appearance of a god of the river throwing\nan eye of satisfaction upon the grandeur of its waters, and the wild\nabundance of its shores.\n\n[Illustration: 013]\n\nSuch is the scene upon the western border; but it changes on the\nopposite side, which forms an admirable contrast with the other shore.\nSuspended along the course of the waters, grouped upon the rocks and\nupon the mountains, and dispersed in the valleys, trees of every\nform, of every color, and of every perfume, throng and grow together,\nstretching up into the air to heights that weary the eye to follow. Wild\nvines, bignonias, coloquintidas, intertwine each other at the feet of\nthese trees, escalade their trunks, and creep along to the extremity of\ntheir branches, stretching from the maple to the tulip-tree, from the\ntulip-tree to the holly-hock, and thus forming thousands of grottoes,\narches and porticoes. Often, in their wanderings from tree to tree,\nthese creepers cross the arm of a river, over which they throw a bridge\nof flowers. Out of the midst of these masses, the magnolia, raising\nits motionless cone, surmounted by large white buds, commands all the\nforest, where it has no other rival than the palm-tree, which gently\nwaves, close by, its fans of verdure.\n\nA multitude of animals, placed in these retreats by the hand of the\nCreator, spread about life and enchantment. From the extremities of the\navenues may be seen bears, intoxicated with the grape, staggering\nupon the branches of the elm-trees; cariboos bathe in the lake;\nblack-squirrels play among the thick foliage; mocking-birds, and\nVirginian pigeons not bigger than sparrows, fly down upon the turf,\nreddened with strawberries; green parrots with yellow heads, purple\nwoodpeckers, cardinals red as fire, clamber up to the very tops of the\ncypress-trees; humming-birds sparkle upon the jessamine of the Floridas;\nand bird-catching serpents hiss while suspended to the domes of the\nwoods, where they swing about like the creepers themselves.\n\nIf all is silence and repose in the savannahs on the other side of the\nriver, all here, on the contrary, is sound and motion; peckings against\nthe trunks of the oaks, frictions of animals walking along as they\nnibble or crush between their teeth the stones of fruits, the roaring of\nthe waves, plaintive cries, dull bellowings and mild cooings, fill these\ndeserts with a tender yet wild harmony. But when a breeze happens to\nanimate these solitudes, to swing these floating bodies, to confound\nthese masses of white, blue, green, and pink, to mix all the colors and\nto combine all the murmurs, there issue such sounds from the depths of\nthe forests, and such things pass before the eyes, that I should in\nvain endeavor to describe them to those who have never visited these\nprimitive fields of Nature.\n\nAfter the discovery of the Mississippi by Father Marquette and the\nunfortunate La Salle, the first Frenchmen who established themselves at\nBiloxi and at New Orleans entered into an alliance with the Natchez, an\nIndian nation whose power was redoubtable in those countries. Quarrels\nand jealousies subsequently ensanguined the land of hospitality. Amongst\nthese savages there was an old man named Chactas, * who, on account of\nhis age, wisdom and knowledge of the affairs of life, was the patriarch\nand the beloved of the deserts. Like many other men, he had acquired\nvirtue by calamity. Not only were the forests of the New World filled\nwith his misfortunes, but he bore the tale of his calamities even to the\nshores of France. Kept at the galleys at Marseilles by a cruel act of\ninjustice, restored to liberty, and presented to Louis XIV., he had\nconversed with the great men of that age, and had been present at the\nf\u00c3\u00aates of Versailles, at the tragedies of Racine, and at the funeral\norations of Bossuet: in one word, the savage had contemplated society at\nthe moment of its greatest splendor.\n\nFor several years Chactas, restored to the bosom of his country, had\nbeen in the enjoyment of repose. Nevertheless, Providence granted him\neven this favor dearly: the old man had become blind. A young girl\nused to accompany him on the hills of the Mississippi, just as Antigone\nformerly guided the steps of Odipus over the Cith\u00c3\u00a6ron, or as Malvina\nconducted Ossian over the rocks of Morven.\n\nIn spite of the numerous acts of injustice to which Chactas had been\nsubjected by the French, he was very partial to them. He ever remembered\nF\u00c3\u00a9n\u00c3\u00a9lon, whose guest he had been, and desired an opportunity for\nrendering service to the fellow-countrymen of that virtuous man. A\nfavorable occasion presented itself. In 1725 a Frenchman named\nRen\u00c3\u00a9, driven thither by his passions and his misfortunes, arrived at\nLouisiana. He ascended the Mississippi as far as the territory of the\nNatchez, and asked to be accepted as a warrior of that nation.\nChactas, having questioned him, and finding him not to be shaken in\nhis resolution, adopted him as a son, and united him to an Indian girl\ncalled C\u00c3\u00a9luta. Shortly after this marriage the savages prepared to go\nbeaver-hunting.\n\nOn account of the respect with which the Indian tribes regarded the old\nman, Chactas, although blind, was appointed by the council of the wise\nmen to command the expedition. Prayers and fasts commenced, the jugglers\ninterpreted the dreams, the manitous were consulted, sacrifices\nof tobacco were offered up, fillets of elk-tongues were burnt, the\nassistants examining whether they sputtered in the flames, in order\nto ascertain the will of the genii; and at length they started, after\nhaving partaken of the sacred dog. Ren\u00c3\u00a9 was of the party.\n\n    * The harmonious voice.\n\nWith the assistance of the counter-currents, the pirogues reascended the\nMississippi, and reached the bed of the Ohio. One moonlight night, while\nall the Natchez were asleep at the bottom of their pirogues, and the\nIndian fleet, under a crowd of beast-skin sails, was flying before a\nmild breeze, Ren\u00c3\u00a9, who had remained alone with Chactas, asked him to\ntell the story of his adventures. The old man consented to satisfy his\ncuriosity, and began in these words:--\n\n[Illustration: 016]\n\n[Illustration: 017]\n\n[Illustration: 019]\n\n\n\n\nI. THE HUNTERS.\n\n\"The destiny which has brought us together, my dear son, is a singular\none. I see in you the civilized man become savage: you see in me the\nwild man whom the Great Spirit (I know not from what motive) desired\nto civilize. Having each entered upon the career of life from opposite\ndirections, you came to repose yourself at my place, and I have seated\nmyself in yours; so that we must have acquired a totally different view\nof things. Which of the twain has gained or lost the more by this change\nof position? That is known to the genii, the least learned of whom\npossesses more wisdom than all mankind together.\n\n\"At the next flower-moon * there will be seven times ten snows, and\nthree snows more, since my mother brought me into the world on the banks\nof the Mississippi. The Spaniards had recently established themselves\nin the Bay of Pensacola, but no European yet inhabited Louisiana. I had\nscarcely witnessed seventeen falls of the leaves when I marched with\nmy father, the warrior Outalissi, against the Muscogulges, a powerful\nnation in the Floridas. We united our forces with those of the\nSpaniards, our allies, and the combat took place upon one of the\nbranches of the Mobile. Areskoui * and the manitous were not favorable\nto us. Our enemies triumphed: my father lost his life; I was twice\nwounded whilst defending him. O why did I not then go down into the land\nof souls! I should have avoided the misfortunes which were awaiting me\non earth. The Spirits ordained otherwise. I was dragged along by the\ndefeated crowd to Saint Augustine.\n\n     * The month of Way.\n\n\"In that city, but then recently built by the Spaniards, I ran the risk\nof being carried away to the mines of Mexico, when an old Castilian,\nnamed Lopez, touched by my youth and simplicity, offered me an asylum,\nand presented me to his sister, with whom he was living spouseless.\n\n\"Both of them took to me in the tenderest manner. I was brought up with\nmuch care, and had all sorts of masters given to me. But after having\npassed thirty moons at Saint Augustine, I was afflicted with a disgust\nfor the life of cities. I fell away visibly: sometimes I remained\nmotionless for hours whilst contemplating the summits of distant\nforests; at other times I might be seen seated on the banks of a river,\ngazing sadly upon the flowing waters. I figured to myself the woods\nthrough which those waters had passed, and my soul was thus entirely\ngiven up to solitude.\n\n\"No longer able to resist the desire of returning to the desert, I one\nmorning presented myself to Lopez dressed in my savage attire, holding\nin one hand my bow and arrows, and in the other my European costume,\nwhich I returned to my generous protector, at whose feet I fell,\nshedding a torrent of tears, giving myself odious names, and accusing\nmyself of ingratitude. 'After all, O my father,' said I to him, 'you see\nit yourself; I must die if I do not resume the life of the Indian.'\n\n\"Lopez, struck with astonishment, endeavored to change my determination.\nHe spoke of the dangers I was about to encounter, by exposing myself\nto the possibility of falling into the hands of the Muscogulges. But\nperceiving at last that I was resolved to risk everything, he melted\ninto tears, and, pressing me in his arms with affection, 'Go,' said he,\n'child of Nature; take back this independence of man, of which Lopez\ndoes not wish to deprive you. If I were myself younger, I would\naccompany you to the desert (where I also have sweet remembrances), and\nrestore you to your mother's arms. When you shall be once again in your\nforests, think sometimes of the old Spaniard who gave you hospitality,\nand remember, in order that you may be disposed to love your\nfellow-creatures, that your first experience of the human heart was\naltogether in its favor.' Lopez finished by a prayer to the God of the\nChristians, whose religion I had refused to embrace, and we separated\nwith much sadness.\n\n     * The god of war.\n\n\"It was not long before I was punished for my ingratitude. My\ninexperience caused me to lose myself in the wood, and I was taken by\na party of Muscogulges and Seminoles, as Lopez had predicted. My dress,\nand the feathers ornamenting my head, caused me to be recognized\nas a Natchez.\n\n[Illustration: 021]\n\n[Illustration: 023]\n\nI was enchained, but slightly, on account of my youth. Simaghan, the\nleader of the troop, desired to learn my name. I replied, 'I am called\nChactas, son of Outalissi, son of Miscou, who have taken more than a\nhundred scalps from the heroes of the Muscogulges.' Simaghan then said,\n'Chactas, son of Outalissi, son of Miscou, rejoice; thou shalt be burnt\nat the big village.' I answered, 'That is well,' and began to chaunt the\nsong of death.\n\n\"Although a prisoner, I could not refrain, during the first few days,\nfrom admiring my enemies. The Muscogulge, and especially his ally, the\nSeminole, is full of gaiety, love and contentment. His walk is light,\nhis mien calm and open. He speaks much, and with volubility. His\nlanguage is harmonious and flowing. Even age does not deprive the\nsachems of this joyous simplicity: like the old birds of our forests,\nthey mingle their ancient songs with the fresh notes of their young\nposterity.\n\n\"The women who accompanied the troop displayed for my youth a tender\npity and an amiable curiosity. They questioned me about my mother,\nconcerning the earliest days of my life; and they wanted to know whether\nmy cradle of moss had been hung upon the flowering branches of the\nmaple-trees, and whether the breezes had rocked me near the nests of the\nlittle birds. Then came a thousand other questions as to the state of\nmy heart. They asked me if I had seen a white fawn in my dreams, and\nwhether the trees of the secret valley had advised me to love. I replied\nwith simplicity to the mothers, to the daughters, and to the spouses of\nthe men, saying, 'You are the graces of the day, and the night loves you\nlike dew. Man issues from your loins to hang upon your breast and upon\nyour lips: you know the magic words that lull every pain. So was I told\nby her who brought me into the world, and who will never see me again!\nShe told me also that maidens are mysterious flowers met with in\nsolitary places.'\n\n\"These praises gave much pleasure to the women, who overwhelmed me with\nall sorts of presents, and brought me cocoa-nut cream, maple-tree sugar,\nsaganrite, * bear-hams, beaver-skins, shells with which to ornament\nmyself, and moss for my couch. They sang and laughed with me, and then\ntook to shedding tears at the thought that I was to be burnt.\n\n     * A description of cake made with Indian corn.\n\n\"One night, when the Muscogulges had pitched their camp on the outskirt\nof a forest, I was seated near the war-fire with the guard who had\ncharge of me. All of a sudden, I heard the sound of a dress upon the\ngrass, and a female, half-veiled, came and sat down by my side. Tears\nwere rolling from beneath her eyelids, and I saw by the light of\nthe fire that a small golden crucifix shone upon her bosom. She was\naltogether beautiful, and I remarked upon her countenance an expression\nof virtue and passion of irresistible attraction. To that she added\nthe most tender graces: an extreme sensitiveness, united to a profound\nmelancholy, breathed in her looks, and her smile was heavenly.\n\n\"I took her to be the Virgin of the last Loves, the virgin sent to the\nprisoner of war to enchant his tomb. Under this impression, I said to\nher stammeringly, and with an emotion that did not, however, proceed\nfrom any feeling of fear of the funeral pile, 'O virgin, you are worthy\nof a first love, and you are not made for the last. The palpitations of\na heart that will soon cease to beat would ill respond to the movements\nof your own. How can death and life lie mingled together? You would\ncause me to regret too much the approach of day. Let another be happier\nthan myself, and may long embraces unite the tender plant to the oak!'\n\n\"The youthful maiden then said to me, 'I am not the Virgin of the last\nLoves. Are you a Christian?' I replied that I had not betrayed the genii\nof my cottage. At these words the Indian made an involuntary movement,\nand said, 'I pity you for being merely a wicked idolator. My mother made\nme a Christian; my name is Atala, and I am the daughter of Simaghan of\nthe Golden Bracelets, the chief of the warriors of this troop. We are\ngoing to Apalachucla, where you will be burnt.' Having uttered these\nwords, Atala rose and took her departure.\"\n\nHere. Chactas was compelled to interrupt his story. A crowd of souvenirs\nrushed into his soul; his closed eyes inundated his furrowed cheeks with\ntears, just as two springs, hidden in the profound depths of the earth,\nreveal themselves by the waters they send filtering between the rocks.\n\n\"Oh, my son,\" said he, after a long pause, \"you perceive that Chactas is\nnot very wise, notwithstanding his reputation for wisdom. Alas! my dear\nchild, although men can no longer see, they can still weep! Several days\npassed. Every evening the old man's daughter came to converse with\nme. Sleep had fled from my eyes, and Atala was in my heart like the\nremembrance of the resting-place of my fathers.\n\n\"On the seventeenth day of our march, about the time when the ephemeran\nrises from the waters, we entered upon the grand savannah of Alachua.\nThe plain is surrounded with hills, which, receding behind one another,\nare covered, as they appear to touch the clouds, with ranges of forests\nof palm-trees, citron-trees, magnolias and oaks. The chief uttered the\ncry of arrival, and the troop encamped at the foot of a hill-side. I was\nleft at some distance, on the border of one of those natural wells so\nfamous in the Floridas, attached to the trunk of a tree, and guarded by\na warrior who watched me with impatience. I had passed but some moments\nin this place when Atala appeared beneath the liquid ambers of the\nfountain. 'Hunter,' said she to the Muscogulgan hero, 'if you would like\nto chase the stag, I will guard the prisoner.' The warrior jumped for\njoy at this offer of the chiefs daughter, and at once hurried from the\ntop of the hill, and directed his steps towards the plain.\n\n\"What a strange contradiction is the heart of man! I, who had so much\ndesired to speak of things mysterious to her whom I already loved like\nthe sun, suddenly became troubled and confused, and felt as though\nI should have preferred to be thrown amongst the crocodiles in the\nfountain to finding myself alone with Atala. The daughter of the desert\nwas as much affected as her prisoner. We observed a profound silence;\nfor the genii of love had deprived us of speech. After an interval,\nAtala, making an effort, spoke thus: 'Warrior, you are held but\nslightly: you can easily escape.' At these words courage returned to\nmy tongue, and I replied, 'But slightly held, O woman!'---- I could not\ncomplete my phrase. Atala hesitated some moments, and then said, 'Fly!'\nat the same time liberating me from the trunk of the tree. I seized the\ncord, and returned it to the hand of the foreign maiden, forcing her\nbeautiful fingers to close themselves upon my chain. 'Take it back!\nTake it back!' I cried. 'You are mad!' said Atala, in a voice full of\nemotion. 'Wretched man, do you not know that you will be burnt? What\ndo you mean? Do you reflect that I am the daughter of a redoubtable\nsachem?' 'There was a time,' I replied, with tears, 'when I also was\ncarried about in a beaver-skin on the shoulders of a mother: my father\nalso had a fine cottage, and his fawns drank of the waters of a thousand\ntorrents; but I now wander without a country. When I shall have ceased\nto exist, no friend will place a little grass over my body, to keep the\ninsects away from it. The corpse of an unhappy stranger interests no\none.'\n\n\"These words touched Atala. Her tears fell into the fountain. 'Ah,'\nI continued with vivacity, 'if your heart spoke like mine! Is not the\ndesert free? Do not the forests contain folds in which we could conceal\nourselves? And, in order to be happy, are there so many things necessary\nfor the children of the huts? O maiden, more beautiful than the first\ndream of a spouse! O my well-beloved, dare to follow me!' Such was\nmy language. Atala replied to me in a tender tone of voice, 'My young\nfriend, you have learnt the expressions of the white men; it is easy to\ndeceive an Indian girl!' 'What!' I exclaimed, 'you call me your young\nfriend. Ah, if a poor slave'---- 'Well,' said she, leaning upon me, 'a\npoor slave'----\n\nI continued with ardor, 'Let a kiss assure him of your faith!' Atala\nlistened to my prayers. As a fawn appears to cling to the flowers of\nthe rosy creepers which it seizes with its delicate tongue on the\nmountain-steeps, so I remained attached to the lips of my well-beloved.\n\n[Illustration: 027]\n\n\"Alas, my dear son, pain is in close attendance upon pleasure. Who could\nhave thought that the moment in which Atala gave me the first token\nof her love should be precisely that in which she would destroy all my\nhopes? White hairs of old Chactas, what was your astonishment when the\ndaughter of the sachem pronounced these words: 'Beautiful prisoner, I\nhave foolishly given way to your desire; but whither will this passion\nlead us? My religion separates me from you for ever----. Oh, my mother,\nwhat hast thou done?'---- Atala became suddenly silent, and kept back\nI know not what fatal secret about to escape from her lips. Her words\nplunged me into despair. 'Well, then,' I exclaimed, 'I will be as cruel\nas you; I will not escape. You shall see me in the flame of fire; you\nshall hear the groans of my flesh, and you will be full of joy.' Atala\ntook my hands between both of hers. 'Poor young idolator,' she cried,\n'I really grieve for you! You wish me, then, to weep my whole heart out?\nWhat a pity I cannot fly with you! Unhappy was the bosom of thy mother,\nO Atala! Why dost thou not throw thyself to the crocodiles in the\nfountain?'\n\n\"That very moment the crocodiles, at the approach of the setting of the\nsun, began to make their cries heard. Atala said to me, 'Let us leave\nthis place.' I led away the daughter of Simaghan to the foot of the\nhills, which form gulfs of verdure by advancing their promontories into\nthe savannahs. Everything in the desert was splendidly imposing.\nThe stork was screaming upon its nest; the woods resounded with the\nmonotonous song of the quails, the whistling of the paraquets, the\nlowing of the bisons and the neighing of the Siminolian cavalry.\n\n\"Our promenade was almost a dumb one. I walked by the side of Atala,\nwho was holding the end of the cord which I had forced her to take back\nagain. Sometimes we shed tears, and sometimes we endeavored to smile.\nA look, now directed towards the sky and then towards the earth; an ear\nlistening to the song of the birds; a gesture towards the setting sun;\na hand tenderly pressed; a bosom by turns palpitating and tranquil:\nthe names of Chactas and Atala softly repeated at intervals! Oh, first\npromenade of love, thy souvenir must be extremely powerful, since after\nso many years of misfortune it can still stir the heart of old Chactas!\n\n\"How incomprehensible are mortals when agitated by the passions! I had\njust abandoned the generous-hearted Lopez; I had just exposed myself to\nevery danger for the sake of liberty, and in one instant the look of a\nwoman had changed my tastes, my resolutions, my thoughts! Forgetful of\nmy country, my mother, my cabin, and the frightful death awaiting me,\nI had become indifferent to everything that was not Atala. Lacking\nstrength to raise myself to the reason of a man, I had suddenly fallen\ninto a sort of childishness, and, far from being able to do anything to\nextricate myself from threatening misfortunes, I almost required some\none to provide me with the means of sleep and nourishment.\n\n\"It was therefore in vain that Atala, after our ramble in the savannah,\nthrew herself at my knees and again begged me to leave her. I declared\nthat I would return alone to the camp, if she refused to re-attach me\nto the trunk of my tree. She was compelled to comply with my request,\nhoping to convince me another time.\n\n\"The next day, which decided the fate of my life, we halted in a valley\nnot far from Cuscowilla, the capital of the Seminoles. These Indians,\ntogether with the Muscogulges, form the confederation of the Creeks. The\ndaughter of the land of palm-trees came to find me in the middle of\nthe night. She conducted me to a great pine-forest, and renewed her\nentreaties to induce me to escape. Without replying to her, I took her\nhand in mine, and forced the thirsting fawn to wander with me into the\nforest. The night was delicious. The genius of the air appeared to be\nshaking the blue canopy, embalmed with the odor of the pines; and we\nbreathed a slight perfume of amber emitted by the crocodiles asleep\nbeneath the tamarind-trees by the river-side. The moon was shining in\nthe midst of a spotless azure, and the pearl-grey light fell upon the\nundefined summit of the forests. Not a sound was to be heard, except I\nknow not what distant harmony that reigned in the depth of the woods. It\nseemed as though the soul of solitude was sighing throughout the entire\nextent of the desert.\n\n\"Through the trees we perceived a young man, who, holding a torch in his\nhand, looked like the genius of spring visiting the forests to reanimate\nNature. He was a lover on his way to learn his fate at the cabin of his\nmistress.\n\n\"Should the maiden blow out the torch, she accepts the offered vows; but\nif she veil herself without extinguishing it, she refuses the spouse.\n\n\"The warrior, gliding through the shades, chanted these words in a low\ntone of voice:\n\n\"'I will outrun the steps of the daylight upon the mountain-tops to seek\nmy lonely dove in the midst of the oaks of the forest.\n\n\"'I have fastened around her throat a necklace of porcelain, * with\nthree red beads for my love, three violet ones for my fears, three blue\nones for my hopes.\n\n     * A necklace of shells.\n\n\"'Mila has the eyes of an ermine, and hair as light as a field of rice;\nher mouth is a pink shell lined with pearls; her two breasts are like\ntwo little spotless kids, born the same day of one mother.\n\n[Illustration: 031]\n\n\"'May Mila extinguish this torch! May her mouth cast a voluptuous shade\nover it! I will fertilize her bosom! The hope of the country shall hang\nfrom her fruitful breast, and I will smoke my calumet of peace by the\ncradle of my son.\n\n\"'Ah! let me outrun the steps of the daylight upon the mountain-tops to\nseek my lonely dove amidst the oaks of the forest!'\n\n\"Thus sang this young man, whose accents agitated me to the bottom of my\nsoul, and caused Atala to chance countenance. Our united hands trembled\nin each other. But we were diverted from this scene by another scene not\nless dangerous for us.\n\n\"We passed near a child's tomb, which served as a boundary between two\nnations. It had been placed on the border of the road, according to\ncustom, in order that the young wives, when going to the fountain, might\ndraw into their bosom the soul of the innocent creature, and restore it\nto the country. At this moment several newly-married spouses were there,\nand, desirous of the sweets of maternity, were endeavoring, by opening\ntheir lips, to receive the soul of the little child, which they fancied\nthey saw wandering amongst the flowers. The veritable mother came\nafterwards, and deposited a bunch of corn and white lilies upon the\ntomb; she sprinkled the earth with her milk, sat down upon the damp\nturf, and spoke thus to her child in an impassioned voice:\n\n\"'Why do I weep for thee in thy earthly cradle, O my new-born? When the\nlittle bird has grown, it must seek its own nutriment, and finds many\nbitter seeds in the desert. At least thou hast been unconscious of\ntears; at least thy heart has not been exposed to the devouring breath\nof men. The bud that dries up in its envelope passes away with all its\nperfumes, like thou, O my son, with all thine innocence. Happy are those\nwho die in the cradle! they have only known the kisses and smiles of a\nmother!'\n\n\"Already subdued by our own hearts, we were overwhelmed by the images\nof love and maternity which seemed to pursue us in these enchanted\nsolitudes. I carried Atala away in my arms to the extremity of the\nforest, where I told her things that I should in vain endeavor to repeat\nto-day with my lips. The southern wind, my dear son, loses its heat on\npassing over mountains of ice. The souvenirs of love in the heart of an\nold man are like the fires of day reflected by the peaceful orb of the\nmoon when the sun has set, and silence spreads itself over the huts of\nthe savages.\n\n\"What could save Atala? what could prevent her from succumbing to\nNature? Nothing, doubtless, but a miracle; and that miracle was\naccomplished. The daughter of Simaghan had recourse to the God of the\nChristians; she threw herself upon the ground, and uttered a fervent\nprayer, addressed to her mother and to the Queen of Virgins. It was\nfrom this moment, O Ren\u00c3\u00a9, that I entertained a wonderful idea of that\nreligion which, in the forests, in the midst of all the privations of\nlife, imparts a thousand boons to the unfortunate; of that religion\nwhich, opposing its power to the torrent of the passions, suffices alone\nto conquer them, when everything else is in their favor--the secrecy of\nthe woods, the absence of men, and the fidelity of the shades. Ah, how\ndivine to me appeared that simple savage, the ignorant Atala, who, on\nher knees before an old fallen pine-tree, as at the foot of an altar,\nwas offering up a prayer to her God in favor of an idolatrous lover! Her\neyes raised towards the star of the night, her cheeks, brilliant with\ntears of religion and of love, were of immortal beauty. Several times\nit appeared to me as though she were about to take her flight to heaven;\nseveral times I fancied I saw come down upon the rays of the moon, and\nheard amidst the trees, those genii whom the God of the Christians\nsends to the hermits of the rocks when He is about to call them back to\nHimself. I was afflicted by all this, for I feared that Atala had but\nlittle time to remain on earth.\n\n\"Nevertheless, she shed such abundant tears, she appeared so unhappy,\nthat I was perhaps upon the point of consenting to take my departure,\nwhen the cry of death resounded through the forest. Four armed men\nrushed upon me. We had been discovered; the war-chief had given orders\nfor our pursuit.\n\n\"Atala, who resembled a queen in the pride of her demeanor, disdained to\nspeak to these warriors. She glanced nobly at them, and went forthwith\nto Simaghan.\n\n\"She could obtain no concession. My guards were doubled, my chains\nincreased, and my lover was kept away from me. Five nights passed,\nand then we perceived Apalachucla, situated on the banks of the river\nChata-Uche. I was immediately crowned with flowers; my face was painted\nblue and red; beads were fastened to my nose and to my ears, and a\nchichikou\u00c3\u00a9 * was placed in my hand.\n\n\"Thus prepared for the sacrifice, I entered Apalachucla amidst the\nreiterated shouts of the crowd. My fate was sealed; when all of a sudden\nthe sound of a conch was heard, and the mico, or chief of the nation,\nordered an assembly.\n\n\"You know, my son, the torments to which savages subject their prisoners\nof war. Christian missionaries, at the risk of their lives, and with\nan indefatigable charity, had succeeded in inducing several nations to\nsubstitute a comparatively mild slavery to the horrors of the funeral\npile. The Muscogulges had not yet adopted this custom, but a numerous\nparty amongst them had declared themselves in favor of it. It was\nto decide upon this important matter that the mico had convoked the\nsachems, or wise men. I was conducted to the place of deliberation.\n\n\"The pavilion of the council was situated upon an isolated mound not\nfar from Apalachucla. Three circles of columns constituted the elegant\narchitecture of this rotunda. The columns were of polished and carved\ncypress-wood, increasing in height and in thickness, and diminishing in\nnumber as they approached the centre, which was indicated by a single\npillar. From the summit of this pillar depended strips of bark, which,\npassing over the tops of the other columns, covered the pavilion in the\nguise of an open fan.\n\n     * A musical instrument played by the savages.\n\n\"The council assembled. Fifty old men, in beaver cloaks, were ranged\nupon the steps facing the door of the pavilion. The grand chief was\nseated in their midst, holding in his hand the calumet of peace,\nhalf-colored for war. On the right of the old men were placed fifty\nwomen, dressed in robes of swan-feathers. The war-chiefs, with a\ntomahawk in the hand, a bunch of feathers on the head, and their arms\nand chests dyed with blood, occupied the left.\n\n\"At the foot of the central column the fire of the council was burning.\nThe first jungler, surrounded by eight guardians of the temple, dressed\nin long vestments, and wearing a stuffed owl upon their heads, poured\nsome balm of copal upon the flames, and offered a sacrifice to the\nsun. The triple row of old men, matrons, and warriors--the priests, the\nclouds of incense, and the sacrifice--imparted to this council an aspect\naltogether imposing.\n\n[Illustration: 035]\n\n\"I was standing chained in the midst of the assembly. When the sacrifice\nwas finished, the mico spoke, and explained with simplicity the affair\nthat had brought the council together. He threw a blue necklace upon the\nground, as evidence of what he had just said.\n\n\"Then a sachem of the tribe of the Eagle rose, and spoke thus:\n\n\"'My father the mico, sachems, matrons, warriors of the four tribes\nof the Eagle, the Beaver, the Serpent, and the Tortoise, let us change\nnothing in the manners of our forefathers: let us burn the prisoner, and\nlet us not allow our courage to be weakened. It is a custom of the white\nmen that is now proposed to you; it cannot be other than pernicious.\nGive a red collar which contains my words. I have spoken.'\n\n\"And he threw a red collar into the midst of the assembly.\n\n\"A matron then rose, and said:\n\n\"'My father Eagle, you have the cleverness of a fox and the prudent\nslowness of a tortoise. I will polish the chain of friendship with you,\nand we will plant together the tree of peace. But let us change the\ncustoms of our forefathers when they are of a terrible character. Let us\nhave slaves to cultivate our fields, and let us no longer hear the\ncries of the prisoners, which trouble the bosoms of the mothers. I have\nspoken.'\n\n\"As the waves of the ocean are broken up by a storm; as in autumn\nthe dried leaves are carried away in a whirlwind; as the reeds of the\nMississippi bend and rise again during a sudden inundation; as a great\nherd of deer bellow in the depths of a forest, so was the council\nagitated and murmuring. Sachems, warriors, and matrons spoke by turns,\nor all together. Interests clashed, opinions were divided, and the\ncouncil was about to be dissolved; but at length the ancient custom\nprevailed, and I was condemned to the pile.\n\n\"A circumstance caused my punishment to be delayed: the Feast of the\nDead, or the Festival of Souls, was approaching, and it is the custom\nnot to put any captive to death during the days consecrated to that\nceremony. I was handed over to a strict guard, and doubtless the sachems\nhad sent away the daughter of Simaghan, as I saw her no longer.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the tribes for more than three hundred leagues around\ncame in crowds to celebrate the Festival of Souls. A long hut had been\nconstructed upon an isolated situation. On the day indicated, each cabin\nexhumed the remains of its fathers from their private tombs, and the\nskeletons were hung upon the walls of the Common-room of the Ancestors\nin order and by families. The winds (a tempest had burst forth), the\nforests, and the cataracts roared from without, while the old men of the\ndifferent nations were engaged in concluding treaties of peace between\nthe tribes over the bones of their fathers.\n\n\"Funeral amusements were indulged in, running, ball, and a game with\nsmall bones. Two maidens tried to snatch from each other a willow-twig.\nTheir hands fluttered about the twig, which each in her turn held above\nher head. Their beautiful naked feet intertwined, their mouths met,\ntheir sweet breaths became confounded; they stooped, and their hairs\nwere mixed together; then they looked at their mothers, and blushed in\nthe midst of applause. * The jungler invoked Michabou, the genius of the\nwaters, and related the wars of the great Hare against Machimanitou,\nthe god of evil. He spoke of the first man, and of Atha\u00c3\u00abnsic, the first\nwoman, being hurled from heaven for having lost their innocence; of the\nearth having been reddened with a brother's blood; of the immolation of\nTahouistsarou by the impious Jouskeka; of the deluge commanded by the\nvoice of the Great Spirit; of Massou, the only one saved in his bark\nvessel; and of the crow sent out to discover the land. He spoke,\nmoreover, of the beautiful Enda\u00c3\u00ab, recalled from the land of souls by the\nsweet songs of her spouse.\n\n\"After these games and hymns, preparations were made for giving the\nancestors an eternal sepulture.\n\n\"Upon the borders of the river Chata-Uche there was a wild fig-tree,\nwhich the worship of the people had consecrated. The Indian maidens were\nin the habit of washing their bark-dresses at this place, and exposing\nthem to the breath of the desert upon the branches of the ancient tree.\nIt was there that an immense tomb had been dug.\n\n\"While leaving the funeral chamber, the hymn of death was sung. Each\nfamily carried some sacred remains. On arriving at the tomb, the relics\nwere lowered down into it, and spread out in layers, separated by the\nskins of bears and beavers; the mound of the tomb was then raised, and\nthe tree of tears and of sleep planted upon it.\n\n\"Let us pity men, my dear son! Those very Indians whose customs are so\ntouching, those very women who had displayed such a tender interest in\nmy behalf, now called out loudly for my execution; and entire tribes\ndelayed their departure, in order to have the pleasure of seeing a young\nman undergo the most horrible sufferings.\n\n\"In a valley to the north, at some distance from the grand village, was\na wood of cypresses and deals, called the Wood of Blood. It was reached\nby the ruins of one of those monuments of which the origin is ignored,\nand which were the work of a people now unknown. I was led thither in\ntriumph. Preparations were being made for my death. The pole of Areskoui\nwas planted; pine, elm, and cypress-trees fell beneath the axe; the\nfuneral pile was rising, and spectators were constructing amphitheatres\nwith the branches and trunks of trees. Each one was occupied in\ninventing a torture. Some proposed to tear the skin off my head, others\nto burn my eyes out with red-hot axes. I began to sing the song of\ndeath:\n\n     * Blushing is a marked characteristic with young savages.\n\n\"'I do not fear torture: I am brave, O Muscognlges! I defy you; I\ndespise you more than women. My father, Outalissi, son of Miscou, drank\nout of the skulls of your most famous warriors; you will not draw a sigh\nfrom my breast.'\n\n\"Provoked by my song, a warrior pierced my arm with an arrow. I merely\nsaid, 'Brother, I thank thee.'\n\n\"In spite of the activity of the executioners, the preparations for\nmy execution could not be completed before the setting of the sun. A\njungler was consulted, and he forbade the genii of the shades to be\ntroubled, so that my death was postponed till the following day. But, in\ntheir impatience to enjoy the spectacle, and in order to be ready sooner\non the break of day, the Indians did not quit the Wood of Blood. They\nlighted large fires, and began a series of festivities and dances.\n\n[Illustration: 039]\n\n\"Meanwhile, I had been laid down upon my back. Cords from my neck, from\nmy feet, and from my arms, were attached to stakes fixed in the\nground. Warriors were seated upon these cords, and I could not make\nthe slightest movement without their knowledge. The night advanced; the\nsongs and dances gradually ceased; the fires emitted but a ruddy light,\nin front of which I could see the shadows of some of the savages pass.\nAt last they all fell asleep; but as the noise of men became pacified,\nthat of the desert seemed to increase, and to the tumult of voices\nsucceeded the howlings of the winds in the forest.\n\n\"It was the hour when a young Indian recently become a mother awakes\nwith a start in the middle of the night, fancying she has heard the cry\nof her first-born babe desirous of her sweet nutriment. With my eyes\ngazing up to heaven, where the crescent moon was wandering in the\nclouds, I was reflecting upon my destiny. Atala appeared to me to be\na monster of ingratitude thus to abandon me at the moment of\npunishment--I, who had given myself up to the flames rather than leave\nher! And yet I felt that I still loved her, and that I should die with\njoy for Atala.\n\n\"In extreme pleasures there is a sting that excites one as though to\ncounsel us to profit by the rapidly passing moment: in great grief, on\nthe contrary, there is something heavy that induces drowsiness; the\neyes fatigued with tears naturally seek to close, and the goodness of\nProvidence may be thus remarked even in our misfortunes. I gave way,\nin spite of myself, to that heavy sleep which sometimes overcomes the\nwretched. I dreamt that my chains were being taken off; I thought I felt\nthe satisfaction experienced when, after having been tightly pressed, a\nhelping hand relieves us of our irons.\n\n\"This sensation was so vivid that it caused me to raise my eyelids. By\nthe light of the moon, a ray of which was escaping between two clouds,\nI saw a tall white figure leaning over me, and silently occupied in\nloosening my bonds. I was about to utter a cry, when a hand, which I\ninstantly recognized, closed my mouth. A single cord remained, but it\nappeared impossible to cut it without touching a warrior who covered\nit entirely with his body. Atala placed her hand upon it. The warrior,\nhalf-awakened, bestirred himself, and sat up. Atala remained motionless,\nand looked at him. The Indian thought he was looking at the Spirit of\nthe ruins; and he lay down again, closing his eyes and invoking his\nmanitou. The bond was broken. I arose and followed my deliverer, who\ntendered to me the end of a bow of which she held the other extremity.\nBut with what dangers were we surrounded! At times we were on the point\nof stumbling over the sleeping savages; then a guard questioned us,\nand Atala replied in an assumed voice. Children were crying, and dogs\nbarking. Scarcely had we got clear of the fatal enclosure, when terrible\nhowlings resounded through the forest. The camp was aroused. A thousand\nfires were lighted, and savages were running about in all directions\nwith torches. We hurried away with precipitation.\n\n\"When day broke upon the Apalaches, we were already far away. Great was\nmy felicity on finding myself again in solitude with Atala--with Atala\nmy deliverer, with Atala who was giving herself to me for ever! Words\nfailed my tongue. I fell on my knees, and said to the daughter of\nSimaghan: 'Men are but little; but when the genii visit them, they are\nnothing at all. You are a genius; you have visited me, and I cannot\nspeak before you.' Atala offered me her hand with a smile: 'I am obliged\nto follow you,' she said, 'since you will not fly without me. During\nthe night I seduced the jungler with presents, I intoxicated your\nexecutioners with essence of fire, * and I risked my life for you,\nbecause you had given yours for me. Yes, young idolator!' she added,\nwith an accent that alarmed me, 'the sacrifice will be reciprocal.'\n\n\"Atala gave me the weapons she had had the precaution to bring, and then\nshe dressed my wound. Whilst wiping it with a papaya-leaf, she wetted it\nwith her tears. 'It is a balm,' I said to her, 'that you are dropping on\nmy arm.' 'I am rather afraid that it may be a poison,' she replied. She\ntore one of the coverings from her bosom, with which she made a first\nbandage that she fastened with a tress of lier hair.\n\n\"Intoxication, which lasts a long time upon savages, and is for them a\nspecies of malady, prevented them from pursuing us during the first few\ndays. If they sought for us afterwards, it was probably in a westerly\ndirection, as they must have thought we should make for the Mississippi;\nbut we had taken our flight towards the fixed star, ** guiding ourselves\nby the moss on the trunks of the trees.\n\n     * Brandy.\n\n     ** The north.\n\n\"We were not long in perceiving that we had gained but little by\nmy deliverance. The desert now unrolled before us its immeasurable\nsolitudes. Without experience in forest life, having lost our way, and\nwalking on at hazard, what was to become of us? Often, while gazing upon\nAtala, I remembered the ancient story of Agar, that Lopez had given me\nto read, and which happened in the desert of Beersheba a long time ago,\nwhen men lived to three times the age of the oak.\n\n\"Atala made me a cloak out of some ash-bark, and she also embroidered me\na pair of musk rat skin moccasins with porcupine's hair. In my turn, I\ndid all in my power to ornament her attire. First of all, I placed upon\nher head a crown of those blue mallows that crowded beneath our feet\nin the abandoned Indian cemeteries; then I made her necklaces of red\nazalea-berries; and after all I smiled in the contemplation of her\nwonderful beauty.\n\n\"When we encountered a river, we crossed it either on a raft or by\nswimming. Atala placed one of her hands upon my shoulder, and thus, like\na pair of migratory swans, we traversed the solitary waves.\n\n\"During the great heat of the day we often sought shelter beneath the\nmoss of the cedars. Nearly all the Floridan trees, especially the cedar\nand the oak, are covered with a white moss, which descends from their\nbranches down to the very ground. At night-time, by moonlight, should\nyou happen to see, in the open savannah, an isolated holm dressed in\nsuch drapery, you would imagine it to be a phantom dragging after it a\nnumber of long veils. The scene is not less picturesque by day, when a\ncrowd of butterflies, brilliant insects, colibris, green paroquets, and\nblue jackdaws entangle themselves amongst the moss, and thus produce the\neffect of a piece of white woollen tapestry embroidered by some clever\nEuropean workman with beautiful birds and sparkling insects.\n\n[Illustration: 043]\n\n[Illustration: 045]\n\n\"It was in the shade of such smiling quarters, prepared by the Great\nSpirit, that we stopped to repose ourselves. When the winds come down\nfrom heaven to rock the great cedar, when the aerial castles built upon\nits brandies undulate with the birds and the travellers sleeping beneath\nits shelter, when thousands of sighs pass through the corridors of the\nwaving edifice, there is nothing amongst the wonders of the ancient\nworld to be compared with this monument of the desert.\n\n\"Every evening we lighted a large fire and built a travelling hut of\nbark raised upon four stakes. When I had killed a wild turkey, a pigeon,\nor a wood-pheasant, we attached it to the end of a pole before a pile\nof burning oak, and left the care of turning the hunter's prey to the\ncaprices of the wind. We used to eat a kind of moss called rock-tripe,\nsweetened bark, and May-apples, that tasted of the peach and the\nraspberry. The black-walnut-tree, the maple-tree, and the sumach\nfurnished our table with wine. Sometimes I went and fetched from\namongst the reeds a plant whose flower, in the form of an elongated cup,\ncontained a glass of the purest dew. We blessed Heaven for having placed\nthis limpid spring upon the stalk of a flower, in the midst of the\ncorrupted marshes, just as it has placed hope at the bottom of hearts\nulcerated by grief; just also as it has caused virtue to well up from\nthe bosom of the miseries of life!\n\n\"I soon discovered, alas! that I had deceived myself as to the apparent\ncalm of my beloved Atala. The farther we advanced the sadder she became.\nShe frequently shuddered without a cause, and turned her head aside\nhurriedly. I sometimes caught her regarding me with a passionate look,\nwhich she at once cast towards the sky with a profound melancholy. What\nalarmed me above all was a secret thought concealed in the bottom of her\nsoul, but which I read in her eyes. Constantly drawing me towards her\nand then pushing me away, re-animating my hopes, and then destroying\nthem when I thought I had made some progress in her heart, I found\nmyself still at the same point. How many times she said to me, 'O my\nyoung sweetheart! I love you like the shade of the woods at mid-day!'\nYou are as beautiful as the desert with all its flowers and all its\nbreezes. If I incline towards you, I tremble: when my hand falls upon\nyours, it seems to me as though I were about to die. The other day the\nwind blew your hair upon my face as you were reposing yourself upon my\nbosom, and I fancied I felt the light touch of the invisible spirits.\nYes, I have seen the young kids of the mountain of Occona; I have\nlistened to the language of men ripe with years; but the mildness of\ngoats and the wisdom of old men are less agreeable and less powerful\nthan your words. Ah, my poor Chactas! I shall never be your spouse!'\n\n\"The constant struggle between Atala's love and religion, her tender\nfreedom and the chastity of her conduct, the pride of her character and\nher profound sensitiveness, the elevation of her soul in great things,\nher susceptibility about trifles, rendered her, in my opinion, an\nincomprehensible being. Atala could not hold a weak empire over a man.\nFull of passion, she was full of power. She must either be adored or\nhated.\n\n\"After fifteen nights of hurried march, we entered upon the chain of the\nAlleghany mountains, and reached one of the branches of the Tennessee, a\nriver that falls into the Ohio. Aided by the advice of Atala, I built a\nboat, which I coated with plum-tree gum, after having re-sewn the bark\nwith roots of the fir. I subsequently embarked therein with Atala, and\nwe abandoned ourselves to the current of the river.\n\n\"The Indian village of Stico\u00c3\u00ab, with its pyramidal tombs and ruined huts,\nappeared on our left at the turn of a promontory; on the right we left\nthe valley of Keow, terminated by the perspective of the cabins of Jore,\nwhich seemed to be suspended from the forehead of the mountain of the\nsame name. The river which carried us along flowed between high cliffs,\nat the extremity of which we perceived the setting sun. The profound\nsolitudes were not disturbed by the presence of men. We only saw one\nIndian hunter, who, leaning motionless upon his bow, on the peak of a\nrock, looked like a statue raised upon the mountain to the genius of\nthose deserts.\n\n\"Atala and myself added our silence to the silence of this scene. All\nof a sudden, the daughter of exile filled the air by thus singing, in a\nvoice replete with melancholy emotion, of her absent country:\n\n\"'Happy are they who have not seen the smoke of foreign festivals, and\nwho have never been seated elsewhere than at the rejoicings of their\nfathers!\n\n\"'If the blue jackdaw of the Mississippi were to say to the nonpareil\nof the Floridas, \"Why dost thou complain so sadly? Hast thou not here\nbeautiful waters and lovely shades, and all sorts of pastures, as in\nthine own forests?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" would reply the fugitive nonpareil; \"but my nest is in the\njessamine; who will bring it to me? And the sun of my savannah, where is\nit?\"\n\n\"'Happy are they who have not seen the smoke of foreign festivals, and\nwho have never been seated elsewhere than at the rejoicings of their\nfathers!\n\n\"'After hours of painful wayfare, the traveller sits down in sadness. He\nsees around him the roofs of men's habitations, but has no place wherein\nto repose his head. The traveller knocks at a cabin, places his bow\nbehind the door, and asks for hospitality. The master makes a gesture of\nthe hand; the traveller takes back his bow, and returns to the desert.\n\n\"'Happy are they who have not seen the smoke of foreign festivals, and\nwho have never been seated elsewhere than at the rejoicings of their\nfathers!\n\n\"'Wondrous stories told around the hearth, tender effusions of the\nheart, long habits of loving so necessary to life, you have filled the\ndays of those who have not quitted their natal place! Their tombs are\nin the land of their birth, with the setting sun, the tears of their\nfriends and the charms of religion.\n\n\"'Happy are they who have not seen the smoke of foreign festivals, and\nwho have never been seated elsewhere than at the rejoicings of their\nfathers!'\n\n\"Thus sang Atala. Nothing interrupted the course of her lamentations,\nexcept the almost imperceptible sound of our boat upon the waves. In two\nor three places only were they taken up by a weak echo, which repeated\nthem to a second, and the second to a third, faintly and more faintly\nstill. It seemed as though the souls of two lovers, formerly unfortunate\nlike ourselves, and attracted by the touching melody, were enjoying the\npleasure of sighing forth the dying sounds of its music in the mountain.\n\n\"Nevertheless, the solitude, the constant presence of the beloved\nobject, even our misfortunes, increased our affection from one instant\nto another. Atala prayed continuously to her mother, whose irritated\nshade she seemed as though wishing to appease. She sometimes asked me\nif I did not hear a plaintive voice, and see flames issuing out of the\nearth. As for myself, exhausted with fatigue, but still burning with\ndesire, and thinking that I was perhaps irretrievably lost in the midst\nof those forests, I was a hundred times upon the point of drawing my\nspouse to my arms, and a hundred times did I urge Atala to allow me to\nbuild a hut upon the river side, so that we might bury ourselves therein\ntogether. But she always resisted my propositions. 'Remember, my young\nfriend,' she would say, 'that a warrior owes himself to his country.\nWhat is a woman compared to the duties you have to fulfil? Take courage,\nson of Outalissi; do not murmur against your destiny. The heart of man\nis like a river-sponge, that imbibes pure water during calm weather, and\nis swollen with muddy liquid when the sky has troubled the waves. Has\nthe sponge the right to say, \"I thought there would never be any storms,\nand that the sun would never be scorching?\"'\n\n\"O Ren\u00c3\u00a9, if you fear the trials of the heart, be upon your guard against\nsolitude. The great passions are solitary, and to transport them to\nthe desert is to restore them to their triumph. Overcome with cares\nand fears; exposed to the danger of falling into the hands of Indian\nenemies, to be swallowed up by the waters, stung by serpents, devoured\nby beasts; finding the poorest nourishment with difficulty, and not\nknowing whither to direct our steps, it seemed impossible for our\nmisfortunes to be greater, when an accident brought them to a climax.\n\n\"It was the twenty-seventh sun since our departure from the cabins. The\nmoon of fire had commenced her course, and everything announced a storm.\nTowards the hour when the Indian matrons hang up the plough-handle to\nthe branches of the sabin-tree, and when the paroquets retire into the\nhollows of the cypress, the sky began to be overcast. The voices of\nthe solitude died away, the desert became silent, and the forests were\nreposing in the midst of a universal calm. Shortly after, the rollings\nof a distant thunder, prolonged through the woods as old as the world,\nre-issued from them with sublime sounds. Fearful of being submerged, we\nhastened to reach the bank of the river, and withdrew into a forest.\n\n     * The month of July.\n\n\"The ground in this place was marshy. We advanced with difficulty under\na vault of smilax, amidst vines, indigo-plants, bean-trees, and creeping\nivy that entangled our feet like nets. The spongy soil trembled around\nus, and at each instant we were on the point of sinking into the\nquagmires. Insects without number, and enormous bats, blinded us;\nbell-serpents were hissing in every direction, and wolves, bears,\ncarcajous, and young tigers, come to hide themselves in these retreats,\nmade them resound with their roarings.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the darkness increased. The lowering clouds were entering\nbeneath the leafy covering of the woods. Suddenly the sky was rent, and\nthe lightning traced a rapid zig-zag of fire. A violent wind from the\nwest rolled clouds upon clouds; the forests bent; the sky opened time\nafter time, and from between the interstices other skies and ardent\nscenes might be perceived. What a frightful, what a magnificent\nspectacle! The lightning set fire to the forest; the conflagration\nextended like a head-dress of flame; columns of sparks and of smoke\nbesieged the clouds, which were vomiting their flashes into the vast\nburning mass. Then the Great Spirit covered the mountain with heavy\ndarkness; and from the midst of this chaos there arose a confused\nmoaning, formed by the rushing of the winds, the cracking of trees, the\nhowling of wild beasts, the buzzing of the inflamed vegetation, and the\nrepeated fall of thunderbolts hissing as they died out in the waters.\n\n\"The Great Spirit knows that at this moment I saw and thought of nothing\nbut Atala. I managed to guard her against the torrents of rain by\nplacing her beneath the inclining trunk of a birch-tree, under which I\nsat down, holding my well-beloved upon my knees, and warming her naked\nfeet between my hands; and thus I found myself happier than the young\nspouse who feels her future offspring quiver in her bosom for the first\ntime.\n\n[Illustration: 051]\n\n\"We were listening to the sound of the tempest, when all of a sudden I\nfelt one of Atala's tears fall upon my breast. 'Storm of the heart,'\nI cried to myself, 'is it a drop of your rain?' Then embracing her I\nloved, I said, 'Atala, you are concealing something from me. Open your\nheart to me, O beauty! It does one so much good when a friend looks into\none's soul. Tell me this secret of grief which you persist in hiding\nfrom me. Ah! I see you are weeping for your country.' She immediately\nretorted, 'Child of men, why should I weep for my country, since my\nfather came not from the land of palms?'--'What!' I replied, with\nprofound astonishment, 'your father was not from the land of palms! What\nwas he then who brought you upon this earth? Reply!' Atala answered in\nthese words:\n\n\"'Before my mother brought to the warrior Simaghan, as a marriage\nportion, thirty mares, twenty buffaloes, a hundred measures of nut-oil,\nfifty beaver-skins, and a quantity of other riches, she had known a man\nof white flesh. Now the mother of my mother threw water in her face, and\nforced her to marry the magnanimous Simaghan, who was like unto a king,\nand honored by the people as a genius. But my mother said to her new\nspouse, \"My bosom has conceived; kill me.\" Simaghan replied to her, \"May\nthe Great Spirit preserve me from such an action! I will not mutilate\nyou. I will neither cut off your nose nor your ears, because you have\nbeen sincere and have not betrayed my couch. The fruit of your bosom\nshall be my fruit, and I will not visit you till after the departure of\nthe bird of the rice-fields, when the thirteenth moon shall have shone.\"\nAbout that time I issued from my mother's bosom, and I began to grow,\nproud as a Spaniard and as a savage. My mother made me a Christian, so\nthat her God and the God of my father might also be my God. Afterwards\nlove-sickness fell upon her, and she went down into the little pit\nfurnished with skins, from which no one ever comes out.'\n\n\"Such was Atala's story. 'And who was your father, then, poor orphan?' I\nsaid to her; 'how was he called by men upon earth, and what name did he\nbear among the genii?'--'I never washed my father's feet,' said Atala:\n'I only know that he lived with his sister at Saint Augustine, and that\nhe ever remained faithful to my mother. Philip was his name amongst the\nangels, and men called him Lopez.\"\n\n\"At these words I uttered a cry which re-echoed throughout the solitude;\nthe soumis of my transports mingled with those of the storm. Pressing\nAtala to my heart, I exclaimed with sobs, 'O my sister! O daughter of\nLopez! daughter of my benefactor!' Atala, alarmed, sought to ascertain\nthe cause of my agitation; but when she learnt that Lopez was the\ngenerous host who had adopted me at Saint Augustine, and whom I had\nquitted in order to be free, she was herself stricken with joy and\nconfusion.\n\n\"This fraternal friendship which came upon us and joined its love to our\nlove, was too much for our hearts. Already had I intoxicated myself with\nher breath, already had I drunk all the magic of love upon her lips.\nWith my eyes raised towards heaven, amidst the flash of the lightnings,\nI held my spouse in my arms in the presence of the Eternal. Splendid\npomp, worthy of our misfortunes and of the grandeur of our loves; superb\nforests, that shook your creeping plants and your leafy domes as though\nthey were to be the curtains and the canopy of our couch; overflowing\nriver, roaring mountains, frightful and sublime Nature, were you then\nbut a combination prepared to deceive us, and could you not for one\nmoment conceal a man's felicity amidst your mysterious horrors?\n\n\"Suddenly a vivid flash, followed by a clap of thunder, ran through the\nthickness of the shades, filled the forest with sulphur and light,\nand rent a tree close by us. We fled. O surprise! In the silence which\nfollowed, we heard the sound of a bell. Both speechless, we listened to\nthe sound, so strange in a desert. At the same instant a dog barked in\nthe distance. It approached, redoubled its cries, came up to us, and\nhowled with joy at our feet. An old hermit, carrying a small lantern,\nwas following the animal through the darkness of the forest. 'Heaven be\npraised!' he cried, as soon as he perceived us; 'I have been looking for\nyou a long time! Our dog smelt you as soon as the storm commenced, and\nhas guided me hither. Poor children, how young you are, and how you must\nhave suffered! Come; I have brought a bear-skin. It shall be for this\nyoung woman, and there is some wine in our gourd. Let God be praised in\nall His works! His mercy is great and His goodness is infinite!'\n\n\"Atala threw herself at the feet of the monk. 'Chief of prayer,' said\nshe to him, 'I am a Christian. Heaven has sent you to save me!' 'My\ndaughter,' said the hermit, raising her up, 'we usually ring the\nmission-bell during the night and during tempests, to call strangers;\nand, in imitation of the example of our brethren of the Alps and of the\nLiban, we have taught our dog to discover lost travellers.'\n\n\"I scarcely understood the hermit. This charity appeared to me so much\nabove man that I thought I was dreaming. By the light of the little\nlantern the monk was holding in his hand I saw that his beard and\nhair were saturated with water; his feet, his hands, and his face were\nbleeding: from their encounters with the brambles. 'Old man!' I at\nlength cried, 'what sort of heart have you, that you did not fear being\nstruck by the lightning?' 'Fear!' retorted the father, with a certain\nardor, 'fear when men are in danger and I can be useful to them! I\nshould in that case be an unworthy servant of Jesus Christ!' 'But do you\nknow,' I interrupted, 'that I am not a Christian?' 'Young man,' replied\nthe hermit, 'did I ask you your religion? Jesus Christ did not say, \"My\nblood shall wash this one or that one.\" He died for the Jew and for\nthe Gentile, and He only considered all the races of men as brothers\nin misfortune. What I am now doing for you is but little, and you would\nfind elsewhere plenty of other help; but the glory of it should not\nfall upon the priests. What are we poor hermits, if not the coarse\ninstruments of a celestial work? And what soldier would be cowardly\nenough to retreat when his Chief, with the cross in His hand and His\nforehead covered with thorns, marches before him to the assistance of\nsuffering humanity?'\n\n\"These words went to my heart; tears of admiration and tenderness fell\nfrom my eyes. 'My dear children,' said the missionary, 'I govern in\nthese forests a little flock of your wild brethren. My grotto is not far\nfrom here, in the mountain. Come and warm yourselves under my roof.\nYou will not find the conveniences of life there, but you shall have\nshelter, and you should thank the Divine goodness even for that, for\nthere are many men who are without it.'\n\n[Illustration: 054]\n\n[Illustration: 055]\n\n[Illustration: 057]\n\n\n\n\nII. THE LABORERS.\n\n\"There are some righteous people whose conscience is so tranquil that\none cannot approach them without participating in the peace emitted,\nso to say, by their heart and by their language. As the hermit went on\nspeaking, I felt the passions calm down in my bosom, and even the\nstorm of heaven appeared to recede at his voice. The clouds were soon\nsufficiently dispersed to permit us to quit our retreat. We issued from\nthe forest, and commenced climbing a high mountain. The dog walked by\nour side, carrying the extinguished lantern at the end of a stick.\n\nI held Atala by the hand, and we followed the missionary. He frequently\nturned round to look at us, and seemed to pity our youth and our\nmisfortunes. A book was hanging from his neck, and he leant upon a white\nstaff. His figure was tall, his face pale and thin, and his countenance\nsimple and sincere. His features showed that he had seen bad days,\nand the deep wrinkles in his forehead were the noble scars of passions\novercome by virtue and by the love of God and of man. When he spoke\nto us standing and motionless, his long beard, his eyes modestly cast\ndownwards, the affectionate tone of his voice, everything about him was\ncalm and sublime. Whoever, like myself, has seen Father Aubry with\nhis breviary and staff, on his lonely way in the desert, preserves a\nveritable idea of the Christian traveller upon earth.\n\n\"After half an hour's dangerous march through the paths of the\nmountain, we arrived at the missionary's grotto. We entered it over an\naccumulation of wet ivy and wild plants, washed down from the rocks by\nthe rain. There was nothing in the place beyond a mat of papaya-leaves,\na gourd for drawing up water, a few wooden vessels, a spade, a harmless\nserpent, and, upon a block of stone that served as a table, a crucifix\nand the Book of the Christians.\n\n\"The man of ancient days was not long in lighting a fire with some dried\nleaves. He then crushed some Indian corn between two stones, and having\nmade a cake with it, placed it beneath the ashes to bake. When the cake\nhad come to a fine golden color, he served it to us hot, with nut-cream,\nin a maple bowl. The evening having restored calm, the servant of the\nGreat Spirit proposed that we should go and sit at the entrance to the\ngrotto, which commanded an immense view. The remains of the storm\nhad been carried in disorder towards the east; the fires of the\nconflagration caused in the forests by the lightning were still shining\nin the distance; at the foot of the mountain an entire pine-wood had\nbeen thrown down into the mud, and the river was charged pell-mell with\nmolten clay, trunks of trees, and the bodies of dead animals and of dead\nfishes, floating upon the still agitated surface of the waters.\n\n\"It was in the midst of this scene that Atala related our history to the\nold genius of the mountain. His heart appeared to be touched, and tears\nfell upon his beard. 'My child,' he said to Atala, 'you must offer your\nsufferings to God, for whose glory you have already done so many things.\nHe will give you rest. Look at those smoking forests, those receding\ntorrents, those scattered clouds: do you imagine that He who can calm\nsuch a tempest cannot appease the troubles of the heart of man? If you\nhave no better retreat, my dear daughter, I offer you a place amongst\nthe flock I have had the happiness of calling to Jesus Christ. I will\ninstruct Chactas, and I will give him to you as a husband when he shall\nhave proved himself worthy to be your spouse.'\n\n\"At these words I fell at the hermit's knees, shedding tears of joy; but\nAtala became as pale as death. The old man raised me with benignity,\nand I then perceived that both his hands were mutilated. Atala at once\ncomprehended his misfortunes. 'The barbarians!' she exclaimed.\n\n\"'My daughter,' replied the hermit, with a pleasant smile, 'what is that\nin comparison with the sufferings of my Divine Master? If the Indian\nidolators have tortured me, they are poor, blind creatures, whom God\nwill enlighten some day. I love them all the more for the injury they\nhave done me. I could not remain in my country, to which I had gone\nback, and where an illustrious queen did me the honor to look upon\nthese poor marks of my apostolate. And what more glorious reward could\nI receive for my labors than that of obtaining, from the head of our\nreligion, the permission to celebrate the Divine sacrifice with these\nmutilated hands? It only remained for me, after such an honor, to try\nand render myself worthy of it; so I returned to the; new world to pass\nthe rest of my lift: in the service of my God. I have dwelt in these\nsolitudes nearly thirty years, and it will be twenty-two to-morrow since\nI took possession of this rock. When I came to the place, I encountered\nbut a few wandering families, whose manners were ferocious and whose\nlife was miserable. I have induced them to listen to the word of Peace,\nand their manners have become gradually softened. They now live together\nat the foot of this mountain. Whilst teaching them the way of salvation,\nI endeavored to instruct them in the primary arts of life, but without\ncarrying them too far, and constantly keeping the honest people within\nthe bounds of that simplicity which constitutes happiness. Fearing to\ntrouble them by my presence, I retired to this grotto, where they\ncome to consult me. It is here that far from man, I admire God in the\ngrandeur of the solitude, and prepare myself for the death which the\nlength of my years announces to me as approaching.'\n\n[Illustration: 059]\n\n\"On finishing this discourse, the hermit fell upon his knees, and we\nimitated his example. He began in a loud voice a prayer to which Atala\nresponded. Some dull flashes of lightning still opened the sky in the\neast, and upon the western clouds three suns seemed to be shining at the\nsame time.\n\n\"We re-entered the grotto, where the hermit stretched out a bed of\ncypress-moss for Atala. Profound language was depicted in the eyes and\nmovements of the maiden. She looked at Father Aubry as though she wished\nto reveal a secret to him; but something appeared to deter her from\nso doing--either my presence, or a sort of shame, or perhaps the\nuselessness of the avowal. I heard her get up in the middle of the\nnight. She went to look for the hermit; but, as he had given up his\ncouch to Atala, he had gone to contemplate the beauty of the heavens,\nand to pray to God on the top of the mountain. He told me the next day\nthat such was his custom, even during winter, as he loved to see the\nforests wave their stripped summits, the clouds fly through the air, and\nto hear the winds and the torrents roar in the solitude. My sister was\ntherefore obliged to return to her couch, where she immediately fell\nasleep. Alas! full of hope, I thought Atala's weakness was nothing more\nthan a passing sign of weariness.\n\n\"The following morning I was awakened by the songs of the cardinals and\nthe mockingbirds, nestled in the acacias and laurels that surrounded the\ngrotto. I went forth and gathered a magnolia rose, and placed it, wet\nwith the tears of the morning, upon the head of my sleeping Atala. I\nhoped, according to the religion of my country, that the soul of some\nchild dead at the breast might have descended upon this flower in a\ndew-drop, and that a happy dream might convey it to the bosom of my\nfuture spouse. I afterwards sought my host. I found him, his gown turned\nup into his two pockets, and a chaplet in his hand, waiting for me,\nseated upon the trunk of a pine-tree that had fallen from old age. He\nproposed that we should go together to the Mission while Atala was still\nreposing. I accepted his offer, and we immediately started on our way.\n\n\"On descending the mountain, I perceived some oaks upon which the genii\nseemed to have drawn foreign characters. The hermit told me that he\nhad traced them himself; that they were some verses of an ancient poet\ncalled Homer, and a few sentences of another poet, more ancient still,\nnamed Solomon. There was a sort of mysterious harmony between the wisdom\nof former times, the verses eaten into by moss, the old hermit who had\nengraved them, and the aged oaks which had served him for books.\n\n\"His name, his age, and the date of his mission were also marked upon a\nreed of the savannah at the foot of those trees. I was surprised at the\nfragility of the latter monument. 'It will last longer than I,' replied\nthe father, 'and it will always be of more value than the little good I\nhave done.'\n\n\"From thence we arrived at the entrance to a valley, where I saw a\nwonderful work. It was a natural bridge, similar to that in Virginia,\nof which you have perhaps heard. Men, my son, especially those of\nyour country, often imitate Nature, and their copies are always\ninsignificant. It is not the same with Nature when she appears to\nimitate the labors of men by in reality offering them models. Then it is\nthat she throws bridges from the summit of one mountain to the summit\nof another, suspends roads in the air, spreads rivers for canals, carves\nout hills for columns, and for basins excavates seas.\n\n\"We passed beneath the sole arch of this bridge, and found ourselves in\nfront of another wonder, the cemetery of the Indians of the Mission, or\nthe Groves of Death. Father Aubry had permitted his neophytes to bury\ntheir dead in their manner, and to continue its original name to their\nplace of sepulture. He had merely sanctified the place with a cross. *\nThe soil was divided, like fields set out for harvest, into as many lots\nas there were families. Each lot formed a wood of itself, which varied\naccording to the taste of those who had planted it. A stream meandered\nnoiselessly through the groves. It went by the name of the River of\nPeace. This smiling refuge of souls was closed on the east by the bridge\nbeneath which we had passed. Two hills bounded it on the north and on\nthe south, and it was open only towards the west, where stood a large\nforest of fir trees. The trunks of these trees, spotted with green,\nand growing without branches up to their very summits, resembled tall\ncolumns, and formed the peristyle of this temple of death. We remarked\na religious sound, similar to the half-suppressed murmurs of an organ\nbeneath the roof of a church; but when we had penetrated into the\ninterior of the sanctuary, we could hear nothing beyond the hymns of the\nbirds celebrating an eternal f\u00c3\u00aate to the memory of the dead.\n\n\"On emerging from the wood, we perceived the village of the Mission,\nsituated on the side of a lake, in the midst of a savannah planted\nwith flowers. It was reached by an avenue of magnolias and oaks, which\nbordered one of 'those ancient roads met with towards the mountains that\nseparate Kentucky from the Floridas. As soon as the Indians saw their\npastor in the plain, they abandoned their labors, and hastened to meet\nhim. Some of them kissed his gown, others assisted him to walk; the\nmothers raised their little children in their arms to show them the man\nof Jesus Christ who had shed tears. Father Aubry inquired as he went\nalong of what was going on in the village. He gave counsel to one, and\na mild reprimand to another, He spoke of harvests to be gathered, of\nchildren to be instructed, of troubles to be consoled; and he alluded to\nGod in every topic he touched upon.\n\n\"Thus escorted, we arrived at the foot of the large cross placed by\nthe roadside. It was here that the servant of God was in the habit of\ncelebrating the mysteries of his religion. 'My dear neophytes,' said he,\nturning himself towards the crowd, 'a brother and a sister have come up\nto you, and, as an additional happiness, I see that Providence spared\nyour harvests yesterday. Behold two great reasons for thankfulness. Let\nus therefore offer up the holy sacrifice, and may each of you bring\nto it deep attention, a lively faith, infinite gratitude, and a humble\nheart!'\n\n     * Father Aubry had done like the Jesuits in China, who\n     allowed the Chinese to inter their relations in their\n     gardens, according to an ancient custom.\n\n\"The holy priest forthwith put on a white tunic of mulberry-bark; the\nsacred cups were withdrawn from a tabernacle at the foot of the cross;\nthe altar was set out on a portion of the rock, water was procured from\nthe neighboring torrent, and a bunch of wild grapes furnished the wine\nfor the sacrifice. We all went down upon our knees in the high grass,\nand the mystery began.\n\n\"Break of day, appearing from behind the mountains, inflamed the\neastern sky. Everything in the solitude was golden or roseate. The sun,\nannounced by so much splendor, at length issued from an abyss of light,\nand its first ray fell upon the consecrated host, which the priest was\nat that very moment raising in the air.\n\n\"After the sacrifice, during which nothing was wanting to me but the\ndaughter of Lopez, we went to the village. The most touching mixture of\nsocial and natural life reigned there. By the side of a cypress-wood of\nthe ancient desert was a nascent vegetation; ears of corn rolled like\ngold about the trunk of a fallen oak, and summer sheaves replaced the\ntree of three centuries. On all sides forests given up to the flames\nwere sending up their smoke into the air, and the plough was being\npushed slowly through the remains of their roots. Surveyors with long\nchains went to measure the ground; arbitrators marked out the first\nproperties; the bird gave up its nest; the den of the wild beast was\nconverted into a cabin; forges were heard to roar, and the blows of the\naxe caused the echoes to resound for the last time as they expired with\nthe trees which had served them for a refuse.\n\n\"I wandered with delight in the midst of these scenes, rendered still\nmore enchanting by the image of Atala and by the dreams of felicity with\nwhich I was feeding my heart. I admired the triumph of Christianity\nover savage life. I saw the Indian becoming civilized by the voice of\nreligion; I assisted at the primitive union of man and the earth--man,\nby this great contract, abandoning to the earth the inheritance of\nhis labors; and the earth undertaking in return to bear faithfully the\nharvests, the sons, and the ashes of man.\n\n\"During this time a child was presented to the missionary, who baptized\nit among the flowering jessamine on the border of a spring, whilst a\ncoffin, in the midst of these joys and labors, was being carried to the\nGroves of Death. Two spouses received the nuptial benediction beneath an\noak, and we afterwards went to install them in a corner of the desert.\nThe pastor walked in front of us, blessing here and there a rock, a tree\nor a fountain, as of old, according to the book of the Christians, God\nblessed the untilled land when He gave it to Adam for an inheritance.\nThis procession, which, with the flocks, was following its venerable\nchief from rock to rock, represented to my affected heart the migrations\nof the first families, when Shem, with his children, advanced into an\nunknown world, following the sun as his guide.\n\n\"I desired to know from the hermit how he governed his flock. With great\npatience he replied to me, 'I have laid down no law for them; I have\nmerely taught them to love one another, to pray to God, and to hope for\na better life. All the laws in the world are comprised therein. Towards\nthe middle of the village you may perceive a cabin somewhat larger than\nthe rest. It serves as a chapel during the rainy season. My children\nassemble there morning and evening to praise the Lord, and when I am\nabsent an old man offers up the prayers; for old age, like maternity,\nis a sort of priesthood. The people afterwards go to work in the fields;\nand although the properties are divided, in order that each may learn\nsomething of social economy, the harvests are deposited in the same\nstorehouse, out of a spirit of brotherly charity. Four old men are\ncharged with the equal distribution of the produce of the general\nlabors. Add to all that our religious ceremonies, plenty of hymns, the\ncross where I celebrate the mysteries, the elm-tree beneath which I\npreach in fine weather, our tombs near our corn-fields, our rivers into\nwhich I plunge the little children, and the Saint Johns of this new\nBethany, and you will have a complete idea of this kingdom of Jesus\nChrist.'\n\n\"The language of the hermit delighted me, and I felt the superiority of\nthis stable and busy life over the wandering and idle existence of the\nsavage.\n\n\"Ah, Ren\u00c3\u00a9! I do not repine against Providence, yet I confess I never\nthink of that evangelical society without experiencing bitter regret.\nHow a hut, with Atala, in that neighborhood, would have rendered my life\nhappy! There all my wanderings would have ceased; there, with a spouse,\nignored by men and concealing my happiness in the depths of the forest,\nmy days would have flown by like those rivers which have not even a name\nin the desert. Instead of the peace I was then bold enough to promise\nmyself, amidst what troubles have my years been cast! The constant\nplaything of fortune, wrecked upon every shore, long an exile from\nmy country, and on my return thither finding only a ruined cabin and\nfriends in the tomb--such was to be the destiny of Chactas.\n\n[Illustration: 064]\n\n[Illustration: 065]\n\n[Illustration: 067]\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE DRAMA.\n\n\"If my dream of happiness was bright, it was also of short duration, and\nI was to be awakened from it at the hermit's grotto. On arriving there\nin the middle of the clay, I was surprised at not seeing Atala come\nforth to meet us. I cannot tell what sudden apprehension took possession\nof me. As we approached the grotto, I dared not call the daughter of\nLopez; my imagination was equally frightened by the idea of the noise or\nof the silence that might follow my cries. Still more terrified by the\ndark appearance of the entrance to the rock, I said to the missionary,\n'O you, whom heaven accompanies and strengthens, penetrate into those\nshades!'\n\n\"How weak is the man who is governed by his passions! How strong is he\nwho relies upon God! There was more courage in that religious heart,\nwithered by seventy-six years, than in all the ardor of my youth. The\nman of peace entered the grotto, whilst I remained outside, full of\nterror. Soon a feeble murmur of complaint issued from the interior\nof the rock, and fell upon my ear. Uttering a cry as I recovered my\nstrength, I rushed into the darkness of the cavern. Spirits of my\nfathers, you alone know the spectacle that met my view!\n\n\"The hermit had lighted a pine-torch, which he was holding with a\ntrembling hand over Atala's couch. With her hair in disorder, the young\nand beautiful woman, slightly raised upon her elbow, looked pale\nand suffering. Drops of painful sweat shone upon her forehead; her\nhalf-extinguished eyes still sought to express her love to me, and her\nmouth endeavored to smile. As though struck by lightning, with my eyes\nfixed, my arms outstretched, and my lips apart, I remained motionless.\nA profound silence reigned for a moment between the three personages of\nthis scene of grief. The hermit was the first to break it. 'This,'\nhe said, 'can only be a fever occasioned by fatigue, and if we resign\nourselves to God's will, He will take pity on us.'\n\n\"At these words my heart revived, and, with the mobility of the savage,\nI passed suddenly from an excess of fear to an excess of confidence,\nfrom which, however, Atala soon aroused me. Shaking her head sadly, she\nmade us a sign to approach her couch.\n\n\"'My father,' she said, in a weak voice, addressing herself to the\nhermit, 'I am upon the point of death. O Chactas! listen without despair\nto the fatal secret I had concealed from you in order not to make you\ntoo miserable, and out of obedience to my mother. Try not to interrupt\nme by any marks of grief, which would shorten the few moments I have to\nlive. I have many things to tell of, and from the beatings of my heart,\nwhich slacken--I do not know what icy burden presses within my bosom--I\nfeel that I cannot make too much haste!'\n\n\"After a short silence, Atala continued thus:--\n\n\"'My sad destiny began almost before I had seen the light. My mother had\nconceived me in misfortune. I wearied her bosom, and she brought me into\nthe world with such painful difficulty that my life was despaired of. To\nsave me, my mother made a vow. She promised the Queen of Angels that I\nshould consecrate myself to an unwedded life if I escaped from death.\nThat fatal vow is now hurrying me to the tomb!\n\n\"'I was entering upon my sixteenth year when I lost my mother. Some\nhours before her death she called me to her bedside. \"My daughter,\"\nshe said, in the presence of the missionary who was consoling her last\nmoments, \"you know the vow I made for you. Would you belie your mother?\nO my Atala, I am leaving you in a world that is not worthy of possessing\na Christian--in the midst of idolators who persecute the God of your\nfather and of your mother, the God who, after having given you life, has\npreserved it to you by a miracle. Ah, my dear child, by accepting the\nvirgin's veil, you only renounce the cares of the cabin and the fatal\npassions which have tormented your mother's breast! Come, then, my\nwell-beloved, come; swear upon this image of the Saviour's Mother, held\nby the hands of this holy priest and of your dying parent, that you will\nnot betray me in the face of heaven. Remember what I promised for you\nin order to save your life, and that, if you do not keep my promise, you\nwill plunge your mother's soul into eternal tortures.\"\n\n\"'O my mother, why spake you thus? O Religion, the cause of my ills and\nof my felicity, my ruin and my consolation at the same time! And you,\ndear and sad object of a passion that is consuming me even in the arms\nof death, you can now see, O Chactas, what has caused the hardship of\nour destiny! Melting into tears, and throwing myself upon my mother's\nbosom, I promised all that I was asked to promise. The missionary\npronounced over me the fearful language of my oath, and gave me the\nscapulary that bound me forever. My mother threatened me with her\nmalediction if ever I broke my vow; and, after having advised me to keep\nthe secret inviolably from the pagans, the persecutors of my religion,\nshe expired, whilst holding me in a tender embrace.\n\n[Illustration: 069]\n\n[Illustration: 071]\n\n[Illustration: 073]\n\n[Illustration: 075]\n\n\"'I did not at first know the danger of my oath. Full of ardor and a\nveritable Christian, proud, too, of the Spanish blood that flowed in my\nveins, I saw myself surrounded by men unworthy of receiving my hand, and\nI congratulated myself upon having no other spouse than the God of my\nmother. I saw you, young and beautiful prisoner; I pitied your lot; I\nhad the courage to speak to you at the funeral pile in the forest. Then\nit was that I felt the weight of my vows!'\n\n\"When Atala had finished littering these words, I cried out, with\nclenched fists, and looking at the missionary with a threatening air,\n'This, then, is the religion you have so much vaunted to me! Perish the\noath that deprives me of Atala! Man-priest, why did you come into these\nforests?'\n\n'\"To save you,' said the old man, in a terrible voice; 'to conquer\nyour passions, and to prevent you, blasphemer, from drawing down upon\nyourself the wrath of Heaven! It is becoming, indeed, for so young a\nman, scarcely entered upon life, to complain of his griefs! Where are\nthe marks of your sufferings? Where are the acts of injustice you have\nhad to support? Where are your virtues, which alone could give you a\ncertain right to murmur? What services have you rendered? What good have\nyou done? What, miserable creature! you can only show me passions,\nand you dare to accuse Heaven! When, like Father Aubry, you shall have\npassed thirty years in exile upon the mountains, you will be less prompt\nto judge of the designs of Providence. You will then understand that\nyou know nothing and are nothing, and that there is no chastisement\nso severe, no misfortune so terrible, that our corrupt flesh does not\ndeserve to suffer.'\n\n\"The lightnings that flashed from the old man's eyes, the beatings of\nhis beard against his breast, and his fiery language, made him like to\na god. Overcome by his majesty, I fell at the father's knees, and asked\npardon for my anger. 'My son,' he replied, in a tone so mild that\na feeling of remorse entered my soul, 'it was not for myself that I\nreprimanded you. Alas! you are right, my dear child: I have done but\nvery little in these forests, and God has no servant more unworthy than\nmyself. But, my son, it is Heaven--Heaven, I say--that should never be\naccused! Pardon me if I have offended you, and let us listen to your\nsister. There may still perhaps be some remedy; do not let us tire\nof hoping. Chactas, the religion which has made a virtue of hope is a\nDivine religion!'\n\n\"'My young friend,' resumed Atala, 'you have been a witness of my\nstruggles, and nevertheless you have seen but the smallest portion of\nthem. I concealed the rest from you. No; the black slave who moistens\nthe hot sands of the Floridas with his sweat is less miserable than\nAtala has been. Urging you to flight, and yet certain to die if you left\nme; fearful of flying with you to the desert, and still panting after\nthe shade of the woods--ah! if it had only been required of me to\nabandon my relations, my friends, my country! if even (frightful\nthought!) I should only have incurred the loss of my soul! But thy\nshadow, O my mother! thy shadow was always there, reminding me of thy\ntortures! I heard thy complaints; I saw the flames of hell consuming\nthee. My nights were barren, and haunted by phantoms, my days were\ndisconsolate; the evening dew dried as it fell upon my burning skin; I\nopened my lips to the breezes, and the breezes, far from refreshing me,\nbecame heated with the fire of my breath. What torture it was for me,\nChactas, to see you constantly near me, far from all mankind, in the\ndepths of the solitude, and to feel that there was an invincible barrier\nbetween you and myself! To have passed my life at your feet, to have\nwaited upon you like a slave, to have prepared your repasts and your\ncouch in some unknown corner of the universe, would have been for me\nsupreme happiness. That happiness was within my reach, yet I could not\nenjoy it. What plans I have imagined! What dreams have passed through\nthis sad heart of mine! Occasionally, when I fixed my eyes upon you, I\nwent so far as to encourage desires that were as foolish as they were\nculpable: sometimes I wished I were the only creature living with you\nupon the earth: at other times, feeling a divinity that stopped me in\nmy horrible transports, I seemed to desire that that divinity might\nbe annihilated, provided that, pressed in your arms, I might roll from\nabyss to abyss with the ruins of God and of the world! Even now--shall I\nsay it?--now that eternity is about to swallow me up, that I am going to\nappear before the inexorable Judge; at the moment when, from obedience\nto my mother, I see with joy my vow devouring my life; well, even now,\nby a frightful contradiction, I carry away with me the regret of not\nhaving been yours----'\n\n\"'My daughter,' interrupted the missionary, 'your grief misleads you.\nThe excess of passion to which you are abandoning yourself is rarely\njust; it is not even natural; and for that reason it is less culpable in\nthe eyes of God, because it is rather an error of the mind than a vice\nof the heart. You must therefore put away such passionate feelings,\nwhich are unworthy of your innocence. At the same time, my dear child;\nyour impetuous imagination has alarmed you too much concerning your\nvows. Religion requires no superhuman sacrifice. Its true sentiments,\nits moderated virtues, are far above the exalted sentiments and the\nforced virtues of a pretending heroism. If you had succumbed--well, poor\nlost sheep! the Good Shepherd would have sought for you, and would have\nbrought you back to the flock. The treasures of repentance were open to\nyou; torrents of blood are required to wipe out our faults in the\neyes of men; a single tear suffices with God. Tranquilize yourself,\ntherefore, my dear daughter; your situation needs calm. Let us address\nourselves to God, who heals all the wounds of His servants. If it be\nHis will, as I trust it may be, that you escape from this malady, I will\nwrite to the Bishop of Quebec; he has the power to release you from your\nvows, which are but simple vows; and you shall finish your days near me,\nwith Chactas as your spouse.'\n\n\"As the old man finished speaking, Atala was seized with a violent\nconvulsion, from which she emerged with all the signs of fearful\nsuffering. 'What!' said she, joining her two hands with passion,\n'there was a remedy! I could have been released from my vows!' 'Yes, my\ndaughter,'replied the father; 'and it is still time.' 'It is too late it\nis too late!' she cried.\n\n'Must I die at the moment when I learn that I might have been happy? Why\ndid I not know * this old man sooner? At present what happiness should I\nbe enjoying with you, with my Chactas, a Christian--consoled, comforted\nby this august priest--in this desert--for ever--Oh! my felicity would\nhave been too great!' 'Calm yourself,' I said to her, taking hold of\none of the unfortunate maiden's hands; 'calm yourself: that happiness is\nstill in store for us.' 'Never! never!' said Atala. 'How?' I asked. 'You\ndo not know all,' cried the maiden. 'Yesterday--during the storm--I was\non the point of breaking my vows; I was going to plunge my mother into\nthe flames of the abyss. Already her malediction was upon me, already\nI lied to the God who had saved my life. Whilst you were kissing my\ntrembling lips, you were not aware that you were embracing death!' 'O\nheaven!' cried the missionary; 'dear child, what have you done?' 'A\ncrime, my father,' said Atala, with her eyes wandering; 'but I only\ndestroyed myself, and I saved my mother.' 'Finish then!' I exclaimed,\nfull of fear. 'Well,' she said, 'I had foreseen my weakness; and on\nquitting the cabins I took away with me----'\n\n'What?' I interrupted with horror. 'A poison?' said the father. 'It is\nnow at my heart,' cried Atala.\n\n\"The torch slipped from the hermit's hand. I fell fainting near Lopez's\ndaughter. The old man took each of us in his arms, and during a short\ninterval we all three mingled our sobs on the funeral couch.\n\n\"'Let us be stirring; let us be stirring,' said the courageous father,\nas he rose to light a lamp. 'We are losing precious moments: like\nintrepid Christians, let us brave the assaults of adversity; with\nthe cord about our necks, and with ashes upon our heads, let us throw\nourselves at the feet of the Most High, to implore His clemency, and\nto submit ourselves to His decrees. Perhaps it may still be time. My\ndaughter, you ought to have told me of this last night.'\n\n\"'Alas! my father,' said Atala, 'I looked for you last night; but\nheaven, as a punishment for my faults, kept you away from me. Besides,\nall help would have been useless; for even the Indians themselves, who\nare so clever in what concerns poisons, know no remedy for that I have\ntaken. O Chactas, judge of my astonishment when I found that the result\nwas not so prompt as I had expected! My love redoubled my strength, and\nmy soul was unwilling to separate thus quickly from you!'\n\n\"It was no longer by sobs that I now interrupted Atala's recital, but\nby a torrent of passionate transports known only to savages. I rolled\nmyself upon the ground, twisting my arms and biting my hands. The\nold priest, with wonderful tenderness, ran from brother to sister,\nendeavoring to relieve us in a thousand ways. Through the calmness of\nhis heartland from the experience due to his weight of years, he knew\nhow to act upon our youth, and his religion furnished him with accents\neven more tender and more ardent than our passions. Does not this\npriest, who had passed forty years of daily sacrifice in the service of\nGod and man upon the mountain, remind you of the holocausts of Israel\nsmoking perpetually on the high places before the Lord?\n\n\"Alas! it was in vain that he tried to procure a remedy for Atala's\nsufferings. Fatigue, grief, poison, and a passion more mortal than all\nthe poisons together, had united to snatch the flower from the desert.\nTowards evening terrible symptoms began to show themselves. A general\nnumbness took possession of Atala's limbs, and the extremities of her\nbody became cold. 'Touch my fingers,' she said to me; 'do they not feel\nquite icy?' I could not reply. I was overcome with horror. Afterwards\nshe added, 'Even yesterday, my well-beloved, your contact made me\nquiver: and now I can no longer feel your hand; I scarcely hear your\nvoice, and the objects in the grotto are disappearing from my sight\none after the other. Are not the birds singing? The sun must be nearly\nsetting? Chactas, its rays will be very beautiful in the desert, over my\ntomb!'\n\n\"Atala perceiving that her language had melted us into tears, said\nsoftly, 'Pardon me, my kind friends; I am very weak, but perhaps I shall\nget stronger. And yet to die so young, all at once, when my heart was so\nfull of life! Chief of prayer, take pity on me; support me. Do you\nthink my mother will be satisfied, and that God will forgive what I have\ndone?'\n\n\"'My daughter,' replied the holy man, shedding tears, and wiping them\naway with his trembling, mutilated fingers, 'all your misfortunes are\nthe result of your ignorance. Your savage education and the want of\ninstruction have been your ruin. You did not know that a Christian\ncannot dispose of his life. Console yourself, therefore, my dear lamb;\nGod will pardon you, on account of the simplicity of your heart. Your\nmother, and the imprudent missionary who guided her, are more to be\nblamed than you; they exceeded their power in imposing an indiscreet vow\nupon you: but may the Lord be with them! You all three offer a terrible\nexample of the dangers of enthusiasm, and of the want of enlightenment\non religious matters. Be of good cheer, my child; He who fathoms our\nthoughts and our hearts will judge you according to your intentions,\nwhich were pure, and not from your action, which was condemnable.\n\n\"'As for life, if the moment has come for you to sleep in the Lord,\nah! my child, you lose but little by losing this world! In spite of the\nsolitude in which you have lived, you have known sorrow; what would\nyou have felt, then, if you had witnessed the evils of society?--if, on\nvisiting the shores of Europe, your ear had been stricken by the long\ncry of suffering heard throughout that old land? The dweller in the\ncabin, the inhabitant of a palace, both suffer and groan here below:\nqueens have been seen to cry like simple women, and people have been\nastonished at the quantity of tears shed by kings!\n\n\"'Is it your love that you regret? My daughter, you might as well weep\nover a dream. Do you know the heart of man, and could you reckon upon\nthe inconstancies of his affection? Sacrifices and kindnesses, Atala,\nare not eternal ties. One day, perhaps, disgust would have come with\nsatiety, the past would have been considered as nothing, and naught\nwould have remained but the inconveniences of a poor and despised union.\nDoubtless, my dear daughter, the most beautiful loves were those of the\nman and woman who issued from the hand of the Creator. A paradise had\nbeen prepared for them. They were innocent and immortal. Perfect in soul\nand body, they suited each other in every respect. Eve had been created\nfor Adam, l and Adam for Eve. If they, nevertheless, could not remain in\nthat state of happiness, what couple after them could do so? I will\nnot speak to you of the marriages of the first-born of men, of\nthose ineffable unions between sister and brother, in which love and\nfriendship were confounded in the same heart, and the purity of the one\nincreased the delights of the other. All those unions were troubled;\njealousy crept over the altar of turf upon which the goat was\nsacrificed, it existed beneath the tent of Abraham, and even in the\nabodes of the patriarchs, where they experienced so much joy that they\nforgot the death of their mothers.\n\n\"'Do you suppose, then, my child, that you are more innocent and more\nfortunate in your ties than those holy families from which Jesus Christ\ndeigned to descend? Again, woman renews her sufferings each time she\nbecomes a mother, and she weeps on her marriage-day. What grief there\nis for her in the mere loss of her new-born babe, to whom she gave\nnourishment, and who dies upon her bosom! The mountain was full of\ngroans: nothing could console Rachel for the loss of her sons. The\nbitterness attendant upon human affections is so powerful that I have in\nmy country seen grand ladies, the beloved of kings, quit the life of\na court to bury themselves in a cloister, and mutilate that rebellious\nflesh, the pleasures of which are only the precursors of sorrow.\n\n\"'But perhaps you would say that these last examples do not affect you;\nthat all your ambition was limited to the desire of living in an obscure\ncabin with the man of your choice; that you sought less after the sweets\nof marriage than after the charms of that folly which youth calls love?\nDelusion, chimera, vanity--the dream of a diseased imagination! I also,\nmy daughter, have known the troubles of the heart. This head has not\nbeen always bald, nor this breast always so calm as it appears to you\nto-day. Believe in my experience: if man, constant in his affections,\ncould unceasingly respond to a sentiment constantly renewed, solitude\nand love would doubtless render him the equal of God Himself; for those\nare the two eternal pleasures of the Great Being. But the soul of man\nbecomes weary, and never loves the same object long and fully. There are\nalways some points upon which two hearts do not agree, and in the end\nthose points suffice to render life insupportable.\n\n\"'Finally, my dear child, the great error of men, in their dream of\nhappiness, is that they forget the infirmity of death inseparable from\ntheir nature; the end must come. Sooner or later, whatever might have\nbeen your felicity, your beautiful visage would have been changed into\nthat uniform face which the sepulchre gives to the family of Adam. Even\nthe eye of Chactas would not have been able to distinguish you from\namongst your sisters of the tomb. Love does not extend its empire so far\nas the worms in the coffin. What have I to say (O vanity of vanities!),\nwhat can I say concerning the durability of earthly friendships? Would\nyou, my dear daughter, know its extent? If a man were to return to light\nsome years after his death, I do not believe he would be received with\njoy even by those who had shed the most tears to his memory; so quickly\nare new ties contracted, so easily fresh habits are indulged in, so\nentirely is inconstancy natural to man, and so little is our life even\nin the hearts of our friends!\n\n\"'Thank, therefore, the Divine goodness, my dear daughter, for taking\nyou away thus early from this valley of misery. Already the white robe\nand the brilliant crown of virgins are being prepared for you in the\nskies; already I hear the Queen of the Angels crying out to you, \"Come,\nmy worthy servant; come, my dove; come and sit down upon the throne of\ncandor, amidst all those maidens who have sacrificed their beauty and\ntheir youth in the service of humanity, in the education of children,\nand in works of penitence.\"'\n\n\"As the last ray of daylight stills the winds and spreads tranquillity\nthrough the sky, so the old man's calm language appeased the passions in\nthe bosom of my lover. She no longer thought of anything but my grief,\nand of the means for enabling me to support her loss. At first she said\nthat she should die happy if I would promise her to dry my tears;\nthen she spoke to me of my mother and of my country, and endeavored\nto distract me from present grief by referring to past sufferings. She\nexhorted me to patience and virtue. 'You will not always be unhappy,'\nshe said; 'if Heaven tries you to-day, it is merely to render you more\ncompassionate for the ills of others. The heart, Chactas, is like those\ntrees that only yield their balm for healing men's wounds after having\nbeen themselves seared with iron.'\n\n\"When she had thus spoken, Atala turned towards the missionary, seeking\nfrom him the consolation she had been endeavoring to impart to me; and,\nby turns consoling and consoled, she gave and received the word of life;\nupon the couch of death.\n\n\"Nevertheless, the hermit redoubled his zeal. With the torch of religion\nin his hand, he appeared to be guiding Atala to the tomb, to show her\nits secret wonders. The humble grotto was full of the grandeur of this\nChristian agony, and the heavenly spirits were no doubt attentive to the\nscene, in which Religion had to struggle alone against Love, Youth and\nDeath.\n\n\"Divine Religion triumphed, and her victory was perceptible from the\nholy sadness that followed our hearts' previous passionate transports.\nTowards the middle of the night, Atala seemed to revive, and repeated\nthe prayers pronounced by the monk at the side of her couch. Shortly\nafterwards, she offered me her hand, and, in a voice scarcely audible,\nsaid, 'Son of Outalissi, do you remember the night when you took me for\nthe Virgin of the Last Loves? What a singular omen of our destiny! She\nstopped, then continued: 'When I think that I am leaving you for ever,\nmy heart makes such an effort to live, that I feel almost strong enough\nto render myself immortal by the power of my love. But, O God! Thy will\nbe done!' Atala became silent during a few instants; then she added: 'It\nonly remains for me to ask your pardon for all the ills I have caused\nyou. Chactas, a little earth thrown upon my body will place a world\nbetween you and me, and will deliver you forever from the weight of my\ncalamities!'\n\n\"'Pardon you!' I exclaimed, drowned in tears; 'Is it not I who have\ncaused all your misfortunes?' 'My friend,' she replied, interrupting\nme, 'you have rendered me very happy, and if I had to begin my life over\nagain, I should still prefer the happiness of having loved you for a few\nshort moments in an exile of adversity to an entire life of repose in my\nown country.'\n\n[Illustration: 084]\n\n\"Here Atala's voice languished: the shadows of death spread themselves\nabout her eyes and her mouth; her wandering fingers endeavored to catch\nat something and she spoke lowly with the invisible spirits. Soon,\nhowever, making an effort, she attempted, but in vain, to take the\nlittle crucifix from her neck; she asked me to untie it myself, and then\nsaid to me:--\n\n[Illustration: 088]\n\n\"'When I spoke to you for the first time, by the light of the fire you\nsaw this cross shining upon my bosom; it is the only treasure that Atala\npossesses. Lopez, your father and mine, sent it to my mother a few days\nafter my birth. Accept the inheritance, then, from me, my brother, and\nkeep it in remembrance of my misfortunes. Chactas, I have a last request\nto make of you. Our union on earth, my friend, would have been short;\nbut after this life there is a longer life. I only go before you to-day,\nand I will wait for you in the celestial empire. If you have loved me,\nget yourself instructed in the Christian religion, which will prepare\nour re-union. That religion has worked a great miracle under your own\neyes, since it enables me to quit you without the anguish of despair.\nStill, Chactas, I only desire you to make me a simple promise. I know\ntoo well what it costs to ask an oath from you. Perhaps such a vow might\nseparate you from some woman happier than I. O my mother, pardon thy\ndaughter! I am again succumbing to my weaknesses, and am turning aside\nfrom Thee, O my God, thoughts that should be thine, and thine only!'\n\n\"Overwhelmed with grief, I promised Atala that I would one day embrace\nthe Christian religion. At this moment the hermit, rising with an\ninspired air, and stretching his arms towards the roof of the grotto,\nexclaimed, 'It is time--it is time to call God hither!'\n\n\"Scarcely had he uttered those words, when a supernatural force\nconstrained me to fall upon my knees and to turn my head towards the\nfoot of Atala's couch. The priest opened a secret place that contained\na golden urn covered with a silk veil; he then knelt down and prayed\nfervently. Suddenly the grotto appeared to be illuminated: songs of\nangels and the vibrations of celestial harps were heard in the air; and\nwhen the hermit drew the sacred vessel from the tabernacle, I thought I\nsaw God Himself issue forth from the side of the mountain.\n\n\"The priest opened the cup, took between his fingers a wafer white as\nsnow, and approached Atala as he pronounced some mysterious words. That\nsaint's eyes were upturned in ecstacy. All her sufferings appeared to be\nsuspended; her entire being concentrated itself upon her mouth; her lips\nparted, and advanced with respect to seek the God concealed beneath the\nmystic bread. The saintly old man afterwards soaked a piece of cotton in\nthe consecrated oil, and looked for a moment at the dying maiden; when\nall of a sudden he uttered these imposing words, 'Go, Christian soul,\ngo; return to your Creator!' Raising then my downcast head, I cried,\nlooking at the vessel that contained the holy oil, 'My father, will that\nremedy restore Atala to life?' 'Yes, my son,' said the old man, falling\ninto my arms, 'to life eternal!' Atala had just expired.\n\nAt this point Chactas was obliged, for the second time, to interrupt the\nrecital of his story. His tears flowed copiously, and the tremor of his\nvoice only permitted him to utter broken words. The blind sachem opened\nhis breast and drew forth Atala's crucifix. \"Here it is!\" he cried;\n\"dear token of adversity! O Ren\u00c3\u00a9, O my son! You see it; but I can see it\nno longer.\n\nTell me whether, after so many years, the gold of it is tarnished? Do\nyou see any traces of my tears upon it? Could you recognize the part\nwhich had been touched by the lips of a saint? How is it that Chactas is\nnot yet a Christian? What trivial motives of policy or nationality have\nkept him in the errors of his fathers? No; I will no longer delay. The\nearth is crying out to me, 'When, then, wilt thou go down into the tomb,\nand for what art thou waiting to embrace a Divine religion?'.... Earth!\nthou shalt not wait long, for as soon as a priest shall have regenerated\nby baptism this head whitened with grief, I hope to be re-united to\nAtala.... But let me finish what remains to be told of my story.\"\n\n[Illustration: 091]\n\n[Illustration: 092]\n\n[Illustration: 094]\n\n[Illustration: 096]\n\nI V. THE FUNERAL\n\n[Illustration: 098]\n\n\"I will not undertake, Ren\u00c3\u00a9, to picture the despair that took possession\nof my soul when Atala had heaved her last sigh. It would require more\nwarmth than I have left, and that my closed eyes might re-open to the\nsun, to ask it to tell of the tears they shed in its light. Yes, the\nmoon now shining above our heads will become weary of lighting the\nsolitudes of Kentucky--the river that is now bearing our pirogues will\nsuspend the course of its waters--before my tears cease to flow for\nAtala! During two days I was insensible to the hermit's conversation.\nIn trying to calm my grief, the excellent man did not employ the\ncommonplace reasonings of earthly minds. All he said was, 'My son, it\nis the will of God;' and then he pressed me in his arms. I should never\nhave thought there was so much consolation in those few words of a\nresigned Christian, if I had not myself experienced it.\n\n\"The mild tenderness and the unvarying patience of the old servant of\nGod at length conquered the obstinacy of my grief; I became ashamed of\nthe tears I caused him to shed. 'My father,' I said, 'this is too\nmuch: let the passions of a young man disturb the peace of your days no\nlonger. Permit me to carry away the remains of my spouse; I will inter\nthem in some corner of the desert; and if I am condemned to live on for\na time, I will endeavor to render myself worthy of the eternal nuptials\nthat were promised me by Atala.'\n\n\"At this unexpected return of courage, the good father trembled with\njoy, saying, 'O blood of Jesus Christ, blood of my Divine Master, I\nacknowledge herein Thy merits! Thou wilt no doubt save this young man.\nMy God, finish Thy work; restore peace to this troubled soul, and leave\nit but the humble and useful remembrances of its misfortunes!'\n\n\"The righteous man refused to give up to me the body of Lopez's\ndaughter; but he proposed to call together his neophytes, and to inter\nit with all the pomp of the Christian ceremonial. In my turn, I refused.\n'Atala's misfortunes and virtues,' I said, 'were unknown to men; let her\ngrave, dug secretly by our hands, share that obscurity.' We agreed to\nset off the next morning at sunrise, and to bury Atala beneath the arch\nof the natural bridge at the entrance to the Groves of Death. It was\nalso decided that we should pass the night in prayer near the corpse of\nthe saint.\n\n\"Towards evening we transported the precious remains to an opening of\nthe grotto looking to the north. The hermit had enveloped them in a\npiece of European lawn, woven by his mother. It was the only thing still\nremaining to him of his country, and he had long preserved it for his\nown tomb. We laid Atala upon a turf of mountain-sensitives; her feet,\nher head, her shoulders, and a part of her bosom were uncovered. There\nwas a faded magnolia in her hair, the same flower I had placed upon\nthe virgin's couch to render her fruitful. Her lips, like a rose-bud\ngathered two mornings before, seemed to languish and smile. Her cheeks,\nof sparkling whiteness, showed a number of blue veins. Her beautiful\neyes were closed, her modest feet joined together, and her hands of\nalabaster pressed against her heart an ebony crucifix; the scapulary of\nher vows was fastened about her neck. She appeared as though enchanted\nby the angel of melancholy, and by the double sleep of innocence and of\nthe tomb.\n\nI never saw anything so heavenly. By a person unconscious that this\nyoung girl had enjoyed the light, she might have been taken for a statue\nof Sleeping Virginity.\n\n\"The monk did not cease praying all night. I sat in silence at the end\nof my Atala's funeral couch. How often, during her sleep, I had held\nthat charming head upon my knees! How many times I had leaned over her\nto hear her breathe, and to inhale her breath! But at present no sound\nissued from that motionless breast, and it was in vain that I looked for\nthe awakening of my love!\n\n\"The moon lent her pale light to this funereal watching; she rose in the\nmiddle of the night, like a white vestal come to weep over the coffin of\na companion. From time to time the monk dipped a flowering branch into\nthe holy water, and shaking its moistened leaves, perfumed the night air\nwith heavenly balms. Occasionally also he repeated, to an ancient tune,\nthese verses by an old poet named Job:\n\n[Illustration: 100]\n\n\"'I have passed away like a flower; I have withered like the grass of\nthe fields.\n\n\"'Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the\nbitter in soul?'\n\n\"Thus sang the old man. His deep and irregular voice went rolling\nthrough the silence of the desert. The name of God and of the tomb\nissued from all the echoes, from all the torrents, and from all the\nforests, and the Groves of Death seemed to be murmuring a distant chorus\nof the departed in reply to the hermit's sacred chant.\n\n\"Nevertheless, a bar of gold was forming in the east. The sparrow-hawks\nwere crying upon the rocks, and the martins creeping back into the\nhollows of the elm-trees: these were so many signs that the time had\ncome for Atala's interment. I took the body on my shoulders; the hermit\nwalked in front of me, carrying a spade in his hand. We commenced the\ndescent from rock to rock; old age and death combined equally to slacken\nour pace. At the sight of the dog which had found us in the forest,\nand which now, jumping with joy, led us by another route, I melted\ninto tears. Atala's long hair, the plaything of the morning breezes,\nfrequently threw its golden veil over my eyes, and, bending beneath\nthe burden, I was obliged to lay it down often upon the moss, and\nsit awhile, to recover my strength. At length we arrived at the spot\nselected by my grief, and we entered beneath the arch of the bridge. O\nmy son, you should have seen the youthful savage and the old hermit, on\ntheir knees in front of each other, in the desert, digging with their\nhands a grave for the poor girl whose body lay stretched out close at\nhand, in the dried-up bed of a torrent!\n\n\"When our work was terminated, we transported the loved one into her bed\nof clay. Taking then a little dust in my hand, and observing a fearful\nsilence, I looked upon Atala's face for the last time. I afterwards\nspread the earth over that forehead of eighteen springs; gradually I\nsaw the features of my sister disappear, and her graces become hidden\nbeneath the curtain of eternity. 'Lopez!' I exclaimed, 'behold your son\nburying your daughter!' And I finished by covering Atala entirely with\nthe earth of sleep.\n\n\"We returned to the grotto, where I made the missionary acquainted\nwith the project I had formed of remaining with him. The saint, who\nwonderfully understood the heart of man, penetrated my thought and the\nartfulness of my grief. He said: 'Chactas, son of Outalissi, so long as\nAtala was alive, I myself desired that you should live with me; but at\npresent your lot is changed; you owe yourself to your country. Believe\nme, my son, such griefs are not eternal. Sooner or later they wear\nthemselves out, because the heart of man is finite. That is one of our\ngreat miseries; we are not even capable of being unhappy for a long\ntime. Return to the Mississippi; go and console your mother, who weeps\nfor you day by day, and who stands in need of your support. Get yourself\ninstructed in Atala's religion, whenever an opportunity presents itself;\nand remember that you promised her to be virtuous and Christian. I will\nwatch over her tomb. Go, my son; God, your sister's soul, and the heart\nof your old friend, will follow you!'\n\n\"Such was the language of the man of the rock. His authority was too\ngreat, his wisdom too profound, not to be obeyed. The next morning I\nquitted my venerable host, who, pressing me to his heart, gave me his\nlast counsels, his last blessing, and his last tears. I went to the\ngrave, and was surprised at finding a little cross placed over the\nbody, as one may sometimes perceive the mast of a vessel that has been\nwrecked. I judged that the hermit had been there to pray during the\nnight. This mark of friendship and religion caused me to shed an\nabundance of tears. I was almost tempted to re-open the tomb, in order\nto gaze once more upon my well-beloved; a religious fear withheld me. I\nsat down upon the recently-disturbed ground. With an elbow resting upon\nmy knees, and my head supported by my hand, I remained buried for a time\nin a most bitter reverie. O Ren\u00c3\u00a9! it was then that, for the first time,\nI made serious reflections upon the vanity of our days, and the still\ngreater vanity of our projects. Ah! my child, who has not made such\nreflections? I am no longer but an old stag whitened by the winters; my\nyears compete with those of the crow. Well, in spite of the number of\ndays accumulated over my head, in spite of such a long experience of\nlife, I have not yet met with a man who had not been deceived in his\ndreams of happiness, nor a heart that did not contain a hidden wound.\n\n\"Having thus seen the sun rise and set upon this place of grief, the\nnext day, at the first cry of the stork, I prepared to leave the sacred\nsepulchre. I quitted it as the spot from which I desired to start upon\na career of virtue. Three times I evoked the soul of Atala; three times\nthe genius of the desert responded to my cries beneath the funeral\narch. I afterwards saluted the East, and then I perceived, amongst the\nmountain paths in the distance, the friendly hermit going to the cabin\nof some unhappy creature. Falling upon my knees, and ardently embracing\nAtala's grave, I exclaimed, 'Sleep in peace in this foreign land, too\nunfortunate maiden! In return for your love, for your exile, and for\nyour death, you are going to be abandoned, even by Chactas!' Then,\nshedding a flood of tears, I separated from Lopez's daughter, and,\ntearing myself from the spot, left at the foot of nature's monument a\nmonument still more august--the humble Tomb of Virtue.\"\n\n[Illustration: 103\n\n[Illustration: 104]\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE.\n\n[Illustration: 107]\n\nChactas, son of Outalissi the Natchez, related this story to Ren\u00c3\u00a9 the\nEuropean. Fathers have repeated it to their sons; and I, a traveller to\ndistant lands, have faithfully narrated what the Indians told me. I\nsaw in this story the picture of the hunting people and of the laboring\npeople; religion, the first lawgiver of men; the dangers of ignorance\nand religious enthusiasm opposed to the light, the charity and the\nveritable spirit of the Evangile; the struggles of the passions and the\nvirtues in a simple heart; and, finally, the triumph of Christianity\nover the most ardent sentiment and the most terrible fear--Love and\nDeath.\n\nWhen a Seminole related this story to me, I found it very instructive\nand perfectly beautiful, because he narrated it with the flowery\neloquence of the desert, the grace of the cabin, and a simplicity in\ndescribing grief which I am afraid I have not been able to preserve. But\none thing remained for me to learn. I wished to know what had become of\nFather Aubry, and no one could tell me. I should never have ascertained\nif Providence, who guides all, had not led me to discover what I was\nseeking. This is how the matter came about.\n\nI had visited the shores of the Mississippi, which formerly constituted\nthe southern boundary of New France, and I was desirous of seeing, in\nthe north, that other wonder of the American empire, the cataract of\nNiagara. I had nearly reached the falls, in the ancient country of the\nAgannonsioni, * when one morning, as I was crossing a plain, I perceived\na woman seated beneath a tree, and holding a dead child upon her knees.\nI quietly approached the young mother, and heard her singing to this\neffect:--\n\n\"If thou hadst remained amongst us, dear babe, with what grace thy hand\nmight have bent the bow! Thy arm might have tamed the furious bear,\nand thy steps might have outrun the flying kid on the summit of the\nmountain. White ermine of the rock, to go so young to the land of souls!\nHow wilt thou manage to live there? Thy father is not there to feed thee\nwith the produce of his chase. Thou wilt be cold, and no Spirit will\ngive thee skins to cover thyself. Oh! I must hasten to rejoin thee, to\nsing songs to thee and to give thee my breast.\" And the young mother\nsang with a trembling voice, rocked the child upon her knees, wetted its\nlips with her maternal milk, and bestowed upon the dead all those cares\nwhich are usually given to the living.\n\nAccording to the Indian custom, the woman desired to dry the body of her\nson upon the branches of a tree before taking it away to the tomb of\nits ancestors. She therefore undressed the new-born babe, and, after\nbreathing some instants upon its mouth, uncovered its breast, and\nembraced the icy remains, which would certainly have been re-animated by\nthe fire of that maternal heart, if God had not reserved to Himself the\nbreath that imparts life.\n\nShe rose, and looked about for a tree upon which she might lay her\nchild. She selected a maple with red flowers, festooned with garlands of\napios, that emitted the sweetest perfumes. With one hand she pulled down\nthe lowest branch, and with the other she placed the body thereon;\nthen loosing the branch, it returned to its natural position, with the\nremains of innocence concealed in its ordoriforous foliage. Oh, how\ntouching is this Indian custom! Pompous monuments of the Crassi and\nof the C\u00c3\u00a6sars, I have seen you in your desolated plains; but I by far\nprefer those a\u00c3\u00abrian tombs of the savages, those mausoleums of flowers\nand verdure, perfumed by the bee and waved by the zephyr, wherein the\nnightingale builds its nest and warbles its plaintive melody. When the\nmortal remains are those of a young maiden suspended by the hand of\na lover to the tree of death, or of a beloved child placed by a fond\nmother in the dwelling of the little birds, the charm is still greater.\nI approached her who was groaning at the foot of the maple-tree, and\nplaced my hands upon her head as I uttered the three cries of grief.\nAfterwards, without speaking to the young mother, I imitated her by\ntaking a bough and driving away the insects that were buzzing about the\nchild's body. But I was careful not to disturb a neighboring dove. The\nIndian woman said to it: \"Dove, if thou art not the soul of my departed\nson, thou art doubtless a mother seeking for something to make a nest.\nTake these hairs, which I shall no more wash in scented water; take them\nfor a bed for thy little ones, and may the Great Spirit preserve them to\nthee!\"\n\n     * The Iroquois,\n\nNevertheless, the mother wept with joy on remarking the stranger's\npoliteness. As we were thus occupied, a young man came up and said,\n\"Daughter of C\u00c3\u00a9luta, take down our child: we will no longer sojourn in\nthis place; we will set off at the rising of the next sun.\" I then said,\n\"Brother, I wish you a blue sky, plenty of game, a beaver cloak, and\nhope! You are not of the desert, then?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the young man; \"we are exiles, and we are going to seek a\ncountry.\" Saying that, the warrior lowered his head upon his breast, and\nbegan knocking off the heads of some flowers with the end of his bow.\nI saw that there were tears at the bottom of this story, so I remained\nsilent. The mother took her son's body down from the branch of the tree,\nand gave it to her spouse to carry. I then said, \"Will you allow me to\nlight your fire to-night?\"\n\n\"We have no cottage,\" replied the warrior; \"but if you desire to follow\nus, we are going to camp on the border of the Falls.\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" I replied; and we started off together.\n\nWe soon arrived at the border of the cataract, which announced itself\nwith frightful roarings. It is formed by the river Niagara, which takes\nits rise in Lake Erie, and falls into Lake Ontario. Its perpendicular\nheight is one hundred and forty-four feet. From Lake Erie to the Falls,\nthe river flows with a rapid inclination; and at the leap it is less a\nriver than a sea whose torrents crush each other in the yawning mouth\nof an abyss. The cataract is divided into two branches, and bends like a\nhorse-shoe. Between the two falls there is an island, hollow underneath,\nand which hangs with all its trees over the chaos of the waves. The mass\nof the river which rushes towards the north, assumes the form of a vast\ncylinder, unrolling itself into a field of snow, and shining with every\ncolor in the sun; that which flows to the east descends into a fearful\nshade, and might be taken for a column of the water of the Deluge. A\nthousand rainbows bend and cross each other above the abyss. Striking\nagainst the shaken rock, the water rebounds in whirlwinds of froth that\nrise above the forests like smoke from a vast burning mass. Pine-trees,\nwalnut-trees, and rocks worn into fantastic forms, ornament the scene.\nEagles, carried along by the current of air, are whirled down to the\nbottom of the gulf; and carcajous, hanging by their flexible tails to\nthe ends of the fallen branches, wait to seize in the abyss the crushed\nbodies of bears and elks.\n\nWhilst I was contemplating this spectacle with a sort of pleasure mixed\nwith terror, the Indian and his spouse left me. I looked for them as I\nascended the river-side above the Falls, and soon discovered them in a\nplace suited to their grief. They were lying down upon the grass, with\na number of old men, near some human bones wrapped in bear-skins.\nAstonished at everything I had seen during the last few hours, I sat\ndown near the young mother, and said, \"What is all this, my sister?\"\nShe replied: \"My brother, the earth of our country and the ashes of our\nforefathers follow us in our exile.\"\n\n\"And how,\" I asked, \"have you been reduced to such a misfortune?\" The\ndaughter of C\u00c3\u00a9luta responded, \"We are the remains of the Natchez. After\nthe massacre of our nation by the French, to avenge their compatriots,\nthose of our brothers who escaped from the conquerors found refuge with\nour neighbors, the Chikassas. We remained tranquilly with them for some\ntime; but seven moons ago, the white men from Virginia took possession\nof our fields, affirming that they had been given to them by a king of\nEurope. So we raised our eyes to heaven, and, laden with the remains of\nour forefathers, started on our way across the desert. I was confined\nduring the march, and as my milk was bad on account of my grief, it\ncaused my child to die.\" As she spoke, the mother wiped her eyes with\nher hair. I wept also.\n\nAfter a while I said, \"My sister, let us adore the Great Spirit;\neverything happens by His command. We are all travellers; our fathers\nwere the same; but there is a place where we shall find rest. If I were\nnot afraid of my tongue being as indiscreet as that of a white man, I\nwould ask of you if you have heard speak of Chactas the Natchez.\"\n\nAt these words the Indian woman looked at me, and asked, ''Who has\nspoken to you of Chactas the Natchez? \"I replied, \"Wisdom.\" The Indian\nrejoined, \"I will tell you what I know, because you drove away the flies\nfrom the body of my son, and uttered good words concerning the Great\nSpirit. I am the daughter of the daughter of Ren\u00c3\u00a9, the European whom\nChactas had adopted. Chactas, who had received baptism, and Ren\u00c3\u00a9, my\nunfortunate grandfather, perished in the massacre.\"\n\n\"Man passes constantly from grief to grief,\" I replied, bending myself\nwith humility. \"You might also perhaps be able to give me news of Father\nAubry?\"\n\n\"He was not more fortunate than Chactas,\" said the Indian. \"The\nCherokees, who were hostile to the French, attacked his Mission. They\nwere guided thither by the sound of a bell that was rung to succor\ntravellers. Father Aubry could have escaped, but he would not abandon\nhis children, and remained to encourage them to die by his example. He\nwas burnt with great torture; but his enemies could not draw from him\na single cry that might be turned to the shame of his God or to the\ndishonor of his country. During the punishment he never ceased to pray\nfor his executioners, and to pity the lot of his fellow-victims. In\norder to compel him to betray a mark of weakness, the Cherokees led to\nhis feet a Christian savage, whom they had horribly mutilated. But they\nwere much surprised when they saw the young man go down upon his knees\nand kiss the wounds of the old hermit, who cried out to him, 'My\nchild, we have been given as a spectacle to men and to the angels.'\nThe Indians, furious at his expression, forced a red-hot iron down his\nthroat to prevent him from speaking; and thereupon, no longer able to\nconsole his fellow-creatures, he expired.\n\n\"It is said that the Cherokees, accustomed though they were to see\nsavages suffer with indifference, could not refrain from confessing that\nthere was in Father Aubry's courage something unknown to them, and which\nsurpassed every description of courage they had witnessed. Several of\nthem, struck by his remarkable death, afterwards became Christians.\n\n[Illustration: 111]\n\n\"On his return to the land of white men, several years later, Chactas,\nhaving heard of the misfortunes of the chief of prayer, went to gather\nthe Father's ashes, and those of Atala. He arrived at the spot where the\nmission had formerly existed, but he could scarcely recognize it. The\nlake was overflown, and the savannah changed into a marsh; the natural\nbridge, which had fallen in, had buried Atala's tomb and the Groves of\nDeath beneath its ruins. Chactas wandered about the place for a length\nof time: he visited the hermit's grotto, which he found full of weeds\nand raspberry-trees, and occupied by a fawn giving suck to her kid. He\nsat down upon the rock beneath which he had watched his dying Atala; but\nthere was nothing on it beyond a few feathers fallen from the wings of\nsome birds of passage.\n\n\"While he was weeping, the missionary's tamed serpent issued from the\nneighboring bushes, and came creeping to his feet. Chactas warmed in\nhis bosom the faithful friend who had remained alone in the midst of the\nruins. The son of Outalissi stated that several times, at the approach\nof night, he fancied he saw the shades of Atala and Father Aubry rise\nout of the misty twilight. These visions filled him with religious fear\nand a joyful sadness.\n\n[Illustration: 113]\n\n[Illustration: 115]\n\n\"After having sought the tomb of his sister and of the hermit in vain,\nhe was on the point of abandoning the spot, when the fawn from the\ngrotto set to leaping in front of him. She stopped at the foot of the\nMission cross. That cross was then half surrounded by water; the wood\nof it was covered with moss, and the pelican of the wilderness loved to\nperch upon its worm-eaten arms. Chactas judged that the graceful fawn\nhad led him to the tomb of his host.\n\n\"He dug below the rock that had formerly served as an altar, and there\nfound the remains of a man and woman. He had no doubt but they were\nthose of the priest and of the virgin, buried, perhaps, by the angels\nin that place; so he wrapped them in bear-skins, and started on his way\nback to his country, carrying off the precious remains, which sounded\non his shoulders like the quiver of death. At night he placed them under\nhis pillow, and had dreams of love and of virtue. O stranger! you may\nhere contemplate that dust, and also the remains of Chactas himself.\"\n\nAs the Indian finished speaking, I rose, went towards the sacred ashes,\nand prostrated myself before them in silence. I afterwards walked away\nslowly, and with long strides, saying to myself, \"Thus ends upon earth\nall that is good, virtuous and feeling! Man, thou art but a rapid\nand painful dream! Thou only existest by misfortune; and if thou art\nanything at all, it is merely by the sadness of thy soul and the eternal\nmelancholy of thy thoughts!\"\n\nI was preoccupied with such reflections all night. The next morning, at\nday-break, my hosts left me. The young warriors opened the march, and\ntheir wives closed it. The former were charged with the holy relics,\nthe latter carried their infants. The old men walked slowly in the\nmiddle--placed between their forefathers and their posterity, between\nremembrance and hope, between the lost country and the country to be\nfound.\n\nO what tears are shed when we thus abandon our native land!--when, from\nthe summit of the mountain of exile, we look for the last time upon the\nroof beneath which we were bred, and see the hut-stream still flowing\nsadly through the solitary fields surrounding our birth-place!\n\nUnfortunate Indians!--you whom I have seen wandering in the deserts\nof the New World with the ashes of your ancestors;--you who gave\nme hospitality in spite of your misery--I could not now return your\ngenerosity, for I am wandering, like you, at the mercy of men; but less\nfortunate than you in my exile, I have not brought with me the bones of\nmy fathers.\n\n[Illustration: 118]\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Atala, by Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Auguste de Chateaubriand\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ATALA ***\n\n***** This file should be named 44427-8.txt or 44427-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/4\/4\/2\/44427\/\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.  Email\ncontact links and up to date contact information can be found at the\nFoundation's web site and official page at www.gutenberg.org\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":834,"split":"train"}
