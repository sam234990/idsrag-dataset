The book chronicles life in London under German occupation and the changes that come with a foreign army's invasion and triumph. Like Robert Erskine Childers's novel The Riddle of the Sands (1903), it predicts the Great War (in which Saki would be killed) and is an example of invasion literature, a literary genre which flourished at the beginning of the 20th century as tensions between the European great powers increased.\nMuch of the book is an argument for compulsory military service, about which there was then a major controversy. The scene in which an Imperial Rescript is announced in a subjugated London, excusing the unmilitary British from serving in the Kaiser's armies, is particularly bitter. There are also several vignettes exemplifying the differences between the English and continental systems of law: for example, the moment when the hero's hostess informs him that she must register his presence under her roof with the police, and the incident in which he is fined on the spot for walking on the grass in Hyde Park. In another episode, he finds himself unintentionally but unavoidably fraternising with one of the invaders.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, When William Came, by Saki\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Both\nprospects gave her undisguised satisfaction.  Without being vain she was\nduly appreciative of good looks, whether in herself or in another, and\nthe reflection that she saw in the mirror, and the young man whom she saw\nseated at the piano, would have come with credit out of a more severely\ncritical inspection.  Probably she looked longer and with greater\nappreciation at the piano player than at her own image; her good looks\nwere an inherited possession, that had been with her more or less all her\nlife, while Ronnie Storre was a comparatively new acquisition, discovered\nand achieved, so to speak, by her own enterprise, selected by her own\ngood taste.  Fate had given her adorable eyelashes and an excellent\nprofile.  Ronnie was an indulgence she had bestowed on herself.\n\nCicely had long ago planned out for herself a complete philosophy of\nlife, and had resolutely set to work to carry her philosophy into\npractice.  \"When love is over how little of love even the lover\nunderstands,\" she quoted to herself from one of her favourite poets, and\ntransposed the saying into \"While life is with us how little of life even\nthe materialist understands.\"  Most people that she knew took endless\npains and precautions to preserve and prolong their lives and keep their\npowers of enjoyment unimpaired; few, very few, seemed to make any\nintelligent effort at understanding what they really wanted in the way of\nenjoying their lives, or to ascertain what were the best means for\nsatisfying those wants.  Fewer still bent their whole energies to the one\nparamount aim of getting what they wanted in the fullest possible\nmeasure.  Her scheme of life was not a wholly selfish one; no one could\nunderstand what she wanted as well as she did herself, therefore she felt\nthat she was the best person to pursue her own ends and cater for her own\nwants.  To have others thinking and acting for one merely meant that one\nhad to be perpetually grateful for a lot of well-meant and usually\nunsatisfactory services.  It was like the case of a rich man giving a\ncommunity a free library, when probably the community only wanted free\nfishing or reduced tram-fares.  Cicely studied her own whims and wishes,\nexperimented in the best method of carrying them into effect, compared\nthe accumulated results of her experiments, and gradually arrived at a\nvery clear idea of what she wanted in life, and how best to achieve it.\nShe was not by disposition a self-centred soul, therefore she did not\nmake the mistake of supposing that one can live successfully and\ngracefully in a crowded world without taking due notice of the other\nhuman elements around one.  She was instinctively far more thoughtful for\nothers than many a person who is genuinely but unseeingly addicted to\nunselfishness.\n\nAlso she kept in her armoury the weapon which can be so mightily\neffective if used sparingly by a really sincere individual--the knowledge\nof when to be a humbug.  Ambition entered to a certain extent into her\nlife, and governed it perhaps rather more than she knew.  She desired to\nescape from the doom of being a nonentity, but the escape would have to\nbe effected in her own way and in her own time; to be governed by\nambition was only a shade or two better than being governed by\nconvention.\n\nThe drawing-room in which she and Ronnie were sitting was of such\nproportions that one hardly knew whether it was intended to be one room\nor several, and it had the merit of being moderately cool at two o'clock\non a particularly hot July afternoon.  In the coolest of its many alcoves\nservants had noiselessly set out an improvised luncheon table: a tempting\narray of caviare, crab and mushroom salads, cold asparagus, slender hock\nbottles and high-stemmed wine goblets peeped out from amid a setting of\nCharlotte Klemm roses.\n\nCicely rose from her seat and went over to the piano.\n\n\"Come,\" she said, touching the young man lightly with a finger-tip on the\ntop of his very sleek, copper-hued head, \"we're going to have\npicnic-lunch to-day up here; it's so much cooler than any of the\ndownstairs rooms, and we shan't be bothered with the servants trotting in\nand out all the time.  Rather a good idea of mine, wasn't it?\"\n\nRonnie, after looking anxiously to see that the word \"picnic\" did not\nportend tongue sandwiches and biscuits, gave the idea his blessing.\n\n\"What is young Storre's profession?\" some one had once asked concerning\nhim.\n\n\"He has a great many friends who have independent incomes,\" had been the\nanswer.\n\nThe meal was begun in an appreciative silence; a picnic in which three\nkinds of red pepper were available for the caviare demanded a certain\namount of respectful attention.\n\n\"My heart ought to be like a singing-bird to-day, I suppose,\" said Cicely\npresently.\n\n\"Because your good man is coming home?\" asked Ronnie.\n\nCicely nodded.\n\n\"He's expected some time this afternoon, though I'm rather vague as to\nwhich train he arrives by.  Rather a stifling day for railway\ntravelling.\"\n\n\"And is your heart doing the singing-bird business?\" asked Ronnie.\n\n\"That depends,\" said Cicely, \"if I may choose the bird.  A missel-thrush\nwould do, perhaps; it sings loudest in stormy weather, I believe.\"\n\nRonnie disposed of two or three stems of asparagus before making any\ncomment on this remark.\n\n\"Is there going to be stormy weather?\" he asked.\n\n\"The domestic barometer is set rather that way,\" said Cicely.  \"You see,\nMurrey has been away for ever so long, and, of course, there will be lots\nof things he won't be used to, and I'm afraid matters may be rather\nstrained and uncomfortable for a time.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that he will object to me?\" asked Ronnie.\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said Cicely, \"he's quite broad-minded on most\nsubjects, and he realises that this is an age in which sensible people\nknow thoroughly well what they want, and are determined to get what they\nwant.  It pleases me to see a lot of you, and to spoil you and pay you\nextravagant compliments about your good looks and your music, and to\nimagine at times that I'm in danger of getting fond of you; I don't see\nany harm in it, and I don't suppose Murrey will either--in fact, I\nshouldn't be surprised if he takes rather a liking to you.  No, it's the\ngeneral situation that will trouble and exasperate him; he's not had time\nto get accustomed to the fait accompli like we have.  It will break on\nhim with horrible suddenness.\"\n\n\"He was somewhere in Russia when the war broke out, wasn't he?\" said\nRonnie.\n\n\"Somewhere in the wilds of Eastern Siberia, shooting and bird collecting,\nmiles away from a railway or telegraph line, and it was all over before\nhe knew anything about it; it didn't last very long, when you come to\nthink of it.  He was due home somewhere about that time, and when the\nweeks slipped by without my hearing from him, I quite thought he'd been\ncaptured in the Baltic or somewhere on the way back.  It turned out that\nhe was down with marsh fever in some out-of-the-way spot, and everything\nwas over and finished with before he got back to civilisation and\nnewspapers.\"\n\n\"It must have been a bit of a shock,\" said Ronnie, busy with a\nwell-devised salad; \"still, I don't see why there should be domestic\nstorms when he comes back.  You are hardly responsible for the\ncatastrophe that has happened.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Cicely, \"but he'll come back naturally feeling sore and savage\nwith everything he sees around him, and he won't realise just at once\nthat we've been through all that ourselves, and have reached the stage of\nsullen acquiescence in what can't be helped.  He won't understand, for\ninstance, how we can be enthusiastic and excited over Gorla Mustelford's\ndebut, and things of that sort; he'll think we are a set of callous\nrevellers, fiddling while Rome is burning.\"\n\n\"In this case,\" said Ronnie, \"Rome isn't burning, it's burnt.  All that\nremains to be done is to rebuild it--when possible.\"\n\n\"Exactly, and he'll say we're not doing much towards helping at that.\"\n\n\"But,\" protested Ronnie, \"the whole thing has only just happened; 'Rome\nwasn't built in a day,' and we can't rebuild our Rome in a day.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Cicely, \"but so many of our friends, and especially\nMurrey's friends, have taken the thing in a tragical fashion, and cleared\noff to the Colonies, or shut themselves up in their country houses, as\nthough there was a sort of moral leprosy infecting London.\"\n\n\"I don't see what good that does,\" said Ronnie.\n\n\"It doesn't do any good, but it's what a lot of them have done because\nthey felt like doing it, and Murrey will feel like doing it too.  That is\nwhere I foresee trouble and disagreement.\"\n\nRonnie shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I would take things tragically if I saw the good of it,\" he said; \"as\nmatters stand it's too late in the day and too early to be anything but\nphilosophical about what one can't help.  For the present we've just got\nto make the best of things.  Besides, you can't very well turn down Gorla\nat the last moment.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to turn down Gorla, or anybody,\" said Cicely with\ndecision.  \"I think it would be silly, and silliness doesn't appeal to\nme.  That is why I foresee storms on the domestic horizon.  After all,\nGorla has her career to think of.  Do you know,\" she added, with a change\nof tone, \"I rather wish you would fall in love with Gorla; it would make\nme horribly jealous, and a little jealousy is such a good tonic for any\nwoman who knows how to dress well.  Also, Ronnie, it would prove that you\nare capable of falling in love with some one, of which I've grave doubts\nup to the present.\"\n\n\"Love is one of the few things in which the make-believe is superior to\nthe genuine,\" said Ronnie, \"it lasts longer, and you get more fun out of\nit, and it's easier to replace when you've done with it.\"\n\n\"Still, it's rather like playing with coloured paper instead of playing\nwith fire,\" objected Cicely.\n\nA footman came round the corner with the trained silence that tactfully\ncontrives to make itself felt.\n\n\"Mr. Luton to see you, Madam,\" he announced, \"shall I say you are in?\"\n\n\"Mr. Luton?  Oh, yes,\" said Cicely, \"he'll probably have something to\ntell us about Gorla's concert,\" she added, turning to Ronnie.\n\nTony Luton was a young man who had sprung from the people, and had taken\ncare that there should be no recoil.  He was scarcely twenty years of\nage, but a tightly packed chronicle of vicissitudes lay behind his\nsprightly insouciant appearance.  Since his fifteenth year he had lived,\nHeaven knew how, getting sometimes a minor engagement at some minor music-\nhall, sometimes a temporary job as secretary-valet-companion to a roving\ninvalid, dining now and then on plovers' eggs and asparagus at one of the\nsmarter West End restaurants, at other times devouring a kipper or a\nsausage in some stuffy Edgware Road eating-house; always seemingly amused\nby life, and always amusing.  It is possible that somewhere in such heart\nas he possessed there lurked a rankling bitterness against the hard\nthings of life, or a scrap of gratitude towards the one or two friends\nwho had helped him disinterestedly, but his most intimate associates\ncould not have guessed at the existence of such feelings.  Tony Luton was\njust a merry-eyed dancing faun, whom Fate had surrounded with streets\ninstead of woods, and it would have been in the highest degree inartistic\nto have sounded him for a heart or a heartache.\n\nThe dancing of the faun took one day a livelier and more assured turn,\nthe joyousness became more real, and the worst of the vicissitudes seemed\nsuddenly over.  A musical friend, gifted with mediocre but marketable\nabilities, supplied Tony with a song, for which he obtained a trial\nperformance at an East End hall.  Dressed as a jockey, for no particular\nreason except that the costume suited him, he sang, \"They quaff the gay\nbubbly in Eccleston Square\" to an appreciative audience, which included\nthe manager of a famous West End theatre of varieties.  Tony and his song\nwon the managerial favour, and were immediately transplanted to the West\nEnd house, where they scored a success of which the drooping music-hall\nindustry was at the moment badly in need.\n\nIt was just after the great catastrophe, and men of the London world were\nin no humour to think; they had witnessed the inconceivable befall them,\nthey had nothing but political ruin to stare at, and they were anxious to\nlook the other way.  The words of Tony's song were more or less\nmeaningless, though he sang them remarkably well, but the tune, with its\nair of slyness and furtive joyousness, appealed in some unaccountable\nmanner to people who were furtively unhappy, and who were trying to\nappear stoically cheerful.\n\n\"What must be, must be,\" and \"It's a poor heart that never rejoices,\"\nwere the popular expressions of the London public at that moment, and the\nmen who had to cater for that public were thankful when they were able to\nstumble across anything that fitted in with the prevailing mood.  For the\nfirst time in his life Tony Luton discovered that agents and managers\nwere a leisured class, and that office boys had manners.\n\nHe entered Cicely's drawing-room with the air of one to whom assurance of\nmanner has become a sheathed weapon, a court accessory rather than a\ntrade implement.  He was more quietly dressed than the usual run of music-\nhall successes; he had looked critically at life from too many angles not\nto know that though clothes cannot make a man they can certainly damn\nhim.\n\n\"Thank you, I have lunched already,\" he said in answer to a question from\nCicely.  \"Thank you,\" he said again in a cheerful affirmative, as the\nquestion of hock in a tall ice-cold goblet was propounded to him.\n\n\"I've come to tell you the latest about the Gorla Mustelford evening,\" he\ncontinued.  \"Old Laurent is putting his back into it, and it's really\ngoing to be rather a big affair.  She's going to out-Russian the\nRussians.  Of course, she hasn't their technique nor a tenth of their\ntraining, but she's having tons of advertisement.  The name Gorla is\nalmost an advertisement in itself, and then there's the fact that she's\nthe daughter of a peer.\"\n\n\"She has temperament,\" said Cicely, with the decision of one who makes a\nvague statement in a good cause.\n\n\"So Laurent says,\" observed Tony.  \"He discovers temperament in every one\nthat he intends to boom.  He told me that I had temperament to the finger-\ntips, and I was too polite to contradict him.  But I haven't told you the\nreally important thing about the Mustelford debut.  It is a profound\nsecret, more or less, so you must promise not to breathe a word about it\ntill half-past four, when it will appear in all the six o'clock\nnewspapers.\"\n\nTony paused for dramatic effect, while he drained his goblet, and then\nmade his announcement.\n\n\"Majesty is going to be present.  Informally and unofficially, but still\npresent in the flesh.  A sort of casual dropping in, carefully heralded\nby unconfirmed rumour a week ahead.\"\n\n\"Heavens!\" exclaimed Cicely, in genuine excitement, \"what a bold stroke.\nLady Shalem has worked that, I bet.  I suppose it will go down all\nright.\"\n\n\"Trust Laurent to see to that,\" said Tony, \"he knows how to fill his\nhouse with the right sort of people, and he's not the one to risk a\nfiasco.  He knows what he's about.  I tell you, it's going to be a big\nevening.\"\n\n\"I say!\" exclaimed Ronnie suddenly, \"give a supper party here for Gorla\non the night, and ask the Shalem woman and all her crowd.  It will be\nawful fun.\"\n\nCicely caught at the suggestion with some enthusiasm.  She did not\nparticularly care for Lady Shalem, but she thought it would be just as\nwell to care for her as far as outward appearances went.\n\nGrace, Lady Shalem, was a woman who had blossomed into sudden importance\nby constituting herself a sort of foster-mother to the fait accompli.  At\na moment when London was denuded of most of its aforetime social leaders\nshe had seen her opportunity, and made the most of it.  She had not\ncontented herself with bowing to the inevitable, she had stretched out\nher hand to it, and forced herself to smile graciously at it, and her\npolite attentions had been reciprocated.  Lady Shalem, without being a\nbeauty or a wit, or a grand lady in the traditional sense of the word,\nwas in a fair way to becoming a power in the land; others, more capable\nand with stronger claims to social recognition, would doubtless\novershadow her and displace her in due course, but for the moment she was\na person whose good graces counted for something, and Cicely was quite\nalive to the advantage of being in those good graces.\n\n\"It would be rather fun,\" she said, running over in her mind the\npossibilities of the suggested supper-party.\n\n\"It would be jolly useful,\" put in Ronnie eagerly; \"you could get all\nsorts of interesting people together, and it would be an excellent\nadvertisement for Gorla.\"\n\nRonnie approved of supper-parties on principle, but he was also thinking\nof the advantage which might accrue to the drawing-room concert which\nCicely had projected (with himself as the chief performer), if he could\nbe brought into contact with a wider circle of music patrons.\n\n\"I know it would be useful,\" said Cicely, \"it would be almost historical;\nthere's no knowing who might not come to it--and things are dreadfully\nslack in the entertaining line just now.\"\n\nThe ambitious note in her character was making itself felt at that\nmoment.\n\n\"Let's go down to the library, and work out a list of people to invite,\"\nsaid Ronnie.\n\nA servant entered the room and made a brief announcement.\n\n\"Mr. Yeovil has arrived, madam.\"\n\n\"Bother,\" said Ronnie sulkily.  \"Now you'll cool off about that supper\nparty, and turn down Gorla and the rest of us.\"\n\nIt was certainly true that the supper already seemed a more difficult\nproposition in Cicely's eyes than it had a moment or two ago.\n\n   \"'You'll not forget my only daughter,\n   E'en though Saphia has crossed the sea,'\"\n\nquoted Tony, with mocking laughter in his voice and eyes.\n\nCicely went down to greet her husband.  She felt that she was probably\nvery glad that he was home once more; she was angry with herself for not\nfeeling greater certainty on the point.  Even the well-beloved, however,\ncan select the wrong moment for return.  If Cicely Yeovil's heart was\nlike a singing-bird, it was of a kind that has frequent lapses into\nsilence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II: THE HOMECOMING\n\n\nMurrey Yeovil got out of the boat-train at Victoria Station, and stood\nwaiting, in an attitude something between listlessness and impatience,\nwhile a porter dragged his light travelling kit out of the railway\ncarriage and went in search of his heavier baggage with a hand-truck.\nYeovil was a grey-faced young man, with restless eyes, and a rather\nwistful mouth, and an air of lassitude that was evidently only a\ntemporary characteristic.  The hot dusty station, with its blended crowds\nof dawdling and scurrying people, its little streams of suburban\npassengers pouring out every now and then from this or that platform,\nlike ants swarming across a garden path, made a wearisome climax to what\nhad been a rather wearisome journey.  Yeovil glanced quickly, almost\nfurtively, around him in all directions, with the air of a man who is\nconstrained by morbid curiosity to look for things that he would rather\nnot see.  The announcements placed in German alternatively with English\nover the booking office, left-luggage office, refreshment buffets, and so\nforth, the crowned eagle and monogram displayed on the post boxes, caught\nhis eye in quick succession.\n\nHe turned to help the porter to shepherd his belongings on to the truck,\nand followed him to the outer yard of the station, where a string of taxi-\ncabs was being slowly absorbed by an outpouring crowd of travellers.\n\nPortmanteaux, wraps, and a trunk or two, much be-labelled and\ntravel-worn, were stowed into a taxi, and Yeovil turned to give the\ndirection to the driver.\n\n\"Twenty-eight, Berkshire Street.\"\n\n\"Berkschirestrasse, acht-und-zwanzig,\" echoed the man, a bulky spectacled\nindividual of unmistakable Teuton type.\n\n\"Twenty-eight, Berkshire Street,\" repeated Yeovil, and got into the cab,\nleaving the driver to re-translate the direction into his own language.\n\nA succession of cabs leaving the station blocked the roadway for a moment\nor two, and Yeovil had leisure to observe the fact that Viktoria Strasse\nwas lettered side by side with the familiar English name of the street.  A\nnotice directing the public to the neighbouring swimming baths was also\nwritten up in both languages.  London had become a bi-lingual city, even\nas Warsaw.\n\nThe cab threaded its way swiftly along Buckingham Palace Road towards the\nMall.  As they passed the long front of the Palace the traveller turned\nhis head resolutely away, that he might not see the alien uniforms at the\ngates and the eagle standard flapping in the sunlight.  The taxi driver,\nwho seemed to have combative instincts, slowed down as he was turning\ninto the Mall, and pointed to the white pile of memorial statuary in\nfront of the palace gates.\n\n\"Grossmutter Denkmal, yes,\" he announced, and resumed his journey.\n\nArrived at his destination, Yeovil stood on the steps of his house and\npressed the bell with an odd sense of forlornness, as though he were a\nstranger drifting from nowhere into a land that had no cognisance of him;\na moment later he was standing in his own hall, the object of respectful\nsolicitude and attention.  Sprucely garbed and groomed lackeys busied\nthemselves with his battered travel-soiled baggage; the door closed on\nthe guttural-voiced taxi driver, and the glaring July sunshine.  The\nwearisome journey was over.\n\n\"Poor dear, how dreadfully pulled-down you look,\" said Cicely, when the\nfirst greetings had been exchanged.\n\n\"It's been a slow business, getting well,\" said Yeovil.  \"I'm only three-\nquarter way there yet.\"\n\nHe looked at his reflection in a mirror and laughed ruefully.\n\n\"You should have seen what I looked like five or six weeks ago,\" he\nadded.\n\n\"You ought to have let me come out and nurse you,\" said Cicely; \"you know\nI wanted to.\"\n\n\"Oh, they nursed me well enough,\" said Yeovil, \"and it would have been a\nshame dragging you out there; a small Finnish health resort, out of the\nseason, is not a very amusing place, and it would have been worse for any\none who didn't talk Russian.\"\n\n\"You must have been buried alive there,\" said Cicely, with commiseration\nin her voice.\n\n\"I wanted to be buried alive,\" said Yeovil.  \"The news from the outer\nworld was not of a kind that helped a despondent invalid towards\nconvalescence.  They spoke to me as little as possible about what was\nhappening, and I was grateful for your letters because they also told me\nvery little.  When one is abroad, among foreigners, one's country's\nmisfortunes cause one an acuter, more personal distress, than they would\nat home even.\"\n\n\"Well, you are at home now, anyway,\" said Cicely, \"and you can jog along\nthe road to complete recovery at your own pace.  A little quiet shooting\nthis autumn and a little hunting, just enough to keep you fit and not to\novertire you; you mustn't overtax your strength.\"\n\n\"I'm getting my strength back all right,\" said Yeovil.  \"This journey\nhasn't tired me half as much as one might have expected.  It's the awful\ndrag of listlessness, mental and physical, that is the worst after-effect\nof these marsh fevers; they drain the energy out of you in bucketfuls,\nand it trickles back again in teaspoonfuls.  And just now untiring energy\nis what I shall need, even more than strength; I don't want to degenerate\ninto a slacker.\"\n\n\"Look here, Murrey,\" said Cicely, \"after we've had dinner together to-\nnight, I'm going to do a seemingly unwifely thing.  I'm going to go out\nand leave you alone with an old friend.  Doctor Holham is coming in to\ndrink coffee and smoke with you.  I arranged this because I knew it was\nwhat you would like.  Men can talk these things over best by themselves,\nand Holham can tell you everything that happened--since you went away.  It\nwill be a dreary story, I'm afraid, but you will want to hear it all.  It\nwas a nightmare time, but now one sees it in a calmer perspective.\"\n\n\"I feel in a nightmare still,\" said Yeovil.\n\n\"We all felt like that,\" said Cicely, rather with the air of an elder\nperson who tells a child that it will understand things better when it\ngrows up; \"time is always something of a narcotic you know.  Things seem\nabsolutely unbearable, and then bit by bit we find out that we are\nbearing them.  And now, dear, I'll fill up your notification paper and\nleave you to superintend your unpacking.  Robert will give you any help\nyou want.\"\n\n\"What is the notification paper?\" asked Yeovil.\n\n\"Oh, a stupid form to be filled up when any one arrives, to say where\nthey come from, and their business and nationality and religion, and all\nthat sort of thing.  We're rather more bureaucratic than we used to be,\nyou know.\"\n\nYeovil said nothing, but into the sallow greyness of his face there crept\na dark flush, that faded presently and left his colour more grey and\nbloodless than before.\n\nThe journey seemed suddenly to have recommenced; he was under his own\nroof, his servants were waiting on him, his familiar possessions were in\nevidence around him, but the sense of being at home had vanished.  It was\nas though he had arrived at some wayside hotel, and been asked to\nregister his name and status and destination.  Other things of disgust\nand irritation he had foreseen in the London he was coming to--the\nalterations on stamps and coinage, the intrusive Teuton element, the\nalien uniforms cropping up everywhere, the new orientation of social\nlife; such things he was prepared for, but this personal evidence of his\nsubject state came on him unawares, at a moment when he had, so to speak,\nlaid his armour aside.  Cicely spoke lightly of the hateful formality\nthat had been forced on them; would he, too, come to regard things in the\nsame acquiescent spirit?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III: \"THE METSKIE TSAR\"\n\n\n\"I was in the early stages of my fever when I got the first inkling of\nwhat was going on,\" said Yeovil to the doctor, as they sat over their\ncoffee in a recess of the big smoking-room; \"just able to potter about a\nbit in the daytime, fighting against depression and inertia, feverish as\nevening came on, and delirious in the night.  My game tracker and my\nattendant were both Buriats, and spoke very little Russian, and that was\nthe only language we had in common to converse in.  In matters concerning\nfood and sport we soon got to understand each other, but on other\nsubjects we were not easily able to exchange ideas.  One day my tracker\nhad been to a distant trading-store to get some things of which we were\nin need; the store was eighty miles from the nearest point of railroad,\neighty miles of terribly bad roads, but it was in its way a centre and\ntransmitter of news from the outside world.  The tracker brought back\nwith him vague tidings of a conflict of some sort between the 'Metskie\nTsar' and the 'Angliskie Tsar,' and kept repeating the Russian word for\ndefeat.  The 'Angliskie Tsar' I recognised, of course, as the King of\nEngland, but my brain was too sick and dull to read any further meaning\ninto the man's reiterated gabble.  I grew so ill just then that I had to\ngive up the struggle against fever, and make my way as best I could\ntowards the nearest point where nursing and doctoring could be had.  It\nwas one evening, in a lonely rest-hut on the edge of a huge forest, as I\nwas waiting for my boy to bring the meal for which I was feverishly\nimpatient, and which I knew I should loathe as soon as it was brought,\nthat the explanation of the word 'Metskie' flashed on me.  I had thought\nof it as referring to some Oriental potentate, some rebellious rajah\nperhaps, who was giving trouble, and whose followers had possibly\ndiscomfited an isolated British force in some out-of-the-way corner of\nour Empire.  And all of a sudden I knew that 'Nemetskie Tsar,' German\nEmperor, had been the name that the man had been trying to convey to me.\nI shouted for the tracker, and put him through a breathless\ncross-examination; he confirmed what my fears had told me.  The 'Metskie\nTsar' was a big European ruler, he had been in conflict with the\n'Angliskie Tsar,' and the latter had been defeated, swept away; the man\nspoke the word that he used for ships, and made energetic pantomime to\nexpress the sinking of a fleet.  Holham, there was nothing for it but to\nhope that this was a false, groundless rumour, that had somehow crept to\nthe confines of civilisation.  In my saner balanced moments it was\npossible to disbelieve it, but if you have ever suffered from delirium\nyou will know what raging torments of agony I went through in the nights,\nhow my brain fought and refought that rumoured disaster.\"\n\nThe doctor gave a murmur of sympathetic understanding.\n\n\"Then,\" continued Yeovil, \"I reached the small Siberian town towards\nwhich I had been struggling.  There was a little colony of Russians\nthere, traders, officials, a doctor or two, and some army officers.  I\nput up at the primitive hotel-restaurant, which was the general gathering-\nplace of the community.  I knew quickly that the news was true.  Russians\nare the most tactful of any European race that I have ever met; they did\nnot stare with insolent or pitying curiosity, but there was something\nchanged in their attitude which told me that the travelling Briton was no\nlonger in their eyes the interesting respect-commanding personality that\nhe had been in past days.  I went to my own room, where the samovar was\nbubbling its familiar tune and a smiling red-shirted Russian boy was\nhelping my Buriat servant to unpack my wardrobe, and I asked for any back\nnumbers of newspapers that could be supplied at a moment's notice.  I was\ngiven a bundle of well-thumbed sheets, odd pieces of the Novoe Vremya,\nthe Moskovskie Viedomosti, one or two complete numbers of local papers\npublished at Perm and Tobolsk.  I do not read Russian well, though I\nspeak it fairly readily, but from the fragments of disconnected telegrams\nthat I pieced together I gathered enough information to acquaint me with\nthe extent of the tragedy that had been worked out in a few crowded hours\nin a corner of North-Western Europe.  I searched frantically for\ntelegrams of later dates that would put a better complexion on the\nmatter, that would retrieve something from the ruin; presently I came\nacross a page of the illustrated supplement that the Novoe Vremya\npublishes once a week.  There was a photograph of a long-fronted building\nwith a flag flying over it, labelled 'The new standard floating over\nBuckingham Palace.'  The picture was not much more than a smudge, but the\nflag, possibly touched up, was unmistakable.  It was the eagle of the\nNemetskie Tsar.  I have a vivid recollection of that plainly-furnished\nlittle room, with the inevitable gilt ikon in one corner, and the samovar\nhissing and gurgling on the table, and the thrumming music of a balalaika\norchestra coming up from the restaurant below; the next coherent thing I\ncan remember was weeks and weeks later, discussing in an impersonal\ndetached manner whether I was strong enough to stand the fatigue of the\nlong railway journey to Finland.\n\n\"Since then, Holham, I have been encouraged to keep my mind as much off\nthe war and public affairs as possible, and I have been glad to do so.  I\nknew the worst and there was no particular use in deepening my\ndespondency by dragging out the details.  But now I am more or less a\nlive man again, and I want to fill in the gaps in my knowledge of what\nhappened.  You know how much I know, and how little; those fragments of\nRussian newspapers were about all the information that I had.  I don't\neven know clearly how the whole thing started.\"\n\nYeovil settled himself back in his chair with the air of a man who has\ndone some necessary talking, and now assumes the role of listener.\n\n\"It started,\" said the doctor, \"with a wholly unimportant disagreement\nabout some frontier business in East Africa; there was a slight attack of\nnerves in the stock markets, and then the whole thing seemed in a fair\nway towards being settled.  Then the negotiations over the affair began\nto drag unduly, and there was a further flutter of nervousness in the\nmoney world.  And then one morning the papers reported a highly menacing\nspeech by one of the German Ministers, and the situation began to look\nblack indeed.  'He will be disavowed,' every one said over here, but in\nless than twenty-four hours those who knew anything knew that the crisis\nwas on us--only their knowledge came too late.  'War between two such\ncivilised and enlightened nations is an impossibility,' one of our\nleaders of public opinion had declared on the Saturday; by the following\nFriday the war had indeed become an impossibility, because we could no\nlonger carry it on.  It burst on us with calculated suddenness, and we\nwere just not enough, everywhere where the pressure came.  Our ships were\ngood against their ships, our seamen were better than their seamen, but\nour ships were not able to cope with their ships plus their superiority\nin aircraft.  Our trained men were good against their trained men, but\nthey could not be in several places at once, and the enemy could.  Our\nhalf-trained men and our untrained men could not master the science of\nwar at a moment's notice, and a moment's notice was all they got.  The\nenemy were a nation apprenticed in arms, we were not even the idle\napprentice: we had not deemed apprenticeship worth our while.  There was\ncourage enough running loose in the land, but it was like unharnessed\nelectricity, it controlled no forces, it struck no blows.  There was no\ntime for the heroism and the devotion which a drawn-out struggle, however\nhopeless, can produce; the war was over almost as soon as it had begun.\nAfter the reverses which happened with lightning rapidity in the first\nthree days of warfare, the newspapers made no effort to pretend that the\nsituation could be retrieved; editors and public alike recognised that\nthese were blows over the heart, and that it was a matter of moments\nbefore we were counted out.  One might liken the whole affair to a snap\ncheckmate early in a game of chess; one side had thought out the moves,\nand brought the requisite pieces into play, the other side was hampered\nand helpless, with its resources unavailable, its strategy discounted in\nadvance.  That, in a nutshell, is the history of the war.\"\n\nYeovil was silent for a moment or two, then he asked:\n\n\"And the sequel, the peace?\"\n\n\"The collapse was so complete that I fancy even the enemy were hardly\nprepared for the consequences of their victory.  No one had quite\nrealised what one disastrous campaign would mean for an island nation\nwith a closely packed population.  The conquerors were in a position to\ndictate what terms they pleased, and it was not wonderful that their\nideas of aggrandisement expanded in the hour of intoxication.  There was\nno European combination ready to say them nay, and certainly no one Power\nwas going to be rash enough to step in to contest the terms of the treaty\nthat they imposed on the conquered.  Annexation had probably never been a\ndream before the war; after the war it suddenly became temptingly\npractical.  Warum nicht? became the theme of leader-writers in the German\npress; they pointed out that Britain, defeated and humiliated, but with\nenormous powers of recuperation, would be a dangerous and inevitable\nenemy for the Germany of to-morrow, while Britain incorporated within the\nHohenzollern Empire would merely be a disaffected province, without a\nnavy to make its disaffection a serious menace, and with great tax-paying\ncapabilities, which would be available for relieving the burdens of the\nother Imperial States.  Wherefore, why not annex?  The warum nicht? party\nprevailed.  Our King, as you know, retired with his Court to Delhi, as\nEmperor in the East, with most of his overseas dominions still subject to\nhis sway.  The British Isles came under the German Crown as a Reichsland,\na sort of Alsace-Lorraine washed by the North Sea instead of the Rhine.\nWe still retain our Parliament, but it is a clipped and pruned-down\nshadow of its former self, with most of its functions in abeyance; when\nthe elections were held it was difficult to get decent candidates to come\nforward or to get people to vote.  It makes one smile bitterly to think\nthat a year or two ago we were seriously squabbling as to who should have\nvotes.  And, of course, the old party divisions have more or less\ncrumbled away.  The Liberals naturally are under the blackest of clouds,\nfor having steered the country to disaster, though to do them justice it\nwas no more their fault than the fault of any other party.  In a\ndemocracy such as ours was the Government of the day must more or less\nreflect the ideas and temperament of the nation in all vital matters, and\nthe British nation in those days could not have been persuaded of the\nurgent need for military apprenticeship or of the deadly nature of its\ndanger.  It was willing now and then to be half-frightened and to have\nhalf-measures, or, one might better say, quarter-measures taken to\nreassure it, and the governments of the day were willing to take them,\nbut any political party or group of statesmen that had said 'the danger\nis enormous and immediate, the sacrifices and burdens must be enormous\nand immediate,' would have met with certain defeat at the polls.  Still,\nof course, the Liberals, as the party that had held office for nearly a\ndecade, incurred the odium of a people maddened by defeat and\nhumiliation; one Minister, who had had less responsibility for military\norganisation than perhaps any of them, was attacked and nearly killed at\nNewcastle, another was hiding for three days on Exmoor, and escaped in\ndisguise.\"\n\n\"And the Conservatives?\"\n\n\"They are also under eclipse, but it is more or less voluntary in their\ncase.  For generations they had taken their stand as supporters of Throne\nand Constitution, and when they suddenly found the Constitution gone and\nthe Throne filled by an alien dynasty, their political orientation had\nvanished.  They are in much the same position as the Jacobites occupied\nafter the Hanoverian accession.  Many of the leading Tory families have\nemigrated to the British lands beyond the seas, others are shut up in\ntheir country houses, retrenching their expenses, selling their acres,\nand investing their money abroad.  The Labour faction, again, are almost\nin as bad odour as the Liberals, because of having hob-nobbed too\neffusively and ostentatiously with the German democratic parties on the\neve of the war, exploiting an evangel of universal brotherhood which did\nnot blunt a single Teuton bayonet when the hour came.  I suppose in time\nparty divisions will reassert themselves in some form or other; there\nwill be a Socialist Party, and the mercantile and manufacturing interests\nwill evolve a sort of bourgeoise party, and the different religious\nbodies will try to get themselves represented--\"\n\nYeovil made a movement of impatience.\n\n\"All these things that you forecast,\" he said, \"must take time,\nconsiderable time; is this nightmare, then, to go on for ever?\"\n\n\"It is not a nightmare, unfortunately,\" said the doctor, \"it is a\nreality.\"\n\n\"But, surely--a nation such as ours, a virile, highly-civilised nation\nwith an age-long tradition of mastery behind it, cannot be held under for\never by a few thousand bayonets and machine guns.  We must surely rise up\none day and drive them out.\"\n\n\"Dear man,\" said the doctor, \"we might, of course, at some given moment\noverpower the garrison that is maintained here, and seize the forts, and\nperhaps we might be able to mine the harbours; what then?  In a fortnight\nor so we could be starved into unconditional submission.  Remember, all\nthe advantages of isolated position that told in our favour while we had\nthe sea dominion, tell against us now that the sea dominion is in other\nhands.  The enemy would not need to mobilise a single army corps or to\nbring a single battleship into action; a fleet of nimble cruisers and\ndestroyers circling round our coasts would be sufficient to shut out our\nfood supplies.\"\n\n\"Are you trying to tell me that this is a final overthrow?\" said Yeovil\nin a shaking voice; \"are we to remain a subject race like the Poles?\"\n\n\"Let us hope for a better fate,\" said the doctor.  \"Our opportunity may\ncome if the Master Power is ever involved in an unsuccessful naval war\nwith some other nation, or perhaps in some time of European crisis, when\neverything hung in the balance, our latent hostility might have to be\nsquared by a concession of independence.  That is what we have to hope\nfor and watch for.  On the other hand, the conquerors have to count on\ntime and tact to weaken and finally obliterate the old feelings of\nnationality; the middle-aged of to-day will grow old and acquiescent in\nthe changed state of things; the young generations will grow up never\nhaving known anything different.  It's a far cry to Delhi, as the old\nIndian proverb says, and the strange half-European, half-Asiatic Court\nout there will seem more and more a thing exotic and unreal.  'The King\nacross the water' was a rallying-cry once upon a time in our history, but\na king on the further side of the Indian Ocean is a shadowy competitor\nfor one who alternates between Potsdam and Windsor.\"\n\n\"I want you to tell me everything,\" said Yeovil, after another pause;\n\"tell me, Holham, how far has this obliterating process of 'time and\ntact' gone?  It seems to be pretty fairly started already.  I bought a\nnewspaper as soon as I landed, and I read it in the train coming up.  I\nread things that puzzled and disgusted me.  There were announcements of\nconcerts and plays and first-nights and private views; there were even\nsmall dances.  There were advertisements of house-boats and week-end\ncottages and string bands for garden parties.  It struck me that it was\nrather like merrymaking with a dead body lying in the house.\"\n\n\"Yeovil,\" said the doctor, \"you must bear in mind two things.  First, the\nnecessity for the life of the country going on as if nothing had\nhappened.  It is true that many thousands of our working men and women\nhave emigrated and thousands of our upper and middle class too; they were\nthe people who were not tied down by business, or who could afford to cut\nthose ties.  But those represent comparatively a few out of the many.  The\ngreat businesses and the small businesses must go on, people must be fed\nand clothed and housed and medically treated, and their thousand-and-one\nwants and necessities supplied.  Look at me, for instance; however much I\nloathe coming under a foreign domination and paying taxes to an alien\ngovernment, I can't abandon my practice and my patients, and set up anew\nin Toronto or Allahabad, and if I could, some other doctor would have to\ntake my place here.  I or that other doctor must have our servants and\nmotors and food and furniture and newspapers, even our sport.  The golf\nlinks and the hunting field have been well-nigh deserted since the war,\nbut they are beginning to get back their votaries because out-door sport\nhas become a necessity, and a very rational necessity, with numbers of\nmen who have to work otherwise under unnatural and exacting conditions.\nThat is one factor of the situation.  The other affects London more\nespecially, but through London it influences the rest of the country to a\ncertain extent.  You will see around you here much that will strike you\nas indications of heartless indifference to the calamity that has\nbefallen our nation.  Well, you must remember that many things in modern\nlife, especially in the big cities, are not national but international.\nIn the world of music and art and the drama, for instance, the foreign\nnames are legion, they confront you at every turn, and some of our\nBritish devotees of such arts are more acclimatised to the ways of Munich\nor Moscow than they are familiar with the life, say, of Stirling or York.\nFor years they have lived and thought and spoken in an atmosphere and\njargon of denationalised culture--even those of them who have never left\nour shores.  They would take pains to be intimately familiar with the\ndomestic affairs and views of life of some Galician gipsy dramatist, and\ngravely quote and discuss his opinions on debts and mistresses and\ncookery, while they would shudder at 'D'ye ken John Peel?' as a piece of\nuncouth barbarity.  You cannot expect a world of that sort to be\npermanently concerned or downcast because the Crown of Charlemagne takes\nits place now on the top of the Royal box in the theatres, or at the head\nof programmes at State concerts.  And then there are the Jews.\"\n\n\"There are many in the land, or at least in London,\" said Yeovil.\n\n\"There are even more of them now than there used to be,\" said Holham.  \"I\nam to a great extent a disliker of Jews myself, but I will be fair to\nthem, and admit that those of them who were in any genuine sense British\nhave remained British and have stuck by us loyally in our misfortune; all\nhonour to them.  But of the others, the men who by temperament and\neverything else were far more Teuton or Polish or Latin than they were\nBritish, it was not to be expected that they would be heartbroken because\nLondon had suddenly lost its place among the political capitals of the\nworld, and became a cosmopolitan city.  They had appreciated the free and\neasy liberty of the old days, under British rule, but there was a stiff\ninsularity in the ruling race that they chafed against.  Now, putting\naside some petty Government restrictions that Teutonic bureaucracy has\nbrought in, there is really, in their eyes, more licence and social\nadaptability in London than before.  It has taken on some of the aspects\nof a No-Man's-Land, and the Jew, if he likes, may almost consider himself\nas of the dominant race; at any rate he is ubiquitous.  Pleasure, of the\ncafe and cabaret and boulevard kind, the sort of thing that gave Berlin\nthe aspect of the gayest capital in Europe within the last decade, that\nis the insidious leaven that will help to denationalise London.  Berlin\nwill probably climb back to some of its old austerity and simplicity, a\nworld-ruling city with a great sense of its position and its\nresponsibilities, while London will become more and more the centre of\nwhat these people understand by life.\"\n\nYeovil made a movement of impatience and disgust.\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said the doctor, sympathetically; \"life and enjoyment\nmean to you the howl of a wolf in a forest, the call of a wild swan on\nthe frozen tundras, the smell of a wood fire in some little inn among the\nmountains.  There is more music to you in the quick thud, thud of hoofs\non desert mud as a free-stepping horse is led up to your tent door than\nin all the dronings and flourishes that a highly-paid orchestra can reel\nout to an expensively fed audience.  But the tastes of modern London, as\nwe see them crystallised around us, lie in a very different direction.\nPeople of the world that I am speaking of, our dominant world at the\npresent moment, herd together as closely packed to the square yard as\npossible, doing nothing worth doing, and saying nothing worth saying, but\ndoing it and saying it over and over again, listening to the same\nmelodies, watching the same artistes, echoing the same catchwords,\nordering the same dishes in the same restaurants, suffering each other's\ncigarette smoke and perfumes and conversation, feverishly, anxiously\nmaking arrangements to meet each other again to-morrow, next week, and\nthe week after next, and repeat the same gregarious experience.  If they\nwere not herded together in a corner of western London, watching each\nother with restless intelligent eyes, they would be herded together at\nBrighton or Dieppe, doing the same thing.  Well, you will find that life\nof that sort goes forward just as usual, only it is even more prominent\nand noticeable now because there is less public life of other kinds.\"\n\nYeovil said something which was possibly the Buriat word for the nether\nworld.  Outside in the neighbouring square a band had been playing at\nintervals during the evening.  Now it struck up an air that Yeovil had\nalready heard whistled several times since his landing, an air with a\ncaptivating suggestion of slyness and furtive joyousness running through\nit.\n\nHe rose and walked across to the window, opening it a little wider.  He\nlistened till the last notes had died away.\n\n\"What is that tune they have just played?\" he asked.\n\n\"You'll hear it often enough,\" said the doctor.  \"A Frenchman writing in\nthe Matin the other day called it the 'National Anthem of the fait\naccompli.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV: \"ES IST VERBOTEN\"\n\n\nYeovil wakened next morning to the pleasant sensation of being in a\nhousehold where elaborate machinery for the smooth achievement of one's\ndaily life was noiselessly and unceasingly at work.  Fever and the long\nweariness of convalescence in indifferently comfortable surroundings had\ngiven luxury a new value in his eyes.  Money had not always been\nplentiful with him in his younger days; in his twenty-eighth year he had\ninherited a fairly substantial fortune, and he had married a wealthy\nwoman a few months later.  It was characteristic of the man and his breed\nthat the chief use to which he had put his newly-acquired wealth had been\nin seizing the opportunity which it gave him for indulging in unlimited\ntravel in wild, out-of-the-way regions, where the comforts of life were\nmeagrely represented.  Cicely occasionally accompanied him to the\nthreshold of his expeditions, such as Cairo or St. Petersburg or\nConstantinople, but her own tastes in the matter of roving were more or\nless condensed within an area that comprised Cannes, Homburg, the\nScottish Highlands, and the Norwegian Fiords.  Things outlandish and\nbarbaric appealed to her chiefly when presented under artistic but highly\ncivilised stage management on the boards of Covent Garden, and if she\nwanted to look at wolves or sand grouse, she preferred doing so in the\ncompany of an intelligent Fellow of the Zoological Society on some fine\nSunday afternoon in Regent's Park.  It was one of the bonds of union and\ngood-fellowship between her husband and herself that each understood and\nsympathised with the other's tastes without in the least wanting to share\nthem; they went their own ways and were pleased and comrade-like when the\nways happened to run together for a span, without self-reproach or heart-\nsearching when the ways diverged.  Moreover, they had separate and\nadequate banking accounts, which constitute, if not the keys of the\nmatrimonial Heaven, at least the oil that lubricates them.\n\nYeovil found Cicely and breakfast waiting for him in the cool breakfast-\nroom, and enjoyed, with the appreciation of a recent invalid, the comfort\nand resources of a meal that had not to be ordered or thought about in\nadvance, but seemed as though it were there, fore-ordained from the\nbeginning of time in its smallest detail.  Each desire of the\nbreakfasting mind seemed to have its realisation in some dish, lurking\nunobtrusively in hidden corners until asked for.  Did one want grilled\nmushrooms, English fashion, they were there, black and moist and\nsizzling, and extremely edible; did one desire mushrooms a la Russe, they\nappeared, blanched and cool and toothsome under their white blanketing of\nsauce.  At one's bidding was a service of coffee, prepared with rather\nmore forethought and circumspection than would go to the preparation of a\nrevolution in a South American Republic.\n\nThe exotic blooms that reigned in profusion over the other parts of the\nhouse were scrupulously banished from the breakfast-room; bowls of wild\nthyme and other flowering weeds of the meadow and hedgerow gave it an\natmosphere of country freshness that was in keeping with the morning\nmeal.\n\n\"You look dreadfully tired still,\" said Cicely critically, \"otherwise I\nwould recommend a ride in the Park, before it gets too hot.  There is a\nnew cob in the stable that you will just love, but he is rather lively,\nand you had better content yourself for the present with some more sedate\nexercise than he is likely to give you.  He is apt to try and jump out of\nhis skin when the flies tease him.  The Park is rather jolly for a walk\njust now.\"\n\n\"I think that will be about my form after my long journey,\" said Yeovil,\n\"an hour's stroll before lunch under the trees.  That ought not to\nfatigue me unduly.  In the afternoon I'll look up one or two people.\"\n\n\"Don't count on finding too many of your old set,\" said Cicely rather\nhurriedly.  \"I dare say some of them will find their way back some time,\nbut at present there's been rather an exodus.\"\n\n\"The Bredes,\" said Yeovil, \"are they here?\"\n\n\"No, the Bredes are in Scotland, at their place in Sutherlandshire; they\ndon't come south now, and the Ricardes are farming somewhere in East\nAfrica, the whole lot of them.  Valham has got an appointment of some\nsort in the Straits Settlement, and has taken his family with him.  The\nCollards are down at their mother's place in Norfolk; a German banker has\nbought their house in Manchester Square.\"\n\n\"And the Hebways?\" asked Yeovil.\n\n\"Dick Hebway is in India,\" said Cicely, \"but his mother lives in Paris;\npoor Hugo, you know, was killed in the war.  My friends the Allinsons are\nin Paris too.  It's rather a clearance, isn't it?  However, there are\nsome left, and I expect others will come back in time.  Pitherby is here;\nhe's one of those who are trying to make the best of things under the new\nregime.\"\n\n\"He would be,\" said Yeovil, shortly.\n\n\"It's a difficult question,\" said Cicely, \"whether one should stay at\nhome and face the music or go away and live a transplanted life under the\nBritish flag.  Either attitude might be dictated by patriotism.\"\n\n\"It is one thing to face the music, it is another thing to dance to it,\"\nsaid Yeovil.\n\nCicely poured out some more coffee for herself and changed the\nconversation.\n\n\"You'll be in to lunch, I suppose?  The Clubs are not very attractive\njust now, I believe, and the restaurants are mostly hot in the middle of\nthe day.  Ronnie Storre is coming in; he's here pretty often these days.\nA rather good-looking young animal with something mid-way between talent\nand genius in the piano-playing line.\"\n\n\"Not long-haired and Semetic or Tcheque or anything of that sort, I\nsuppose?\" asked Yeovil.\n\nCicely laughed at the vision of Ronnie conjured up by her husband's\nwords.\n\n\"No, beautifully groomed and clipped and Anglo-Saxon.  I expect you'll\nlike him.  He plays bridge almost as well as he plays the piano.  I\nsuppose you wonder at any one who can play bridge well wanting to play\nthe piano.\"\n\n\"I'm not quite so intolerant as all that,\" said Yeovil; \"anyhow I promise\nto like Ronnie.  Is any one else coming to lunch?\"\n\n\"Joan Mardle will probably drop in, in fact I'm afraid she's a certainty.\nShe invited herself in that way of hers that brooks of no refusal.  On\nthe other hand, as a mitigating circumstance, there will be a point\nd'asperge omelette such as few kitchens could turn out, so don't be\nlate.\"\n\nYeovil set out for his morning walk with the curious sensation of one who\nstarts on a voyage of discovery in a land that is well known to him.  He\nturned into the Park at Hyde Park corner and made his way along the\nfamiliar paths and alleys that bordered the Row.  The familiarity\nvanished when he left the region of fenced-in lawns and rhododendron\nbushes and came to the open space that stretched away beyond the\nbandstand.  The bandstand was still there, and a military band, in sky-\nblue Saxon uniform, was executing the first item in the forenoon\nprogramme of music.  Around it, instead of the serried rows of green\nchairs that Yeovil remembered, was spread out an acre or so of small\nround tables, most of which had their quota of customers, engaged in a\nsteady consumption of lager beer, coffee, lemonade and syrups.  Further\nin the background, but well within earshot of the band, a gaily painted\npagoda-restaurant sheltered a number of more commodious tables under its\nawnings, and gave a hint of convenient indoor accommodation for wet or\nwindy weather.  Movable screens of trellis-trained foliage and climbing\nroses formed little hedges by means of which any particular table could\nbe shut off from its neighbours if semi-privacy were desired.  One or two\ndecorative advertisements of popularised brands of champagne and Rhine\nwines adorned the outside walls of the building, and under the central\ngable of its upper story was a flamboyant portrait of a stern-faced man,\nwhose image and superscription might also be found on the newer coinage\nof the land.  A mass of bunting hung in folds round the flag-pole on the\ngable, and blew out now and then on a favouring breeze, a long\nthree-coloured strip, black, white, and scarlet, and over the whole scene\nthe elm trees towered with an absurd sardonic air of nothing having\nchanged around their roots.\n\nYeovil stood for a minute or two, taking in every detail of the\nunfamiliar spectacle.\n\n\"They have certainly accomplished something that we never attempted,\" he\nmuttered to himself.  Then he turned on his heel and made his way back to\nthe shady walk that ran alongside the Row.  At first sight little was\nchanged in the aspect of the well-known exercising ground.  One or two\nriding masters cantered up and down as of yore, with their attendant\nbroods of anxious-faced young girls and awkwardly bumping women pupils,\nwhile horsey-looking men put marketable animals through their paces or\ndrew up to the rails for long conversations with horsey-looking friends\non foot.  Sportingly attired young women, sitting astride of their\nhorses, careered by at intervals as though an extremely game fox were\nleading hounds a merry chase a short way ahead of them; it all seemed\nmuch as usual.\n\nPresently, from the middle distance a bright patch of colour set in a\nwhirl of dust drew rapidly nearer and resolved itself into a group of\ncavalry officers extending their chargers in a smart gallop.  They were\nwell mounted and sat their horses to perfection, and they made a brave\nshow as they raced past Yeovil with a clink and clatter and rhythmic\nthud, thud, of hoofs, and became once more a patch of colour in a whirl\nof dust.  An answering glow of colour seemed to have burned itself into\nthe grey face of the young man, who had seen them pass without appearing\nto look at them, a stinging rush of blood, accompanied by a choking catch\nin the throat and a hot white blindness across the eyes.  The weakness of\nfever broke down at times the rampart of outward indifference that a man\nof Yeovil's temperament builds coldly round his heartstrings.\n\nThe Row and its riders had become suddenly detestable to the wanderer; he\nwould not run the risk of seeing that insolently joyous cavalcade come\ngalloping past again.  Beyond a narrow stretch of tree-shaded grass lay\nthe placid sunlit water of the Serpentine, and Yeovil made a short cut\nacross the turf to reach its gravelled bank.\n\n\"Can't you read either English or German?\" asked a policeman who\nconfronted him as he stepped off the turf.\n\nYeovil stared at the man and then turned to look at the small\nneatly-printed notice to which the official was imperiously pointing; in\ntwo languages it was made known that it was forbidden and verboten,\npunishable and straffbar, to walk on the grass.\n\n\"Three shilling fine,\" said the policeman, extending his hand for the\nmoney.\n\n\"Do I pay you?\" asked Yeovil, feeling almost inclined to laugh; \"I'm\nrather a stranger to the new order of things.\"\n\n\"You pay me,\" said the policeman, \"and you receive a quittance for the\nsum paid,\" and he proceeded to tear a counterfoil receipt for a three\nshilling fine from a small pocket book.\n\n\"May I ask,\" said Yeovil, as he handed over the sum demanded and received\nhis quittance, \"what the red and white band on your sleeve stands for?\"\n\n\"Bi-lingual,\" said the constable, with an air of importance.  \"Preference\nis given to members of the Force who qualify in both languages.  Nearly\nall the police engaged on Park duty are bi-lingual.  About as many\nforeigners as English use the parks nowadays; in fact, on a fine Sunday\nafternoon, you'll find three foreigners to every two English.  The park\nhabit is more Continental than British, I take it.\"\n\n\"And are there many Germans in the police Force?\" asked Yeovil.\n\n\"Well, yes, a good few; there had to be,\" said the constable; \"there were\nsuch a lot of resignations when the change came, and they had to be\nfilled up somehow.  Lots of men what used to be in the Force emigrated or\nfound work of some other kind, but everybody couldn't take that line;\nwives and children had to be thought of.  'Tisn't every head of a family\nthat can chuck up a job on the chance of finding another.  Starvation's\nbeen the lot of a good many what went out.  Those of us that stayed on\ngot better pay than we did before, but then of course the duties are much\nmore multitudinous.\"\n\n\"They must be,\" said Yeovil, fingering his three shilling State document;\n\"by the way,\" he asked, \"are all the grass plots in the Park out of\nbounds for human feet?\"\n\n\"Everywhere where you see the notices,\" said the policeman, \"and that's\nabout three-fourths of the whole grass space; there's been a lot of new\ngravel walks opened up in all directions.  People don't want to walk on\nthe grass when they've got clean paths to walk on.\"\n\nAnd with this parting reproof the bi-lingual constable strode heavily\naway, his loss of consideration and self-esteem as a unit of a sometime\nruling race evidently compensated for to some extent by his enhanced\nimportance as an official.\n\n\"The women and children,\" thought Yeovil, as he looked after the\nretreating figure; \"yes, that is one side of the problem.  The children\nthat have to be fed and schooled, the women folk that have to be cared\nfor, an old mother, perhaps, in the home that cannot be broken up.  The\nold case of giving hostages.\"\n\nHe followed the path alongside the Serpentine, passing under the archway\nof the bridge and continuing his walk into Kensington Gardens.  In\nanother moment he was within view of the Peter Pan statue and at once\nobserved that it had companions.  On one side was a group representing a\nscene from one of the Grimm fairy stories, on the other was Alice in\nconversation with Gryphon and Mockturtle, the episode looking\ndistressingly stiff and meaningless in its sculptured form.  Two other\nspaces had been cleared in the neighbouring turf, evidently for the\nreception of further statue groups, which Yeovil mentally assigned to\nStruwelpeter and Little Lord Fauntleroy.\n\n\"German middle-class taste,\" he commented, \"but in this matter we\ncertainly gave them a lead.  I suppose the idea is that childish fancy is\ndead and that it is only decent to erect some sort of memorial to it.\"\n\nThe day was growing hotter, and the Park had ceased to seem a desirable\nplace to loiter in.  Yeovil turned his steps homeward, passing on his way\nthe bandstand with its surrounding acreage of tables.  It was now nearly\none o'clock, and luncheon parties were beginning to assemble under the\nawnings of the restaurant.  Lighter refreshments, in the shape of\nsausages and potato salads, were being carried out by scurrying waiters\nto the drinkers of lager beer at the small tables.  A park orchestra, in\nbrilliant trappings, had taken the place of the military band.  As Yeovil\npassed the musicians launched out into the tune which the doctor had\ntruly predicted he would hear to repletion before he had been many days\nin London; the \"National Anthem of the fait accompli.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V: L'ART D'ETRE COUSINE\n\n\nJoan Mardle had reached forty in the leisurely untroubled fashion of a\nwoman who intends to be comely and attractive at fifty.  She cultivated a\njovial, almost joyous manner, with a top-dressing of hearty good will and\ngood nature which disarmed strangers and recent acquaintances; on getting\nto know her better they hastily re-armed themselves.  Some one had once\naptly described her as a hedgehog with the protective mimicry of a\npuffball.  If there was an awkward remark to be made at an inconvenient\nmoment before undesired listeners, Joan invariably made it, and when the\noccasion did not present itself she was usually capable of creating it.\nShe was not without a certain popularity, the sort of popularity that a\ndashing highwayman sometimes achieved among those who were not in the\nhabit of travelling on his particular highway.  A great-aunt on her\nmother's side of the family had married so often that Joan imagined\nherself justified in claiming cousin-ship with a large circle of\ndisconnected houses, and treating them all on a relationship footing,\nwhich theoretical kinship enabled her to exact luncheons and other\naccommodations under the plea of keeping the lamp of family life aglow.\n\n\"I felt I simply had to come to-day,\" she chuckled at Yeovil; \"I was just\ndying to see the returned traveller.  Of course, I know perfectly well\nthat neither of you want me, when you haven't seen each other for so long\nand must have heaps and heaps to say to one another, but I thought I\nwould risk the odium of being the third person on an occasion when two\nare company and three are a nuisance.  Wasn't it brave of me?\"\n\nShe spoke in full knowledge of the fact that the luncheon party would not\nin any case have been restricted to Yeovil and his wife, having seen\nRonnie arrive in the hall as she was being shown upstairs.\n\n\"Ronnie Storre is coming, I believe,\" said Cicely, \"so you're not\nbreaking into a tete-a-tete.\"\n\n\"Ronnie, oh I don't count him,\" said Joan gaily; \"he's just a boy who\nlooks nice and eats asparagus.  I hear he's getting to play the piano\nreally well.  Such a pity.  He will grow fat; musicians always do, and it\nwill ruin him.  I speak feelingly because I'm gravitating towards\nplumpness myself.  The Divine Architect turns us out fearfully and\nwonderfully built, and the result is charming to the eye, and then He\nadds another chin and two or three extra inches round the waist, and the\neffect is ruined.  Fortunately you can always find another Ronnie when\nthis one grows fat and uninteresting; the supply of boys who look nice\nand eat asparagus is unlimited.  Hullo, Mr. Storre, we were all talking\nabout you.\"\n\n\"Nothing very damaging, I hope?\" said Ronnie, who had just entered the\nroom.\n\n\"No, we were merely deciding that, whatever you may do with your life,\nyour chin must remain single.  When one's chin begins to lead a double\nlife one's own opportunities for depravity are insensibly narrowed.  You\nneedn't tell me that you haven't any hankerings after depravity; people\nwith your coloured eyes and hair are always depraved.\"\n\n\"Let me introduce you to my husband, Ronnie,\" said Cicely, \"and then\nlet's go and begin lunch.\"\n\n\"You two must almost feel as if you were honeymooning again,\" said Joan\nas they sat down; \"you must have quite forgotten each other's tastes and\npeculiarities since you last met.  Old Emily Fronding was talking about\nyou yesterday, when I mentioned that Murrey was expected home; 'curious\nsort of marriage tie,' she said, in that stupid staring way of hers,\n'when husband and wife spend most of their time in different continents.\nI don't call it marriage at all.'  'Nonsense,' I said, 'it's the best way\nof doing things.  The Yeovils will be a united and devoted couple long\nafter heaps of their married contemporaries have trundled through the\nDivorce Court.'  I forgot at the moment that her youngest girl had\ndivorced her husband last year, and that her second girl is rumoured to\nbe contemplating a similar step.  One can't remember everything.\"\n\nJoan Mardle was remarkable for being able to remember the smallest\ndetails in the family lives of two or three hundred acquaintances.\n\nFrom personal matters she went with a bound to the political small talk\nof the moment.\n\n\"The Official Declaration as to the House of Lords is out at last,\" she\nsaid; \"I bought a paper just before coming here, but I left it in the\nTube.  All existing titles are to lapse if three successive holders,\nincluding the present ones, fail to take the oath of allegiance.\"\n\n\"Have any taken it up to the present?\" asked Yeovil.\n\n\"Only about nineteen, so far, and none of them representing very leading\nfamilies; of course others will come in gradually, as the change of\nDynasty becomes more and more an accepted fact, and of course there will\nbe lots of new creations to fill up the gaps.  I hear for certain that\nPitherby is to get a title of some sort, in recognition of his literary\nlabours.  He has written a short history of the House of Hohenzollern,\nfor use in schools you know, and he's bringing out a popular Life of\nFrederick the Great--at least he hopes it will be popular.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that writing was much in his line,\" said Yeovil, \"beyond\nthe occasional editing of a company prospectus.\"\n\n\"I understand his historical researches have given every satisfaction in\nexalted quarters,\" said Joan; \"something may be lacking in the style,\nperhaps, but the august approval can make good that defect with the style\nof Baron.  Pitherby has such a kind heart; 'kind hearts are more than\ncoronets,' we all know, but the two go quite well together.  And the dear\nman is not content with his services to literature, he's blossoming forth\nas a liberal patron of the arts.  He's taken quite a lot of tickets for\ndear Gorla's debut; half the second row of the dress-circle.\"\n\n\"Do you mean Gorla Mustelford?\" asked Yeovil, catching at the name; \"what\non earth is she having a debut about?\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Joan, in loud-voiced amazement; \"haven't you heard?  Hasn't\nCicely told you?  How funny that you shouldn't have heard.  Why, it's\ngoing to be one of the events of the season.  Everybody's talking about\nit.  She's going to do suggestion dancing at the Caravansery Theatre.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens, what is suggestion dancing?\" asked Yeovil.\n\n\"Oh, something quite new,\" explained Joan; \"at any rate the name is quite\nnew and Gorla is new as far as the public are concerned, and that is\nenough to establish the novelty of the thing.  Among other things she\ndoes a dance suggesting the life of a fern; I saw one of the rehearsals,\nand to me it would have equally well suggested the life of John Wesley.\nHowever, that is probably the fault of my imagination--I've either got\ntoo much or too little.  Anyhow it is an understood thing that she is to\ntake London by storm.\"\n\n\"When I last saw Gorla Mustelford,\" observed Yeovil, \"she was a rather\nserious flapper who thought the world was in urgent need of regeneration\nand was not certain whether she would regenerate it or take up miniature\npainting.  I forget which she attempted ultimately.\"\n\n\"She is quite serious about her art,\" put in Cicely; \"she's studied a\ngood deal abroad and worked hard at mastering the technique of her\nprofession.  She's not a mere amateur with a hankering after the\nfootlights.  I fancy she will do well.\"\n\n\"But what do her people say about it?\" asked Yeovil.\n\n\"Oh, they're simply furious about it,\" answered Joan; \"the idea of a\ndaughter of the house of Mustelford prancing and twisting about the stage\nfor Prussian officers and Hamburg Jews to gaze at is a dreadful cup of\nhumiliation for them.  It's unfortunate, of course, that they should feel\nso acutely about it, but still one can understand their point of view.\"\n\n\"I don't see what other point of view they could possibly take,\" said\nYeovil sharply; \"if Gorla thinks that the necessities of art, or her own\ninclinations, demand that she should dance in public, why can't she do it\nin Paris or even Vienna?  Anywhere would be better, one would think, than\nin London under present conditions.\"\n\nHe had given Joan the indication that she was looking for as to his\nattitude towards the fait accompli.  Without asking a question she had\ndiscovered that husband and wife were divided on the fundamental issue\nthat underlay all others at the present moment.  Cicely was weaving\nsocial schemes for the future, Yeovil had come home in a frame of mind\nthat threatened the destruction of those schemes, or at any rate a\nserious hindrance to their execution.  The situation presented itself to\nJoan's mind with an alluring piquancy.\n\n\"You are giving a grand supper-party for Gorla on the night of her debut,\naren't you?\" she asked Cicely; \"several people spoke to me about it, so I\nsuppose it must be true.\"\n\nTony Luton and young Storre had taken care to spread the news of the\nprojected supper function, in order to ensure against a change of plans\non Cicely's part.\n\n\"Gorla is a great friend of mine,\" said Cicely, trying to talk as if the\nconversation had taken a perfectly indifferent turn; \"also I think she\ndeserves a little encouragement after the hard work she has been through.\nI thought it would be doing her a kindness to arrange a supper party for\nher on her first night.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence.  Yeovil said nothing, and Joan understood\nthe value of being occasionally tongue-tied.\n\n\"The whole question is,\" continued Cicely, as the silence became\noppressive, \"whether one is to mope and hold aloof from the national\nlife, or take our share in it; the life has got to go on whether we\nparticipate in it or not.  It seems to me to be more patriotic to come\ndown into the dust of the marketplace than to withdraw oneself behind\nwalls or beyond the seas.\"\n\n\"Of course the industrial life of the country has to go on,\" said Yeovil;\n\"no one could criticise Gorla if she interested herself in organising\ncottage industries or anything of that sort, in which she would be\nhelping her own people.  That one could understand, but I don't think a\ncosmopolitan concern like the music-hall business calls for personal\nsacrifices from young women of good family at a moment like the present.\"\n\n\"It is just at a moment like the present that the people want something\nto interest them and take them out of themselves,\" said Cicely\nargumentatively; \"what has happened, has happened, and we can't undo it\nor escape the consequences.  What we can do, or attempt to do, is to make\nthings less dreary, and make people less unhappy.\"\n\n\"In a word, more contented,\" said Yeovil; \"if I were a German statesman,\nthat is the end I would labour for and encourage others to labour for, to\nmake the people forget that they were discontented.  All this work of\nregalvanising the social side of London life may be summed up in the\nphrase 'travailler pour le roi de Prusse.'\"\n\n\"I don't think there is any use in discussing the matter further,\" said\nCicely.\n\n\"I can see that grand supper-party not coming off,\" said Joan\nprovocatively.\n\nRonnie looked anxiously at Cicely.\n\n\"You can see it coming on, if you're gifted with prophetic vision of a\nreliable kind,\" said Cicely; \"of course as Murrey doesn't take kindly to\nthe idea of Gorla's enterprise I won't have the party here.  I'll give it\nat a restaurant, that's all.  I can see Murrey's point of view, and\nsympathise with it, but I'm not going to throw Gorla over.\"\n\nThere was another pause of uncomfortably protracted duration.\n\n\"I say, this is a top-hole omelette,\" said Ronnie.\n\nIt was his only contribution to the conversation, but it was a valuable\none.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI: HERR VON KWARL\n\n\nHerr Von Kwarl sat at his favourite table in the Brandenburg Cafe, the\nnew building that made such an imposing show (and did such thriving\nbusiness) at the lower end of what most of its patrons called the\nRegentstrasse.  Though the establishment was new it had already achieved\nits unwritten code of customs, and the sanctity of Herr von Kwarl's\nspecially reserved table had acquired the authority of a tradition.  A\nset of chessmen, a copy of the Kreuz Zeitung and the Times, and a slim-\nnecked bottle of Rhenish wine, ice-cool from the cellar, were always to\nbe found there early in the forenoon, and the honoured guest for whom\nthese preparations were made usually arrived on the scene shortly after\neleven o'clock.  For an hour or so he would read and silently digest the\ncontents of his two newspapers, and then at the first sign of flagging\ninterest on his part, another of the cafe's regular customers would march\nacross the floor, exchange a word or two on the affairs of the day, and\nbe bidden with a wave of the hand into the opposite seat.  A waiter would\ninstantly place the chessboard with its marshalled ranks of combatants in\nthe required position, and the contest would begin.\n\nHerr von Kwarl was a heavily built man of mature middle-age, of the blond\nNorth-German type, with a facial aspect that suggested stupidity and\nbrutality.  The stupidity of his mien masked an ability and shrewdness\nthat was distinctly above the average, and the suggestion of brutality\nwas belied by the fact that von Kwarl was as kind-hearted a man as one\ncould meet with in a day's journey.  Early in life, almost before he was\nin his teens, Fritz von Kwarl had made up his mind to accept the world as\nit was, and to that philosophical resolution, steadfastly adhered to, he\nattributed his excellent digestion and his unruffled happiness.  Perhaps\nhe confused cause and effect; the excellent digestion may have been\nresponsible for at least some of the philosophical serenity.\n\nHe was a bachelor of the type that is called confirmed, and which might\nbetter be labelled consecrated; from his early youth onward to his\npresent age he had never had the faintest flickering intention of\nmarriage.  Children and animals he adored, women and plants he accounted\nsomewhat of a nuisance.  A world without women and roses and asparagus\nwould, he admitted, be robbed of much of its charm, but with all their\ncharm these things were tiresome and thorny and capricious, always\nwanting to climb or creep in places where they were not wanted, and\nresolutely drooping and fading away when they were desired to flourish.\nAnimals, on the other hand, accepted the world as it was and made the\nbest of it, and children, at least nice children, uncontaminated by grown-\nup influences, lived in worlds of their own making.\n\nVon Kwarl held no acknowledged official position in the country of his\nresidence, but it was an open secret that those responsible for the real\ndirection of affairs sought his counsel on nearly every step that they\nmeditated, and that his counsel was very rarely disregarded.  Some of the\nshrewdest and most successful enactments of the ruling power were\nbelieved to have originated in the brain-cells of the bovine-fronted\nStammgast of the Brandenburg Cafe.\n\nAround the wood-panelled walls of the Cafe were set at intervals well-\nmounted heads of boar, elk, stag, roe-buck, and other game-beasts of a\nnorthern forest, while in between were carved armorial escutcheons of the\nprincipal cities of the lately expanded realm, Magdeburg, Manchester,\nHamburg, Bremen, Bristol, and so forth.  Below these came shelves on\nwhich stood a wonderful array of stone beer-mugs, each decorated with\nsome fantastic device or motto, and most of them pertaining individually\nand sacredly to some regular and unfailing customer.  In one particular\ncorner of the highest shelf, greatly at his ease and in nowise to be\ndisturbed, slept Wotan, the huge grey house-cat, dreaming doubtless of\ncertain nimble and audacious mice down in the cellar three floors below,\nwhose nimbleness and audacity were as precious to him as the forwardness\nof the birds is to a skilled gun on a grouse moor.  Once every day Wotan\ncame marching in stately fashion across the polished floor, halted mid-\nway to resume an unfinished toilet operation, and then proceeded to pay\nhis leisurely respects to his friend von Kwarl.  The latter was said to\nbe prouder of this daily demonstration of esteem than of his many coveted\norders of merit.  Several of his friends and acquaintances shared with\nhim the distinction of having achieved the Black Eagle, but not one of\nthem had ever succeeded in obtaining the slightest recognition of their\nexistence from Wotan.\n\nThe daily greeting had been exchanged and the proud grey beast had\nmarched away to the music of a slumberous purr.  The Kreuz Zeitung and\nthe Times underwent a final scrutiny and were pushed aside, and von Kwarl\nglanced aimlessly out at the July sunshine bathing the walls and windows\nof the Piccadilly Hotel.  Herr Rebinok, the plump little Pomeranian\nbanker, stepped across the floor, almost as noiselessly as Wotan had\ndone, though with considerably less grace, and some half-minute later was\nengaged in sliding pawns and knights and bishops to and fro on the chess-\nboard in a series of lightning moves bewildering to look on.  Neither he\nnor his opponent played with the skill that they severally brought to\nbear on banking and statecraft, nor did they conduct their game with the\npoliteness that they punctiliously observed in other affairs of life.  A\nrunning fire of contemptuous remarks and aggressive satire accompanied\neach move, and the mere record of the conversation would have given an\nuninitiated onlooker the puzzling impression that an easy and crushing\nvictory was assured to both the players.\n\n\"Aha, he is puzzled.  Poor man, he doesn't know what to do . . .  Oho, he\nthinks he will move there, does he?  Much good that will do him. . . .\nNever have I seen such a mess as he is in . . . he cannot do anything, he\nis absolutely helpless, helpless.\"\n\n\"Ah, you take my bishop, do you?  Much I care for that.  Nothing.  See, I\ngive you check.  Ah, now he is in a fright!  He doesn't know where to go.\nWhat a mess he is in . . . \"\n\nSo the game proceeded, with a brisk exchange of pieces and incivilities\nand a fluctuation of fortunes, till the little banker lost his queen as\nthe result of an incautious move, and, after several woebegone\ncontortions of his shoulders and hands, declined further contest.  A\nsleek-headed piccolo rushed forward to remove the board, and the\nerstwhile combatants resumed the courteous dignity that they discarded in\ntheir chess-playing moments.\n\n\"Have you seen the Germania to-day?\" asked Herr Rebinok, as soon as the\nboy had receded to a respectful distance.\n\n\"No,\" said von Kwarl, \"I never see the Germania.  I count on you to tell\nme if there is anything noteworthy in it.\"\n\n\"It has an article to-day headed, 'Occupation or Assimilation,'\" said the\nbanker.  \"It is of some importance, and well written.  It is very\npessimistic.\"\n\n\"Catholic papers are always pessimistic about the things of this world,\"\nsaid von Kwarl, \"just as they are unduly optimistic about the things of\nthe next world.  What line does it take?\"\n\n\"It says that our conquest of Britain can only result in a temporary\noccupation, with a 'notice to quit' always hanging over our heads; that\nwe can never hope to assimilate the people of these islands in our Empire\nas a sort of maritime Saxony or Bavaria, all the teaching of history is\nagainst it; Saxony and Bavaria are part of the Empire because of their\npast history.  England is being bound into the Empire in spite of her\npast history; and so forth.\"\n\n\"The writer of the article has not studied history very deeply,\" said von\nKwarl.  \"The impossible thing that he speaks of has been done before, and\ndone in these very islands, too.  The Norman Conquest became an\nassimilation in comparatively few generations.\"\n\n\"Ah, in those days, yes,\" said the banker, \"but the conditions were\naltogether different.  There was not the rapid transmission of news and\nthe means of keeping the public mind instructed in what was happening; in\nfact, one can scarcely say that the public mind was there to instruct.\nThere was not the same strong bond of brotherhood between men of the same\nnation that exists now.  Northumberland was almost as foreign to Devon or\nKent as Normandy was.  And the Church in those days was a great\ninternational factor, and the Crusades bound men together fighting under\none leader for a common cause.  Also there was not a great national past\nto be forgotten as there is in this case.\"\n\n\"There are many factors, certainly, that are against us,\" conceded the\nstatesman, \"but you must also take into account those that will help us.\nIn most cases in recent history where the conquered have stood out\nagainst all attempts at assimilation, there has been a religious\ndifference to add to the racial one--take Poland, for instance, and the\nCatholic parts of Ireland.  If the Bretons ever seriously begin to assert\ntheir nationality as against the French, it will be because they have\nremained more Catholic in practice and sentiment than their neighbours.\nHere there is no such complication; we are in the bulk a Protestant\nnation with a Catholic minority, and the same may be said of the British.\nThen in modern days there is the alchemy of Sport and the Drama to bring\nmen of different races amicably together.  One or two sportsmanlike\nGermans in a London football team will do more to break down racial\nantagonism than anything that Governments or Councils can effect.  As for\nthe Stage, it has long been international in its tendencies.  You can see\nthat every day.\"\n\nThe banker nodded his head.\n\n\"London is not our greatest difficulty,\" continued von Kwarl.  \"You must\nremember the steady influx of Germans since the war; whole districts are\nchanging the complexion of their inhabitants, and in some streets you\nmight almost fancy yourself in a German town.  We can scarcely hope to\nmake much impression on the country districts and the provincial towns at\npresent, but you must remember that thousands and thousands of the more\nvirile and restless-souled men have emigrated, and thousands more will\nfollow their example.  We shall fill up their places with our own surplus\npopulation, as the Teuton races colonised England in the old\npre-Christian days.  That is better, is it not, to people the fat meadows\nof the Thames valley and the healthy downs and uplands of Sussex and\nBerkshire than to go hunting for elbow-room among the flies and fevers of\nthe tropics?  We have somewhere to go to, now, better than the scrub and\nthe veldt and the thorn-jungles.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" assented Herr Rebinok, \"but while this desirable\nprocess of infiltration and assimilation goes on, how are you going to\nprovide against the hostility of the conquered nation?  A people with a\ngreat tradition behind them and the ruling instinct strongly developed,\nwon't sit with their eyes closed and their hands folded while you carry\non the process of Germanisation.  What will keep them quiet?\"\n\n\"The hopelessness of the situation.  For centuries Britain has ruled the\nseas, and been able to dictate to half the world in consequence; then she\nlet slip the mastery of the seas, as something too costly and onerous to\nkeep up, something which aroused too much jealousy and uneasiness in\nothers, and now the seas rule her.  Every wave that breaks on her shore\nrattles the keys of her prison.  I am no fire-eater, Herr Rebinok, but I\nconfess that when I am at Dover, say, or Southampton, and see those dark\nblots on the sea and those grey specks in the sky, our battleships and\ncruisers and aircraft, and realise what they mean to us my heart beats\njust a little quicker.  If every German was flung out of England\nto-morrow, in three weeks' time we should be coming in again on our own\nterms.  With our sea scouts and air scouts spread in organised network\naround, not a shipload of foodstuff could reach the country.  They know\nthat; they can calculate how many days of independence and starvation\nthey could endure, and they will make no attempt to bring about such a\ncertain fiasco.  Brave men fight for a forlorn hope, but the bravest do\nnot fight for an issue they know to be hopeless.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" said Herr Rebinok, \"as things are at present they can do\nnothing from within, absolutely nothing.  We have weighed all that\nbeforehand.  But, as the Germania points out, there is another Britain\nbeyond the seas.  Supposing the Court at Delhi were to engineer a\nleague--\"\n\n\"A league?  A league with whom?\" interrupted the statesman.  \"Russia we\ncan watch and hold.  We are rather nearer to its western frontier than\nDelhi is, and we could throttle its Baltic trade at five hours' notice.\nFrance and Holland are not inclined to provoke our hostility; they would\nhave everything to lose by such a course.\"\n\n\"There are other forces in the world that might be arrayed against us,\"\nargued the banker; \"the United States, Japan, Italy, they all have\nnavies.\"\n\n\"Does the teaching of history show you that it is the strong Power, armed\nand ready, that has to suffer from the hostility of the world?\" asked von\nKwarl.  \"As far as sentiment goes, perhaps, but not in practice.  The\ndanger has always been for the weak, dismembered nation.  Think you a\nmoment, has the enfeebled scattered British Empire overseas no undefended\nterritories that are a temptation to her neighbours?  Has Japan nothing\nto glean where we have harvested?  Are there no North American\npossessions which might slip into other keeping?  Has Russia herself no\ntraditional temptations beyond the Oxus?  Mind you, we are not making the\nmistake Napoleon made, when he forced all Europe to be for him or against\nhim.  We threaten no world aggressions, we are satiated where he was\ninsatiable.  We have cast down one overshadowing Power from the face of\nthe world, because it stood in our way, but we have made no attempt to\nspread our branches over all the space that it covered.  We have not\ntried to set up a tributary Canadian republic or to partition South\nAfrica; we have dreamed no dream of making ourselves Lords of Hindostan.\nOn the contrary, we have given proof of our friendly intentions towards\nour neighbours.  We backed France up the other day in her squabble with\nSpain over the Moroccan boundaries, and proclaimed our opinion that the\nRepublic had as indisputable a mission on the North Africa coast as we\nhave in the North Sea.  That is not the action or the language of\naggression.  No,\" continued von Kwarl, after a moment's silence, \"the\nworld may fear us and dislike us, but, for the present at any rate, there\nwill be no leagues against us.  No, there is one rock on which our\nattempt at assimilation will founder or find firm anchorage.\"\n\n\"And that is--?\"\n\n\"The youth of the country, the generation that is at the threshold now.\nIt is them that we must capture.  We must teach them to learn, and coax\nthem to forget.  In course of time Anglo-Saxon may blend with German, as\nthe Elbe Saxons and the Bavarians and Swabians have blended with the\nPrussians into a loyal united people under the sceptre of the\nHohenzollerns.  Then we should be doubly strong, Rome and Carthage rolled\ninto one, an Empire of the West greater than Charlemagne ever knew.  Then\nwe could look Slav and Latin and Asiatic in the face and keep our place\nas the central dominant force of the civilised world.\"\n\nThe speaker paused for a moment and drank a deep draught of wine, as\nthough he were invoking the prosperity of that future world-power.  Then\nhe resumed in a more level tone:\n\n\"On the other hand, the younger generation of Britons may grow up in\nhereditary hatred, repulsing all our overtures, forgetting nothing and\nforgiving nothing, waiting and watching for the time when some weakness\nassails us, when some crisis entangles us, when we cannot be everywhere\nat once.  Then our work will be imperilled, perhaps undone.  There lies\nthe danger, there lies the hope, the younger generation.\"\n\n\"There is another danger,\" said the banker, after he had pondered over\nvon Kwarl's remarks for a moment or two amid the incense-clouds of a fat\ncigar; \"a danger that I foresee in the immediate future; perhaps not so\nmuch a danger as an element of exasperation which may ultimately defeat\nyour plans.  The law as to military service will have to be promulgated\nshortly, and that cannot fail to be bitterly unpopular.  The people of\nthese islands will have to be brought into line with the rest of the\nEmpire in the matter of military training and military service, and how\nwill they like that?  Will not the enforcing of such a measure enfuriate\nthem against us?  Remember, they have made great sacrifices to avoid the\nburden of military service.\"\n\n\"Dear God,\" exclaimed Herr von Kwarl, \"as you say, they have made\nsacrifices on that altar!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII: THE LURE\n\n\nCicely had successfully insisted on having her own way concerning the\nprojected supper-party; Yeovil had said nothing further in opposition to\nit, whatever his feelings on the subject might be.  Having gained her\npoint, however, she was anxious to give her husband the impression of\nhaving been consulted, and to put her victory as far as possible on the\nfooting of a compromise.  It was also rather a relief to be able to\ndiscuss the matter out of range of Joan's disconcerting tongue and\nobservant eyes.\n\n\"I hope you are not really annoyed about this silly supper-party,\" she\nsaid on the morning before the much-talked-of first night.  \"I had\npledged myself to give it, so I couldn't back out without seeming mean to\nGorla, and in any case it would have been impolitic to cry off.\"\n\n\"Why impolitic?\" asked Yeovil coldly.\n\n\"It would give offence in quarters where I don't want to give offence,\"\nsaid Cicely.\n\n\"In quarters where the fait accompli is an object of solicitude,\" said\nYeovil.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Cicely in her most disarming manner, \"it's just as well\nto be perfectly frank about the whole matter.  If one wants to live in\nthe London of the present day one must make up one's mind to accept the\nfait accompli with as good a grace as possible.  I do want to live in\nLondon, and I don't want to change my way of living and start under\ndifferent conditions in some other place.  I can't face the prospect of\ntearing up my life by the roots; I feel certain that I shouldn't bear\ntransplanting.  I can't imagine myself recreating my circle of interests\nin some foreign town or colonial centre or even in a country town in\nEngland.  India I couldn't stand.  London is not merely a home to me, it\nis a world, and it happens to be just the world that suits me and that I\nam suited to.  The German occupation, or whatever one likes to call it,\nis a calamity, but it's not like a molten deluge from Vesuvius that need\nsend us all scuttling away from another Pompeii.  Of course,\" she added,\n\"there are things that jar horribly on one, even when one has got more or\nless accustomed to them, but one must just learn to be philosophical and\nbear them.\"\n\n\"Supposing they are not bearable?\" said Yeovil; \"during the few days that\nI've been in the land I've seen things that I cannot imagine will ever be\nbearable.\"\n\n\"That is because they're new to you,\" said Cicely.\n\n\"I don't wish that they should ever come to seem bearable,\" retorted\nYeovil.  \"I've been bred and reared as a unit of a ruling race; I don't\nwant to find myself settling down resignedly as a member of an enslaved\none.\"\n\n\"There's no need to make things out worse than they are,\" protested\nCicely.  \"We've had a military disaster on a big scale, and there's been\na great political dislocation in consequence.  But there's no reason why\neverything shouldn't right itself in time, as it has done after other\nsimilar disasters in the history of nations.  We are not scattered to the\nwinds or wiped off the face of the earth, we are still an important\nracial unit.\"\n\n\"A racial unit in a foreign Empire,\" commented Yeovil.\n\n\"We may arrive at the position of being the dominant factor in that\nEmpire,\" said Cicely, \"impressing our national characteristics on it, and\nperhaps dictating its dynastic future and the whole trend of its policy.\nSuch things have happened in history.  Or we may become strong enough to\nthrow off the foreign connection at a moment when it can be done\neffectually and advantageously.  But meanwhile it is necessary to\npreserve our industrial life and our social life, and for that reason we\nmust accommodate ourselves to present circumstances, however distasteful\nthey may be.  Emigration to some colonial wilderness, or holding\nourselves rigidly aloof from the life of the capital, won't help matters.\nReally, Murrey, if you will think things over a bit, you will see that\nthe course I am following is the one dictated by sane patriotism.\"\n\n\"Whom the gods wish to render harmless they first afflict with sanity,\"\nsaid Yeovil bitterly.  \"You may be content to wait for a hundred years or\nso, for this national revival to creep and crawl us back into a semblance\nof independence and world-importance.  I'm afraid I haven't the patience\nor the philosophy to sit down comfortably and wait for a change of\nfortune that won't come in my time--if it comes at all.\"\n\nCicely changed the drift of the conversation; she had only introduced the\nargument for the purpose of defining her point of view and accustoming\nYeovil to it, as one leads a nervous horse up to an unfamiliar barrier\nthat he is required eventually to jump.\n\n\"In any case,\" she said, \"from the immediately practical standpoint\nEngland is the best place for you till you have shaken off all traces of\nthat fever.  Pass the time away somehow till the hunting begins, and then\ngo down to the East Wessex country; they are looking out for a new master\nafter this season, and if you were strong enough you might take it on for\na while.  You could go to Norway for fishing in the summer and hunt the\nEast Wessex in the winter.  I'll come down and do a bit of hunting too,\nand we'll have house-parties, and get a little golf in between whiles.  It\nwill be like old times.\"\n\nYeovil looked at his wife and laughed.\n\n\"Who was that old fellow who used to hunt his hounds regularly through\nthe fiercest times of the great Civil War?  There is a picture of him, by\nCaton Woodville, I think, leading his pack between King Charles's army\nand the Parliament forces just as some battle was going to begin.  I have\noften thought that the King must have disliked him rather more than he\ndisliked the men who were in arms against him; they at least cared, one\nway or the other.  I fancy that old chap would have a great many\nimitators nowadays, though, when it came to be a question of sport\nagainst soldiering.  I don't know whether anyone has said it, but one\nmight almost assert that the German victory was won on the golf-links of\nBritain.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you should saddle one particular form of sport with a\nspecial responsibility,\" protested Cicely.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Yeovil, \"except that it absorbed perhaps more of\nthe energy and attention of the leisured class than other sports did, and\nin this country the leisured class was the only bulwark we had against\nofficial indifference.  The working classes had a big share of the\napathy, and, indirectly, a greater share of the responsibility, because\nthe voting power was in their hands.  They had not the leisure, however,\nto sit down and think clearly what the danger was; their own industrial\nwarfare was more real to them than anything that was threatening from the\nnation that they only knew from samples of German clerks and German\nwaiters.\"\n\n\"In any case,\" said Cicely, \"as regards the hunting, there is no Civil\nWar or national war raging just now, and there is no immediate likelihood\nof one.  A good many hunting seasons will have to come and go before we\ncan think of a war of independence as even a distant possibility, and in\nthe meantime hunting and horse-breeding and country sports generally are\nthe things most likely to keep Englishmen together on the land.  That is\nwhy so many men who hate the German occupation are trying to keep field\nsports alive, and in the right hands.  However, I won't go on arguing.\nYou and I always think things out for ourselves and decide for ourselves,\nwhich is much the best way in the long run.\"\n\nCicely slipped away to her writing-room to make final arrangements over\nthe telephone for the all-important supper-party, leaving Yeovil to turn\nover in his mind the suggestion that she had thrown out.  It was an\nobvious lure, a lure to draw him away from the fret and fury that\npossessed him so inconveniently, but its obvious nature did not detract\nfrom its effectiveness.  Yeovil had pleasant recollections of the East\nWessex, a cheery little hunt that afforded good sport in an unpretentious\nmanner, a joyous thread of life running through a rather sleepy\ncountryside, like a merry brook careering through a placid valley.  For a\nman coming slowly and yet eagerly back to the activities of life from the\nweariness of a long fever, the prospect of a leisurely season with the\nEast Wessex was singularly attractive, and side by side with its\nattractiveness there was a tempting argument in favour of yielding to its\nattractions.  Among the small squires and yeoman farmers, doctors,\ncountry tradesmen, auctioneers and so forth who would gather at the\ncovert-side and at the hunt breakfasts, there might be a local nucleus of\nrevolt against the enslavement of the land, a discouraged and leaderless\nband waiting for some one to mould their resistance into effective shape\nand keep their loyalty to the old dynasty and the old national cause\nsteadily burning.  Yeovil could see himself taking up that position,\nstimulating the spirit of hostility to the fait accompli, organising\nstubborn opposition to every Germanising influence that was brought into\nplay, schooling the youth of the countryside to look steadily Delhiward.\nThat was the bait that Yeovil threw out to his conscience, while slowly\nconsidering the other bait that was appealing so strongly to his senses.\nThe dry warm scent of the stable, the nip of the morning air, the\npleasant squelch-squelch of the saddle leather, the moist earthy\nfragrance of the autumn woods and wet fallows, the cold white mists of\nwinter days, the whimper of hounds and the hot restless pushing of the\npack through ditch and hedgerow and undergrowth, the birds that flew up\nand clucked and chattered as you passed, the hearty greeting and pleasant\ngossip in farmhouse kitchens and market-day bar-parlours--all these\nremembered delights of the chase marshalled themselves in the brain, and\nmade a cumulative appeal that came with special intensity to a man who\nwas a little tired of his wanderings, more than a little drawn away from\nthe jarring centres of life.  The hot London sunshine baking the soot-\ngrimed walls and the ugly incessant hoot and grunt of the motor traffic\ngave an added charm to the vision of hill and hollow and copse that\nflickered in Yeovil's mind.  Slowly, with a sensuous lingering over\ndetail, his imagination carried him down to a small, sleepy, yet withal\npleasantly bustling market town, and placed him unerringly in a wide\nstraw-littered yard, half-full of men and quarter-full of horses, with a\nbob-tailed sheep-dog or two trying not to get in everybody's way, but\ninsisting on being in the thick of things.  The horses gradually detached\nthemselves from the crowd of unimportant men and came one by one into\nmomentary prominence, to be discussed and appraised for their good points\nand bad points, and finally to be bid for.  And always there was one\nhorse that detached itself conspicuously from the rest, the ideal hunter,\nor at any rate, Yeovil's ideal of the ideal hunter.  Mentally it was put\nthrough its paces before him, its pedigree and brief history recounted to\nhim; mentally he saw a stable lad put it over a jump or two, with credit\nto all concerned, and inevitably he saw himself outbidding less\ndiscerning rivals and securing the desired piece of horseflesh, to be the\nchief glory and mainstay of his hunting stable, to carry him well and\ntruly and cleverly through many a joyous long-to-be-remembered run.  That\nscene had been one of the recurring half-waking dreams of his long days\nof weakness in the far-away Finnish nursing-home, a dream sometimes of\ntantalising mockery, sometimes of pleasure in the foretaste of a joy to\ncome.  And now it need scarcely be a dream any longer, he had only to go\ndown at the right moment and take an actual part in his oft-rehearsed\nvision.  Everything would be there, exactly as his imagination had placed\nit, even down to the bob-tailed sheep-dogs; the horse of his imagining\nwould be there waiting for him, or if not absolutely the ideal animal,\nsomething very like it.  He might even go beyond the limits of his dream\nand pick up a couple of desirable animals--there would probably be fewer\npurchasers for good class hunters in these days than of yore.  And with\nthe coming of this reflection his dream faded suddenly and his mind came\nback with a throb of pain to the things he had for the moment forgotten,\nthe weary, hateful things that were symbolised for him by the standard\nthat floated yellow and black over the frontage of Buckingham Palace.\n\nYeovil wandered down to his snuggery, a mood of listless dejection\npossessing him.  He fidgetted aimlessly with one or two books and papers,\nfilled a pipe, and half filled a waste-paper basket with torn circulars\nand accumulated writing-table litter.  Then he lit the pipe and settled\ndown in his most comfortable armchair with an old note-book in his hand.\nIt was a sort of disjointed diary, running fitfully through the winter\nmonths of some past years, and recording noteworthy days with the East\nWessex.\n\nAnd over the telephone Cicely talked and arranged and consulted with men\nand women to whom the joys of a good gallop or the love of a stricken\nfatherland were as letters in an unknown alphabet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII: THE FIRST-NIGHT\n\n\nHuge posters outside the Caravansery Theatre of Varieties announced the\nfirst performance of the uniquely interesting Suggestion Dances,\ninterpreted by the Hon. Gorla Mustelford.  An impressionist portrait of a\nrather severe-looking young woman gave the public some idea of what the\ndanseuse might be like in appearance, and the further information was\nadded that her performance was the greatest dramatic event of the season.\nYet another piece of information was conveyed to the public a few minutes\nafter the doors had opened, in the shape of large notices bearing the\nbrief announcement, \"house full.\"  For the first-night function most of\nthe seats had been reserved for specially-invited guests or else bespoken\nby those who considered it due to their own importance to be visible on\nsuch an occasion.\n\nEven at the commencement of the ordinary programme of the evening (Gorla\nwas not due to appear till late in the list) the theatre was crowded with\na throng of chattering, expectant human beings; it seemed as though every\none had come early to see every one else arrive.  As a matter of fact it\nwas the rumour-heralded arrival of one personage in particular that had\ndrawn people early to their seats and given a double edge to the\nexpectancy of the moment.\n\nAt first sight and first hearing the bulk of the audience seemed to\ncomprise representatives of the chief European races in well-distributed\nproportions, but if one gave it closer consideration it could be seen\nthat the distribution was geographically rather than ethnographically\ndiversified.  Men and women there were from Paris, Munich, Rome, Moscow\nand Vienna, from Sweden and Holland and divers other cities and\ncountries, but in the majority of cases the Jordan Valley had supplied\ntheir forefathers with a common cradle-ground.  The lack of a fire\nburning on a national altar seemed to have drawn them by universal\nimpulse to the congenial flare of the footlights, whether as artists,\nproducers, impresarios, critics, agents, go-betweens, or merely as highly\nintelligent and fearsomely well-informed spectators.  They were prominent\nin the chief seats, they were represented, more sparsely but still in\nfair numbers, in the cheaper places, and everywhere they were voluble,\nemphatic, sanguine or sceptical, prodigal of word and gesture, with eyes\nthat seemed to miss nothing and acknowledge nothing, and a general\nrestless dread of not being seen and noticed.  Of the theatre-going\nLondon public there was also a fair muster, more particularly centred in\nthe less expensive parts of the house, while in boxes, stalls and circles\na sprinkling of military uniforms gave an unfamiliar tone to the scene in\nthe eyes of those who had not previously witnessed a first-night\nperformance under the new conditions.\n\nYeovil, while standing aloof from his wife's participation in this social\nevent, had made private arrangements for being a personal spectator of\nthe scene; as one of the ticket-buying public he had secured a seat in\nthe back row of a low-priced gallery, whence he might watch, observant\nand unobserved, the much talked-of debut of Gorla Mustelford, and the\nwriting of a new chapter in the history of the fait accompli.  Around him\nhe noticed an incessant undercurrent of jangling laughter, an unending\ngive-and-take of meaningless mirthless jest and catchword.  He had\nnoticed the same thing in streets and public places since his arrival in\nLondon, a noisy, empty interchange of chaff and laughter that he had been\nat a loss to account for.  The Londoner is not well adapted for the\nirresponsible noisiness of jesting tongue that bubbles up naturally in a\nSouthern race, and the effort to be volatile was the more noticeable\nbecause it so obviously was an effort.  Turning over the pages of a book\nthat told the story of Bulgarian social life in the days of Turkish rule,\nYeovil had that morning come across a passage that seemed to throw some\nlight on the thing that had puzzled him:\n\n\"Bondage has this one advantage: it makes a nation merry.  Where\nfar-reaching ambition has no scope for its development the community\nsquanders its energy on the trivial and personal cares of its daily life,\nand seeks relief and recreation in simple and easily obtained material\nenjoyment.\"  The writer was a man who had known bondage, so he spoke at\nany rate with authority.  Of the London of the moment it could not,\nhowever, be said with any truth that it was merry, but merely that its\ninhabitants made desperate endeavour not to appear crushed under their\ncatastrophe.  Surrounded as he was now with a babble of tongues and\nshrill mechanical repartee, Yeovil's mind went back to the book and its\naccount of a theatre audience in the Turkish days of Bulgaria, with its\nlight and laughing crowd of critics and spectators.  Bulgaria!  The\nthought of that determined little nation came to him with a sharp sense\nof irony.  There was a people who had not thought it beneath the dignity\nof their manhood to learn the trade and discipline of arms.  They had\ntheir reward; torn and exhausted and debt-encumbered from their\ncampaigns, they were masters in their own house, the Bulgarian flag flew\nover the Bulgarian mountains.  And Yeovil stole a glance at the crown of\nCharlemagne set over the Royal box.\n\nIn a capacious box immediately opposite the one set aside for royalty the\nLady Shalem sat in well-considered prominence, confident that every press\ncritic and reporter would note her presence, and that one or two of them\nwould describe, or misdescribe, her toilet.  Already quite a considerable\nsection of the audience knew her by name, and the frequency with which\nshe graciously nodded towards various quarters of the house suggested the\npresence of a great many personal acquaintances.  She had attained to\nthat desirable feminine altitude of purse and position when people who go\nabout everywhere know you well by sight and have never met your dress\nbefore.\n\nLady Shalem was a woman of commanding presence, of that type which\nsuggests a consciousness that the command may not necessarily be obeyed;\nshe had observant eyes and a well-managed voice.  Her successes in life\nhad been worked for, but they were also to some considerable extent the\nresult of accident.  Her public history went back to the time when, in\nthe person of her husband, Mr. Conrad Dort, she had contested two\nhopeless and very expensive Parliamentary elections on behalf of her\nparty; on each occasion the declaration of the poll had shown a heavy\nthough reduced majority on the wrong side, but she might have perpetrated\nan apt misquotation of the French monarch's traditional message after the\ndefeat of Pavia, and assured the world \"all is lost save honours.\"  The\nforthcoming Honours List had duly proclaimed the fact that Conrad Dort,\nEsquire, had entered Parliament by another door as Baron Shalem, of\nWireskiln, in the county of Suffolk.  Success had crowned the lady's\nefforts as far as the achievement of the title went, but her social\nambitions seemed unlikely to make further headway.  The new Baron and his\nwife, their title and money notwithstanding, did not \"go down\" in their\nparticular segment of county society, and in London there were other\ntitles and incomes to compete with.  People were willing to worship the\nGolden Calf, but allowed themselves a choice of altars.  No one could\njustly say that the Shalems were either oppressively vulgar or\ninsufferably bumptious; probably the chief reason for their lack of\npopularity was their intense and obvious desire to be popular.  They kept\nopen house in such an insistently open manner that they created a social\ndraught.  The people who accepted their invitations for the second or\nthird time were not the sort of people whose names gave importance to a\ndinner party or a house gathering.  Failure, in a thinly-disguised form,\nattended the assiduous efforts of the Shalems to play a leading role in\nthe world that they had climbed into.  The Baron began to observe to his\nacquaintances that \"gadding about\" and entertaining on a big scale was\nnot much in his line; a quiet after-dinner pipe and talk with some\nbrother legislator was his ideal way of spending an evening.\n\nThen came the great catastrophe, involving the old order of society in\nthe national overthrow.  Lady Shalem, after a decent interval of\npatriotic mourning, began to look around her and take stock of her\nchances and opportunities under the new regime.  It was easier to achieve\ndistinction as a titled oasis in the social desert that London had become\nthan it had been to obtain recognition as a new growth in a rather\novercrowded field.  The observant eyes and agile brain quickly noted this\ncircumstance, and her ladyship set to work to adapt herself to the\naltered conditions that governed her world.  Lord Shalem was one of the\nfew Peers who kissed the hand of the new Sovereign, his wife was one of\nthe few hostesses who attempted to throw a semblance of gaiety and lavish\nelegance over the travesty of a London season following the year of\ndisaster.  The world of tradesmen and purveyors and caterers, and the\nthousands who were dependent on them for employment, privately blessed\nthe example set by Shalem House, whatever their feelings might be towards\nthe fait accompli, and the august newcomer who had added an old Saxon\nkingdom and some of its accretions to the Teutonic realm of Charlemagne\nwas duly beholden to an acquired subject who was willing to forget the\nbitterness of defeat and to help others to forget it also.  Among other\nacts of Imperial recognition an earldom was being held in readiness for\nthe Baron who had known how to accept accomplished facts with a good\ngrace.  One of the wits of the Cockatrice Club had asserted that the new\nearl would take as supporters for his coat of arms a lion and a unicorn\noublie.\n\nIn the box with Lady Shalem was the Grafin von Tolb, a well-dressed woman\nof some fifty-six years, comfortable and placid in appearance, yet alert\nwithal, rather suggesting a thoroughly wide-awake dormouse.  Rich,\namiable and intelligent were the adjectives which would best have\ndescribed her character and her life-story.  In her own rather difficult\nsocial circle at Paderborn she had earned for herself the reputation of\nbeing one of the most tactful and discerning hostesses in Germany, and it\nwas generally suspected that she had come over and taken up her residence\nin London in response to a wish expressed in high quarters; the lavish\nhospitality which she dispensed at her house in Berkeley Square was a\nconsiderable reinforcement to the stricken social life of the metropolis.\n\nIn a neighbouring box Cicely Yeovil presided over a large and lively\nparty, which of course included Ronnie Storre, who was for once in a way\nin a chattering mood, and also included an American dowager, who had\nnever been known to be in anything else.  A tone of literary distinction\nwas imparted to the group by the presence of Augusta Smith, better known\nunder her pen-name of Rhapsodic Pantril, author of a play that had had a\nlimited but well-advertised success in Sheffield and the United States of\nAmerica, author also of a book of reminiscences, entitled \"Things I\nCannot Forget.\"  She had beautiful eyes, a knowledge of how to dress, and\na pleasant disposition, cankered just a little by a perpetual dread of\nthe non-recognition of her genius.  As the woman, Augusta Smith, she\nprobably would have been unreservedly happy; as the super-woman,\nRhapsodic Pantril, she lived within the border-line of discontent.  Her\nmost ordinary remarks were framed with the view of arresting attention;\nsome one once said of her that she ordered a sack of potatoes with the\nair of one who is making enquiry for a love-philtre.\n\n\"Do you see what colour the curtain is?\" she asked Cicely, throwing a\nnote of intense meaning into her question.\n\nCicely turned quickly and looked at the drop-curtain.\n\n\"Rather a nice blue,\" she said.\n\n\"Alexandrine blue--my colour--the colour of hope,\" said Rhapsodie\nimpressively.\n\n\"It goes well with the general colour-scheme,\" said Cicely, feeling that\nshe was hardly rising to the occasion.\n\n\"Say, is it really true that His Majesty is coming?\" asked the lively\nAmerican dowager.  \"I've put on my nooest frock and my best diamonds on\npurpose, and I shall be mortified to death if he doesn't see them.\"\n\n\"There!\" pouted Ronnie, \"I felt certain you'd put them on for me.\"\n\n\"Why no, I should have put on rubies and orange opals for you.  People\nwith our colour of hair always like barbaric display--\"\n\n\"They don't,\" said Ronnie, \"they have chaste cold tastes.  You are\nabsolutely mistaken.\"\n\n\"Well, I think I ought to know!\" protested the dowager; \"I've lived\nlonger in the world than you have, anyway.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ronnie with devastating truthfulness, \"but my hair has been\nthis colour longer than yours has.\"\n\nPeace was restored by the opportune arrival of a middle-aged man of blond\nNorth-German type, with an expression of brutality on his rather stupid\nface, who sat in the front of the box for a few minutes on a visit of\nceremony to Cicely.  His appearance caused a slight buzz of recognition\namong the audience, and if Yeovil had cared to make enquiry of his\nneighbours he might have learned that this decorated and obviously\nimportant personage was the redoubtable von Kwarl, artificer and shaper\nof much of the statecraft for which other men got the public credit.\n\nThe orchestra played a selection from the \"Gondola Girl,\" which was the\nleading musical-comedy of the moment.  Most of the audience, those in the\nmore expensive seats at any rate, heard the same airs two or three times\ndaily, at restaurant lunches, teas, dinners and suppers, and occasionally\nin the Park; they were justified therefore in treating the music as a\nbackground to slightly louder conversation than they had hitherto\nindulged in.  The music came to an end, episode number two in the\nevening's entertainment was signalled, the curtain of Alexandrine blue\nrolled heavily upward, and a troupe of performing wolves was presented to\nthe public.  Yeovil had encountered wolves in North Africa deserts and in\nSiberian forest and wold, he had seen them at twilight stealing like dark\nshadows across the snow, and heard their long whimpering howl in the\ndarkness amid the pines; he could well understand how a magic lore had\ngrown up round them through the ages among the peoples of four\ncontinents, how their name had passed into a hundred strange sayings and\ninspired a hundred traditions.  And now he saw them ride round the stage\non tricycles, with grotesque ruffles round their necks and clown caps on\ntheir heads, their eyes blinking miserably in the blaze of the\nfootlights.  In response to the applause of the house a stout,\natrociously smiling man in evening dress came forward and bowed; he had\nhad nothing to do either with the capture or the training of the animals,\nhaving bought them ready for use from a continental emporium where wild\nbeasts were prepared for the music-hall market, but he continued bowing\nand smiling till the curtain fell.\n\nTwo American musicians with comic tendencies (denoted by the elaborate\nrags and tatters of their costumes) succeeded the wolves.  Their musical\nperformance was not without merit, but their comic \"business\" seemed to\nhave been invented long ago by some man who had patented a monopoly of\nall music-hall humour and forthwith retired from the trade.  Some day,\nYeovil reflected, the rights of the monopoly might expire and new\n\"business\" become available for the knockabout profession.\n\nThe audience brightened considerably when item number five of the\nprogramme was signalled.  The orchestra struck up a rollicking measure\nand Tony Luton made his entrance amid a rousing storm of applause.  He\nwas dressed as an errand-boy of some West End shop, with a livery and box-\ntricycle, as spruce and decorative as the most ambitious errand-boy could\nsee himself in his most ambitious dreams.  His song was a lively and very\naudacious chronicle of life behind the scenes of a big retail\nestablishment, and sparkled with allusions which might fitly have been\ndescribed as suggestive--at any rate they appeared to suggest meanings to\nthe audience quite as clearly as Gorla Mustelford's dances were likely to\ndo, even with the aid, in her case, of long explanations on the\nprogrammes.  When the final verse seemed about to reach an unpardonable\nclimax a stage policeman opportunely appeared and moved the lively\nsongster on for obstructing the imaginary traffic of an imaginary Bond\nStreet.  The house received the new number with genial enthusiasm, and\nmingled its applause with demands for an earlier favourite.  The\norchestra struck up the familiar air, and in a few moments the smart\nerrand-boy, transformed now into a smart jockey, was singing \"They quaff\nthe gay bubbly in Eccleston Square\" to an audience that hummed and nodded\nits unstinted approval.\n\nThe next number but one was the Gorla Mustelford debut, and the house\nsettled itself down to yawn and fidget and chatter for ten or twelve\nminutes while a troupe of talented Japanese jugglers performed some\nartistic and quite uninteresting marvels with fans and butterflies and\nlacquer boxes.  The interval of waiting was not destined, however, to be\nwithout its interest; in its way it provided the one really important and\ndramatic moment of the evening.  One or two uniforms and evening\ntoilettes had already made their appearance in the Imperial box; now\nthere was observable in that quarter a slight commotion, an unobtrusive\nreshuffling and reseating, and then every eye in the suddenly quiet semi-\ndarkened house focussed itself on one figure.  There was no public\ndemonstration from the newly-loyal, it had been particularly wished that\nthere should be none, but a ripple of whisper went through the vast\naudience from end to end.  Majesty had arrived.  The Japanese\nmarvel-workers went through their display with even less attention than\nbefore.  Lady Shalem, sitting well in the front of her box, lowered her\nobservant eyes to her programme and her massive bangles.  The evidence of\nher triumph did not need staring at.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX: AN EVENING \"TO BE REMEMBERED\"\n\n\nTo the uninitiated or unappreciative the dancing of Gorla Mustelford did\nnot seem widely different from much that had been exhibited aforetime by\nexponents of the posturing school.  She was not naturally graceful of\nmovement, she had not undergone years of arduous tutelage, she had not\nthe instinct for sheer joyous energy of action that is stored in some\nnatures; out of these unpromising negative qualities she had produced a\nstyle of dancing that might best be labelled a conscientious departure\nfrom accepted methods.  The highly imaginative titles that she had\nbestowed on her dances, the \"Life of a fern,\" the \"Soul-dream of a\ntopaz,\" and so forth, at least gave her audience and her critics\nsomething to talk about.  In themselves they meant absolutely nothing,\nbut they induced discussion, and that to Gorla meant a great deal.  It\nwas a season of dearth and emptiness in the footlights and box-office\nworld, and her performance received a welcome that would scarcely have\nbefallen it in a more crowded and prosperous day.  Her success, indeed,\nhad been waiting for her, ready-made, as far as the managerial profession\nwas concerned, and nothing had been left undone in the way of\nadvertisement to secure for it the appearance, at any rate, of popular\nfavour.  And loud above the interested applause of those who had personal\nor business motives for acclaiming a success swelled the exaggerated\nenthusiasm of the fairly numerous art-satellites who are unstinted in\ntheir praise of anything that they are certain they cannot understand.\nWhatever might be the subsequent verdict of the theatre-filling public\nthe majority of the favoured first-night audience was determined to set\nthe seal of its approval on the suggestion dances, and a steady roll of\napplause greeted the conclusion of each item.  The dancer gravely bowed\nher thanks; in marked contradistinction to the gentleman who had\n\"presented\" the performing wolves she did not permit herself the luxury\nof a smile.\n\n\"It teaches us a great deal,\" said Rhapsodic Pantril vaguely, but\nimpressively, after the Fern dance had been given and applauded.\n\n\"At any rate we know now that a fern takes life very seriously,\" broke in\nJoan Mardle, who had somehow wriggled herself into Cicely's box.\n\nAs Yeovil, from the back of his gallery, watched Gorla running and\nricochetting about the stage, looking rather like a wagtail in energetic\npursuit of invisible gnats and midges, he wondered how many of the middle-\naged women who were eagerly applauding her would have taken the least\nnotice of similar gymnastics on the part of their offspring in nursery or\ngarden, beyond perhaps asking them not to make so much noise.  And a\nbitterer tinge came to his thoughts as he saw the bouquets being handed\nup, thoughts of the brave old dowager down at Torywood, the woman who had\nworked and wrought so hard and so unsparingly in her day for the well-\nbeing of the State--the State that had fallen helpless into alien hands\nbefore her tired eyes.  Her eldest son lived invalid-wise in the South of\nFrance, her second son lay fathoms deep in the North Sea, with the hulk\nof a broken battleship for a burial-vault; and now the grand-daughter was\nstanding here in the limelight, bowing her thanks for the patronage and\nfavour meted out to her by this cosmopolitan company, with its lavish\nsprinkling of the uniforms of an alien army.\n\nProminent among the flowers at her feet was one large golden-petalled\nbouquet of gorgeous blooms, tied with a broad streamer of golden riband,\nthe tribute rendered by Caesar to the things that were Caesar's.  The new\nchapter of the fait accompli had been written that night and written\nwell.  The audience poured slowly out with the triumphant music of\nJancovius's Kaiser Wilhelm march, played by the orchestra as a happy\ninspiration, pealing in its ears.\n\n\"It has been a great evening, a most successful evening,\" said Lady\nShalem to Herr von Kwarl, whom she was conveying in her electric brougham\nto Cicely Yeovil's supper party; \"an important evening,\" she added,\nchoosing her adjectives with deliberation.  \"It should give pleasure in\nhigh quarters, should it not?\"\n\nAnd she turned her observant eyes on the impassive face of her companion.\n\n\"Gracious lady,\" he replied with deliberation and meaning, \"it has given\npleasure.  It is an evening to be remembered.\"\n\nThe gracious lady suppressed a sigh of satisfaction.  Memory in high\nplaces was a thing fruitful and precious beyond computation.\n\nCicely's party at the Porphyry Restaurant had grown to imposing\ndimensions.  Every one whom she had asked had come, and so had Joan\nMardle.  Lady Shalem had suggested several names at the last moment, and\nthere was quite a strong infusion of the Teutonic military and official\nworld.  It was just as well, Cicely reflected, that the supper was being\ngiven at a restaurant and not in Berkshire Street.\n\n\"Quite like ole times,\" purred the beaming proprietor in Cicely's ear, as\nthe staircase and cloak-rooms filled up with a jostling, laughing throng.\n\nThe guests settled themselves at four tables, taking their places where\nchance or fancy led them, late comers having to fit in wherever they\ncould find room.  A babel of tongues in various languages reigned round\nthe tables, amid which the rattle of knives and forks and plates and the\npopping of corks made a subdued hubbub.  Gorla Mustelford, the motive for\nall this sound and movement, this chatter of guests and scurrying of\nwaiters, sat motionless in the fatigued self-conscious silence of a great\nartist who has delivered a great message.\n\n\"Do sit at Lady Peach's table, like a dear boy,\" Cicely begged of Tony\nLuton, who had come in late; \"she and Gerald Drowly have got together, in\nspite of all my efforts, and they are both so dull.  Try and liven things\nup a bit.\"\n\nA loud barking sound, as of fur-seals calling across Arctic ice, came\nfrom another table, where Mrs. Mentieth-Mendlesohnn (one of the\nMendlesohnns of Invergordon, as she was wont to describe herself) was\nproclaiming the glories and subtleties of Gorla's achievement.\n\n\"It was a revelation,\" she shouted; \"I sat there and saw a whole new\nscheme of thought unfold itself before my eyes.  One could not define it,\nit was thought translated into action--the best art cannot be defined.\nOne just sat there and knew that one was seeing something one had never\nseen before, and yet one felt that one had seen it, in one's brain, all\none's life.  That was what was so wonderful--yes, please,\" she broke off\nsharply as a fat quail in aspic was presented to her by a questioning\nwaiter.\n\nThe voice of Mr. Mauleverer Morle came across the table, like another\nseal barking at a greater distance.\n\n\"Rostand,\" he observed with studied emphasis, \"has been called le Prince\nde l'adjectif Inopine; Miss Mustelford deserves to be described as the\nQueen of Unexpected Movement.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say, do you hear that?\" exclaimed Mrs. Mentieth-Mendlesohnn to as\nwide an audience as she could achieve; \"Rostand has been called--tell\nthem what you said, Mr. Morle,\" she broke off, suddenly mistrusting her\nability to handle a French sentence at the top of her voice.\n\nMr. Morle repeated his remark.\n\n\"Pass it on to the next table,\" commanded Mrs. Mentieth-Mendlesohnn.\n\"It's too good to be lost.\"\n\nAt the next table however, a grave impressive voice was dwelling at\nlength on a topic remote from the event of the evening.  Lady Peach\nconsidered that all social gatherings, of whatever nature, were intended\nfor the recital of minor domestic tragedies.  She lost no time in\nregaling the company around her with the detailed history of an\ninterrupted week-end in a Norfolk cottage.\n\n\"The most charming and delightful old-world spot that you could imagine,\nclean and quite comfortable, just a nice distance from the sea and within\nan easy walk of the Broads.  The very place for the children.  We'd\nbrought everything for a four days' stay and meant to have a really\ndelightful time.  And then on Sunday morning we found that some one had\nleft the springhead, where our only supply of drinking water came from,\nuncovered, and a dead bird was floating in it; it had fallen in somehow\nand got drowned.  Of course we couldn't use the water that a dead body\nhad been floating in, and there was no other supply for miles round, so\nwe had to come away then and there.  Now what do you say to that?\"\n\n\"'Ah, that a linnet should die in the Spring,'\" quoted Tony Luton with\nintense feeling.\n\nThere was an immediate outburst of hilarity where Lady Peach had\nconfidently looked for expressions of concern and sympathy.\n\n\"Isn't Tony just perfectly cute?  Isn't he?\" exclaimed a young American\nwoman, with an enthusiasm to which Lady Peach entirely failed to respond.\nShe had intended following up her story with the account of another\ntragedy of a similar nature that had befallen her three years ago in\nArgyllshire, and now the opportunity had gone.  She turned morosely to\nthe consolations of a tongue salad.\n\nAt the centre table the excellent von Tolb led a chorus of congratulation\nand compliment, to which Gorla listened with an air of polite detachment,\nmuch as the Sheikh Ul Islam might receive the homage of a Wesleyan\nConference.  To a close observer it would have seemed probable that her\nattitude of fatigued indifference to the flattering remarks that were\nshowered on her had been as carefully studied and rehearsed as any of her\npostures on the stage.\n\n\"It is something that one will appreciate more and more fully every time\none sees it . . . One cannot see it too often . . . I could have sat and\nwatched it for hours . . . Do you know, I am just looking forward to to-\nmorrow evening, when I can see it again. . . .  I knew it was going to be\ngood, but I had no idea--\" so chimed the chorus, between mouthfuls of\nquail and bites of asparagus.\n\n\"Weren't the performing wolves wonderful?\" exclaimed Joan in her fresh\njoyous voice, that rang round the room like laughter of the woodpecker.\n\nIf there is one thing that disturbs the complacency of a great artist of\nthe Halls it is the consciousness of sharing his or her triumphs with\nperforming birds and animals, but of course Joan was not to be expected\nto know that.  She pursued her subject with the assurance of one who has\nhit on a particularly acceptable topic.\n\n\"It must have taken them years of training and concentration to master\nthose tricycles,\" she continued in high-pitched soliloquy.  \"The nice\nthing about them is that they don't realise a bit how clever and\neducational they are.  It would be dreadful to have them putting on airs,\nwouldn't it?  And yet I suppose the knowledge of being able to jump\nthrough a hoop better than any other wolf would justify a certain amount\nof 'side.'\"\n\nFortunately at this moment a young Italian journalist at another table\nrose from his seat and delivered a two-minute oration in praise of the\nheroine of the evening.  He spoke in rapid nervous French, with a North\nItalian accent, but much of what he said could be understood by the\nmajority of those present, and the applause was unanimous.  At any rate\nhe had been brief and it was permissible to suppose that he had been\nwitty.\n\nIt was the opening for which Mr. Gerald Drowly had been watching and\nwaiting.  The moment that the Italian enthusiast had dropped back into\nhis seat amid a rattle of hand-clapping and rapping of forks and knives\non the tables, Drowly sprang to his feet, pushed his chair well away, as\nfor a long separation, and begged to endorse what had been so very aptly\nand gracefully, and, might he add, truly said by the previous speaker.\nThis was only the prelude to the real burden of his message; with the\ndexterity that comes of practice he managed, in a couple of hurried\nsentences, to divert the course of his remarks to his own personality and\ncareer, and to inform his listeners that he was an actor of some note and\nexperience, and had had the honour of acting under--and here followed a\nstring of names of eminent actor managers of the day.  He thought he\nmight be pardoned for mentioning the fact that his performance of\n\"Peterkin\" in the \"Broken Nutshell,\" had won the unstinted approval of\nthe dramatic critics of the Provincial press.  Towards the end of what\nwas a long speech, and which seemed even longer to its hearers, he\nreverted to the subject of Gorla's dancing and bestowed on it such\nlaudatory remarks as he had left over.  Drawing his chair once again into\nhis immediate neighbourhood he sat down, aglow with the satisfied\nconsciousness of a good work worthily performed.\n\n\"I once acted a small part in some theatricals got up for a charity,\"\nannounced Joan in a ringing, confidential voice; \"the Clapham Courier\nsaid that all the minor parts were very creditably sustained.  Those were\nits very words.  I felt I must tell you that, and also say how much I\nenjoyed Miss Mustelford's dancing.\"\n\nTony Luton cheered wildly.\n\n\"That's the cleverest speech so far,\" he proclaimed.  He had been asked\nto liven things up at his table and was doing his best to achieve that\nresult, but Mr. Gerald Drowly joined Lady Peach in the unfavourable\nopinion she had formed of that irrepressible youth.\n\nRonnie, on whom Cicely kept a solicitous eye, showed no sign of any\nintention of falling in love with Gorla.  He was more profitably engaged\nin paying court to the Grafin von Tolb, whose hospitable mansion in\nBelgrave Square invested her with a special interest in his eyes.  As a\nprofessional Prince Charming he had every inducement to encourage the\ncult of Fairy Godmother.\n\n\"Yes, yes, agreed, I will come and hear you play, that is a promise,\"\nsaid the Grafin, \"and you must come and dine with me one night and play\nto me afterwards, that is a promise, also, yes?  That is very nice of\nyou, to come and see a tiresome old woman.  I am passionately fond of\nmusic; if I were honest I would tell you also that I am very fond of good-\nlooking boys, but this is not the age of honesty, so I must leave you to\nguess that.  Come on Thursday in next week, you can?  That is nice.  I\nhave a reigning Prince dining with me that night.  Poor man, he wants\ncheering up; the art of being a reigning Prince is not a very pleasing\none nowadays.  He has made it a boast all his life that he is Liberal and\nhis subjects Conservative; now that is all changed--no, not all; he is\nstill Liberal, but his subjects unfortunately are become Socialists.  You\nmust play your best for him.\"\n\n\"Are there many Socialists over there, in Germany I mean?\" asked Ronnie,\nwho was rather out of his depth where politics were concerned.\n\n\"Ueberall,\" said the Grafin with emphasis; \"everywhere, I don't know what\nit comes from; better education and worse digestions I suppose.  I am\nsure digestion has a good deal to do with it.  In my husband's family for\nexample, his generation had excellent digestions, and there wasn't a case\nof Socialism or suicide among them; the younger generation have no\ndigestions worth speaking of, and there have been two suicides and three\nSocialists within the last six years.  And now I must really be going.  I\nam not a Berliner and late hours don't suit my way of life.\"\n\nRonnie bent low over the Grafin's hand and kissed it, partly because she\nwas the kind of woman who naturally invoked such homage, but chiefly\nbecause he knew that the gesture showed off his smooth burnished head to\nadvantage.\n\nThe observant eyes of Lady Shalem had noted the animated conversation\nbetween the Grafin and Ronnie, and she had overheard fragments of the\ninvitation that had been accorded to the latter.\n\n\"Take us the little foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines,\" she\nquoted to herself; \"not that that music-boy would do much in the\ndestructive line, but the principle is good.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X: SOME REFLECTIONS AND A \"TE DEUM\"\n\n\nCicely awoke, on the morning after the \"memorable evening,\" with the\nsatisfactory feeling of victory achieved, tempered by a troubled sense of\nhaving achieved it in the face of a reasonably grounded opposition.  She\nhad burned her boats, and was glad of it, but the reek of their burning\ndrifted rather unpleasantly across the jubilant incense-swinging of her\nTe Deum service.\n\nLast night had marked an immense step forward in her social career;\nwithout running after the patronage of influential personages she had\nseen it quietly and tactfully put at her service.  People such as the\nGrafin von Tolb were going to be a power in the London world for a very\nlong time to come.  Herr von Kwarl, with all his useful qualities of\nbrain and temperament, might conceivably fall out of favour in some\nunexpected turn of the political wheel, and the Shalems would probably\nhave their little day and then a long afternoon of diminishing social\nimportance; the placid dormouse-like Grafin would outlast them all.  She\nhad the qualities which make either for contented mediocrity or else for\nvery durable success, according as circumstances may dictate.  She was\none of those characters that can neither thrust themselves to the front,\nnor have any wish to do so, but being there, no ordinary power can thrust\nthem away.\n\nWith the Grafin as her friend Cicely found herself in altogether a\ndifferent position from that involved by the mere interested patronage of\nLady Shalem.  A vista of social success was opened up to her, and she did\nnot mean it to be just the ordinary success of a popular and influential\nhostess moving in an important circle.  That people with naturally bad\nmanners should have to be polite and considerate in their dealings with\nher, that people who usually held themselves aloof should have to be\ngracious and amiable, that the self-assured should have to be just a\nlittle humble and anxious where she was concerned, these things of course\nshe intended to happen; she was a woman.  But, she told herself, she\nintended a great deal more than that when she traced the pattern for her\nscheme of social influence.  In her heart she detested the German\noccupation as a hateful necessity, but while her heart registered the\nhatefulness the brain recognised the necessity.  The great\nfighting-machines that the Germans had built up and maintained, on land,\non sea, and in air, were three solid crushing facts that demonstrated the\nhopelessness of any immediate thought of revolt.  Twenty years hence,\nwhen the present generation was older and greyer, the chances of armed\nrevolt would probably be equally hopeless, equally remote-seeming.  But\nin the meantime something could have been effected in another way.  The\nconquerors might partially Germanise London, but, on the other hand, if\nthe thing were skilfully managed, the British element within the Empire\nmight impress the mark of its influence on everything German.  The\nfighting men might remain Prussian or Bavarian, but the thinking men, and\neventually the ruling men, could gradually come under British influence,\nor even be of British blood.  An English Liberal-Conservative \"Centre\"\nmight stand as a bulwark against the Junkerdom and Socialism of\nContinental Germany.  So Cicely reasoned with herself, in a fashion\ninduced perhaps by an earlier apprenticeship to the reading of Nineteenth\nCentury articles, in which the possible political and racial developments\nof various countries were examined and discussed and put away in the\npigeon-holes of probable happenings.  She had sufficient knowledge of\npolitical history to know that such a development might possibly come to\npass, she had not sufficient insight into actual conditions to know that\nthe possibility was as remote as that of armed resistance.  And the role\nwhich she saw herself playing was that of a deft and courtly political\nintriguer, rallying the British element and making herself agreeable to\nthe German element, a political inspiration to the one and a social\ndistraction to the other.  At the back of her mind there lurked an honest\nconfession that she was probably over-rating her powers of statecraft and\npersonality, that she was more likely to be carried along by the current\nof events than to control or divert its direction; the political\nday-dream remained, however, as day-dreams will, in spite of the clear\nlight of probability shining through them.  At any rate she knew, as\nusual, what she wanted to do, and as usual she had taken steps to carry\nout her intentions.  Last night remained in her mind a night of important\nvictory.  There also remained the anxious proceeding of finding out if\nthe victory had entailed any serious losses.\n\nCicely was not one of those ill-regulated people who treat the first meal\nof the day as a convenient occasion for serving up any differences or\ncontentions that have been left over from the day before or overlooked in\nthe press of other matters.  She enjoyed her breakfast and gave Yeovil\nunhindered opportunity for enjoying his; a discussion as to the right\ncooking of a dish that he had first tasted among the Orenburg Tartars was\nthe prevailing topic on this particular morning, and blended well with\ntrout and toast and coffee.  In a cosy nook of the smoking-room, in\nparticipation of the after-breakfast cigarettes, Cicely made her dash\ninto debatable ground.\n\n\"You haven't asked me how my supper-party went off,\" she said.\n\n\"There is a notice of it in two of the morning papers, with a list of\nthose present,\" said Yeovil; \"the conquering race seems to have been very\nwell represented.\"\n\n\"Several races were represented,\" said Cicely; \"a function of that sort,\ncelebrating a dramatic first-night, was bound to be cosmopolitan.  In\nfact, blending of races and nationalities is the tendency of the age we\nlive in.\"\n\n\"The blending of races seems to have been consummated already in one of\nthe individuals at your party,\" said Yeovil drily; \"the name Mentieth-\nMendlesohnn struck me as a particularly happy obliteration of racial\nlandmarks.\"\n\nCicely laughed.\n\n\"A noisy and very wearisome sort of woman,\" she commented; \"she reminds\none of garlic that's been planted by mistake in a conservatory.  Still,\nshe's useful as an advertising agent to any one who rubs her the right\nway.  She'll be invaluable in proclaiming the merits of Gorla's\nperformance to all and sundry; that's why I invited her.  She'll probably\nlunch to-day at the Hotel Cecil, and every one sitting within a hundred\nyards of her table will hear what an emotional education they can get by\ngoing to see Gorla dance at the Caravansery.\"\n\n\"She seems to be like the Salvation Army,\" said Yeovil; \"her noise\nreaches a class of people who wouldn't trouble to read press notices.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Cicely.  \"Gorla gets quite good notices on the whole,\ndoesn't she?\"\n\n\"The one that took my fancy most was the one in the Standard,\" said\nYeovil, picking up that paper from a table by his side and searching its\ncolumns for the notice in question.  \"'The wolves which appeared earlier\nin the evening's entertainment are, the programme assures us, trained\nentirely by kindness.  It would have been a further kindness, at any rate\nto the audience, if some of the training, which the wolves doubtless do\nnot appreciate at its proper value, had been expended on Miss\nMustelford's efforts at stage dancing.  We are assured, again on the\nauthority of the programme, that the much-talked-of Suggestion Dances are\nthe last word in Posture dancing.  The last word belongs by immemorial\nright to the sex which Miss Mustelford adorns, and it would be ungallant\nto seek to deprive her of her privilege.  As far as the educational\naspect of her performance is concerned we must admit that the life of the\nfern remains to us a private life still.  Miss Mustelford has abandoned\nher own private life in an unavailing attempt to draw the fern into the\ngaze of publicity.  And so it was with her other suggestions.  They\nsuggested many things, but nothing that was announced on the programme.\nChiefly they suggested one outstanding reflection, that stage-dancing is\nnot like those advertised breakfast foods that can be served up after\nthree minutes' preparation.  Half a life-time, or rather half a youth-\ntime is a much more satisfactory allowance.'\"\n\n\"The Standard is prejudiced,\" said Cicely; \"some of the other papers are\nquite enthusiastic.  The Dawn gives her a column and a quarter of notice,\nnearly all of it complimentary.  It says the report of her fame as a\ndancer went before her, but that her performance last night caught it up\nand outstripped it.\"\n\n\"I should not like to suggest that the Dawn is prejudiced,\" said Yeovil,\n\"but Shalem is a managing director on it, and one of its biggest\nshareholders.  Gorla's dancing is an event of the social season, and\nShalem is one of those most interested in keeping up the appearance, at\nany rate, of a London social season.  Besides, her debut gave the\nopportunity for an Imperial visit to the theatre--the first appearance at\na festive public function of the Conqueror among the conquered.\nApparently the experiment passed off well; Shalem has every reason to\nfeel pleased with himself and well-disposed towards Gorla.  By the way,\"\nadded Yeovil, \"talking of Gorla, I'm going down to Torywood one day next\nweek.\"\n\n\"To Torywood?\" exclaimed Cicely.  The tone of her exclamation gave the\nimpression that the announcement was not very acceptable to her.\n\n\"I promised the old lady that I would go and have a talk with her when I\ncame back from my Siberian trip; she travelled in eastern Russia, you\nknow, long before the Trans-Siberian railway was built, and she's\nenormously interested in those parts.  In any case I should like to see\nher again.\"\n\n\"She does not see many people nowadays,\" said Cicely; \"I fancy she is\nbreaking up rather.  She was very fond of the son who went down, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"She has seen a great many of the things she cared for go down,\" said\nYeovil; \"it is a sad old life that is left to her, when one thinks of all\nthat the past has been to her, of the part she used to play in the world,\nthe work she used to get through.  It used to seem as though she could\nnever grow old, as if she would die standing up, with some unfinished\ncommand on her lips.  And now I suppose her tragedy is that she has grown\nold, bitterly old, and cannot die.\"\n\nCicely was silent for a moment, and seemed about to leave the room.  Then\nshe turned back and said:\n\n\"I don't think I would say anything about Gorla to her if I were you.\"\n\n\"It would not have occurred to me to drag her name into our\nconversation,\" said Yeovil coldly, \"but in any case the accounts of her\ndancing performance will have reached Torywood through the\nnewspapers--also the record of your racially-blended supper-party.\"\n\nCicely said nothing.  She knew that by last night's affair she had\ndefinitely identified herself in public opinion with the Shalem clique,\nand that many of her old friends would look on her with distrust and\nsuspicion on that account.  It was unfortunate, but she reckoned it a\nlesser evil than tearing herself away from her London life, its successes\nand pleasures and possibilities.  These social dislocations and severing\nof friendships were to be looked for after any great and violent change\nin State affairs.  It was Yeovil's attitude that really troubled her; she\nwould not give way to his prejudices and accept his point of view, but\nshe knew that a victory that involved estrangement from him would only\nbring a mockery of happiness.  She still hoped that he would come round\nto an acceptance of established facts and deaden his political malaise in\nthe absorbing distraction of field sports.  The visit to Torywood was a\nmisfortune; it might just turn the balance in the undesired direction.\nOnly a few weeks of late summer and early autumn remained before the\nhunting season, and its preparations would be at hand, and Yeovil might\nbe caught in the meshes of an old enthusiasm; in those few weeks,\nhowever, he might be fired by another sort of enthusiasm, an enthusiasm\nwhich would sooner or later mean voluntary or enforced exile for his\npart, and the probable breaking up of her own social plans and ambitions.\n\nBut Cicely knew something of the futility of improvising objections where\nno real obstacle exists.  The visit to Torywood was a graceful attention\non Yeovil's part to an old friend; there was no decent ground on which it\ncould be opposed.  If the influence of that visit came athwart Yeovil's\nlife and hers with disastrous effect, that was \"Kismet.\"\n\nAnd once again the reek from her burned and smouldering boats mingled\nthreateningly with the incense fumes of her Te Deum for victory.  She\nleft the room, and Yeovil turned once more to an item of news in the\nmorning's papers that had already arrested his attention.  The Imperial\nAufklarung on the subject of military service was to be made public in\nthe course of the day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI: THE TEA SHOP\n\n\nYeovil wandered down Piccadilly that afternoon in a spirit of\nrestlessness and expectancy.  The long-awaited Aufklarung dealing with\nthe new law of military service had not yet appeared; at any moment he\nmight meet the hoarse-throated newsboys running along with their papers,\nannouncing the special edition which would give the terms of the edict to\nthe public.  Every sound or movement that detached itself with isolated\nsignificance from the general whirr and scurry of the streets seemed to\nYeovil to herald the oncoming clamour and rush that he was looking for.\nBut the long endless succession of motors and 'buses and vans went by,\nhooting and grunting, and such newsboys as were to be seen hung about\nlistlessly, bearing no more attractive bait on their posters than the\nannouncement of an \"earthquake shock in Hungary: feared loss of life.\"\n\nThe Green Park end of Piccadilly was a changed, and in some respects a\nlivelier thoroughfare to that which Yeovil remembered with affectionate\nregret.  A great political club had migrated from its palatial home to a\nshrunken habitation in a less prosperous quarter; its place was filled by\nthe flamboyant frontage of the Hotel Konstantinopel.  Gorgeous Turkey\ncarpets were spread over the wide entrance steps, and boys in Circassian\nand Anatolian costumes hung around the doors, or dashed forth in\nun-Oriental haste to carry such messages as the telephone was unable to\ntransmit.  Picturesque sellers of Turkish delight, attar-of-roses, and\nbrass-work coffee services, squatted under the portico, on terms of\nobvious good understanding with the hotel management.  A few doors\nfurther down a service club that had long been a Piccadilly landmark was\na landmark still, as the home of the Army Aeronaut Club, and there was a\nconstant coming and going of gay-hued uniforms, Saxon, Prussian,\nBavarian, Hessian, and so forth, through its portals.  The mastering of\nthe air and the creation of a scientific aerial war fleet, second to none\nin the world, was an achievement of which the conquering race was\npardonably proud, and for which it had good reason to be duly thankful.\nOver the gateways was blazoned the badge of the club, an elephant, whale,\nand eagle, typifying the three armed forces of the State, by land and sea\nand air; the eagle bore in its beak a scroll with the proud legend: \"The\nlast am I, but not the least.\"\n\nTo the eastward of this gaily-humming hive the long shuttered front of a\ndeserted ducal mansion struck a note of protest and mourning amid the\nnoise and whirl and colour of a seemingly uncaring city.  On the other\nside of the roadway, on the gravelled paths of the Green Park, small\nragged children from the back streets of Westminster looked wistfully at\nthe smooth trim stretches of grass on which it was now forbidden, in two\nlanguages, to set foot.  Only the pigeons, disregarding the changes of\npolitical geography, walked about as usual, wondering perhaps, if they\never wondered at anything, at the sudden change in the distribution of\npark humans.\n\nYeovil turned his steps out of the hot sunlight into the shade of the\nBurlington Arcade, familiarly known to many of its newer frequenters as\nthe Passage.  Here the change that new conditions and requirements had\nwrought was more immediately noticeable than anywhere else in the West\nEnd.  Most of the shops on the western side had been cleared away, and in\ntheir place had been installed an \"open-air\" cafe, converting the long\nalley into a sort of promenade tea-garden, flanked on one side by a line\nof haberdashers', perfumers', and jewellers' show windows.  The patrons\nof the cafe could sit at the little round tables, drinking their coffee\nand syrups and aperitifs, and gazing, if they were so minded, at the\npyjamas and cravats and Brazilian diamonds spread out for inspection\nbefore them.  A string orchestra, hidden away somewhere in a gallery, was\nalternating grand opera with the Gondola Girl and the latest gems of\nTransatlantic melody.  From around the tightly-packed tables arose a\nbabble of tongues, made up chiefly of German, a South American rendering\nof Spanish, and a North American rendering of English, with here and\nthere the sharp shaken-out staccato of Japanese.  A sleepy-looking boy,\nin a nondescript uniform, was wandering to and fro among the customers,\noffering for sale the Matin, New York Herald, Berliner Tageblatt, and a\nhost of crudely coloured illustrated papers, embodying the hard-worked\nwit of a world-legion of comic artists.  Yeovil hurried through the\nArcade; it was not here, in this atmosphere of staring alien eyes and\njangling tongues, that he wanted to read the news of the Imperial\nAufklarung.\n\nBy a succession of by-ways he reached Hanover Square, and thence made his\nway into Oxford Street.  There was no commotion of activity to be noticed\nyet among the newsboys; the posters still concerned themselves with the\nearthquake in Hungary, varied with references to the health of the King\nof Roumania, and a motor accident in South London.  Yeovil wandered\naimlessly along the street for a few dozen yards, and then turned down\ninto the smoking-room of a cheap tea-shop, where he judged that the\nflourishing foreign element would be less conspicuously represented.\nQuiet-voiced, smooth-headed youths, from neighbouring shops and wholesale\nhouses, sat drinking tea and munching pastry, some of them reading,\nothers making a fitful rattle with dominoes on the marble-topped tables.\nA clean, wholesome smell of tea and coffee made itself felt through the\nclouds of cigarette smoke; cleanliness and listlessness seemed to be the\ndominant notes of the place, a cleanliness that was commendable, and a\nlistlessness that seemed unnatural and undesirable where so much youth\nwas gathered together for refreshment and recreation.  Yeovil seated\nhimself at a table already occupied by a young clergyman who was smoking\na cigarette over the remains of a plateful of buttered toast.  He had a\nkeen, clever, hard-lined face, the face of a man who, in an earlier stage\nof European history, might have been a warlike prior, awkward to tackle\nat the council-board, greatly to be avoided where blows were being\nexchanged.  A pale, silent damsel drifted up to Yeovil and took his order\nwith an air of being mentally some hundreds of miles away, and utterly\nindifferent to the requirements of those whom she served; if she had\nbrought calf's-foot jelly instead of the pot of China tea he had asked\nfor, Yeovil would hardly have been surprised.  However, the tea duly\narrived on the table, and the pale damsel scribbled a figure on a slip of\npaper, put it silently by the side of the teapot, and drifted silently\naway.  Yeovil had seen the same sort of thing done on the musical-comedy\nstage, and done rather differently.\n\n\"Can you tell me, sir, is the Imperial announcement out yet?\" asked the\nyoung clergyman, after a brief scrutiny of his neighbour.\n\n\"No, I have been waiting about for the last half-hour on the look-out for\nit,\" said Yeovil; \"the special editions ought to be out by now.\"  Then he\nadded: \"I have only just lately come from abroad.  I know scarcely\nanything of London as it is now.  You may imagine that a good deal of it\nis very strange to me.  Your profession must take you a good deal among\nall classes of people.  I have seen something of what one may call the\nupper, or, at any rate, the richer classes, since I came back; do tell me\nsomething about the poorer classes of the community.  How do they take\nthe new order of things?\"\n\n\"Badly,\" said the young cleric, \"badly, in more senses than one.  They\nare helpless and they are bitter--bitter in the useless kind of way that\nproduces no great resolutions.  They look round for some one to blame for\nwhat has happened; they blame the politicians, they blame the leisured\nclasses; in an indirect way I believe they blame the Church.  Certainly,\nthe national disaster has not drawn them towards religion in any form.\nOne thing you may be sure of, they do not blame themselves.  No true\nLondoner ever admits that fault lies at his door.  'No, I never!' is an\nexclamation that is on his lips from earliest childhood, whenever he is\ncharged with anything blameworthy or punishable.  That is why school\ndiscipline was ever a thing repugnant to the schoolboard child and its\nparents; no schoolboard scholar ever deserved punishment.  However\nobvious the fault might seem to a disciplinarian, 'No, I never'\nexonerated it as something that had not happened.  Public schoolboys and\nprivate schoolboys of the upper and middle class had their fling and took\ntheir thrashings, when they were found out, as a piece of bad luck, but\n'our Bert' and 'our Sid' were of those for whom there is no condemnation;\nif they were punished it was for faults that 'no, they never' committed.\nNaturally the grown-up generation of Berts and Sids, the voters and\nhouseholders, do not realise, still less admit, that it was they who\ncalled the tune to which the politicians danced.  They had to choose\nbetween the vote-mongers and the so-called 'scare-mongers,' and their\nverdict was for the vote-mongers all the time.  And now they are bitter;\nthey are being punished, and punishment is not a thing that they have\nbeen schooled to bear.  The taxes that are falling on them are a grievous\nsource of discontent, and the military service that will be imposed on\nthem, for the first time in their lives, will be another.  There is a\nmore lovable side to their character under misfortune, though,\" added the\nyoung clergyman.  \"Deep down in their hearts there was a very real\naffection for the old dynasty.  Future historians will perhaps be able to\nexplain how and why the Royal Family of Great Britain captured the\nimaginations of its subjects in so genuine and lasting a fashion.  Among\nthe poorest and the most matter-of-fact, for whom the name of no public\nman, politician or philanthropist, stands out with any especial\nsignificance, the old Queen, and the dead King, the dethroned monarch and\nthe young prince live in a sort of domestic Pantheon, a recollection that\nis a proud and wistful personal possession when so little remains to be\nproud of or to possess.  There is no favour that I am so often asked for\namong my poorer parishioners as the gift of the picture of this or that\nmember of the old dynasty.  'I have got all of them, only except Princess\nMary,' an old woman said to me last week, and she nearly cried with\npleasure when I brought her an old Bystander portrait that filled the gap\nin her collection.  And on Queen Alexandra's day they bring out and wear\nthe faded wild-rose favours that they bought with their pennies in days\ngone by.\"\n\n\"The tragedy of the enactment that is about to enforce military service\non these people is that it comes when they've no longer a country to\nfight for,\" said Yeovil.\n\nThe young clergyman gave an exclamation of bitter impatience.\n\n\"That is the cruel mockery of the whole thing.  Every now and then in the\ncourse of my work I have come across lads who were really drifting to the\nbad through the good qualities in them.  A clean combative strain in\ntheir blood, and a natural turn for adventure, made the ordinary anaemic\nroutine of shop or warehouse or factory almost unbearable for them.  What\nsplendid little soldiers they would have made, and how grandly the\ndiscipline of a military training would have steadied them in after-life\nwhen steadiness was wanted.  The only adventure that their surroundings\noffered them has been the adventure of practising mildly criminal\nmisdeeds without getting landed in reformatories and prisons; those of\nthem that have not been successful in keeping clear of detection are\nwalking round and round prison yards, experiencing the operation of a\ndiscipline that breaks and does not build.  They were merry-hearted boys\nonce, with nothing of the criminal or ne'er-do-weel in their natures, and\nnow--have you ever seen a prison yard, with that walk round and round and\nround between grey walls under a blue sky?\"\n\nYeovil nodded.\n\n\"It's good enough for criminals and imbeciles,\" said the parson, \"but\nthink of it for those boys, who might have been marching along to the tap\nof the drum, with a laugh on their lips instead of Hell in their hearts.\nI have had Hell in my heart sometimes, when I have come in touch with\ncases like those.  I suppose you are thinking that I am a strange sort of\nparson.\"\n\n\"I was just defining you in my mind,\" said Yeovil, \"as a man of God, with\nan infinite tenderness for little devils.\"\n\nThe clergyman flushed.\n\n\"Rather a fine epitaph to have on one's tombstone,\" he said, \"especially\nif the tombstone were in some crowded city graveyard.  I suppose I am a\nman of God, but I don't think I could be called a man of peace.\"\n\nLooking at the strong young face, with its suggestion of a fighting prior\nof bygone days more marked than ever, Yeovil mentally agreed that he\ncould not.\n\n\"I have learned one thing in life,\" continued the young man, \"and that is\nthat peace is not for this world.  Peace is what God gives us when He\ntakes us into His rest.  Beat your sword into a ploughshare if you like,\nbut beat your enemy into smithereens first.\"\n\nA long-drawn cry, repeated again and again, detached itself from the\nthrob and hoot and whir of the street traffic.\n\n\"Speshul!  Military service, spesh-ul!\"\n\nThe young clergyman sprang from his seat and went up the staircase in a\nsuccession of bounds, causing the domino players and novelette readers to\nlook up for a moment in mild astonishment.  In a few seconds he was back\nagain, with a copy of an afternoon paper.  The Imperial Rescript was set\nforth in heavy type, in parallel columns of English and German.  As the\nyoung man read a deep burning flush spread over his face, then ebbed away\ninto a chalky whiteness.  He read the announcement to the end, then\nhanded the paper to Yeovil, and left without a word.\n\nBeneath the courtly politeness and benignant phraseology of the document\nran a trenchant searing irony.  The British born subjects of the Germanic\nCrown, inhabiting the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, had\nhabituated themselves as a people to the disuse of arms, and resolutely\nexcluded military service and national training from their political\nsystem and daily life.  Their judgment that they were unsuited as a race\nto bear arms and conform to military discipline was not to be set aside.\nTheir new Overlord did not propose to do violence to their feelings and\ncustoms by requiring from them the personal military sacrifices and\nservices which were rendered by his subjects German-born.  The British\nsubjects of the Crown were to remain a people consecrated to peaceful\npursuits, to commerce and trade and husbandry.  The defence of their\ncoasts and shipping and the maintenance of order and general safety would\nbe guaranteed by a garrison of German troops, with the co-operation of\nthe Imperial war fleet.  German-born subjects residing temporarily or\npermanently in the British Isles would come under the same laws\nrespecting compulsory military service as their fellow-subjects of German\nblood in the other parts of the Empire, and special enactments would be\ndrawn up to ensure that their interests did not suffer from a periodical\nwithdrawal on training or other military calls.  Necessarily a heavily\ndifferentiated scale of war taxation would fall on British taxpayers, to\nprovide for the upkeep of the garrison and to equalise the services and\nsacrifices rendered by the two branches of his Majesty's subjects.  As\nmilitary service was not henceforth open to any subject of British birth\nno further necessity for any training or exercise of a military nature\nexisted, therefore all rifle clubs, drill associations, cadet corps and\nsimilar bodies were henceforth declared to be illegal.  No weapons other\nthan guns for specified sporting purposes, duly declared and registered\nand open to inspection when required, could be owned, purchased, or\ncarried.  The science of arms was to be eliminated altogether from the\nlife of a people who had shown such marked repugnance to its study and\npractice.\n\nThe cold irony of the measure struck home with the greater force because\nits nature was so utterly unexpected.  Public anticipation had guessed at\nvarious forms of military service, aggressively irksome or tactfully\nlightened as the case might be, in any event certain to be bitterly\nunpopular, and now there had come this contemptuous boon, which had\nremoved, at one stroke, the bogey of compulsory military service from the\ntroubled imaginings of the British people, and fastened on them the cruel\ndistinction of being in actual fact what an enemy had called them in\nsplenetic scorn long years ago--a nation of shopkeepers.  Aye, something\neven below that level, a race of shopkeepers who were no longer a nation.\n\nYeovil crumpled the paper in his hand and went out into the sunlit\nstreet.  A sudden roll of drums and crash of brass music filled the air.\nA company of Bavarian infantry went by, in all the pomp and circumstance\nof martial array and the joyous swing of rapid rhythmic movement.  The\nstreet echoed and throbbed in the Englishman's ears with the exultant\npulse of youth and mastery set to loud Pagan music.  A group of lads from\nthe tea-shop clustered on the pavement and watched the troops go by,\nstaring at a phase of life in which they had no share.  The martial\ntrappings, the swaggering joy of life, the comradeship of camp and\nbarracks, the hard discipline of drill yard and fatigue duty, the long\nsentry watches, the trench digging, forced marches, wounds, cold, hunger,\nmakeshift hospitals, and the blood-wet laurels--these were not for them.\nSuch things they might only guess at, or see on a cinema film, darkly;\nthey belonged to the civilian nation.\n\nThe function of afternoon tea was still being languidly observed in the\nbig drawing-room when Yeovil returned to Berkshire Street.  Cicely was\nplaying the part of hostess to a man of perhaps forty-one years of age,\nwho looked slightly older from his palpable attempts to look very much\nyounger.  Percival Plarsey was a plump, pale-faced, short-legged\nindividual, with puffy cheeks, over-prominent nose, and thin colourless\nhair.  His mother, with nothing more than maternal prejudice to excuse\nher, had discovered some twenty odd years ago that he was a well-favoured\nyoung man, and had easily imbued her son with the same opinion.  The\nslipping away of years and the natural transition of the unathletic boy\ninto the podgy unhealthy-looking man did little to weaken the tradition;\nPlarsey had never been able to relinquish the idea that a youthful charm\nand comeliness still centred in his person, and laboured daily at his\ntoilet with the devotion that a hopelessly lost cause is so often able to\ninspire.  He babbled incessantly about himself and the accessory\nfutilities of his life in short, neat, complacent sentences, and in a\nvoice that Ronald Storre said reminded one of a fat bishop blessing a\nbutter-making competition.  While he babbled he kept his eyes fastened on\nhis listeners to observe the impression which his important little\nannouncements and pronouncements were making.  On the present occasion he\nwas pattering forth a detailed description of the upholstery and fittings\nof his new music-room.\n\n\"All the hangings, violette de Parme, all the furniture, rosewood.  The\nonly ornament in the room is a replica of the Mozart statue in Vienna.\nNothing but Mozart is to be played in the room.  Absolutely, nothing but\nMozart.\"\n\n\"You will get rather tired of that, won't you?\" said Cicely, feeling that\nshe was expected to comment on this tremendous announcement.\n\n\"One gets tired of everything,\" said Plarsey, with a fat little sigh of\nresignation. \"I can't tell you how tired I am of Rubenstein, and one day\nI suppose I shall be tired of Mozart, and violette de Parme and rosewood.\nI never thought it possible that I could ever tire of jonquils, and now I\nsimply won't have one in the house.  Oh, the scene the other day because\nsome one brought some jonquils into the house!  I'm afraid I was\ndreadfully rude, but I really couldn't help it.\"\n\nHe could talk like this through a long summer day or a long winter\nevening.\n\nYeovil belonged to a race forbidden to bear arms.  At the moment he would\ngladly have contented himself with the weapons with which nature had\nendowed him, if he might have kicked and pommelled the abhorrent specimen\nof male humanity whom he saw before him.\n\nInstead he broke into the conversation with an inspired flash of\nmalicious untruthfulness.\n\n\"It is wonderful,\" he observed carelessly, \"how popular that Viennese\nstatue of Mozart has become.  A friend who inspects County Council Art\nSchools tells me you find a copy of it in every class-room you go into.\"\n\nIt was a poor substitute for physical violence, but it was all that\ncivilisation allowed him in the way of relieving his feelings; it had,\nmoreover, the effect of making Plarsey profoundly miserable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII: THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS\n\n\nThe train bearing Yeovil on his visit to Torywood slid and rattled\nwestward through the hazy dreamland of an English summer landscape.  Seen\nfrom the train windows the stark bare ugliness of the metalled line was\nforgotten, and the eye rested only on the green solitude that unfolded\nitself as the miles went slipping by.  Tall grasses and meadow-weeds\nstood in deep shocks, field after field, between the leafy boundaries of\nhedge or coppice, thrusting themselves higher and higher till they\ntouched the low sweeping branches of the trees that here and there\novershadowed them.  Broad streams, bordered with a heavy fringe of reed\nand sedge, went winding away into a green distance where woodland and\nmeadowland seemed indefinitely prolonged; narrow streamlets, lost to view\nin the growth that they fostered, disclosed their presence merely by the\nwater-weed that showed in a riband of rank verdure threading the mellower\ngreen of the fields.  On the stream banks moorhens walked with jerky\nconfident steps, in the easy boldness of those who had a couple of other\nelements at their disposal in an emergency; more timorous partridges\nraced away from the apparition of the train, looking all leg and neck,\nlike little forest elves fleeing from human encounter.  And in the\ndistance, over the tree line, a heron or two flapped with slow measured\nwing-beats and an air of being bent on an immeasurably longer journey\nthan the train that hurtled so frantically along the rails.  Now and then\nthe meadowland changed itself suddenly into orchard, with close-growing\ntrees already showing the measure of their coming harvest, and then\nstrawyard and farm buildings would slide into view; heavy dairy cattle,\nroan and skewbald and dappled, stood near the gates, drowsily resentful\nof insect stings, and bunched-up companies of ducks halted in seeming\nirresolution between the charms of the horse-pond and the alluring\nneighbourhood of the farm kitchen.  Away by the banks of some rushing\nmill-stream, in a setting of copse and cornfield, a village might be\nguessed at, just a hint of red roof, grey wreathed chimney and old church\ntower as seen from the windows of the passing train, and over it all\nbrooded a happy, settled calm, like the dreaming murmur of a trout-stream\nand the far-away cawing of rooks.\n\nIt was a land where it seemed as if it must be always summer and\ngenerally afternoon, a land where bees hummed among the wild thyme and in\nthe flower beds of cottage gardens, where the harvest-mice rustled amid\nthe corn and nettles, and the mill-race flowed cool and silent through\nwater-weeds and dark tunnelled sluices, and made soft droning music with\nthe wooden mill-wheel.  And the music carried with it the wording of old\nundying rhymes, and sang of the jolly, uncaring, uncared-for miller, of\nthe farmer who went riding upon his grey mare, of the mouse who lived\nbeneath the merry mill-pin, of the sweet music on yonder green hill and\nthe dancers all in yellow--the songs and fancies of a lingering olden\ntime, when men took life as children take a long summer day, and went to\nbed at last with a simple trust in something they could not have\nexplained.\n\nYeovil watched the passing landscape with the intent hungry eyes of a man\nwho revisits a scene that holds high place in his affections.  His\nimagination raced even quicker than the train, following winding roads\nand twisting valleys into unseen distances, picturing farms and hamlets,\nhills and hollows, clattering inn yards and sleepy woodlands.\n\n\"A beautiful country,\" said his only fellow-traveller, who was also\ngazing at the fleeting landscape; \"surely a country worth fighting for.\"\n\nHe spoke in fairly correct English, but he was unmistakably a foreigner;\none could have allotted him with some certainty to the Eastern half of\nEurope.\n\n\"A beautiful country, as you say,\" replied Yeovil; then he added the\nquestion, \"Are you German?\"\n\n\"No, Hungarian,\" said the other; \"and you, you are English?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have been much in England, but I am from Russia,\" said Yeovil,\npurposely misleading his companion on the subject of his nationality in\norder to induce him to talk with greater freedom on a delicate topic.\nWhile living among foreigners in a foreign land he had shrunk from\nhearing his country's disaster discussed, or even alluded to; now he was\nanxious to learn what unprejudiced foreigners thought of the catastrophe\nand the causes which had led up to it.\n\n\"It is a strange spectacle, a wonder, is it not so?\" resumed the other,\n\"a great nation such as this was, one of the greatest nations in modern\ntimes, or of any time, carrying its flag and its language into all parts\nof the world, and now, after one short campaign, it is--\"\n\nAnd he shrugged his shoulders many times and made clucking noises at the\nroof of his voice, like a hen calling to a brood of roving chickens.\n\n\"They grew soft,\" he resumed; \"great world-commerce brings great luxury,\nand luxury brings softness.  They had everything to warn them, things\nhappening in their own time and before their eyes, and they would not be\nwarned.  They had seen, in one generation, the rise of the military and\nnaval power of the Japanese, a brown-skinned race living in some island\nrice fields in a tropical sea, a people one thought of in connection with\npaper fans and flowers and pretty tea-gardens, who suddenly marched and\nsailed into the world's gaze as a Great Power; they had seen, too, the\nrise of the Bulgars, a poor herd of zaptieh-ridden peasants, with a few\nstudents scattered in exile in Bukarest and Odessa, who shot up in one\ngeneration to be an armed and aggressive nation with history in its\nhands.  The English saw these things happening around them, and with a\nwar-cloud growing blacker and bigger and always more threatening on their\nown threshold they sat down to grow soft and peaceful.  They grew soft\nand accommodating in all things in religion--\"\n\n\"In religion?\" said Yeovil.\n\n\"In religion, yes,\" said his companion emphatically; \"they had come to\nlook on the Christ as a sort of amiable elder Brother, whose letters from\nabroad were worth reading.  Then, when they had emptied all the divine\nmystery and wonder out of their faith naturally they grew tired of it,\noh, but dreadfully tired of it.  I know many English of the country\nparts, and always they tell me they go to church once in each week to set\nthe good example to the servants.  They were tired of their faith, but\nthey were not virile enough to become real Pagans; their dancing fauns\nwere good young men who tripped Morris dances and ate health foods and\nbelieved in a sort of Socialism which made for the greatest dulness of\nthe greatest number.  You will find plenty of them still if you go into\nwhat remains of social London.\"\n\nYeovil gave a grunt of acquiescence.\n\n\"They grew soft in their political ideas,\" continued the unsparing\ncritic; \"for the old insular belief that all foreigners were devils and\nrogues they substituted another belief, equally grounded on insular lack\nof knowledge, that most foreigners were amiable, good fellows, who only\nneeded to be talked to and patted on the back to become your friends and\nbenefactors.  They began to believe that a foreign Minister would\nrelinquish long-cherished schemes of national policy and hostile\nexpansion if he came over on a holiday and was asked down to country\nhouses and shown the tennis court and the rock-garden and the younger\nchildren.  Listen.  I once heard it solemnly stated at an after-dinner\ndebate in some literary club that a certain very prominent German\nstatesman had a daughter at school in England, and that future friendly\nrelations between the two countries were improved in prospect, if not\nassured, by that circumstance.  You think I am laughing; I am recording a\nfact, and the men present were politicians and statesmen as well as\nliterary dilettanti.  It was an insular lack of insight that worked the\nmischief, or some of the mischief.  We, in Hungary, we live too much\ncheek by jowl with our racial neighbours to have many illusions about\nthem.  Austrians, Roumanians, Serbs, Italians, Czechs, we know what they\nthink of us, and we know what to think of them, we know what we want in\nthe world, and we know what they want; that knowledge does not send us\nflying at each other's throats, but it does keep us from growing soft.\nAh, the British lion was in a hurry to inaugurate the Millennium and to\nlie down gracefully with the lamb.  He made two mistakes, only two, but\nthey were very bad ones; the Millennium hadn't arrived, and it was not a\nlamb that he was lying down with.\"\n\n\"You do not like the English, I gather,\" said Yeovil, as the Hungarian\nwent off into a short burst of satirical laughter.\n\n\"I have always liked them,\" he answered, \"but now I am angry with them\nfor being soft.  Here is my station,\" he added, as the train slowed down,\nand he commenced to gather his belongings together.  \"I am angry with\nthem,\" he continued, as a final word on the subject, \"because I hate the\nGermans.\"\n\nHe raised his hat punctiliously in a parting salute and stepped out on to\nthe platform.  His place was taken by a large, loose-limbed man, with\nflorid face and big staring eyes, and an immense array of fishing-basket,\nrod, fly-cases, and so forth.  He was of the type that one could\ninstinctively locate as a loud-voiced, self-constituted authority on\nwhatever topic might happen to be discussed in the bars of small hotels.\n\n\"Are you English?\" he asked, after a preliminary stare at Yeovil.\n\nThis time Yeovil did not trouble to disguise his nationality; he nodded\ncurtly to his questioner.\n\n\"Glad of that,\" said the fisherman; \"I don't like travelling with\nGermans.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" said Yeovil, \"we have to travel with them, as partners\nin the same State concern, and not by any means the predominant partner\neither.\"\n\n\"Oh, that will soon right itself,\" said the other with loud\nassertiveness, \"that will right itself damn soon.\"\n\n\"Nothing in politics rights itself,\" said Yeovil; \"things have to be\nrighted, which is a different matter.\"\n\n\"What d'y'mean?\" said the fisherman, who did not like to have his\nassertions taken up and shaken into shape.\n\n\"We have given a clever and domineering people a chance to plant\nthemselves down as masters in our land; I don't imagine that they are\ngoing to give us an easy chance to push them out.  To do that we shall\nhave to be a little cleverer than they are, a little harder, a little\nfiercer, and a good deal more self-sacrificing than we have been in my\nlifetime or in yours.\"\n\n\"We'll be that, right enough,\" said the fisherman; \"we mean business this\ntime.  The last war wasn't a war, it was a snap.  We weren't prepared and\nthey were.  That won't happen again, bless you.  I know what I'm talking\nabout.  I go up and down the country, and I hear what people are saying.\"\n\nYeovil privately doubted if he ever heard anything but his own opinions.\n\n\"It stands to reason,\" continued the fisherman, \"that a highly civilised\nrace like ours, with the record that we've had for leading the whole\nworld, is not going to be held under for long by a lot of damned sausage-\neating Germans.  Don't you believe it!  I know what I'm talking about.\nI've travelled about the world a bit.\"\n\nYeovil shrewdly suspected that the world travels amounted to nothing more\nthan a trip to the United States and perhaps the Channel Islands, with,\npossibly, a week or fortnight in Paris.\n\n\"It isn't the past we've got to think of, it's the future,\" said Yeovil.\n\"Other maritime Powers had pasts to look back on; Spain and Holland, for\ninstance.  The past didn't help them when they let their sea-sovereignty\nslip from them.  That is a matter of history and not very distant history\neither.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's where you make a mistake,\" said the other; \"our\nsea-sovereignty hasn't slipped from us, and won't do, neither.  There's\nthe British Empire beyond the seas; Canada, Australia, New Zealand, East\nAfrica.\"\n\nHe rolled the names round his tongue with obvious relish.\n\n\"If it was a list of first-class battleships, and armoured cruisers and\ndestroyers and airships that you were reeling off, there would be some\ncomfort and hope in the situation,\" said Yeovil; \"the loyalty of the\ncolonies is a splendid thing, but it is only pathetically splendid\nbecause it can do so little to recover for us what we've lost.  Against\nthe Zeppelin air fleet, and the Dreadnought sea squadrons and the new\nGelberhaus cruisers, the last word in maritime mobility, of what avail is\nloyal devotion plus half-a-dozen warships, one keel to ten, scattered\nover one or two ocean coasts?\"\n\n\"Ah, but they'll build,\" said the fisherman confidently; \"they'll build.\nThey're only waiting to enlarge their dockyard accommodation and get the\nright class of artificers and engineers and workmen together.  The money\nwill be forthcoming somehow, and they'll start in and build.\"\n\n\"And do you suppose,\" asked Yeovil in slow bitter contempt, \"that the\nvictorious nation is going to sit and watch and wait till the defeated\nfoe has created a new war fleet, big enough to drive it from the seas?  Do\nyou suppose it is going to watch keel added to keel, gun to gun, airship\nto airship, till its preponderance has been wiped out or even threatened?\nThat sort of thing is done once in a generation, not twice.  Who is going\nto protect Australia or New Zealand while they enlarge their dockyards\nand hangars and build their dreadnoughts and their airships?\"\n\n\"Here's my station and I'm not sorry,\" said the fisherman, gathering his\ntackle together and rising to depart; \"I've listened to you long enough.\nYou and me wouldn't agree, not if we was to talk all day.  Fact is, I'm\nan out-and-out patriot and you're only a half-hearted one.  That's what\nyou are, half-hearted.\"\n\nAnd with that parting shot he left the carriage and lounged heavily down\nthe platform, a patriot who had never handled a rifle or mounted a horse\nor pulled an oar, but who had never flinched from demolishing his\ncountry's enemies with his tongue.\n\n\"England has never had any lack of patriots of that type,\" thought Yeovil\nsadly; \"so many patriots and so little patriotism.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII: TORYWOOD\n\n\nYeovil got out of the train at a small, clean, wayside station, and\nrapidly formed the conclusion that neatness, abundant leisure, and a\ndevotion to the cultivation of wallflowers and wyandottes were the\nprevailing influences of the station-master's life.  The train slid away\ninto the hazy distance of trees and meadows, and left the traveller\nstanding in a world that seemed to be made up in equal parts of rock\ngarden, chicken coops, and whiskey advertisements.  The station-master,\nwho appeared also to act as emergency porter, took Yeovil's ticket with\nthe gesture of a kind-hearted person brushing away a troublesome wasp,\nand returned to a study of the Poultry Chronicle, which was giving its\nreaders sage counsel concerning the ailments of belated July chickens.\nYeovil called to mind the station-master of a tiny railway town in\nSiberia, who had held him in long and rather intelligent converse on the\npoetical merits and demerits of Shelley, and he wondered what the result\nwould be if he were to engage the English official in a discussion on\nLermontoff--or for the matter of that, on Shelley.  The temptation to\nexperiment was, however, removed by the arrival of a young groom, with\nbrown eyes and a friendly smile, who hurried into the station and took\nYeovil once more into a world where he was of fleeting importance.\n\nIn the roadway outside was a four-wheeled dogcart with a pair of the\nfamous Torywood blue roans.  It was an agreeable variation in modern\nlocomotion to be met at a station with high-class horseflesh instead of\nthe ubiquitous motor, and the landscape was not of such a nature that one\nwished to be whirled through it in a cloud of dust.  After a quick spin\nof some ten or fifteen minutes through twisting hedge-girt country roads,\nthe roans turned in at a wide gateway, and went with dancing, rhythmic\nstep along the park drive.  The screen of oak-crowned upland suddenly\nfell away and a grey sharp-cornered building came into view in a setting\nof low growing beeches and dark pines.  Torywood was not a stately,\nreposeful-looking house; it lay amid the sleepy landscape like a couched\nwatchdog with pricked ears and wakeful eyes.  Built somewhere about the\nlast years of Dutch William's reign, it had been a centre, ever since,\nfor the political life of the countryside; a storm centre of discontent\nor a rallying ground for the well affected, as the circumstances of the\nday might entail.  On the stone-flagged terrace in front of the house,\nwith its quaint leaden figures of Diana pursuing a hound-pressed stag,\nsuccessive squires and lords of Torywood had walked to and fro with their\nfriends, watching the thunderclouds on the political horizon or the\nshifting shadows on the sundial of political favour, tapping the\npolitical barometer for indications of change, working out a party\ncampaign or arranging for the support of some national movement.  To and\nfro they had gone in their respective generations, men with the passion\nfor statecraft and political combat strong in their veins, and many oft-\nrecurring names had echoed under those wakeful-looking casements, names\nspoken in anger or exultation, or murmured in fear and anxiety:\nBolingbroke, Charles Edward, Walpole, the Farmer King, Bonaparte, Pitt,\nWellington, Peel, Gladstone--echo and Time might have graven those names\non the stone flags and grey walls.  And now one tired old woman walked\nthere, with names on her lips that she never uttered.\n\nA friendly riot of fox terriers and spaniels greeted the carriage,\nleaping and rolling and yelping in an exuberance of sociability, as\nthough horses and coachman and groom were comrades who had been absent\nfor long months instead of half an hour.  An indiscriminately\naffectionate puppy lay flat and whimpering at Yeovil's feet, sending up\nlittle showers of gravel with its wildly thumping tail, while two of the\nterriers raced each other madly across lawn and shrubbery, as though to\nshow the blue roans what speed really was.  The laughing-eyed young groom\ndisentangled the puppy from between Yeovil's legs, and then he was\nushered into the grey silence of the entrance hall, leaving sunlight and\nnoise and the stir of life behind him.\n\n\"Her ladyship will see you in her writing room,\" he was told, and he\nfollowed a servant along the dark passages to the well-remembered room.\n\nThere was something tragic in the sudden contrast between the vigour and\nyouth and pride of life that Yeovil had seen crystallised in those\ndancing, high-stepping horses, scampering dogs, and alert, clean-limbed\nyoung men-servants, and the age-frail woman who came forward to meet him.\n\nEleanor, Dowager Lady Greymarten, had for more than half a century been\nthe ruling spirit at Torywood.  The affairs of the county had not\nsufficed for her untiring activities of mind and body; in the wider field\nof national and Imperial service she had worked and schemed and fought\nwith an energy and a far-sightedness that came probably from the blend of\ncaution and bold restlessness in her Scottish blood.  For many educated\nminds the arena of politics and public life is a weariness of dust and\ndisgust, to others it is a fascinating study, to be watched from the\ncomfortable seat of a spectator.  To her it was a home.  In her town\nhouse or down at Torywood, with her writing-pad on her knee and the\ntelephone at her elbow, or in personal counsel with some trusted\ncolleague or persuasive argument with a halting adherent or\nhalf-convinced opponent, she had laboured on behalf of the poor and the\nill-equipped, had fought for her idea of the Right, and above all, for\nthe safety and sanity of her Fatherland.  Spadework when necessary and\nleadership when called for, came alike within the scope of her\nactivities, and not least of her achievements, though perhaps she hardly\nrealised it, was the force of her example, a lone, indomitable fighter\ncalling to the half-caring and the half-discouraged, to the laggard and\nthe slow-moving.\n\nAnd now she came across the room with \"the tired step of a tired king,\"\nand that look which the French so expressively called l'air defait.  The\ncharm which Heaven bestows on old ladies, reserving its highest gift to\nthe end, had always seemed in her case to be lost sight of in the dignity\nand interest of a great dame who was still in the full prime of her\nfighting and ruling powers.  Now, in Yeovil's eyes, she had suddenly come\nto be very old, stricken with the forlorn languor of one who knows that\ndeath will be weary to wait for.  She had spared herself nothing in the\nlong labour, the ceaseless building, the watch and ward, and in one short\nautumn week she had seen the overthrow of all that she had built, the\nfalling asunder of the world in which she had laboured.  Her life's end\nwas like a harvest home when blight and storm have laid waste the fruit\nof long toil and unsparing outlay.  Victory had been her goal, the death\nor victory of old heroic challenge, for she had always dreamed to die\nfighting to the last; death or victory--and the gods had given her\nneither, only the bitterness of a defeat that could not be measured in\nwords, and the weariness of a life that had outlived happiness or hope.\nSuch was Eleanor, Dowager Lady Greymarten, a shadow amid the young red-\nblooded life at Torywood, but a shadow that was too real to die, a shadow\nthat was stronger than the substance that surrounded it.\n\nYeovil talked long and hurriedly of his late travels, of the vast\nSiberian forests and rivers, the desolate tundras, the lakes and marshes\nwhere the wild swans rear their broods, the flower carpet of the summer\nfields and the winter ice-mantle of Russia's northern sea.  He talked as\na man talks who avoids the subject that is uppermost in his mind, and in\nthe mind of his hearer, as one who looks away from a wound or deformity\nthat is too cruel to be taken notice of.\n\nTea was served in a long oak-panelled gallery, where generations of\nMustelfords had romped and played as children, and remained yet in\neffigy, in a collection of more or less faithful portraits.  After tea\nYeovil was taken by his hostess to the aviaries, which constituted the\nsole claim which Torywood possessed to being considered a show place.  The\nthird Earl of Greymarten had collected rare and interesting birds,\nsomewhere about the time when Gilbert White was penning the last of his\ndeathless letters, and his successors in the title had perpetuated the\nhobby.  Little lawns and ponds and shrubberies were partitioned off for\nthe various ground-loving species, and higher cages with interlacing\nperches and rockwork shelves accommodated the birds whose natural\nexpression of movement was on the wing.  Quails and francolins scurried\nabout under low-growing shrubs, peacock-pheasants strutted and sunned\nthemselves, pugnacious ruffs engaged in perfunctory battles, from force\nof habit now that the rivalry of the mating season was over; choughs,\nravens, and loud-throated gulls occupied sections of a vast rockery, and\nbright-hued Chinese pond-herons and delicately stepping egrets waded\namong the waterlilies of a marble-terraced tank.  One or two dusky shapes\nseen dimly in the recesses of a large cage built round a hollow tree\nwould be lively owls when evening came on.\n\nIn the course of his many wanderings Yeovil had himself contributed three\nor four inhabitants to this little feathered town, and he went round the\nenclosures, renewing old acquaintances and examining new additions.\n\n\"The falcon cage is empty,\" said Lady Greymarten, pointing to a large\nwired dome that towered high above the other enclosures, \"I let the\nlanner fly free one day.  The other birds may be reconciled to their\ncomfortable quarters and abundant food and absence of dangers, but I\ndon't think all those things could make up to a falcon for the wild range\nof cliff and desert.  When one has lost one's own liberty one feels a\nquicker sympathy for other caged things, I suppose.\"\n\nThere was silence for a moment, and then the Dowager went on, in a\nwistful, passionate voice:\n\n\"I am an old woman now, Murrey, I must die in my cage.  I haven't the\nstrength to fight.  Age is a very real and very cruel thing, though we\nmay shut our eyes to it and pretend it is not there.  I thought at one\ntime that I should never really know what it meant, what it brought to\none.  I thought of it as a messenger that one could keep waiting out in\nthe yard till the very last moment.  I know now what it means. . . .  But\nyou, Murrey, you are young, you can fight.  Are you going to be a\nfighter, or the very humble servant of the fait accompli?\"\n\n\"I shall never be the servant of the fait accompli,\" said Yeovil.  \"I\nloathe it.  As to fighting, one must first find out what weapon to use,\nand how to use it effectively.  One must watch and wait.\"\n\n\"One must not wait too long,\" said the old woman.  \"Time is on their\nside, not ours.  It is the young people we must fight for now, if they\nare ever to fight for us.  A new generation will spring up, a weaker\nmemory of old glories will survive, the eclat of the ruling race will\ncapture young imaginations.  If I had your youth, Murrey, and your sex, I\nwould become a commercial traveller.\"\n\n\"A commercial traveller!\" exclaimed Yeovil.\n\n\"Yes, one whose business took him up and down the country, into contact\nwith all classes, into homes and shops and inns and railway carriages.\nAnd as I travelled I would work, work on the minds of every boy and girl\nI came across, every young father and young mother too, every young\ncouple that were going to be man and wife.  I would awaken or keep alive\nin their memory the things that we have been, the grand, brave things\nthat some of our race have done, and I would stir up a longing, a\ndetermination for the future that we must win back.  I would be a counter-\nagent to the agents of the fait accompli.  In course of time the\nGovernment would find out what I was doing, and I should be sent out of\nthe country, but I should have accomplished something, and others would\ncarry on the work.  That is what I would do.  Murrey, even if it is to be\na losing battle, fight it, fight it!\"\n\nYeovil knew that the old lady was fighting her last battle, rallying the\ndiscouraged, and spurring on the backward.\n\nA footman came to announce that the carriage waited to take him back to\nthe station.  His hostess walked with him through the hall, and came out\non to the stone-flagged terrace, the terrace from which a former Lady\nGreymarten had watched the twinkling bonfires that told of Waterloo.\n\nYeovil said good-bye to her as she stood there, a wan, shrunken shadow,\nyet with a greater strength and reality in her flickering life than those\nparrot men and women that fluttered and chattered through London drawing-\nrooms and theatre foyers.\n\nAs the carriage swung round a bend in the drive Yeovil looked back at\nTorywood, a lone, grey building, couched like a watchdog with pricked\nears and wakeful eyes in the midst of the sleeping landscape.  An old\npleading voice was still ringing in his ears:\n\n   Imperious and yet forlorn,\n   Came through the silence of the trees,\n   The echoes of a golden horn,\n   Calling to distances.\n\nSomehow Yeovil knew that he would never hear that voice again, and he\nknew, too, that he would hear it always, with its message, \"Be a\nfighter.\"  And he knew now, with a shamefaced consciousness that sprang\nsuddenly into existence, that the summons would sound for him in vain.\n\nThe weary brain-torturing months of fever had left their trail behind, a\nlassitude of spirit and a sluggishness of blood, a quenching of the\ndesire to roam and court adventure and hardship.  In the hours of waking\nand depression between the raging intervals of delirium he had\nspeculated, with a sort of detached, listless indifference, on the\nchances of his getting back to life and strength and energy.  The\nprospect of filling a corner of some lonely Siberian graveyard or Finnish\ncemetery had seemed near realisation at times, and for a man who was\nalready half dead the other half didn't particularly matter.  But when he\nhad allowed himself to dwell on the more hopeful side of the case it had\nalways been a complete recovery that awaited him; the same Yeovil as of\nyore, a little thinner and more lined about the eyes perhaps, would go\nthrough life in the same way, alert, resolute, enterprising, ready to\nstart off at short notice for some desert or upland where the eagles were\ncircling and the wild-fowl were calling.  He had not reckoned that Death,\nevaded and held off by the doctors' skill, might exact a compromise, and\nthat only part of the man would go free to the West.\n\nAnd now he began to realise how little of mental and physical energy he\ncould count on.  His own country had never seemed in his eyes so comfort-\nyielding and to-be-desired as it did now when it had passed into alien\nkeeping and become a prison land as much as a homeland.  London with its\nthin mockery of a Season, and its chattering horde of empty-hearted self-\nseekers, held no attraction for him, but the spell of English country\nlife was weaving itself round him, now that the charm of the desert was\nreceding into a mist of memories.  The waning of pleasant autumn days in\nan English woodland, the whir of game birds in the clean harvested\nfields, the grey moist mornings in the saddle, with the magical cry of\nhounds coming up from some misty hollow, and then the delicious abandon\nof physical weariness in bathroom and bedroom after a long run, and the\nheavenly snatched hour of luxurious sleep, before stirring back to life\nand hunger, the coming of the dinner hour and the jollity of a\nwell-chosen house-party.\n\nThat was the call which was competing with that other trumpet-call, and\nYeovil knew on which side his choice would incline.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV: \"A PERFECTLY GLORIOUS AFTERNOON\"\n\n\nIt was one of the last days of July, cooled and freshened by a touch of\nrain and dropping back again to a languorous warmth.  London looked at\nits summer best, rain-washed and sun-lit, with the maximum of coming and\ngoing in its more fashionable streets.\n\nCicely Yeovil sat in a screened alcove of the Anchorage Restaurant, a\nfeeding-ground which had lately sprung into favour.  Opposite her sat\nRonnie, confronting the ruins of what had been a dish of prawns in aspic.\nCool and clean and fresh-coloured, he was good to look on in the eyes of\nhis companion, and yet, perhaps, there was a ruffle in her soul that\ncalled for some answering disturbance on the part of that superbly\ntranquil young man, and certainly called in vain.  Cicely had set up for\nherself a fetish of onyx with eyes of jade, and doubtless hungered at\ntimes with an unreasonable but perfectly natural hunger for something of\nflesh and blood.  It was the religion of her life to know exactly what\nshe wanted and to see that she got it, but there was no possible\nguarantee against her occasionally experiencing a desire for something\nelse.  It is the golden rule of all religions that no one should really\nlive up to their precepts; when a man observes the principles of his\nreligion too exactly he is in immediate danger of founding a new sect.\n\n\"To-day is going to be your day of triumph,\" said Cicely to the young\nman, who was wondering at the moment whether he would care to embark on\nan artichoke; \"I believe I'm more nervous than you are,\" she added, \"and\nyet I rather hate the idea of you scoring a great success.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Ronnie, diverting his mind for a moment from the artichoke\nquestion and its ramifications of sauce hollandaise or vinaigre.\n\n\"I like you as you are,\" said Cicely, \"just a nice-looking boy to flatter\nand spoil and pretend to be fond of.  You've got a charming young body\nand you've no soul, and that's such a fascinating combination.  If you\nhad a soul you would either dislike or worship me, and I'd much rather\nhave things as they are.  And now you are going to go a step beyond that,\nand other people will applaud you and say that you are wonderful, and\ninvite you to eat with them and motor with them and yacht with them.  As\nsoon as that begins to happen, Ronnie, a lot of other things will come to\nan end.  Of course I've always known that you don't really care for me,\nbut as soon as the world knows it you are irrevocably damaged as a\nplaything.  That is the great secret that binds us together, the\nknowledge that we have no real affection for one another.  And this\nafternoon every one will know that you are a great artist, and no great\nartist was ever a great lover.\"\n\n\"I shan't be difficult to replace, anyway,\" said Ronnie, with what he\nimagined was a becoming modesty; \"there are lots of boys standing round\nready to be fed and flattered and put on an imaginary pedestal, most of\nthem more or less good-looking and well turned out and amusing to talk\nto.\"\n\n\"Oh, I dare say I could find a successor for your vacated niche,\" said\nCicely lightly; \"one thing I'm determined on though, he shan't be a\nmusician.  It's so unsatisfactory to have to share a grand passion with a\ngrand piano.  He shall be a delightful young barbarian who would think\nSaint Saens was a Derby winner or a claret.\"\n\n\"Don't be in too much of a hurry to replace me,\" said Ronnie, who did not\ncare to have his successor too seriously discussed.  \"I may not score the\nsuccess you expect this afternoon.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, a minor crowned head from across the sea is coming to hear\nyou play, and that alone will count as a success with most of your\nlisteners.  Also, I've secured a real Duchess for you, which is rather an\nachievement in the London of to-day.\"\n\n\"An English Duchess?\" asked Ronnie, who had early in life learned to\napply the Merchandise Marks Act to ducal titles.\n\n\"English, oh certainly, at least as far as the title goes; she was born\nunder the constellation of the Star-spangled Banner.  I don't suppose the\nDuke approves of her being here, lending her countenance to the fait\naccompli, but when you've got republican blood in your veins a Kaiser is\nquite as attractive a lodestar as a King, rather more so.  And Canon\nMousepace is coming,\" continued Cicely, referring to a closely-written\nlist of guests; \"the excellent von Tolb has been attending his church\nlately, and the Canon is longing to meet her.  She is just the sort of\nperson he adores.  I fancy he sincerely realises how difficult it will be\nfor the rich to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, and he tries to make up for\nit by being as nice as possible to them in this world.\"\n\nRonnie held out his hand for the list.\n\n\"I think you know most of the others,\" said Cicely, passing it to him.\n\n\"Leutnant von Gabelroth?\" read out Ronnie; \"who is he?\"\n\n\"In one of the hussar regiments quartered here; a friend of the Grafin's.\nUgly but amiable, and I'm told a good cross-country rider.  I suppose\nMurrey will be disgusted at meeting the 'outward and visible sign' under\nhis roof, but these encounters are inevitable as long as he is in\nLondon.\"\n\n\"I didn't know Murrey was coming,\" said Ronnie.\n\n\"I believe he's going to look in on us,\" said Cicely; \"it's just as well,\nyou know, otherwise we should have Joan asking in her loudest voice when\nhe was going to be back in England again.  I haven't asked her, but she\noverheard the Grafin arranging to come and hear you play, and I fancy\nthat will be quite enough.\"\n\n\"How about some Turkish coffee?\" said Ronnie, who had decided against the\nartichoke.\n\n\"Turkish coffee, certainly, and a cigarette, and a moment's peace before\nthe serious business of the afternoon claims us.  Talking about peace, do\nyou know, Ronnie, it has just occurred to me that we have left out one of\nthe most important things in our affaire; we have never had a quarrel.\"\n\n\"I hate quarrels,\" said Ronnie, \"they are so domesticated.\"\n\n\"That's the first time I've ever heard you talk about your home,\" said\nCicely.\n\n\"I fancy it would apply to most homes,\" said Ronnie.\n\n\"The last boy-friend I had used to quarrel furiously with me at least\nonce a week,\" said Cicely reflectively; \"but then he had dark slumberous\neyes that lit up magnificently when he was angry, so it would have been a\nsheer waste of God's good gifts not to have sent him into a passion now\nand then.\"\n\n\"With your excursions into the past and the future you are making me feel\ndreadfully like an instalment of a serial novel,\" protested Ronnie; \"we\nhave now got to 'synopsis of earlier chapters.'\"\n\n\"It shan't be teased,\" said Cicely; \"we will live in the present and go\nno further into the future than to make arrangements for Tuesday's dinner-\nparty.  I've asked the Duchess; she would never have forgiven me if she'd\nfound out that I had a crowned head dining with me and hadn't asked her\nto meet him.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nA sudden hush descended on the company gathered in the great drawing-room\nat Berkshire Street as Ronnie took his seat at the piano; the voice of\nCanon Mousepace outlasted the others for a moment or so, and then\nsubsided into a regretful but gracious silence.  For the next nine or ten\nminutes Ronnie held possession of the crowded room, a tense slender\nfigure, with cold green eyes aflame in a sudden fire, and smooth\nburnished head bent low over the keyboard that yielded a disciplined riot\nof melody under his strong deft fingers.  The world-weary Landgraf forgot\nfor the moment the regrettable trend of his subjects towards\nParliamentary Socialism, the excellent Grafin von Tolb forgot all that\nthe Canon had been saying to her for the last ten minutes, forgot the\ndepressing certainty that he would have a great deal more that he wanted\nto say in the immediate future, over and above the thirty-five minutes or\nso of discourse that she would contract to listen to next Sunday.  And\nCicely listened with the wistful equivocal triumph of one whose goose has\nturned out to be a swan and who realises with secret concern that she has\nonly planned the role of goosegirl for herself.\n\nThe last chords died away, the fire faded out of the jade-coloured eyes,\nand Ronnie became once more a well-groomed youth in a drawing-room full\nof well-dressed people.  But around him rose an explosive clamour of\napplause and congratulation, the sincere tribute of appreciation and the\nequally hearty expression of imitative homage.\n\n\"It is a great gift, a great gift,\" chanted Canon Mousepace, \"You must\nput it to a great use.  A talent is vouchsafed to us for a purpose; you\nmust fulfil the purpose.  Talent such as yours is a responsibility; you\nmust meet that responsibility.\"\n\nThe dictionary of the English language was an inexhaustible quarry, from\nwhich the Canon had hewn and fashioned for himself a great reputation.\n\n\"You must gom and blay to me at Schlachsenberg,\" said the kindly-faced\nLandgraf, whom the world adored and thwarted in about equal proportions.\n\"At Christmas, yes, that will be a good time.  We still keep the Christ-\nFest at Schlachsenberg, though the 'Sozi' keep telling our schoolchildren\nthat it is only a Christ myth.  Never mind, I will have the\nVice-President of our Landtag to listen to you; he is 'Sozi' but we are\ngood friends outside the Parliament House; you shall blay to him, my\nyoung friendt, and gonfince him that there is a Got in Heaven.  You will\ngom?  Yes?\"\n\n\"It was beautiful,\" said the Grafin simply; \"it made me cry.  Go back to\nthe piano again, please, at once.\"\n\nPerhaps the near neighbourhood of the Canon inspired this command, but\nthe Grafin had been genuinely charmed.  She adored good music and she was\nunaffectedly fond of good-looking boys.\n\nRonnie went back to the piano and tasted the matured pleasure of a\nrepeated success.  Any measure of nervousness that he may have felt at\nfirst had completely passed away.  He was sure of his audience and he\nplayed as though they did not exist.  A renewed clamour of excited\napproval attended the conclusion of his performance.\n\n\"It is a triumph, a perfectly glorious triumph,\" exclaimed the Duchess of\nDreyshire, turning to Yeovil, who sat silent among his wife's guests;\n\"isn't it just glorious?\" she demanded, with a heavy insistent intonation\nof the word.\n\n\"Is it?\" said Yeovil.\n\n\"Well, isn't it?\" she cried, with a rising inflection, \"isn't it just\nperfectly glorious?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" confessed Yeovil; \"you see glory hasn't come very much my\nway lately.\"  Then, before he exactly realised what he was doing, he\nraised his voice and quoted loudly for the benefit of half the room:\n\n   \"'Other Romans shall arise,\n   Heedless of a soldier's name,\n   Sounds, not deeds, shall win the prize,\n   Harmony the path to fame.'\"\n\nThere was a sort of shiver of surprised silence at Yeovil's end of the\nroom.\n\n\"Hell!\"\n\nThe word rang out in a strong young voice.\n\n\"Hell!  And it's true, that's the worst of it.  It's damned true!\"\n\nYeovil turned, with some dozen others, to see who was responsible for\nthis vigorously expressed statement.\n\nTony Luton confronted him, an angry scowl on his face, a blaze in his\nheavy-lidded eyes.  The boy was without a conscience, almost without a\nsoul, as priests and parsons reckon souls, but there was a slumbering\ndevil-god within him, and Yeovil's taunting words had broken the slumber.\nLife had been for Tony a hard school, in which right and wrong, high\nendeavour and good resolve, were untaught subjects; but there was a\nsterling something in him, just that something that helped poor street-\nscavenged men to die brave-fronted deaths in the trenches of Salamanca,\nthat fired a handful of apprentice boys to shut the gates of Derry and\nstare unflinchingly at grim leaguer and starvation.  It was just that\nnameless something that was lacking in the young musician, who stood at\nthe further end of the room, bathed in a flood of compliment and\ncongratulation, enjoying the honey-drops of his triumph.\n\nLuton pushed his way through the crowd and left the room, without\ntroubling to take leave of his hostess.\n\n\"What a strange young man,\" exclaimed the Duchess; \"now do take me into\nthe next room,\" she went on almost in the same breath, \"I'm just dying\nfor some iced coffee.\"\n\nYeovil escorted her through the throng of Ronnie-worshippers to the\ndesired haven of refreshment.\n\n\"Marvellous!\" Mrs. Menteith-Mendlesohnn was exclaiming in ringing trumpet\ntones; \"of course I always knew he could play, but this is not mere piano\nplaying, it is tone-mastery, it is sound magic.  Mrs. Yeovil has\nintroduced us to a new star in the musical firmament.  Do you know, I\nfeel this afternoon just like Cortez, in the poem, gazing at the newly\ndiscovered sea.\"\n\n\"'Silent upon a peak in Darien,'\" quoted a penetrating voice that could\nonly belong to Joan Mardle; \"I say, can any one picture Mrs. Menteith-\nMendlesohnn silent on any peak or under any circumstances?\"\n\nIf any one had that measure of imagination, no one acknowledged the fact.\n\n\"A great gift and a great responsibility,\" Canon Mousepace was assuring\nthe Grafin; \"the power of evoking sublime melody is akin to the power of\nawakening thought; a musician can appeal to dormant consciousness as the\npreacher can appeal to dormant conscience.  It is a responsibility, an\ninstrument for good or evil.  Our young friend here, we may be sure, will\nuse it as an instrument for good.  He has, I feel certain, a sense of his\nresponsibility.\"\n\n\"He is a nice boy,\" said the Grafin simply; \"he has such pretty hair.\"\n\nIn one of the window recesses Rhapsodie Pantril was talking vaguely but\nbeautifully to a small audience on the subject of chromatic chords; she\nhad the advantage of knowing what she was talking about, an advantage\nthat her listeners did not in the least share.  \"All through his playing\nthere ran a tone-note of malachite green,\" she declared recklessly,\nfeeling safe from immediate contradiction; \"malachite green, my\ncolour--the colour of striving.\"\n\nHaving satisfied the ruling passion that demanded gentle and dextrous\nself-advertisement, she realised that the Augusta Smith in her craved\nrefreshment, and moved with one of her over-awed admirers towards the\nhaven where peaches and iced coffee might be considered a certainty.\n\nThe refreshment alcove, which was really a good-sized room, a sort of\nchapel-of-ease to the larger drawing-room, was already packed with a\ncrowd who felt that they could best discuss Ronnie's triumph between\nmouthfuls of fruit salad and iced draughts of hock-cup.  So brief is\nhuman glory that two or three independent souls had even now drifted from\nthe theme of the moment on to other more personally interesting topics.\n\n\"Iced mulberry salad, my dear, it's a specialite de la maison, so to\nspeak; they say the roving husband brought the recipe from Astrakhan, or\nSeville, or some such outlandish place.\"\n\n\"I wish my husband would roam about a bit and bring back strange\npalatable dishes.  No such luck, he's got asthma and has to keep on a\ngravel soil with a south aspect and all sorts of other restrictions.\"\n\n\"I don't think you're to be pitied in the least; a husband with asthma is\nlike a captive golf-ball, you can always put your hand on him when you\nwant him.\"\n\n\"All the hangings, violette de Parme, all the furniture, rosewood.\nNothing is to be played in it except Mozart.  Mozart only.  Some of my\nfriends wanted me to have a replica of the Mozart statue at Vienna put up\nin a corner of the room, with flowers always around it, but I really\ncouldn't.  I couldn't.  One is so tired of it, one sees it everywhere.  I\ncouldn't do it.  I'm like that, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've secured the hero of the hour, Ronnie Storre, oh yes, rather.\nHe's going to join our yachting trip, third week of August.  We're going\nas far afield as Fiume, in the Adriatic--or is it the AEgean?  Won't it\nbe jolly.  Oh no, we're not asking Mrs. Yeovil; it's quite a small yacht\nyou know--at least, it's a small party.\"\n\nThe excellent von Tolb took her departure, bearing off with her the\nLandgraf, who had already settled the date and duration of Ronnie's\nChristmas visit.\n\n\"It will be dull, you know,\" he warned the prospective guest; \"our\nLandtag will not be sitting, and what is a bear-garden without the bears?\nHowever, we haf some wildt schwein in our woods, we can show you some\nsport in that way.\"\n\nRonnie instantly saw himself in a well-fitting shooting costume, with a\nTyrolese hat placed at a very careful angle on his head, but he confessed\nthat the other details of boar-hunting were rather beyond him.\n\nWith the departure of the von Tolb party Canon Mousepace gravitated\ndecently but persistently towards a corner where the Duchess, still at\nconcert pitch, was alternatively praising Ronnie's performance and the\nmulberry salad.  Joan Mardle, who formed one of the group, was not openly\npraising any one, but she was paying a silent tribute to the salad.\n\n\"We were just talking about Ronnie Storre's music, Canon,\" said the\nDuchess; \"I consider it just perfectly glorious.\"\n\n\"It's a great talent, isn't it, Canon,\" put in Joan briskly, \"and of\ncourse it's a responsibility as well, don't you think?  Music can be such\nan influence, just as eloquence can; don't you agree with me?\"\n\nThe quarry of the English language was of course a public property, but\nit was disconcerting to have one's own particular barrow-load of sentence-\nbuilding material carried off before one's eyes.  The Canon's impressive\nhomily on Ronnie's gift and its possibilities had to be hastily whittled\ndown to a weakly acquiescent, \"Quite so, quite so.\"\n\n\"Have you tasted this iced mulberry salad, Canon?\" asked the Duchess;\n\"it's perfectly luscious.  Just hurry along and get some before it's all\ngone.\"\n\nAnd her Grace hurried along in an opposite direction, to thank Cicely for\npast favours and to express lively gratitude for the Tuesday to come.\n\nThe guests departed, with a rather irritating slowness, for which perhaps\nthe excellence of Cicely's buffet arrangements was partly responsible.\nThe great drawing-room seemed to grow larger and more oppressive as the\nhuman wave receded, and the hostess fled at last with some relief to the\nnarrower limits of her writing-room and the sedative influences of a\ncigarette.  She was inclined to be sorry for herself; the triumph of the\nafternoon had turned out much as she had predicted at lunch time.  Her\nidol of onyx had not been swept from its pedestal, but the pedestal\nitself had an air of being packed up ready for transport to some other\ntemple.  Ronnie would be flattered and spoiled by half a hundred people,\njust because he could conjure sounds out of a keyboard, and Cicely felt\nno great incentive to go on flattering and spoiling him herself.  And\nRonnie would acquiesce in his dismissal with the good grace born of\nindifference--the surest guarantor of perfect manners.  Already he had\nsocial engagements for the coming months in which she had no share; the\ndrifting apart would be mutual.  He had been an intelligent and amusing\ncompanion, and he had played the game as she had wished it to be played,\nwithout the fatigue of keeping up pretences which neither of them could\nhave believed in.  \"Let us have a wonderfully good time together\" had\nbeen the single stipulation in their unwritten treaty of comradeship, and\nthey had had the good time.  Their whole-hearted pursuit of material\nhappiness would go on as keenly as before, but they would hunt in\ndifferent company, that was all.  Yes, that was all. . . .\n\nCicely found the effect of her cigarette less sedative than she was\ndisposed to exact.  It might be necessary to change the brand.  Some ten\nor eleven days later Yeovil read an announcement in the papers that, in\nspite of handsome offers of increased salary, Mr. Tony Luton, the\noriginal singer of the popular ditty \"Eccleston Square,\" had terminated\nhis engagement with Messrs. Isaac Grosvenor and Leon Hebhardt of the\nCaravansery Theatre, and signed on as a deck hand in the Canadian Marine.\n\nPerhaps after all there had been some shred of glory amid the trumpet\ntriumph of that July afternoon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV: THE INTELLIGENT ANTICIPATOR OF WANTS\n\n\nTwo of Yeovil's London clubs, the two that he had been accustomed to\nfrequent, had closed their doors after the catastrophe.  One of them had\nperished from off the face of the earth, its fittings had been sold and\nits papers lay stored in some solicitor's office, a tit-bit of material\nfor the pen of some future historian.  The other had transplanted itself\nto Delhi, whither it had removed its early Georgian furniture and its\ntraditions, and sought to reproduce its St. James's Street atmosphere as\nnearly as the conditions of a tropical Asiatic city would permit.  There\nremained the Cartwheel, a considerably newer institution, which had\nsprung into existence somewhere about the time of Yeovil's last sojourn\nin England; he had joined it on the solicitation of a friend who was\ninterested in the venture, and his bankers had paid his subscription\nduring his absence.  As he had never been inside its doors there could be\nno depressing comparisons to make between its present state and aforetime\nglories, and Yeovil turned into its portals one afternoon with the\nadventurous detachment of a man who breaks new ground and challenges new\nexperiences.\n\nHe entered with a diffident sense of intrusion, conscious that his\nstanding as a member might not be recognised by the keepers of the doors;\nin a moment, however, he realised that a rajah's escort of elephants\nmight almost have marched through the entrance hall and vestibule without\nchallenge.  The general atmosphere of the scene suggested a blend of the\nrailway station at Cologne, the Hotel Bristol in any European capital,\nand the second act in most musical comedies.  A score of brilliant and\nbrilliantined pages decorated the foreground, while Hebraic-looking\ngentlemen, wearing tartan waistcoats of the clans of their adoption,\nflitted restlessly between the tape machines and telephone boxes.  The\narmy of occupation had obviously established a firm footing in the\nhospitable premises; a kaleidoscopic pattern of uniforms, sky-blue,\nindigo, and bottle-green, relieved the civilian attire of the groups that\nclustered in lounge and card rooms and corridors.  Yeovil rapidly came to\nthe conclusion that the joys of membership were not for him.  He had\nturned to go, after a very cursory inspection of the premises and their\nhuman occupants, when he was hailed by a young man, dressed with\nstrenuous neatness, whom he remembered having met in past days at the\nhouses of one or two common friends.\n\nHubert Herlton's parents had brought him into the world, and some twenty-\none years later had put him into a motor business.  Having taken these\npardonable liberties they had completely exhausted their ideas of what to\ndo with him, and Hubert seemed unlikely to develop any ideas of his own\non the subject.  The motor business elected to conduct itself without his\nconnivance; journalism, the stage, tomato culture (without capital), and\nother professions that could be entered on at short notice were submitted\nto his consideration by nimble-minded relations and friends.  He listened\nto their suggestions with polite indifference, being rude only to a\ncousin who demonstrated how he might achieve a settled income of from two\nhundred to a thousand pounds a year by the propagation of mushrooms in a\nLondon basement.  While his walk in life was still an undetermined\npromenade his parents died, leaving him with a carefully-invested income\nof thirty-seven pounds a year.  At that point of his career Yeovil's\nknowledge of him stopped short; the journey to Siberia had taken him\nbeyond the range of Herlton's domestic vicissitudes.\n\nThe young man greeted him in a decidedly friendly manner.\n\n\"I didn't know you were a member here,\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"It's the first time I've ever been in the club,\" said Yeovil, \"and I\nfancy it will be the last.  There is rather too much of the fighting\nmachine in evidence here.  One doesn't want a perpetual reminder of what\nhas happened staring one in the face.\"\n\n\"We tried at first to keep the alien element out,\" said Herlton\napologetically, \"but we couldn't have carried on the club if we'd stuck\nto that line.  You see we'd lost more than two-thirds of our old members\nso we couldn't afford to be exclusive.  As a matter of fact the whole\nthing was decided over our heads; a new syndicate took over the concern,\nand a new committee was installed, with a good many foreigners on it.  I\nknow it's horrid having these uniforms flaunting all over the place, but\nwhat is one to do?\"\n\nYeovil said nothing, with the air of a man who could have said a great\ndeal.\n\n\"I suppose you wonder, why remain a member under those conditions?\"\ncontinued Herlton.  \"Well, as far as I am concerned, a place like this is\na necessity for me.  In fact, it's my profession, my source of income.\"\n\n\"Are you as good at bridge as all that?\" asked Yeovil; \"I'm a fairly\nsuccessful player myself, but I should be sorry to have to live on my\nwinnings, year in, year out.\"\n\n\"I don't play cards,\" said Herlton, \"at least not for serious stakes.  My\nwinnings or losings wouldn't come to a tenner in an average year.  No, I\nlive by commissions, by introducing likely buyers to would-be sellers.\"\n\n\"Sellers of what?\" asked Yeovil.\n\n\"Anything, everything; horses, yachts, old masters, plate, shootings,\npoultry-farms, week-end cottages, motor cars, almost anything you can\nthink of.  Look,\" and he produced from his breast pocket a bulky note-\nbook illusorily inscribed \"engagements.\"\n\n\"Here,\" he explained, tapping the book, \"I've got a double entry of every\nlikely client that I know, with a note of the things he may have to sell\nand the things he may want to buy.  When it is something that he has for\nsale there are cross-references to likely purchasers of that particular\nline of article.  I don't limit myself to things that I actually know\npeople to be in want of, I go further than that and have theories,\ncarefully indexed theories, as to the things that people might want to\nbuy.  At the right moment, if I can get the opportunity, I mention the\narticle that is in my mind's eye to the possible purchaser who has also\nbeen in my mind's eye, and I frequently bring off a sale.  I started a\nchance acquaintance on a career of print-buying the other day merely by\ntelling him of a couple of good prints that I knew of, that were to be\nhad at a quite reasonable price; he is a man with more money than he\nknows what to do with, and he has laid out quite a lot on old prints\nsince his first purchase.  Most of his collection he has got through me,\nand of course I net a commission on each transaction.  So you see, old\nman, how useful, not to say necessary, a club with a large membership is\nto me.  The more mixed and socially chaotic it is, the more serviceable\nit is.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Yeovil, \"and I suppose, as a matter of fact, a good\nmany of your clients belong to the conquering race.\"\n\n\"Well, you see, they are the people who have got the money,\" said\nHerlton; \"I don't mean to say that the invading Germans are usually\npeople of wealth, but while they live over here they escape the crushing\ntaxation that falls on the British-born subject.  They serve their\ncountry as soldiers, and we have to serve it in garrison money, ship\nmoney and so forth, besides the ordinary taxes of the State.  The German\nshoulders the rifle, the Englishman has to shoulder everything else.  That\nis what will help more than anything towards the gradual Germanising of\nour big towns; the comparatively lightly-taxed German workman over here\nwill have a much bigger spending power and purchasing power than his\nheavily taxed English neighbour.  The public-houses, bars, eating-houses,\nplaces of amusement and so forth, will come to cater more and more for\nmoney-yielding German patronage.  The stream of British emigration will\nswell rather than diminish, and the stream of Teuton immigration will be\nequally persistent and progressive.  Yes, the military-service ordinance\nwas a cunning stroke on the part of that old fox, von Kwarl.  As a\ncivilian statesman he is far and away cleverer than Bismarck was; he\nsmothers with a feather-bed where Bismarck would have tried to smash with\na sledge-hammer.\"\n\n\"Have you got me down on your list of noteworthy people?\" asked Yeovil,\nturning the drift of the conversation back to the personal topic.\n\n\"Certainly I have,\" said Herlton, turning the pages of his pocket\ndirectory to the letter Y.  \"As soon as I knew you were back in England I\nmade several entries concerning you.  In the first place it was possible\nthat you might have a volume on Siberian travel and natural history notes\nto publish, and I've cross-referenced you to a publisher I know who\nrather wants books of that sort on his list.\"\n\n\"I may tell you at once that I've no intentions in that direction,\" said\nYeovil, in some amusement.\n\n\"Just as well,\" said Herlton cheerfully, scribbling a hieroglyphic in his\nbook; \"that branch of business is rather outside my line--too little in\nit, and the gratitude of author and publisher for being introduced to one\nanother is usually short-lived.  A more serious entry was the item that\nif you were wintering in England you would be looking out for a hunter or\ntwo.  You used to hunt with the East Wessex, I remember; I've got just\nthe very animal that will suit that country, ready waiting for you.  A\nbeautiful clean jumper.  I've put it over a fence or two myself, and you\nand I ride much the same weight.  A stiffish price is being asked for it,\nbut I've got the letters D.O. after your name.\"\n\n\"In Heaven's name,\" said Yeovil, now openly grinning, \"before I die of\ncuriosity tell me what D.O. stands for.\"\n\n\"It means some one who doesn't object to pay a good price for anything\nthat really suits him.  There are some people of course who won't\nconsider a thing unless they can get it for about a third of what they\nimagine to be its market value.  I've got another suggestion down against\nyou in my book; you may not be staying in the country at all, you may be\nclearing out in disgust at existing conditions.  In that case you would\nbe selling a lot of things that you wouldn't want to cart away with you.\nThat involves another set of entries and a whole lot of cross\nreferences.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I've given you a lot of trouble,\" said Yeovil drily.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Herlton, \"but it would simplify matters if we take it\nfor granted that you are going to stay here, for this winter anyhow, and\nare looking out for hunters.  Can you lunch with me here on Wednesday,\nand come and look at the animal afterwards?  It's only thirty-five\nminutes by train.  It will take us longer if we motor.  There is a two-\nfifty-three from Charing Cross that we could catch comfortably.\"\n\n\"If you are going to persuade me to hunt in the East Wessex country this\nseason,\" said Yeovil, \"you must find me a convenient hunting box\nsomewhere down there.\"\n\n\"I have found it,\" said Herlton, whipping out a stylograph, and hastily\nscribbling an \"order to view\" on a card; \"central as possible for all the\nmeets, grand stabling accommodation, excellent water-supply, big\nbathroom, game larder, cellarage, a bakehouse if you want to bake your\nown bread--\"\n\n\"Any land with it?\"\n\n\"Not enough to be a nuisance.  An acre or two of paddock and about the\nsame of garden.  You are fond of wild things; a wood comes down to the\nedge of the garden, a wood that harbours owls and buzzards and kestrels.\"\n\n\"Have you got all those details in your book?\" asked Yeovil; \"'wood\nadjoining property, O.B.K.'\"\n\n\"I keep those details in my head,\" said Herlton, \"but they are quite\nreliable.\"\n\n\"I shall insist on something substantial off the rent if there are no\nbuzzards,\" said Yeovil; \"now that you have mentioned them they seem an\nindispensable accessory to any decent hunting-box.  Look,\" he exclaimed,\ncatching sight of a plump middle-aged individual, crossing the vestibule\nwith an air of restrained importance, \"there goes the delectable\nPitherby.  Does he come on your books at all?\"\n\n\"I should say!\" exclaimed Herlton fervently.  \"The delectable P.\nnourishes expectations of a barony or viscounty at an early date.  Most\nof his life has been spent in streets and squares, with occasional\nmigrations to the esplanades of fashionable watering-places or the\ngravelled walks of country house gardens.  Now that noblesse is about to\nimpose its obligations on him, quite a new catalogue of wants has sprung\ninto his mind.  There are things that a plain esquire may leave undone\nwithout causing scandalised remark, but a fiercer light beats on a baron.\nTrigger-pulling is one of the obligations.  Up to the present Pitherby\nhas never hit a partridge in anger, but this year he has commissioned me\nto rent him a deer forest.  Some pedigree Herefords for his 'home farm'\nwas another commission, and a dozen and a half swans for a swannery.  The\nswannery, I may say, was my idea; I said once in his hearing that it gave\na baronial air to an estate; you see I knew a man who had got a lot of\nsurplus swan stock for sale.  Now Pitherby wants a heronry as well.  I've\nput him in communication with a client of mine who suffers from\nsuperfluous herons, but of course I can't guarantee that the birds'\nnesting arrangements will fall in with his territorial requirement.  I'm\ngetting him some carp, too, of quite respectable age, for a carp pond; I\nthought it would look so well for his lady-wife to be discovered by\ninterviewers feeding the carp with her own fair hands, and I put the same\nidea into Pitherby's mind.\"\n\n\"I had no idea that so many things were necessary to endorse a patent of\nnobility,\" said Yeovil.  \"If there should be any miscarriage in the\nbestowal of the honour at least Pitherby will have absolved himself from\nany charge of contributory negligence.\"\n\n\"Shall we say Wednesday, here, one o'clock, lunch first, and go down and\nlook at the horse afterwards?\" said Herlton, returning to the matter in\nhand.\n\nYeovil hesitated, then he nodded his head.\n\n\"There is no harm in going to look at the animal,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI: SUNRISE\n\n\nMrs. Kerrick sat at a little teak-wood table in the verandah of a low-\npitched teak-built house that stood on the steep slope of a brown\nhillside.  Her youngest child, with the grave natural dignity of nine-\nyear old girlhood, maintained a correct but observant silence, looking\ncarefully yet unobtrusively after the wants of the one guest, and\nchecking from time to time the incursions of ubiquitous ants that were\nobstinately disposed to treat the table-cloth as a foraging ground.  The\nwayfaring visitor, who was experiencing a British blend of Eastern\nhospitality, was a French naturalist, travelling thus far afield in quest\nof feathered specimens to enrich the aviaries of a bird-collecting Balkan\nKing.  On the previous evening, while shrugging his shoulders and\nunloosing his vocabulary over the meagre accommodation afforded by the\nnative rest-house, he had been enchanted by receiving an invitation to\ntransfer his quarters to the house on the hillside, where he found not\nonly a pleasant-voiced hostess and some drinkable wine, but three brown-\nskinned English youngsters who were able to give him a mass of\nintelligent first-hand information about the bird life of the region.  And\nnow, at the early morning breakfast, ere yet the sun was showing over the\nrim of the brown-baked hills, he was learning something of the life of\nthe little community he had chanced on.  \"I was in these parts many years\nago,\" explained the hostess, \"when my husband was alive and had an\nappointment out here.  It is a healthy hill district and I had pleasant\nmemories of the place, so when it became necessary, well, desirable let\nus say, to leave our English home and find a new one, it occurred to me\nto bring my boys and my little girl here--my eldest girl is at school in\nParis.  Labour is cheap here and I try my hand at farming in a small way.\nOf course it is very different work to just superintending the dairy and\npoultry-yard arrangements of an English country estate.  There are so\nmany things, insect ravages, bird depredations, and so on, that one only\nknows on a small scale in England, that happen here in wholesale fashion,\nnot to mention droughts and torrential rains and other tropical\nvisitations.  And then the domestic animals are so disconcertingly\ndifferent from the ones one has been used to; humped cattle never seem to\nbehave in the way that straight-backed cattle would, and goats and geese\nand chickens are not a bit the same here that they are in Europe--and of\ncourse the farm servants are utterly unlike the same class in England.\nOne has to unlearn a good deal of what one thought one knew about stock-\nkeeping and agriculture, and take note of the native ways of doing\nthings; they are primitive and unenterprising of course, but they have an\naccumulated store of experience behind them, and one has to tread warily\nin initiating improvements.\"\n\nThe Frenchman looked round at the brown sun-scorched hills, with the\ndusty empty road showing here and there in the middle distance and other\nbrown sun-scorched hills rounding off the scene; he looked at the lizards\non the verandah walls, at the jars for keeping the water cool, at the\nnumberless little insect-bored holes in the furniture, at the heat-drawn\nlines on his hostess's comely face.  Notwithstanding his present\nwanderings he had a Frenchman's strong homing instinct, and he marvelled\nto hear this lady, who should have been a lively and popular figure in\nthe social circle of some English county town, talking serenely of the\nways of humped cattle and native servants.\n\n\"And your children, how do they like the change?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is healthy up here among the hills,\" said the mother, also looking\nround at the landscape and thinking doubtless of a very different scene;\n\"they have an outdoor life and plenty of liberty.  They have their ponies\nto ride, and there is a lake up above us that is a fine place for them to\nbathe and boat in; the three boys are there now, having their morning\nswim.  The eldest is sixteen and he is allowed to have a gun, and there\nis some good wild fowl shooting to be had in the reed beds at the further\nend of the lake.  I think that part of the joy of his shooting\nexpeditions lies in the fact that many of the duck and plover that he\ncomes across belong to the same species that frequent our English moors\nand rivers.\"\n\nIt was the first hint that she had given of a wistful sense of exile, the\nyearning for other skies, the message that a dead bird's plumage could\nbring across rolling seas and scorching plains.\n\n\"And the education of your boys, how do you manage for that?\" asked the\nvisitor.\n\n\"There is a young tutor living out in these wilds,\" said Mrs. Kerrick;\n\"he was assistant master at a private school in Scotland, but it had to\nbe given up when--when things changed; so many of the boys left the\ncountry.  He came out to an uncle who has a small estate eight miles from\nhere, and three days in the week he rides over to teach my boys, and\nthree days he goes to another family living in the opposite direction.  To-\nday he is due to come here.  It is a great boon to have such an\nopportunity for getting the boys educated, and of course it helps him to\nearn a living.\"\n\n\"And the society of the place?\" asked the Frenchman.\n\nHis hostess laughed.\n\n\"I must admit it has to be looked for with a strong pair of\nfield-glasses,\" she said; \"it is almost as difficult to get a good bridge\nfour together as it would have been to get up a tennis tournament or a\nsubscription dance in our particular corner of England.  One has to\nignore distances and forget fatigue if one wants to be gregarious even on\na limited scale.  There are one or two officials who are our chief social\nmainstays, but the difficulty is to muster the few available souls under\nthe same roof at the same moment.  A road will be impassable in one\nquarter, a pony will be lame in another, a stress of work will prevent\nsome one else from coming, and another may be down with a touch of fever.\nWhen my little girl gave a birthday party here her only little girl guest\nhad come twelve miles to attend it.  The Forest officer happened to drop\nin on us that evening, so we felt quite festive.\"\n\nThe Frenchman's eyes grew round in wonder.  He had once thought that the\ncapital city of a Balkan kingdom was the uttermost limit of social\ndesolation, viewed from a Parisian standpoint, and there at any rate one\ncould get cafe chantant, tennis, picnic parties, an occasional theatre\nperformance by a foreign troupe, now and then a travelling circus, not to\nspeak of Court and diplomatic functions of a more or less sociable\ncharacter.  Here, it seemed, one went a day's journey to reach an\nevening's entertainment, and the chance arrival of a tired official took\non the nature of a festivity.  He looked round again at the rolling\nstretches of brown hills; before he had regarded them merely as the\nbackground to this little shut-away world, now he saw that they were\nforeground as well.  They were everything, there was nothing else.  And\nagain his glance travelled to the face of his hostess, with its bright,\npleasant eyes and smiling mouth.\n\n\"And you live here with your children,\" he said, \"here in this\nwilderness?  You leave England, you leave everything, for this?\"\n\nHis hostess rose and took him over to the far side of the verandah.  The\nbeginnings of a garden were spread out before them, with young fruit\ntrees and flowering shrubs, and bushes of pale pink roses.  Exuberant\ntropical growths were interspersed with carefully tended vestiges of\nplants that had evidently been brought from a more temperate climate, and\nhad not borne the transition well.  Bushes and trees and shrubs spread\naway for some distance, to where the ground rose in a small hillock and\nthen fell away abruptly into bare hillside.\n\n\"In all this garden that you see,\" said the Englishwoman, \"there is one\ntree that is sacred.\"\n\n\"A tree?\" said the Frenchman.\n\n\"A tree that we could not grow in England.\"\n\nThe Frenchman followed the direction of her eyes and saw a tall, bare\npole at the summit of the hillock.  At the same moment the sun came over\nthe hilltops in a deep, orange glow, and a new light stole like magic\nover the brown landscape.  And, as if they had timed their arrival to\nthat exact moment of sunburst, three brown-faced boys appeared under the\nstraight, bare pole.  A cord shivered and flapped, and something ran\nswiftly up into the air, and swung out in the breeze that blew across the\nhills--a blue flag with red and white crosses.  The three boys bared\ntheir heads and the small girl on the verandah steps stood rigidly to\nattention.  Far away down the hill, a young man, cantering into view\nround a corner of the dusty road, removed his hat in loyal salutation.\n\n\"That is why we live out here,\" said the Englishwoman quietly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII: THE EVENT OF THE SEASON\n\n\nIn the first swelter room of the new Osmanli Baths in Cork Street four or\nfive recumbent individuals, in a state of moist nudity and\nself-respecting inertia, were smoking cigarettes or making occasional\npretence of reading damp newspapers.  A glass wall with a glass door shut\nthem off from the yet more torrid regions of the further swelter\nchambers; another glass partition disclosed the dimly-lit vault where\nother patrons of the establishment had arrived at the stage of being\npounded and kneaded and sluiced by Oriental-looking attendants.  The\nsplashing and trickling of taps, the flip-flap of wet slippers on a wet\nfloor, and the low murmur of conversation, filtered through glass doors,\nmade an appropriately drowsy accompaniment to the scene.\n\nA new-comer fluttered into the room, beamed at one of the occupants, and\nsettled himself with an air of elaborate languor in a long canvas chair.\nCornelian Valpy was a fair young man, with perpetual surprise impinged on\nhis countenance, and a chin that seemed to have retired from competition\nwith the rest of his features.  The beam of recognition that he had given\nto his friend or acquaintance subsided into a subdued but lingering\nsimper.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" drawled his neighbour lazily, dropping the end of a\ncigarette into a small bowl of water, and helping himself from a silver\ncase on the table at his side.\n\n\"Matter?\" said Cornelian, opening wide a pair of eyes in which unhealthy\nintelligence seemed to struggle in undetermined battle with utter\nvacuity; \"why should you suppose that anything is the matter?\"\n\n\"When you wear a look of idiotic complacency in a Turkish bath,\" said the\nother, \"it is the more noticeable from the fact that you are wearing\nnothing else.\"\n\n\"Were you at the Shalem House dance last night?\" asked Cornelian, by way\nof explaining his air of complacent retrospection.\n\n\"No,\" said the other, \"but I feel as if I had been; I've been reading\ncolumns about it in the Dawn.\"\n\n\"The last event of the season,\" said Cornelian, \"and quite one of the\nmost amusing and lively functions that there have been.\"\n\n\"So the Dawn said; but then, as Shalem practically owns and controls that\npaper, its favourable opinion might be taken for granted.\"\n\n\"The whole idea of the Revel was quite original,\" said Cornelian, who was\nnot going to have his personal narrative of the event forestalled by\nanything that a newspaper reporter might have given to the public; \"a\ncertain number of guests went as famous personages in the world's\nhistory, and each one was accompanied by another guest typifying the\nprevailing characteristic of that personage.  One man went as Julius\nCaesar, for instance, and had a girl typifying ambition as his shadow,\nanother went as Louis the Eleventh, and his companion personified\nsuperstition.  Your shadow had to be someone of the opposite sex, you\nsee, and every alternate dance throughout the evening you danced with\nyour shadow-partner.  Quite a clever idea; young Graf von Schnatelstein\nis supposed to have invented it.\"\n\n\"New York will be deeply beholden to him,\" said the other;\n\"shadow-dances, with all manner of eccentric variations, will be the rage\nthere for the next eighteen months.\"\n\n\"Some of the costumes were really sumptuous,\" continued Cornelian; \"the\nDuchess of Dreyshire was magnificent as Aholibah, you never saw so many\njewels on one person, only of course she didn't look dark enough for the\ncharacter; she had Billy Carnset for her shadow, representing Unspeakable\nDepravity.\"\n\n\"How on earth did he manage that?\"\n\n\"Oh, a blend of Beardsley and Bakst as far as get-up and costume, and of\ncourse his own personality counted for a good deal.  Quite one of the\nsuccesses of the evening was Leutnant von Gabelroth, as George\nWashington, with Joan Mardle as his shadow, typifying Inconvenient\nCandour.  He put her down officially as Truthfulness, but every one had\nheard the other version.\"\n\n\"Good for the Gabelroth, though he does belong to the invading Horde;\nit's not often that any one scores off Joan.\"\n\n\"Another blaze of magnificence was the loud-voiced Bessimer woman, as the\nGoddess Juno, with peacock tails and opals all over her; she had Ronnie\nStorre to represent Green-eyed Jealousy.  Talking of Ronnie Storre and of\njealousy, you will naturally wonder whom Mrs. Yeovil went with.  I forget\nwhat her costume was, but she'd got that dark-headed youth with her that\nshe's been trotting round everywhere the last few days.\"\n\nCornelian's neighbour kicked him furtively on the shin, and frowned in\nthe direction of a dark-haired youth reclining in an adjacent chair.  The\nyouth in question rose from his seat and stalked into the further swelter\nroom.\n\n\"So clever of him to go into the furnace room,\" said the unabashed\nCornelian; \"now if he turns scarlet all over we shall never know how much\nis embarrassment and how much is due to the process of being boiled.  La\nYeovil hasn't done badly by the exchange; he's better looking than\nRonnie.\"\n\n\"I see that Pitherby went as Frederick the Great,\" said Cornelian's\nneighbour, fingering a sheet of the Dawn.\n\n\"Isn't that exactly what one would have expected Pitherby to do?\" said\nCornelian.  \"He's so desperately anxious to announce to all whom it may\nconcern that he has written a life of that hero.  He had an uninspiring-\nlooking woman with him, supposed to represent Military Genius.\"\n\n\"The Spirit of Advertisement would have been more appropriate,\" said the\nother.\n\n\"The opening scene of the Revel was rather effective,\" continued\nCornelian; \"all the Shadow people reclined in the dimly-lit centre of the\nballroom in an indistinguishable mass, and the human characters marched\nround the illuminated sides of the room to solemn processional music.\nEvery now and then a shadow would detach itself from the mass, hail its\npartner by name, and glide out to join him or her in the procession.\nThen, when the last shadows had found their mates and every one was\npartnered, the lights were turned up in a blaze, the orchestra crashed\nout a whirl of nondescript dance music, and people just let themselves\ngo.  It was Pandemonium.  Afterwards every one strutted about for half an\nhour or so, showing themselves off, and then the legitimate programme of\ndances began.  There were some rather amusing incidents throughout the\nevening.  One set of lancers was danced entirely by the Seven Deadly Sins\nand their human exemplars; of course seven couples were not sufficient to\nmake up the set, so they had to bring in an eighth sin, I forget what it\nwas.\"\n\n\"The sin of Patriotism would have been rather appropriate, considering\nwho were giving the dance,\" said the other.\n\n\"Hush!\" exclaimed Cornelian nervously.  \"You don't know who may overhear\nyou in a place like this.  You'll get yourself into trouble.\"\n\n\"Wasn't there some rather daring new dance of the 'bunny-hug' variety?\"\nasked the indiscreet one.\n\n\"The 'Cubby-Cuddle,'\" said Cornelian; \"three or four adventurous couples\ndanced it towards the end of the evening.\"\n\n\"The Dawn says that without being strikingly new it was strikingly\nmodern.\"\n\n\"The best description I can give of it,\" said Cornelian, \"is summed up in\nthe comment of the Grafin von Tolb when she saw it being danced: 'if they\nreally love each other I suppose it doesn't matter.'  By the way,\" he\nadded with apparent indifference, \"is there any detailed account of my\ncostume in the Dawn?\"\n\nHis companion laughed cynically.\n\n\"As if you hadn't read everything that the Dawn and the other morning\npapers have to say about the ball hours ago.\"\n\n\"The naked truth should be avoided in a Turkish bath,\" said Cornelian;\n\"kindly assume that I've only had time to glance at the weather forecast\nand the news from China.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said the other; \"your costume isn't described; you\nsimply come amid a host of others as 'Mr. Cornelian Valpy, resplendent as\nthe Emperor Nero; with him Miss Kate Lerra, typifying Insensate Vanity.'\nMany hard things have been said of Nero, but his unkindest critics have\nnever accused him of resembling you in feature.  Until some very clear\nevidence is produced I shall refuse to believe it.\"\n\nCornelian was proof against these shafts; leaning back gracefully in his\nchair he launched forth into that detailed description of his last\nnight's attire which the Dawn had so unaccountably failed to supply.\n\n\"I wore a tunic of white Nepaulese silk, with a collar of pearls, real\npearls.  Round my waist I had a girdle of twisted serpents in beaten\ngold, studded all over with amethysts.  My sandals were of gold, laced\nwith scarlet thread, and I had seven bracelets of gold on each arm.  Round\nmy head I had a wreath of golden laurel leaves set with scarlet berries,\nand hanging over my left shoulder was a silk robe of mulberry purple,\nbroidered with the signs of the zodiac in gold and scarlet; I had it made\nspecially for the occasion.  At my side I had an ivory-sheathed dagger,\nwith a green jade handle, hung in a green Cordova leather--\"\n\nAt this point of the recital his companion rose softly, flung his\ncigarette end into the little water-bowl, and passed into the further\nswelter room.  Cornelian Valpy was left, still clothed in a look of\nineffable complacency, still engaged, in all probability, in reclothing\nhimself in the finery of the previous evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII: THE DEAD WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND\n\n\nThe pale light of a November afternoon faded rapidly into the dusk of a\nNovember evening.  Far over the countryside housewives put up their\ncottage shutters, lit their lamps, and made the customary remark that the\ndays were drawing in.  In barn yards and poultry-runs the greediest\npullets made a final tour of inspection, picking up the stray remaining\nmorsels of the evening meal, and then, with much scrambling and\nsquawking, sought the places on the roosting-pole that they thought\nshould belong to them.  Labourers working in yard and field began to turn\ntheir thoughts homeward or tavernward as the case might be.  And through\nthe cold squelching slush of a water-logged meadow a weary, bedraggled,\nbut unbeaten fox stiffly picked his way, climbed a high bramble-grown\nbank, and flung himself into the sheltering labyrinth of a stretching\ntangle of woods.  The pack of fierce-mouthed things that had rattled him\nfrom copse and gorse-cover, along fallow and plough, hedgerow and wooded\nlane, for nigh on an hour, and had pressed hard on his life for the last\nfew minutes, receded suddenly into the background of his experiences.  The\ncold, wet meadow, the thick mask of woods, and the oncoming dusk had\nstayed the chase--and the fox had outstayed it.  In a short time he would\nfall mechanically to licking off some of the mud that caked on his weary\npads; in a shorter time horsemen and hounds would have drawn off\nkennelward and homeward.\n\nYeovil rode through the deepening twilight, relying chiefly on his horse\nto find its way in the network of hedge-bordered lanes that presumably\nled to a high road or to some human habitation.  He was desperately tired\nafter his day's hunting, a legacy of weakness that the fever had\nbequeathed to him, but even though he could scarcely sit upright in his\nsaddle his mind dwelt complacently on the day's sport and looked forward\nto the snug cheery comfort that awaited him at his hunting box.  There\nwas a charm, too, even for a tired man, in the eerie stillness of the\nlone twilight land through which he was passing, a grey shadow-hung land\nwhich seemed to have been emptied of all things that belonged to the\ndaytime, and filled with a lurking, moving life of which one knew nothing\nbeyond the sense that it was there.  There, and very near.  If there had\nbeen wood-gods and wicked-eyed fauns in the sunlit groves and hill sides\nof old Hellas, surely there were watchful, living things of kindred mould\nin this dusk-hidden wilderness of field and hedge and coppice.\n\nIt was Yeovil's third or fourth day with the hounds, without taking into\naccount a couple of mornings' cub-hunting.  Already he felt that he had\nbeen doing nothing different from this all his life.  His foreign\ntravels, his illness, his recent weeks in London, they were part of a\ntapestried background that had very slight and distant connection with\nhis present existence.  Of the future he tried to think with greater\nenergy and determination.  For this winter, at any rate, he would hunt\nand do a little shooting, entertain a few of his neighbours and make\nfriends with any congenial fellow-sportsmen who might be within reach.\nNext year things would be different; he would have had time to look round\nhim, to regain something of his aforetime vigour of mind and body.  Next\nyear, when the hunting season was over, he would set about finding out\nwhether there was any nobler game for him to take a hand in.  He would\nenter into correspondence with old friends who had gone out into the\ntropics and the backwoods--he would do something.\n\nSo he told himself, but he knew thoroughly well that he had found his\nlevel.  He had ceased to struggle against the fascination of his present\nsurroundings.  The slow, quiet comfort and interest of country life\nappealed with enervating force to the man whom death had half conquered.\nThe pleasures of the chase, well-provided for in every detail, and\ndovetailed in with the assured luxury of a well-ordered, well-staffed\nestablishment, were exactly what he wanted and exactly what his life down\nhere afforded him.  He was experiencing, too, that passionate recurring\ndevotion to an old loved scene that comes at times to men who have\ntravelled far and willingly up and down the world.  He was very much at\nhome.  The alien standard floating over Buckingham Palace, the Crown of\nCharlemagne on public buildings and official documents, the grey ships of\nwar riding in Plymouth Bay and Southampton Water with a flag at their\nstern that older generations of Britons had never looked on, these things\nseemed far away and inconsequent amid the hedgerows and woods and fallows\nof the East Wessex country.  Horse and hound-craft, harvest, game broods,\nthe planting and felling of timber, the rearing and selling of stock, the\nletting of grasslands, the care of fisheries, the up-keep of markets and\nfairs, they were the things that immediately mattered.  And Yeovil saw\nhimself, in moments of disgust and self-accusation, settling down into\nthis life of rustic littleness, concerned over the late nesting of a\npartridge or the defective draining of a loose-box, hugely busy over\naffairs that a gardener's boy might grapple with, ignoring the struggle-\ncry that went up, low and bitter and wistful, from a dethroned\ndispossessed race, in whose glories he had gloried, in whose struggle he\nlent no hand.  In what way, he asked himself in such moments, would his\nlife be better than the life of that parody of manhood who upholstered\nhis rooms with art hangings and rosewood furniture and babbled over the\neffect?\n\nThe lanes seemed interminable and without aim or object except to bisect\none another; gates and gaps disclosed nothing in the way of a landmark,\nand the night began to draw down in increasing shades of darkness.\nPresently, however, the tired horse quickened its pace, swung round a\nsharp corner into a broader roadway, and stopped with an air of thankful\nexpectancy at the low doorway of a wayside inn.  A cheerful glow of light\nstreamed from the windows and door, and a brighter glare came from the\nother side of the road, where a large motorcar was being got ready for an\nimmediate start.  Yeovil tumbled stiffly out of his saddle, and in answer\nto the loud rattle of his hunting crop on the open door the innkeeper and\ntwo or three hangers-on hurried out to attend to the wants of man and\nbeast.  Flour and water for the horse and something hot for himself were\nYeovil's first concern, and then he began to clamour for geographical\ninformation.  He was rather dismayed to find that the cumulative opinions\nof those whom he consulted, and of several others who joined unbidden in\nthe discussion, placed his destination at nothing nearer than nine miles.\nNine miles of dark and hilly country road for a tired man on a tired\nhorse assumed enormous, far-stretching proportions, and although he dimly\nremembered that he had asked a guest to dinner for that evening he began\nto wonder whether the wayside inn possessed anything endurable in the way\nof a bedroom.  The landlord interrupted his desperate speculations with a\nreally brilliant effort of suggestion.  There was a gentleman in the bar,\nhe said, who was going in a motorcar in the direction for which Yeovil\nwas bound, and who would no doubt be willing to drop him at his\ndestination; the gentleman had also been out with the hounds.  Yeovil's\nhorse could be stabled at the inn and fetched home by a groom the next\nmorning.  A hurried embassy to the bar parlour resulted in the news that\nthe motorist would be delighted to be of assistance to a\nfellow-sportsman.  Yeovil gratefully accepted the chance that had so\nobligingly come his way, and hastened to superintend the housing of his\nhorse in its night's quarters.  When he had duly seen to the tired\nanimal's comfort and foddering he returned to the roadway, where a young\nman in hunting garb and a livened chauffeur were standing by the side of\nthe waiting car.\n\n\"I am so very pleased to be of some use to you, Mr. Yeovil,\" said the car-\nowner, with a polite bow, and Yeovil recognised the young Leutnant von\nGabelroth, who had been present at the musical afternoon at Berkshire\nStreet.  He had doubtless seen him at the meet that morning, but in his\nhunting kit he had escaped his observation.\n\n\"I, too, have been out with the hounds,\" the young man continued; \"I have\nleft my horse at the Crow and Sceptre at Dolford.  You are living at\nBlack Dene, are you not?  I can take you right past your door, it is all\non my way.\"\n\nYeovil hung back for a moment, overwhelmed with vexation and\nembarrassment, but it was too late to cancel the arrangement he had\nunwittingly entered into, and he was constrained to put himself under\nobligation to the young officer with the best grace he could muster.\nAfter all, he reflected, he had met him under his own roof as his wife's\nguest.  He paid his reckoning to mine host, tipped the stable lad who had\nhelped him with his horse, and took his place beside von Gabelroth in the\ncar.\n\nAs they glided along the dark roadway and the young German reeled off a\nstring of comments on the incidents of the day's sport, Yeovil lay back\namid his comfortable wraps and weighed the measure of his humiliation.  It\nwas Cicely's gospel that one should know what one wanted in life and take\ngood care that one got what one wanted.  Could he apply that test of\nachievement to his own life?  Was this what he really wanted to be doing,\npursuing his uneventful way as a country squire, sharing even his sports\nand pastimes with men of the nation that had conquered and enslaved his\nFatherland?\n\nThe car slackened its pace somewhat as they went through a small hamlet,\npast a schoolhouse, past a rural police-station with the new monogram\nover its notice-board, past a church with a little tree-grown graveyard.\nThere, in a corner, among wild-rose bushes and tall yews, lay some of\nYeovil's own kinsfolk, who had lived in these parts and hunted and found\nlife pleasant in the days that were not so very long ago.  Whenever he\nwent past that quiet little gathering-place of the dead Yeovil was wont\nto raise his hat in mute affectionate salutation to those who were now\nonly memories in his family; to-night he somehow omitted the salute and\nturned his head the other way.  It was as though the dead of his race saw\nand wondered.\n\nThree or four months ago the thing he was doing would have seemed an\nimpossibility, now it was actually happening; he was listening to the\ngay, courteous, tactful chatter of his young companion, laughing now and\nthen at some joking remark, answering some question of interest, learning\nsomething of hunting ways and traditions in von Gabelroth's own country.\nAnd when the car turned in at the gate of the hunting lodge and drew up\nat the steps the laws of hospitality demanded that Yeovil should ask his\nbenefactor of the road to come in for a few minutes and drink something a\nlittle better than the wayside inn had been able to supply.  The young\nofficer spent the best part of a half hour in Yeovil's snuggery,\nexamining and discussing the trophies of rifle and collecting gun that\ncovered the walls.  He had a good knowledge of woodcraft, and the beasts\nand birds of Siberian forests and North African deserts were to him new\npages in a familiar book.  Yeovil found himself discoursing eagerly with\nhis chance guest on the European distribution and local variation of such\nand such a species, recounting peculiarities in its habits and incidents\nof its pursuit and capture.  If the cold observant eyes of Lady Shalem\ncould have rested on the scene she would have hailed it as another root-\nfibre thrown out by the fait accompli.\n\nYeovil closed the hall door on his departing visitor, and closed his mind\non the crowd of angry and accusing thoughts that were waiting to intrude\nthemselves.  His valet had already got his bath in readiness and in a few\nminutes the tired huntsman was forgetting weariness and the consciousness\nof outside things in the languorous abandonment that steam and hot water\ninduce.  Brain and limbs seemed to lay themselves down in a contented\nwaking sleep, the world that was beyond the bathroom walls dropped away\ninto a far unreal distance; only somewhere through the steam clouds\npierced a hazy consciousness that a dinner, well chosen, was being well\ncooked, and would presently be well served--and right well appreciated.\nThat was the lure to drag the bather away from the Nirvana land of warmth\nand steam.  The stimulating after-effect of the bath took its due effect,\nand Yeovil felt that he was now much less tired and enormously hungry.  A\ncheery fire burned in his dressing-room and a lively black kitten helped\nhim to dress, and incidentally helped him to require a new tassel to the\ncord of his dressing-gown.  As he finished his toilet and the kitten\nfinished its sixth and most notable attack on the tassel a ring was heard\nat the front door, and a moment later a loud, hearty, and unmistakably\nhungry voice resounded in the hall.  It belonged to the local doctor, who\nhad also taken part in the day's run and had been bidden to enliven the\nevening meal with the entertainment of his inexhaustible store of\nsporting and social reminiscences.  He knew the countryside and the\ncountryfolk inside out, and he was a living unwritten chronicle of the\nEast Wessex hunt.  His conversation seemed exactly the right\naccompaniment to the meal; his stories brought glimpses of wet hedgerows,\nstiff ploughlands, leafy spinneys and muddy brooks in among the rich old\nWorcester and Georgian silver of the dinner service, the glow and crackle\nof the wood fire, the pleasant succession of well-cooked dishes and\nmellow wines.  The world narrowed itself down again to a warm, drowsy-\nscented dining-room, with a productive hinterland of kitchen and cellar\nbeyond it, and beyond that an important outer world of loose box and\nharness-room and stable-yard; further again a dark hushed region where\npheasants roosted and owls flitted and foxes prowled.\n\nYeovil sat and listened to story after story of the men and women and\nhorses of the neighbourhood; even the foxes seemed to have a personality,\nsome of them, and a personal history.  It was a little like Hans\nAndersen, he decided, and a little like the Reminiscences of an Irish\nR.M., and perhaps just a little like some of the more probable adventures\nof Baron Munchausen.  The newer stories were evidently true to the\nsmallest detail, the earlier ones had altered somewhat in repetition, as\nplants and animals vary under domestication.\n\nAnd all the time there was one topic that was never touched on.  Of half\nthe families mentioned it was necessary to add the qualifying information\nthat they \"used to live\" at such and such a place; the countryside knew\nthem no longer.  Their properties were for sale or had already passed\ninto the hands of strangers.  But neither man cared to allude to the\ngrinning shadow that sat at the feast and sent an icy chill now and again\nthrough the cheeriest jest and most jovial story.  The brisk run with the\nhounds that day had stirred and warmed their pulses; it was an evening\nfor comfortable forgetting.  Later that night, in the stillness of his\nbedroom, with the dwindling noises of a retiring household dropping off\none by one into ordered silence, a door shutting here, a fire being raked\nout there, the thoughts that had been held away came crowding in.  The\nbody was tired, but the brain was not, and Yeovil lay awake with his\nthoughts for company.  The world grew suddenly wide again, filled with\nthe significance of things that mattered, held by the actions of men that\nmattered.  Hunting-box and stable and gun-room dwindled to a mere pin-\npoint in the universe, there were other larger, more absorbing things on\nwhich the mind dwelt.  There was the grey cold sea outside Dover and\nPortsmouth and Cork, where the great grey ships of war rocked and swung\nwith the tides, where the sailors sang, in doggerel English, that bitter-\nsounding adaptation, \"Germania rules t'e waves,\" where the flag of a\nWorld-Power floated for the world to see.  And in oven-like cities of\nIndia there were men who looked out at the white sun-glare, the\nheat-baked dust, the welter of crowded streets, who listened to the\nunceasing chorus of harsh-throated crows, the strident creaking of cart-\nwheels, the buzz and drone of insect swarms and the rattle call of the\ntree lizards; men whose thoughts went hungrily to the cool grey skies and\nwet turf and moist ploughlands of an English hunting country, men whose\nmemories listened yearningly to the music of a deep-throated hound and\nthe call of a game-bird in the stubble.  Yeovil had secured for himself\nthe enjoyment of the things for which these men hungered; he had known\nwhat he wanted in life, slowly and with hesitation, yet nevertheless\nsurely, he had arrived at the achievement of his unconfessed desires.\nHere, installed under his own roof-tree, with as good horseflesh in his\nstable as man could desire, with sport lying almost at his door, with his\nwife ready to come down and help him to entertain his neighbours, Murrey\nYeovil had found the life that he wanted--and was accursed in his own\neyes.  He argued with himself, and palliated and explained, but he knew\nwhy he had turned his eyes away that evening from the little graveyard\nunder the trees; one cannot explain things to the dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX: THE LITTLE FOXES\n\n\n   \"Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines\"\n\nOn a warm and sunny May afternoon, some ten months since Yeovil's return\nfrom his Siberian wanderings and sickness, Cicely sat at a small table in\nthe open-air restaurant in Hyde Park, finishing her after-luncheon coffee\nand listening to the meritorious performance of the orchestra.  Opposite\nher sat Larry Meadowfield, absorbed for the moment in the slow enjoyment\nof a cigarette, which also was not without its short-lived merits.  Larry\nwas a well-dressed youngster, who was, in Cicely's opinion, distinctly\ngood to look on--an opinion which the boy himself obviously shared.  He\nhad the healthy, well-cared-for appearance of a country-dweller who has\nbeen turned into a town dandy without suffering in the process.  His blue-\nblack hair, growing very low down on a broad forehead, was brushed back\nin a smoothness that gave his head the appearance of a rain-polished\nsloe; his eyebrows were two dark smudges and his large violet-grey eyes\nexpressed the restful good temper of an animal whose immediate\nrequirements have been satisfied.  The lunch had been an excellent one,\nand it was jolly to feed out of doors in the warm spring air--the only\ndrawback to the arrangement being the absence of mirrors.  However, if he\ncould not look at himself a great many people could look at him.\n\nCicely listened to the orchestra as it jerked and strutted through a\nfantastic dance measure, and as she listened she looked appreciatively at\nthe boy on the other side of the table, whose soul for the moment seemed\nto be in his cigarette.  Her scheme of life, knowing just what you wanted\nand taking good care that you got it, was justifying itself by results.\nRonnie, grown tiresome with success, had not been difficult to replace,\nand no one in her world had had the satisfaction of being able to condole\nwith her on the undesirable experience of a long interregnum.  To\nfeminine acquaintances with fewer advantages of purse and brains and\nlooks she might figure as \"that Yeovil woman,\" but never had she given\nthem justification to allude to her as \"poor Cicely Yeovil.\"  And Murrey,\ndear old soul, had cooled down, as she had hoped and wished, from his\nwhite heat of disgust at the things that she had prepared herself to\naccept philosophically.  A new chapter of their married life and man-and-\nwoman friendship had opened; many a rare gallop they had had together\nthat winter, many a cheery dinner gathering and long bridge evening in\nthe cosy hunting-lodge.  Though he still hated the new London and held\nhimself aloof from most of her Town set, yet he had not shown himself\nrigidly intolerant of the sprinkling of Teuton sportsmen who hunted and\nshot down in his part of the country.\n\nThe orchestra finished its clicking and caracoling and was accorded a\nshort clatter of applause.\n\n\"The Danse Macabre,\" said Cicely to her companion; \"one of Saint-Saens'\nbest known pieces.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" said Larry indifferently; \"I'll take your word for it.  'Fraid I\ndon't know much about music.\"\n\n\"You dear boy, that's just what I like in you,\" said Cicely; \"you're such\na delicious young barbarian.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" said Larry.  \"I dare say.  I suppose you know.\"\n\nLarry's father had been a brilliantly clever man who had married a\nbrilliantly handsome woman; the Fates had not had the least intention\nthat Larry should take after both parents.\n\n\"The fashion of having one's lunch in the open air has quite caught on\nthis season,\" said Cicely; \"one sees everybody here on a fine day.  There\nis Lady Bailquist over there.  She used to be Lady Shalem you know,\nbefore her husband got the earldom--to be more correct, before she got it\nfor him.  I suppose she is all agog to see the great review.\"\n\nIt was in fact precisely the absorbing topic of the forthcoming Boy-Scout\nmarch-past that was engaging the Countess of Bailquist's earnest\nattention at the moment.\n\n\"It is going to be an historical occasion,\" she was saying to Sir Leonard\nPitherby (whose services to literature had up to the present received\nonly a half-measure of recognition); \"if it miscarries it will be a\nserious set-back for the fait accompli.  If it is a success it will be\nthe biggest step forward in the path of reconciliation between the two\nraces that has yet been taken.  It will mean that the younger generation\nis on our side--not all, of course, but some, that is all we can expect\nat present, and that will be enough to work on.\"\n\n\"Supposing the Scouts hang back and don't turn up in any numbers,\" said\nSir Leonard anxiously.\n\n\"That of course is the danger,\" said Lady Bailquist quietly; \"probably\ntwo-thirds of the available strength will hold back, but a third or even\na sixth would be enough; it would redeem the parade from the calamity of\nfiasco, and it would be a nucleus to work on for the future.  That is\nwhat we want, a good start, a preliminary rally.  It is the first step\nthat counts, that is why to-day's event is of such importance.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course, the first step on the road,\" assented Sir Leonard.\n\n\"I can assure you,\" continued Lady Bailquist, \"that nothing has been left\nundone to rally the Scouts to the new order of things.  Special\nprivileges have been showered on them, alone among all the cadet corps\nthey have been allowed to retain their organisation, a decoration of\nmerit has been instituted for them, a large hostelry and gymnasium has\nbeen provided for them in Westminster, His Majesty's youngest son is to\nbe their Scoutmaster-in-Chief, a great athletic meeting is to be held for\nthem each year, with valuable prizes, three or four hundred of them are\nto be taken every summer, free of charge, for a holiday in the Bavarian\nHighlands and the Baltic Seaboard; besides this the parent of every scout\nwho obtains the medal for efficiency is to be exempted from part of the\nnew war taxation that the people are finding so burdensome.\"\n\n\"One certainly cannot say that they have not had attractions held out to\nthem,\" said Sir Leonard.\n\n\"It is a special effort,\" said Lady Bailquist; \"it is worth making an\neffort for.  They are going to be the Janissaries of the Empire; the\nyounger generation knocking at the doors of progress, and thrusting back\nthe bars and bolts of old racial prejudices.  I tell you, Sir Leonard, it\nwill be an historic moment when the first corps of those little khaki-\nclad boys swings through the gates of the Park.\"\n\n\"When do they come?\" asked the baronet, catching something of his\ncompanion's zeal.\n\n\"The first detachment is due to arrive at three,\" said Lady Bailquist,\nreferring to a small time-table of the afternoon's proceedings; \"three,\npunctually, and the others will follow in rapid succession.  The Emperor\nand Suite will arrive at two-fifty and take up their positions at the\nsaluting base--over there, where the big flag-staff has been set up.  The\nboys will come in by Hyde Park Corner, the Marble Arch, and the Albert\nGate, according to their districts, and form in one big column over\nthere, where the little flags are pegged out.  Then the young Prince will\ninspect them and lead them past His Majesty.\"\n\n\"Who will be with the Imperial party?\" asked Sir Leonard.\n\n\"Oh, it is to be an important affair; everything will be done to\nemphasise the significance of the occasion,\" said Lady Bailquist, again\nconsulting her programme.  \"The King of Wurtemberg, and two of the\nBavarian royal Princes, an Abyssinian Envoy who is over here--he will\nlend a touch of picturesque barbarism to the scene--the general\ncommanding the London district and a whole lot of other military bigwigs,\nand the Austrian, Italian and Roumanian military attaches.\"\n\nShe reeled off the imposing list of notables with an air of quiet\nsatisfaction.  Sir Leonard made mental notes of personages to whom he\nmight send presentation copies of his new work \"Frederick-William, the\nGreat Elector, a Popular Biography,\" as a souvenir of to-day's auspicious\nevent.\n\n\"It is nearly a quarter to three now,\" he said; \"let us get a good\nposition before the crowd gets thicker.\"\n\n\"Come along to my car, it is just opposite to the saluting base,\" said\nher ladyship; \"I have a police pass that will let us through.  We'll ask\nMrs. Yeovil and her young friend to join us.\"\n\nLarry excused himself from joining the party; he had a barbarian's\nreluctance to assisting at an Imperial triumph.\n\n\"I think I'll push off to the swimming-bath,\" he said to Cicely; \"see you\nagain about tea-time.\"\n\nCicely walked with Lady Bailquist and the literary baronet towards the\ncrowd of spectators, which was steadily growing in dimensions.  A newsboy\nran in front of them displaying a poster with the intelligence \"Essex\nwickets fall rapidly\"--a semblance of county cricket still survived under\nthe new order of things.  Near the saluting base some thirty or forty\nmotorcars were drawn up in line, and Cicely and her companions exchanged\ngreetings with many of the occupants.\n\n\"A lovely day for the review, isn't it?\" cried the Grafin von Tolb,\nbreaking off her conversation with Herr Rebinok, the little Pomeranian\nbanker, who was sitting by her side.  \"Why haven't you brought young Mr.\nMeadowfield?  Such a nice boy.  I wanted him to come and sit in my\ncarriage and talk to me.\"\n\n\"He doesn't talk you know,\" said Cicely; \"he's only brilliant to look\nat.\"\n\n\"Well, I could have looked at him,\" said the Grafin.\n\n\"There'll be thousands of other boys to look at presently,\" said Cicely,\nlaughing at the old woman's frankness.\n\n\"Do you think there will be thousands?\" asked the Grafin, with an anxious\nlowering of the voice; \"really, thousands?  Hundreds, perhaps; there is\nsome uncertainty.  Every one is not sanguine.\"\n\n\"Hundreds, anyway,\" said Cicely.\n\nThe Grafin turned to the little banker and spoke to him rapidly and\nearnestly in German.\n\n\"It is most important that we should consolidate our position in this\ncountry; we must coax the younger generation over by degrees, we must\ndisarm their hostility.  We cannot afford to be always on the watch in\nthis quarter; it is a source of weakness, and we cannot afford to be\nweak.  This Slav upheaval in south-eastern Europe is becoming a serious\nmenace.  Have you seen to-day's telegrams from Agram?  They are bad\nreading.  There is no computing the extent of this movement.\"\n\n\"It is directed against us,\" said the banker.\n\n\"Agreed,\" said the Grafin; \"it is in the nature of things that it must be\nagainst us.  Let us have no illusions.  Within the next ten years, sooner\nperhaps, we shall be faced with a crisis which will be only a beginning.\nWe shall need all our strength; that is why we cannot afford to be weak\nover here.  To-day is an important day; I confess I am anxious.\"\n\n\"Hark!  The kettledrums!\" exclaimed the commanding voice of Lady\nBailquist.  \"His Majesty is coming.  Quick, bundle into the car.\"\n\nThe crowd behind the police-kept lines surged expectantly into closer\nformation; spectators hurried up from side-walks and stood craning their\nnecks above the shoulders of earlier arrivals.\n\nThrough the archway at Hyde Park Corner came a resplendent cavalcade,\nwith a swirl of colour and rhythmic movement and a crash of exultant\nmusic; life-guards with gleaming helmets, a detachment of Wurtemberg\nlancers with a flutter of black and yellow pennons, a rich medley of\nstaff uniforms, a prancing array of princely horsemen, the Imperial\nStandard, and the King of Prussia, Great Britain, and Ireland, Emperor of\nthe West.  It was the most imposing display that Londoners had seen since\nthe catastrophe.\n\nSlowly, grandly, with thunder of music and beat of hoofs, the procession\npassed through the crowd, across the sward towards the saluting base,\nslowly the eagle standard, charged with the leopards, lion and harp of\nthe conquered kingdoms, rose mast-high on the flag-staff and fluttered in\nthe breeze, slowly and with military precision the troops and suite took\nup their position round the central figure of the great pageant.  Trumpets\nand kettledrums suddenly ceased their music, and in a moment there rose\nin their stead an eager buzz of comment from the nearest spectators.\n\n\"How well the young Prince looks in his scout uniform.\" . . . \"The King\nof Wurtemberg is a much younger man than I thought he was.\" . . . \"Is\nthat a Prussian or Bavarian uniform, there on the right, the man on a\nblack horse?\" . . .  \"Neither, it's Austrian, the Austrian military\nattache\" . . .  \"That is von Stoppel talking to His Majesty; he organised\nthe Boy Scouts in Germany, you know.\" . . .  \"His Majesty is looking very\npleased.\"  \"He has reason to look pleased; this is a great event in the\nhistory of the two countries.  It marks a new epoch.\" . . .  \"Oh, do you\nsee the Abyssinian Envoy?  What a picturesque figure he makes.  How well\nhe sits his horse.\" . . . \"That is the Grand Duke of Baden's nephew,\ntalking to the King of Wurtemberg now.\"\n\nOn the buzz and chatter of the spectators fell suddenly three sound\nstrokes, distant, measured, sinister; the clang of a clock striking\nthree.\n\n\"Three o'clock and not a boy scout within sight or hearing!\" exclaimed\nthe loud ringing voice of Joan Mardle; \"one can usually hear their drums\nand trumpets a couple of miles away.\"\n\n\"There is the traffic to get through,\" said Sir Leonard Pitherby in an\nequally high-pitched voice; \"and of course,\" he added vaguely, \"it takes\nsome time to get the various units together.  One must give them a few\nminutes' grace.\"\n\nLady Bailquist said nothing, but her restless watchful eyes were turned\nfirst to Hyde Park Corner and then in the direction of the Marble Arch,\nback again to Hyde Park Corner.  Only the dark lines of the waiting crowd\nmet her view, with the yellow newspaper placards flitting in and out,\nannouncing to an indifferent public the fate of Essex wickets.  As far as\nher searching eyes could travel the green stretch of tree and sward\nremained unbroken, save by casual loiterers.  No small brown columns\nappeared, no drum beat came throbbing up from the distance.  The little\nflags pegged out to mark the positions of the awaited scout-corps\nfluttered in meaningless isolation on the empty parade ground.\n\nHis Majesty was talking unconcernedly with one of his officers, the\nforeign attaches looked steadily between their chargers' ears, as though\nnothing in particular was hanging in the balance, the Abyssinian Envoy\ndisplayed an untroubled serenity which was probably genuine.  Elsewhere\namong the Suite was a perceptible fidget, the more obvious because it was\nelaborately cloaked.  Among the privileged onlookers drawn up near the\nsaluting point the fidgeting was more unrestrained.\n\n\"Six minutes past three, and not a sign of them!\" exclaimed Joan Mardle,\nwith the explosive articulation of one who cannot any longer hold back a\ntruth.\n\n\"Hark!\" said some one; \"I hear trumpets!\"\n\nThere was an instant concentration of listening, a straining of eyes.\n\nIt was only the toot of a passing motorcar.  Even Sir Leonard Pitherby,\nwith the eye of faith, could not locate as much as a cloud of dust on the\nPark horizon.\n\nAnd now another sound was heard, a sound difficult to define, without\nbeginning, without dimension; the growing murmur of a crowd waking to a\nslowly dawning sensation.\n\n\"I wish the band would strike up an air,\" said the Grafin von Tolb\nfretfully; \"it is stupid waiting here in silence.\"\n\nJoan fingered her watch, but she made no further remark; she realised\nthat no amount of malicious comment could be so dramatically effective\nnow as the slow slipping away of the intolerable seconds.\n\nThe murmur from the crowd grew in volume.  Some satirical wit started\nwhistling an imitation of an advancing fife and drum band; others took it\nup and the air resounded with the shrill music of a phantom army on the\nmarch.  The mock throbbing of drum and squealing of fife rose and fell\nabove the packed masses of spectators, but no answering echo came from\nbeyond the distant trees.  Like mushrooms in the night a muster of\nuniformed police and plain clothes detectives sprang into evidence on all\nsides; whatever happened there must be no disloyal demonstration.  The\nwhistlers and mockers were pointedly invited to keep silence, and one or\ntwo addresses were taken.  Under the trees, well at the back of the\ncrowd, a young man stood watching the long stretch of road along which\nthe Scouts should come.  Something had drawn him there, against his will,\nto witness the Imperial Triumph, to watch the writing of yet another\nchapter in the history of his country's submission to an accepted fact.\nAnd now a dull flush crept into his grey face; a look that was partly new-\nborn hope and resurrected pride, partly remorse and shame, burned in his\neyes.  Shame, the choking, searing shame of self-reproach that cannot be\nreasoned away, was dominant in his heart.  He had laid down his\narms--there were others who had never hoisted the flag of surrender.  He\nhad given up the fight and joined the ranks of the hopelessly\nsubservient; in thousands of English homes throughout the land there were\nyoung hearts that had not forgotten, had not compounded, would not yield.\n\nThe younger generation had barred the door.\n\nAnd in the pleasant May sunshine the Eagle standard floated and flapped,\nthe black and yellow pennons shifted restlessly, Emperor and Princes,\nGenerals and guards, sat stiffly in their saddles, and waited.\n\nAnd waited. . . .\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WHEN WILLIAM CAME***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 14540.txt or 14540.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/4\/5\/4\/14540\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":259,"split":"train"}
