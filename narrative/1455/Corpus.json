{"ori_id":"ff66a9853a184196f556d5cf226e18fddef6be1c","title":"The Gambler (novel)","context":"The Gambler (novel)\n The first-person narrative is told from the point of view of Alexei Ivanovich, a tutor working for a Russian family living in a suite at a German hotel. The patriarch of the family, The General, is indebted to the Frenchman de Criet and has mortgaged his property in Russia to pay only a small amount of his debt. Upon learning of the illness of his wealthy aunt, \"Grandmother\", he sends streams of telegrams to Moscow and awaits the news of her demise. His expected inheritance will pay his debts and gain Mademoiselle Blanche de Cominges's hand in marriage.\nAlexei is hopelessly in love with Polina, the General's stepdaughter, and swears an oath of servitude to her. He told her while on a walk on the Schlangenberg (a mountain in the German town) that all she had to do was give the word and he would gladly walk off the edge and plummet to his death. This leads to her asking him to go to the town's casino and place a bet for her. He refuses at first but, when goaded and reminded of his oath of undying love and servility, he succumbs and ends up winning at the roulette table. He returns to her the winnings but she will not tell him the reason she needs money. She only laughs in his face (as she does when he professes his love) and treats him with cold indifference, if not downright malice. He only learns the details of the General's and Polina's financial state later in the story through his long-time acquaintance, Mr. Astley. Astley is a shy Englishman who seems to share Alexei's fondness of Polina. He comes from English nobility and has a good deal of money.\nOne day while Polina and Alexei are on a walk they see Baron and Baroness Wurmerhelm. Polina dares him to insult the aristocratic couple and he does so with little hesitation. This sets off a chain of events that details Mademoiselle Blanche's interest in the General and gets Alexei fired as tutor of the General's children. Shortly after this, Grandmother shows up and surprises the whole party of debtors and indebted. She tells them all that she knows all about the General's debt and why the Frenchman and woman are waiting around the suite day after day. She leaves the party of death-profiteers by saying that none of them are getting any of her money. She then asks Alexei to be her guide around the town famous for its healing waters and infamous for its casino where the tables are stacked with piles of gold; she wants to gamble.\nAfter being ushered to the roulette table, she plays and wins 13,000 Friedrich's d'ors (7000-8000 roubles), a significant amount of money. After a short return to the hotel, she comes back to roulette tables and she starts to get the bug; before she leaves the town, she's lost over a hundred thousand roubles in three days.\nWhen Alexei gets back to his room after sending Grandmother off at the railway station, he's greeted by Polina. She shows him a letter where de Criet says he has started legal proceedings to sell Generals' properties mortgaged to him, but he is returning properties worth fifty thousand roubles to General for Polina's benefit. de Criet says he feels he had fulfilled all his obligations that way. Polina tells Alexei she is de Criet's mistress and she wishes she had fifty thousand to fling at de Criet's face. Upon hearing this, Alexei runs out of the room and to the casino where he in a feverish rush of excitement wins in few hours two hundred thousand florins (100 000 francs) and becomes a rich man. When he gets back to his room and the waiting Polina, he empties his pockets full of gold (Alexei estimates the weight to some 4 kilos) and bank notes onto the bed. At first she accuses him of trying to buy her like de Criet, but then she embraces him. They fall asleep on the couch. Next day, she asks for fifty thousand roubles (25 000 francs) and when he gives it to her, she flings that money at Alexei's face and runs off to Mr. Astley (they had been secretly meeting and exchanging notes and she was supposed to meet him night before but has come by mistake to Alexei's room). He doesn't see her again.\nAfter learning that the General wouldn't be getting his inheritance and that Prince Nilski is penniless, Mademoiselle Blanche leaves the hotel with her mother\/chaperone for Paris and seduces Alexei to follow her. Alexei goes with them, and they stay together for almost a month, he allowing Mlle Blanche to spend his entire fortune on Mlle Blanche's personal expenses, carriages and horses, dinner dances and a wedding-party. After getting herself financially secured, in order to get an accepted status in the societies, Mlle Blanche unexpectedly marries the General, who has followed her to Paris.\nAlexei starts to gamble to survive. One day he passes Mr. Astley on a park bench in Bad Homburg and has a talk with him. He finds out from Astley that Polina is in Switzerland and actually does love him. Astley tells that Grandmother has died and left Polina and the children financially secured. The General has died in Paris. Astley gives him some money but shows little hope that he will not use it for gambling. Alexei goes home dreaming of going to Switzerland the next day and recollects what made him win at the roulette tables in the past.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gambler, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Hogarth\n\n\n\nI\n\nAt length I returned from two weeks leave of absence to find that my\npatrons had arrived three days ago in Roulettenberg. I received from\nthem a welcome quite different to that which I had expected. The\nGeneral eyed me coldly, greeted me in rather haughty fashion, and\ndismissed me to pay my respects to his sister. It was clear that from\nSOMEWHERE money had been acquired. I thought I could even detect a\ncertain shamefacedness in the General's glance. Maria Philipovna, too,\nseemed distraught, and conversed with me with an air of detachment.\nNevertheless, she took the money which I handed to her, counted it, and\nlistened to what I had to tell. To luncheon there were expected that\nday a Monsieur Mezentsov, a French lady, and an Englishman; for,\nwhenever money was in hand, a banquet in Muscovite style was always\ngiven. Polina Alexandrovna, on seeing me, inquired why I had been so\nlong away. Then, without waiting for an answer, she departed. Evidently\nthis was not mere accident, and I felt that I must throw some light\nupon matters. It was high time that I did so.\n\nI was assigned a small room on the fourth floor of the hotel (for you\nmust know that I belonged to the General's suite). So far as I could\nsee, the party had already gained some notoriety in the place, which\nhad come to look upon the General as a Russian nobleman of great\nwealth. Indeed, even before luncheon he charged me, among other things,\nto get two thousand-franc notes changed for him at the hotel counter,\nwhich put us in a position to be thought millionaires at all events for\na week! Later, I was about to take Mischa and Nadia for a walk when a\nsummons reached me from the staircase that I must attend the General.\nHe began by deigning to inquire of me where I was going to take the\nchildren; and as he did so, I could see that he failed to look me in\nthe eyes. He WANTED to do so, but each time was met by me with such a\nfixed, disrespectful stare that he desisted in confusion. In pompous\nlanguage, however, which jumbled one sentence into another, and at\nlength grew disconnected, he gave me to understand that I was to lead\nthe children altogether away from the Casino, and out into the park.\nFinally his anger exploded, and he added sharply:\n\n\"I suppose you would like to take them to the Casino to play roulette?\nWell, excuse my speaking so plainly, but I know how addicted you are to\ngambling. Though I am not your mentor, nor wish to be, at least I have\na right to require that you shall not actually compromise me.\"\n\n\"I have no money for gambling,\" I quietly replied.\n\n\"But you will soon be in receipt of some,\" retorted the General,\nreddening a little as he dived into his writing desk and applied\nhimself to a memorandum book. From it he saw that he had 120 roubles of\nmine in his keeping.\n\n\"Let us calculate,\" he went on. \"We must translate these roubles into\nthalers. Here--take 100 thalers, as a round sum. The rest will be safe\nin my hands.\"\n\nIn silence I took the money.\n\n\"You must not be offended at what I say,\" he continued. \"You are too\ntouchy about these things. What I have said I have said merely as a\nwarning. To do so is no more than my right.\"\n\nWhen returning home with the children before luncheon, I met a\ncavalcade of our party riding to view some ruins. Two splendid\ncarriages, magnificently horsed, with Mlle. Blanche, Maria Philipovna,\nand Polina Alexandrovna in one of them, and the Frenchman, the\nEnglishman, and the General in attendance on horseback! The passers-by\nstopped to stare at them, for the effect was splendid--the General\ncould not have improved upon it. I calculated that, with the 4000\nfrancs which I had brought with me, added to what my patrons seemed\nalready to have acquired, the party must be in possession of at least\n7000 or 8000 francs--though that would be none too much for Mlle.\nBlanche, who, with her mother and the Frenchman, was also lodging in\nour hotel. The latter gentleman was called by the lacqueys \"Monsieur le\nComte,\" and Mlle. Blanche's mother was dubbed \"Madame la Comtesse.\"\nPerhaps in very truth they WERE \"Comte et Comtesse.\"\n\nI knew that \"Monsieur le Comte\" would take no notice of me when we met\nat dinner, as also that the General would not dream of introducing us,\nnor of recommending me to the \"Comte.\" However, the latter had lived\nawhile in Russia, and knew that the person referred to as an \"uchitel\"\nis never looked upon as a bird of fine feather. Of course, strictly\nspeaking, he knew me; but I was an uninvited guest at the luncheon--the\nGeneral had forgotten to arrange otherwise, or I should have been\ndispatched to dine at the table d'hote. Nevertheless, I presented\nmyself in such guise that the General looked at me with a touch of\napproval; and, though the good Maria Philipovna was for showing me my\nplace, the fact of my having previously met the Englishman, Mr. Astley,\nsaved me, and thenceforward I figured as one of the company.\n\nThis strange Englishman I had met first in Prussia, where we had\nhappened to sit vis-a-vis in a railway train in which I was travelling\nto overtake our party; while, later, I had run across him in France,\nand again in Switzerland--twice within the space of two weeks! To\nthink, therefore, that I should suddenly encounter him again here, in\nRoulettenberg! Never in my life had I known a more retiring man, for he\nwas shy to the pitch of imbecility, yet well aware of the fact (for he\nwas no fool). At the same time, he was a gentle, amiable sort of an\nindividual, and, even on our first encounter in Prussia I had contrived\nto draw him out, and he had told me that he had just been to the North\nCape, and was now anxious to visit the fair at Nizhni Novgorod. How he\nhad come to make the General's acquaintance I do not know, but,\napparently, he was much struck with Polina. Also, he was delighted that\nI should sit next him at table, for he appeared to look upon me as his\nbosom friend.\n\nDuring the meal the Frenchman was in great feather: he was discursive\nand pompous to every one. In Moscow too, I remembered, he had blown a\ngreat many bubbles. Interminably he discoursed on finance and Russian\npolitics, and though, at times, the General made feints to contradict\nhim, he did so humbly, and as though wishing not wholly to lose sight\nof his own dignity.\n\nFor myself, I was in a curious frame of mind. Even before luncheon was\nhalf finished I had asked myself the old, eternal question: \"WHY do I\ncontinue to dance attendance upon the General, instead of having left\nhim and his family long ago?\" Every now and then I would glance at\nPolina Alexandrovna, but she paid me no attention; until eventually I\nbecame so irritated that I decided to play the boor.\n\nFirst of all I suddenly, and for no reason whatever, plunged loudly and\ngratuitously into the general conversation. Above everything I wanted\nto pick a quarrel with the Frenchman; and, with that end in view I\nturned to the General, and exclaimed in an overbearing sort of\nway--indeed, I think that I actually interrupted him--that that summer\nit had been almost impossible for a Russian to dine anywhere at tables\nd'hote. The General bent upon me a glance of astonishment.\n\n\"If one is a man of self-respect,\" I went on, \"one risks abuse by so\ndoing, and is forced to put up with insults of every kind. Both at\nParis and on the Rhine, and even in Switzerland--there are so many\nPoles, with their sympathisers, the French, at these tables d'hote that\none cannot get a word in edgeways if one happens only to be a Russian.\"\n\nThis I said in French. The General eyed me doubtfully, for he did not\nknow whether to be angry or merely to feel surprised that I should so\nfar forget myself.\n\n\"Of course, one always learns SOMETHING EVERYWHERE,\" said the Frenchman\nin a careless, contemptuous sort of tone.\n\n\"In Paris, too, I had a dispute with a Pole,\" I continued, \"and then\nwith a French officer who supported him. After that a section of the\nFrenchmen present took my part. They did so as soon as I told them the\nstory of how once I threatened to spit into Monsignor's coffee.\"\n\n\"To spit into it?\" the General inquired with grave disapproval in his\ntone, and a stare, of astonishment, while the Frenchman looked at me\nunbelievingly.\n\n\"Just so,\" I replied. \"You must know that, on one occasion, when, for\ntwo days, I had felt certain that at any moment I might have to depart\nfor Rome on business, I repaired to the Embassy of the Holy See in\nParis, to have my passport visaed. There I encountered a sacristan of\nabout fifty, and a man dry and cold of mien. After listening politely,\nbut with great reserve, to my account of myself, this sacristan asked\nme to wait a little. I was in a great hurry to depart, but of course I\nsat down, pulled out a copy of L'Opinion Nationale, and fell to reading\nan extraordinary piece of invective against Russia which it happened to\ncontain. As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an adjoining room\nand ask for Monsignor; after which I saw the sacristan make a low bow\nto the visitor, and then another bow as the visitor took his leave. I\nventured to remind the good man of my own business also; whereupon,\nwith an expression of, if anything, increased dryness, he again asked\nme to wait. Soon a third visitor arrived who, like myself, had come on\nbusiness (he was an Austrian of some sort); and as soon as ever he had\nstated his errand he was conducted upstairs! This made me very angry. I\nrose, approached the sacristan, and told him that, since Monsignor was\nreceiving callers, his lordship might just as well finish off my affair\nas well. Upon this the sacristan shrunk back in astonishment. It simply\npassed his understanding that any insignificant Russian should dare to\ncompare himself with other visitors of Monsignor's! In a tone of the\nutmost effrontery, as though he were delighted to have a chance of\ninsulting me, he looked me up and down, and then said: \"Do you suppose\nthat Monsignor is going to put aside his coffee for YOU?\" But I only\ncried the louder: \"Let me tell you that I am going to SPIT into that\ncoffee! Yes, and if you do not get me my passport visaed this very\nminute, I shall take it to Monsignor myself.\"\n\n\"What? While he is engaged with a Cardinal?\" screeched the sacristan,\nagain shrinking back in horror. Then, rushing to the door, he spread\nout his arms as though he would rather die than let me enter.\n\nThereupon I declared that I was a heretic and a barbarian--\"Je suis\nheretique et barbare,\" I said, \"and that these archbishops and\ncardinals and monsignors, and the rest of them, meant nothing at all to\nme. In a word, I showed him that I was not going to give way. He looked\nat me with an air of infinite resentment. Then he snatched up my\npassport, and departed with it upstairs. A minute later the passport\nhad been visaed! Here it is now, if you care to see it,\"--and I pulled\nout the document, and exhibited the Roman visa.\n\n\"But--\" the General began.\n\n\"What really saved you was the fact that you proclaimed yourself a\nheretic and a barbarian,\" remarked the Frenchman with a smile. \"Cela\nn'etait pas si bete.\"\n\n\"But is that how Russian subjects ought to be treated? Why, when they\nsettle here they dare not utter even a word--they are ready even to\ndeny the fact that they are Russians! At all events, at my hotel in\nParis I received far more attention from the company after I had told\nthem about the fracas with the sacristan. A fat Polish nobleman, who\nhad been the most offensive of all who were present at the table\nd'hote, at once went upstairs, while some of the Frenchmen were simply\ndisgusted when I told them that two years ago I had encountered a man\nat whom, in 1812, a French 'hero' fired for the mere fun of discharging\nhis musket. That man was then a boy of ten and his family are still\nresiding in Moscow.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" the Frenchman spluttered. \"No French soldier would fire\nat a child!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless the incident was as I say,\" I replied. \"A very respected\nex-captain told me the story, and I myself could see the scar left on\nhis cheek.\"\n\nThe Frenchman then began chattering volubly, and the General supported\nhim; but I recommended the former to read, for example, extracts from\nthe memoirs of General Perovski, who, in 1812, was a prisoner in the\nhands of the French. Finally Maria Philipovna said something to\ninterrupt the conversation. The General was furious with me for having\nstarted the altercation with the Frenchman. On the other hand, Mr.\nAstley seemed to take great pleasure in my brush with Monsieur, and,\nrising from the table, proposed that we should go and have a drink\ntogether. The same afternoon, at four o'clock, I went to have my\ncustomary talk with Polina Alexandrovna; and, the talk soon extended to\na stroll. We entered the Park, and approached the Casino, where Polina\nseated herself upon a bench near the fountain, and sent Nadia away to a\nlittle distance to play with some other children. Mischa also I\ndispatched to play by the fountain, and in this fashion we--that is to\nsay, Polina and myself--contrived to find ourselves alone.\n\nOf course, we began by talking on business matters. Polina seemed\nfurious when I handed her only 700 gulden, for she had thought to\nreceive from Paris, as the proceeds of the pledging of her diamonds, at\nleast 2000 gulden, or even more.\n\n\"Come what may, I MUST have money,\" she said. \"And get it somehow I\nwill--otherwise I shall be ruined.\"\n\nI asked her what had happened during my absence.\n\n\"Nothing; except that two pieces of news have reached us from St.\nPetersburg. In the first place, my grandmother is very ill, and\nunlikely to last another couple of days. We had this from Timothy\nPetrovitch himself, and he is a reliable person. Every moment we are\nexpecting to receive news of the end.\"\n\n\"All of you are on the tiptoe of expectation?\" I queried.\n\n\"Of course--all of us, and every minute of the day. For a\nyear-and-a-half now we have been looking for this.\"\n\n\"Looking for it?\"\n\n\"Yes, looking for it. I am not her blood relation, you know--I am\nmerely the General's step-daughter.  Yet I am certain that the old lady\nhas remembered me in her will.\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe that you WILL come in for a good deal,\" I said with\nsome assurance.\n\n\"Yes, for she is fond of me. But how come you to think so?\"\n\nI answered this question with another one. \"That Marquis of yours,\" I\nsaid, \"--is HE also familiar with your family secrets?\"\n\n\"And why are you yourself so interested in them?\" was her retort as she\neyed me with dry grimness.\n\n\"Never mind. If I am not mistaken, the General has succeeded in\nborrowing money of the Marquis.\"\n\n\"It may be so.\"\n\n\"Is it likely that the Marquis would have lent the money if he had not\nknown something or other about your grandmother? Did you notice, too,\nthat three times during luncheon, when speaking of her, he called her\n'La Baboulenka'? [Dear little Grandmother]. What loving, friendly\nbehaviour, to be sure!\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true. As soon as ever he learnt that I was likely to\ninherit something from her he began to pay me his addresses. I thought\nyou ought to know that.\"\n\n\"Then he has only just begun his courting? Why, I thought he had been\ndoing so a long while!\"\n\n\"You KNOW he has not,\" retorted Polina angrily. \"But where on earth did\nyou pick up this Englishman?\" She said this after a pause.\n\n\"I KNEW you would ask about him!\" Whereupon I told her of my previous\nencounters with Astley while travelling.\n\n\"He is very shy,\" I said, \"and susceptible. Also, he is in love with\nyou.--\"\n\n\"Yes, he is in love with me,\" she replied.\n\n\"And he is ten times richer than the Frenchman. In fact, what does the\nFrenchman possess? To me it seems at least doubtful that he possesses\nanything at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, there is no doubt about it. He does possess some chateau or\nother. Last night the General told me that for certain. NOW are you\nsatisfied?\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, in your place I should marry the Englishman.\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked Polina.\n\n\"Because, though the Frenchman is the handsomer of the two, he is also\nthe baser; whereas the Englishman is not only a man of honour, but ten\ntimes the wealthier of the pair.\"\n\n\"Yes? But then the Frenchman is a marquis, and the cleverer of the\ntwo,\" remarked Polina imperturbably.\n\n\"Is that so?\" I repeated.\n\n\"Yes; absolutely.\"\n\nPolina was not at all pleased at my questions; I could see that she was\ndoing her best to irritate me with the brusquerie of her answers. But I\ntook no notice of this.\n\n\"It amuses me to see you grow angry,\" she continued. \"However, inasmuch\nas I allow you to indulge in these questions and conjectures, you ought\nto pay me something for the privilege.\"\n\n\"I consider that I have a perfect right to put these questions to you,\"\nwas my calm retort; \"for the reason that I am ready to pay for them,\nand also care little what becomes of me.\"\n\nPolina giggled.\n\n\"Last time you told me--when on the Shlangenberg--that at a word from\nme you would be ready to jump down a thousand feet into the abyss. Some\nday I may remind you of that saying, in order to see if you will be as\ngood as your word. Yes, you may depend upon it that I shall do so. I\nhate you because I have allowed you to go to such lengths, and I also\nhate you and still more--because you are so necessary to me. For the\ntime being I want you, so I must keep you.\"\n\nThen she made a movement to rise. Her tone had sounded very angry.\nIndeed, of late her talks with me had invariably ended on a note of\ntemper and irritation--yes, of real temper.\n\n\"May I ask you who is this Mlle. Blanche?\" I inquired (since I did not\nwish Polina to depart without an explanation).\n\n\"You KNOW who she is--just Mlle. Blanche. Nothing further has\ntranspired. Probably she will soon be Madame General--that is to say,\nif the rumours that Grandmamma is nearing her end should prove true.\nMlle. Blanche, with her mother and her cousin, the Marquis, know very\nwell that, as things now stand, we are ruined.\"\n\n\"And is the General at last in love?\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it. Listen to me. Take these 700 florins,\nand go and play roulette with them. Win as much for me as you can, for\nI am badly in need of money.\"\n\nSo saying, she called Nadia back to her side, and entered the Casino,\nwhere she joined the rest of our party. For myself, I took, in musing\nastonishment, the first path to the left. Something had seemed to\nstrike my brain when she told me to go and play roulette. Strangely\nenough, that something had also seemed to make me hesitate, and to set\nme analysing my feelings with regard to her. In fact, during the two\nweeks of my absence I had felt far more at my ease than I did now, on\nthe day of my return; although, while travelling, I had moped like an\nimbecile, rushed about like a man in a fever, and actually beheld her\nin my dreams. Indeed, on one occasion (this happened in Switzerland,\nwhen I was asleep in the train) I had spoken aloud to her, and set all\nmy fellow-travellers laughing. Again, therefore, I put to myself the\nquestion: \"Do I, or do I not love her?\" and again I could return myself\nno answer or, rather, for the hundredth time I told myself that I\ndetested her. Yes, I detested her; there were moments (more especially\nat the close of our talks together) when I would gladly have given half\nmy life to have strangled her! I swear that, had there, at such\nmoments, been a sharp knife ready to my hand, I would have seized that\nknife with pleasure, and plunged it into her breast. Yet I also swear\nthat if, on the Shlangenberg, she had REALLY said to me, \"Leap into\nthat abyss,\" I should have leapt into it, and with equal pleasure. Yes,\nthis I knew well. One way or the other, the thing must soon be ended.\nShe, too, knew it in some curious way; the thought that I was fully\nconscious of her inaccessibility, and of the impossibility of my ever\nrealising my dreams, afforded her, I am certain, the keenest possible\npleasure. Otherwise, is it likely that she, the cautious and clever\nwoman that she was, would have indulged in this familiarity and\nopenness with me? Hitherto (I concluded) she had looked upon me in the\nsame light that the old Empress did upon her servant--the Empress who\nhesitated not to unrobe herself before her slave, since she did not\naccount a slave a man. Yes, often Polina must have taken me for\nsomething less than a man!\"\n\nStill, she had charged me with a commission--to win what I could at\nroulette. Yet all the time I could not help wondering WHY it was so\nnecessary for her to win something, and what new schemes could have\nsprung to birth in her ever-fertile brain. A host of new and unknown\nfactors seemed to have arisen during the last two weeks. Well, it\nbehoved me to divine them, and to probe them, and that as soon as\npossible. Yet not now: at the present moment I must repair to the\nroulette-table.\n\n\n\nII\n\nI confess I did not like it. Although I had made up my mind to play, I\nfelt averse to doing so on behalf of some one else. In fact, it almost\nupset my balance, and I entered the gaming rooms with an angry feeling\nat my heart. At first glance the scene irritated me. Never at any time\nhave I been able to bear the flunkeyishness which one meets in the\nPress of the world at large, but more especially in that of Russia,\nwhere, almost every evening, journalists write on two subjects in\nparticular namely, on the splendour and luxury of the casinos to be\nfound in the Rhenish towns, and on the heaps of gold which are daily to\nbe seen lying on their tables.  Those journalists are not paid for\ndoing so: they write thus merely out of a spirit of disinterested\ncomplaisance. For there is nothing splendid about the establishments in\nquestion; and, not only are there no heaps of gold to be seen lying on\ntheir tables, but also there is very little money to be seen at all. Of\ncourse, during the season, some madman or another may make his\nappearance--generally an Englishman, or an Asiatic, or a Turk--and (as\nhad happened during the summer of which I write) win or lose a great\ndeal; but, as regards the rest of the crowd, it plays only for petty\ngulden, and seldom does much wealth figure on the board.\n\nWhen, on the present occasion, I entered the gaming-rooms (for the\nfirst time in my life), it was several moments before I could even make\nup my mind to play. For one thing, the crowd oppressed me. Had I been\nplaying for myself, I think I should have left at once, and never have\nembarked upon gambling at all, for I could feel my heart beginning to\nbeat, and my heart was anything but cold-blooded. Also, I knew, I had\nlong ago made up my mind, that never should I depart from Roulettenberg\nuntil some radical, some final, change had taken place in my fortunes.\nThus, it must and would be. However ridiculous it may seem to you that\nI was expecting to win at roulette, I look upon the generally accepted\nopinion concerning the folly and the grossness of hoping to win at\ngambling as a thing even more absurd. For why is gambling a whit worse\nthan any other method of acquiring money? How, for instance, is it\nworse than trade? True, out of a hundred persons, only one can win; yet\nwhat business is that of yours or of mine?\n\nAt all events, I confined myself at first simply to looking on, and\ndecided to attempt nothing serious. Indeed, I felt that, if I began to\ndo anything at all, I should do it in an absent-minded, haphazard sort\nof way--of that I felt certain. Also, it behoved me to learn the game\nitself; since, despite a thousand descriptions of roulette which I had\nread with ceaseless avidity, I knew nothing of its rules, and had never\neven seen it played.\n\nIn the first place, everything about it seemed to me so foul--so\nmorally mean and foul. Yet I am not speaking of the hungry, restless\nfolk who, by scores nay, even by hundreds--could be seen crowded around\nthe gaming-tables. For in a desire to win quickly and to win much I can\nsee nothing sordid; I have always applauded the opinion of a certain\ndead and gone, but cocksure, moralist who replied to the excuse that\n\"one may always gamble moderately\", by saying that to do so makes\nthings worse, since, in that case, the profits too will always be\nmoderate.\n\nInsignificant profits and sumptuous profits do not stand on the same\nfooting. No, it is all a matter of proportion. What may seem a small\nsum to a Rothschild may seem a large sum to me, and it is not the fault\nof stakes or of winnings that everywhere men can be found winning, can\nbe found depriving their fellows of something, just as they do at\nroulette. As to the question whether stakes and winnings are, in\nthemselves, immoral is another question altogether, and I wish to\nexpress no opinion upon it. Yet the very fact that I was full of a\nstrong desire to win caused this gambling for gain, in spite of its\nattendant squalor, to contain, if you will, something intimate,\nsomething sympathetic, to my eyes: for it is always pleasant to see men\ndispensing with ceremony, and acting naturally, and in an unbuttoned\nmood....\n\nYet, why should I so deceive myself? I could see that the whole thing\nwas a vain and unreasoning pursuit; and what, at the first glance,\nseemed to me the ugliest feature in this mob of roulette players was\ntheir respect for their occupation--the seriousness, and even the\nhumility, with which they stood around the gaming tables. Moreover, I\nhad always drawn sharp distinctions between a game which is de mauvais\ngenre and a game which is permissible to a decent man. In fact, there\nare two sorts of gaming--namely, the game of the gentleman and the game\nof the plebs--the game for gain, and the game of the herd. Herein, as\nsaid, I draw sharp distinctions. Yet how essentially base are the\ndistinctions! For instance, a gentleman may stake, say, five or ten\nlouis d'or--seldom more, unless he is a very rich man, when he may\nstake, say, a thousand francs; but, he must do this simply for the love\nof the game itself--simply for sport, simply in order to observe the\nprocess of winning or of losing, and, above all things, as a man who\nremains quite uninterested in the possibility of his issuing a winner.\nIf he wins, he will be at liberty, perhaps, to give vent to a laugh, or\nto pass a remark on the circumstance to a bystander, or to stake again,\nor to double his stake; but, even this he must do solely out of\ncuriosity, and for the pleasure of watching the play of chances and of\ncalculations, and not because of any vulgar desire to win. In a word,\nhe must look upon the gaming-table, upon roulette, and upon trente et\nquarante, as mere relaxations which have been arranged solely for his\namusement. Of the existence of the lures and gains upon which the bank\nis founded and maintained he must profess to have not an inkling. Best\nof all, he ought to imagine his fellow-gamblers and the rest of the mob\nwhich stands trembling over a coin to be equally rich and gentlemanly\nwith himself, and playing solely for recreation and pleasure. This\ncomplete ignorance of the realities, this innocent view of mankind, is\nwhat, in my opinion, constitutes the truly aristocratic. For instance,\nI have seen even fond mothers so far indulge their guileless, elegant\ndaughters--misses of fifteen or sixteen--as to give them a few gold\ncoins and teach them how to play; and though the young ladies may have\nwon or have lost, they have invariably laughed, and departed as though\nthey were well pleased. In the same way, I saw our General once\napproach the table in a stolid, important manner. A lacquey darted to\noffer him a chair, but the General did not even notice him. Slowly he\ntook out his money bags, and slowly extracted 300 francs in gold, which\nhe staked on the black, and won. Yet he did not take up his\nwinnings--he left them there on the table. Again the black turned up,\nand again he did not gather in what he had won; and when, in the third\nround, the RED turned up he lost, at a stroke, 1200 francs. Yet even\nthen he rose with a smile, and thus preserved his reputation; yet I\nknew that his money bags must be chafing his heart, as well as that,\nhad the stake been twice or thrice as much again, he would still have\nrestrained himself from venting his disappointment.\n\nOn the other hand, I saw a Frenchman first win, and then lose, 30,000\nfrancs cheerfully, and without a murmur. Yes; even if a gentleman\nshould lose his whole substance, he must never give way to annoyance.\nMoney must be so subservient to gentility as never to be worth a\nthought.  Of course, the SUPREMELY aristocratic thing is to be entirely\noblivious of the mire of rabble, with its setting; but sometimes a\nreverse course may be aristocratic to remark, to scan, and even to gape\nat, the mob (for preference, through a lorgnette), even as though one\nwere taking the crowd and its squalor for a sort of raree show which\nhad been organised specially for a gentleman's diversion. Though one\nmay be squeezed by the crowd, one must look as though one were fully\nassured of being the observer--of having neither part nor lot with the\nobserved. At the same time, to stare fixedly about one is unbecoming;\nfor that, again, is ungentlemanly, seeing that no spectacle is worth an\nopen stare--are no spectacles in the world which merit from a gentleman\ntoo pronounced an inspection.\n\nHowever, to me personally the scene DID seem to be worth undisguised\ncontemplation--more especially in view of the fact that I had come\nthere not only to look at, but also to number myself sincerely and\nwholeheartedly with, the mob. As for my secret moral views, I had no\nroom for them amongst my actual, practical opinions. Let that stand as\nwritten: I am writing only to relieve my conscience. Yet let me say\nalso this: that from the first I have been consistent in having an\nintense aversion to any trial of my acts and thoughts by a moral\nstandard. Another standard altogether has directed my life....\n\nAs a matter of fact, the mob was playing in exceedingly foul fashion.\nIndeed, I have an idea that sheer robbery was going on around that\ngaming-table. The croupiers who sat at the two ends of it had not only\nto watch the stakes, but also to calculate the game--an immense amount\nof work for two men! As for the crowd itself--well, it consisted mostly\nof Frenchmen. Yet I was not then taking notes merely in order to be\nable to give you a description of roulette, but in order to get my\nbearings as to my behaviour when I myself should begin to play. For\nexample, I noticed that nothing was more common than for another's hand\nto stretch out and grab one's winnings whenever one had won. Then there\nwould arise a dispute, and frequently an uproar; and it would be a case\nof \"I beg of you to prove, and to produce witnesses to the fact, that\nthe stake is yours.\"\n\nAt first the proceedings were pure Greek to me. I could only divine and\ndistinguish that stakes were hazarded on numbers, on \"odd\" or \"even,\"\nand on colours. Polina's money I decided to risk, that evening, only to\nthe amount of 100 gulden. The thought that I was not going to play for\nmyself quite unnerved me. It was an unpleasant sensation, and I tried\nhard to banish it. I had a feeling that, once I had begun to play for\nPolina, I should wreck my own fortunes. Also, I wonder if any one has\nEVER approached a gaming-table without falling an immediate prey to\nsuperstition? I began by pulling out fifty gulden, and staking them on\n\"even.\" The wheel spun and stopped at 13. I had lost! With a feeling\nlike a sick qualm, as though I would like to make my way out of the\ncrowd and go home, I staked another fifty gulden--this time on the red.\nThe red turned up. Next time I staked the 100 gulden just where they\nlay--and again the red turned up. Again I staked the whole sum, and\nagain the red turned up. Clutching my 400 gulden, I placed 200 of them\non twelve figures, to see what would come of it. The result was that\nthe croupier paid me out three times my total stake! Thus from 100\ngulden my store had grown to 800! Upon that such a curious, such an\ninexplicable, unwonted feeling overcame me that I decided to depart.\nAlways the thought kept recurring to me that if I had been playing for\nmyself alone I should never have had such luck. Once more I staked the\nwhole 800 gulden on the \"even.\" The wheel stopped at 4. I was paid out\nanother 800 gulden, and, snatching up my pile of 1600, departed in\nsearch of Polina  Alexandrovna.\n\nI found the whole party walking in the park, and was able to get an\ninterview with her only after supper. This time the Frenchman was\nabsent from the meal, and the General seemed to be in a more expansive\nvein. Among other things, he thought it necessary to remind me that he\nwould be sorry to see me playing at the gaming-tables. In his opinion,\nsuch conduct would greatly compromise him--especially if I were to lose\nmuch. \"And even if you were to WIN much I should be compromised,\" he\nadded in a meaning sort of way. \"Of course I have no RIGHT to order\nyour actions, but you yourself will agree that...\" As usual, he did not\nfinish his sentence. I answered drily that I had very little money in\nmy possession, and that, consequently, I was hardly in a position to\nindulge in any conspicuous play, even if I did gamble. At last, when\nascending to my own room, I succeeded in handing Polina her winnings,\nand told her that, next time, I should not play for her.\n\n\"Why not?\" she asked excitedly.\n\n\"Because I wish to play FOR MYSELF,\" I replied with a feigned glance of\nastonishment. \"That is my sole reason.\"\n\n\"Then are you so certain that your roulette-playing will get us out of\nour difficulties?\" she inquired with a quizzical smile.\n\nI said very seriously, \"Yes,\" and then added: \"Possibly my certainty\nabout winning may seem to you ridiculous; yet, pray leave me in peace.\"\n\nNonetheless she insisted that I ought to go halves with her in the\nday's winnings, and offered me 800 gulden on condition that henceforth,\nI gambled only on those terms; but I refused to do so, once and for\nall--stating, as my reason, that I found myself unable to play on\nbehalf of any one else, \"I am not unwilling so to do,\" I added, \"but in\nall probability I should lose.\"\n\n\"Well, absurd though it be, I place great hopes on your playing of\nroulette,\" she remarked musingly; \"wherefore, you ought to play as my\npartner and on equal shares; wherefore, of course, you will do as I\nwish.\"\n\nThen she left me without listening to any further protests on my part.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nOn the morrow she said not a word to me about gambling. In fact, she\npurposely avoided me, although her old manner to me had not changed:\nthe same serene coolness was hers on meeting me--a coolness that was\nmingled even with a spice of contempt and dislike. In short, she was at\nno pains to conceal her aversion to me. That I could see plainly. Also,\nshe did not trouble to conceal from me the fact that I was necessary to\nher, and that she was keeping me for some end which she had in view.\nConsequently there became established between us relations which, to a\nlarge extent, were incomprehensible to me, considering her general\npride and aloofness. For example, although she knew that I was madly in\nlove with her, she allowed me to speak to her of my passion (though she\ncould not well have showed her contempt for me more than by permitting\nme, unhindered and unrebuked, to mention to her my love).\n\n\"You see,\" her attitude expressed, \"how little I regard your feelings,\nas well as how little I care for what you say to me, or for what you\nfeel for me.\" Likewise, though she spoke as before concerning her\naffairs, it was never with complete frankness. In her contempt for me\nthere were refinements. Although she knew well that I was aware of a\ncertain circumstance in her life of something which might one day cause\nher trouble, she would speak to me about her affairs (whenever she had\nneed of me for a given end) as though I were a slave or a passing\nacquaintance--yet tell them me only in so far as one would need to know\nthem if one were going to be made temporary use of. Had I not known the\nwhole chain of events, or had she not seen how much I was pained and\ndisturbed by her teasing insistency, she would never have thought it\nworthwhile to soothe me with this frankness--even though, since she not\ninfrequently used me to execute commissions that were not only\ntroublesome, but risky, she ought, in my opinion, to have been frank in\nANY case. But, forsooth, it was not worth her while to trouble about MY\nfeelings--about the fact that I was uneasy, and, perhaps, thrice as put\nabout by her cares and misfortunes as she was herself!\n\nFor three weeks I had known of her intention to take to roulette. She\nhad even warned me that she would like me to play on her behalf, since\nit was unbecoming for her to play in person; and, from the tone of her\nwords I had gathered that there was something on her mind besides a\nmere desire to win money. As if money could matter to HER! No, she had\nsome end in view, and there were circumstances at which I could guess,\nbut which I did not know for certain. True, the slavery and abasement\nin which she held me might have given me (such things often do so) the\npower to question her with abrupt directness (seeing that, inasmuch as\nI figured in her eyes as a mere slave and nonentity, she could not very\nwell have taken offence at any rude curiosity); but the fact was that,\nthough she let me question her, she never returned me a single answer,\nand at times did not so much as notice me. That is how matters stood.\n\nNext day there was a good deal of talk about a telegram which, four\ndays ago, had been sent to St. Petersburg, but to which there had come\nno answer. The General was visibly disturbed and moody, for the matter\nconcerned his mother. The Frenchman, too, was excited, and after dinner\nthe whole party talked long and seriously together--the Frenchman's\ntone being extraordinarily presumptuous and offhand to everybody. It\nalmost reminded one of the proverb, \"Invite a man to your table, and\nsoon he will place his feet upon it.\" Even to Polina he was brusque\nalmost to the point of rudeness. Yet still he seemed glad to join us in\nour walks in the Casino, or in our rides and drives about the town. I\nhad long been aware of certain circumstances which bound the General to\nhim; I had long been aware that in Russia they had hatched some scheme\ntogether although I did not know whether the plot had come to anything,\nor whether it was still only in the stage of being talked of. Likewise\nI was aware, in part, of a family secret--namely, that, last year, the\nFrenchman had bailed the General out of debt, and given him 30,000\nroubles wherewith to pay his Treasury dues on retiring from the\nservice. And now, of course, the General was in a vice--although the\nchief part in the affair was being played by Mlle. Blanche. Yes, of\nthis last I had no doubt.\n\nBut WHO was this Mlle. Blanche? It was said of her that she was a\nFrenchwoman of good birth who, living with her mother, possessed a\ncolossal fortune. It was also said that she was some relation to the\nMarquis, but only a distant one a cousin, or cousin-german, or\nsomething of the sort. Likewise I knew that, up to the time of my\njourney to Paris, she and the Frenchman had been more ceremonious\ntowards our party--they had stood on a much more precise and delicate\nfooting with them; but that now their acquaintanceship--their\nfriendship, their intimacy--had taken on a much more off-hand and\nrough-and-ready air. Perhaps they thought that our means were too\nmodest for them, and, therefore, unworthy of politeness or reticence.\nAlso, for the last three days I had noticed certain looks which Astley\nhad kept throwing at Mlle. Blanche and her mother; and it had occurred\nto me that he must have had some previous acquaintance with the pair. I\nhad even surmised that the Frenchman too must have met Mr. Astley\nbefore. Astley was a man so shy, reserved, and taciturn in his manner\nthat one might have looked for anything from him. At all events the\nFrenchman accorded him only the slightest of greetings, and scarcely\neven looked at him. Certainly he did not seem to be afraid of him;\nwhich was intelligible enough. But why did Mlle. Blanche also never\nlook at the Englishman?--particularly since, a propos of something or\nanother, the Marquis had declared the Englishman to be immensely and\nindubitably rich? Was not that a sufficient reason to make Mlle.\nBlanche look at the Englishman? Anyway the General seemed extremely\nuneasy; and, one could well understand what a telegram to announce the\ndeath of his mother would mean for him!\n\nAlthough I thought it probable that Polina was avoiding me for a\ndefinite reason, I adopted a cold and indifferent air; for I felt\npretty certain that it would not be long before she herself approached\nme. For two days, therefore, I devoted my attention to Mlle. Blanche.\nThe poor General was in despair! To fall in love at fifty-five, and\nwith such vehemence, is indeed a misfortune! And add to that his\nwidowerhood, his children, his ruined property, his debts, and the\nwoman with whom he had fallen in love! Though Mlle. Blanche was\nextremely good-looking, I may or may not be understood when I say that\nshe had one of those faces which one is afraid of. At all events, I\nmyself have always feared such women. Apparently about twenty-five\nyears of age, she was tall and broad-shouldered, with shoulders that\nsloped; yet though her neck and bosom were ample in their proportions,\nher skin was dull yellow in colour, while her hair (which was extremely\nabundant--sufficient to make two coiffures) was as black as Indian ink.\nAdd to that a pair of black eyes with yellowish whites, a proud glance,\ngleaming teeth, and lips which were perennially pomaded and redolent of\nmusk. As for her dress, it was invariably rich, effective, and chic,\nyet in good taste. Lastly, her feet and hands were astonishing, and her\nvoice a deep contralto. Sometimes, when she laughed, she displayed her\nteeth, but at ordinary times her air was taciturn and\nhaughty--especially in the presence of Polina and Maria Philipovna. Yet\nshe seemed to me almost destitute of education, and even of wits,\nthough cunning and suspicious. This, apparently, was not because her\nlife had been lacking in incident. Perhaps, if all were known, the\nMarquis was not her kinsman at all, nor her mother, her mother; but\nthere was evidence that, in Berlin, where we had first come across the\npair, they had possessed acquaintances of good standing. As for the\nMarquis himself, I doubt to this day if he was a Marquis--although\nabout the fact that he had formerly belonged to high society (for\ninstance, in Moscow and Germany) there could be no doubt whatever. What\nhe had formerly been in France I had not a notion. All I knew was that\nhe was said to possess a chateau. During the last two weeks I had\nlooked for much to transpire, but am still ignorant whether at that\ntime anything decisive ever passed between Mademoiselle and the\nGeneral. Everything seemed to depend upon our means--upon whether the\nGeneral would be able to flourish sufficient money in her face. If ever\nthe news should arrive that the grandmother was not dead, Mlle.\nBlanche, I felt sure, would disappear in a twinkling. Indeed, it\nsurprised and amused me to observe what a passion for intrigue I was\ndeveloping. But how I loathed it all! With what pleasure would I have\ngiven everybody and everything the go-by! Only--I could not leave\nPolina. How, then, could I show contempt for those who surrounded her?\nEspionage is a base thing, but--what have I to do with that?\n\nMr. Astley, too, I found a curious person. I was only sure that he had\nfallen in love with Polina. A remarkable and diverting circumstance is\nthe amount which may lie in the mien of a shy and painfully modest man\nwho has been touched with the divine passion--especially when he would\nrather sink into the earth than betray himself by a single word or\nlook. Though Mr. Astley frequently met us when we were out walking, he\nwould merely take off his hat and pass us by, though I knew he was\ndying to join us. Even when invited to do so, he would refuse. Again,\nin places of amusement--in the Casino, at concerts, or near the\nfountain--he was never far from the spot where we were sitting. In\nfact, WHEREVER we were in the Park, in the forest, or on the\nShlangenberg--one needed but to raise one's eyes and glance around to\ncatch sight of at least a PORTION of Mr. Astley's frame sticking\nout--whether on an adjacent path or behind a bush. Yet never did he\nlose any chance of speaking to myself; and, one morning when we had\nmet, and exchanged a couple of words, he burst out in his usual abrupt\nway, without saying \"Good-morning.\"\n\n\"That Mlle. Blanche,\" he said. \"Well, I have seen a good many women\nlike her.\"\n\nAfter that he was silent as he looked me meaningly in the face. What he\nmeant I did not know, but to my glance of inquiry he returned only a\ndry nod, and a reiterated \"It is so.\" Presently, however, he resumed:\n\n\"Does Mlle. Polina like flowers?\"\n\n\"I really cannot say,\" was my reply.\n\n\"What? You cannot say?\" he cried in great astonishment.\n\n\"No; I have never noticed whether she does so or not,\" I repeated with\na smile.\n\n\"Hm! Then I have an idea in my mind,\" he concluded. Lastly, with a nod,\nhe walked away with a pleased expression on his face. The conversation\nhad been carried on in execrable French.\n\n\n\nIV\n\nToday has been a day of folly, stupidity, and ineptness. The time is\nnow eleven o'clock in the evening, and I am sitting in my room and\nthinking. It all began, this morning, with my being forced to go and\nplay roulette for Polina Alexandrovna. When she handed me over her\nstore of six hundred gulden I exacted two conditions--namely, that I\nshould not go halves with her in her winnings, if any (that is to say,\nI should not take anything for myself), and that she should explain to\nme, that same evening, why it was so necessary for her to win, and how\nmuch was the sum which she needed. For, I could not suppose that she\nwas doing all this merely for the sake of money. Yet clearly she did\nneed some money, and that as soon as possible, and for a special\npurpose. Well, she promised to explain matters, and I departed. There\nwas a tremendous crowd in the gaming-rooms. What an arrogant, greedy\ncrowd it was! I pressed forward towards the middle of the room until I\nhad secured a seat at a croupier's elbow. Then I began to play in timid\nfashion, venturing only twenty or thirty gulden at a time. Meanwhile, I\nobserved and took notes. It seemed to me that calculation was\nsuperfluous, and by no means possessed of the importance which certain\nother players attached to it, even though they sat with ruled papers in\ntheir hands, whereon they set down the coups, calculated the chances,\nreckoned, staked, and--lost exactly as we more simple mortals did who\nplayed without any reckoning at all.\n\nHowever, I deduced from the scene one conclusion which seemed to me\nreliable--namely, that in the flow of fortuitous chances there is, if\nnot a system, at all events a sort of order. This, of course, is a very\nstrange thing. For instance, after a dozen middle figures there would\nalways occur a dozen or so outer ones. Suppose the ball stopped twice\nat a dozen outer figures; it would then pass to a dozen of the first\nones, and then, again, to a dozen of the middle ciphers, and fall upon\nthem three or four times, and then revert to a dozen outers; whence,\nafter another couple of rounds, the ball would again pass to the first\nfigures, strike upon them once, and then return thrice to the middle\nseries--continuing thus for an hour and a half, or two hours. One,\nthree, two: one, three, two. It was all very curious. Again, for the\nwhole of a day or a morning the red would alternate with the black, but\nalmost without any order, and from moment to moment, so that scarcely\ntwo consecutive rounds would end upon either the one or the other. Yet,\nnext day, or, perhaps, the next evening, the red alone would turn up,\nand attain a run of over two score, and continue so for quite a length\nof time--say, for a whole day. Of these circumstances the majority were\npointed out to me by Mr. Astley, who stood by the gaming-table the\nwhole morning, yet never once staked in person.\n\nFor myself, I lost all that I had on me, and with great speed. To begin\nwith, I staked two hundred gulden on \"even,\" and won. Then I staked the\nsame amount again, and won: and so on some two or three times. At one\nmoment I must have had in my hands--gathered there within a space of\nfive minutes--about 4000 gulden. That, of course, was the proper moment\nfor me to have departed, but there arose in me a strange sensation as\nof a challenge to Fate--as of a wish to deal her a blow on the cheek,\nand to put out my tongue at her. Accordingly I set down the largest\nstake allowed by the rules--namely, 4000 gulden--and lost. Fired by\nthis mishap, I pulled out all the money left to me, staked it all on\nthe same venture, and--again lost! Then I rose from the table, feeling\nas though I were stupefied. What had happened to me I did not know;\nbut, before luncheon I told Polina of my losses--until which time I\nwalked about the Park.\n\nAt luncheon I was as excited as I had been at the meal three days ago.\nMlle. Blanche and the Frenchman were lunching with us, and it appeared\nthat the former had been to the Casino that morning, and had seen my\nexploits there. So now she showed me more attention when talking to me;\nwhile, for his part, the Frenchman approached me, and asked outright if\nit had been my own money that I had lost. He appeared to be suspicious\nas to something being on foot between Polina and myself, but I merely\nfired up, and replied that the money had been all my own.\n\nAt this the General seemed extremely surprised, and asked me whence I\nhad procured it; whereupon I replied that, though I had begun only with\n100 gulden, six or seven rounds had increased my capital to 5000 or\n6000 gulden, and that subsequently I had lost the whole in two rounds.\n\nAll this, of course, was plausible enough. During my recital I glanced\nat Polina, but nothing was to be discerned on her face. However, she\nhad allowed me to fire up without correcting me, and from that I\nconcluded that it was my cue to fire up, and to conceal the fact that I\nhad been playing on her behalf. \"At all events,\" I thought to myself,\n\"she, in her turn, has promised to give me an explanation to-night, and\nto reveal to me something or another.\"\n\nAlthough the General appeared to be taking stock of me, he said\nnothing. Yet I could see uneasiness and annoyance in his face. Perhaps\nhis straitened circumstances made it hard for him to have to hear of\npiles of gold passing through the hands of an irresponsible fool like\nmyself within the space of a quarter of an hour. Now, I have an idea\nthat, last night, he and the Frenchman had a sharp encounter with one\nanother. At all events they closeted themselves together, and then had\na long and vehement discussion; after which the Frenchman departed in\nwhat appeared to be a passion, but returned, early this morning, to\nrenew the combat. On hearing of my losses, however, he only remarked\nwith a sharp, and even a malicious, air that \"a man ought to go more\ncarefully.\" Next, for some reason or another, he added that, \"though a\ngreat many Russians go in for gambling, they are no good at the game.\"\n\n\"I think that roulette was devised specially for Russians,\" I retorted;\nand when the Frenchman smiled contemptuously at my reply I further\nremarked that I was sure I was right; also that, speaking of Russians\nin the capacity of gamblers, I had far more blame for them than\npraise--of that he could be quite sure.\n\n\"Upon what do you base your opinion?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Upon the fact that to the virtues and merits of the civilised\nWesterner there has become historically added--though this is not his\nchief point--a capacity for acquiring capital; whereas, not only is the\nRussian incapable of acquiring capital, but also he exhausts it\nwantonly and of sheer folly. None the less we Russians often need\nmoney; wherefore, we are glad of, and greatly devoted to, a method of\nacquisition like roulette--whereby, in a couple of hours, one may grow\nrich without doing any work. This method, I repeat, has a great\nattraction for us, but since we play in wanton fashion, and without\ntaking any trouble, we almost invariably lose.\"\n\n\"To a certain extent that is true,\" assented the Frenchman with a\nself-satisfied air.\n\n\"Oh no, it is not true,\" put in the General sternly. \"And you,\" he\nadded to me, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself for traducing your\nown country!\"\n\n\"I beg pardon,\" I said. \"Yet it would be difficult to say which is the\nworst of the two--Russian ineptitude or the German method of growing\nrich through honest toil.\"\n\n\"What an extraordinary idea,\" cried the General.\n\n\"And what a RUSSIAN idea!\" added the Frenchman.\n\nI smiled, for I was rather glad to have a quarrel with them.\n\n\"I would rather live a wandering life in tents,\" I cried, \"than bow the\nknee to a German idol!\"\n\n\"To WHAT idol?\" exclaimed the General, now seriously angry.\n\n\"To the German method of heaping up riches. I have not been here very\nlong, but I can tell you that what I have seen and verified makes my\nTartar blood boil. Good Lord! I wish for no virtues of that kind.\nYesterday I went for a walk of about ten versts; and, everywhere I\nfound that things were even as we read of them in good German\npicture-books--that every house has its 'Fater,' who is horribly\nbeneficent and extraordinarily honourable. So honourable is he that it\nis dreadful to have anything to do with him; and I cannot bear people\nof that sort. Each such 'Fater' has his family, and in the evenings\nthey read improving books aloud. Over their roof-trees there murmur\nelms and chestnuts; the sun has sunk to his rest; a stork is roosting\non the gable; and all is beautifully poetic and touching. Do not be\nangry, General. Let me tell you something that is even more touching\nthan that. I can remember how, of an evening, my own father, now dead,\nused to sit under the lime trees in his little garden, and to read\nbooks aloud to myself and my mother. Yes, I know how things ought to be\ndone. Yet every German family is bound to slavery and to submission to\nits 'Fater.' They work like oxen, and amass wealth like Jews. Suppose\nthe 'Fater' has put by a certain number of gulden which he hands over\nto his eldest son, in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a\nsmall plot of land. Well, one result is to deprive the daughter of a\ndowry, and so leave her among the unwedded. For the same reason, the\nparents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of\nthe army, in order that he may earn more towards the family capital.\nYes, such things ARE done, for I have been making inquiries on the\nsubject. It is all done out of sheer rectitude--out of a rectitude\nwhich is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he\nhas been RIGHTLY sold, and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to\nrejoice when he is made over into pledge. What more have I to tell?\nWell, this--that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son.\nPerhaps he has his Gretchen to whom his heart is bound; but he cannot\nmarry her, for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient\ngulden. So, the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous\nexpectation, and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while.\nGretchen's cheeks grow sunken, and she begins to wither; until at last,\nafter some twenty years, their substance has multiplied, and sufficient\ngulden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated. Then the\n'Fater' blesses his forty-year-old heir and the thirty-five-year-old\nGretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose; after which he\nbursts, into tears, reads the pair a lesson on morality, and dies. In\nturn the eldest son becomes a virtuous 'Fater,' and the old story\nbegins again. In fifty or sixty years' time the grandson of the\noriginal 'Fater' will have amassed a considerable sum; and that sum he\nwill hand over to, his son, and the latter to HIS son, and so on for\nseveral generations; until at length there will issue a Baron\nRothschild, or a 'Hoppe and Company,' or the devil knows what! Is it\nnot a beautiful spectacle--the spectacle of a century or two of\ninherited labour, patience, intellect, rectitude, character,\nperseverance, and calculation, with a stork sitting on the roof above\nit all? What is more; they think there can never be anything better\nthan this; wherefore, from their point of view they begin to judge the\nrest of the world, and to censure all who are at fault--that is to say,\nwho are not exactly like themselves. Yes, there you have it in a\nnutshell. For my own part, I would rather grow fat after the Russian\nmanner, or squander my whole substance at roulette. I have no wish to\nbe 'Hoppe and Company' at the end of five generations. I want the money\nfor MYSELF, for in no way do I look upon my personality as necessary\nto, or meet to be given over to, capital. I may be wrong, but there you\nhave it. Those are MY views.\"\n\n\"How far you may be right in what you have said I do not know,\"\nremarked the General moodily; \"but I DO know that you are becoming an\ninsufferable farceur whenever you are given the least chance.\"\n\nAs usual, he left his sentence unfinished. Indeed, whenever he embarked\nupon anything that in the least exceeded the limits of daily\nsmall-talk, he left unfinished what he was saying. The Frenchman had\nlistened to me contemptuously, with a slight protruding of his eyes;\nbut, he could not have understood very much of my harangue. As for\nPolina, she had looked on with serene indifference. She seemed to have\nheard neither my voice nor any other during the progress of the meal.\n\n\n\nV\n\nYes, she had been extraordinarily meditative. Yet, on leaving the\ntable, she immediately ordered me to accompany her for a walk. We took\nthe children with us, and set out for the fountain in the Park.\n\nI was in such an irritated frame of mind that in rude and abrupt\nfashion I blurted out a question as to \"why our Marquis de Griers had\nceased to accompany her for strolls, or to speak to her for days\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Because he is a brute,\" she replied in rather a curious way. It was\nthe first time that I had heard her speak so of De Griers:\nconsequently, I was momentarily awed into silence by this expression of\nresentment.\n\n\"Have you noticed, too, that today he is by no means on good terms with\nthe General?\" I went on.\n\n\"Yes--and I suppose you want to know why,\" she replied with dry\ncaptiousness. \"You are aware, are you not, that the General is\nmortgaged to the Marquis, with all his property? Consequently, if the\nGeneral's mother does not die, the Frenchman will become the absolute\npossessor of everything which he now holds only in pledge.\"\n\n\"Then it is really the case that everything is mortgaged? I have heard\nrumours to that effect, but was unaware how far they might be true.\"\n\n\"Yes, they ARE true. What then?\"\n\n\"Why, it will be a case of 'Farewell, Mlle. Blanche,'\" I remarked; \"for\nin such an event she would never become Madame General. Do you know, I\nbelieve the old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot\nhimself if she should throw him over. At his age it is a dangerous\nthing to fall in love.\"\n\n\"Yes, something, I believe, WILL happen to him,\" assented Polina\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"And what a fine thing it all is!\" I continued. \"Could anything be more\nabominable than the way in which she has agreed to marry for money\nalone? Not one of the decencies has been observed; the whole affair has\ntaken place without the least ceremony. And as for the grandmother,\nwhat could be more comical, yet more dastardly, than the sending of\ntelegram after telegram to know if she is dead? What do you think of\nit, Polina Alexandrovna?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is very horrible,\" she interrupted with a shudder.\n\"Consequently, I am the more surprised that YOU should be so cheerful.\nWhat are YOU so pleased about? About the fact that you have gone and\nlost my money?\"\n\n\"What? The money that you gave me to lose? I told you I should never\nwin for other people--least of all for you. I obeyed you simply because\nyou ordered me to; but you must not blame me for the result. I warned\nyou that no good would ever come of it. You seem much depressed at\nhaving lost your money. Why do you need it so greatly?\"\n\n\"Why do YOU ask me these questions?\"\n\n\"Because you promised to explain matters to me. Listen. I am certain\nthat, as soon as ever I 'begin to play for myself' (and I still have\n120 gulden left), I shall win. You can then take of me what you\nrequire.\"\n\nShe made a contemptuous grimace.\n\n\"You must not be angry with me,\" I continued, \"for making such a\nproposal. I am so conscious of being only a nonentity in your eyes that\nyou need not mind accepting money from me. A gift from me could not\npossibly offend you. Moreover, it was I who lost your gulden.\"\n\nShe glanced at me, but, seeing that I was in an irritable, sarcastic\nmood, changed the subject.\n\n\"My affairs cannot possibly interest you,\" she said. \"Still, if you DO\nwish to know, I am in debt. I borrowed some money, and must pay it back\nagain. I have a curious, senseless idea that I am bound to win at the\ngaming-tables. Why I think so I cannot tell, but I do think so, and\nwith some assurance. Perhaps it is because of that assurance that I now\nfind myself without any other resource.\"\n\n\"Or perhaps it is because it is so NECESSARY for you to win. It is like\na drowning man catching at a straw. You yourself will agree that,\nunless he were drowning he would not mistake a straw for the trunk of a\ntree.\"\n\nPolina looked surprised.\n\n\"What?\" she said. \"Do not you also hope something from it? Did you not\ntell me again and again, two weeks ago, that you were certain of\nwinning at roulette if you played here? And did you not ask me not to\nconsider you a fool for doing so? Were you joking? You cannot have\nbeen, for I remember that you spoke with a gravity which forbade the\nidea of your jesting.\"\n\n\"True,\" I replied gloomily. \"I always felt certain that I should win.\nIndeed, what you say makes me ask myself--Why have my absurd, senseless\nlosses of today raised a doubt in my mind? Yet I am still positive\nthat, so soon as ever I begin to play for myself, I shall infallibly\nwin.\"\n\n\"And why are you so certain?\"\n\n\"To tell the truth, I do not know. I only know that I must win--that it\nis the one resource I have left. Yes, why do I feel so assured on the\npoint?\"\n\n\"Perhaps because one cannot help winning if one is fanatically certain\nof doing so.\"\n\n\"Yet I dare wager that you do not think me capable of serious feeling\nin the matter?\"\n\n\"I do not care whether you are so or not,\" answered Polina with calm\nindifference. \"Well, since you ask me, I DO doubt your ability to take\nanything seriously. You are capable of worrying, but not deeply. You\nare too ill-regulated and unsettled a person for that. But why do you\nwant money? Not a single one of the reasons which you have given can be\nlooked upon as serious.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" I interrupted, \"you say you want to pay off a debt. It\nmust be a large one. Is it to the Frenchman?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by asking all these questions? You are very clever\ntoday. Surely you are not drunk?\"\n\n\"You know that you and I stand on no ceremony, and that sometimes I put\nto you very plain questions. I repeat that I am your slave--and slaves\ncannot be shamed or offended.\"\n\n\"You talk like a child. It is always possible to comport oneself with\ndignity. If one has a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to\ndegrade one.\"\n\n\"A maxim straight from the copybook! Suppose I CANNOT comport myself\nwith dignity. By that I mean that, though I am a man of self-respect, I\nam unable to carry off a situation properly. Do you know the reason? It\nis because we Russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be\nable at once to find the proper mode of expression. It is all a\nquestion of mode. Most of us are so bounteously endowed with intellect\nas to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of\nbehaviour. And genius is lacking in us for the reason that so little\ngenius at all exists. It belongs only to the French--though a few other\nEuropeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure\nwith extreme dignity, and yet be wholly undignified persons. That is\nwhy, with us, the mode is so all-important. The Frenchman may receive\nan insult--a real, a venomous insult: yet, he will not so much as\nfrown. But a tweaking of the nose he cannot bear, for the reason that\nsuch an act is an infringement of the accepted, of the time-hallowed\norder of decorum. That is why our good ladies are so fond of\nFrenchmen--the Frenchman's manners, they say, are perfect! But in my\nopinion there is no such thing as a Frenchman's manners. The Frenchman\nis only a bird--the coq gaulois. At the same time, as I am not a woman,\nI do not properly understand the question. Cocks may be excellent\nbirds.  If I am wrong you must stop me. You ought to stop and correct\nme more often when I am speaking to you, for I am too apt to say\neverything that is in my head.\n\n\"You see, I have lost my manners. I agree that I have none, nor yet any\ndignity. I will tell you why. I set no store upon such things.\nEverything in me has undergone a cheek. You know the reason. I have not\na single human thought in my head. For a long while I have been\nignorant of what is going on in the world--here or in Russia. I have\nbeen to Dresden, yet am completely in the dark as to what Dresden is\nlike. You know the cause of my obsession. I have no hope now, and am a\nmere cipher in your eyes; wherefore, I tell you outright that wherever\nI go I see only you--all the rest is a matter of indifference.\n\n\"Why or how I have come to love you I do not know. It may be that you\nare not altogether fair to look upon. Do you know, I am ignorant even\nas to what your face is like. In all probability, too, your heart is\nnot comely, and it is possible that your mind is wholly ignoble.\"\n\n\"And because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to\npurchase me with money?\" she said.\n\n\"WHEN have I thought to do so?\" was my reply.\n\n\"You are losing the thread of the argument. If you do not wish to\npurchase me, at all events you wish to purchase my respect.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I have told you that I find it difficult to explain\nmyself. You are hard upon me. Do not be angry at my chattering. You\nknow why you ought not to be angry with me--that I am simply an\nimbecile. However, I do not mind if you ARE angry. Sitting in my room,\nI need but to think of you, to imagine to myself the rustle of your\ndress, and at once I fall almost to biting my hands. Why should you be\nangry with me? Because I call myself your slave? Revel, I pray you, in\nmy slavery--revel in it. Do you know that sometimes I could kill\nyou?--not because I do not love you, or am jealous of you, but, because\nI feel as though I could simply devour you... You are laughing!\"\n\n\"No, I am not,\" she retorted. \"But I order you, nevertheless, to be\nsilent.\"\n\nShe stopped, well nigh breathless with anger. God knows, she may not\nhave been a beautiful woman, yet I loved to see her come to a halt like\nthis, and was therefore, the more fond of arousing her temper. Perhaps\nshe divined this, and for that very reason gave way to rage. I said as\nmuch to her.\n\n\"What rubbish!\" she cried with a shudder.\n\n\"I do not care,\" I continued. \"Also, do you know that it is not safe\nfor us to take walks together? Often I have a feeling that I should\nlike to strike you, to disfigure you, to strangle you. Are you certain\nthat it will never come to that? You are driving me to frenzy. Am I\nafraid of a scandal, or of your anger? Why should I fear your anger? I\nlove without hope, and know that hereafter I shall love you a thousand\ntimes more. If ever I should kill you I should have to kill myself too.\nBut I shall put off doing so as long as possible, for I wish to\ncontinue enjoying the unbearable pain which your coldness gives me. Do\nyou know a very strange thing? It is that, with every day, my love for\nyou increases--though that would seem to be almost an impossibility.\nWhy should I not become a fatalist? Remember how, on the third day that\nwe ascended the Shlangenberg, I was moved to whisper in your ear: 'Say\nbut the word, and I will leap into the abyss.' Had you said it, I\nshould have leapt. Do you not believe me?\"\n\n\"What stupid rubbish!\" she cried.\n\n\"I care not whether it be wise or stupid,\" I cried in return. \"I only\nknow that in your presence I must speak, speak, speak. Therefore, I am\nspeaking. I lose all conceit when I am with you, and everything ceases\nto matter.\"\n\n\"Why should I have wanted you to leap from the Shlangenberg?\" she said\ndrily, and (I think) with wilful offensiveness. \"THAT would have been\nof no use to me.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" I shouted. \"I know well that you must have used the words\n'of no use' in order to crush me. I can see through you. 'Of no use,'\ndid you say? Why, to give pleasure is ALWAYS of use; and, as for\nbarbarous, unlimited power--even if it be only over a fly--why, it is a\nkind of luxury. Man is a despot by nature, and loves to torture. You,\nin particular, love to do so.\"\n\nI remember that at this moment she looked at me in a peculiar way. The\nfact is that my face must have been expressing all the maze of\nsenseless, gross sensations which were seething within me. To this day\nI can remember, word for word, the conversation as I have written it\ndown. My eyes were suffused with blood, and the foam had caked itself\non my lips. Also, on my honour I swear that, had she bidden me cast\nmyself from the summit of the Shlangenberg, I should have done it. Yes,\nhad she bidden me in jest, or only in contempt and with a spit in my\nface, I should have cast myself down.\n\n\"Oh no! Why so? I believe you,\" she said, but in such a manner--in the\nmanner of which, at times, she was a mistress--and with such a note of\ndisdain and viperish arrogance in her tone, that God knows I could have\nkilled her.\n\nYes, at that moment she stood in peril. I had not lied to her about\nthat.\n\n\"Surely you are not a coward?\" suddenly she asked me.\n\n\"I do not know,\" I replied. \"Perhaps I am, but I do not know. I have\nlong given up thinking about such things.\"\n\n\"If I said to you, 'Kill that man,' would you kill him?\"\n\n\"Whom?\"\n\n\"Whomsoever I wish?\"\n\n\"The Frenchman?\"\n\n\"Do not ask me questions; return me answers. I repeat, whomsoever I\nwish? I desire to see if you were speaking seriously just now.\"\n\nShe awaited my reply with such gravity and impatience that I found the\nsituation unpleasant.\n\n\"Do YOU, rather, tell me,\" I said, \"what is going on here? Why do you\nseem half-afraid of me? I can see for myself what is wrong. You are the\nstep-daughter of a ruined and insensate man who is smitten with love\nfor this devil of a Blanche. And there is this Frenchman, too, with his\nmysterious influence over you. Yet, you actually ask me such a\nquestion! If you do not tell me how things stand, I shall have to put\nin my oar and do something. Are you ashamed to be frank with me? Are\nyou shy of me?\"\n\n\"I am not going to talk to you on that subject. I have asked you a\nquestion, and am waiting for an answer.\"\n\n\"Well, then--I will kill whomsoever you wish,\" I said. \"But are you\nREALLY going to bid me do such deeds?\"\n\n\"Why should you think that I am going to let you off? I shall bid you\ndo it, or else renounce me. Could you ever do the latter? No, you know\nthat you couldn't. You would first kill whom I had bidden you, and then\nkill ME for having dared to send you away!\"\n\nSomething seemed to strike upon my brain as I heard these words. Of\ncourse, at the time I took them half in jest and half as a challenge;\nyet, she had spoken them with great seriousness. I felt thunderstruck\nthat she should so express herself, that she should assert such a right\nover me, that she should assume such authority and say outright:\n\"Either you kill whom I bid you, or I will have nothing more to do with\nyou.\" Indeed, in what she had said there was something so cynical and\nunveiled as to pass all bounds. For how could she ever regard me as the\nsame after the killing was done? This was more than slavery and\nabasement; it was sufficient to bring a man back to his right senses.\nYet, despite the outrageous improbability of our conversation, my heart\nshook within me.\n\nSuddenly, she burst out laughing. We were seated on a bench near the\nspot where the children were playing--just opposite the point in the\nalley-way before the Casino where the carriages drew up in order to set\ndown their occupants.\n\n\"Do you see that fat Baroness?\" she cried. \"It is the Baroness\nBurmergelm. She arrived three days ago. Just look at her husband--that\ntall, wizened Prussian there, with the stick in his hand. Do you\nremember how he stared at us the other day? Well, go to the Baroness,\ntake off your hat to her, and say something in French.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you have sworn that you would leap from the Shlangenberg for\nmy sake, and that you would kill any one whom I might bid you kill.\nWell, instead of such murders and tragedies, I wish only for a good\nlaugh. Go without answering me, and let me see the Baron give you a\nsound thrashing with his stick.\"\n\n\"Then you throw me out a challenge?--you think that I will not do it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do challenge you. Go, for such is my will.\"\n\n\"Then I WILL go, however mad be your fancy. Only, look here: shall you\nnot be doing the General a great disservice, as well as, through him, a\ngreat disservice to yourself? It is not about myself I am worrying--it\nis about you and the General. Why, for a mere fancy, should I go and\ninsult a woman?\"\n\n\"Ah! Then I can see that you are only a trifler,\" she said\ncontemptuously. \"Your eyes are swimming with blood--but only because\nyou have drunk a little too much at luncheon. Do I not know that what I\nhave asked you to do is foolish and wrong, and that the General will be\nangry about it? But I want to have a good laugh, all the same. I want\nthat, and nothing else. Why should you insult a woman, indeed? Well,\nyou will be given a sound thrashing for so doing.\"\n\nI turned away, and went silently to do her bidding. Of course the thing\nwas folly, but I could not get out of it. I remember that, as I\napproached the Baroness, I felt as excited as a schoolboy. I was in a\nfrenzy, as though I were drunk.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTwo days have passed since that day of lunacy. What a noise and a fuss\nand a chattering and an uproar there was! And what a welter of\nunseemliness and disorder and stupidity and bad manners! And I the\ncause of it all! Yet part of the scene was also ridiculous--at all\nevents to myself it was so. I am not quite sure what was the matter\nwith me--whether I was merely stupefied or whether I purposely broke\nloose and ran amok. At times my mind seems all confused; while at other\ntimes I seem almost to be back in my childhood, at the school desk, and\nto have done the deed simply out of mischief.\n\nIt all came of Polina--yes, of Polina. But for her, there might never\nhave been a fracas. Or perhaps I did the deed in a fit of despair\n(though it may be foolish of me to think so)? What there is so\nattractive about her I cannot think. Yet there IS something attractive\nabout her--something passing fair, it would seem. Others besides myself\nshe has driven to distraction. She is tall and straight, and very slim.\nHer body looks as though it could be tied into a knot, or bent double,\nlike a cord. The imprint of her foot is long and narrow. It is, a\nmaddening imprint--yes, simply a maddening one! And her hair has a\nreddish tint about it, and her eyes are like cat's eyes--though able\nalso to glance with proud, disdainful mien. On the evening of my first\narrival, four months ago, I remember that she was sitting and holding\nan animated conversation with De Griers in the salon. And the way in\nwhich she looked at him was such that later, when I retired to my own\nroom upstairs, I kept fancying that she had smitten him in the\nface--that she had smitten him right on the cheek, so peculiar had been\nher look as she stood confronting him. Ever since that evening I have\nloved her.\n\nBut to my tale.\n\nI stepped from the path into the carriage-way, and took my stand in the\nmiddle of it. There I awaited the Baron and the Baroness. When they\nwere but a few paces distant from me I took off my hat, and bowed.\n\nI remember that the Baroness was clad in a voluminous silk dress, pale\ngrey in colour, and adorned with flounces and a crinoline and train.\nAlso, she was short and inordinately stout, while her gross, flabby\nchin completely concealed her neck. Her face was purple, and the little\neyes in it had an impudent, malicious expression. Yet she walked as\nthough she were conferring a favour upon everybody by so doing. As for\nthe Baron, he was tall, wizened, bony-faced after the German fashion,\nspectacled, and, apparently, about forty-five years of age. Also, he\nhad legs which seemed to begin almost at his chest--or, rather, at his\nchin! Yet, for all his air of peacock-like conceit, his clothes sagged\na little, and his face wore a sheepish air which might have passed for\nprofundity.\n\nThese details I noted within a space of a few seconds.\n\nAt first my bow and the fact that I had my hat in my hand barely caught\ntheir attention. The Baron only scowled a little, and the Baroness\nswept straight on.\n\n\"Madame la Baronne,\" said I, loudly and distinctly--embroidering each\nword, as it were--\"j'ai l'honneur d'etre votre esclave.\"\n\nThen I bowed again, put on my hat, and walked past the Baron with a\nrude smile on my face.\n\nPolina had ordered me merely to take off my hat: the bow and the\ngeneral effrontery were of my own invention. God knows what instigated\nme to perpetrate the outrage! In my frenzy I felt as though I were\nwalking on air.\n\n\"Hein!\" ejaculated--or, rather, growled--the Baron as he turned towards\nme in angry surprise.\n\nI too turned round, and stood waiting in pseudo-courteous expectation.\nYet still I wore on my face an impudent smile as I gazed at him. He\nseemed to hesitate, and his brows contracted to their utmost limits.\nEvery moment his visage was growing darker. The Baroness also turned in\nmy direction, and gazed at me in wrathful perplexity, while some of the\npassers-by also began to stare at us, and others of them halted\noutright.\n\n\"Hein!\" the Baron vociferated again, with a redoubled growl and a note\nof growing wrath in his voice.\n\n\"Ja wohl!\" I replied, still looking him in the eyes.\n\n\"Sind sie rasend?\" he exclaimed, brandishing his stick, and,\napparently, beginning to feel nervous. Perhaps it was my costume which\nintimidated him, for I was well and fashionably dressed, after the\nmanner of a man who belongs to indisputably good society.\n\n\"Ja wo-o-ohl!\" cried I again with all my might with a longdrawn rolling\nof the \"ohl\" sound after the fashion of the Berliners (who constantly\nuse the phrase \"Ja wohl!\" in conversation, and more or less prolong the\nsyllable \"ohl\" according as they desire to express different shades of\nmeaning or of mood).\n\nAt this the Baron and the Baroness faced sharply about, and almost fled\nin their alarm. Some of the bystanders gave vent to excited\nexclamations, and others remained staring at me in astonishment. But I\ndo not remember the details very well.\n\nWheeling quietly about, I returned in the direction of Polina\nAlexandrovna. But, when I had got within a hundred paces of her seat, I\nsaw her rise and set out with the children towards the hotel.\n\nAt the portico I caught up to her.\n\n\"I have perpetrated the--the piece of idiocy,\" I said as I came level\nwith her.\n\n\"Have you? Then you can take the consequences,\" she replied without so\nmuch as looking at me. Then she moved towards the staircase.\n\nI spent the rest of the evening walking in the park. Thence I passed\ninto the forest, and walked on until I found myself in a neighbouring\nprincipality. At a wayside restaurant I partook of an omelette and some\nwine, and was charged for the idyllic repast a thaler and a half.\n\nNot until eleven o'clock did I return home--to find a summons awaiting\nme from the General.\n\nOur party occupied two suites in the hotel; each of which contained two\nrooms. The first (the larger suite) comprised a salon and a\nsmoking-room, with, adjoining the latter, the General's study. It was\nhere that he was awaiting me as he stood posed in a majestic attitude\nbeside his writing-table. Lolling on a divan close by was De Griers.\n\n\"My good sir,\" the General began, \"may I ask you what this is that you\nhave gone and done?\"\n\n\"I should be glad,\" I replied, \"if we could come straight to the point.\nProbably you are referring to my encounter of today with a German?\"\n\n\"With a German? Why, the German was the Baron Burmergelm--a most\nimportant personage! I hear that you have been rude both to him and to\nthe Baroness?\"\n\n\"No, I have not.\"\n\n\"But I understand that you simply terrified them, my good sir?\" shouted\nthe General.\n\n\"Not in the least,\" I replied. \"You must know that when I was in Berlin\nI frequently used to hear the Berliners repeat, and repellently\nprolong, a certain phrase--namely, 'Ja wohl!'; and, happening to meet\nthis couple in the carriage-drive, I found, for some reason or another,\nthat this phrase suddenly recurred to my memory, and exercised a\nrousing effect upon my spirits. Moreover, on the three previous\noccasions that I have met the Baroness she has walked towards me as\nthough I were a worm which could easily be crushed with the foot. Not\nunnaturally, I too possess a measure of self-respect; wherefore, on\nTHIS occasion I took off my hat, and said politely (yes, I assure you\nit was said politely): 'Madame, j'ai l'honneur d'etre votre esclave.'\nThen the Baron turned round, and said 'Hein!'; whereupon I felt moved\nto ejaculate in answer 'Ja wohl!' Twice I shouted it at him--the first\ntime in an ordinary tone, and the second time with the greatest\nprolonging of the words of which I was capable. That is all.\"\n\nI must confess that this puerile explanation gave me great pleasure. I\nfelt a strong desire to overlay the incident with an even added measure\nof grossness; so, the further I proceeded, the more did the gusto of my\nproceeding increase.\n\n\"You are only making fun of me!\" vociferated the General as, turning to\nthe Frenchman, he declared that my bringing about of the incident had\nbeen gratuitous. De Griers smiled contemptuously, and shrugged his\nshoulders.\n\n\"Do not think THAT,\" I put in. \"It was not so at all. I grant you that\nmy behaviour was bad--I fully confess that it was so, and make no\nsecret of the fact. I would even go so far as to grant you that my\nbehaviour might well be called stupid and indecent tomfoolery; but,\nMORE than that it was not. Also, let me tell you that I am very sorry\nfor my conduct. Yet there is one circumstance which, in my eyes, almost\nabsolves me from regret in the matter. Of late--that is to say, for the\nlast two or three weeks--I have been feeling not at all well. That is\nto say, I have been in a sick, nervous, irritable, fanciful condition,\nso that I have periodically lost control over myself. For instance, on\nmore than one occasion I have tried to pick a quarrel even with\nMonsieur le Marquise here; and, under the circumstances, he had no\nchoice but to answer me. In short, I have recently been showing signs\nof ill-health. Whether the Baroness Burmergelm will take this\ncircumstance into consideration when I come to beg her pardon (for I do\nintend to make her amends) I do not know; but I doubt if she will, and\nthe less so since, so far as I know, the circumstance is one which, of\nlate, has begun to be abused in the legal world, in that advocates in\ncriminal cases have taken to justifying their clients on the ground\nthat, at the moment of the crime, they (the clients) were unconscious\nof what they were doing--that, in short, they were out of health. 'My\nclient committed the murder--that is true; but he has no recollection\nof having committed it.' And doctors actually support these advocates\nby affirming that there really is such a malady--that there really can\narise temporary delusions which make a man remember nothing of a given\ndeed, or only a half or a quarter of it! But the Baron and Baroness are\nmembers of an older generation, as well as Prussian Junkers and\nlandowners. To them such a process in the medico-judicial world will be\nunknown, and therefore, they are the more unlikely to accept any such\nexplanation. What is YOUR opinion about it, General?\"\n\n\"Enough, sir!\" he thundered with barely restrained fury. \"Enough, I\nsay! Once and for all I must endeavour to rid myself of you and your\nimpertinence. To justify yourself in the eyes of the Baron and Baroness\nwill be impossible. Any intercourse with you, even though it be\nconfined to a begging of their pardons, they would look upon as a\ndegradation. I may tell you that, on learning that you formed part of,\nmy household, the Baron approached me in the Casino, and demanded of me\nadditional satisfaction. Do you understand, then, what it is that you\nhave entailed upon me--upon ME, my good sir? You have entailed upon me\nthe fact of my being forced to sue humbly to the Baron, and to give him\nmy word of honour that this very day you shall cease to belong to my\nestablishment!\"\n\n\"Excuse me, General,\" I interrupted, \"but did he make an express point\nof it that I should 'cease to belong to your establishment,' as you\ncall it?\"\n\n\"No; I, of my own initiative, thought that I ought to afford him that\nsatisfaction; and, with it he was satisfied. So we must part, good sir.\nIt is my duty to hand over to you forty gulden, three florins, as per\nthe accompanying statement. Here is the money, and here the account,\nwhich you are at liberty to verify. Farewell. From henceforth we are\nstrangers. From you I have never had anything but trouble and\nunpleasantness. I am about to call the landlord, and explain to him\nthat from tomorrow onwards I shall no longer be responsible for your\nhotel expenses. Also I have the honour to remain your obedient servant.\"\n\nI took the money and the account (which was indicted in pencil), and,\nbowing low to the General, said to him very gravely:\n\n\"The matter cannot end here. I regret very much that you should have\nbeen put to unpleasantness at the Baron's hands; but, the fault (pardon\nme) is your own. How came you to answer for me to the Baron? And what\ndid you mean by saying that I formed part of your household? I am\nmerely your family tutor--not a son of yours, nor yet your ward, nor a\nperson of any kind for whose acts you need be responsible. I am a\njudicially competent person, a man of twenty-five years of age, a\nuniversity graduate, a gentleman, and, until I met yourself, a complete\nstranger to you. Only my boundless respect for your merits restrains me\nfrom demanding satisfaction at your hands, as well as a further\nexplanation as to the reasons which have led you to take it upon\nyourself to answer for my conduct.\"\n\nSo struck was he with my words that, spreading out his hands, he turned\nto the Frenchman, and interpreted to him that I had challenged himself\n(the General) to a duel. The Frenchman laughed aloud.\n\n\"Nor do I intend to let the Baron off,\" I continued calmly, but with\nnot a little discomfiture at De Griers' merriment. \"And since you,\nGeneral, have today been so good as to listen to the Baron's\ncomplaints, and to enter into his concerns--since you have made\nyourself a participator in the affair--I have the honour to inform you\nthat, tomorrow morning at the latest, I shall, in my own name, demand\nof the said Baron a formal explanation as to the reasons which have led\nhim to disregard the fact that the matter lies between him and myself\nalone, and to put a slight upon me by referring it to another person,\nas though I were unworthy to answer for my own conduct.\"\n\nThen there happened what I had foreseen. The General on hearing of this\nfurther intended outrage, showed the white feather.\n\n\"What?\" he cried. \"Do you intend to go on with this damned nonsense? Do\nyou not realise the harm that it is doing me? I beg of you not to laugh\nat me, sir--not to laugh at me, for we have police authorities here\nwho, out of respect for my rank, and for that of the Baron...  In\nshort, sir, I swear to you that I will have you arrested, and marched\nout of the place, to prevent any further brawling on your part. Do you\nunderstand what I say?\" He was almost breathless with anger, as well as\nin a terrible fright.\n\n\"General,\" I replied with that calmness which he never could abide,\n\"one cannot arrest a man for brawling until he has brawled. I have not\nso much as begun my explanations to the Baron, and you are altogether\nignorant as to the form and time which my intended procedure is likely\nto assume. I wish but to disabuse the Baron of what is, to me, a\nshameful supposition--namely, that I am under the guardianship of a\nperson who is qualified to exercise control over my free will. It is\nvain for you to disturb and alarm yourself.\"\n\n\"For God's sake, Alexis Ivanovitch, do put an end to this senseless\nscheme of yours!\" he muttered, but with a sudden change from a\ntruculent tone to one of entreaty as he caught me by the hand. \"Do you\nknow what is likely to come of it? Merely further unpleasantness. You\nwill agree with me, I am sure, that at present I ought to move with\nespecial care--yes, with very especial care. You cannot be fully aware\nof how I am situated. When we leave this place I shall be ready to\nreceive you back into my household; but, for the time being I-- Well, I\ncannot tell you all my reasons.\" With that he wound up in a despairing\nvoice: \"O Alexis Ivanovitch, Alexis Ivanovitch!\"\n\nI moved towards the door--begging him to be calm, and promising that\neverything should be done decently and in order; whereafter I departed.\n\nRussians, when abroad, are over-apt to play the poltroon, to watch all\ntheir words, and to wonder what people are thinking of their conduct,\nor whether such and such a thing is 'comme il faut.' In short, they are\nover-apt to cosset themselves, and to lay claim to great importance.\nAlways they prefer the form of behaviour which has once and for all\nbecome accepted and established. This they will follow slavishly\nwhether in hotels, on promenades, at meetings, or when on a journey.\nBut the General had avowed to me that, over and above such\nconsiderations as these, there were circumstances which compelled him\nto \"move with especial care at present\", and that the fact had actually\nmade him poor-spirited and a coward--it had made him altogether change\nhis tone towards me. This fact I took into my calculations, and duly\nnoted it, for, of course, he MIGHT apply to the authorities tomorrow,\nand it behoved me to go carefully.\n\nYet it was not the General but Polina that I wanted to anger. She had\ntreated me with such cruelty, and had got me into such a hole, that I\nfelt a longing to force her to beseech me to stop. Of course, my\ntomfoolery might compromise her; yet certain other feelings and desires\nhad begun to form themselves in my brain. If I was never to rank in her\neyes as anything but a nonentity, it would not greatly matter if I\nfigured as a draggle-tailed cockerel, and the Baron were to give me a\ngood thrashing; but, the fact was that I desired to have the laugh of\nthem all, and to come out myself unscathed. Let people see what they\nWOULD see. Let Polina, for once, have a good fright, and be forced to\nwhistle me to heel again. But, however much she might whistle, she\nshould see that I was at least no draggle-tailed cockerel!\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nI have just received a surprising piece of news. I have just met our\nchambermaid on the stairs, and been informed by her that Maria\nPhilipovna departed today, by the night train, to stay with a cousin at\nCarlsbad. What can that mean? The maid declares that Madame packed her\ntrunks early in the day. Yet how is it that no one else seems to have\nbeen aware of the circumstance? Or is it that I have been the only\nperson to be unaware of it? Also, the maid has just told me that, three\ndays ago, Maria Philipovna had some high words with the General. I\nunderstand, then! Probably the words were concerning Mlle. Blanche.\nCertainly something decisive is approaching.\n\n\n\nVII\n\nIn the morning I sent for the maitre d'hotel, and explained to him\nthat, in future, my bill was to be rendered to me personally. As a\nmatter of fact, my expenses had never been so large as to alarm me, nor\nto lead me to quit the hotel; while, moreover, I still had 160 gulden\nleft to me, and--in them--yes, in them, perhaps, riches awaited me. It\nwas a curious fact, that, though I had not yet won anything at play, I\nnevertheless acted, thought, and felt as though I were sure, before\nlong, to become wealthy--since I could not imagine myself otherwise.\n\nNext, I bethought me, despite the earliness of the hour, of going to\nsee Mr. Astley, who was staying at the Hotel de l'Angleterre (a\nhostelry at no great distance from our own). But suddenly De Griers\nentered my room. This had never before happened, for of late that\ngentleman and I had stood on the most strained and distant of terms--he\nattempting no concealment of his contempt for me (he even made an\nexpress, point of showing it), and I having no reason to desire his\ncompany. In short, I detested him. Consequently, his entry at the\npresent moment the more astounded me. At once I divined that something\nout of the way was on the carpet.\n\nHe entered with marked affability, and began by complimenting me on my\nroom. Then, perceiving that I had my hat in my hands, he inquired\nwhither I was going so early; and, no sooner did he hear that I was\nbound for Mr. Astley's than he stopped, looked grave, and seemed\nplunged in thought.\n\nHe was a true Frenchman insofar as that, though he could be lively and\nengaging when it suited him, he became insufferably dull and wearisome\nas soon as ever the need for being lively and engaging had passed.\nSeldom is a Frenchman NATURALLY civil: he is civil only as though to\norder and of set purpose. Also, if he thinks it incumbent upon him to\nbe fanciful, original, and out of the way, his fancy always assumes a\nfoolish, unnatural vein, for the reason that it is compounded of trite,\nhackneyed forms. In short, the natural Frenchman is a conglomeration of\ncommonplace, petty, everyday positiveness, so that he is the most\ntedious person in the world.--Indeed, I believe that none but\ngreenhorns and excessively Russian people feel an attraction towards\nthe French; for, to any man of sensibility, such a compendium of\noutworn forms--a compendium which is built up of drawing-room manners,\nexpansiveness, and gaiety--becomes at once over-noticeable and\nunbearable.\n\n\"I have come to see you on business,\" De Griers began in a very\noff-hand, yet polite, tone; \"nor will I seek to conceal from you the\nfact that I have come in the capacity of an emissary, of an\nintermediary, from the General. Having small knowledge of the Russian\ntongue, I lost most of what was said last night; but, the General has\nnow explained matters, and I must confess that--\"\n\n\"See here, Monsieur de Griers,\" I interrupted. \"I understand that you\nhave undertaken to act in this affair as an intermediary. Of course I\nam only 'un utchitel,' a tutor, and have never claimed to be an\nintimate of this household, nor to stand on at all familiar terms with\nit. Consequently, I do not know the whole of its circumstances. Yet\npray explain to me this: have you yourself become one of its members,\nseeing that you are beginning to take such a part in everything, and\nare now present as an intermediary?\"\n\nThe Frenchman seemed not over-pleased at my question. It was one which\nwas too outspoken for his taste--and he had no mind to be frank with me.\n\n\"I am connected with the General,\" he said drily, \"partly through\nbusiness affairs, and partly through special circumstances. My\nprincipal has sent me merely to ask you to forego your intentions of\nlast evening. What you contemplate is, I have no doubt, very clever;\nyet he has charged me to represent to you that you have not the\nslightest chance of succeeding in your end, since not only will the\nBaron refuse to receive you, but also he (the Baron) has at his\ndisposal every possible means for obviating further unpleasantness from\nyou. Surely you can see that yourself? What, then, would be the good of\ngoing on with it all? On the other hand, the General promises that at\nthe first favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his\nhousehold, and, in the meantime, will credit you with your salary--with\n'vos appointements.' Surely that will suit you, will it not?\"\n\nVery quietly I replied that he (the Frenchman) was labouring under a\ndelusion; that perhaps, after all, I should not be expelled from the\nBaron's presence, but, on the contrary, be listened to; finally, that I\nshould be glad if Monsieur de Griers would confess that he was now\nvisiting me merely in order to see how far I intended to go in the\naffair.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" cried de Griers. \"Seeing that the General takes such an\ninterest in the matter, is there anything very unnatural in his\ndesiring also to know your plans?\"\n\nAgain I began my explanations, but the Frenchman only fidgeted and\nrolled his head about as he listened with an expression of manifest and\nunconcealed irony on his face. In short, he adopted a supercilious\nattitude. For my own part, I endeavoured to pretend that I took the\naffair very seriously. I declared that, since the Baron had gone and\ncomplained of me to the General, as though I were a mere servant of the\nGeneral's, he had, in the first place, lost me my post, and, in the\nsecond place, treated me like a person to whom, as to one not qualified\nto answer for himself, it was not even worth while to speak. Naturally,\nI said, I felt insulted at this. Yet, comprehending as I did,\ndifferences of years, of social status, and so forth (here I could\nscarcely help smiling), I was not anxious to bring about further scenes\nby going personally to demand or to request satisfaction of the Baron.\nAll that I felt was that I had a right to go in person and beg the\nBaron's and the Baroness's pardon--the more so since, of late, I had\nbeen feeling unwell and unstrung, and had been in a fanciful condition.\nAnd so forth, and so forth. Yet (I continued) the Baron's offensive\nbehaviour to me of yesterday (that is to say, the fact of his referring\nthe matter to the General) as well as his insistence that the General\nshould deprive me of my post, had placed me in such a position that I\ncould not well express my regret to him (the Baron) and to his good\nlady, for the reason that in all probability both he and the Baroness,\nwith the world at large, would imagine that I was doing so merely\nbecause I hoped, by my action, to recover my post. Hence, I found\nmyself forced to request the Baron to express to me HIS OWN regrets, as\nwell as to express them in the most unqualified manner--to say, in\nfact, that he had never had any wish to insult me. After the Baron had\ndone THAT, I should, for my part, at once feel free to express to him,\nwhole-heartedly and without reserve, my own regrets. \"In short,\" I\ndeclared in conclusion, \"my one desire is that the Baron may make it\npossible for me to adopt the latter course.\"\n\n\"Oh fie! What refinements and subtleties!\" exclaimed De Griers.\n\"Besides, what have you to express regret for? Confess, Monsieur,\nMonsieur--pardon me, but I have forgotten your name--confess, I say,\nthat all this is merely a plan to annoy the General? Or perhaps, you\nhave some other and special end in view? Eh?\"\n\n\"In return you must pardon ME, mon cher Marquis, and tell me what you\nhave to do with it.\"\n\n\"The General--\"\n\n\"But what of the General? Last night he said that, for some reason or\nanother, it behoved him to 'move with especial care at present;'\nwherefore, he was feeling nervous. But I did not understand the\nreference.\"\n\n\"Yes, there DO exist special reasons for his doing so,\" assented De\nGriers in a conciliatory tone, yet with rising anger. \"You are\nacquainted with Mlle. de Cominges, are you not?\"\n\n\"Mlle. Blanche, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mlle. Blanche de Cominges. Doubtless you know also that the\nGeneral is in love with this young lady, and may even be about to marry\nher before he leaves here? Imagine, therefore, what any scene or\nscandal would entail upon him!\"\n\n\"I cannot see that the marriage scheme need, be affected by scenes or\nscandals.\"\n\n\"Mais le Baron est si irascible--un caractere prussien, vous savez!\nEnfin il fera une querelle d'Allemand.\"\n\n\"I do not care,\" I replied, \"seeing that I no longer belong to his\nhousehold\" (of set purpose I was trying to talk as senselessly as\npossible). \"But is it quite settled that Mlle. is to marry the General?\nWhat are they waiting for? Why should they conceal such a matter--at\nall events from ourselves, the General's own party?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you. The marriage is not yet a settled affair, for they\nare awaiting news from Russia. The General has business transactions to\narrange.\"\n\n\"Ah! Connected, doubtless, with madame his mother?\"\n\nDe Griers shot at me a glance of hatred.\n\n\"To cut things short,\" he interrupted, \"I have complete confidence in\nyour native politeness, as well as in your tact and good sense. I feel\nsure that you will do what I suggest, even if it is only for the sake\nof this family which has received you as a kinsman into its bosom and\nhas always loved and respected you.\"\n\n\"Be so good as to observe,\" I remarked, \"that the same family has just\nEXPELLED me from its bosom. All that you are saying you are saying but\nfor show; but, when people have just said to you, 'Of course we do not\nwish to turn you out, yet, for the sake of appearance's, you must\nPERMIT yourself to be turned out,' nothing can matter very much.\"\n\n\"Very well, then,\" he said, in a sterner and more arrogant tone.\n\"Seeing that my solicitations have had no effect upon you, it is my\nduty to mention that other measures will be taken. There exist here\npolice, you must remember, and this very day they shall send you\npacking. Que diable! To think of a blanc bec like yourself challenging\na person like the Baron to a duel! Do you suppose that you will be\nALLOWED to do such things? Just try doing them, and see if any one will\nbe afraid of you! The reason why I have asked you to desist is that I\ncan see that your conduct is causing the General annoyance. Do you\nbelieve that the Baron could not tell his lacquey simply to put you out\nof doors?\"\n\n\"Nevertheless I should not GO out of doors,\" I retorted with absolute\ncalm. \"You are labouring under a delusion, Monsieur de Griers. The\nthing will be done in far better trim than you imagine. I was just\nabout to start for Mr. Astley's, to ask him to be my intermediary--in\nother words, my second. He has a strong liking for me, and I do not\nthink that he will refuse. He will go and see the Baron on MY behalf,\nand the Baron will certainly not decline to receive him. Although I am\nonly a tutor--a kind of subaltern, Mr. Astley is known to all men as\nthe nephew of a real English lord, the Lord Piebroch, as well as a lord\nin his own right. Yes, you may be pretty sure that the Baron will be\ncivil to Mr. Astley, and listen to him. Or, should he decline to do so,\nMr. Astley will take the refusal as a personal affront to himself (for\nyou know how persistent the English are?) and thereupon introduce to\nthe Baron a friend of his own (and he has many friends in a good\nposition). That being so, picture to yourself the issue of the\naffair--an affair which will not quite end as you think it will.\"\n\nThis caused the Frenchman to bethink him of playing the coward. \"Really\nthings may be as this fellow says,\" he evidently thought. \"Really he\nMIGHT be able to engineer another scene.\"\n\n\"Once more I beg of you to let the matter drop,\" he continued in a tone\nthat was now entirely conciliatory. \"One would think that it actually\nPLEASED you to have scenes! Indeed, it is a brawl rather than genuine\nsatisfaction that you are seeking. I have said that the affair may\nprove to be diverting, and even clever, and that possibly you may\nattain something by it; yet none the less I tell you\" (he said this\nonly because he saw me rise and reach for my hat) \"that I have come\nhither also to hand you these few words from a certain person. Read\nthem, please, for I must take her back an answer.\"\n\nSo saying, he took from his pocket a small, compact, wafer-sealed note,\nand handed it to me. In Polina's handwriting I read:\n\n\"I hear that you are thinking of going on with this affair. You have\nlost your temper now, and are beginning to play the fool! Certain\ncircumstances, however, I may explain to you later. Pray cease from\nyour folly, and put a check upon yourself. For folly it all is. I have\nneed of you, and, moreover, you have promised to obey me. Remember the\nShlangenberg.  I ask you to be obedient. If necessary, I shall even BID\nyou be obedient.--Your own----POLINA.\n\n\"P.S.--If so be that you still bear a grudge against me for what\nhappened last night, pray forgive me.\"\n\n\nEverything, to my eyes, seemed to change as I read these words. My lips\ngrew pale, and I began to tremble. Meanwhile, the cursed Frenchman was\neyeing me discreetly and askance, as though he wished to avoid\nwitnessing my confusion. It would have been better if he had laughed\noutright.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, \"you can tell Mlle. not to disturb herself. But,\"\nI added sharply, \"I would also ask you why you have been so long in\nhanding me this note? Instead of chattering about trifles, you ought to\nhave delivered me the missive at once--if you have really come\ncommissioned as you say.\"\n\n\"Well, pardon some natural haste on my part, for the situation is so\nstrange. I wished first to gain some personal knowledge of your\nintentions; and, moreover, I did not know the contents of the note, and\nthought that it could be given you at any time.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" I replied. \"So you were ordered to hand me the note\nonly in the last resort, and if you could not otherwise appease me? Is\nit not so? Speak out, Monsieur de Griers.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said he, assuming a look of great forbearance, but gazing at\nme in a meaning way.\n\nI reached for my hat; whereupon he nodded, and went out. Yet on his\nlips I fancied that I could see a mocking smile. How could it have been\notherwise?\n\n\"You and I are to have a reckoning later, Master Frenchman,\" I muttered\nas I descended the stairs. \"Yes, we will measure our strength\ntogether.\" Yet my thoughts were all in confusion, for again something\nseemed to have struck me dizzy. Presently the air revived me a little,\nand, a couple of minutes later, my brain had sufficiently cleared to\nenable two ideas in particular to stand out in it. Firstly, I asked\nmyself, which of the absurd, boyish, and extravagant threats which I\nhad uttered at random last night had made everybody so alarmed?\nSecondly, what was the influence which this Frenchman appeared to\nexercise over Polina? He had but to give the word, and at once she did\nas he desired--at once she wrote me a note to beg of me to forbear! Of\ncourse, the relations between the pair had, from the first, been a\nriddle to me--they had been so ever since I had first made their\nacquaintance.  But of late I had remarked in her a strong aversion for,\neven a contempt for--him, while, for his part, he had scarcely even\nlooked at her, but had behaved towards her always in the most churlish\nfashion. Yes, I had noted that. Also, Polina herself had mentioned to\nme her dislike for him, and delivered herself of some remarkable\nconfessions on the subject. Hence, he must have got her into his power\nsomehow--somehow he must be holding her as in a vice.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nAll at once, on the Promenade, as it was called--that is to say, in the\nChestnut Avenue--I came face to face with my Englishman.\n\n\"I was just coming to see you,\" he said; \"and you appear to be out on a\nsimilar errand. So you have parted with your employers?\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" I asked in astonishment. \"Is EVERY ONE aware of\nthe fact?\"\n\n\"By no means. Not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment.\nIndeed, I have never heard any one speak of it.\"\n\n\"Then how come you to know it?\"\n\n\"Because I have had occasion to do so. Whither are you bound? I like\nyou, and was therefore coming to pay you a visit.\"\n\n\"What a splendid fellow you are, Mr. Astley!\" I cried, though still\nwondering how he had come by his knowledge. \"And since I have not yet\nhad my coffee, and you have, in all probability, scarcely tasted yours,\nlet us adjourn to the Casino Cafe, where we can sit and smoke and have\na talk.\"\n\nThe cafe in question was only a hundred paces away; so, when coffee had\nbeen brought, we seated ourselves, and I lit a cigarette. Astley was no\nsmoker, but, taking a seat by my side, he prepared himself to listen.\n\n\"I do not intend to go away,\" was my first remark. \"I intend, on the\ncontrary, to remain here.\"\n\n\"That I never doubted,\" he answered good-humouredly.\n\nIt is a curious fact that, on my way to see him, I had never even\nthought of telling him of my love for Polina. In fact, I had purposely\nmeant to avoid any mention of the subject. Nor, during our stay in the\nplace, had I ever made aught but the scantiest reference to it. You\nsee, not only was Astley a man of great reserve, but also from the\nfirst I had perceived that Polina had made a great impression upon him,\nalthough he never spoke of her. But now, strangely enough, he had no\nsooner seated himself and bent his steely gaze upon me, than, for some\nreason or another, I felt moved to tell him everything--to speak to him\nof my love in all its phases. For an hour and a half did I discourse on\nthe subject, and found it a pleasure to do so, even though this was the\nfirst occasion on which I had referred to the matter. Indeed, when, at\ncertain moments, I perceived that my more ardent passages confused him,\nI purposely increased my ardour of narration. Yet one thing I regret:\nand that is that I made references to the Frenchman which were a little\nover-personal.\n\nMr. Astley sat without moving as he listened to me. Not a word nor a\nsound of any kind did he utter as he stared into my eyes. Suddenly,\nhowever, on my mentioning the Frenchman, he interrupted me, and\ninquired sternly whether I did right to speak of an extraneous matter\n(he had always been a strange man in his mode of propounding questions).\n\n\"No, I fear not,\" I replied.\n\n\"And concerning this Marquis and Mlle. Polina you know nothing beyond\nsurmise?\"\n\nAgain I was surprised that such a categorical question should come from\nsuch a reserved individual.\n\n\"No, I know nothing FOR CERTAIN about them\" was my reply. \"No--nothing.\"\n\n\"Then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me, or even to\nimagine things about them.\"\n\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" I interrupted in some astonishment. \"I admit\nthat. Yet that is not the question.\" Whereupon I related to him in\ndetail the incident of two days ago. I spoke of Polina's outburst, of\nmy encounter with the Baron, of my dismissal, of the General's\nextraordinary pusillanimity, and of the call which De Griers had that\nmorning paid me. In conclusion, I showed Astley the note which I had\nlately received.\n\n\"What do you make of it?\" I asked. \"When I met you I was just coming to\nask you your opinion. For myself, I could have killed this Frenchman,\nand am not sure that I shall not do so even yet.\"\n\n\"I feel the same about it,\" said Mr. Astley. \"As for Mlle.\nPolina--well, you yourself know that, if necessity drives, one enters\ninto relation with people whom one simply detests. Even between this\ncouple there may be something which, though unknown to you, depends\nupon extraneous circumstances. For, my own part, I think that you may\nreassure yourself--or at all events partially. And as for Mlle.\nPolina's proceedings of two days ago, they were, of course, strange;\nnot because she can have meant to get rid of you, or to earn for you a\nthrashing from the Baron's cudgel (which for some curious reason, he\ndid not use, although he had it ready in his hands), but because such\nproceedings on the part of such--well, of such a refined lady as Mlle.\nPolina are, to say the least of it, unbecoming. But she cannot have\nguessed that you would carry out her absurd wish to the letter?\"\n\n\"Do you know what?\" suddenly I cried as I fixed Mr. Astley with my\ngaze. \"I believe that you have already heard the story from some\none--very possibly from Mlle. Polina herself?\"\n\nIn return he gave me an astonished stare.\n\n\"Your eyes look very fiery,\" he said with a return of his former calm,\n\"and in them I can read suspicion. Now, you have no right whatever to\nbe suspicious. It is not a right which I can for a moment recognise,\nand I absolutely refuse to answer your questions.\"\n\n\"Enough! You need say no more,\" I cried with a strange emotion at my\nheart, yet not altogether understanding what had aroused that emotion\nin my breast. Indeed, when, where, and how could Polina have chosen\nAstley to be one of her confidants? Of late I had come rather to\noverlook him in this connection, even though Polina had always been a\nriddle to me--so much so that now, when I had just permitted myself to\ntell my friend of my infatuation in all its aspects, I had found myself\nstruck, during the very telling, with the fact that in my relations\nwith her I could specify nothing that was explicit, nothing that was\npositive. On the contrary, my relations had been purely fantastic,\nstrange, and unreal; they had been unlike anything else that I could\nthink of.\n\n\"Very well, very well,\" I replied with a warmth equal to Astley's own.\n\"Then I stand confounded, and have no further opinions to offer. But\nyou are a good fellow, and I am glad to know what you think about it\nall, even though I do not need your advice.\"\n\nThen, after a pause, I resumed:\n\n\"For instance, what reason should you assign for the General taking\nfright in this way? Why should my stupid clowning have led the world to\nelevate it into a serious incident? Even De Griers has found it\nnecessary to put in his oar (and he only interferes on the most\nimportant occasions), and to visit me, and to address to me the most\nearnest supplications. Yes, HE, De Griers, has actually been playing\nthe suppliant to ME! And, mark you, although he came to me as early as\nnine o'clock, he had ready-prepared in his hand Mlle. Polina's note.\nWhen, I would ask, was that note written? Mlle. Polina must have been\naroused from sleep for the express purpose of writing it. At all events\nthe circumstance shows that she is an absolute slave to the Frenchman,\nsince she actually begs my pardon in the note--actually begs my pardon!\nYet what is her personal concern in the matter? Why is she interested\nin it at all? Why, too, is the whole party so afraid of this precious\nBaron? And what sort of a business do you call it for the General to be\ngoing to marry Mlle. Blanche de Cominges? He told me last night that,\nbecause of the circumstance, he must 'move with especial care at\npresent.' What is your opinion of it all? Your look convinces me that\nyou know more about it than I do.\"\n\nMr. Astley smiled and nodded.\n\n\"Yes, I think I DO know more about it than you do,\" he assented. \"The\naffair centres around this Mlle. Blanche. Of that I feel certain.\"\n\n\"And what of Mlle. Blanche?\" I cried impatiently (for in me there had\ndawned a sudden hope that this would enable me to discover something\nabout Polina).\n\n\"Well, my belief is that at the present moment Mlle. Blanche has, in\nvery truth, a special reason for wishing to avoid any trouble with the\nBaron and the Baroness.  It might lead not only to some unpleasantness,\nbut even to a scandal.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\"\n\n\"Also I may tell you that Mlle. Blanche has been in Roulettenberg\nbefore, for she was staying here three seasons ago. I myself was in the\nplace at the time, and in those days Mlle. Blanche was not known as\nMlle. de Cominges, nor was her mother, the Widow de Cominges, even in\nexistence. In any case no one ever mentioned the latter. De Griers,\ntoo, had not materialised, and I am convinced that not only do the\nparties stand in no relation to one another, but also they have not\nlong enjoyed one another's acquaintance. Likewise, the Marquisate de\nGriers is of recent creation. Of that I have reason to be sure, owing\nto a certain circumstance. Even the name De Griers itself may be taken\nto be a new invention, seeing that I have a friend who once met the\nsaid 'Marquis' under a different name altogether.\"\n\n\"Yet he possesses a good circle of friends?\"\n\n\"Possibly. Mlle. Blanche also may possess that. Yet it is not three\nyears since she received from the local police, at the instance of the\nBaroness, an invitation to leave the town. And she left it.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Well, I must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an\nItalian--a prince of some sort, a man who bore an historic name\n(Barberini or something of the kind). The fellow was simply a mass of\nrings and diamonds--real diamonds, too--and the couple used to drive\nout in a marvellous carriage. At first Mlle. Blanche played 'trente et\nquarante' with fair success, but, later, her luck took a marked change\nfor the worse. I distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost\nan enormous sum. But worse was to ensue, for one fine morning her\nprince disappeared--horses, carriage, and all. Also, the hotel bill\nwhich he left unpaid was enormous. Upon this Mlle. Zelma (the name\nwhich she assumed after figuring as Madame Barberini) was in despair.\nShe shrieked and howled all over the hotel, and even tore her clothes\nin her frenzy. In the hotel there was staying also a Polish count (you\nmust know that ALL travelling Poles are counts!), and the spectacle of\nMlle. Zelma tearing her clothes and, catlike, scratching her face with\nher beautiful, scented nails produced upon him a strong impression. So\nthe pair had a talk together, and, by luncheon time, she was consoled.\nIndeed, that evening the couple entered the Casino arm-in-arm--Mlle.\nZelma laughing loudly, according to her custom, and showing even more\nexpansiveness in her manners than she had before shown. For instance,\nshe thrust her way into the file of women roulette-players in the exact\nfashion of those ladies who, to clear a space for themselves at the\ntables, push their fellow-players roughly aside. Doubtless you have\nnoticed them?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, they are not worth noticing. To the annoyance of the decent\npublic they are allowed to remain here--at all events such of them as\ndaily change 4000 franc notes at the tables (though, as soon as ever\nthese women cease to do so, they receive an invitation to depart).\nHowever, Mlle. Zelma continued to change notes of this kind, but her\nplay grew more and more unsuccessful, despite the fact that such\nladies' luck is frequently good, for they have a surprising amount of\ncash at their disposal. Suddenly, the Count too disappeared, even as\nthe Prince had done, and that same evening Mlle. Zelma was forced to\nappear in the Casino alone. On this occasion no one offered her a\ngreeting. Two days later she had come to the end of her resources;\nwhereupon, after staking and losing her last louis d'or she chanced to\nlook around her, and saw standing by her side the Baron Burmergelm, who\nhad been eyeing her with fixed disapproval. To his distaste, however,\nMlle. paid no attention, but, turning to him with her well-known smile,\nrequested him to stake, on her behalf, ten louis on the red. Later that\nevening a complaint from the Baroness led the authorities to request\nMlle. not to re-enter the Casino. If you feel in any way surprised that\nI should know these petty and unedifying details, the reason is that I\nhad them from a relative of mine who, later that evening, drove Mlle.\nZelma in his carriage from Roulettenberg to Spa. Now, mark you, Mlle.\nwants to become Madame General, in order that, in future, she may be\nspared the receipt of such invitations from Casino authorities as she\nreceived three years ago. At present she is not playing; but that is\nonly because, according to the signs, she is lending money to other\nplayers. Yes, that is a much more paying game. I even suspect that the\nunfortunate General is himself in her debt, as well as, perhaps, also\nDe Griers. Or, it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership\nwith her. Consequently you yourself will see that, until the marriage\nshall have been consummated, Mlle. would scarcely like to have the\nattention of the Baron and the Baroness drawn to herself. In short, to\nany one in her position, a scandal would be most detrimental. You form\na member of the menage of these people; wherefore, any act of yours\nmight cause such a scandal--and the more so since daily she appears in\npublic arm in arm with the General or with Mlle. Polina. NOW do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"No, I do not!\" I shouted as I banged my fist down upon the\ntable--banged it with such violence that a frightened waiter came\nrunning towards us. \"Tell me, Mr. Astley, why, if you knew this history\nall along, and, consequently, always knew who this Mlle. Blanche is,\nyou never warned either myself or the General, nor, most of all, Mlle.\nPolina\" (who is accustomed to appear in the Casino--in public\neverywhere with Mlle. Blanche). \"How could you do it?\"\n\n\"It would have done no good to warn you,\" he replied quietly, \"for the\nreason that you could have effected nothing. Against what was I to warn\nyou? As likely as not, the General knows more about Mlle. Blanche even\nthan I do; yet the unhappy man still walks about with her and Mlle.\nPolina. Only yesterday I saw this Frenchwoman riding, splendidly\nmounted, with De Griers, while the General was careering in their wake\non a roan horse. He had said, that morning, that his legs were hurting\nhim, yet his riding-seat was easy enough. As he passed I looked at him,\nand the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever.\nHowever, it is no affair of mine, for I have only recently had the\nhappiness to make Mlle. Polina's acquaintance. Also\"--he added this as\nan afterthought--\"I have already told you that I do not recognise your\nright to ask me certain questions, however sincere be my liking for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" I said, rising. \"To me it is as clear as day that Mlle.\nPolina knows all about this Mlle. Blanche, but cannot bring herself to\npart with her Frenchman; wherefore, she consents also to be seen in\npublic with Mlle. Blanche. You may be sure that nothing else would ever\nhave induced her either to walk about with this Frenchwoman or to send\nme a note not to touch the Baron. Yes, it is THERE that the influence\nlies before which everything in the world must bow! Yet she herself it\nwas who launched me at the Baron! The devil take it, but I was left no\nchoice in the matter.\"\n\n\"You forget, in the first place, that this Mlle. de Cominges is the\nGeneral's inamorata, and, in the second place, that Mlle. Polina, the\nGeneral's step-daughter, has a younger brother and sister who, though\nthey are the General's own children, are completely neglected by this\nmadman, and robbed as well.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; that is so. For me to go and desert the children now would\nmean their total abandonment; whereas, if I remain, I should be able to\ndefend their interests, and, perhaps, to save a moiety of their\nproperty. Yes, yes; that is quite true. And yet, and yet--Oh, I can\nwell understand why they are all so interested in the General's mother!\"\n\n\"In whom?\" asked Mr. Astley.\n\n\"In the old woman of Moscow who declines to die, yet concerning whom\nthey are for ever expecting telegrams to notify the fact of her death.\"\n\n\"Ah, then of course their interests centre around her. It is a question\nof succession. Let that but be settled, and the General will marry,\nMlle. Polina will be set free, and De Griers--\"\n\n\"Yes, and De Griers?\"\n\n\"Will be repaid his money, which is what he is now waiting for.\"\n\n\"What? You think that he is waiting for that?\"\n\n\"I know of nothing else,\" asserted Mr. Astley doggedly.\n\n\"But, I do, I do!\" I shouted in my fury. \"He is waiting also for the\nold woman's will, for the reason that it awards Mlle. Polina a dowry.\nAs soon as ever the money is received, she will throw herself upon the\nFrenchman's neck. All women are like that. Even the proudest of them\nbecome abject slaves where marriage is concerned. What Polina is good\nfor is to fall head over ears in love. That is MY opinion. Look at\nher--especially when she is sitting alone, and plunged in thought. All\nthis was pre-ordained and foretold, and is accursed. Polina could\nperpetrate any mad act. She--she--But who called me by name?\" I broke\noff. \"Who is shouting for me? I heard some one calling in Russian,\n'Alexis Ivanovitch!' It was a woman's voice. Listen!\"\n\nAt the moment, we were approaching my hotel. We had left the cafe long\nago, without even noticing that we had done so.\n\n\"Yes, I DID hear a woman's voice calling, but whose I do not know. The\nsomeone was calling you in Russian. Ah! NOW I can see whence the cries\ncome. They come from that lady there--the one who is sitting on the\nsettee, the one who has just been escorted to the verandah by a crowd\nof lacqueys. Behind her see that pile of luggage! She must have arrived\nby train.\"\n\n\"But why should she be calling ME? Hear her calling again! See! She is\nbeckoning to us!\"\n\n\"Yes, so she is,\" assented Mr. Astley.\n\n\"Alexis Ivanovitch, Alexis Ivanovitch! Good heavens, what a stupid\nfellow!\" came in a despairing wail from the verandah.\n\nWe had almost reached the portico, and I was just setting foot upon the\nspace before it, when my hands fell to my sides in limp astonishment,\nand my feet glued themselves to the pavement!\n\n\n\nIX\n\nFor on the topmost tier of the hotel verandah, after being carried up\nthe steps in an armchair amid a bevy of footmen, maid-servants, and\nother menials of the hotel, headed by the landlord (that functionary\nhad actually run out to meet a visitor who arrived with so much stir\nand din, attended by her own retinue, and accompanied by so great a\npile of trunks and portmanteaux)--on the topmost tier of the verandah,\nI say, there was sitting--THE GRANDMOTHER! Yes, it was she--rich, and\nimposing, and seventy-five years of age--Antonida Vassilievna\nTarassevitcha, landowner and grande dame of Moscow--the \"La Baboulenka\"\nwho had caused so many telegrams to be sent off and received--who had\nbeen dying, yet not dying--who had, in her own person, descended upon\nus even as snow might fall from the clouds! Though unable to walk, she\nhad arrived borne aloft in an armchair (her mode of conveyance for the\nlast five years), as brisk, aggressive, self-satisfied, bolt-upright,\nloudly imperious, and generally abusive as ever. In fact, she looked\nexactly as she had on the only two occasions when I had seen her since\nmy appointment to the General's household.  Naturally enough, I stood\npetrified with astonishment. She had sighted me a hundred paces off!\nEven while she was being carried along in her chair she had recognised\nme, and called me by name and surname (which, as usual, after hearing\nonce, she had remembered ever afterwards).\n\n\"And this is the woman whom they had thought to see in her grave after\nmaking her will!\" I thought to myself. \"Yet she will outlive us, and\nevery one else in the hotel. Good Lord! what is going to become of us\nnow? What on earth is to happen to the General? She will turn the place\nupside down!\"\n\n\"My good sir,\" the old woman continued in a stentorian voice, \"what are\nyou standing THERE for, with your eyes almost falling out of your head?\nCannot you come and say how-do-you-do? Are you too proud to shake\nhands? Or do you not recognise me? Here, Potapitch!\" she cried to an\nold servant who, dressed in a frock coat and white waistcoat, had a\nbald, red head (he was the chamberlain who always accompanied her on\nher journeys). \"Just think! Alexis Ivanovitch does not recognise me!\nThey have buried me for good and all! Yes, and after sending hosts of\ntelegrams to know if I were dead or not! Yes, yes, I have heard the\nwhole story. I am very much alive, though, as you may see.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Antonida Vassilievna,\" I replied good humouredly as I\nrecovered my presence of mind. \"I have no reason to wish you ill. I am\nmerely rather astonished to see you. Why should I not be so, seeing how\nunexpected--\"\n\n\"WHY should you be astonished? I just got into my chair, and came.\nThings are quiet enough in the train, for there is no one there to\nchatter. Have you been out for a walk?\"\n\n\"Yes. I have just been to the Casino.\"\n\n\"Oh? Well, it is quite nice here,\" she went on as she looked about her.\n\"The place seems comfortable, and all the trees are out. I like it very\nwell. Are your people at home? Is the General, for instance, indoors?\"\n\n\"Yes; and probably all of them.\"\n\n\"Do they observe the convenances, and keep up appearances? Such things\nalways give one tone. I have heard that they are keeping a carriage,\neven as Russian gentlefolks ought to do. When abroad, our Russian\npeople always cut a dash. Is Prascovia here too?\"\n\n\"Yes. Polina Alexandrovna is here.\"\n\n\"And the Frenchwoman? However, I will go and look for them myself. Tell\nme the nearest way to their rooms. Do you like being here?\"\n\n\"Yes, I thank you, Antonida Vassilievna.\"\n\n\"And you, Potapitch, you go and tell that fool of a landlord to reserve\nme a suitable suite of rooms. They must be handsomely decorated, and\nnot too high up. Have my luggage taken up to them. But what are you\ntumbling over yourselves for? Why are you all tearing about? What\nscullions these fellows are!--Who is that with you?\" she added to\nmyself.\n\n\"A Mr. Astley,\" I replied.\n\n\"And who is Mr. Astley?\"\n\n\"A fellow-traveller, and my very good friend, as well as an\nacquaintance of the General's.\"\n\n\"Oh, an Englishman? Then that is why he stared at me without even\nopening his lips. However, I like Englishmen. Now, take me upstairs,\ndirect to their rooms. Where are they lodging?\"\n\nMadame was lifted up in her chair by the lacqueys, and I preceded her\nup the grand staircase. Our progress was exceedingly effective, for\neveryone whom we met stopped to stare at the cortege. It happened that\nthe hotel had the reputation of being the best, the most expensive, and\nthe most aristocratic in all the spa, and at every turn on the\nstaircase or in the corridors we encountered fine ladies and\nimportant-looking Englishmen--more than one of whom hastened downstairs\nto inquire of the awestruck landlord who the newcomer was. To all such\nquestions he returned the same answer--namely, that the old lady was an\ninfluential foreigner, a Russian, a Countess, and a grande dame, and\nthat she had taken the suite which, during the previous week, had been\ntenanted by the Grande Duchesse de N.\n\nMeanwhile the cause of the sensation--the Grandmother--was being borne\naloft in her armchair. Every person whom she met she scanned with an\ninquisitive eye, after first of all interrogating me about him or her\nat the top of her voice. She was stout of figure, and, though she could\nnot leave her chair, one felt, the moment that one first looked at her,\nthat she was also tall of stature. Her back was as straight as a board,\nand never did she lean back in her seat. Also, her large grey head,\nwith its keen, rugged features, remained always erect as she glanced\nabout her in an imperious, challenging sort of way, with looks and\ngestures that clearly were unstudied. Though she had reached her\nseventy-sixth year, her face was still fresh, and her teeth had not\ndecayed. Lastly, she was dressed in a black silk gown and white mobcap.\n\n\"She interests me tremendously,\" whispered Mr. Astley as, still\nsmoking, he walked by my side. Meanwhile I was reflecting that probably\nthe old lady knew all about the telegrams, and even about De Griers,\nthough little or nothing about Mlle. Blanche. I said as much to Mr.\nAstley.\n\nBut what a frail creature is man! No sooner was my first surprise\nabated than I found myself rejoicing in the shock which we were about\nto administer to the General. So much did the thought inspire me that I\nmarched ahead in the gayest of fashions.\n\nOur party was lodging on the third floor. Without knocking at the door,\nor in any way announcing our presence, I threw open the portals, and\nthe Grandmother was borne through them in triumph. As though of set\npurpose, the whole party chanced at that moment to be assembled in the\nGeneral's study. The time was eleven o'clock, and it seemed that an\nouting of some sort (at which a portion of the party were to drive in\ncarriages, and others to ride on horseback, accompanied by one or two\nextraneous acquaintances) was being planned. The General was present,\nand also Polina, the children, the latter's nurses, De Griers, Mlle.\nBlanche (attired in a riding-habit), her mother, the young Prince, and\na learned German whom I beheld for the first time. Into the midst of\nthis assembly the lacqueys conveyed Madame in her chair, and set her\ndown within three paces of the General!\n\nGood heavens! Never shall I forget the spectacle which ensued! Just\nbefore our entry, the General had been holding forth to the company,\nwith De Griers in support of him. I may also mention that, for the last\ntwo or three days, Mlle. Blanche and De Griers had been making a great\ndeal of the young Prince, under the very nose of the poor General. In\nshort, the company, though decorous and conventional, was in a gay,\nfamiliar mood. But no sooner did the Grandmother appear than the\nGeneral stopped dead in the middle of a word, and, with jaw dropping,\nstared hard at the old lady--his eyes almost starting out of his head,\nand his expression as spellbound as though he had just seen a basilisk.\nIn return, the Grandmother stared at him silently and without\nmoving--though with a look of mingled challenge, triumph, and ridicule\nin her eyes. For ten seconds did the pair remain thus eyeing one\nanother, amid the profound silence of the company; and even De Griers\nsat petrified--an extraordinary look of uneasiness dawning on his face.\nAs for Mlle. Blanche, she too stared wildly at the Grandmother, with\neyebrows raised and her lips parted--while the Prince and the German\nsavant contemplated the tableau in profound amazement. Only Polina\nlooked anything but perplexed or surprised. Presently, however, she too\nturned as white as a sheet, and then reddened to her temples. Truly the\nGrandmother's arrival seemed to be a catastrophe for everybody! For my\nown part, I stood looking from the Grandmother to the company, and back\nagain, while Mr. Astley, as usual, remained in the background, and\ngazed calmly and decorously at the scene.\n\n\"Well, here I am--and instead of a telegram, too!\" the Grandmother at\nlast ejaculated, to dissipate the silence. \"What? You were not\nexpecting me?\"\n\n\"Antonida Vassilievna! O my dearest mother! But how on earth did you,\ndid you--?\" The mutterings of the unhappy General died away.\n\nI verily believe that if the Grandmother had held her tongue a few\nseconds longer she would have had a stroke.\n\n\"How on earth did I WHAT?\" she exclaimed. \"Why, I just got into the\ntrain and came here. What else is the railway meant for? But you\nthought that I had turned up my toes and left my property to the lot of\nyou. Oh, I know ALL about the telegrams which you have been\ndispatching. They must have cost you a pretty sum, I should think, for\ntelegrams are not sent from abroad for nothing. Well, I picked up my\nheels, and came here. Who is this Frenchman? Monsieur de Griers, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Oui, madame,\" assented De Griers. \"Et, croyez, je suis si enchante!\nVotre sante--c'est un miracle vous voir ici. Une surprise charmante!\"\n\n\"Just so. 'Charmante!' I happen to know you as a mountebank, and\ntherefore trust you no more than THIS.\" She indicated her little\nfinger. \"And who is THAT?\" she went on, turning towards Mlle. Blanche.\nEvidently the Frenchwoman looked so becoming in her riding-habit, with\nher whip in her hand, that she had made an impression upon the old\nlady. \"Who is that woman there?\"\n\n\"Mlle. de Cominges,\" I said. \"And this is her mother, Madame de\nCominges. They also are staying in the hotel.\"\n\n\"Is the daughter married?\" asked the old lady, without the least\nsemblance of ceremony.\n\n\"No,\" I replied as respectfully as possible, but under my breath.\n\n\"Is she good company?\"\n\nI failed to understand the question.\n\n\"I mean, is she or is she not a bore? Can she speak Russian? When this\nDe Griers was in Moscow he soon learnt to make himself understood.\"\n\nI explained to the old lady that Mlle. Blanche had never visited Russia.\n\n\"Bonjour, then,\" said Madame, with sudden brusquerie.\n\n\"Bonjour, madame,\" replied Mlle. Blanche with an elegant, ceremonious\nbow as, under cover of an unwonted modesty, she endeavoured to express,\nboth in face and figure, her extreme surprise at such strange behaviour\non the part of the Grandmother.\n\n\"How the woman sticks out her eyes at me! How she mows and minces!\" was\nthe Grandmother's comment. Then she turned suddenly to the General, and\ncontinued: \"I have taken up my abode here, so am going to be your\nnext-door neighbour. Are you glad to hear that, or are you not?\"\n\n\"My dear mother, believe me when I say that I am sincerely delighted,\"\nreturned the General, who had now, to a certain extent, recovered his\nsenses; and inasmuch as, when occasion arose, he could speak with\nfluency, gravity, and a certain effect, he set himself to be expansive\nin his remarks, and went on: \"We have been so dismayed and upset by the\nnews of your indisposition! We had received such hopeless telegrams\nabout you! Then suddenly--\"\n\n\"Fibs, fibs!\" interrupted the Grandmother.\n\n\"How on earth, too, did you come to decide upon the journey?\" continued\nthe General, with raised voice as he hurried to overlook the old lady's\nlast remark. \"Surely, at your age, and in your present state of health,\nthe thing is so unexpected that our surprise is at least intelligible.\nHowever, I am glad to see you (as indeed, are we all\"--he said this\nwith a dignified, yet conciliatory, smile), \"and will use my best\nendeavours to render your stay here as pleasant as possible.\"\n\n\"Enough! All this is empty chatter. You are talking the usual nonsense.\nI shall know quite well how to spend my time. How did I come to\nundertake the journey, you ask? Well, is there anything so very\nsurprising about it? It was done quite simply. What is every one going\ninto ecstasies about?--How do you do, Prascovia? What are YOU doing\nhere?\"\n\n\"And how are YOU, Grandmother?\" replied Polina, as she approached the\nold lady. \"Were you long on the journey?\"\n\n\"The most sensible question that I have yet been asked! Well, you shall\nhear for yourself how it all happened. I lay and lay, and was doctored\nand doctored, until at last I drove the physicians from me, and called\nin an apothecary from Nicolai who had cured an old woman of a malady\nsimilar to my own--cured her merely with a little hayseed. Well, he did\nme a great deal of good, for on the third day I broke into a sweat, and\nwas able to leave my bed. Then my German doctors held another\nconsultation, put on their spectacles, and told me that if I would go\nabroad, and take a course of the waters, the indisposition would\nfinally pass away. 'Why should it not?' I thought to myself. So I had\ngot things ready, and on the following day, a Friday, set out for here.\nI occupied a special compartment in the train, and where ever I had to\nchange I found at the station bearers who were ready to carry me for a\nfew coppers. You have nice quarters here,\" she went on as she glanced\naround the room. \"But where on earth did you get the money for them, my\ngood sir? I thought that everything of yours had been mortgaged? This\nFrenchman alone must be your creditor for a good deal. Oh, I know all\nabout it, all about it.\"\n\n\"I-I am surprised at you, my dearest mother,\" said the General in some\nconfusion. \"I-I am greatly surprised. But I do not need any extraneous\ncontrol of my finances. Moreover, my expenses do not exceed my income,\nand we--\"\n\n\"They do not exceed it? Fie! Why, you are robbing your children of\ntheir last kopeck--you, their guardian!\"\n\n\"After this,\" said the General, completely taken aback, \"--after what\nyou have just said, I do not know whether--\"\n\n\"You do not know what? By heavens, are you never going to drop that\nroulette of yours? Are you going to whistle all your property away?\"\n\nThis made such an impression upon the General that he almost choked\nwith fury.\n\n\"Roulette, indeed? I play roulette? Really, in view of my\nposition--Recollect what you are saying, my dearest mother. You must\nstill be unwell.\"\n\n\"Rubbish, rubbish!\" she retorted. \"The truth is that you CANNOT be got\naway from that roulette. You are simply telling lies. This very day I\nmean to go and see for myself what roulette is like. Prascovia, tell me\nwhat there is to be seen here; and do you, Alexis Ivanovitch, show me\neverything; and do you, Potapitch, make me a list of excursions. What\nIS there to be seen?\" again she inquired of Polina.\n\n\"There is a ruined castle, and the Shlangenberg.\"\n\n\"The Shlangenberg? What is it? A forest?\"\n\n\"No, a mountain on the summit of which there is a place fenced off.\nFrom it you can get a most beautiful view.\"\n\n\"Could a chair be carried up that mountain of yours?\"\n\n\"Doubtless we could find bearers for the purpose,\" I interposed.\n\nAt this moment Theodosia, the nursemaid, approached the old lady with\nthe General's children.\n\n\"No, I DON'T want to see them,\" said the Grandmother. \"I hate kissing\nchildren, for their noses are always wet. How are you getting on,\nTheodosia?\"\n\n\"I am very well, thank you, Madame,\" replied the nursemaid. \"And how is\nyour ladyship? We have been feeling so anxious about you!\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, you simple soul--But who are those other guests?\" the old\nlady continued, turning again to Polina. \"For instance, who is that old\nrascal in the spectacles?\"\n\n\"Prince Nilski, Grandmamma,\" whispered Polina.\n\n\"Oh, a Russian? Why, I had no idea that he could understand me! Surely\nhe did not hear what I said? As for Mr. Astley, I have seen him\nalready, and I see that he is here again. How do you do?\" she added to\nthe gentleman in question.\n\nMr. Astley bowed in silence.\n\n\"Have you NOTHING to say to me?\" the old lady went on. \"Say something,\nfor goodness' sake! Translate to him, Polina.\"\n\nPolina did so.\n\n\"I have only to say,\" replied Mr. Astley gravely, but also with\nalacrity, \"that I am indeed glad to see you in such good health.\" This\nwas interpreted to the Grandmother, and she seemed much gratified.\n\n\"How well English people know how to answer one!\" she remarked. \"That\nis why I like them so much better than French. Come here,\" she added to\nMr. Astley. \"I will try not to bore you too much. Polina, translate to\nhim that I am staying in rooms on a lower floor. Yes, on a lower\nfloor,\" she repeated to Astley, pointing downwards with her finger.\n\nAstley looked pleased at receiving the invitation.\n\nNext, the old lady scanned Polina, from head to foot with minute\nattention.\n\n\"I could almost have liked you, Prascovia,\" suddenly she remarked, \"for\nyou are a nice girl--the best of the lot. You have some character about\nyou. I too have character. Turn round. Surely that is not false hair\nthat you are wearing?\"\n\n\"No, Grandmamma. It is my own.\"\n\n\"Well, well. I do not like the stupid fashions of today. You are very\ngood looking. I should have fallen in love with you if I had been a\nman. Why do you not get married? It is time now that I was going. I\nwant to walk, yet I always have to ride. Are you still in a bad\ntemper?\" she added to the General.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" rejoined the now mollified General.\n\n\"I quite understand that at your time of life--\"\n\n\"Cette vieille est tombee en enfance,\" De Griers whispered to me.\n\n\"But I want to look round a little,\" the old lady added to the General.\nWill you lend me Alexis Ivanovitch for the purpose?\n\n\"As much as you like. But I myself--yes, and Polina and Monsieur de\nGriers too--we all of us hope to have the pleasure of escorting you.\"\n\n\"Mais, madame, cela sera un plaisir,\" De Griers commented with a\nbewitching smile.\n\n\"'Plaisir' indeed! Why, I look upon you as a perfect fool, monsieur.\"\nThen she remarked to the General: \"I am not going to let you have any\nof my money. I must be off to my rooms now, to see what they are like.\nAfterwards we will look round a little. Lift me up.\"\n\nAgain the Grandmother was borne aloft and carried down the staircase\namid a perfect bevy of followers--the General walking as though he had\nbeen hit over the head with a cudgel, and De Griers seeming to be\nplunged in thought. Endeavouring to be left behind, Mlle. Blanche next\nthought better of it, and followed the rest, with the Prince in her\nwake. Only the German savant and Madame de Cominges did not leave the\nGeneral's apartments.\n\n\n\nX\n\nAt spas--and, probably, all over Europe--hotel landlords and managers\nare guided in their allotment of rooms to visitors, not so much by the\nwishes and requirements of those visitors, as by their personal\nestimate of the same. It may also be said that these landlords and\nmanagers seldom make a mistake. To the Grandmother, however, our\nlandlord, for some reason or another, allotted such a sumptuous suite\nthat he fairly overreached himself; for he assigned her a suite\nconsisting of four magnificently appointed rooms, with bathroom,\nservants' quarters, a separate room for her maid, and so on. In fact,\nduring the previous week the suite had been occupied by no less a\npersonage than a Grand Duchess: which circumstance was duly explained\nto the new occupant, as an excuse for raising the price of these\napartments. The Grandmother had herself carried--or, rather,\nwheeled--through each room in turn, in order that she might subject the\nwhole to a close and attentive scrutiny; while the landlord--an\nelderly, bald-headed man--walked respectfully by her side.\n\nWhat every one took the Grandmother to be I do not know, but it\nappeared, at least, that she was accounted a person not only of great\nimportance, but also, and still more, of great wealth; and without\ndelay they entered her in the hotel register as \"Madame la Generale,\nPrincesse de Tarassevitcheva,\" although she had never been a princess\nin her life. Her retinue, her reserved compartment in the train, her\npile of unnecessary trunks, portmanteaux, and strong-boxes, all helped\nto increase her prestige; while her wheeled chair, her sharp tone and\nvoice, her eccentric questions (put with an air of the most overbearing\nand unbridled imperiousness), her whole figure--upright, rugged, and\ncommanding as it was--completed the general awe in which she was held.\nAs she inspected her new abode she ordered her chair to be stopped at\nintervals in order that, with finger extended towards some article of\nfurniture, she might ply the respectfully smiling, yet secretly\napprehensive, landlord with unexpected questions. She addressed them to\nhim in French, although her pronunciation of the language was so bad\nthat sometimes I had to translate them. For the most part, the\nlandlord's answers were unsatisfactory, and failed to please her; nor\nwere the questions themselves of a practical nature, but related,\ngenerally, to God knows what.\n\nFor instance, on one occasion she halted before a picture which, a poor\ncopy of a well-known original, had a mythological subject.\n\n\"Of whom is this a portrait?\" she inquired.\n\nThe landlord explained that it was probably that of a countess.\n\n\"But how know you that?\" the old lady retorted.\n\n\"You live here, yet you cannot say for certain! And why is the picture\nthere at all? And why do its eyes look so crooked?\"\n\nTo all these questions the landlord could return no satisfactory reply,\ndespite his floundering endeavours.\n\n\"The blockhead!\" exclaimed the Grandmother in Russian.\n\nThen she proceeded on her way--only to repeat the same story in front\nof a Saxon statuette which she had sighted from afar, and had\ncommanded, for some reason or another, to be brought to her. Finally,\nshe inquired of the landlord what was the value of the carpet in her\nbedroom, as well as where the said carpet had been manufactured; but,\nthe landlord could do no more than promise to make inquiries.\n\n\"What donkeys these people are!\" she commented. Next, she turned her\nattention to the bed.\n\n\"What a huge counterpane!\" she exclaimed. \"Turn it back, please.\" The\nlacqueys did so.\n\n\"Further yet, further yet,\" the old lady cried. \"Turn it RIGHT back.\nAlso, take off those pillows and bolsters, and lift up the feather bed.\"\n\nThe bed was opened for her inspection.\n\n\"Mercifully it contains no bugs,\" she remarked.\n\n\"Pull off the whole thing, and then put on my own pillows and sheets.\nThe place is too luxurious for an old woman like myself. It is too\nlarge for any one person. Alexis Ivanovitch, come and see me whenever\nyou are not teaching your pupils.\"\n\n\"After tomorrow I shall no longer be in the General's service,\" I\nreplied, \"but merely living in the hotel on my own account.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because, the other day, there arrived from Berlin a German and his\nwife--persons of some importance; and, it chanced that, when taking a\nwalk, I spoke to them in German without having properly compassed the\nBerlin accent.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Yes: and this action on my part the Baron held to be an insult, and\ncomplained about it to the General, who yesterday dismissed me from his\nemploy.\"\n\n\"But I suppose you must have threatened that precious Baron, or\nsomething of the kind? However, even if you did so, it was a matter of\nno moment.\"\n\n\"No, I did not. The Baron was the aggressor by raising his stick at me.\"\n\nUpon that the Grandmother turned sharply to the General.\n\n\"What? You permitted yourself to treat your tutor thus, you nincompoop,\nand to dismiss him from his post? You are a blockhead--an utter\nblockhead! I can see that clearly.\"\n\n\"Do not alarm yourself, my dear mother,\" the General replied with a\nlofty air--an air in which there was also a tinge of familiarity. \"I am\nquite capable of managing my own affairs. Moreover, Alexis Ivanovitch\nhas not given you a true account of the matter.\"\n\n\"What did you do next?\" The old lady inquired of me.\n\n\"I wanted to challenge the Baron to a duel,\" I replied as modestly as\npossible; \"but the General protested against my doing so.\"\n\n\"And WHY did you so protest?\" she inquired of the General. Then she\nturned to the landlord, and questioned him as to whether HE would not\nhave fought a duel, if challenged. \"For,\" she added, \"I can see no\ndifference between you and the Baron; nor can I bear that German visage\nof yours.\" Upon this the landlord bowed and departed, though he could\nnot have understood the Grandmother's compliment.\n\n\"Pardon me, Madame,\" the General continued with a sneer, \"but are duels\nreally feasible?\"\n\n\"Why not? All men are crowing cocks, and that is why they quarrel. YOU,\nthough, I perceive, are a blockhead--a man who does not even know how\nto carry his breeding. Lift me up. Potapitch, see to it that you always\nhave TWO bearers ready. Go and arrange for their hire. But we shall not\nrequire more than two, for I shall need only to be carried upstairs. On\nthe level or in the street I can be WHEELED along. Go and tell them\nthat, and pay them in advance, so that they may show me some respect.\nYou too, Potapitch, are always to come with me, and YOU, Alexis\nIvanovitch, are to point out to me this Baron as we go along, in order\nthat I may get a squint at the precious 'Von.' And where is that\nroulette played?\"\n\nI explained to her that the game was carried on in the salons of the\nCasino; whereupon there ensued a string of questions as to whether\nthere were many such salons, whether many people played in them,\nwhether those people played a whole day at a time, and whether the game\nwas managed according to fixed rules. At length, I thought it best to\nsay that the most advisable course would be for her to go and see it\nfor herself, since a mere description of it would be a difficult matter.\n\n\"Then take me straight there,\" she said, \"and do you walk on in front\nof me, Alexis Ivanovitch.\"\n\n\"What, mother? Before you have so much as rested from your journey?\"\nthe General inquired with some solicitude. Also, for some reason which\nI could not divine, he seemed to be growing nervous; and, indeed, the\nwhole party was evincing signs of confusion, and exchanging glances\nwith one another. Probably they were thinking that it would be a\nticklish--even an embarrassing--business to accompany the Grandmother\nto the Casino, where, very likely, she would perpetrate further\neccentricities, and in public too! Yet on their own initiative they had\noffered to escort her!\n\n\"Why should I rest?\" she retorted. \"I am not tired, for I have been\nsitting still these past five days. Let us see what your medicinal\nsprings and waters are like, and where they are situated. What, too,\nabout that, that--what did you call it, Prascovia?--oh, about that\nmountain top?\"\n\n\"Yes, we are going to see it, Grandmamma.\"\n\n\"Very well. Is there anything else for me to see here?\"\n\n\"Yes! Quite a number of things,\" Polina forced herself to say.\n\n\"Martha, YOU must come with me as well,\" went on the old lady to her\nmaid.\n\n\"No, no, mother!\" ejaculated the General. \"Really she cannot come. They\nwould not admit even Potapitch to the Casino.\"\n\n\"Rubbish! Because she is my servant, is that a reason for turning her\nout? Why, she is only a human being like the rest of us; and as she has\nbeen travelling for a week she might like to look about her. With whom\nelse could she go out but myself? She would never dare to show her nose\nin the street alone.\"\n\n\"But, mother--\"\n\n\"Are you ashamed to be seen with me? Stop at home, then, and you will\nbe asked no questions. A pretty General YOU are, to be sure! I am a\ngeneral's widow myself. But, after all, why should I drag the whole\nparty with me? I will go and see the sights with only Alexis Ivanovitch\nas my escort.\"\n\nDe Griers strongly insisted that EVERY ONE ought to accompany her.\nIndeed, he launched out into a perfect shower of charming phrases\nconcerning the pleasure of acting as her cicerone, and so forth. Every\none was touched with his words.\n\n\"Mais elle est tombee en enfance,\" he added aside to the General.\n\"Seule, elle fera des betises.\" More than this I could not overhear,\nbut he seemed to have got some plan in his mind, or even to be feeling\na slight return of his hopes.\n\nThe distance to the Casino was about half a verst, and our route led us\nthrough the Chestnut Avenue until we reached the square directly\nfronting the building. The General, I could see, was a trifle reassured\nby the fact that, though our progress was distinctly eccentric in its\nnature, it was, at least, correct and orderly. As a matter of fact, the\nspectacle of a person who is unable to walk is not anything to excite\nsurprise at a spa. Yet it was clear that the General had a great fear\nof the Casino itself: for why should a person who had lost the use of\nher limbs--more especially an old woman--be going to rooms which were\nset apart only for roulette? On either side of the wheeled chair walked\nPolina and Mlle. Blanche--the latter smiling, modestly jesting, and, in\nshort, making herself so agreeable to the Grandmother that in the end\nthe old lady relented towards her. On the other side of the chair\nPolina had to answer an endless flow of petty questions--such as \"Who\nwas it passed just now?\" \"Who is that coming along?\" \"Is the town a\nlarge one?\" \"Are the public gardens extensive?\" \"What sort of trees are\nthose?\" \"What is the name of those hills?\" \"Do I see eagles flying\nyonder?\" \"What is that absurd-looking building?\" and so forth.\nMeanwhile Astley whispered to me, as he walked by my side, that he\nlooked for much to happen that morning. Behind the old lady's chair\nmarched Potapitch and Martha--Potapitch in his frockcoat and white\nwaistcoat, with a cloak over all, and the forty-year-old and rosy, but\nslightly grey-headed, Martha in a mobcap, cotton dress, and squeaking\nshoes. Frequently the old lady would twist herself round to converse\nwith these servants. As for De Griers, he spoke as though he had made\nup his mind to do something (though it is also possible that he spoke\nin this manner merely in order to hearten the General, with whom he\nappeared to have held a conference). But, alas, the Grandmother had\nuttered the fatal words, \"I am not going to give you any of my money;\"\nand though De Griers might regard these words lightly, the General knew\nhis mother better. Also, I noticed that De Griers and Mlle. Blanche\nwere still exchanging looks; while of the Prince and the German savant\nI lost sight at the end of the Avenue, where they had turned back and\nleft us.\n\nInto the Casino we marched in triumph. At once, both in the person of\nthe commissionaire and in the persons of the footmen, there sprang to\nlife the same reverence as had arisen in the lacqueys of the hotel. Yet\nit was not without some curiosity that they eyed us.\n\nWithout loss of time, the Grandmother gave orders that she should be\nwheeled through every room in the establishment; of which apartments\nshe praised a few, while to others she remained indifferent. Concerning\neverything, however, she asked questions. Finally we reached the\ngaming-salons, where a lacquey who was, acting as guard over the doors,\nflung them open as though he were a man possessed.\n\nThe Grandmother's entry into the roulette-salon produced a profound\nimpression upon the public. Around the tables, and at the further end\nof the room where the trente-et-quarante table was set out, there may\nhave been gathered from 150 to 200 gamblers, ranged in several rows.\nThose who had succeeded in pushing their way to the tables were\nstanding with their feet firmly planted, in order to avoid having to\ngive up their places until they should have finished their game (since\nmerely to stand looking on--thus occupying a gambler's place for\nnothing--was not permitted). True, chairs were provided around the\ntables, but few players made use of them--more especially if there was\na large attendance of the general public; since to stand allowed of a\ncloser approach; and, therefore, of greater facilities for calculation\nand staking. Behind the foremost row were herded a second and a third\nrow of people awaiting their turn; but sometimes their impatience led\nthese people to stretch a hand through the first row, in order to\ndeposit their stakes. Even third-row individuals would dart forward to\nstake; whence seldom did more than five or ten minutes pass without a\nscene over disputed money arising at one or another end of the table.\nOn the other hand, the police of the Casino were an able body of men;\nand though to escape the crush was an impossibility, however much one\nmight wish it, the eight croupiers apportioned to each table kept an\neye upon the stakes, performed the necessary reckoning, and decided\ndisputes as they arose.\n\nIn the last resort they always called in the Casino police, and the\ndisputes would immediately come to an end. Policemen were stationed\nabout the Casino in ordinary costume, and mingled with the spectators\nso as to make it impossible to recognise them. In particular they kept\na lookout for pickpockets and swindlers, who simply swanned in the\nroulette salons, and reaped a rich harvest. Indeed, in every direction\nmoney was being filched from pockets or purses--though, of course, if\nthe attempt miscarried, a great uproar ensued. One had only to approach\na roulette table, begin to play, and then openly grab some one else's\nwinnings, for a din to be raised, and the thief to start vociferating\nthat the stake was HIS; and, if the coup had been carried out with\nsufficient skill, and the witnesses wavered at all in their testimony,\nthe thief would as likely as not succeed in getting away with the\nmoney, provided that the sum was not a large one--not large enough to\nhave attracted the attention of the croupiers or some fellow-player.\nMoreover, if it were a stake of insignificant size, its true owner\nwould sometimes decline to continue the dispute, rather than become\ninvolved in a scandal. Conversely, if the thief was detected, he was\nignominiously expelled the building.\n\nUpon all this the Grandmother gazed with open-eyed curiosity; and, on\nsome thieves happening to be turned out of the place, she was\ndelighted. Trente-et-quarante interested her but little; she preferred\nroulette, with its ever-revolving wheel. At length she expressed a wish\nto view the game closer; whereupon in some mysterious manner, the\nlacqueys and other officious agents (especially one or two ruined Poles\nof the kind who keep offering their services to successful gamblers and\nforeigners in general) at once found and cleared a space for the old\nlady among the crush, at the very centre of one of the tables, and next\nto the chief croupier; after which they wheeled her chair thither. Upon\nthis a number of visitors who were not playing, but only looking on\n(particularly some Englishmen with their families), pressed closer\nforward towards the table, in order to watch the old lady from among\nthe ranks of the gamblers. Many a lorgnette I saw turned in her\ndirection, and the croupiers' hopes rose high that such an eccentric\nplayer was about to provide them with something out of the common. An\nold lady of seventy-five years who, though unable to walk, desired to\nplay was not an everyday phenomenon. I too pressed forward towards the\ntable, and ranged myself by the Grandmother's side; while Martha and\nPotapitch remained somewhere in the background among the crowd, and the\nGeneral, Polina, and De Griers, with Mlle. Blanche, also remained\nhidden among the spectators.\n\nAt first the old lady did no more than watch the gamblers, and ply me,\nin a half-whisper, with sharp-broken questions as to who was so-and-so.\nEspecially did her favour light upon a very young man who was plunging\nheavily, and had won (so it was whispered) as much as 40,000 francs,\nwhich were lying before him on the table in a heap of gold and\nbank-notes. His eyes kept flashing, and his hands shaking; yet all the\nwhile he staked without any sort of calculation--just what came to his\nhand, as he kept winning and winning, and raking and raking in his\ngains. Around him lacqueys fussed--placing chairs just behind where he\nwas standing--and clearing the spectators from his vicinity, so that he\nshould have more room, and not be crowded--the whole done, of course,\nin expectation of a generous largesse. From time to time other gamblers\nwould hand him part of their winnings--being glad to let him stake for\nthem as much as his hand could grasp; while beside him stood a Pole in\na state of violent, but respectful, agitation, who, also in expectation\nof a generous largesse, kept whispering to him at intervals (probably\ntelling him what to stake, and advising and directing his play). Yet\nnever once did the player throw him a glance as he staked and staked,\nand raked in his winnings. Evidently, the player in question was dead\nto all besides.\n\nFor a few minutes the Grandmother watched him.\n\n\"Go and tell him,\" suddenly she exclaimed with a nudge at my elbow,\n\"--go and tell him to stop, and to take his money with him, and go\nhome. Presently he will be losing--yes, losing everything that he has\nnow won.\" She seemed almost breathless with excitement.\n\n\"Where is Potapitch?\" she continued. \"Send Potapitch to speak to him.\nNo, YOU must tell him, you must tell him,\"--here she nudged me\nagain--\"for I have not the least notion where Potapitch is. Sortez,\nsortez,\" she shouted to the young man, until I leant over in her\ndirection and whispered in her ear that no shouting was allowed, nor\neven loud speaking, since to do so disturbed the calculations of the\nplayers, and might lead to our being ejected.\n\n\"How provoking!\" she retorted. \"Then the young man is done for! I\nsuppose he WISHES to be ruined. Yet I could not bear to see him have to\nreturn it all. What a fool the fellow is!\" and the old lady turned\nsharply away.\n\nOn the left, among the players at the other half of the table, a young\nlady was playing, with, beside her, a dwarf. Who the dwarf may have\nbeen--whether a relative or a person whom she took with her to act as a\nfoil--I do not know; but I had noticed her there on previous occasions,\nsince, everyday, she entered the Casino at one o'clock precisely, and\ndeparted at two--thus playing for exactly one hour. Being well-known to\nthe attendants, she always had a seat provided for her; and, taking\nsome gold and a few thousand-franc notes out of her pocket--would begin\nquietly, coldly, and after much calculation, to stake, and mark down\nthe figures in pencil on a paper, as though striving to work out a\nsystem according to which, at given moments, the odds might group\nthemselves. Always she staked large coins, and either lost or won one,\ntwo, or three thousand francs a day, but not more; after which she\nwould depart. The Grandmother took a long look at her.\n\n\"THAT woman is not losing,\" she said. \"To whom does she belong? Do you\nknow her? Who is she?\"\n\n\"She is, I believe, a Frenchwoman,\" I replied.\n\n\"Ah! A bird of passage, evidently. Besides, I can see that she has her\nshoes polished. Now, explain to me the meaning of each round in the\ngame, and the way in which one ought to stake.\"\n\nUpon this I set myself to explain the meaning of all the\ncombinations--of \"rouge et noir,\" of \"pair et impair,\" of \"manque et\npasse,\" with, lastly, the different values in the system of numbers.\nThe Grandmother listened attentively, took notes, put questions in\nvarious forms, and laid the whole thing to heart. Indeed, since an\nexample of each system of stakes kept constantly occurring, a great\ndeal of information could be assimilated with ease and celerity. The\nGrandmother was vastly pleased.\n\n\"But what is zero?\" she inquired. \"Just now I heard the flaxen-haired\ncroupier call out 'zero!' And why does he keep raking in all the money\nthat is on the table? To think that he should grab the whole pile for\nhimself! What does zero mean?\"\n\n\"Zero is what the bank takes for itself. If the wheel stops at that\nfigure, everything lying on the table becomes the absolute property of\nthe bank. Also, whenever the wheel has begun to turn, the bank ceases\nto pay out anything.\"\n\n\"Then I should receive nothing if I were staking?\"\n\n\"No; unless by any chance you had PURPOSELY staked on zero; in which\ncase you would receive thirty-five times the value of your stake.\"\n\n\"Why thirty-five times, when zero so often turns up? And if so, why do\nnot more of these fools stake upon it?\"\n\n\"Because the number of chances against its occurrence is thirty-six.\"\n\n\"Rubbish! Potapitch, Potapitch! Come here, and I will give you some\nmoney.\" The old lady took out of her pocket a tightly-clasped purse,\nand extracted from its depths a ten-gulden piece. \"Go at once, and\nstake that upon zero.\"\n\n\"But, Madame, zero has only this moment turned up,\" I remonstrated;\n\"wherefore, it may not do so again for ever so long. Wait a little, and\nyou may then have a better chance.\"\n\n\"Rubbish! Stake, please.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, but zero might not turn up again until, say, tonight, even\nthough you had staked thousands upon it. It often happens so.\"\n\n\"Rubbish, rubbish! Who fears the wolf should never enter the forest.\nWhat? We have lost? Then stake again.\"\n\nA second ten-gulden piece did we lose, and then I put down a third. The\nGrandmother could scarcely remain seated in her chair, so intent was\nshe upon the little ball as it leapt through the notches of the\never-revolving wheel. However, the third ten-gulden piece followed the\nfirst two. Upon this the Grandmother went perfectly crazy. She could no\nlonger sit still, and actually struck the table with her fist when the\ncroupier cried out, \"Trente-six,\" instead of the desiderated zero.\n\n\"To listen to him!\" fumed the old lady. \"When will that accursed zero\never turn up? I cannot breathe until I see it. I believe that that\ninfernal croupier is PURPOSELY keeping it from turning up. Alexis\nIvanovitch, stake TWO golden pieces this time. The moment we cease to\nstake, that cursed zero will come turning up, and we shall get nothing.\"\n\n\"My good Madame--\"\n\n\"Stake, stake! It is not YOUR money.\"\n\nAccordingly I staked two ten-gulden pieces. The ball went hopping round\nthe wheel until it began to settle through the notches. Meanwhile the\nGrandmother sat as though petrified, with my hand convulsively clutched\nin hers.\n\n\"Zero!\" called the croupier.\n\n\"There! You see, you see!\" cried the old lady, as she turned and faced\nme, wreathed in smiles. \"I told you so! It was the Lord God himself who\nsuggested to me to stake those two coins. Now, how much ought I to\nreceive? Why do they not pay it out to me? Potapitch! Martha! Where are\nthey? What has become of our party? Potapitch, Potapitch!\"\n\n\"Presently, Madame,\" I whispered. \"Potapitch is outside, and they would\ndecline to admit him to these rooms. See! You are being paid out your\nmoney. Pray take it.\" The croupiers were making up a heavy packet of\ncoins, sealed in blue paper, and containing fifty ten gulden pieces,\ntogether with an unsealed packet containing another twenty. I handed\nthe whole to the old lady in a money-shovel.\n\n\"Faites le jeu, messieurs! Faites le jeu, messieurs! Rien ne va plus,\"\nproclaimed the croupier as once more he invited the company to stake,\nand prepared to turn the wheel.\n\n\"We shall be too late! He is going to spin again! Stake, stake!\" The\nGrandmother was in a perfect fever. \"Do not hang back! Be quick!\" She\nseemed almost beside herself, and nudged me as hard as she could.\n\n\"Upon what shall I stake, Madame?\"\n\n\"Upon zero, upon zero! Again upon zero! Stake as much as ever you can.\nHow much have we got? Seventy ten-gulden pieces? We shall not miss\nthem, so stake twenty pieces at a time.\"\n\n\"Think a moment, Madame. Sometimes zero does not turn up for two\nhundred rounds in succession. I assure you that you may lose all your\ncapital.\"\n\n\"You are wrong--utterly wrong. Stake, I tell you! What a chattering\ntongue you have! I know perfectly well what I am doing.\" The old lady\nwas shaking with excitement.\n\n\"But the rules do not allow of more than 120 gulden being staked upon\nzero at a time.\"\n\n\"How 'do not allow'? Surely you are wrong? Monsieur, monsieur--\" here\nshe nudged the croupier who was sitting on her left, and preparing to\nspin--\"combien zero? Douze? Douze?\"\n\nI hastened to translate.\n\n\"Oui, Madame,\" was the croupier's polite reply. \"No single stake must\nexceed four thousand florins. That is the regulation.\"\n\n\"Then there is nothing else for it. We must risk in gulden.\"\n\n\"Le jeu est fait!\" the croupier called. The wheel revolved, and stopped\nat thirty. We had lost!\n\n\"Again, again, again! Stake again!\" shouted the old lady. Without\nattempting to oppose her further, but merely shrugging my shoulders, I\nplaced twelve more ten-gulden pieces upon the table. The wheel whirled\naround and around, with the Grandmother simply quaking as she watched\nits revolutions.\n\n\"Does she again think that zero is going to be the winning coup?\"\nthought I, as I stared at her in astonishment. Yet an absolute\nassurance of winning was shining on her face; she looked perfectly\nconvinced that zero was about to be called again. At length the ball\ndropped off into one of the notches.\n\n\"Zero!\" cried the croupier.\n\n\"Ah!!!\" screamed the old lady as she turned to me in a whirl of triumph.\n\nI myself was at heart a gambler. At that moment I became acutely\nconscious both of that fact and of the fact that my hands and knees\nwere shaking, and that the blood was beating in my brain. Of course\nthis was a rare occasion--an occasion on which zero had turned up no\nless than three times within a dozen rounds; yet in such an event there\nwas nothing so very surprising, seeing that, only three days ago, I\nmyself had been a witness to zero turning up THREE TIMES IN SUCCESSION,\nso that one of the players who was recording the coups on paper was\nmoved to remark that for several days past zero had never turned up at\nall!\n\nWith the Grandmother, as with any one who has won a very large sum, the\nmanagement settled up with great attention and respect, since she was\nfortunate to have to receive no less than 4200 gulden. Of these gulden\nthe odd 200 were paid her in gold, and the remainder in bank notes.\n\nThis time the old lady did not call for Potapitch; for that she was too\npreoccupied. Though not outwardly shaken by the event (indeed, she\nseemed perfectly calm), she was trembling inwardly from head to foot.\nAt length, completely absorbed in the game, she burst out:\n\n\"Alexis Ivanovitch, did not the croupier just say that 4000 florins\nwere the most that could be staked at any one time? Well, take these\n4000, and stake them upon the red.\"\n\nTo oppose her was useless. Once more the wheel revolved.\n\n\"Rouge!\" proclaimed the croupier.\n\nAgain 4000 florins--in all 8000!\n\n\"Give me them,\" commanded the Grandmother, \"and stake the other 4000\nupon the red again.\"\n\nI did so.\n\n\"Rouge!\" proclaimed the croupier.\n\n\"Twelve thousand!\" cried the old lady. \"Hand me the whole lot. Put the\ngold into this purse here, and count the bank notes. Enough! Let us go\nhome. Wheel my chair away.\"\n\n\n\nXI\n\nTHE chair, with the old lady beaming in it, was wheeled away towards\nthe doors at the further end of the salon, while our party hastened to\ncrowd around her, and to offer her their congratulations. In fact,\neccentric as was her conduct, it was also overshadowed by her triumph;\nwith the result that the General no longer feared to be publicly\ncompromised by being seen with such a strange woman, but, smiling in a\ncondescending, cheerfully familiar way, as though he were soothing a\nchild, he offered his greetings to the old lady. At the same time, both\nhe and the rest of the spectators were visibly impressed. Everywhere\npeople kept pointing to the Grandmother, and talking about her. Many\npeople even walked beside her chair, in order to view her the better\nwhile, at a little distance, Astley was carrying on a conversation on\nthe subject with two English acquaintances of his. De Griers was simply\noverflowing with smiles and compliments, and a number of fine ladies\nwere staring at the Grandmother as though she had been something\ncurious.\n\n\"Quelle victoire!\" exclaimed De Griers.\n\n\"Mais, Madame, c'etait du feu!\" added Mlle. Blanche with an elusive\nsmile.\n\n\"Yes, I have won twelve thousand florins,\" replied the old lady. \"And\nthen there is all this gold. With it the total ought to come to nearly\nthirteen thousand. How much is that in Russian money? Six thousand\nroubles, I think?\"\n\nHowever, I calculated that the sum would exceed seven thousand\nroubles--or, at the present rate of exchange, even eight thousand.\n\n\"Eight thousand roubles! What a splendid thing! And to think of you\nsimpletons sitting there and doing nothing! Potapitch! Martha! See what\nI have won!\"\n\n\"How DID you do it, Madame?\" Martha exclaimed ecstatically. \"Eight\nthousand roubles!\"\n\n\"And I am going to give you fifty gulden apiece. There they are.\"\n\nPotapitch and Martha rushed towards her to kiss her hand.\n\n\"And to each bearer also I will give a ten-gulden piece. Let them have\nit out of the gold, Alexis Ivanovitch. But why is this footman bowing\nto me, and that other man as well? Are they congratulating me? Well,\nlet them have ten gulden apiece.\"\n\n\"Madame la princesse--Un pauvre expatrie--Malheur continuel--Les\nprinces russes sont si genereux!\" said a man who for some time past had\nbeen hanging around the old lady's chair--a personage who, dressed in a\nshabby frockcoat and coloured waistcoat, kept taking off his cap, and\nsmiling pathetically.\n\n\"Give him ten gulden,\" said the Grandmother. \"No, give him twenty. Now,\nenough of that, or I shall never get done with you all. Take a moment's\nrest, and then carry me away. Prascovia, I mean to buy a new dress for\nyou tomorrow. Yes, and for you too, Mlle. Blanche. Please translate,\nPrascovia.\"\n\n\"Merci, Madame,\" replied Mlle. Blanche gratefully as she twisted her\nface into the mocking smile which usually she kept only for the benefit\nof De Griers and the General. The latter looked confused, and seemed\ngreatly relieved when we reached the Avenue.\n\n\"How surprised Theodosia too will be!\" went on the Grandmother\n(thinking of the General's nursemaid). \"She, like yourselves, shall\nhave the price of a new gown. Here, Alexis Ivanovitch! Give that beggar\nsomething\" (a crooked-backed ragamuffin had approached to stare at us).\n\n\"But perhaps he is NOT a beggar--only a rascal,\" I replied.\n\n\"Never mind, never mind. Give him a gulden.\"\n\nI approached the beggar in question, and handed him the coin. Looking\nat me in great astonishment, he silently accepted the gulden, while\nfrom his person there proceeded a strong smell of liquor.\n\n\"Have you never tried your luck, Alexis Ivanovitch?\"\n\n\"No, Madame.\"\n\n\"Yet just now I could see that you were burning to do so?\"\n\n\"I do mean to try my luck presently.\"\n\n\"Then stake everything upon zero. You have seen how it ought to be\ndone? How much capital do you possess?\"\n\n\"Two hundred gulden, Madame.\"\n\n\"Not very much. See here; I will lend you five hundred if you wish.\nTake this purse of mine.\" With that she added sharply to the General:\n\"But YOU need not expect to receive any.\"\n\nThis seemed to upset him, but he said nothing, and De Griers contented\nhimself by scowling.\n\n\"Que diable!\" he whispered to the General. \"C'est une terrible vieille.\"\n\n\"Look! Another beggar, another beggar!\" exclaimed the grandmother.\n\"Alexis Ivanovitch, go and give him a gulden.\"\n\nAs she spoke I saw approaching us a grey-headed old man with a wooden\nleg--a man who was dressed in a blue frockcoat and carrying a staff. He\nlooked like an old soldier. As soon as I tendered him the coin he fell\nback a step or two, and eyed me threateningly.\n\n\"Was ist der Teufel!\" he cried, and appended thereto a round dozen of\noaths.\n\n\"The man is a perfect fool!\" exclaimed the Grandmother, waving her\nhand. \"Move on now, for I am simply famished. When we have lunched we\nwill return to that place.\"\n\n\"What?\" cried I. \"You are going to play again?\"\n\n\"What else do you suppose?\" she retorted. \"Are you going only to sit\nhere, and grow sour, and let me look at you?\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said De Griers confidentially, \"les chances peuvent tourner.\nUne seule mauvaise chance, et vous perdrez tout--surtout avec votre\njeu. C'etait terrible!\"\n\n\"Oui; vous perdrez absolument,\" put in Mlle. Blanche.\n\n\"What has that got to do with YOU?\" retorted the old lady. \"It is not\nYOUR money that I am going to lose; it is my own. And where is that Mr.\nAstley of yours?\" she added to myself.\n\n\"He stayed behind in the Casino.\"\n\n\"What a pity! He is such a nice sort of man!\"\n\nArriving home, and meeting the landlord on the staircase, the\nGrandmother called him to her side, and boasted to him of her\nwinnings--thereafter doing the same to Theodosia, and conferring upon\nher thirty gulden; after which she bid her serve luncheon. The meal\nover, Theodosia and Martha broke into a joint flood of ecstasy.\n\n\"I was watching you all the time, Madame,\" quavered Martha, \"and I\nasked Potapitch what mistress was trying to do. And, my word! the heaps\nand heaps of money that were lying upon the table! Never in my life\nhave I seen so much money. And there were gentlefolk around it, and\nother gentlefolk sitting down. So, I asked Potapitch where all these\ngentry had come from; for, thought I, maybe the Holy Mother of God will\nhelp our mistress among them. Yes, I prayed for you, Madame, and my\nheart died within me, so that I kept trembling and trembling. The Lord\nbe with her, I thought to myself; and in answer to my prayer He has now\nsent you what He has done! Even yet I tremble--I tremble to think of it\nall.\"\n\n\"Alexis Ivanovitch,\" said the old lady, \"after luncheon,--that is to\nsay, about four o'clock--get ready to go out with me again. But in the\nmeanwhile, good-bye. Do not forget to call a doctor, for I must take\nthe waters. Now go and get rested a little.\"\n\nI left the Grandmother's presence in a state of bewilderment.\n\nVainly I endeavoured to imagine what would become of our party, or what\nturn the affair would next take. I could perceive that none of the\nparty had yet recovered their presence of mind--least of all the\nGeneral. The factor of the Grandmother's appearance in place of the\nhourly expected telegram to announce her death (with, of course,\nresultant legacies) had so upset the whole scheme of intentions and\nprojects that it was with a decided feeling of apprehension and growing\nparalysis that the conspirators viewed any future performances of the\nold lady at roulette. Yet this second factor was not quite so important\nas the first, since, though the Grandmother had twice declared that she\ndid not intend to give the General any money, that declaration was not\na complete ground for the abandonment of hope. Certainly De Griers,\nwho, with the General, was up to the neck in the affair, had not wholly\nlost courage; and I felt sure that Mlle. Blanche also--Mlle. Blanche\nwho was not only as deeply involved as the other two, but also\nexpectant of becoming Madame General and an important legatee--would\nnot lightly surrender the position, but would use her every resource of\ncoquetry upon the old lady, in order to afford a contrast to the\nimpetuous Polina, who was difficult to understand, and lacked the art\nof pleasing.\n\nYet now, when the Grandmother had just performed an astonishing feat at\nroulette; now, when the old lady's personality had been so clearly and\ntypically revealed as that of a rugged, arrogant woman who was \"tombee\nen enfance\"; now, when everything appeared to be lost,--why, now the\nGrandmother was as merry as a child which plays with thistle-down.\n\"Good Lord!\" I thought with, may God forgive me, a most malicious\nsmile, \"every ten-gulden piece which the Grandmother staked must have\nraised a blister on the General's heart, and maddened De Griers, and\ndriven Mlle. de Cominges almost to frenzy with the sight of this spoon\ndangling before her lips.\" Another factor is the circumstance that even\nwhen, overjoyed at winning, the Grandmother was distributing alms right\nand left, and taking every one to be a beggar, she again snapped out to\nthe General that he was not going to be allowed any of her money--which\nmeant that the old lady had quite made up her mind on the point, and\nwas sure of it. Yes, danger loomed ahead.\n\nAll these thoughts passed through my mind during the few moments that,\nhaving left the old lady's rooms, I was ascending to my own room on the\ntop storey. What most struck me was the fact that, though I had divined\nthe chief, the stoutest, threads which united the various actors in the\ndrama, I had, until now, been ignorant of the methods and secrets of\nthe game. For Polina had never been completely open with me. Although,\non occasions, it had happened that involuntarily, as it were, she had\nrevealed to me something of her heart, I had noticed that in most\ncases--in fact, nearly always--she had either laughed away these\nrevelations, or grown confused, or purposely imparted to them a false\nguise. Yes, she must have concealed a great deal from me. But, I had a\npresentiment that now the end of this strained and mysterious situation\nwas approaching. Another stroke, and all would be finished and exposed.\nOf my own fortunes, interested though I was in the affair, I took no\naccount. I was in the strange position of possessing but two hundred\ngulden, of being at a loose end, of lacking both a post, the means of\nsubsistence, a shred of hope, and any plans for the future, yet of\ncaring nothing for these things. Had not my mind been so full of\nPolina, I should have given myself up to the comical piquancy of the\nimpending denouement, and laughed my fill at it. But the thought of\nPolina was torture to me. That her fate was settled I already had an\ninkling; yet that was not the thought which was giving me so much\nuneasiness. What I really wished for was to penetrate her secrets. I\nwanted her to come to me and say, \"I love you,\" and, if she would not\nso come, or if to hope that she would ever do so was an unthinkable\nabsurdity--why, then there was nothing else for me to want. Even now I\ndo not know what I am wanting. I feel like a man who has lost his way.\nI yearn but to be in her presence, and within the circle of her light\nand splendour--to be there now, and forever, and for the whole of my\nlife. More I do not know. How can I ever bring myself to leave her?\n\nOn reaching the third storey of the hotel I experienced a shock. I was\njust passing the General's suite when something caused me to look\nround. Out of a door about twenty paces away there was coming Polina!\nShe hesitated for a moment on seeing me, and then beckoned me to her.\n\n\"Polina Alexandrovna!\"\n\n\"Hush! Not so loud.\"\n\n\"Something startled me just now,\" I whispered, \"and I looked round, and\nsaw you. Some electrical influence seems to emanate from your form.\"\n\n\"Take this letter,\" she went on with a frown (probably she had not even\nheard my words, she was so preoccupied), \"and hand it personally to Mr.\nAstley. Go as quickly as ever you can, please. No answer will be\nrequired. He himself--\" She did not finish her sentence.\n\n\"To Mr. Astley?\" I asked, in some astonishment.\n\nBut she had vanished again.\n\nAha! So the two were carrying on a correspondence! However, I set off\nto search for Astley--first at his hotel, and then at the Casino, where\nI went the round of the salons in vain. At length, vexed, and almost in\ndespair, I was on my way home when I ran across him among a troop of\nEnglish ladies and gentlemen who had been out for a ride. Beckoning to\nhim to stop, I handed him the letter. We had barely time even to look\nat one another, but I suspected that it was of set purpose that he\nrestarted his horse so quickly.\n\nWas jealousy, then, gnawing at me? At all events, I felt exceedingly\ndepressed, despite the fact that I had no desire to ascertain what the\ncorrespondence was about. To think that HE should be her confidant! \"My\nfriend, mine own familiar friend!\" passed through my mind. Yet WAS\nthere any love in the matter? \"Of course not,\" reason whispered to me.\nBut reason goes for little on such occasions. I felt that the matter\nmust be cleared up, for it was becoming unpleasantly complex.\n\nI had scarcely set foot in the hotel when the commissionaire and the\nlandlord (the latter issuing from his room for the purpose) alike\ninformed me that I was being searched for high and low--that three\nseparate messages to ascertain my whereabouts had come down from the\nGeneral. When I entered his study I was feeling anything but kindly\ndisposed. I found there the General himself, De Griers, and Mlle.\nBlanche, but not Mlle.'s mother, who was a person whom her reputed\ndaughter used only for show purposes, since in all matters of business\nthe daughter fended for herself, and it is unlikely that the mother\nknew anything about them.\n\nSome very heated discussion was in progress, and meanwhile the door of\nthe study was open--an unprecedented circumstance. As I approached the\nportals I could hear loud voices raised, for mingled with the pert,\nvenomous accents of De Griers were Mlle. Blanche's excited, impudently\nabusive tongue and the General's plaintive wail as, apparently, he\nsought to justify himself in something. But on my appearance every one\nstopped speaking, and tried to put a better face upon matters. De\nGriers smoothed his hair, and twisted his angry face into a smile--into\nthe mean, studiedly polite French smile which I so detested; while the\ndowncast, perplexed General assumed an air of dignity--though only in a\nmechanical way. On the other hand, Mlle. Blanche did not trouble to\nconceal the wrath that was sparkling in her countenance, but bent her\ngaze upon me with an air of impatient expectancy. I may remark that\nhitherto she had treated me with absolute superciliousness, and, so far\nfrom answering my salutations, had always ignored them.\n\n\"Alexis Ivanovitch,\" began the General in a tone of affectionate\nupbraiding, \"may I say to you that I find it strange, exceedingly\nstrange, that--In short, your conduct towards myself and my family-- In\na word, your--er--extremely--\"\n\n\"Eh! Ce n'est pas ca,\" interrupted De Griers in a tone of impatience\nand contempt (evidently he was the ruling spirit of the conclave). \"Mon\ncher monsieur, notre general se trompe. What he means to say is that he\nwarns you--he begs of you most earnestly--not to ruin him. I use the\nexpression because--\"\n\n\"Why? Why?\" I interjected.\n\n\"Because you have taken upon yourself to act as guide to this, to\nthis--how shall I express it?--to this old lady, a cette pauvre\nterrible vieille. But she will only gamble away all that she\nhas--gamble it away like thistledown. You yourself have seen her play.\nOnce she has acquired the taste for gambling, she will never leave the\nroulette-table, but, of sheer perversity and temper, will stake her\nall, and lose it. In cases such as hers a gambler can never be torn\naway from the game; and then--and then--\"\n\n\"And then,\" asseverated the General, \"you will have ruined my whole\nfamily. I and my family are her heirs, for she has no nearer relatives\nthan ourselves. I tell you frankly that my affairs are in great--very\ngreat disorder; how much they are so you yourself are partially aware.\nIf she should lose a large sum, or, maybe, her whole fortune, what will\nbecome of us--of my children\" (here the General exchanged a glance with\nDe Griers) \"or of me?\" (here he looked at Mlle. Blanche, who turned her\nhead contemptuously away). \"Alexis Ivanovitch, I beg of you to save us.\"\n\n\"Tell me, General, how am I to do so? On what footing do I stand here?\"\n\n\"Refuse to take her about. Simply leave her alone.\"\n\n\"But she would soon find some one else to take my place?\"\n\n\"Ce n'est pas ca, ce n'est pas ca,\" again interrupted De Griers. \"Que\ndiable! Do not leave her alone so much as advise her, persuade her,\ndraw her away. In any case do not let her gamble; find her some\ncounter-attraction.\"\n\n\"And how am I to do that? If only you would undertake the task,\nMonsieur de Griers!\" I said this last as innocently as possible, but at\nonce saw a rapid glance of excited interrogation pass from Mlle.\nBlanche to De Griers, while in the face of the latter also there\ngleamed something which he could not repress.\n\n\"Well, at the present moment she would refuse to accept my services,\"\nsaid he with a gesture. \"But if, later--\"\n\nHere he gave Mlle. Blanche another glance which was full of meaning;\nwhereupon she advanced towards me with a bewitching smile, and seized\nand pressed my hands. Devil take it, but how that devilish visage of\nhers could change! At the present moment it was a visage full of\nsupplication, and as gentle in its expression as that of a smiling,\nroguish infant. Stealthily, she drew me apart from the rest as though\nthe more completely to separate me from them; and, though no harm came\nof her doing so--for it was merely a stupid manoeuvre, and no more--I\nfound the situation very unpleasant.\n\nThe General hastened to lend her his support.\n\n\"Alexis Ivanovitch,\" he began, \"pray pardon me for having said what I\ndid just now--for having said more than I meant to do. I beg and\nbeseech you, I kiss the hem of your garment, as our Russian saying has\nit, for you, and only you, can save us. I and Mlle. de Cominges, we all\nof us beg of you--But you understand, do you not? Surely you\nunderstand?\" and with his eyes he indicated Mlle. Blanche. Truly he was\ncutting a pitiful figure!\n\nAt this moment three low, respectful knocks sounded at the door; which,\non being opened, revealed a chambermaid, with Potapitch behind\nher--come from the Grandmother to request that I should attend her in\nher rooms. \"She is in a bad humour,\" added Potapitch.\n\nThe time was half-past three.\n\n\"My mistress was unable to sleep,\" explained Potapitch; \"so, after\ntossing about for a while, she suddenly rose, called for her chair, and\nsent me to look for you. She is now in the verandah.\"\n\n\"Quelle megere!\" exclaimed De Griers.\n\nTrue enough, I found Madame in the hotel verandah--much put about at my\ndelay, for she had been unable to contain herself until four o'clock.\n\n\"Lift me up,\" she cried to the bearers, and once more we set out for\nthe roulette-salons.\n\n\n\nXII\n\nThe Grandmother was in an impatient, irritable frame of mind. Without\ndoubt the roulette had turned her head, for she appeared to be\nindifferent to everything else, and, in general, seemed much\ndistraught. For instance, she asked me no questions about objects en\nroute, except that, when a sumptuous barouche passed us and raised a\ncloud of dust, she lifted her hand for a moment, and inquired, \"What\nwas that?\" Yet even then she did not appear to hear my reply, although\nat times her abstraction was interrupted by sallies and fits of sharp,\nimpatient fidgeting. Again, when I pointed out to her the Baron and\nBaroness Burmergelm walking to the Casino, she merely looked at them in\nan absent-minded sort of way, and said with complete indifference,\n\"Ah!\" Then, turning sharply to Potapitch and Martha, who were walking\nbehind us, she rapped out:\n\n\"Why have YOU attached yourselves to the party? We are not going to\ntake you with us every time. Go home at once.\" Then, when the servants\nhad pulled hasty bows and departed, she added to me: \"You are all the\nescort I need.\"\n\nAt the Casino the Grandmother seemed to be expected, for no time was\nlost in procuring her former place beside the croupier. It is my\nopinion that though croupiers seem such ordinary, humdrum\nofficials--men who care nothing whether the bank wins or loses--they\nare, in reality, anything but indifferent to the bank's losing, and are\ngiven instructions to attract players, and to keep a watch over the\nbank's interests; as also, that for such services, these officials are\nawarded prizes and premiums. At all events, the croupiers of\nRoulettenberg seemed to look upon the Grandmother as their lawful\nprey--whereafter there befell what our party had foretold.\n\nIt happened thus:\n\nAs soon as ever we arrived the Grandmother ordered me to stake twelve\nten-gulden pieces in succession upon zero. Once, twice, and thrice I\ndid so, yet zero never turned up.\n\n\"Stake again,\" said the old lady with an impatient nudge of my elbow,\nand I obeyed.\n\n\"How many times have we lost?\" she inquired--actually grinding her\nteeth in her excitement.\n\n\"We have lost 144 ten-gulden pieces,\" I replied. \"I tell you, Madame,\nthat zero may not turn up until nightfall.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" she interrupted. \"Keep on staking upon zero, and also\nstake a thousand gulden upon rouge. Here is a banknote with which to do\nso.\"\n\nThe red turned up, but zero missed again, and we only got our thousand\ngulden back.\n\n\"But you see, you see,\" whispered the old lady. \"We have now recovered\nalmost all that we staked. Try zero again. Let us do so another ten\ntimes, and then leave off.\"\n\nBy the fifth round, however, the Grandmother was weary of the scheme.\n\n\"To the devil with that zero!\" she exclaimed. \"Stake four thousand\ngulden upon the red.\"\n\n\"But, Madame, that will be so much to venture!\" I remonstrated.\n\"Suppose the red should not turn up?\" The Grandmother almost struck me\nin her excitement. Her agitation was rapidly making her quarrelsome.\nConsequently, there was nothing for it but to stake the whole four\nthousand gulden as she had directed.\n\nThe wheel revolved while the Grandmother sat as bolt upright, and with\nas proud and quiet a mien, as though she had not the least doubt of\nwinning.\n\n\"Zero!\" cried the croupier.\n\nAt first the old lady failed to understand the situation; but, as soon\nas she saw the croupier raking in her four thousand gulden, together\nwith everything else that happened to be lying on the table, and\nrecognised that the zero which had been so long turning up, and on\nwhich we had lost nearly two hundred ten-gulden pieces, had at length,\nas though of set purpose, made a sudden reappearance--why, the poor old\nlady fell to cursing it, and to throwing herself about, and wailing and\ngesticulating at the company at large. Indeed, some people in our\nvicinity actually burst out laughing.\n\n\"To think that that accursed zero should have turned up NOW!\" she\nsobbed. \"The accursed, accursed thing! And, it is all YOUR fault,\" she\nadded, rounding upon me in a frenzy. \"It was you who persuaded me to\ncease staking upon it.\"\n\n\"But, Madame, I only explained the game to you. How am I to answer for\nevery mischance which may occur in it?\"\n\n\"You and your mischances!\" she whispered threateningly. \"Go! Away at\nonce!\"\n\n\"Farewell, then, Madame.\" And I turned to depart.\n\n\"No--stay,\" she put in hastily. \"Where are you going to? Why should you\nleave me? You fool! No, no... stay here. It is I who was the fool. Tell\nme what I ought to do.\"\n\n\"I cannot take it upon myself to advise you, for you will only blame me\nif I do so. Play at your own discretion. Say exactly what you wish\nstaked, and I will stake it.\"\n\n\"Very well. Stake another four thousand gulden upon the red. Take this\nbanknote to do it with. I have still got twenty thousand roubles in\nactual cash.\"\n\n\"But,\" I whispered, \"such a quantity of money--\"\n\n\"Never mind. I cannot rest until I have won back my losses. Stake!\"\n\nI staked, and we lost.\n\n\"Stake again, stake again--eight thousand at a stroke!\"\n\n\"I cannot, Madame. The largest stake allowed is four thousand gulden.\"\n\n\"Well, then; stake four thousand.\"\n\nThis time we won, and the Grandmother recovered herself a little.\n\n\"You see, you see!\" she exclaimed as she nudged me. \"Stake another four\nthousand.\"\n\nI did so, and lost. Again, and yet again, we lost. \"Madame, your twelve\nthousand gulden are now gone,\" at length I reported.\n\n\"I see they are,\" she replied with, as it were, the calmness of\ndespair. \"I see they are,\" she muttered again as she gazed straight in\nfront of her, like a person lost in thought. \"Ah well, I do not mean to\nrest until I have staked another four thousand.\"\n\n\"But you have no money with which to do it, Madame. In this satchel I\ncan see only a few five percent bonds and some transfers--no actual\ncash.\"\n\n\"And in the purse?\"\n\n\"A mere trifle.\"\n\n\"But there is a money-changer's office here, is there not? They told me\nI should be able to get any sort of paper security changed!\"\n\n\"Quite so; to any amount you please. But you will lose on the\ntransaction what would frighten even a Jew.\"\n\n\"Rubbish! I am DETERMINED to retrieve my losses. Take me away, and call\nthose fools of bearers.\"\n\nI wheeled the chair out of the throng, and, the bearers making their\nappearance, we left the Casino.\n\n\"Hurry, hurry!\" commanded the Grandmother. \"Show me the nearest way to\nthe money-changer's. Is it far?\"\n\n\"A couple of steps, Madame.\"\n\nAt the turning from the square into the Avenue we came face to face\nwith the whole of our party--the General, De Griers, Mlle. Blanche, and\nher mother. Only Polina and Mr. Astley were absent.\n\n\"Well, well, well!\" exclaimed the Grandmother. \"But we have no time to\nstop. What do you want? I can't talk to you here.\"\n\nI dropped behind a little, and immediately was pounced upon by De\nGriers.\n\n\"She has lost this morning's winnings,\" I whispered, \"and also twelve\nthousand gulden of her original money. At the present moment we are\ngoing to get some bonds changed.\"\n\nDe Griers stamped his foot with vexation, and hastened to communicate\nthe tidings to the General. Meanwhile we continued to wheel the old\nlady along.\n\n\"Stop her, stop her,\" whispered the General in consternation.\n\n\"You had better try and stop her yourself,\" I returned--also in a\nwhisper.\n\n\"My good mother,\" he said as he approached her, \"--my good mother, pray\nlet, let--\" (his voice was beginning to tremble and sink) \"--let us\nhire a carriage, and go for a drive. Near here there is an enchanting\nview to be obtained. We-we-we were just coming to invite you to go and\nsee it.\"\n\n\"Begone with you and your views!\" said the Grandmother angrily as she\nwaved him away.\n\n\"And there are trees there, and we could have tea under them,\"\ncontinued the General--now in utter despair.\n\n\"Nous boirons du lait, sur l'herbe fraiche,\" added De Griers with the\nsnarl almost of a wild beast.\n\n\"Du lait, de l'herbe fraiche\"--the idyll, the ideal of the Parisian\nbourgeois--his whole outlook upon \"la nature et la verite\"!\n\n\"Have done with you and your milk!\" cried the old lady. \"Go and stuff\nYOURSELF as much as you like, but my stomach simply recoils from the\nidea. What are you stopping for? I have nothing to say to you.\"\n\n\"Here we are, Madame,\" I announced. \"Here is the moneychanger's office.\"\n\nI entered to get the securities changed, while the Grandmother remained\noutside in the porch, and the rest waited at a little distance, in\ndoubt as to their best course of action. At length the old lady turned\nsuch an angry stare upon them that they departed along the road towards\nthe Casino.\n\nThe process of changing involved complicated calculations which soon\nnecessitated my return to the Grandmother for instructions.\n\n\"The thieves!\" she exclaimed as she clapped her hands together. \"Never\nmind, though. Get the documents cashed--No; send the banker out to me,\"\nshe added as an afterthought.\n\n\"Would one of the clerks do, Madame?\"\n\n\"Yes, one of the clerks. The thieves!\"\n\nThe clerk consented to come out when he perceived that he was being\nasked for by an old lady who was too infirm to walk; after which the\nGrandmother began to upbraid him at length, and with great vehemence,\nfor his alleged usuriousness, and to bargain with him in a mixture of\nRussian, French, and German--I acting as interpreter. Meanwhile, the\ngrave-faced official eyed us both, and silently nodded his head. At the\nGrandmother, in particular, he gazed with a curiosity which almost\nbordered upon rudeness. At length, too, he smiled.\n\n\"Pray recollect yourself!\" cried the old lady. \"And may my money choke\nyou! Alexis Ivanovitch, tell him that we can easily repair to someone\nelse.\"\n\n\"The clerk says that others will give you even less than he.\"\n\nOf what the ultimate calculations consisted I do not exactly remember,\nbut at all events they were alarming. Receiving twelve thousand florins\nin gold, I took also the statement of accounts, and carried it out to\nthe Grandmother.\n\n\"Well, well,\" she said, \"I am no accountant. Let us hurry away, hurry\naway.\" And she waved the paper aside.\n\n\"Neither upon that accursed zero, however, nor upon that equally\naccursed red do I mean to stake a cent,\" I muttered to myself as I\nentered the Casino.\n\nThis time I did all I could to persuade the old lady to stake as little\nas possible--saying that a turn would come in the chances when she\nwould be at liberty to stake more. But she was so impatient that,\nthough at first she agreed to do as I suggested, nothing could stop her\nwhen once she had begun. By way of prelude she won stakes of a hundred\nand two hundred gulden.\n\n\"There you are!\" she said as she nudged me. \"See what we have won!\nSurely it would be worth our while to stake four thousand instead of a\nhundred, for we might win another four thousand, and then--! Oh, it was\nYOUR fault before--all your fault!\"\n\nI felt greatly put out as I watched her play, but I decided to hold my\ntongue, and to give her no more advice.\n\nSuddenly De Griers appeared on the scene. It seemed that all this while\nhe and his companions had been standing beside us--though I noticed\nthat Mlle. Blanche had withdrawn a little from the rest, and was\nengaged in flirting with the Prince. Clearly the General was greatly\nput out at this. Indeed, he was in a perfect agony of vexation. But\nMlle. was careful never to look his way, though he did his best to\nattract her notice. Poor General! By turns his face blanched and\nreddened, and he was trembling to such an extent that he could scarcely\nfollow the old lady's play. At length Mlle. and the Prince took their\ndeparture, and the General followed them.\n\n\"Madame, Madame,\" sounded the honeyed accents of De Griers as he leant\nover to whisper in the Grandmother's ear. \"That stake will never win.\nNo, no, it is impossible,\" he added in Russian with a writhe. \"No, no!\"\n\n\"But why not?\" asked the Grandmother, turning round. \"Show me what I\nought to do.\"\n\nInstantly De Griers burst into a babble of French as he advised, jumped\nabout, declared that such and such chances ought to be waited for, and\nstarted to make calculations of figures. All this he addressed to me in\nmy capacity as translator--tapping the table the while with his finger,\nand pointing hither and thither. At length he seized a pencil, and\nbegan to reckon sums on paper until he had exhausted the Grandmother's\npatience.\n\n\"Away with you!\" she interrupted. \"You talk sheer nonsense, for, though\nyou keep on saying 'Madame, Madame,' you haven't the least notion what\nought to be done. Away with you, I say!\"\n\n\"Mais, Madame,\" cooed De Griers--and straightway started afresh with\nhis fussy instructions.\n\n\"Stake just ONCE, as he advises,\" the Grandmother said to me, \"and then\nwe shall see what we shall see. Of course, his stake MIGHT win.\"\n\nAs a matter of fact, De Grier's one object was to distract the old lady\nfrom staking large sums; wherefore, he now suggested to her that she\nshould stake upon certain numbers, singly and in groups. Consequently,\nin accordance with his instructions, I staked a ten-gulden piece upon\nseveral odd numbers in the first twenty, and five ten-gulden pieces\nupon certain groups of numbers-groups of from twelve to eighteen, and\nfrom eighteen to twenty-four. The total staked amounted to 160 gulden.\n\nThe wheel revolved. \"Zero!\" cried the croupier.\n\nWe had lost it all!\n\n\"The fool!\" cried the old lady as she turned upon De Griers. \"You\ninfernal Frenchman, to think that you should advise! Away with you!\nThough you fuss and fuss, you don't even know what you're talking\nabout.\"\n\nDeeply offended, De Griers shrugged his shoulders, favoured the\nGrandmother with a look of contempt, and departed. For some time past\nhe had been feeling ashamed of being seen in such company, and this had\nproved the last straw.\n\nAn hour later we had lost everything in hand.\n\n\"Home!\" cried the Grandmother.\n\nNot until we had turned into the Avenue did she utter a word; but from\nthat point onwards, until we arrived at the hotel, she kept venting\nexclamations of \"What a fool I am! What a silly old fool I am, to be\nsure!\"\n\nArrived at the hotel, she called for tea, and then gave orders for her\nluggage to be packed.\n\n\"We are off again,\" she announced.\n\n\"But whither, Madame?\" inquired Martha.\n\n\"What business is that of YOURS? Let the cricket stick to its hearth.\n[The Russian form of \"Mind your own business.\"] Potapitch, have\neverything packed, for we are returning to Moscow at once. I have\nfooled away fifteen thousand roubles.\"\n\n\"Fifteen thousand roubles, good mistress? My God!\" And Potapitch spat\nupon his hands--probably to show that he was ready to serve her in any\nway he could.\n\n\"Now then, you fool! At once you begin with your weeping and wailing!\nBe quiet, and pack. Also, run downstairs, and get my hotel bill.\"\n\n\"The next train leaves at 9:30, Madame,\" I interposed, with a view to\nchecking her agitation.\n\n\"And what is the time now?\"\n\n\"Half-past eight.\"\n\n\"How vexing! But, never mind. Alexis Ivanovitch, I have not a kopeck\nleft; I have but these two bank notes. Please run to the office and get\nthem changed. Otherwise I shall have nothing to travel with.\"\n\nDeparting on her errand, I returned half an hour later to find the\nwhole party gathered in her rooms. It appeared that the news of her\nimpending departure for Moscow had thrown the conspirators into\nconsternation even greater than her losses had done. For, said they,\neven if her departure should save her fortune, what will become of the\nGeneral later? And who is to repay De Griers? Clearly Mlle. Blanche\nwould never consent to wait until the Grandmother was dead, but would\nat once elope with the Prince or someone else. So they had all gathered\ntogether--endeavouring to calm and dissuade the Grandmother. Only\nPolina was absent. For her part the Grandmother had nothing for the\nparty but abuse.\n\n\"Away with you, you rascals!\" she was shouting. \"What have my affairs\nto do with you? Why, in particular, do you\"--here she indicated De\nGriers--\"come sneaking here with your goat's beard? And what do\nYOU\"--here she turned to Mlle. Blanche \"want of me? What are YOU\nfinicking for?\"\n\n\"Diantre!\" muttered Mlle. under her breath, but her eyes were flashing.\nThen all at once she burst into a laugh and left the room--crying to\nthe General as she did so: \"Elle vivra cent ans!\"\n\n\"So you have been counting upon my death, have you?\" fumed the old\nlady. \"Away with you! Clear them out of the room, Alexis Ivanovitch.\nWhat business is it of THEIRS? It is not THEIR money that I have been\nsquandering, but my own.\"\n\nThe General shrugged his shoulders, bowed, and withdrew, with De Griers\nbehind him.\n\n\"Call Prascovia,\" commanded the Grandmother, and in five minutes Martha\nreappeared with Polina, who had been sitting with the children in her\nown room (having purposely determined not to leave it that day). Her\nface looked grave and careworn.\n\n\"Prascovia,\" began the Grandmother, \"is what I have just heard through\na side wind true--namely, that this fool of a stepfather of yours is\ngoing to marry that silly whirligig of a Frenchwoman--that actress, or\nsomething worse? Tell me, is it true?\"\n\n\"I do not know FOR CERTAIN, Grandmamma,\" replied Polina; \"but from\nMlle. Blanche's account (for she does not appear to think it necessary\nto conceal anything) I conclude that--\"\n\n\"You need not say any more,\" interrupted the Grandmother energetically.\n\"I understand the situation. I always thought we should get something\nlike this from him, for I always looked upon him as a futile, frivolous\nfellow who gave himself unconscionable airs on the fact of his being a\ngeneral (though he only became one because he retired as a colonel).\nYes, I know all about the sending of the telegrams to inquire whether\n'the old woman is likely to turn up her toes soon.' Ah, they were\nlooking for the legacies! Without money that wretched woman (what is\nher name?--Oh, De Cominges) would never dream of accepting the General\nand his false teeth--no, not even for him to be her lacquey--since she\nherself, they say, possesses a pile of money, and lends it on interest,\nand makes a good thing out of it. However, it is not you, Prascovia,\nthat I am blaming; it was not you who sent those telegrams. Nor, for\nthat matter, do I wish to recall old scores. True, I know that you are\na vixen by nature--that you are a wasp which will sting one if one\ntouches it--yet, my heart is sore for you, for I loved your mother,\nKaterina. Now, will you leave everything here, and come away with me?\nOtherwise, I do not know what is to become of you, and it is not right\nthat you should continue living with these people. Nay,\" she\ninterposed, the moment that Polina attempted to speak, \"I have not yet\nfinished. I ask of you nothing in return. My house in Moscow is, as you\nknow, large enough for a palace, and you could occupy a whole floor of\nit if you liked, and keep away from me for weeks together. Will you\ncome with me or will you not?\"\n\n\"First of all, let me ask of YOU,\" replied Polina, \"whether you are\nintending to depart at once?\"\n\n\"What? You suppose me to be jesting? I have said that I am going, and I\nAM going. Today I have squandered fifteen thousand roubles at that\naccursed roulette of yours, and though, five years ago, I promised the\npeople of a certain suburb of Moscow to build them a stone church in\nplace of a wooden one, I have been fooling away my money here! However,\nI am going back now to build my church.\"\n\n\"But what about the waters, Grandmamma? Surely you came here to take\nthe waters?\"\n\n\"You and your waters! Do not anger me, Prascovia. Surely you are trying\nto? Say, then: will you, or will you not, come with me?\"\n\n\"Grandmamma,\" Polina replied with deep feeling, \"I am very, very\ngrateful to you for the shelter which you have so kindly offered me.\nAlso, to a certain extent you have guessed my position aright, and I am\nbeholden to you to such an extent that it may be that I will come and\nlive with you, and that very soon; yet there are important reasons\nwhy--why I cannot make up my mind just yet. If you would let me have,\nsay, a couple of weeks to decide in--?\"\n\n\"You mean that you are NOT coming?\"\n\n\"I mean only that I cannot come just yet. At all events, I could not\nwell leave my little brother and sister here, since, since--if I were\nto leave them--they would be abandoned altogether. But if, Grandmamma,\nyou would take the little ones AND myself, then, of course, I could\ncome with you, and would do all I could to serve you\" (this she said\nwith great earnestness). \"Only, without the little ones I CANNOT come.\"\n\n\"Do not make a fuss\" (as a matter of fact Polina never at any time\neither fussed or wept). \"The Great Foster--Father [Translated\nliterally--The Great Poulterer] can find for all his chicks a place.\nYou are not coming without the children? But see here, Prascovia. I\nwish you well, and nothing but well: yet I have divined the reason why\nyou will not come. Yes, I know all, Prascovia. That Frenchman will\nnever bring you good of any sort.\"\n\nPolina coloured hotly, and even I started. \"For,\" thought I to myself,\n\"every one seems to know about that affair. Or perhaps I am the only\none who does not know about it?\"\n\n\"Now, now! Do not frown,\" continued the Grandmother. \"But I do not\nintend to slur things over. You will take care that no harm befalls\nyou, will you not? For you are a girl of sense, and I am sorry for\nyou--I regard you in a different light to the rest of them. And now,\nplease, leave me. Good-bye.\"\n\n\"But let me stay with you a little longer,\" said Polina.\n\n\"No,\" replied the other; \"you need not. Do not bother me, for you and\nall of them have tired me out.\"\n\nYet when Polina tried to kiss the Grandmother's hand, the old lady\nwithdrew it, and herself kissed the girl on the cheek. As she passed\nme, Polina gave me a momentary glance, and then as swiftly averted her\neyes.\n\n\"And good-bye to you, also, Alexis Ivanovitch. The train starts in an\nhour's time, and I think that you must be weary of me. Take these five\nhundred gulden for yourself.\"\n\n\"I thank you humbly, Madame, but I am ashamed to--\"\n\n\"Come, come!\" cried the Grandmother so energetically, and with such an\nair of menace, that I did not dare refuse the money further.\n\n\"If, when in Moscow, you have no place where you can lay your head,\"\nshe added, \"come and see me, and I will give you a recommendation. Now,\nPotapitch, get things ready.\"\n\nI ascended to my room, and lay down upon the bed. A whole hour I must\nhave lain thus, with my head resting upon my hand. So the crisis had\ncome! I needed time for its consideration. To-morrow I would have a\ntalk with Polina. Ah! The Frenchman! So, it was true? But how could it\nbe so? Polina and De Griers! What a combination!\n\nNo, it was too improbable. Suddenly I leapt up with the idea of seeking\nAstley and forcing him to speak. There could be no doubt that he knew\nmore than I did. Astley? Well, he was another problem for me to solve.\n\nSuddenly there came a knock at the door, and I opened it to find\nPotapitch awaiting me.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"my mistress is asking for you.\"\n\n\"Indeed? But she is just departing, is she not? The train leaves in ten\nminutes' time.\"\n\n\"She is uneasy, sir; she cannot rest. Come quickly, sir; do not delay.\"\n\nI ran downstairs at once. The Grandmother was just being carried out of\nher rooms into the corridor. In her hands she held a roll of bank-notes.\n\n\"Alexis Ivanovitch,\" she cried, \"walk on ahead, and we will set out\nagain.\"\n\n\"But whither, Madame?\"\n\n\"I cannot rest until I have retrieved my losses. March on ahead, and\nask me no questions. Play continues until midnight, does it not?\"\n\nFor a moment I stood stupefied--stood deep in thought; but it was not\nlong before I had made up my mind.\n\n\"With your leave, Madame,\" I said, \"I will not go with you.\"\n\n\"And why not? What do you mean? Is every one here a stupid\ngood-for-nothing?\"\n\n\"Pardon me, but I have nothing to reproach myself with. I merely will\nnot go. I merely intend neither to witness nor to join in your play. I\nalso beg to return you your five hundred gulden. Farewell.\"\n\nLaying the money upon a little table which the Grandmother's chair\nhappened to be passing, I bowed and withdrew.\n\n\"What folly!\" the Grandmother shouted after me. \"Very well, then. Do\nnot come, and I will find my way alone. Potapitch, you must come with\nme. Lift up the chair, and carry me along.\"\n\nI failed to find Mr. Astley, and returned home. It was now growing\nlate--it was past midnight, but I subsequently learnt from Potapitch\nhow the Grandmother's day had ended. She had lost all the money which,\nearlier in the day, I had got for her paper securities--a sum amounting\nto about ten thousand roubles. This she did under the direction of the\nPole whom, that afternoon, she had dowered with two ten-gulden pieces.\nBut before his arrival on the scene, she had commanded Potapitch to\nstake for her; until at length she had told him also to go about his\nbusiness. Upon that the Pole had leapt into the breach. Not only did it\nhappen that he knew the Russian language, but also he could speak a\nmixture of three different dialects, so that the pair were able to\nunderstand one another. Yet the old lady never ceased to abuse him,\ndespite his deferential manner, and to compare him unfavourably with\nmyself (so, at all events, Potapitch declared). \"You,\" the old\nchamberlain said to me, \"treated her as a gentleman should, but he--he\nrobbed her right and left, as I could see with my own eyes. Twice she\ncaught him at it, and rated him soundly. On one occasion she even\npulled his hair, so that the bystanders burst out laughing. Yet she\nlost everything, sir--that is to say, she lost all that you had changed\nfor her. Then we brought her home, and, after asking for some water and\nsaying her prayers, she went to bed. So worn out was she that she fell\nasleep at once. May God send her dreams of angels! And this is all that\nforeign travel has done for us! Oh, my own Moscow! For what have we not\nat home there, in Moscow? Such a garden and flowers as you could never\nsee here, and fresh air and apple-trees coming into blossom,--and a\nbeautiful view to look upon. Ah, but what must she do but go travelling\nabroad? Alack, alack!\"\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nAlmost a month has passed since I last touched these notes--notes which\nI began under the influence of impressions at once poignant and\ndisordered. The crisis which I then felt to be approaching has now\narrived, but in a form a hundred times more extensive and unexpected\nthan I had looked for. To me it all seems strange, uncouth, and tragic.\nCertain occurrences have befallen me which border upon the marvellous.\nAt all events, that is how I view them. I view them so in one regard at\nleast. I refer to the whirlpool of events in which, at the time, I was\nrevolving. But the most curious feature of all is my relation to those\nevents, for hitherto I had never clearly understood myself. Yet now the\nactual crisis has passed away like a dream. Even my passion for Polina\nis dead. Was it ever so strong and genuine as I thought? If so, what\nhas become of it now? At times I fancy that I must be mad; that\nsomewhere I am sitting in a madhouse; that these events have merely\nSEEMED to happen; that still they merely SEEM to be happening.\n\nI have been arranging and re-perusing my notes (perhaps for the purpose\nof convincing myself that I am not in a madhouse). At present I am\nlonely and alone. Autumn is coming--already it is mellowing the leaves;\nand, as I sit brooding in this melancholy little town (and how\nmelancholy the little towns of Germany can be!), I find myself taking\nno thought for the future, but living under the influence of passing\nmoods, and of my recollections of the tempest which recently drew me\ninto its vortex, and then cast me out again. At times I seem still to\nbe caught within that vortex. At times, the tempest seems once more to\nbe gathering, and, as it passes overhead, to be wrapping me in its\nfolds, until I have lost my sense of order and reality, and continue\nwhirling and whirling and whirling around.\n\nYet, it may be that I shall be able to stop myself from revolving if\nonce I can succeed in rendering myself an exact account of what has\nhappened within the month just past. Somehow I feel drawn towards the\npen; on many and many an evening I have had nothing else in the world\nto do. But, curiously enough, of late I have taken to amusing myself\nwith the works of M. Paul de Kock, which I read in German translations\nobtained from a wretched local library. These works I cannot abide, yet\nI read them, and find myself marvelling that I should be doing so.\nSomehow I seem to be afraid of any SERIOUS book--afraid of permitting\nany SERIOUS preoccupation to break the spell of the passing moment. So\ndear to me is the formless dream of which I have spoken, so dear to me\nare the impressions which it has left behind it, that I fear to touch\nthe vision with anything new, lest it should dissolve in smoke. But is\nit so dear to me? Yes, it IS dear to me, and will ever be fresh in my\nrecollections--even forty years hence....\n\nSo let me write of it, but only partially, and in a more abridged form\nthan my full impressions might warrant.\n\nFirst of all, let me conclude the history of the Grandmother. Next day\nshe lost every gulden that she possessed. Things were bound to happen\nso, for persons of her type who have once entered upon that road\ndescend it with ever-increasing rapidity, even as a sledge descends a\ntoboggan-slide. All day until eight o'clock that evening did she play;\nand, though I personally did not witness her exploits, I learnt of them\nlater through report.\n\nAll that day Potapitch remained in attendance upon her; but the Poles\nwho directed her play she changed more than once. As a beginning she\ndismissed her Pole of the previous day--the Pole whose hair she had\npulled--and took to herself another one; but the latter proved worse\neven than the former, and incurred dismissal in favour of the first\nPole, who, during the time of his unemployment, had nevertheless\nhovered around the Grandmother's chair, and from time to time obtruded\nhis head over her shoulder. At length the old lady became desperate,\nfor the second Pole, when dismissed, imitated his predecessor by\ndeclining to go away; with the result that one Pole remained standing\non the right of the victim, and the other on her left; from which\nvantage points the pair quarrelled, abused each other concerning the\nstakes and rounds, and exchanged the epithet \"laidak\" [Rascal] and\nother Polish terms of endearment. Finally, they effected a mutual\nreconciliation, and, tossing the money about anyhow, played simply at\nrandom. Once more quarrelling, each of them staked money on his own\nside of the Grandmother's chair (for instance, the one Pole staked upon\nthe red, and the other one upon the black), until they had so confused\nand browbeaten the old lady that, nearly weeping, she was forced to\nappeal to the head croupier for protection, and to have the two Poles\nexpelled. No time was lost in this being done, despite the rascals'\ncries and protestations that the old lady was in their debt, that she\nhad cheated them, and that her general behaviour had been mean and\ndishonourable. The same evening the unfortunate Potapitch related the\nstory to me with tears complaining that the two men had filled their\npockets with money (he himself had seen them do it) which had been\nshamelessly pilfered from his mistress. For instance, one Pole demanded\nof the Grandmother fifty gulden for his trouble, and then staked the\nmoney by the side of her stake. She happened to win; whereupon he cried\nout that the winning stake was his, and hers the loser. As soon as the\ntwo Poles had been expelled, Potapitch left the room, and reported to\nthe authorities that the men's pockets were full of gold; and, on the\nGrandmother also requesting the head croupier to look into the affair,\nthe police made their appearance, and, despite the protests of the\nPoles (who, indeed, had been caught redhanded), their pockets were\nturned inside out, and the contents handed over to the Grandmother. In\nfact, in, view of the circumstance that she lost all day, the croupiers\nand other authorities of the Casino showed her every attention; and on\nher fame spreading through the town, visitors of every\nnationality--even the most knowing of them, the most\ndistinguished--crowded to get a glimpse of \"la vieille comtesse russe,\ntombee en enfance,\" who had lost \"so many millions.\"\n\nYet with the money which the authorities restored to her from the\npockets of the Poles the Grandmother effected very, very little, for\nthere soon arrived to take his countrymen's place, a third Pole--a man\nwho could speak Russian fluently, was dressed like a gentleman (albeit\nin lacqueyish fashion), and sported a huge moustache. Though polite\nenough to the old lady, he took a high hand with the bystanders. In\nshort, he offered himself less as a servant than as an ENTERTAINER.\nAfter each round he would turn to the old lady, and swear terrible\noaths to the effect that he was a \"Polish gentleman of honour\" who\nwould scorn to take a kopeck of her money; and, though he repeated\nthese oaths so often that at length she grew alarmed, he had her play\nin hand, and began to win on her behalf; wherefore, she felt that she\ncould not well get rid of him. An hour later the two Poles who, earlier\nin the day, had been expelled from the Casino, made a reappearance\nbehind the old lady's chair, and renewed their offers of service--even\nif it were only to be sent on messages; but from Potapitch I\nsubsequently had it that between these rascals and the said \"gentleman\nof honour\" there passed a wink, as well as that the latter put\nsomething into their hands. Next, since the Grandmother had not yet\nlunched--she had scarcely for a moment left her chair--one of the two\nPoles ran to the restaurant of the Casino, and brought her thence a cup\nof soup, and afterwards some tea. In fact, BOTH the Poles hastened to\nperform this office. Finally, towards the close of the day, when it was\nclear that the Grandmother was about to play her last bank-note, there\ncould be seen standing behind her chair no fewer than six natives of\nPoland--persons who, as yet, had been neither audible nor visible; and\nas soon as ever the old lady played the note in question, they took no\nfurther notice of her, but pushed their way past her chair to the\ntable; seized the money, and staked it--shouting and disputing the\nwhile, and arguing with the \"gentleman of honour\" (who also had\nforgotten the Grandmother's existence), as though he were their equal.\nEven when the Grandmother had lost her all, and was returning (about\neight o'clock) to the hotel, some three or four Poles could not bring\nthemselves to leave her, but went on running beside her chair and\nvolubly protesting that the Grandmother had cheated them, and that she\nought to be made to surrender what was not her own. Thus the party\narrived at the hotel; whence, presently, the gang of rascals was\nejected neck and crop.\n\nAccording to Potapitch's calculations, the Grandmother lost, that day,\na total of ninety thousand roubles, in addition to the money which she\nhad lost the day before. Every paper security which she had brought\nwith her--five percent bonds, internal loan scrip, and what not--she\nhad changed into cash. Also, I could not but marvel at the way in\nwhich, for seven or eight hours at a stretch, she sat in that chair of\nhers, almost never leaving the table. Again, Potapitch told me that\nthere were three occasions on which she really began to win; but that,\nled on by false hopes, she was unable to tear herself away at the right\nmoment. Every gambler knows how a person may sit a day and a night at\ncards without ever casting a glance to right or to left.\n\nMeanwhile, that day some other very important events were passing in\nour hotel. As early as eleven o'clock--that is to say, before the\nGrandmother had quitted her rooms--the General and De Griers decided\nupon their last stroke. In other words, on learning that the old lady\nhad changed her mind about departing, and was bent on setting out for\nthe Casino again, the whole of our gang (Polina only excepted)\nproceeded en masse to her rooms, for the purpose of finally and frankly\ntreating with her. But the General, quaking and greatly apprehensive as\nto his possible future, overdid things. After half an hour's prayers\nand entreaties, coupled with a full confession of his debts, and even\nof his passion for Mlle. Blanche (yes, he had quite lost his head), he\nsuddenly adopted a tone of menace, and started to rage at the old\nlady--exclaiming that she was sullying the family honour, that she was\nmaking a public scandal of herself, and that she was smirching the fair\nname of Russia. The upshot was that the Grandmother turned him out of\nthe room with her stick (it was a real stick, too!). Later in the\nmorning he held several consultations with De Griers--the question\nwhich occupied him being: Is it in any way possible to make use of the\npolice--to tell them that \"this respected, but unfortunate, old lady\nhas gone out of her mind, and is squandering her last kopeck,\" or\nsomething of the kind? In short, is it in any way possible to engineer\na species of supervision over, or of restraint upon, the old lady? De\nGriers, however, shrugged his shoulders at this, and laughed in the\nGeneral's face, while the old warrior went on chattering volubly, and\nrunning up and down his study. Finally De Griers waved his hand, and\ndisappeared from view; and by evening it became known that he had left\nthe hotel, after holding a very secret and important conference with\nMlle. Blanche. As for the latter, from early morning she had taken\ndecisive measures, by completely excluding the General from her\npresence, and bestowing upon him not a glance. Indeed, even when the\nGeneral pursued her to the Casino, and met her walking arm in arm with\nthe Prince, he (the General) received from her and her mother not the\nslightest recognition. Nor did the Prince himself bow. The rest of the\nday Mlle. spent in probing the Prince, and trying to make him declare\nhimself; but in this she made a woeful mistake. The little incident\noccurred in the evening. Suddenly Mlle. Blanche realised that the\nPrince had not even a copper to his name, but, on the contrary, was\nminded to borrow of her money wherewith to play at roulette. In high\ndispleasure she drove him from her presence, and shut herself up in her\nroom.\n\nThe same morning I went to see--or, rather, to look for--Mr. Astley,\nbut was unsuccessful in my quest. Neither in his rooms nor in the\nCasino nor in the Park was he to be found; nor did he, that day, lunch\nat his hotel as usual. However, at about five o'clock I caught sight of\nhim walking from the railway station to the Hotel d'Angleterre. He\nseemed to be in a great hurry and much preoccupied, though in his face\nI could discern no actual traces of worry or perturbation. He held out\nto me a friendly hand, with his usual ejaculation of \"Ah!\" but did not\ncheck his stride. I turned and walked beside him, but found, somehow,\nthat his answers forbade any putting of definite questions. Moreover, I\nfelt reluctant to speak to him of Polina; nor, for his part, did he ask\nme any questions concerning her, although, on my telling him of the\nGrandmother's exploits, he listened attentively and gravely, and then\nshrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"She is gambling away everything that she has,\" I remarked.\n\n\"Indeed? She arrived at the Casino even before I had taken my departure\nby train, so I knew she had been playing. If I should have time I will\ngo to the Casino to-night, and take a look at her. The thing interests\nme.\"\n\n\"Where have you been today?\" I asked--surprised at myself for having,\nas yet, omitted to put to him that question.\n\n\"To Frankfort.\"\n\n\"On business?\"\n\n\"On business.\"\n\nWhat more was there to be asked after that? I accompanied him until, as\nwe drew level with the Hotel des Quatre Saisons, he suddenly nodded to\nme and disappeared. For myself, I returned home, and came to the\nconclusion that, even had I met him at two o'clock in the afternoon, I\nshould have learnt no more from him than I had done at five o'clock,\nfor the reason that I had no definite question to ask. It was bound to\nhave been so. For me to formulate the query which I really wished to\nput was a simple impossibility.\n\nPolina spent the whole of that day either in walking about the park\nwith the nurse and children or in sitting in her own room. For a long\nwhile past she had avoided the General and had scarcely had a word to\nsay to him (scarcely a word, I mean, on any SERIOUS topic). Yes, that I\nhad noticed. Still, even though I was aware of the position in which\nthe General was placed, it had never occurred to me that he would have\nany reason to avoid HER, or to trouble her with family explanations.\nIndeed, when I was returning to the hotel after my conversation with\nAstley, and chanced to meet Polina and the children, I could see that\nher face was as calm as though the family disturbances had never\ntouched her. To my salute she responded with a slight bow, and I\nretired to my room in a very bad humour.\n\nOf course, since the affair with the Burmergelms I had exchanged not a\nword with Polina, nor had with her any kind of intercourse. Yet I had\nbeen at my wits' end, for, as time went on, there was arising in me an\never-seething dissatisfaction. Even if she did not love me she ought\nnot to have trampled upon my feelings, nor to have accepted my\nconfessions with such contempt, seeing that she must have been aware\nthat I loved her (of her own accord she had allowed me to tell her as\nmuch). Of course the situation between us had arisen in a curious\nmanner. About two months ago, I had noticed that she had a desire to\nmake me her friend, her confidant--that she was making trial of me for\nthe purpose; but, for some reason or another, the desired result had\nnever come about, and we had fallen into the present strange relations,\nwhich had led me to address her as I had done. At the same time, if my\nlove was distasteful to her, why had she not FORBIDDEN me to speak of\nit to her?\n\nBut she had not so forbidden me. On the contrary, there had been\noccasions when she had even INVITED me to speak. Of course, this might\nhave been done out of sheer wantonness, for I well knew--I had remarked\nit only too often--that, after listening to what I had to say, and\nangering me almost beyond endurance, she loved suddenly to torture me\nwith some fresh outburst of contempt and aloofness! Yet she must have\nknown that I could not live without her. Three days had elapsed since\nthe affair with the Baron, and I could bear the severance no longer.\nWhen, that afternoon, I met her near the Casino, my heart almost made\nme faint, it beat so violently. She too could not live without me, for\nhad she not said that she had NEED of me? Or had that too been spoken\nin jest?\n\nThat she had a secret of some kind there could be no doubt. What she\nhad said to the Grandmother had stabbed me to the heart. On a thousand\noccasions I had challenged her to be open with me, nor could she have\nbeen ignorant that I was ready to give my very life for her. Yet always\nshe had kept me at a distance with that contemptuous air of hers; or\nelse she had demanded of me, in lieu of the life which I offered to lay\nat her feet, such escapades as I had perpetrated with the Baron. Ah,\nwas it not torture to me, all this? For could it be that her whole\nworld was bound up with the Frenchman? What, too, about Mr. Astley? The\naffair was inexplicable throughout. My God, what distress it caused me!\n\nArrived home, I, in a fit of frenzy, indited the following:\n\n\"Polina Alexandrovna, I can see that there is approaching us an\nexposure which will involve you too. For the last time I ask of\nyou--have you, or have you not, any need of my life? If you have, then\nmake such dispositions as you wish, and I shall always be discoverable\nin my room if required. If you have need of my life, write or send for\nme.\"\n\nI sealed the letter, and dispatched it by the hand of a corridor\nlacquey, with orders to hand it to the addressee in person. Though I\nexpected no answer, scarcely three minutes had elapsed before the\nlacquey returned with \"the compliments of a certain person.\"\n\nNext, about seven o'clock, I was sent for by the General. I found him\nin his study, apparently preparing to go out again, for his hat and\nstick were lying on the sofa. When I entered he was standing in the\nmiddle of the room--his feet wide apart, and his head bent down. Also,\nhe appeared to be talking to himself. But as soon as ever he saw me at\nthe door he came towards me in such a curious manner that involuntarily\nI retreated a step, and was for leaving the room; whereupon he seized\nme by both hands, and, drawing me towards the sofa, and seating himself\nthereon, he forced me to sit down on a chair opposite him. Then,\nwithout letting go of my hands, he exclaimed with quivering lips and a\nsparkle of tears on his eyelashes:\n\n\"Oh, Alexis Ivanovitch! Save me, save me! Have some mercy upon me!\"\n\nFor a long time I could not make out what he meant, although he kept\ntalking and talking, and constantly repeating to himself, \"Have mercy,\nmercy!\" At length, however, I divined that he was expecting me to give\nhim something in the nature of advice--or, rather, that, deserted by\nevery one, and overwhelmed with grief and apprehension, he had\nbethought himself of my existence, and sent for me to relieve his\nfeelings by talking and talking and talking.\n\nIn fact, he was in such a confused and despondent state of mind that,\nclasping his hands together, he actually went down upon his knees and\nbegged me to go to Mlle. Blanche, and beseech and advise her to return\nto him, and to accept him in marriage.\n\n\"But, General,\" I exclaimed, \"possibly Mlle. Blanche has scarcely even\nremarked my existence? What could I do with her?\"\n\nIt was in vain that I protested, for he could understand nothing that\nwas said to him, Next he started talking about the Grandmother, but\nalways in a disconnected sort of fashion--his one thought being to send\nfor the police.\n\n\"In Russia,\" said he, suddenly boiling over with indignation, \"or in\nany well-ordered State where there exists a government, old women like\nmy mother are placed under proper guardianship. Yes, my good sir,\" he\nwent on, relapsing into a scolding tone as he leapt to his feet and\nstarted to pace the room, \"do you not know this\" (he seemed to be\naddressing some imaginary auditor in the corner) \"--do you not know\nthis, that in Russia old women like her are subjected to restraint, the\ndevil take them?\" Again he threw himself down upon the sofa.\n\nA minute later, though sobbing and almost breathless, he managed to\ngasp out that Mlle. Blanche had refused to marry him, for the reason\nthat the Grandmother had turned up in place of a telegram, and it was\ntherefore clear that he had no inheritance to look for. Evidently, he\nsupposed that I had hitherto been in entire ignorance of all this.\nAgain, when I referred to De Griers, the General made a gesture of\ndespair. \"He has gone away,\" he said, \"and everything which I possess\nis mortgaged to him. I stand stripped to my skin. Even of the money\nwhich you brought me from Paris, I know not if seven hundred francs be\nleft. Of course that sum will do to go on with, but, as regards the\nfuture, I know nothing, I know nothing.\"\n\n\"Then how will you pay your hotel bill?\" I cried in consternation. \"And\nwhat shall you do afterwards?\"\n\nHe looked at me vaguely, but it was clear that he had not\nunderstood--perhaps had not even heard--my questions. Then I tried to\nget him to speak of Polina and the children, but he only returned brief\nanswers of \"Yes, yes,\" and again started to maunder about the Prince,\nand the likelihood of the latter marrying Mlle. Blanche. \"What on earth\nam I to do?\" he concluded. \"What on earth am I to do? Is this not\ningratitude? Is it not sheer ingratitude?\" And he burst into tears.\n\nNothing could be done with such a man. Yet to leave him alone was\ndangerous, for something might happen to him. I withdrew from his rooms\nfor a little while, but warned the nursemaid to keep an eye upon him,\nas well as exchanged a word with the corridor lacquey (a very talkative\nfellow), who likewise promised to remain on the look-out.\n\nHardly had I left the General, when Potapitch approached me with a\nsummons from the Grandmother. It was now eight o'clock, and she had\nreturned from the Casino after finally losing all that she possessed. I\nfound her sitting in her chair--much distressed and evidently fatigued.\nPresently Martha brought her up a cup of tea and forced her to drink\nit; yet, even then I could detect in the old lady's tone and manner a\ngreat change.\n\n\"Good evening, Alexis Ivanovitch,\" she said slowly, with her head\ndrooping. \"Pardon me for disturbing you again. Yes, you must pardon an\nold, old woman like myself, for I have left behind me all that I\npossess--nearly a hundred thousand roubles! You did quite right in\ndeclining to come with me this evening. Now I am without money--without\na single groat. But I must not delay a moment; I must leave by the 9:30\ntrain. I have sent for that English friend of yours, and am going to\nbeg of him three thousand francs for a week. Please try and persuade\nhim to think nothing of it, nor yet to refuse me, for I am still a rich\nwoman who possesses three villages and a couple of mansions. Yes, the\nmoney shall be found, for I have not yet squandered EVERYTHING. I tell\nyou this in order that he may have no doubts about--Ah, but here he is!\nClearly he is a good fellow.\"\n\nTrue enough, Astley had come hot-foot on receiving the Grandmother's\nappeal. Scarcely stopping even to reflect, and with scarcely a word, he\ncounted out the three thousand francs under a note of hand which she\nduly signed. Then, his business done, he bowed, and lost no time in\ntaking his departure.\n\n\"You too leave me, Alexis Ivanovitch,\" said the Grandmother. \"All my\nbones are aching, and I still have an hour in which to rest. Do not be\nhard upon me, old fool that I am. Never again shall I blame young\npeople for being frivolous. I should think it wrong even to blame that\nunhappy General of yours. Nevertheless, I do not mean to let him have\nany of my money (which is all that he desires), for the reason that I\nlook upon him as a perfect blockhead, and consider myself, simpleton\nthough I be, at least wiser than HE is. How surely does God visit old\nage, and punish it for its presumption! Well, good-bye. Martha, come\nand lift me up.\"\n\nHowever, I had a mind to see the old lady off; and, moreover, I was in\nan expectant frame of mind--somehow I kept thinking that SOMETHING was\ngoing to happen; wherefore, I could not rest quietly in my room, but\nstepped out into the corridor, and then into the Chestnut Avenue for a\nfew minutes' stroll. My letter to Polina had been clear and firm, and\nin the present crisis, I felt sure, would prove final. I had heard of\nDe Griers' departure, and, however much Polina might reject me as a\nFRIEND, she might not reject me altogether as a SERVANT. She would need\nme to fetch and carry for her, and I was ready to do so. How could it\nhave been otherwise?\n\nTowards the hour of the train's departure I hastened to the station,\nand put the Grandmother into her compartment--she and her party\noccupying a reserved family saloon.\n\n\"Thanks for your disinterested assistance,\" she said at parting. \"Oh,\nand please remind Prascovia of what I said to her last night. I expect\nsoon to see her.\"\n\nThen I returned home. As I was passing the door of the General's suite,\nI met the nursemaid, and inquired after her master. \"There is nothing\nnew to report, sir,\" she replied quietly. Nevertheless I decided to\nenter, and was just doing so when I halted thunderstruck on the\nthreshold. For before me I beheld the General and Mlle.\nBlanche--laughing gaily at one another!--while beside them, on the\nsofa, there was seated her mother. Clearly the General was almost out\nof his mind with joy, for he was talking all sorts of nonsense, and\nbubbling over with a long-drawn, nervous laugh--a laugh which twisted\nhis face into innumerable wrinkles, and caused his eyes almost to\ndisappear.\n\nAfterwards I learnt from Mlle. Blanche herself that, after dismissing\nthe Prince and hearing of the General's tears, she bethought her of\ngoing to comfort the old man, and had just arrived for the purpose when\nI entered. Fortunately, the poor General did not know that his fate had\nbeen decided--that Mlle. had long ago packed her trunks in readiness\nfor the first morning train to Paris!\n\nHesitating a moment on the threshold I changed my mind as to entering,\nand departed unnoticed. Ascending to my own room, and opening the door,\nI perceived in the semi-darkness a figure seated on a chair in the\ncorner by the window. The figure did not rise when I entered, so I\napproached it swiftly, peered at it closely, and felt my heart almost\nstop beating. The figure was Polina!\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nThe shock made me utter an exclamation.\n\n\"What is the matter? What is the matter?\" she asked in a strange voice.\nShe was looking pale, and her eyes were dim.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" I re-echoed. \"Why, the fact that you are HERE!\"\n\n\"If I am here, I have come with all that I have to bring,\" she said.\n\"Such has always been my way, as you shall presently see. Please light\na candle.\"\n\nI did so; whereupon she rose, approached the table, and laid upon it an\nopen letter.\n\n\"Read it,\" she added.\n\n\"It is De Griers' handwriting!\" I cried as I seized the document. My\nhands were so tremulous that the lines on the pages danced before my\neyes. Although, at this distance of time, I have forgotten the exact\nphraseology of the missive, I append, if not the precise words, at all\nevents the general sense.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" the document ran, \"certain untoward circumstances\ncompel me to depart in haste. Of course, you have of yourself remarked\nthat hitherto I have always refrained from having any final explanation\nwith you, for the reason that I could not well state the whole\ncircumstances; and now to my difficulties the advent of the aged\nGrandmother, coupled with her subsequent proceedings, has put the final\ntouch. Also, the involved state of my affairs forbids me to write with\nany finality concerning those hopes of ultimate bliss upon which, for a\nlong while past, I have permitted myself to feed. I regret the past,\nbut at the same time hope that in my conduct you have never been able\nto detect anything that was unworthy of a gentleman and a man of\nhonour. Having lost, however, almost the whole of my money in debts\nincurred by your stepfather, I find myself driven to the necessity of\nsaving the remainder; wherefore, I have instructed certain friends of\nmine in St. Petersburg to arrange for the sale of all the property\nwhich has been mortgaged to myself. At the same time, knowing that, in\naddition, your frivolous stepfather has squandered money which is\nexclusively yours, I have decided to absolve him from a certain moiety\nof the mortgages on his property, in order that you may be in a\nposition to recover of him what you have lost, by suing him in legal\nfashion. I trust, therefore, that, as matters now stand, this action of\nmine may bring you some advantage. I trust also that this same action\nleaves me in the position of having fulfilled every obligation which is\nincumbent upon a man of honour and refinement. Rest assured that your\nmemory will for ever remain graven in my heart.\"\n\n\"All this is clear enough,\" I commented. \"Surely you did not expect\naught else from him?\" Somehow I was feeling annoyed.\n\n\"I expected nothing at all from him,\" she replied--quietly enough, to\nall outward seeming, yet with a note of irritation in her tone. \"Long\nago I made up my mind on the subject, for I could read his thoughts,\nand knew what he was thinking. He thought that possibly I should sue\nhim--that one day I might become a nuisance.\" Here Polina halted for a\nmoment, and stood biting her lips. \"So of set purpose I redoubled my\ncontemptuous treatment of him, and waited to see what he would do. If a\ntelegram to say that we had become legatees had arrived from, St.\nPetersburg, I should have flung at him a quittance for my foolish\nstepfather's debts, and then dismissed him. For a long time I have\nhated him. Even in earlier days he was not a man; and now!--Oh, how\ngladly I could throw those fifty thousand roubles in his face, and spit\nin it, and then rub the spittle in!\"\n\n\"But the document returning the fifty-thousand rouble mortgage--has the\nGeneral got it? If so, possess yourself of it, and send it to De\nGriers.\"\n\n\"No, no; the General has not got it.\"\n\n\"Just as I expected! Well, what is the General going to do?\" Then an\nidea suddenly occurred to me. \"What about the Grandmother?\" I asked.\n\nPolina looked at me with impatience and bewilderment.\n\n\"What makes you speak of HER?\" was her irritable inquiry. \"I cannot go\nand live with her. Nor,\" she added hotly, \"will I go down upon my knees\nto ANY ONE.\"\n\n\"Why should you?\" I cried. \"Yet to think that you should have loved De\nGriers! The villain, the villain! But I will kill him in a duel. Where\nis he now?\"\n\n\"In Frankfort, where he will be staying for the next three days.\"\n\n\"Well, bid me do so, and I will go to him by the first train tomorrow,\"\nI exclaimed with enthusiasm.\n\nShe smiled.\n\n\"If you were to do that,\" she said, \"he would merely tell you to be so\ngood as first to return him the fifty thousand francs. What, then,\nwould be the use of having a quarrel with him? You talk sheer nonsense.\"\n\nI ground my teeth.\n\n\"The question,\" I went on, \"is how to raise the fifty thousand francs.\nWe cannot expect to find them lying about on the floor. Listen. What of\nMr. Astley?\" Even as I spoke a new and strange idea formed itself in my\nbrain.\n\nHer eyes flashed fire.\n\n\"What? YOU YOURSELF wish me to leave you for him?\" she cried with a\nscornful look and a proud smile. Never before had she addressed me thus.\n\nThen her head must have turned dizzy with emotion, for suddenly she\nseated herself upon the sofa, as though she were powerless any longer\nto stand.\n\nA flash of lightning seemed to strike me as I stood there. I could\nscarcely believe my eyes or my ears. She DID love me, then! It WAS to\nme, and not to Mr. Astley, that she had turned! Although she, an\nunprotected girl, had come to me in my room--in an hotel room--and had\nprobably compromised herself thereby, I had not understood!\n\nThen a second mad idea flashed into my brain.\n\n\"Polina,\" I said, \"give me but an hour. Wait here just one hour until I\nreturn. Yes, you MUST do so. Do you not see what I mean? Just stay here\nfor that time.\"\n\nAnd I rushed from the room without so much as answering her look of\ninquiry. She called something after me, but I did not return.\n\nSometimes it happens that the most insane thought, the most impossible\nconception, will become so fixed in one's head that at length one\nbelieves the thought or the conception to be reality. Moreover, if with\nthe thought or the conception there is combined a strong, a passionate,\ndesire, one will come to look upon the said thought or conception as\nsomething fated, inevitable, and foreordained--something bound to\nhappen. Whether by this there is connoted something in the nature of a\ncombination of presentiments, or a great effort of will, or a\nself-annulment of one's true expectations, and so on, I do not know;\nbut, at all events that night saw happen to me (a night which I shall\nnever forget) something in the nature of the miraculous. Although the\noccurrence can easily be explained by arithmetic, I still believe it to\nhave been a miracle. Yet why did this conviction take such a hold upon\nme at the time, and remain with me ever since? Previously, I had\nthought of the idea, not as an occurrence which was ever likely to come\nabout, but as something which NEVER could come about.\n\nThe time was a quarter past eleven o'clock when I entered the Casino in\nsuch a state of hope (though, at the same time, of agitation) as I had\nnever before experienced. In the gaming-rooms there were still a large\nnumber of people, but not half as many as had been present in the\nmorning.\n\nAt eleven o'clock there usually remained behind only the real, the\ndesperate gamblers--persons for whom, at spas, there existed nothing\nbeyond roulette, and who went thither for that alone. These gamesters\ntook little note of what was going on around them, and were interested\nin none of the appurtenances of the season, but played from morning\ntill night, and would have been ready to play through the night until\ndawn had that been possible. As it was, they used to disperse\nunwillingly when, at midnight, roulette came to an end. Likewise, as\nsoon as ever roulette was drawing to a close and the head croupier had\ncalled \"Les trois derniers coups,\" most of them were ready to stake on\nthe last three rounds all that they had in their pockets--and, for the\nmost part, lost it. For my own part I proceeded towards the table at\nwhich the Grandmother had lately sat; and, since the crowd around it\nwas not very large, I soon obtained standing room among the ring of\ngamblers, while directly in front of me, on the green cloth, I saw\nmarked the word \"Passe.\"\n\n\"Passe\" was a row of numbers from 19 to 36 inclusive; while a row of\nnumbers from 1 to 18 inclusive was known as \"Manque.\" But what had that\nto do with me? I had not noticed--I had not so much as heard the\nnumbers upon which the previous coup had fallen, and so took no\nbearings when I began to play, as, in my place, any SYSTEMATIC gambler\nwould have done. No, I merely extended my stock of twenty ten-gulden\npieces, and threw them down upon the space \"Passe\" which happened to be\nconfronting me.\n\n\"Vingt-deux!\" called the croupier.\n\nI had won! I staked upon the same again--both my original stake and my\nwinnings.\n\n\"Trente-et-un!\" called the croupier.\n\nAgain I had won, and was now in possession of eighty ten-gulden pieces.\nNext, I moved the whole eighty on to twelve middle numbers (a stake\nwhich, if successful, would bring me in a triple profit, but also\ninvolved a risk of two chances to one). The wheel revolved, and stopped\nat twenty-four. Upon this I was paid out notes and gold until I had by\nmy side a total sum of two thousand gulden.\n\nIt was as in a fever that I moved the pile, en bloc, on to the red.\nThen suddenly I came to myself (though that was the only time during\nthe evening's play when fear cast its cold spell over me, and showed\nitself in a trembling of the hands and knees). For with horror I had\nrealised that I MUST win, and that upon that stake there depended all\nmy life.\n\n\"Rouge!\" called the croupier. I drew a long breath, and hot shivers\nwent coursing over my body. I was paid out my winnings in\nbank-notes--amounting, of course, to a total of four thousand florins,\neight hundred gulden (I could still calculate the amounts).\n\nAfter that, I remember, I again staked two thousand florins upon twelve\nmiddle numbers, and lost. Again I staked the whole of my gold, with\neight hundred gulden, in notes, and lost. Then madness seemed to come\nupon me, and seizing my last two thousand florins, I staked them upon\ntwelve of the first numbers--wholly by chance, and at random, and\nwithout any sort of reckoning. Upon my doing so there followed a moment\nof suspense only comparable to that which Madame Blanchard must have\nexperienced when, in Paris, she was descending earthwards from a\nballoon.\n\n\"Quatre!\" called the croupier.\n\nOnce more, with the addition of my original stake, I was in possession\nof six thousand florins! Once more I looked around me like a\nconqueror--once more I feared nothing as I threw down four thousand of\nthese florins upon the black. The croupiers glanced around them, and\nexchanged a few words; the bystanders murmured expectantly.\n\nThe black turned up. After that I do not exactly remember either my\ncalculations or the order of my stakings. I only remember that, as in a\ndream, I won in one round sixteen thousand florins; that in the three\nfollowing rounds, I lost twelve thousand; that I moved the remainder\n(four thousand) on to \"Passe\" (though quite unconscious of what I was\ndoing--I was merely waiting, as it were, mechanically, and without\nreflection, for something) and won; and that, finally, four times in\nsuccession I lost. Yes, I can remember raking in money by\nthousands--but most frequently on the twelve, middle numbers, to which\nI constantly adhered, and which kept appearing in a sort of regular\norder--first, three or four times running, and then, after an interval\nof a couple of rounds, in another break of three or four appearances.\nSometimes, this astonishing regularity manifested itself in patches; a\nthing to upset all the calculations of note--taking gamblers who play\nwith a pencil and a memorandum book in their hands Fortune perpetrates\nsome terrible jests at roulette!\n\nSince my entry not more than half an hour could have elapsed. Suddenly\na croupier informed me that I had, won thirty thousand florins, as well\nas that, since the latter was the limit for which, at any one time, the\nbank could make itself responsible, roulette at that table must close\nfor the night. Accordingly, I caught up my pile of gold, stuffed it\ninto my pocket, and, grasping my sheaf of bank-notes, moved to the\ntable in an adjoining salon where a second game of roulette was in\nprogress. The crowd followed me in a body, and cleared a place for me\nat the table; after which, I proceeded to stake as before--that is to\nsay, at random and without calculating. What saved me from ruin I do\nnot know.\n\nOf course there were times when fragmentary reckonings DID come\nflashing into my brain. For instance, there were times when I attached\nmyself for a while to certain figures and coups--though always leaving\nthem, again before long, without knowing what I was doing.\n\nIn fact, I cannot have been in possession of all my faculties, for I\ncan remember the croupiers correcting my play more than once, owing to\nmy having made mistakes of the gravest order. My brows were damp with\nsweat, and my hands were shaking. Also, Poles came around me to proffer\ntheir services, but I heeded none of them. Nor did my luck fail me now.\nSuddenly, there arose around me a loud din of talking and laughter.\n\"Bravo, bravo!\" was the general shout, and some people even clapped\ntheir hands. I had raked in thirty thousand florins, and again the bank\nhad had to close for the night!\n\n\"Go away now, go away now,\" a voice whispered to me on my right. The\nperson who had spoken to me was a certain Jew of Frankfurt--a man who\nhad been standing beside me the whole while, and occasionally helping\nme in my play.\n\n\"Yes, for God's sake go,\" whispered a second voice in my left ear.\nGlancing around, I perceived that the second voice had come from a\nmodestly, plainly dressed lady of rather less than thirty--a woman\nwhose face, though pale and sickly-looking, bore also very evident\ntraces of former beauty. At the moment, I was stuffing the crumpled\nbank-notes into my pockets and collecting all the gold that was left on\nthe table. Seizing up my last note for five hundred gulden, I contrived\nto insinuate it, unperceived, into the hand of the pale lady. An\noverpowering impulse had made me do so, and I remember how her thin\nlittle fingers pressed mine in token of her lively gratitude. The whole\naffair was the work of a moment.\n\nThen, collecting my belongings, I crossed to where trente et quarante\nwas being played--a game which could boast of a more aristocratic\npublic, and was played with cards instead of with a wheel. At this\ndiversion the bank made itself responsible for a hundred thousand\nthalers as the limit, but the highest stake allowable was, as in\nroulette, four thousand florins. Although I knew nothing of the\ngame--and I scarcely knew the stakes, except those on black and red--I\njoined the ring of players, while the rest of the crowd massed itself\naround me. At this distance of time I cannot remember whether I ever\ngave a thought to Polina; I seemed only to be conscious of a vague\npleasure in seizing and raking in the bank-notes which kept massing\nthemselves in a pile before me.\n\nBut, as ever, fortune seemed to be at my back. As though of set\npurpose, there came to my aid a circumstance which not infrequently\nrepeats itself in gaming. The circumstance is that not infrequently\nluck attaches itself to, say, the red, and does not leave it for a\nspace of say, ten, or even fifteen, rounds in succession. Three days\nago I had heard that, during the previous week there had been a run of\ntwenty-two coups on the red--an occurrence never before known at\nroulette--so that men spoke of it with astonishment. Naturally enough,\nmany deserted the red after a dozen rounds, and practically no one\ncould now be found to stake upon it. Yet upon the black also--the\nantithesis of the red--no experienced gambler would stake anything, for\nthe reason that every practised player knows the meaning of \"capricious\nfortune.\" That is to say, after the sixteenth (or so) success of the\nred, one would think that the seventeenth coup would inevitably fall\nupon the black; wherefore, novices would be apt to back the latter in\nthe seventeenth round, and even to double or treble their stakes upon\nit--only, in the end, to lose.\n\nYet some whim or other led me, on remarking that the red had come up\nconsecutively for seven times, to attach myself to that colour.\nProbably this was mostly due to self-conceit, for I wanted to astonish\nthe bystanders with the riskiness of my play. Also, I remember\nthat--oh, strange sensation!--I suddenly, and without any challenge\nfrom my own presumption, became obsessed with a DESIRE to take risks.\nIf the spirit has passed through a great many sensations, possibly it\ncan no longer be sated with them, but grows more excited, and demands\nmore sensations, and stronger and stronger ones, until at length it\nfalls exhausted. Certainly, if the rules of the game had permitted even\nof my staking fifty thousand florins at a time, I should have staked\nthem. All of a sudden I heard exclamations arising that the whole thing\nwas a marvel, since the red was turning up for the fourteenth time!\n\n\"Monsieur a gagne cent mille florins,\" a voice exclaimed beside me.\n\nI awoke to my senses. What? I had won a hundred thousand florins? If\nso, what more did I need to win? I grasped the banknotes, stuffed them\ninto my pockets, raked in the gold without counting it, and started to\nleave the Casino. As I passed through the salons people smiled to see\nmy bulging pockets and unsteady gait, for the weight which I was\ncarrying must have amounted to half a pood! Several hands I saw\nstretched out in my direction, and as I passed I filled them with all\nthe money that I could grasp in my own. At length two Jews stopped me\nnear the exit.\n\n\"You are a bold young fellow,\" one said, \"but mind you depart early\ntomorrow--as early as you can--for if you do not you will lose\neverything that you have won.\"\n\nBut I did not heed them. The Avenue was so dark that it was barely\npossible to distinguish one's hand before one's face, while the\ndistance to the hotel was half a verst or so; but I feared neither\npickpockets nor highwaymen. Indeed, never since my boyhood have I done\nthat. Also, I cannot remember what I thought about on the way. I only\nfelt a sort of fearful pleasure--the pleasure of success, of conquest,\nof power (how can I best express it?). Likewise, before me there\nflitted the image of Polina; and I kept remembering, and reminding\nmyself, that it was to HER I was going, that it was in HER presence I\nshould soon be standing, that it was SHE to whom I should soon be able\nto relate and show everything. Scarcely once did I recall what she had\nlately said to me, or the reason why I had left her, or all those\nvaried sensations which I had been experiencing a bare hour and a half\nago. No, those sensations seemed to be things of the past, to be things\nwhich had righted themselves and grown old, to be things concerning\nwhich we needed to trouble ourselves no longer, since, for us, life was\nabout to begin anew. Yet I had just reached the end of the Avenue when\nthere DID come upon me a fear of being robbed or murdered. With each\nstep the fear increased until, in my terror, I almost started to run.\nSuddenly, as I issued from the Avenue, there burst upon me the lights\nof the hotel, sparkling with a myriad lamps! Yes, thanks be to God, I\nhad reached home!\n\nRunning up to my room, I flung open the door of it.  Polina was still\non the sofa, with a lighted candle in front of her, and her hands\nclasped. As I entered she stared at me in astonishment (for, at the\nmoment, I must have presented a strange spectacle). All I did, however,\nwas to halt before her, and fling upon the table my burden of wealth.\n\n\n\nXV\n\nI remember, too, how, without moving from her place, or changing her\nattitude, she gazed into my face.\n\n\"I have won two hundred thousand francs!\" cried I as I pulled out my\nlast sheaf of bank-notes. The pile of paper currency occupied the whole\ntable. I could not withdraw my eyes from it. Consequently, for a moment\nor two Polina escaped my mind. Then I set myself to arrange the pile in\norder, and to sort the notes, and to mass the gold in a separate heap.\nThat done, I left everything where it lay, and proceeded to pace the\nroom with rapid strides as I lost myself in thought. Then I darted to\nthe table once more, and began to recount the money; until all of a\nsudden, as though I had remembered something, I rushed to the door, and\nclosed and double-locked it. Finally I came to a meditative halt before\nmy little trunk.\n\n\"Shall I put the money there until tomorrow?\" I asked, turning sharply\nround to Polina as the recollection of her returned to me.\n\nShe was still in her old place--still making not a sound. Yet her eyes\nhad followed every one of my movements. Somehow in her face there was a\nstrange expression--an expression which I did not like. I think that I\nshall not be wrong if I say that it indicated sheer hatred.\n\nImpulsively I approached her.\n\n\"Polina,\" I said, \"here are twenty-five thousand florins--fifty\nthousand francs, or more. Take them, and tomorrow throw them in De\nGriers' face.\"\n\nShe returned no answer.\n\n\"Or, if you should prefer,\" I continued, \"let me take them to him\nmyself tomorrow--yes, early tomorrow morning. Shall I?\"\n\nThen all at once she burst out laughing, and laughed for a long while.\nWith astonishment and a feeling of offence I gazed at her. Her laughter\nwas too like the derisive merriment which she had so often indulged in\nof late--merriment which had broken forth always at the time of my most\npassionate explanations. At length she ceased, and frowned at me from\nunder her eyebrows.\n\n\"I am NOT going to take your money,\" she said contemptuously.\n\n\"Why not?\" I cried. \"Why not, Polina?\"\n\n\"Because I am not in the habit of receiving money for nothing.\"\n\n\"But I am offering it to you as a FRIEND in the same way I would offer\nyou my very life.\"\n\nUpon this she threw me a long, questioning glance, as though she were\nseeking to probe me to the depths.\n\n\"You are giving too much for me,\" she remarked with a smile. \"The\nbeloved of De Griers is not worth fifty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Oh Polina, how can you speak so?\" I exclaimed reproachfully. \"Am I De\nGriers?\"\n\n\"You?\" she cried with her eyes suddenly flashing. \"Why, I HATE you!\nYes, yes, I HATE you! I love you no more than I do De Griers.\"\n\nThen she buried her face in her hands, and relapsed into hysterics. I\ndarted to her side. Somehow I had an intuition of something having\nhappened to her which had nothing to do with myself. She was like a\nperson temporarily insane.\n\n\"Buy me, would you, would you? Would you buy me for fifty thousand\nfrancs as De Griers did?\" she gasped between her convulsive sobs.\n\nI clasped her in my arms, kissed her hands and feet, and fell upon my\nknees before her.\n\nPresently the hysterical fit passed away, and, laying her hands upon my\nshoulders, she gazed for a while into my face, as though trying to read\nit--something I said to her, but it was clear that she did not hear it.\nHer face looked so dark and despondent that I began to fear for her\nreason. At length she drew me towards herself--a trustful smile playing\nover her features; and then, as suddenly, she pushed me away again as\nshe eyed me dimly.\n\nFinally she threw herself upon me in an embrace.\n\n\"You love me?\" she said. \"DO you?--you who were willing even to quarrel\nwith the Baron at my bidding?\"\n\nThen she laughed--laughed as though something dear, but laughable, had\nrecurred to her memory. Yes, she laughed and wept at the same time.\nWhat was I to do? I was like a man in a fever. I remember that she\nbegan to say something to me--though WHAT I do not know, since she\nspoke with a feverish lisp, as though she were trying to tell me\nsomething very quickly. At intervals, too, she would break off into the\nsmile which I was beginning to dread. \"No, no!\" she kept repeating.\n\"YOU are my dear one; YOU are the man I trust.\" Again she laid her\nhands upon my shoulders, and again she gazed at me as she reiterated:\n\"You love me, you love me? Will you ALWAYS love me?\" I could not take\nmy eyes off her. Never before had I seen her in this mood of humility\nand affection. True, the mood was the outcome of hysteria; but--! All\nof a sudden she noticed my ardent gaze, and smiled slightly. The next\nmoment, for no apparent reason, she began to talk of Astley.\n\nShe continued talking and talking about him, but I could not make out\nall she said--more particularly when she was endeavouring to tell me of\nsomething or other which had happened recently. On the whole, she\nappeared to be laughing at Astley, for she kept repeating that he was\nwaiting for her, and did I know whether, even at that moment, he was\nnot standing beneath the window? \"Yes, yes, he is there,\" she said.\n\"Open the window, and see if he is not.\" She pushed me in that\ndirection; yet, no sooner did I make a movement to obey her behest than\nshe burst into laughter, and I remained beside her, and she embraced me.\n\n\"Shall we go away tomorrow?\" presently she asked, as though some\ndisturbing thought had recurred to her recollection. \"How would it be\nif we were to try and overtake Grandmamma? I think we should do so at\nBerlin. And what think you she would have to say to us when we caught\nher up, and her eyes first lit upon us? What, too, about Mr. Astley? HE\nwould not leap from the Shlangenberg for my sake! No! Of that I am very\nsure!\"--and she laughed. \"Do you know where he is going next year? He\nsays he intends to go to the North Pole for scientific investigations,\nand has invited me to go with him! Ha, ha, ha! He also says that we\nRussians know nothing, can do nothing, without European help. But he is\na good fellow all the same. For instance, he does not blame the General\nin the matter, but declares that Mlle. Blanche--that love--But no; I do\nnot know, I do not know.\" She stopped suddenly, as though she had said\nher say, and was feeling bewildered. \"What poor creatures these people\nare. How sorry I am for them, and for Grandmamma! But when are you\ngoing to kill De Griers? Surely you do not intend actually to murder\nhim? You fool! Do you suppose that I should ALLOW you to fight De\nGriers? Nor shall you kill the Baron.\" Here she burst out laughing.\n\"How absurd you looked when you were talking to the Burmergelms! I was\nwatching you all the time--watching you from where I was sitting. And\nhow unwilling you were to go when I sent you! Oh, how I laughed and\nlaughed!\"\n\nThen she kissed and embraced me again; again she pressed her face to\nmine with tender passion. Yet I neither saw nor heard her, for my head\nwas in a whirl....\n\nIt must have been about seven o'clock in the morning when I awoke.\nDaylight had come, and Polina was sitting by my side--a strange\nexpression on her face, as though she had seen a vision and was unable\nto collect her thoughts. She too had just awoken, and was now staring\nat the money on the table. My head ached; it felt heavy. I attempted to\ntake Polina's hand, but she pushed me from her, and leapt from the\nsofa. The dawn was full of mist, for rain had fallen, yet she moved to\nthe window, opened it, and, leaning her elbows upon the window-sill,\nthrust out her head and shoulders to take the air. In this position did\nshe remain for several minutes, without ever looking round at me, or\nlistening to what I was saying. Into my head there came the uneasy\nthought: What is to happen now? How is it all to end? Suddenly Polina\nrose from the window, approached the table, and, looking at me with an\nexpression of infinite aversion, said with lips which quivered with\nanger:\n\n\"Well? Are you going to hand me over my fifty thousand francs?\"\n\n\"Polina, you say that AGAIN, AGAIN?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"You have changed your mind, then? Ha, ha, ha! You are sorry you ever\npromised them?\"\n\nOn the table where, the previous night, I had counted the money there\nstill was lying the packet of twenty five thousand florins. I handed it\nto her.\n\n\"The francs are mine, then, are they? They are mine?\" she inquired\nviciously as she balanced the money in her hands.\n\n\"Yes; they have ALWAYS been yours,\" I said.\n\n\"Then TAKE your fifty thousand francs!\" and she hurled them full in my\nface. The packet burst as she did so, and the floor became strewed with\nbank-notes. The instant that the deed was done she rushed from the room.\n\nAt that moment she cannot have been in her right mind; yet, what was\nthe cause of her temporary aberration I cannot say. For a month past\nshe had been unwell. Yet what had brought about this PRESENT condition\nof mind, above all things, this outburst? Had it come of wounded pride?\nHad it come of despair over her decision to come to me? Had it come of\nthe fact that, presuming too much on my good fortune, I had seemed to\nbe intending to desert her (even as De Griers had done) when once I had\ngiven her the fifty thousand francs? But, on my honour, I had never\ncherished any such intention. What was at fault, I think, was her own\npride, which kept urging her not to trust me, but, rather, to insult\nme--even though she had not realised the fact. In her eyes I\ncorresponded to De Griers, and therefore had been condemned for a fault\nnot wholly my own. Her mood of late had been a sort of delirium, a sort\nof light-headedness--that I knew full well; yet, never had I\nsufficiently taken it into consideration. Perhaps she would not pardon\nme now? Ah, but this was THE PRESENT. What about the future? Her\ndelirium and sickness were not likely to make her forget what she had\ndone in bringing me De Griers' letter. No, she must have known what she\nwas doing when she brought it.\n\nSomehow I contrived to stuff the pile of notes and gold under the bed,\nto cover them over, and then to leave the room some ten minutes after\nPolina. I felt sure that she had returned to her own room; wherefore, I\nintended quietly to follow her, and to ask the nursemaid aid who opened\nthe door how her mistress was. Judge, therefore, of my surprise when,\nmeeting the domestic on the stairs, she informed me that Polina had not\nyet returned, and that she (the domestic) was at that moment on her way\nto my room in quest of her!\n\n\"Mlle. left me but ten minutes ago,\" I said. \"What can have become of\nher?\" The nursemaid looked at me reproachfully.\n\nAlready sundry rumours were flying about the hotel. Both in the office\nof the commissionaire and in that of the landlord it was whispered\nthat, at seven o'clock that morning, the Fraulein had left the hotel,\nand set off, despite the rain, in the direction of the Hotel\nd'Angleterre. From words and hints let fall I could see that the fact\nof Polina having spent the night in my room was now public property.\nAlso, sundry rumours were circulating concerning the General's family\naffairs. It was known that last night he had gone out of his mind, and\nparaded the hotel in tears; also, that the old lady who had arrived was\nhis mother, and that she had come from Russia on purpose to forbid her\nson's marriage with Mlle. de Cominges, as well as to cut him out of her\nwill if he should disobey her; also that, because he had disobeyed her,\nshe had squandered all her money at roulette, in order to have nothing\nmore to leave to him. \"Oh, these Russians!\" exclaimed the landlord,\nwith an angry toss of the head, while the bystanders laughed and the\nclerk betook himself to his accounts. Also, every one had learnt about\nmy winnings; Karl, the corridor lacquey, was the first to congratulate\nme. But with these folk I had nothing to do. My business was to set off\nat full speed to the Hotel d'Angleterre.\n\nAs yet it was early for Mr. Astley to receive visitors; but, as soon as\nhe learnt that it was I who had arrived, he came out into the corridor\nto meet me, and stood looking at me in silence with his steel-grey eyes\nas he waited to hear what I had to say. I inquired after Polina.\n\n\"She is ill,\" he replied, still looking at me with his direct,\nunwavering glance.\n\n\"And she is in your rooms.\"\n\n\"Yes, she is in my rooms.\"\n\n\"Then you are minded to keep her there?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am minded to keep her there.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Astley, that will raise a scandal. It ought not to be\nallowed. Besides, she is very ill. Perhaps you had not remarked that?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have. It was I who told you about it. Had she not been ill, she\nwould not have gone and spent the night with you.\"\n\n\"Then you know all about it?\"\n\n\"Yes; for last night she was to have accompanied me to the house of a\nrelative of mine. Unfortunately, being ill, she made a mistake, and\nwent to your rooms instead.\"\n\n\"Indeed? Then I wish you joy, Mr. Astley. Apropos, you have reminded me\nof something. Were you beneath my window last night? Every moment Mlle.\nPolina kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there;\nafter which she always smiled.\"\n\n\"Indeed? No, I was not there; but I was waiting in the corridor, and\nwalking about the hotel.\"\n\n\"She ought to see a doctor, you know, Mr. Astley.\"\n\n\"Yes, she ought. I have sent for one, and, if she dies, I shall hold\nyou responsible.\"\n\nThis surprised me.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" I replied, \"but what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Never mind. Tell me if it is true that, last night, you won two\nhundred thousand thalers?\"\n\n\"No; I won a hundred thousand florins.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! Then I suppose you will be off to Paris this morning?\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because all Russians who have grown rich go to Paris,\" explained\nAstley, as though he had read the fact in a book.\n\n\"But what could I do in Paris in summer time?--I LOVE her, Mr. Astley!\nSurely you know that?\"\n\n\"Indeed? I am sure that you do NOT. Moreover, if you were to stay here,\nyou would lose everything that you possess, and have nothing left with\nwhich to pay your expenses in Paris. Well, good-bye now. I feel sure\nthat today will see you gone from here.\"\n\n\"Good-bye. But I am NOT going to Paris. Likewise--pardon me--what is to\nbecome of this family? I mean that the affair of the General and Mlle.\nPolina will soon be all over the town.\"\n\n\"I daresay; yet, I hardly suppose that that will break the General's\nheart. Moreover, Mlle. Polina has a perfect right to live where she\nchooses. In short, we may say that, as a family, this family has ceased\nto exist.\"\n\nI departed, and found myself smiling at the Englishman's strange\nassurance that I should soon be leaving for Paris. \"I suppose he means\nto shoot me in a duel, should Polina die. Yes, that is what he intends\nto do.\"  Now, although I was honestly sorry for Polina, it is a fact\nthat, from the moment when, the previous night, I had approached the\ngaming-table, and begun to rake in the packets of bank-notes, my love\nfor her had entered upon a new plane. Yes, I can say that now;\nalthough, at the time, I was barely conscious of it. Was I, then, at\nheart a gambler? Did I, after all, love Polina not so very much? No,\nno! As God is my witness, I loved her! Even when I was returning home\nfrom Mr. Astley's my suffering was genuine, and my self-reproach\nsincere. But presently I was to go through an exceedingly strange and\nugly experience.\n\nI was proceeding to the General's rooms when I heard a door near me\nopen, and a voice call me by name. It was Mlle.'s mother, the Widow de\nCominges who was inviting me, in her daughter's name, to enter.\n\nI did so; whereupon, I heard a laugh and a little cry proceed from the\nbedroom (the pair occupied a suite of two apartments), where Mlle.\nBlanche was just arising.\n\n\"Ah, c'est lui! Viens, donc, bete! Is it true that you have won a\nmountain of gold and silver? J'aimerais mieux l'or.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied with a smile.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"A hundred thousand florins.\"\n\n\"Bibi, comme tu es bete! Come in here, for I can't hear you where you\nare now. Nous ferons bombance, n'est-ce pas?\"\n\nEntering her room, I found her lolling under a pink satin coverlet, and\nrevealing a pair of swarthy, wonderfully healthy shoulders--shoulders\nsuch as one sees in dreams--shoulders covered over with a white cambric\nnightgown which, trimmed with lace, stood out, in striking relief,\nagainst the darkness of her skin.\n\n\"Mon fils, as-tu du coeur?\" she cried when she saw me, and then\ngiggled. Her laugh had always been a very cheerful one, and at times it\neven sounded sincere.\n\n\"Tout autre--\" I began, paraphrasing Corneille.\n\n\"See here,\" she prattled on. \"Please search for my stockings, and help\nme to dress. Aussi, si tu n'es pas trop bete je te prends a Paris. I am\njust off, let me tell you.\"\n\n\"This moment?\"\n\n\"In half an hour.\"\n\nTrue enough, everything stood ready-packed--trunks, portmanteaux, and\nall. Coffee had long been served.\n\n\"Eh bien, tu verras Paris. Dis donc, qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un\n'utchitel'? Tu etais bien bete quand tu etais 'utchitel.' Where are my\nstockings? Please help me to dress.\"\n\nAnd she lifted up a really ravishing foot--small, swarthy, and not\nmisshapen like the majority of feet which look dainty only in bottines.\nI laughed, and started to draw on to the foot a silk stocking, while\nMlle. Blanche sat on the edge of the bed and chattered.\n\n\"Eh bien, que feras-tu si je te prends avec moi? First of all I must\nhave fifty thousand francs, and you shall give them to me at Frankfurt.\nThen we will go on to Paris, where we will live together, et je te\nferai voir des etoiles en plein jour. Yes, you shall see such women as\nyour eyes have never lit upon.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment. If I were to give you those fifty thousand francs, what\nshould I have left for myself?\"\n\n\"Another hundred thousand francs, please to remember. Besides, I could\nlive with you in your rooms for a month, or even for two; or even for\nlonger. But it would not take us more than two months to get through\nfifty thousand francs; for, look you, je suis bonne enfante, et tu\nverras des etoiles, you may be sure.\"\n\n\"What? You mean to say that we should spend the whole in two months?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Does that surprise you very much? Ah, vil esclave! Why, one\nmonth of that life would be better than all your previous existence.\nOne month--et apres, le deluge! Mais tu ne peux comprendre. Va! Away,\naway! You are not worth it.--Ah, que fais-tu?\"\n\nFor, while drawing on the other stocking, I had felt constrained to\nkiss her. Immediately she shrunk back, kicked me in the face with her\ntoes, and turned me neck and prop out of the room.\n\n\"Eh bien, mon 'utchitel',\" she called after me, \"je t'attends, si tu\nveux. I start in a quarter of an hour's time.\"\n\nI returned to my own room with my head in a whirl. It was not my fault\nthat Polina had thrown a packet in my face, and preferred Mr. Astley to\nmyself. A few bank-notes were still fluttering about the floor, and I\npicked them up. At that moment the door opened, and the landlord\nappeared--a person who, until now, had never bestowed upon me so much\nas a glance. He had come to know if I would prefer to move to a lower\nfloor--to a suite which had just been tenanted by Count V.\n\nFor a moment I reflected.\n\n\"No!\" I shouted. \"My account, please, for in ten minutes I shall be\ngone.\"\n\n\"To Paris, to Paris!\" I added to myself. \"Every man of birth must make\nher acquaintance.\"\n\nWithin a quarter of an hour all three of us were seated in a family\ncompartment--Mlle. Blanche, the Widow de Cominges, and myself. Mlle.\nkept laughing hysterically as she looked at me, and Madame re-echoed\nher; but I did not feel so cheerful. My life had broken in two, and\nyesterday had infected me with a habit of staking my all upon a card.\nAlthough it might be that I had failed to win my stake, that I had lost\nmy senses, that I desired nothing better, I felt that the scene was to\nbe changed only FOR A TIME. \"Within a month from now,\" I kept thinking\nto myself, \"I shall be back again in Roulettenberg; and THEN I mean to\nhave it out with you, Mr. Astley!\" Yes, as now I look back at things, I\nremember that I felt greatly depressed, despite the absurd gigglings of\nthe egregious Blanche.\n\n\"What is the matter with you? How dull you are!\" she cried at length as\nshe interrupted her laughter to take me seriously to task.\n\n\"Come, come! We are going to spend your two hundred thousand francs for\nyou, et tu seras heureux comme un petit roi. I myself will tie your tie\nfor you, and introduce you to Hortense. And when we have spent your\nmoney you shall return here, and break the bank again. What did those\ntwo Jews tell you?--that the thing most needed is daring, and that you\npossess it? Consequently, this is not the first time that you will be\nhurrying to Paris with money in your pocket. Quant ... moi, je veux\ncinquante mille francs de rente, et alors.\"\n\n\"But what about the General?\" I interrupted.\n\n\"The General? You know well enough that at about this hour every day he\ngoes to buy me a bouquet. On this occasion, I took care to tell him\nthat he must hunt for the choicest of flowers; and when he returns\nhome, the poor fellow will find the bird flown. Possibly he may take\nwing in pursuit--ha, ha, ha! And if so, I shall not be sorry, for he\ncould be useful to me in Paris, and Mr. Astley will pay his debts here.\"\n\nIn this manner did I depart for the Gay City.\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nOf Paris what am I to say? The whole proceeding was a delirium, a\nmadness. I spent a little over three weeks there, and, during that\ntime, saw my hundred thousand francs come to an end. I speak only of\nthe ONE hundred thousand francs, for the other hundred thousand I gave\nto Mlle. Blanche in pure cash. That is to say, I handed her fifty\nthousand francs at Frankfurt, and, three days later (in Paris),\nadvanced her another fifty thousand on note of hand. Nevertheless, a\nweek had not elapsed ere she came to me for more money. \"Et les cent\nmille francs qui nous restent,\" she added, \"tu les mangeras avec moi,\nmon utchitel.\" Yes, she always called me her \"utchitel.\" A person more\neconomical, grasping, and mean than Mlle. Blanche one could not\nimagine. But this was only as regards HER OWN money. MY hundred\nthousand francs (as she explained to me later) she needed to set up her\nestablishment in Paris, \"so that once and for all I may be on a decent\nfooting, and proof against any stones which may be thrown at me--at all\nevents for a long time to come.\" Nevertheless, I saw nothing of those\nhundred thousand francs, for my own purse (which she inspected daily)\nnever managed to amass in it more than a hundred francs at a time; and,\ngenerally the sum did not reach even that figure.\n\n\"What do you want with money?\" she would say to me with air of absolute\nsimplicity; and I never disputed the point. Nevertheless, though she\nfitted out her flat very badly with the money, the fact did not prevent\nher from saying when, later, she was showing me over the rooms of her\nnew abode:  \"See what care and taste can do with the most wretched of\nmeans!\" However, her \"wretchedness\" had cost fifty thousand francs,\nwhile with the remaining fifty thousand she purchased a carriage and\nhorses.\n\nAlso, we gave a couple of balls--evening parties attended by Hortense\nand Lisette and Cleopatre, who were women remarkable both for the\nnumber of their liaisons and (though only in some cases) for their good\nlooks. At these reunions I had to play the part of host--to meet and\nentertain fat mercantile parvenus who were impossible by reason of\ntheir rudeness and braggadocio, colonels of various kinds, hungry\nauthors, and journalistic hacks--all of whom disported themselves in\nfashionable tailcoats and pale yellow gloves, and displayed such an\naggregate of conceit and gasconade as would be unthinkable even in St.\nPetersburg--which is saying a great deal! They used to try to make fun\nof me, but I would console myself by drinking champagne and then\nlolling in a retiring-room. Nevertheless, I found it deadly work.\n\"C'est un utchitel,\" Blanche would say of me, \"qui a gagne deux cent\nmille francs, and but for me, would have had not a notion how to spend\nthem. Presently he will have to return to his tutoring. Does any one\nknow of a vacant post? You know, one must do something for him.\"\n\nI had the more frequent recourse to champagne in that I constantly felt\ndepressed and bored, owing to the fact that I was living in the most\nbourgeois commercial milieu imaginable--a milieu wherein every sou was\ncounted and grudged. Indeed, two weeks had not elapsed before I\nperceived that Blanche had no real affection for me, even though she\ndressed me in elegant clothes, and herself tied my tie each day. In\nshort, she utterly despised me. But that caused me no concern. Blase\nand inert, I spent my evenings generally at the Chateau des Fleurs,\nwhere I would get fuddled and then dance the cancan (which, in that\nestablishment, was a very indecent performance) with eclat. At length,\nthe time came when Blanche had drained my purse dry. She had conceived\nan idea that, during the term of our residence together, it would be\nwell if I were always to walk behind her with a paper and pencil, in\norder to jot down exactly what she spent, what she had saved, what she\nwas paying out, and what she was laying by. Well, of course I could not\nfail to be aware that this would entail a battle over every ten francs;\nso, although for every possible objection that I might make she had\nprepared a suitable answer, she soon saw that I made no objections, and\ntherefore, had to start disputes herself. That is to say, she would\nburst out into tirades which were met only with silence as I lolled on\na sofa and stared fixedly at the ceiling. This greatly surprised her.\nAt first she imagined that it was due merely to the fact that I was a\nfool, \"un utchitel\"; wherefore she would break off her harangue in the\nbelief that, being too stupid to understand, I was a hopeless case.\nThen she would leave the room, but return ten minutes later to resume\nthe contest. This continued throughout her squandering of my money--a\nsquandering altogether out of proportion to our means. An example is\nthe way in which she changed her first pair of horses for a pair which\ncost sixteen thousand francs.\n\n\"Bibi,\" she said on the latter occasion as she approached me, \"surely\nyou are not angry?\"\n\n\"No-o-o: I am merely tired,\" was my reply as I pushed her from me. This\nseemed to her so curious that straightway she seated herself by my side.\n\n\"You see,\" she went on, \"I decided to spend so much upon these horses\nonly because I can easily sell them again. They would go at any time\nfor TWENTY thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. They are splendid horses, and you have got a splendid\nturn-out. I am quite content. Let me hear no more of the matter.\"\n\n\"Then you are not angry?\"\n\n\"No. Why should I be? You are wise to provide yourself with what you\nneed, for it will all come in handy in the future. Yes, I quite see the\nnecessity of your establishing yourself on a good basis, for without it\nyou will never earn your million. My hundred thousand francs I look\nupon merely as a beginning--as a mere drop in the bucket.\"\n\nBlanche, who had by no means expected such declarations from me, but,\nrather, an uproar and protests, was rather taken aback.\n\n\"Well, well, what a man you are!\" she exclaimed. \"Mais tu as l'esprit\npour comprendre. Sais-tu, mon garcon, although you are a tutor, you\nought to have been born a prince. Are you not sorry that your money\nshould be going so quickly?\"\n\n\"No. The quicker it goes the better.\"\n\n\"Mais--sais-tu-mais dis donc, are you really rich? Mais sais-tu, you\nhave too much contempt for money. Qu'est-ce que tu feras apres, dis\ndonc?\"\n\n\"Apres I shall go to Homburg, and win another hundred thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Oui, oui, c'est ca, c'est magnifique! Ah, I know you will win them,\nand bring them to me when you have done so. Dis donc--you will end by\nmaking me love you. Since you are what you are, I mean to love you all\nthe time, and never to be unfaithful to you. You see, I have not loved\nyou before parce que je croyais que tu n'es qu'un utchitel (quelque\nchose comme un lacquais, n'est-ce pas?) Yet all the time I have been\ntrue to you, parce que je suis bonne fille.\"\n\n\"You lie!\" I interrupted. \"Did I not see you, the other day, with\nAlbert--with that black-jowled officer?\"\n\n\"Oh, oh! Mais tu es--\"\n\n\"Yes, you are lying right enough. But what makes you suppose that I\nshould be angry? Rubbish! Il faut que jeunesse se passe. Even if that\nofficer were here now, I should refrain from putting him out of the\nroom if I thought you really cared for him. Only, mind you, do not give\nhim any of my money. You hear?\"\n\n\"You say, do you, that you would not be angry? Mais tu es un vrai\nphilosophe, sais-tu? Oui, un vrai philosophe! Eh bien, je t'aimerai, je\nt'aimerai. Tu verras-tu seras content.\"\n\nTrue enough, from that time onward she seemed to attach herself only to\nme, and in this manner we spent our last ten days together. The\npromised \"etoiles\" I did not see, but in other respects she, to a\ncertain extent, kept her word. Moreover, she introduced me to Hortense,\nwho was a remarkable woman in her way, and known among us as Therese\nPhilosophe.\n\nBut I need not enlarge further, for to do so would require a story to\nitself, and entail a colouring which I am loth to impart to the present\nnarrative. The point is that with all my faculties I desired the\nepisode to come to an end as speedily as possible. Unfortunately, our\nhundred thousand francs lasted us, as I have said, for very nearly a\nmonth--which greatly surprised me. At all events, Blanche bought\nherself articles to the tune of eighty thousand francs, and the rest\nsufficed just to meet our expenses of living. Towards the close of the\naffair, Blanche grew almost frank with me (at least, she scarcely lied\nto me at all)--declaring, amongst other things, that none of the debts\nwhich she had been obliged to incur were going to fall upon my head. \"I\nhave purposely refrained from making you responsible for my bills or\nborrowings,\" she said, \"for the reason that I am sorry for you. Any\nother woman in my place would have done so, and have let you go to\nprison. See, then, how much I love you, and how good-hearted I am!\nThink, too, what this accursed marriage with the General is going to\ncost me!\"\n\nTrue enough, the marriage took place. It did so at the close of our\nmonth together, and I am bound to suppose that it was upon the ceremony\nthat the last remnants of my money were spent. With it the\nepisode--that is to say, my sojourn with the Frenchwoman--came to an\nend, and I formally retired from the scene.\n\nIt happened thus: A week after we had taken up our abode in Paris there\narrived thither the General. He came straight to see us, and\nthenceforward lived with us practically as our guest, though he had a\nflat of his own as well. Blanche met him with merry badinage and\nlaughter, and even threw her arms around him. In fact, she managed it\nso that he had to follow everywhere in her train--whether when\npromenading on the Boulevards, or when driving, or when going to the\ntheatre, or when paying calls; and this use which she made of him quite\nsatisfied the General. Still of imposing appearance and presence, as\nwell as of fair height, he had a dyed moustache and whiskers (he had\nformerly been in the cuirassiers), and a handsome, though a somewhat\nwrinkled, face. Also, his manners were excellent, and he could carry a\nfrockcoat well--the more so since, in Paris, he took to wearing his\norders. To promenade the Boulevards with such a man was not only a\nthing possible, but also, so to speak, a thing advisable, and with this\nprogramme the good but foolish General had not a fault to find. The\ntruth is that he had never counted upon this programme when he came to\nParis to seek us out. On that occasion he had made his appearance\nnearly shaking with terror, for he had supposed that Blanche would at\nonce raise an outcry, and have him put from the door; wherefore, he was\nthe more enraptured at the turn that things had taken, and spent the\nmonth in a state of senseless ecstasy. Already I had learnt that, after\nour unexpected departure from Roulettenberg, he had had a sort of a\nfit--that he had fallen into a swoon, and spent a week in a species of\ngarrulous delirium. Doctors had been summoned to him, but he had broken\naway from them, and suddenly taken a train to Paris. Of course\nBlanche's reception of him had acted as the best of all possible cures,\nbut for long enough he carried the marks of his affliction, despite his\npresent condition of rapture and delight. To think clearly, or even to\nengage in any serious conversation, had now become impossible for him;\nhe could only ejaculate after each word \"Hm!\" and then nod his head in\nconfirmation. Sometimes, also, he would laugh, but only in a nervous,\nhysterical sort of a fashion; while at other times he would sit for\nhours looking as black as night, with his heavy eyebrows knitted. Of\nmuch that went on he remained wholly oblivious, for he grew extremely\nabsent-minded, and took to talking to himself. Only Blanche could awake\nhim to any semblance of life. His fits of depression and moodiness in\ncorners always meant either that he had not seen her for some while, or\nthat she had gone out without taking him with her, or that she had\nomitted to caress him before departing. When in this condition, he\nwould refuse to say what he wanted--nor had he the least idea that he\nwas thus sulking and moping. Next, after remaining in this condition\nfor an hour or two (this I remarked on two occasions when Blanche had\ngone out for the day--probably to see Albert), he would begin to look\nabout him, and to grow uneasy, and to hurry about with an air as though\nhe had suddenly remembered something, and must try and find it; after\nwhich, not perceiving the object of his search, nor succeeding in\nrecalling what that object had been, he would as suddenly relapse into\noblivion, and continue so until the reappearance of Blanche--merry,\nwanton, half-dressed, and laughing her strident laugh as she approached\nto pet him, and even to kiss him (though the latter reward he seldom\nreceived). Once, he was so overjoyed at her doing so that he burst into\ntears. Even I myself was surprised.\n\nFrom the first moment of his arrival in Paris, Blanche set herself to\nplead with me on his behalf; and at such times she even rose to heights\nof eloquence--saying that it was for ME she had abandoned him, though\nshe had almost become his betrothed and promised to become so; that it\nwas for HER sake he had deserted his family; that, having been in his\nservice, I ought to remember the fact, and to feel ashamed. To all this\nI would say nothing, however much she chattered on; until at length I\nwould burst out laughing, and the incident would come to an end (at\nfirst, as I have said, she had thought me a fool, but since she had\ncome to deem me a man of sense and sensibility). In short, I had the\nhappiness of calling her better nature into play; for though, at first,\nI had not deemed her so, she was, in reality, a kind-hearted woman\nafter her own fashion. \"You are good and clever,\" she said to me\ntowards the finish, \"and my one regret is that you are also so\nwrong-headed. You will NEVER be a rich man!\"\n\n\"Un vrai Russe--un Kalmuk\" she usually called me.\n\nSeveral times she sent me to give the General an airing in the streets,\neven as she might have done with a lacquey and her spaniel; but, I\npreferred to take him to the theatre, to the Bal Mabille, and to\nrestaurants. For this purpose she usually allowed me some money, though\nthe General had a little of his own, and enjoyed taking out his purse\nbefore strangers. Once I had to use actual force to prevent him from\nbuying a phaeton at a price of seven hundred francs, after a vehicle\nhad caught his fancy in the Palais Royal as seeming to be a desirable\npresent for Blanche. What could SHE have done with a\nseven-hundred-franc phaeton?--and the General possessed in the world\nbut a thousand francs! The origin even of those francs I could never\ndetermine, but imagined them to have emanated from Mr. Astley--the more\nso since the latter had paid the family's hotel bill. As for what view\nthe General took of myself, I think that he never divined the footing\non which I stood with Blanche. True, he had heard, in a dim sort of\nway, that I had won a good deal of money; but more probably he supposed\nme to be acting as secretary--or even as a kind of servant--to his\ninamorata. At all events, he continued to address me, in his old\nhaughty style, as my superior. At times he even took it upon himself to\nscold me. One morning in particular, he started to sneer at me over our\nmatutinal coffee. Though not a man prone to take offence, he suddenly,\nand for some reason of which to this day I am ignorant, fell out with\nme. Of course even he himself did not know the reason. To put things\nshortly, he began a speech which had neither beginning nor ending, and\ncried out, a batons rompus, that I was a boy whom he would soon put to\nrights--and so forth, and so forth. Yet no one could understand what he\nwas saying, and at length Blanche exploded in a burst of laughter.\nFinally something appeased him, and he was taken out for his walk. More\nthan once, however, I noticed that his depression was growing upon him;\nthat he seemed to be feeling the want of somebody or something; that,\ndespite Blanche's presence, he was missing some person in particular.\nTwice, on these occasions, did he plunge into a conversation with me,\nthough he could not make himself intelligible, and only went on\nrambling about the service, his late wife, his home, and his property.\nEvery now and then, also, some particular word would please him;\nwhereupon he would repeat it a hundred times in the day--even though\nthe word happened to express neither his thoughts nor his feelings.\nAgain, I would try to get him to talk about his children, but always he\ncut me short in his old snappish way, and passed to another subject.\n\"Yes, yes--my children,\" was all that I could extract from him. \"Yes,\nyou are right in what you have said about them.\" Only once did he\ndisclose his real feelings. That was when we were taking him to the\ntheatre, and suddenly he exclaimed: \"My unfortunate children! Yes, sir,\nthey are unfortunate children.\" Once, too, when I chanced to mention\nPolina, he grew quite bitter against her. \"She is an ungrateful woman!\"\nhe exclaimed. \"She is a bad and ungrateful woman! She has broken up a\nfamily. If there were laws here, I would have her impaled. Yes, I\nwould.\" As for De Griers, the General would not have his name\nmentioned. \"He has ruined me,\" he would say. \"He has robbed me, and cut\nmy throat. For two years he was a perfect nightmare to me. For months\nat a time he never left me in my dreams. Do not speak of him again.\"\n\nIt was now clear to me that Blanche and he were on the point of coming\nto terms; yet, true to my usual custom, I said nothing. At length,\nBlanche took the initiative in explaining matters. She did so a week\nbefore we parted.\n\n\"Il a du chance,\" she prattled, \"for the Grandmother is now REALLY ill,\nand therefore, bound to die. Mr. Astley has just sent a telegram to say\nso, and you will agree with me that the General is likely to be her\nheir. Even if he should not be so, he will not come amiss, since, in\nthe first place, he has his pension, and, in the second place, he will\nbe content to live in a back room; whereas I shall be Madame General,\nand get into a good circle of society\" (she was always thinking of\nthis) \"and become a Russian chatelaine. Yes, I shall have a mansion of\nmy own, and peasants, and a million of money at my back.\"\n\n\"But, suppose he should prove jealous? He might demand all sorts of\nthings, you know. Do you follow me?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no! How ridiculous that would be of him! Besides, I have\ntaken measures to prevent it. You need not be alarmed. That is to say,\nI have induced him to sign notes of hand in Albert's name.\nConsequently, at any time I could get him punished. Isn't he\nridiculous?\"\n\n\"Very well, then. Marry him.\"\n\nAnd, in truth, she did so--though the marriage was a family one only,\nand involved no pomp or ceremony. In fact, she invited to the nuptials\nnone but Albert and a few other friends. Hortense, Cleopatre, and the\nrest she kept firmly at a distance. As for the bridegroom, he took a\ngreat interest in his new position. Blanche herself tied his tie, and\nBlanche herself pomaded him--with the result that, in his frockcoat and\nwhite waistcoat, he looked quite comme il faut.\n\n\"Il est, pourtant, TRES comme il faut,\" Blanche remarked when she\nissued from his room, as though the idea that he was \"TRES comme il\nfaut\" had impressed even her. For myself, I had so little knowledge of\nthe minor details of the affair, and took part in it so much as a\nsupine spectator, that I have forgotten most of what passed on this\noccasion. I only remember that Blanche and the Widow figured at it, not\nas \"de Cominges,\" but as \"du Placet.\" Why they had hitherto been \"de\nCominges\" I do not know--I only know that this entirely satisfied the\nGeneral, that he liked the name \"du Placet\" even better than he had\nliked the name \"de Cominges.\" On the morning of the wedding, he paced\nthe salon in his gala attire and kept repeating to himself with an air\nof great gravity and importance: \"Mlle. Blanche du Placet! Mlle.\nBlanche du Placet, du Placet!\" He beamed with satisfaction as he did\nso. Both in the church and at the wedding breakfast he remained not\nonly pleased and contented, but even proud. She too underwent a change,\nfor now she assumed an air of added dignity.\n\n\"I must behave altogether differently,\" she confided to me with a\nserious air. \"Yet, mark you, there is a tiresome circumstance of which\nI had never before thought--which is, how best to pronounce my new\nfamily name. Zagorianski, Zagozianski, Madame la Generale de Sago,\nMadame la Generale de Fourteen Consonants--oh these infernal Russian\nnames! The LAST of them would be the best to use, don't you think?\"\n\nAt length the time had come for us to part, and Blanche, the egregious\nBlanche, shed real tears as she took her leave of me. \"Tu etais bon\nenfant\" she said with a sob. \"Je te croyais bete et tu en avais l'air,\nbut it suited you.\" Then, having given me a final handshake, she\nexclaimed, \"Attends!\"; whereafter, running into her boudoir, she\nbrought me thence two thousand-franc notes. I could scarcely believe my\neyes! \"They may come in handy for you,\" she explained, \"for, though you\nare a very learned tutor, you are a very stupid man. More than two\nthousand francs, however, I am not going to give you, for the reason\nthat, if I did so, you would gamble them all away. Now good-bye. Nous\nserons toujours bons amis, and if you win again, do not fail to come to\nme, et tu seras heureux.\"\n\nI myself had still five hundred francs left, as well as a watch worth a\nthousand francs, a few diamond studs, and so on. Consequently, I could\nsubsist for quite a length of time without particularly bestirring\nmyself. Purposely I have taken up my abode where I am now partly to\npull myself together, and partly to wait for Mr. Astley, who, I have\nlearnt, will soon be here for a day or so on business. Yes, I know\nthat, and then--and then I shall go to Homburg. But to Roulettenberg I\nshall not go until next year, for they say it is bad to try one's luck\ntwice in succession at a table. Moreover, Homburg is where the best\nplay is carried on.\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nIt is a year and eight months since I last looked at these notes of\nmine. I do so now only because, being overwhelmed with depression, I\nwish to distract my mind by reading them through at random. I left them\noff at the point where I was just going to Homburg. My God, with what a\nlight heart (comparatively speaking) did I write the concluding\nlines!--though it may be not so much with a light heart, as with a\nmeasure of self-confidence and unquenchable hope. At that time had I\nany doubts of myself? Yet behold me now. Scarcely a year and a half\nhave passed, yet I am in a worse position than the meanest beggar. But\nwhat is a beggar? A fig for beggary! I have ruined myself--that is all.\nNor is there anything with which I can compare myself; there is no\nmoral which it would be of any use for you to read to me. At the\npresent moment nothing could well be more incongruous than a moral. Oh,\nyou self-satisfied persons who, in your unctuous pride, are forever\nready to mouth your maxims--if only you knew how fully I myself\ncomprehend the sordidness of my present state, you would not trouble to\nwag your tongues at me! What could you say to me that I do not already\nknow? Well, wherein lies my difficulty? It lies in the fact that by a\nsingle turn of a roulette wheel everything for me, has become changed.\nYet, had things befallen otherwise, these moralists would have been\namong the first (yes, I feel persuaded of it) to approach me with\nfriendly jests and congratulations. Yes, they would never have turned\nfrom me as they are doing now! A fig for all of them! What am I? I am\nzero--nothing. What shall I be tomorrow? I may be risen from the dead,\nand have begun life anew. For still, I may discover the man in myself,\nif only my manhood has not become utterly shattered.\n\nI went, I say, to Homburg, but afterwards went also to Roulettenberg,\nas well as to Spa and Baden; in which latter place, for a time, I acted\nas valet to a certain rascal of a Privy Councillor, by name Heintze,\nwho until lately was also my master here. Yes, for five months I lived\nmy life with lacqueys! That was just after I had come out of\nRoulettenberg prison, where I had lain for a small debt which I owed.\nOut of that prison I was bailed by--by whom? By Mr. Astley? By Polina?\nI do not know. At all events, the debt was paid to the tune of two\nhundred thalers, and I sallied forth a free man. But what was I to do\nwith myself? In my dilemma I had recourse to this Heintze, who was a\nyoung scapegrace, and the sort of man who could speak and write three\nlanguages. At first I acted as his secretary, at a salary of thirty\ngulden a month, but afterwards I became his lacquey, for the reason\nthat he could not afford to keep a secretary--only an unpaid servant. I\nhad nothing else to turn to, so I remained with him, and allowed myself\nto become his flunkey. But by stinting myself in meat and drink I\nsaved, during my five months of service, some seventy gulden; and one\nevening, when we were at Baden, I told him that I wished to resign my\npost, and then hastened to betake myself to roulette.\n\nOh, how my heart beat as I did so! No, it was not the money that I\nvalued--what I wanted was to make all this mob of Heintzes, hotel\nproprietors, and fine ladies of Baden talk about me, recount my story,\nwonder at me, extol my doings, and worship my winnings. True, these\nwere childish fancies and aspirations, but who knows but that I might\nmeet Polina, and be able to tell her everything, and see her look of\nsurprise at the fact that I had overcome so many adverse strokes of\nfortune. No, I had no desire for money for its own sake, for I was\nperfectly well aware that I should only squander it upon some new\nBlanche, and spend another three weeks in Paris after buying a pair of\nhorses which had cost sixteen thousand francs. No, I never believed\nmyself to be a hoarder; in fact, I knew only too well that I was a\nspendthrift. And already, with a sort of fear, a sort of sinking in my\nheart, I could hear the cries of the croupiers--\"Trente et un, rouge,\nimpair et passe,\" \"Quarte, noir, pair et manque.\"  How greedily I gazed\nupon the gaming-table, with its scattered louis d'or, ten-gulden\npieces, and thalers; upon the streams of gold as they issued from the\ncroupier's hands, and piled themselves up into heaps of gold\nscintillating as fire; upon the ell--long rolls of silver lying around\nthe croupier. Even at a distance of two rooms I could hear the chink of\nthat money--so much so that I nearly fell into convulsions.\n\nAh, the evening when I took those seventy gulden to the gaming table\nwas a memorable one for me. I began by staking ten gulden upon passe.\nFor passe I had always had a sort of predilection, yet I lost my stake\nupon it. This left me with sixty gulden in silver. After a moment's\nthought I selected zero--beginning by staking five gulden at a time.\nTwice I lost, but the third round suddenly brought up the desired coup.\nI could almost have died with joy as I received my one hundred and\nseventy-five gulden. Indeed, I have been less pleased when, in former\ntimes, I have won a hundred thousand gulden. Losing no time, I staked\nanother hundred gulden upon the red, and won; two hundred upon the red,\nand won; four hundred upon the black, and won; eight hundred upon\nmanque, and won. Thus, with the addition of the remainder of my\noriginal capital, I found myself possessed, within five minutes, of\nseventeen hundred gulden.  Ah, at such moments one forgets both oneself\nand one's former failures! This I had gained by risking my very life. I\nhad dared so to risk, and behold, again I was a member of mankind!\n\nI went and hired a room, I shut myself up in it, and sat counting my\nmoney until three o'clock in the morning. To think that when I awoke on\nthe morrow, I was no lacquey! I decided to leave at once for Homburg.\nThere I should neither have to serve as a footman nor to lie in prison.\nHalf an hour before starting, I went and ventured a couple of\nstakes--no more; with the result that, in all, I lost fifteen hundred\nflorins. Nevertheless, I proceeded to Homburg, and have now been there\nfor a month.\n\nOf course, I am living in constant trepidation, playing for the\nsmallest of stakes, and always looking out for something--calculating,\nstanding whole days by the gaming-tables to watch the play--even seeing\nthat play in my dreams--yet seeming, the while, to be in some way\nstiffening, to be growing caked, as it were, in mire. But I must\nconclude my notes, which I finish under the impression of a recent\nencounter with Mr. Astley. I had not seen him since we parted at\nRoulettenberg, and now we met quite by accident. At the time I was\nwalking in the public gardens, and meditating upon the fact that not\nonly had I still some fifty gulden in my possession, but also I had\nfully paid up my hotel bill three days ago. Consequently, I was in a\nposition to try my luck again at roulette; and if I won anything I\nshould be able to continue my play, whereas, if I lost what I now\npossessed, I should once more have to accept a lacquey's place,\nprovided that, in the alternative, I failed to discover a Russian\nfamily which stood in need of a tutor. Plunged in these reflections, I\nstarted on my daily walk through the Park and forest towards a\nneighbouring principality. Sometimes, on such occasions, I spent four\nhours on the way, and would return to Homburg tired and hungry; but, on\nthis particular occasion, I had scarcely left the gardens for the Park\nwhen I caught sight of Astley seated on a bench. As soon as he\nperceived me, he called me by name, and I went and sat down beside him;\nbut, on noticing that he seemed a little stiff in his manner, I\nhastened to moderate the expression of joy which the sight of him had\ncalled forth.\n\n\"YOU here?\" he said. \"Well, I had an idea that I should meet you. Do\nnot trouble to tell me anything, for I know all--yes, all. In fact,\nyour whole life during the past twenty months lies within my knowledge.\"\n\n\"How closely you watch the doings of your old friends!\" I replied.\n\"That does you infinite credit. But stop a moment. You have reminded me\nof something. Was it you who bailed me out of Roulettenberg prison when\nI was lying there for a debt of two hundred gulden? SOMEONE did so.\"\n\n\"Oh dear no!--though I knew all the time that you were lying there.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you could tell me who DID bail me out?\"\n\n\"No; I am afraid I could not.\"\n\n\"What a strange thing! For I know no Russians at all here, so it cannot\nhave been a Russian who befriended me. In Russia we Orthodox folk DO go\nbail for one another, but in this case I thought it must have been done\nby some English stranger who was not conversant with the ways of the\ncountry.\"\n\nMr. Astley seemed to listen to me with a sort of surprise. Evidently he\nhad expected to see me looking more crushed and broken than I was.\n\n\"Well,\" he said--not very pleasantly, \"I am none the less glad to find\nthat you retain your old independence of spirit, as well as your\nbuoyancy.\"\n\n\"Which means that you are vexed at not having found me more abased and\nhumiliated than I am?\" I retorted with a smile.\n\nAstley was not quick to understand this, but presently did so and\nlaughed.\n\n\"Your remarks please me as they always did,\" he continued. \"In those\nwords I see the clever, triumphant, and, above all things, cynical\nfriend of former days. Only Russians have the faculty of combining\nwithin themselves so many opposite qualities. Yes, most men love to see\ntheir best friend in abasement; for generally it is on such abasement\nthat friendship is founded. All thinking persons know that ancient\ntruth. Yet, on the present occasion, I assure you, I am sincerely glad\nto see that you are NOT cast down. Tell me, are you never going to give\nup gambling?\"\n\n\"Damn the gambling! Yes, I should certainly have given it up, were it\nnot that--\"\n\n\"That you are losing? I thought so. You need not tell me any more. I\nknow how things stand, for you have said that last in despair, and\ntherefore, truthfully. Have you no other employment than gambling?\"\n\n\"No; none whatever.\"\n\nAstley gave me a searching glance. At that time it was ages since I had\nlast looked at a paper or turned the pages of a book.\n\n\"You are growing blase,\" he said. \"You have not only renounced life,\nwith its interests and social ties, but the duties of a citizen and a\nman; you have not only renounced the friends whom I know you to have\nhad, and every aim in life but that of winning money; but you have also\nrenounced your memory. Though I can remember you in the strong, ardent\nperiod of your life, I feel persuaded that you have now forgotten every\nbetter feeling of that period--that your present dreams and aspirations\nof subsistence do not rise above pair, impair rouge, noir, the twelve\nmiddle numbers, and so forth.\"\n\n\"Enough, Mr. Astley!\" I cried with some irritation--almost in anger.\n\"Kindly do not recall to me any more recollections, for I can remember\nthings for myself. Only for a time have I put them out of my head. Only\nuntil I shall have rehabilitated myself, am I keeping my memory dulled.\nWhen that hour shall come, you will see me arise from the dead.\"\n\n\"Then you will have to be here another ten years,\" he replied. \"Should\nI then be alive, I will remind you--here, on this very bench--of what I\nhave just said. In fact, I will bet you a wager that I shall do so.\"\n\n\"Say no more,\" I interrupted impatiently. \"And to show you that I have\nnot wholly forgotten the past, may I enquire where Mlle. Polina is? If\nit was not you who bailed me out of prison, it must have been she. Yet\nnever have I heard a word concerning her.\"\n\n\"No, I do not think it was she. At the present moment she is in\nSwitzerland, and you will do me a favour by ceasing to ask me these\nquestions about her.\" Astley said this with a firm, and even an angry,\nair.\n\n\"Which means that she has dealt you a serious wound?\" I burst out with\nan involuntary sneer.\n\n\"Mlle. Polina,\" he continued, \"Is the best of all possible living\nbeings; but, I repeat, that I shall thank you to cease questioning me\nabout her. You never really knew her, and her name on your lips is an\noffence to my moral feeling.\"\n\n\"Indeed? On what subject, then, have I a better right to speak to you\nthan on this? With it are bound up all your recollections and mine.\nHowever, do not be alarmed: I have no wish to probe too far into your\nprivate, your secret affairs. My interest in Mlle. Polina does not\nextend beyond her outward circumstances and surroundings. About them\nyou could tell me in two words.\"\n\n\"Well, on condition that the matter shall end there, I will tell you\nthat for a long time Mlle. Polina was ill, and still is so. My mother\nand sister entertained her for a while at their home in the north of\nEngland, and thereafter Mlle. Polina's grandmother (you remember the\nmad old woman?) died, and left Mlle. Polina a personal legacy of seven\nthousand pounds sterling. That was about six months ago, and now Mlle.\nis travelling with my sister's family--my sister having since married.\nMlle.'s little brother and sister also benefited by the Grandmother's\nwill, and are now being educated in London. As for the General, he died\nin Paris last month, of a stroke. Mlle. Blanche did well by him, for\nshe succeeded in having transferred to herself all that he received\nfrom the Grandmother. That, I think, concludes all that I have to tell.\"\n\n\"And De Griers? Is he too travelling in Switzerland?\"\n\n\"No; nor do I know where he is. Also I warn you once more that you had\nbetter avoid such hints and ignoble suppositions; otherwise you will\nassuredly have to reckon with me.\"\n\n\"What? In spite of our old friendship?\"\n\n\"Yes, in spite of our old friendship.\"\n\n\"Then I beg your pardon a thousand times, Mr. Astley. I meant nothing\noffensive to Mlle. Polina, for I have nothing of which to accuse her.\nMoreover, the question of there being anything between this Frenchman\nand this Russian lady is not one which you and I need discuss, nor even\nattempt to understand.\"\n\n\"If,\" replied Astley, \"you do not care to hear their names coupled\ntogether, may I ask you what you mean by the expressions 'this\nFrenchman,' 'this Russian lady,' and 'there being anything between\nthem'? Why do you call them so particularly a 'Frenchman' and a\n'Russian lady'?\"\n\n\"Ah, I see you are interested, Mr. Astley. But it is a long, long\nstory, and calls for a lengthy preface. At the same time, the question\nis an important one, however ridiculous it may seem at the first\nglance. A Frenchman, Mr. Astley, is merely a fine figure of a man. With\nthis you, as a Britisher, may not agree. With it I also, as a Russian,\nmay not agree--out of envy. Yet possibly our good ladies are of another\nopinion. For instance, one may look upon Racine as a broken-down,\nhobbledehoy, perfumed individual--one may even be unable to read him;\nand I too may think him the same, as well as, in some respects, a\nsubject for ridicule. Yet about him, Mr. Astley, there is a certain\ncharm, and, above all things, he is a great poet--though one might like\nto deny it. Yes, the Frenchman, the Parisian, as a national figure, was\nin process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians\nhad even ceased to be bears. The Revolution bequeathed to the French\nnobility its heritage, and now every whippersnapper of a Parisian may\npossess manners, methods of expression, and even thoughts that are\nabove reproach in form, while all the time he himself may share in that\nform neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul--his manners,\nand the rest, having come to him through inheritance. Yes, taken by\nhimself, the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of\nvillains. Per contra, there is no one in the world more worthy of\nconfidence and respect than this young Russian lady. De Griers might so\nmask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart, for he\nhas an imposing figure, Mr. Astley, and this young lady might easily\ntake that figure for his real self--for the natural form of his heart\nand soul--instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered\nhim. And even though it may offend you, I feel bound to say that the\nmajority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined, whereas we\nRussian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it, and are always\neager to cultivate the same. But to distinguish beauty of soul and\npersonal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom\nthan is possessed by our women, especially by our younger ladies. At\nall events, they need more EXPERIENCE. For instance, this Mlle.\nPolina--pardon me, but the name has passed my lips, and I cannot well\nrecall it--is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you\nto Monsieur de Griers. She may respect you, she may become your friend,\nshe may open out her heart to you; yet over that heart there will be\nreigning that loathsome villain, that mean and petty usurer, De Griers.\nThis will be due to obstinacy and self-love--to the fact that De Griers\nonce appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis, of a\ndisenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her\nfamily and the frivolous old General; and, although these transactions\nof his have since been exposed, you will find that the exposure has\nmade no impression upon her mind. Only give her the De Griers of former\ndays, and she will ask of you no more. The more she may detest the\npresent De Griers, the more will she lament the De Griers of the\npast--even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination.\nYou are a sugar refiner, Mr. Astley, are you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, I belong to the well-known firm of Lovell and Co.\"\n\n\"Then see here. On the one hand, you are a sugar refiner, while, on the\nother hand, you are an Apollo Belvedere. But the two characters do not\nmix with one another. I, again, am not even a sugar refiner; I am a\nmere roulette gambler who has also served as a lacquey. Of this fact\nMlle. Polina is probably well aware, since she appears to have an\nexcellent force of police at her disposal.\"\n\n\"You are saying this because you are feeling bitter,\" said Astley with\ncold indifference. \"Yet there is not the least originality in your\nwords.\"\n\n\"I agree. But therein lies the horror of it all--that, how trepidation,\nplaying ever mean and farcical my accusations may be, they are none the\nless TRUE. But I am only wasting words.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are, for you are only talking nonsense!\" exclaimed my\ncompanion--his voice now trembling and his eyes flashing fire. \"Are you\naware,\" he continued, \"that wretched, ignoble, petty, unfortunate man\nthough you are, it was at HER request I came to Homburg, in order to\nsee you, and to have a long, serious talk with you, and to report to\nher your feelings and thoughts and hopes--yes, and your recollections\nof her, too?\"\n\n\"Indeed? Is that really so?\" I cried--the tears beginning to well from\nmy eyes. Never before had this happened.\n\n\"Yes, poor unfortunate,\" continued Astley. \"She DID love you; and I may\ntell you this now for the reason that now you are utterly lost. Even if\nI were also to tell you that she still loves you, you would none the\nless have to remain where you are. Yes, you have ruined yourself beyond\nredemption. Once upon a time you had a certain amount of talent, and\nyou were of a lively disposition, and your good looks were not to be\ndespised. You might even have been useful to your country, which needs\nmen like you. Yet you remained here, and your life is now over. I am\nnot blaming you for this--in my view all Russians resemble you, or are\ninclined to do so. If it is not roulette, then it is something else.\nThe exceptions are very rare. Nor are you the first to learn what a\ntaskmaster is yours. For roulette is not exclusively a Russian game.\nHitherto, you have honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather\nthan to act as a thief; but what the future may have in store for you I\ntremble to think. Now good-bye. You are in want of money, I suppose?\nThen take these ten louis d'or. More I shall not give you, for you\nwould only gamble it away. Take care of these coins, and farewell. Once\nmore, TAKE CARE of them.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Astley. After all that has been said I--\"\n\n\"TAKE CARE of them!\" repeated my friend. \"I am certain you are still a\ngentleman, and therefore I give you the money as one gentleman may give\nmoney to another. Also, if I could be certain that you would leave both\nHomburg and the gaming-tables, and return to your own country, I would\ngive you a thousand pounds down to start life afresh; but, I give you\nten louis d'or instead of a thousand pounds for the reason that at the\npresent time a thousand pounds and ten louis d'or will be all the same\nto you--you will lose the one as readily as you will the other. Take\nthe money, therefore, and good-bye.\"\n\n\"Yes, I WILL take it if at the same time you will embrace me.\"\n\n\"With pleasure.\"\n\nSo we parted--on terms of sincere affection.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nBut he was wrong. If I was hard and undiscerning as regards Polina and\nDe Griers, HE was hard and undiscerning as regards Russian people\ngenerally. Of myself I say nothing. Yet--yet words are only words. I\nneed to ACT. Above all things I need to think of Switzerland. Tomorrow,\ntomorrow--Ah, but if only I could set things right tomorrow, and be\nborn again, and rise again from the dead! But no--I cannot. Yet I must\nshow her what I can do. Even if she should do no more than learn that I\ncan still play the man, it would be worth it. Today it is too late, but\nTOMORROW...\n\nYet I have a presentiment that things can never be otherwise. I have\ngot fifteen louis d'or in my possession, although I began with fifteen\ngulden. If I were to play carefully at the start--But no, no! Surely I\nam not such a fool as that? Yet WHY should I not rise from the dead? I\nshould require at first but to go cautiously and patiently and the rest\nwould follow. I should require but to put a check upon my nature for\none hour, and my fortunes would be changed entirely. Yes, my nature is\nmy weak point. I have only to remember what happened to me some months\nago at Roulettenberg, before my final ruin. What a notable instance\nthat was of my capacity for resolution! On the occasion in question I\nhad lost everything--everything; yet, just as I was leaving the Casino,\nI heard another gulden give a rattle in my pocket! \"Perhaps I shall\nneed it for a meal,\" I thought to myself; but a hundred paces further\non, I changed my mind, and returned. That gulden I staked upon\nmanque--and there is something in the feeling that, though one is\nalone, and in a foreign land, and far from one's own home and friends,\nand ignorant of whence one's next meal is to come, one is nevertheless\nstaking one's very last coin! Well, I won the stake, and in twenty\nminutes had left the Casino with a hundred and seventy gulden in my\npocket! That is a fact, and it shows what a last remaining gulden can\ndo.... But what if my heart had failed me, or I had shrunk from\nmaking up my mind? ...\n\nNo: tomorrow all shall be ended!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Gambler, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GAMBLER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2197.txt or 2197.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/1\/9\/2197\/\n\nProduced by Martin Adamson.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1455,"split":"test"}
