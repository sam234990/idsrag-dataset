{"ori_id":"e6b90ac408f85b70d4da2ec35b695d5d0f70196f","title":"Box and Cox","context":"Box and Cox\n Mrs Bouncer, a London lodging-house keeper, is letting an apartment to a double tenantry \u2013 to Box, a printer on a daily newspaper, and to Cox, a journeyman hatter, the former occupying the room during the day, the latter during the night. They invariably meet on the stairs of the lodging-house when one comes in from work as the other is going out, but neither has any idea that Mrs Bouncer is letting his room to the other. Cox, suspicious that Mrs Bouncer has been using his flat during the day, complains to her that his coal keeps disappearing and there is \"a steady increase of evaporation among my candles, wood, sugar and lucifer matches.\" He also complains that his room is continually full of tobacco smoke. Mrs Bouncer gives various excuses \u2013 among others, that Box, who, she says, occupies the attic, is a persistent smoker, and that his smoke must come down the chimney. Cox departs for his work at the hat shop, and on the stairs passes Box who is returning from the night shift at the newspaper.\nBox has brought home with him a rasher of bacon, which he at once prepares to cook. He lights the fire, is indignant that his matches have been used and his candles burnt low; for, being at home only during the day, he suspects Mrs Bouncer of these depredations. Leaving his bacon to cook, he retires to bed for a short nap. Cox then returns, having been given the day off by his employer. He has bought a mutton chop and, going to cook it on the gridiron, finds the fire already lit and the rasher of bacon on the gridiron. He removes it, puts his chop in its stead, and hurries into an adjoining room for a plate. The slamming of the door awakens Box, who, recollecting his bacon, leaps from the bed, and finds the chop where he had left the rasher. He angrily seizes the chop, flings it from the window, and leaves the room to fetch a plate. Cox re-enters, and, in lieu of his chop, discovers the rasher, which follows the chop out of the window. Box and Cox meet, each imagining the other to be an intruder, each pulling from his pocket the last week's receipt for rent, and each clamouring loudly for redress from the landlady. Mrs Bouncer is forced to explain the mystery, and she throws herself on the kindness of Box and Cox by promising either of them a handsome second floor back room, which she hurries off to prepare.\nFrustrated, Box asks, \"Hark ye, sir \u2013 can you fight?\" Cox answers, \"No, sir.\" Box: \"No? Then come on!\" Agreeing, however, that they have no quarrel with each other, and that the whole mess is Mrs Bouncer's fault, Box and Cox converse civilly. It emerges that Cox is about to be married to a widow, Penelope Anne Wiggins, a prosperous proprietress of bathing machines at Margate and Ramsgate. Box is astonished, as he too had once been engaged to Mrs Wiggins, but, he reveals, he had struck on an ingenious plan to escape her clutches: he had pretended to commit suicide by drowning. Cox is equally reluctant to marry her. The two argue about which of them is obliged to do so, and eventually they call for pistols. When Mrs Bouncer goes to bring them, Cox cries, \"Stop! You don't mean to say ... that you keep loaded fire-arms in the house?\" \"Oh, no\", says Mrs Bouncer, \"they're not loaded\". Cox: \"Then produce the murderous weapons instantly!\" Meanwhile, the two agree to cast dice; the loser must marry Penelope Anne. Both have loaded dice, and at each successive throw they continue to throw sixes. The dice are then changed for shillings. At every toss each man's coin lands on heads, as both contestants are using double-headed coins.\nThe impasse is broken when a letter arrives from Margate stating that Penelope Anne has drowned in a boating accident, and has left her property to her intended husband. Box and Cox now argue their claims to the bathing machines, but finally they agree to split the fortune. Now a second letter arrives, which states that Penelope Anne is quite safe and is on the road to London to claim her lover. Escape is now hopeless, and Box and Cox are in despair. A vehicle arrives, a knock resounds at the door, and Box and Cox place their backs to the door. Penelope Anne goes away again, leaving another letter revealing that she has decided to marry Mr Knox, an admirer nearer her own age. Box and Cox are delighted, and their happiness is completed by the realisation that they are brothers, who have been long separated (Box: \"Have you such a thing as a strawberry mark on your left arm?\" Cox: \"No!\" Box: \"Then it is he!\"). They reject the second-floor back room and determine to reside permanently in the same room, and under the tenancy of the same landlady.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Box and Cox, by John Maddison Morton\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

COX, dressed, with the exception of his coat, is\nlooking at himself in a small looking-glass, which is in his hand._\n\nCOX. I've half a mind to register an oath that I'll never have my hair\ncut again! [_His hair is very short._] I look as if I had just been\ncropped for the militia! And I was particularly emphatic in my\ninstructions to the hair-dresser, only to cut the ends off. He must\nhave thought I meant the other ends! Never mind--I shan't meet anybody\nto care about so early. Eight o'clock, I declare! I haven't a moment\nto lose. Fate has placed me with the most punctual, particular, and\nperemptory of hatters, and I must fulfil my destiny. [_Knock at L.\nD._] Open locks, whoever knocks!\n\n_Enter MRS. BOUNCER, L._\n\nMRS. B. Good-morning, Mr. Cox. I hope you slept comfortably, Mr. Cox?\n\nCOX. I can't say I did, Mrs. B. I should feel obliged to you, if you\ncould accommodate me with a more protuberant bolster, Mrs. B. The one\nI've got now seems to me to have about a handful and a half of\nfeathers at each end, and nothing whatever in the middle.\n\nMRS. B. Anything to accommodate you, Mr. Cox.\n\nCOX. Thank you. Then, perhaps, you'll be good enough to hold this\nglass, while I finish my toilet.\n\nMRS. B. Certainly. [_Holding glass before COX, who ties his cravat._]\nWhy, I do declare, you've had your hair cut.\n\nCOX. Cut? It strikes me I've had it mowed! It's very kind of you to\nmention it, but I'm sufficiently conscious of the absurdity of my\npersonal appearance already. [_Puts on his coat._] Now for my hat.\n[_Puts on his hat, which comes over his eyes._] That's the effect of\nhaving one's hair cut. This hat fitted me quite tight before. Luckily\nI've got two or three more. [_Goes in at L., and returns, with three\nhats of different shapes, and puts them on, one after the other--all\nof which are too big for him._] This is pleasant! Never mind. This one\nappears to me to wabble about rather less than the others--[_Puts on\nhat,_]--and now I'm off! By the bye, Mrs. Bouncer, I wish to call your\nattention to a fact that has been evident to me for some time\npast--and that is, that my coals go remarkably fast--\n\nMRS. B. Lor, Mr. Cox!\n\nCOX. It is not the case only with the coals, Mrs. Bouncer, but I've\nlately observed a gradual and steady increase of evaporation among my\ncandles, wood, sugar, and lucifer matches.\n\nMRS. B. Lor, Mr. Cox! you surely don't suspect me?\n\nCOX. I don't say I do, Mrs. B.; only I wish you distinctly to\nunderstand, that I don't believe it's the cat.\n\nMRS. B. Is there anything else you've got to grumble about, sir?\n\nCOX. Grumble! Mrs. Bouncer, do you possess such a thing as a\ndictionary?\n\nMRS. B. No, sir.\n\nCOX. Then I'll lend you one--and if you turn to the letter G, you'll\nfind \"Grumble, verb neuter--to complain without a cause.\" Now that's\nnot my case, Mrs. B., and now that we are upon the subject, I wish to\nknow how it is that I frequently find my apartment full of smoke?\n\nMRS. B. Why--I suppose the chimney--\n\nCOX. The chimney doesn't smoke tobacco. I'm speaking of tobacco smoke,\nMrs. B. I hope, Mrs. Bouncer, _you're_ not guilty of cheroots or\nCubas?\n\nMRS. B. Not I, indeed, Mr. Cox.\n\nCOX. Nor partial to a pipe?\n\nMRS. B. No, sir.\n\nCOX. Then, how is it that--\n\nMRS. B. Why--I suppose--yes--that must be it--\n\nCOX. At present I am entirely of your opinion--because I haven't the\nmost distant particle of an idea what you mean.\n\nMRS. B. Why the gentleman who has got the attics, is hardly ever\nwithout a pipe in his mouth--and there he sits, with his feet upon the\nmantel-piece--\n\nCOX. The mantel piece! That strikes me as being a considerable\nstretch, either of your imagination, Mrs. B., or the gentleman's legs.\nI presume you mean the fender or the hob.\n\nMRS. B. Sometimes one, sometimes t'other. Well, there he sits for\nhours, and puffs away into the fire-place.\n\nCOX. Ah, then you mean to say that this gentleman's smoke, instead of\nemulating the example of all other sorts of smoke, and going _up_ the\nchimney, thinks proper to affect a singularity by taking the contrary\ndirection?\n\nMRS. B. Why--\n\nCOX. Then, I suppose, the gentleman you are speaking of, is the same\nindividual that I invariably meet coming up stairs when I'm going\ndown, and going down stairs when I'm coming up!\n\nMRS. B. Why--yes--I--\n\nCOX. From the appearance of his outward man, I should unhesitatingly\nset him down as a gentleman connected with the printing interest.\n\nMRS. B. Yes, sir--and a very respectable young gentleman he is.\n\nCOX. Well, good-morning, Mrs. Bouncer!\n\nMRS. B. You'll be back at your usual time, I suppose, sir?\n\nCOX. Yes--nine o'clock. You needn't light my fire in future, Mrs.\nB.--I'll do it myself. Don't forget the bolster! [_Going, stops._] A\nhalfpenny worth of milk, Mrs. Bouncer--and be good enough to let it\nstand--I wish the cream to accumulate.\n\n[_Exit at L. C._\n\nMRS. B. He's gone at last! I declare I was all in a tremble for fear\nMr. Box would come in before Mr. Cox went out. Luckily, they've never\nmet yet--and what's more, they're not very likely to do so; for Mr.\nBox is hard at work at a newspaper office all night, and doesn't come\nhome till the morning, and Mr. Cox is busy making hats all day long,\nand doesn't come home till night; so that I'm getting double rent for\nmy room, and neither of my lodgers are any the wiser for it. It was a\ncapital idea of mine--that it was! But I haven't an instant to lose.\nFirst of all, let me put Mr. Cox's things out of Mr. Box's way. [_She\ntakes the three hats, COX'S dressing gown and slippers, opens door at\nL. and puts them in, then shuts door and locks it._] Now, then, to put\nthe key where Mr. Cox always finds it. [_Puts the key on the ledge of\nthe door, L._] I really must beg Mr. Box not to smoke so much. I was\nso dreadfully puzzled to know what to say when Mr. Cox spoke about it.\nNow, then, to make the bed--and don't let me forget that what's the\nhead of the bed for Mr. Cox, becomes the foot of the bed for Mr.\nBox--people's tastes do differ so. [_Goes behind the curtains of the\nbed, and seems to be making it--then appears with a very thin bolster\nin her hand._] The idea of Mr. Cox presuming to complain of such a\nbolster as this! [_She disappears again, behind curtains._]\n\nBOX. [_Without._] Pooh--pooh! Why don't you keep your own side of the\nstaircase, sir? [_Enters at back, dressed as a Printer. Puts his head\nout at door again, shouting._] It was as much your fault as mine, sir!\nI say, sir--it was as much your fault as mine, sir!\n\nMRS. B. [_Emerging from behind the curtains of bed._] Lor, Mr. Box!\nwhat is the matter?\n\nBOX. Mind your own business, Bouncer!\n\nMRS. B. Dear, dear, Mr. Box! what a temper you are in, to be sure! I\ndeclare you're quite pale in the face!\n\nBOX. What colour would you have a man be, who has been setting up long\nleaders for a daily paper all night?\n\nMRS. B. But, then, you've all the day to yourself.\n\nBOX. [_Looking significantly at MRS. BOUNCER._] So it seems! Far be it\nfrom me, Bouncer, to hurry your movements, but I think it right to\nacquaint you with my immediate intention of divesting myself of my\ngarments, and going to bed.\n\nMRS. B. Oh, Mr. Box!\n\n[_Going._\n\nBOX. Stop! Can you inform me who the individual is that I invariably\nencounter going down stairs when I'm coming up, and coming up stairs\nwhen I'm going down?\n\nMRS. B. [_Confused._] Oh--yes--the gentleman in the attic, sir.\n\nBOX. Oh! There's nothing particularly remarkable about him, except his\nhats. I meet him in all sorts of hats--white hats and black hats--hats\nwith broad brims, and hats with narrow brims--hats with naps, and hats\nwithout naps--in short, I have come to the conclusion, that he must be\nindividually and professionally associated with the hatting interest.\n\nMRS. B. Yes, sir. And, by the bye, Mr. Box, he begged me to request of\nyou, as a particular favor, that you would not smoke quite so much.\n\nBOX. Did he? Then you may tell the gentle hatter, with my compliments,\nthat if he objects to the effluvia of tobacco, he had better\ndomesticate himself in some adjoining parish.\n\nMRS. B. Oh, Mr. Box! You surely wouldn't deprive me of a lodger?\n\n[_Pathetically._\n\nBOX. It would come to precisely the same thing, Bouncer, because if I\ndetect the slightest attempt to put my pipe out, I at once give you\nwarning that I shall give you warning at once.\n\nMRS. B. Well, Mr. Box--do you want anything more of me?\n\nBOX. On the contrary--I've had quite enough of you!\n\nMRS. B. Well, if ever! What next, I wonder?\n\n[_Goes out at L. C., slamming door after her._\n\nBOX. It's quite extraordinary, the trouble I always have to get rid of\nthat venerable female! She knows I'm up all night, and yet she seems\nto set her face against my indulging in a horizontal position by day.\nNow, let me see--shall I take my nap before I swallow my breakfast, or\nshall I take my breakfast before I swallow my nap--I mean, shall I\nswallow my nap before--no--never mind! I've got a rasher of bacon\nsomewhere--[_Feeling in his pockets_]--I've the most distinct and\nvivid recollection of having purchased a rasher of bacon--Oh, here it\nis--[_Produces it, wrapped in paper, and places it on table._]--and a\npenny roll. The next thing is to light the fire. Where are my\nlucifers? [_Looking on mantel-piece R., and taking box, opens it._]\nNow, 'pon my life, this is too bad of Bouncer--this is, by several\ndegrees, too bad! I had a whole box full, three days ago, and now\nthere's only one! I'm perfectly aware that she purloins my coals and\nmy candles, and my sugar--but I did think--oh, yes, I did think that\nmy lucifers would be sacred! [_Takes candlestick off the mantel-piece,\nR., in which there is a very small end of candle--looks at it._] Now I\nshould like to ask any unprejudiced person or persons their opinion\ntouching this candle. In the first place, a candle is an article that\nI don't require, because I'm only at home in the day time--and I\nbought this candle on the first of May--Chimney-sweepers'\nDay--calculating that it would last me three months, and here's one\nweek not half over, and the candle three parts gone! [_Lights the\nfire--then takes down a gridiron, which is hanging over the fireplace,\nR._] Mrs. Bouncer has been using my gridiron! The last article of\nconsumption that I cooked upon it was a pork chop, and now it is\npowerfully impregnated with the odour of red herrings! [_Places\ngridiron on fire, and then, with a fork, lays rasher of bacon on the\ngridiron._] How sleepy I am, to be sure! I'd indulge myself with a\nnap, if there was anybody here to superintend the turning of my bacon.\n[_Yawning again._] Perhaps it will turn itself. I must lie down--so,\nhere goes. [_Lies on the bed, closing the curtains round him--after a\nshort pause--_\n\n_Enter COX, hurriedly, L. C._\n\nCOX. Well, wonders will never cease! Conscious of being eleven minutes\nand a half behind time, I was sneaking into the shop, in a state of\nconsiderable excitement, when my venerable employer, with a smile of\nextreme benevolence on his aged countenance, said to me--\"Cox, I\nshan't want you to-day--you can have a holiday.\"--Thoughts of\n\"Gravesend and back--fare, One Shilling,\" instantly suggested\nthemselves, intermingled with visions of \"Greenwich for Fourpence!\"\nThen came the Twopenny Omnibuses, and the Halfpenny boats--in short,\nI'm quite bewildered! However, I must have my breakfast first--that'll\ngive me time to reflect. I've bought a mutton chop, so I shan't want\nany dinner. [_Puts chop on table._] Good gracious! I've forgot the\nbread. Holloa! what's this? A roll, I declare! Come, that's lucky!\nNow, then, to light the fire. Holloa--[_Seeing the lucifer-box on\ntable,_]--who presumes to touch my box of lucifers? Why, it's empty! I\nleft one in it--I'll take my oath I did. Heydey! why, the fire _is_\nlighted! Where's the gridiron? _On_ the fire, I declare! And what's\nthat on it? Bacon? Bacon it is! Well, now, 'pon my life, there is a\nquiet coolness about Mrs. Bouncer's proceedings that's almost amusing.\nShe takes my last lucifer--my coals, and my gridiron, to cook her\nbreakfast by! No, no--I can't stand this! Come out of that! [_Pokes\nfork into bacon, and puts it on a plate on the table, then places his\nchop on the gridiron, which he puts on the fire._] Now, then, for my\nbreakfast things. [_Taking key, hung up, L., opens door L. and goes\nout, slamming the door after him, with a loud noise._\n\nBOX. [_Suddenly showing his head from behind the curtains._] Come in!\nif it's you, Mrs. Bouncer--you needn't be afraid. I wonder how long\nI've been asleep? [_Suddenly recollecting._] Goodness gracious--my\nbacon! [_Leaps off bed, and runs to the fireplace._] Holloa! what's\nthis? A chop! Whose chop? Mrs. Bouncer's, I'll be bound.--She thought\nto cook her breakfast while I was asleep--with _my_ coals, too--and my\ngridiron! Ha, ha! But where's my bacon? [_Seeing it on table._] Here\nit is. Well, 'pon my life, Bouncer's going it! And shall I curb my\nindignation? Shall I falter in my vengeance? No! [_Digs the fork into\nthe chop, opens window, and throws chop out--shuts window again._] So\nmuch for Bouncer's breakfast, and now for my own! [_With the fork he\nputs the bacon on the gridiron again._] I may as well lay my breakfast\nthings.--[_Goes to mantel-piece at R., takes key out of one of the\nornaments, opens door at R. and exit, slamming door after him._\n\nCOX. [_Putting his head in quickly at L._] Come in--come in! [_Opens\ndoor, L. C. Enters with a small tray, on which are tea things, &c.,\nwhich he places on drawers, L. and suddenly recollects._] Oh,\ngoodness! my chop! [_Running to fireplace._] Holloa--what's that? The\nbacon again! Oh, pooh! Zounds--confound it--dash it--damn it--I can't\nstand this! [_Pokes fork into bacon, opens window, and flings it out,\nshuts window again, returns to drawers for tea things, and encounters\nBOX coming from his cupboard with his tea things--they walk down C. of\nstage together._] Who are you, sir?\n\nBOX. If you come to that--who are _you?_\n\nCOX. What do you want here, sir?\n\nBOX. If you come to that--what do _you_ want?\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] It's the printer! [_Puts tea-things on the drawers._\n\nBOX. [_Aside._] It's the hatter! [_Puts tea-things on table._\n\nCOX. Go to your attic, sir--\n\nBOX. _My_ attic, sir? _Your_ attic, sir!\n\nCOX. Printer, I shall do you a frightful injury, if you don't\ninstantly leave my apartment.\n\nBOX. _Your_ apartment? You mean _my_ apartment, you contemptible\nhatter, you!\n\nCOX. _Your_ apartment? Ha! ha!--come, I like that! Look here,\nsir--[_Produces a paper out of his pocket._] Mrs. Bouncer's receipt\nfor the last week's rent, sir--\n\nBOX. [_Produces a paper, and holds it close to COX'S face._] Ditto,\nsir!\n\nCOX. [_Suddenly shouting._] Thieves!\n\nBOX. Murder!\n\nBOTH. Mrs. Bouncer! [_Each runs to door, L. C., calling._\n\n_MRS. BOUNCER runs in at door, L. C._\n\nMRS. B. What is the matter? [_COX and BOX seize MRS. BOUNCER by the\narm, and drag her forward._\n\nBOX. Instantly remove that hatter!\n\nCOX. Immediately turn out that printer!\n\nMRS. B. Well--but, gentlemen--\n\nCOX. Explain!\n\n[_Pulling her round to him._\n\nBOX. Explain! [_Pulling her round to him._] Whose room is this?\n\nCOX. Yes, woman--whose room is this?\n\nBOX. Doesn't it belong to me?\n\nMRS. B. No!\n\nCOX. There! You hear, sir--it belongs to me!\n\nMRS. B. No--it belongs to both of you!\n\n[_Sobbing._\n\nCOX & BOX. Both of us?\n\nMRS. B. Oh, dear gentlemen, don't be angry--but, you see, this\ngentleman--[_Pointing to BOX,_]--only being at home in the daytime,\nand that gentleman--[_Pointing to COX,_]--at night, I thought I might\nventure, until my little back second floor room was ready--\n\nCOX & BOX. [_Eagerly._] When will your little back second floor room\nbe ready?\n\nMRS. B. Why, to-morrow--\n\nCOX. I'll take it!\n\nBOX. So will I!\n\nMRS. B. Excuse me--but if you both take it, you may just as well stop\nwhere you are.\n\nCOX & BOX. True.\n\nCOX. I spoke first, sir--\n\nBOX. With all my heart, sir. The little back second floor room is\nyours, sir--now, go--\n\nCOX. Go? Pooh--pooh!\n\nMRS. B. Now don't quarrel, gentlemen. You see, there used to be a\npartition here--\n\nCOX & BOX. Then put it up!\n\nMRS. B. Nay, I'll see if I can't get the other room ready this very\nday. Now _do_ keep your tempers.\n\n[_Exit, L._\n\nCOX. What a disgusting position!\n\n[_Walking rapidly round stage._\n\nBOX. [_Sitting down on chair, at one side of table, and following\nCOX'S movements._] Will you allow me to observe, if you have not had\nany exercise to-day, you'd better go out and take it.\n\nCOX. I shall not do anything of the sort, sir.\n\n[_Seating himself at the table opposite BOX._\n\nBOX. Very well, sir.\n\nCOX. Very well, sir! However, don't let me prevent _you_ from going\nout.\n\nBOX. Don't flatter yourself, sir. [_COX is about to break a piece of\nthe roll off._] Holloa! that's my roll, sir-- [_Snatches it away--puts\na pipe in his mouth, lights it with a piece of tinder--and puffs smoke\nacross to COX._\n\nCOX. Holloa! What are you about, sir?\n\nBOX. What am I about? I'm about to smoke.\n\nCOX. Wheugh!\n\n[_Goes and opens window at BOX'S back._\n\nBOX. Holloa! [_Turns round._] Put down that window, sir!\n\nCOX. Then put your pipe out, sir!\n\nBOX. There!\n\n[_Puts pipe on table._\n\nCOX. There!\n\n[_Slams down window and re-seats himself._\n\nBOX. I shall retire to my pillow. [_Goes up, takes off his jacket,\nthen goes towards bed, and sits down upon it, L. C._\n\nCOX. [_Jumps up, goes to bed, and sits down on R. of BOX._] I beg your\npardon, sir--I cannot allow any one to rumple my bed. [_Both rising._]\n\nBOX. _Your_ bed? Hark ye, sir--can you fight?\n\nCOX. No, sir.\n\nBOX. No? Then come on--\n\n[_Sparring at COX._\n\nCOX. Sit down, sir--or I'll instantly vociferate \"Police!\"\n\nBOX. [_Seats himself--COX does the same._] I say, sir----\n\nCOX. Well, sir?\n\nBOX. Although we are doomed to occupy the same room for a few hours\nlonger, I don't see any necessity for our cutting each other's\nthroats, sir.\n\nCOX. Not at all. It's an operation that I should decidedly object to.\n\nBOX. And, after all, I've no violent animosity to you, sir.\n\nCOX. Nor have I any rooted antipathy to you, sir.\n\nBOX. Besides, it was all Mrs. Bouncer's fault, sir.\n\nCOX. Entirely, sir. [_Gradually approaching chairs._]\n\nBOX. Very well, sir!\n\nCOX. Very well, sir! [_Pause._]\n\nBOX. Take a bit of roll, sir?\n\nCOX. Thank ye, sir. [_Breaking a bit off. Pause._]\n\nBOX. Do you sing, sir?\n\nCOX. I sometimes join in a chorus.\n\nBOX. Then give us a chorus. [_Pause._] Have you seen the Bosjemans,\nsir?\n\nCOX. No, sir--my wife wouldn't let me.\n\nBOX. Your _wife!_\n\nCOX. That is--my _intended_ wife.\n\nBOX. Well, that's the same thing! I congratulate you! [_Shaking\nhands._]\n\nCOX. [_With a deep sigh._] Thank ye. [_Seeing BOX about to get up._]\nYou needn't disturb yourself, sir. She won't come here.\n\nBOX. Oh! I understand. You've got a snug little establishment of your\nown _here_--on the sly--cunning dog--[_Nudging COX._]\n\nCOX. [_Drawing himself up._] No such thing, sir--I repeat, sir--no\nsuch thing, sir, but my wife--I mean, my _intended_ wife--happens to\nbe the proprietor of a considerable number of bathing-machines----\n\nBOX. [_Suddenly._] Ha! Where? [_Grasping COX'S arm._]\n\nCOX. At a favorite watering-place. How curious you are!\n\nBOX. Not at all. Well?\n\nCOX. Consequently, in the bathing season--which luckily is rather a\nlong one--we see but little of each other; but as that is now over, I\nam daily indulging in the expectation of being blessed with the sight\nof _my_ beloved. [_Very seriously._] Are _you_ married?\n\nBOX. Me? Why--not exactly!\n\nCOX. Ah--a happy bachelor!\n\nBOX. Why--not--precisely!\n\nCOX. Oh! a--widower?\n\nBOX. No--not absolutely!\n\nCOX. You'll excuse me, sir--but at present I don't exactly understand\nhow you can help being one of the three.\n\nBOX. Not help it?\n\nCOX. No, sir--not you, nor any other man alive!\n\nBOX. Ah, that may be--but I'm not alive!\n\nCOX. [_Pushing back his chair._] You'll excuse me, sir--but I don't\nlike joking upon such subjects.\n\nBOX. I'm perfectly serious, sir. I've been defunct for the last three\nyears!\n\nCOX. [_Shouting._] Will you be quiet, sir?\n\nBOX. If you won't believe me, I'll refer you to a very large,\nnumerous, and respectable circle of disconsolate friends.\n\nCOX. My dear sir--my _very_ dear sir--if there does exist any\ningenious contrivance whereby a man on the eve of committing matrimony\ncan leave this world, and yet stop in it, I shouldn't be sorry to know\nit.\n\nBOX. Oh! then I presume I'm not to set you down as being frantically\nattached to your intended?\n\nCOX. Why, not exactly; and yet, at present, I'm only aware of one\nobstacle to my doating upon her, and that is, that I can't abide her!\n\nBOX. Then there's nothing more easy. Do as I did.\n\nCOX. [_Eagerly._] I will! What was it?\n\nBOX. Drown yourself!\n\nCOX. [_Shouting again._] Will you be quiet, sir?\n\nBOX. Listen to me. Three years ago it was my misfortune to captivate\nthe affections of a still blooming, though somewhat middle-aged widow,\nat Ramsgate.\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] Singular enough! Just my case three months ago at\nMargate.\n\nBOX. Well, sir, to escape her importunities, I came to the\ndetermination of enlisting into the Blues, or Life Guards.\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] So did I. How very odd!\n\nBOX. But they wouldn't have me--they actually had the effrontery to\nsay that I was too short--\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] And I wasn't tall enough!\n\nBOX. So I was obliged to content myself with a marching regiment--I\nenlisted!\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] So did I. Singular coincidence!\n\nBOX. I'd no sooner done so, than I was sorry for it.\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] So was I.\n\nBOX. My infatuated widow offered to purchase my discharge, on\ncondition that I'd lead her to the altar.\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] Just my case!\n\nBOX. I hesitated--at last I consented.\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] I consented at once!\n\nBOX. Well, sir--the day fixed for the happy ceremony at length drew\nnear--in fact, too near to be pleasant--so I suddenly discovered that\nI wasn't worthy to possess her, and I told her so--when, instead of\nbeing flattered by the compliment, she flew upon me like a tiger of\nthe female gender--I rejoined--when suddenly something whizzed past\nme, within an inch of my ear, and shivered into a thousand fragments\nagainst the mantel-piece--it was the slop-basin. I retaliated with a\ntea-cup--we parted, and the next morning I was served with a notice of\naction for breach of promise.\n\nCOX. Well, sir?\n\nBOX. Well, sir--ruin stared me in the face--the action proceeded\nagainst me with gigantic strides--I took a desperate resolution--I\nleft my home early one morning, with one suit of clothes on my back,\nand another tied up in a bundle, under my arm--I arrived on the\ncliffs--opened my bundle--deposited the suit of clothes on the very\nverge of the precipice--took one look down into the yawning gulph\nbeneath me, and walked off in the opposite direction.\n\nCOX. Dear me! I think I begin to have some slight perception of your\nmeaning. Ingenious creature! You disappeared--the suit of clothes were\nfound--\n\nBOX. Exactly--and in one of the pockets of the coat, or the waistcoat,\nor the pantaloons--I forget which--there was also found a piece of\npaper, with these affecting farewell words: \"This is thy work, oh,\nPenelope Ann!\"\n\nCOX. Penelope Ann! [_Starts up, takes BOX by the arm, and leads him\nslowly to front of stage._] Penelope Ann?\n\nBOX. Penelope Ann!\n\nCOX. Originally widow of William Wiggins?\n\nBOX. Widow of William Wiggins!\n\nCOX. Proprietor of bathing machines?\n\nBOX. Proprietor of bathing machines!\n\nCOX. At Margate?\n\nBOX. And Ramsgate!\n\nCOX. It must be she! And you, sir--you are Box--the lamented, long\nlost Box!\n\nBOX. I am!\n\nCOX. And I was about to marry the interesting creature you so cruelly\ndeceived.\n\nBOX. Ha! then you are Cox?\n\nCOX. I am!\n\nBOX. I heard of it. I congratulate you--I give you joy! And now, I\nthink I'll go and take a stroll.\n\n[_Going._\n\nCOX. No you don't! [_Stopping him._] I'll not lose sight of you till\nI've restored you to the arms of your intended.\n\nBOX. _My_ intended? You mean _your_ intended.\n\nCOX. No, sir--yours!\n\nBOX. How can she be _my_ intended, now that I'm drowned?\n\nCOX. You're no such thing, sir! and I prefer presenting you to\nPenelope Ann.\n\nBOX. I've no wish to be introduced to your intended.\n\nCOX. _My_ intended? How can that be, sir? You proposed to her first!\n\nBOX. What of that, sir? I came to an untimely end, and you popped the\nquestion afterwards.\n\nCOX. Very well, sir!\n\nBOX. Very well, sir!\n\nCOX. You are much more worthy of her than I am, sir. Permit me, then,\nto follow the generous impulse of my nature--I give her up to you.\n\nBOX. Benevolent being! I wouldn't rob you for the world! [_Going._]\nGood morning, sir!\n\nCOX. [_Seizing him._] Stop!\n\nBOX. Unhand me, hatter! or I shall cast off the lamb and assume the\nlion!\n\nCOX. Pooh!\n\n[_Snapping his fingers close to BOX'S face._\n\nBOX. An insult! to my very face--under my very nose! [_Rubbing it._]\nYou know the consequences, sir--instant satisfaction, sir!\n\nCOX. With all my heart, sir!\n\n[_They go to the fire-place, R., and begin ringing bells violently,\nand pull down bell-pulls._\n\nBOTH. Mrs. Bouncer! Mrs. Bouncer!\n\n_MRS. BOUNCER runs in, L. C._\n\nMRS. B. What is it, gentlemen?\n\nBOX. Pistols for two!\n\nMRS. B. Yes, sir\n\n[_Going._\n\nCOX. Stop! You don't mean to say, thoughtless and imprudent woman,\nthat you keep loaded fire-arms in the house?\n\nMRS. B. Oh no--they're not loaded.\n\nCOX. Then produce the murderous weapons instantly!\n\n[_Exit MRS. BOUNCER, L. C._\n\nBOX. I say, sir!\n\nCOX. Well, sir?\n\nBOX. What's your opinion of duelling, sir?\n\nCOX. I think it's a barbarous practice, sir.\n\nBOX. So do I, sir. To be sure, I don't so much object to it when the\npistols are not loaded.\n\nCOX. No: I dare say that _does_ make some difference.\n\nBOX. And yet, sir--on the other hand--doesn't it strike you as rather\na waste of time, for two people to keep firing pistols at one another,\nwith nothing in 'em?\n\nCOX. No, sir--not more than any other harmless recreation.\n\nBOX. Hark ye! Why do you object to marry Penelope Ann?\n\nCOX. Because, as I've observed already, I can't abide her. You'll be\nvery happy with her.\n\nBOX. Happy! Me! With the consciousness that I have deprived _you_ of\nsuch a treasure? No, no, Cox!\n\nCOX. Don't think of me, Box--I shall be sufficiently rewarded by the\nknowledge of my Box's happiness.\n\nBOX. Don't be absurd, sir!\n\nCOX. Then don't you be ridiculous, sir!\n\nBOX. I won't have her!\n\nCOX. I won't have her!\n\nBOX. I have it! Suppose we draw lots for the lady--eh, Mr. Cox?\n\nCOX. That's fair enough, Mr. Box.\n\nBOX. Or, what say you to dice?\n\nCOX. With all my heart! Dice, by all means--[_Eagerly._]\n\nBOX. [_Aside._] That's lucky! Mrs. Bouncer's nephew left a pair here\nyesterday. He sometimes persuades me to have a throw for a trifle, and\nas he always throws sixes, I suspect they are good ones.\n\n[_Goes to the cupboard at R., and brings out the dice-box._\n\nCOX. [_Aside._] I've no objection at all to dice. I lost one pound,\nseventeen and sixpence, at last Barnet Races, to a very gentlemanly\nlooking man, who had a most peculiar knack of throwing sixes; I\nsuspected they were loaded, so I gave him another half-crown, and he\ngave me the dice.\n\n[_Takes dice out of his pocket--uses lucifer box as substitute for\ndice-box, which is on table._\n\nBOX. Now then, sir!\n\nCOX. I'm ready, sir! [_They seat themselves at opposite sides of the\ntable._] Will you lead off, sir?\n\nBOX. As you please, sir. The lowest throw, of course, wins Penelope\nAnn?\n\nCOX. Of course, sir.\n\nBOX. Very well, sir!\n\nCOX. Very well, sir!\n\nBOX. [_Rattling dice and throwing._] Sixes!\n\nCOX. That's not a bad throw of yours, sir. [_Rattling dice--throws._]\nSixes!\n\nBOX. That's a pretty good one of your's, sir. [_Throws._] Sixes!\n\nCOX. [_Throws._] Sixes!\n\nBOX. Sixes!\n\nCOX. Sixes!\n\nBOX. Sixes!\n\nCOX. Sixes!\n\nBOX. Those are not bad dice of yours, sir.\n\nCOX. Your's seem pretty good ones, sir.\n\nBOX. Suppose we change?\n\nCOX. Very well, sir.\n\n[_They change dice._\n\nBOX. [_Throwing._] Sixes!\n\nCOX. Sixes!\n\nBOX. Sixes!\n\nCOX. Sixes!\n\nBOX. [_Flings down the dice._] Pooh! It's perfectly absurd, your going\non throwing sixes in this sort of way, sir.\n\nCOX. I shall go on till my luck changes, sir!\n\nBOX. Let's try something else. I have it! Suppose we toss for Penelope\nAnn?\n\nCOX. The very thing I was going to propose!\n\n[_They each turn aside and take out a handful of money._\n\nBOX. [_Aside, examining money._] Where's my tossing shilling? Here it\nis!\n\n[_Selecting coin._\n\nCOX. [_Aside, examining money._] Where's my lucky sixpence? I've got\nit!\n\nBOX. Now then, sir,--heads win?\n\nCOX. Or tails lose--whichever you prefer.\n\nBOX. It's the same to me, sir.\n\nCOX. Very well, sir. Heads, I win,--tails, you lose.\n\nBOX. Yes--[_Suddenly_]--no. Heads win, sir.\n\nCOX. Very well--go on!\n\n[_They are standing opposite to each other._\n\nBOX. [_Tossing._] Heads!\n\nCOX. [_Tossing._] Heads!\n\nBOX. [_Tossing._] Heads!\n\nCOX. [_Tossing._] Heads!\n\nBOX. Ain't you rather tired of turning up heads, sir?\n\nCOX. Couldn't you vary the monotony of our proceedings by an\noccasional tail, sir?\n\nBOX. [_Tossing._] Heads!\n\nCOX. [_Tossing._] Heads!\n\nBOX. Heads? Stop, sir! Will you permit me--[_Taking COX'S sixpence._]\nHolloa! your sixpence has got no tail, sir!\n\nCOX. [_Seizing BOX'S shilling._] And your shilling has got two heads,\nsir!\n\nBOX. Cheat!\n\nCOX. Swindler! [_They are about to rush upon each other, then retreat\nto some distance, and commence sparring, and striking fiercely at one\nanother._]\n\n_Enter MRS. BOUNCER, L. H. C._\n\nBOX & COX. Is the little back second floor room ready?\n\nMRS. B. Not quite, gentlemen. I can't find the pistols, but I have\nbrought you a letter--it came by the General Post yesterday. I'm sure\nI don't know how I forgot it, for I put it carefully in my pocket.\n\nCOX. And you've kept it carefully in your pocket ever since?\n\nMRS. B. Yes, sir. I hope you'll forgive me, sir. [_Going._] By the\nbye, I paid twopence for it.\n\nCOX. Did you? Then I _do_ forgive you.\n\n[_Exit MRS. B._\n\n[_Looking at letter._] \"Margate.\" The post-mark decidedly says\n\"Margate.\"\n\nBOX. Oh, doubtless a tender epistle from Penelope Ann.\n\nCOX. Then read it, sir. [_Handing letter to BOX._]\n\nBOX. Me, sir?\n\nCOX. Of course. You don't suppose I'm going to read a letter from your\nintended?\n\nBOX. _My_ intended! Pooh! It's addressed to you--C. O. X.!\n\nCOX. Do you think that's a C.? It looks to me like a B.\n\nBOX. Nonsense! Fracture the seal!\n\nCOX. [_Opens letter--starts._] Goodness gracious!\n\nBOX. [_Snatching letter--starts._] Gracious goodness!\n\nCOX. [_Taking letter again._] \"Margate--May the 4th. Sir,--I hasten to\nconvey to you the intelligence of a melancholy accident, which has\nbereft you of your intended wife.\" He means _your_ intended!\n\nBOX. No, _yours!_ However, it's perfectly immaterial--but she\nunquestionably was yours.\n\nCOX. How can that be? You proposed to her first!\n\nBOX. Yes, but then you--now don't let us begin again--Go on.\n\nCOX. [_Resuming letter._] \"Poor Mrs. Wiggins went out for a short\nexcursion in a sailing boat--a sudden and violent squall soon after\ntook place, which, it is supposed, upset her, as she was found, two\ndays afterwards, keel upwards.\"\n\nBOX. Poor woman!\n\nCOX. The boat, sir! [_Reading._] \"As her man of business, I\nimmediately proceeded to examine her papers, amongst which I soon\ndiscovered her will; the following extract from which will, I have no\ndoubt, be satisfactory to you. 'I hereby bequeath my entire property\nto my intended husband.'\" Excellent, but unhappy creature!\n[_Affected._]\n\nBOX. Generous, ill-fated being! [_Affected._]\n\nCOX. And to think that I tossed up for such a woman!\n\nBOX. When I remember that I staked such a treasure on the hazard of a\ndie!\n\nCOX. I'm sure, Mr. Box, I can't sufficiently thank you for your\nsympathy.\n\nBOX. And I'm sure, Mr. Cox, you couldn't feel more, if she had been\nyour own intended!\n\nCOX. _If_ she'd been _my own_ intended? She _was_ my own intended!\n\nBOX. _Your_ intended? Come, I like that! Didn't you very properly\nobserve just now, sir, that I proposed to her first?\n\nCOX. To which you very sensibly replied, that you'd come to an\nuntimely end.\n\nBOX. I deny it!\n\nCOX. I say you have!\n\nBOX. The fortune's mine!\n\nCOX. Mine!\n\nBOX. I'll have it!\n\nCOX. So will I!\n\nBOX. I'll go to law!\n\nCOX. So will I!\n\nBOX. Stop--a thought strikes me. Instead of going to law about the\nproperty, suppose we divide it.\n\nCOX. Equally?\n\nBOX. Equally. I'll take two thirds.\n\nCOX. That's fair enough--and I'll take three-fourths.\n\nBOX. That won't do. Half and half!\n\nCOX. Agreed! There's my hand upon it----\n\nBOX. And mine.\n\n[_About to shake hands--a Postman's knock heard at street door._\n\nCOX. Holloa! Postman again!\n\nBOX. Postman yesterday--postman to-day.--\n\n_Enter MRS. BOUNCER._\n\nMRS. B. Another letter, Mr. Cox--twopence more!\n\nCOX. I forgive you again! [_Taking letter._] Another trifle from\nMargate. [_Opens the letter--starts._] Goodness gracious!\n\nBOX. [_Snatching letter--starts._] Gracious goodness!\n\nCOX. [_Snatching letter again--reads._] \"Happy to inform you--false\nalarm\"--\n\nBOX. [_Overlooking._] \"Sudden squall--boat upset--Mrs. Wiggins, your\nintended\"--\n\nCOX. \"Picked up by a steamboat\"--\n\nBOX. \"Carried into Boulogne\"--\n\nCOX. \"Returned here this morning\"--\n\nBOX. \"Will start by early train, to-morrow\"--\n\nCOX. \"And be with you at ten o'clock, exact.\"\n\n[_Both simultaneously pull out their watches._\n\nBOX. Cox, I congratulate you--\n\nCOX. Box, I give you joy!\n\nBOX. I'm sorry that most important business of the Colonial Office\nwill prevent my witnessing the truly happy meeting between you and\nyour intended. Good-morning!\n\n[_Going._\n\nCOX. [_Stopping him._] It's obviously for me to retire.--Not for\nworlds would I disturb the rapturous meeting between you and your\nintended. Good morning!\n\nBOX. You'll excuse me, sir--but our last arrangement was, that she was\n_your_ intended.\n\nCOX. No, yours!\n\nBOX. Yours!\n\nTOGETHER. Yours!\n\n[_Ten o'clock strikes--noise of an omnibus._\n\nBOX. Ha! What's that? A cab's drawn up at the door! [_Running to\nwindow._] No--it's a twopenny omnibus!\n\nCOX. [_Leaning over BOX'S shoulder._] A lady's got out--\n\nBOX. There's no mistaking that majestic person--it's Penelope Ann!\n\nCOX. Your intended!\n\nBOX. Yours!\n\nCOX. Yours!\n\n[_Both run to door, L. C., and eagerly listen._\n\nBOX. Hark--she's coming up stairs!\n\nCOX. Shut the door!\n\n[_They slam the door, and both lean up against it with their backs._\n\nMRS. B. [_Without, and knocking._] Mr. Cox! Mr. Cox!\n\nCOX. [_Shouting._] I've just stepped out!\n\nBOX. So have I!\n\nMRS. B. Mr. Cox! [_Pushing at the door--COX and BOX redouble their\nefforts to keep their door shut._] Open the door! It's only me--Mrs.\nBouncer!\n\nCOX. Only you? Then where's the lady?\n\nMRS. B. Gone!\n\nCOX. Upon your honour?\n\nBOX. As a gentleman?\n\nMRS. B. Yes, and she's left a note for Mr. Cox.\n\nCOX. Give it to me!\n\nMRS. B. Then open the door!\n\nCOX. Put it under! [_A letter is put under the door; COX picks up the\nletter, and opens it._] Goodness Gracious!\n\nBOX. [_Snatching letter._] Gracious Goodness!\n\n[_COX snatches the letter, and runs forward, followed by BOX._\n\nCOX. [_Reading._] \"Dear Mr. Cox, pardon my candor\"--\n\nBOX. [_Looking over, and reading._] \"But being convinced that our\nfeelings, like our ages, do not reciprocate\"--\n\nCOX. \"I hasten to apprise you of my immediate union\"--\n\nBOX. \"With Mr. Knox.\"\n\nCOX. Huzza!\n\nBOX. Three cheers for Knox! Ha, ha, ha!\n\n[_Tosses the letter in the air, and begins dancing. COX does the\nsame._\n\nMRS. B. [_Putting her head in at door._] The little second floor back\nroom is quite ready!\n\nCOX. I don't want it!\n\nBOX. No more do I!\n\nCOX. What shall part us?\n\nBOX. What shall tear us asunder?\n\nCOX. Box!\n\nBOX. Cox! [_About to embrace--BOX stops, seizes COX'S hand, and looks\neagerly in his face._] You'll excuse the apparent insanity of the\nremark, but the more I gaze on your features, the more I'm convinced\nthat you're my long lost brother.\n\nCOX. The very observation I was going to make to you!\n\nBOX. Ah--tell me--in mercy tell me--have you such a thing as a\nstrawberry mark on your left arm?\n\nCOX. No!\n\nBOX. Then it is he!\n\n[_They rush into each other's arms._\n\nCOX. Of course we stop where we are?\n\nBOX. Of course!\n\nCOX. For, between you and me, I'm rather partial to this house.\n\nBOX. So am I--I begin to feel quite at home in it.\n\nCOX. Everything so clean and comfortable--\n\nBOX. And I'm sure the mistress of it, from what I have seen of her, is\nvery anxious to please.\n\nCOX. So she is--and I vote, Box, that we stick by her.\n\nBOX. Agreed! There's my hand upon it--join but your's--agree that the\nhouse is big enough to hold us both, then Box--\n\nCOX. And Cox--\n\nBOTH. Are satisfied!\n\n[_The Curtain Falls._\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note\n\nThis transcription is based on scanned images posted by the Internet\nArchive from a copy in the Library of Congress:\n\nhttp:\/\/archive.org\/details\/boxcoxromanceofr00mort\n\nThe following changes were noted:\n\n- p. 4: _Mrs. Vernon_--Inserted period after name for consistency.\n\n- p. 4: R.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1003,"split":"train"}
