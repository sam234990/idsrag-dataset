{"ori_id":"c85ec67ceff73b596af55bbd3cd88bfd37f622ec","title":"Hanna (film)","context":"Hanna (film)\n Hanna Heller (Saoirse Ronan) is a 15-year-old girl who lives with her father, Erik Heller (Eric Bana) in rural northern Finland, near Kuusamo. The film opens with her hunting and killing a reindeer.\nSince the age of two, Hanna has been trained by Erik, an ex-CIA operative from Germany, to be a skilled assassin. He teaches her hand-to-hand combat and drills her in target shooting. He left the agency, going incognito into the Arctic. Erik knows a secret that cannot become public, and Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett), a senior CIA officer, searches for him in order to eliminate him. Erik has trained Hanna with the intent that she will kill Marissa. Due to her upbringing in the wilderness, she is unfamiliar with many aspects of modern civilisation despite having read encyclopedias.\nOne night, Hanna tells Erik that she is \"ready\" to face their enemies. Erik digs up a radio beacon that eventually will alert the CIA to their presence. Although he warns Hanna that a confrontation with Marissa will be fatal for either her or Marissa, he leaves the final decision to Hanna who activates the beacon. Erik leaves, instructing her to meet him in Berlin. A special forces team arrives to capture Hanna and Erik, but Erik is already gone and while Hanna kills two soldiers, the rest of the soldiers assume Erik killed them before escaping.\nHanna is taken to an underground CIA complex where Marissa, being suspicious, sends a body double (Michelle Dockery) to talk to Hanna. While talking to the double Hanna starts to cry and crawls sobbing into the lap of the double, which makes her captors uneasy. They send some guards to her cell to sedate her. As they enter the cell, Hanna kills the double along with some of the guards and escapes.\nIn a flashback, Marissa is seen firing at a car that is carrying Hanna's mother, two-year-old Hanna, and Erik. The car crashes but the trio flees. Marissa shoots Johanna, but Erik escapes with Hanna into the woods.\nHanna finds herself on the run in the Moroccan desert, where she meets bohemian British people couple Sebastian (Jason Flemyng) and Rachel (Olivia Williams), who are on a camper-van holiday with their teenage daughter, Sophie (Jessica Barden), and their younger son, Miles (Aldo Maland). She stows away in the family's camper-van on the ferry ride to Spain seeking to reach Berlin. The family is nice to her, and she and Sophie become friends, even sharing a kiss together.\nMarissa hires Isaacs (Tom Hollander), a former agent, to capture Hanna. Hanna travels with the family as they drive north. Isaacs and two skinheads trail them and eventually corner Hanna and the family in France, but she manages to escape, killing one of the assailants. Marissa catches up with the British family and during interrogation finds out that Hanna is heading to Berlin.\nArriving at the address that Erik had told her, Hanna meets with Knepfler (Martin Wuttke), an eccentric old magician and a friend of Erik's, who lives in an abandoned amusement park. Hanna plans a rendezvous with her father. However, Marissa and Isaacs arrive. Hanna escapes, but overhears comments that suggest Erik is not her biological father.\nLater, Hanna goes to her grandmother's apartment where she finds her grandmother murdered. In a conversation Erik admits to Hanna that he is not her biological father. Erik once recruited pregnant women into a program where their children's DNA was enhanced in order to create super-soldiers. After the project was shut down, its subjects were eliminated.\nMarissa and Isaacs arrive, intent on killing them; Erik acts as a distraction to allow Hanna to escape. Erik kills Isaacs in a fight, but is shot by Marissa, who goes to Knepfler's house. Hanna is there, having just discovered Knepfler dead. They wound each other and eventually Marissa becomes disoriented from her wound, slows down and loses her weapon. Hanna finds the weapon and kills Marissa, echoing the deer hunting scene from the start of the film.\n<html>\n<head><title>Hanna Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Hanna script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Hanna script, Hanna movie script, Hanna film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

FOREST FLOOR - DAY. 1\n<\/b>\n          Winter. Silence on the forest floor. Snow falling. Then the\n          sound of breathing. The soft footfall of a person running.\n          HANNA, fourteen years old, long hair, eyes like blue ice,\n          glides through the trees, a bow strapped to her shoulder. She\n          is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes. She blends almost\n          completely into the landscape of trees and snow.\n          She stops dead. Her breath visible in the freezing air.\n          Suddenly alert, she has spotted her prey. A REINDEER nuzzling\n          the snow, trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat. Its head\n          pops up - danger. Too late. The sudden swoosh and the snap of\n          an arrow piercing its skin.\n          The deer flops to the ground with a thud. It whines, its feet\n          dig at the earth. Its mouth gnaws at the icy air. Steam\n          pouring from its nostrils.\n          HANNA approaches, removes a fur glove. She bends to her\n          knees.\n          She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face.\n          She runs her hand down along its neck, in towards the wound.\n\n<b>                         HANNA\n<\/b>          I just missed your heart.\n          She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist\n          holster.\n          She fires two shots directly at CAMERA.\n\n<b>          CUT TO TITLE: HANNA\n<\/b>\n<b>          2 EXT.

She reaches deep into the body cavity\n          and pulls out intestine, stomach, liver.\n          She freezes, sensing danger.\n          Her hand deep inside the animal. She listens. She looks out\n          into the still forest. No sound.\n          ERIK, mid forties, a mammoth with leathery face, stands\n          behind her like a ghost.\n\n<b>                         ERIK\n<\/b>          You're dead. Right now.

He blocks and thumps an open\n          palm on to HANNA's shoulder sending her sprawling into the\n          snow.\n          She leaps to her feet, as ERIK aims a kick at her head. She\n          dodges, punches below his knee cap, and goes for her\n          pistol. ERIK slaps the hand away.\n\n<b>          ERIK (CONT'D)\n<\/b>          Use your hands!\n          She goes for the gun again and again he stops her.\n          He moves in tight, pulling the gun from its holster and\n          tossing it deep into the forest.\n          HANNA clips ERIK'S temple sending him to the ground.\n          She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap...\n          ... but she can't.\n          He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow.\n          ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants. His face shows\n          a touch of frustration.\n          He plods into the forest.\n\n<b>          ERIK (CONT'D)\n<\/b>          Drag it back yourself.\n          HANNA drags herself to the deer's side.

FOREST FLOOR - EVENING 5\n<\/b>\n          HANNA drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled. She lifts\n          her knees high and moves at a steady pace.\n          Hidden among the trees, a little way off, ERIK is watching\n          her.\n\n<b>          6 EXT. LOG CABIN. NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - EVENING 6\n<\/b>\n          A log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the\n          thick forest. HANNA is standing in the snow, stripping the\n          deer with a knife. It's a tough job but she does it no fuss.\n\n<b>          7 INT. LOG CABIN - EVENING 7\n<\/b>\n          Almost everything ERIK and HANNA own they've made themselves\n          using what can be found in the forest. What few possessions\n          that have been brought in from the outside world are old and\n          worn.\n          HANNA is making a fire using a bow drill. The friction of the\n          drill produces an ember which HANNA carefully transfers to\n          some dried leaves.\n\n<b>          8 INT.

Then\n          she climbs the gate. She nearly tears her clothes on the\n          spikes at the top of the gate, then leaps over and,\n          exhausted, four days without real sleep, begins to walk up\n          the narrow tree-lined driveway.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n<b>          107.\n<\/b>\n<b>          197 EXT.

Then\n          runs further down into the tunnel.\n          Alerted by the sound of ISAACS' shot HANNA starts to pursue\n          her prey.\n\n<b>          204 INT. DORMITORY.

He fires, hits nothing and she\n          lets go - the bed comes crashing down on him again.\n          His torch rolls away.
