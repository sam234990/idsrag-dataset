{"ori_id":"4c428ffec939a3607a4da2e68ca684c03f6e8959","title":"The Fifth Queen","context":"The Fifth Queen\n The Fifth Queen trilogy has an omniscient narrator. Katharine Howard is introduced in the first book as a devout Roman Catholic, impoverished, young noblewoman escorted by her fiery cousin Thomas Culpeper. By accident, she comes to the attention of the king, in a minor way at first, is helped to a position as a lady in waiting for the then bastard Lady Mary, Henry's eldest daughter, by her old Latin tutor Nicholas Udal. Udal is a spy for Thomas Cromwell, the Lord Privy Seal.\nAs Katharine becomes involved with the many calculating, competing, and spying members of Henry VIII's Court, she gradually rises, almost against her will, in Court. She is brought more to the attention of the King, becomes involved with him, is used by Cromwell, Bishop Gardiner and Thomas Cranmer as well as the less powerful though more personally attached Nicholas Throckmorton. Her connection to the latter puts her in some peril, as in January 1554 he is suspected of complicity in Wyatt's Rebellion and arrested, during which time Katherine is also briefly implicated.\nKatharine's forthrightness, devotion to the Old Faith and learning are what make her attractive to the King, along with her youth and physical beauty. This is in direct contradiction to the way historians view the historical personage herself; that is, as a flighty and flirtatious young woman with few other redeeming qualities.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Fifth Queen, by Ford Madox Ford\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

He stood undecided in the mud of a lane in the Austin\nFriars. The quickset hedges on either side were only waist high and\ndid not shelter him. The little houses all round him of white daub\nwith grey corner beams had been part of the old friars' stables and\noffices. All that neighbourhood was a maze of dwellings and gardens,\nwith the hedges dry, the orchard trees bare with frost, the arbours\nwintry and deserted. This congregation of small cottages was like a\npatch of common that squatters had taken; the great house of the Lord\nPrivy Seal, who had pulled down the monastery to make room for it, was\na central mass. Its gilded vanes were in the shape of men at arms, and\ntore the ragged clouds with the banners on their lances. Nicholas Udal\nlooked at the roof and cursed the porter of it.\n\n'He could have given me a cup of hypocras,' he said, and muttered, as\na man to whom Latin is more familiar than the vulgar tongue, a\nhexameter about 'pocula plena.'\n\nHe had reached London before nine in one of the King's barges that\ncame from Greenwich to take musicians back that night at four. He had\nbreakfasted with the Lady Mary's women at six off warm small beer and\nfresh meat, but it was eleven already, and he had spent all his money\nupon good letters.\n\nHe muttered: '_Pauper sum, pateor, fateor, quod Di dant fero_,' but it\ndid not warm him.\n\nThe magister had been put in the Lady Mary's household by the Lord\nPrivy Seal, and he had a piece of news as to the Lady's means of\ntreasonable correspondence with the Emperor her uncle. He had imagined\nthat the news--which would hurt no one because it was imaginary--might\nbe worth some crowns to him. But the Lord Privy Seal and all his\nsecretaries had gone to Greenwich before it was light, and there was\nnothing there for the magister.\n\n'You might have known as much, a learned man,' the porter had snarled\nat him. 'Isn't the new Queen at Rochester? Would our lord bide here?\nDidn't your magistership pass his barge on the river?'\n\n'Nay, it was still dark,' the magister answered. The porter sniffed\nand slammed to the grating in the wicket. Being of the Old Faith he\nhated those Lutherans--or those men of the New Learning--that it\npleased his master to employ.\n\nUdal hesitated before the closed door; he hesitated in the lane beyond\nthe corner of the house. Perhaps there would be no barges at the\nsteps--no King's barges. The men of the Earl Marshal's service, being\nPapists, would pelt him with mud if he asked for a passage; even the\nProtestant lords' men would jeer at him if he had no pence for\nthem--and he had none. He would do best to wait for the musicians'\nbarge at four.\n\nThen he must eat and shelter--and find a wench. He stood in the mud:\nlong, thin, brown in his doctor's gown of fur, with his black flapped\ncap that buttoned well under his chin and let out his brown, lean,\nshaven and humorous face like a woodpecker's peering out of a hole in\na tree.\n\nThe volumes beneath his arms were heavy: they poked out his gown on\neach side, and the bitter cold pinched his finger ends as if they had\nbeen caught in a door. The weight of the books pleased him for there\nwas much good letters there--a book of Tully's epistles for himself\nand two volumes of Plautus' comedies for the Lady Mary. But what among\nhis day's purchases pleased him most was a medallion in silver he had\nbought in Cheapside. It showed on the one side Cupid in his sleep and\non the other Venus fondling a peacock. It was a heart-compelling gift\nto any wench or lady of degree.\n\nHe puckered up his deprecatory and comical lips as he imagined that\nthat medal would purchase him the right to sigh dolorously in front of\nwhatever stomacher it finally adorned. He could pour out odes in the\nlearned tongue, for the space of a week, a day, or an afternoon\naccording to the rank, the kindness or the patience of the recipient.\n\nSomething invisible and harsh touched his cheek. It might have been\nsnow or hail. He turned his thin cunning face to the clouds, and they\nthreatened a downpour. They raced along, like scarves of vapour, so\nlow that you might have thought of touching them if you stood on\ntiptoe.\n\nIf he went to Westminster Hall to find Judge Combers, he would get his\nbelly well filled, but his back wet to the bone. At the corner of the\nnext hedge was the wicket gate of old Master Grocer Badge. There the\nmagister would find at least a piece of bread, some salt and warmed\nmead. Judge Combers' wife was easy and bounteous: but old John Badge's\ndaughter was a fair and dainty morsel.\n\nHe licked his full lips, leered to one side, muttered, 'A curse on all\nlords' porters,' and made for John Badge's wicket. Badge's dwelling\nhad been part of the monastery's curing house. It had some good rooms\nand two low storeys--but the tall garden wall of the Lord Privy Seal\nhad been built against its side windows. It had been done without word\nor warning. Suddenly workmen had pulled down old Badge's pigeon house,\nset it up twenty yards further in, marked out a line and set up this\nhigh wall that pressed so hard against the house end that there was\nbarely room for a man to squeeze between. The wall ran for half a\nmile, and had swallowed the ground of twenty small householders. But\nnever a word of complaint had reached the ears of the Privy Seal other\nthan through his spies. It was, however, old Badge's ceaseless grief.\nHe had talked of it without interlude for two years.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Badges' room--their houseplace--was fair sized, but so low ceiled\nthat it appeared long, dark and mysterious in the winter light There\nwas a tall press of dark wood with a face minutely carved and fretted\nto represent the portal of Amiens Cathedral, and a long black table,\nlittered with large sheets of printed matter in heavy black type, that\ndiffused into the cold room a faint smell of ink. The old man sat\nquavering in the ingle. The light of the low fire glimmered on his\nsilver hair, on his black square cap two generations old; and, in his\nold eyes that had seen three generations of changes, it twinkled\nstarrily as if they were spinning round. In the cock forward of his\nshaven chin, and the settling down of his head into his shoulders,\nthere was a suggestion of sinister and sardonic malice. He was\nmuttering at his son:\n\n'A stiff neck that knows no bending, God shall break one day.'\n\nHis son, square, dark, with his sleeves rolled up showing immense\nmuscles developed at the levers of his presses, bent his black beard\nand frowned his heavy brows above his printings.\n\n'Doubtless God shall break His engine when its work is done,' he\nmuttered.\n\n'You call Privy Seal God's engine?' the old man quavered ironically.\n'Thomas Cromwell is a brewer's drunken son. I know them that have seen\nhim in the stocks at Putney not thirty years ago.'\n\nThe printer set two proofs side by side on the table and frowningly\ncompared them, shaking his head.\n\n'He is the flail of the monks,' he said abstractedly. 'They would have\nburned me and thousands more but for him.'\n\n'Aye, and he has put up a fine wall where my arbour stood.'\n\nThe printer took a chalk from behind his ear and made a score down his\npage.\n\n'A wall,' he muttered; 'my Lord Privy Seal hath set up a wall against\npriestcraft all round these kingdoms----'\n\n'Therefore you would have him welcome to forty feet of my garden?'\nthe old man drawled. 'He pulls down other folks' crucifixes and sets\nup his own walls with other folks' blood for mortar.'\n\nThe printer said darkly:\n\n'Papists' blood.'\n\nThe old man pulled his nose and glanced down.\n\n'We were all Papists in my day. I have made the pilgrimage to\nCompostella, for all you mock me now.'\n\nHe turned his head to see Magister Udal entering the door furtively\nand with eyes that leered round the room. Both the Badges fell into\nsudden, and as if guilty, silence.\n\n'_Domus parva, quies magna_,' the magister tittered, and swept across\nthe rushes in his furs to rub his hands before the fire. 'When shall I\nteach your Margot the learned tongues?'\n\n'When the sun sets in the East,' the printer muttered.\n\nUdal sent to him over his shoulder, as words of consolation:\n\n'The new Queen is come to Rochester.'\n\nThe printer heaved an immense sigh:\n\n'God be praised!'\n\nUdal snickered, still over his shoulder:\n\n'You see, neither have the men of the Old Faith put venom in her food,\nnor have the Emperor's galleys taken her between Calais and Sandwich.'\n\n'Yet she comes ten days late.'\n\n'Oh moody and suspicious artificer. _Afflavit deus!_ The wind hath\nblown dead against Calais shore this ten days.'\n\nThe old man pulled his long white nose:\n\n'In my day we could pray to St Leonard for a fair wind.'\n\nHe was too old to care whether the magister reported his words to\nThomas Cromwell, the terrible Lord Privy Seal, and too sardonic to\nkeep silence for long about the inferiority of his present day.\n\n'When shall I teach the fair Margot the learned tongue?' Udal asked\nagain.\n\n'When wolves teach conies how to play on pipes,' the master printer\nsnarled from his chest.\n\n'The Lord Privy Seal never stood higher,' Udal said. 'The match with\nthe Cleves Lady hath gained him great honour.'\n\n'God cement it!' the printer said fervently.\n\nThe old man pulled at his nose and gazed at nothing.\n\n'I am tired with this chatter of the woman from Cleves,' he croaked,\nlike a malevolent raven. 'An Anne she is, and a Lutheran. I mind we\nhad an Anne and a Lutheran for Queen before. She played the whore and\nlost her head.'\n\n'Where's your niece Margot?' Udal asked the printer.\n\n'You owe me nine crowns,' the old man said.\n\n'I will give your Margot ten crowns' worth of lessons in Latin.'\n\n'Hold and enough,' the printer muttered heavily. 'Tags from Seneca in\na wench's mouth are rose garlands on a cow's horns.'\n\n'The best ladies in the land learn of me,' Udal answered.\n\n'Aye, but my niece shall keep her virtue intact.'\n\n'You defame the Lady Mary of England,' Udal snickered.\n\nThe old man said vigorously, 'God save her highness, and send us her\nfor Queen. Have you begged her to get me redress in the matter of that\nwall?'\n\n'Why, Providence was kind to her when it sent her me for her master,'\nUdal said. 'I never had apter pupil saving only one.'\n\n'Shall Thomas Cromwell redress?' the old man asked.\n\n'If good learning can make a good queen, trust me to render her one,'\nUdal avoided the question. 'But alas! being declared bastard--for very\nexcellent reasons--she may not----'\n\n'You owe me nine crowns,' old Badge threatened him. He picked\nirritably at the fur on his gown and gazed at the carved leg of the\ntable. 'If you will not induce Privy Seal to pull down his wall I will\nset the tipstaves on you.'\n\nMaster Udal laughed. 'I will give thy daughter ten crowns' worth of\nlessons in the learned tongues.'\n\n'You will receive another broken crown, magister,' the younger John\nsaid moodily. 'Have you not scars enow by your wenching?'\n\nUdal pushed back the furs at his collar. 'Master Printer John Badge\nthe Younger,' he flickered, 'if you break my crown I will break your\nchapel. You shall never have license to print another libel. Give me\nyour niece in wedlock?'\n\nThe old man said querulously, 'Here's a wantipole without ten crowns\nwould marry a wench with three beds and seven hundred florins!'\n\nUdal laughed. 'Call her to bring me meat and drink,' he said. 'Large\nwords ill fill an empty stomach.'\n\nThe younger John went negligently to the great Flemish press. He\nopened the face and revealed on its dark shelves a patty of cold fish\nand a black jack. With heavy movements and a solemn face he moved\nthese things, with a knife and napkins, on to the broad black table.\n\nThe old man pulled his nose again and grinned.\n\n'Margot's in her chamber,' he chuckled. 'As you came up the wicket way\nI sent my John to turn the key upon her. It's there at his girdle.' It\nclinked indeed among rules, T-squares and callipers at each footstep\nof the heavy printer between press and table.\n\nMagister Udal stretched his thin hands towards it. 'I will give you\nthe printing of the Lady Mary's commentary of Plautus for that key,'\nhe said.\n\nThe printer murmured 'Eat,' and set a great pewter salt-cellar, carved\nlike a Flemish pikeman, a foot high, heavily upon the cloth.\n\nUdal had the appetite of a wolf. He pulled off his cap the better to\nlet his jaws work.\n\n'Here's a letter from the Doctor Wernken of Augsburg,' he said. 'You\nmay see how the Lutherans fare in Germany.'\n\nThe printer took the letter and read it, standing, frowning and heavy.\nMagister Udal ate; the old man fingered his furs and, leaning far back\nin his mended chair, gazed at nothing.\n\n'Let me have the maid in wedlock,' Udal grunted between two bites.\n'Better women have looked favourably upon me. I had a pupil in the\nNorth----'\n\n'She was a Howard, and the Howards are all whores,' the printer said,\nover the letter. 'Your Doctor Wernken writes like an Anabaptist.'\n\n'They are even as the rest of womenkind,' Udal laughed, 'but far\nquicker with their learning.'\n\nA boy rising twenty, in a grey cloak that showed only his bright red\nstockings and broad-toed red shoes, rattled the back door and slammed\nit to. He pulled off his cap and shook it.\n\n'It snows,' he said buoyantly, and then knelt before his grandfather.\nThe old man touched his grandson's cropped fair head.\n\n'_Benedicite_, grandson Hal Poins,' he muttered, and relapsed into his\ngaze at the fire.\n\nThe young man bent his knee to his uncle and bowed low to the\nmagister. Being about the court, he had for Udal's learning and office\na reverence that neither the printer nor his grandfather could share.\nHe unfastened his grey cloak at the neck and cast it into a corner\nafter his hat. His figure flashed out, lithe, young, a blaze of\nscarlet with a crowned rose embroidered upon a chest rendered enormous\nby much wadding. He was serving his apprenticeship as ensign in the\ngentlemen of the King's guard, and because his dead father had been\nbeloved by the Duke of Norfolk it was said that his full ensigncy was\nnear. He begged his grandfather's leave to come near the fire, and\nstood with his legs apart.\n\n'The new Queen's come to Rochester,' he said; 'I am here with the\nguard to take the heralds to Greenwich Palace.'\n\nThe printer looked at him unfavourably from the corner of his dark and\ngloomy eyes.\n\n'You come to suck up more money,' he said moodily. 'There is none in\nthis house.'\n\n'As Mary is my protectress!' the boy laughed, 'there is!' He stuck his\nhands into his breeches pocket and pulled out a big fistful of crowns\nthat he had won over-night at dice, and a long and thin Flemish chain\nof gold. 'I have enow to last me till the thaw,' he said. 'I came to\nbeg my grandfather's blessing on the first day of the year.'\n\n'Dicing ... Wenching ...' the printer muttered.\n\n'If I ask thee for no blessing,' the young man said, 'it's because,\nuncle, thou'rt a Lutheran that can convey none. Where's Margot? This\nchain's for her.'\n\n'The fair Margot's locked in her chamber,' Udal snickered.\n\n'Why-som-ever then? Hath she stolen a tart?'\n\n'Nay, but I would have her in wedlock.'\n\n'Thou--you--your magistership?' the boy laughed incredulously. The\nprinter caught in his tone his courtier's contempt for the artificer's\nhome, and his courtier's reverence for the magister's learning.\n\n'Keep thy sister from beneath this fox's tooth,' he said. 'The likes\nof him mate not with the like of us.'\n\n'The like of thee, uncle?' the boy retorted, with a good-humoured\ninsolence. 'My father was a gentleman.'\n\n'Who married my sister for her small money, and died leaving thee and\nthy sister to starve.'\n\n'Nay, I starve not,' the boy said. 'And Margot's a plump faggot.'\n\n'A very Cynthia among willow-trees,' the magister said.\n\n'Why, your magistership shall have her,' the boy said. 'I am her\nlawful guardian.'\n\nHis grandfather laughed as men laugh to see a colt kick up its heels\nin a meadow.\n\nBut the printer waved his bare arm furiously at the magister.\n\n'Get thee gone out of this decent house.' His eyes rolled, and his\nclenched fist was as large as a ham. 'Here you come not a-wenching.'\n\n'Moody man,' the magister said, 'your brains are addled with\nsuspicions.'\n\nThe young man swelled his scarlet breast still more consequentially.\n'This is no house of thine, uncle, but my grandfar's.'\n\n'Young ass's colt!' the printer fulminated. 'Would'st have thy sister\nundone by this Latin mouth-mincer?'\n\nUdal grinned at him, and licked his lips. The printer snarled:\n\n'Know'st thou not, young ass, that this man was thrown out of his\nmastership at Eton for his foul living?'\n\nUdal was suddenly on his feet with the long pasty-knife held back\namong the furs of his gown.\n\n'Ignoble ...' he began, but he lost his words in his trembling rage.\nThe printer snatched at his long measuring stick.\n\n'Down knife,' he grunted, for his fury, too, made his throat catch.\n\n'Have a care, nunkey,' the young man laughed at the pair of them.\n'They teach knife-thrusts in his Italian books.'\n\n'I will have thy printer's licence revoked, ignoble man,' the magister\nsaid, grinning hideously. 'Thou, a Lutheran, to turn upon me who was\nundone by Papist lies! They said I lived foully; they said I stole the\nsilver cellars....'\n\nHe turned upon the old man, stretching out the hand that held the\nknife in a passionate gesture:\n\n'Your Papists said that,' he appealed. 'But not a one of them believed\nit, though you dub me Lutheran.... See you, do I not govern now the\nchief Papist of you all? Would that be if they believed me filthy in\nmy living. Have I not governed in the house of the Howards, the lord\nof it being absent? Would that have been if they had believed it of\nme?... And then....' He turned again upon the printer. 'For the sake\nof your men ... for the sake of the New Learning, which God prosper, I\nwas cast down.'\n\nThe printer grunted surlily:\n\n''Tis known no wench is safe from thy amorousness. How many husbands\nhave broken thy pate?'\n\nThe magister threw the knife on to the table and rose, frostily\nrustling in his gown.\n\n'I shall bring thee down, ignoble man,' he said.\n\n'If thou hast the power to do that,' the old man asked suddenly,\n'wherefore canst not get me redress in the matter of my wall?'\n\nThe magister answered angrily:\n\n'Privy Seal hath swallowed thy land: he shall not disgorge. But this\nman he shall swallow. Know you not that you may make a jack swallow,\nbut no man shall make him give back; I, nor thou, nor the devil's\nself?'\n\n'Oh, a God's name bring not Flail Crummock into this household,' the\nyoung man cut in. 'Would you undo us all?'\n\n'Ignoble, ignoble, to twit a man with that Eton villainy,' the\nmagister answered.\n\n'A God's name bring not Privy Seal into the quarrel,' the young man\nrepeated. 'None of us of the Old Faith believe that lie.'\n\n'Keep thy tongue off Cromwell's name, young fool,' his grandfather\nsaid. 'We know not what walls have ears.'\n\nThe young man went pale: the printer himself went pale, remembering\nsuddenly that the magister was a spy of Cromwell's; all three of them\nhad their eyes upon Udal; only the old man, with his carelessness of\nhis great age, grinned with curiosity as if the matter were a play\nthat did not concern him. The magister was making for the door with\nthe books beneath his arm and a torturing smile round his lips. The\nboy, with a deep oath, ran out after him, a scarlet flash in the\ndarkening room.\n\nOld Badge pulled at his nose and grinned maliciously at the fire\nbeside him.\n\n'That is thy deliverer: that is thy flail of the monks,' he croaked at\nhis son. The printer gazed moodily at the fire.\n\n'Nay, it is but one of his servants,' he answered mechanically.\n\n'And such servants go up and down this realm of England and ride us\nwith iron bridles.' The old man laughed dryly and bitterly. 'His\nservant? See how we are held--we dare not shut our doors upon him\nsince he is Cromwell's servant, yet if he come in he shall ruin us,\ntake our money that we dare not refuse, deflower our virgins.... What\nthen is left to us between this setter up of walls and his servants?'\n\nThe printer, fingering the T-square in his belt, said, slowly, 'I\nthink this man loves too well that books should be printed in the\nLatin tongue to ruin any printer of them upon a private quarrel. Else\nI would get me across the seas.'\n\n'He loves any wench much better,' the old man answered maliciously.\n'Hearken!'\n\nThrough the wall there came a scuffling sound, thumps, and the noise\nof things falling. The wall there touched on the one that Cromwell had\nset up, so that there was bare room for a man to creep between.\n\n'Body of God,' the printer said, 'is he eavesdropping now?'\n\n'Nay, this is courtship,' the old man answered. His head leaned\nforward with a birdlike intentness; he listened with one hand held out\nas if to still any sound in the room. They heard footsteps from the\nfloor above, a laugh and voices. 'Now Margot talks to him from her\nwindow.'\n\nThe printer had a motion of convulsed rage:\n\n'I will break that knave's spine across my knee.'\n\n'Nay, let be,' the old man said. 'I command thee, who am thy father,\nto let the matter be.'\n\n'Would you have him ...' the printer began with a snarl.\n\n'I would not have my house burnt down because this Cromwell's spy's\nbody should be found upon our hands.... To-morrow the wench shall be\nsent to her aunt Wardle in Bedfordshire--aye, and she shall be soundly\nbeaten to teach her to love virtue.'\n\nThe young man opened the house door and came in, shivering in his\nscarlet because he had run out without his cloak.\n\n'A pretty medley you have made,' he said to his uncle, 'but I have\ncalmed him. Wherefore should not this magister marry Margot?' He made\nagain for the fire. 'Are we to smell always of ink?' He looked\ndisdainfully at his uncle's proofs, and began to speak with a boy's\nseriousness and ingenuous confidence. They would tell his uncle at\nCourt that if good print be the body of a book, good learning is even\nthe soul of it. At Court he would learn that it is thought this\nmagister shall rise high. There good learning is much prized. Their\nLord the King had been seen to talk and laugh with this magister. 'For\nour gracious lord loveth good letters. He is in such matters skilled\nbeyond all others in the realm.'\n\nThe old man listened to his grandson, smiling maliciously and with\npride; the printer shrugged his shoulders bitterly; the muffled sounds\nand the voices through the house-end continued, and the boy talked on,\nlaying down the law valiantly and with a cheerful voice.... He would\ngain advancement at Court through his sister's marriage with the\nmagister.\n\nGoing back to the palace at Greenwich along with the magister, in the\nbarge that was taking the heralds to the King's marriage with Anne of\nCleves, the young Poins was importunate with Udal to advance him in\nhis knowledge of the Italian tongue. He thought that in the books of\nthe Sieur Macchiavelli upon armies and the bearing of arms there were\nunfolded many secret passes with the rapier and the stiletto. But Udal\nlaughed good-humouredly. He had, he said, little skill in the Italian\ntongue, for it was but a bastard of classical begettings. And for\ninstruction in the books of the Sieur Macchiavelli, let young Poins go\nto a man who had studied them word by word--to the Lord Privy Seal,\nThomas Cromwell.\n\nThey both dropped their voices at the name, and, another gentleman of\nthe guard beginning to talk of rich men who had fallen low by the\nblock, the stake, and gaming, Udal mentioned that that day he had seen\na strange sight.\n\n'There was in the Northern parts, where I governed in his absence the\nLord Edmund Howard's children, a certain Thomas Culpepper. Main rich\nhe was, with many pastures and many thousands of sheep. A cousin of my\nlady's he was, for ever roaring about the house. A swaggerer he was,\nthat down there went more richly dressed than earls here.'\n\nThat day Udal had seen this Culpepper alone, without any servants,\ndressed in uncostly green, and dragging at the bridle of a mule, on\nwhich sat a doxy dressed in ancient and ragged furs. So did men fall\nin these difficult days.\n\n'How came he in London town?' the Norroy King-at-Arms asked.\n\n'Nay, I stayed not to ask him,' Udal answered. He sighed a little.\n'Yet then, in my Lord Edmund's house I had my best pupil of all, and\nfain was I to have news of her.... But he was a braggart; I liked him\nnot, and would not stay to speak with him.'\n\n'I'll warrant you had dealings with some wench he favoured, and you\nfeared a drubbing, magister,' Norroy accused him.\n\nThe long cabin of the state barge was ablaze with the scarlet and\nblack of the guards, and with the gold and scarlet of the heralds.\nMagister Udal sighed.\n\n'You had good, easy days in Lord Edmund's house?' Norroy asked.\n\n\nII\n\nThe Lord Privy Seal was beneath a tall cresset in the stern of his\nbarge, looking across the night and the winter river. They were rowing\nfrom Rochester to the palace at Greenwich, where the Court was\nawaiting Anne of Cleves. The flare of the King's barge a quarter of a\nmile ahead moved in a glowing patch of lights and their reflections,\nas though it were some portent creeping in a blaze across the sky.\nThere was nothing else visible in the world but the darkness and a\ndusky tinge of red where a wave caught the flare of light further out.\n\nHe stood invisible behind the lights of his cabin; and the thud of\noars, the voluble noises of the water, and the crackling of the\ncresset overhead had, too, the quality of impersonal and supernatural\nphenomena. His voice said harshly:\n\n'It is very cold; bring me my greatest cloak.'\n\nThrockmorton, the one of Cromwell's seven hundred spies who at that\ntime was his most constant companion, was hidden in the deep shadow\nbeside the cabin-door. His bearded and heavy form obscured the light\nfor a moment as he hurried to fetch the cloak. But merely to be the\nLord Cromwell's gown-bearer was in those days a thing you would run\nafter; and an old man in a flat cap--the Chancellor of the\nAugmentations, who had been listening intently at the door--was\nalready hurrying out with a heavy cloak of fur. Cromwell let it be\nhung about his shoulders.\n\nThe Chancellor shivered and said, 'We should be within a quarter-hour\nof Greenwich.'\n\n'Get you in if you be cold,' Cromwell answered. But the Chancellor was\nquivering with the desire to talk to his master. He had seen the heavy\nKing rush stumbling down the stairs of the Cleves woman's lodging at\nRochester, and the sight had been for him terrible and prodigious. It\nwas Cromwell who had made him Chancellor of the Augmentations--who had\neven invented the office to deal with the land taken from the\nAbbeys--and he was so much the creature of this Lord Privy Seal that\nit seemed as if the earth was shivering all the while for the fall of\nthis minister, and that he himself was within an inch of the ruin,\nexecration, and death that would come for them all once Cromwell were\ndown.\n\nThrockmorton, a giant man with an immense golden beard, issued again\nfrom the cabin, and the Privy Seal's voice came leisurely and cold:\n\n'What said Lord Cassilis of this? And the fellow Knighton? I saw them\nat the stairs.'\n\nPrivy Seal had such eyes that it was delicate work lying to him. But\nThrockmorton brought out heavily:\n\n'Cassilis, that this Lady Anne should never be Queen.'\n\n'Aye, but she must,' the Chancellor bleated. He had been bribed by two\nof the Cleves lords to get them lands in Kent when the Queen should\nbe in power. Cromwell's silence made Throckmorton continue against his\nwill:\n\n'Knighton, that the Queen's breath should turn the King's stomach\nagainst you! Dr. Miley, the Lutheran preacher, that by this evening's\nwork the Kingdom of God on earth was set trembling, the King having\nthe nature of a lecher....'\n\nHe tried to hold back. After all, it came into his mind, this man was\nnearly down. Any one of the men upon whom he now spied might come to\nbe his master very soon. But Cromwell's voice said, 'And then?' and he\nmade up his mind to implicate none but the Scotch lord, who was at\nonce harmless and unliable to be harmed.\n\n'Lord Cassilis,' he brought out, 'said again that your lordship's head\nshould fall ere January goes out.'\n\nHe seemed to feel the great man's sneer through the darkness, and was\ncoldly angry with himself for having invented no better lie. For if\nthis invisible and threatening phantom that hid itself among these\nshadows outlasted January he might yet outlast some of them. He\nwondered which of Cromwell's innumerable ill-wishers it might best\nserve him to serve. But for the Chancellor of the Augmentations the\nheavy silence of calamity, like the waiting at a bedside for death to\ncome, seemed to fall upon them. He imagined that the Privy Seal hid\nhimself in that shadow in order to conceal a pale face and shaking\nknees. But Cromwell's voice came harsh and peremptory to Throckmorton:\n\n'What men be abroad at this night season? Ask my helmsmen.'\n\nTwo torchlights, far away to the right, wavered shaking trails in the\nwater that, thus revealed, shewed agitated and chopped by small waves.\nThe Chancellor's white beard shook with the cold, with fear of\nCromwell, and with curiosity to know how the man looked and felt. He\nventured at last in a faint and bleating voice:\n\nWhat did his lordship think of this matter? Surely the King should\nespouse this lady and the Lutheran cause.\n\nCromwell answered with inscrutable arrogance:\n\n'Why, your cause is valuable. But this is a great matter. Get you in\nif you be cold.'\n\nThrockmorton appeared noiselessly at his elbow, whilst the Chancellor\nwas mumbling: 'God forbid I should be called Lutheran.'\n\nThe torches, Throckmorton said, were those of fishers who caught eels\noff the mud with worms upon needles.\n\n'Such night work favours treason,' Cromwell muttered. 'Write in my\nnotebook, \"The Council to prohibit the fishing of eels by night.\"'\n\n'What a nose he hath for treasons,' the Chancellor whispered to\nThrockmorton as they rustled together into the cabin. Throckmorton's\nface was gloomy and pensive. The Privy Seal had chosen none of his\ninformations for noting down. Assuredly the time was near for him to\nfind another master.\n\nThe barge swung round a reach, and the lights of the palace of\nGreenwich were like a flight of dim or bright squares in mid air, far\nahead. The King's barge was already illuminating the crenellated arch\nat the top of the river steps. A burst of torches flared out to meet\nit and disappeared. The Court was then at Greenwich, nearly all the\nlords, the bishops and the several councils lying in the Palace to\nawait the coming of Anne of Cleves on the morrow. She had reached\nRochester that evening after some days' delay at Calais, for the\nwinter seas. The King had gone that night to inspect her, having been\ngiven to believe that she was soberly fair and of bountiful charms.\nHis courteous visit had been in secret and in disguise; therefore\nthere were no torchmen in the gardens, and darkness lay between the\nriver steps and the great central gateway. But a bonfire, erected by\nthe guards to warm themselves in the courtyard, as it leapt up or\nsubsided before the wind, shewed that tall tower pale and high or\nvanishing into the night with its carved stone garlands, its stone men\nat arms, its lions, roses, leopards, and naked boys. The living houses\nran away from the foot of the tower, till the wings, coming towards\nthe river, vanished continually into shadows. They were low by\ncomparison, gabled with false fronts over each set of rooms and, in\nthe glass of their small-paned windows, the reflection of the fire\ngleamed capriciously from unexpected shadows. This palace was called\nPlacentia by the King because it was pleasant to live in.\n\nCromwell mounted the steps with a slow gait and an arrogant figure.\nUnder the river arch eight of his gentlemen waited upon him, and in\nthe garden the torches of his men shewed black yew trees cut like\npeacocks, clipped hedges like walls with archways above the broad and\ntiled paths, and fountains that gleamed and trickled as if secretly in\nthe heavy and bitter night.\n\nA corridor ran from under the great tower right round the palace. It\nwas full of hurrying people and of grooms who stood in knots beside\ndoorways. They flattened themselves against the walls before the Lord\nPrivy Seal's procession of gentlemen in black with white staves, and\nthe ceilings seemed to send down moulded and gilded stalactites to\ntouch his head. The beefeater before the door of the Lady Mary's\nlodgings spat upon the ground when he had passed. His hard glance\ntravelled along the wall like a palpable ray, about the height of a\nman's head. It passed over faces and slipped back to the gilded\nwainscoting; tiring-women upon whom it fell shivered, and the serving\nmen felt their bowels turn within them. His round face was hard and\nalert, and his lips moved ceaselessly one upon another. All those\nserving people wondered to see his head so high, for already it was\nknown that the King had turned sick at the sight of his bedfellow that\nshould be. And indeed the palace was only awake at that late hour\nbecause of that astounding news, dignitaries lingering in each other's\nquarters to talk of it, whilst in the passages their waiting men\nsupplied gross commentaries.\n\nHe entered his door. In the ante-room two men in his livery removed\nhis outer furs deftly so as not to hinder his walk. Before the fire of\nhis large room a fair boy knelt to pull off his jewelled gloves, and\nHanson, one of his secretaries, unclasped from his girdle the corded\nbag that held the Privy Seal. He laid it on a high stand between two\ntall candles of wax upon the long table.\n\nThe boy went with the gloves and Hanson disappeared silently behind\nthe dark tapestry in the further corner. Cromwell was meditating above\na fragment of flaming wood that the fire had spat out far into the\ntiled fore-hearth. He pressed it with his foot gently towards the\nblaze of wood in the chimney.\n\nHis plump hands were behind his back, his long upper lip ceaselessly\ncaressed its fellow, moving as one line of a snake's coil glides above\nanother. The January wind crept round the shadowy room behind the\ntapestry, and as it quivered stags seemed to leap over bushes, hounds\nto spring in pursuit, and a crowned Diana to move her arms, taking an\narrow from a quiver behind her shoulder. The tall candles guarded the\nbag of the Privy Seal, they fluttered and made the gilded heads on the\nrafters have sudden grins on their faces that represented kings with\nflowered crowns, queens with their hair combed back on to pillows, and\npages with scolloped hats. Cromwell stepped to an aumbry, where there\nwere a glass of wine, a manchet of bread, and a little salt. He began\nto eat, dipping pieces of bread into the golden salt-cellar. The face\nof a queen looked down just above his head with her eyes wide open as\nif she were amazed, thrusting her head from a cloud.\n\n'Why, I have outlived three queens,' he said to himself, and his round\nface resignedly despised his world and his times. He had forgotten\nwhat anxiety felt like because the world was so peopled with\nblunderers and timid fools full of hatred.\n\nThe marriage with Cleves was the deathblow to the power of the Empire.\nWith the Protestant Princes armed behind his back, the imbecile called\nCharles would never dare to set his troops on board ship in Flanders\nto aid the continual rebellions, conspiracies and risings in England.\nHe had done it too often, and he had repented as often, at the last\nmoment. It was true that the marriage had thrown Charles into the arms\nof France: the French King and he were at that very minute supping\ntogether in Paris. They would be making treaties that were meant to be\nbroken, and their statesmen were hatching plots that any scullion\nwould reveal. Francis and his men were too mean, too silly, too\ndespicable, and too easily bribed to hold to any union or to carry out\nany policy....\n\nHe sipped his wine slowly. It was a little cold, so he set it down\nbeside the fire. He wanted to go to bed, but the Archbishop was coming\nto hear how Henry had received his Queen, and to pour out his fears.\nFears! Because the King had been sick at sight of the Cleves woman! He\nhad this King very absolutely in his power; the grey, failing but\nvindictive and obstinate mass known as Henry was afraid of his\ncontempt, afraid really of a shrug of the shoulder or a small sniff.\n\nWith the generosity of his wine and the warmth of his fire, his\nthoughts went many years ahead. He imagined the King either married to\nor having repudiated the Lady from Cleves, and then dead. Edward, the\nSeymour child, was his creature, and would be king or dead. Cleves\nchildren would be his creations too. Or if he married the Lady Mary he\nwould still be next the throne.\n\nHis mind rested luxuriously and tranquilly on that prospect. He would\nbe perpetually beside the throne, there would be no distraction to\nmaintain a foothold. He would be there by right; he would be able to\ngive all his mind to the directing of this world that he despised for\nits baseness, its jealousies, its insane brawls, its aimless\nselfishness, and its blind furies. Then there should be no more war,\nas there should be no more revolts. There should be no more\njealousies; for kingcraft, solid, austere, practical and inspired,\nshould keep down all the peoples, all the priests, and all the nobles\nof the world. 'Ah,' he thought, 'there would be in France no power to\nshelter traitors like Brancetor.' His eyes became softer in the\ncontemplation of this Utopia, and he moved his upper lip more slowly.\n\nNow the Archbishop was there. Pale, worn with fears and agitation, he\ncame to say that the King had called to him Bishop Gardiner and the\nmore Catholic lords of the Council. Cranmer's own spy Lascelles had\nmade this new report.\n\nHis white sleeves made a shivering sound, the fur that fell round his\nneck was displaced on one shoulder. His large mouth was open with\npanic, his lips trembled, and his good-natured and narrow eyes seemed\nabout to drop tears.\n\n'Your Grace knoweth well what passed to-night at Rochester,' Cromwell\nsaid. He clapped his hands for a man to snuff the candles. 'You have\nthe common report.'\n\n'Ah, is it even true?' The Archbishop felt a last hope die, and he\nchoked in his throat. Cromwell watched the man at the candles and\nsaid:\n\n'Your Grace hath a new riding mule. I pray it may cease to affright\nyou.'\n\n'Why?' he said, as the man went. 'The King's Highness went even to\nRochester, disguised, since it was his good pleasure, as a French\nlord. You have seen the lady. So his Highness was seized with a make\nof palsy. He cursed to his barge. I know no more than that.'\n\n'And now they sit in the council.'\n\n'It seems,' Cromwell said.\n\n'Ah, dear God have mercy.'\n\nThe Archbishop's thin hands wavered before the crucifix on his breast,\nand made the sign of the cross.\n\nThe very faces of his enemies seemed visible to him. He saw Gardiner,\nof Winchester, with his snake's eyes under the flat cap, and the Duke\nof Norfolk with his eyes malignant in a long, yellow face. He had a\nvision of the King, a huge red lump beneath the high dais at the head\nof the Council table, his face suffused with blood, his cheeks\nquivering.\n\nHe wrung his hands and wondered if at Smithfield the Lutherans would\npray for him, or curse him for having been lukewarm.\n\n'Why, goodman gossip,' Cromwell said compassionately, 'we have been\nnearer death ten times.' He uttered his inmost thoughts out of\npity:--All this he had awaited. The King's Highness by the report of\nhis painters, his ambassadors, his spies--they were all in the pay of\nCromwell--had awaited a lady of modest demeanour, a coy habit, and a\ngreat and placid fairness. 'I had warned the Almains at Rochester to\nattire her against our coming. But she slobbered with ecstasy and\nslipped sideways, aiming at a courtesy. Therefore the King was hot\nwith new anger and disgust.'\n\n'You and I are undone.' Cranmer was passive with despair.\n\n'He is very seldom an hour of one mind,' Cromwell answered. 'Unless in\nthat hour those you wot of shall work upon him, it will go well with\nus.'\n\n'They shall. They shall.'\n\n'I wait to see.'\n\nThere seemed to Cranmer something horrible in this impassivity. He\nwished his leader to go to the King, and he had a frantic moment of\nimagining himself running to a great distance, hiding his head in\ndarkness.\n\nCromwell's lips went up in scorn. 'Do you imagine the yellow duke\nspeaking his mind to the King? He is too craven.'\n\nA heavy silence fell between them. The fire rustled, the candles again\nneeded snuffing.\n\n'Best get to bed,' Cromwell said at last.\n\n'Could I sleep?' Cranmer had the irritation of extreme fear. His\nmaster seemed to him to have no bowels. But the waiting told at last\nupon Cromwell himself.\n\n'I could sleep an you would let me,' he said sharply. 'I tell you the\nKing shall be another man in the morning.'\n\n'Ay, but now. But now....' He imagined the pens in that distant room\ncreaking over the paper with their committals, and he wished to\nupbraid Cromwell. It was his policy of combining with Lutherans that\nhad brought them to this.\n\nHeavy thundering came on the outer door.\n\n'The King comes,' Cromwell cried victoriously. He went swiftly from\nthe room. The Archbishop closed his eyes and suddenly remembered the\ntime when he had been a child.\n\nPrivy Seal had an angry and contemptuous frown at his return. 'They\nhave kept him from me.' He threw a little scroll on to the table. Its\nwhite silence made Cranmer shudder; it seemed to have something of the\nheavy threatening of the King's self.\n\n'We may go to bed,' Cromwell said. 'They have devised their shift.'\n\n'You say?'\n\n'They have temporised, they have delayed. I know them.' He quoted\ncontemptuously from the letter: 'We would have you send presently to\nask of the Almain Lords with the Lady Anne the papers concerning her\npre-contract to the Duke of Lorraine.'\n\nCranmer was upon the point of going away in the joy of this respite.\nBut his desire to talk delayed him, and he began to talk about the\ncanon law and pre-contracts of marriage. It was a very valid cause of\nnullity all the doctors held.\n\n'Think you I have not made very certain the pre-contract was\nnullified? This is no shift,' and Cromwell spoke wearily and angrily.\n'Goodman Archbishop, dry your tears. To-night the King is hot with\ndisgust, but I tell you he will not cast away his kingdom upon whether\nher teeth be white or yellow. This is no woman's man.'\n\nCranmer came nearer the fire and stretched out his lean hands.\n\n'He hath dandled of late with the Lady Cassilis.'\n\n'Well, he hath been pleasant with her.'\n\nCranmer urged: 'A full-blown man towards his failing years is more\nprone to women than before.'\n\n'Then he may go a-wenching.' He began to speak with a weary passion.\nTo cast away the Lady Anne now were a madness. It would be to stand\nwithout a friend before all nations armed to their downfall. This King\nwould do no jot to lose a patch upon his sovereignty.\n\nCranmer sought to speak.\n\n'His Highness is always hot o'nights,' Cromwell kept on. 'It is in his\nnature so to be. But by morning the German princes shall make him\nafraid again and the Lutherans of this goodly realm. Those mad swine\nour friends!'\n\n'He will burn seven of them on to-morrow sennight,' Cranmer said.\n\n'Nay! I shall enlarge them on Wednesday.'\n\nCranmer shivered. 'They grow very insolent. I am afraid.'\n\nCromwell answered with a studied nonchalance:\n\n'My bones tell me it shall be an eastward wind. It shall not rain on\nthe new Queen's bridals.' He drank up his warm wine and brushed the\ncrumbs from the furs round his neck.\n\n'You are a very certain man,' the Archbishop said.\n\nGoing along the now dark corridors he was afraid that some ruffling\nboy might spring upon him from the shadows. Norfolk, as the Earl\nMarshal, had placed his lodgings in a very distant part of the palace\nto give him long journeys that, telling upon his asthma, made him\narrive breathless and convulsed at the King's rooms when he was sent\nfor.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe shadow of the King kept hands from throats in the palace, but\ngrooms were breaking each others' heads in the stables till towards\nmorning. They fought about whether it were lawful to eat fish on a\nFriday, and just after daybreak a gentleman's oarsman from\nSittingbourne had all his teeth to swallow for asserting that the\nsacrament should be administered in the two kinds. The horses were\nwatered by ostlers who hummed the opprobrious song about Privy Seal,\ncalled 'Crummock.'\n\nIn the hillocks and lawns of the park round the palace Lutherans\nwaited all night to welcome their Queen. They lit small fires on the\nturf and, standing round them, sang triumphal hymns. A Princess was\ncoming from Cleves, a Lutheran; the day-spring from on high was\nvisiting them; soon, soon now, the axe and the flail should be given\ninto their hands.\n\nIn the dawn their boats could be seen pulling like water-beetles all\nacross the pallid river from the Essex shores. They clustered in grey\nmasses round the common steps.\n\nA German horse merchant from the City pulled a putrid cat out of the\nriver mud and held it over his head. He shrieked: 'Hic hocus pocus,'\nparodying the '_Hoc corpus meum_' of the Mass. The soldiers of the\nDuke of Norfolk were unable to reach him for the crowd. There were but\nten of them, under a captain, set to guard the little postern in the\nside wall of the garden. Towards ten o'clock the Mayor of London came\nby land. He had with him all his brotherhood with their horses and\narmed guards in a long train. The mayor and his aldermen had entrance\ninto the palace, but the Duke had given orders that men and horses\nmust bide in the park. There were forty battles of them, each of one\nhundred men.\n\nThe great body came in sight, white, shining even in the grey among\nthe trees along the long garden wall.\n\n'Body of God,' the captain said, 'there shall be broken crowns.' He\nbade his men hold their pikes across, and paced unconcernedly up and\ndown before the door.\n\nThe City men came down in a solid body, and at sight of the red\ncrosses on their white shoulders the Lutherans set up a cry of 'Rome,\nRome.' Their stones began to fly at once, and, because they pressed so\nclosely in, the City bowmen had no room to string their bows. The\ncitizens struck out with their silvered staves, but the heavy armour\nunder their white surcoats hindered them. The Lutherans cried out\nthat the Kingdom of God was come on earth because a Queen from Cleves\nwas at hand.\n\nAn alderman's charger was struck by a stone. It broke loose and\ncrashed all foaming and furious through a tripe stall on which a\npreacher was perched to hold forth. The riot began then. All in among\nthe winter trees the City men in their white and silver were fighting\nwith the Lutherans in their grey frieze. The citizens' hearts were\nenraged because their famous Dominican preacher had been seized by the\nArchbishop and spirited into Kent. They cried to each other to avenge\nDr. Latter on these lowsels.\n\nMen struck out at all and sundry. A woman, covered to the face in a\nfur hood and riding a grey mule, was hit on the arm by the\nquarterstaff of a Protestant butcher from the Crays, because she wore\na crucifix round her neck. She covered her face and shrieked\nlamentably. A man in green at the mule's head, on the other side,\nsprang like a wild cat under the beast's neck. His face blazed white,\nhis teeth shone like a dog's, he screamed and struck his dagger\nthrough the butcher's throat.\n\nHis motions were those of a mad beast; he stabbed the mule in the\nshoulder to force it to plunge in the direction of the soldiers who\nkept the little gate, before in the throng the butcher had reached the\nground. The woman was flogging at the mule with her reins. 'I have\nkilled 'un,' he shrieked.\n\nHe dived under the pikes of the soldiers and gripped the captain by\nboth shoulders. 'We be the cousins of the Duke of Norfolk,' he cried.\nHis square red beard trembled beneath his pallid face, and suddenly he\nbecame speechless with rage.\n\nHands were already pulling the woman from her saddle, but the guards\nheld their pikes transversely against the faces of the nearest,\ncrushing in noses and sending sudden streaks of blood from jaws. The\nuproar was like a hurricane and the woman's body, on high, swayed into\nthe little space that the soldiers held. She was crying with the pain\nof her arm that she held with her other hand. Her cousin ran to her\nand mumbled words of inarticulate tenderness, ending again in 'I have\nkilled 'un.'\n\nThe mob raged round them, but the soldiers stood firm enough. A\ncontinual cry of 'Harlot, harlot,' went up. Stones were scarce on the\nsward of the park, but a case bottle aimed at the woman alighted on\nthe ear of one of the guards. It burst in a foam of red, and he fell\nbeneath the belly of the mule with a dry grunt and the clang of iron.\nThe soldiers put down the points of their pikes and cleared more\nground. Men lay wallowing there when they retreated.\n\nThe man shouted at the captain: 'Can you clear us a way to yon\nstairs?' and, at a shake of the head, 'Then let us enter this gate.'\n\nThe captain shook his head again.\n\n'I am Thomas Culpepper. This is the Duke's niece, Kat,' the other\nshouted.\n\nThe captain observed him stoically from over his thick and black\nbeard.\n\n'The King's Highness is within this garden,' he said. He spoke to the\nporter through the little niche at the wicket. A company of the City\nsoldiers, their wands beating like flails, cleared for a moment the\nspace in front of the guards.\n\nCulpepper with the hilt of his sword was hammering at the studded\ndoor. The captain caught him by the shoulder and sent him to stagger\nagainst the mule's side. He was gasping and snatched at his hilt. His\nbonnet had fallen off, his yellow hair was like a shock of wheat, and\nhis red beard flecked with foam that spattered from his mouth.\n\n'I have killed one. I will kill thee,' he stuttered at the captain.\nThe woman caught him round the neck.\n\n'Oh, be still,' she shrieked. 'Still. Calm. Y' kill me.' She clutched\nhim so closely that he was half throttled. The captain paced stoically\nup and down before the gate.\n\n'Madam,' he said, 'I have sent one hastening to his duke-ship.\nDoubtless you shall enter.' He bent to pull the soldier from beneath\nthe mule's belly by one foot, and picking up his pike, leaned it\nagainst the wall.\n\nWith his face pressed against his cousin's furred side, Thomas\nCulpepper swore he would cut the man's throat.\n\n'Aye, come back again,' he answered. 'They call me Sir Christopher\nAske.'\n\nThe red jerkins of the King's own guards came in a heavy mass round\nthe end of the wall amid shrieks and curses. Their pike-staves rose\nrhythmically and fell with dull thuds; with their clumsy gloved hands\nthey caught at throats, and they threw dazed men and women into the\nspace that they had cleared before the wall. There armourers were\nready, with handcuffs and leg-chains hanging like necklaces round\ntheir shoulders.\n\nThe door in the wall opened silently, the porter called through his\nniche: 'These have leave to enter.' Thomas Culpepper shouted\n'Coneycatcher' at the captain before he pulled the mule's head round.\nThe beast hung back on his hand, and he struck it on its closed eyes\nin a tumult of violent rage. It stumbled heavily on the threshold, and\nthen darted forward so swiftly that he did not hear the direction of\nthe porter that they should turn only at the third alley.\n\nTall and frosted trees reached up into the dim skies, the deserted\navenues were shrouded in mist, and there was a dead and dripping\nsilence.\n\n'Seven brawls y' have brought me into,' the woman's voice came from\nunder her hood, 'this weary journey.'\n\nHe ran to her stirrup and clutched her glove to his forehead. 'Y'ave\ncalmed me,' he said. 'Your voice shall ever calm me.'\n\nShe uttered a hopeless 'Oh, aye,' and then, 'Where be we?'\n\nThey had entered a desolate region of clipped yews, frozen fountains,\nand high, trimmed hedges. He dragged the mule after him. Suddenly\nthere opened up a very broad path, tiled for a width of many feet. On\nthe left it ran to a high tower's gaping arch. On the right it sloped\nnobly into a grey stretch of water.\n\n'The river is even there,' he muttered. 'We shall find the stairs.'\n\n'I would find my uncle in this palace,' she said. But he muttered,\n'Nay, nay,' and began to beat the mule with his fist. It swerved, and\nshe became sick and dizzy with the sudden jar on her hurt arm. She\nswayed in her saddle and, in a sudden flaw of wind, her old and torn\nfurs ruffled jaggedly all over her body.\n\n\nIV\n\nThe King was pacing the long terrace on the river front. He had been\nthere since very early, for he could not sleep at nights, and had no\nappetite for his breakfast. When a gentleman from the postern gate\nasked permission for Culpepper and the mule to pass to the private\nstairs, he said heavily:\n\n'Let me not be elbowed by cripples,' and then: 'A' God's name let them\ncome,' changing his mind, as was his custom after a bad night, before\nhis first words had left his thick, heavy lips. His great brow was\nfurrowed, his enormous bulk of scarlet, with the great double dog-rose\nembroidered across the broad chest, limped a little over his right\nknee and the foot dragged. His eyes were bloodshot and heavy, his head\nhung forward as though he were about to charge the world with his\nforehead. From time to time his eyebrows lifted painfully, and he\nswallowed with an effort as if he were choking.\n\nBehind him the three hundred windows of the palace Placentia seemed to\npeer at him like eyes, curious, hostile, lugubrious or amazed. He tore\nviolently at his collar and muttered: 'I stifle.' His great hand was\nswollen by its glove, sewn with pearls, to an immense size.\n\nThe gentleman told him of the riot in the park, and narrated the\nblasphemy of the German Lutheran, who had held up a putrid dog in\nparody of the Holy Mass.\n\nThe face of the King grew suffused with purple blood.\n\n'Let those men be cut down,' he said, and he conceived a sorting out\nof all heresy, a cleansing of his land with blood. He looked swiftly\nat the low sky as if a thunderbolt or a leprosy must descend upon his\nhead. He commanded swiftly, 'Let them be taken in scores. Bid the\ngentlemen of my guard go, and armourers with shackles.'\n\nThe sharp pain of the ulcer in his leg gnawed up to his thigh, and he\nstood, dejected, like a hunted man, with his head hanging on his\nchest, so that his great bonnet pointed at the ground. He commanded\nthat both Privy Seal and the Duke of Norfolk should come to him there\nupon the instant.\n\nThis grey and heavy King, who had been a great scholar, dreaded to\nread in Latin now, for it brought the language of the Mass into his\nmind; he had been a composer of music and a skilful player on the\nlute, but no music and no voices could any more tickle his ears.\n\nWomen he had loved well in his day. Now, when he desired rest, music,\ngood converse and the love of women, he was forced to wed with a\ncreature whose face resembled that of a pig stuck with cloves. He had\nraged over-night, but, with the morning, he had seen himself growing\nold, on a tottering throne, assailed by all the forces of the Old\nFaith in Christendom. Rebellions burst out like fires every day in all\nthe corners of his land. He had no men whom he could trust: if he\ngranted a boon to one party it held them only for a day, and the other\nside rose up. Now he rested upon the Lutherans, whom he hated, and,\nstanding on that terrace, he had watched gloomily the great State\nbarges of the Ambassadors from the Empire and from France come with\nmajestic ostentation downstream abreast, to moor side by side against\nthe steps of his water-gate.\n\nIt was a parade of their new friendship. Six months ago their trains\ncould not have mingled without bloodshed.\n\nAt last there stood before him Thomas Cromwell, un-bonneted, smiling,\nhumorous, supple and confident for himself and for his master's cause,\na man whom his Prince might trust. And the long melancholy and\nsinister figure of the Duke of Norfolk stalked stiffly down among the\nyew trees powdered with frost. The furs from round his neck fluttered\nabout his knees like the wings of a crow, and he dug his Earl\nMarshal's golden staff viciously into the ground. He waved his\njewelled cap and stood still at a little distance. Cromwell regarded\nhim with a sinister and watchful amusement; he looked back at Privy\nSeal with a black malignancy that hardened his yellow features, his\nhooked nose and pursed lips into the likeness of a mask representing\nhatred.\n\nThis Norfolk was that Earl of Surrey who had won Flodden Field. They\nall then esteemed him the greatest captain of his day--in the field a\ncommander sleepless, cunning, cautious, and, in striking, a Hotspur.\n\nA dour and silent man, he was the head of all the Catholics, of all\nthe reaction of that day. But, in the long duel between himself and\nCromwell he had seemed fated to be driven from post to post, never\ndaring to proclaim himself openly the foe of the man he dreaded and\nhated. Cranmer, with his tolerant spirit, he despised. Here was an\narchbishop who might rack and burn for discipline's sake, and he did\nnothing.... And all these New Learning men with their powers of\nlanguage, these dark bearded men with twinkling and sagacious eyes, he\ndetested. He went clean shaved, lean and yellow-faced, with a hooked\nnose that seemed about to dig into his chin. It was he who said first:\n'It was merry in England before this New Learning came in.'\n\nThe night before, the King had sworn that he would have Privy Seal's\nhead because Anne of Cleves resembled a pig stuck with cloves. And,\nshaking and shivering with cold that penetrated his very inwards, with\na black pain on his brow and sparks dancing before his jaundiced eyes,\nthe Duke cursed himself for not having urged then the immediate arrest\nof the Privy Seal. For here stood Cromwell, arrogantly by the King's\nside with the King graciously commanding him to cover his head because\nit was very cold and Cromwell was known to suffer with the earache.\n\n'You are Earl Marshal,' the King's voice drowned Norfolk's morning\ngreeting. He veered upon the Duke with such violence that his enormous\nred bulk seemed about to totter over upon the tall and bent figure. A\nsearing pain had shot up his side, and, as he gripped it, he appeared\nto be furiously plucking at his dagger. He had imagined Chapuys and\nMarillac, the Ambassadors, coming upon guards with broken heads and\nsending to Paris letters over which Francis and his nephew should\nsnigger and chuckle.\n\n'You are Earl Marshal. You have the ordering of these ceremonies, and\nyou let rebels and knaves break heads within my very park for all the\nworld to see!'\n\nIn his rage Norfolk blurted out:\n\n'Privy Seal hath his friends, too--these Lutherans. What man could\nhave foreseen how insolent they be grown, for joy at welcoming a Queen\nof their faith,' he repeated hotly. 'No man could have foreseen. My\nbands are curtailed.'\n\nCromwell said:\n\n'Aye, men are needed to keep down the Papists of your North parts.'\n\nThe two men faced each other. It had been part of the Duke's plan--and\nCromwell knew it very well--that the City men should meet with the\nLutherans there in the King's own park. It would show the insolence of\nthe heretics upon whom the Privy Seal relied, and it might prove, too,\nthe strength of the Old Faith in the stronghold of the City.\n\nHenry rated violently. It put him to shame, he repeated many times.\n'Brawling beneath my face, cries in my ears, and the smell of\nbloodshed in my nose.'\n\nNorfolk repeated dully that the Protestants were wondrous insolent.\nBut Cromwell pointed out with a genial amusement: 'My Lord Duke should\nhave housed the City men within the palace. Cat will fight with dog\nthe world over if you set them together.'\n\nThe Duke answered malignantly:\n\n'It was fitting the citizens should wait to enter. I would not cumber\nhis Highness' courtyards. We know not yet that this Lady cometh to be\nwelcomed Queen.'\n\n'Body of God,' the King said with a new violence: 'do ye prate of\nthese matters?' His heavy jaws threatened like a dog's. 'Hast thou set\nlousy knaves debating of these?'\n\nNorfolk answered darkly that it had been treated of in the Council\nlast night.\n\n'My Council! My Council!' The King seemed to bay out the words. 'There\nshall some mothers' sons rue this!'\n\nNorfolk muttered that he had spoken of it with no man not a\nCouncillor. The King's Highness' self had moved first in this.\n\nHenry suddenly waved both hands at the sky.\n\n'Take you good order,' he said heavily into the lean and yellow face\nof the Duke. 'Marshal these ceremonies fitly from henceforth. Let\nnothing lack. Get you gone.' An end must be made of talk and gossip.\nThe rumour of last night's Council must appear an idle tale, a\nfalsehood of despairing Papists. 'The Queen cometh,' he said.\n\nWith the droop of the Duke's long arms his hat seemed to brush the\nstones, his head fell on his chest. It was finished.\n\nHe had seen so many things go that he loved. And now this old woman\nwith her Germans, her heresies--her children doubtless--meant the\nfinal downfall of the Old Order in his day. It would return, but he\nwould never see it. And under Cromwell's sardonic gaze his head hung\nlimply, and his eyes filled with hot and blinding drops. His face\ntrembled like that of a very old man.\n\nThe King had thrust his hand through Cromwell's arm, and, with a heavy\nfamiliarity as if he would make him forget the Council of last night,\nhe was drawing him away towards the water-gate. He turned his head\nover his shoulder and repeated balefully:\n\n'The Queen cometh.'\n\nAs he did so his eye fell upon a man tugging at the bridle of a mule\nthat had a woman on its back. He passed on with his minister.\n\n\nV\n\nIn turning, Norfolk came against them at the very end of the path. The\nman's green coat was spotted with filth, one of his sleeves was torn\noff and dangled about his heel. The mule's knees were cut, and the\nwoman trembled with her hidden face and shrinking figure.\n\nThey made him choke with rage and fear. Some other procession might\nhave come against these vagabonds, and the blame would have been his.\nIt disgusted him that they were within a yard of himself.\n\n'Are there no side paths?' he asked harshly.\n\nCulpepper blazed round upon him:\n\n'How might I know? Why sent you no guide?' His vivid red beard was\nmatted into tails, his face pallid and as if blazing with rage. The\nporter had turned them loose into the empty garden.\n\n'Kat is sore hurt,' he mumbled, half in tears. 'Her arm is welly\nbroken.' He glared at the Duke. 'Care you no more for your own blood\nand kin?'\n\nNorfolk asked:\n\n'Who is your Kat? Can I know all the Howards?'\n\nCulpepper snarled:\n\n'Aye, we may trust you not to succour your brother's children.'\n\nThe Duke said:\n\n'Why, she shall back to the palace. They shall comfort her.'\n\n'That shall she not,' Culpepper flustered. 'Sh'ath her father's\ncommands to hasten to Dover.'\n\nThe Duke caught her eyes in the fur hood that hid her face like a\nMoorish woman's veil. They were large, grey and arresting beneath the\npallor of her forehead. They looked at him, questioning and judging.\n\n'Wilt not come to my lodging?' he asked.\n\n'Aye, will I,' came a little muffled by the fur.\n\n'That shall she not,' Culpepper repeated.\n\nThe Duke looked at him with gloomy and inquisitive surprise.\n\n'Aye, I am her mother's cousin,' he said. 'I fend for her, which you\nhave never done. Her father's house is burnt by rioters, and her men\nare joined in the pillaging. But I'll warrant you knew it not.'\n\nKatharine Howard with her sound hand was trying to unfasten her hood,\nhastily and eagerly.\n\n'Wilt come?' the Duke asked hurriedly. 'This must be determined.'\n\nCulpepper hissed: 'By the bones of St. Nairn she shall not.' She\nlifted her maimed hand involuntarily, and, at the sear of pain, her\neyes closed. Immediately Culpepper was beside her knees, supporting\nher with his arms and muttering sounds of endearment and despair.\n\nThe Duke, hearing behind him the swish pad of heavy soft shoes, as if\na bear were coming over the pavement, faced the King.\n\n'This is my brother's child,' he said. 'She is sore hurt. I would not\nleave her like a dog,' and he asked the King's pardon.\n\n'Why, God forbid,' the King said. 'Your Grace shall succour her.'\nCulpepper had his back to them, caring nothing for either in his\npassion. Henry said: 'Aye, take good care for her,' and passed on with\nPrivy Seal on his arm.\n\nThe Duke heaved a sigh of relief. But he remembered again that Anne of\nCleves was coming, and his black anger that Cromwell should thus once\nagain have the King thrown back to him came out in his haughty and\nforbidding tone to Culpepper:\n\n'Take thou my niece to the water-gate. I shall send women to her.' He\nhastened frostily up the path to be gone before Henry should return\nagain.\n\nCulpepper resolved that he would take barge before ever the Duke\ncould send. But the mule slewed right across the terrace; his cousin\ngrasped the brute's neck and her loosened hood began to fall back from\nher head.\n\nThe King, standing twenty yards away, with his hand shaking Cromwell's\nshoulder, was saying:\n\n'See you how grey I grow.'\n\nThe words came hot into a long harangue. He had been urging that he\nmust have more money for his works at Calais. He was agitated because\na French chalk pit outside the English lines had been closed to his\nworkmen. They must bring chalk from Dover at a heavy cost for barges\nand balingers. This was what it was to quarrel with France.\n\nCromwell had his mind upon widening the breach with France. He said\nthat a poll tax might be levied on the subjects of Charles and Francis\nthen in London. There were goldsmiths, woolstaplers, horse merchants,\nwhore-masters, painters, musicians and vintners....\n\nThe King's eyes had wandered to the grey river, and then from a deep\nand moody abstraction he had blurted out those words.\n\nHenry was very grey, and his face, inanimate and depressed, made him\nseem worn and old enough. Cromwell was not set to deny it. The King\nhad his glass....\n\nHe sighed a little and began:\n\n'The heavy years take their toll.'\n\nHenry caught him up suddenly:\n\n'Why, no. It is the heavy days, the endless nights. You can sleep,\nyou.' But him, the King, incessant work was killing.\n\n'You see, you see, how this world will never let me rest.' In the\nlong, black nights he started from dozing. When he took time to dandle\nhis little son a panic would come over him because he remembered that\nhe lived among traitors and had no God he could pray to. He had no\nmind to work....\n\nCromwell said that there was no man in England could outwork his\nKing.\n\n'There is no man in England can love him.' His distracted eyes fell\nupon the woman on the mule. 'Happy he whom a King never saw and who\nnever saw King,' he muttered.\n\nThe beast, inspired with a blind hatred of Culpepper, was jibbing\nacross the terrace, close at hand. Henry became abstractedly\ninterested in the struggle. The woman swayed forward over her knees.\n\n'Your lady faints,' he called to Culpepper.\n\nIn his muddled fury the man began once again trying to hold her on the\nanimal. It was backing slowly towards a stone seat in the balustrade,\nand man and woman swayed and tottered together.\n\nThe King said:\n\n'Let her descend and rest upon the seat.'\n\nHis mind was swinging back already to his own heavy sorrows. On the\nstone seat the woman's head lay back upon the balustrade, her eyes\nwere closed and her face livid to the sky. Culpepper, using his teeth\nto the finger ends, tore the gloves from his hands.\n\nHenry drew Cromwell towards the gatehouse. He had it dimly in his mind\nto send one of his gentlemen to the assistance of that man and woman.\n\n'Aye, teach me to sleep at night,' he said. 'It is you who make me\nwork.'\n\n'It is for your Highness' dear sake.'\n\n'Aye, for my sake,' the King said angrily. He burst into a sudden\ninvective: 'Thou hast murdered a many men ... for my sake. Thou hast\nfound out plots that were no plots: old men hate me, old mothers,\nwives, maidens, harlots.... Why, if I be damned at the end thou shalt\nescape, for what thou didst thou didst for my sake? Shall it be that?'\nHe breathed heavily. 'My sins are thy glory.'\n\nThey reached the long wall of the gatehouse and turned mechanically. A\nbarge at the river steps was disgorging musicians with lutes like half\nmelons set on staves, horns that opened bell mouths to the sky, and\ncymbals that clanged in the rushing of the river. With his eyes upon\nthem Henry said: 'A common man may commonly choose his bedfellow.'\nThey had reminded him of the Queen for whose welcome they had been\ncommanded.\n\nCromwell swept his hand composedly round the half horizon that held\nthe palace, the grey river and the inlands.\n\n'Your Highness may choose among ten thousand,' he answered.\n\nThe sound of a horn blown faintly to test it within the gatehouse, the\ntinkle of a lutestring, brought to the King's lips: 'Aye. Bring me\nmusic that shall charm my thoughts. You cannot do it.'\n\n'A Queen is in the nature of a defence, a pledge, a cement, the\nkeystone of a bulwark,' Cromwell said. 'We know now our friends and\nour foes. You may rest from this onwards.'\n\nHe spoke earnestly: This was the end of a long struggle. The King\nshould have his rest.\n\nThey moved back along the terrace. The woman's head still lay back,\nher chin showed pointed and her neck, long, thin and supple. Culpepper\nwas bending over her, sprinkling water out of his cap upon her\nupturned face.\n\nThe King said to Cromwell: 'Who is that wench?' and, in the same tone:\n'Aye, you are a great comforter. We shall see how the cat jumps,' and\nthen, answering his own question, 'Norfolk's niece?'\n\nHis body automatically grew upright, the limp disappeared from his\ngait and he moved sturdily and gently towards them.\n\nCulpepper faced round like a wild cat from a piece of meat, but seeing\nthe great hulk, the intent and friendly eyes, the gold collar over the\nchest, the heavy hands, and the great feet that appeared to hold down\nthe very stones of the terrace, he stood rigid in a pose of\ndisturbance.\n\n'Why do ye travel?' the King asked. 'This shall be Katharine Howard?'\n\nCulpepper's hushed but harsh voice answered that they came out of\nLincolnshire on the Norfolk border. This was the Lord Edmund's\ndaughter.\n\n'I have never seen her,' the King said.\n\n'Sh'ath never been in this town.'\n\nThe King laughed: 'Why, poor wench!'\n\n'Sh'ath been well schooled,' Culpepper answered proudly, 'hath had\nmastern, hath sung, hath danced, hath your Latin and your Greek....\nHath ten daughters, her father.'\n\nThe King laughed again: 'Why, poor man!'\n\n'Poorer than ever now,' Culpepper muttered. Katharine Howard stirred\nuneasily and his face shot round to her. 'Rioters have brent his only\nhouse and wasted all his sheep.'\n\nThe King frowned heavily: 'Anan? Who rioted?'\n\n'These knaves that love not our giving our ploughlands to sheep,'\nCulpepper said. 'They say they starved through it. Yet 'tis the only\nway to wealth. I had all my wealth by it. By now 'tis well gone, but I\ngo to the wars to get me more.'\n\n'Rioters?' the King said again, heavily.\n\n''Twas a small tulzie--a score of starved yeomen here and there. I\nkilled seven. The others were they that were hanged at Norwich.... But\nthe barns were brent, the sheep gone, and the house down and the\nservants fled. I am her cousin of the mother's side. Of as good a\nstrain as Howards be.'\n\nHenry, with his eyes still upon them, beckoned behind his back for\nCromwell to come. A score or so of poor yeomen, hinds and women, cast\nout of their tenancies that wool might be grown for the Netherlands\nweavers, starving, desperate, and seeing no trace of might and order\nin their hidden lands, had banded, broken a few hedges and burnt a few\nbarns before the posse of the country could come together and take\nthem.\n\nThe King had not heard of it or had forgotten it, because such risings\nwere so frequent. His brows came down into portentous and bulging\nknots, his eyes were veiled and threatening towards the woman's face.\nHe had conceived that a great rebellion had been hidden from his\nknowledge.\n\nShe raised her head and shrieked at the sight of him, half started to\nher feet, and once more sank down on the bench, clasping at her\ncousin's hand. He said:\n\n'Peace, Kate, it is the King.'\n\nShe answered: 'No, no,' and covered her face with her hands.\n\nHenry bent a little towards her, indulgent, amused, and gentle as if\nto a child.\n\n'I am Harry,' he said.\n\nShe muttered:\n\n'There was a great crowd, a great cry. One smote me on the arm. And\nthen this quiet here.'\n\nShe uncovered her face and sat looking at the ground. Her furs were\nall grey, she had had none new for four years, and they were tight to\nher young body that had grown into them. The roses embroidered on her\nglove had come unstitched, and, against the steely grey of the river,\nher face in its whiteness had the tint of mother of pearl and an\nexpression of engrossed and grievous absence.\n\n'I have fared on foul ways this journey,' she said.\n\n'Thy father's barns we will build again,' the King answered. 'You\nshall have twice the sheep to your dower. Show me your eyes.'\n\n'I had not thought to have seen the King so stern,' she answered.\n\nCulpepper caught at the mule's bridle.\n\n'Y' are mad,' he muttered. 'Let us begone.'\n\n'Nay, in my day,' the King answered, 'y'ad found me more than kind.'\n\nShe raised her eyes to his face, steadfast, enquiring and unconcerned.\nHe bent his great bulk downwards and kissed her upon the temple.\n\n'Be welcome to this place.' He smiled with a pleasure in his own\naffability and because, since his beard had pricked her, she rubbed\nher cheek. Culpepper said:\n\n'Come away. We stay the King's Highness.'\n\nHenry said: 'Bide ye here.' He wished to hear what Cromwell might say\nof these Howards, and he took him down the terrace.\n\nCulpepper bent over her with his mouth opened to whisper.\n\n'I am weary,' she said. 'Set me a saddle cushion behind my shoulders.'\n\nHe whispered hurriedly:\n\n'I do not like this place.'\n\n'I like it well. Shall we not see brave shews?'\n\n'The mule did stumble on the threshold.'\n\n'I marked it not. The King did bid us bide here.'\n\nShe had once more laid her head back on the stone balustrade.\n\n'If thou lovest me....' he whispered. It enraged and confused him to\nhave to speak low. He could not think of any words.\n\nShe answered unconcernedly:\n\n'If thou lovest my bones ... they ache and they ache.'\n\n'I have sold farms to buy thee gowns,' he said desperately.\n\n'I never asked it,' she answered coldly.\n\nHenry was saying:\n\n'Ah, Princes take as is brought them by others. Poor men be commonly\nat their own choice.' His voice had a sort of patient regret. 'Why\nbrought ye not such a wench?'\n\nCromwell answered that in Lincoln, they said, she had been a coin that\nwould not bear ringing.\n\n'You do not love her house,' the King said. 'Y' had better have\nbrought me such a one.'\n\nCromwell answered that his meaning was she had been won by others. The\nKing's Highness should have her for a wink.\n\nHenry raised his shoulders with a haughty and angry shrug. Such a\nquarry was below his stooping. He craved no light loves.\n\n'I do not miscall the wench,' Cromwell answered. She was as her kind.\nThe King's Highness should find them all of a make in England.\n\n'Y' are foul-mouthed,' Henry said negligently. ''Tis a well-spoken\nwench. You shall find her a place in the Lady Mary's house.'\n\nCromwell smiled, and made a note upon a piece of paper that he pulled\nfrom his pocket.\n\nCulpepper, his arms jerking angularly, was creaking out:\n\n'Come away, a' God's name. By all our pacts. By all our secret vows.'\n\n'Ay thou didst vow and didst vow,' she said with a bitter weariness.\n'What hast to shew? I have slept in filthy beds all this journey.\nSpeak the King well. He shall make thee at a word.'\n\nHe spat out at her.\n\n'Is thine eye cocked up to that level?... I am very hot, very\ncholeric. Thou hast seen me. Thou shalt not live. I will slay thee. I\nshall do such things as make the moon turn bloody red.'\n\n'Aye art thou there?' she answered coldly. 'Ye have me no longer upon\nlone heaths and moors. Mend thy tongue. Here I have good friends.'\n\nSuddenly he began to entreat:\n\n'Thy mule did stumble--an evil omen. Come away, come away. I know well\nthou lovest me.'\n\n'I know well I love thee too well,' she answered, as if in scorn of\nherself.\n\n'Come away to thy father.'\n\n'Why what a bother is this,' she said. 'Thou wouldst to the wars to\nget thee gold? Thou wouldst trail a pike? Thou canst do little without\nthe ear of some captain. Here is the great captain of them all.'\n\n'I dare not speak here,' he muttered huskily. 'But this King....' He\npaused and added swiftly: 'He is of an ill omen to all Katharines.'\n\n'Why, he shall give me his old gloves to darn,' she laughed. 'Fond\nknave, this King standeth on a mountain a league high. A King shall\ntake notice of one for the duration of a raindrop's fall. Then it is\ndone. One may make oneself ere it reach the ground, or never. Besides,\n'tis a well-spoken elder. 'Tis the spit of our grandfather Culpepper.'\n\nWhen Henry came hurrying back, engrossed, to send Culpepper and the\nmule to the gatehouse for a guide, she laughed gently for pleasure.\n\nCulpepper said tremulously: 'She hath her father's commands to hasten\nto Dover.'\n\n'Her father taketh and giveth commands from me,' Henry answered, and\nhis glove flicked once more towards the gate. He had turned his face\naway before Culpepper's hand grasped convulsively at his dagger and he\nhad Katharine Howard at his side sweeping back towards Cromwell.\n\nShe asked, confidingly and curiously: 'Who is that lord?' and, after\nhis answer, she mused, 'He is no friend to Howards.'\n\n'Nay, that man taketh his friends among mine,' he answered. He stopped\nto regard her, his face one heavy and indulgent smile. The garter on\nhis knee, broad and golden, showed her the words: '_Y pense_'; the\ncollars moved up and down on his immense chest, the needlework of\nroses was so fine that she wondered how many women had sat up how many\nnights to finish it: but the man was grey and homely.\n\n'I know none of your ways here,' she said.\n\n'Never let fear blanch thy cheeks till we are no more thy friend,' he\nreassured her. He composed one of his gallant speeches:\n\n'Here lives for thee nothing but joy.' Pleasurable hopes should be her\ncomrades while the jolly sun shone, and sweet content at night her\nbedfellow....\n\nHe handed her to the care of the Lord Cromwell to take her to the Lady\nMary's lodgings. It was unfitting that she should walk with him, and,\nwith his heavy and bearlike gait, swinging his immense shoulders, he\npreceded them up the broad path.\n\n\nVI\n\nCromwell watched the King's great back with an attentive smile. He\nsaid, ironically, that he was her ladyship's servant.\n\n'I would ye were,' she answered. 'They say you love not those that I\nlove.'\n\n'I would have you not heed what men say,' he answered, grimly. 'I am\ndouce to those that be of good-will to his Highness. Those that hate\nme are his ill-wishers.'\n\n'Then the times are evil,' she said, 'for they are many.'\n\nShe added suddenly, as if she could not keep a prudent silence:\n\n'I am for the Old Faith in the Old Way. You have hanged many dear\nfriends of mine whose souls I pray for.'\n\nHe looked at her attentively.\n\nShe had a supple, long body, a fair-tinted face, fair and reddish\nhair, and eyes that had a glint of almond green--but her cheeks were\nflushed and her eyes sparkled. She was so intent upon speaking her\nmind that she had forgotten the pain of her arm. She thought that she\nmust have said enough to anger this brewer's son. But he answered\nonly:\n\n'I think you have never been in the King's court'--and, from his\ntranquil manner, she realised very suddenly that this man was not the\ndirt beneath her feet.\n\nShe had never been in the King's court; she had never, indeed, been\nout of the North parts. Her father had always been a very poor man,\nwith an ancient castle and a small estate that he had nearly always\nneglected because it had not paid for the farming. Living men she had\nnever respected--for they seemed to her like wild beasts when she\ncompared them with such of the ancients as Brutus or as Seneca. She\nhad been made love to and threatened by such men as her cousin; she\nhad been made love to and taught Latin by her pedagogues. She was more\nlearned than any man she had ever met--and, thinking upon the heroes\nof Plutarch, she found the present times despicable. She hardly owed\nallegiance to the King. Now she had seen him and felt his\nconsciousness of his own power, she was less certain. But the King's\nwrits had hardly run in the Northern parts. Her men-folk and her\nmother's people had hanged their own peasants when they thought fit.\nShe had seen bodies swinging from tree-tops when she rode hawking. All\nthat she had ever known of the King's power was when the convent by\ntheir castle gates had been thrown out of doors, and then her\nmen-folk, cursing and raging, had sworn that it was the work of\nCrummock. 'Knaves ruled about the King.'\n\nIf knaves ruled about him, the King was not a man that one need\ntrouble much over. Her own men-folk, she knew, had made and unmade\nKings. So that, when she thought of the hosts of saints and of the\nblessed angels that hovered, wringing their hands and weeping above\nEngland, she had wondered a little at times why they had never unmade\nthis King.\n\nBut to her all these things had seemed very far away. She had nothing\nto do but to read books in the learned tongues, to imagine herself\nholding disquisitions upon the spiritual republic of Plato, to ride,\nto shoot with the bow, to do needlework, or to chide the maids. Her\ncousin had loved her passionately; it was true that once, when she had\nhad nothing to her back, he had sold a farm to buy her a gown. But he\nhad menaced her with his knife till she was weary, and the ways of men\nwere troublesome to her; nevertheless she submitted to them with a\npatient wisdom.\n\nShe submitted to the King; she submitted--though she hated him by\nrepute--to Cromwell's catechism as they followed the King at a decent\ninterval.\n\nHe walked beside her with his eyes on her face. He spoke of the King's\nbounty in a voice that implied his own power. She was to be the Lady\nMary's woman. He had that lady especially in his good will, he saved\nfor her household ladies of egregious gifts, presence and attainments.\nThey received liberal honorariums, seven dresses by the year, vails,\npresents, perfumes from the King's own still-rooms, and a parcel-gilt\nchain at the New Year. The Lady Rochford, who ruled over these ladies,\nwas kind, courteous, free in her graces as in the liberties she\nallowed the ladies under her easy charge.\n\nHe enlarged upon this picture as if it were a bribe that he alone\ncould offer or withhold. And something at once cautious and priestly\nin his tone let her quick intuition know that he was both warning her\nand sounding her, to see how far her mutinous spirit would carry her.\nOnce he said, 'There must be tranquillity in the kingdom. The times\nare very evil!'\n\nShe had felt very quickly that insults to this man would be a useless\nfolly. He could not even feel them, and she kept her eyes on the\nground and listened to him.\n\nHe went on sounding her. It was part of his profession of kingcraft to\nknow the secret hearts of every person with whom he spoke.\n\n'And your goodly cousin?' He paused. The King had commanded that a\nplace should be found for him. 'Should he be best at Calais? There\nshall be blows struck there.'\n\nShe knew very well that he was trying to discover how much she loved\nher cousin, and she answered in a low voice, 'I would have him stay\nhere. He is the sole friend I have in this place.'\n\nCromwell said, with a hidden and encouraging meaning, her cousin was\nnot her only friend there.\n\n'Aye, but your lordship is not so old a friend as he.'\n\n'Not me. Call me your good servant.'\n\n'There is even then my uncle.'\n\n'Little good of a friend you will have of Norfolk. 'Tis a bitter apple\nand a very rotten plank to lean upon.'\n\nShe could not any longer miss his meaning. The King's scarlet and\nimmense figure was already in the grey shadow of the arch under the\ntower. In walking, they had come near him, and while they waited he\nstood for a minute, gazing back down the path with boding and pathetic\neyes; then he disappeared.\n\nShe looked at Cromwell and thanked him for the warning, '_quia spicula\npraevisa minus laedunt_.'\n\n'I would have you read it: _gaudia plus laetificant_,' he answered\ngravely.\n\nA man with a conch-shaped horn upturned was suddenly blowing beneath\nthe archway seven hollow and reverberating grunts of sound that\ndrowned his voice. A clear answering whistle came from the water-gate.\nCromwell stayed, listening attentively; another stood forward to blow\nfour blasts, another six, another three. Each time the whistle\nanswered. They were the great officers' signals for their barges that\nthe men blew, and the whistle signified that these lay at readiness in\nthe tideway. A bustle of men running, calling, and making pennons\nready, began beyond the archway in the quadrangle.\n\nCromwell's face grew calm and contented; the King was sending to meet\nAnne of Cleves.\n\n'Y' are well read?' he asked her slowly.\n\n'I was brought up in the Latin tongue or ever I had the English,' she\nanswered. 'I had a good master, one that spoke the learned language\nalways.'\n\n'Aye, Nicholas Udal,' Cromwell said.\n\n'You know all men in the land,' she said, with fear and surprise.\n\n'I had him to master for the Lady Mary, since he is well disposed.'\n\n''Tis an arrant knave tho' the best of pedagogues,' she answered. 'He\nwas cast out of his mastership at Eton for being a rogue.'\n\n'For that, the worshipful your father had him to master,' he said\nironically.\n\n'No, for that he was a ruined man, and taught for his victuals. We\nwelly starved at home, my sisters and I.'\n\nHe said slowly:\n\n'The better need that you should grow beloved here.'\n\nStanding there, before the bushes where no ears could overhear, he put\nto her more questions. She had some Greek, more than a little French,\nshe could judge a good song, she could turn a verse in Latin or the\nvulgar tongue. She professed to be able to ride well, to be conversant\nwith the terms of venery, to shoot with the bow, and to have studied\nthe Fathers of the Church.\n\n'These things are well liked in high places,' he said. 'His Highness'\nself speaks five tongues, loveth a nimble answer, and is a noble\nhuntsman.' He surveyed her as if she were a horse he were pricing.\n'But I doubt not you have appraised yourself passing well,' he\nuttered.\n\n'I have had some to make me pleasant speeches,' she answered, 'but too\nmany cannot be had.'\n\n'See you,' he said slowly, 'these tuckets that they blow from the gate\nsignify that the new Queen cometh with a great state.' He bit his\nunder lip and looked at her meaningly. 'But a great state ensueth a\ngreat heaviness to the head of the State. _Principis hymen, principium\ngravitatis_.... 'Tis a small matter to me; you may make it a great one\nto your ladyship's light fortunes.'\n\nShe knew that he awaited her saying:\n\n'I do not take your lordship,' and she pulled the hood further over\nher face because it was cold, and uttered the words with her eyes on\nthe ground.\n\n'Why,' he said readily, 'you are a lady having gifts that are much in\nfavour in these days. Be careful to use those gifts and no others.\nMeddle in nothing that does not concern you. So you may make a great\nmarriage with some lord in favour. But meddle in naught else!'\n\nShe would find many to set her an evil example. The other ladies\namongst whom she was going were a mutinous knot. Let her be careful!\nIf by her good behaviour she earned it, he would put the King in mind\nto advance her. If by good speeches and good example--since she had\ngreat store of learning--she could turn the hearts of these wicked\nladies; if she could report to him evil designs or plots, he would\nspeak to the King in such wise that His Highness should give her a\ngreat dower and any lord would marry her. Or he would advance her\ncousin so that he should become marriageable.\n\nShe said submissively:\n\n'Your lordship would have me become a spy upon the ladies who shall be\nmy fellows?'\n\nHe waved his hand with a large and calming gesture.\n\n'I would have you work for the good of the State as you find it,' he\nsaid gravely. 'That, too, is a doctrine of the Ancients.' He cited the\ncase of Seneca, who supported the government of Nero, and she noted\nthat he twisted to suit his purpose Tacitus' account of the soldiers\nof that same Prince.\n\nNevertheless, she made no comment. For she knew that it is the nature\nof men calmly to ask hateful sacrifices of women. But her throat ached\nwith rage. And when she followed him along the corridors of the palace\nshe seemed to feel that each man, each woman that they passed hated\nthat lord with a hatred born of fear.\n\nHe walked in front of her arrogantly, as if she were a straw to be\ndrawn along in the wind of his progress. Doors flew open at a flick of\nhis finger.\n\nSuddenly they were in a tall room, long, and dim because it faced the\nnorth. It seemed an empty cavern, but there were in it many books upon\na long table and at the far end, so that they looked quite small, two\nfigures stood before a reading-pulpit. The voice of the serving man\nwho had thrown open the door made the words 'The Lord Privy Seal of\nEngland' echo mournfully along the gilded and dim rafters of the\nceiling.\n\nCromwell hastened over the smooth, cold floor. The woman's figure in\nblack, the long tail of her hood falling almost to her feet like a\nwidow's veil, turned from the pulpit; a man remained bent down at his\nreading.\n\n'_Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum_,' Cromwell's voice uttered. The lady\nstood, rigid and straight, her hands clasped before her. Her face,\npale so that not even a touch of red showed above the cheekbones and\nhardly any in the tightly-pursed lips, was as if framed in her black\nhood that fastened beneath the chin. The high, narrow forehead had the\nhair tightly drawn back so that none was visible, and the coif that\nshowed beneath the hood was white, like a nun's; the temples were\nhollowed so that she looked careworn inexpressibly, and her lips had\nhard lines around them. Above her head all sounds in that dim room\nseemed to whisper for a long time among the rafters as if here dwelt\nsomething mysterious, sepulchral, a great grief or a great passion.\n\n'I announce to you a master-joy,' Cromwell was saying. 'I bring your\nLa'ship a damsel of great erudition and knowledge of good letters.'\n\nHis voice was playful and full; his back was bent supply. His face lit\nup with a debonnaire and pleasant smile. The lady's eyes turned upon\nthe girl, forbidding and suspicious; she remained motionless, even her\nlips did not move. Cromwell said that this was a Katharine of the\nHowards, and one fit to aid her Ladyship and Magister Udal with their\nerudite commentary of Plautus his works.\n\nThe man at the reading desk looked round and then back at his book.\nHis pen scratched upon the margin of a great volume. Katharine Howard\nwas upon her knees grasping at the lady's hand to kiss it. But it was\nsnatched roughly away.\n\n'This is a folly,' the voice came harshly from the pursed lips. 'Get\nup, wench.' Katharine remained kneeling. For this was the Lady Mary of\nEngland--a martyr for whom she had prayed nightly since she could\npray.\n\n'Get up, fool,' the voice said above her head. 'It is proclaimed\ntreason to kneel to me. This is to risk your neck to act thus before\nPrivy Seal.'\n\nThe hard words were aimed straight at the face of Cromwell.\n\n'Your ladyship knows well I would fain have it otherwise,' he answered\nsoftly.\n\n'I do not ask it,' she answered.\n\nHe maintained a gentle smile of deprecation, beckoning a little with\nhis head and with his eyes, begging her for private conversation. She\nlifted Katharine roughly to her feet and followed him to a distant\nwindow. She seemed as if she were an automaton without will or\nindependent motions of her own, so small were her steps and her feet\nso hidden beneath her stiff black skirts. He began talking to her in a\nvoice of which only the persuasive higher notes came into the room.\n\nAt that time she was still proclaimed bastard, and her name was erased\nfrom the list of those it was lawful to pray for in the churches. At\ntimes she endured great hardships, even to going short of food, for\nshe suffered from a wasting complaint that made her a great eater. But\nstarvation could not make her submit to the King, her father, or to\nthe Lord Cromwell who was ruler in the land. Sometimes they gave her a\ngreat train, strove to make her dress herself richly, and dragged her\nto such festivals as this of the marriage with Anne of Cleves. This\nwas done when the Lord Privy Seal dangled her before the eyes of the\nEmperor of France as a match; then it was necessary to increase the\nappearance of her worth in England. But sometimes the King, out of a\nwarm and generous feeling of satisfaction with his young son, was\nmoved to behave bountifully to his daughter, and, seeking to dazzle\nher with his munificence, gave her golden crosses and learned books\nannotated with his own hand, richly jewelled and with embroidered\ncovers. Or when the Emperor, her cousin, interceded that she should be\ntreated more kindly, she was threatened with the block. Of late\nCromwell had set himself to gain her heart with his intrigue that he\ncould make so smooth and with his air that could be so gentle--that\nthe King found so lovable. But nothing moved her to set her hand to a\ndeed countenancing her dead mother's disgrace; to smile upon her\nfather and his minister, who had devised the means for casting down\nher mother; or to consent to relinquish her right to the throne. So\nthat at times, when the cloud of the Church abroad, and of the\nrebellions all over the extremities of the kingdoms, threatened very\ngreatly, the King was driven to agonies of fear and rage lest his\nenemies or his subjects should displace him who was excommunicated and\nset her, whom all Catholics regarded as undergoing a martyrdom, on\nhis throne. He feared her sometimes so much that it was only Cromwell\nthat saved her from death. Cromwell would spend hours of his busy days\nin the long window of her work room, urging her to submission,\ndilating upon the powers that might be hers, studying her tastes to\ndevise bribes for her. It was with that aim, because her whole days in\nher solitude were given to the learned writers, that he had sought out\nfor her Magister Udal as a companion and preceptor who might both\nplease her with his erudition and induce her to look kindly upon the\nNew Learning and a more lax habit of mind. But she never thanked\nCromwell. Whilst he talked she remained frozen and silent. At times,\nunder the spur of a cold rage, she said harsh things of himself and\nher father, calling upon the memory of her mother and the wrongs her\nChurch had suffered--and, on his departing, before he had even left\nthe room she would return, frigidly and without change of face, to the\nbook upon her desk.\n\nSo the Privy Seal talked to her by the window for the fiftieth time.\nKatharine Howard saw, before the high reading pulpit, the back of a\nman in the long robes of a Master of Arts. He held a pen in his hand\nand turned over his shoulder at her a face thin, brown, humorous and\ndeprecatory, as if he were used to bearing chiding with philosophy.\n\n'Magister Udal!' she uttered.\n\nHe motioned with his mouth for her to be silent, but pointed with the\nfeather of his quill to a line of a little book that lay upon the\npulpit near his elbow. She came closer to read:\n\n'_Circumspectatrix cum oculis emisitiis!_' and written above it in a\nminute hand: 'A spie with eyes that peer about and stick out.'\n\nHe pointed over his shoulder at the Lord Privy Seal.\n\n'How poor this room is, for a King's daughter!' she said, without much\ndropping her voice.\n\nHe hissed: 'Hush! hush!' with an appearance of terror, and whispered,\nforming the words with his lips rather than uttering them: 'How fared\nyou and your house in the nonce?'\n\n'I have read in many texts,' she answered, 'to pass the heavy hours.'\n\nHe spoke then, aloud and with an admonitory air:\n\n'Never say the heavy hours--for what hours are heavy that can be spent\nwith the ancient writers for companions?'\n\nShe avoided his reproachful eyes with:\n\n'My father's house was burnt last month; my cousin Culpepper is in the\ncourts below. Dear Nick Ardham, with his lute, is dead an outlaw\nbeyond sea, and Sir Ferris was hanged at Doncaster--both after last\nyear's rising, pray all good men that God assail them!'\n\nUdal muttered:\n\n'Hush, for God's dear sake. That is treason here. There is a listener\nbehind the hangings.'\n\nHe began to scrawl hastily with a dry pen that he had not time to dip\nin the well of ink. The shadow of the Lord Cromwell's silent return\nwas cast upon them both, and Katharine shivered.\n\nHe said harshly to the magister:\n\n'I will that you write me an interlude in the vulgar tongue in three\ndays' time. Such a piece as being spoken by skilful players may make a\nsad man laugh.'\n\nUdal said: 'Well-a-day!'\n\n'It shall get you advancement. I am minded the piece shall be given at\nmy house before his Highness and the new Queen in a week.'\n\nUdal remained silent, dejected, his head resting upon his breast.\n\n'For,' Cromwell spoke with a raised voice, 'it is well that the King\nbe distracted of his griefs.' He went on as if he were uttering an\nadmonition that he meant should be heeded and repeated. The times were\nvery evil with risings, mutinies in close fortresses, schism, and the\nbad hearts of men. Here, therefore, he would that the King should find\ndistraction. Such of them as had gifts should display those talents\nfor his beguiling; such of them as had beauty should make valuable\nthat beauty; others whose wealth could provide them with rich garments\nand pleasant displays should work, each man and each woman, after his\nsort or hers. 'And I will that you report my words where either of you\nhave resort. Who loves me shall hear it; who fears me shall take\nwarning.'\n\nHe surveyed both Katharine and the master with a heavy and encouraging\nglance, having the air of offering great things if they aided him and\navoided dealing with his enemies.\n\nThe Lady Mary was gliding towards them like a cold shadow casting\nitself upon his warm words; she would have ignored him altogether,\nknowing that contempt is harder to bear than bitter speeches. But the\nfascination of hatred made it hard to keep aloof from her father's\ninstrument. He looked negligently over his shoulder and was gone\nbefore she could speak. He did not care to hear more bitter words that\ncould make the breach between them only wider, since words once spoken\nare so hard to wash away, and the bringing of this bitter woman back\nto obedience to her father was so great a part of his religion of\nkingcraft. In that, when it came, there should be nothing but concord\nand oblivion of bitter speeches, silent loyalty, and a throne upheld,\nrevered, and unassailable.\n\nUdal groaned lamentably when the door closed upon him:\n\n'I shall write to make men laugh! In the vulgar tongue! I! To gain\nadvancement!'\n\nThe Lady Mary's face hardly relaxed:\n\n'Others of us take harder usage from my lord,' she said. She addressed\nKatharine: 'You are named after my mother. I wish you a better fate\nthan your namesake had.' Her harsh voice dismayed Katharine, who had\nbeen prepared to worship her. She had eaten nothing since dawn, she\nhad travelled very far and with this discouragement the pain in her\narm came back. She could find no words to say, and the Lady Mary\ncontinued bitterly: 'But if you love that dear name and would sojourn\nnear me I would have you hide it. For--though I care little--I would\nyet have women about me that believe my mother to have been foully\nmurdered.'\n\n'I cannot easily dissemble.' Katharine found her tongue. 'Where I hate\nI speak things disparaging.'\n\n'That I attest to of old,' Udal commented. 'But I shall be shamed\nbefore all learned doctors, if I write in the vulgar tongue.'\n\n'Silence is ever best for me!' the Lady Mary answered her deadly. 'I\nlive in the shadows that I love.'\n\n'That, full surely, shall be reversed,' Katharine said loyally.\n\n'I do not ask it,' Mary said.\n\n'Wherefore must I write in the vulgar tongue?' Udal asked again, 'Oh,\nMistress of my actions and my heart, what whim is this? The King is an\nexcellent good Latinist!'\n\n'Too good!' the Lady Mary said bitterly. 'With his learning he hath\noverset the Church of Christ.'\n\nShe spoke harshly to Katharine: 'What reversal should give my mother\nher life again? Wench! Wench!...' Then she turned upon Udal\nindifferently:\n\n'God knows why this man would have you write in the vulgar tongue. But\nso he wills it.'\n\nUdal groaned.\n\n'My dinner hour is here,' the Lady Mary said. 'I am very hungry. Get\nyou to your writing and take this lady to my women.'\n\n\nVII\n\nThe Lady Mary's rooms were seventeen in number; they ran the one into\nthe other, but they could each be reached by the public corridor\nalongside. It was Magister Udal's privilege, his condition being above\nthat of serving man, to make his way through the rooms if he knew that\nthe Lady Mary was not in one of them. These chambers were tall and\ngloomy; the light fell into them bluish and dismal; in one a pane was\nlacking in a window; in another a stool was upset before a fire that\nhad gone out.\n\nTo traverse this cold wilderness Udal had set on his cap. He stood in\nfront of Katharine Howard in the third room and asked:\n\n'You are ever of the same mind towards your magister?'\n\n'I was never of any mind towards you,' she answered. Her eyes went\nround the room to see how Princes were housed. The arras pictured the\nstory of the nymph Galatea; the windows bore intertwined in red glass\nthe cyphers H and K that stood for Katharine of Aragon. 'Your broken\nfortunes are mended?' she asked indifferently.\n\nHe pulled a small book out of his pocket, ferreted among the leaves\nand then setting his eye near the page pointed out his beloved line:\n\n'_Pauper sum, pateor, fateor, quod Di dant fero._' Which had been\ntranslated: 'I am poor, I confess; I bear it, and what the gods\nvouchsafe that I take'--and on the broad margin of the book had\nwritten: 'Cicero sayeth: That one cannot sufficiently praise them that\nbe patient having little: And Seneca: The first measure of riches is\nto have things necessary--and, as ensueth therefrom, to be therewith\ncontent!'\n\n'I will give you a text from Juvenal,' she said, 'to add to these: Who\nwrites that no man is poor unless he be worthy of ridicule.'\n\nHe winced a little.\n\n'Nay, you are hard! The text should be read: Nothing else maketh\npoverty so hard to bear as that it forceth men to ridiculous\nshifts.... _Quam quod ridiculos esse_....'\n\n'Aye, magister, you are more learned even yet than I,' she said\nindifferently. She made a step towards the next door but he stood in\nfront of her holding up his thin hands.\n\n'You were my best pupil,' he said, with a hungry humility as if he\nmocked himself. 'Poor I am, but mated to me you should live as do the\nHyperboreans, in a calm and voluptuous air.'\n\n'Aye, to hang myself of weariness, as they do,' she answered.\n\nHe corrected her with the version of Pliny, but she answered only: 'I\nhave a great thirst upon me.'\n\nHis eyes were humorous, despairing and excited.\n\n'Why should a lady not love her master?' he asked. 'There are\nexamples. Know you not the old rhyme:\n\n    '\"_It was a lording's daughter, the fairest one of three,_\n      _Why lov\u00c3\u00a9d of her master...._\"'\n\n'Ah, unspeakable!' she said. 'You bring me examples in the vulgar\ntongue!'\n\n'I babble for joy at seeing you and for grief at your harsh words,' he\nanswered.\n\nShe stood waiting with a sort of haughty submissiveness.\n\n'I would you would delay your wooing. I have been on the road since\ndawn with neither bit nor sup.'\n\nHe protested that he had starved more hideously than Tantalus since he\nhad seen her last.\n\nShe gave him indifferently her cheek to kiss.\n\n'For pity's sake take me where I may rest,' she said, 'I have a maimed\narm.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe uttered her panegyric, after a model of Tibullus, to the Lady\nRochford and the seven maids of honour under that lady's charge. He\nwas set upon Katharine's enjoyment, and he invented a lie that the\nKing had commanded a dress to be found for her to attend at the revels\nthat night. The maids were already dressing themselves. Two of them\nwere fairheaded, and four neither fair nor dark; but one was dark as\nnight, and dressed all in black with a white coif, so that she\nresembled a magpie. Some were curling each other's hair and others\ntightening stay-laces with little wheels set in their companions'\nbacks. Their bare shoulders were blue with the cold of the great\nroom, and their dresses lay in heaps upon sheets that were spread\nabout the clean floor--brocades sewn with pearls, velvets that were\ninlaid with filagree work, indoor furs and coifs of fine lawn that\nwere delicately edged with black thread.\n\nThe high sounds of their laughter had reached through the door, but a\ndead silence fell. The dark girl with a very long bust that raked back\nlike a pigeon's, and with dark and sparkling eyes, tittered derisively\nat the magister and went on slowly rubbing a perfumed ointment into\nthe skin of her throat and shoulders.\n\n'Shall he bring his ragged doxies here too?' she laughed. 'What a\ntaradiddle is this of Cophetua and a beggar wench.' The other maids\nall tittered derisively at Udal.\n\nThe Lady Rochford, warming her back close before the fire, said\nhelplessly, 'I have no dresses beyond what you see.' She was already\nattired in a bountiful wine-coloured velvet that was embroidered with\nsilver wire into entwined monograms of the initials of her name. Her\nhood of purple made, above her ample brows, a castellated pattern\nresembling the gate of a drawbridge. She, being the mistress of that\nhousehold, and compassionately loved by the ladies because she was so\nhelpless, timorous, and unable to control them, they had combined to\ncomb and perfume her and to lace her stomacher before setting about\ntheir own clothing. White-haired and with a wrinkled face, she\nappeared, under her rich clothes, like some will-less and pallid\ncaptive that had been gorgeously bedizened to grace a conqueror's\ntriumph. She was cousin to the late Queen Anne Boleyn, and the terror\nof her own escape, when the Queen and so many of her house had been\nswept away, seemed still to remain in the drawing-in of her eyes. In\nthe mien of the youngest girls there, there could be seen a strained\ntenseness of lids and lips as though, in the midst of laughter, they\nwere hearkening for distant sounds or the rustle of listeners behind\nthe tapestry. And where a small door came into one wall they had\npulled down the arras from in front of it, so that no one should enter\nunobserved. Lady Rochford addressed herself to Katharine with limp\ngestures of protest:\n\n'God knows I would help you to a gown, but we have no more than we are\ngranted; here are seven ladies and seven dresses. Where can another be\ngot? The King's Highness knoweth little of ladies' gowns or he had\nnever ordered one against to-night. Each of those hath taken the women\nseven weeks to sew.'\n\nUdal said with a touch of anger, since it enraged him to have to\ninvent further, as if the one lie about the King were not enough: 'The\nLord Privy Seal commanded very strictly this thing to be done. He is\nthis lady's very diligent protector. Have a care how you disoblige\nher.'\n\nThe ladies rustled their slight clothing at that name, turned their\nbacks, and looked at Katharine above their shoulders. The Lady\nRochford recoiled so far that her skirts were in danger from the fire\nin the great hearth; her woebegone, flaccid face was suddenly drawn at\nthe mention of Cromwell, and she appeared about to kneel at\nKatharine's feet. She looked round at the figures of the girls.\n\n'One of these can stay if your ladyship will wear her dress,' she\nflustered. 'But who is tall enow? Cicely is too long in the shank.\nBess's shoulders are too broad. Alack! God help me! I will do what I\ncan'--and she waved her hands disconsolately.\n\nCold, fatigue, and her maimed arm made Katharine waver on her feet.\nThis white-haired woman's panic seemed to her grotesque and\ndisgusting.\n\n'Why, the magister lies,' she said. 'I am no such friend of Privy\nSeal's.'\n\nSwift and wicked glances passed among the girls; the dark one threw\nback her head and laughed discordantly, like a magpie. She came with a\ndeft and hopping step and gazed at Katharine with her head on one\nside.\n\n'Old Crummock will want our teeth next to make him a new set. He may\nhave my head, tell him. I have no need for it, it aches so since he\nkilled my men-folk.'\n\nLady Rochford shuddered as if she had been struck.\n\n'Beseech you,' she said weakly to Katharine. 'Cicely Elliott is\nsometimes distraught. Believe not that we speak like this among\nourselves.' Her eyes wandered in a flustered and piteous way over her\ngirls and she whimpered, 'Jane Gaskell, stand back to back with this\nlady.'\n\nKatharine Howard cried out, 'Keep your gowns for your backs and your\ntongues still. Woe betide the girl who calls me a gossip of Privy\nSeal.'\n\nCicely Elliott cast her dark head back and uttered one of her\ndiscordant laughs at the ceiling, and a girl, hiding behind the\nothers, called out, 'What a fine ----!'\n\nKatharine cried, 'It is all lies that this fool magister utters. I\nwill go to no masques nor revels.' She turned upon Lady Rochford, her\nface pallid, her lips open: 'Give me water,' she said harshly. 'I will\nget me back to my pig-sties.'\n\nLady Rochford wrung her hands and protested that her ladyship should\nnot repeat that they were always thus. Privy Seal should not visit it\nupon them.\n\nThe magister blinked upon the riot that his muddling had raised. He\ncalled out, 'Be quiet. Be quiet. This lady is sick!' and stretched out\nhis hands to hold Katharine on her feet.\n\nCicely Elliott cried, 'God send all Crummock's informers always sick.'\n\n'Thou dastard!' Katharine screamed aloud. She tried to speak but she\nchoked; she grasped Udal's hand as if to wring from him the denial of\nhis foolish lies, but a sharp and numbing pain shot up her maimed\nwrist to her shoulders and leaped across her forehead.\n\n'Thou filthy spy,' the dark girl laughed wildly into her agonised\nface. 'If there had never been any like thee all the dear men of my\nhouse had still breathed.'\n\nKatharine sprang wildly towards her tormentor, but a black sheet\nseemed to drop across her eyes. She fell right down and screamed as\nher elbow struck the floor.\n\n\n\n\nPART TWO\n\nTHE HOUSE OF EYES\n\nI\n\n\nA grave and bearded man was found to cup her. He gave her a potion\ncomposed of the juice of nightshade and an infusion of churchyard\nmoss. Her eyes grew dilated and she had evil dreams. She lay in a\nsmall chamber that was quite bare and had a broken window, and the\nmagister ran from room to room begging for quilts to cover her.\n\nIt was nobody's affair. The Lord Privy Seal, her uncle, the Catholics,\nand the King were still perturbed about Anne of Cleves, and there were\nno warrants signed for Katharine's housing or food. All the palace was\ntrembling with confusion, for, when the Queen had been upon the point\nof setting out from Rochester, the King was said to have been overcome\nby a new spasm of disgust: she was put by again.\n\nThe young Earl of Surrey, a cousin of Katharine's, gave Udal\ncontemptuously a couple of crowns towards her nourishment. Udal\napplied them to bribing Throckmorton, the spy who had been with Privy\nSeal upon the barge, to inscribe on his lord's tablets the words:\n'Katharine Howard to be provided for.' Udal made up his courage\nsufficiently to speak to the Duke, whom he met in a corridor. The Duke\nwas jaundiced against his niece, because her cousin Culpepper had\nfallen upon Sir Christopher Aske, the Duke's captain who had kept the\npostern. It had needed seven men to master him, and this great tumult\nhad arisen in the King's own courtyard. Nevertheless, the Duke sent\nhis astrologer to cast Katharine's horoscope. He signed, too, an order\nthat some girl be found to attend on her.\n\nUdal filled in the girl's name as Margot Poins, the granddaughter of\nold Badge, of Austin Friars. Even among these clamours his tooth\nwatered for her, and he gave the order to young Poins to execute. The\nyoung man rode off into Bedfordshire, where his sister had been sent\nout of the way to the house of their aunt. He presented the order as\nin the nature of a writ from the Duke, and amongst Lutherans in London\na heavy growl of rage went up--against Norfolk, against the Papists of\nthe Privy Council, and, above all, against Katharine Howard, whom they\ncalled the New Harlot.\n\nKatharine, having taken much nightshade juice, was raving upon her\nbed. The leech became convinced that she was possessed by a demon,\nbecause the pupils of her eyes were as large as silver groats, and her\nhands picked at the coverlets. He ordered that thirteen priests should\nsay an exorcism at the door of her room, and that the potion of\nnightshade--since it might inconvenience without dislodging the fiend\ninhabiting her slender body--should be discontinued.\n\nUdal sought for priests, but having no money, he was disregarded by\nthem. He ran to the chaplain of the Bishop of Winchester. For the\nclergy upheld or ordained by Archbishop Cranmer were held to be less\nefficacious in matters of witchcraft and possession. Just then\nCromwell had triumphed, and Anne of Cleves was upon the water coming\nto the palace.\n\nBishop Gardiner's chaplain, a fat man, with beady and guileless eyes\nsunk in under an immense forehead, imagined that Udal's visit was a\npretext for overhearing the words of rage and discomfiture that in\nthat Papist centre might be let drop about the new Queen. For Udal,\nbecause Privy Seal had set him with the Lady Mary, passed amongst the\nPapists for one of Cromwell's informants, and it amused his sardonic\nand fantastic nature to affect mysterious denials, which made the\nfiction the more firmly believed and gave to Udal himself a certain\nhated prestige. The chaplain answered that in the present turmoil no\nsuch body as thirteen clergymen could be found.\n\n'But the lady shall be torn in pieces,' Udal shrieked. Panic had\novercome him. Who knew that the fiend, having torn his Katharine\nasunder, might not enter into the body of his Margot, who was already\nat her bedside? His lips quivered with terror, his eyes smiled\nfuriously, he wrung his hands. He swore he would penetrate to the\nKing's Highness' self. Udal was a man who stuck at nothing to gain a\npoint. He had heard from Katharine that the King had spoken graciously\nto her, and he swore once more that she was the apple of the King's\neye, as well as a beloved disciple of Privy Seal's.\n\n'Be sure,' he foamed, 'they shall be avenged on a Gardiner and his\ncrew if you let her die.'\n\nThe chaplain said impassively: 'God forbid that we, who are loyal to\nhis Highness, should listen to these tales you bring us of his\nlechery!' They had there a new Queen, their duty was to her, and to no\nKatharine Howard. The bishop's clergy were all joyfully setting to\nwelcome the lady from Cleves, they had no time to waste over a leman's\ndemons. It overjoyed him to refuse Privy Seal's man a boon on the plea\nof loyalty to the new Queen. Nevertheless, he went straight to the\npresence of the bishop, and told him the marvels that Udal had\nreported.\n\n'The man is incontinent and a babbler,' the chaplain said. 'We may\nbelieve one tenth.'\n\n'Well, you shall find for once how this wench is housed and where,'\nhis master answered moodily. 'God knows what we may believe in these\ndays. Doubtless the Nuntio of Satan hath a new plot in the hatching.'\nMaking these enquiries, the chaplain came upon the backwash of Udal's\nreports that the King loved some leman. Some lady, somewhere--some\nsaid a Howard, some a Rochford, some would have it a Spanish\nwoman--was being hidden up, either by the King, by the Duke of\nNorfolk, or by Privy Seal. God knew the truth of these things: but\nsimilar had happened before; and it was certain that the Cleves woman\nhad been for long kept dangling at Rochester. Perhaps that was the\nreason. His Highness had his own ways in these matters: but where\nthere was smoke, generally fire was to be found. The chaplain brought\nthis budget back to Bishop Gardiner. Gardiner swore a wild oath that,\nby the bones of the Confessor, they had unmasked a new plot of Satan's\nLegate, the Privy Seal. But, by the grace of God, he would\ncounter-plot him.\n\nUdal, who had started all these rumours, had run to get the help of a\nDean of Durham, with whom formerly he had had much converse as to the\nposition of the Islands of the Blest. He never found him; the palace\nwas in confusion, with the doors all open and men running from room to\nroom to ask of each other how far it might be safe to be extravagant\nin their demonstrations of joy at the coming of the new Queen.\n\nAll night long, from about dusk, the palace rang with salvos of\nartillery, loud shouts and the blowing of horns: the windows glowed\nduskily now and again with the light of bonfires that leapt up and\nsubsided. Margot Poins, who was used to rejoicings in the City, set\nthe heavy wooden bar across the door in Katharine Howard's room,\nturned the immense key in the rusty lock, and opened to no knocking\nuntil the day broke. There were shouts and stumblings in the corridor\noutside and the magister himself, very intoxicated and shrieking, came\nhammering at the door with several others towards one in the morning.\n\nKatharine could walk by noon to the lodging that had at last been\nassigned to her by Privy Seal's warrant. The magister, having got\nhimself soundly beaten the night before, was still sleeping away the\neffects of it, so she and Margot stayed for an hour in solitude.\nVoices passed the door many times, and at last a Master Viridus\nentered stealthily. He was one of the Lord Cromwell's secretaries, and\nhe bore a purse. His name had been Greene but he had translated it to\ngive a more worshipful sound. His eyes were furtive and he moved his\nlips perpetually in imitation of his master; wore a hooded cap, and\nmade much use of the Italian language.\n\n'Bounty is the sign of the great, and honourable service ensureth its\ncontinuance,' he said in a dry and arrogant voice. 'This is my Lord\nPrivy Seal's vails. My lord hath gone to his own house.'\n\nHe presented the purse of gold, and peered round at the room which,\nfollowing the warrant, had been assigned by a clerk from the Earl\nMarshal's office.\n\n'I thank your lord, and shall endeavour to deserve his good bounty,'\nKatharine said. The nightshade juice being left two days behind she\nhad the use of her eyes and much of the stiffness had gone out of her\nwrist.\n\n'Your ladyship had much the wiser,' he answered. He lifted the\nhangings and, under pretence of examining into her comfort, peered\ninto the great Flemish press and felt under the heavy black table to\nsee if it had a drawer for papers. Cromwell had been forced, following\nthe King's command, to give Katharine her place. But he had no love\nfor Howards, and already the maids of the Lady Mary were a mutinous\nknot. Viridus was instructed to keep an attentive eye upon this\ngirl--for they might hang her very easily since she was outspoken; or,\nhaving got her neck into a noose, they could work upon her terror and\nmake her spy upon the Lady Mary herself. None of the Lady Mary's women\nwere housed very sumptuously, but in this room there were at least an\nold tapestry, a large Flemish chair, a feather bed in a niche like an\narched cell over which the hangings could be drawn, and a cord of wood\nfor the fire. He hummed and hawed that workmen must come to bring her\nbetter hangings, and a servitor be found to keep her door. A watch was\nto be set on her; the women who measured her for clothes would try to\ndiscover whom she loved and hated, and the serving man at her door\nwould report her visitors.\n\n'My lord hath you very present in his mind,' Viridus said.\n\nShe was commanded to go on the Saturday to the house in Austin\nFriars, where my lord was preparing a great feast in the honour of the\nQueen.\n\nKatharine said that she had no dress to go in.\n\n'A seemly decent habit shall be got ready,' he answered. 'You shall\nsit in a gallery in private, and it shall be pointed out to you what\nlords you shall speak with and whom avoid.' For '_com' \u00c3\u00a8 bella\ngiovinezza_' ... How beautiful is youth, what a pleasant season! And\nsince it lasted but a short space it behoved us all--and her as much\nas any--to make as much as might be whilst it endured. The regard of a\ngreat lord such as Privy Seal brought present favours and future\nhonours in the land, honours being pleasant in their turn, when youth\nis passed, like the mellow suns of autumn. 'Thereby indeed,' he\napostrophised her, 'the savour of youth reneweth itself again and\nagain.... \"_Anzi rinuova come fa la luna_,\" in the words of Boccace.'\n\nHer fair and upright beauty made Viridus acknowledge how excellent a\nspy upon the Lady Mary she might make. Papistry and a loyal love for\nthe Old Faith seemed to be as strong in her candid eyes as it was\nimplicit in her name. The Lady Mary might trust her for that and talk\nwith her because of her skill in the learned tongues. Then, if they\nheld her in their hands, how splendid a spy she might make, being so\ntrusted! She might well be won for their cause by the offer of liberal\nrewards, though Privy Seal's hand had been heavy upon all her\nkinsfolk. These men of Privy Seal's get from him a maxim which he got\nin turn from his master Macchiavelli: '_Advance therefore those whom\nit shall profit thee to make thy servants: for men forget sooner the\ndeath of a father than the loss of a patrimony_'--and either by\nthreats or by rewards they might make her very useful.\n\nShe had been minded to mock him in the beginning of his speech, but\nhis dangerous pale-blue eyes made her feel that if he were ridiculous\nhe was also very powerful, and that she was in the hands of these men.\n\nTherefore she answered that youth indeed was a pleasant season when\nhealth, good victuals and the love of God sustained it.\n\nHe surveyed her out of the corners of his eyes.\n\n'Seek, then, to deserve these good things,' he said. He stayed some\ntime longer directing her how she should wear her clothes, and then in\nthe gathering dusk he dwindled stealthily through the door.\n\n'It is to make you like a chained-up beast or slave,' Margot said to\nher mistress.\n\n'Why, hold your tongue, coney, after to-day,' Katharine answered, 'the\nwalls shall hear. I am a very poor man's daughter and must even earn\nmy bread if I would stay here.'\n\n'They could never tie me so,' Margot retorted.\n\nHer mistress laughed:\n\n'Why, you may set nets for the wind, but what a man will catch is\nstill uncertain.'\n\nIt was cold, and they piled up the fire, waiting for some one to bring\nthem candles.\n\nA tall and bulky figure, with a heavy cloak cast over one shoulder in\nthe Spanish fashion, but with a priest's cap, was suddenly in the\ndoorway.\n\n'Ha, magister,' Katharine said, knowing no other man that could visit\nher. But the firelight shone upon a heavy, firm jaw that was never the\nmagister's, on white hands and in threatening, steadfast eyes.\n\n'I am the unworthy Bishop Gardiner, of Winchester,' a harsh voice\nsaid. 'I seek one Katharine Howard. Peace be with you in these evil\ndays.'\n\nKatharine fell upon her knees before this holy man. He gave her his\nblessing perfunctorily, and muttered some words of the exorcism\nagainst demons.\n\n'I am even cured,' Katharine said.\n\nHe sent Margot Poins from the room, and stood in the firelight that\nthrew his great shadow to shake upon the hangings, towering above\nKatharine Howard upon her knees. He was silent, as if he would\nthreaten her, and his brooding eyes glowed and devoured her face. Here\nthen, she thought, was the man from the other camp descending\nsecretly upon her. He had no need to threaten, for she was of his\nside.\n\nHe said that a Magister Udal had reported that she stood in need of\nChristian aid, and, speaking Latin with a heavy voice, he interrogated\nher as to her faith. The times were evil: many and various heresies\nstalked about the land: let her beware of trafficking with them.\n\nKneeling still in the firelight, she answered that, so far as was\nlawful, she was a daughter of the Church.\n\nHe muttered: 'Lawful!' and looked at her for a long time with brooding\nand fanatical eyes. 'I hear you have read many heathen books under a\nstrange master.'\n\nShe answered: 'Most Reverend, I am for the Old Faith in the old way.'\n\n'A prudent tongue is also a Christian possession,' he muttered.\n\n'Nay there is no one to hear in this room,' she said.\n\nHe bent over her to raise her to her feet and holding before her eyes\nhis missal, he indicated to her certain prayers that she should recite\nin order to prevent the fiend's coming to her again. Suddenly he\ncommanded her to tell him how often she had conversed with the King's\nHighness.\n\nGardiner was the bitterest of all whom Cromwell had to hate him. He\nhad been of the King's Council, and a secretary before Cromwell had\nreached the Court, and, but for Cromwell, he might well have been the\nKing's best minister. But Cromwell had even taken his secretaryship;\nand he was set upon having Privy Seal down all through those ten\nyears. He had been bishop before any of these changes had been thought\nof, and by such Papists as Katharine Howard he was esteemed the most\nholy man in the land.\n\nShe told him that she had seen the King but once for a little time.\n\n'They told me it was many times,' he answered fiercely. 'Should I have\ncome here merely to chatter with you?'\n\nThere was something sinister and harsh even in the bluish tinge of his\nshaven jaws, and his agate-blue eyes were sombre, threatening and\nsuspicious.\n\nShe answered: 'But once,' and related the story very soberly.\n\nHe threatened her with his finger.\n\n'Have a care that you speak truth. Things will not always remain in\nthis guise. I come to warn you that you speak the King with a loyal\npurpose. His Highness listens sometimes to the promptings of his\nwomen.'\n\n'You might have saved your journey,' she answered. 'I could speak no\notherwise if he loved me.'\n\nHe gazed involuntarily round at the hangings as if he suspected a\nlistener.\n\n'Your Most Reverence does ill to doubt me,' Katharine said\nsubmissively. 'I am of a true house.'\n\n'No house is true save where it finds its account,' he answered\nmoodily. He could not believe that she spoke the truth--for he was\nunable to believe that any man could speak the truth--but it was true\nshe was poorly housed, raggedly dressed and hidden up in a corner.\nNevertheless, these might be artifices. He made ostentatiously and\ndisdainfully towards the door.\n\n'Why, God keep you,'--he moved his fingers in a negligent blessing--'I\nbelieve you are true, though you are of little use.' Suddenly he shot\nout:\n\n'If you would stay here in peace your cousin Culpepper must begone.'\n\nKatharine put her hand to her heart in sudden fear of these men who\nsurrounded her and knew everything.\n\n'What hath Tom done?' she asked.\n\n'He hath put a shame upon thee,' the bishop answered. He had fallen\nupon Sir Christopher Aske: he had been set in chains for it, in the\nDuke's ward room. But upon the coming of the Queen the night before,\nall misdemeanants had been cast loose again. Culpepper had been kept\nby the guards from entering the palace, where he had no place. But he\nhad fallen in with the Magister Udal in the courtyard. Being maudlin\nand friendly at the time, he had cast his arms round the magister's\nneck claiming him for a loved acquaintance. They had drunk together\nand had started, towards midnight, to find the chamber of Katharine\nHoward, Culpepper seeking his cousin, and the magister, Margot Poins.\nOn the way they had enlisted other jovial souls, and the tumult in the\ncorridor had arisen. 'These scandals are best avoided,' the bishop\nfinished. 'I have known women lose their lives through them when they\ncame to have husbands.'\n\n'I could have calmed him,' Katharine said. 'He is always silent at a\nword from me.'\n\nGardiner stood pondering, his head hanging down. His eyes, hard and\nblue, flashed at her and then down again at the floor.\n\n'They told me you were the King's good friend,' he said, resentfully.\n'Your gossip Udal told my chaplain, and it hath been repeated.'\n\n'They will talk where there are a many together,' Katharine answered;\n'the magister is a notorious babbler and will have told many lies.'\n\n'He is a spy of Privy Seal's and deep in his councils,' Gardiner\nanswered gloomily.\n\nA heavy wind that had arisen hurled itself against the dark casement.\nLittle flaws of cold air penetrated the room, and the bishop pulled\nhis cap further down over his ears.\n\n'My Lord Privy Seal would send my cousin to Calais where there is\nfighting to come,' Katharine said.\n\nGardiner raised his head sharply at Cromwell's name.\n\n'You speak sense at the end,' he muttered. To him too it had occurred\nthat if she was to be the King's peaceably, this madman must begone.\nIf Cromwell wished this lover of this girl out of the way, the reason\nwas not obscure.\n\n'A man of his hath been here this very day,' Katharine said.\n\n'Privy Seal learned whoremastering in Italy,' Gardiner cried\ntriumphantly. 'He saw signs that his Highness inclined to you. Have a\ncare for your little soul.'\n\n'Why, I think Privy Seal had no such vain imagination,' Katharine\nanswered submissively. She would have laughed that the magister's\ninsane babblings should have raised such a coil; but Gardiner was a\nman esteemed very saintly, and she kept her eyes on the floor.\n\n'Give thou ear to no doctrines of Privy Seal's,' he answered swiftly.\n'Thy soul should burn: I will curse thee. If the King shall offer thee\nfavours for thy friends come thou to me for spiritual guidance.'\n\nShe opened amazed and candid eyes upon him.\n\n'But this is a folly,' she said. 'A King may regard one for a minute,\nthen it is past. Privy Seal would not bring me up against the King.'\n\nHe flashed his gloomy blue eyes at her, suspecting her, and still\nthreatening.\n\n'I know how Privy Seal will plot,' he said passionately. 'Having\nfailed with one woman he will bring another.'\n\nHe clenched his hands angrily and unclenched them: the wind moaned for\na moment among the chimney stacks.\n\n'So it is!' he cried, from deep down in his chest. 'If it were not so,\nhow is there all this clamour about his Highness and a woman?'\n\n'Most Reverend,' she said, 'there is no end to the inventions of\nMagister Udal.'\n\n'There is none to the machinations of the fiend, and Udal is of his\ncouncils,' he said. 'Be careful, I tell you, for your soul's sake.\nCromwell shall come to you offering you great bribes. Have a care I\nsay!'\n\nShe attempted to say that Udal had no voice at all in Privy Seal's\ncouncils, being a garrulous magpie that no sane man would trust. But\nGardiner had crossed his arms and stood, immense and shadowy, in the\nfirelight. He hissed irritably between his teeth when she spoke, as if\nshe interrupted his meditation.\n\n'All the world knows Udal for his spy,' he said, sombrely. 'If Udal\nhath babbled, God be thanked. I say again: if Privy Seal bring thee to\nthe King, come thou to me. But, by the Grace of Heaven, I will\nforestall Privy Seal with thee and the King!'\n\nShe forbore to contradict him any more; he had this maggot in his\nhead, and was so wild to defeat Privy Seal with his own tool.\n\nHe muttered: 'Think you Privy Seal knoweth not the King's taste? I\ntell you he hath seen an inclination in him towards you. This is a\nplot, but I have sounded it!'\n\nShe let him talk, and asked, with a malice too fine for him to\ndiscern:\n\n'I should not shun the King's presence for my soul's sake?'\n\n'God forbid,' he answered. 'I may use thee to bring down Privy Seal.'\n\nHe picked up a piece of bark from a faggot beside the fire and rolled\nit between his fingers. She stood looking at him intently, her lips a\nlittle parted, tall, graceful and submissive.\n\n'You are more fair-skinned than any his Highness has favoured before,'\nhe said in a meditative voice. 'Yet Cromwell knows the King's tastes\nbetter than any man.' He sank down into her tall-backed chair and\nsuddenly tossed the piece of bark into the fire. 'I would have you\nwalk across the floor, elevating your arms as you were the goddess\nFlora.'\n\nShe tripped towards the door, held her arms above her head, turned her\nlong body to right and left, bent very low in a courtesy to him, and\nlet her hands fall restfully into her lap. The firelight shone upon\nthe folds of her dress and in the white lining of her hood. He looked\nat her, leaning over the arm of the chair, his blue eyes hard with the\nstrenuous rage of his new project.\n\n'You could take a part in an Italian interlude? A masque?'\n\n'I have a better memory of the French or Latin,' she answered.\n\n'You do not turn pale? Your knees knock not together?'\n\n'I think I blush most,' she said seriously.\n\nHe answered, 'You will be the better of a little colour,' and began\nmuffling his face with his cloak.\n\n'See you, then,' his harsh voice commanded. 'You shall see their\nHighnesses at Privy Seal's house on the Saturday; but they shall see\nyou at mine on the Tuesday. If you are good enough to serve the turn\nof Privy Seal, you may be good enough to serve mine. The King listens\nsometimes to the promptings of his women. I will teach you how you may\nbring this man down and set me in his place.'\n\nShe reflected for a moment. 'I would well serve you,' she said. 'But I\ndo not believe this fable of the King, and I have no memory of\nItalian.' She talked of being the Lady Mary's servant, or that she\nmust get her lady's leave.\n\nHis brows grew heavy, his eyes threatening and alarming beneath their\nheavy lids.\n\n'Be you faithful to me,' he thundered. Even his thin and delicate\nhands seemed to menace her. 'Retain your obedience to your Faith. Your\nduty is to that, and to no earthly lady before that.'\n\nHer eyes were cast down, her lips did not move. He said, harshly, 'It\nwill go ill with you if it become known to Cromwell I have visited\nyou. Keep this matter secret as you love your liberty. I will send you\nthe words you shall say by a private bearer. After, maybe, his\nHighness shall safeguard you, I admonishing him. But the Lady Mary\nshall bid you obey me in all things.'\n\nHe opened the door and put his head out cautiously. Suddenly he drew\nit back and said in Latin, 'Here is a spy.' He did not flinch, but\nadvanced into the corridor, keeping his back to the servitor whom\nalready Master Viridus had sent to keep her door. Gardiner fumbled in\nhis robes and pulled out his missal. He turned the pages over, and,\nspeaking in a feigned and squeaky voice, once more indicated to her\nprayers against the visitations of fiends. Reading them aloud, he\ninterspersed the Latin of the missal with the phrases, 'You may pray\nto God he have not seen my face. Be you very silent and secret, or you\nare undone. I could in no wise save you from Cromwell unless the King\nbecomes your protector.' He finished in the vulgar tongue. 'I pray my\nprayers with you may have availed to give you relief. But a simple\npriest as myself is of small skill in these visitations. You should\nhave sent to some great Churchman or one of the worshipful bishops.'\n\n'Good Father Henry, I thank you,' she answered, having entered into\nhis artifice. He went away, feigning to limp on his right knee, and\nkeeping his face from the spy.\n\nAt the corner of the corridor Margot Poins, an immense blonde and\ngentle figure in Lutheran grey, stood back in the hangings. The\nMagister Udal leant over her, supporting himself with one hand against\nthe wall above her head and one leg crossed beneath his gown.\n\n'Come you into my room,' Katharine said to the girl; and to the\nmagister, 'Avoid, man of books. I will have no maid of mine undone by\nthee.'\n\n'_Venio honoris causa_,' he said pertly, and Margot uttered, 'He seeks\nme in wedlock,' in a gruff, uncontrolled voice of a great young girl's\nconfusion, and immense blushes covered her large cheeks.\n\nKatharine laughed; she was sorely afraid of the serving man behind\nher, for that he was a spy set there by Viridus she was very sure, and\nshe was casting about in her mind for a device that should let her\ntell whether or no he had known the bishop. The squeaky voice and the\nfeigned limp seemed to her stratagems ignoble and futile on the part\nof a great Churchman, and his mania of plots and counter-plottings had\ndepressed and wearied her, for she expected the great to be wise. But\nshe played her part for him as it was her duty. She spoke to the girl\nwith her scarlet cheeks.\n\n'Believe thou the magister after he hath ta'en thee afore a priest. He\nhath sought me and two score others in the cause of honour. Get you\nin, sweetheart.'\n\nShe pushed the girl in at the door. The serving man sat on his stool;\nhis shock of yellow hair had never known a comb, but he had a decent\nsuit of a purplish wool-cloth. He had his eyes dully on the ground.\n\n'As you value your servitorship, let no man come into my room when I\nbe out,' Katharine said to him. 'Saving only the Father Henry that was\nhere now.'\n\nThe man raised expressionless blue eyes to her face.\n\n'I know not his favours,' he said in a peasant's mutter. 'Maybe I\nshould know him if I saw him again. I am main good at knowing people.'\n\n'Why, he is from the Sheeres,' Katharine added, still playing, though\nshe was certain that the man knew Gardiner. 'You shall know him by his\nvoice and his limp.'\n\nHe answered, 'Maybe,' and dropped his eyes to the ground. She sent him\nto fetch her some candles, and shut the door upon him.\n\n\nII\n\nThe Queen came to the revels given in her honour by the Lord Privy\nSeal. Cromwell had three hundred servants dressed in new liveries:\npikemen with their staves held transversely, like a barrier, kept the\nroad all the way from the Tower Steps to Austin Friars, and in that\nLutheran quarter of the town there was a great crowding together. Caps\nwere pitched high and lost for ever, and loud shouts of praise to God\nwent up when the Queen and her Germans passed, with boys casting\nbranches of holm, holly, bay and yew, the only plants that were green\nin the winter season, before the feet of her mule. But the King did\nnot come. It was reported to the crowd that he was ill at Greenwich.\n\nIt was known very well by those that sat at dinner with her that,\nafter three days, he had abandoned his Queen and kept his separate\nroom. She sat eating alone, on high beneath the dais, heavy, silent,\nplacid and so fair that her eyebrows appeared to be white upon her red\nforehead. She did not speak a word, having no English, and it was\nconsidered disgusting that she wiped her fingers upon pieces of bread.\n\nHostile lords remarked upon all her physical imperfections, which the\nKing, it was known, had reported to his physicians in a writing of\nmany pages. Besides, she had no English, no French, no Italian; she\ncould not even play cards with his Highness. It was true that they had\nsqueezed her into English stays, but she was reported to have wept at\nhaving to mount a horse. So she could not go a-hawking, neither could\nshe shoot with the bow, and her attendants--the women, bound about the\nmiddle and spreading out above and below like bolsters, and the men,\nwho wore their immense scolloped hats falling over their ears even at\nmeal-times--excited disgust and derision by the noises they made when\nthey ate.\n\nThe Master Viridus had Katharine Howard in his keeping. He took her up\ninto a small gallery near the gilded roof of the long hall and pointed\nout to her, far below, the courtiers that it was safe for her to\nconsort with, because they were friends of Privy Seal. His manner was\nmore sinister and more meaning.\n\n'You would do well to have to do with no others,' he said.\n\n'I am like to have to do with none at all,' Katharine answered, 'for\nno mother's son cometh anigh me.'\n\nHe looked away from her. Down below she made out her cousin Surrey,\nsitting with his back ostentatiously turned to a Lord Roydon, of\nCromwell's following; her uncle, plunged in his silent and malignant\ngloom; and Cromwell, his face lit up and smiling, talking earnestly\nwith Chapuys, the Ambassador from the Emperor.\n\n'Eleven hundred dishes shall be served this day,' Viridus proclaimed,\nseeming to warn her. 'There can no other lord find so many plates of\nparcel gilt.' His level and cold voice penetrated through all the\nascending din of voices, of knives, of tuckets of trumpets that\nannounced the courses of meat and of the three men's songs that\nintroduced the sweet jellies which only Privy Seal, it was said, could\ndirect to be prepared.\n\n'Other lordings all,' Viridus continued with his sermon, 'ha' ruined\nthemselves seeking in vain to vie with my lord. Most of those you see\nare broken men, whose favour would be worth naught to you.'\n\nTables were ranged down each side of the great hall, the men sitting\non the right, each wearing upon his shoulder a red rose made of silk\nsince no flowers were to be had. The women, sitting upon the left, had\nwhite favours in their caps. In the wide space between these tables\nwere two bears; chained to tall gilt posts, they rolled on their hams\nand growled at each other. From time to time the serving men who went\nup and down in the middle let fall great dishes containing craspisces,\ncranes, swans or boars. These meats were kicked contemptuously aside\nfor the bears to fight over, and their places supplied immediately\nwith new. Other serving men broke priceless bottles of Venetian glass\nagainst the corners of tables, and let the costly Rhenish wines run\nabout their feet.\n\nThis, the Master Viridus said, was intended to point out the wealth of\ntheir lord and his zealousness to entertain his Sovereigns.\n\n'It would serve the purpose as well to give them twice as much fare,'\nKatharine said.\n\n'They could never contain it,' Viridus answered gravely, 'so great is\nthe bounty of my lord.'\n\nThrockmorton, the spy, enormous, bearded and with the half-lion badge\nof the Privy Seal hanging round his neck from a gilt chain, walked up\nand down behind the guests, bearing the wand of a major-domo,\naffecting to direct the servers when to fill goblets and listening at\ntables where much wine had been served. Once he looked up at the\ngallery, and his scrutinising and defiant brown eyes remained for a\nlong time upon Katharine's face, as if he too were appraising her\nbeauty.\n\n'I would not drink much wine with that man listening at my back. He\ncame from my country, and was such a foul villain that mothers fright\ntheir children with his name,' Katharine said.\n\nViridus moved his lips quickly one upon another, and suddenly directed\nher to observe the new Queen's head-dress, broad and stiffened with a\nwire of gold, upon which large pearls had been sewn.\n\n'Many ladies will now get themselves such headdresses,' he said.\n\n'That will I never,' she answered. It appeared atrocious and\nFlemish-clumsy, spreading out and overshadowing the Queen's heavy\nface. Their English hoods with the tails down made the head sleek and\ncomely; or, with the tails folded up and pinned square like flat caps\nthey could give to the face a gallant or a pensive expression.\n\n'Why, I could never get me in at the door of the confessional with\nsuch a spreading cloth.'\n\nViridus had his chin on the rail of the gallery; he gazed down below\nwith his snaky eyes. She could not tell whether he were old or young.\n\n'You would more prudently abandon the confessing,' he said, without\nlooking at her. 'My lord is minded that ladies who look to him should\nwear such.'\n\n'That is to be a bond-slave,' Katharine cried indignantly. He looked\nround.\n\n'Here is a great magnificence,' he uttered, moving his hand towards\nthe hall. 'My Lord Privy Seal hath a mighty power.'\n\n'Not power enow to make me a laughing-stock for the men.'\n\n'Why, this is a free land,' he answered. 'You may rot in a ditch if\nyou will, or worse if treasonable actions be brought home to you.'\n\nDown below, wild men dressed in the skins of wolves, hares and stags\nran round the tethered bears bearing torches of sweet wood, and a\nheavy and languorous smoke, like incense, mounted up to the gallery.\nViridus' unveiled threat made the necessity for submission come once\nmore into her mind. Other wild men were leading in a lion, immense and\nlean as if it were a fawn-coloured ass. It roared and pulled at the\ngolden chains by which the knot of men held it. Many ladies shrieked\nout, but the men dragged the lion into the open space before the dais\nwhere the Queen sat unmoved and stolid.\n\n'Would your master have me dip my fingers in the dish and wipe them on\nbread-manchets as the Queen does?' Katharine asked in a serious\nexpostulation.\n\n'It were an excellent action,' Viridus answered.\n\nThere was a brazen flare of trumpets so that the smoke swirled among\nthe rafters. Men with brass helmets and shields of brass were below in\nthe hall.\n\n'They are costumed as the ancient Romans,' Katharine said, lost in\nother thoughts.\n\nSuddenly she saw that whilst all the other eyes were upon the lion,\nThrockmorton's glare was again upon her face. He appeared to shake his\nhead and to bow his immense and bearded form. It brought into her mind\nthe dangerous visit of Bishop Gardiner. Suddenly he dropped his eyes.\n\n'You see some friends,' Viridus' voice asked beside her.\n\n'Nay, I have no friends here,' Katharine answered.\n\nShe could not tell that the bearded spy's eyes were not merely amorous\nin their intention, for such looks she was used to, and he was a very\nvile man.\n\n'In short,' Viridus spoke, 'it were an excellent action to act in all\nthings as the Queen does. For fashions are a matter of fashion. It is\nall one whether you wipe your fingers on bread-manchets or on napkins.\nBut when a fashion becometh general its strangeness departeth and it\nis esteemed fit for a King's Court. Thus you may earn your bread: this\nis your duteous work. Observe the king of the beasts. See how it shall\ndo its duty before the Queen, and mark the lesson.' His voice\npenetrated, low and level, through all the din from below. Yet the men\ndressed like gladiators advanced towards the dais where the Queen sat\neating unmoved. The lion before her growled frightfully, and dragged\nits keepers towards the men in brass. They drew their short swords and\nbeat upon their shields crying: 'We be Roman traitors that war upon\nthis land.' Then it appeared that among them in their crowd they had a\nlarge mannikin, dressed like themselves in brass and running upon\nwheels.\n\nThe ladies pressed the tables with their hands, making as if to rise\nin terror. But the mannikin toppling forward fell before the lion with\na hollow sound of brass. The lean beast, springing at its throat, tore\nit to reach the highly smelling flesh that was concealed within the\ntunic, and the Romans fled, casting away their shields and swords. One\nof them had a red forked beard and wide-open blue eyes. He brought\ninto Katharine's mind the remembrance of her cousin. She wondered\nwhere he could be, and imagined him with that short sword, cutting his\nway to her side.\n\n'That sight is allegorically to show,' Viridus was commenting beside\nher, 'how the high valour of Britain shall defend from all foes this\nnoble Queen.'\n\nThe lion having reached its meat lay down upon it.\n\nKatharine remembered that Bishop Gardiner said that her cousin must be\nbegone. She tried to say to Viridus: 'Sir, I would fain obey you in\nthese things, but I have a cousin that shall much hinder me.'\n\nBut the applause of the people below drowned her voice and Viridus\ncontinued talking.\n\nLet it be true that the Queen, being alone, showed amongst their\nEnglish fineries and nicenesses a gross and repulsive strangeness. But\nif their ladies put on her manners she should no longer be alone, and\nit would appear to the King and to all men that her example was both\ncommended and emulated. It was a matter of kingcraft, and so the Lord\nPrivy Seal was minded and determined.\n\n'Then I will even get myself such a hat and tear my capons apart with\nmy fingers,' Katharine said.\n\n'You had much the wiser,' he answered.\n\nThe hall was now full of wild men, nymphs in white gowns, men bearing\naspergers with which to scatter perfumes, and merry andrews, so that\nthe floor could no longer be seen. A party of lords had overset a\ntable in their efforts to get to the nymphs. The Queen was schooled\nto go out behind the arras, and the ladies, laughing, calling to each\nother and to the men at the other tables, and pinning up their hoods,\nfiled out after her.\n\n'I shall do my best to please your master and mine,' Katharine said.\n'But he must even help me, or I can be no example to emulate, but one\nat whom the finger of scorn is likely to be pointed.'\n\nViridus paused before he led his charge from the gallery. His\npale-blue eyes were more placable.\n\n'You shall be well seconded. But have a care. Dally with no traitors.\nSpeak fairly of your master's friends.' He touched her above the left\nbreast with a claw-like finger. 'The Italian writes: \"Whoso mocketh my\nlove mocketh also mine own self.\"'\n\n'I mock none,' Katharine said. 'But I have a cousin to be provided for\nthat neither you nor I shall mock with much safety if he be sober\nenough to stand.'\n\nHe listened to her with his hand upon the door of the gallery: his air\nwas attentive and aroused. She related very simply how Culpepper had\nbesieged her door--'He came to London to help me on my way and to seek\nfortune in some war. I would that a place might be found for him, for\nhere he is like to ruin both himself and me.'\n\n'We have need of good swordsmen for an errand,' he said, in an\nabsorbed voice.\n\n'There was never a better than Tom,' Katharine said. 'He hath cut a\nscore of throats. Your lord would have sent him to Calais.'\n\nHe muttered:\n\n'Why, there are places other than Calais where a man may make a\nfortune.'\n\nSomething sinister in his brooding voice made her say:\n\n'I would not have him killed. He hath made me many presents.'\n\nHe looked at her expressionlessly:\n\n'It is very certain that you can not serve my lord with such a\nfirebrand to your tail,' he said. 'I will find him an errand.'\n\n'But not where he shall be killed,' she said again.\n\n'Why,' he said slowly, 'I will send him where he will make a great\nfortune.'\n\n'A great fortune would help him little,' she answered. 'I would have\nhim sent where he may fight evenly matched.'\n\nHe laid his hand upon her wrist.\n\n'He is in as much danger here as anywhere. This is not Lincolnshire,\nbut an ordered Court.'--A man drew his sword with some peril there,\nfor there were laws against it. If men came brawling in the maids'\nquarters at nights there were penalties of losing fingers, hands, or\neven heads. And the maids themselves were liable to be whipped.--He\nshook his head at her:\n\n'If your cousin hath so violent an inclination to you I were your best\nfriend to send him far away.'\n\nIt was in his mind that if they were to breed this girl to be a spy\nthey must keep her protected from madmen. Something of mystery in his\nmanner penetrated to her quick senses.\n\n'God help me, what a dangerous place this is!' she said. 'I would I\nhad never spoken to you of my cousin.'\n\nHe eyed her solemnly and said that if she were minded to wed this\nroaring boy they might both, and soon, earn fortunes to buy them land\nin a distant shire.\n\n\nIII\n\nThe young Poins, in his scarlet and black, drew his sister into a\ncorner of the hall in which the gentry of the Lords that were there\nhad already dined. It was a vast place, used as a rule for hearing\nsuitors to the Lord Privy Seal and for the audit dinners of his\ntenantry in London. On its whitened walls there were trophies of arms,\nand between the wall and the platform at the end of the hall was a\nsmall space convenient for private talk. The rest of the people there\nwere playing round games for kissing forfeits or clustered round a\nmagician who had brought a large ape to tell fortunes by the _Sortes\nVirgilian\u00c3\u00a6_. It fumbled about in the pages of a black-letter \u00c3\u0086neid,\nand scratched its side voluptuously: taking its own time it looked at\nthe pages attentively with a mournful parody of an aged sage, and set\nits finger upon a line that the fates directed.\n\n'Here's a great ado about thee,' Poins said, laughing at his sister.\n'Thy name is up in this town of London.'\n\nHe had come in the bodyguard of the Queen, and had made time to slip\nround to old Badge's low house behind the wall in order to beg from\nhis grandfather ten crowns to pay for a cloak he had lost at cards.\n\n'Such a cackle among these Lutherans,' he mocked at Margot. 'Heard you\nno hootings as your lady rode here behind us of the guard?'\n\n'I heard none, nor she deserveth none,' Margot answered. 'For I love\nher most well.'\n\n'Aye, she hath done a rape on thee,' he laughed. 'Aye, our good uncle\nhath printed a very secret libel upon her.' He began to whisper: Let\nit not be known or a sudden vengeance might fall upon their house. It\nwas no small matter to print unlicensed broadsides. But their moody\nuncle was out of all fear of consequences, so mad with rage. 'He would\nhave broken my back, because I tore thee from his tender keeping.'\n\n'Sure it was never so tender,' Margot said. 'When was there a day that\nhe did not beat me?' But he would have married her to his apprentice,\na young fellow with a golden tongue, that preached every night to a\nsecret congregation in a Cripplegate cellar.\n\n'Why, an thou observest my maxims,' the boy said, sententiously, 'I\nwill have thee a great lady. But uncle hath printed this libel, and\ntongues are at work in Austin Friars.' It was said that this was a new\nPapist plot. Margot was but the first that they should carry off. The\nDuke and Bishop Gardiner were reported to have signed papers for\nabducting all the Lutheran virgins in London. They were to be led from\nthe paths of virtue into Catholic lewdnesses, and all their boys were\nto be abducted and sent into monasteries across the seas.\n\n'Thus the race of Lutherans should die out,' he laughed. 'Why they are\nhiding their maidens in pigeon-houses in Holborn. A boy called Hugh\nhath gone out and never come home, and it is said that masked men in\nblack stuff gowns were seen to put him into a sack in Moorfields.'\n\n'Well, here be great marvels,' Margot laughed.\n\nHe shook his red sides, and his blue eyes grew malicious and teasing:\n\n'Such a strumpet as thy lady,' he uttered. 'A Papist Howard that is\nknown to have been loved by twenty men in Lincoln.'\n\nMargot passed from laughter into hot anger:\n\n'It is a marvel God strikes not their tongues with palsy that said\nthat,' she said swiftly. 'Why do you not kill some of them if you be a\nman?'\n\n'Why, be calmed,' he said. 'You have heard such tales before now. It\nis no more than saying that a woman goes not to their churches to\npray.'\n\nA young Marten Pewtress, half page, half familiar to the Earl of\nSurrey, came towards them calling, 'Hal Poins.' He had black down upon\nhis chin and a roving eye. He wore a purple coat like a tabard, and a\ncap with his master's arms upon a jewelled brooch.\n\n'They say there's a Howard wench come to Court,' he cried from a\ndistance, 'and thy sister in her service.'\n\n'We talk of her,' Poins answered. 'Here is my sister.'\n\nThe young Pewtress kissed the girl upon the cheek.\n\n'Pray, you, sweetheart, unfold,' he said. 'You are a pretty piece, and\nhave a good brother that's my friend.'\n\nHe asked all of a breath whether this lady had yet had the small-pox?\nwhether her hair were her own? how tall she stood without high heels\nto her shoon? whether her breath were sweet or her language unpleasing\nin the Lincolnshire jargon? whether the King had sent her many\npresents?\n\nMargaret Poins was a very large, fair, and credulous creature, rising\ntwenty. Florid and slow-speaking, she had impulses of daring that\ncovered her broad face with immense blushes. She was dressed in grey\nlinsey-woolsey, and wore a black hood after the manner of the stricter\nProtestants, but she had round her neck a gilt medallion on a gold\nchain that Katharine Howard had given her already. She was, it was\ntrue, the daughter of a gentleman courtier, but he had been knocked on\nthe head by rebels near Exeter just before her birth, and her mother\nhad died soon after. She had been treated with gloomy austerity by her\nuncle and with sinister kindness by her grandfather, whom she dreaded.\nSo that, coming from her Bedfordshire aunt, who had a hard cane, to\nthis palace, where she had seen fine dresses and had already been\nkissed by two lords in the corridors, she was ready to aver that the\nLady Katharine had a breath as sweet as the kine, a white skin which\nthe small-pox had left unscarred, hair that reached to her ankles, and\na learning and a wit unimaginable. Her own fortune was made, she\nbelieved, in serving her. Both the magister and her brother had sworn\nit, and, living in an age of marvels--dragons, portents from the\nheavens, and the romances of knight errantry--she was ready to believe\nit. It was true that the lady's room had proved a cell more bare and\ndarker than her own at home, but Katharine's bright and careless\nlaughter, her fair and radiant height, and her ready kisses and\npleasant words, made the girl say with hot loyalty:\n\n'She is more fair than any in the land, and, indeed, she is the apple\nof the King's eye.' Her voice was gruff with emotion, but, suddenly\nbecoming very aware that she was talking to a strange young gentleman\nwho might scoff, she seemed to choke and put her hand over her mouth.\n\nBrocades for dresses, perfumes, gloves, oranges, and even another\nnetted purse of green silk holding gold had continued to be brought to\ntheir chamber ever since Privy Seal had signed the warrant, and, it\nbeing about the new year, these ordinary vails and perquisites of a\nMaid of Honour made a show. Margot believed very sincerely that these\nthings came direct from the King's hands, since they were formally\nannounced as coming of his Highness' great bounty.\n\nShe reported to young Pewtress, 'And even now she is with the Lord\nPrivy Seal, who brought her to Court.'\n\n'He will go poaching among our Howards now,' Pewtress said. He stood\nconsidering with an air of gloom that the Norfolk servants imitated\nfrom their master, along with such sayings as that the times were very\nevil, and that no true man's neck was safe on his shoulders. 'Pray\nyou, Sweetlips, tell no one this for a day until I have told my\nmaster. It may get me some crowns.' He pinched her chin between his\nthumb and forefinger. 'I will be your sweetheart, pretty.'\n\n'Nay, I am provided with a good one,' Margot said seriously.\n\n'You cannot have too many in this place. Take me for when the other's\nin gaol and another for when I am hung, as all good men are like to\nbe.' He turned away lightly and loosened one of his jewelled garters,\nso that his stockings should hang in slovenly folds to prove that he\nwas a man and despised niceness in his dress.\n\n'I would that you be not too cheap to these gentry,' her brother said,\nwith his eyes on Pewtress.\n\n'I did naught,' she answered. 'If a gentleman will kiss one, it is\nuncourtly to turn away the cheek.'\n\n'There is a way of not lending the lip,' he lectured her. 'I shall\nschool you. A kiss here, a kiss there, I grant you. But consider that\nyou be a gentleman's child, and ask who a man is.'\n\n'He was well enough favoured,' she remonstrated.\n\n'In these changing days many upstarts are come about the Court,' he\nwent on with his lesson. 'Such were not here in the old days. Crummock\nhath wrought this. Seek advancement; pleasure your mistress, who can\nadvance you; smile upon the magister, who, being advanced, can advance\nyou. Speak courteous and fair words to any great lords that shall\nobserve you. So we can rise in the world.'\n\n'I will observe thy words,' she said submissively, for he seemed to\nher great and learned; 'but I like not that thou call'st me \"you.\"'\n\n'Why, these be grave matters,' he replied, 'and \"you\" is graver than\n\"thou.\" But I love thee well. I will take thee a walk if the sun shine\nto-morrow.' He tightened his belt and took his pike from the corner.\n'As for your lady; those that made these lies are lowsels. I could\nslay a score of them if they pressed upon you two.'\n\n'I would not be so spoken of,' Margot answered.\n\n'Then you must never rise in the world, as I am minded you shall,' he\nretorted, 'for, you being in a high place, eyes will be upon you.'\n\nNevertheless, Katharine Howard heard no evil words shouted after her\nthat day. Pikemen and servitors of Cromwell were too thick upon all\nthe road to the Tower, where the courtiers took barge again. Cromwell\nmade very good order that no insults should reach the ears of such of\nthe Papist nobles as came to his feast; they would make use with the\nKing of evil words if any such were shouted. Thus the more dangerous\nand the most foul-mouthed of that neighbourhood, when the Court went\nby, found hands pressed over their mouths or scarves suddenly\ntightened round their throats by stalwart men that squeezed behind\nthem in the narrow ways, so that not many more than twenty heads on\nboth sides were broken that day; and Margot Poins kept her mouth\nclosed tight with a sort of rustic caution--a shyness of her mistress\nand a desire to spare her any pain. Thus it was not until long after\nthat Katharine heard of these rumours.\n\nKatharine was in high good spirits. She had no great reason, for\nViridus had threatened her; the Queen had rolled her large eyes round\nwhen Katharine had made her courtesy, but no words intelligible to a\nChristian had come from the thick lips; and no lord or lady had\nnoticed her with a word except that, late in the afternoon, her cousin\nSurrey, a young man with a sleepily insolent air and front teeth that\nresembled a rabbit's, had suddenly planted himself in front of her as\nshe sat on a stool against the hangings. He had begun to ask her where\nshe was housed, when another young man caught him by the shoulder and\npulled him away before he could do more than bid her sit there till he\ncame again. She had been in no mood to do that for her cousin Surrey;\nbesides, she would not be seen to speak much with a Papist henchman in\nthat house. He could seek her if he wanted her company, so she went\ninto another part of the hall, where they were all strangers.\n\nExcept for the mere prudence of pretending to obey Viridus until it\nshould be safe to defy him and his master, she troubled little about\nwhat was going to happen to her. It was enough that she was away from\nthe home where she had pined and been lonely. She sat on her stool,\nwatched the many figures that passed her, marked fashions of\nembroidery, and thought that such speeches as she chanced to hear were\nill-turned. Her sister Maids of Honour turned their backs upon her.\nOnly the dark girl, Cicely Elliott, who had gibed at her a week ago,\nhelped her to pin her sleeve that had been torn by a sword-hilt of\nsome man who had turned suddenly in a crowd. But Katharine had learnt,\nas well as the magister, that when one is poor one must accept what\nthe gods send. Besides, she knew that in the Lady Mary's household she\nwas certain to be avoided, for she was regarded still as a spy of old\nCrummock's. That, most likely, would end some day, and she had no love\nfor women's chatter.\n\nShe sat late at night correcting the embroidery of some\ntrue-love-knots that Margot had been making for her. A huckster had\nbeen there selling ribands from France, and showing a doll dressed as\nthe ladies of the French King's Court were dressing that new year. He\nhad been talking of a monster that had been born to a pig-sty on\nCornhill, and lamenting that travel was become a grievous costly thing\nsince the monasteries, with their free hostel, had been done away\nwith. The monster had been much pondered in the city; certainly it\nportended wars or strange public happenings, since it had the face of\na child, greyhound's ears, a sow's forelegs, and a dragon's tail. But\nthe huckster had gone to another room, and Margot was getting her\nsupper with the Lady Mary's serving-maids.\n\n'Save us!' Katharine said to herself over her embroidery-frame, 'here\nbe more drunkards. If I were a Queen I would make a law that any man\nshould be burnt on the tongue that was drunk more than seven times in\nthe week.' But she was already on her feet, making for the door, her\nframe dropped to the ground. There had been a murmur of voices through\nthe thick oak, and then shouts and objurgations.\n\nThomas Culpepper stood in the doorway, his sword drawn, his left hand\nclutching the throat of the serving man who was guarding her room.\n\n'God help us!' Katharine said angrily; 'will you ruin me?'\n\n'Cut throats?' he muttered. 'Aye, I can cut a throat with any man in\nChristendom or out.' He shook the man backwards and forwards to\nsupport himself. 'Kat, this offal would have kept me from thee.'\n\nKatharine said, 'Hush! it is very late.'\n\nAt the sound of her voice his face began to smile.\n\n'Oh, Kat,' he stuttered jovially, 'what law should keep me from thee?\nThou'rt better than my wife. Heathen to keep man and wife apart, I\nsay, I.'\n\n'Be still. It is very late. You will shame me,' she answered.\n\n'Why, I would not have thee shamed, Kat of the world,' he said. He\nshook the man again and threw him good humouredly against the wall.\n'Bide thou there until I come out,' he muttered, and sought to replace\nhis sword in the scabbard. He missed the hole and scratched his left\nwrist with the point. 'Well, 'tis good to let blood at times,' he\nlaughed. He wiped his hand upon his breeches.\n\n'God help thee, thou'rt very drunk,' Katharine laughed at him. 'Let me\nput up thy sword.'\n\n'Nay, no woman's hand shall touch this blade. It was my father's.'\n\nAn old knight with a fat belly, a clipped grey beard and roguish,\ntranquil eyes was ambling along the gallery, swinging a small pair of\ncheverel gloves. Culpepper made a jovial lunge at the old man's chest\nand suddenly the sword was whistling through the shadows.\n\nThe old fellow planted himself on his sturdy legs. He laughed\npleasantly at the pair of them.\n\n'An' you had not been very drunk I could never have done that,' he\nsaid to Culpepper, 'for I am passed of sixty, God help me.'\n\n'God help thee for a gay old cock,' Culpepper said. 'You could not\nhave done it without these gloves in your fist.'\n\n'See you, but the gloves are not cut,' the knight answered. He held\nthem flat in his fat hands. 'I learnt that twist forty years ago.'\n\n'Well, get you to the wench the gloves are for,' Culpepper retorted.\n'I am not long together of this pleasant mind.' He went into\nKatharine's room and propped himself against the door post.\n\nThe old man winked at Katharine.\n\n'Bid that gallant not draw his sword in these galleries,' he said.\n'There is a penalty of losing an eye. I am Rochford of Bosworth\nHedge.'\n\n'Get thee to thy wench, for a Rochford,' Culpepper snarled over his\nshoulder. 'I will have no man speak with my coz. You struck a good\nblow at Bosworth Hedge. But I go to Paris to cut a better throat than\nthine ever was, Rochford or no Rochford.'\n\nThe old man surveyed him sturdily from his head to his heels and\nwinked once more at Katharine.\n\n'I would I had had such manners as a stripling,' he uttered in a round\nand friendly voice. 'I might have prospered better in love.' Going\nsturdily along the corridor he picked up Culpepper's sword and set it\nagainst the wall.\n\nCulpepper, leaning against the doorpost, was gazing with ferocious\nsolemnity at the open clothes-press in which some hanging dresses\nappeared like women standing. He smoothed his red beard and thrust\nhis cap far back on his thatch of yellow hair.\n\n'Mark you,' he addressed the clothes-press harshly, 'that is Rochford\nof Bosworth Hedge. At the end of that day they found him with\nseventeen body wounds and the corpses of seventeen Scotsmen round him.\nHe is famous throughout Christendom. Yet in me you see a greater than\nhe. I am sent to cut such a throat. But that's a secret. Only I am a\nmade man.'\n\nKatharine had closed her door. She knew it would take her twenty\nminutes to get him into the frame of mind that he would go peaceably\naway.\n\n'Thou art very pleasant to-night,' she said. 'I have seldom seen thee\nso pleasant.'\n\n'For joy of seeing thee, Kat. I have not seen thee this six days.' He\nmade a hideous grinding sound with his teeth. 'But I have broken some\nheads that kept me from thee.'\n\n'Be calm,' Katharine answered; 'thou seest me now.'\n\nHe passed his hand over his eyes.\n\n'I'll be calm to pleasure thee,' he muttered apologetically. 'You said\nI was very pleasant, Kat.' He puffed out his chest and strutted to the\nmiddle of the room. 'Behold a made man. I could tell you such secrets.\nI am sent to slay a traitor at Rome, at Ravenna, at Ratisbon--wherever\nI find him. But he's in Paris, I'll tell thee that.'\n\nKatharine's knees trembled; she sank down into her tall chair.\n\n'Whom shalt thou slay?'\n\n'Aye, and that's a secret. It's all secrets. I have sworn upon the\nhilt of my knife. But I am bidden to go by an old-young man, a make of\nno man at all, with lips that minced and mowed. It was he bade the\nguards pass me to thee this night.'\n\n'I would know whom thou shalt slay,' she asked harshly.\n\n'Nay, I tell no secrets. My soul would burn. But I am sent to slay\nthis traitor--a great enemy to the King's Highness, from the Bishop\nof Rome. Thus I shall slay him as he comes from a Mass.'\n\nHe squatted about the room, stabbing at shadows.\n\n'It is a man with a red hat,' he grunted. 'Filthy for an Englishman to\nwear a red hat these days!'\n\n'Put up your knife,' Katharine cried, 'I have seen too much of it.'\n\n'Aye, I am a good man,' he boasted, 'but when I come back you shall\nsee me a great one. There shall be patents for farms given me. There\nshall be gold. There shall be never such another as I. I will give\nthee such gowns, Kat.'\n\nShe sat still, but smoothed back a lock of her fair hair that glowed\nin the firelight.\n\n'When I am a great man,' he babbled on, 'I will not wed thee, for who\nart thou to wed with a great man? Thou art more cheaply won. But I\nwill give thee....'\n\n'Thou fool,' she shrieked suddenly at him. 'These men shall slay thee.\nGet thee to Paris to murder as thou wilt. Thou shalt never come back\nand I shall be well rid of thee.'\n\nHe gave her a snarling laugh:\n\n'Toy thou with no man when I am gone,' he said with sudden ferocity,\nso that his blue eyes appeared to start from his head.\n\n'Poor fool, thou shalt never come back,' she answered.\n\nHe had an air of cunning and triumph.\n\n'I have settled all this with that man that's no man, Viridus; thou\nart here as in a cloister amongst the maids of the Court. No man shall\nsee thee; thou shalt speak with none that wears not a petticoat. I\nhave so contracted with that man.'\n\n'I tell thee they have contrived this to be rid of thee,' she said.\n\nHis tone became patronising.\n\n'Wherefore should they?' he asked. When there came no answer from her\nhe boasted, 'Aye, thou wouldst not have me go because thou lovest me\ntoo well.'\n\n'Stay here,' she said. 'I will give thee money.' He stood gazing at\nher with his jaw fallen. 'Thou art a drunkard and a foul tongue,' she\nsaid, 'but if thou goest to Paris to murder a cardinal thou shalt\nnever come out of that town alive. Be sure thou shalt be rendered up\nto death.'\n\nHe staggered towards her and caught one of her hands.\n\n'Why, it is but cutting of a man's throat,' he said. 'I have cut many\nthroats and have taken no harm. Be not sad! This man is a cardinal.\nBut 'tis all one. It shall make me a great man.'\n\nShe muttered, 'Poor fool.'\n\n'I have sworn to go,' he said. 'I am to have great farms and a great\nman shall watch over thee to keep thee virtuous. They have promised it\nor I had not gone.'\n\n'Do you believe their promises?' she asked derisively.\n\n'Why, 'tis a good knave, yon Viridus. He promised or ever I asked it.'\n\nHe was on his knees before her as she sat, with his arms about her\nwaist.\n\n'Sha't not cry, dear dove,' he mumbled. 'Sha't go with me to Paris.'\n\nShe sighed:\n\n'No, no. Bide here,' and passed her hand through his ruffled hair.\n\n'I would slay thee an thou were false to me,' he whispered over her\nhand. 'Get thee with me.'\n\nShe said, 'No, no,' again in a stifled voice.\n\nHe cried urgently:\n\n'Come! Come! By all our pacts. By all our secret vows.'\n\nShe shook her head, sobbing:\n\n'Poor fool. Poor fool. I am very lonely.'\n\nHe clutched her tightly and whispered in a hoarse voice:\n\n'It were merrier at home now. Thou didst vow. At home now. Of a\nsummer's night....'\n\nShe whispered: 'Peace. Peace.'\n\n'At home now. In June, thou didst....'\n\nShe said urgently: 'Be still. Wouldst thou woo me again to the\ngrunting of hogs?'\n\n'Aye, would I,' he answered. 'Thou didst....'\n\nShe moved convulsively in her chair. He grasped her more tightly.\n\n'Thou yieldest, I know thee!' he cried triumphantly. He staggered to\nhis feet, still holding her hand.\n\n'Thou shalt come to Paris. Sha't be lodged like a Princess. Sha't see\ngreat sights.'\n\nShe sprang up, tearing herself from him.\n\n'Get thee gone from here,' she shivered. 'I am done with starving with\nthee. I know thy apple orchard wooings. Get thee gone from here. It is\nlate. I shall be shamed if a man be seen to leave my room so late.'\n\n'Why, I would not have thee shamed, Kat,' he muttered, her strenuous\ntone making him docile as a child.\n\n'Get thee gone,' she answered, panting. 'I will not starve.'\n\n'Wilt not come with me?' he asked ruefully. 'Thou didst yield in my\narms.'\n\n'I do bid thee begone,' she answered imperiously. 'Get thee gold if\nthou would'st have me. I have starved too much with thee.'\n\n'Why, I will go,' he muttered. 'Buss me. For I depart towards Dover\nto-night, else this springald cardinal will be gone from Paris ere I\ncome.'\n\n\nIV\n\n'Men shall make us cry, in the end, steel our hearts how we will,' she\nsaid to Margot Poins, who found her weeping with her head down upon\nthe table above a piece of paper.\n\n'I would weep for no man,' Margot answered.\n\nLarge, florid, fair, and slow speaking, she gave way to one of her\nimpulses of daring that covered her afterwards with immense blushes\nand left her buried in speechless confusion. 'I could never weep for\nsuch an oaf as your cousin. He beats good men.'\n\n'Once he sold a farm to buy me a gown,' Katharine said, 'and he goes\nto a sure death if I may not stay him.'\n\n'It is even the province of men--to die,' Margot answered. Her voice,\ngruff with emotion, astonished herself. She covered her mouth with the\nback of her great white hand as if she wished to wipe the word away.\n\n'Beseech you, spoil not your eyes with sitting to write at this hour\nfor the sake of this roaring boy.'\n\nKatharine sat to the table: a gentle knocking came at the door. 'Let\nno one come, I have told the serving knave as much.' She sank into a\npondering over the wording of her letter to Bishop Gardiner. It was\nnot to be thought of that her cousin should murder a Prince of the\nChurch; therefore the bishop must warn the Catholics in Paris that\nCromwell had this in mind. And Bishop Gardiner must stay her cousin on\nhis journey: by a false message if needs were. It would be an easy\nmatter to send him such a message as that she lay dying and must see\nhim, or anything that should delay him until this cardinal had left\nParis.\n\nThe great maid behind her back was fetching from the clothes-prop a\nwaterglobe upon its stand; she set it down on the table before the\nrush-light, moving on tiptoe, for to her the writing of a letter was a\nsort of necromancy, and she was distressed for Katharine's sake. She\nhad heard that to write at night would make a woman blind before\nthirty. The light grew immense behind the globe; watery rays flickered\nbroad upon the ceiling and on the hangings, and the paper shone with a\nmellow radiance. The gentle knocking was repeated, and Katharine\nfrowned. For before she was half way through with the humble words of\ngreeting to the bishop it had come to her that this was a very\ndangerous matter to meddle in, and she had no one by whom to send the\nletter. Margot could not go, for it was perilous for her maid to be\nseen near the bishop's quarters with all Cromwell's men spying about.\n\nBehind her was the pleasant and authoritative voice of old Sir\nNicholas Rochford talking to Margot Poins. Katharine caught the name\nof Cicely Elliott, the dark maid of honour who had flouted her a week\nago, and had pinned up her sleeve that day in Privy Seal's house.\n\nThe old man stood, grey and sturdy, his hand upon her doorpost. His\npleasant keen eyes blinked upon her in the strong light from her globe\nas if he were before a good fire.\n\n'Why, you are as fair as a saint with a halo, in front of that\njigamaree,' he said. 'I am sent to offer you the friendship of Cicely\nElliott.' When he moved, the golden collar of his knighthood shone\nupon his chest; his cropped grey beard glistened on his chin, and he\nshaded his eyes with his hand.\n\n'I was writing of a letter,' Katharine said. She turned her face\ntowards him: the stray rays from the globe outlined her red curved\nlips, her swelling chest, her low forehead; and it shone like the moon\nrising over a hill, yellow and fiery in the hair above her brow. The\nlines of her face drooped with her perplexities, and her eyes were\nlarge and shadowed, because she had been shedding many tears.\n\n'Cicely Elliott shall make you a good friend,' he said, with a modest\npride of his property; 'she shall marry me, therefore I do her such\nservices.'\n\n'You are old for her,' Katharine said.\n\nHe laughed.\n\n'Since I have neither chick nor child and am main rich for a subject.'\n\n'Why, she is happy in her servant,' Katharine said abstractedly. 'You\nare a very famous knight.'\n\n'There are ballads of me,' he answered complacently. 'I pray to die in\na good tulzie yet.'\n\n'If Cicely Elliott have her scarf in your helmet,' Katharine said, 'I\nmay not give you mine.' She was considering of her messenger to the\nbishop. 'Will you do me a service?'\n\n'Why,' he answered, with a gentle mockery, 'you have one tricksy\nswordsman to bear your goodly colours.'\n\nKatharine turned clean about to him and looked at him with attention,\nto make out whether he might be such a man as would carry her letter\nfor her.\n\nHe returned her gaze directly, for he was proud of himself and of his\nfame. He had fought in all the wars that a man might fight in since he\nhad been eighteen, and for fifteen years he had been captain of a\ntroop employed by the Council in keeping back the Scots of the\nBorders. It was before Flodden Field that he had done his most famous\ndeed, about which there were many ballads. Being fallen upon by a bevy\nof Scotsmen near a tall hedge, after he had been unhorsed, he had set\nhis back into a thorn bush, and had fought for many hours in the rear\nof the Scottish troop, alone and with only his sword. The ballad that\nhad been made about him said that seventeen corpses lay in front of\nthe bush after the English won through to him. But since Cromwell had\nbroken up the Northern Councils, and filled them again with his own\nmen of no birth, the old man had come away from the Borders,\ndisdaining to serve at the orders of knaves that had been butchers'\nsons and worse. He owned much land and was very wealthy, and, having\nbeen very abstemious, because he came of an old time when knighthood\nhad still some of the sacredness and austerity of a religion, he was a\nman very sound in limb and peaceable of disposition. In his day he had\nbeen esteemed the most graceful whiffler in the world: now he used\nonly the heavy sword, because he was himself grown heavy.\n\nKatharine answered his gentle sneer at her cousin:\n\n'It is true that I have a servant, but he is gone and may not serve\nme.' Yet the knight would find it in the books of chivalry that\ncertain occasions or great quests allowed of a knight's doing the\nerrands of more than one lady: but one lady, as for instance the\ncelebrated Dorinda, might have her claims asserted by an illimitable\nnumber of knights, and she begged him to do her a service.\n\n'I have heard of these Errantry books,' he said. 'In my day there were\nnone such, and now I have no letters.'\n\n'How, then, do you pass the long days of peace,' Katharine asked, 'if\nyou neither drink nor dice?'\n\nHe answered: 'In telling of old tales and teaching their paces to the\nKing's horses.'\n\nHe drew himself up a little. He would have her understand that he was\nnot a horse leech: but there was in these four-footed beasts a certain\nlove for him, so that Richmond, the King's favourite gelding, would\nstand still to be bled if he but laid his hand on the great creature's\nwithers to calm him. These animals he loved, since he grew old and\nmight not follow arguments and disputations of _hic_ and _hoc_. 'There\nwere none such in my day. But a good horse is the same from year's end\nto year's end....'\n\n'Will you carry a letter for me?' Katharine asked.\n\n'I would have you let me show you some of his Highness' beasts,' he\nadded. 'I breed them to the manage myself. You shall find none that\nstep more proudly in Christendom or Heathenasse.'\n\n'Why, I believe you,' she answered. Suddenly she asked: 'You have\nridden as knight errant?'\n\nHe said: 'For three weeks only. Then the Scots came on too thick and\nfast to waste time.' His dark eyes blinked and his broad lips moved\nhumorously with his beard. 'I swore to do service to any lady; pray\nyou let me serve you.'\n\n'You can do me a service,' she said.\n\nHe moved his hand to silence her.\n\n'Pray you take it not amiss. But there is one that hates you.'\n\nShe said:\n\n'Perhaps there are a many; but do me a service if you will.'\n\n'Look you,' he said, 'these times are no times of mine. But I know it\nis prudent to have servitors that love one. I saw yours shake a fist\nat your door.'\n\nKatharine said:\n\n'A man?' She looked at Margot, who, big, silent and flushed, was\ndevouring the celebrated hero of ballads with adoring eyes. He\nlaughed.\n\n'That maid would kiss your feet. But, in these days, it is well to\nmake friends with them that keep doors. The fellow at yours would spit\nupon you if he dared.'\n\nKatharine said carelessly:\n\n'Let him even spit in his imagination, and I shall whip him.'\n\nThe old knight looked out of the door. He left it wide open, so that\nno man might listen.\n\n'Why, he is still gone,' he said. He cleared his throat. 'See you,' he\nbegan. 'So I should have said in the old days. These fellows then we\ncould slush open to bathe our feet in their warm blood when we came\ntired-foot from hunting. Now it is otherwise. Such a loon may be a spy\nset upon one.'\n\nHe turned stiffly and majestically to move back her new hangings that\nonly that day, in her absence at Privy Seal's, had been set in place.\nHe tapped spots in the wall with his broad and gentle fingers, talking\nall the time with his broad back to her.\n\n'See you, you have had here workmen to hang you a new arras. There be\ntricks of boring ear-holes through walls in hanging these things. So\nthat if you have a cousin who shall catch a scullion by the\nthroat....'\n\nKatharine said hastily:\n\n'He hath heard little to harm me.'\n\n'It is what a man swears he hath heard that shall harm one,' the old\nknight answered. 'I meddle in no matters of statecraft, but I am sent\nto you by certain ladies; one shall wed me and I am her servant; one\nbears my name and wedded a good cousin of mine, now dead for his\ntreasons.'\n\nKatharine said:\n\n'I am beholden to Cicely Elliott and the Lady Rochford....'\n\nHe silenced her with one of his small gestures of old-fashioned\ndignity and distinction.\n\n'I meddle in none of these matters,' he said again. 'But these ladies\nknow that you hate one they hate.'\n\nHe said suddenly, 'Ah!' a little grunt of satisfaction. His fingers\ntapping gently made what seemed a stone of the wall quiver and let\ndrop small flakes of plaster. He turned gravely upon Katharine:\n\n'I do not ask what you spoke of with that worshipful swordsman,' he\nsaid. 'But your servitor is gone to tell upon you. A stone is gone\nfrom here and there is his ear-hole, like a drum of canvas.'\n\nKatharine said swiftly:\n\n'Take, then, a letter for me--to the Bishop of Winchester!'\n\nHe started back with a little exaggerated pantomime of horror.\n\n'Must I go into your plots?' he asked, blinking and amused, as if he\nhad expected the errand.\n\nShe said urgently:\n\n'I would have you tell me what Englishman now wears a red hat and is\nlike to be in Paris. I am very ignorant in these matters.'\n\n'Then meddle not in them,' he said, 'for that man is even Cardinal\nPole; one that the King's Highness would very willingly know to be\ndead.'\n\n'God forbid that my cousin should murder a Prince of the Church, and\nbe slain in that quarrel,' she answered.\n\nHe started back and held his hands over his head.\n\n'Why, God help you, child! Is that your errand?' he said, deep from\nhis chest. 'I meddle not in this matter.'\n\nShe answered obstinately:\n\n'Pray you--by your early vows--consent to carry me my letter.'\n\nHe shook his head bodingly.\n\n'I thought it had been a matter of a masque at the Bishop of\nWinchester's; or I had never come nigh you. Cicely Elliott hath copied\nout the part you should speak. Pray you ask me no more of the other\nerrand.'\n\nShe said:\n\n'For a great knight you are a friend only in little matters!'\n\nHe uttered reproachfully:\n\n'Child: it is no little matter to act as go-between for the Bishop of\nWinchester, even if it be for no more than a masque. How otherwise\ndoes he not send to you direct? So much I was ready to do for you, a\nstranger, who am a man that has no party.'\n\nShe uttered maliciously:\n\n'Well, well. I thought you came of the better times before our day.'\n\n'I have shewn myself a good enough man,' he said composedly. He\npointed one of his fingers at her.\n\n'Pole is not one that shall be easily slain. He is like to have in his\npay the defter spadassins of the two. I have known him since he was a\nchild till when he fled abroad.'\n\n'But my cousin!' Katharine pleaded.\n\n'For the sake of your own little neck, let that gallant be hanged,' he\nsaid smartly. 'You have need of many friends; I can see it in your\ncomplexion, which is of a hasty loyalty. But I tell you, I had never\ncome near you, so your cousin miscalled me, a man of worth and credit,\nhad these ladies not prayed me to come to you.'\n\nShe raised herself to her full height.\n\n'It is not in the books of your knight-errantry,' she cried, 'that one\nshould leave one's friends to the hangman of Paris.'\n\nThe large figure of Margot Poins thrust itself upon them.\n\n'A' God's name,' said her gruff voice of great emotion, 'hear the\nwords of this valiant soldier. Your cousin shall ruin you. It is true\nthat he will drive from you all your good friends....' She faltered,\nand her impulse carried her no further. Rochford tapped her flushed\ncheek gently with his glove, but a light and hushing step in the\ncorridor made them all silent.\n\nThe Magister Udal stood before the door blinking his eyes at the\nlight; Katharine addressed him imperiously--\n\n'You will carry a letter for me to save my cousin from death.'\n\nHe started, and leered at Margot, who was ready to sink into the\nground.\n\n'Why, I had rather carry a bull to the temple of Jupiter, as Macrobius\nhas it,' he said, 'meaning that....'\n\n'Yet you have drunk with him,' Katharine interrupted him hotly, 'you\nhave gone hurling through the night with him. You have shamed me\ntogether.'\n\n'Yet I cannot forget Tully,' he answered sardonically, 'who warns me\nthat a prudent man should be able to moderate the course of his\nfriendship, even as he reins his horse. _Est prudentis sustinere ut\ncursum_....'\n\n'Mark you that!' the old knight said to Katharine. 'I will get my boy\nto read to me out of Tully, for that is excellent wisdom.'\n\n'God help me, this is Christendom!' Katharine said, bitterly. 'Shall\none abandon one that lay in the same cradle with one?'\n\n'Your ladyship hath borne with him a day too long,' Udal said. 'He\nbeat me like a dog five days since. Have you heard of the city called\nPonceropolis, founded by the King Philip? Your good cousin should be\nruler of that city, for the Great King peopled it with all the\nbrawlers, cut-throats, and roaring boys of his dominions, to be rid of\nthem.' She became aware that he was very angry, for his whisper shook\nlike the neigh of a horse.\n\nThe old knight winked at Margot.\n\n'Why this is a monstrous wise man,' he said, 'who yet speaks some\nsense.'\n\n'In short,' the magister said, 'If you will stick to this man, you\nshall lose me. For I have taken beatings and borne no malice--as in\nthe case of men with whose loves or wives I have prospered better than\nthemselves. But that this man should miscall me and beat me for the\npure frenzy of his mind, causelessly, and for the love of blows! That\nis unbearable. To-night I walk for the first time after five days\nsince he did beat me. And I ask you whom you shall here find the\nbetter servant?'\n\nHis thin figure was suddenly shaking with rage.\n\n'Why, this is conspiracy!' Katharine cried.\n\n'A conspiracy!' Udal's voice rose up into a shriek. 'If your ladyship\nwere a Queen I would not be a Queen's cousin's whipping post.' His\narms jerked with the spasms of his rage like those of a marionette.\n\n'A shame that learned men should be so beaten!' Margot's gruff voice\nuttered.\n\nKatharine turned upon her.\n\n'That is what made you speak e'ennow. You have been with this\nflibbertigibbet.'\n\n'This is a free land,' the girl mumbled, her mild eyes sparkling with\nthe contagious anger of her lover.\n\nThe old knight stood blinking upon Katharine.\n\n'You are like to lose all your servants in this quarrel,' he said.\n\nKatharine wrung her hands, and then turned her back upon them and\ndrummed upon the table with her fingers. Udal caught Margot's large\nhand and fumbled it beneath the furs of his robe: the old knight kept\nhis smiling eyes upon Katharine's back. Her voice came at last:\n\n'Why, I will not have Tom killed upon this occasion into which I\nbrought him.'\n\nRochford shrugged his shoulders up to his ears.\n\n'Oh marvellous infatuation,' he said.\n\nKatharine spoke, still with her back turned and her shoulders heaving:\n\n'A marvellous infatuation!' she said, her voice coming softly and\ndeeply in her chest. 'Why, after his fashion this man loved me. God\nhelp us, what other men have I seen here that would strike a straight\nblow? Here it is moving in the dark, listening at pierced walls,\nswearing of false treasons----'\n\nShe swept round upon the old man, her face moved, her eyes tender and\nangry. She stretched out her hand, and her voice was pitiful and\nurgent.\n\n'Sir! Sir! What counsel do you give me, who are a knight of honour?\nWould you let a man who lay in the cradle with you go to a shameful\ndeath in an errand you had made for him?'\n\nShe leaned back upon the table with her eyes upon his face. 'No you\nwould not. How then could you give me such counsel?'\n\nHe said: 'Well, well. You are in the right.'\n\n'Nearly I went with him to another place,' she answered, 'but half an\nhour ago. Would to God I had! for here it is all treacheries.'\n\n'Write your letter, child,' he answered. 'You shall give it to Cicely\nElliott to-morrow in the morning. I will have it conveyed, but I will\nnot be seen to handle it, for I am too young to be hanged.'\n\n'Why, God help you, knight,' Udal whispered urgently from the doorway,\n'carry no letter in this affair--if you escape, assuredly this mad\npupil of mine shall die. For the King----?' Suddenly he raised his\nvoice to a high nasal drawl that rang out like a jackdaw's: 'That is\nvery true; and, in this matter of Death you may read in Socrates'\nApology. Nevertheless we may believe that if Death be a transmigration\nfrom one place into another, there is certainly amendment in going\nwhither so many great men have already passed, and to be subtracted\nfrom the way of so many judges that be iniquitous and corrupt.'\n\n'Why, what a plague....' Katharine began.\n\nHe interrupted her quickly.\n\n'Here is your serving man back at last if you would rate him for\nleaving your door unkept.'\n\nThe man stood in the doorway, his lanthorn dangling in his hand, his\ncudgel stuck through his belt, his shock of hair rough like an old\nthatch, and his eyes upon the ground. He mumbled, feeling at his\nthroat:\n\n'A man must eat. I was gone to my supper.'\n\n'You are like to have the nightmare, friend,' the old knight said\npleasantly. 'It is ill to eat when most of the world sleeps.'\n\n\nV\n\nCicely Elliott had indeed sent her old knight to Katharine with those\novertures of friendship. Careless, dark, and a madcap, she had flown\nat Katharine because she had believed her a creature of Cromwell's,\nset to spy upon the Lady Mary's maids. They formed, the seven of them,\na little, mutinous, babbling circle. Their lady's cause they adored,\nfor it was that of an Old Faith, such as women will not let die. The\nLady Mary treated them with a hard indifference: it was all one to her\nwhether they loved her or not; so they babbled, and told evil tales of\nthe other side. The Lady Rochford could do little to hold them, for,\nhaving come very near death when the Queen Anne fell, she had been\ntimid ever since, and Cicely Elliott was their ringleader.\n\nThus it was to her that one of Gardiner's priests had come begging her\nto deliver to Katharine a copy of the words she was to speak in the\nmasque, and from the priest Cicely had learnt that Katharine loved the\nOld Faith and hated Privy Seal as much as any of them. She had been\nstruck with a quick remorse, and had suddenly seen Katharine as one\nthat must be helped and made amends to. Thus she had pinned up her\nsleeve at Privy Seal's. There, however, it had not been safe to speak\nwith her.\n\n'Dear child,' she said to Katharine next morning, 'we may well be\nfoils one to another, for I am dark and pert, like a pynot. They call\nme Mag Pie here. You shall be Jenny Dove of the Sun. But I am not\nafraid of your looks. Men that like the touch of the sloe in me shall\nnever be drawn away by your sweet lips.'\n\nShe was, indeed, like a magpie, never still for a minute, fingering\nKatharine's hair, lifting the medallion upon her chest, poking her\ndark eyes close to the embroidery on her stomacher. She had a trick of\nstanding with her side face to you, so that her body seemed very long\nto her hips, and her dark eyes looked at you askance and roguish,\nwhilst her lips puckered to a smile, a little on one side.\n\n'It was not your old knight called me Sweetlips,' Katharine said. 'I\nmiscalled him foully last night.'\n\nCicely Elliott threw back her head and laughed.\n\n'Why, he is worshipful heavy to send on a message; but you may trust\nhis advice when he gives it.'\n\n'I am come to think the same,' Katharine said; 'yet in this one matter\nI cannot take it.'\n\nCicely Elliott had taken to herself the largest and highest of the\nrooms set apart for these maids. The tapestries, which were her own,\nwere worked in fair reds and greens, like flowers. She had a great\nsilver mirror and many glass vases, in which were set flowers worked\nin silver and enamel, and a large, thin box carved out of an\nelephant's tusk, to hold her pins; and all these were presents from\nthe old knight.\n\n'Why,' she said, 'sometimes his advice shall fit a woman's mood;\nsometimes he goes astray, as in the case of these gloves. Cheverel is\na skin that will stretch so that after one wearing you may not tell\nthe thumbs from stocking-feet. Nevertheless, I would be rid of your\ncousin.'\n\n'Not in this quarrel,' Katharine answered. 'Find him an honourable\nerrand, and he shall go to Kathay.'\n\nCicely threw the stretched cheverel glove into the fire.\n\n'My knight shall give me a dozen pairs of silk, stitched with gold to\nstiffen them,' she said. 'You shall have six; but send your cousin in\nquest of the Islands of the Blest. They lie well out in the Western\nOcean. If you can make him mislay his compass he will never come back\nto you.'\n\nKatharine laughed.\n\n'I think he would come without compass or chart. Nevertheless, I will\nsend me my letter by means of your knight to Bishop Gardiner.'\n\nCicely Elliott hung her head on her chest.\n\n'I do not ask its contents, but you may give it me.'\n\nKatharine brought it out from the bosom of her dress, and the dark\ngirl passed it up her sleeve.\n\n'This shall no doubt ruin you,' she said. 'But get you to our\nmistress. I will carry your letter.'\n\nKatharine started back.\n\n'You!' she said. 'It was Sir Nicholas should have it conveyed.'\n\n'That poor, silly old man shall not be hanged in this matter,' Cicely\nanswered. 'It is all one to me. If Crummock would have had my head he\ncould have shortened me by that much a year ago.'\n\nKatharine's eyes dilated proudly.\n\n'Give me my letter,' she said; 'I will have no woman in trouble for\nme.'\n\nThe dark girl laughed at her.\n\n'Your letter is in my sleeve. No hands shall touch it before mine\ndeliver it to him it is written to. Get you to our mistress. I thank\nyou for an errand I may laugh over; laughter here is not over\nmirthful.'\n\nShe stood side face to Katharine, her mouth puckered up into her\nsmile, her eyes roguish, her hands clasped behind her back.\n\n'Why, you see Cicely Elliott,' she said, 'whose folk all died after\nthe Marquis of Exeter's rising, who has neither kith nor kin, nor\nhouse nor home. I had a man loved me passing well. He is dead with the\nrest; so I pass my time in pranks because the hours are heavy. To-day\nthe prank is on thy side; take it as a gift the gods send, for\nto-morrow I may play thee one, since thou art soft, and fair, and\ntender. That is why they call me here the Magpie. My old knight will\ntell you I have tweaked his nose now and again, but I will not have\nhim shortened by the head for thy sake.'\n\n'Why, you are very bitter,' Katharine said.\n\nThe girl answered, 'If your head ached as mine does now and again when\nI remember my men who are dead; if your head ached as mine does....'\nShe stopped and gave a peal of laughter. 'Why, child, your face is\nlike a startled moon. You have not stayed days enough here to have met\nmany like me; but if you tarry here for long you will laugh much as I\nlaugh, or you will have grown blind long since with weeping.'\n\nKatharine said, 'Poor child, poor child!'\n\nBut the girl cried out, 'Get you gone, I say! In the Lady Mary's room\nyou shall find my old knight babbling with the maidens. Send him to\nme, for my head aches scurvily, and he shall dip his handkerchief in\nvinegar and set it upon my forehead.'\n\n'Let me comb thy hair,' Katharine said; 'my hand is sovereign against\na headache.'\n\n'No, get you gone,' the girl said harshly; 'I will have men of war to\ndo these errands for me.'\n\nKatharine answered, 'Sit thee down. Thou wilt take my letter; I must\nease thy pains.'\n\n'As like as not I shall scratch thy pink face,' Cicely said. 'At these\ntimes I cannot bear the touch of a woman. It was a woman made my\nfather run with the Marquis of Exeter.'\n\n'Sweetheart,' Katharine said softly, 'I could hold both thy wrists\nwith my two fingers. I am stronger than most men.'\n\n'Why, no!' the girl cried; 'I may not sit still. Get you gone. I will\nrun upon your errand. If you had knelt to as many men as I have you\ncould not sit still either. And not one of my men was pardoned.'\n\nShe ran from the room with a sidelong step like a magpie's, and her\nlaugh rang out discordantly from the corridor.\n\nThe Lady Mary sat reading her Plautus in her large painted gallery,\nwith all her maids about her sewing, some at a dress for her, some\nwinding silk for their own uses. The old knight stood holding his\nsturdy hands apart between a rope of wool that his namesake Lady\nRochford was making into balls. Other gentlemen were beside some of\nthe maids, toying with their silks or whispering in their ears. No one\nmuch marked Katharine Howard.\n\nShe glided to her lady and kissed the dry hand that lay in the lap\nmotionless. Mary raised her eyes from her book, looked for a leisurely\ntime at the girl's face, and then began again to read. Old Rochford\nwinked pleasantly at her, and, after she had saluted his cousin, he\nbegged her to hold the wool in his stead, for his hands, which were\nused to sword and shield, were very cold, and his legs, inured to the\nsaddle, brooked standing very ill.\n\n'Cicely Elliott hath a headache,' Katharine said; 'she bade me send\nyou to her.'\n\nHe waited before her, helping her to adjust the wool on to her white\nhands, and she uttered, in a low voice:\n\n'She hath taken my letter for me.'\n\nHe said, 'Why, what a' the plague's name ...' and stood fingering his\npeaked little beard in a gentle perplexity.\n\nLady Rochford pulled at her wool and gave a hissing sigh of pain, for\nthe joint of her wrist was swollen.\n\n'It has always been easterly winds in January since the Holy Blood of\nHailes was lost,' she sighed. 'In its day I could get me some ease in\nthe wrist by touching the phial that held it.' She shivered with\ndiscomfort, and smiled distractedly upon Katharine. Her large and\nbuxom face was mild, and she seemed upon the point of shedding tears.\n\n'Why, if you will put your wool round a stool, I will wind it for\nyou,' Katharine said, because the gentle helplessness of the large\nwoman filled her with compassion, as if this were her old, mild\nmother.\n\nLady Rochford shook her head disconsolately.\n\n'Then I must do something else, and my bones would ache more. But I\nwould you would make my cousin Rochford ask the Archbishop where they\nhave hidden the Sacred Blood of Hailes, that I may touch it and be\ncured.'\n\nThe old knight frowned very slightly.\n\n'I have told thee to wrap thy fist in lamb's-wool,' he said. 'A\nhundred times I have told thee. It is very dangerous to meddle with\nthese old saints and phials that are done away with.'\n\nLady Rochford sighed gently and hung her head.\n\n'My cousin Anne, that was a sinful Queen, God rest her soul ...' she\nbegan.\n\nSir Nicholas listened to her no more.\n\n'See you,' he whispered to Katharine. 'Peradventure it is best that\nCicely have gone. Being a madcap, her comings and goings are heeded by\nno man, and it is true that she resorteth daily to the Bishop of\nWinchester, to plague his priests.'\n\n'I would not speak so, being a man,' Katharine said.\n\nHe smiled at her and patted her shoulder.\n\n'Why, I have struck good blows in my time,' he said.\n\n'And have learned worldly wisdom,' Katharine retorted.\n\n'I would not risk my neck on grounds where I am but ill acquainted,'\nhe answered soberly. He was all will to please her. The King, he said,\nwas coming on the Wednesday, after the Bishop of Winchester's, to see\nthree new stallions walk in their manage-steps. 'I pray that you will\ncome with Cicely Elliott to watch from the little window in the\nstables. These great creatures are a noble sight. I bred them myself\nto it.' His mild brown eyes were bright with enthusiasm and\ncordiality.\n\nSuddenly there was a great silence in the room, and the Lady Mary\nraised her head. The burly figure of Throckmorton, the spy, was in the\ndoorway. Katharine shuddered at the sight of him, for, in her\nLincolnshire house, where he was accounted more hateful than Judas who\nbetrayed the Lord, she had seen him beat the nuns when the convents\nhad been turned out of doors, and he had brought to death his own\nbrother, who had had a small estate near her father's house. The smile\nupon his face made her feel sick. He stroked his long, golden-brown\nbeard, glanced swiftly round the room, and advanced to the mistress's\nchair, swinging his great shoulders. He made a leg and pulled off his\ncap, and at that there was a rustle of astonishment, for it had been\nheld treasonable to cap the Lady Mary. Her eyes regarded him fixedly,\nwith a granite cold and hardness, and he seemed to have at once a grin\nof power and a shrinking motion of currying favour. He said that Privy\nSeal begged her leave that her maid Katharine Howard might go to him\nsoon after one o'clock. The Lady Mary neither spoke nor moved, but the\nold knight shrank away from Katharine, and affected to be talking in\nthe ear of Lady Rochford, who went on winding her wool. Throckmorton\nturned on his heels and swung away, his eyes on the floor, but with a\ngrin on his evil face.\n\nHe left a sudden whisper behind him, and then the silence fell once\nmore. Katharine stood, a tall figure, holding out the hands on which\nthe wool was as if she were praying to some invisible deity or\nwelcoming some invisible lover. Some heads were raised to look at her,\nbut they fell again; the old knight shuffled nearer her to whisper\nhoarsely from his moustachioed lips:\n\n'Your serving man hath reported. Pray God we come safe out of this!'\nThen he went out of the room. Lady Rochford sighed deeply, for no\napparent reason.\n\nAfter a time the Lady Mary raised her head and made a minute, cold\nbeckoning to Katharine. Her dry finger pointed to a word in her book\nof Plautus.\n\n'Tell me what you know of this,' she commanded.\n\nThe play was the _Menechmi_, and the phrase ran, '_Nimis autem bene\nora commetavi_....' It was difficult for Katharine to bring her mind\ndown to this text, for she had been wondering if indeed her time were\nat an end before it had begun. She said:\n\n'I have never loved this play very well,' to excuse herself.\n\n'Then you are out of the fashion,' Mary said coldly, 'for this\n_Menechmi_ is prized here above all the rest, and shall be played at\nWinchester's before his Highness.'\n\nKatharine bowed her head submissively, and read the words again.\n\n'I remember me,' she said, 'I had this play in a manuscript where your\n_commetavi_ read _commentavi_.'\n\nMary kept her eyes upon the girl's face, and said:\n\n'Signifying?'\n\n'Why, it signifies,' Katharine said, 'that Messenio did well mark a\nface. If you read _commetavi_ it should mean that he scratched it with\nhis nails so that it resembled a harrowed field; if _commentavi_, that\nhe bethumped it with his fist so that bruises came out like the stops\non a fair writing.'\n\n'It is true that you are a good Latinist,' Mary said\nexpressionlessly. 'Bring me my inkhorn to that window. I will write\ndown your _commentavi_.'\n\nKatharine lifted the inkhorn from its hole in the arm of the chair and\ngracefully followed the stiff and rigid figure into the embrasure of a\ndistant window.\n\nMary bent her head over the book that she held in her hand, and\nwriting in the margin, she uttered:\n\n'Pity that such an excellent Latinist should meddle in matters that\nnothing concern her.'\n\nKatharine held the inkhorn carefully, as if it had been a precious\nvase.\n\n'If you will bid me do naught but serve you, I will do naught else,'\nshe said.\n\n'I will neither bid thee nor aid thee,' Mary answered. 'The Bishop of\nWinchester claims thy service. Serve him as thou wilt.'\n\n'I would serve my mistress in serving him,' Katharine said. 'He is a\nman I love little.'\n\nMary pulled suddenly from her bodice a piece of crumpled parchment\nthat had been torn across. She thrust it into Katharine's free hand.\n\n'Such letters I have had written me by my father's men,' she said. 'If\nthis bishop should come to be my father's man I would take no service\nfrom him.'\n\nKatharine read on the crumpled parchment such words as:\n\n   'Be you dutiful ...\n    I will not protect ...\n    You shall be ruined utterly ...\n    You had better creep underground ...\n    Therefore humble you ...'\n\n'It was Thomas Cromwell wrote that,' the Lady Mary cried. 'My father's\nman!'\n\n'But if this brewer's son be brought down?' Katharine pleaded.\n\n'Why, I tore his letter across for it is filthy,' Mary said, 'and I\nkeep the halves of his letter that I may remember. If he be brought\ndown, who shall bring his master down that let him write so?'\n\nKatharine said:\n\n'If this tempter of the Devil's brood were brought down there should\nensue so great an atonement from his sorrowful master whom he\ndeludes....'\n\nMary uttered a 'Tush!' of scorn and impatience. 'This is the babbling\nof a child. My father is no holy innocent as you and your like feign\nto believe.'\n\n'Nevertheless I love you most well,' Katharine pleaded.\n\nMary snapped her book to. Her cold tone came back over her heat as the\ngrey clouds of a bitter day shut down again upon a dangerous flicker\nof lightning.\n\n'Do as you will,' she said, 'only if your head fall I will stir no\nfinger to aid you. Or, if by these plottings my father could be got to\nsend me his men upon their knees and bearing crowns, I would turn my\nback upon them and say no word.'\n\n'Well, my plottings are like to end full soon,' Katharine said. 'Privy\nSeal hath sent for me upon no pleasant errand.'\n\nMary said: 'God help you!' with a frigid unconcern, and walked back to\nher chair.\n\n\nVI\n\nCromwell kept as a rule his private courts either in his house at\nAustin Friars, or in a larger one that he had near the Rolls. But,\nwhen the King was as far away from London as Greenwich, or when such\nill-wishers as the Duke of Norfolk were in the King's neighbourhood,\nCromwell never slept far out of earshot from the King's rooms. It was\nsaid indeed that never once since he had become the King's man had he\npassed a day without seeing his Highness once at least, or writing him\na great letter. But he contrived continually to send the nobles that\nwere against him upon errands at a distance--as when Bishop Gardiner\nwas made Ambassador to Paris, or Norfolk sent to put down the North\nafter the Pilgrimage of Grace. Such errands served a double purpose:\nGardiner, acting under the pressure of the King, was in Paris forced\nto make enemies of many of his foreign friends; and the Duke, in his\npanic-stricken desire to curry favour with Henry, had done more\nharrying, hanging and burning among the Papists than ever Henry or his\nminister would have dared to command, for in those northern parts the\nKing's writ did not run freely. Thus, in spite of himself the Duke at\nYork had been forced to hold the country whilst creatures of Privy\nSeal, men of the lowest birth and of the highest arrogance, had been\nmade Wardens of the Marches and filled the Councils of the Borders.\nSuch men, with others, like the judges and proctors of the Court of\nAugmentations, which Cromwell had invented to administer the estates\nof the monasteries and escheated lords' lands, with a burgess or two\nfrom the shires in Parliament, many lawyers and some suppliants of\nrank, filled the anterooms of Privy Seal. There was a matter of two\nhundred of them, mostly coming not upon any particular business so\nmuch as that any enemies they had who should hear of their having been\nthere might tremble the more.\n\nCromwell himself was in the room that had the King's and Queen's heads\non the ceiling and the tapestry of Diana hunting. He was speaking with\na great violence to Sir Leonard Ughtred, whose sister-in-law, the\nwidow of Sir Anthony Ughtred, and sister of the Queen Jane, his son\nGregory had married two years before. It was a good match, for it made\nCromwell's son the uncle of the Prince of Wales, but there had been a\ntrouble about their estates ever since.\n\n'Sir,' Cromwell threatened the knight, 'Gregory my son was ever a\nfool. If he be content that you have Hyde Farm that am not I. His wife\nmay twist him to consent, but I will not suffer it.'\n\nUghtred hung his head, which was closely shaved, and fingered his\njewelled belt.\n\n'It is plain justice,' he muttered. 'The farm was ceded to my brother\nafter Hyde Monastery was torn down. It was to my brother, not to my\nbrother's wife, who is now your son's.'\n\nCromwell turned upon the Chancellor of the Augmentations who stood in\nthe shadow of the tall mantelpiece. He was twisting his fingers in his\nthin grey beard that wagged tremulously when he spoke.\n\n'Truly,' he bleated piteously, 'it stands in the register of the\nAugmentations as the worshipful knight says.'\n\nCromwell cried out, in a studied rage: 'I made thee and I made thy\noffice: I will unmake the one and the other if it and thou know no\nbetter law.'\n\n'God help me,' the Chancellor gasped. He shrank again into the shadow\nof the chimney, and his blinking eyes fell upon Cromwell's back with a\nlook of dread and the hatred of a beast that is threatened at the end\nof its hole.\n\n'Sir,' Cromwell frowned darkly upon Ughtred, 'the law stands thus if\nthe Augmentation people know it not. This farm and others were given\nto your late brother upon his marriage, that the sister of the Queen\nmight have a proper state. The Statute of Uses hath here no say.\nUnderstand me: It was the King's to give; it is the King's still.' He\nopened his mouth so wide that he appeared to bellow. 'That farm\nfalleth to the survivor of those two, who is now my son's wife. What\njudge shall gainsay that?' He swayed his body round on his motionless\nand sturdily planted legs, veering upon the Chancellor and the knight\nin turn, as if he challenged them to gainsay him who had been an\nattorney for ten years after he had been a wool merchant.\n\nUghtred shrugged his shoulders heavily, and the Chancellor hastened to\nbleat:\n\n'No judge shall gainsay your lordship. Your lordship hath an excellent\nknowledge of the law.'\n\n'Why hast thou not as good a one?' Cromwell rated him. 'I made thee\nsince I thought thou hadst.' The Chancellor choked in his throat and\nwaved his hands.\n\n'Thus the law is,' Cromwell said to Ughtred. 'And if it were not so\nParliament should pass an Act so to make it. For it is a scandal that\na Queen's sister, an aunt of the Prince that shall be King, should\nlose her lands upon the death of her husband. It savours of treason\nthat you should ask it. I have known men go to the Tower upon less\noccasion.'\n\n'Well, I am a broken man,' Sir Leonard muttered.\n\n'Why, God help you,' Cromwell said. 'Get you gone. The law takes no\naccount of whether a man be broken, but seeketh to do honour to the\nKing's Highness and to render justice.'\n\nViridus and Sadler, who was another of Cromwell's secretaries, had\ncome in whilst Privy Seal had been speaking, and Cromwell turned upon\nthem laughing as the knight went out, his head hanging.\n\n'Here is another broken man,' he said, and they all laughed together.\n\n'Well, he is another very notable swordsman,' Viridus said. 'We might\nwell post him at Milan, lest Pole flee back to Rome that way.'\n\nCromwell turned upon the Chancellor with a bitter contempt.\n\n'Find thou for this knight some monk's lands in Kent. He shall to\nMilan with them for a price.'\n\nViridus laughed.\n\n'Now we shall soon have these broken swordsmen in every town of Italy\nbetween France and Rome. Such a net Pole shall not easily break\nthrough.'\n\n'It were well he were done with soon,' Cromwell said.\n\n'The King shall love us much the more; and it is time.'\n\n'Why, there will in two days be such a clamour of assassins in Paris\nthat he shall soon bolt from there towards Rome,' Viridus answered.\n'It will go hard if he escape all our Italy men. I hold it for certain\nthat Winchester shall have reported to him in Paris that this\nCulpepper is on the road. Will you speak with this Howard wench?'\n\nCromwell knitted his brows in uncertainty.\n\n'It was her cousin that should clamour about this murder in Paris,'\nViridus reminded him.\n\n'Is she without?' Cromwell asked. 'Have you it for certain that she\nhath reported to my lord of Winchester?'\n\n'Winchester's priest of the bedchamber hath shewn me a copy of the\nletter she wrote. I would have your lordship send some reward to that\nFather Michael. He hath served us in many other matters.'\n\nCromwell motioned with his hand that Sadler should note down this\nFather Michael's name.\n\n'Are there many men in my antechambers?' he asked Viridus, and hearing\nthat there were more than one hundred and fifty: 'Why, let this wench\nstay there a half-hour. It humbles a woman to be alone among so many\nmen, and she shall come here without a sound clout to her back for the\ncrush of them.'\n\nHe began talking with Sadler about two globes of the world that he had\nordered his agent to buy in Antwerp, one for himself and the other for\na present to the King. Sadler answered that the price was very high; a\nthousand crowns or so, he had forgotten just how many. They had been\ntwelve years in the making, but the agent had been afraid of the\ngreatness of the expense.\n\nCromwell said:\n\n'Tush; I must have the best of these Flemish furnishings.'\n\nHe signed to Viridus to send for Katharine Howard, and went on talking\nwith Sadler about the furnishing of his house in the Austin Friars. He\nhad his agents all over Flanders watching the noted masters of the\ncrafts to see what notable pieces they might turn out; for he loved\nfine carvings, noble hangings, great worked chests and other signs of\nwealth, and the money was never thrown away, for the wood and the\nstuffs and the gold thread remained so long as you kept the moth and\nthe woodlouse from them. To the King too he gave presents every day.\n\nKatharine entered by a door from a corridor at which he had not\nexpected her. She wore a great head-dress of net like the Queen's and\nher dress was in no disarray, neither were her cheeks flushed by\nanything more than apprehension. She said that she had been shown\nthat way by a large gentleman with a great beard. She would not bring\nherself to mention the name of Throckmorton, so much she detested him.\n\nCromwell answered with a benevolent smile, 'Aye, Throckmorton had ever\nan eye for beauty. Otherwise you had come scurvily out of that wash.'\n\nHe twisted his mouth up as if he were mocking her, and asked her\nsuddenly how the Lady Mary corresponded with her cousin the Emperor,\nfor it was certain she had a means of writing to him?\n\nKatharine flushed all over her face with relief and her heart stilled\nitself a little. Here at least there was no talk of the Tower at once\nfor her, because she had written a letter to Bishop Gardiner. She\nanswered that that day for the first time she had been in the Lady\nMary's service.\n\nHe smiled benevolently still, and holding out a hand in a little\nwarning gesture and with an air of pleasant reasonableness, said that\nshe must earn her bread like other folks in his Highness' service.\n\n'Why,' she answered, 'I have been marvellous ill, but I shall be more\ndiligent in serving my mistress.'\n\nHe marked a distinction, pointing a fat finger at her heart-place. In\nthe serving of her mistress she should do not enough work to pay for\nbodkins nor for sewing silk, since the Lady Mary asked nothing of her\nmaids, neither their attendance, their converse, nor yet their\nneedlework. Such a place asked nothing of one so fortunate as to fill\nit. To atone for it the service of the King demanded her labours.\n\n'Why,' she said again, 'if I must spy in those parts it is a great\npity that I ever came there as your woman; for who there shall open\ntheir hearts to me?'\n\nHe laughed at her comfortably still.\n\n'You may put it about that you hate me,' he said. 'You may mix with\nthem that love me not. In the end you may worm yourself into their\nsecrets.'\n\nAgain a heavy flush covered Katharine's face from the chin to the\nbrow. It was so difficult for her to keep from speaking her mind with\nher lips that she felt as if her whole face must be telling the truth\nto him. But he continued to shake his plump sides as if he were\nuttering inaudible, 'Ho--ho--ho's.'\n\n'That is so easy,' he said. 'A child, I think, could compass it.' He\nput his hands behind his back and stretched his legs apart. She was\nvery pleasant to look at with her flushings, and it amused him to toy\nwith frightened women. 'It is in this way that you shall earn his\nHighness' bread.' It was known that Mary had this treasonable\ncorrespondence with the Emperor; in the devilish malignancy of her\nheart she desired that her sacred father should be cast down and\nslain, and continually she implored her cousin to invade her father's\ndominions, she sending him maps, plans of the new castles in building\nand the names of such as were malevolent within the realm.\n'Therefore,' he finished, 'if you could discover her channels and\nthose channels could then be stopped up, you would indeed both earn\nyour bread and enter into high favour.'\n\nHe began again good-humouredly to give her careful directions as to\nhow she should act; as for instance by offering to make for the\nprinters a fair copy of the Lady Mary's Commentary upon Plautus. By\npretending that certain words were obscure to her, she should find\nopportunities for coming suddenly into the room, and she should afford\nherself excuses for searching among his mistress's papers without\nawakening suspicions.\n\n'Why, my face is too ingenuous,' Katharine said. 'I am not made for\nplaying the spy.'\n\nHe laughed at her.\n\n'That is so much the better,' he said. 'The best spies are those that\nhave open countenances. It needs but a little schooling.'\n\n'I should get me a hang-dog look very soon,' she answered. She paused\nfor a minute and then spoke earnestly, holding out her hands. 'I would\nyou would set me a nobler task. Very surely it is shameful that a\ndaughter should so hate the father that begat her; and I know the\nangels weep to see her desire that the great and noble prince should\nbe cast down and slain by his enemies. But, sir, it were the better\ntask to seek to soften her mind. Such knowledge as I have of goodly\nwriters should aid me rather to persuade her heart towards her father;\nfor I know no texts that should make me skilful as a spy, but I can\ngive you a dozen from Plautus alone that do inculcate a sweet and\ndutiful love from daughter to sire.'\n\nHe leered at her pleasantly.\n\n'Why, you speak sweetly, by the book. If the Lady Mary were a man\nnow....'\n\nThe hitherto silent men laid back their heads to laugh, and the\nChancellor of the Augmentations suddenly rubbed his palms together,\nhissing like an ostler. But, seeing her look became angry and abashed,\nCromwell stopped his sentence and once more held out a finger.\n\n'Why, indeed,' he said, gravely, 'if you could do that you might be\nthe first lady in the land, for neither the King nor I, nor yet all\nnor many have availed there.'\n\nKatharine said:\n\n'Surely there is a way to touch the heart of this noble lady, and by\nlong seeking I may find.'\n\n'Well, you have spoken many words,' Cromwell said. 'This is a great\nmatter. If you shall achieve it, it shall be accounted to you both\nhere and in heaven. But the other task I enjoin upon you.'\n\nShe was making sorrowfully to the door, and he called to her:\n\n'I have found your cousin employment.'\n\nThe sudden mention made her stop as if she had been struck in the\nface, and she held her hand to her side. Her face was distorted with\nfear as she turned to answer:\n\n'Aye. I knew. He hath told me. But I cannot thank you. I would not\nthat my cousin should murder a prince of the Church.' She knew, from\nthe feeling in her heart and the cruel sound of his voice that he had\nthat knowledge already. If he wished to imprison her it could serve\nno turn to fence about that matter, and she steadied herself by\ncatching hold of the tapestry with one hand behind her back. The faces\nof Cromwell's three assistants were upon her, hard, sardonic and\ngrinning.\n\nViridus said, with an air of parade:\n\n'I had told your lordship this lady had flaws in her loyalty.' And the\nChancellor was raising his hands in horror, after the fashion of a\nGreek Chorus. Cromwell, however, grinned still at her.\n\n'When the Queen Katharine died,' he said slowly, 'it was a great\nrelief to this realm. When the late Arch Devil, Pope Clement, died,\nthe King and I were mad with joy. But if all popes and all hostile\nqueens and princes could be stricken with devils and dead to-morrow,\nhis Highness would rather it were Reginald Pole.'\n\nKatharine understood very well that he was setting before her the\nenormity of her offence: she stood still with her lips parted. He went\non rehearsing the crimes of the cardinal: how he had been educated by\nthe King's high bounty: how the King had offered him the Archbishopric\nof York: how he had the rather fled to the Bishop of Rome: how he had\nwritten a book, accusing the King of such crimes and heresies that all\nChristendom had cried out upon his Highness. Even then this Pole was\nin Paris with a bull from the Bishop of Rome calling upon the Emperor\nand the King of France to fall together upon their lord.\n\nKatharine gasped:\n\n'I would well he were dead. But not by my cousin. They should take my\ncousin and slay him.'\n\nCromwell had arranged this scene very carefully: for his power over\nthe King fell away daily, and that day he had had to tell Baumbach,\nthe Saxish ambassador, that there was no longer any hope of the King's\nallying himself with the Schmalkaldner league. Therefore he was the\nmore hot to discover a new Papist treason. The suggestion of Viridus\nthat Katharine might be made either to discover or to invent one had\nfilled him with satisfaction. There was no one who could be more\nbelieved if she could be ground down into swearing away the life of\nher uncle or any other man of high station. And to grind her down thus\nneeded only many threats. He infused gradually more terror into his\nnarrow eyes, and spoke more gravely:\n\n'Neither do I desire the death of this traitor so hotly as doth his\nHighness. For there be these foul lies--and have you not heard the\nancient fool's prophecy that was made over thirty years ago: \"That one\nwith a Red Cap brought up from low degree should rule all the land\nunder the King. (I trow ye know who that was.) And that after much\nmixing the land should by another Red Cap be reconciled or else\nbrought to utter ruin\"?'\n\n'I am new to this place,' Katharine said; 'I never heard that saying.\nGod help me, I wish this man were dead.'\n\nHis voice grew the more deep as he saw that she was the more daunted:\n\n'Aye: and whether the land be reconciled to the Bishop of Rome, or be\nbrought to utter ruin, the one and the other signify the downfall of\nhis Highness.'\n\nThe Chancellor interrupted piously:\n\n'God save us. Whither should we all flee then!'\n\n'It is not,' Viridus commented dryly, 'that his Highness or my lord\nhere do fear a fool prophecy made by a drunken man. But there being\nsuch a prophecy running up and down the land, and such a malignant and\ndevilish Red Cap ranting up and down the world, the hearts of foolish\nsubjects are made to turn.'\n\n'Idiot wench,' the Chancellor suddenly yelped at her, 'ignorant,\nnaughty harlot! You had better have died than have uttered those your\npretty words.'\n\n'Why,' Cromwell said gently, 'I am very sure that now you desire that\nyour cousin should slay this traitor.' He paused, licked his lips and\nheld out a hand. 'Upon your life,' he barked, 'tell no soul this\nsecret.'\n\nThe faces of all the four men were again upon her, sardonic, leering\nand amused, and suddenly she felt that this was not the end of the\nmatter: there was something untrue in this parade of threats. Cromwell\nwas acting: they were all acting parts. Their speeches were all too\nlong, too dryly spoken: they had been rehearsed! This was not the end\nof the matter--and neither her cousin nor Cardinal Pole was here the\nmain point. She wondered for a wild moment if Cromwell, too, like\nGardiner, thought that she had a voice with the King. But Cromwell\nknew as well as she that the King had seen her but once for a minute,\nand he was not a fool like Gardiner to run his nose into a mare's\nnest.\n\n'There is no power upon earth could save you from your doom if through\nyou this matter miscarried,' he said, softly: 'therefore, be you very\ncareful: act as I would have you act: seek out that secret that I\nwould know.'\n\nIt came irresistibly into Katharine's head:\n\n'These men know already very well that I have written to Bishop\nGardiner! This is to hold a halter continuously above my head!' Then,\nat least, they did not mean to do away with her instantly. She dropped\nher eyes upon the ground and stood submissively whilst Privy Seal's\nvoice came cruel and level:\n\n'You are a very fair wench, made for love and such stuff. You are an\nindifferent good Latinist who might offer good counsel. But be you\nvery careful that you come not against me. You should not escape, but\nmay burrow underground sooner than that. Your Aristotle should not\nhelp you, nor Lucretius, nor Lucan, nor Silius Italicus. Diodorus\nSiculus hath no maxim that should help you against me; but, like\nDiodorus the Dialectician, you should die of shame. Seneca shall help\nyou if you but dally with that fool thought who sayeth: \"_Quaeris quo\njaceas post obitum loco? Quo non nata jacent._\" Aye, thou shalt die\nand lie in an unknown grave as thou hadst never been born.'\n\nShe went, her knees trembling half with fear and half with rage, for\nit was impossible to imagine anything more threatening or more\narrogant than his soft, cruel voice, that seemed to sound for long\nafter in her ears, saying, 'I have you at my mercy; see you do as I\nhave bidden you.'\n\nWatching the door that closed upon her, Viridus said, with a negligent\namusement:\n\n'That fool Udal hath set it all about that your lordship designed her\nfor the recreation of his Highness.'\n\n'Why,' Cromwell answered, with his motionless smile of contempt for\nhis fellow men, 'it is well to offer bribes to fools and threats to\nknaves.'\n\nThe Chancellor bleated, with amazed adulation, 'Marvel that your\nlordship should give so much care to such a worthless rag!'\n\n'An I had never put my heart into trifles, I had never stood here,'\nCromwell snarled at him. 'Would that my knaves would ever come to\nlearn that!' He spoke again to Viridus: 'See that this wench come\nnever near his Highness. I like not her complexion.'\n\n'Well, we may clap her up at any moment,' his man answered.\n\n\nVII\n\nThe King came to the revels at the Bishop of Winchester's, for these\ntoo were given in honour of the Queen, and he had altered in his mind\nto let the Emperor and Francis know that he was inclined to weaken in\nhis new alliances. Besides, there was the newest suitor for the hand\nof the Lady Mary, the young Duke Philip of Wittelsbach, who must be\nshown how great were the resources of the land. Young, gay, dark, a\nfamous warrior and a good Catholic, he sat behind the Queen and\nspeaking German of a sort he made her smile at times. The play was the\n_Menechmi_ of Plautus, and Duke Philip interpreted it to her. She\nseemed at times so nearly human that the King, glancing back over his\nshoulder to note whether she disgraced him, could settle down into his\nchair and rest both his back and his misgivings. Seeing the frown\nleave his brow all the courtiers grew glad behind him; Cromwell talked\nwith animation to Baumbach, the ambassador from the Schmalkaldner\nleague, since he had not seen the King so gay for many days, and\nGardiner in his bishop's robes smiled with a black pleasure because\nhis feast was so much more prosperous than Privy Seal's had been.\nThere was no one there of the Lady Mary's household, because it was\nnot seemly that she should be where her suitor was before he had been\npresented to her.\n\nThe large hall was lit with tapers at dusk and hung with ivy and with\nholly; dried woodruff, watermint and other sweet herbs were scattered\nabout the floors to give an agreeable odour; the antlers of deer from\nthe bishop's chase in Winchester were like a forest of dead boughs,\nbranching from the walls, some gilded, some silvered, some supporting\nshields emblazoned with the arms of the See, of the bishop, of the\nKing or of Cleves; an army of wood-pigeons and stock-doves with silver\ncollars about their necks was at one time let fly into the hall, and\nthe swish of their wings and afterwards their cooing among the golden\nrafters of the high ceiling made pleasing sound and mingled with the\nvoices of sweet singing from the galleries at each end of the hall,\nnear the roof. The players spoke their parts bravely, and, because\nthis play was beloved among all others at the Court, there was a great\nand general contentment.\n\nFor the after scene they had a display of theology. There were three\nbattles of men. In black with red hats, horns branching above them and\nin the centre a great devil with a triple tiara, who danced holding up\nan enormous key. These stood on the right. On the left were priests in\nfustian, holding enormous flagons of Rhenish wine and dancing in a\ndrunken measure with their arms round more drunken doxies dressed like\nGerman women. In the centre stood grave and reverend men wearing\nhorsehair beards and the long gowns of English bishops and priests.\nBefore these there knelt an angel in flame-coloured robes with wings\nlike the rainbow. The angel supported a great volume on the back of\nwhich might be read in letters of gold, '_Regis Nostri Sapientia._'\n\nThe great devil, dancing forward, brandishing his key, roared that\nthese reverend men should kneel to him; he held out a cloven foot and\nbade them kiss it. But a venerable bishop cried out, 'You be\nAntichrist. I know you. You be the Arch Devil. But from this book I\nwill confound you. Thank God that we have one that leads us aright.'\nComing forward he read in Latin from the book of the King's Wisdom and\nthe great devil fell back fainting into the arms of the men in red\nhats.\n\nThe King called out, 'By God, goodman Bishop, you have spoken well!'\nand the Court roared.\n\nThen one from the other side danced out, holding his flagon and\ngrasping his fat wife round the waist. He sang in a gross and German\nway, smacking his lips, that these reverend Englishmen should leave\ntheir godly ways and come down among the Lutherans. But the old bishop\ncried out, 'Ay, Dr Martinus, I know thee; thou despisest the Body of\nGod; thou art a fornicator. God forbid that our English priests should\ngo among women as ye do. Listen to wisdom. For, thank God, we have one\nto lead us aright!'\n\nThese words spread a sudden shiver into the hall, for no man there\nknew whether the King had commanded them to be uttered. The King sat\nback in his chair, half frowning; Anne blinked, Philip of Wittelsbach\nlaughed aloud, the Catholic ambassadors, Chapuys and Marillac, who had\nfidgeted in their seats as if they would leave the hall, now leant\nforward.\n\n'Aye,' the player bishop called out, 'our goodly Queen cometh from a\nCourt that was never yet joined to your Schmalkaldners, nor to them\nthat go by your name, Dr Martinus, thou lecher. Here in England you\nshall find no heresies but the pure and purged Word of God.'\n\nChapuys bent an aged white hand behind his ear to miss no word: his\ntrue and smiling face blinked benevolently. Cromwell smiled too,\nlicking his lips dangerously; Baumbach, the Schmalkaldner,\nunderstanding nothing, rolled his German blue eyes in his great head\nlike a pink baby's, and tried to catch the attention of Cromwell, who\ntalked over his shoulder to one of his men. But the many Lutherans\nthat there were in the hall scowled at the floor.\n\nThe player bishop was reading thunderous words of the King, written\nmany years before, against married priests. Henry sat back in his\nround chair, grasping the arms with his enormous hands.\n\n'Why, Master Bishop,' he called out. The player stopped his reading\nand looked at the King, his air of austerity never leaving him. Henry,\nhowever, waved his hand and said no more.\n\nThis dreadful incident caused a confusion in the players: they\nfaltered: the player Lutheran slunk back to his place with his wife,\nand all of them stood with their hands hanging down. They consulted\namong themselves and at last filed out from the room, leaving the\nstage for some empty minutes bare and menacing. Men held their breath:\nthe King was seen to be frowning. But a quick music was played from\nthe galleries and a door opened behind. There came in many figures in\nwhite to symbolify the deities of ancient Greece and Rome, and, in\nblack, with ashes upon her head, there was Ceres lamenting that\nPersephone had been carried into the realms of Pluto. No green thing\nshould blow nor grow upon this earth, she wailed in a deep and full\nvoice, until again her daughter trod there. The other deities covered\ntheir heads with their white skirts.\n\nNo one heeded this show very much in the hall, for the whispers over\nwhat had gone before never subsided again that day. Men turned their\nbacks upon the stage in order to talk with others behind them, and it\nwas generally agreed that if this refurbishing of old doctrines were\nno more than a bold stroke of Bishop Gardiner's, Henry at least had\nnot scowled very harshly upon it. So that, for the most part, they\nthought that the Old Faith might come back again; whilst others\nsuddenly remembered, much more clearly than before, that Cleves was a\nprincipality not truly Lutheran, and that the marriage with Anne had\nnot tied them at all to the Schmalkaldner's league. Therefore this\nshadow of the old ways caused new uneasiness, for there was hardly any\nman there that had not some of the monastery lands.\n\nThe King was the man least moved in the hall: he listened to the\nlamentations of Mother Ceres and gazed at a number of naked boys who\nissued suddenly from the open door. They spread green herbs in a path\nfrom the door to the very feet of Anne, who blinked at them in\namazement, and they paid no heed to Mother Ceres, who asked\nindignantly how any green thing could grow upon the earth that she had\nbidden lie barren till her daughter came again.\n\nPersephone stood framed in the doorway: she was all in white, very\nslim and tall; in among her hair she had a wreath of green Egyptian\nstones called feridets, of which many remained in the treasuries of\nWinchester, because they were soft and of so little value that the\nvisitors of the monasteries had left them there. And she had these\ngreen feridets, cut like leaves, worked into the white lawn, over her\nbreasts. In her left arm there lay a cornucopia filled with gold\ncoins, and in her right a silver coronet of olive leaves. She moved in\na slow measure to the music, bending her knees to right and to left,\nand drawing her long dress into white lines and curves, until she\nstood in the centre of the green path. She smiled patiently and with a\nrapt expression as if she had come out of a dream. The wreath of olive\nleaves, she said, the gods sent to their most virtuous, most beauteous\nQueen, who had brought peace in England; the cornucopia filled with\ngold was the offering of Plutus to the noble and benevolent King of\nthese parts. Her words could hardly be heard for the voices of the\ntheologians in the hall before her.\n\nHenry suddenly turned back, lifted his hand, and shouted:\n\n'Be silent!'\n\nPersephone's voice became very audible in the midst of the terrified\nhush of all these people, who feared their enormous King as if he\nwere a wild beast that at one moment you could play with and the next\nstruck you dead.\n\n'--How happy is England among the nations!' The voice rang out clear\nand fluting like a boy's. 'Her people how free and bold! Her laws how\ngentle and beneficent, her nobles how courteous and sweet in their\ncommunings together for the public weal! How thrice happy that land\nwhen peace is upon the earth! Her women how virtuous, her husbandmen\nhow satiated, her cattle how they let down their milk!'--She swayed\nround to the gods that were uncovering their heads behind her: 'Aye,\nmy masters and fellow godheads: woe is me that we knew never this\nhappy and contented country. Better it had been there to dwell than\nupon high Olympus: better than in the Cyclades: better than in the\nIslands of the Blest that hide amid the Bermoothean tempest. Woe is\nme!' Her expression grew more rapt; she paused as if she had lost the\nthread of the words and then spoke again, gazing far out over the hall\nas jugglers do in performing feats of balancing: 'For surely we had\nbeen more safe than reigning alone above the clouds had we lived here,\nthe veriest hinds, beneath a King that is five times blessed, in that\nhe is most wealthy and generous of rewards, most noble of courage,\nmost eloquent, most learned in the law of men, and most high\ninterpreter of the law of God!'\n\nSeeing that the King smiled, as though he had received a just\npanegyric, a great clamour of applause went up in the hall, and\nswaying beneath the weight of the cornucopia she came to the King over\nthe path of green herbs and boughs. Henry reached out his hands,\nhimself, to take his present, smiling and genial; and that alone was a\nsign of great favour, for by rights she should have knelt with it,\noffered it and then receded, giving it into the arms of a serving man.\nShe passed on, and would have crowned the Queen with the silver\nwreath; but the great hood that Anne wore stood in the way, therefore\nshe laid it in the Queen's lap.\n\nHenry caught at her hanging sleeve.\n\n'That was a gay fine speech,' he said. 'I will have it printed.'\n\nLittle ripples of fear and coldness ran over her, for her dress was\nthin and her arms bared between the loops above. Her eyes roved round\nupon the people as if, tall and white, she were a Christian virgin in\nthe agonies of martyrdom. She tried to pull her sleeve from between\nhis great fingers, and she whispered in a sort of terror:\n\n'You stay the masque!'\n\nHe lay back in his chair, laughing so that his grey beard shook.\n\n'Why, thou art a pert baggage,' he said. 'I could stay their singing\nfor good an I would.'\n\nHe looked her up and down, commanding and good-humouredly malicious.\nShe put her hand to her throat as if it throbbed, and uttered with a\ncalmness of desperation:\n\n'That were great pity. They have practised much, and their breaths are\npassable sweet.'\n\nThe godheads with their beards of tow, their lyres and thunderbolts\nall gilt, stood in an awkward crescent, their music having stopped.\nHenry laughed at them.\n\n'I know thy face,' he said. 'It would be less than a king to forget\nit.'\n\n'I am Katharine Howard,' she faltered, stretching out her hands\nbeseechingly. 'Let me go back to my place.'\n\n'Oh, aye!' he answered. 'But thou'st shed thy rags since I saw thee on\na mule.' He loosed her sleeve. 'Let the good men sing, 'a God's name.'\n\nIn her relief to be free she stumbled on the sweet herbs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a dark night into which they went out from the bishop's palace.\nCressets flared on his river steps, and there were torches down the\nlong garden for those who went away by road. Because there would be a\ngreat crowd of embarkers at the bishop's landing place, so that there\nmight be many hours to wait until their barge should come, Katharine,\nby the office of old Sir Nicholas, had made a compact with some of\nthe maids of honour of the Lady Elizabeth; a barge was to wait for\nthem at the Cross Keys, a common stage some ten minutes down the\nriver. Katharine, laughing, gay with relief and gladdened with words\nof praise, held Margot's hand tight and kept her fingers on Sir\nNicholas' sleeve. It was raining a fine drizzle, so that the air of\nthe gardens smelt moist even against the odour of the torches. The old\nknight pulled the hood of his gown up over his head, for he was hoarse\nwith a heavy cold. It was pitch black beyond the gate house; in the\nopen fields before the wall torches here and there appeared to burn in\nmid-air, showing beneath them the heads and the hoods of their bearers\nhurrying home, and, where they turned to the right along a narrow\nlane, a torch showed far ahead above a crowd packed thick between dark\nhouse-fronts and gables. They glistened with wet and sent down from\ntheir gutters spouts of water that gleamed, catching the light of the\ntorch, like threads of opal fire on the pallid dove colour of the\ntowering house-fronts. The torch went round a corner, its light\nwithdrew along the walls by long jumps as its bearer stepped into the\ndistance ahead. Then it was all black. Walking was difficult over the\nimmense cobbles of the roadway, but in the pack of the crowd it was\nimpossible to fall, for people held one another. But it was also\nimpossible to speak, and, muffling her face in her hood, Katharine\nwalked smiling and squeezing Margot's hand out of pure pleasure with\nthe world that was so fair in the midst of this blackness and this\nheavy cold.\n\nThere was a swishing repeated three times and three thuds and twists\nof white on heads and shoulders just before her. Undistinguishable\nyells of mockery dwindled down from high above, and a rush-light shone\nat an immense elevation illuminating a faint square of casement that\nmight have been in the heavens. Three apprentices had thrown down\npaper bags of powdered chalk. The men who had been struck, and several\nothers who had been maltreated on former nights, or who resented this\ncontinual 'prentice scandal, began a frightful outcry at the door of\nthe house. More bags came bursting down and foul water; the yells and\nbattlecries rolled, in the narrow space under the house-fronts that\nnearly kissed each other high overhead, and the crowd, brought to a\nstandstill, swayed and pushed against the walls. Katharine lost her\nhold of the old knight's sleeve, and she could see no single thing.\nShe felt round her in the blackness for his arm, but a heavy man\nstumbled against her. Suddenly his hand was under her arm, drawing her\na little; his voice seemed to say: 'Down this gully is a way about.'\n\nIn the passage it was blacker than the mouth of hell, and her eyes\nstill seemed to have in them the dazzle of light and triumph she had\njust left. There was a frightful stench of garbage; and it appeared to\nbe a vault, because the outcry of the men besieging the door volleyed\nand echoed the more thunderously. There came the sharp click of a\nlatch and Katharine found herself impelled to descend several steps\ninto a blackness from which came up a breath of closer air and a smell\nof rotting straw. Fear suddenly seized upon her, and the conviction\nthat another man had taken the place of the old knight during the\nscuffle. But a heavy pressure of an arm was suddenly round her waist,\nand she was forced forward. She caught a shriek from Margot; the\ngirl's hand was torn from her own; a door slammed behind, and there\nwas a deep silence in which the heavy breathing of a man became\naudible.\n\n'If you cry out,' a soft voice said, 'I will let you go. But probably\nyou will lose your life.'\n\nShe had not a breath at all in her, but she gasped:\n\n'Will you do a rape?' and fumbled in her pocket for her crucifix. Her\nvoice came back to her, muffled and close, so that she was in a very\nsmall cellar.\n\n'When you have seen my face, you may love me,' came to her ears in an\ninane voice. 'I would you might, for you have a goodly mouth for\nkisses.'\n\nShe breathed heavily; the click of the beads on her cross filled the\nsilence. She fitted the bar of the crucifix to her knuckles and felt\nher breath come calmer. For, if the man struck a light she could\nstrike him in the face with the metal of her cross, held in the fist;\nshe could blind him if she hit an eye. She stepped back a little and\nfelt behind her the damp stone of a wall. The soft voice uttered more\nloudly:\n\n'I offer you a present of great price; I can solve your perplexities.'\nKatharine breathed between her teeth and said nothing. 'But if you\ndraw a knife,' the voice went on, 'I will set you loose; there are as\ngood as Madam Howard.' On the door there came the sound of soft thuds.\n'That is your maid, Margot Poins,' the voice said. 'You had better bid\nher begone. This is a very evil gully; she will be strangled.'\n\nKatharine called:\n\n'Go and fetch some one to break down this door.'\n\nThe voice commented:\n\n'In the City she will find none to enter this gully; it is a sanctuary\nof outlaws.'\n\nThere was the faintest glimmer of a casement square, high up before\nKatharine; violence and carryings off were things familiar to her\nimagination. A hundred men might have desired her whilst she stood on\nhigh in the masque. She said hotly:\n\n'If you will hold me here for a ransom, you will find none to pay it.'\n\nShe heard the soft hiss of a laugh, and the voice:\n\n'I would myself pay more than other men, but I would have no man see\nus together.'\n\nShe shrank into herself, and held to the wall for comfort. She heard a\nclick, and in the light of a shower of brilliant sparks was the\nphantom of a man's beard and dim walls; one tiny red glow remained in\nthe tinder, like an illuminant in a black nothingness. He seemed to\nhold it about breast-high and to pause.\n\n'You had best be rid of Margot Poins,' the musing voice came out of\nthe thick air. 'Send her back to her mother's people: she gets you no\nfriends.'\n\nKatharine wondered if she might strike about eighteen inches above\nthe tiny spark: or if in these impenetrable shadows there were a very\ntall man.\n\n'Your Margot's folk miscall you in shameful terms. I would be your\nservant; but it is distasteful to a proper man to serve one that hath\nabout her an atmosphere of lewdness.'\n\nKatharine cursed at him to relieve the agony of her fear.\n\nThe voice answered composedly:\n\n'One greater than the devil is my master. But it is good hearing that\nyou are loyal to them that serve you: so you shall be loyal to me, for\nI will serve you well.'\n\nThe spark in the tinder moved upwards; the man began to blow on it; in\nthe dim glimmer there appeared red lips, a hairy moustache, a straight\nnose, gleaming eyes that looked across the flame, a high narrow\nforehead, and the gleam of a jewel in a black cap. This glowing and\ndusky face appeared to hang in the air. Katharine shrank with despair\nand loathing: she had seen enough to know the man. She made a swift\nstep towards it, her arm drawn back; but the glow of the box moved to\none side, the ashes faded: there was already nothing before she could\nstrike.\n\n'You see I am Throckmorton: a goodly knight,' the voice said,\nlaughing.\n\nThis man came from Lincolnshire, near her own home. He had been the\nbrother of a gentleman who had a very small property, and he had had\none sister. God alone knew for what crime his father had cursed\nThrockmorton and left his patrimony to the monks at Ely--but his\nsister had hanged herself. Throckmorton had disappeared.\n\nIn that black darkness she had seemed to feel his gloating over her\nhelplessness, and his laughing over all the villainies of his hateful\npast. He was so loathsome to her that merely to be near him had made\nher tremble when, the day before, he had fawned over her and shown her\nthe side door to Privy Seal's room. Now the sound of his breathing\ntook away all her power to breathe. She panted:\n\n'Infamous dog, I will have you shortened by the head for this rape.'\n\n'It is true I am a fool to play cat and mouse,' he answered. 'But I\nwas ever thus from a child: I have played silly pranks: listen to\ngravity. I bring you here because I would speak to you where no ear\ndare come to listen: this is a sanctuary of night robbers.' His voice\ntook on fantastically and grotesquely the nasal tones of Doctors of\nLogic when they discuss abstract theses: 'I am a bold man to dare come\nhere; but some of these are in my pay. Nevertheless I am a bold man,\nthough indeed the step from life into death is so short and so easily\npassed that a man is a fool to fear it. Nevertheless some do fear it;\ntherefore, as men go, I am bold; tho', since I set much store in the\nintervention of the saints on my behalf, may be I am not so bold. Yet\nI am a good man, or the saints would not protect me. On the other\nhand, I am fain to do their work for them: so may be, they would\nprotect me whether I were virtuous or no. Maybe they would not,\nhowever: for it is a point still disputed as to whether a saint might\nuse an evil tool to do good work. But, in short, I am here to tell you\nwhat Privy Seal would have of you.'\n\n'God help the pair of you,' Katharine said. 'Have ye descended to\ncellar work now?'\n\n'Madam Howard,' the voice came, 'for what manner of man do you take\nme? I am a very proper man that do love virtue. There are few such\nphilosophers as I since I came out of Italy.'\n\nIt was certain to her now that Privy Seal, having seen her thick with\nthe Bishop of Winchester, had delivered her into the hands of this\nvulture. 'If you have a knife,' she said, 'put it into me soon. God\nwill look kindly on you and I would pardon you half the crime.' She\nclosed her eyes and began to pray.\n\n'Madam Howard,' he answered, in a lofty tone of aggrievement, 'the\ndoor is on the latch: the latch is at your hand to be found for a\nlittle fumbling: get you gone if you will not trust me.'\n\n'Aye: you have cut-throats without,' Katharine said. She prayed in\nsilence to Mary and the saints to take her into the kingdom of heaven\nwith a short agony here below. Nevertheless, she could not believe\nthat she was to die: for being still young, though death was always\nround her, she believed herself born to be immortal.\n\nThe sweat was cold upon her face; but Throckmorton was upbraiding her\nin a lofty nasal voice.\n\n'I am an honourable knight,' he cried, in his affected and shocked\ntones. 'If I have undone men, it was for love of the republic. I have\nnipped many treasons in the bud. The land is safe for a true man,\nbecause of my work.'\n\n'You are a werewolf,' she shuddered; 'you eat your brother.'\n\n'Why, enough of this talk,' he answered. 'I offer you a service, will\nyou take it? I am the son of a gentleman: I love wisdom for that she\nalone is good. Virtue I love for virtue's sake, and I serve my King.\nWhat more goeth to the making of a proper man? You cannot tell me.'\n\nHis voice changed suddenly:\n\n'If you do hate a villain, now is the time to prove it. Would you have\nhim down? Then tell your gossip Winchester that the time approaches to\nstrike, and that I am ready to serve him. I have done some good work\nfor the King's Highness through Privy Seal. But my nose is a good one.\nI begin to smell out that Privy Seal worketh treasonably.'\n\n'You are a mad fool to think to trick me,' Katharine said. 'Neither\nyou nor I, nor any man, believes that Privy Seal would work a treason.\nYou would trick me into some foolish utterances. It needed not a\ncellar in a cut-throat's gully for that.'\n\n'Madam Spitfire,' his voice answered, 'you are a true woman; I a true\nman. We may walk well together. Before the Most High God I wish you no\nill.'\n\n'Then let me go,' she cried. 'Tell me your lies some other where.'\n\n'The latch is near your hand still,' he said. 'But I will speak to you\nno other where. It is only here in the abode of murder and evil men\nthat in these evil times a man may speak his mind and fear no\nlistener.'\n\nShe felt tremulously for the latch; it gave, and its rattling set her\nheart on the jump. When she pulled the door ajar she heard voices in\nthe distant street. It rushed through her mind that he was set neither\non murder nor unspeakable things. Or, indeed, he had cut-throats\nwaiting to brain her on the top step. She said tremulously:\n\n'Tell me what you will with me in haste!'\n\n'Why, I have bidden your barge fellows wait for you,' he answered.\n'Till cock-crow if need were. They shall not leave you. They fear me\ntoo much. Shut the door again, for you dread me no more.'\n\nHer knees felt suddenly limp and she clung to the latch for support;\nshe believed that Mary had turned the heart of this villain. He\nrepeated that he smelt treason working in the mind of an evil man, and\nthat he would have her tell the Bishop of Winchester.\n\n'I did bring you here, for it is the quickest way. I came to you for I\nsaw that you were neither craven nor fool: nor high placed so that it\nwould be dangerous to be seen talking with you later, when you\nunderstood my good will. And I am drawn towards you since you come\nfrom near my home.'\n\nKatharine said hurriedly, between her prayers:\n\n'What will you of me? No man cometh to a woman without seeking\nsomething from her.'\n\n'Why, I would have you look favourably upon me,' he answered. 'I am a\ngoodly man.'\n\n'I am meat for your masters,' she answered with bitter contempt. 'You\nhave the blood of my kin on your hands.'\n\nHe sighed, half mockingly.\n\n'If you will not give me your favours,' he said in a low, laughing\nvoice, 'I would have you remember me according as my aid is of\nadvantage to you.'\n\n'God help you,' she said; 'I believe now that you have it in mind to\nbetray your master.'\n\n'I am a man that can be very helpful,' he answered, with his laughing\nassurance that had always in it the ring of a sneer. 'Tell Bishop\nGardiner again, that the hour approaches to strike if these cowards\nwill ever strike.'\n\nKatharine felt her pulses beat more slowly.\n\n'Sir,' she said, 'I tell you very plainly that I will not work for the\nadvancement of the Bishop of Winchester. He turned me loose upon the\nstreet to-night after I had served him, with neither guard to my feet\nnor bit to my mouth. If my side goes up, he may go with it, but I love\nhim not.'\n\n'Why, then, devise with the Duke of Norfolk,' he answered after a\npause. 'Gardiner is a black rogue and your uncle a yellow craven; but\nbid them join hands till the time comes for them to cut each other's\nthroats.'\n\n'You are a foul dog to talk thus of noblemen,' she said.\n\nHe answered:\n\n'Oh, la! You have little to thank your uncle for. What do you want?\nWill you play for your own hand? Or will you partner those two against\nthe other?'\n\n'I will never partner with a spy and a villain,' she cried hotly.\n\nHe cried lightly:\n\n'Oh\u00c3\u00a9, Goosetherumfoodle! You will say differently before long. If you\nwill fight in a fight you must have tools. Now you have none, and your\nsituation is very parlous.'\n\n'I stand on my legs, and no man can touch me,' she said hotly.\n\n'But two men can hang you to-morrow,' he answered. 'One man you know;\nthe other is the Sieur Gardiner. Cromwell hath contrived that you\nshould write a treasonable letter; Gardiner holdeth that letter's\nself.'\n\nKatharine braved her own sudden fears with:\n\n'Men are not such villains.'\n\n'They are as occasion makes them,' he answered, with his voice of a\nphilosopher. 'What manner of men these times breed you should know if\nyou be not a fool. It is very certain that Gardiner will hang you,\nwith that letter, if you work not into his goodly hands. See how you\nstand in need of a counsellor. Now you wish you had done otherwise.'\n\nShe said hotly:\n\n'Never. So I would act again to-morrow.'\n\n'Oh fool madam,' he answered. 'Your cousin's province was never to\ncome within a score miles of the cardinal. Being a drunkard and a\nboaster he was sent to Paris to get drunk and to boast.'\n\nThe horror of the blackness, the damp, the foul smell, and all this\ntreachery made her voice faint. She stammered:\n\n'Shew me a light, or let the door be opened. I am sick.'\n\n'Neither,' he answered. 'I am as much as you in peril. With a light\nmen may see in at the casement; with an open door they may come\neavesdropping. When you have been in this world as long as I you will\nlove black night as well.'\n\nHer brain swam for a moment.\n\n'My cousin was never in this plot against me,' she uttered faintly.\n\nHe answered lightly:\n\n'You may keep your faith in that toppet. Where you are a fool is to\nhave believed that Privy Seal, who is a wise man, or Viridus, who is a\nphilosopher after my heart, would have sent such a sot and babbler on\nsuch a tickle errand.'\n\n'He was sent!' protested Katharine.\n\n'Aye, he was sent to blab about it in every tavern in Paris town. He\nwas sent to frighten the Red Cap out of Paris town. He was suffered to\nblab to you that you might set your neck in a noose and be driven to\nbe a spy.'\n\nHis soft chuckle came through the darkness like an obscene applause of\na successful villainy; it was as if he were gloating over her folly\nand the rectitude of her mind.\n\n'Red Cap was working mischief in Paris--but Red Cap is timorous. He\nwill go post haste back to Rome, either because of your letter or\nbecause of your cousin's boasting. But there are real and secret\nmurderers waiting for him in every town in Italy on the road to Rome.\nSome are at Brescia, some at Rimini: at Padua there is a man with his\nneck, like yours, in a noose. It is a goodly contrivance.'\n\n'You are a vile pack,' Katharine said, and once more the smooth and\nunctuous sound came from his invisible throat.\n\n'How shall you decide what is vileness, or where will you find a\nvirtuous man?' he asked. 'Maybe you will find some among the bones of\nyour old Romans. Yet your Seneca, in his day, did play the villain. Or\nmaybe some at the Court of Mahound. I know not, for I was never there.\nBut here is a goodly world, with prizes for them that can take them.\nYet virtue may still flourish, for I have done middling well by\nserving my country. Now I am minded to retire into my lands, to\ncultivate good letters and to pursue virtue. For here about the Courts\nthere are many distractions. The times are evil times. Yet will I do\none good stroke more before I go.'\n\nKatharine said hotly:\n\n'If you go down into Lincolnshire, I will call upon every man there to\nfall upon you and hang you.'\n\n'Why,' he said, 'that is why I did come to you, since you are from\nwhere my lands are. If I serve you, I would have you to smooth my path\nthere. I ask no more, for now I crave rest and a private life. It is\nvery assured that I should never find that here or in few parts of the\nland--so well I have served my King. Therefore, if I serve you, you\nand yours shall cast above my retired farms and my honourable leisure\nthe shadow of your protection. I ask no more.' He chuckled almost\ninaudibly. 'I am set to watch you,' he said. 'Viridus will go to Paris\nto catch another traitor called Brancetor, for the world is full of\ntraitors. Therefore, in a way, it rests with me to hang you.'\n\nHe seemed to be seated upon a cask, for there was a creaking of old\nwood, and he spoke very leisurely.\n\nKatharine said, 'Good night, and God send you better thoughts.'\n\n'Why, stay, and I will be brief,' he pleaded. 'I dally because it is\nsweet talking to a fair woman in a black place.'\n\n'You are easily content, for all the sweet words you get from me,' she\nscorned him.\n\n'See you,' he said earnestly. 'It is true that I am set to watch you.\nI love you because you are fair; I might bend you, since I hold you in\nthe hollow of my hand. But I am a continent man, and there is here a\ngreater stake to be had than any amorous satisfaction. I would save my\ncountry from a man who has been a friend, but is grown a villain.\nListen.'\n\nHe appeared to pause to collect his words together.\n\n'Baumbach, the Saxish ambassador, is here seeking to tack us to the\nSchmalkaldner heresies. Yesterday he was with Privy Seal, who loveth\nthe Lutheran alliance. So Privy Seal takes him to his house, and shows\nhim his marvellous armoury, which is such that no prince nor emperor\nhath elsewhere. So says Privy Seal to Baumbach: \"_I love your\nalliance; but his Highness will naught of it._\" And he fetched a heavy\nsigh.'\n\nKatharine said:\n\n'What is this hearsay to me?'\n\n'He fetched a heavy sigh,' Throckmorton continued. 'And your uncle or\nGardiner knew how heavy a sigh it was their hearts would be very\nglad.'\n\n'This means that the King's Highness is very far from Privy Seal?'\nKatharine asked.\n\n'His Highness hateth to do business with small princelings.'\nThrockmorton seemed to laugh at the King's name. 'His high and\nprincely stomach loveth only to deal with his equals, who are great\nkings. I have seen the letters that have passed about this Cleves\nwedding. Not one of them is from his Highness' hand. It is Privy Seal\nalone that shall bear the weight of the blow when rupture cometh.'\n\n'Well, she is a foul slut,' Katharine said, and her heart was full of\nsympathy for the heavy King.\n\n'Nay, she is none such,' Throckmorton answered. 'If you look upon her\nwith an unjaundiced eye, she will pass for a Christian to be kissed.\nIt is not her body that his Highness hateth, but her fathering. This\nis a very old quarrel betwixt him and Privy Seal. His Highness hath\nbeen wont to see himself the arbiter of the Christian world. Now Privy\nSeal hath made of him an ally of German princelings. His Highness\nloveth the Old Faith and the old royal ways. Now Privy Seal doth seek\nto make him take up the faith of Schmalkaldners, who are a league of\nbakers and unfrocked monks. Madam Howard, I tell you that if there\nwere but one man that could strike after the new Parliament is called\ntogether....'\n\nKatharine cried:\n\n'The very stones that Cromwell hath soaked with blood will rise to\nfall upon him when the King's feet no longer press them down.'\n\nThrockmorton laughed almost inaudibly.\n\n'Norfolk feareth Gardiner for a spy; Gardiner feareth the ambition of\nNorfolk; Bonner would sell them both to Privy Seal for the price of an\narchbishopric. The King himself is loth to strike, since no man in the\nland could get him together such another truckling Parliament as can\nPrivy Seal.'\n\nHe stopped speaking and let his words soak into her in the darkness,\nand after a long pause her voice came back to her.\n\n'It is true that I have heard no man speak as you do.... I can see\nthat his dear Highness must be hatefully inclined to this filthy\nalliance.'\n\n'Why, you are minded to come into my hut with me,' he chuckled. 'There\nare few men so clear in the head as I am. So listen again to me. If\nyou would strike at this man, it is of no avail to meddle with him at\nhome. It shall in no way help you to clamour of good monks done to\ndeath, of honest men ruined, of virgins thrown on to dung-heaps. The\nKing hath had the pence of these good monks, the lands of these honest\nmen, and the golden neck-collars off these virgins.'\n\nShe called out, 'Keep thy tongue off this sacred King's name. I will\nlisten to no more lewdness.'\n\nA torch passing outside sent a moving square of light through the\nhigh grating across the floor of the cellar. The damp walls became\ndimly visible with shining snail-tracks on them, and his great form\nleaning negligently upon a cask, his hand arrested in the pulling of\nhis long beard, his eyes gleaming upon her, sardonic and amused. The\nlight twisted round abruptly and was gone.\n\n'You are monstrous fair,' he said, and sighed. She shuddered.\n\n'No,' his mocking voice came again, 'speak not to the King--not to\nwhomsoever you shall elect to speak to the King--of this man's work at\nhome. The King shall let him go very unwillingly, since no man can so\npack a Parliament to do the King's pleasure. And he hath a nose for\ntreasons that his Highness would give his own nose to possess.'\n\n'Keep thy tongue off the King's name,' she said again.\n\nHe laughed, and continued pensively: 'A very pretty treason might be\nmade up of his speech before his armoury to Baumbach. Mark again how\nit went. Says he: \"_Here are such weaponings as no king, nor prince,\nnor emperor hath in Christendom. And in this country of ours are\ntwenty gentlemen, my friends, have armouries as great or greater._\"\nThen he sighs heavily, and saith: \"_But our King will never join with\nyour Schmalkaldners. Yet I would give my head that he should._\"...\nYour madamship marks that this was said to the ambassador from the\nLutheran league?'\n\n'You cannot twist that into a treason,' Katharine whispered.\n\n'No doubt,' he said reasonably, 'such words from a minister to an\nenvoy are but a courtesy, as one would say, \"_I fain would help you,\nbut my master wills it not._\"'\n\nThe voice suddenly grew crafty. 'But these words, spoken before an\narmoury and the matter of twenty gentlemen with armouries greater. Say\nthat these twenty are creatures of my Lord Cromwell, _implicitur_, for\nthe Lutheran cause. And again, the matter, \"_No king hath such an\narmoury._\"... _No_ king, I would have you observe.'\n\n'Why, this is monstrous foolish pettifogging,' Katharine said. 'No\nking would believe a treason in such words.'\n\n'I call to mind Gilmaw of Hurstleas, near our homes,' the voice came,\nreflectively.\n\n'I did know him,' said Katharine. 'You had his head.'\n\n'You never heard how Privy Seal did that,' the voice came back\nmockingly. 'Goodman Gilmaw had many sheep died of the rot because it\nrained seven weeks on end. So, coming back from a market-day, with too\nmuch ale for prudence and too little for silence, he cried, \"_Curse on\nthis rain! The weather was never good since knaves ruled about the\nKing._\" So that came to the ears of Privy Seal, who made a treason of\nit, and had his sheep, and his house, and his lands, and his head. He\nwas but one in ten thousand that have gone the same road home from\nmarket and made speeches as treasonable.'\n\n'Thus poor Gilmaw died?' Katharine asked. 'What a foul world this is!'\n\n'Time it was cleansed,' he answered.\n\nHe let his words rankle for a time, then he said softly: 'Privy Seal's\nwords before his armoury were as treasonable as Gilmaw's on the market\nroad.'\n\nAgain he paused.\n\n'Privy Seal may call thee to account for such a treason,' he said\nafterwards. 'He holdeth thee in a hollow of his hand.'\n\nShe did not speak.\n\nHe said softly: 'It is a folly to be too proud to fight the world with\nthe world's weapons.'\n\nThe heavy darkness seemed to thrill with her silence. He could tell\nneither whether she were pondering his words nor whether she still\nscorned him. He could not even hear her breathing.\n\n'God help me!' he said at last, in an angry high note, 'I am not such\na man as to be played with too long. People fear me.'\n\nShe kept silence still, and his voice grew high and shrill: 'Madam\nHoward, I can bend you to my will. I have the power to make such a\nreport of you as will hang you to-morrow.'\n\nHer voice came to him expressionlessly--without any inflexion. In few\nwords, what would he have of her? She played his own darkness off\nagainst him, so that he could tell nothing new of her mood.\n\nHe answered swiftly: 'I will that you tell the men you know what I\nhave told you. You are a very little thing; it were no more to me to\ncut you short than to drown a kitten. But my own neck I prize. What I\nhave told you I would have come to the ears of my lord of Winchester.\nI may not be seen to speak with him myself. If you will not tell him,\nanother will; but I would rather it were you.'\n\n'Evil dreams make thy nights hideous!' she cried out so suddenly that\nhis voice choked in his throat. 'Thou art such dirt as I would avoid\nto tread upon; and shall I take thee into my hand?' She was panting\nwith disgust and scorn. 'I have listened to thee; listen thou to me.\nThou art so filthy that if thou couldst make me a queen by the touch\nof a finger, I had rather be a goose-girl and eat grass. If by thy\nforged tales I could cast down Mahound, I had rather be his slave than\nthy accomplice! Could I lift my head if I had joined myself to thee?\nthou Judas to the Fiend. Junius Brutus, when he did lay siege to a\ntown, had a citizen come to him that would play the traitor. He\naccepted his proffered help, and when the town was taken he did flay\nthe betrayer. But thou art so filthy that thou shouldst make me do\nbetter than that noble Roman, for I would flay thee, disdaining to be\naided by thee; and upon thy skin I would write a message to thy master\nsaying that thou wouldst have betrayed him!'\n\nHis laugh rang out discordant and full of black mirth; for a long time\nhis shoulders seemed to shake. He spoke at last quite calmly.\n\n'You will have a very short course in this world,' he said.\n\nA hoarse and hollow shouting reverberated from the gully; the glow of\na torch grew bright in the window-space. Katharine had been upon the\npoint of opening the door, but she paused, fearing to meet some night\nvillains in the gully. Throckmorton was now silent, as if he utterly\ndisdained her, and a frightful blow upon the wood of the door--so\ncertain were they that the torch would pass on--made them spring some\nyards further into the cellar. The splintering blows were repeated;\nthe sound of them was deafening. Glaring light entered suddenly\nthrough a great crack, and the smell of smoke. Then the door fell in\nhalf, one board of it across the steps, the other smashing back to the\nwall upon its hinges. Sparks dripped from the torch, smoke eddied\ndown, and upon the cellar steps were the legs of a man who rested a\ngreat axe upon the ground and panted for breath.\n\n'Up the steps!' he grunted. 'If you ever ran, now run. The guard will\nnot enter here.'\n\nKatharine sped up the steps. It was old Rochford's face that greeted\nhers beneath the torch. He grunted again, 'Run you; I am spent!' and\nsuddenly dashed the torch to the ground.\n\nAt the entry of the tunnel some make of creature caught at her sleeve.\nShe screamed and struck at a gleaming eye with the end of her\ncrucifix. Then nothing held her, and she ran to where, at the mouth of\nthe gully, there were a great many men with torches and swords peering\ninto the darkness of the passage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the barge Margot made an outcry of joy and relief, and the other\nladies uttered civil speeches. The old man, whose fur near the neck\nhad been slashed by a knife-thrust as he came away, explained\npleasantly that he was able to strike good blows still. But he shook\nhis head nevertheless. It was evil, he said, to have such lovers as\nthis new one. Her cousin was bad, but this rapscallion must be worse\nindeed to harbour her in such a place.... Margot, who knew her London,\nhad caught him at the barge, to which he had hurried.\n\n'Aye,' he said, 'I thought you had played me a trick and gone off with\nsome spark. But when I heard to what place, I fetched the guard along\nwith me.... Well for you that it was I, for they had not come for any\nother man, and then you had been stuck in the street. For, see you,\nwhether you would have had me fetch you away or no it is ten to one\nthat a gallant who would take you there would mean that you should\nnever come away alive--and God help you whilst you lived in that\nplace.'\n\nKatharine said:\n\n'Why, I pray God that you may die on the green grass yet, with time\nfor a priest to shrive you. I was taken there against my will.' She\ntold him no more of the truth, for it was not every man's matter, and\nalready she had made up her mind that there was but one man to whom to\nspeak.... She went into the dark end of the barge and prayed until she\ncame to Greenwich, for the fear of the things she had escaped still\nmade her shudder, and in the company of Mary and the saints of\nLincolnshire alone could she feel any calmness. She thought they\nwhispered round her in the night amid the lapping of the water.\n\n\nVIII\n\nThe stables were esteemed the most magnificent that the King had:\nthree times they had been pulled down and again set up after designs\nby Holbein the painter. The buildings formed three sides of a square:\nthe fourth gave into a great paddock, part of the park, in which the\nhorses galloped or the mares ran with their foals. That morning there\nwas a glint of sun in the opalescent clouds: horse-boys in grey with\ndouble roses worked on their chests were spreading sand in the great\nquadrangle, fenced in with white palings, between the buildings where\nthe chargers were trained to the manage. Each wing of the buildings\nwas a quarter of a mile long, of grey stone thatched with rushwork\nthat came from the great beds all along the river and rose into\ncurious peaks like bushes along each gable. On the right were the\nmares, the riding jennets for the women and their saddle rooms; on the\nleft the pack animals, mules for priests and the places for their\nhousings: in the centre, on each side of a vast barn that held the\nprovender, were the stables of the coursers and stallions that the\nKing himself rode or favoured; of these huge beasts there were two\nhundred: each in a cage within the houses--for many were savage\ntearers both of men and of each other. On the door of each cage there\nwas written the name of the horse, as Sir Brian, Sir Bors, or Old\nLeo--and the sign of the constellation under which each was born, the\nmonths in which, in consequence, it was propitious or dangerous to\nride them, and pentagons that should prevent witches, warlocks or evil\nspirits from casting spells upon the great beasts. Their housings and\ntheir stall armour, covered with grease to keep the rust from them,\nhung upon pulleys before each stall, and their polished neck armours\nbranched out from the walls in a long file, waving over the gateways\nright into the distance, the face-pieces with the shining spikes in\nthe foreheads hanging at the ends, the eyeholes carved out and the\nnostril places left vacant, so that they resembled an arcade of the\nskeletons of unicorns' heads.\n\nIt was quiet and warm in the long and light aisles: there was a faint\nsmell of stable hartshorn and the sound of beans being munched\nleisurely. From time to time there came a thunder from distant boxes,\nas two untrained stallions that Privy Seal the day before had given\nthe King kicked against the immense balks of the sliding doors in\ntheir cage-stalls.\n\nThe old knight was flustered because it was many days since the King\nhad deigned to come in the morning, and there were many beasts to show\nhim. In his steel armour, from which his old head stood out benign and\nsilvery, he strutted stiffly from cage to cage, talking softly to his\nhorses and cursing at the harnessers. Cicely Elliott sat on a high\nstool from which she could look out of window and gibed at him as he\npassed.\n\n'Let me grease your potlids, goodly servant. You creak like a\nroasting-jack.' He smiled at her with an engrossed air, and hurried\nhimself to pull tight the headstrap of a great barb that was fighting\nwith four men.\n\nA tucket of trumpets sounded, silvery and thin through the cold grey\nair: a page came running with his sallete-helmet.\n\n'Why, I will lace it for him,' Cicely cried, and ran, pushing away the\nboy. She laced it under the chin and laughed. 'Now you may kiss my\ncheek so that I know what it is to be kissed by a man in potlids!'\n\nHe swung himself, grunting a little, into the high saddle and laughed\nat her with the air of a man very master of himself. The tucket\nthrilled again. Katharine Howard pushed the window open, craning out\nto see the King come: the horse, proud and mincing, appearing in its\ngrey steel as great as an elephant, stepped yet so daintily that all\nits weight of iron made no more sound than the rhythmic jingling of a\nsabre, and man and horse passed like a flash of shadow out of the\ndoor.\n\nCicely hopped back on to the stool and shivered.\n\n'We shall see these two old fellows very well without getting such a\nrheumatism as Lady Rochford's,' and she pulled the window to against\nKatharine's face and laughed at the vacant and far-away eyes that the\ngirl turned upon her. 'You are thinking of the centaurs of the Isles\nof Greece,' she jeered, 'not of my knight and his old fashions of\nironwork and horse dancing. Yet such another will never be again, so\nperfect in the old fashions.'\n\nThe old knight passed the window to the sound of trumpets towards his\ninvisible master, swaying as easily to the gallop of his enormous\nsteel beast as cupids that you may see in friezes ride upon dolphins\ndown the sides of great billows; but Katharine's eyes were upon the\nground.\n\nThe window showed only some yards of sand, of grey sky and of whitened\nrailings; trumpet blew after trumpet, and behind her back horse after\nhorse went out, its iron feet ringing on the bricks of the stable to\ndie into thuds and silence once the door was passed.\n\nCicely Elliott plagued her, tickling her pink ears with a piece of\nstraw and sending out shrieks of laughter, and Katharine, motionless\nas a flower in breathless sunlight, was inwardly trembling. She\nimagined that she must be pale and hollow-eyed enough to excite the\ncompassion of the black-haired girl, for she had not slept at all for\nthinking, and her eyes ached and her hands felt weak, resting upon the\nbrick of the window sill. Horses raced past, shaking the building, in\npairs, in fours, in twelves. They curvetted together, pawed their way\nthrough intricate figures, arched their great necks, or, reined in\nsuddenly at the gallop, cast up the sand in showers and great flakes\nof white foam.\n\nThe old knight came into view, motioning with his lance to invisible\nhorsemen from the other side of the manage, and the top notes of his\nvoice reached them thinly as he shouted the words of direction. But\nthe King was still invisible.\n\nSuddenly Cicely Elliott cried out:\n\n'Why, the old boy hath dropped his lance! _Quel malheur!_'--and indeed\nthe lance lay in the sand, the horse darting wildly aside at the thud\nof its fall. The old man shook his iron fist at the sky, and his face\nwas full of rage and shame in the watery sunlight that penetrated into\nhis open helmet. 'Poor old sinful man!' Cicely said with a note of\nconcern deep in her throat. A knave in grey ran to pick up the lance,\nbut the knight sat, his head hanging on his chest, like one mortally\nstricken riding from a battlefield.\n\nKatharine's heart was in her mouth, and all her limbs were weak\ntogether; a great shoulder in heavy furs, the back of a great cap,\ncame into the view of the window, an immense hand grasped the white\nbalustrade of the manage rails. He was leaning over, a figure all\nsquares, like that on a court-card, only that the embroidered bonnet\nraked abruptly to one side as if it had been thrown on to the square\nhead. Henry was talking to the old knight across the sand. The sight\nwent out of her eyes and her throat uttered indistinguishable words.\nShe heard Cicely Elliott say:\n\n'_What_ will you do? My old knight is upon the point of tears,' and\nKatharine felt herself brushing along the wall of the corridor towards\nthe open door.\n\nThe immense horse with his steel-plates spreading out like skirts from\nits haunches dropped its head motionlessly close to the rail, and the\ngrey, wrinkling steel of the figure on its back caught the reflection\nof the low clouds in flakes of light and shadow.\n\nThe old knight muttered indistinguishable words of shame inside his\nhelmet; the King said: 'Ay, God help us, we all grow old together!'\nand Katharine heard herself cry out:\n\n'Last night you were about very late because evil men plotted against\nme. Any man might drop his lance in the morning....'\n\nHenry moved his head leisurely over his shoulder; his eyelids went up,\nin haughty incredulity, so that the whites showed all round the dark\npupils. He could not turn far enough to see her without moving his\nfeet, and appearing to disdain so much trouble he addressed the old\nman heavily:\n\n'Three times I dropped my pen, writing one letter yesterday,' he said;\n'if you had my troubles you might groan of growing old.'\n\nBut the old man was too shaken with the disgrace to ride any more, and\nHenry added testily:\n\n'I came here for distractions, and you have run me up against old\ncares because the sun shone in your eyes. If you will get tricking it\nwith wenches over night you cannot be fresh in the morning. That is\ngospel for all of us. Get in and disarm. I have had enough of horses\nfor the morning.'\n\nAs if he had dispatched that piece of business he turned, heavily and\nall of one piece, right round upon Katharine. He set his hands into\nhis side and stood with his square feet wide apart:\n\n'It is well that you remember how to kneel,' he laughed, ironically,\nmotioning her to get up before she had reached her knees. 'You are the\npertest baggage I have ever met.'\n\nHe had recognised her whilst the words were coming out of his great\nlips. 'Why, is it you the old fellow should marry? I heard he had\nfound a young filly to frisk it with him.'\n\nKatharine, her face pale and in consternation, stammered that Cicely\nElliott was in the stables. He said:\n\n'Bide there, I will go speak with her. The old fellow is very cast\ndown; we must hearten him. It is true that he groweth old and has been\na good servant.'\n\nHe pulled the dagger that hung from a thin gold chain on his neck into\nits proper place on his chest, squared his shoulders, and swayed\nmajestically into the door of the stable. Katharine heard his voice\nraised to laugh and dropping into his gracious but still peremptory\nardent tones. She remained alone upon the level square of smooth sand.\nNot a soul was in sight, for when the King came to seek distraction\nwith his horses he brought no one that could tease him. She was filled\nwith fears.\n\nHe beckoned her to him with his head, ducking it right down to his\nchest and back again, and the glances of his eyes seemed to strike her\nlike hammer-blows when he came out from the door.\n\n'It was you then that composed that fine speech about the Fortunate\nIsles?' he said. 'I had sent for you this morning. I will have it\nprinted.'\n\nShe wanted to hang her head like a pupil before her master, but she\nneeds must look him in the eyes, and her voice came strangely and\nunearthly to her own ears.\n\n'I could not remember the speech the Bishop of Winchester set me to\nsay. I warned him I have no memory for the Italian, and my fright\nmuddled my wits.'\n\nInternal laughter shook him, and once again he set his feet far apart,\nas if that aided him to look at her.\n\n'Your fright!' he said.\n\n'I am even now so frightened,' she uttered, 'that it is as if another\nspoke with my throat.'\n\nHis great mouth relaxed as if he accepted as his due a piece of\nskilful flattery. Suddenly she sank down upon her knees, her dress\nspreading out beneath her, her hands extended and her red lips parted\nas the beak of a bird opens with terror. He uttered lightly:\n\n'Why, get up. You should kneel so only to your God,' and he touched\nhis cap, with his habitual heavy gesture, at the sacred name.\n\n'I have somewhat to ask,' she whispered.\n\nHe laughed again.\n\n'They are always asking! But get up. I have left my stick in my room.\nHelp me to my door.'\n\nShe felt the heavy weight of his arm upon her shoulder as soon as she\nstood beside him.\n\nHe asked her suddenly what she knew of the Fortunate Islands that she\nhad talked of in her speech.\n\n'They lie far in the Western Ocean; I had an Italian would have built\nme ships to reach them,' he said, and Katharine answered:\n\n'I do take them to be a fable of the ancients, for they had no heaven\nto pray for.'\n\nWhen his eyes were not upon her she was not afraid, and the heavy\nweight of his hand upon her shoulder made her feel firm to bear it.\nBut she groaned inwardly because she had urgent words that must be\nsaid, and she imagined that nothing could be calmer in the Fortunate\nIslands themselves than this to walk and converse about their gracious\nimage that shone down the ages. He said, with a heavy, dull voice:\n\n'I would give no little to be there.'\n\nSuddenly she heard herself say, her heart leaping in her chest:\n\n'I do not like the errand they have sent my cousin upon.'\n\nThe blessed Utopia of the lost islands had stirred in the King all\nsorts of griefs that he would shake off, and all sorts of\nremembrances of youth, of open fields, and a wide world that shall be\nconquered--all the hopes and instincts of happiness, ineffable and\nindestructible, that never die in passionate men. He said dully, his\nthoughts far away:\n\n'What errand have they sent him upon? Who is your goodly cousin?'\n\nShe answered:\n\n'They put it about that he should murder Cardinal Pole,' and she shook\nso much that he was forced to take his hand from her shoulder.\n\nHe leaned upon the manage rail, and halted to rest his leg that pained\nhim.\n\n'It is a good errand enough,' he said.\n\nShe was panting like a bird that you hold in your hand, so that all\nher body shook, and she blurted out:\n\n'I would not that my cousin should murder a Churchman!' and before his\neyebrows could go up in an amazed and haughty stare: 'I am like to be\nhanged between Privy Seal and Winchester.'\n\nHe seemed to fall against the white bar of the rail for support, his\neyes wide with incredulity.\n\nHe said: 'When were women hanged here?'\n\n'Sir,' she said earnestly, 'you are the only one I can speak to. I am\nin great peril from these men.'\n\nHe shook his head at her.\n\n'You have gone mad,' he said gravely. 'What is this fluster?'\n\n'Give me your ear for a minute,' she pleaded. Her fear of him as a man\nseemed to have died down. As a king she had never feared him. 'These\nmen do seek each other's lives, and many are like to be undone between\nthem.'\n\nHis nostrils dilated like those of a high-mettled horse that starts\nback.\n\n'What maggot is this?' he said imperiously. 'Here there is no\ndisunion.'\n\nHe rolled his eyes angrily and breathed short, twisting his hands. It\nwas part of his nature to insist that all the world should believe in\nthe concord of his people. He had walked there to talk with a fair\nwoman. He had imagined that she would pique him with pert speeches.\n\n'Speak quickly,' he said in a peremptory voice, and his eyes wandered\nup the path between the rails and the stable walls. 'You are a pretty\npiece, but I have no time to waste in woeful nonsense.'\n\n'Alas,' she said, 'this is the very truth of the truth. Privy Seal\nhath tricked me.'\n\nHe laughed heavily and incredulously, and he sat right down upon the\nrail. She began to tell him her whole story.\n\nAll through the night she had been thinking over the coil into which\nshe had fallen. It was a matter of desperate haste, for she had\nimagined that Throckmorton would go at once or before dawn and make up\na tale to Privy Seal so that she should be put out of the way. To her\nno counter-plotting was possible. Gardiner she regarded with a young\ndisdain: he was a man who walked in plots. And she did not love him\nbecause he had treated her like a servant after she had walked in his\nmasque. Her uncle Norfolk was a craven who had left her to sink or\nswim. Throckmorton, a werewolf who would defile her if she entered\ninto any compact with him. He would inform against her, with the first\nlight of the morning, and she had trembled in her room at every\nfootstep that passed the door. She had imagined guards coming with\ntheir pikes down to take her. She had trembled in the very stables.\n\nThe King stood above these plots and counter-plots. She imagined him\nbreathing a calmer air that alone was fit for her. To one of her house\nthe King was no more than a man. At home she had regarded him very\nlittle. She had read too many chronicles. He was first among such men\nas her men-folk because her men-folk had so willed it: he was their\nleader, no more majestic than themselves, and less sacred than most\npriests. But in that black palace she felt that all men trembled\nbefore him. It gave her for him a respect: he was at least a man\nbefore whom all these cravens trembled. And she imagined herself such\nanother being: strong, confident, unafraid.\n\nTherefore to the King alone she could speak. She imagined him\nsympathising with her on account of the ignoble trick that Cromwell\nhad played upon her, as if he too must recognise her such another as\nhimself. Being young she felt that God and the saints alike fought on\nher side. She was accustomed to think of herself as so assured and so\nbuoyant that she could bear alike the commands of such men as\nCromwell, as Gardiner and as her cousin with a smile of wisdom. She\ncould bide her time.\n\nThrockmorton had shocked her, not because he was a villain who had\nlaid hands upon her, but because he had fooled her so that unless she\nmade haste those other men would prove too many for her. They would\nhang her.\n\nTherefore she must speak to the King. Lying still, looking at the\ndarkness, listening to the breathing of Margot Poins, who slept across\nthe foot of her bed, she had felt no fear whatsoever of Henry. It was\ntrue she had trembled before him at the masque, but she swept that out\nof her mind. She could hardly believe that she had trembled and\nforgotten the Italian words that she should have spoken. Yet she had\nstood there transfixed, without a syllable in her mind. And she had\nmanaged to bring out any words at all only by desperately piecing\ntogether the idea of Ovid's poem and Aulus Gellius' Eulogy of Marcus\nCrassus, which was very familiar in her ears because she had always\nimagined for a hero such a man: munificent, eloquent, noble and\nlearned in the laws. The hall had seemed to blaze before her--it was\nonly because she was so petrified with fright that she had not turned\ntail or fallen on her knees.\n\nTherefore she must speak to him when he came to see his horses. She\nmust bring him to her side before the tall spy with the eyes and the\nmouth that grinned as if at the thought of virtue could give Cromwell\nthe signal to undo her.\n\nShe spoke vehemently to the King; she was indignant, because it seemed\nto her she was defiled by these foul men who had grasped at her.\n\n'They have brought me down with a plot,' she said. She stretched out\nher hand and cried earnestly: 'Sir, believe that what I would have I\nask for without any plotting.'\n\nHe leant back upon his rail. His round and boding eyes avoided her\nface.\n\n'You have spoilt my morning betwixt you,' he muttered. First it was\nold Rochford who failed. Could a man not see his horses gallop without\nbeing put in mind of decay and death? Had he need of that? 'Why, I\nasked you for pleasant converse,' he finished.\n\nShe pleaded: 'Sir, I knew not that Pole was a traitor. Before God, I\nwould now that he were caught up. But assuredly a way could be found\nwith the Bishop of Rome....'\n\n'This is a parcel of nonsense,' he shouted suddenly, dismissing her\nwhole story. Would she have him believe it thinkable that a spy should\nswear away a woman's life? She had far better spend her time composing\nof fine speeches.\n\n'Sir,' she cried, 'before the Most High God....'\n\nHe lifted his hand.\n\n'I am tired of perpetual tears,' he muttered, and looked up the\nperspective of stable walls and white rails as if he would hurry away.\n\nShe said desperately: 'You will meet with tears perpetual so long as\nthis man....'\n\nHe lifted his hand, clenched right over his head.\n\n'By God,' he bayed, 'may I never rest from cat and dog quarrels? I\nwill not hear you. It is to drive a man mad when most he needs\nsolace.'\n\nHe jerked himself down from the rail and shot over his shoulder:\n\n'You will break your head if you run against a wall; I will have you\nin gaol ere night fall.' And he seemed to push her backward with his\ngreat hand stretched out.\n\n\nIX\n\n'Why, sometimes,' Throckmorton said, 'a very perfect folly is like a\nvery perfect wisdom.' He sat upon her table. 'So it is in this case,\nhe did send for me. No happening could have been more fortunate.'\n\nHe had sent away the man from her door and had entered without any\nleave, laughing ironically in his immense fan-shaped beard.\n\n'Your ladyship thought to have stolen a march upon me,' he said. 'You\ncould have done me no better service.'\n\nShe was utterly overcome with weariness. She sat motionless in her\nchair and listened to him.\n\nHe folded his arms and crossed his legs.\n\n'So he did send for me,' he said. 'You would have had him belabour me\nwith great words. But his Highness is a politician like some others.\nHe beat about the bush. And be sure I left him openings to come in to\nmy tidings.'\n\nKatharine hung her head and thought bitterly that she had had the\nboldness; this other man reaped the spoils. He leaned forward and\nsighed. Then he laughed.\n\n'You might wonder that I love you,' he said. 'But it is in the nature\nof profound politicians to love women that be simple, as it is the\nnature of sinners to love them that be virtuous. Do not believe that\nan evil man loveth evil. He contemns it. Do not believe that a\npolitician loveth guile. He makes use of it to carry him into such a\nsecurity that he may declare his true nature. Moreover, there is no\nevil man, since no man believeth himself to be evil. I love you.'\n\nKatharine closed her eyes and let her head fall back in her chair. The\ndusk was falling slowly, and she shivered.\n\n'You have no warrant to take me away?' she asked, expressionlessly.\n\nHe laughed again.\n\n'Thus,' he said, 'devious men love women that be simple. And, for a\nprofound, devious and guileful politician you shall find none to match\nhis Highness.'\n\nHe looked at Katharine with scrutinising and malicious eyes. She never\nmoved.\n\n'I would have you listen,' he said.\n\nShe had had no one to talk to all that day. There was no single\ncreature with whom she could discuss. She might have asked counsel of\nold Rochford. But apart from the disorder of his mind he had another\ntrouble. He had a horse for sale, and he had given the refusal of it\nto a man called Stey who lived in Warwickshire. In the meanwhile two\nFrenchmen had made him a greater offer, and no answer came from\nWarwickshire. He was in a fume. Cicely Elliott was watching him and\nthinking of nothing else, Margot Poins was weeping all day, because\nthe magister had been bidden to go to Paris to turn into Latin the\nletters of Sir Thomas Wyatt. There was no one around Katharine that\nwas not engrossed in his own affairs. In that beehive of a place she\nhad been utterly alone with horror in her soul. Thus she could hardly\npiece together Throckmorton's meanings. She thought he had come to\ngibe at her.\n\n'Why should I listen?' she said.\n\n'Because,' he answered sardonically, 'you have a great journey\nindicated for you, and I would instruct you as to certain peaks that\nyou may climb.'\n\nShe had been using her rosary, and she moved it in her lap.\n\n'Any poor hedge priest would be a better guide on such a journey,' she\nanswered listlessly.\n\n'Why, God help us all,' he laughed, 'that were to carry simplicity\ninto a throne-room. In a stable-yard it served. But you will not\nalways find a king among horse-straws.'\n\n'God send I find the King of Peace on a prison pallet,' she answered.\n\n'Why, we are at cross purposes,' he said lightly. He laughed still\nmore loudly when he heard that the King had threatened her with a\ngaol.\n\n'Do you not see,' he asked, 'how that implies a great favour towards\nyou?'\n\n'Oh, mock on,' she answered.\n\nHe leaned forward and spoke tenderly.\n\n'Why, poor child,' he said. 'If a man be moved because you moved him,\nit was you who moved him. Now, if you can move such a heavy man that\nis a certain proof that he is not indifferent to you.'\n\n'He threatened me with a gaol,' Katharine said bitterly.\n\n'Aye,' Throckmorton answered, 'for you were in fault to him. That is\never the weakness of your simple natures. They will go brutally to\nwork upon a man.'\n\n'Tell me, then, in three words, what his Highness will do with me,'\nshe said.\n\n'There you go brutally to work again,' he said. 'I am a poor man that\ndo love you. You ask what another man will do with you that affects\nyou.'\n\nHe stood up to his full height, dressed all in black velvet.\n\n'Let us, then, be calm,' he said, though his voice trembled and he\npaused as if he had forgotten the thread of his argument. 'Why, even\nso, you were in grievous fault to his Highness that is a prince much\ntroubled. As thus: You were certain of the rightness of your cause.'\n\n'It is that of the dear saints,' Katharine said.... He touched his\nbonnet with three fingers.\n\n'You are certain,' he repeated. 'Nevertheless, here is a man whose\nfury is like an agony to him. He looks favourably upon you. But, if a\nman be formed to fight he must fight, and call the wrong side good.'\n\n'God help you,' Katharine said. 'What can be good that is set in array\nagainst the elect of God?'\n\n'These be brave words,' he answered, 'but the days of the Crusades be\nover. Here is a King that fights with a world that is part good, part\nevil. In part he fights for the dear saints; in part they that fight\nagainst him fight for the elect of God. Then he must call all things\nwell upon his side, if he is not to fail where he is right as well as\nwhere he is wrong.'\n\n'I do not take you well,' Katharine said. 'When the Laced\u00c3\u00a6monians\nstrove with the Great King....'\n\n'Why, dear heart,' he said, 'those were the days of a black and white\nworld; now we are all grey or piebald.'\n\n'Then tell me what the King will do with me,' she answered.\n\nHe made a grimace.\n\n'All your learning will not make of you but a very woman. It is: What\nwill he do? It is: A truce to words. It is: Get to the point. But the\npoint is this....'\n\n'In the name of heaven,' she said, 'shall I go to gaol or no?'\n\n'Then in the name of heaven,' he said, 'you shall--this next month, or\nnext year, or in ten years' time. That is very certain, since you goad\na King to fury.'\n\nShe opened her mouth, but he silenced her with his hand.\n\n'No, you shall not go to gaol upon this quarrel!' She sank back into\nher chair. He surveyed her with a sardonic malice.\n\n'But it is very certain,' he said, 'that had there been there ready a\nclerk with a warrant and a pen, you had not again seen the light of\nday until you came to a worse place on a hill.'\n\nKatharine shivered.\n\n'Why, get you gone, and leave me to pray,' she said.\n\nHe stretched out towards her a quivering hand.\n\n'Aye, there you be again, simple and brutal!' His jaws grinned beneath\nhis beard. 'I love the air you breathe. I go about to tell a tale in a\nlong way that shall take a long time, so that I may stay with you. You\ncry: \"For pity, for pity, come to the point.\" I have pity. So you cry,\nhaving obtained your desire, \"Get ye gone, and let me pray!\"'\n\nShe said wearily:\n\n'I have had too many men besiege me with their suits.'\n\nHe shrugged his great shoulders and cried:\n\n'Yet you never had friend better than I, who bring you comfort hoping\nfor none in return.'\n\n'Why,' she answered, 'it is a passing bitter thing that my sole friend\nmust be a man accounted so evil.'\n\nHe moved backwards again to the table; set his white hands upon it\nbehind him, and balancing himself upon them swung one of his legs\nslowly.\n\n'It is a good doctrine of the Holy Church,' he said, 'to call no man\nevil until he be dead.' He looked down at the ground, and then,\nsuddenly, he seemed to mock at her and at himself. 'Doubtless, had\nsuch a white soul as yours led me from my first day, you to-day had\ncounted me as white. It is evident that I was not born with a nature\nthat warped towards sin. For, let us put it that Good is that thing\nthat you wish.' He looked up at her maliciously. 'Let that be Good.\nThen, very certainly, since I am enlisted heart and soul in the desire\nthat you may have what you wish, you have worked a conversion in me.'\n\n'I will no longer bear with your mocking,' she said. She began to feel\nherself strong enough to command for him.\n\n'Why,' he answered, 'hear me you shall. And I must mock, since to mock\nand to desire are my nature. You pay too little heed to men's natures,\ntherefore the day will come to shed tears. That is very certain, for\nyou will knock against the whole world.'\n\n'Why, yes,' she answered. 'I am as God made me.'\n\n'So are all Christians,' he retorted. 'But some of us strive to\nimprove on the pattern.' She made an impatient movement with her\nhands, and he seemed to force himself to come to a point. 'It may be\nthat you will never hear me speak again,' he said quickly. 'Both for\nyou and for me these times are full of danger. Let me then leave you\nthis legacy of advice.... Here is a picture of the King's Highness.'\n\n'I shall never go near his Highness again,' Katharine said.\n\n'Aye, but you will,' he answered, 'for 'tis your nature to meddle; or\n'tis your nature to work for the blessed saints. Put it which way you\nwill. But his Highness meditateth to come near you.'\n\n'Why, you are mad,' Katharine said wearily. 'This is that maggot of\nMagister Udal's.'\n\nHe lifted one finger in an affected, philosophic gesture.\n\n'Oh, nay,' he laughed. 'That his Highness meditateth more speech with\nyou I am assured. For he did ask me where you usually resorted.'\n\n'He would know if I be a traitor.'\n\n'Aye, but from your own word of mouth he would know it.' He grinned\nonce more at her. 'Do you think that I would forbear to court you if I\nwere not afraid of another than you?'\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders up to her ears, and he sniggered, stroking\nhis beard.\n\n'You may take that as a proof very certain,' he said. 'None of your\nhatred should have prevented me, for I am a very likeworthy man.\nLadies that have hated afore now, I have won to love me. With you,\ntoo, I would essay the adventure. You are most fair, most virtuous,\nmost simple--aye, and most lovable. But for the moment I am afraid.\nFrom now on, for many months, I shall not be seen to frequent you. For\nI have known such matters of old. A great net is cast: many\nfish--smaller than I be, who am a proper man--are taken up.'\n\n'It is good hearing that you will no more frequent me,' Katharine\nsaid.\n\nHe nodded his great head.\n\n'Why, I speak of what is in my mind,' he answered. 'Think upon it, and\nit will grow clear when it is too late. But here I will draw you a\npicture of the King.'\n\n'I have seen his Highness with mine own eyes,' she caught him up.\n\n'But your eyes are so clear,' he sighed. 'They see the black and the\nwhite of a man. The grey they miss. And you are slow to learn.\nNevertheless, already you have learned that here we have no yea-nay\nworld of evil and good....'\n\n'No,' she said, 'that I have not learned, nor never shall.'\n\n'Oh, aye,' he mocked at her. 'You have learned that the Bishop of\nWinchester, who is on the side of your hosts of heaven, is a knave and\na fool. You have learned that I, whom you have accounted a villain, am\nfor you, and a very wise man. You have learned that Privy Seal, for\nwhose fall you have prayed these ten years, is, his deeds apart, the\nonly good man in this quaking place.'\n\n'His acts are most hateful,' Katharine said stoutly.\n\n'But these are not the days of Plutarch,' he answered. 'And I doubt\nthe days of Plutarch never were. For already you have learned that a\nman may act most evilly, even as Privy Seal, and yet be the best man\nin the world. And ...' he ducked his great head sardonically at her,\n'you have learned that a man may be most evil and yet act passing well\nfor your good. So I will draw the picture of the King for you....'\n\nSomething seductive in his voice, and the good humour with which he\ncalled himself villain, made Katharine say no more than:\n\n'Why, you are an incorrigible babbler!'\n\nWhilst he had talked she had grown assured that the King meditated no\nimprisoning of her. The conviction had come so gradually that it had\nmerely changed her terrified weariness into a soft languor. She lay\nback in her chair and felt a comfortable limpness in all her limbs.\n\n'His Highness,' Throckmorton said, 'God preserve him and send him good\nfortune--is a great and formidable club. His Highness is a most great\nand most majestic bull. He is a thunderbolt and a glorious light; he\nis a storm of hail and a beneficent sun. There are few men more\ncertain than he when he is certain. There is no one so full of doubts\nwhen he doubteth. There is no wind so mighty as he when he is inspired\nto blow; but God alone, who directeth the wind in its flight, knoweth\nwhen he will storm through the world. His Highness is a balance of a\npair of scales. Now he is up, now down. Those who have ruled him have\ntaken account of this. If you had known the Sieur Cromwell as I have,\nyou would have known this very well. The excellent the Privy Seal hath\nbeen beknaved by the hour, and hath borne it with a great composure.\nFor, well he knew that the King, standing in midst of a world of\ndoubts, would, in the next hour, the next week, or the next month,\ncome in the midst of doubts to be of Privy Seal's mind. Then Privy\nSeal hath pushed him to action. Now his Highness is a good lover, and\nbeing himself a great doubter, he loveth a simple and convinced\nnature. Therefore he hath loved Privy Seal....'\n\n'In the name of the saints,' Katharine laughed, 'call you Privy Seal's\na simple nature?'\n\nHe answered imperturbably:\n\n'Call you Cato's a complex one? He who for days and days and years and\nyears said always one thing alone: \"Carthage must be destroyed!\"'\n\n'But this man is no noble Roman,' Katharine cried indignantly.\n\n'There was never a nature more Roman,' Throckmorton mocked at her.\n'For if Cato cried for years: _Delenda est Carthago_, Cromwell hath\ncontrived for years: _Floreat rex meus._ Cato stuck at no means. Privy\nSeal hath stuck at none. Madam Howard: Privy Seal wrote to the King in\nhis first letter, when he was but a simple servant of the Cardinal,\n\"I, Thomas Cromwell, if you will give ear to me, will make your Grace\nthe richest and most puissant king ever there was.\" So he wrote ten\nyears agone; so he hath said and written daily for all those years.\nThis it is to have a simple nature....'\n\n'But the vile deeds!' Katharine said.\n\n'Madam Howard,' Throckmorton laughed, 'I would ask you how many broken\ntreaties, how many deeds of treachery, went to the making of the Roman\nstate, since Sinon a traitor brought about the fall of Troy, since\nAeneas betrayed Queen Dido and brought the Romans into Italy, until\nSylla played false with Marius, C\u00c3\u00a6sar with the friends of Sylla,\nBrutus with C\u00c3\u00a6sar, Antony with Brutus, Octavius with Antony--aye, and\nuntil the Blessed Constantine played false to Rome herself.'\n\n'Foul man, ye blaspheme,' Katharine cried.\n\n'God keep me from that sin,' he answered gravely.\n\n'--And of all these traitors,' she continued, 'not one but fell.'\n\n'Aye, by another traitor,' he caught her up. 'It was then as now. Men\nfell, but treachery prospered--aye, and Rome prospered. So may this\nrealm of England prosper exceedingly. For it is very certain that\nCromwell hath brought it to a great pitch, yet Cromwell made himself\nby betraying the great Cardinal.'\n\nKatharine protested too ardently to let him continue. The land was\nbrought to a low and vile estate. And it was known that Cromwell had\nbeen, before all things, and to his own peril, faithful to the great\nCardinal's cause.\n\nThrockmorton shrugged his shoulders.\n\n'Without doubt you know these histories better than I,' he answered.\n'But judge them how you will, it is very certain that the King, who\nloveth simple natures, loveth Privy Seal.'\n\n'Yet you have said that he lay under a great shadow,' Katharine\nconvicted him.\n\n'Well,' he said composedly, 'the balance is down against him. This\nleague with Cleves hath brought him into disfavour. But well he\nknoweth that, and it will be but a short time ere he will work again,\nand many years shall pass ere again he shall misjudge. Such mistakes\nhath he made before this. But there hath never been one to strike at\nhim in the right way and at the right time. Here then is an opening.'\n\nKatharine regarded him with a curiosity that was friendly and\nawakened: he caught her expression and laughed.\n\n'Why, you begin to learn,' he said.\n\n'When you speak clearly I can take your meaning,' she answered.\n\n'Then believe me,' he said earnestly. 'Tell all with whom you may come\ntogether. And you may come to your uncle very easily. Tell him that if\nhe may find France and Spain embroiled within this five months, Privy\nSeal and Cleves may fall together. But, if he delay till Privy Seal\nhath shaken him clear of Cleves, Cromwell shall be our over-king for\ntwenty years.'\n\nHe paused and then continued:\n\n'Believe me again. Every word that is spoken against Privy Seal shall\ntell its tale--until he hath shaken himself clear of this Cleves coil.\nHis Highness shall rave, but the words will rankle. His Highness shall\nthreaten you--but he shall not strike--for he will doubt. It is by his\ndoubts that you may take him.'\n\n'God help me,' Katharine said. 'What is this of \"you\" to me?'\n\nHe did not heed her, but continued:\n\n'You may speak what you will against Privy Seal--but speak never a\nword against the glory of the land. It is when you do call this realm\nthe Fortunate Land that at once you make his Highness incline towards\nyou--and doubt. \"Island of the Blest,\" say you. This his Highness\nrejoices, saying to himself: \"My governing appeareth Fortunate to the\nWorld.\" But his Highness knoweth full well the flaws that be in his\nFortunate Island. And specially will he set himself to redress wrongs,\nassuage tears, set up chantries, and make his peace with God. But if\nyou come to him saying: \"This land is torn with dissent. Here heresies\nbreed and despair stalks abroad\"; if you say all is not well, his\nHighness getteth enraged. \"All is well,\" he will swear. \"All is well,\nfor I made it\"--and he would throw his cap into the face of Almighty\nGod rather than change one jot of his work. In short, if you will\npraise him you make him humble, for at bottom the man is humble; if\nyou will blame him you will render him rigid as steel and more proud\nthan the lightning. For, before the world's eyes, this man must be\nproud, else he would die.'\n\nKatharine had her hand upon her cheek. She said musingly:\n\n'His Highness did threaten me with a gaol. But you say he will not\nstrike. If I should pray him to restore the Church of God, would he\nnot strike then?'\n\n'Child,' Throckmorton answered, 'it will lie with the way you ask it.\nIf you say: \"This land is heathen, your Grace hath so made it,\" his\nHighness will be more than terrible. But if you say: \"This land\nprospereth exceedingly and is beloved of the Mother of God,\" his\nHighness will begin to doubt that he hath done little to pleasure\nGod's Mother--or to pleasure you who love that Heavenly Rose. Say how\nall good people rejoice that his Highness hath given them a faith pure\nand acceptable. And very shortly his Highness will begin to wonder of\nhis Faith.'\n\n'But that were an ignoble flattery,' Katharine said.\n\nHe answered quietly:\n\n'No! no! For indeed his Highness hath given all he could give. It is\nthe hard world that hath pushed him against you and against his good\nwill. Believe me, his Highness loveth good doctrine better than you,\nI, or the Bishop of Rome. So that....'\n\nHe paused, and concluded:\n\n'This Lord Cromwell moves in the shadow of a little thing that casts\nhardly any shadow. You have seen it?'\n\nShe shook her head negligently, and he laughed:\n\n'Why, you will see it yet. A small, square thing upon a green hill.\nThe noblest of our land kneel before it, by his Highness' orders. Yet\nthe worship of idols is contemned now.' He let his malicious eyes\nwander over her relaxed, utterly resting figure.\n\n'I would ye would suffer me to kiss you on the mouth,' he sighed.\n\n'Why, get you gone,' she said, without anger.\n\n'Oh, aye,' he said, with some feeling. 'It is pleasant to be desired\nas I desire you. But it is true that ye be meat for my masters.'\n\n'I will take help from none of your lies.' She returned to her main\nposition.\n\nHe removed his bonnet, and bowed so low to her that his great and\nshining beard hung far away from his chest.\n\n'Madam Howard,' he mocked, 'my lies will help you well when the time\ncomes.'\n\n\n\n\nPART THREE\n\nTHE KING MOVES\n\nI\n\n\nMarch was a month of great storms of rain in that year, and the\nriver-walls of the Thames were much weakened. April opened fine enough\nfor men to get about the land, so that, on a day towards the middle of\nthe month, there was a meeting of seven Protestant men from Kent and\nEssex, of two German servants of the Count of Oberstein, and of two\nother German men in the living-room of Badge, the printer, in Austin\nFriars. It happened that the tide was high at four in the afternoon,\nand, after a morning of glints of sun, great rain fell. Thus, when the\nLord Oberstein's men set out into the weather, they must needs turn\nback, because the water was all out between Austin Friars and the\nriver. They came again into the house, not very unwillingly, to resume\ntheir arguments about Justification by Faith, about the estate of the\nQueen Anne, about the King's mind towards her, and about the price of\nwool in Flanders.\n\nThe printer himself was gloomy and abstracted; arguments about\nJustification interested him little, and when the talk fell upon the\nprice of wool, he remained standing, absolutely lost in gloomy dreams.\nIt grew a little dark in the room, the sky being so overcast, and\nsuddenly, all the voices having fallen, there was a gurgle of water by\nthe threshold, and a little flood, coming in between sill and floor,\nreached as it were, a tiny finger of witness towards his great feet.\nHe looked down at it uninterestedly, and said:\n\n'Talk how you will, I can measure this thing by words and by print.\nHere hath this Queen been with us a matter of four months. Now in my\nchronicle the pageants that have been made in her honour fill but five\npages.' Whereas the chronicling of the jousts, pageants, merry-nights,\nmasques and hawkings that had been given in the first four months of\nthe Queen Jane had occupied sixteen pages, and for the Queen Anne\nBoleyn sixty and four. 'What sort of honour is it, then, that the\nKing's Highness showeth the Queen?' He shook his head gloomily.\n\n'Why, goodman,' a woolstapler from the Tower Hamlets cried at him,\n'when they shot off the great guns against her coming to Westminster\nin February all my windows were broken by the shrinking of the earth.\nSuch ordnance was never yet shot off in a Queen's honour.'\n\nThe printer remained gloomily silent for a minute; the wind howled in\nthe chimney-place, and the embers of the fire spat and rustled.\n\n'Even as ye are held here by the storm, so is the faith of God in\nthese lands,' he said. 'This is the rainy season.' More water came in\nbeneath the door, and he added, 'Pray God we be not all drowned in our\nholes.'\n\nA motionless German, who had no English, shifted his feet from the wet\nfloor to the cross-bar of his chair. Gloom, dispiritude, and dampness\nbrooded in the low, dark room. But a young man from Kent, who, being\nused to ill weather, was not to be cast down by gloomy skies, cried\nout in his own dialect that they had arms to use and leaders to lead\nthem.\n\n'Aye, and we have racks to be stretched on and hang-men to stretch\nthem,' the printer answered. 'Is it with the sound of ordnance that a\nQueen is best welcomed? When she came to Westminster, what welcome had\nshe? Sirs, I tell you the Mayor of London brought only barges and\npennons and targets to her honour. The King's Highness ordered no\nbetter state; therefore the King's Highness honoureth not this Queen.'\n\nA scrivener who had copied chronicles for another printer answered\nhim:\n\n'Master Printer John Badge, ye are too much in love with velvet; ye\nare too avid of gold. Earlier records of this realm told of blows\nstruck, of ships setting sail, of godly ways of life and of towns in\nFrance taken by storm. But in your books of the new reign we read all\nday of cloths of estate, of cloth of gold, of blue silk full of eyes\nof gold, of garlands of laurels set with brims of gold, of gilt bars,\nof crystal corals, of black velvet set with stones, and of how the\nKing and his men do shift their suits six times in one day. The fifth\nHarry never shifted his harness for fourteen days in the field.'\n\nThe printer shrugged his enormous shoulders.\n\n'Oh, ignorant!' he said. 'A hundred years ago kings made war with\nblows. Now it is done with black velvets or the lack of black velvets.\nAnd I love laurel with brims of gold if such garlands crown a Queen of\nour faith. And I lament their lack if by it the King's Highness maketh\nwar upon our faith. And Privy Seal shall dine with the Bishop of\nWinchester, and righteousness kiss with the whoredom of abomination.'\n\n'An my Lord Cromwell knew how many armed men he had to his beck he had\nnever made peace with Winchester,' the man from Kent cried. He rose\nfrom his bench and went to stand near the fire.\n\nA door-latch clicked, and in the dark corner of the room appeared\nsomething pale and shining--the face of old Badge, who held open the\nstair-door and grinned at the assembly, leaning down from a high step.\n\n'Weather-bound all,' he quavered maliciously. 'I will tell you why.'\n\nHe slipped down the step, pulling behind him the large figure of his\ngrandchild Margot.\n\n'Get you gone back,' the printer snarled at her.\n\n'That will I not,' her gruff voice came. 'See where my back is wet\nwith the drippings through the roof.'\n\nShe and her grandfather had been sitting on a bed in the upper room,\nbut the rain was trickling now through the thatch. The printer made a\nnervous stride to his printing stick, and, brandishing it in the air,\npoured out these words:\n\n'Whores and harlots shall not stand in the sight of the godly.'\n\nMargot shrank back upon the stair-place and remained there, holding\nthe bolt of the door in her hand, ready to shut off access to the\nupper house.\n\n'I will take no beating, uncle,' she panted; 'this is my grandfather's\nabode and dwelling.'\n\nThe old man was sniggering towards the window. He had gathered up his\ngown about his knees and picked his way between the pools of water on\nthe floor and the Lutherans on their chairs towards the window. He\nmounted upon an oak chest that stood beneath the casement and, peering\nout, chuckled at what he saw.\n\n'A mill race and a dam,' he muttered. 'This floor will be a duck pond\nin an hour.'\n\n'Harlot and servant of a harlot,' the printer called to his niece. The\nLutherans, who came from houses where father quarrelled with son and\nmother with daughter, hardly troubled more than to echo the printer's\nwords of abuse. But one of them, a grizzled man in a blue cloak, who\nhad been an ancient friend of the household, broke out:\n\n'Naughty wench, thou wast at the ordeal of Dr Barnes.'\n\nMargot, drawing her knees up to her chin where she sat on the stairs,\nanswered nothing. Had she not feared her uncle's stick, she was minded\nto have taken a mop to the floor and to have put a clout in the\ndoorway.\n\n'Abominable naughty wench,' the grizzled man went on. 'How had ye the\nheart to aid in that grim scene? Knew ye no duty to your elders?'\n\nMargot closed the skirts round her ankles to keep away the upward\ndraught and answered reasonably:\n\n'Why, Neighbour Ned, my mistress made me go with her to see a heretic\nswinged. And, so dull is it in our service, that I would go to a\npuppet show far less fine and thank thee for the chance.'\n\nThe printer spat upon the floor when she mentioned her mistress.\n\n'I will catechize,' he muttered. 'Answer me as I charge thee.'\n\nThe old man, standing on the chest, tapped one of the Germans on the\nshoulder.\n\n'See you that wall, friend?' he laughed. 'Is it not a noble dam to\nstay the flood back into our house? Now the Lord Cromwell....'\n\nThe Lanzknecht rolled his eyes round, because he understood no\nEnglish. The old man went on talking, but no one there, not even\nMargot Poins, heeded him. She looked at her uncle reasonably, and\nsaid:\n\n'Why, an thou wilt set down thy stick I will even consider thee,\nuncle.' He threw the stick into the corner and immediately she went to\nfetch a mop from the cooking closet, where there lived a mumbling old\nhousekeeper. The printer followed her with gloomy eyes.\n\n'Is not thy mistress a naughty woman?' he asked, as a judge talks to a\nprisoner condemned.\n\nShe answered, 'Nay,' as if she had hardly attended to him.\n\n'Is she not a Papist?'\n\nShe answered, 'Aye,' in the same tone and mopped the floor beneath a\nman's chair.\n\nHer grandfather, standing high on the oak chest, so that his bonnet\nbrushed the beams of the dark ceiling, quavered at her:\n\n'Would she not bring down this Crummock, whose wall hath formed a dam\nso that my land-space is now a stream and my house-floor a frog pond?'\n\nShe answered, 'Aye, grandfer,' and went on with her mopping.\n\n'Did she not go with a man to a cellar of the Rogues' Sanctuary after\nWinchester's feast?' Neighbour Ned barked at her. 'Such are they that\nwould bring down our Lord!'\n\n'Did she not even so with her cousin before he went to Calais?' her\nuncle asked.\n\nMargot answered seriously:\n\n'Nay, uncle, no night but what she hath slept in these arms of mine\nthat you see.'\n\n'Aye, you are her creature,' Neighbour Ned groaned.\n\n'Foul thing,' the printer shouted. 'Eyes are upon thee and upon her.\nIt was the worst day's work that ever she did when she took thee to\nher arms. For I swear to God that her name shall be accursed in the\nland. I swear to God....'\n\nHe choked in his throat. His companions muttered Harlot; Strumpet;\nSpouse of the Fiend. And suddenly the printer shouted:\n\n'See you; Udal is her go-between with the King, and he shall receive\nthee as his price. He conveyeth her to his Highness, she hath paid him\nwith thy virtue. Foul wench, be these words not true?'\n\nShe leaned upon her mop handle and said:\n\n'Why, uncle, it is a foul bird that 'files his own nest.'\n\nHe shook his immense fist in her face.\n\n'Shame shall out in the communion of the godly, be it whose kin it\nwill.'\n\n'Why, I wish the communion of the godly joy in its hot tales,' she\nanswered. 'As for me, speak you with the magister when he comes from\nFrance. As for my mistress, three times she hath seen the King since\nWinchester's feast was three months agone. She in no wise affected his\nHighness till she had heard his Highness confute the errors of Dr\nBarnes in the small closet. When she came away therefrom she said that\nhis Highness was like a god for his knowledge of God's law. If you\nwant better tales than that go to a wench from the stairs to make them\nfor you.'\n\n'Aye,' said their neighbour, 'three times hath she been with the King.\nAnd the price of the first time was the warrant that took thee to pay\nUdal for his connivance. And the price of the second was that the\nKing's Highness should confute our sacred Barnes in the conclave. And\nthe price of the third was that the Lord Cromwell should dine with the\nBishop of Winchester and righteousness sit with its head in ashes.'\n\n'Why, have it as thou wilt, Neighbour Ned,' she answered. 'In my life\nof twenty years thou hast brought me twenty sugar cates. God forbid\nthat I should stay thy willing lips over a sweet morsel.'\n\nIn the gloomy and spiritless silence that fell upon them all--since no\nman there much believed the things that were alleged, but all very\nthoroughly believed that evil days were stored up against them--the\nbursting open of the door made so great a sound that the speechless\nGerman tilted backward with his chair and lay on the ground, before\nany of them knew what was the cause. The black figure of a boy shut\nout the grey light and the torrents of rain. His head was bare, his\nfrieze clothes dripped and sagged upon his skin: he waved his clenched\nfist half at the sky and half at Margot's face and screamed:\n\n'I ha' carried letters for thee, 'twixt thy mistress and the King! I\nha' carried letters. I ... ha' ... been gaoled for it.'\n\n'O fool,' Margot's deep voice uttered, unmoved, 'the letters went not\nbetween those two. And thou art free; come in from the rain.'\n\nHe staggered across the prostrate German.\n\n'I ha' lost my advancement,' he sobbed. 'Where shall I go? Twenty\nhours I have hidden in the reeds by the riverside. I shall be taken\nagain.'\n\n'There is no hot pursuit for thee then,' Margot said, 'for in all the\ntwenty hours no man hath sought thee here.' She had the heavy\nimmobility of an elemental force. No fright could move her till she\nsaw the cause for fright. 'I will fetch thee a dram of strong waters.'\n\nHe passed his hand across his wet forehead.\n\n'Thy mistress is taken,' he cried. 'I saw Privy Seal's pikes go to her\ndoorway.'\n\n'Now God be praised,' the printer cried out, and caught at the boy's\nwrist. 'Tell your tale!' and he shook him on his legs.\n\n'Me, too, Privy Seal had taken--but I 'scaped free,' he gasped. 'These\ntwain had promised me advancement for braving their screeds. And I ha'\nlost it.'\n\n'Gossips all,' the Neighbour Ned barked out, 'to your feet and let us\nsing: \"A fortress fast is God the Lord.\" The harlot of the world is\ndown.'\n\n\nII\n\nDuring the time that had ensued between January and that month of\nMarch, it had been proved to Katharine Howard how well Throckmorton,\nthe spy, voiced the men folk of their day. He had left her alone, but\nshe seemed to feel his presence in all the air. He passed her in\ncorridors, and she knew from his very silence that he was carrying on\na fumbling game with her uncle Norfolk, and with Gardiner of\nWinchester. He had not induced her to play his game--but he seemed to\nhave made her see that every man else in the world was playing a game\nlike his. It was not, precisely, any more a world of black and white\nthat she saw, but a world of men who did one thing in order that\nsomething very different might happen a long time afterwards.\n\nThe main Court had moved from Greenwich to Hampton towards the end of\nJanuary, but the Lady Mary, with her ladies, came to a manor house at\nIsleworth; and shut in as she was with a grim mistress--who assuredly\nwas all white or black--Katharine found herself like one with ears\nstrained to catch sounds from a distance, listening for the smallest\nrumours that could come from the other great house up stream.\n\nThe other ladies each had their men, as Cicely Elliott had the old\nknight. One of them had even six, who one day fought a _m\u00c3\u00aal\u00c3\u00a9e_ for her\nfavours on an eyot before the manor windows. These men came by barge\nin the evenings, or rode over the flats with a spare horse to take\ntheir mistresses a-hawking after the herons in the swampy places. So\nthat each of them had her channel by which true gossip might reach\nher. But Katharine had none. Till the opening of March the magister\ncame to whisper with Margot Poins--then he was sent again to Paris to\nset his pen at the service of Sir Thomas Wyatt, who had so many\nletters to write. Thus she heard much women's tattle, but knew nothing\nof what passed. Only it seemed certain that Gardiner of Winchester was\nseeing fit--God knows why--to be hot in favour of the Old Faith. It\nwas certain, from six several accounts, that at Paul's Cross he had\npreached a sermon full of a very violent and acceptable doctrine. She\nwondered what move in the game this was: it was assuredly not for the\nlove of God. No doubt it was part of Throckmorton's plan. The\nLutherans were to be stirred to outrages in order to prove to the King\nhow insolent were they upon whom Privy Seal relied.\n\nIt gratified her to see how acute her prescience had been when Dr\nBarnes made his furious reply to the bishop. For Dr Barnes was one of\nPrivy Seal's most noted men: an insolent fool whom he had taken out of\nthe gutter to send ambassador to the Schmalkaldners. And it was on the\nday when Gardiner made his complaint to the King about Dr Barnes, that\nher uncle Norfolk sent to her to come to him at Hampton.\n\nHe awaited her, grim and jaundiced, in the centre of a great, empty\nroom, where, shivering with cold, he did not let his voice exceed a\ncroaking whisper though there was panelling and no arras on the dim\nwalls. But, to his queries, she answered clearly:\n\n'Nay, I serve the Lady Mary with her Latin. I hear no tales and I bear\nnone to any man.' And again:\n\n'Three times I have spoken with the King's Highness, the Lady Mary\nbeing by. And once it was of the Islands of the Blest, and once of the\nLatin books I read, and once of indifferent matters--such as of how\napple trees may be planted against a wall in Lincolnshire.'\n\nHer uncle gazed at her: his dark eyes were motionless and malignant by\nhabit; he opened his lips to speak; closed them again without a word\nspoken. He looked at a rose, carved in a far corner of the ceiling,\nlooked at her again, and muttered:\n\n'The French are making great works at Ardres.'\n\n'Oh, aye,' she answered, 'my cousin Tom wrote me as much. He is\ncommanded to stay at Calais.'\n\n'Tell me,' he said, 'will they go against Calais town in good\nearnest?'\n\n'If I knew that,' she answered, 'I should have had it in private words\nfrom my lady whom I serve. And, if I had it in private words I would\ntell it neither to you nor to any man.'\n\nHe scowled patiently and muttered:\n\n'Then tell in private words back again this: That if the French King\nor the Emperor do war upon us now Privy Seal will sit upon the King's\nback for ever.'\n\n'Ah, I know who hath talked with you,' she answered. 'Uncle, give me\nyour hand to kiss, for I must back to my mistress.'\n\nHe put his thin hand grimly behind his back.\n\n'Ye spy, then, for others,' he said. 'Go kiss their feet.'\n\nShe laughed in a nettled voice:\n\n'If the others get no more from me than your Grace of Norfolk....'\n\nHe frowned ominously, pivoted stiffly round on his heels, and said\nover his shoulder:\n\n'Then I will have thy cousin clapped up the first time he is found in\na drunken brawl at Calais.'\n\nShe was after him beseechingly, with her hands held out:\n\n'Oh no, uncle,' and 'Oh, dear uncle. Let poor fool Tom be drunken when\ndrunken brawls work no manner of ill.'\n\n'Then get you sent to the King of France, through the channel that you\nwot of, the message I have given you to convey.' He kept his back to\nher and spoke as if to the distant door.\n\n'Why must I mull in these matters?' she asked him piteously, 'or why\nmust poor Tom? God help him, he found me bread when you had left me to\nstarve.' It came to her as pitiful that her cousin, swaggering and\nunconscious, at a great distance, should be undone because these men\nquarrelled near her. He moved stiffly round again--he was so bolstered\nover with clothes against the cold.\n\n'It is not you that must meddle here,' he said. 'It is your mistress.\nOnly she will be believed by those you wot of.'\n\n'Speak you yourself,' she said.\n\nHe scowled hatefully.\n\n'Who of the French would believe _me_,' he snarled. He had been so\nmade a tool of by Privy Seal in times past that he had lost all hope\nof credence.\n\n'If I may come to it, I will do it,' she said suddenly.\n\nAfter all, it seemed to her, this action might bring about the\ndownfall of Privy Seal--and she desired his downfall. It would be a\nfolly to refuse her aid merely because her uncle was a craven man or\nThrockmorton a knave. It was a true thing that she was to ask the Lady\nMary to say--that if France and Spain should molest England together\nthe Cleves alliance must stand for good--and with it Privy Seal.\n\n'But, a' God's name, let poor Tom be,' she added.\n\nHe stood perfectly motionless for a moment, shrugged his shoulders\nstraight up and down, stood motionless for another moment, and then\nheld out his hand. She touched it with her lips.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a certain cate, or small cake, made of a paste sweetened\nwith honey and flavoured with cinnamon, that Katharine Howard very\nmuch loved. She had never tasted them till one day the King had come\nto visit his daughter, bearing with his own hands a great box of them.\nHe had had the receipt from Thomas Cromwell, who had had it of a Jew\nin Italy. Mary so much disaffected her father that, taking them from\nhis hands with one knee nearly upon the ground, she had said that her\nbirth ill-fitted her to eat these princely viands, and she had placed\nthem on a ledge of her writing-pulpit. Heaving a heavy sigh, he\nglanced at her book and said that he would not have her spoil her eyes\nwith too much of study; let her bid Lady Katharine to read and write\nfor her.\n\n'She will have greater need of her eyes than ever I of mine,' Mary\nanswered with her passionless voice.\n\n'I will not have you spoil your eyes,' he said heavily, and she gave\nhim back the reply:\n\n'My eyes are your Highness'.'\n\nHe made with his shoulders a slow movement of exasperation, and,\nturning to Katharine Howard, he began once more to talk of the Islands\nof the Blest. He was dressed all in black furs that day, so that his\nface appeared less pallid than when he had worn scarlet, and it seemed\nto her suddenly that he was a very pitiful man--a man who could do\nnothing; and one who, as Throckmorton had said, was nothing but a\ndoubt. There beside him, between the two of them, stood his\ndaughter--pale, straight, silent, her hands clasped before her. And\nher father had come to placate her. He had brought her cates to eat,\nor he would have beaten her into loving him. Yet Mary of England stood\nas rigid as a knife-blade; you could move her neither by love nor by\nthreats. This man had sinned against this daughter; here he was\nbrought up against an implacability. He was omnipotent in everything\nelse; this was his Pillars of Hercules. So she exerted herself to be\npleasant with him, and at one moment of the afternoon he stretched out\na great hand to the cinnamon cakes and placed one in his own mouth. He\nsat still, and, his great jaws moving slowly, he said that he scarcely\ndoubted that, if he himself could set sail with a great armada and\nmany men, he should find a calm region of tranquil husbandry and a\npure faith.\n\n'It might be found,' he said; then he sighed heavily, and, looking\nearnestly at her, brushed the crumbs from the furs about his neck.\n\n'One day, doubtless, your Highness shall find them,' Katharine\nanswered, 'if your Highness shall apply yourself to the task.' She was\nimpatient with him for his sighs. Let him, if he would, abandon his\nkingdom and his daughter to set out upon a quest, or let him stay\nwhere he was and set to work at any other task.\n\n'But whether your Highness shall find them beyond the Western Isles or\nhidden in this realm of England....'\n\nHe shrugged his great shoulders right up till the furs on them were\nbrushed by the feathers that fell from his bonnet.\n\n'God, wench!' he said gloomily, 'that is a question you are main happy\nto have time to dally with. I have wife and child, and kith and kin,\nand a plaguey basket of rotten apples to make cider from.'\n\nHe pulled himself out of his chair with both hands on the arms,\nstretched his legs as if they were cramped, and rolled towards the\ndoor.\n\n'Why, read of this matter in old books,' he said, 'and if you find the\nplace you shall take me there.' Then he spoke bitterly to the Lady\nMary, who had never moved.\n\n'Since your eyes are mine, I bid you not spoil them,' he said. 'Let\nthis lady aid you. She has ten times more of learning than you have.'\nBut, taking his jewelled walking-stick from beside the door, he added,\n'God, wench! you are my child. I have read your commentary, and I, a\nman who have as much of good letters as any man in Christendom, am\nwell content to father you.'\n\n'Did your Highness mark--this book being my child--which side of the\npaper it was written on?' his daughter asked.\n\nKatharine Howard sighed, for it was the Lady Mary's bitter jest that\nshe wrote on the rough side of the paper, having been born on the\nwrong side of the blanket.\n\n'Madam Howard,' she said to Katharine with a cold sneer, as of a very\naged woman, 'my father, who has taken many things from me to give to\nother women, takes now my commentary to give to you. Pray you finish\nit, and I will save mine eyes.'\n\nAs the King closed the door behind him she moved across to the chair\nand sat herself down to gaze at the coals. Katharine knelt at her feet\nand stretched out her hands. She was, she said, her mistress's woman.\nBut the Lady Mary turned obdurately the side of her face to her\nsuppliant; only her fingers picked at her black dress.\n\n'I am your woman,' Katharine said. 'Before God and St Anthony, the\nKing is naught to me! Before God and the Mother of God, no man is\naught to me! I swear that I am your woman. I swear that I will speak\nas you bid me speak, or be silent. May God do so to me if in aught I\nact other than may be of service to you!'\n\n'Then you may sit motionless till the green mould is over your\ncheeks,' Mary answered.\n\nBut two days later, in the afternoon, Katharine Howard came upon her\nmistress with her jaws moving voraciously. Half of the cinnamon cates\nwere eaten from the box on the writing-pulpit. A convulsion of rage\npassed over the girl's dark figure; her eyes dilated and appeared to\nblaze with a hot and threatening fury.\n\n'If I could have thy head, before God I would shorten thee by the\nneck!' she said. 'Stay now; go not. Take thy hand from the\ndoor-latch.'\n\nSudden sobs shook her, and tears dropped down her furrowed and pallid\ncheeks. She was tormented always by a gnawing and terrible hunger that\nno meat and no bread might satisfy, so that, being alone with the\ncates in the cold spring afternoon, she had, in spite of the donor,\nbeen forced always nearer and nearer to them.\n\n'God help me!' she said at last. 'Udal is gone, and the scullion that\nsupplied me in secret has the small-pox. How may I get me things to\neat?'\n\n'To have stayed to ask me!' Katharine cried. 'What a folly was here!'\nFor, as a daughter of the King, the Lady Mary was little more than\nherself; but because she was daughter to a queen that was at once a\nsaint and martyr, Katharine was ready to spend her life in her\nservice.\n\n'I would stay to ask a service of any man or woman,' Mary answered,\n'save only that I have this great hunger.' She clutched angrily at her\nskirt, and so calmed herself.\n\n'How may you help me?' she asked grimly. 'There are many that would\nput poison in my food. My mother was poisoned.'\n\n'I would eat myself of all the food that I bring you,' said Katharine.\n\n'And if thou wast poisoned, I must get me another, and yet another\nafter that. You know who it is that would have me away.'\n\nAt that hint of the presence of Cromwell, Katharine grew more serious.\n\n'I will save of my own food,' she answered simply.\n\n'Till your bones stick through your skin!' Mary sneered. 'See you, do\nyou know one man you could trust?'\n\nThe shadow fell the more deeply upon Katharine, because her cousin--as\nshe remembered every day--the one man that she could trust, was in\nCalais town.\n\n'I know of two women,' she said; 'my maid Margot and Cicely Elliott.'\n\nMary of England reflected for a long time. Her eyes sunk deep in her\nhead, grey and baleful, had the look of her father's.\n\n'Cicely Elliott is too well known for my woman,' she said. 'Thy maid\nMargot is a great lump, too. Hath she no lover?'\n\nThe magister was in Paris.\n\n'But a brother she hath,' Katharine said; 'one set upon advancement.'\n\nMary said moodily:\n\n'Advancement, then, may be in this. God knoweth his own good time. But\nyou might tell him; or it were better you should bid her tell him....\nIn short words, and fur ... wait.'\n\nShe had a certain snake-like eagerness and vehemence in her motions.\nShe opened swiftly an aumbry in which there stood a tankard of milk.\nShe took a clean pen, and then turned upon Katharine.\n\n'Before thou goest upon this errand,' she said, 'I would have thee\nknow that, for thee, there may be a traitor's death in this--and some\nglory in Heaven.'\n\n'You write to the Empress,' Katharine cried.\n\n'I write to a man,' the Lady Mary said. 'Might you speak with clear\neyes to my father if you knew more than that?'\n\n'I do not believe that you would bring your father down,' Katharine\nsaid.\n\n'Why, you have a very comfortable habit of belief,' Mary sneered at\nher. 'In two words! Will you carry this treasonable letter or no?'\n\n'God help me,' Katharine cried.\n\n'Well, God help you,' her mistress jeered. 'Two nights agone you swore\nto be my woman and no other man's. Here you are in a taking. Think\nupon it.'\n\nShe dipped her white pen in the milk and began to write upon a great\nsheet of paper, holding her head aslant to see the shine of the fluid.\n\nKatharine fought a battle within herself. Here was treason to the\nKing--but that was a little thing to her. Yet the King was a father\nwhom she would bring back to this daughter, and the traitor was a\ndaughter whom she was sworn to serve and pledged to bring back to this\nfather. If then she conveyed this letter....\n\n'Tell me,' she asked of the intent figure above the paper, 'when, if\never, this plot shall burst?'\n\n'Madam Howard,' the other answered, 'I heard thee not.'\n\n'I say I will convey your Highness' letter if the plot shall not burst\nfor many days. If it be to come soon I will forswear myself and be no\nlonger your woman.'\n\n'Why, what a pax is here?' her mistress faced round on her. 'What\nmuddles thy clear head? I doubt, knowing the craven kings that are of\nmy party, no plot shall burst for ten years. And so?'\n\n'Before then thou mayest be brought back to thy father,' Katharine\nsaid.\n\nMary of England burst into a hoarse laughter.\n\n'As God's my life,' she cried, 'that may well be. And you may find a\nchaste whore before either.'\n\nWhilst she was finishing her letter, Katharine Howard prayed that Mary\nthe Mother of Mercy might soften the hatred of this daughter, even as,\nof old times, she had turned the heart of Lucius the Syracusan. Then\nthere should be an end to plotting and this letter might work no ill.\n\nHaving waved the sheet of paper in the air to dry it, Mary crumpled it\ninto a ball.\n\n'See you,' she said, 'if this miscarry I run a scant risk. For, if\nthis be a treason, this treason is well enough known already to them\nyou wot of. They might have had my head this six years on one shift or\nanother had they so dared. So to me it matters little.--But for\nthee--and for thy maid Margot and this maid's brother and his house\nand his father and his leman--death may fall on ye all if this ball of\npaper miscarry.'\n\nKatharine made no answer and her mistress spoke on.\n\n'Take now this paper ball, give it to thy maid Margot, bid thy maid\nMargot bear it to her brother Ned.' Her brother Ned should place it in\nhis sleeve and walk with it to Herring Lane at Hampton. There, over\nagainst the house of the Sieur Chapuys, who was the Emperor's\nambassador to this Christian nation--over against that house there was\na cookshop to which resorted the servants of the ambassador. Passing\nit by, Katharine's maid's brother should thrust his hand in at the\ndoor and cry 'a pox on all stinking Kaiserliks and Papists,'--and he\nshould cast the paper at that cook's head. Then out would come master\ncook to his door and claim reparation. And for reparation Margot's\nbrother Ned should buy such viands as the cook should offer him. These\nviands he was to bring, as a good brother should, to his hungry\nsister, and these viands his sister should take to her room--which was\nKatharine's room. 'And, of an evening,' she finished, 'I shall come to\nthy room to commune with thee of the writers that be dead and yet\nbeloved. Hast thou the lesson by heart? I will say it again.'\n\n\nIII\n\nIt was in that way, however sorely against her liking, that Katharine\nHoward came into a plot. It subdued her, it seemed to age her, it was\nas if she had parted with some virtue. When again she spoke with the\nKing, who came to loll in his daughter's armed chair one day out of\nevery week, it troubled her to find that she could speak to him with\nher old tranquillity. She was ashamed at feeling no shame, since all\nthe while these letters were passing behind his back. Once even he had\nbeen talking to her of how they nailed pear trees against the walls in\nher Lincolnshire home.\n\n'Our garden man would say ...' she began a sentence. Her eye fell upon one\nof these very crumpled balls of paper. It lay upon the table and it\nconfused her to think that it appeared like an apple. 'Would say ... would\nsay ...' she faltered.\n\nHe looked at her with enquiring eyes, round in his great head.\n\n'It is too late,' she finished.\n\n'Even too late for what?' he asked.\n\n'Too late in the year to set the trees back,' she answered and her fit\nof nervousness had passed. 'For there is a fluid in trees that runneth\nupward in the spring of the year to greet the blessed sun.'\n\n'Why, what a wise lady is this!' he said, half earnest. 'I would I had\nsuch an adviser as thou hast,' he continued to his daughter.\n\nHe frowned for a moment, remembering that, being who he was, he should\nstand in need of no advice.\n\n'See you,' he said to Katharine. 'You have spoken of many things and\nwisely, after a woman's fashion of book-learning. Now I am minded that\nyou should hear me speak upon the Word of God which is a man's matter\nand a King's. This day sennight I am to have brought to my closet a\nheretic, Dr Barnes. If ye will ye may hear me confound him with goodly\ndoctrines.'\n\nHe raised both his eyebrows heavily and looked first at the Lady Mary.\n\n'You, I am minded, shall hear a word of true doctrine.'\n\nAnd to Katharine, 'I would hear how you think that I can manage a\ndisputation. For the fellow is the sturdiest rogue with a yard of\ntongue to wag.'\n\nKatharine maintained a duteous silence; the Lady Mary stood with her\nhands clasped before her. Upon Katharine he smiled suddenly and\nheavily.\n\n'I grow too old to be a match for thee in the learning of this world.\nThy tongue has outstripped me since I am become stale.... But hear me\nin the other make of talk.'\n\n'I ask no better,' Katharine said.\n\n'Therefore,' he finished, 'I am minded that you, Mog, and your ladies\nall, do move your residences from here to my house at Hampton. This is\nan old and dark place; there you shall be better honoured.'\n\nHe lay back in his chair and was pleased with the care that he took of\nhis daughter. Katharine glided intently across the smooth bare floor\nand took the ball of paper in her hand. His eyes followed her and he\nmoved his head round after her movements, heavily, and without any\nmotion of his great body. He was in a comfortable mood, having slept\nwell the night before, and having conversed agreeably in the bosom of\na family where pleasant conversation was a rare thing. For the Lady\nMary had forborne to utter biting speeches, since her eyes too had\nbeen upon that ball of paper. The King did not stay for many minutes\nafter Katharine had gone.\n\nShe was excited, troubled and amused--and, indeed, the passing of\nthose letters held her thoughts in those few days. Thus it was easy to\ngive the paper to her maid Margot, and easy to give Margot the\ndirections. But she knew very well by what shift Margot persuaded her\nscarlet-clothed springald of a brother to take the ball and to throw\nit into the cookshop. For the young Poins was set upon advancement,\nand Margot, buxom, substantial and honest-faced, stood before him and\nsaid: 'Here is your chance for advancement made ...' if he could carry\nthese missives very secretly.\n\n'For, brother Poins,' she said, 'thou knowest these great folks reward\ngreatly--and these things pass between folks very great. If I tell\nthee no names it is because thou canst see more through a stone wall\nthan common folk.'\n\nSo the young Poins cocked his bonnet more jauntily, and, setting out\nup river to Hampton, changed his scarlet clothes for a grey coat and\npuritan hose, and in the dark did his errand very well. He carried a\nlarge poke in which he put the larded capons and the round loaves that\nthe cook sold to him. Later, following a reed path along the river, he\ncame swiftly down to Isleworth with his bag on a cord and, in the\ndarkness from beneath the walls, he slung bag and cord in at Katharine\nHoward's open window. For several times this happened before the Lady\nMary's court was moved to Hampton. At first, Katharine had her tremors\nto put up with--and it was only when, each evening, with a thump and\nswish, the bag, sweeping out of the darkness, sped across her\nfloor--it was only then that Katharine's heart ceased from pulsing\nwith a flutter. All the while the letters were out of her own hands\nshe moved on tiptoe, as if she were a hunter intent on surprising a\ncoy quarry. Nevertheless, it was impossible for her to believe that\nthis was a dangerous game; it was impossible to believe that the\nheavy, unsuspicious and benevolent man who tried clumsily to gain his\ndaughter's love with bribes of cakes and kerchiefs--that this man\ncould be roused to order her to her death because she conveyed from\none place to another a ball of paper. It was more like a game of\npassing a ring from hand to hand behind the players' backs, for kisses\nfor forfeits if the ring were caught. Nevertheless, this was\ntreason-felony; yet it was furthering the dear cause of the saints.\n\nIt was on the day on which her uncle Norfolk had sent for her that the\nKing had his interview with the heretical Dr Barnes--nicknamed\nAntoninus Anglicanus.\n\nThe Lady Mary and Katharine Howard and her maid, Margot, were set in a\ntiny closet in which there was, in a hole in the wall, a niche for the\nKing's confessor. The King's own chamber was empty when they passed\nthrough, and they left the door between ajar. There came a burst of\nvoices, and swiftly the Bishop of Winchester himself entered their\ncloset. He lifted his black eyebrows at sight of them, and rubbed his\nthin hands with satisfaction.\n\n'Now we shall hear one of Crummock's henchmen swinged,' he whispered.\nHe raised a finger for them to lend ear and gazed through the crack of\nthe door. They heard a harsh voice, like a dog's bay, utter clearly:\n\n'Now goodly goodman Doctor, thou hast spoken certain words at Paul's\nCross. They touched on Justification; thou shalt justify them to me\nnow.' There came a sound of a man who cleared his throat--and then\nagain the heavy voice:\n\n'Why, be not cast down; we spoke as doctor to doctor. Without a doubt\nthou art learned. Show then thy learning. Wast brave at Paul's Cross.\nJustify now!'\n\nGardiner, turning from gazing through the door-crack, grinned at the\nthree women.\n\n'He rated _me_ at Paul's Cross!' he said. 'He thumped me as I had been\na thrashing floor.' They missed the Doctor's voice--but the King's\ncame again.\n\n'Why, this is a folly. I am Supreme Head, but I bid thee to speak.'\n\nThere was a long pause till they caught the words.\n\n'Your Highness, I do surrender my learning to your Highness'.' Then,\nindeed, there was a great roar:\n\n'Unworthy knave; surrender thyself to none but God. He is above me as\nabove thee. To none but God.'\n\nThere was another long silence, and then the King's voice again:\n\n'Why, get thee gone. Shalt to gaol for a craven....' And then came a\nhissing sound of vexation, a dull thud, and other noises.\n\nThe King's bonnet lay on the floor, and the King himself alone was\npadding down the room when they opened their door. His face was red\nwith rage.\n\n'Why, what a clever fiend is this Cromwell!' the Lady Mary said; but\nthe Bishop of Winchester was laughing. He pushed Margot Poins from the\ncloset, but caught Katharine Howard tightly by the arm.\n\n'Thou shalt write what thy uncle asked of thee!' he commanded in a low\nvoice, 'an thou do it not, thy cousin shall to gaol! I have a letter\nthou didst write me.'\n\nA black despair settled for a moment upon Katharine, but the King was\nstanding before her. He had walked with inaudible swiftness up from\nthe other end of the room.\n\n'Didst not hear me argue!' he said, with the vexation of a great\nchild. 'That poxy knave out-marched me!'\n\n'Why,' the Lady Mary sniggered at him, 'thy brewer's son is too many\nfor your Highness.'\n\nHenry snarled round at her; but she folded her hands before her and\nuttered:\n\n'The brewer's son made your Highness Supreme Head of the Church.\nTherefore, the brewer's son hath tied your Highness' tongue. For who\nmay argue with your Highness?'\n\nHe looked at her for a moment with a bemused face.\n\n'Very well,' he said.\n\n'The brewer's son should have made your Highness the lowest suppliant\nat the Church doors. Then, if, for the astounding of certain\nbeholders, your Highness were minded to argue, your Highness should\nfind adversaries.'\n\nThe bitter irony of her words made Katharine Howard angry. This poor,\nheavy man had other matters for misgiving than to be badgered by a\nwoman. But the irony was lost upon the King. He said very simply:\n\n'Why, that is true. If I be the Head, the Tail shall fear to bandy\nwords with me.' He addressed himself again to Katharine: 'I am sorry\nthat you did not hear me argue. I am main good at these arguments.'\nHe looked reflectively at Gardiner and said: 'Friend Winchester, one\nday I will cast a main at arguments with thee, and Kat Howard shall\nhear. But I doubt thou art little skilled with thy tongue.'\n\n'Why, I will make a better shift with my tongue than Privy Seal's men\ndare,' the bishop said. He glanced under his brows at Henry, as if he\nwere measuring the ground for a leap.\n\n'The Lady Mary is in the right,' he ventured.\n\nThe King, who was thinking out a speech to Katharine, said, 'Anan?'\nand Gardiner ventured further:\n\n'I hold it for true that this man held his peace, because Cromwell so\ncommanded it. He is Cromwell's creature, and Cromwell is minded to\nescape from the business with a whole skin.'\n\nThe King bent him an attentive ear.\n\n'It is to me, in the end, that Privy Seal owes amends,' Gardiner said\nrancorously. 'Since it was at me that this man, by Cromwell's orders,\ndid hurl his foul words at Paul's Cross.'\n\nThe King said:\n\n'Why, it is true that thou art more sound in doctrine than is Privy\nSeal. What wouldst thou have?'\n\nGardiner made an immense gesture, as if he would have embraced the\nwhole world.\n\nKatharine Howard trembled. Here they were, all the three of them\nCromwell's enemies. They were all alone with the King in a favouring\nmood, and she was on the point of crying out:\n\n'Give us Privy Seal's head.'\n\nBut, in this very moment of his opportunity, Gardiner faltered. Even\nthe blackness of his hatred could not make him bold.\n\n'That he should make me amends in public for the foul words that knave\nuttered. That they should both sue to me for pardon: that it should be\nshowed to the world what manner of man it is that they have dared to\nflout.'\n\n'Why, goodman Bishop, it shall be done,' the King said, and Katharine\ngroaned aloud. A clock with two quarter boys beside the large\nfireplace chimed the hour of four.\n\n'Aye!' the King commented to Katharine. 'I thought to have had a\npleasanter hour of it. Now you see what manner of life is mine: I must\ngo to a plaguing council!'\n\n'An I were your Highness,' Katharine cried, 'I would be avenged on\nthem that marred my pleasures.'\n\nHe touched her benevolently upon the cheek.\n\n'Sweetheart,' he said, 'an thou wert me thou'dst do great things.' He\nrolled towards the door, heavy and mountainous: with the latch in his\nhand, he cried over his shoulder: 'But thou shalt yet hear me argue!'\n\n'What a morning you have made of this!' Katharine threw at the bishop.\nThe Lady Mary shrugged her shoulders to her ears and turned away.\nGardiner said:\n\n'Anan?'\n\n'Oh, well your Holiness knows,' Katharine said. 'You might have come\nwithin an ace of having Cromwell down.'\n\nHis eyes flashed, and he swallowed with a bitter delight.\n\n'I have him at my feet,' he said. 'He shall do public reparation to\nme. You have heard the King say so.'\n\nThere were tears of vexation in Katharine's eyes.\n\n'Well I know how it is that this brewer's son has king'd it so long!'\nshe said. 'An I had been a man it had been his head or mine.'\n\nGardiner shook himself like a dog that is newly out of the water.\n\n'Madam Howard,' he said, 'you are mighty high. I have observed how the\nKing spoke all his words for your ear. His passions are beyond words\nand beyond shame.'\n\nThe Lady Mary was almost out of the room, and he came close enough to\nspeak in Katharine's ears.\n\n'But be you certain that his Highness' passions are not beyond the\nreverse of passion, which is jealousy. You have a cousin at\nCalais....'\n\nKatharine moved away from him.\n\n'Why, God help you, priest,' she said. 'Do you think you are the only\nman that knows that?'\n\nHe laughed melodiously, with a great anger.\n\n'But I am the man that knoweth best how to use my knowledge. Therefore\nyou shall do my will.'\n\nKatharine Howard laughed back at him:\n\n'Where your lordship's will marches with mine I will do it,' she said.\n'But I am main weary of your lordship's threats. You know the words of\nArtemidorus?'\n\nGardiner contained his rage.\n\n'You will write the letter we have asked you to write?'\n\nShe laughed again, and faced him, radiant, fair and flushed in the\ncheeks.\n\n'In so far as you beg me to write a letter praying the King of France\nand the Emperor to abstain from war upon this land, I will write the\nletter. But, in so far as that helps forward the plotting of you and a\nknave called Throckmorton, I am main sorry that I must write it.'\n\nThe bishop drew back, and uttered:\n\n'Madam Howard, ye are forward.'\n\n'Why, God help your lordship,' she said. 'Where I see little course\nfor respect I show little. You see I am friends with the\nKing--therefore leave you my cousin be. Because I am friends with the\nKing, who is a man among wolves, I will pray my mistress to indite a\nletter that shall save this King some troubles. But, if you threaten\nme with my cousin, or my cousin with me, I will use my friendship with\nthe King as well against you as against any other.'\n\nGardiner swallowed in his throat, winked his eyes, and muttered:\n\n'Why, so you do what we will, it matters little in what spirit you\nshall do it.'\n\n'So you and my uncle and Throckmorton keep your feet from my paths,\nyou may have my leavings,' she said. 'And they will be the larger\npart, since I ask little for myself.'\n\nHe gave her his episcopal blessing as she followed the Lady Mary to\nher rooms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer mind was made up--and she knew that it had been made up hastily,\nbut she was never one to give much time to doubting. She wished these\nmen to leave her out of their plots--but four men are stronger than\none woman. Yet, as her philosophy had it, you may make a woman your\ntool, but she will bend in your hand and strike where she will, for\nall that. Therefore she must plot, but not with them.\n\nAs soon as she could she found the Lady Mary alone, and, setting her\nvalour up against the other's dark and rigid figure, she spoke\nrapidly:\n\nShe would have her lady write to her friends across the sea that, if\nCromwell were ever to fall, they must now stay their hands against the\nKing: they must diminish their bands, discontinue their fortifyings\nand feign even to quarrel amongst themselves. Otherwise the King must\nrest firm in his alliance with Cleves, to counterbalance them.\n\nThe Lady Mary raised her eyebrows with a show of insolent astonishment\nthat was for all the world like the King's.\n\n'You affect my father!' she said. 'Is it not a dainty plan?'\n\nKatharine brushed past her words with:\n\n'It matters little who affects what thing. The main is that Privy Seal\nmust be cast down.'\n\n'Carthage must be destroyed, O Cato,' the Lady Mary sneered. 'Ye are\nperemptory.'\n\n'I am as God made me,' Katharine answered. 'I am for God's Church....'\nShe had a sharp spasm of impatience. 'Here is a thing to do, and the\none and the other snarl like dogs, each for his separate ends.'\n\n'Oh, la, la,' the Lady Mary laughed.\n\n'A Howard is as good as any man,' Katharine said. Her ingenuous face\nflushed, and she moved her hand to her throat. 'God help me: it is\ntrue that I swore to be your woman. But it is the true province of\nyour woman to lead you to work for justice and the truth.'\n\nA black malignancy settled upon the face of the princess.\n\n'I have been called bastard,' she said. 'My mother was done to\ndeath.'\n\n'No true man believes you misbegotten,' Katharine answered hotly.\n\n'Well, it is proclaimed treason, to speak thus,' the Lady Mary\nsneered.\n\n'Neither can you give your sainted mother her life again.' Katharine\nignored her words. 'But these actions were not your father's. It was\nan ill man forced him to them. The saints be good to you; is it not\ntime to forgive a sad man that would make amends? I would have you to\nwrite this letter.'\n\nThe Lady Mary's lips moved into the curves of a tormenting smile.\n\n'You plead your lover's cause main well,' she uttered.\n\nKatharine had another motion of impatience.\n\n'Your cause I plead main better,' she said. 'It is certain that, this\nman once down, your bastardy should be reversed.'\n\n'I do not ask it,' the Lady Mary said.\n\n'But I ask that you give us peace here, so that the King may make\namends to many that he hath sorely wronged. Do you not see that the\nKing inclineth to the Church of God? Do you not see....'\n\n'I see very plainly that I needs must thank you for better housing,'\nMary answered. 'It is certain that my father had never brought me from\nthat well at Isleworth, had it not been that he desireth converse with\nthee at his ease.'\n\nKatharine's lips parted with a hot anger, but before she could speak\nthe bitter girl said calmly:\n\n'Oh, I have not said thou art his leman. I know my father. His blood\nis not hot--but his ears crave tickling. Tickle them whilst thou\nmayest. Have I stayed thee? Have I sent thee from my room when he did\ncome?'\n\nKatharine cast back the purple hood from over her forehead, she\nbrushed her hand across her brow, and made herself calm.\n\n'This is a trifling folly,' she said. 'In two words: will your\nHighness write me this letter?'\n\n'Then, in four words,' Mary answered, 'my Highness cares not.'\n\nThe mobile brows above Katharine's blue eyes made a hard straight\nline.\n\n'An you will not,' she brought out, 'I will leave your Highness'\nservice. I will get me away to Calais, where my father is.'\n\n'Why, you will never do that,' the Lady Mary said; 'you have tasted\nblood here.'\n\nKatharine hung her head and meditated for a space.\n\n'No, before God,' she said earnestly, 'I think you judge me wrong. I\nthink I am not as you think me. I think that I do seek no ends of my\nown.'\n\nThe Lady Mary raised her eyebrows and snickered ironically.\n\n'But of this I am very certain,' Katharine said. She spoke more\nearnestly, seeming to plead: 'If I thought that I were grown a\nself-seeker, by Mars who changed Alectryon to a cock, and by Pallas\nAthene who changed Arachne to a spider--if I were so changed, I would\nget me gone from this place. But here is a thing that I may do. If you\nwill aid me to do it I will stay. If you will not I will get me gone.'\n\n'Good wench,' Mary answered, 'let us say for the sake of peace that\nthou art honest.... Yet I have sworn by other gods than thine that\nnever will I do aught that shall be of aid, comfort or succour to my\nfather's cause.'\n\n'Take back your oaths!' Katharine cried.\n\n'For thee!' Mary said. 'Wench, thou hast brought me food: thou hast\nserved me in the matter of letters. I might only with great trouble\nget another so to serve me. But, by Mars and Pallas and all the\nconstellation of the deities, thou mightest get thee to Hell's flames\nor ever I would take back an oath.'\n\n'Oh, madness,' Katharine cried out. 'Oh, mad frenzy of one whom the\ngods would destroy.' Three times before she had reined in her anger:\nnow she stretched out her hands with her habitual gesture of pitiful\ndespair. Her eyes looked straight before her, and, as she inclined\nher knees, the folds of her grey dress bent round her on the floor.\n\n'Here I have pleaded with you, and you have gibed me with the love of\nthe King. Here I have been earnest with you, and you have mocked. God\nhelp me!' she sobbed, with a catch in her throat. 'Here is rest, peace\nand the blessing of God offered to this land. Here is a province that\nis offered back to the Mother of God and the dear hosts of heaven.\nHere might we bring an erring King back to the right way, a sinful man\nback unto his God. But you, for a parcel of wrongs of your own....'\n\n'Now hold thy peace,' Mary said, between anger and irony. 'Here is a\nmatter of a farthing or two. Be the letter written, and kiss upon it.'\n\nKatharine stayed herself in the tremor of her emotions, and the Lady\nMary said drily:\n\n'Be the letter written. But thou shalt write it. I have sworn that I\nwill do nothing to give this King ease.'\n\n'But my writing....' Katharine began.\n\n'Thou shalt write,' Mary interrupted her harshly. 'If thou wilt have\nthis King at peace for a space that Cromwell may fall, why I am at one\nwith thee. For this King is such a palterer that without this knave at\nhis back I might have had him down ten years ago. Therefore, thou\nshalt write, and I will countersign the words.'\n\n'That were to write thyself,' Katharine said.\n\n'Good wench,' the Lady Mary said. 'I am thy slave: but take what thou\ncanst get.'\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTowards six of the next day young Poins clambered in at Katharine\nHoward's window and stood, pale, dripping with rain and his teeth\nchattering, between Cicely Elliott and her old knight.\n\n'The letter,' he said. 'They have taken thy letter. My advancement is\nat an end!' And he fell upon the floor.\n\nGoing jauntily along the Hampton Street, he had been filled, that\nafternoon, with visions of advancement. Drifts of rain hid the osiers\nacross the river and made the mud ooze in over the laces of his\nshoes. The tall white and black house, where the Emperor's ambassador\nhad his lodgings, leaned in all its newness over the path, and the\nwater from its gutters fell right into the river, making a bridge\nabove a passer's head. The little cookshop, with its feet, as it were,\nin the water, made a small hut nestling down beneath the shadow of the\ngreat house. It was much used by Chapuys' grooms, trencher boys and\njavelin men, because the cook was a Fleming, and had a comfortable\nhand in stewing eels.\n\nNed Poins must pass the ambassador's house in his walk, but in under\nthe dark archway there stood four men sheltering, in grey cloaks that\nreached to their feet. Stepping gingerly on the brick causeway that\nled down to the barge-steps, they came and stood before the young man,\nthree being in a line together and one a little to the side. He hardly\nlooked at them because he was thinking: 'This afternoon I will say to\nmy sister Margot: \"Fifteen letters I have carried for thy great\npersons. I have carried them with secrecy and speed. Now, by Cock, I\nwill be advanced to ancient.\"' He had imagined his sister pleading\nwith him to be patient, and himself stamping with his foot and\nswearing that he would be advanced instantly.\n\nThe solitary one of the four men barred his way, and said:\n\n'No further! You go back with us!'\n\nPoins swung his cape back and touched his sword-hilt.\n\n'You will have your neck stretched if you stay me,' he said.\n\nThe other loosened his cloak which had covered him up to the nose. He\nshowed a mocking mouth, a long red beard that blew aside in a wild\ngust of the weather, and displayed on his breast the lion badge of the\nLord Privy Seal.\n\n'An you will not come you shall be carried!' he said.\n\n'Nick Throckmorton,' Poins answered, 'I will slit thy weazand! I am on\na greater errand than thine.'\n\nIt was strong in his mind that he was bearing a letter for the King's\nHighness. The other three laid hands swiftly upon him, and a wet\ncloak flapped over his head. They had his elbows bound together behind\nhis back before his eyes again had the river and the muddy path to\nlook upon. Throckmorton grinned sardonically, and they forced him\nalong in the mud. The rain fell down; his cloak was gone. And then a\ngreat dread entered into his simple mind. It kept running through his\nhead:\n\n'I was carrying a letter for the King--I was carrying a letter for the\nKing!' but his addled brains would bear his thoughts no further until\nhe was cast loose in the very room of Privy Seal himself. They had\nused him very roughly, and he staggered back against the wall, gasping\nfor breath and weeping with rage and fear.\n\nPrivy Seal stood before the fire; his eyes lifted a little but he said\nnothing at all. Throckmorton took a dagger from the chain round his\nneck, and cut the bag from the boy's girdle. Still smiling\nsardonically, he placed it in Privy Seal's fat hands.\n\n'Here is the great secret,' he said. 'I took it even in the gates of\nChapuys.'\n\nPrivy Seal started a little and cried, 'Ah!' The boy would have\nspoken, but he feared even to cry out; his eyes were starting from his\nhead, and his breath came in great gusts that shook him. Privy Seal\nsat down in a large chair by the fire and considered for a moment.\nThen he slowly drew out the crumpled ball of paper. Here at last he\nheld the Lady Mary utterly in his power; here at last, at the eleventh\nhour, he had a new opportunity to show to the King his vigilance, his\npower, and how necessary he was to the safety of the realm. He had\nbeen beginning to despair; Winchester was to confess the King that\nnight. Now he held them....\n\n'I have been diligent,' Throckmorton said. 'I had had the Lady Mary\nset in the room that has a spy-hole beside a rose in the ceiling. So I\nsaw the writing of this letter.'\n\nCromwell said, 'Ah!' He had pulled the paper apart, smoothed it across\nhis knee, and looked at it attentively. Then he held it close to the\nfire, for no blank paper could trouble the Privy Seal. This was a\nchild's trick at best.\n\nIn the warmth faint lines became visible on the paper; they darkened\nand darkened beneath his intent eyes. Behind his back Throckmorton,\nwith his immense beard and sardonic eyes, rubbed his hands and smiled.\nPrivy Seal's fingers trembled, but he gave no further sign.\n\nSuddenly he cried, 'What!' and then, 'Both women! both....'\n\nHe fell back in the chair, and the sudden quaver of his face, the deep\nbreath that he drew, showed his immense joy.\n\n'God of my heart! Both women!' he said again.\n\nThe rain hurled itself with a great rustling against the casement.\nThough it was so early, it was already nearly dark. Cromwell sat up\nsuddenly and pointed at the boy.\n\n'Take that rat away!' he said. 'Set him in irons, and come back here.'\n\nThrockmorton caught the quivering boy by the ear and led him out at\nthe door. He took him down a small stair that opened behind a curtain.\nAt the stair-foot he pulled open a small, heavy door. He still held\nhis dagger, and he cut the ropes that tied Poins' elbows. With a\nsudden alacrity and a grin of malice he kicked him violently.\n\n'Get you gone to your mistress,' he said.\n\nPoins stood for a moment, wavering on his feet. He slipped miserably\nin the mud of the park, and suddenly he ran. His grey, straining form\ndisappeared round the end of the dark buildings, and then Throckmorton\nwaved a hand at the grey sky and laughed noiselessly. Thomas Cromwell\nwas making notes in his tablets when his spy re-entered the room, with\nthe rain-drops glistening in his beard.\n\n'Here are some notes for you,' Cromwell said. He rose to his feet with\na swift and intense energy. 'I have given you five farms. Now I go to\nthe King.'\n\nThrockmorton spoke gently.\n\n'You are over-eager,' he said. 'It is early to go to the King's\nHighness. We may find much more yet.'\n\n'It is already late,' Cromwell said.\n\n'Sir,' Throckmorton urged, 'consider that the King is much affected to\nthis lady. Consider that this letter contains nothing that is\ntreasonable; rather it urges peace upon the King's enemies.'\n\n'Aye,' said Cromwell; 'but it is written covertly to the King's\nenemies.'\n\n'That, it is true, is a treason,' Throckmorton said; 'but it is very\ncertain that the Lady Mary hath written letters very much more\nhateful. By questioning this boy that we have in gaol, by gaoling this\nLady Katharine--why, we shall put her to the thumbscrews!--by gaol and\nby thumbscrew, we shall gar her to set her hand to another make of\nconfession. Then you may go to the King's Highness.'\n\n'Nick Throckmorton,' Cromwell said, 'Winchester hath to-night the\nKing's ear....'\n\n'Sir,' Throckmorton answered, and a tremble in his calm voice showed\nhis eagerness, 'I beseech you to give my words your thoughts.\nWinchester hath the King's ear for the moment; but I will get you\nletters wherein these ladies shall reveal Winchester for the traitor\nthat we know him to be. Listen to me....' He paused and let his crafty\neyes run over his master's face. 'Let this matter be for an hour. See\nyou, you shall make a warrant to take this Lady Katharine.'\n\nHe paused and appeared to reflect.\n\n'In an hour she shall be here. Give me leave to use my\nthumbscrews....'\n\n'Aye, but Winchester,' Cromwell said.\n\n'Why,' Throckmorton answered confidently, 'in an hour, too, Winchester\nshall be with the King in the King's Privy Chapel. There will be a\nmake of prayers; ten minutes to that. There shall be Gardiner talking\nto the King against your lordship; ten minutes to that. And,\nWinchester being craven, it shall cost him twice ten minutes to come\nto begging your lordship's head of the King, if ever he dare to beg\nit. But he never shall.'\n\nCromwell said, 'Well, well!'\n\n'There we have forty minutes,' Throckmorton said. He licked his lips\nand held his long beard in his hand carefully, as if it had been a\nbird. 'But give me ten minutes to do my will upon this lady's body,\nand ten to write down what she shall confess. Then, if it take your\nlordship ten minutes to dress yourself finely, you shall have still\nten in which you shall show the King how his Winchester is traitor to\nhim.'\n\nCromwell considered for a minute; his lips twitched cautiously the one\nabove the other.\n\n'This is a great matter,' he said. He paused again. 'If this lady\nshould not confess! And it is very certain that the King affects her.'\n\n'Give me ten minutes of her company,' the spy answered.\n\nCromwell considered again.\n\n'You are very certain,' he said; and then:\n\n'Wilt thou stake thy head upon it?'\n\nThrockmorton wagged his beard slowly up and down.\n\n'Thy head and beard!' Cromwell repeated. He struck his hands briskly\ntogether. 'It is thine own asking. God help thee if thou failest!'\n\n'I will lay nothing to your lordship's door,' Throckmorton said\neagerly.\n\n'God knows!' Cromwell said. 'No man that hath served me have I\ndeserted. So it is that no one hath betrayed me. But thou shalt take\nthis lady without warrant from my hand.'\n\nThrockmorton nodded.\n\n'If thou shalt wring avowal from her thou shalt be the wealthiest\ncommoner of England,' Cromwell said. 'But I will not be here. Nay,\nthou shalt take her to thine own rooms. I will not be seen in this\nmatter. And if thou fail....'\n\n'Sir, I stand more sure of my succeeding than ever your lordship\nstood,' Throckmorton answered him.\n\n'It is not I that shall betray thee if thou fail,' Cromwell answered.\n'Get thee gone swiftly....' He took the jewelled badge from his cap\nthat lay on the table. 'Thou hast served me well,' he said; 'take this\nin case I never see thy face again.'\n\n'Oh, you shall see my triumph!' Throckmorton answered.\n\nHe bent himself nearly double as he passed through the door.\n\nCromwell sat down in his great chair, and his eyes gazed at nothing\nthrough the tapestry of his room.\n\n\nIV\n\nIn Katharine Howard's room they had the form of the boy, wet, grey,\nand mud-draggled, lying on the ground between them. Cicely Elliott\nrose in her chair: it was not any part of her nature to succour\nfainting knaves, and she let him stay where he was. Old Rochford\nraised his hands, and cried out to Katharine:\n\n'You have been sending letters again!'\n\nKatharine stood absolutely still. They had taken her letters!\n\nShe neither spoke nor stirred. Slowly, as she remembered that this was\nindeed a treason, that here without doubt was death, that she was\noutwitted, that she was now the chattel of whosoever held her\nletters--as point after point came into her mind, the blood fled from\nher face. Cicely Elliott sat down in her chair again, and whilst the\ntwo sat watching her in the falling dusk they seemed to withdraw\nthemselves from her world of friendship and to become spectators. Ten\nminutes before she would have laughed at this nightmare: it had seemed\nto her impossible that her letters could have been taken. So many had\ngot in safety to their bourne. Now....\n\n'Who has my letter?' she cried.\n\nHow did she know what was to arise: who was to strike the blow: whence\nit would come: what could she still do to palliate its effects? The\nboy lay motionless upon the floor, his face sideways upon the boards.\n\n'Who? Who? Who?' she cried. She wrung her hands, and kneeling, with a\nswift violence shook him by the coat near his neck. His head struck\nthe boards and he fell back, motionless still, and like a dead man.\n\nCicely Elliott looked around her in the darkening room: beside the\nambry there hung a brush of feathers such as they used for the dusting\nof their indoor clothes. She glided and hopped to the brush and back\nto the hearth: thrust the feathers into the coals and stood again, the\nbrush hissing and spluttering, before Katharine on her knees.\n\n'Dust the springald's face,' she tittered.\n\nAt the touch of the hot feathers and the acrid perfume in his\nnostrils, the boy sneezed, stirred and opened his eyes.\n\n'Who has my letter?' Katharine cried.\n\nThe lids opened wide in amazement, he saw her face and suddenly closed\nhis eyes, and lay down with his face to the floor. A spasm of despair\nbrought his knees up to his chin, his cropped yellow head went\nbackwards and forwards upon the boards.\n\n'I have lost my advancement,' he sobbed. 'I have lost my advancement.'\nA smell of strong liquors diffused itself from him.\n\n'Oh beast,' Katharine cried from her knees, 'who hath my letter?'\n\n'I have lost my advancement,' he moaned.\n\nShe sprang from her feet to the fireplace and caught the iron tongs\nwith which they were wont to place pieces of wood upon the fire. She\nstruck him a hard blow upon the arm between the shoulder and elbow.\n\n'Sot!' she cried. 'Tell me! Tell me!'\n\nHe rose to his seat and held his arms to protect his head and eyes.\nWhen he stuttered:\n\n'Nick Throckmorton had it!' her hand fell powerless to her side; but\nwhen he added: 'He gave it to Privy Seal!' she cast the tongs into the\nbrands to save herself from cleaving open his head.\n\n'God!' she said drily, 'you have lost your advancement. And I mine!...\nAnd I mine.'\n\nShe wavered to her chair by the hearth-place, and covered her face\nwith her white hands.\n\nThe boy got to his knees, then to his feet; he staggered backwards\ninto the arras beside the door.\n\n'God's curse on you!' he said. 'Where is Margot? That I may beat her!\nThat I may beat her as you have beaten me.' He waved his hand with a\ntipsy ferocity and staggered through the door.\n\n'Was it for this I did play the ---- for thee?' he menaced her. 'By\nCock! I will swinge that harlot!'\n\nThe old knight got to his feet. He laid his hand heavily upon Cicely\nElliott's shoulder.\n\n'Best begone from here,' he said, 'this is no quarrel of mine or\nthine.'\n\n'Why, get thee gone, old boy,' she laughed over her shoulder. 'Seven\nof my men have been done to death in such like marlocks. I would not\nhave thee die as they did.'\n\n'Come with me,' he said in her ear. 'I have dropped my lance. Never\nshall I ride to horse again. I would not lose thee; art all I have.'\n\n'Why, get thee gone for a brave old boy,' she said. 'I will come ere\nthe last pynot has chattered its last chatter.'\n\n'It is no light matter,' he answered. 'I am Rochford of Bosworth\nHedge. But I have lost lance and horse and manhood. I will not lose my\ndandery thing too.'\n\nKatharine Howard sat, a dark figure in the twilight, with the fire\nshining upon her hands that covered her face. Cicely Elliott looked at\nher and stirred.\n\n'Why,' she said, 'I have lost father and mother and men-folk and\nsister. But my itch to know I will not lose, if I pay my head for the\nprice. I would give a silken gown to know this tale.'\n\nKatharine Howard uncovered her face; it shewed white even in the rays\nof the fire. One finger raised itself to a level with her temple.\n\n'Listen!' she uttered. They heard through the closed door a dull thud,\nmetallic and hard--and another after four great beats of their hearts.\n\n'Pikestaves!' the old knight groaned. His mouth fell open. Katharine\nHoward shrieked; she sprang to the clothes press, to the window--and\nthen to the shadows beside the fireplace where she cowered and sobbed.\nThe door swung back: a great man stood in the half light and cried\nout:\n\n'The Lady Katharine Howard.'\n\nThe old knight raised his hands above his head--but Cicely Elliott\nturned her back to the fire.\n\n'What would you with me?' she asked. Her face was all in shadows.\n\n'I have a warrant to take the Lady Katharine.'\n\nCicely Elliott screamed out:\n\n'Me! Me! Ah God! ah God!'\n\nShe shrank back; she waved her hands, then suddenly she caught at the\ncoif above her head and pulled forward the tail of her hood till, like\na veil, it covered her face.\n\n'Let me not be seen!' she uttered hoarsely.\n\nThe old knight's impatient desires burst through his terror.\n\n'Nick Throckmorton,' he bleated, 'yon mad wench of mine....'\n\nBut the large man cut in on his words with a harsh and peremptory\nvehemence.\n\n'It is very dark. You cannot see who I be. Thank your God I cannot see\nwhether you be a man who fought by a hedge or no. There shall be\nreports written of this. Hold your peace.'\n\nNevertheless the old man made a spluttering noise of one about to\nspeak.\n\n'Hold your peace,' Throckmorton said roughly, again, 'I cannot see\nyour face. Can you walk, madam, and very fast?'\n\nHe caught her roughly by the wrist and they passed out, twin blots of\ndarkness, at the doorway. The clank of the pike-staves sounded on the\nboards without, and old Rochford was tearing at his white hairs in the\nlittle light from the fire.\n\nKatharine Howard ran swiftly from the shadow of the fireplace.\n\n'Give me time, till they have passed the stairhead,' she whispered.\n'For pity! for pity.'\n\n'For pity,' he muttered. 'This is to stake one's last years upon\nwoman.' He turned upon her, and his white face and pale blue eyes\nglinted at her hatefully.\n\n'What pity had Cicely Elliott upon me then?'\n\n'Till they are out of the gate,' she pleaded, 'that I may get me\ngone.'\n\nAt her back she was cut off from the night and the rain by a black\nrange of corridors. She had never been through them because they led\nto rooms of men that she did not know. But, down the passage and down\nthe stairway was the only exit to the rest of the palace and the air.\nShe threw open her press so that the hinges cracked. She caught her\ncloak and she caught her hood. She had nowhither to run--but there she\nwas at the end of a large trap. Their footsteps as they receded echoed\nand whispered up the stairway from below.\n\n'For pity!' she pleaded. 'For pity! I will go miles away before it is\nmorning.'\n\nHe had been wavering on his feet, torn backwards and forwards\nliterally and visibly, between desire and fear, but at the sound of\nher voice he shook with rage.\n\n'Curses on you that ever you came here,' he said. 'If you go free I\nshall lose my dandling thing.'\n\nHe made as if to catch her by the wrist; but changing his purpose, ran\nfrom the room, shouting:\n\n'Ho la!... Throck ... morton ... That ... is not....' His voice was\nlost in reverberations and echoes.\n\nIn the darkness she stood desolately still. She thought of how Romans\nwould have awaited their captors: the ideal of a still and worthy\nsurrender was part of her blood. Here was the end of her cord; she\nmust fold her hands. She folded her hands. After all, she thought,\nwhat was death?\n\n'It is to pass from the hardly known to the hardly unknown.' She\nquoted Lucretius. It was very dark all around her: the noises of\ndistant outcries reached her dimly.\n\n'_Vix ignotum_,' she repeated mechanically, and then the words:\n'Surely it were better to pass from the world of unjust judges to sit\nwith the mighty....'\n\nA great burst of sound roamed, vivid and alive, from the distant\nstairhead. She started and cried out. Then there came the sound of\nfeet hastily stepping the stair treads, coming upwards. A man was\ncoming to lay hands upon her!\n\nThen, suddenly she was running, breathing hard, filled with the fear\nof a man's touch. At last, in front of her was a pale, leaded window;\nshe turned to the right; she was in a long corridor; she ran; it\nseemed that she ran for miles. She was gasping, 'For pity! for pity!'\nto the saints of heaven. She stayed to listen; there was a silence,\nthen a voice in the distance. She listened and listened. The feet\nbegan to run again, the sole of one shoe struck the ground hard, the\nother scarcely sounded. She could not tell whether they came towards\nher or no. Then she began to run again, for it was certain now that\nthey came towards her. As if at the sound of her own feet the\nfootfalls came faster. Desperately, she lifted one foot and tore her\nshoe off, then the other. She half overbalanced, and catching at the\narras to save herself, it fell with a rustling sound. She craved for\ndarkness; when she ran there was a pale shimmer of night--but the\naperture of an arch tempted her. She ran and sprang, upwards, in a\nvery black, narrow stairway.\n\nAt the top there was--light! and the passage ended in a window. A\ngreat way off, a pine torch was stuck in a wall, a knave in armour sat\non the floor beneath it--the heavy breathing was coming up the\nstairway. She crept on tiptoe across the passage to the curtains\nbeside the casement.\n\nThen a man was within touch of her hand, panting hard, and he stood\nstill as if he were out of breath. His voice called in gasps to the\nknave at the end of the gallery:\n\n'Ho ... There ... Simon!... Peter!... Hath one passed that way?'\n\nThe voice came back:\n\n'No one! The King comes!'\n\nHe moved a step down the corridor and, as he was lifting the arras a\nlittle way away, she moved to peep through a crack in the curtain.\n\nIt was Throckmorton! The distant light glinted along his beard. At the\nslight movement she made he was agog to listen, so that his ears\nappeared to be pricked up. He moved swiftly back to cover the\nstairhead. In the distance, beneath the light, the groom was laying\ncards upon the floor between his parted legs.\n\nThrockmorton whispered suddenly:\n\n'I can hear thee breathe. Art near! Listen!'\n\nShe leant back against the wall and trembled.\n\n'This seems like a treachery,' he whispered. 'It is none. Listen?\nThere is little time! Do you hear me?'\n\nShe kept her peace.\n\n'Do you hear me?' he asked. 'Before God, I am true to you.'\n\nWhen still she did not speak he hissed with vexation and raised one\nhand above his head. He sank his forehead in swift meditation.\n\n'Listen,' he said again. 'To take you I have only to tear down this\narras. Do you hear?'\n\nHe bared his head once more and said aloud to himself,\n\n'But perhaps she is even in the chapel.'\n\nHe stepped across the corridor, lifted a latch and looked in at double\ndoors that were just beside her. Then, swiftly, he moved back once\nmore to cover the stairhead.\n\n'God! God! God!' she heard him mutter between his teeth.\n\n'Listen!' he said again. 'Listen! listen! listen!' The words seemed\nto form part of an eager, hissed refrain. He was trembling with haste.\n\nHe began to press the arras, along the wall towards her, with his\nfinger tips. Her breast sank with a sickening fall. Then, suddenly, he\nstarted back again; she could not understand why he did not come\nfurther--then she noticed that he was afraid, still, to leave the\nstairhead.\n\nBut why did he not call his men to him? He had a whole army at his\nback.\n\nHe was peering into the shadows--and something familiar in the poise\nof his head, his intent gaze, the line of his shoulders, as you may\nsee a cat's outlined against a lighted doorway, filled her with an\nintense lust for revenge. This man had wormed himself into her\npresence: he was a traitor over and over again. And he had fooled her!\nHe had made her believe that he was lover to her. He had made her\nbelieve, and he had fooled her. He had shown her letter to Privy Seal.\n\nAfter the night in the cellar she had had the end of her crucifix\nsharpened till it was needle-pointed. She trembled with eagerness.\nThis foul carrion beast had fooled her that he might get her more\nutterly in his power. For this he had brought her down. He would have\nher to himself--in some dungeon of Privy Seal's. Her fair hopes ended\nin this filth....\n\nHe was muttering:\n\n'Listen if you be there! Before God, Katharine Howard, I am true to\nyou. Listen! Listen!'\n\nHis hand shivered, turned against the light. He was hearkening to some\ndistant sound. He was looking away.\n\nShe tore the arras aside and sprang at him with her hand on high. But,\nat the sharp sound of the tearing cloth, he started to one side and\nthe needle point that should have pierced his face struck softly in at\nhis shoulder or thereabouts. He gave a sharp hiss of pain....\n\nShe was wrestling with him then. One of his hands was hot across her\nmouth, the other held her throat.\n\n'Oh fool!' his voice sounded. 'Bide you still.' He snorted with fury\nand held her to him. The embroidery on his chest scraped her knuckles\nas she tried to strike upwards at his face. Her crucifix had fallen.\nHe strove to muffle her with his elbows, but with a blind rage of\nstruggle she freed her wrists and, in the darkness, struck where she\nthought his mouth would be.\n\nThen his hand over her mouth loosened and set free her great scream.\nIt rang down the corridor and seemed to petrify his grasp upon her.\nHis fingers loosened--and again she was running, bent forward, crying\nout, in a vast thirst for mere flight.\n\nAs she ran, a red patch before her eyes, distant and clear beneath the\ntorch, took the form of the King. Her cries were still loud, but they\ndied in her throat....\n\nHe was standing still with his fingers in his ears.\n\n'Dear God,' she cried, 'they have laid hands upon me. They have laid\nhands upon me.' And she pressed her fingers hard across her throat as\nif to wipe away the stain of Throckmorton's touch.\n\nThe King lifted his fingers from his ears.\n\n'Bones of Jago,' he cried, 'what new whimsy is this?'\n\n'They have laid hands upon me,' she cried and fell upon her knees.\n\n'Why,' he said, 'here is a day nightmare. I know all your tale of a\nletter. Come now, pretty one. Up, pretty soul.' He bent over\nbenevolently and stroked her hand.\n\n'These dark passages are frightening to maids. Up now, pretty. I was\nthinking of thee.\n\n'Who the devil shall harm thee?' he muttered again. 'This is mine own\nhouse. Come, pray with me. Prayer is a very soothing thing. I was\nbound to pray. I pray ever at nightfall. Up now. Come--pray, pray,\npray!'\n\nHis heavy benevolence for a moment shed a calmness upon the place. She\nrose, and pressing back the hair from her forehead, saw the long,\nstill corridor, the guard beneath the torch, the doors of the chapel.\n\nShe said to herself pitifully: 'What comes next?' She was too wearied\nto move again.\n\nSuddenly the King said:\n\n'Child, you did well to come to me, when you came in the stables.'\n\nShe leaned against the tapestry upon the wall to listen to him.\n\n'It is true,' he admitted, 'that you have men that hate you and your\nhouse. The Bishop of Winchester did show me a letter you wrote. I do\npardon it in you. It was well written.'\n\n'Ah,' she uttered wearily, 'so you say now. But you shall change your\nmind ere morning.'\n\n'Body of God, no,' he answered. 'My mind is made up concerning you.\nLet us call a truce to these things. It is my hour for prayer. Let us\ngo to pray.'\n\nKnowing how this King's mind would change from hour to hour, she had\nlittle hope in his words. Nevertheless slowly it came into her mind\nthat if she were ever to act, now that he was in the mood was the very\nhour. But she knew nothing of the coil in which she now was. Yet\nwithout the King she could do nothing; she was in the hands of other\nmen: of Throckmorton, of Privy Seal, of God knew whom.\n\n'Sir,' she said, 'at the end of this passage stood a man.'\n\nThe King looked past her into the gloom.\n\n'He stands there still,' he said. 'He is tying his arm with a\nkerchief. He looks like one Throckmorton.'\n\n'Then, if he have not run,' she said. 'Call him here. He has had my\nknife in his arm. He holds a letter of mine.'\n\nHis neck stiffened suddenly.\n\n'You have been writing amorous epistles?' he muttered.\n\n'God knows there was naught of love,' she answered. 'Do you bid him\nunpouch it.' She closed her eyes; she was done with this matter.\n\nHenry called:\n\n'Ho, you, approach!' and as through the shadows Throckmorton's shoes\nclattered on the boards he held out a thickly gloved hand.\nThrockmorton made no motion to put anything into it, and the King\nneeds must speak.\n\n'This lady's letter,' he muttered.\n\nThrockmorton bowed his head.\n\n'Privy Seal holdeth it,' he answered.\n\n'You are all of a make,' the King said gloomily. 'Can no woman write a\nletter but what you will be of it?'\n\n'Sir,' Throckmorton said, 'this lady would have Privy Seal down.'\n\n'Well, she shall have him down,' the King threatened him. 'And thee!\nand all of thy train!'\n\n'I do lose much blood,' Throckmorton answered. 'Pray you let me finish\nthe binding of my arm.'\n\nHe took between his teeth one end of his kerchief and the other in his\nright hand, and pulled and knotted with his head bent.\n\n'Make haste!' the King grumbled. 'Here! Lend room.' And himself he\ntook one end of the knot and pulled it tight, breathing heavily.\n\n'Now speak,' he said. 'I am not one made for the healing of cripples.'\n\nThrockmorton brushed the black blood from the furs on his sleeve,\nusing his gloves.\n\n'Sir,' he said, 'I am in pain and my knees tremble, because I have\nlost much blood. I were more minded to take to my pallet.\nNevertheless, I am a man that do bear no grudge, being rather a very\nproper man, and one intent to do well to my country and its Lord.'\n\n'Sir,' the King said, 'if you are minded to speak ill of this lady you\nhad best had no mouth.'\n\nThrockmorton fell upon one knee.\n\n'Grant me the boon to be her advocate,' he said. 'And let me speak\nswiftly, for Privy Seal shall come soon and the Bishop of Winchester.'\n\n'Ass that you are,' the King said, 'fetch me a stool from the chapel,\nthat I may not stand all the day.'\n\nThrockmorton ran swiftly to the folding doors.\n\n'--Winchester comes,' he said hurriedly, when he returned.\n\nThe King sat himself gingerly down upon the three-legged stool,\nbalancing himself with his legs wide apart. A dark face peered from\nthe folding doors: a priest's shape came out from them.\n\n'Cousin of Winchester,' the King called, 'bide where you be.'\n\nHe had the air of a man hardly intent on what the spy could say. He\nhad already made up his mind as to what he himself was to say to\nKatharine.\n\n'Sir,' Throckmorton said, 'this lady loves you well, and most well she\nloveth your Highness' daughter. Most well, therefore, doth she hate\nPrivy Seal. I, as your Highness knoweth, have for long well loved\nPrivy Seal. Now I love others better--the common weal and your great\nand beneficent Highness. As I have told your Highness, this Lady\nKatharine hath laboured very heartily to bring the Lady Mary to love\nyou. But that might not be. Now, your Highness being minded to give to\nthese your happy realms a lasting peace, was intent that the Lady Mary\nshould write a letter, very urgently, to your Highness' foes urging\nthem to make a truce with this realm, so that your Highness might cast\nout certain evil men and then better purge this realm of certain false\ndoctrines.'\n\nAmazement, that was almost a horror, made Katharine open wide the two\nhands that hung at her side.\n\n'You!' she cried to the King. '_You_ would have that letter written?'\n\nHe looked at her with a heavy astonishment.\n\n'Wherefore not?' he asked.\n\n'My God! my God!' she said. 'And I have suffered!'\n\nHer first feeling of horror at this endless plot hardly gave way to\nrelief. She had been used as a tool; she had done the work. But she\nhad been betrayed.\n\n'Aye, would I have the letter written,' the King said. 'What could\nbetter serve my turn? Would I not have mine enemies stay their arming\nagainst me?'\n\n'Then I have written your letter,' she said bitterly. 'That is why I\nshould be gaoled.'\n\nThe King's look of heavy astonishment did not leave him.\n\n'Why, sweetheart, shalt be made a countess,' he said. 'Y' have done\nmore in this than I or any man could do with my daughter.'\n\n'Wherefore, then, should this man have gaoled me?' Katharine asked.\n\nThe King turned his heavy gaze upon Throckmorton. The big man's eyes\nhad a sunny and devious smile.\n\n'Sir,' he said, 'this is a subtle conceit of mine, since I am a subtle\nman. If I am set a task I do it ever in mine own way. Here there was a\ntask....\n\n'Pray you let me sit upon the floor!' he craved. 'My legs begin to\nfail.'\n\nThe King made a small motion with his hand, and the great man, letting\nhimself down by one hand against the arras, leaned back his head and\nstretched his long legs half across the corridor.\n\n'In ten minutes Privy Seal shall be here with the letter,' he said.\n'My head swims, but I will be brief.'\n\nHe closed his eyes and passed his hand across his forehead.\n\n'I do a task ever in mine own way,' he began again. 'Here am I. Here\nis Privy Seal. Your Highness is minded to know what passes in the mind\nof Privy Seal. Well: I am Privy Seal's servant. Now, if I am to come\nat the mind of Privy Seal, I must serve him well. In this thing I\nmight seem to serve him main well. Listen....'\n\nHe cleared his throat and then spoke again.\n\n'Your Highness would have this letter written by the Lady Mary. That,\nwith the help of this fair dame, was a thing passing easy. But neither\nyour Highness nor Privy Seal knew the channel through which these\nletters passed. Yet I discovered it. Now, think I to myself: here is a\nsecret for which Privy Seal would give his head. Therefore, how better\nmay I ingratiate myself with Privy Seal than by telling him this same\nfine secret?'\n\n'Oh, devil!' Katharine Howard called out. 'Who was Judas to thee?'\n\nThrockmorton raised his head, and winked upwards at her.\n\n'It was a fine device?' he asked. 'Why, I am a subtle man.... Do you\nnot see?' he said. 'The King's Highness would have me keep the\nconfidence of Privy Seal that I may learn out his secrets. How better\nshould I keep that confidence than by seeming to betray your secret to\nPrivy Seal?\n\n'It was very certain,' he added, 'that Privy Seal should give a\nwarrant to gaol your la'ship. But it was still more certain that the\nKing's Highness should pardon you. Therefore no bones should have been\nbroken. And I did come myself to take you to a safe place, and to\nenlighten you as to the comedy.'\n\n'Oh, Judas, Judas,' she cried.\n\n'Could you but have trusted me,' he said reproachfully, 'you had\nspared yourself a mad canter and me a maimed arm.'\n\n'Why, you have done well,' the King said heavily. 'But you speak this\nlady too saucily.'\n\nHe was in a high and ponderous good humour, but he stayed to reflect\nfor a moment, with his head on one side, to see what he had gained.\n\n'This letter is written,' he said. 'But Cromwell holdeth it. How,\nthen, has it profited me?'\n\n'Why,' Throckmorton said, 'Privy Seal shall come to bring the letter\nto your Highness; your Highness shall deliver it to me; I to the cook;\nthe cook to the ambassador; the ambassador to the kings. And so the\nkings shall be prayed, by your daughter, whom they heed, to stay all\nunfriendly hands against your Highness.'\n\n'You are a shrewd fellow,' the King said.\n\n'I have a shrewd ache in the head,' the spy answered. 'If you would\ngive me a boon, let me begone.'\n\nThe King got stiffly up from his stool, and, bracing his feet firmly,\ngave the spy one hand. The tall man shook upon his legs.\n\n'Why, I have done well!' he said, smiling. 'Now Privy Seal shall take\nme for his very bedfellow, until it shall please your Highness to deal\nwith him for good and all.'\n\nHe went, waveringly, along the corridor, brushing the hangings with\nhis shoulder.\n\nKatharine stood out before the King.\n\n'Now I will get me gone,' she said. 'This is no place for me.'\n\nHe surveyed her amiably, resting his hands on his red-clothed thighs\nas he sat his legs akimbo on his stool.\n\n'Why, it is main cold here,' he said. 'But bide a short space.'\n\n'I am not made for courts,' she answered.\n\n'We will go pray anon,' he quieted her, with his hand stretched out.\n'Give me a space for meditation, I am not yet in the mood for prayer.'\n\nShe pleaded, 'Let me begone.'\n\n'Body of God,' he said good-humouredly. 'It is fitting that at this\ntime that you do pray. You have escaped a great peril. But I am wont\nto drive away earthly passions ere I come before the Throne of grace.'\n\n'Sir,' she pleaded more urgently, 'the night draws near. Before\nmorning I would be upon my road to Calais.'\n\nHe looked at her interestedly, and questioned in a peremptory voice:\n\n'Upon what errand? I have heard of no journeying of yours.'\n\n'I am not made for courts,' she repeated.\n\nHe said: 'Anan?' with a sudden, half-comprehending anger, and she\nquailed.\n\n'I will get me gone to Calais,' she uttered. 'And then to a nunnery. I\nam not for this world.'\n\nHe uttered a tremendous: 'Body of God,' and repeated it four times.\n\nHe sprang to his feet and she shrank against the wall. His eyes rolled\nin his great head, and suddenly he shouted:\n\n'Ungrateful child. Ungrateful!' Then he lost words; his swollen brow\nmoved up and down. She was afraid to speak again.\n\nThen, suddenly, with a light and brushing step, the Lord Privy Seal\nwas coming towards them. His sagacious eyes looked from one to the\nother, his lips moved with their sideways motion.\n\n'Fiend,' the King uttered. 'Give me the letter and get thee out of\nearshot.' And whilst Cromwell was bending before his person, he\ncontinued: 'I have pardoned this lady. I would have you both clasp\nhands.'\n\nCromwell's mouth fell open for a minute.\n\n'Your Highness knoweth the contents?' he asked. And by then he\nappeared as calm as when he asked a question about the price of chalk\nat Calais.\n\n'My Highness knoweth!' Henry said friendlily. He crumpled the letter\nin his hand, and then, remembering its use, moved to put it in his own\npouch. 'This lady has done very well to speak to me who am the\nfountainhead of power.'\n\n'Get thee out of earshot,' he repeated. 'I have things as to which I\nwould admonish this lady.'\n\n'Your Highness knoweth....' Privy Seal began again, then his eye fell\nupon Winchester, who still stayed by the chapel door at the far end of\nthe corridor. He threw up his hands.\n\n'Sir,' he said. 'Traitors have come to you!'\n\nGardiner, indeed, was gliding towards them, drawn, in spite of all\nprudence, by his invincible hatred.\n\nThe King watched the pair of them with his crafty eyes, deep seated in\nhis head.\n\n'It is certain that no traitors have come to me,' he uttered gently;\nand to Cromwell: 'You have a nose for them.'\n\nHe appeared placable and was very quiet.\n\nWinchester, his black eyes glaring with desire, was almost upon them\nin the shadows.\n\n'Here is enough of wrangling,' Henry said. He appeared to meditate,\nand then uttered: 'As well here as elsewhere.'\n\n'Sir,' Gardiner said, 'if Privy Seal misleads me, I have somewhat to\nsay of Privy Seal.'\n\n'Cousin of Winchester,' Henry answered. 'Stretch out your hand, I\nwould have you end your tulzies in this place.'\n\nWinchester, bringing out his words with a snake's coldness, seemed to\nwhisper:\n\n'Your Highness did promise that Privy Seal should make me amends.'\n\n'Why, Privy Seal shall make amends,' the King answered. 'It was his\nman that did miscall thee. Therefore, Privy Seal shall come to dine\nwith thee, and shall, in the presence of all men, hold out to thee his\nhand.'\n\n'Let him come, then, with great state,' the bishop stuck to his note.\n\n'Aye, with a great state,' the King answered. 'I will have an end to\nthese quarrels.'\n\nHe set his hand cordially upon Privy Seal's shoulder.\n\n'For thee,' he said, 'I would have thee think between now and the\nassembling of the Parliaments of what title thou wilt have to an\nearldom.'\n\nCromwell fell upon one knee, and, in Latin, made three words of a\nspeech of thanks.\n\n'Why, good man,' the King said, 'art a man very valuable to me.' His\neyes rested upon Katharine for a moment. 'I am well watched for by one\nand the other of you,' he went on. 'Each of you by now has brought me\na letter of this lady's.'\n\nKatharine cried out at Gardiner:\n\n'You too!'\n\nHis eyes sought the ground, and then looked defiantly into hers.\n\n'You did threaten me!' he said doggedly. 'I was minded to be betimes.'\n\n'Why, end it all, now and here,' the King said. 'Here is a folly with\na silly wench in it.'\n\n'Here was a treason that I would show your Highness,' the Bishop said\ndoggedly.\n\n'Sirs,' the King said. He touched his bonnet: 'God in His great mercy\nhas seen fit much to trouble me. But here are troubles that I may end.\nNow I have ended them all. If this lady would not have her cousin to\nmurder a cardinal, God, she would not. There are a plenty others to do\nthat work.'\n\nHe pressed one hand on Cromwell's chest and pushed him backwards\ngently.\n\n'Get thee gone, now,' he said, 'out of earshot. I shall speak with\nthee soon.--And you!' he added to Winchester.\n\n'Body of God, Body of God,' he muttered beneath his breath, as they\nwent, 'very soon now I can rid me of these knaves,' and then,\nsuddenly, he blared upon Katharine:\n\n'Thou seest how I am plagued and would'st leave me. Before the Most\nHigh God, I swear thou shalt not.'\n\nShe fell upon her knees.\n\n'With each that speaks, I find a new traitor to me,' she said. 'Let me\nbegone.'\n\nHe threatened her with one hand.\n\n'Wench,' he said, 'I have had better converse with thee than with man\nor child this several years. Thinkest thou I will let thee go?'\n\nShe began to sob:\n\n'What rest may I have? What rest?'\n\nHe mocked her:\n\n'What rest may I have? What rest? My nights are full of evil dreams!\nGod help me. Have I offered thee foul usage? Have I pursued thee with\namorous suits?'\n\nShe said pitifully:\n\n'You had better have done that than set me amongst these plotters.'\n\n'I have never seen a woman so goodly to look upon as thou art,' he\nanswered.\n\nShe covered her face with her hands, but he pulled them apart and\ngazed at it.\n\n'Child,' he said, 'I will cherish thee as I would a young lamb. Shalt\nhave Cromwell's head; shalt have Winchester in what gaol thou wilt\nwhen I have used them.'\n\nShe put her fingers in her ears.\n\n'For pity,' she whispered. 'Let me begone.'\n\n'Why,' he reasoned with her, 'I cannot let thee have Cromwell down\nbefore he has called this Parliament. There is no man like him for\ncalling of truckling Parliaments. And, rest assured,' he uttered\nsolemnly, 'that that man dies that comes between thee and me from this\nday on.'\n\n'Let me begone,' she said wearily. 'Let me begone. I am afraid to look\nupon these happenings.'\n\n'Look then upon nothing,' he answered. 'Stay you by my daughter's\nside. Even yet you shall win for me her obedience. If you shall earn\nthe love of the dear saints, I will much honour you and set you on\nhigh before all the land.'\n\nShe said:\n\n'For pity, for pity. Here is a too great danger for my soul.'\n\n'Never, never,' he answered. 'You shall live closed in. No man shall\nspeak with you but only I. You shall be as you were in a cloister. An\nyou will, you shall have great wealth. Your house shall be advanced;\nyour father close his eyes in honour and estate. None shall walk\nbefore you in the land.'\n\nShe said: 'No. No.'\n\n'See you,' he said. 'This world goes very wearily with me. I am upon a\nmake of husbandry that bringeth little joy. I have no rest, no music,\nno corner to hide in save in thy converse and the regard of thy\ncountenance.'\n\nHe paused to search her face with his narrow eyes.\n\n'God knows that the Queen there is is no wife of mine,' he said\nslowly. 'If thou wilt wait till the accomplished time....'\n\nShe said:\n\n'No, no!' and her voice had an urgent sharpness.\n\nShe stretched out both her hands, being still upon her knees. Her fair\nface worked convulsively, her lips moved, and her hood, falling away\nfrom her brows, showed her hair that had golden glints.\n\n'For pity let me go,' she moaned. 'For pity.'\n\nHe answered:\n\n'When I renounce my kingdom and my life!'\n\nFrom opposite ends of the gallery Winchester and Cromwell watched them\nwith intent and winking eyes.\n\n'Let us go pray,' the King said. 'For now I am in the mood.'\n\nShe got upon her legs wearily, and, for a moment, took his hand to\nsteady herself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Fifth Queen, by Ford Madox Ford\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FIFTH QUEEN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30188-8.txt or 30188-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/0\/1\/8\/30188\/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Suzanne Shell, and the\nOnline Distributed Proofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":330,"split":"train"}
