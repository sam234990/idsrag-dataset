{"ori_id":"8b9bb18676d9e322b4348f46fbf856107a645db3","title":"The False One","context":"The False One\n The dramatists chose to portray only the beginning of the story of Caesar and Cleopatra in their play; they concentrate on the events of 48 BC. The play is set in Egypt; at its start, the Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII has sequestered his sister\/wife\/queen Cleopatra and has assumed sole rule of the kingdom, and the Battle of Pharsalia has not yet occurred. By the play's end, Caesar has deposed Ptolemy and placed Cleopatra in sole possession of the Egyptian crown. The play's Prologue specifically states that the work shows a virginal \"Young Cleopatra...and her great Mind \/ Express'd to the height....\" Some of the famous aspects of the story are reproduced in the play: Cleopatra has herself delivered to Caesar in Act III, though enclosed in a \"packet\" rather than rolled up in a rug.\nThe playwrights chose to concentrate much of their attention on the figure of Lucius Septimius, the Roman officer who betrayed, murdered, and decapitated Pompey the Great when Pompey landed in Egypt after his Pharsalia defeat (events depicted in Act II). Septimius is the \"false one\" of the title, and his prominence comes close to turning the work into a \"villain play.\" Yet Septimius is portrayed as lacking any redeeming or sympathetic quality, making him a weak prop on which to mount a drama. The authors' choice in this matter may have been dictated by their desire to comment on contemporaneous political events; in this interpretation, the Pompey of the play represents Sir Walter Raleigh, executed in 1618, while the loathsome reprobate Septimius stands for Raleigh's primary accuser, Sir Lewis Stukeley.\nCritics have seen the influence of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra in The False One, and have suggested that the portrayal of Septimius was partially modelled on Shakespeare's Enobarbus. The False One is heavily dominated by political material, rather than dramatic realisations of its characters; for some critics, the split in the play's focus among Cleopatra, Caesar, and Septimius prevents the play from cohering into an effective dramatic whole.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The False One, by Francis Beaumont and John\nFletcher, Edited by Arnold Glover\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

My Queen, my Mistress!\n\n  _Ars._ Can you stand unmov'd\n  When the Earth-quake of Rebellion shakes the City,\n  And the Court trembles?\n\n  _Cleo._ Yes, _Arsino_,\n  And with a Masculine Constancy deride\n  Fortunes worst malice, as a Servant to\n  My Vertues, not a Mistress; then we forsake\n  The strong Fort of our selves, when we once yield,\n  Or shrink at her assaults; I am still my self,\n  And though disrob'd of Soveraignty, and ravish'd\n  Of ceremonious duty, that attends it,\n  Nay, grant they had slav'd my Body, my free mind\n  Like to the Palm-tree walling fruitful _Nile_,\n  Shall grow up straighter and enlarge it self\n  'Spight of the envious weight that loads it with:\n  Think of thy Birth (_Arsino_) common burdens\n  Fit common Shoulders; teach the multitude\n  By suffering nobly what they fear to touch at;\n  The greatness of thy mind does soar a pitch,\n  Their dim eyes (darkened by their narrow souls)\n  Cannot arrive at.\n\n  _Ars._ I am new created,\n  And owe this second being to you (best Sister)\n  For now I feel you have infus'd into me\n  Part of your fortitude.\n\n  _Eros_. I still am fearful;\n  I dare not tell a lie; you that were born\n  Daughters and Sisters unto Kings, may nourish\n  Great thoughts, which I, that am your humble handmaid\n  Must not presume to rival.\n\n  _Cleo._ Yet (my _Eros_)\n  Though thou hast profited nothing by observing\n  The whole course of my life, learn in my death,\n  Though not to equal, yet to imitate\n  Thy fearless Mistress.\n\n    _Enter_ Photinus.\n\n  _Eros_. O, a man in Arms!\n  His Weapon drawn too?\n\n  _Cleo._ Though upon the point\n  Death sate, I'll meet it, and outdare the danger.\n\n  _Pho._ Keep the Watch strong, and guard the passage sure\n  That leads unto the Sea.\n\n  _Cleo._ What Sea of rudeness\n  Breaks in upon us? or what Subjects Breath\n  Dare raise a storm, when we command a calm?\n  Are Duty and Obedience fled to Heaven?\n  And in their room ambition and pride\n  Sent into _Egypt_? That Face speaks thee, _Photinus_,\n  A thing thy Mother brought into the World;\n  My Brother's and my Slave: but thy behaviour,\n  Oppos'd to that, an insolent intruder\n  Upon that Soveraignty thou shouldst bow to.\n  If in the Gulph of base ingratitude,\n  All loyalty to _Ptolomy_ the King\n  Be swallowed up, remember who I am,\n  Whose Daughter and whose Sister; or suppose\n  That is forgot too; let the name of _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_\n  Which Nations quake at, stop the desperate madness\n  From running headlong on to thy Confusion.\n  Throw from thee quickly those rebellious Arms,\n  And let me read submission in thine Eyes;\n  Thy wrongs to us we will not only pardon,\n  But be a ready advocate to plead for thee\n  To _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_, and my Brother.\n\n  _Pho._ Plead my Pardon?\n  To you I bow, but scorn as much to stoop thus\n  To _Ptolomy_ or _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_, Nay, the gods,\n  As to put off the figure of a man,\n  And change my Essence with a sensual Beast;\n  All my designs, my counsels, and dark ends\n  Were aim'd to purchase you.\n\n  _Cleo._ How durst thou, being\n  The scorn of baseness, nourish such a thought?\n\n  _Pho._ They that have power are royal; and those base\n  That live at the devotion of another.\n  What birth gave _Ptolomy_, or fortune _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_,\n  By Engines fashion'd in this _Protean_ Anvil\n  I have made mine; and only stoop at you,\n  Whom I would still preserve free to command me;\n  For _C\u00c3\u00a6sar's_ frowns, they are below my thoughts,\n  And but in these fair Eyes I still have read\n  The story of a supream Monarchy,\n  To which all hearts with mine gladly pay tribute,\n  _Photinus's_ Name had long since been as great\n  As _Ptolomies_ e'r was, or _C\u00c3\u00a6sars_ is,\n  This made me as a weaker tye to unloose\n  The knot of Loyalty, that chain'd my freedom,\n  And slight the fear that _C\u00c3\u00a6sars_ threats might cause,\n  That I and they might see no Sun appear\n  But _Cleopatra_ in the _Egyptian_ Sphear.\n\n  _Cleo._ O Giant-like Ambition! marryed to\n  _Cymmerian_ darkness! inconsiderate Fool,\n  (Though flatter'd with self-love) could'st thou believe,\n  Were all Crowns on the Earth made into one,\n  And that (by Kings) set on thy head; all Scepters,\n  Within thy grasp, and laid down at my feet,\n  I would vouchsafe a kiss to a no-man?\n  A guelded Eunuch?\n\n  _Pho._ Fairest, that makes for me,\n  And shews it is no sensual appetite,\n  But true love to the greatness of thy Spirit,\n  That when that you are mine shall yield me pleasures,\n  _Hymen_, though blessing a new married Pair\n  Shall blush to think on, and our certain issue,\n  The glorious splendor of dread Majesty,\n  Whose beams shall dazel _Rome_, and aw the world,\n  My wants in that kind others shall supply,\n  And I give way to it.\n\n  _Cleo._ Baser than thy Birth;\n  Can there be gods, and hear this, and no thunder\n  Ram thee into the Earth?\n\n  _Pho._ They are asleep,\n  And cannot hear thee;\n  Or with open Eyes,\n  Did _Jove_ look on us, I would laugh and swear\n  That his artillery is cloy'd by me:\n  Or if that they have power to hurt, his Bolts\n  Are in my hand.\n\n  _Cleo._ Most impious!\n\n  _Pho._ They are dreams,\n  Religious Fools shake at: yet to assure thee,\n  If _Nemesis_, that scourges pride and scorn,\n  Be any thing but a name, she lives in me;\n  For by my self (an oath to me more dreadful\n  Than _Stix_ is to your gods) weak _Ptolomy_ dead,\n  And _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_ (both being in my toil) remov'd,\n  The poorest Rascals that are in my Camp\n  Shall in my presence quench their lustful heat\n  In thee, and young _Arsino_, while I laugh\n  To hear you howl in vain:\n  I deride those gods,\n  That you think can protect you.\n\n  _Cleo._ To prevent thee,\n  In that I am the Mistress of my Fate;\n  So hope I of my sister to confirm it.\n  I spit at thee, and scorn thee.\n\n  _Pho._ I will tame\n  That haughty courage, and make thee stoop too.\n\n  _Cleo._ Never,\n  I was born to command, and will dye so.\n\n    _Enter_ Achillas, _and Souldiers, with the Body of_ Ptolomy.\n\n  _Pho._ The King dead? this is a fair entrance to\n  Our future happiness.\n\n  _Ars._ Oh my dear Brother!\n\n  _Cleo._ Weep not, _Arsino_, common women do so,\n  Nor lose a tear for him, it cannot help him;\n  But study to dye nobly.\n\n  _Pho._ _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_ fled!\n  'Tis deadly aconite to my cold heart,\n  It choaks my vital Spirits: where was your care?\n  Did the Guards sleep?\n\n  _Achil._ He rowz'd them with his Sword;\n  We talk of _Mars_, but I am sure his Courage\n  Admits of no comparison but it self,\n  And (as inspir'd by him) his following friends\n  With such a confidence as young Eagles prey\n  Under the large wing of their fiercer Dam,\n  Brake through our Troops and scatter'd them, he went on\n  But still pursu'd by us, when on the sudden,\n  He turn'd his head, and from his Eyes flew terrour;\n  Which strook in us no less fear and amazement,\n  Than if we had encounter'd with the lightning\n  Hurl'd from _Jove's_ cloudy Brow.\n\n  _Cleo._ 'Twas like my _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_.\n\n  _Achil._ We faln back, he made on, and as our fear\n  Had parted from us with his dreadful looks,\n  Again we follow'd; but got near the Sea;\n  On which his Navy anchor'd; in one hand\n  Holding a Scroll he had above the waves,\n  And in the other grasping fast his Sword,\n  As it had been a Trident forg'd by _Vulcan_\n  To calm the raging Ocean, he made away\n  As if he had been _Neptune_, his friends like\n  So many _Tritons_ follow'd, their bold shouts\n  Yielding a chearful musick; we showr'd darts\n  Upon them, but in vain, they reach'd their ships\n  And in their safety we are sunk; for _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_\n  Prepares for War.\n\n  _Pho._ How fell the King?\n\n  _Achil._ Unable\n  To follow _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_, he was trod to death\n  By the Pursuers, and with him the Priest\n  Of _Isis_, good _Achoreus_.\n\n  _Ars._ May the Earth\n  Lye gently on their ashes.\n\n  _Pho._ I feel now,\n  That there are powers above us; and that 'tis not\n  Within the searching policies of man\n  To alter their decrees.\n\n  _Cleo._ I laugh at thee;\n  Where are thy threats now, Fool, thy scoffs and scorns\n  Against the gods? I see calamity\n  Is the best Mistress of Religion,\n  And can convert an Atheist.                [_Shout within._\n\n  _Pho._ O they come,\n  Mountains fall on me! O for him to dye\n  That plac'd his Heaven on Earth, is an assurance\n  Of his descent to Hell; where shall I hide me?\n  The greatest daring to a man dishonest,\n  Is but a Bastard Courage, ever fainting.           [_Exit._\n\n    _Enter_ C\u00c3\u00a6sar, Sceva, Antony, Dolabella.\n\n  _C\u00c3\u00a6s._ Look on your _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_; banish fear, my fairest,\n  You now are safe.\n\n  _Sce._ By _Venus_, not a kiss\n  Till our work be done; the Traitors once dispatch'd\n  To it, and we'll cry aim.\n\n  _C\u00c3\u00a6s._ I will be speedy.

But that I am assur'd,\n  Your Excellency can command the General,\n  I fear the Souldiers, for they look as if\n  They would be nibling too.\n\n  _Cleo._ He is all honour,\n  Nor do I now repent me of my favours,\n  Nor can I think that Nature e'r made a Woman\n  That in her prime deserv'd him.\n\n    _Enter_ C\u00c3\u00a6sar, Sceva, Antonie, Dolabella, _Souldiers, with the\n    Heads._\n\n  _Ars._ He's come back,\n  Pursue no further; curb the Souldiers fury.\n\n  _C\u00c3\u00a6s._ See (beauteous Mistris) their accursed heads\n  That did conspire against us.\n\n  _Sce._ Furies plague 'em,\n  They had too fair an end to dye like Souldiers,\n  _Pompey_ fell by the Sword, the Cross or Halter\n  Should have dispatch'd them.\n\n  _C\u00c3\u00a6s._ All is but death, good _Sceva_,\n  Be therefore satisfied: and now my dearest,\n  Look upon _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_, as he still appear'd\n  A Conquerour, and this unfortunate King\n  Entomb'd with honour, we'll to _Rome_, where _C\u00c3\u00a6sar_\n  Will shew he can give Kingdoms; for the Senate,\n  (Thy Brother dead) shall willingly decree\n  The Crown of _Egypt_ (that was his) to thee.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":588,"split":"train"}
