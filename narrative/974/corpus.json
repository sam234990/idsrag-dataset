{"ori_id":"e070825c9e6a08429ba971f12745f7b29c7a41b1","title":"The Two Noble Kinsmen","context":"The Two Noble Kinsmen\n A prologue informs the audience that the play is based on a story from Chaucer.\nThree queens come to plead with Theseus and Hippolyta, rulers of Athens, to avenge the deaths of their husbands by the hand of the tyrant Creon of Thebes. Creon has killed the three kings and refuses to allow them proper burial. Theseus agrees to wage war on Creon.\nIn Thebes, Palamon and Arcite, cousins and close friends, are bound by duty to fight for Creon, though they are appalled by his tyranny. In a hard-fought battle Palamon and Arcite enact prodigies of courage, but the Thebans are defeated by Theseus. Palamon and Arcite are imprisoned, but philosophically resign themselves to their fate. Their stoicism is instantly destroyed when from their prison window they see the Athenian princess Emilia. Both fall in love with her, and their friendship turns to bitter rivalry. Arcite is released after a relative intercedes on his behalf. He is banished from Athens, but he disguises himself, wins a local wrestling match, and is appointed as Emilia's bodyguard.\nMeanwhile, the jailer's daughter has fallen in love with Palamon and helps him escape. She follows him, but he ignores her: still obsessed with Emilia. He lives in the forest half-starved, where he meets Arcite. The two argue, but Arcite offers to bring Palamon food, drink and armaments so that they can meet in an equal fight over Emilia.\nThe jailer's daughter, forsaken, has gone mad. She sings and babbles in the forest. She meets a troupe of local countrymen who want to perform a Morris dance before the king and queen. Local schoolmaster Gerald invites the mad daughter to join the performance. Theseus and Hippolyta appear, hunting. Gerald hails them, and they agree to watch the yokels perform a bizarre act for them, with the jailer's mad daughter dancing. The royal couple reward them.\nArcite returns with the food and weapons. After a convivial dinner with reminiscences, the two fight. Theseus and his entourage arrive on the scene. He orders that Palamon and Arcite be arrested and executed. Hippolyta and Emilia intervene, and so Theseus agrees to a public tournament between the two for Emilia's hand. Each warrior will be allowed three companions to assist them. The loser and his companion knights will be executed.\nThe jailer finds his daughter with the help of friends. He tries to restore her mental health. On the advice of a doctor, he encourages her former suitor to pretend to be Palamon so that she will be gradually accustomed to see him as her true love. His devotion slowly wins her over.\nBefore the tournament, Arcite prays to Mars that he win the battle; Palamon prays to Venus that he marry Emilia; Emilia prays to Diana that she be wed to the one who loves her best. Each prayer is granted: Arcite wins the combat, but is then thrown from his horse and dies, leaving Palamon to wed Emilia.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf\nProject Gutenberg Etext of The Two Noble Kinsmen by Shakespeare\nPG has multiple editions of William Shakespeare's Complete Works\n\n\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check\nthe copyright laws for your country before posting these files!!\n\nPlease take a look at the important information in this header.\nWe encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an\nelectronic path open for the next readers.

Therefore, we usually do NOT! keep\nthese books in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\n\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\n\n\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\n\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\n\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\nfrom Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\ndon't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg\/CMU\": and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Palamon\nHas a most menacing aspect: his brow\nIs grav'd, and seemes to bury what it frownes on;\nYet sometime tis not so, but alters to\nThe quallity of his thoughts; long time his eye\nWill dwell upon his object.  Mellencholly\nBecomes him nobly; So do's Arcites mirth,\nBut Palamons sadnes is a kinde of mirth,\nSo mingled, as if mirth did make him sad,\nAnd sadnes, merry; those darker humours that\nSticke misbecomingly on others, on them\nLive in faire dwelling.  [Cornets.  Trompets sound as to a\ncharge.]\nHarke, how yon spurs to spirit doe incite\nThe Princes to their proofe! Arcite may win me,\nAnd yet may Palamon wound Arcite to\nThe spoyling of his figure.  O, what pitty\nEnough for such a chance; if I were by,\nI might doe hurt, for they would glance their eies\nToward my Seat, and in that motion might\nOmit a ward, or forfeit an offence\nWhich crav'd that very time: it is much better\nI am not there; oh better never borne\nThen minister to such harme.  [Cornets.  A great cry and noice within,\n crying 'a Palamon'.]  What is the chance?\n\n[Enter Servant.]\n\nSERVANT.\n\nThe Crie's 'a Palamon'.\n\nEMILIA.\n\nThen he has won!  Twas ever likely;\nHe lookd all grace and successe, and he is\nDoubtlesse the prim'st of men: I pre'thee, run\nAnd tell me how it goes.  [Showt, and Cornets: Crying, 'a\nPalamon.']\n\nSERVANT.\n\nStill Palamon.\n\nEMILIA.\n\nRun and enquire.  Poore Servant, thou hast lost;\nVpon my right side still I wore thy picture,\nPalamons on the left: why so, I know not;\nI had no end in't else, chance would have it so.\nOn the sinister side the heart lyes; Palamon\nHad the best boding chance.  [Another cry, and showt within, and\n Cornets.]  This burst of clamour\nIs sure th'end o'th Combat.\n\n[Enter Servant.]\n\nSERVANT.\n\nThey saide that Palamon had Arcites body\nWithin an inch o'th Pyramid, that the cry\nWas generall 'a Palamon': But, anon,\nTh'Assistants made a brave redemption, and\nThe two bold Tytlers, at this instant are\nHand to hand at it.\n\nEMILIA.\n\nWere they metamorphisd\nBoth into one! oh why? there were no woman\nWorth so composd a Man: their single share,\nTheir noblenes peculier to them, gives\nThe prejudice of disparity, values shortnes,  [Cornets.  Cry within,\n Arcite, Arcite.]\nTo any Lady breathing--More exulting?\nPalamon still?\n\nSERVANT.\n\nNay, now the sound is Arcite.\n\nEMILIA.\n\nI pre'thee, lay attention to the Cry,  [Cornets.  A great showt and\n cry, 'Arcite, victory!']\nSet both thine eares to'th busines.\n\nSERVANT.\n\nThe cry is\n'Arcite', and 'victory', harke: 'Arcite, victory!'\nThe Combats consummation is proclaim'd\nBy the wind Instruments.\n\nEMILIA.\n\nHalfe sights saw\nThat Arcite was no babe; god's lyd, his richnes\nAnd costlines of spirit look't through him, it could\nNo more be hid in him then fire in flax,\nThen humble banckes can goe to law with waters,\nThat drift windes force to raging: I did thinke\nGood Palamon would miscarry; yet I knew not\nWhy I did thinke so; Our reasons are not prophets,\nWhen oft our fancies are.  They are comming off:\nAlas, poore Palamon!  [Cornets.]\n\n[Enter Theseus, Hipolita, Pirithous, Arcite as victor, and\n attendants, &c.]\n\nTHESEUS.\n\nLo, where our Sister is in expectation,\nYet quaking, and unsetled.--Fairest Emily,\nThe gods by their divine arbitrament\nHave given you this Knight; he is a good one\nAs ever strooke at head.  Give me your hands;\nReceive you her, you him; be plighted with\nA love that growes, as you decay.\n\nARCITE.\n\nEmily,\nTo buy you, I have lost what's deerest to me,\nSave what is bought, and yet I purchase cheapely,\nAs I doe rate your value.\n\nTHESEUS.\n\nO loved Sister,\nHe speakes now of as brave a Knight as ere\nDid spur a noble Steed: Surely, the gods\nWould have him die a Batchelour, least his race\nShould shew i'th world too godlike: His behaviour\nSo charmed me, that me thought Alcides was\nTo him a sow of lead: if I could praise\nEach part of him to'th all I have spoke, your Arcite\nDid not loose by't; For he that was thus good\nEncountred yet his Better.  I have heard\nTwo emulous Philomels beate the eare o'th night\nWith their contentious throates, now one the higher,\nAnon the other, then againe the first,\nAnd by and by out breasted, that the sence\nCould not be judge betweene 'em: So it far'd\nGood space betweene these kinesmen; till heavens did\nMake hardly one the winner.  Weare the Girlond\nWith joy that you have won: For the subdude,\nGive them our present Iustice, since I know\nTheir lives but pinch 'em; Let it here be done.\nThe Sceane's not for our seeing, goe we hence,\nRight joyfull, with some sorrow.--Arme your prize,\nI know you will not loose her.--Hipolita,\nI see one eye of yours conceives a teare\nThe which it will deliver.  [Florish.]\n\nEMILIA.\n\nIs this wynning?\nOh all you heavenly powers, where is your mercy?\nBut that your wils have saide it must be so,\nAnd charge me live to comfort this unfriended,\nThis miserable Prince, that cuts away\nA life more worthy from him then all women,\nI should, and would, die too.\n\nHIPPOLITA.\n\nInfinite pitty,\nThat fowre such eies should be so fixd on one\nThat two must needes be blinde fort.\n\nTHESEUS.\n\nSo it is.

That nought could buy\nDeare love, but losse of deare love!\n\nTHESEUS.\n\nNever Fortune\nDid play a subtler Game: The conquerd triumphes,\nThe victor has the Losse: yet in the passage\nThe gods have beene most equall: Palamon,\nYour kinseman hath confest the right o'th Lady\nDid lye in you, for you first saw her, and\nEven then proclaimd your fancie: He restord her\nAs your stolne Iewell, and desir'd your spirit\nTo send him hence forgiven; The gods my justice\nTake from my hand, and they themselves become\nThe Executioners: Leade your Lady off;\nAnd call your Lovers from the stage of death,\nWhom I adopt my Frinds.  A day or two\nLet us looke sadly, and give grace unto\nThe Funerall of Arcite; in whose end\nThe visages of Bridegroomes weele put on\nAnd smile with Palamon; for whom an houre,\nBut one houre, since, I was as dearely sorry,\nAs glad of Arcite: and am now as glad,\nAs for him sorry.  O you heavenly Charmers,\nWhat things you make of us!  For what we lacke\nWe laugh, for what we have, are sorry: still\nAre children in some kind.  Let us be thankefull\nFor that which is, and with you leave dispute\nThat are above our question.  Let's goe off,\nAnd beare us like the time.  [Florish.  Exeunt.]\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGVE\n\nI would now aske ye how ye like the Play,\nBut, as it is with Schoole Boyes, cannot say,\nI am cruell fearefull: pray, yet stay a while,\nAnd let me looke upon ye: No man smile?\nThen it goes hard, I see; He that has\nLov'd a yong hansome wench, then, show his face--\nTis strange if none be heere--and if he will\nAgainst his Conscience, let him hisse, and kill\nOur Market: Tis in vaine, I see, to stay yee;\nHave at the worst can come, then!  Now what say ye?\nAnd yet mistake me not: I am not bold;\nWe have no such cause.  If the tale we have told\n(For tis no other) any way content ye\n(For to that honest purpose it was ment ye)\nWe have our end; and ye shall have ere long,\nI dare say, many a better, to prolong\nYour old loves to us: we, and all our might\nRest at your service.
