Her uncle General Boxer Bridgenorth, will give her away, as he has all her sisters. As at all the other weddings he proposes to Lesbia Grantham, the bride's aunt, who refuses him for the \"tenth and last\" time. Lesbia wants a family, but not a husband who smokes and is as untidy as the general. The General is soon shocked to find that his disreputable brother Reginald will be at the wedding. Reginald was recently divorced by his wife for assaulting her and for his adultery with a prostitute. Even more distressingly, his ex-wife Leo is coming too. When the divorcees arrive they are not at all embarrassed. It seems that Leo and her ex-husband arranged the \"assault\" and the \"prostitute\" so that they could separate without any blame attaching to Leo, who wishes to marry another man - John Hotchkiss.\nHowever problems arise when the bride refuses to leave her room. She says she is reading a pamphlet on marriage! Apparently Cecil Sykes, her husband-to-be, is also reading a pamphlet. Both refuse to go to the church until they are finished. The couple finally emerge from their rooms. It seems that the pamphlets have revealed to them the dangers of marriage. She has learned that if her husband becomes a criminal lunatic she cannot divorce him. He has learned that he may be liable for his wife's debts. The bishop, who is writing a book on the history of marriage, suggests that Edith and Cecil should revive the Roman concept of marriage by contract, but he thinks a traditional marriage is better. The Bishop's chaplain, a lawyer, tries to draw up a contract, though it proves a difficult task. All the characters have ideas about what should be in the contract, based on their own experience. There is disagreement on medical, religious, financial and other matters.\nEventually they give up, agreeing that a standard marriage is easier, at least with the possibility of divorce. Cecil and Edith leave together and return married - though the ceremony involved the Beadle giving away the bride. They have arranged with an insurance company a deal that will free Cecil of responsibility for any future debt incurred by his wife. In return Cecil has provided a document declaring that if he commits a crime while insane, his wife may divorce him. Hotchkiss, who, it turns out was being pursued by Leo rather against his own wishes, falls in love with the siren-like Mrs George Collins. Leo therefore tells her ex-husband that their divorce must be revoked.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Getting Married, by George Bernard Shaw\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

If the mischief stopped at talking and thinking\nit would be bad enough; but it goes further, into disastrous anarchical\naction. Because our marriage law is inhuman and unreasonable to the\npoint of downright abomination, the bolder and more rebellious spirits\nform illicit unions, defiantly sending cards round to their friends\nannouncing what they have done. Young women come to me and ask me\nwhether I think they ought to consent to marry the man they have decided\nto live with; and they are perplexed and astonished when I, who am\nsupposed (heaven knows why!) to have the most advanced views attainable\non the subject, urge them on no account to compromize themselves without\nthe security of an authentic wedding ring. They cite the example of\nGeorge Eliot, who formed an illicit union with Lewes. They quote\na saying attributed to Nietzsche, that a married philosopher is\nridiculous, though the men of their choice are not philosophers. When\nthey finally give up the idea of reforming our marriage institutions by\nprivate enterprise and personal righteousness, and consent to be led to\nthe Registry or even to the altar, they insist on first arriving at an\nexplicit understanding that both parties are to be perfectly free to sip\nevery flower and change every hour, as their fancy may dictate, in\nspite of the legal bond. I do not observe that their unions prove\nless monogamic than other people's: rather the contrary, in fact;\nconsequently, I do not know whether they make less fuss than ordinary\npeople when either party claims the benefit of the treaty; but the\nexistence of the treaty shews the same anarchical notion that the law\ncan be set aside by any two private persons by the simple process of\npromising one another to ignore it.\n\n\n\n\nMARRIAGE NEVERTHELESS INEVITABLE\n\nNow most laws are, and all laws ought to be, stronger than the\nstrongest individual. Certainly the marriage law is. The only people\nwho successfully evade it are those who actually avail themselves of its\nshelter by pretending to be married when they are not, and by Bohemians\nwho have no position to lose and no career to be closed. In every other\ncase open violation of the marriage laws means either downright ruin or\nsuch inconvenience and disablement as a prudent man or woman would get\nmarried ten times over rather than face. And these disablements and\ninconveniences are not even the price of freedom; for, as Brieux has\nshewn so convincingly in Les Hannetons, an avowedly illicit union is\noften found in practice to be as tyrannical and as hard to escape from\nas the worst legal one.\n\nWe may take it then that when a joint domestic establishment, involving\nquestions of children or property, is contemplated, marriage is in\neffect compulsory upon all normal people; and until the law is altered\nthere is nothing for us but to make the best of it as it stands. Even\nwhen no such establishment is desired, clandestine irregularities are\nnegligible as an alternative to marriage. How common they are nobody\nknows; for in spite of the powerful protection afforded to the parties\nby the law of libel, and the readiness of society on various other\ngrounds to be hoodwinked by the keeping up of the very thinnest\nappearances, most of them are probably never suspected. But they are\nneither dignified nor safe and comfortable, which at once rules them out\nfor normal decent people. Marriage remains practically inevitable; and\nthe sooner we acknowledge this, the sooner we shall set to work to make\nit decent and reasonable.\n\n\n\n\nWHAT DOES THE WORD MARRIAGE MEAN\n\nHowever much we may all suffer through marriage, most of us think\nso little about it that we regard it as a fixed part of the order of\nnature, like gravitation. Except for this error, which may be regarded\nas constant, we use the word with reckless looseness, meaning a dozen\ndifferent things by it, and yet always assuming that to a respectable\nman it can have only one meaning. The pious citizen, suspecting the\nSocialist (for example) of unmentionable things, and asking him heatedly\nwhether he wishes to abolish marriage, is infuriated by a sense of\nunanswerable quibbling when the Socialist asks him what particular\nvariety of marriage he means: English civil marriage, sacramental\nmarriage, indissoluble Roman Catholic marriage, marriage of divorced\npersons, Scotch marriage, Irish marriage, French, German, Turkish, or\nSouth Dakotan marriage. In Sweden, one of the most highly civilized\ncountries in the world, a marriage is dissolved if both parties wish it,\nwithout any question of conduct. That is what marriage means in Sweden.\nIn Clapham that is what they call by the senseless name of Free Love.\nIn the British Empire we have unlimited Kulin polygamy, Muslim polygamy\nlimited to four wives, child marriages, and, nearer home, marriages\nof first cousins: all of them abominations in the eyes of many worthy\npersons. Not only may the respectable British champion of marriage mean\nany of these widely different institutions; sometimes he does not\nmean marriage at all. He means monogamy, chastity, temperance,\nrespectability, morality, Christianity, anti-socialism, and a dozen\nother things that have no necessary connection with marriage. He often\nmeans something that he dare not avow: ownership of the person of\nanother human being, for instance. And he never tells the truth about\nhis own marriage either to himself or any one else.\n\nWith those individualists who in the mid-XIXth century dreamt of doing\naway with marriage altogether on the ground that it is a private concern\nbetween the two parties with which society has nothing to do, there\nis now no need to deal. The vogue of \"the self-regarding action\" has\npassed; and it may be assumed without argument that unions for the\npurpose of establishing a family will continue to be registered and\nregulated by the State. Such registration is marriage, and will continue\nto be called marriage long after the conditions of the registration\nhave changed so much that no citizen now living would recognize them as\nmarriage conditions at all if he revisited the earth. There is therefore\nno question of abolishing marriage; but there is a very pressing\nquestion of improving its conditions. I have never met anybody really\nin favor of maintaining marriage as it exists in England to-day. A Roman\nCatholic may obey his Church by assenting verbally to the doctrine of\nindissoluble marriage. But nobody worth counting believes directly,\nfrankly, and instinctively that when a person commits a murder and is\nput into prison for twenty years for it, the free and innocent husband\nor wife of that murderer should remain bound by the marriage. To put it\nbriefly, a contract for better for worse is a contract that should not\nbe tolerated. As a matter of fact it is not tolerated fully even by the\nRoman Catholic Church; for Roman Catholic marriages can be dissolved,\nif not by the temporal Courts, by the Pope. Indissoluble marriage is an\nacademic figment, advocated only by celibates and by comfortably married\npeople who imagine that if other couples are uncomfortable it must be\ntheir own fault, just as rich people are apt to imagine that if other\npeople are poor it serves them right. There is always some means of\ndissolution. The conditions of dissolution may vary widely, from those\non which Henry VIII. procured his divorce from Katharine of Arragon to\nthe pleas on which American wives obtain divorces (for instance, \"mental\nanguish\" caused by the husband's neglect to cut his toenails); but\nthere is always some point at which the theory of the inviolable\nbetter-for-worse marriage breaks down in practice. South Carolina has\nindeed passed what is called a freak law declaring that a marriage shall\nnot be dissolved under any circumstances; but such an absurdity will\nprobably be repealed or amended by sheer force of circumstances before\nthese words are in print. The only question to be considered is, What\nshall the conditions of the dissolution be?\n\n\n\n\nSURVIVALS OF SEX SLAVERY\n\nIf we adopt the common romantic assumption that the object of marriage\nis bliss, then the very strongest reason for dissolving a marriage is\nthat it shall be disagreeable to one or other or both of the parties.\nIf we accept the view that the object of marriage is to provide for\nthe production and rearing of children, then childlessness should be a\nconclusive reason for dissolution. As neither of these causes entitles\nmarried persons to divorce it is at once clear that our marriage law is\nnot founded on either assumption. What it is really founded on is the\nmorality of the tenth commandment, which English women will one day\nsucceed in obliterating from the walls of our churches by refusing to\nenter any building where they are publicly classed with a man's house,\nhis ox, and his ass, as his purchased chattels. In this morality female\nadultery is malversation by the woman and theft by the man, whilst male\nadultery with an unmarried woman is not an offence at all. But though\nthis is not only the theory of our marriage laws, but the practical\nmorality of many of us, it is no longer an avowed morality, nor does\nits persistence depend on marriage; for the abolition of marriage would,\nother things remaining unchanged, leave women more effectually enslaved\nthan they now are. We shall come to the question of the economic\ndependence of women on men later on; but at present we had better\nconfine ourselves to the theories of marriage which we are not ashamed\nto acknowledge and defend, and upon which, therefore, marriage reformers\nwill be obliged to proceed.\n\nWe may, I think, dismiss from the field of practical politics the\nextreme sacerdotal view of marriage as a sacred and indissoluble\ncovenant, because though reinforced by unhappy marriages as all\nfanaticisms are reinforced by human sacrifices, it has been reduced to\na private and socially inoperative eccentricity by the introduction of\ncivil marriage and divorce. Theoretically, our civilly married couples\nare to a Catholic as unmarried couples are: that is, they are living in\nopen sin. Practically, civilly married couples are received in society,\nby Catholics and everyone else, precisely as sacramentally married\ncouples are; and so are people who have divorced their wives or husbands\nand married again. And yet marriage is enforced by public opinion with\nsuch ferocity that the least suggestion of laxity in its support is\nfatal to even the highest and strongest reputations, although laxity\nof conduct is winked at with grinning indulgence; so that we find the\naustere Shelley denounced as a fiend in human form, whilst Nelson, who\nopenly left his wife and formed a menage a trois with Sir William and\nLady Hamilton, was idolized. Shelley might have had an illegitimate\nchild in every county in England if he had done so frankly as a\nsinner. His unpardonable offence was that he attacked marriage as an\ninstitution. We feel a strange anguish of terror and hatred against\nhim, as against one who threatens us with a mortal injury. What is the\nelement in his proposals that produces this effect?\n\nThe answer of the specialists is the one already alluded to: that\nthe attack on marriage is an attack on property; so that Shelley was\nsomething more hateful to a husband than a horse thief: to wit, a wife\nthief, and something more hateful to a wife than a burglar: namely, one\nwho would steal her husband's house from over her head, and leave her\ndestitute and nameless on the streets. Now, no doubt this accounts for\na good deal of anti-Shelleyan prejudice: a prejudice so deeply rooted\nin our habits that, as I have shewn in my play, men who are bolder\nfreethinkers than Shelley himself can no more bring themselves to commit\nadultery than to commit any common theft, whilst women who loathe sex\nslavery more fiercely than Mary Wollstonecraft are unable to face the\ninsecurity and discredit of the vagabondage which is the masterless\nwoman's only alternative to celibacy. But in spite of all this there\nis a revolt against marriage which has spread so rapidly within my\nrecollection that though we all still assume the existence of a huge and\ndangerous majority which regards the least hint of scepticism as to the\nbeauty and holiness of marriage as infamous and abhorrent, I sometimes\nwonder why it is so difficult to find an authentic living member of this\ndreaded army of convention outside the ranks of the people who never\nthink about public questions at all, and who, for all their numerical\nweight and apparently invincible prejudices, accept social changes\nto-day as tamely as their forefathers accepted the Reformation under\nHenry and Edward, the Restoration under Mary, and, after Mary's death,\nthe shandygaff which Elizabeth compounded from both doctrines and called\nthe Articles of the Church of England. If matters were left to these\nsimple folk, there would never be any changes at all; and society would\nperish like a snake that could not cast its skins. Nevertheless the\nsnake does change its skin in spite of them; and there are signs that\nour marriage-law skin is causing discomfort to thoughtful people and\nwill presently be cast whether the others are satisfied with it or not.\nThe question therefore arises: What is there in marriage that makes the\nthoughtful people so uncomfortable?\n\n\n\n\nA NEW ATTACK ON MARRIAGE\n\nThe answer to this question is an answer which everybody knows and\nnobody likes to give. What is driving our ministers of religion and\nstatesmen to blurt it out at last is the plain fact that marriage is now\nbeginning to depopulate the country with such alarming rapidity that we\nare forced to throw aside our modesty like people who, awakened by an\nalarm of fire, rush into the streets in their nightdresses or in no\ndresses at all. The fictitious Free Lover, who was supposed to attack\nmarriage because it thwarted his inordinate affections and prevented him\nfrom making life a carnival, has vanished and given place to the very\nreal, very strong, very austere avenger of outraged decency who declares\nthat the licentiousness of marriage, now that it no longer recruits the\nrace, is destroying it.\n\nAs usual, this change of front has not yet been noticed by our newspaper\ncontroversialists and by the suburban season-ticket holders whose minds\nthe newspapers make. They still defend the citadel on the side on which\nnobody is attacking it, and leave its weakest front undefended.\n\nThe religious revolt against marriage is a very old one. Christianity\nbegan with a fierce attack on marriage; and to this day the celibacy\nof the Roman Catholic priesthood is a standing protest against its\ncompatibility with the higher life. St. Paul's reluctant sanction of\nmarriage; his personal protest that he countenanced it of necessity and\nagainst his own conviction; his contemptuous \"better to marry than to\nburn\" is only out of date in respect of his belief that the end of the\nworld was at hand and that there was therefore no longer any population\nquestion. His instinctive recoil from its worst aspect as a slavery to\npleasure which induces two people to accept slavery to one another has\nremained an active force in the world to this day, and is now stirring\nmore uneasily than ever. We have more and more Pauline celibates whose\nobjection to marriage is the intolerable indignity of being supposed\nto desire or live the married life as ordinarily conceived. Every\nthoughtful and observant minister of religion is troubled by the\ndetermination of his flock to regard marriage as a sanctuary for\npleasure, seeing as he does that the known libertines of his parish are\nvisibly suffering much less from intemperance than many of the married\npeople who stigmatize them as monsters of vice.\n\n\n\n\nA FORGOTTEN CONFERENCE OF MARRIED MEN\n\nThe late Hugh Price Hughes, an eminent Methodist divine, once organized\nin London a conference of respectable men to consider the subject.\nNothing came of it (nor indeed could have come of it in the absence of\nwomen); but it had its value as giving the young sociologists present,\nof whom I was one, an authentic notion of what a picked audience\nof respectable men understood by married life. It was certainly a\nstaggering revelation. Peter the Great would have been shocked; Byron\nwould have been horrified; Don Juan would have fled from the conference\ninto a monastery. The respectable men all regarded the marriage ceremony\nas a rite which absolved them from the laws of health and temperance;\ninaugurated a life-long honeymoon; and placed their pleasures on exactly\nthe same footing as their prayers. It seemed entirely proper and natural\nto them that out of every twenty-four hours of their lives they should\npass eight shut up in one room with their wives alone, and this, not\nbirdlike, for the mating season, but all the year round and every year.\nHow they settled even such minor questions as to which party should\ndecide whether and how much the window should be open and how many\nblankets should be on the bed, and at what hour they should go to\nbed and get up so as to avoid disturbing one another's sleep, seemed\ninsoluble questions to me. But the members of the conference did not\nseem to mind. They were content to have the whole national housing\nproblem treated on a basis of one room for two people. That was the\nessence of marriage for them.\n\nPlease remember, too, that there was nothing in their circumstances to\ncheck intemperance. They were men of business: that is, men for the most\npart engaged in routine work which exercized neither their minds nor\ntheir bodies to the full pitch of their capacities. Compared with\nstatesmen, first-rate professional men, artists, and even with laborers\nand artisans as far as muscular exertion goes, they were underworked,\nand could spare the fine edge of their faculties and the last few inches\nof their chests without being any the less fit for their daily routine.\nIf I had adopted their habits, a startling deterioration would have\nappeared in my writing before the end of a fortnight, and frightened me\nback to what they would have considered an impossible asceticism. But\nthey paid no penalty of which they were conscious. They had as much\nhealth as they wanted: that is, they did not feel the need of a doctor.\nThey enjoyed their smokes, their meals, their respectable clothes,\ntheir affectionate games with their children, their prospects of larger\nprofits or higher salaries, their Saturday half holidays and Sunday\nwalks, and the rest of it. They did less than two hours work a day and\ntook from seven to nine office hours to do it in. And they were no good\nfor any mortal purpose except to go on doing it. They were respectable\nonly by the standard they themselves had set. Considered seriously\nas electors governing an empire through their votes, and choosing and\nmaintaining its religious and moral institutions by their powers of\nsocial persecution, they were a black-coated army of calamity. They were\nincapable of comprehending the industries they were engaged in, the\nlaws under which they lived, or the relation of their country to other\ncountries. They lived the lives of old men contentedly. They were\ntimidly conservative at the age at which every healthy human being ought\nto be obstreperously revolutionary. And their wives went through the\nroutine of the kitchen, nursery, and drawing-room just as they went\nthrough the routine of the office. They had all, as they called it,\nsettled down, like balloons that had lost their lifting margin of gas;\nand it was evident that the process of settling down would go on until\nthey settled into their graves. They read old-fashioned newspapers\nwith effort, and were just taking with avidity to a new sort of paper,\ncosting a halfpenny, which they believed to be extraordinarily bright\nand attractive, and which never really succeeded until it became\nextremely dull, discarding all serious news and replacing it by vapid\ntittle-tattle, and substituting for political articles informed by\nat least some pretence of knowledge of economics, history, and\nconstitutional law, such paltry follies and sentimentalities, snobberies\nand partisaneries, as ignorance can understand and irresponsibility\nrelish.\n\nWhat they called patriotism was a conviction that because they were born\nin Tooting or Camberwell, they were the natural superiors of Beethoven,\nof Rodin, of Ibsen, of Tolstoy and all other benighted foreigners. Those\nof them who did not think it wrong to go to the theatre liked above\neverything a play in which the hero was called Dick; was continually\nfingering a briar pipe; and, after being overwhelmed with admiration\nand affection through three acts, was finally rewarded with the legal\npossession of a pretty heroine's person on the strength of a staggering\nlack of virtue. Indeed their only conception of the meaning of the word\nvirtue was abstention from stealing other men's wives or from refusing\nto marry their daughters.\n\nAs to law, religion, ethics, and constitutional government, any\ncounterfeit could impose on them. Any atheist could pass himself off on\nthem as a bishop, any anarchist as a judge, any despot as a Whig, any\nsentimental socialist as a Tory, any philtre-monger or witch-finder as\na man of science, any phrase-maker as a statesman. Those who did not\nbelieve the story of Jonah and the great fish were all the readier to\nbelieve that metals can be transmuted and all diseases cured by radium,\nand that men can live for two hundred years by drinking sour milk. Even\nthese credulities involved too severe an intellectual effort for many of\nthem: it was easier to grin and believe nothing. They maintained their\nrespect for themselves by \"playing the game\" (that is, doing what\neverybody else did), and by being good judges of hats, ties, dogs,\npipes, cricket, gardens, flowers, and the like. They were capable\nof discussing each other's solvency and respectability with some\nshrewdness, and could carry out quite complicated systems of paying\nvisits and \"knowing\" one another. They felt a little vulgar when they\nspent a day at Margate, and quite distinguished and travelled when\nthey spent it at Boulogne. They were, except as to their clothes, \"not\nparticular\": that is, they could put up with ugly sights and sounds,\nunhealthy smells, and inconvenient houses, with inhuman apathy and\ncallousness. They had, as to adults, a theory that human nature is so\npoor that it is useless to try to make the world any better, whilst as\nto children they believed that if they were only sufficiently lectured\nand whipped, they could be brought to a state of moral perfection such\nas no fanatic has ever ascribed to his deity. Though they were not\nintentionally malicious, they practised the most appalling cruelties\nfrom mere thoughtlessness, thinking nothing of imprisoning men and\nwomen for periods up to twenty years for breaking into their houses; of\ntreating their children as wild beasts to be tamed by a system of blows\nand imprisonment which they called education; and of keeping pianos in\ntheir houses, not for musical purposes, but to torment their daughters\nwith a senseless stupidity that would have revolted an inquisitor.\n\nIn short, dear reader, they were very like you and me. I could fill a\nhundred pages with the tale of our imbecilities and still leave much\nuntold; but what I have set down here haphazard is enough to condemn the\nsystem that produced us. The corner stone of that system was the family\nand the institution of marriage as we have it to-day in England.\n\n\n\n\nHEARTH AND HOME\n\nThere is no shirking it: if marriage cannot be made to produce something\nbetter than we are, marriage will have to go, or else the nation\nwill have to go. It is no use talking of honor, virtue, purity, and\nwholesome, sweet, clean, English home lives when what is meant is simply\nthe habits I have described. The flat fact is that English home life\nto-day is neither honorable, virtuous, wholesome, sweet, clean, nor\nin any creditable way distinctively English. It is in many respects\nconspicuously the reverse; and the result of withdrawing children from\nit completely at an early age, and sending them to a public school and\nthen to a university, does, in spite of the fact that these institutions\nare class warped and in some respects quite abominably corrupt, produce\nsociabler men. Women, too, are improved by the escape from home provided\nby women's colleges; but as very few of them are fortunate enough to\nenjoy this advantage, most women are so thoroughly home-bred as to\nbe unfit for human society. So little is expected of them that in\nSheridan's School for Scandal we hardly notice that the heroine is a\nfemale cad, as detestable and dishonorable in her repentance as she is\nvulgar and silly in her naughtiness. It was left to an abnormal critic\nlike George Gissing to point out the glaring fact that in the remarkable\nset of life studies of XIXth century women to be found in the novels of\nDickens, the most convincingly real ones are either vilely unamiable\nor comically contemptible; whilst his attempts to manufacture admirable\nheroines by idealizations of home-bred womanhood are not only absurd but\nnot even pleasantly absurd: one has no patience with them.\n\nAs all this is corrigible by reducing home life and domestic sentiment\nto something like reasonable proportions in the life of the individual,\nthe danger of it does not lie in human nature. Home life as we\nunderstand it is no more natural to us than a cage is natural to a\ncockatoo. Its grave danger to the nation lies in its narrow views, its\nunnaturally sustained and spitefully jealous concupiscences, its\npetty tyrannies, its false social pretences, its endless grudges and\nsquabbles, its sacrifice of the boy's future by setting him to earn\nmoney to help the family when he should be in training for his adult\nlife (remember the boy Dickens and the blacking factory), and of the\ngirl's chances by making her a slave to sick or selfish parents, its\nunnatural packing into little brick boxes of little parcels of humanity\nof ill-assorted ages, with the old scolding or beating the young for\nbehaving like young people, and the young hating and thwarting the old\nfor behaving like old people, and all the other ills, mentionable and\nunmentionable, that arise from excessive segregation. It sets these\nevils up as benefits and blessings representing the highest attainable\ndegree of honor and virtue, whilst any criticism of or revolt against\nthem is savagely persecuted as the extremity of vice. The revolt, driven\nunder ground and exacerbated, produces debauchery veiled by hypocrisy,\nan overwhelming demand for licentious theatrical entertainments which no\ncensorship can stem, and, worst of all, a confusion of virtue with\nthe mere morality that steals its name until the real thing is loathed\nbecause the imposture is loathsome. Literary traditions spring up in\nwhich the libertine and profligate--Tom Jones and Charles Surface\nare the heroes, and decorous, law-abiding persons--Blifil and Joseph\nSurface--are the villains and butts. People like to believe that Nell\nGwynne has every amiable quality and the Bishop's wife every odious one.\nPoor Mr. Pecksniff, who is generally no worse than a humbug with a turn\nfor pompous talking, is represented as a criminal instead of as a very\ntypical English paterfamilias keeping a roof over the head of himself\nand his daughters by inducing people to pay him more for his services\nthan they are worth. In the extreme instances of reaction against\nconvention, female murderers get sheaves of offers of marriage; and when\nNature throws up that rare phenomenon, an unscrupulous libertine, his\nsuccess among \"well brought-up\" girls is so easy, and the devotion\nhe inspires so extravagant, that it is impossible not to see that\nthe revolt against conventional respectability has transfigured\na commonplace rascal into a sort of Anarchist Saviour. As to the\nrespectable voluptuary, who joins Omar Khayyam clubs and vibrates to\nSwinburne's invocation of Dolores to \"come down and redeem us from\nvirtue,\" he is to be found in every suburb.\n\n\n\n\nTOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING\n\nWe must be reasonable in our domestic ideals. I do not think that life\nat a public school is altogether good for a boy any more than barrack\nlife is altogether good for a soldier. But neither is home life\naltogether good. Such good as it does, I should say, is due to its\nfreedom from the very atmosphere it professes to supply. That atmosphere\nis usually described as an atmosphere of love; and this definition\nshould be sufficient to put any sane person on guard against it. The\npeople who talk and write as if the highest attainable state is that of\na family stewing in love continuously from the cradle to the grave, can\nhardly have given five minutes serious consideration to so outrageous a\nproposition. They cannot have even made up their minds as to what they\nmean by love; for when they expatiate on their thesis they are sometimes\ntalking about kindness, and sometimes about mere appetite. In either\nsense they are equally far from the realities of life. No healthy man\nor animal is occupied with love in any sense for more than a very small\nfraction indeed of the time he devotes to business and to recreations\nwholly unconnected with love. A wife entirely preoccupied with her\naffection for her husband, a mother entirely preoccupied with her\naffection for her children, may be all very well in a book (for people\nwho like that kind of book); but in actual life she is a nuisance.\nHusbands may escape from her when their business compels them to be\naway from home all day; but young children may be, and quite often are,\nkilled by her cuddling and coddling and doctoring and preaching: above\nall, by her continuous attempts to excite precocious sentimentality,\na practice as objectionable, and possibly as mischievous, as the worst\ntricks of the worst nursemaids.\n\n\n\n\nLARGE AND SMALL FAMILIES\n\nIn most healthy families there is a revolt against this tendency. The\nexchanging of presents on birthdays and the like is barred by general\nconsent, and the relations of the parties are placed by express treaty\non an unsentimental footing.\n\nUnfortunately this mitigation of family sentimentality is much more\ncharacteristic of large families than small ones. It used to be said\nthat members of large families get on in the world; and it is certainly\ntrue that for purposes of social training a household of twenty\nsurpasses a household of five as an Oxford College surpasses an\neight-roomed house in a cheap street. Ten children, with the necessary\nadults, make a community in which an excess of sentimentality is\nimpossible. Two children make a doll's house, in which both parents and\nchildren become morbid if they keep to themselves. What is more, when\nlarge families were the fashion, they were organized as tyrannies much\nmore than as \"atmospheres of love.\" Francis Place tells us that he kept\nout of his father's way because his father never passed a child within\nhis reach without striking it; and though the case was an extreme\none, it was an extreme that illustrated a tendency. Sir Walter Scott's\nfather, when his son incautiously expressed some relish for his\nporridge, dashed a handful of salt into it with an instinctive sense\nthat it was his duty as a father to prevent his son enjoying himself.\nRuskin's mother gratified the sensual side of her maternal passion, not\nby cuddling her son, but by whipping him when he fell downstairs or\nwas slack in learning the Bible off by heart; and this grotesque\nsafety-valve for voluptuousness, mischievous as it was in many ways,\nhad at least the advantage that the child did not enjoy it and was not\ndebauched by it, as he would have been by transports of sentimentality.\n\nBut nowadays we cannot depend on these safeguards, such as they were.\nWe no longer have large families: all the families are too small to give\nthe children the necessary social training. The Roman father is out of\nfashion; and the whip and the cane are becoming discredited, not so much\nby the old arguments against corporal punishment (sound as these were)\nas by the gradual wearing away of the veil from the fact that flogging\nis a form of debauchery. The advocate of flogging as a punishment is now\nexposed to very disagreeable suspicions; and ever since Rousseau rose\nto the effort of making a certain very ridiculous confession on the\nsubject, there has been a growing perception that child whipping, even\nfor the children themselves, is not always the innocent and high-minded\npractice it professes to be. At all events there is no getting away\nfrom the facts that families are smaller than they used to be, and\nthat passions which formerly took effect in tyranny have been largely\ndiverted into sentimentality. And though a little sentimentality may be\na very good thing, chronic sentimentality is a horror, more dangerous,\nbecause more possible, than the erotomania which we all condemn when we\nare not thoughtlessly glorifying it as the ideal married state.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOSPEL OF LAODICEA\n\nLet us try to get at the root error of these false domestic doctrines.\nWhy was it that the late Samuel Butler, with a conviction that increased\nwith his experience of life, preached the gospel of Laodicea, urging\npeople to be temperate in what they called goodness as in everything\nelse? Why is it that I, when I hear some well-meaning person exhort\nyoung people to make it a rule to do at least one kind action every\nday, feel very much as I should if I heard them persuade children to\nget drunk at least once every day? Apart from the initial absurdity of\naccepting as permanent a state of things in which there would be in this\ncountry misery enough to supply occasion for several thousand million\nkind actions per annum, the effect on the character of the doers of the\nactions would be so appalling, that one month of any serious attempt\nto carry out such counsels would probably bring about more stringent\nlegislation against actions going beyond the strict letter of the law\nin the way of kindness than we have now against excess in the opposite\ndirection.\n\nThere is no more dangerous mistake than the mistake of supposing that we\ncannot have too much of a good thing. The truth is, an immoderately good\nman is very much more dangerous than an immoderately bad man: that is\nwhy Savonarola was burnt and John of Leyden torn to pieces with red-hot\npincers whilst multitudes of unredeemed rascals were being let off with\nclipped ears, burnt palms, a flogging, or a few years in the galleys.\nThat is why Christianity never got any grip of the world until it\nvirtually reduced its claims on the ordinary citizen's attention to a\ncouple of hours every seventh day, and let him alone on week-days. If\nthe fanatics who are preoccupied day in and day out with their salvation\nwere healthy, virtuous, and wise, the Laodiceanism of the ordinary man\nmight be regarded as a deplorable shortcoming; but, as a matter of fact,\nno more frightful misfortune could threaten us than a general spread of\nfanaticism. What people call goodness has to be kept in check just as\ncarefully as what they call badness; for the human constitution will not\nstand very much of either without serious psychological mischief, ending\nin insanity or crime. The fact that the insanity may be privileged,\nas Savonarola's was up to the point of wrecking the social life of\nFlorence, does not alter the case. We always hesitate to treat a\ndangerously good man as a lunatic because he may turn out to be a\nprophet in the true sense: that is, a man of exceptional sanity who is\nin the right when we are in the wrong. However necessary it may have\nbeen to get rid of Savonarola, it was foolish to poison Socrates and\nburn St. Joan of Arc. But it is none the less necessary to take a firm\nstand against the monstrous proposition that because certain attitudes\nand sentiments may be heroic and admirable at some momentous crisis,\nthey should or can be maintained at the same pitch continuously through\nlife. A life spent in prayer and alms giving is really as insane as a\nlife spent in cursing and picking pockets: the effect of everybody doing\nit would be equally disastrous. The superstitious tolerance so long\naccorded to monks and nuns is inevitably giving way to a very general\nand very natural practice of confiscating their retreats and expelling\nthem from their country, with the result that they come to England and\nIreland, where they are partly unnoticed and partly encouraged because\nthey conduct technical schools and teach our girls softer speech and\ngentler manners than our comparatively ruffianly elementary teachers.\nBut they are still full of the notion that because it is possible for\nmen to attain the summit of Mont Blanc and stay there for an hour, it is\npossible for them to live there. Children are punished and scolded for\nnot living there; and adults take serious offence if it is not assumed\nthat they live there.\n\nAs a matter of fact, ethical strain is just as bad for us as physical\nstrain. It is desirable that the normal pitch of conduct at which men\nare not conscious of being particularly virtuous, although they feel\nmean when they fall below it, should be raised as high as possible; but\nit is not desirable that they should attempt to live above this pitch\nany more than that they should habitually walk at the rate of five\nmiles an hour or carry a hundredweight continually on their backs. Their\nnormal condition should be in nowise difficult or remarkable; and it\nis a perfectly sound instinct that leads us to mistrust the good man\nas much as the bad man, and to object to the clergyman who is pious\nextra-professionally as much as to the professional pugilist who is\nquarrelsome and violent in private life. We do not want good men and bad\nmen any more than we want giants and dwarfs. What we do want is a high\nquality for our normal: that is, people who can be much better than what\nwe now call respectable without self-sacrifice. Conscious goodness,\nlike conscious muscular effort, may be of use in emergencies; but for\neveryday national use it is negligible; and its effect on the character\nof the individual may easily be disastrous.\n\n\n\n\nFOR BETTER FOR WORSE\n\nIt would be hard to find any document in practical daily use in which\nthese obvious truths seem so stupidly overlooked as they are in the\nmarriage service. As we have seen, the stupidity is only apparent:\nthe service was really only an honest attempt to make the best of a\ncommercial contract of property and slavery by subjecting it to some\nreligious restraint and elevating it by some touch of poetry. But the\nactual result is that when two people are under the influence of\nthe most violent, most insane, most delusive, and most transient of\npassions, they are required to swear that they will remain in that\nexcited, abnormal, and exhausting condition continuously until death do\nthem part. And though of course nobody expects them to do anything\nso impossible and so unwholesome, yet the law that regulates their\nrelations, and the public opinion that regulates that law, is actually\nfounded on the assumption that the marriage vow is not only feasible but\nbeautiful and holy, and that if they are false to it, they deserve no\nsympathy and no relief. If all married people really lived together, no\ndoubt the mere force of facts would make an end to this inhuman nonsense\nin a month, if not sooner; but it is very seldom brought to that test.\nThe typical British husband sees much less of his wife than he does of\nhis business partner, his fellow clerk, or whoever works beside him\nday by day. Man and wife do not as a rule, live together: they only\nbreakfast together, dine together, and sleep in the same room. In most\ncases the woman knows nothing of the man's working life and he\nknows nothing of her working life (he calls it her home life). It is\nremarkable that the very people who romance most absurdly about the\ncloseness and sacredness of the marriage tie are also those who are most\nconvinced that the man's sphere and the woman's sphere are so entirely\nseparate that only in their leisure moments can they ever be together. A\nman as intimate with his own wife as a magistrate is with his clerk,\nor a Prime Minister with the leader of the Opposition, is a man in ten\nthousand. The majority of married couples never get to know one another\nat all: they only get accustomed to having the same house, the same\nchildren, and the same income, which is quite a different matter. The\ncomparatively few men who work at home--writers, artists, and to some\nextent clergymen--have to effect some sort of segregation within\nthe house or else run a heavy risk of overstraining their domestic\nrelations. When the pair is so poor that it can afford only a single\nroom, the strain is intolerable: violent quarrelling is the result.\nVery few couples can live in a single-roomed tenement without exchanging\nblows quite frequently. In the leisured classes there is often no real\nfamily life at all. The boys are at a public school; the girls are in\nthe schoolroom in charge of a governess; the husband is at his club or\nin a set which is not his wife's; and the institution of marriage enjoys\nthe credit of a domestic peace which is hardly more intimate than the\nrelations of prisoners in the same gaol or guests at the same garden\nparty. Taking these two cases of the single room and the unearned income\nas the extremes, we might perhaps locate at a guess whereabout on the\nscale between them any particular family stands. But it is clear enough\nthat the one-roomed end, though its conditions enable the marriage vow\nto be carried out with the utmost attainable exactitude, is far less\nendurable in practice, and far more mischievous in its effect on the\nparties concerned, and through them on the community, than the other\nend. Thus we see that the revolt against marriage is by no means only a\nrevolt against its sordidness as a survival of sex slavery. It may even\nplausibly be maintained that this is precisely the part of it that\nworks most smoothly in practice. The revolt is also against its\nsentimentality, its romance, its Amorism, even against its enervating\nhappiness.\n\n\n\n\nWANTED: AN IMMORAL STATESMAN\n\nWe now see that the statesman who undertakes to deal with marriage will\nhave to face an amazingly complicated public opinion. In fact, he will\nhave to leave opinion as far as possible out of the question, and deal\nwith human nature instead. For even if there could be any real public\nopinion in a society like ours, which is a mere mob of classes, each\nwith its own habits and prejudices, it would be at best a jumble of\nsuperstitions and interests, taboos and hypocrisies, which could not\nbe reconciled in any coherent enactment. It would probably proclaim\npassionately that it does not matter in the least what sort of children\nwe have, or how few or how many, provided the children are legitimate.\nAlso that it does not matter in the least what sort of adults we have,\nprovided they are married. No statesman worth the name can possibly act\non these views. He is bound to prefer one healthy illegitimate child\nto ten rickety legitimate ones, and one energetic and capable unmarried\ncouple to a dozen inferior apathetic husbands and wives. If it could\nbe proved that illicit unions produce three children each and marriages\nonly one and a half, he would be bound to encourage illicit unions\nand discourage and even penalize marriage. The common notion that the\nexisting forms of marriage are not political contrivances, but sacred\nethical obligations to which everything, even the very existence of the\nhuman race, must be sacrificed if necessary (and this is what the vulgar\nmorality we mostly profess on the subject comes to) is one on which no\nsane Government could act for a moment; and yet it influences, or is\nbelieved to influence, so many votes, that no Government will touch\nthe marriage question if it can possibly help it, even when there is\na demand for the extension of marriage, as in the case of the recent\nlong-delayed Act legalizing marriage with a deceased wife's sister. When\na reform in the other direction is needed (for example, an extension of\ndivorce), not even the existence of the most unbearable hardships will\ninduce our statesmen to move so long as the victims submit sheepishly,\nthough when they take the remedy into their own hands an inquiry is soon\nbegun. But what is now making some action in the matter imperative is\nneither the sufferings of those who are tied for life to criminals,\ndrunkards, physically unsound and dangerous mates, and worthless and\nunamiable people generally, nor the immorality of the couples condemned\nto celibacy by separation orders which do not annul their marriages, but\nthe fall in the birth rate. Public opinion will not help us out of this\ndifficulty: on the contrary, it will, if it be allowed, punish anybody\nwho mentions it. When Zola tried to repopulate France by writing a novel\nin praise of parentage, the only comment made here was that the book\ncould not possibly be translated into English, as its subject was too\nimproper.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LIMITS OF DEMOCRACY\n\nNow if England had been governed in the past by statesmen willing to be\nruled by such public opinion as that, she would have been wiped off the\npolitical map long ago. The modern notion that democracy means governing\na country according to the ignorance of its majorities is never more\ndisastrous than when there is some question of sexual morals to be dealt\nwith. The business of a democratic statesman is not, as some of us seem\nto think, to convince the voters that he knows no better than they as\nto the methods of attaining their common ends, but on the contrary to\nconvince them that he knows much better than they do, and therefore\ndiffers from them on every possible question of method. The voter's duty\nis to take care that the Government consists of men whom he can trust\nto devize or support institutions making for the common welfare. This\nis highly skilled work; and to be governed by people who set about it\nas the man in the street would set about it is to make straight for \"red\nruin and the breaking up of laws.\" Voltaire said that Mr Everybody is\nwiser than anybody; and whether he is or not, it is his will that must\nprevail; but the will and the way are two very different things. For\nexample, it is the will of the people on a hot day that the means\nof relief from the effects of the heat should be within the reach of\neverybody. Nothing could be more innocent, more hygienic, more important\nto the social welfare. But the way of the people on such occasions is\nmostly to drink large quantities of beer, or, among the more luxurious\nclasses, iced claret cup, lemon squashes, and the like. To take a moral\nillustration, the will to suppress misconduct and secure efficiency\nin work is general and salutary; but the notion that the best and only\neffective way is by complaining, scolding, punishing, and revenging is\nequally general. When Mrs Squeers opened an abscess on her pupil's head\nwith an inky penknife, her object was entirely laudable: her heart was\nin the right place: a statesman interfering with her on the ground that\nhe did not want the boy cured would have deserved impeachment for gross\ntyranny. But a statesman tolerating amateur surgical practice with inky\npenknives in school would be a very bad Minister of Education. It is\non the question of method that your expert comes in; and though I am\ndemocrat enough to insist that he must first convince a representative\nbody of amateurs that his way is the right way and Mrs Squeers's way\nthe wrong way, yet I very strongly object to any tendency to flatter Mrs\nSqueers into the belief that her way is in the least likely to be the\nright way, or that any other test is to be applied to it except the test\nof its effect on human welfare.\n\n\n\n\nTHE SCIENCE AND ART OF POLITICS\n\nPolitical Science means nothing else than the devizing of the best ways\nof fulfilling the will of the world; and, I repeat, it is skilled work.\nOnce the way is discovered, the methods laid down, and the machinery\nprovided, the work of the statesman is done, and that of the official\nbegins. To illustrate, there is no need for the police officer who\ngoverns the street traffic to be or to know any better than the\npeople who obey the wave of his hand. All concerted action involves\nsubordination and the appointment of directors at whose signal the\nothers will act. There is no more need for them to be superior to the\nrest than for the keystone of an arch to be of harder stone than the\ncoping. But when it comes to devizing the directions which are to be\nobeyed: that is, to making new institutions and scraping old ones, then\nyou need aristocracy in the sense of government by the best. A military\nstate organized so as to carry out exactly the impulses of the average\nsoldier would not last a year. The result of trying to make the Church\nof England reflect the notions of the average churchgoer has reduced it\nto a cipher except for the purposes of a petulantly irreligious\nsocial and political club. Democracy as to the thing to be done may\nbe inevitable (hence the vital need for a democracy of supermen); but\ndemocracy as to the way to do it is like letting the passengers drive\nthe train: it can only end in collision and wreck. As a matter of act,\nwe obtain reforms (such as they are), not by allowing the electorate\nto draft statutes, but by persuading it that a certain minister and his\ncabinet are gifted with sufficient political sagacity to find out how to\nproduce the desired result. And the usual penalty of taking advantage of\nthis power to reform our institutions is defeat by a vehement \"swing of\nthe pendulum\" at the next election. Therein lies the peril and the glory\nof democratic statesmanship. A statesman who confines himself to popular\nlegislation--or, for the matter of that, a playwright who confines\nhimself to popular plays--is like a blind man's dog who goes wherever\nthe blind man pulls him, on the ground that both of them want to go to\nthe same place.\n\n\n\n\nWHY STATESMEN SHIRK THE MARRIAGE QUESTION\n\nThe reform of marriage, then, will be a very splendid and very hazardous\nadventure for the Prime Minister who takes it in hand. He will be posted\non every hoarding and denounced in every Opposition paper, especially\nin the sporting papers, as the destroyer of the home, the family, of\ndecency, of morality, of chastity and what not. All the commonplaces of\nthe modern anti-Socialist Noodle's Oration will be hurled at him. And he\nwill have to proceed without the slightest concession to it, giving the\nnoodles nothing but their due in the assurance \"I know how to attain our\nends better than you,\" and staking his political life on the conviction\ncarried by that assurance, which conviction will depend a good deal on\nthe certainty with which it is made, which again can be attained only\nby studying the facts of marriage and understanding the needs of the\nnation. And, after all, he will find that the pious commonplaces on\nwhich he and the electorate are agreed conceal an utter difference in\nthe real ends in view: his being public, far-sighted, and impersonal,\nand those of multitudes of the electorate narrow, personal, jealous, and\ncorrupt. Under such circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that the\nmere mention of the marriage question makes a British Cabinet shiver\nwith apprehension and hastily pass on to safer business. Nevertheless\nthe reform of marriage cannot be put off for ever. When its hour comes,\nwhat are the points the Cabinet will have to take up?\n\n\n\n\nTHE QUESTION OF POPULATION\n\nFirst, it will have to make up its mind as to how many people we want in\nthe country. If we want less than at present, we must ascertain how\nmany less; and if we allow the reduction to be made by the continued\noperation of the present sterilization of marriage, we must settle how\nthe process is to be stopped when it has gone far enough. But if we\ndesire to maintain the population at its present figure, or to increase\nit, we must take immediate steps to induce people of moderate means to\nmarry earlier and to have more children. There is less urgency in the\ncase of the very poor and the very rich. They breed recklessly: the rich\nbecause they can afford it, and the poor because they cannot afford\nthe precautions by which the artisans and the middle classes avoid big\nfamilies. Nevertheless the population declines, because the high birth\nrate of the very poor is counterbalanced by a huge infantile-mortality\nin the slums, whilst the very rich are also the very few, and are\nbecoming sterilized by the spreading revolt of their women against\nexcessive childbearing--sometimes against any childbearing.\n\nThis last cause is important. It cannot be removed by any economic\nreadjustment. If every family were provided with 10,000 pounds a year\ntomorrow, women would still refuse more and more to continue bearing\nchildren until they are exhausted whilst numbers of others are bearing\nno children at all. Even if every woman bearing and rearing a valuable\nchild received a handsome series of payments, thereby making motherhood\na real profession as it ought to be, the number of women able or willing\nto give more of their lives to gestation and nursing than three or\nfour children would cost them might not be very large if the advance in\nsocial organization and conscience indicated by such payments involved\nalso the opening up of other means of livelihood to women. And it must\nbe remembered that urban civilization itself, insofar as it is a method\nof evolution (and when it is not this, it is simply a nuisance), is a\nsterilizing process as far as numbers go. It is harder to keep up the\nsupply of elephants than of sparrows and rabbits; and for the same\nreason it will be harder to keep up the supply of highly cultivated men\nand women than it now is of agricultural laborers. Bees get out of this\ndifficulty by a special system of feeding which enables a queen bee\nto produce 4,000 eggs a day whilst the other females lose their sex\naltogether and become workers supporting the males in luxury and\nidleness until the queen has found her mate, when the queen kills\nhim and the quondam females kill all the rest (such at least are the\naccounts given by romantic naturalists of the matter).\n\n\n\n\nTHE RIGHT TO MOTHERHOOD\n\nThis system certainly shews a much higher development of social\nintelligence than our marriage system; but if it were physically\npossible to introduce it into human society it would be wrecked by an\nopposite and not less important revolt of women: that is, the revolt\nagainst compulsory barrenness. In this two classes of women are\nconcerned: those who, though they have no desire for the presence or\ncare of children, nevertheless feel that motherhood is an experience\nnecessary to their complete psychical development and understanding of\nthemselves and others, and those who, though unable to find or unwilling\nto entertain a husband, would like to occupy themselves with the rearing\nof children. My own experience of discussing this question leads me\nto believe that the one point on which all women are in furious secret\nrebellion against the existing law is the saddling of the right to a\nchild with the obligation to become the servant of a man. Adoption,\nor the begging or buying or stealing of another woman's child, is no\nremedy: it does not provide the supreme experience of bearing the child.\nNo political constitution will ever succeed or deserve to succeed unless\nit includes the recognition of an absolute right to sexual experience,\nand is untainted by the Pauline or romantic view of such experience as\nsinful in itself. And since this experience in its fullest sense must be\ncarried in the case of women to the point of childbearing, it can only\nbe reconciled with the acceptance of marriage with the child's father by\nlegalizing polygyny, because there are more adult women in the country\nthan men. Now though polygyny prevails throughout the greater part of\nthe British Empire, and is as practicable here as in India, there is a\ngood deal to be said against it, and still more to be felt. However,\nlet us put our feelings aside for a moment, and consider the question\npolitically.\n\n\n\n\nMONOGAMY, POLYGYNY AND POLYANDRY\n\nThe number of wives permitted to a single husband or of husbands to\na single wife under a marriage system, is not an ethical problem: it\ndepends solely on the proportion of the sexes in the population. If in\nconsequence of a great war three-quarters of the men in this country\nwere killed, it would be absolutely necessary to adopt the Mohammedan\nallowance of four wives to each man in order to recruit the population.\nThe fundamental reason for not allowing women to risk their lives in\nbattle and for giving them the first chance of escape in all dangerous\nemergencies: in short, for treating their lives as more valuable than\nmale lives, is not in the least a chivalrous reason, though men may\nconsent to it under the illusion of chivalry. It is a simple matter of\nnecessity; for if a large proportion of women were killed or\ndisabled, no possible readjustment of our marriage law could avert the\ndepopulation and consequent political ruin of the country, because a\nwoman with several husbands bears fewer children than a woman with one,\nwhereas a man can produce as many families as he has wives. The\nnatural foundation of the institution of monogamy is not any inherent\nviciousness in polygyny or polyandry, but the hard fact that men and\nwomen are born in about equal numbers. Unfortunately, we kill so many\nof our male children in infancy that we are left with a surplus of adult\nwomen which is sufficiently large to claim attention, and yet not large\nenough to enable every man to have two wives. Even if it were, we should\nbe met by an economic difficulty. A Kaffir is rich in proportion to the\nnumber of his wives, because the women are the breadwinners. But in our\ncivilization women are not paid for their social work in the bearing and\nrearing of children and the ordering of households; they are quartered\non the wages of their husbands. At least four out of five of our men\ncould not afford two wives unless their wages were nearly doubled. Would\nit not then be well to try unlimited polygyny; so that the remaining\nfifth could have as many wives apiece as they could afford? Let us see\nhow this would work.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MALE REVOLT AGAINST POLYGYNY\n\nExperience shews that women do not object to polygyny when it is\ncustomary: on the contrary, they are its most ardent supporters. The\nreason is obvious. The question, as it presents itself in practice to\na woman, is whether it is better to have, say, a whole share in a\ntenth-rate man or a tenth share in a first-rate man. Substitute the word\nIncome for the word Man, and you will have the question as it presents\nitself economically to the dependent woman. The woman whose instincts\nare maternal, who desires superior children more than anything else,\nnever hesitates. She would take a thousandth share, if necessary, in a\nhusband who was a man in a thousand, rather than have some comparatively\nweedy weakling all to herself. It is the comparatively weedy weakling,\nleft mateless by polygyny, who objects. Thus, it was not the women of\nSalt Lake City nor even of America who attacked Mormon polygyny. It\nwas the men. And very naturally. On the other hand, women object to\npolyandry, because polyandry enables the best women to monopolize all\nthe men, just as polygyny enables the best men to monopolize all the\nwomen. That is why all our ordinary men and women are unanimous in\ndefence of monogamy, the men because it excludes polygyny, and the women\nbecause it excludes polyandry. The women, left to themselves, would\ntolerate polygyny. The men, left to themselves, would tolerate\npolyandry. But polygyny would condemn a great many men, and polyandry a\ngreat many women, to the celibacy of neglect. Hence the resistance any\nattempt to establish unlimited polygyny always provokes, not from the\nbest people, but from the mediocrities and the inferiors. If we\ncould get rid of our inferiors and screw up our average quality until\nmediocrity ceased to be a reproach, thus making every man reasonably\neligible as a father and every woman reasonably desirable as a mother,\npolygyny and polyandry would immediately fall into sincere disrepute,\nbecause monogamy is so much more convenient and economical that nobody\nwould want to share a husband or a wife if he (or she) could have a\nsufficiently good one all to himself (or herself). Thus it appears that\nit is the scarcity of husbands or wives of high quality that leads woman\nto polygyny and men to polyandry, and that if this scarcity were cured,\nmonogamy, in the sense of having only one husband or wife at a\ntime (facilities for changing are another matter), would be found\nsatisfactory.\n\n\n\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN ORIENTAL AND OCCIDENTAL POLYGYNY\n\nIt may now be asked why the polygynist nations have not gravitated to\nmonogamy, like the latter-day saints of Salt Lake City. The answer is\nnot far to seek: their polygyny is limited. By the Mohammedan law a man\ncannot marry more than four wives; and by the unwritten law of necessity\nno man can keep more wives than he can afford; so that a man with\nfour wives must be quite as exceptional in Asia as a man with a\ncarriage-and-pair or a motor car is in Europe, where, nevertheless we\nmay all have as many carriages and motors as we can afford to pay for.\nKulin polygyny, though unlimited, is not really a popular institution:\nif you are a person of high caste you pay another person of very august\ncaste indeed to make your daughter momentarily one of his sixty or\nseventy momentary wives for the sake of ennobling your grandchildren;\nbut this fashion of a small and intensely snobbish class is negligible\nas a general precedent. In any case, men and women in the East do not\nmarry anyone they fancy, as in England and America. Women are secluded\nand marriages are arranged. In Salt Lake City the free unsecluded woman\ncould see and meet the ablest man of the community, and tempt him\nto make her his tenth wife by all the arts peculiar to women in\nEnglish-speaking countries. No eastern woman can do anything of the\nsort. The man alone has any initiative; but he has no access to the\nwoman; besides, as we have seen, the difficulty created by male license\nis not polygyny but polyandry, which is not allowed.\n\nConsequently, if we are to make polygyny a success, we must limit it.\nIf we have two women to every one man, we must allow each man only two\nwives. That is simple; but unfortunately our own actual proportion is,\nroughly, something like 1 1\/11 woman to 1 man. Now you cannot enact that\neach man shall be allowed 1 1\/11 wives, or that each woman who cannot\nget a husband all to herself shall divide herself between eleven already\nmarried husbands. Thus there is no way out for us through polygyny.\nThere is no way at all out of the present system of condemning the\nsuperfluous women to barrenness, except by legitimizing the children of\nwomen who are not married to the fathers.\n\n\n\n\nTHE OLD MAID'S RIGHT TO MOTHERHOOD\n\nNow the right to bear children without taking a husband could not be\nconfined to women who are superfluous in the monogamic reckoning. There\nis the practical difficulty that although in our population there\nare about a million monogamically superfluous women, yet it is quite\nimpossible to say of any given unmarried woman that she is one of the\nsuperfluous. And there is the difficulty of principle. The right to bear\na child, perhaps the most sacred of all women's rights, is not one that\nshould have any conditions attached to it except in the interests of\nrace welfare. There are many women of admirable character, strong,\ncapable, independent, who dislike the domestic habits of men; have no\nnatural turn for mothering and coddling them; and find the concession of\nconjugal rights to any person under any conditions intolerable by their\nself-respect. Yet the general sense of the community recognizes in these\nvery women the fittest people to have charge of children, and trusts\nthem, as school mistresses and matrons of institutions, more than women\nof any other type when it is possible to procure them for such work. Why\nshould the taking of a husband be imposed on these women as the price of\ntheir right to maternity? I am quite unable to answer that question.\nI see a good deal of first-rate maternal ability and sagacity spending\nitself on bees and poultry and village schools and cottage hospitals;\nand I find myself repeatedly asking myself why this valuable strain in\nthe national breed should be sterilized. Unfortunately, the very women\nwhom we should tempt to become mothers for the good of the race are the\nvery last people to press their services on their country in that way.\nPlato long ago pointed out the importance of being governed by men with\nsufficient sense of responsibility and comprehension of public duties\nto be very reluctant to undertake the work of governing; and yet we\nhave taken his instruction so little to heart that we are at present\nsuffering acutely from government by gentlemen who will stoop to all the\nmean shifts of electioneering and incur all its heavy expenses for the\nsake of a seat in Parliament. But what our sentimentalists have not\nyet been told is that exactly the same thing applies to maternity as to\ngovernment. The best mothers are not those who are so enslaved by their\nprimitive instincts that they will bear children no matter how hard the\nconditions are, but precisely those who place a very high price on their\nservices, and are quite prepared to become old maids if the price is\nrefused, and even to feel relieved at their escape. Our democratic and\nmatrimonial institutions may have their merits: at all events they are\nmostly reforms of something worse; but they put a premium on want of\nself-respect in certain very important matters; and the consequence is\nthat we are very badly governed and are, on the whole, an ugly, mean,\nill-bred race.\n\n\n\n\nIBSEN'S CHAIN STITCH\n\nLet us not forget, however, in our sympathy for the superfluous women,\nthat their children must have fathers as well as mothers. Who are the\nfathers to be? All monogamists and married women will reply hastily:\neither bachelors or widowers; and this solution will serve as well as\nanother; for it would be hypocritical to pretend that the difficulty is\na practical one. None the less, the monogamists, after due reflection,\nwill point out that if there are widowers enough the superfluous women\nare not really superfluous, and therefore there is no reason why the\nparties should not marry respectably like other people. And they might\nin that case be right if the reasons were purely numerical: that is,\nif every woman were willing to take a husband if one could be found\nfor her, and every man willing to take a wife on the same terms; also,\nplease remember, if widows would remain celibate to give the unmarried\nwomen a chance. These ifs will not work. We must recognize two classes\nof old maids: one, the really superfluous women, and the other, the\nwomen who refuse to accept maternity on the (to them) unbearable\ncondition of taking a husband. From both classes may, perhaps, be\nsubtracted for the present the large proportion of women who could\nnot afford the extra expense of one or more children. I say \"perhaps,\"\nbecause it is by no means sure that within reasonable limits mothers do\nnot make a better fight for subsistence, and have not, on the whole, a\nbetter time than single women. In any case, we have two distinct cases\nto deal with: the superfluous and the voluntary; and it is the voluntary\nwhose grit we are most concerned to fertilize. But here, again,\nwe cannot put our finger on any particular case and pick out Miss\nRobinson's as superfluous, and Miss Wilkinson's as voluntary. Whether we\nlegitimize the child of the unmarried woman as a duty to the superfluous\nor as a bribe to the voluntary, the practical result must be the same:\nto wit, that the condition of marriage now attached to legitimate\nparentage will be withdrawn from all women, and fertile unions outside\nmarriage recognized by society. Now clearly the consequences would not\nstop there. The strong-minded ladies who are resolved to be mistresses\nin their own houses would not be the only ones to take advantage of the\nnew law. Even women to whom a home without a man in it would be no home\nat all, and who fully intended, if the man turned out to be the right\none, to live with him exactly as married couples live, would, if they\nwere possessed of independent means, have every inducement to adopt the\nnew conditions instead of the old ones. Only the women whose sole means\nof livelihood was wifehood would insist on marriage: hence a tendency\nwould set in to make marriage more and more one of the customs imposed\nby necessity on the poor, whilst the freer form of union, regulated,\nno doubt, by settlements and private contracts of various kinds, would\nbecome the practice of the rich: that is, would become the fashion.\nAt which point nothing but the achievement of economic independence by\nwomen, which is already seen clearly ahead of us, would be needed to\nmake marriage disappear altogether, not by formal abolition, but by\nsimple disuse. The private contract stage of this process was reached in\nancient Rome. The only practicable alternative to it seems to be such\nan extension of divorce as will reduce the risks and obligations of\nmarriage to a degree at which they will be no worse than those of the\nalternatives to marriage. As we shall see, this is the solution to which\nall the arguments tend. Meanwhile, note how much reason a statesman has\nto pause before meddling with an institution which, unendurable as its\ndrawbacks are, threatens to come to pieces in all directions if a\nsingle thread of it be cut. Ibsen's similitude of the machine-made chain\nstitch, which unravels the whole seam at the first pull when a single\nstitch is ripped, is very applicable to the knot of marriage.\n\n\n\n\nREMOTENESS OF THE FACTS FROM THE IDEAL\n\nBut before we allow this to deter us from touching the sacred fabric,\nwe must find out whether it is not already coming to pieces in all\ndirections by the continuous strain of circumstances. No doubt, if it\nwere all that it pretends to be, and human nature were working smoothly\nwithin its limits, there would be nothing more to be said: it would\nbe let alone as it always is let alone during the cruder stages of\ncivilization. But the moment we refer to the facts, we discover that the\nideal matrimony and domesticity which our bigots implore us to preserve\nas the corner stone of our society is a figment: what we have really got\nis something very different, questionable at its best, and abominable\nat its worst. The word pure, so commonly applied to it by thoughtless\npeople, is absurd; because if they do not mean celibate by it, they\nmean nothing; and if they do mean celibate, then marriage is legalized\nimpurity, a conclusion which is offensive and inhuman. Marriage as a\nfact is not in the least like marriage as an ideal. If it were, the\nsudden changes which have been made on the continent from indissoluble\nRoman Catholic marriage to marriage that can be dissolved by a box on\nthe ear as in France, by an epithet as in Germany, or simply at the wish\nof both parties as in Sweden, not to mention the experiments made\nby some of the American States, would have shaken society to its\nfoundations. Yet they have produced so little effect that Englishmen\nopen their eyes in surprise when told of their existence.\n\n\n\n\nDIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING EVIDENCE\n\nAs to what actual marriage is, one would like evidence instead\nof guesses; but as all departures from the ideal are regarded as\ndisgraceful, evidence cannot be obtained; for when the whole community\nis indicted, nobody will go into the witness-box for the prosecution.\nSome guesses we can make with some confidence. For example, if it be\nobjected to any change that our bachelors and widowers would no longer\nbe Galahads, we may without extravagance or cynicism reply that many\nof them are not Galahads now, and that the only change would be that\nhypocrisy would no longer be compulsory. Indeed, this can hardly be\ncalled guessing: the evidence is in the streets. But when we attempt to\nfind out the truth about our marriages, we cannot even guess with\nany confidence. Speaking for myself, I can say that I know the inside\nhistory of perhaps half a dozen marriages. Any family solicitor knows\nmore than this; but even a family solicitor, however large his practice,\nknows nothing of the million households which have no solicitors, and\nwhich nevertheless make marriage what it really is. And all he can say\ncomes to no more than I can say: to wit, that no marriage of which I\nhave any knowledge is in the least like the ideal marriage. I do not\nmean that it is worse: I mean simply that it is different. Also, far\nfrom society being organized in a defence of its ideal so jealous and\nimplacable that the least step from the straight path means exposure\nand ruin, it is almost impossible by any extravagance of misconduct to\nprovoke society to relax its steady pretence of blindness, unless you do\none or both of two fatal things. One is to get into the newspapers; and\nthe other is to confess. If you confess misconduct to respectable men or\nwomen, they must either disown you or become virtually your accomplices:\nthat is why they are so angry with you for confessing. If you get into\nthe papers, the pretence of not knowing becomes impossible. But it is\nhardly too much to say that if you avoid these two perils, you can do\nanything you like, as far as your neighbors are concerned. And since we\ncan hardly flatter ourselves that this is the effect of charity, it\nis difficult not to suspect that our extraordinary forbearance in the\nmatter of stone throwing is that suggested in the well-known parable of\nthe women taken in adultery which some early free-thinker slipped into\nthe Gospel of St John: namely, that we all live in glass houses. We may\ntake it, then, that the ideal husband and the ideal wife are no more\nreal human beings than the cherubim. Possibly the great majority keeps\nits marriage vows in the technical divorce court sense. No husband or\nwife yet born keeps them or ever can keep them in the ideal sense.\n\n\n\n\nMARRIAGE AS A MAGIC SPELL\n\nThe truth which people seem to overlook in this matter is that the\nmarriage ceremony is quite useless as a magic spell for changing in an\ninstant the nature of the relations of two human beings to one another.\nIf a man marries a woman after three weeks acquaintance, and the day\nafter meets a woman he has known for twenty years, he finds, sometimes\nto his own irrational surprise and his wife's equally irrational\nindignation, that his wife is a stranger to him, and the other woman an\nold friend. Also, there is no hocus pocus that can possibly be devized\nwith rings and veils and vows and benedictions that can fix either a\nman's or woman's affection for twenty minutes, much less twenty years.\nEven the most affectionate couples must have moments during which they\nare far more conscious of one another's faults than of one another's\nattractions. There are couples who dislike one another furiously for\nseveral hours at a time; there are couples who dislike one another\npermanently; and there are couples who never dislike one another; but\nthese last are people who are incapable of disliking anybody. If they\ndo not quarrel, it is not because they are married, but because they\nare not quarrelsome. The people who are quarrelsome quarrel with their\nhusbands and wives just as easily as with their servants and relatives\nand acquaintances: marriage makes no difference. Those who talk and\nwrite and legislate as if all this could be prevented by making\nsolemn vows that it shall not happen, are either insincere, insane,\nor hopelessly stupid. There is some sense in a contract to perform or\nabstain from actions that are reasonably within voluntary control; but\nsuch contracts are only needed to provide against the possibility of\neither party being no longer desirous of the specified performance or\nabstention. A person proposing or accepting a contract not only to do\nsomething but to like doing it would be certified as mad. Yet popular\nsuperstition credits the wedding rite with the power of fixing our\nfancies or affections for life even under the most unnatural conditions.\n\n\n\n\nTHE IMPERSONALITY OF SEX\n\nIt is necessary to lay some stress on these points, because few realize\nthe extent to which we proceed on the assumption that marriage is a\nshort cut to perfect and permanent intimacy and affection. But there\nis a still more unworkable assumption which must be discarded before\ndiscussions of marriage can get into any sort of touch with the facts\nof life. That assumption is that the specific relation which marriage\nauthorizes between the parties is the most intimate and personal of\nhuman relations, and embraces all the other high human relations.\nNow this is violently untrue. Every adult knows that the relation in\nquestion can and does exist between entire strangers, different\nin language, color, tastes, class, civilization, morals, religion,\ncharacter: in everything, in short, except their bodily homology and\nthe reproductive appetite common to all living organisms. Even hatred,\ncruelty, and contempt are not incompatible with it; and jealousy and\nmurder are as near to it as affectionate friendship. It is true that it\nis a relation beset with wildly extravagant illusions for inexperienced\npeople, and that even the most experienced people have not always\nsufficient analytic faculty to disentangle it from the sentiments,\nsympathetic or abhorrent, which may spring up through the other\nrelations which are compulsorily attached to it by our laws, or\nsentimentally associated with it in romance. But the fact remains that\nthe most disastrous marriages are those founded exclusively on it, and\nthe most successful those in which it has been least considered, and in\nwhich the decisive considerations have had nothing to do with sex,\nsuch as liking, money, congeniality of tastes, similarity of habits,\nsuitability of class, &c., &c.\n\nIt is no doubt necessary under existing circumstances for a woman\nwithout property to be sexually attractive, because she must get married\nto secure a livelihood; and the illusions of sexual attraction\nwill cause the imagination of young men to endow her with every\naccomplishment and virtue that can make a wife a treasure. The\nattraction being thus constantly and ruthlessly used as a bait, both by\nindividuals and by society, any discussion tending to strip it of its\nillusions and get at its real natural history is nervously discouraged.\nBut nothing can well be more unwholesome for everybody than the\nexaggeration and glorification of an instinctive function which clouds\nthe reason and upsets the judgment more than all the other instincts put\ntogether. The process may be pleasant and romantic; but the consequences\nare not. It would be far better for everyone, as well as far honester,\nif young people were taught that what they call love is an appetite\nwhich, like all other appetites, is destroyed for the moment by its\ngratification; that no profession, promise, or proposal made under its\ninfluence should bind anybody; and that its great natural purpose so\ncompletely transcends the personal interests of any individual or even\nof any ten generations of individuals that it should be held to be an\nact of prostitution and even a sort of blasphemy to attempt to turn it\nto account by exacting a personal return for its gratification,\nwhether by process of law or not. By all means let it be the subject of\ncontracts with society as to its consequences; but to make marriage an\nopen trade in it as at present, with money, board and lodging, personal\nslavery, vows of eternal exclusive personal sentimentalities and the\nrest of it as the price, is neither virtuous, dignified, nor decent. No\nhusband ever secured his domestic happiness and honor, nor has any\nwife ever secured hers, by relying on it. No private claims of any sort\nshould be founded on it: the real point of honor is to take no corrupt\nadvantage of it. When we hear of young women being led astray and the\nlike, we find that what has led them astray is a sedulously inculcated\nfalse notion that the relation they are tempted to contract is so\nintensely personal, and the vows made under the influence of its\ntransient infatuation so sacred and enduring, that only an atrociously\nwicked man could make light of or forget them. What is more, as the\nsame fantastic errors are inculcated in men, and the conscientious ones\ntherefore feel bound in honor to stand by what they have promised,\none of the surest methods to obtain a husband is to practise on his\nsusceptibilities until he is either carried away into a promise of\nmarriage to which he can be legally held, or else into an indiscretion\nwhich he must repair by marriage on pain of having to regard himself as\na scoundrel and a seducer, besides facing the utmost damage the lady's\nrelatives can do him.\n\nSuch a transaction is not an entrance into a \"holy state of matrimony\":\nit is as often as not the inauguration of a lifelong squabble, a\ncorroding grudge, that causes more misery and degradation of character\nthan a dozen entirely natural \"desertions\" and \"betrayals.\" Yet the\nnumber of marriages effected more or less in this way must be enormous.\nWhen people say that love should be free, their words, taken literally,\nmay be foolish; but they are only expressing inaccurately a very\nreal need for the disentanglement of sexual relations from a mass of\nexorbitant and irrelevant conditions imposed on them on false pretences\nto enable needy parents to get their daughters \"off their hands\" and to\nkeep those who are already married effectually enslaved by one another.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ECONOMIC SLAVERY OF WOMEN\n\nOne of the consequences of basing marriage on the considerations stated\nwith cold abhorrence by Saint Paul in the seventh chapter of his epistle\nto the Corinthians, as being made necessary by the unlikeness of most\nmen to himself, is that the sex slavery involved has become complicated\nby economic slavery; so that whilst the man defends marriage because he\nis really defending his pleasures, the woman is even more vehement on\nthe same side because she is defending her only means of livelihood.\nTo a woman without property or marketable talent a husband is more\nnecessary than a master to a dog. There is nothing more wounding to our\nsense of human dignity than the husband hunting that begins in every\nfamily when the daughters become marriageable; but it is inevitable\nunder existing circumstances; and the parents who refuse to engage in it\nare bad parents, though they may be superior individuals. The cubs of a\nhumane tigress would starve; and the daughters of women who cannot bring\nthemselves to devote several years of their lives to the pursuit of\nsons-in-law often have to expatiate their mother's squeamishness by\nlife-long celibacy and indigence. To ask a young man his intentions when\nyou know he has no intentions, but is unable to deny that he has paid\nattentions; to threaten an action for breach of promise of marriage; to\npretend that your daughter is a musician when she has with the greatest\ndifficulty been coached into playing three piano-forte pieces which she\nloathes; to use your own mature charms to attract men to the house when\nyour daughters have no aptitude for that department of sport; to coach\nthem, when they have, in the arts by which men can be led to compromize\nthemselves; and to keep all the skeletons carefully locked up in the\nfamily cupboard until the prey is duly hunted down and bagged: all this\nis a mother's duty today; and a very revolting duty it is: one that\ndisposes of the conventional assumption that it is in the faithful\ndischarge of her home duties that a woman finds her self-respect. The\ntruth is that family life will never be decent, much less ennobling,\nuntil this central horror of the dependence of women on men is done\naway with. At present it reduces the difference between marriage and\nprostitution to the difference between Trade Unionism and unorganized\ncasual labor: a huge difference, no doubt, as to order and comfort, but\nnot a difference in kind.\n\nHowever, it is not by any reform of the marriage laws that this can\nbe dealt with. It is in the general movement for the prevention\nof destitution that the means for making women independent of the\ncompulsory sale of their persons, in marriage or otherwise, will be\nfound; but meanwhile those who deal specifically with the marriage laws\nshould never allow themselves for a moment to forget this abomination\nthat \"plucks the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love,\nand sets a blister there,\" and then calmly calls itself purity, home,\nmotherhood, respectability, honor, decency, and any other fine name\nthat happens to be convenient, not to mention the foul epithets it hurls\nfreely at those who are ashamed of it.\n\n\n\n\nUNPOPULARITY OF IMPERSONAL VIEWS\n\nUnfortunately it is very hard to make an average citizen take impersonal\nviews of any sort in matters affecting personal comfort or conduct. We\nmay be enthusiastic Liberals or Conservatives without any hope of seats\nin Parliament, knighthoods, or posts in the Government, because party\npolitics do not make the slightest difference in our daily lives and\ntherefore cost us nothing. But to take a vital process in which we are\nkeenly interested personal instruments, and ask us to regard it, and\nfeel about it, and legislate on it, wholly as if it were an impersonal\none, is to make a higher demand than most people seem capable of\nresponding to. We all have personal interests in marriage which we are\nnot prepared to sink. It is not only the women who want to get married:\nthe men do too, sometimes on sentimental grounds, sometimes on the\nmore sordid calculation that bachelor life is less comfortable and more\nexpensive, since a wife pays for her status with domestic service as\nwell as with the other services expected of her. Now that children are\navoidable, this calculation is becoming more common and conscious than\nit was: a result which is regarded as \"a steady improvement in general\nmorality.\"\n\n\n\n\nIMPERSONALITY IS NOT PROMISCUITY\n\nThere is, too, a really appalling prevalence of the superstition that\nthe sexual instinct in men is utterly promiscuous, and that the\nleast relaxation of law and custom must produce a wild outbreak of\nlicentiousness. As far as our moralists can grasp the proposition that\nwe should deal with the sexual relation as impersonal, it seems to\nthem to mean that we should encourage it to be promiscuous: hence their\nrecoil from it. But promiscuity and impersonality are not the same\nthing. No man ever fell in love with the entire female sex, nor any\nwoman with the entire male sex. We often do not fall in love at all;\nand when we do we fall in love with one person and remain indifferent\nto thousands of others who pass before our eyes every day. Selection,\ncarried even to such fastidiousness as to induce people to say quite\ncommonly that there is only one man or woman in the world for them, is\nthe rule in nature. If anyone doubts this, let him open a shop for the\nsale of picture postcards, and, when an enamoured lady customer demands\na portrait of her favorite actor or a gentleman of his favorite actress,\ntry to substitute some other portrait on the ground that since the\nsexual instinct is promiscuous, one portrait is as pleasing as another.\nI suppose no shopkeeper has ever been foolish enough to do such a thing;\nand yet all our shopkeepers, the moment a discussion arises on marriage,\nwill passionately argue against all reform on the ground that nothing\nbut the most severe coercion can save their wives and daughters from\nquite indiscriminate rapine.\n\n\n\n\nDOMESTIC CHANGE OF AIR\n\nOur relief at the morality of the reassurance that man is not\npromiscuous in his fancies must not blind us to the fact that he is (to\nuse the word coined by certain American writers to describe themselves)\nsomething of a Varietist. Even those who say there is only one man or\nwoman in the world for them, find that it is not always the same man or\nwoman. It happens that our law permits us to study this phenomenon among\nentirely law-abiding people. I know one lady who has been married five\ntimes. She is, as might be expected, a wise, attractive, and interesting\nwoman. The question is, is she wise, attractive, and interesting because\nshe has been married five times, or has she been married five times\nbecause she is wise, attractive, and interesting? Probably some of the\ntruth lies both ways. I also know of a household consisting of three\nfamilies, A having married first B, and then C, who afterwards married\nD. All three unions were fruitful; so that the children had a change\nboth of fathers and mothers. Now I cannot honestly say that these and\nsimilar cases have convinced me that people are the worse for a change.\nThe lady who has married and managed five husbands must be much\nmore expert at it than most monogamic ladies; and as a companion and\ncounsellor she probably leaves them nowhere. Mr Kipling's question,\n\n\"What can they know of England that only England know?\"\n\ndisposes not only of the patriots who are so patriotic that they never\nleave their own country to look at another, but of the citizens who are\nso domestic that they have never married again and never loved anyone\nexcept their own husbands and wives. The domestic doctrinaires are\nalso the dull people. The impersonal relation of sex may be judicially\nreserved for one person; but any such reservation of friendship,\naffection, admiration, sympathy and so forth is only possible to\na wretchedly narrow and jealous nature; and neither history nor\ncontemporary society shews us a single amiable and respectable character\ncapable of it. This has always been recognized in cultivated society:\nthat is why poor people accuse cultivated society of profligacy, poor\npeople being often so ignorant and uncultivated that they have nothing\nto offer each other but the sex relationship, and cannot conceive why\nmen and women should associate for any other purpose.\n\nAs to the children of the triple household, they were not only on\nexcellent terms with one another, and never thought of any distinction\nbetween their full and their half brothers and sisters; but they had\nthe superior sociability which distinguishes the people who live in\ncommunities from those who live in small families.\n\nThe inference is that changes of partners are not in themselves\ninjurious or undesirable. People are not demoralized by them when they\nare effected according to law. Therefore we need not hesitate to alter\nthe law merely because the alteration would make such changes easier.\n\n\n\n\nHOME MANNERS ARE BAD MANNERS\n\nOn the other hand, we have all seen the bonds of marriage vilely abused\nby people who are never classed with shrews and wife-beaters: they are\nindeed sometimes held up as models of domesticity because they do\nnot drink nor gamble nor neglect their children nor tolerate dirt and\nuntidiness, and because they are not amiable enough to have what\nare called amiable weaknesses. These terrors conceive marriage as a\ndispensation from all the common civilities and delicacies which they\nhave to observe among strangers, or, as they put it, \"before company.\"\nAnd here the effects of indissoluble marriage-for-better-for-worse are\nvery plainly and disagreeably seen. If such people took their domestic\nmanners into general society, they would very soon find themselves\nwithout a friend or even an acquaintance in the world. There are women\nwho, through total disuse, have lost the power of kindly human speech\nand can only scold and complain: there are men who grumble and nag from\ninveterate habit even when they are comfortable. But their unfortunate\nspouses and children cannot escape from them.\n\n\n\n\nSPURIOUS \"NATURAL\" AFFECTION\n\nWhat is more, they are protected from even such discomfort as the\ndislike of his prisoners may cause to a gaoler by the hypnotism of the\nconvention that the natural relation between husband and wife and\nparent and child is one of intense affection, and that to feel any other\nsentiment towards a member of one's family is to be a monster. Under the\ninfluence of the emotion thus manufactured the most detestable people\nare spoilt with entirely undeserved deference, obedience, and even\naffection whilst they live, and mourned when they die by those whose\nlives they wantonly or maliciously made miserable. And this is what we\ncall natural conduct. Nothing could well be less natural. That such a\nconvention should have been established shews that the indissolubility\nof marriage creates such intolerable situations that only by beglamoring\nthe human imagination with a hypnotic suggestion of wholly unnatural\nfeelings can it be made to keep up appearances.\n\nIf the sentimental theory of family relationship encourages bad manners\nand personal slovenliness and uncleanness in the home, it also, in\nthe case of sentimental people, encourages the practice of rousing\nand playing on the affections of children prematurely and far too\nfrequently. The lady who says that as her religion is love, her children\nshall be brought up in an atmosphere of love, and institutes a system of\nsedulous endearments and exchanges of presents and conscious and studied\nacts of artificial kindness, may be defeated in a large family by the\nhealthy derision and rebellion of children who have acquired hardihood\nand common sense in their conflicts with one another. But the small\nfamilies, which are the rule just now, succumb more easily; and in\nthe case of a single sensitive child the effect of being forced in a\nhothouse atmosphere of unnatural affection may be disastrous.\n\nIn short, whichever way you take it, the convention that marriage and\nfamily relationship produces special feelings which alter the nature of\nhuman intercourse is a mischievous one. The whole difficulty of bringing\nup a family well is the difficulty of making its members behave as\nconsiderately at home as on a visit in a strange house, and as frankly,\nkindly, and easily in a strange house as at home. In the middle classes,\nwhere the segregation of the artificially limited family in its little\nbrick box is horribly complete, bad manners, ugly dresses, awkwardness,\ncowardice, peevishness, and all the petty vices of unsociability\nflourish like mushrooms in a cellar. In the upper class, where families\nare not limited for money reasons; where at least two houses and\nsometimes three or four are the rule (not to mention the clubs); where\nthere is travelling and hotel life; and where the men are brought up,\nnot in the family, but in public schools, universities, and the naval\nand military services, besides being constantly in social training in\nother people's houses, the result is to produce what may be called, in\ncomparison with the middle class, something that might almost pass as a\ndifferent and much more sociable species. And in the very poorest class,\nwhere people have no homes, only sleeping places, and consequently\nlive practically in the streets, sociability again appears, leaving\nthe middle class despised and disliked for its helpless and offensive\nunsociability as much by those below it as those above it, and yet\nignorant enough to be proud of it, and to hold itself up as a model\nfor the reform of the (as it considers) elegantly vicious rich and\nprofligate poor alike.\n\n\n\n\nCARRYING THE WAR INTO THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY\n\nWithout pretending to exhaust the subject, I have said enough to make\nit clear that the moment we lose the desire to defend our present\nmatrimonial and family arrangements, there will be no difficulty in\nmaking out an overwhelming case against them. No doubt until then we\nshall continue to hold up the British home as the Holy of Holies in the\ntemple of honorable motherhood, innocent childhood, manly virtue, and\nsweet and wholesome national life. But with a clever turn of the hand\nthis holy of holies can be exposed as an Augean stable, so filthy that\nit would seem more hopeful to burn it down than to attempt to sweep\nit out. And this latter view will perhaps prevail if the idolaters of\nmarriage persist in refusing all proposals for reform and treating those\nwho advocate it as infamous delinquents. Neither view is of any use\nexcept as a poisoned arrow in a fierce fight between two parties\ndetermined to discredit each other with a view to obtaining powers of\nlegal coercion over one another.\n\n\n\n\nSHELLEY AND QUEEN VICTORIA\n\nThe best way to avert such a struggle is to open the eyes of the\nthoughtlessly conventional people to the weakness of their position in a\nmere contest of recrimination. Hitherto they have assumed that they\nhave the advantage of coming into the field without a stain on their\ncharacters to combat libertines who have no character at all. They\nconceive it to be their duty to throw mud; and they feel that even if\nthe enemy can find any mud to throw, none of it will stick. They are\nmistaken. There will be plenty of that sort of ammunition in the other\ncamp; and most of it will stick very hard indeed. The moral is, do not\nthrow any. If we can imagine Shelley and Queen Victoria arguing out\ntheir differences in another world, we may be sure that the Queen has\nlong ago found that she cannot settle the question by classing Shelley\nwith George IV. as a bad man; and Shelley is not likely to have called\nher vile names on the general ground that as the economic dependence of\nwomen makes marriage a money bargain in which the man is the purchaser\nand the woman the purchased, there is no essential difference between\na married woman and the woman of the streets. Unfortunately, all the\npeople whose methods of controversy are represented by our popular\nnewspapers are not Queen Victorias and Shelleys. A great mass of them,\nwhen their prejudices are challenged, have no other impulse than to call\nthe challenger names, and, when the crowd seems to be on their side, to\nmaltreat him personally or hand him over to the law, if he is vulnerable\nto it. Therefore I cannot say that I have any certainty that the\nmarriage question will be dealt with decently and tolerantly. But dealt\nwith it will be, decently or indecently; for the present state of things\nin England is too strained and mischievous to last. Europe and America\nhave left us a century behind in this matter.\n\n\n\n\nA PROBABLE EFFECT OF GIVING WOMEN THE VOTE\n\nThe political emancipation of women is likely to lead to a comparatively\nstringent enforcement by law of sexual morality (that is why so many of\nus dread it); and this will soon compel us to consider what our sexual\nmorality shall be. At present a ridiculous distinction is made between\nvice and crime, in order that men may be vicious with impunity.\nAdultery, for instance, though it is sometimes fiercely punished by\ngiving an injured husband crushing damages in a divorce suit (injured\nwives are not considered in this way), is not now directly prosecuted;\nand this impunity extends to illicit relations between unmarried persons\nwho have reached what is called the age of consent. There are other\nmatters, such as notification of contagious disease and solicitation,\nin which the hand of the law has been brought down on one sex only.\nOutrages which were capital offences within the memory of persons still\nliving when committed on women outside marriage, can still be inflicted\nby men on their wives without legal remedy. At all such points the code\nwill be screwed up by the operation of Votes for Women, if there be any\nvirtue in the franchise at all. The result will be that men will find\nthe more ascetic side of our sexual morality taken seriously by the law.\nIt is easy to foresee the consequences. No man will take much trouble\nto alter laws which he can evade, or which are either not enforced or\nenforced on women only. But when these laws take him by the collar and\nthrust him into prison, he suddenly becomes keenly critical of them, and\nof the arguments by which they are supported. Now we have seen that our\nmarriage laws will not stand criticism, and that they have held out\nso far only because they are so worked as to fit roughly our state of\nsociety, in which women are neither politically nor personally free, in\nwhich indeed women are called womanly only when they regard themselves\nas existing solely for the use of men. When Liberalism enfranchises them\npolitically, and Socialism emancipates them economically, they will no\nlonger allow the law to take immorality so easily. Both men and women\nwill be forced to behave morally in sex matters; and when they find that\nthis is inevitable they will raise the question of what behavior really\nshould be established as moral. If they decide in favor of our present\nprofessed morality they will have to make a revolutionary change\nin their habits by becoming in fact what they only pretend to be\nat present. If, on the other hand, they find that this would be\nan unbearable tyranny, without even the excuse of justice or sound\neugenics, they will reconsider their morality and remodel the law.\n\n\n\n\nTHE PERSONAL SENTIMENTAL BASIS OF MONOGAMY\n\nMonogamy has a sentimental basis which is quite distinct from the\npolitical one of equal numbers of the sexes. Equal numbers in the sexes\nare quite compatible with a change of partners every day or every\nhour Physically there is nothing to distinguish human society from the\nfarm-yard except that children are more troublesome and costly than\nchickens and calves, and that men and women are not so completely\nenslaved as farm stock. Accordingly, the people whose conception of\nmarriage is a farm-yard or slave-quarter conception are always more\nor less in a panic lest the slightest relaxation of the marriage laws\nshould utterly demoralize society; whilst those to whom marriage is a\nmatter of more highly evolved sentiments and needs (sometimes said to\nbe distinctively human, though birds and animals in a state of freedom\nevince them quite as touchingly as we) are much more liberal, knowing as\nthey do that monogamy will take care of itself provided the parties are\nfree enough, and that promiscuity is a product of slavery and not of\nliberty.\n\nThe solid foundation of their confidence is the fact that the\nrelationship set up by a comfortable marriage is so intimate and so\npersuasive of the whole life of the parties to it, that nobody has room\nin his or her life for more than one such relationship at a time. What\nis called a household of three is never really of three except in the\nsense that every household becomes a household of three when a child is\nborn, and may in the same way become a household of four or fourteen\nif the union be fertile enough. Now no doubt the marriage tie means so\nlittle to some people that the addition to the household of half a dozen\nmore wives or husbands would be as possible as the addition of half a\ndozen governesses or tutors or visitors or servants. A Sultan may have\nfifty wives as easily as he may have fifty dishes on his table, because\nin the English sense he has no wives at all; nor have his wives any\nhusband: in short, he is not what we call a married man. And there are\nsultans and sultanas and seraglios existing in England under English\nforms. But when you come to the real modern marriage of sentiment, a\nrelation is created which has never to my knowledge been shared by three\npersons except when all three have been extraordinarily fond of one\nanother. Take for example the famous case of Nelson and Sir William and\nLady Hamilton. The secret of this household of three was not only that\nboth the husband and Nelson were devoted to Lady Hamilton, but that they\nwere also apparently devoted to one another. When Hamilton died both\nNelson and Emma seem to have been equally heartbroken. When there is a\nsuccessful household of one man and two women the same unusual condition\nis fulfilled: the two women not only cannot live happily without the man\nbut cannot live happily without each other. In every other case known\nto me, either from observation or record, the experiment is a hopeless\nfailure: one of the two rivals for the really intimate affection of the\nthird inevitably drives out the other. The driven-out party may accept\nthe situation and remain in the house as a friend to save appearances,\nor for the sake of the children, or for economic reasons; but such an\narrangement can subsist only when the forfeited relation is no longer\nreally valued; and this indifference, like the triple bond of affection\nwhich carried Sir William Hamilton through, is so rare as to be\npracticably negligible in the establishment of a conventional morality\nof marriage. Therefore sensible and experienced people always assume\nthat when a declaration of love is made to an already married person,\nthe declaration binds the parties in honor never to see one another\nagain unless they contemplate divorce and remarriage. And this is a\nsound convention, even for unconventional people. Let me illustrate by\nreference to a fictitious case: the one imagined in my own play Candida\nwill do as well as another. Here a young man who has been received as a\nfriend into the house of a clergyman falls in love with the clergyman's\nwife, and, being young and inexperienced, declares his feelings, and\nclaims that he, and not the clergyman, is the more suitable mate for\nthe lady. The clergyman, who has a temper, is first tempted to hurl the\nyouth into the street by bodily violence: an impulse natural, perhaps,\nbut vulgar and improper, and, not open, on consideration, to decent men.\nEven coarse and inconsiderate men are restrained from it by the fact\nthat the sympathy of the woman turns naturally to the victim of physical\nbrutality and against the bully, the Thackerayan notion to the contrary\nbeing one of the illusions of literary masculinity. Besides, the husband\nis not necessarily the stronger man: an appeal to force has resulted\nin the ignominious defeat of the husband quite as often as in poetic\njustice as conceived in the conventional novelet. What an honorable and\nsensible man does when his household is invaded is what the Reverend\nJames Mavor Morell does in my play. He recognizes that just as there is\nnot room for two women in that sacredly intimate relation of sentimental\ndomesticity which is what marriage means to him, so there is no room\nfor two men in that relation with his wife; and he accordingly tells\nher firmly that she must choose which man will occupy the place that is\nlarge enough for one only. He is so far shrewdly unconventional as to\nrecognize that if she chooses the other man, he must give way, legal tie\nor no legal tie; but he knows that either one or the other must go. And\na sensible wife would act in the same way. If a romantic young lady came\ninto her house and proposed to adore her husband on a tolerated footing,\nshe would say \"My husband has not room in his life for two wives: either\nyou go out of the house or I go out of it.\" The situation is not at\nall unlikely: I had almost said not at all unusual. Young ladies and\ngentlemen in the greensickly condition which is called calf-love,\nassociating with married couples at dangerous periods of mature life,\nquite often find themselves in it; and the extreme reluctance of proud\nand sensitive people to avoid any assertion of matrimonial rights, or to\ncondescend to jealousy, sometimes makes the threatened husband or wife\nhesitate to take prompt steps and do the apparently conventional thing.\nBut whether they hesitate or act the result is always the same. In a\nreal marriage of sentiment the wife or husband cannot be supplanted by\nhalves; and such a marriage will break very soon under the strain of\npolygyny or polyandry. What we want at present is a sufficiently clear\nteaching of this fact to ensure that prompt and decisive action shall\nalways be taken in such cases without any false shame of seeming\nconventional (a shame to which people capable of such real marriage\nare specially susceptible), and a rational divorce law to enable\nthe marriage to be dissolved and the parties honorably resorted and\nrecoupled without disgrace and scandal if that should prove the proper\nsolution.\n\nIt must be repeated here that no law, however stringent, can prevent\npolygamy among groups of people who choose to live loosely and be\nmonogamous only in appearance. But such cases are not now under\nconsideration. Also, affectionate husbands like Samuel Pepys, and\naffectionate wives of the corresponding temperaments may, it appears,\nengage in transient casual adventures out of doors without breaking\nup their home life. But within doors that home life may be regarded as\nnaturally monogamous. It does not need to be protected against polygamy:\nit protects itself.\n\n\n\n\nDIVORCE\n\nAll this has an important bearing on the question of divorce. Divorce\nreformers are so much preoccupied with the injustice of forbidding a\nwoman to divorce her husband for unfaithfulness to his marriage vow,\nwhilst allowing him that power over her, that they are apt to overlook\nthe pressing need for admitting other and far more important grounds for\ndivorce. If we take a document like Pepys' Diary, we learn that a woman\nmay have an incorrigibly unfaithful husband, and yet be much better off\nthan if she had an ill-tempered, peevish, maliciously sarcastic one,\nor was chained for life to a criminal, a drunkard, a lunatic, an idle\nvagrant, or a person whose religious faith was contrary to her own.\nImagine being married to a liar, a borrower, a mischief maker, a teaser\nor tormentor of children and animals, or even simply to a bore! Conceive\nyourself tied for life to one of the perfectly \"faithful\" husbands who\nare sentenced to a month's imprisonment occasionally for idly leaving\ntheir wives in childbirth without food, fire, or attendance! What woman\nwould not rather marry ten Pepyses? what man a dozen Nell Gwynnes?\nAdultery, far from being the first and only ground for divorce, might\nmore reasonably be made the last, or wholly excluded. The present law is\nperfectly logical only if you once admit (as no decent person ever does)\nits fundamental assumption that there can be no companionship between\nmen and women because the woman has a \"sphere\" of her own, that of\nhousekeeping, in which the man must not meddle, whilst he has all the\nrest of human activity for his sphere: the only point at which the\ntwo spheres touch being that of replenishing the population. On this\nassumption the man naturally asks for a guarantee that the children\nshall be his because he has to find the money to support them. The power\nof divorcing a woman for adultery is this guarantee, a guarantee that\nshe does not need to protect her against a similar imposture on his\npart, because he cannot bear children. No doubt he can spend the\nmoney that ought to be spent on her children on another woman and her\nchildren; but this is desertion, which is a separate matter. The\nfact for us to seize is that in the eye of the law, adultery without\nconsequences is merely a sentimental grievance, whereas the planting\non one man of another man's offspring is a substantial one. And so, no\ndoubt, it is; but the day has gone by for basing laws on the assumption\nthat a woman is less to a man than his dog, and thereby encouraging and\naccepting the standards of the husbands who buy meat for their bull-pups\nand leave their wives and children hungry. That basis is the penalty we\npay for having borrowed our religion from the East, instead of building\nup a religion of our own out of our western inspiration and western\nsentiment. The result is that we all believe that our religion is on its\nlast legs, whereas the truth is that it is not yet born, though the age\nwalks visibly pregnant with it. Meanwhile, as women are dragged down by\ntheir oriental servitude to our men, and as, further, women drag down\nthose who degrade them quite as effectually as men do, there are moments\nwhen it is difficult to see anything in our sex institutions except a\npolice des moeurs keeping the field for a competition as to which sex\nshall corrupt the other most.\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANCE OF SENTIMENTAL GRIEVANCE\n\nAny tolerable western divorce law must put the sentimental grievances\nfirst, and should carefully avoid singling out any ground of divorce in\nsuch a way as to create a convention that persons having that ground are\nbound in honor to avail themselves of it. It is generally admitted that\npeople should not be encouraged to petition for a divorce in a fit of\npetulance. What is not so clearly seen is that neither should they be\nencouraged to petition in a fit of jealousy, which is certainly the most\ndetestable and mischievous of all the passions that enjoy public credit.\nStill less should people who are not jealous be urged to behave as if\nthey were jealous, and to enter upon duels and divorce suits in which\nthey have no desire to be successful. There should be no publication of\nthe grounds on which a divorce is sought or granted; and as this would\nabolish the only means the public now has of ascertaining that every\npossible effort has been made to keep the couple united against their\nwills, such privacy will only be tolerated when we at last admit that\nthe sole and sufficient reason why people should be granted a divorce is\nthat they want one. Then there will be no more reports of divorce\ncases, no more letters read in court with an indelicacy that makes\nevery sensitive person shudder and recoil as from a profanation, no more\nwashing of household linen, dirty or clean, in public. We must learn\nin these matters to mind our own business and not impose our individual\nnotions of propriety on one another, even if it carries us to the length\nof openly admitting what we are now compelled to assume silently, that\nevery human being has a right to sexual experience, and that the law is\nconcerned only with parentage, which is now a separate matter.\n\n\n\n\nDIVORCE WITHOUT ASKING WHY\n\nThe one question that should never be put to a petitioner for divorce\nis \"Why?\" When a man appeals to a magistrate for protection from someone\nwho threatens to kill him, on the simple ground that he desires to live,\nthe magistrate might quite reasonably ask him why he desires to live,\nand why the person who wishes to kill him should not be gratified. Also\nwhether he can prove that his life is a pleasure to himself or a benefit\nto anyone else, and whether it is good for him to be encouraged to\nexaggerate the importance of his short span in this vale of tears rather\nthan to keep himself constantly ready to meet his God.\n\nThe only reason for not raising these very weighty points is that we\nfind society unworkable except on the assumption that every man has a\nnatural right to live. Nothing short of his own refusal to respect that\nright in others can reconcile the community to killing him. From this\nfundamental right many others are derived. The American Constitution,\none of the few modern political documents drawn up by men who were\nforced by the sternest circumstances to think out what they really had\nto face instead of chopping logic in a university classroom, specifies\n\"liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" as natural rights. The terms are\ntoo vague to be of much practical use; for the supreme right to life,\nextended as it now must be to the life of the race, and to the quality\nof life as well as to the mere fact of breathing, is making short work\nof many ancient liberties, and exposing the pursuit of happiness as\nperhaps the most miserable of human occupations. Nevertheless, the\nAmerican Constitution roughly expresses the conditions to which modern\ndemocracy commits us. To impose marriage on two unmarried people who\ndo not desire to marry one another would be admittedly an act of\nenslavement. But it is no worse than to impose a continuation of\nmarriage on people who have ceased to desire to be married. It will\nbe said that the parties may not agree on that; that one may desire\nto maintain the marriage the other wishes to dissolve. But the same\nhardship arises whenever a man in love proposes marriage to a woman and\nis refused. The refusal is so painful to him that he often threatens to\nkill himself and sometimes even does it. Yet we expect him to face his\nill luck, and never dream of forcing the woman to accept him. His case\nis the same as that of the husband whose wife tells him she no longer\ncares for him, and desires the marriage to be dissolved. You will\nsay, perhaps, if you are superstitious, that it is not the same--that\nmarriage makes a difference. You are wrong: there is no magic in\nmarriage. If there were, married couples would never desire to separate.\nBut they do. And when they do, it is simple slavery to compel them to\nremain together.\n\n\n\n\nECONOMIC SLAVERY AGAIN THE ROOT DIFFICULTY\n\nThe husband, then, is to be allowed to discard his wife when he is tired\nof her, and the wife the husband when another man strikes her fancy?\nOne must reply unhesitatingly in the affirmative; for if we are to\ndeny every proposition that can be stated in offensive terms by its\nopponents, we shall never be able to affirm anything at all. But the\nquestion reminds us that until the economic independence of women is\nachieved, we shall have to remain impaled on the other horn of the\ndilemma and maintain marriage as a slavery. And here let me ask the\nGovernment of the day (1910) a question with regard to the Labor\nExchanges it has very wisely established throughout the country. What do\nthese Exchanges do when a woman enters and states that her occupation is\nthat of a wife and mother; that she is out of a job; and that she wants\nan employer? If the Exchanges refuse to entertain her application, they\nare clearly excluding nearly the whole female sex from the benefit of\nthe Act. If not, they must become matrimonial agencies, unless, indeed,\nthey are prepared to become something worse by putting the woman down as\na housekeeper and introducing her to an employer without making marriage\na condition of the hiring.\n\n\n\n\nLABOR EXCHANGES AND THE WHITE SLAVERY\n\nSuppose, again, a woman presents herself at the Labor Exchange, and\nstates her trade as that of a White Slave, meaning the unmentionable\ntrade pursued by many thousands of women in all civilized cities. Will\nthe Labor Exchange find employers for her? If not, what will it do with\nher? If it throws her back destitute and unhelped on the streets to\nstarve, it might as well not exist as far as she is concerned; and the\nproblem of unemployment remains unsolved at its most painful point. Yet\nif it finds honest employment for her and for all the unemployed wives\nand mothers, it must find new places in the world for women; and in so\ndoing it must achieve for them economic independence of men. And when\nthis is done, can we feel sure that any woman will consent to be a wife\nand mother (not to mention the less respectable alternative) unless her\nposition is made as eligible as that of the women for whom the Labor\nExchanges are finding independent work? Will not many women now engaged\nin domestic work under circumstances which make it repugnant to them,\nabandon it and seek employment under other circumstances? As unhappiness\nin marriage is almost the only discomfort sufficiently irksome to\ninduce a woman to break up her home, and economic dependence the\nonly compulsion sufficiently stringent to force her to endure such\nunhappiness, the solution of the problem of finding independent\nemployment for women may cause a great number of childless unhappy\nmarriages to break up spontaneously, whether the marriage laws are\naltered or not. And here we must extend the term childless marriages to\ncover households in which the children have grown up and gone their own\nway, leaving the parents alone together: a point at which many worthy\ncouples discover for the first time that they have long since lost\ninterest in one another, and have been united only by a common interest\nin their children. We may expect, then, that marriages which are\nmaintained by economic pressure alone will dissolve when that pressure\nis removed; and as all the parties to them will certainly not accept a\ncelibate life, the law must sanction the dissolution in order to prevent\na recurrence of the scandal which has moved the Government to appoint\nthe Commission now sitting to investigate the marriage question: the\nscandal, that is, of a great number matter of the evils of our\nmarriage law, to take care of the pence and let the pounds take care of\nthemselves. The crimes and diseases of marriage will force themselves\non public attention by their own virulence. I mention them here only\nbecause they reveal certain habits of thought and feeling with regard to\nmarriage of which we must rid ourselves if we are to act sensibly when\nwe take the necessary reforms in hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHRISTIAN MARRIAGE\n\nFirst among these is the habit of allowing ourselves to be bound not\nonly by the truths of the Christian religion but by the excesses and\nextravagances which the Christian movement acquired in its earlier days\nas a violent reaction against what it still calls paganism. By far the\nmost dangerous of these, because it is a blasphemy against life, and,\nto put it in Christian terms, an accusation of indecency against God, is\nthe notion that sex, with all its operations, is in itself absolutely\nan obscene thing, and that an immaculate conception is a miracle.\nSo unwholesome an absurdity could only have gained ground under two\nconditions: one, a reaction against a society in which sensual luxury\nhad been carried to revolting extremes, and, two, a belief that the\nworld was coming to an end, and that therefore sex was no longer a\nnecessity. Christianity, because it began under these conditions,\nmade sexlessness and Communism the two main practical articles of its\npropaganda; and it has never quite lost its original bias in these\ndirections. In spite of the putting off of the Second Coming from\nthe lifetime of the apostles to the millennium, and of the great\ndisappointment of the year 1000 A.D., in which multitudes of Christians\nseriously prepared for the end of the world, the prophet who announces\nthat the end is at hand is still popular. Many of the people who\nridicule his demonstrations that the fantastic monsters of the book\nof Revelation are among us in the persons of our own political\ncontemporaries, and who proceed sanely in all their affairs on the\nassumption that the world is going to last, really do believe that there\nwill be a Judgment Day, and that it MIGHT even be in their own time.\nA thunderstorm, an eclipse, or any very unusual weather will make them\napprehensive and uncomfortable.\n\nThis explains why, for a long time, the Christian Church refused to have\nanything to do with marriage. The result was, not the abolition of sex,\nbut its excommunication. And, of course, the consequences of persuading\npeople that matrimony was an unholy state were so grossly carnal, that\nthe Church had to execute a complete right-about-face, and try to make\npeople understand that it was a holy state: so holy indeed that it could\nnot be validly inaugurated without the blessing of the Church. And by\nthis teaching it did something to atone for its earlier blasphemy. But\nthe mischief of chopping and changing your doctrine to meet this or that\npractical emergency instead of keeping it adjusted to the whole scheme\nof life, is that you end by having half-a-dozen contradictory doctrines\nto suit half-a-dozen different emergencies. The Church solemnized and\nsanctified marriage without ever giving up its original Pauline doctrine\non the subject. And it soon fell into another confusion. At the point at\nwhich it took up marriage and endeavored to make it holy, marriage was,\nas it still is, largely a survival of the custom of selling women to\nmen. Now in all trades a marked difference is made in price between\na new article and a second-hand one. The moment we meet with this\ndifference in value between human beings, we may know that we are in the\nslave-market, where the conception of our relations to the persons sold\nis neither religious nor natural nor human nor superhuman, but simply\ncommercial. The Church, when it finally gave its blessing to marriage,\ndid not, in its innocence, fathom these commercial traditions.\nConsequently it tried to sanctify them too, with grotesque results. The\nslave-dealer having always asked more money for virginity, the Church,\ninstead of detecting the money-changer and driving him out of the\ntemple, took him for a sentimental and chivalrous lover, and, helped by\nits only half-discarded doctrine of celibacy, gave virginity a heavenly\nvalue to ennoble its commercial pretensions. In short, Mammon, always\nmighty, put the Church in his pocket, where he keeps it to this day,\nin spite of the occasional saints and martyrs who contrive from time to\ntime to get their heads and souls free to testify against him.\n\n\n\n\nDIVORCE A SACRAMENTAL DUTY\n\nBut Mammon overreached himself when he tried to impose his doctrine\nof inalienable property on the Church under the guise of indissoluble\nmarriage. For the Church tried to shelter this inhuman doctrine and\nflat contradiction of the gospel by claiming, and rightly claiming,\nthat marriage is a sacrament. So it is; but that is exactly what makes\ndivorce a duty when the marriage has lost the inward and spiritual grace\nof which the marriage ceremony is the outward and visible sign. In vain\ndo bishops stoop to pick up the discarded arguments of the atheists of\nfifty years ago by pleading that the words of Jesus were in an obscure\nAramaic dialect, and were probably misunderstood, as Jesus, they think,\ncould not have said anything a bishop would disapprove of. Unless they\nare prepared to add that the statement that those who take the sacrament\nwith their lips but not with their hearts eat and drink their own\ndamnation is also a mistranslation from the Aramaic, they are most\nsolemnly bound to shield marriage from profanation, not merely by\npermitting divorce, but by making it compulsory in certain cases as the\nChinese do.\n\nWhen the great protest of the XVI century came, and the Church was\nreformed in several countries, the Reformation was so largely\na rebellion against sacerdotalism that marriage was very nearly\nexcommunicated again: our modern civil marriage, round which so many\nfierce controversies and political conflicts have raged, would have been\nthoroughly approved of by Calvin, and hailed with relief by Luther. But\nthe instinctive doctrine that there is something holy and mystic in\nsex, a doctrine which many of us now easily dissociate from any priestly\nceremony, but which in those days seemed to all who felt it to need a\nritual affirmation, could not be thrown on the scrap-heap with the sale\nof Indulgences and the like; and so the Reformation left marriage where\nit was: a curious mixture of commercial sex slavery, early Christian sex\nabhorrence, and later Christian sex sanctification.\n\n\n\n\nOTHELLO AND DESDEMONA\n\nHow strong was the feeling that a husband or a wife is an article of\nproperty, greatly depreciated in value at second-hand, and not to be\nused or touched by any person but the proprietor, may be learnt from\nShakespear. His most infatuated and passionate lovers are Antony and\nOthello; yet both of them betray the commercial and proprietary\ninstinct the moment they lose their tempers. \"I found you,\" says Antony,\nreproaching Cleopatra, \"as a morsel cold upon dead Caesar's trencher.\"\nOthello's worst agony is the thought of \"keeping a corner in the thing\nhe loves for others' uses.\" But this is not what a man feels about the\nthing he loves, but about the thing he owns. I never understood the full\nsignificance of Othello's outburst until I one day heard a lady, in\nthe course of a private discussion as to the feasibility of \"group\nmarriage,\" say with cold disgust that she would as soon think of lending\nher toothbrush to another woman as her husband. The sense of outraged\nmanhood with which I felt myself and all other husbands thus reduced to\nthe rank of a toilet appliance gave me a very unpleasant taste of what\nDesdemona might have felt had she overheard Othello's outburst. I was so\ndumfounded that I had not the presence of mind to ask the lady whether\nshe insisted on having a doctor, a nurse, a dentist, and even a priest\nand solicitor all to herself as well. But I had too often heard men\nspeak of women as if they were mere personal conveniences to feel\nsurprised that exactly the same view is held, only more fastidiously, by\nwomen.\n\nAll these views must be got rid of before we can have any healthy\npublic opinion (on which depends our having a healthy population) on\nthe subject of sex, and consequently of marriage. Whilst the subject is\nconsidered shameful and sinful we shall have no systematic instruction\nin sexual hygiene, because such lectures as are given in Germany,\nFrance, and even prudish America (where the great Miltonic tradition\nin this matter still lives) will be considered a corruption of that\nyouthful innocence which now subsists on nasty stories and whispered\ntraditions handed down from generation to generation of school-children:\nstories and traditions which conceal nothing of sex but its dignity, its\nhonor, its sacredness, its rank as the first necessity of society and\nthe deepest concern of the nation. We shall continue to maintain the\nWhite Slave Trade and protect its exploiters by, on the one hand,\ntolerating the white slave as the necessary breakwater of marriage; and,\non the other, trampling on her and degrading her until she has nothing\nto hope from our Courts; and so, with policemen at every corner, and law\ntriumphant all over Europe, she will still be smuggled and cattle-driven\nfrom one end of the civilized world to the other, cheated, beaten,\nbullied, and hunted into the streets to disgusting overwork, without\ndaring to utter the cry for help that brings, not rescue, but exposure\nand infamy, yet revenging herself terribly in the end by scattering\nblindness and sterility, pain and disfigurement, insanity and death\namong us with the certainty that we are much too pious and genteel to\nallow such things to be mentioned with a view to saving either her or\nourselves from them. And all the time we shall keep enthusiastically\ninvesting her trade with every allurement that the art of the novelist,\nthe playwright, the dancer, the milliner, the painter, the limelight\nman, and the sentimental poet can devize, after which we shall continue\nto be very much shocked and surprised when the cry of the youth, of the\nyoung wife, of the mother, of the infected nurse, and of all the other\nvictims, direct and indirect, arises with its invariable refrain: \"Why\ndid nobody warn me?\"\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS TO BECOME OF THE CHILDREN?\n\nI must not reply flippantly, Make them all Wards in Chancery; yet that\nwould be enough to put any sensible person on the track of the reply.\nOne would think, to hear the way in which people sometimes ask the\nquestion, that not only does marriage prevent the difficulty from ever\narising, but that nothing except divorce can ever raise it. It is true\nthat if you divorce the parents, the children have to be disposed\nof. But if you hang the parents, or imprison the parents, or take the\nchildren out of the custody of the parents because they hold Shelley's\nopinions, or if the parents die, the same difficulty arises. And as\nthese things have happened again and again, and as we have had plenty of\nexperience of divorce decrees and separation orders, the attempt to\nuse children as an obstacle to divorce is hardly worth arguing with. We\nshall deal with the children just as we should deal with them if their\nhomes were broken up by any other cause. There is a sense in which\nchildren are a real obstacle to divorce: they give parents a common\ninterest which keeps together many a couple who, if childless, would\nseparate. The marriage law is superfluous in such cases. This is shewn\nby the fact that the proportion of childless divorces is much larger\nthan the proportion of divorces from all causes. But it must not be\nforgotten that the interest of the children forms one of the most\npowerful arguments for divorce. An unhappy household is a bad nursery.\nThere is something to be said for the polygynous or polyandrous\nhousehold as a school for children: children really do suffer from\nhaving too few parents: this is why uncles and aunts and tutors\nand governesses are often so good for children. But it is just the\npolygamous household which our marriage law allows to be broken up, and\nwhich, as we have seen, is not possible as a typical institution in\na democratic country where the numbers of the sexes are about equal.\nTherefore polygyny and polyandry as a means of educating children fall\nto the ground, and with them, I think, must go the opinion which has\nbeen expressed by Gladstone and others, that an extension of divorce,\nwhilst admitting many new grounds for it, might exclude the ground of\nadultery. There are, however, clearly many things that make some of our\ndomestic interiors little private hells for children (especially\nwhen the children are quite content in them) which would justify any\nintelligent State in breaking up the home and giving the custody of the\nchildren either to the parent whose conscience had revolted against the\ncorruption of the children, or to neither.\n\nWhich brings me to the point that divorce should no longer be confined\nto cases in which one of the parties petitions for it. If, for instance,\nyou have a thoroughly rascally couple making a living by infamous means\nand bringing up their children to their trade, the king's proctor,\ninstead of pursuing his present purely mischievous function of\npreventing couples from being divorced by proving that they both desire\nit, might very well intervene and divorce these children from\ntheir parents. At present, if the Queen herself were to rescue some\nunfortunate child from degradation and misery and place her in a\nrespectable home, and some unmentionable pair of blackguards claimed the\nchild and proved that they were its father and mother, the child\nwould be given to them in the name of the sanctity of the home and the\nholiness of parentage, after perpetrating which crime the law would\ncalmly send an education officer to take the child out of the parents'\nhands several hours a day in the still more sacred name of compulsory\neducation. (Of course what would really happen would be that the couple\nwould blackmail the Queen for their consent to the salvation of the\nchild, unless, indeed, a hint from a police inspector convinced them\nthat bad characters cannot always rely on pedantically constitutional\ntreatment when they come into conflict with persons in high station).\n\nThe truth is, not only must the bond between man and wife be made\nsubject to a reasonable consideration of the welfare of the parties\nconcerned and of the community, but the whole family bond as well. The\ntheory that the wife is the property of the husband or the husband of\nthe wife is not a whit less abhorrent and mischievous than the theory\nthat the child is the property of the parent. Parental bondage will go\nthe way of conjugal bondage: indeed the order of reform should rather\nbe put the other way about; for the helplessness of children has already\ncompelled the State to intervene between parent and child more than\nbetween husband and wife. If you pay less than 40 pounds a year rent,\nyou will sometimes feel tempted to say to the vaccination officer, the\nschool attendance officer, and the sanitary inspector: \"Is this child\nmine or yours?\" The answer is that as the child is a vital part of\nthe nation, the nation cannot afford to leave it at the irresponsible\ndisposal of any individual or couple of individuals as a mere small\nparcel of private property. The only solid ground that the parent can\ntake is that as the State, in spite of its imposing name, can, when all\nis said, do nothing with the child except place it in the charge of\nsome human being or another, the parent is no worse a custodian than a\nstranger. And though this proposition may seem highly questionable at\nfirst sight to those who imagine that only parents spoil children, yet\nthose who realize that children are as often spoilt by severity and\ncoldness as by indulgence, and that the notion that natural parents are\nany worse than adopted parents is probably as complete an illusion as\nthe notion that they are any better, see no serious likelihood that\nState action will detach children from their parents more than it does\nat present: nay, it is even likely that the present system of taking\nthe children out of the parents' hands and having the parental duty\nperformed by officials, will, as poverty and ignorance become the\nexception instead of the rule, give way to the system of simply\nrequiring certain results, beginning with the baby's weight and ending\nperhaps with some sort of practical arts degree, but leaving parents and\nchildren to achieve the results as they best may. Such freedom is, of\ncourse, impossible in our present poverty-stricken circumstances. As\nlong as the masses of our people are too poor to be good parents or good\nanything else except beasts of burden, it is no use requiring much more\nfrom them but hewing of wood and drawing of water: whatever is to be\ndone must be done FOR them mostly, alas! by people whose superiority\nis merely technical. Until we abolish poverty it is impossible to push\nrational measures of any kind very far: the wolf at the door will compel\nus to live in a state of siege and to do everything by a bureaucratic\nmartial law that would be quite unnecessary and indeed intolerable in a\nprosperous community. But however we settle the question, we must make\nthe parent justify his custody of the child exactly as we should make\na stranger justify it. If a family is not achieving the purposes of a\nfamily it should be dissolved just as a marriage should when it, too, is\nnot achieving the purposes of marriage. The notion that there is or\never can be anything magical and inviolable in the legal relations of\ndomesticity, and the curious confusion of ideas which makes some of our\nbishops imagine that in the phrase \"Whom God hath joined,\" the word\nGod means the district registrar or the Reverend John Smith or William\nJones, must be got rid of. Means of breaking up undesirable families are\nas necessary to the preservation of the family as means of dissolving\nundesirable marriages are to the preservation of marriage. If our\ndomestic laws are kept so inhuman that they at last provoke a furious\ngeneral insurrection against them as they already provoke many private\nones, we shall in a very literal sense empty the baby out with the bath\nby abolishing an institution which needs nothing more than a little\nobvious and easy rationalizing to make it not only harmless but\ncomfortable, honorable, and useful.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COST OF DIVORCE\n\nBut please do not imagine that the evils of indissoluble marriage can\nbe cured by divorce laws administered on our present plan. The very\ncheapest undefended divorce, even when conducted by a solicitor for its\nown sake and that of humanity, costs at least 30 pounds out-of-pocket\nexpenses. To a client on business terms it costs about three times\nas much. Until divorce is as cheap as marriage, marriage will remain\nindissoluble for all except the handful of people to whom 100 pounds is\na procurable sum. For the enormous majority of us there is no difference\nin this respect between a hundred and a quadrillion. Divorce is the one\nthing you may not sue for in forma pauperis.\n\nLet me, then, recommend as follows:\n\n1. Make divorce as easy, as cheap, and as private as marriage.\n\n2. Grant divorce at the request of either party, whether the other\nconsents or not; and admit no other ground than the request, which\nshould be made without stating any reasons.\n\n3. Confine the power of dissolving marriage for misconduct to the\nState acting on the petition of the king's proctor or other suitable\nfunctionary, who may, however, be moved by either party to intervene in\nordinary request cases, not to prevent the divorce taking place, but to\nenforce alimony if it be refused and the case is one which needs it.\n\n4. Make it impossible for marriage to be used as a punishment as it\nis at present. Send the husband and wife to penal servitude if you\ndisapprove of their conduct and want to punish them; but do not send\nthem back to perpetual wedlock.\n\n5. If, on the other hand, you think a couple perfectly innocent and well\nconducted, do not condemn them also to perpetual wedlock against their\nwills, thereby making the treatment of what you consider innocence on\nboth sides the same as the treatment of what you consider guilt on both\nsides.\n\n6. Place the work of a wife and mother on the same footing as other\nwork: that is, on the footing of labor worthy of its hire; and provide\nfor unemployment in it exactly as for unemployment in shipbuilding or an\nother recognized bread-winning trade.\n\n7. And take and deal with all the consequences of these acts of justice\ninstead of letting yourself be frightened out of reason and good sense\nby fear of consequences. We must finally adapt our institutions to human\nnature. In the long run our present plan of trying to force human nature\ninto a mould of existing abuses, superstitions, and corrupt interests,\nproduces the explosive forces that wreck civilization.\n\n8. Never forget that if you leave your law to judges and your religion\nto bishops, you will presently find yourself without either law or\nreligion. If you doubt this, ask any decent judge or bishop. Do NOT ask\nsomebody who does not know what a judge is, or what a bishop is, or\nwhat the law is, or what religion is. In other words, do not ask your\nnewspaper. Journalists are too poorly paid in this country to know\nanything that is fit for publication.\n\n\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nTo sum up, we have to depend on the solution of the problem of\nunemployment, probably on the principles laid down in the Minority\nReport of the Royal Commission on the Poor Law, to make the sexual\nrelations between men and women decent and honorable by making women\neconomically independent of men, and (in the younger son section of the\nupper classes) men economically independent of women. We also have to\nbring ourselves into line with the rest of Protestant civilization by\nproviding means for dissolving all unhappy, improper, and inconvenient\nmarriages. And, as it is our cautious custom to lag behind the rest\nof the world to see how their experiments in reform turn out before\nventuring ourselves, and then take advantage of their experience to get\nahead of them, we should recognize that the ancient system of specifying\ngrounds for divorce, such as adultery, cruelty, drunkenness, felony,\ninsanity, vagrancy, neglect to provide for wife and children, desertion,\npublic defamation, violent temper, religious heterodoxy, contagious\ndisease, outrages, indignities, personal abuse, \"mental anguish,\"\nconduct rendering life burdensome and so forth (all these are examples\nfrom some code actually in force at present), is a mistake, because the\nonly effect of compelling people to plead and prove misconduct is that\ncases are manufactured and clean linen purposely smirched and washed\nin public, to the great distress and disgrace of innocent children\nand relatives, whilst the grounds have at the same time to be made so\ngeneral that any sort of human conduct may be brought within them by a\nlittle special pleading and a little mental reservation on the part of\nwitnesses examined on oath. When it conies to \"conduct rendering life\nburdensome,\" it is clear that no marriage is any longer indissoluble;\nand the sensible thing to do then is to grant divorce whenever it is\ndesired, without asking why.\n\n\n\n\nGETTING MARRIED\n\nBy Bernard Shaw\n\n1908\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nN.B.--There is a point of some technical interest to be noted in this\nplay. The customary division into acts and scenes has been disused, and\na return made to unity of time and place, as observed in the ancient\nGreek drama. In the foregoing tragedy, The Doctor's Dilemma, there are\nfive acts; the place is altered five times; and the time is spread over\nan undetermined period of more than a year. No doubt the strain on the\nattention of the audience and on the ingenuity of the playwright is\nmuch less; but I find in practice that the Greek form is inevitable when\ndrama reaches a certain point in poetic and intellectual evolution.\nIts adoption was not, on my part, a deliberate display of virtuosity\nin form, but simply the spontaneous falling of a play of ideas into the\nform most suitable to it, which turned out to be the classical form.\nGetting Married, in several acts and scenes, with the time spread over a\nlong period, would be impossible.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\n\nOn a fine morning in the spring of 1908 the Norman kitchen in the Palace\nof the Bishop of Chelsea looks very spacious and clean and handsome and\nhealthy.\n\nThe Bishop is lucky enough to have a XII century palace. The palace\nitself has been lucky enough to escape being carved up into XV century\nGothic, or shaved into XVIII century ashlar, or \"restored\" by a XIX\ncentury builder and a Victorian architect with a deep sense of the\numbrella-like gentlemanliness of XIV century vaulting. The present\noccupant, A. Chelsea, unofficially Alfred Bridgenorth, appreciates\nNorman work. He has, by adroit complaints of the discomfort of the\nplace, induced the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to give him some money\nto spend on it; and with this he has got rid of the wall papers, the\npaint, the partitions, the exquisitely planed and moulded casings with\nwhich the Victorian cabinetmakers enclosed and hid the huge black beams\nof hewn oak, and of all other expedients of his predecessors to make\nthemselves feel at home and respectable in a Norman fortress. It is\na house built to last for ever. The walls and beams are big enough to\ncarry the tower of Babel, as if the builders, anticipating our modern\nideas and instinctively defying them, had resolved to show how much\nmaterial they could lavish on a house built for the glory of God,\ninstead of keeping a competitive eye on the advantage of sending in the\nlowest tender, and scientifically calculating how little material would\nbe enough to prevent the whole affair from tumbling down by its own\nweight.\n\nThe kitchen is the Bishop's favorite room. This is not at all because\nhe is a man of humble mind; but because the kitchen is one of the finest\nrooms in the house. The Bishop has neither the income nor the appetite\nto have his cooking done there. The windows, high up in the wall, look\nnorth and south. The north window is the largest; and if we look into\nthe kitchen through it we see facing us the south wall with small Norman\nwindows and an open door near the corner to the left. Through this door\nwe have a glimpse of the garden, and of a garden chair in the sunshine.\nIn the right-hand corner is an entrance to a vaulted circular chamber\nwith a winding stair leading up through a tower to the upper floors of\nthe palace. In the wall to our right is the immense fireplace, with\nits huge spit like a baby crane, and a collection of old iron and brass\ninstruments which pass as the original furniture of the fire, though\nas a matter of fact they have been picked up from time to time by the\nBishop at secondhand shops. In the near end of the left hand wall\na small Norman door gives access to the Bishop's study, formerly a\nscullery. Further along, a great oak chest stands against the wall.\nAcross the middle of the kitchen is a big timber table surrounded by\neleven stout rush-bottomed chairs: four on the far side, three on the\nnear side, and two at each end. There is a big chair with railed back\nand sides on the hearth. On the floor is a drugget of thick fibre\nmatting. The only other piece of furniture is a clock with a wooden\ndial about as large as the bottom of a washtub, the weights, chains, and\npendulum being of corresponding magnitude; but the Bishop has long since\nabandoned the attempt to keep it going. It hangs above the oak chest.\n\nThe kitchen is occupied at present by the Bishop's lady, Mrs\nBridgenorth, who is talking to Mr William Collins, the greengrocer. He\nis in evening dress, though it is early forenoon. Mrs Bridgenorth is a\nquiet happy-looking woman of fifty or thereabouts, placid, gentle, and\nhumorous, with delicate features and fine grey hair with many white\nthreads. She is dressed as for some festivity; but she is taking things\neasily as she sits in the big chair by the hearth, reading The Times.\n\nCollins is an elderly man with a rather youthful waist. His muttonchop\nwhiskers have a coquettish touch of Dundreary at their lower ends. He is\nan affable man, with those perfect manners which can be acquired only\nin keeping a shop for the sale of necessaries of life to ladies whose\nsocial position is so unquestionable that they are not anxious about\nit. He is a reassuring man, with a vigilant grey eye, and the power of\nsaying anything he likes to you without offence, because his tone always\nimplies that he does it with your kind permission. Withal by no\nmeans servile: rather gallant and compassionate, but never without a\nconscientious recognition, on public grounds, of social distinctions. He\nis at the oak chest counting a pile of napkins.\n\nMrs Bridgenorth reads placidly: Collins counts: a blackbird sings in\nthe garden. Mrs Bridgenorth puts The Times down in her lap and considers\nCollins for a moment.\n\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Do you never feel nervous on these occasions,\n  Collins?\n\n  COLLINS. Lord bless you, no, maam. It would be a joke, after\n  marrying five of your daughters, if I was to get nervous over\n  marrying the last of them.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. I have always said you were a wonderful man,\n  Collins.\n\n  COLLINS [almost blushing] Oh, maam!\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Yes. I never could arrange anything--a wedding\n  or even dinner--without some hitch or other.\n\n  COLLINS. Why should you give yourself the trouble, maam? Send for\n  the greengrocer, maam: thats the secret of easy housekeeping.\n  Bless you, it's his business. It pays him and you, let alone the\n  pleasure in a house like this [Mrs Bridgenorth bows in\n  acknowledgment of the compliment]. They joke about the\n  greengrocer, just as they joke about the mother-in-law. But they\n  cant get on without both.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. What a bond between us, Collins!\n\n  COLLINS. Bless you, maam, theres all sorts of bonds between all\n  sorts of people. You are a very affable lady, maam, for a\n  Bishop's lady. I have known Bishop's ladies that would fairly\n  provoke you to up and cheek them; but nobody would ever forget\n  himself and his place with you, maam.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Collins: you are a flatterer. You will\n  superintend the breakfast yourself as usual, of course, wont you?\n\n  COLLINS. Yes, yes, bless you, maam, of course. I always do. Them\n  fashionable caterers send down such people as I never did set\n  eyes on. Dukes you would take them for. You see the relatives\n  shaking hands with them and asking them about the family--\n  actually ladies saying \"Where have we met before?\" and all sorts\n  of confusion. Thats my secret in business, maam. You can always\n  spot me as the greengrocer. It's a fortune to me in these days,\n  when you cant hardly tell who any one is or isnt. [He goes out\n  through the tower, and immediately returns for a moment to\n  announce] The General, maam.\n\n  Mrs Bridgenorth rises to receive her brother-in-law, who enters\n  resplendent in full-dress uniform, with many medals and orders.\n  General Bridgenorth is a well set up man of fifty, with large\n  brave nostrils, an iron mouth, faithful dog's eyes, and much\n  natural simplicity and dignity of character. He is ignorant,\n  stupid, and prejudiced, having been carefully trained to be so;\n  and it is not always possible to be patient with him when his\n  unquestionably good intentions become actively mischievous; but\n  one blames society, not himself, for this. He would be no worse a\n  man than Collins, had he enjoyed Collins's social opportunities.\n  He comes to the hearth, where Mrs Bridgenorth is standing with\n  her back to the fireplace.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Good morning, Boxer. [They shake hands]. Another\n  niece to give away. This is the last of them.\n\n  THE GENERAL [very gloomy] Yes, Alice. Nothing for the old warrior\n  uncle to do but give away brides to luckier men than himself.\n  Has--[he chokes] has your sister come yet?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Why do you always call Lesbia my sister? Dont\n  you know that it annoys her more than any of the rest of your\n  tricks?\n\n  THE GENERAL. Tricks! Ha! Well, I'll try to break myself of it;\n  but I think she might bear with me in a little thing like that.\n  She knows that her name sticks in my throat. Better call her your\n  sister than try to call her L-- [he almost breaks down] L-- well,\n  call her by her name and make a fool of myself by crying. [He\n  sits down at the near end of the table].\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [going to him and rallying him] Oh come, Boxer!\n  Really, really! We are no longer boys and girls. You cant keep up\n  a broken heart all your life. It must be nearly twenty years\n  since she refused you. And you know that it's not because she\n  dislikes you, but only that she's not a marrying woman.\n\n  THE GENERAL. It's no use. I love her still. And I cant help\n  telling her so whenever we meet, though I know it makes her avoid\n  me. [He all but weeps].\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. What does she say when you tell her?\n\n  THE GENERAL. Only that she wonders when I am going to grow out of\n  it. I know now that I shall never grow out of it.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Perhaps you would if you married her. I\n  believe youre better as you are, Boxer.\n\n  THE GENERAL. I'm a miserable man. I'm really sorry to be a\n  ridiculous old bore, Alice; but when I come to this house for a\n  wedding--to these scenes--to--to recollections of the past--\n  always to give the bride to somebody else, and never to have my\n  bride given to me--[he rises abruptly] May I go into the garden\n  and smoke it off?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Do, Boxer.\n\n  Collins returns with the wedding cake.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Oh, heres the cake. I believe it's the same one\n  we had for Florence's wedding.\n\n  THE GENERAL. I cant bear it [he hurries out through the garden\n  door].\n\n  COLLINS [putting the cake on the table] Well, look at that,\n  maam! Aint it odd that after all the weddings he's given away at,\n  the General cant stand the sight of a wedding cake yet. It always\n  seems to give him the same shock.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Well, it's his last shock. You have married the\n  whole family now, Collins. [She takes up The Times again and\n  resumes her seat].\n\n  COLLINS. Except your sister, maam. A fine character of a lady,\n  maam, is Miss Grantham. I have an ambition to arrange her wedding\n  breakfast.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. She wont marry, Collins.\n\n  COLLINS. Bless you, maam, they all say that. You and me said it,\n  I'll lay. I did, anyhow.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. No: marriage came natural to me. I should have\n  thought it did to you too.\n\n  COLLINS [pensive] No, maam: it didnt come natural. My wife had to\n  break me into it. It came natural to her: she's what you might\n  call a regular old hen. Always wants to have her family within\n  sight of her. Wouldnt go to bed unless she knew they was all safe\n  at home and the door locked, and the lights out. Always wants her\n  luggage in the carriage with her. Always goes and makes the\n  engine driver promise her to be careful. She's a born wife and\n  mother, maam. Thats why my children all ran away from home.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Did you ever feel inclined to run away, Collins?\n\n  COLLINS. Oh yes, maam, yes: very often. But when it came to the\n  point I couldnt bear to hurt her feelings. Shes a sensitive,\n  affectionate, anxious soul; and she was never brought up to know\n  what freedom is to some people. You see, family life is all the\n  life she knows: she's like a bird born in a cage, that would die\n  if you let it loose in the woods. When I thought how little it\n  was to a man of my easy temper to put up with her, and how deep\n  it would hurt her to think it was because I didnt care for her, I\n  always put off running away till next time; and so in the end I\n  never ran away at all. I daresay it was good for me to be took\n  such care of; but it cut me off from all my old friends something\n  dreadful, maam: especially the women, maam. She never gave them a\n  chance: she didnt indeed. She never understood that married\n  people should take holidays from one another if they are to keep\n  at all fresh. Not that I ever got tired of her, maam; but my! how\n  I used to get tired of home life sometimes. I used to catch\n  myself envying my brother George: I positively did, maam.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. George was a bachelor then, I suppose?\n\n  COLLINS. Bless you, no, maam. He married a very fine figure of a\n  woman; but she was that changeable and what you might call\n  susceptible, you would not believe. She didnt seem to have any\n  control over herself when she fell in love. She would mope for a\n  couple of days, crying about nothing; and then she would up and\n  say--no matter who was there to hear her--\"I must go to him,\n  George\"; and away she would go from her home and her husband\n  without with-your-leave or by-your-leave.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. But do you mean that she did this more than\n  once? That she came back?\n\n  COLLINS. Bless you, maam, she done it five times to my own\n  knowledge; and then George gave up telling us about it, he got so\n  used to it.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. But did he always take her back?\n\n  COLLINS. Well, what could he do, maam? Three times out of four\n  the men would bring her back the same evening and no harm done.\n  Other times theyd run away from her. What could any man with a\n  heart do but comfort her when she came back crying at the way\n  they dodged her when she threw herself at their heads, pretending\n  they was too noble to accept the sacrifice she was making. George\n  told her again and again that if she'd only stay at home and hold\n  off a bit theyd be at her feet all day long. She got sensible at\n  last and took his advice. George always liked change of company.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. What an odious woman, Collins! Dont you think\n  so?\n\n  COLLINS [judicially] Well, many ladies with a domestic turn\n  thought so and said so, maam. But I will say for Mrs George that\n  the variety of experience made her wonderful interesting. Thats\n  where the flighty ones score off the steady ones, maam. Look at\n  my old woman! She's never known any man but me; and she cant\n  properly know me, because she dont know other men to compare me\n  with. Of course she knows her parents in--well, in the way one\n  does know one's parents not knowing half their lives as you might\n  say, or ever thinking that they was ever young; and she knew her\n  children as children, and never thought of them as independent\n  human beings till they ran away and nigh broke her heart for a\n  week or two. But Mrs George she came to know a lot about men of\n  all sorts and ages; for the older she got the younger she liked\n  em; and it certainly made her interesting, and gave her a lot of\n  sense. I have often taken her advice on things when my own poor\n  old woman wouldnt have been a bit of use to me.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. I hope you dont tell your wife that you go\n  elsewhere for advice.\n\n  COLLINS. Lord bless you, maam, I'm that fond of my old Matilda\n  that I never tell her anything at all for fear of hurting her\n  feelings. You see, she's such an out-and-out wife and mother that\n  she's hardly a responsible human being out of her house, except\n  when she's marketing.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Does she approve of Mrs George?\n\n  COLLINS. Oh, Mrs George gets round her. Mrs George can get round\n  anybody if she wants to. And then Mrs George is very particular\n  about religion. And shes a clairvoyant.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [surprised] A clairvoyant!\n\n  COLLINS [calm] Oh yes, maam, yes. All you have to do is to\n  mesmerize her a bit; and off she goes into a trance, and says the\n  most wonderful things! not things about herself, but as if it was\n  the whole human race giving you a bit of its mind. Oh, wonderful,\n  maam, I assure you. You couldnt think of a game that Mrs George\n  isnt up to.\n\n  Lesbia Grantham comes in through the tower. She is a tall,\n  handsome, slender lady in her prime; that is, between 36 and 55.\n  She has what is called a well-bred air, dressing very carefully\n  to produce that effect without the least regard for the latest\n  fashions, sure of herself, very terrifying to the young and shy,\n  fastidious to the ends of her long finger-tips, and tolerant and\n  amused rather than sympathetic.\n\n  LESBIA. Good morning, dear big sister.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Good morning, dear little sister. [They kiss].\n\n  LESBIA. Good morning, Collins. How well you are looking! And how\n  young! [She turns the middle chair away from the table and sits\n  down].\n\n  COLLINS. Thats only my professional habit at a wedding, Miss. You\n  should see me at a political dinner. I look nigh seventy.\n  [Looking at his watch] Time's getting along, maam. May I send up\n  word from you to Miss Edith to hurry a bit with her dressing?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Do, Collins.\n\n  Collins goes out through the tower, taking the cake with him.\n\n  LESBIA. Dear old Collins! Has he told you any stories this\n  morning?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Yes. You were just late for a particularly\n  thrilling invention of his.\n\n  LESBIA. About Mrs George?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Yes. He says she's a clairvoyant.\n\n  LESBIA. I wonder whether he really invented George, or stole her\n  out of some book.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. I wonder!\n\n  LESBIA. Wheres the Barmecide?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. In the study, working away at his new book. He\n  thinks no more now of having a daughter married than of having an\n  egg for breakfast.\n\n  The General, soothed by smoking, comes in from the garden.\n\n  THE GENERAL [with resolute bonhomie] Ah, Lesbia!\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. How do you do? [They shake hands; and he takes\n  the chair on her right].\n\n  Mrs Bridgenorth goes out through the tower.\n\n  LESBIA. How are you, Boxer? You look almost as gorgeous as the\n  wedding cake.\n\n  THE GENERAL. I make a point of appearing in uniform whenever I\n  take part in any ceremony, as a lesson to the subalterns. It is\n  not the custom in England; but it ought to be.\n\n  LESBIA. You look very fine, Boxer. What a frightful lot of\n  bravery all these medals must represent!\n\n  THE GENERAL. No, Lesbia. They represent despair and cowardice. I\n  won all the early ones by trying to get killed. You know why.\n\n  LESBIA. But you had a charmed life?\n\n  THE GENERAL. Yes, a charmed life. Bayonets bent on my buckles.\n  Bullets passed through me and left no trace: thats the worst of\n  modern bullets: Ive never been hit by a dum-dum. When I was only\n  a company officer I had at least the right to expose myself to\n  death in the field. Now I'm a General even that resource is cut\n  off. [Persuasively drawing his chair nearer to her] Listen to me,\n  Lesbia. For the tenth and last time--\n\n  LESBIA [interrupting] On Florence's wedding morning, two years\n  ago, you said \"For the ninth and last time.\"\n\n  THE GENERAL. We are two years older, Lesbia. I'm fifty: you\n  are--\n\n  LESBIA. Yes, I know. It's no use, Boxer. When will you be old\n  enough to take no for an answer?\n\n  THE GENERAL. Never, Lesbia, never. You have never given me a real\n  reason for refusing me yet. I once thought it was somebody else.\n  There were lots of fellows after you; but now theyve all given it\n  up and married. [Bending still nearer to her] Lesbia: tell me\n  your secret. Why--\n\n  LESBIA [sniffing disgustedly] Oh! Youve been smoking. [She rises\n  and goes to the chair on the hearth] Keep away, you wretch.\n\n  THE GENERAL. But for that pipe, I could not have faced you\n  without breaking down. It has soothed me and nerved me.\n\n  LESBIA [sitting down with The Times in her hand] Well, it has\n  nerved me to tell you why I'm going to be an old maid.\n\n  THE GENERAL [impulsively approaching her] Dont say that, Lesbia.\n  It's not natural: it's not right: it's--\n\n  LESBIA. [fanning him off] No: no closer, Boxer, please. [He\n  retreats, discouraged]. It may not be natural; but it happens all\n  the time. Youll find plenty of women like me, if you care to look\n  for them: women with lots of character and good looks and money\n  and offers, who wont and dont get married. Cant you guess why?\n\n  THE GENERAL. I can understand when there is another.\n\n  LESBIA. Yes; but there isnt another. Besides, do you suppose I\n  think, at my time of life, that the difference between one decent\n  sort of man and another is worth bothering about?\n\n  THE GENERAL. The heart has its preferences, Lesbia. One image,\n  and one only, gets indelibly--\n\n  LESBIA. Yes. Excuse my interrupting you so often; but your\n  sentiments are so correct that I always know what you are going\n  to say before you finish. You see, Boxer, everybody is not like\n  you. You are a sentimental noodle: you dont see women as they\n  really are. You dont see me as I really am. Now I do see men as\n  they really are. I see you as you really are.\n\n  THE GENERAL [murmuring] No: dont say that, Lesbia.\n\n  LESBIA. I'm a regular old maid. I'm very particular about my\n  belongings. I like to have my own house, and to have it to\n  myself. I have a very keen sense of beauty and fitness and\n  cleanliness and order. I am proud of my independence and jealous\n  for it. I have a sufficiently well-stocked mind to be very good\n  company for myself if I have plenty of books and music. The one\n  thing I never could stand is a great lout of a man smoking all\n  over my house and going to sleep in his chair after dinner, and\n  untidying everything. Ugh!\n\n  THE GENERAL. But love--\n\n  LESBIA. Ob, love! Have you no imagination? Do you think I have\n  never been in love with wonderful men? heroes! archangels!\n  princes! sages! even fascinating rascals! and had the strangest\n  adventures with them? Do you know what it is to look at a mere\n  real man after that? a man with his boots in every corner, and\n  the smell of his tobacco in every curtain?\n\n  THE GENERAL [somewhat dazed] Well but--excuse my mentioning\n  it--dont you want children?\n\n  LESBIA. I ought to have children. I should be a good mother to\n  children. I believe it would pay the country very well to pay me\n  very well to have children. But the country tells me that I cant\n  have a child in my house without a man in it too; so I tell the\n  country that it will have to do without my children. If I am to\n  be a mother, I really cannot have a man bothering me to be a wife\n  at the same time.\n\n  THE GENERAL. My dear Lesbia: you know I dont wish to be\n  impertinent; but these are not the correct views for an English\n  lady to express.\n\n  LESBIA. That is why I dont express them, except to gentlemen who\n  wont take any other answer. The difficulty, you see, is that I\n  really am an English lady, and am particularly proud of being\n  one.\n\n  THE GENERAL. I'm sure of that, Lesbia: quite sure of it. I never\n  meant--\n\n  LESBIA [rising impatiently] Oh, my dear Boxer, do please try to\n  think of something else than whether you have offended me, and\n  whether you are doing the correct thing as an English gentleman.\n  You are faultless, and very dull. [She shakes her shoulders\n  intolerantly and walks across to the other side of the kitchen].\n\n  THE GENERAL [moodily] Ha! thats whats the matter with me. Not\n  clever. A poor silly soldier man.\n\n  LESBIA. The whole matter is very simple. As I say, I am an\n  English lady, by which I mean that I have been trained to do\n  without what I cant have on honorable terms, no matter what it\n  is.\n\n  THE GENERAL. I really dont understand you, Lesbia.\n\n  LESBIA [turning on him] Then why on earth do you want to marry a\n  woman you dont understand?\n\n  THE GENERAL. I dont know. I suppose I love you.\n\n  LESBIA. Well, Boxer, you can love me as much as you like,\n  provided you look happy about it and dont bore me. But you cant\n  marry me; and thats all about it.\n\n  THE GENERAL. It's so frightfully difficult to argue the matter\n  fairly with you without wounding your delicacy by overstepping\n  the bounds of good taste. But surely there are calls of nature--\n  LESBIA. Dont be ridiculous, Boxer.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Well, how am I to express it? Hang it all, Lesbia,\n  dont you want a husband?\n\n  LESBIA. No. I want children; and I want to devote myself entirely\n  to my children, and not to their father. The law will not allow\n  me to do that; so I have made up my mind to have neither husband\n  nor children.\n\n  THE GENERAL. But, great Heavens, the natural appetites--\n\n  LESBIA. As I said before, an English lady is not the slave of her\n  appetites. That is what an English gentleman seems incapable of\n  understanding. [She sits down at the end of the table, near the\n  study door].\n\n  THE GENERAL [huffily] Oh well, if you refuse, you refuse. I shall\n  not ask you again. I'm sorry I returned to the subject. [He\n  retires to the hearth and plants himself there, wounded and\n  lofty].\n\n  LESBIA. Dont be cross, Boxer.\n\n  THE GENERAL. I'm not cross, only wounded, Lesbia. And when you\n  talk like that, I dont feel convinced: I only feel utterly at a\n  loss.\n\n  LESBIA. Well, you know our family rule. When at a loss consult\n  the greengrocer. [Opportunely Collins comes in through the\n  tower]. Here he is.\n\n  COLLINS. Sorry to be so much in and out, Miss. I thought Mrs\n  Bridgenorth was here. The table is ready now for the breakfast,\n  if she would like to see it.\n\n  LESBIA. If you are satisfied, Collins, I am sure she will be.\n\n  THE GENERAL. By the way, Collins: I thought theyd made you an\n  alderman.\n\n  COLLINS. So they have, General.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Then wheres your gown?\n\n  COLLINS. I dont wear it in private life, General.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Why? Are you ashamed of it?\n\n  COLLINS. No, General. To tell you the truth, I take a pride in\n  it. I cant help it.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Attention, Collins. Come here. [Collins comes to\n  him]. Do you see my uniform--all my medals?\n\n  COLLINS. Yes, General. They strike the eye, as it were.\n\n  THE GENERAL. They are meant to. Very well. Now you know, dont\n  you, that your services to the community as a greengrocer are as\n  important and as dignified as mine as a soldier?\n\n  COLLINS. I'm sure it's very honorable of you to say so, General.\n\n  THE GENERAL [emphatically] You know also, dont you, that any man\n  who can see anything ridiculous, or unmanly, or unbecoming in\n  your work or in your civic robes is not a gentleman, but a\n  jumping, bounding, snorting cad?\n\n  COLLINS. Well, strictly between ourselves, that is my opinion,\n  General.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Then why not dignify my niece's wedding by wearing\n  your robes?\n\n  COLLINS. A bargain's a bargain, General. Mrs Bridgenorth sent for\n  the greengrocer, not for the alderman. It's just as unpleasant to\n  get more than you bargain for as to get less.\n\n  THE GENERAL. I'm sure she will agree with me. I attach importance\n  to this as an affirmation of solidarity in the service of the\n  community. The Bishop's apron, my uniform, your robes: the\n  Church, the Army, and the Municipality.\n\n  COLLINS [retiring] Very well, General. [He turns dubiously to\n  Lesbia on his way to the tower]. I wonder what my wife will say,\n  Miss?\n\n  THE GENERAL. What! Is your, wife ashamed of your robes?\n\n  COLLINS. No, sir, not ashamed of them. But she grudged the money\n  for them; and she will be afraid of my sleeves getting into the\n  gravy.\n\n  Mrs Bridgenorth, her placidity quite upset, comes in with a\n  letter; hurries past Collins; and comes between Lesbia and the\n  General.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Lesbia: Boxer: heres a pretty mess!\n\n  Collins goes out discreetly.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Whats the matter?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Reginald's in London, and wants to come to the\n  wedding.\n\n  THE GENERAL [stupended] Well, dash my buttons!\n\n  LESBIA. Oh, all right, let him come.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Let him come! Why, the decree has not been made\n  absolute yet. Is he to walk in here to Edith's wedding, reeking\n  from the Divorce Court?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [vexedly sitting down in the middle chair] It's\n  too bad. No: I cant forgive him, Lesbia, really. A man of\n  Reginald's age, with a young wife--the best of girls, and as\n  pretty as she can be--to go off with a common woman from the\n  streets! Ugh!\n\n  LESBIA. You must make allowances. What can you expect? Reginald\n  was always weak. He was brought up to be weak. The family\n  property was all mortgaged when he inherited it. He had to\n  struggle along in constant money difficulties, hustled by his\n  solicitors, morally bullied by the Barmecide, and physically\n  bullied by Boxer, while they two were fighting their own way and\n  getting well trained. You know very well he couldnt afford to\n  marry until the mortgages were cleared and he was over fifty. And\n  then of course he made a fool of himself marrying a child like\n  Leo.\n\n  THE GENERAL. But to hit her! Absolutely to hit her! He knocked\n  her down--knocked her flat down on a flowerbed in the presence of\n  his gardener. He! the head of the family! the man that stands\n  before the Barmecide and myself as Bridgenorth of Bridgenorth! to\n  beat his wife and go off with a low woman and be divorced for it\n  in the face of all England! in the face of my uniform and\n  Alfred's apron! I can never forget what I felt: it was only the\n  King's personal request--virtually a command--that stopped me\n  from resigning my commission. I'd cut Reginald dead if I met him\n  in the street.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Besides, Leo's coming. Theyd meet. It's\n  impossible, Lesbia.\n\n  LESBIA. Oh, I forgot that. That settles it. He mustnt come.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Of course he mustnt. You tell him that if he enters\n  this house, I'll leave it; and so will every decent man and woman\n  in it.\n\n  COLLINS [returning for a moment to announce] Mr Reginald, maam.\n  [He withdraws when Reginald enters].\n\n  THE GENERAL [beside himself] Well, dash my buttons!!\n\n  Reginald is just the man Lesbia has described. He is hardened and\n  tough physically, and hasty and boyish in his manner and speech,\n  belonging as he does to the large class of English gentlemen of\n  property (solicitor-managed) who have never developed\n  intellectually since their schooldays. He is a muddled,\n  rebellious, hasty, untidy, forgetful, always late sort of man,\n  who very evidently needs the care of a capable woman, and has\n  never been lucky or attractive enough to get it. All the same, a\n  likeable man, from whom nobody apprehends any malice nor expects\n  any achievement. In everything but years he is younger than his\n  brother the General.\n\n  REGINALD [coming forward between the General and Mrs Bridgenorth]\n  Alice: it's no use. I cant stay away from Edith's wedding. Good\n  morning, Lesbia. How are you, Boxer? [He offers the General his\n  hand].\n\n  THE GENERAL [with crushing stiffness] I was just telling Alice,\n  sir, that if you entered this house, I should leave it.\n\n  REGINALD. Well, dont let me detain you, old chap. When you start\n  calling people Sir, youre not particularly good company.\n\n  LESBIA. Dont you begin to quarrel. That wont improve the\n  situation.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. I think you might have waited until you got my\n  answer, Rejjy.\n\n  REGINALD. It's so jolly easy to say No in a letter. Wont you let\n  me stay?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. How can I? Leo's coming.\n\n  REGINALD. Well, she wont mind.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Wont mind!!!!\n\n  LESBIA. Dont talk nonsense, Rejjy; and be off with you.\n\n  THE GENERAL [with biting sarcasm] At school you lead a theory\n  that women liked being knocked down, I remember.\n\n  REGINALD. Youre a nice, chivalrous, brotherly sort of swine, you\n  are.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Mr Bridgenorth: are you going to leave this house or\n  am I?\n\n  REGINALD. You are, I hope. [He emphasizes his intention to stay\n  by sitting down].\n\n  THE GENERAL. Alice: will you allow me to be driven from Edith's\n  wedding by this--\n\n  LESBIA [warningly] Boxer!\n\n  THE GENERAL. --by this Respondent? Is Edith to be given away by\n  him?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Certainly not. Reginald: you were not asked to\n  come; and I have asked you to go. You know how fond I am of Leo;\n  and you know what she would feel if she came in and found you\n  here.\n\n  COLLINS [again appearing in the tower] Mrs Reginald, maam.\n\n  LESBIA            {No, no. Ask her to--   } [All three\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH   {Oh,  how unfortunate!  } clamoring\n  THE GENERAL       {Well, dash my buttons! } together].\n\n  It is too late: Leo is already in the kitchen. Collins goes out,\n  mutely abandoning a situation which he deplores but has been\n  unable to save.\n\n  Leo is very pretty, very youthful, very restless, and\n  consequently very charming to people who are touched by youth and\n  beauty, as well as to those who regard young women as more or\n  less appetizing lollipops, and dont regard old women at all.\n  Coldly studied, Leo's restlessness is much less lovable than the\n  kittenishness which comes from a rich and fresh vitality. She is\n  a born fusser about herself and everybody else for whom she feels\n  responsible; and her vanity causes her to exaggerate her\n  responsibilities officiously. All her fussing is about little\n  things; but she often calls them by big names, such as Art, the\n  Divine Spark, the world, motherhood, good breeding, the Universe,\n  the Creator, or anything else that happens to strike her\n  imagination as sounding intellectually important. She has more\n  than common imagination and no more than common conception and\n  penetration; so that she is always on the high horse about words\n  and always in the perambulator about things. Considering herself\n  clever, thoughtful, and superior to ordinary weaknesses and\n  prejudices, she recklessly attaches herself to clever men on that\n  understanding, with the result that they are first delighted,\n  then exasperated, and finally bored. When marrying Reginald she\n  told her friends that there was a great deal in him which needed\n  bringing out. If she were a middle-aged man she would be the\n  terror of his club. Being a pretty young woman, she is forgiven\n  everything, proving that \"Tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner\"\n  is an error, the fact being that the secret of forgiving\n  everything is to understand nothing.\n\n  She runs in fussily, full of her own importance, and swoops on\n  Lesbia, who is much less disposed to spoil her than Mrs\n  Bridgenorth is. But Leo affects a special intimacy with Lesbia,\n  as of two thinkers among the Philistines.\n\n  LEO [to Lesbia, kissing her] Good morning. [Coming to Mrs\n  Bridgenorth] How do, Alice? [Passing on towards the hearth] Why\n  so gloomy, General? [Reginald rises between her and the General]\n  Oh, Rejjy! What will the King's Proctor say?\n\n  REGINALD. Damn the King's Proctor!\n\n  LEO. Naughty. Well, I suppose I must kiss you; but dont any of\n  you tell. [She kisses him. They can hardly believe their eyes].\n  Have you kept all your promises?\n\n  REGINALD. Oh, dont begin bothering about those--\n\n  LEO [insisting] Have? You? Kept? Your? Promises? Have you rubbed\n  your head with the lotion every night?\n\n  REGINALD. Yes, yes. Nearly every night.\n\n  LEO. Nearly! I know what that means. Have you worn your liver\n  pad?\n\n  THE GENERAL [solemnly] Leo: forgiveness is one of the most\n  beautiful traits in a woman's nature; but there are things that\n  should not be forgiven to a man. When a man knocks a woman down\n  [Leo gives a little shriek of laughter and collapses on a chair\n  next Mrs Bridgenorth, on her left]\n\n  REGINALD [sardonically] The man that would raise his hand to a\n  woman, save in the way of a kindness, is unworthy the name of\n  Bridgenorth. [He sits down at the end of the table nearest the\n  hearth].\n\n  THE GENERAL [much huffed] Oh, well, if Leo does not mind, of\n  course I have no more to say. But I think you might, out of\n  consideration for the family, beat your wife in private and not\n  in the presence of the gardener.\n\n  REGINALD [out of patience] Whats the good of beating your wife\n  unless theres a witness to prove it afterwards? You dont suppose\n  a man beats his wife for the fun of it, do you? How could she\n  have got her divorce if I hadnt beaten her? Nice state of things,\n  that!\n\n  THE GENERAL [gasping] Do you mean to tell me that you did it in\n  cold blood? simply to get rid of your wife?\n\n  REGINALD. No, I didn't: I did it to get her rid of me. What would\n  you do if you were fool enough to marry a woman thirty years\n  younger than yourself, and then found that she didnt care for\n  you, and was in love with a young fellow with a face like a\n  mushroom.\n\n  LEO. He has not. [Bursting into tears] And you are most unkind to\n  say I didnt care for you. Nobody could have been fonder of you.\n\n  REGINALD. A nice way of shewing your fondness! I had to go out\n  and dig that flower bed all over with my own hands to soften it.\n  I had to pick all the stones out of it. And then she complained\n  that I hadnt done it properly, because she got a worm down her\n  neck. I had to go to Brighton with a poor creature who took a\n  fancy to me on the way down, and got conscientious scruples about\n  committing perjury after dinner. I had to put her down in the\n  hotel book as Mrs Reginald Bridgenorth: Leo's name! Do you know\n  what that feels like to a decent man? Do you know what a decent\n  man feels about his wife's name? How would you like to go into a\n  hotel before all the waiters and people with--with that on your\n  arm? Not that it was the poor girl's fault, of course; only she\n  started crying because I couldnt stand her touching me; and now\n  she keeps writing to me. And then I'm held up in the public court\n  for cruelty and adultery, and turned away from Edith's wedding by\n  Alice, and lectured by you! a bachelor, and a precious green one\n  at that. What do you know about it?\n\n  THE GENERAL. Am I to understand that the whole case was one of\n  collusion?\n\n  REGINALD. Of course it was. Half the cases are collusions: what\n  are people to do? [The General, passing his hand dazedly over his\n  bewildered brow, sinks into the railed chair]. And what do you\n  take me for, that you should have the cheek to pretend to believe\n  all that rot about my knocking Leo about and leaving her for--for\n  a--a-- Ugh! you should have seen her.\n\n  THE GENERAL. This is perfectly astonishing to me. Why did you do\n  it? Why did Leo allow it?\n\n  REGINALD. Youd better ask her.\n\n  LEO [still in tears] I'm sure I never thought it would be so\n  horrid for Rejjy. I offered honorably to do it myself, and let\n  him divorce me; but he wouldnt. And he said himself that it was\n  the only way to do it--that it was the law that he should do it\n  that way. I never saw that hateful creature until that day in\n  Court. If he had only shewn her to me before, I should never have\n  allowed it.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. You did all this for Leo's sake, Rejjy?\n\n  REGINALD [with an unbearable sense of injury] I shouldnt mind a\n  bit if it were for Leo's sake. But to have to do it to make room\n  for that mushroom-faced serpent--!\n\n  THE GENERAL [jumping up] What right had he to be made room for?\n  Are you in your senses? What right?\n\n  REGINALD. The right of being a young man, suitable to a young\n  woman. I had no right at my age to marry Leo: she knew no more\n  about life than a child.\n\n  LEO. I knew a great deal more about it than a great baby like\n  you. I'm sure I dont know how youll get on with no one to take\n  care of you: I often lie awake at night thinking about it. And\n  now youve made me thoroughly miserable.\n\n  REGINALD. Serve you right! [She weeps]. There: dont get into a\n  tantrum, Leo.\n\n  LESBIA. May one ask who is the mushroom-faced serpent?\n\n  LEO. He isnt.\n\n  REGINALD. Sinjon Hotchkiss, of course.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Sinjon Hotchkiss! Why, he's coming to the\n  wedding!\n\n  REGINALD. What! In that case I'm off [he makes for the tower].\n\n  LEO          }                 { [seizing him] No you shant.\n                                   You promised to be nice to\n                   (all four       him.\n  THE GENERAL  }    rushing      { No, dont go, old chap. Not\n                    after him      from Edith's wedding.\n                    and capturing\n                    him on the\n  MRS. BRIDGE-      threshold)\n  NORTH        }                 { Oh, do stay, Benjjy. I shall\n                                   really be hurt if you desert\n                                   us.\n  LESBIA       }                 { Better stay, Reginald. You must\n                                   meet him sooner or later.\n\n\n  REGINALD. A moment ago, when I wanted to stay, you were all\n  shoving me out of the house. Now that I want to go, you wont let\n  me.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. I shall send a note to Mr Hotchkiss not to come.\n\n  LEO [weeping again] Oh, Alice! [She comes back to her chair,\n  heartbroken].\n\n  REGINALD [out of patience] Oh well, let her have her way. Let her\n  have her mushroom. Let him come. Let them all come.\n\n  He crosses the kitchen to the oak chest and sits sulkily on it.\n  Mrs Bridgenorth shrugs her shoulders and sits at the table in\n  Reginald's neighborhood listening in placid helplessness. Lesbia,\n  out of patience with Leo's tears, goes into the garden and sits\n  there near the door, snuffing up the open air in her relief from\n  the domestic stuffness of Reginald's affairs.\n\n  LEO. It's so cruel of you to go on pretending that I dont care\n  for you, Rejjy.\n\n  REGINALD [bitterly] She explained to me that it was only that she\n  had exhausted my conversation.\n\n  THE GENERAL [coming paternally to Leo] My dear girl: all the\n  conversation in the world has been exhausted long ago. Heaven\n  knows I have exhausted the conversation of the British Army these\n  thirty years; but I dont leave it on that account.\n\n  LEO. It's not that Ive exhausted it; but he will keep on\n  repeating it when I want to read or go to sleep. And Sinjon\n  amuses me. He's so clever.\n\n  THE GENERAL [stung] Ha! The old complaint. You all want geniuses\n  to marry. This demand for clever men is ridiculous. Somebody must\n  marry the plain, honest, stupid fellows. Have you thought of\n  that?\n\n  LEO. But there are such lots of stupid women to marry. Why do\n  they want to marry us? Besides, Rejjy knows that I'm quite fond\n  of him. I like him because he wants me; and I like Sinjon because\n  I want him. I feel that I have a duty to Rejjy.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Precisely: you have.\n\n  LEO. And, of course, Sinjon has the same duty to me.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Tut, tut!\n\n  LEO. Oh, how silly the law is! Why cant I marry them both?\n\n  THE GENERAL [shocked] Leo!\n\n  LEO. Well, I love them both. I should like to marry a lot of men.\n  I should like to have Rejjy for every day, and Sinjon for\n  concerts and theatres and going out in the evenings, and some\n  great austere saint for about once a year at the end of the\n  season, and some perfectly blithering idiot of a boy to be quite\n  wicked with. I so seldom feel wicked; and, when I do, it's such a\n  pity to waste it merely because it's too silly to confess to a\n  real grown-up man.\n\n  REGINALD. This is the kind of thing, you know [Helplessly] Well,\n  there it is!\n\n  THE GENERAL [decisively] Alice: this is a job for the Barmecide.\n  He's a Bishop: it's his duty to talk to Leo. I can stand a good\n  deal; but when it comes to flat polygamy and polyandry, we ought\n  to do something.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [going to the study door] Do come here a moment,\n  Alfred. We're in a difficulty.\n\n  THE BISHOP [within] Ask Collins, I'm busy.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Collins wont do. It's something very serious. Do\n  come just a moment, dear. [When she hears him coming she takes a\n  chair at the nearest end of the table].\n\n  The Bishop comes out of his study. He is still a slim active man,\n  spare of flesh, and younger by temperament than his brothers. He\n  has a delicate skin, fine hands, a salient nose with chin to\n  match, a short beard which accentuates his sharp chin by\n  bristling forward, clever humorous eyes, not without a glint of\n  mischief in them, ready bright speech, and the ways of a\n  successful man who is always interested in himself and generally\n  rather well pleased with himself. When Lesbia hears his voice she\n  turns her chair towards him, and presently rises and stands in\n  the doorway listening to the conversation.\n\n  THE BISHOP [going to Leo] Good morning, my dear. Hullo! Youve\n  brought Reginald with you. Thats very nice of you. Have you\n  reconciled them, Boxer?\n\n  THE GENERAL. Reconciled them! Why, man, the whole divorce was a\n  put-up job. She wants to marry some fellow named Hotchkiss.\n\n  REGINALD. A fellow with a face like--\n\n  LEO. You shant, Rejjy. He has a very fine face.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. And now she says she wants to marry both of\n  them, and a lot of other people as well.\n\n  LEO. I didnt say I wanted to marry them: I only said I should\n  like to marry them.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Quite a nice distinction, Leo.\n\n  LEO. Just occasionally, you know.\n\n  THE BISHOP [sitting down cosily beside her] Quite so. Sometimes a\n  poet, sometimes a Bishop, sometimes a fairy prince, sometimes\n  somebody quite indescribable, and sometimes nobody at all.\n\n  LEO. Yes: thats just it. How did you know?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Oh, I should say most imaginative and cultivated\n  young women feel like that. I wouldnt give a rap for one who\n  didnt. Shakespear pointed out long ago that a woman wanted a\n  Sunday husband as well as a weekday one. But, as usual, he didnt\n  follow up the idea.\n\n  THE GENERAL [aghast] Am I to understand--\n\n  THE BISHOP [cutting him short] Now, Boxer, am I the Bishop or are\n  you?\n\n  THE GENERAL [sulkily] You.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Then dont ask me are you to understand. \"Yours not to\n  reason why: yours but to do and die\"--\n\n  THE GENERAL. Oh, very well: go on. I'm not clever. Only a silly\n  soldier man. Ha! Go on. [He throws himself into the railed chair,\n  as one prepared for the worst].\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Alfred: dont tease Boxer.\n\n  THE BISHOP. If we are going to discuss ethical questions we must\n  begin by giving the devil fair play. Boxer never does. England\n  never does. We always assume that the devil is guilty; and we\n  wont allow him to prove his innocence, because it would be\n  against public morals if he succeeded. We used to do the same\n  with prisoners accused of high treason. And the consequence is\n  that we overreach ourselves; and the devil gets the better of us\n  after all. Perhaps thats what most of us intend him to do.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Alfred: we asked you here to preach to Leo. You are\n  preaching at me instead. I am not conscious of having said or\n  done anything that calls for that unsolicited attention.\n\n  THE BISHOP. But poor little Leo has only told the simple truth;\n  whilst you, Boxer, are striking moral attitudes.\n\n  THE GENERAL. I suppose thats an epigram. I dont understand\n  epigrams. I'm only a silly soldier man. Ha! But I can put a plain\n  question. Is Leo to be encouraged to be a polygamist?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Remember the British Empire, Boxer. Youre a British\n  General, you know.\n\n  THE GENERAL. What has that to do with polygamy?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Well, the great majority of our fellow-subjects are\n  polygamists. I cant as a British Bishop insult them by speaking\n  disrespectfully of polygamy. It's a very interesting question.\n  Many very interesting men have been polygamists: Solomon,\n  Mahomet, and our friend the Duke of--of--hm! I never can remember\n  his name.\n\n  THE GENERAL. It would become you better, Alfred, to send that\n  silly girl back to her husband and her duty than to talk clever\n  and mock at your religion. \"What God hath joined together let no\n  man put asunder.\" Remember that.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Dont be afraid, Boxer. What God hath joined together\n  no man ever shall put asunder: God will take care of that. [To\n  Leo] By the way, who was it that joined you and Reginald, my\n  dear?\n\n  LEO. It was that awful little curate that afterwards drank, and\n  travelled first class with a third-class ticket, and then tried\n  to go on the stage. But they wouldnt have him. He called himself\n  Egerton Fotheringay.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Well, whom Egerton Fotheringay hath joined, let Sir\n  Gorell Barnes put asunder by all means.\n\n  THE GENERAL. I may be a silly soldier man; but I call this\n  blasphemy.\n\n  THE BISHOP [gravely] Better for me to take the name of Mr Egerton\n  Fotheringay in earnest than for you to take a higher name in\n  vain.\n\n  LESBIA. Cant you three brothers ever meet without quarrelling?\n\n  THE BISHOP [mildly] This is not quarrelling, Lesbia: it's only\n  English family life. Good morning.\n\n  LEO. You know, Bishop, it's very dear of you to take my part; but\n  I'm not sure that I'm not a little shocked.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Then I think Ive been a little more successful than\n  Boxer in getting you into a proper frame of mind.\n\n  THE GENERAL [snorting] Ha!\n\n  LEO. Not a bit; for now I'm going to shock you worse than ever.\n  I think Solomon was an old beast.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Precisely what you ought to think of him, my dear.\n  Dont apologize.\n\n  THE GENERAL [more shocked] Well, but hang it! Solomon was in the\n  Bible. And, after all, Solomon was Solomon.\n\n  LEO. And I stick to it: I still want to have a lot of interesting\n  men to know quite intimately--to say everything I think of to\n  them, and have them say everything they think of to me.\n\n  THE BISHOP. So you shall, my dear, if you are lucky. But you know\n  you neednt marry them all. Think of all the buttons you would\n  have to sew on. Besides, nothing is more dreadful than a husband\n  who keeps telling you everything he thinks, and always wants to\n  know what you think.\n\n  LEO [struck by this] Well, thats very true of Rejjy: In fact,\n  thats why I had to divorce him.\n\n  THE BISHOP [condoling] Yes: he repeats himself dreadfully, doesnt\n  he?\n\n  REGINALD. Look here, Alfred. If I have my faults, let her find\n  them out for herself without your help.\n\n  THE BISHOP. She has found them all out already, Reginald.\n\n  LEO [a little huffily] After all, there are worse men than\n  Reginald. I daresay he's not so clever as you; but still he's not\n  such a fool as you seem to think him!\n\n  THE BISHOP. Quite right, dear: stand up for your husband. I hope\n  you will always stand up for all your husbands. [He rises and\n  goes to the hearth, where he stands complacently with his back to\n  the fireplace, beaming at them all as at a roomful of children].\n\n  LEO. Please dont talk as if I wanted to marry a whole regiment.\n  For me there can never be more than two. I shall never love\n  anybody but Rejjy and Sinjon.\n\n  REGINALD. A man with a face like a--\n\n  LEO. I wont have it, Rejjy. It's disgusting.\n\n  THE BISHOP. You see, my dear, youll exhaust Sinjon's conversation\n  too in a week or so. A man is like a phonograph with half-a-dozen\n  records. You soon get tired of them all; and yet you have to sit\n  at table whilst he reels them off to every new visitor. In the\n  end you have to be content with his common humanity; and when you\n  come down to that, you find out about men what a great English\n  poet of my acquaintance used to say about women: that they all\n  taste alike. Marry whom you please: at the end of a month he'll\n  be Reginald over again. It wasnt worth changing: indeed it wasnt.\n\n  LEO. Then it's a mistake to get married.\n\n  THE BISHOP. It is, my dear; but it's a much bigger mistake not to\n  get married.\n\n  THE GENERAL [rising] Ha! You hear that, Lesbia? [He joins her at\n  the garden door].\n\n  LESBIA. Thats only an epigram, Boxer.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Sound sense, Lesbia. When a man talks rot, thats\n  epigram: when he talks sense, then I agree with him.\n\n  REGINALD [coming off the oak chest and looking at his watch] It's\n  getting late. Wheres Edith? Hasnt she got into her veil and\n  orange blossoms yet?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Do go and hurry her, Lesbia.\n\n  LESBIA [going out through the tower] Come with me, Leo.\n\n  LEO [following Lesbia out] Yes, certainly.\n\n  The Bishop goes over to his wife and sits down, taking her hand\n  and kissing it by way of beginning a conversation with her.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Alice: Ive had another letter from the mysterious\n  lady who cant spell. I like that woman's letters. Theres an\n  intensity of passion in them that fascinates me.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Do you mean Incognita Appassionata?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Yes.\n\n  THE GENERAL [turning abruptly; he has been looking out into the\n  garden] Do you mean to say that women write love-letters to you?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Of course.\n\n  THE GENERAL. They never do to me.\n\n  THE BISHOP. The army doesnt attract women: the Church does.\n\n  REGINALD. Do you consider it right to let them? They may be\n  married women, you know.\n\n  THE BISHOP. They always are. This one is. [To Mrs Bridgenorth]\n  Dont you think her letters are quite the best love-letters I get?\n  [To the two men] Poor Alice has to read my love-letters aloud to\n  me at breakfast, when theyre worth it.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. There really is something fascinating about\n  Incognita. She never gives her address. Thats a good sign.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Mf! No assignations, you mean?\n\n  THE Bishop. Oh yes: she began the correspondence by making a very\n  curious but very natural assignation. She wants me to meet her in\n  heaven. I hope I shall.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Well, I must say I hope not, Alfred. I hope not.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. She says she is happily married, and that love\n  is a necessary of life to her, but that she must have, high above\n  all her lovers--\n\n  THE BISHOP. She has several apparently--\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. --some great man who will never know her, never\n  touch her, as she is on earth, but whom she can meet in Heaven\n  when she has risen above all the everyday vulgarities of earthly\n  love.\n\n  THE BISHOP [rising] Excellent. Very good for her; and no trouble\n  to me. Everybody ought to have one of these idealizations, like\n  Dante's Beatrice. [He clasps his hands behind him, and strolls to\n  the hearth and back, singing].\n\n  Lesbia appears in the tower, rather perturbed.\n\n  LESBIA. Alice: will you come upstairs? Edith is not dressed.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [rising] Not dressed! Does she know what hour it\n  is?\n\n  LESBIA. She has locked herself into her room, reading.\n\n  The Bishop's song ceases; he stops dead in his stroll.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Reading!\n\n  THE BISHOP. What is she reading?\n\n  LESBIA. Some pamphlet that came by the eleven o'clock post. She\n  wont come out. She wont open the door. And she says she doesnt\n  know whether she's going to be married or not till she's finished\n  the pamphlet. Did you ever hear such a thing? Do come and speak\n  to her.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Alfred: you had better go.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Try Collins.\n\n  LESBIA. Weve tried Collins already. He got all that Ive told you\n  out of her through the keyhole. Come, Alice. [She vanishes. Mrs\n  Bridgenorth hurries after her].\n\n  THE BISHOP. This means a delay. I shall go back to my work [he\n  makes for the study door].\n\n  REGINALD. What are you working at now?\n\n  THE BISHOP [stopping] A chapter in my history of marriage. I'm\n  just at the Roman business, you know.\n\n  THE GENERAL [coming from the garden door to the chair Mrs\n  Bridgenorth has just left, and sitting down] Not more Ritualism,\n  I hope, Alfred?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Oh no. I mean ancient Rome. [He seats himself on the\n  edge of the table]. Ive just come to the period when the\n  propertied classes refused to get married and went in for\n  marriage settlements instead. A few of the oldest families stuck\n  to the marriage tradition so as to keep up the supply of vestal\n  virgins, who had to be legitimate; but nobody else dreamt of\n  getting married. It's all very interesting, because we're coming\n  to that here in England; except that as we dont require any\n  vestal virgins, nobody will get married at all, except the poor,\n  perhaps.\n\n  THE GENERAL. You take it devilishly coolly. Reginald: do you\n  think the Barmecide's quite sane?\n\n  REGINALD. No worse than ever he was.\n\n  THE GENERAL [to the Bishop] Do you mean to say you believe such a\n  thing will ever happen in England as that respectable people will\n  give up being married?\n\n  THE BISHOP. In England especially they will. In other countries\n  the introduction of reasonable divorce laws will save the\n  situation; but in England we always let an institution strain\n  itself until it breaks. Ive told our last four Prime Ministers\n  that if they didnt make our marriage laws reasonable there would\n  be a strike against marriage, and that it would begin among the\n  propertied classes, where no Government would dare to interfere\n  with it.\n\n  REGINALD. What did they say to that?\n\n  THE BISHOP. The usual thing. Quite agreed with me, but were sure\n  that they were the only sensible men in the world, and that the\n  least hint of marriage reform would lose them the next election.\n  And then lost it all the same: on cordite, on drink, on Chinese\n  labor in South Africa, on all sorts of trumpery.\n\n  REGINALD [lurching across the kitchen towards the hearth with his\n  hands in his pockets] It's no use: they wont listen to our sort.\n  [Turning on them] Of course they have to make you a Bishop and\n  Boxer a General, because, after all, their blessed rabble of\n  snobs and cads and half-starved shopkeepers cant do government\n  work; and the bounders and week-enders are too lazy and vulgar.\n  Theyd simply rot without us; but what do they ever do for us?\n  what attention do they ever pay to what we say and what we want?\n  I take it that we Bridgenorths are a pretty typical English\n  family of the sort that has always set things straight and stuck\n  up for the right to think and believe according to our\n  conscience. But nowadays we are expected to dress and eat as the\n  week-end bounders do, and to think and believe as the converted\n  cannibals of Central Africa do, and to lie down and let every\n  snob and every cad and every halfpenny journalist walk over us.\n  Why, theres not a newspaper in England today that represents what\n  I call solid Bridgenorth opinion and tradition. Half of them read\n  as if they were published at the nearest mother's meeting, and\n  the other half at the nearest motor garage. Do you call these\n  chaps gentlemen? Do you call them Englishmen? I dont.[He throws\n  himself disgustedly into the nearest chair].\n\n  THE GENERAL [excited by Reginald's eloquence] Do you see my\n  uniform? What did Collins say? It strikes the eye. It was meant\n  to. I put it on expressly to give the modern army bounder a smack\n  in the eye. Somebody has to set a right example by beginning.\n  Well, let it be a Bridgenorth. I believe in family blood and\n  tradition, by George.\n\n  THE BISHOP [musing] I wonder who will begin the stand against\n  marriage. It must come some day. I was married myself before I'd\n  thought about it; and even if I had thought about it I was too\n  much in love with Alice to let anything stand in the way. But,\n  you know, Ive seen one of our daughters after another--Ethel,\n  Jane, Fanny, and Christina and Florence--go out at that door in\n  their veils and orange blossoms; and Ive always wondered whether\n  theyd have gone quietly if theyd known what they were doing. Ive\n  a horrible misgiving about that pamphlet. All progress means war\n  with Society. Heaven forbid that Edith should be one of the\n  combatants!\n\n  St John Hotchkiss comes into the tower ushered by Collins. He is\n  a very smart young gentleman of twenty-nine or thereabouts,\n  correct in dress to the last thread of his collar, but too much\n  preoccupied with his ideas to be embarrassed by any concern as to\n  his appearance. He talks about himself with energetic gaiety. He\n  talks to other people with a sweet forbearance (implying a kindly\n  consideration for their stupidity) which infuriates those whom he\n  does not succeed in amusing. They either lose their tempers with\n  him or try in vain to snub him.\n\n  COLLINS [announcing] Mr Hotchkiss. [He withdraws].\n\n  HOTCHKISS [clapping Reginald gaily on the shoulder as he passes\n  him] Tootle loo, Rejjy.\n\n  REGINALD [curtly, without rising or turning his head] Morning.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Good morning, Bishop.\n\n  THE BISHOP [coming off the table]. What on earth are you doing\n  here, Sinjon? You belong to the bridegroom's party: youve no\n  business here until after the ceremony.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Yes, I know: thats just it. May I have a word with you\n  in private? Rejjy or any of the family wont matter; but--[he\n  glances at the General, who has risen rather stiffly, as he\n  strongly disapproves of the part played by Hotchkiss in\n  Reginald's domestic affairs].\n\n  THE BISHOP. All right, Sinjon. This is our brother, General\n  Bridgenorth. [He goes to the hearth and posts himself there, with\n  his hands clasped behind him].\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Oh, good! [He turns to the General, and takes out a\n  card-case]. As you are in the service, allow me to introduce\n  myself. Read my card, please. [He presents his card to the\n  astonished General].\n\n  THE GENERAL [reading] \"Mr St John Hotchkiss, the Celebrated\n  Coward, late Lieutenant in the 165th Fusiliers.\"\n\n  REGINALD [with a chuckle] He was sent back from South Africa\n  because he funked an order to attack, and spoiled his commanding\n  officer's plan.\n\n  THE GENERAL [very gravely] I remember the case now. I had\n  forgotten the name. I'll not refuse your acquaintance, Mr\n  Hotchkiss; partly because youre my brother's guest, and partly\n  because Ive seen too much active service not to know that every\n  man's nerve plays him false at one time or another, and that some\n  very honorable men should never go into action at all, because\n  theyre not built that way. But if I were you I should not use\n  that visiting card. No doubt it's an honorable trait in your\n  character that you dont wish any man to give you his hand in\n  ignorance of your disgrace; but you had better allow us to\n  forget. We wish to forget. It isnt your disgrace alone: it's a\n  disgrace to the army and to all of us. Pardon my plain speaking.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [sunnily] My dear General, I dont know what fear means\n  in the military sense of the word. Ive fought seven duels with\n  the sabre in Italy and Austria, and one with pistols in France,\n  without turning a hair. There was no other way in which I could\n  vindicate my motives in refusing to make that attack at\n  Smutsfontein. I dont pretend to be a brave man. I'm afraid of\n  wasps. I'm afraid of cats. In spite of the voice of reason, I'm\n  afraid of ghosts; and twice Ive fled across Europe from false\n  alarms of cholera. But afraid to fight I am not. [He turns gaily\n  to Reginald and slaps him on the shoulder]. Eh, Rejjy? [Reginald\n  grunts].\n\n  THE GENERAL. Then why did you not do your duty at Smutsfontein?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I did my duty--my higher duty. If I had made that\n  attack, my commanding officer's plan would have been successful,\n  and he would have been promoted. Now I happen to think that the\n  British Army should be commanded by gentlemen, and by gentlemen\n  alone. This man was not a gentleman. I sacrificed my military\n  career--I faced disgrace and social ostracism rather than give\n  that man his chance.\n\n  THE GENERAL [generously indignant] Your commanding officer, sir,\n  was my friend Major Billiter.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Precisely. What a name!\n\n  THE GENERAL. And pray, sir, on what ground do you dare allege\n  that Major Billiter is not a gentleman?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. By an infallible sign: one of those trifles that stamp\n  a man. He eats rice pudding with a spoon.\n\n  THE GENERAL [very angry] Confound you, _I_ eat rice pudding with\n  a spoon. Now!\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Oh, so do I, frequently. But there are ways of doing\n  these things. Billiter's way was unmistakable.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Well, I'll tell you something now. When I thought\n  you were only a coward, I pitied you, and would have done what I\n  could to help you back to your place in Society--\n\n  HOTCHKISS [interrupting him] Thank you: I havnt lost it. My\n  motives have been fully appreciated. I was made an honorary\n  member of two of the smartest clubs in London when the truth came\n  out.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Well, sir, those clubs consist of snobs; and you are\n  a jumping, bounding, prancing, snorting snob yourself.\n\n  THE BISHOP [amused, but hospitably remonstrant] My dear Boxer!\n\n  HOTCHKISS [delighted] How kind of you to say so, General! Youre\n  quite right: I am a snob. Why not? The whole strength of England\n  lies in the fact that the enormous majority of the English people\n  are snobs. They insult poverty. They despise vulgarity. They love\n  nobility. They admire exclusiveness. They will not obey a man\n  risen from the ranks. They never trust one of their own class. I\n  agree with them. I share their instincts. In my undergraduate\n  days I was a Republican-a Socialist. I tried hard to feel toward\n  a common man as I do towards a duke. I couldnt. Neither can you.\n  Well, why should we be ashamed of this aspiration towards what is\n  above us? Why dont I say that an honest man's the noblest work of\n  God? Because I dont think so. If he's not a gentleman, I dont\n  care whether he's honest or not: I shouldnt let his son marry my\n  daughter. And thats the test, mind. Thats the test. You feel as I\n  do. You are a snob in fact: I am a snob, not only in fact, but on\n  principle. I shall go down in history, not as the first snob, but\n  as the first avowed champion of English snobbery, and its first\n  martyr in the army. The navy boasts two such martyrs in Captains\n  Kirby and Wade, who were shot for refusing to fight under Admiral\n  Benbow, a promoted cabin boy. I have always envied them their\n  glory.\n\n  THE GENERAL. As a British General, Sir, I have to inform you that\n  if any officer under my command violated the sacred equality of\n  our profession by putting a single jot of his duty or his risk on\n  the shoulders of the humblest drummer boy, I'd shoot him with my\n  own hand.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. That sentiment is not your equality, General, but your\n  superiority. Ask the Bishop. [He seats himself on the edge of the\n  table].\n\n  THE BISHOP. I cant support you, Sinjon. My profession also\n  compels me to turn my back on snobbery. You see, I have to do\n  such a terribly democratic thing to every child that is brought\n  to me. Without distinction of class I have to confer on it a rank\n  so high and awful that all the grades in Debrett and Burke seem\n  like the medals they give children in Infant Schools in\n  comparison. I'm not allowed to make any class distinction. They\n  are all soldiers and servants, not officers and masters.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Ah, youre quoting the Baptism service. Thats not a bit\n  real, you know. If I may say so, you would both feel so much more\n  at peace with yourselves if you would acknowledge and confess\n  your real convictions. You know you dont really think a Bishop\n  the equal of a curate, or a lieutenant in a line regiment the\n  equal of a general.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Of course I do. I was a curate myself.\n\n  THE GENERAL. And I was a lieutenant in a line regiment.\n\n  REGINALD. And I was nothing. But we're all our own and one\n  another's equals, arnt we? So perhaps when youve quite done\n  talking about yourselves, we shall get to whatever business\n  Sinjon came about.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [coming off the table hastily] my dear fellow. I beg a\n  thousand pardons. Oh! true, It's about the wedding?\n\n  THE GENERAL. What about the wedding?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Well, we cant get our man up to the scratch. Cecil has\n  locked himself in his room and wont see or speak to any one. I\n  went up to his room and banged at the door. I told him I should\n  look through the keyhole if he didnt answer. I looked through the\n  keyhole. He was sitting on his bed, reading a book. [Reginald\n  rises in consternation. The General recoils]. I told him not to\n  be an ass, and so forth. He said he was not going to budge until\n  he had finished the book. I asked him did he know what time it\n  was, and whether he happened to recollect that he had a rather\n  important appointment to marry Edith. He said the sooner I\n  stopped interrupting him, the sooner he'd be ready. Then he\n  stuffed his fingers in his ears; turned over on his elbows; and\n  buried himself in his beastly book. I couldnt get another word\n  out of him; so I thought I'd better come here and warn you.\n\n  REGINALD. This looks to me like theyve arranged it between them.\n\n  THE BISHOP. No. Edith has no sense of humor. And Ive never seen a\n  man in a jocular mood on his wedding morning.\n\n  Collins appears in the tower, ushering in the bridegroom, a young\n  gentleman with good looks of the serious kind, somewhat careworn\n  by an exacting conscience, and just now distracted by insoluble\n  problems of conduct.\n\n  COLLINS [announcing] Mr Cecil Sykes. [He retires].\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Look here, Cecil: this is all wrong. Youve no business\n  here until after the wedding. Hang it, man! youre the bridegroom.\n\n  SYKES [coming to the Bishop, and addressing him with dogged\n  desperation] Ive come here to say this. When I proposed to Edith\n  I was in utter ignorance of what I was letting myself in for\n  legally. Having given my word, I will stand to it. You have me at\n  your mercy: marry me if you insist. But take notice that I\n  protest. [He sits down distractedly in the railed chair].\n\n  THE GENERAL   {both    } What the devil do you mean by\n                {highly  } This? What the--\n  REGINALD      {incensed} Confound your impertinence,\n                               what do you--\n\n  HOTCHKISS   {  }  Easy, Rejjy. Easy, old man. Steady, steady.\n              {  }  [Reginald subsides into his chair. Hotchkiss\n              {  }  sits on his right, appeasing him.]\n  THE BISHOP  {  }  No, please, Rej. Control yourself, Boxer, I\n                    beg you.\n\n  THE GENERAL. I tell you I cant control myself. Ive been\n  controlling myself for the last half-hour until I feel like\n  bursting. [He sits down furiously at the end of the table next\n  the study].\n\n  SYKES [pointing to the simmering Reginald and the boiling\n  General] Thats just it, Bishop. Edith is her uncle's niece. She\n  cant control herself any more than they can. And she's a Bishop's\n  daughter. That means that she's engaged in social work of all\n  sorts: organizing shop assistants and sweated work girls and all\n  that. When her blood boils about it (and it boils at least once a\n  week) she doesnt care what she says.\n\n  REGINALD. Well: you knew that when you proposed to her.\n\n  SYKES. Yes; but I didnt know that when we were married I should\n  be legally responsible if she libelled anybody, though all her\n  property is protected against me as if I were the lowest thief\n  and cadger. This morning somebody sent me Belfort Bax's essays on\n  Men's Wrongs; and they have been a perfect eye-opener to me.\n  Bishop: I'm not thinking of myself: I would face anything for\n  Edith. But my mother and sisters are wholly dependent on my\n  property. I'd rather have to cut off an inch from my right arm\n  than a hundred a year from my mother's income. I owe everything\n  to her care of me. Edith, in dressing-jacket and petticoat, comes\n  in through the tower, swiftly and determinedly, pamphlet in hand,\n  principles up in arms, more of a bishop than her father, yet as\n  much a gentlewoman as her mother. She is the typical spoilt child\n  of a clerical household: almost as terrible a product as the\n  typical spoilt child of a Bohemian household: that is, all her\n  childish affectations of conscientious scruple and religious\n  impulse have been applauded and deferred to until she has become\n  an ethical snob of the first water. Her father's sense of humor\n  and her mother's placid balance have done something to save her\n  humanity; but her impetuous temper and energetic will,\n  unrestrained by any touch of humor or scepticism, carry\n  everything before them. Imperious and dogmatic, she takes command\n  of the party at once.\n\n  EDITH [standing behind Cecil's chair] Cecil: I heard your voice.\n  I must speak to you very particularly. Papa: go away. Go away\n  everybody.\n\n  THE BISHOP [crossing to the study door] I think there can be no\n  doubt that Edith wishes us to retire. Come. [He stands in the\n  doorway, waiting for them to follow].\n\n  SYKES. Thats it, you see. It's just this outspokenness that makes\n  my position hard, much as I admire her for it.\n\n  EDITH. Do you want me to flatter and be untruthful?\n\n  SYKES. No, not exactly that.\n\n  EDITH. Does anybody want me to flatter and be untruthful?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Well, since you ask me, I do. Surely it's the very\n  first qualification for tolerable social intercourse.\n\n  THE GENERAL [markedly] I hope you will always tell ME the truth,\n  my darling, at all events.\n\n  EDITH [complacently coming to the fireplace] You can depend on me\n  for that, Uncle Boxer.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Are you sure you have any adequate idea of what the\n  truth about a military man really is?\n\n  REGINALD [aggressively] Whats the truth about you, I wonder?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Oh, quite unfit for publication in its entirety. If\n  Miss Bridgenorth begins telling it, I shall have to leave the\n  room.\n\n  REGINALD. I'm not at all surprised to hear it. [Rising] But whats\n  it got to do with our business here to-day? Is it you thats going\n  to be married or is it Edith?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I'm so sorry, I get so interested in myself that I\n  thrust myself into the front of every discussion in the most\n  insufferable way. [Reginald, with an exclamation of disgust,\n  crosses the kitchen towards the study door]. But, my dear\n  Rejjy, are you quite sure that Miss Bridgenorth is going to be\n  married? Are you, Miss Bridgenorth?\n\n  Before Edith has time to answer her mother returns with Leo and\n  Lesbia.\n\n  LEO. Yes, here she is, of course. I told you I heard her dash\n  downstairs. [She comes to the end of the table next the\n  fireplace].\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [transfixed in the middle of the kitchen] And\n  Cecil!!\n\n  LESBIA. And Sinjon!\n\n  THE BISHOP. Edith wishes to speak to Cecil. [Mrs Bridgenorth\n  comes to him. Lesbia goes into the garden, as before]. Let us go\n  into my study.\n\n  LEO. But she must come and dress. Look at the hour!\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Come, Leo dear. [Leo follows her reluctantly.\n  They are about to go into the study with the Bishop].\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Do you know, Miss Bridgenorth, I should most awfully\n  like to hear what you have to say to poor Cecil.\n\n  REGINALD [scandalized] Well!\n\n  EDITH. Who is poor Cecil, pray?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. One always calls a man that on his wedding morning: I\n  dont know why. I'm his best man, you know. Dont you think it\n  gives me a certain right to be present in Cecil's interest?\n\n  THE GENERAL [gravely] There is such a thing as delicacy, Mr\n  Hotchkiss.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. There is such a thing as curiosity, General.\n\n  THE GENERAL [furious] Delicacy is thrown away here, Alfred.\n  Edith: you had better take Sykes into the study.\n\n  The group at the study door breaks up. The General flings himself\n  into the last chair on the long side of the table, near the\n  garden door. Leo sits at the end, next him, and Mrs Bridgenorth\n  next Leo. Reginald returns to the oak chest, to be near Leo; and\n  the Bishop goes to his wife and stands by her.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [to Edith] Of course I'll go if you wish me to. But\n  Cecil's objection to go through with it was so entirely on public\n  grounds--\n\n  EDITH [with quick suspicion] His objection?\n\n  SYKES. Sinjon: you have no right to say that. I expressly said\n  that I'm ready to go through with it.\n\n  EDITH. Cecil: do you mean to say that you have been raising\n  difficulties about our marriage?\n\n  SYKES. I raise no difficulty. But I do beg you to be careful what\n  you say about people. You must remember, my dear, that when we\n  are married I shall be responsible for everything you say. Only\n  last week you said on a public platform that Slattox and Chinnery\n  were scoundrels. They could have got a thousand pounds damages\n  apiece from me for that if we'd been married at the time.\n\n  EDITH [austerely] I never said anything of the sort. I never\n  stoop to mere vituperation: what would my girls say of me if I\n  did? I chose my words most carefully. I said they were tyrants,\n  liars, and thieves; and so they are. Slattox is even worse.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I'm afraid that would be at least five thousand\n  pounds.\n\n  SYKES. If it were only myself, I shouldnt care. But my mother and\n  sisters! Ive no right to sacrifice them.\n\n  EDITH. You neednt be alarmed. I'm not going to be married.\n\n  ALL THE REST. Not!\n\n  SYKES [in consternation] Edith! Are you throwing me over?\n\n  EDITH. How can I? you have been beforehand with me.\n\n  SYKES. On my honor, no. All I said was that I didnt know the law\n  when I asked you to be my wife.\n\n  EDITH. And you wouldnt have asked me if you had. Is that it?\n\n  SYKES. No. I should have asked you for my sake be a little more\n  careful--not to ruin me uselessly.\n\n  EDITH. You think the truth useless?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Much worse than useless, I assure you. Frequently most\n  mischievous.\n\n  EDITH. Sinjon: hold your tongue. You are a chatterbox and a fool!\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH }  [shocked] { Edith!\n  THE BISHOP      }            { My love!\n\n  HOTCHKISS [mildly] I shall not take an action, Cecil.\n\n  EDITH [to Hotchkiss] Sorry; but you are old enough to know\n  better. [To the others] And now since there is to be no wedding,\n  we had better get back to our work. Mamma: will you tell Collins\n  to cut up the wedding cake into thirty-three pieces for the club\n  girls? My not being married is no reason why they should be\n  disappointed. [She turns to go].\n\n  HOTCHKISS [gallantly] If youll allow me to take Cecil's place,\n  Miss Bridgenorth--\n\n  LEO. Sinjon!\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Oh, I forgot. I beg your pardon. [To Edith,\n  apologetically] A prior engagement.\n\n  EDITH. What! You and Leo! I thought so. Well, hadnt you two\n  better get married at once? I dont approve of long engagements.\n  The breakfast's ready: the cake's ready: everything's ready. I'll\n  lend Leo my veil and things.\n\n  THE BISHOP. I'm afraid they must wait until the decree is made\n  absolute, my dear. And the license is not transferable.\n\n  EDITH. Oh well, it cant be helped. Is there anything else before\n  I go off to the Club?\n\n  SYKES. You dont seem much disappointed, Edith. I cant help saying\n  that much.\n\n  EDITH. And you cant help looking enormously relieved, Cecil. We\n  shant be any worse friends, shall we?\n\n  SYKES [distractedly] Of course not. Still--I'm perfectly ready--\n  at least--if it were not for my mother--Oh, I dont know what to\n  do. Ive been so fond of you; and when the worry of the wedding\n  was over I should have been so fond of you again--\n\n  EDITH [petting him] Come, come! dont make a scene, dear. Youre\n  quite right. I dont think a woman doing public work ought to get\n  married unless her husband feels about it as she does. I dont\n  blame you at all for throwing me over.\n\n  REGINALD [bouncing off the chest, and passing behind the General\n  to the other end of the table] No: dash it! I'm not going to\n  stand this. Why is the man always to be put in the wrong? Be\n  honest, Edith. Why werent you dressed? Were you going to throw\n  him over? If you were, take your fair share of the blame; and\n  dont put it all on him.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [sweetly] Would it not be better--\n\n  REGINALD [violently] Now look here, Hotchkiss. Who asked you to\n  cut in? Is your name Edith? Am I your uncle?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I wish you were: I should like to have an uncle,\n  Reginald.\n\n  REGINALD. Yah! Sykes: are you ready to marry Edith or are you\n  not?\n\n  SYKES. Ive already said that I'm quite ready. A promise is a\n  promise.\n\n  REGINALD. We dont want to know whether a promise is a promise or\n  not. Cant you answer yes or no without spoiling it and setting\n  Hotchkiss here grinning like a Cheshire cat? If she puts on her\n  veil and goes to Church, will you marry her?\n\n  SYKES. Certainly. Yes.\n\n  REGINALD. Thats all right. Now, Edie, put on your veil and off\n  with you to the church. The bridegroom's waiting. [He sits down\n  at the table].\n\n  EDITH. Is it understood that Slattox and Chinnery are liars and\n  thieves, and that I hope by next Wednesday to have in my hands\n  conclusive evidence that Slattox is something much worse?\n\n  SYKES. I made no conditions as to that when I proposed to you;\n  and now I cant go back. I hope Providence will spare my poor\n  mother. I say again I'm ready to marry you.\n\n  EDITH. Then I think you shew great weakness of character; and\n  instead of taking advantage of it I shall set you a better\n  example. I want to know is this true. [She produces a pamphlet\n  and takes it to the Bishop; then sits down between Hotchkiss and\n  her mother].\n\n  THE BISHOP [reading the title] Do YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO\n  DO? BY A WOMAN WHO HAS DONE IT. May I ask, my dear, what she did?\n\n  EDITH. She got married. When she had three children--the eldest\n  only four years old--her husband committed a murder, and then\n  attempted to commit suicide, but only succeeded in disfiguring\n  himself. Instead of hanging him, they sent him to penal servitude\n  for life, for the sake, they said, of his wife and infant\n  children. And she could not get a divorce from that horrible\n  murderer. They would not even keep him imprisoned for life. For\n  twenty years she had to live singly, bringing up her children by\n  her own work, and knowing that just when they were grown up and\n  beginning life, this dreadful creature would be let out to\n  disgrace them all, and prevent the two girls getting decently\n  married, and drive the son out of the country perhaps. Is that\n  really the law? Am I to understand that if Cecil commits a mur-\n  der, or forges, or steals, or becomes an atheist, I cant get\n  divorced from him?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Yes, my dear. That is so. You must take him for\n  better for worse.\n\n  EDITH. Then I most certainly refuse to enter into any such wicked\n  contract. What sort of servants? what sort of friends? what sort\n  of Prime Ministers should we have if we took them for better for\n  worse for all their lives? We should simply encourage them in\n  every sort of wickedness. Surely my husband's conduct is of more\n  importance to me than Mr Balfour's or Mr Asquith's. If I had\n  known the law I would never have consented. I dont believe any\n  woman would if she realized what she was doing.\n\n  SYKES. But I'm not going to commit murder.\n\n  EDITH. How do you know? Ive sometimes wanted to murder Slattox.\n  Have you never wanted to murder somebody, Uncle Rejjy?\n\n  REGINALD [at Hotchkiss, with intense expression] Yes.\n\n  LEO. Rejjy!\n\n  REGINALD. I said yes; and I mean yes. There was one night,\n  Hotchkiss, when I jolly near shot you and Leo and finished up\n  with myself; and thats the truth.\n\n  LEO [suddenly whimpering] Oh Rejjy [she runs to him and kisses\n  him].\n\n  REGINALD [wrathfully] Be off. [She returns weeping to her seat].\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [petting Leo, but speaking to the company at\n  large] But isnt all this great nonsense? What likelihood is there\n  of any of us committing a crime?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Oh yes, I assure you. I went into the matter once very\n  carefully; and I found things I have actually done--things that\n  everybody does, I imagine--would expose me, if I were found out\n  and prosecuted, to ten years' penal servitude, two years hard\n  labor, and the loss of all civil rights. Not counting that I'm a\n  private trustee, and, like all private trustees, a fraudulent\n  one. Otherwise, the widow for whom I am trustee would starve\n  occasionally, and the children get no education. And I'm probably\n  as honest a man as any here.\n\n  THE GENERAL [outraged] Do you imply that I have been guilty of\n  conduct that would expose me to penal servitude?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I should think it quite likely, but of course I dont\n  know.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. But bless me! marriage is not a question of law,\n  is it? Have you children no affection for one another? Surely\n  thats enough?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. If it's enough, why get married?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Stuff, Sinjon! Of course people must get\n  married. [Uneasily] Alfred: why dont you say something? Surely\n  youre not going to let this go on.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Ive been waiting for the last twenty minutes,\n  Alfred, in amazement! in stupefaction! to hear you put a stop to\n  all this. We look to you: it's your place, your office, your\n  duty. Exert your authority at once.\n\n  THE BISHOP. You must give the devil fair play, Boxer. Until you\n  have heard and weighed his case you have no right to condemn him.\n  I'm sorry you have been kept waiting twenty minutes; but I myself\n  have waited twenty years for this to happen. Ive often wrestled\n  with the temptation to pray that it might not happen in my own\n  household. Perhaps it was a presentiment that it might become a\n  part of our old Bridgenorth burden that made me warn our\n  Governments so earnestly that unless the law of marriage were\n  first made human, it could never become divine.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Oh, do be sensible about this. People must get\n  married. What would you have said if Cecil's parents had not been\n  married?\n\n  THE BISHOP. They were not, my dear.\n\n  HOTCHKISS        } { Hallo!\n  REGINALD         } { What d'ye mean?\n  THE GENERAL      } { Eh?\n  LEO              } { Not married!\n  MRS. BRIDGENORTH } { What?\n\n  SYKES [rising in amazement] What on earth do you mean, Bishop? My\n  parents were married.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. You cant remember, Cecil.\n\n  SYKES. Well, I never asked my mother to shew me her marriage\n  lines, if thats what you mean. What man ever has? I never\n  suspected--I never knew--Are you joking? Or have we all gone mad?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Dont be alarmed, Cecil. Let me explain. Your parents\n  were not Anglicans. You were not, I think, Anglican yourself,\n  until your second year at Oxford. They were Positivists. They\n  went through the Positivist ceremony at Newton Hall in Fetter\n  Lane after entering into the civil contract before the Registrar\n  of the West Strand District. I ask you, as an Anglican Catholic,\n  was that a marriage?\n\n  SYKES [overwhelmed] Great Heavens, no! a thousand times, no. I\n  never thought of that. I'm a child of sin. [He collapses into the\n  railed chair].\n\n  THE BISHOP. Oh, come, come! You are no more a child of sin than\n  any Jew, or Mohammedan, or Nonconformist, or anyone else born\n  outside the Church. But you see how it affects my view of the\n  situation. To me there is only one marriage that is holy: the\n  Church's sacrament of marriage. Outside that, I can recognize no\n  distinction between one civil contract and another. There was a\n  time when all marriages were made in Heaven. But because the\n  Church was unwise and would not make its ordinances reasonable,\n  its power over men and women was taken away from it; and\n  marriages gave place to contracts at a registry office. And now\n  that our Governments refuse to make these contracts reasonable,\n  those whom we in our blindness drove out of the Church will be\n  driven out of the registry office; and we shall have the history\n  of Ancient Rome repeated. We shall be joined by our solicitors\n  for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years--or perhaps months.\n  Deeds of partnership will replace the old vows.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Would you, a Bishop, approve of such partnerships?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Do you think that I, a Bishop, approve of the\n  Deceased Wife's Sister Act? That did not prevent its becoming\n  law.\n\n  THE GENERAL. But when the Government sounded you as to whether\n  youd marry a man to his deceased wife's sister you very naturally\n  and properly told them youd see them damned first.\n\n  THE BISHOP [horrified] No, no, really, Boxer! You must not--\n\n  THE GENERAL [impatiently] Oh, of course I dont mean that you used\n  those words. But that was the meaning and the spirit of it.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Not the spirit, Boxer, I protest. But never mind\n  that. The point is that State marriage is already divorced from\n  Church marriage. The relations between Leo and Rejjy and Sinjon\n  are perfectly legal; but do you expect me, as a Bishop, to\n  approve of them?\n\n  THE GENERAL. I dont defend Reginald. He should have kicked you\n  out of the house, Mr. Hotchkiss.\n\n  REGINALD [rising] How could I kick him out of the house? He's\n  stronger than me: he could have kicked me out if it came to that.\n  He did kick me out: what else was it but kicking out, to take my\n  wife's affections from me and establish himself in my place? [He\n  comes to the hearth].\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I protest, Reginald, I said all that a man could to\n  prevent the smash.\n\n  REGINALD. Oh, I know you did: I dont blame you: people dont do\n  these things to one another: they happen and they cant be helped.\n  What was I to do? I was old: she was young. I was dull: he was\n  brilliant. I had a face like a walnut: he had a face like a\n  mushroom. I was as glad to have him in the house as she was: he\n  amused me. And we were a couple of fools: he gave us good advice\n  --told us what to do when we didnt know. She found out that I\n  wasnt any use to her and he was; so she nabbed him and gave me\n  the chuck.\n\n  LEO. If you dont stop talking in that disgraceful way about our\n  married life, I'll leave the room and never speak to you again.\n\n  REGINALD. Youre not going to speak to me again, anyhow, are you?\n  Do you suppose I'm going to visit you when you marry him?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I hope so. Surely youre not going to be vindictive,\n  Rejjy. Besides, youll have all the advantages I formerly enjoyed.\n  Youll be the visitor, the relief, the new face, the fresh news,\n  the hopeless attachment: I shall only be the husband.\n\n  REGINALD [savagely] Will you tell me this, any of you? how is it\n  that we always get talking about Hotchkiss when our business is\n  about Edith? [He fumes up the kitchen to the tower and back to\n  his chair].\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Will somebody tell me how the world is to go on\n  if nobody is to get married?\n\n  SYKES. Will somebody tell me what an honorable man and a sincere\n  Anglican is to propose to a woman whom he loves and who loves him\n  and wont marry him?\n\n  LEO. Will somebody tell me how I'm to arrange to take care of\n  Rejjy when I'm married to Sinjon. Rejjy must not be allowed to\n  marry anyone else, especially that odious nasty creature that\n  told all those wicked lies about him in Court.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Let us draw up the first English partnership deed.\n\n  LEO. For shame, Sinjon!\n\n  THE BISHOP. Somebody must begin, my dear. Ive a very strong\n  suspicion that when it is drawn up it will be so much worse than\n  the existing law that you will all prefer getting married. We\n  shall therefore be doing the greatest possible service to\n  morality by just trying how the new system would work.\n\n  LESBIA [suddenly reminding them of her forgotten presence as she\n  stands thoughtfully in the garden doorway] Ive been thinking.\n\n  THE BISHOP [to Hotchkiss] Nothing like making people think: is\n  there, Sinjon?\n\n  LESBIA [coming to the table, on the General's left] A woman has\n  no right to refuse motherhood. That is clear, after the\n  statistics given in The Times by Mr Sidney Webb.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Mr Webb has nothing to do with it. It is the Voice\n  of Nature.\n\n  LESBIA. But if she is an English lady it is her right and her\n  duty to stand out for honorable conditions. If we can agree on\n  the conditions, I am willing to enter into an alliance with\n  Boxer.\n\n  The General staggers to his feet, momentarily stupent and\n  speechless.\n\n  EDITH [rising] And I with Cecil.\n\n  LEO [rising] And I with Rejjy and St John.\n\n  THE GENERAL [aghast] An alliance! Do you mean a--a--a--\n\n  REGINALD. She only means bigamy, as I understand her.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Alfred: how long more are you going to stand there\n  and countenance this lunacy? Is it a horrible dream or am I\n  awake? In the name of common sense and sanity, let us go back to\n  real life--\n\n  Collins comes in through the tower, in alderman's robes. The\n  ladies who are standing sit down hastily, and look as unconcerned\n  as possible.\n\n  COLLINS. Sorry to hurry you, my lord; but the Church has been\n  full this hour past; and the organist has played all the wedding\n  music in Lohengrin three times over.\n\n  THE GENERAL. The very man we want. Alfred: I'm not equal to this\n  crisis. You are not equal to it. The Army has failed. The Church\n  has failed. I shall put aside all idle social distinctions and\n  appeal to the Municipality.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Do, Boxer. He is sure to get us out of this\n  difficulty.\n\n  Collins, a little puzzled, comes forward affably to Hotchkiss's\n  left.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [rising, impressed by the aldermanic gown] Ive not had\n  the pleasure. Will you introduce me?\n\n  COLLINS [confidentially] All right, sir. Only the greengrocer,\n  sir, in charge of the wedding breakfast. Mr Alderman Collins,\n  sir, when I'm in my gown.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [staggered] Very pleased indeed [he sits down again].\n\n  THE BISHOP. Personally I value the counsel of my old friend, Mr\n  Alderman Collins, very highly. If Edith and Cecil will allow him--\n\n  EDITH. Collins has known me from my childhood: I'm sure he will\n  agree with me.\n\n  COLLINS. Yes, miss: you may depend on me for that. Might I ask\n  what the difficulty is?\n\n  EDITH. Simply this. Do you expect me to get married in the\n  existing state of the law?\n\n  SYKES [rising and coming to Collin's left elbow] I put it to you\n  as a sensible man: is it any worse for her than for me?\n\n  REGINALD [leaving his place and thrusting himself between Collins\n  and Sykes, who returns to his chair] Thats not the point. Let\n  this be understood, Mr Collins. It's not the man who is backing\n  out: it's the woman. [He posts himself on the hearth].\n\n  LESBIA. We do not admit that, Collins. The women are perfectly\n  ready to make a reasonable arrangement.\n\n  LEO. With both men.\n\n  THE GENERAL. The case is now before you, Mr Collins. And I put it\n  to you as one man to another: did you ever hear such crazy\n  nonsense?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. The world must go on, mustnt it, Collins?\n\n  COLLINS [snatching at this, the first intelligible proposition he\n  has heard] Oh, the world will go on, maam dont you be afraid of\n  that. It aint so easy to stop it as the earnest kind of people\n  think.\n\n  EDITH. I knew you would agree with me, Collins. Thank you.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Have you the least idea of what they are talking\n  about, Mr Alderman?\n\n  COLLINS. Oh, thats all right, Sir. The particulars dont matter. I\n  never read the report of a Committee: after all, what can they\n  say, that you dont know? You pick it up as they go on talking.[He\n  goes to the corner of the table and speaks across it to the\n  company]. Well, my Lord and Miss Edith and Madam and Gentlemen,\n  it's like this. Marriage is tolerable enough in its way if youre\n  easygoing and dont expect too much from it. But it doesnt bear\n  thinking about. The great thing is to get the young people tied\n  up before they know what theyre letting themselves in for. Theres\n  Miss Lesbia now. She waited till she started thinking about it;\n  and then it was all over. If you once start arguing, Miss Edith\n  and Mr Sykes, youll never get married. Go and get married first:\n  youll have plenty of arguing afterwards, miss, believe me.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Your warning comes too late. Theyve started arguing\n  already.\n\n  THE GENERAL. But you dont take in the full--well, I dont wish to\n  exaggerate; but the only word I can find is the full horror of\n  the situation. These ladies not only refuse our honorable\n  offers, but as I understand it--and I'm sure I beg your pardon\n  most heartily, Lesbia, if I'm wrong, as I hope I am--they\n  actually call on us to enter into--I'm sorry to use the\n  expression; but what can I say?--into ALLIANCES with them under\n  contracts to be drawn up by our confounded solicitors.\n\n  COLLINS. Dear me, General: thats something new when the parties\n  belong to the same class.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Not new, Collins. The Romans did it.\n\n  COLLINS. Yes: they would, them Romans. When youre in Rome do as\n  the Romans do, is an old saying. But we're not in Rome at\n  present, my lord.\n\n  THE BISHOP. We have got into many of their ways. What do you\n  think of the contract system, Collins?\n\n  COLLINS. Well, my lord, when theres a question of a contract, I\n  always say, shew it to me on paper. If it's to be talk, let it be\n  talk; but if it's to be a contract, down with it in black and\n  white; and then we shall know what we're about.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Quite right, Mr Alderman. Let us draft it at once. May\n  I go into the study for writing materials, Bishop?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Do, Sinjon.\n\n  Hotchkiss goes into the library.\n\n  COLLINS. If I might point out a difficulty, my lord--\n\n  THE BISHOP. Certainly. [He goes to the fourth chair from the\n  General's left, but before sitting down, courteously points to\n  the chair at the end of the table next the hearth]. Wont you sit\n  down, Mr Alderman? [Collins, very appreciative of the Bishop's\n  distinguished consideration, sits down. The Bishop then takes his\n  seat].\n\n  COLLINS. We are at present six men to four ladies. Thats not\n  fair.\n\n  REGINALD. Not fair to the men, you mean.\n\n  LEO. Oh! Rejjy has said something clever! Can I be mistaken in\n  him?\n\n  Hotchkiss comes back with a blotter and some paper. He takes the\n  vacant place in the middle of the table between Lesbia and the\n  Bishop.\n\n  COLLINS. I tell you the truth, my lord and ladies and gentlemen:\n  I dont trust my judgment on this subject. Theres a certain lady\n  that I always consult on delicate points like this. She has a\n  very exceptional experience, and a wonderful temperament and\n  instinct in affairs of the heart.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Excuse me, Mr Alderman: I'm a snob; and I warn you\n  that theres no use consulting anyone who will not advise us\n  frankly on class lines. Marriage is good enough for the lower\n  classes: they have facilities for desertion that are denied to\n  us. What is the social position of this lady?\n\n  COLLINS. The highest in the borough, sir. She is the Mayoress.\n  But you need not stand in awe of her, sir. She is my sister-in-\n  law. [To the Bishop] Ive often spoken of her to your lady, my\n  lord. [To Mrs Bridgenorth] Mrs George, maam.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [startled] Do you mean to say, Collins, that Mrs\n  George is a real person?\n\n  COLLINS [equally startled] Didnt you believe in her, maam?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Never for a moment.\n\n  THE BISHOP. We always thought that Mrs George was too good to be\n  true. I still dont believe in her, Collins. You must produce her\n  if you are to convince me.\n\n  COLLINS [overwhelmed] Well, I'm so taken aback by this that--Well\n  I never!!! Why! shes at the church at this moment, waiting to see\n  the wedding.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Then produce her. [Collins shakes his head].Come,\n  Collins! confess. Theres no such person.\n\n  COLLINS. There is, my lord: there is, I assure you. You ask\n  George. It's true I cant produce her; but you can, my lord.\n\n  THE BISHOP. I!\n\n  COLLINS. Yes, my lord, you. For some reason that I never could\n  make out, she has forbidden me to talk about you, or to let her\n  meet you. Ive asked her to come here of a wedding morning to help\n  with the flowers or the like; and she has always refused. But if\n  you order her to come as her Bishop, she'll come. She has some\n  very strange fancies, has Mrs George. Send your ring to her, my\n  lord--he official ring--send it by some very stylish gentleman--\n  perhaps Mr Hotchkiss here would be good enough to take it--and\n  she'll come.\n\n  THE BISHOP [taking off his ring and handing it to Hotchkiss]\n  Oblige me by undertaking the mission.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. But how am I to know the lady?\n\n  COLLINS. She has gone to the church in state, sir, and will be\n  attended by a Beadle with a mace. He will point her out to you;\n  and he will take the front seat of the carriage on the way back.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. No, by heavens! Forgive me, Bishop; but you are asking\n  too much. I ran away from the Boers because I was a snob. I run\n  away from the Beadle for the same reason. I absolutely decline\n  the mission.\n\n  THE GENERAL [rising impressively] Be good enough to give me that\n  ring, Mr Hotchkiss.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. With pleasure. [He hands it to him].\n\n  THE GENERAL. I shall have the great pleasure, Mr Alderman, in\n  waiting on the Mayoress with the Bishop's orders; and I shall be\n  proud to return with municipal honors. [He stalks out gallantly,\n  Collins rising for a moment to bow to him with marked dignity].\n\n  REGINALD. Boxer is rather a fine old josser in his way.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. His uniform gives him an unfair advantage. He will\n  take all the attention off the Beadle.\n\n  COLLINS. I think it would be as well, my lord, to go on with the\n  contract while we're waiting. The truth is, we shall none of us\n  have much of a look-in when Mrs George comes; so we had better\n  finish the writing part of the business before she arrives.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I think I have the preliminaries down all right.\n  [Reading] 'Memorandum of Agreement made this day of blank blank\n  between blank blank of blank blank in the County of blank,\n  Esquire, hereinafter called the Gentleman, of the one part, and\n  blank blank of blank in the County of blank, hereinafter called\n  the Lady, of the other part, whereby it is declared and agreed as\n  follows.'\n\n  LEO [rising] You might remember your manners, Sinjon. The lady\n  comes first. [She goes behind him and stoops to look at the draft\n  over his shoulder].\n\n  HOTCHKISS. To be sure. I beg your pardon. [He alters the draft].\n\n  LEO. And you have got only one lady and one gentleman. There\n  ought to be two gentlemen.\n\n  COLLINS. Oh, thats a mere matter of form, maam. Any number of\n  ladies or gentlemen can be put in.\n\n  LEO. Not any number of ladies. Only one lady. Besides, that\n  creature wasnt a lady.\n\n  REGINALD. You shut your head, Leo. This is a general sort of\n  contract for everybody: it's not your tract.\n\n  LEO. Then what use is it to me?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. You will get some hints from it for your own contract.\n\n  EDITH. I hope there will be no hinting. Let us have the plain\n  straightforward truth and nothing but the truth.\n\n  COLLINS. Yes, yes, miss: it will be all right. Theres nothing\n  underhand, I assure you. It's a model agreement, as it were.\n\n  EDITH [unconvinced] I hope so.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. What is the first clause in an agreement, usually? You\n  know, Mr Alderman.\n\n  COLLINS [at a loss] Well, Sir, the Town Clerk always sees to\n  that. Ive got out of the habit of thinking for myself in these\n  little matters. Perhaps his lordship knows.\n\n  THE BISHOP. I'm sorry to say I dont. Soames will know. Alice,\n  where is Soames?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. He's in there [pointing to the study].\n\n  THE BISHOP [to his wife] Coax him to join us, my love. [Mrs\n  Bridgenorth goes into the study]. Soames is my chaplain, Mr\n  Collins. The great difficulty about Bishops in the Church of\n  England to-day is that the affairs of the diocese make it\n  necessary that a Bishop should be before everything a man of\n  business, capable of sticking to his desk for sixteen hours a\n  day. But the result of having Bishops of this sort is that the\n  spiritual interests of the Church, and its influence on the souls\n  and imaginations of the people, very soon begins to go rapidly to\n  the devil--\n\n  EDITH [shocked] Papa!\n\n  THE BISHOP. I am speaking technically, not in Boxer's manner.\n  Indeed the Bishops themselves went so far in that direction that\n  they gained a reputation for being spiritually the stupidest men\n  in the country and commercially the sharpest. I found a way out\n  of this difficulty. Soames was my solicitor. I found that Soames,\n  though a very capable man of business, had a romantic secret his-\n  tory. His father was an eminent Nonconformist divine who\n  habitually spoke of the Church of England as The Scarlet Woman.\n  Soames became secretly converted to Anglicanism at the age of\n  fifteen. He longed to take holy orders, but didnt dare to,\n  because his father had a weak heart and habitually threatened to\n  drop dead if anybody hurt his feelings. You may have noticed that\n  people with weak hearts are the tyrants of English family life.\n  So poor Soames had to become a solicitor. When his father died--\n  by a curious stroke of poetic justice he died of scarlet fever,\n  and was found to have had a perfectly sound heart--I ordained\n  Soames and made him my chaplain. He is now quite happy. He is a\n  celibate; fasts strictly on Fridays and throughout Lent; wears a\n  cassock and biretta; and has more legal business to do than ever\n  he had in his old office in Ely Place. And he sets me free for\n  the spiritual and scholarly pursuits proper to a Bishop.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [coming back from the study with a knitting\n  basket] Here he is. [She resumes her seat, and knits].\n  Soames comes in in cassock and biretta. He salutes the company by\n  blessing them with two fingers.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Take my place, Mr Soames. [He gives up his chair to\n  him, and retires to the oak chest, on which he seats himself].\n\n  THE BISHOP. No longer Mr Soames, Sinjon. Father Anthony.\n\n  SOAMES [taking his seat] I was christened Oliver Cromwell Soames.\n  My father had no right to do it. I have taken the name of\n  Anthony. When you become parents, young gentlemen, be very\n  careful not to label a helpless child with views which it may\n  come to hold in abhorrence.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Has Alice explained to you the nature of the document\n  we are drafting?\n\n  SOAMES. She has indeed.\n\n  LESBIA. That sounds as if you disapproved.\n\n  SOAMES. It is not for me to approve or disapprove. I do the work\n  that comes to my hand from my ecclesiastical superior.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Dont be uncharitable, Anthony. You must give us your\n  best advice.\n\n  SOAMES. My advice to you all is to do your duty by taking the\n  Christian vows of celibacy and poverty. The Church was founded\n  to put an end to marriage and to put an end to property.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. But how could the world go on, Anthony?\n\n  SOAMES. Do your duty and see. Doing your duty is your business:\n  keeping the world going is in higher hands.\n\n  LESBIA. Anthony: youre impossible.\n\n  SOAMES [taking up his pen] You wont take my advice. I didnt\n  expect you would. Well, I await your instructions.\n\n  REGINALD. We got stuck on the first clause. What should we begin\n  with?\n\n  SOAMES. It is usual to begin with the term of the contract.\n\n  EDITH. What does that mean?\n\n  SOAMES. The term of years for which it is to hold good.\n\n  LEO. But this is a marriage contract.\n\n  SOAMES. Is the marriage to be for a year, a week, or a day?\n\n  REGINALD. Come, I say, Anthony! Youre worse than any of us. A\n  day!\n\n  SOAMES. Off the path is off the path. An inch or a mile: what\n  does it matter?\n\n  LEO. If the marriage is not to be for ever, I'll have nothing to\n  do with it. I call it immoral to have a marriage for a term of\n  years. If the people dont like it they can get divorced.\n\n  REGINALD. It ought to be for just as long as the two people like.\n  Thats what I say.\n\n  COLLINS. They may not agree on the point, sir. It's often fast\n  with one and loose with the other.\n\n  LESBIA. I should say for as long as the man behaves himself.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Suppose the woman doesnt behave herself?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. The woman may have lost all her chances of a\n  good marriage with anybody else. She should not be cast adrift.\n\n  REGINALD. So may the man! What about his home?\n\n  LEO. The wife ought to keep an eye on him, and see that he is\n  comfortable and takes care of himself properly. The other man\n  wont want her all the time.\n\n  LESBIA. There may not be another man.\n\n  LEO. Then why on earth should she leave him?\n\n  LESBIA. Because she wants to.\n\n  LEO. Oh, if people are going to be let do what they want to,\n  then I call it simple immorality. [She goes indignantly to the\n  oak chest, and perches herself on it close beside Hotchkiss].\n\n  REGINALD [watching them sourly] You do it yourself, dont you?\n\n  LEO. Oh, thats quite different. Dont make foolish witticisms,\n  Rejjy.\n\n  THE BISHOP. We dont seem to be getting on. What do you say, Mr\n  Alderman?\n\n  COLLINS. Well, my lord, you see people do persist in talking as\n  if marriages was all of one sort. But theres almost as many\n  different sorts of marriages as theres different sorts of people.\n  Theres the young things that marry for love, not knowing what\n  theyre doing, and the old things that marry for money and comfort\n  and companionship. Theres the people that marry for children.\n  Theres the people that dont intend to have children and that arnt\n  fit to have them. Theres the people that marry because theyre so\n  much run after by the other sex that they have to put a stop to\n  it somehow. Theres the people that want to try a new experience,\n  and the people that want to have done with experiences. How are\n  you to please them all? Why, youll want half a dozen different\n  sorts of contract.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Well, if so, let us draw them all up. Let us face it.\n\n  REGINALD. Why should we be held together whether we like it or\n  not? Thats the question thats at the bottom of it all.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Because of the children, Rejjy.\n\n  COLLINS. But even then, maam, why should we be held together when\n  thats all over--when the girls are married and the boys out in\n  the world and in business for themselves? When thats done with,\n  the real work of the marriage is done with. If the two like to\n  stay together, let them stay together. But if not, let them part,\n  as old people in the workhouses do. Theyve had enough of one\n  another. Theyve found one another out. Why should they be tied\n  together to sit there grudging and hating and spiting one another\n  like so many do? Put it twenty years from the birth of the\n  youngest child.\n\n  SOAMES. How if there be no children?\n\n  COLLINS. Let em take one another on liking.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Collins!\n\n  LEO. You wicked old man--\n\n  THE BISHOP [remonstrating] My dear, my dear!\n\n  LESBIA. And what is a woman to live on, pray, when she is no\n  longer liked, as you call it?\n\n  SOAMES [with sardonic formality] It is proposed that the term of\n  the agreement be twenty years from the birth of the youngest\n  child when there are children. Any amendment?\n\n  LEO. I protest. It must be for life. It would not be a marriage\n  at all if it were not for life.\n\n  SOAMES. Mrs Reginald Bridgenorth proposes life. Any seconder?\n\n  LEO. Dont be soulless, Anthony.\n\n  LESBIA. I have a very important amendment. If there are any\n  children, the man must be cleared completely out of the house for\n  two years on each occasion. At such times he is superfluous,\n  importunate, and ridiculous.\n\n  COLLINS. But where is he to go, miss?\n\n  LESBIA. He can go where he likes as long as he does not bother\n  the mother.\n\n  REGINALD. And is she to be left lonely--\n\n  LESBIA. Lonely! With her child. The poor woman would be only too\n  glad to have a moment to herself. Dont be absurd, Rejjy.\n\n  REGINALD. That father is to be a wandering wretched outcast,\n  living at his club, and seeing nobody but his friends' wives!\n\n  LESBIA [ironically] Poor fellow!\n\n  HOTCHKISS. The friends' wives are perhaps the solution of the\n  problem. You see, their husbands will also be outcasts; and the\n  poor ladies will occasionally pine for male society.\n\n  LESBIA. There is no reason why a mother should not have male\n  society. What she clearly should not have is a husband.\n\n  SOAMES. Anything else, Miss Grantham?\n\n  LESBIA. Yes: I must have my own separate house, or my own\n  separate part of a house. Boxer smokes: I cant endure tobacco.\n  Boxer believes that an open window means death from cold and\n  exposure to the night air: I must have fresh air always. We can\n  be friends; but we cant live together; and that must be put in\n  the agreement.\n\n  EDITH. Ive no objection to smoking; and as to opening the\n  windows, Cecil will of course have to do what is best for his\n  health.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Who is to be the judge of that, my dear? You or he?\n\n  EDITH. Neither of us. We must do what the doctor orders.\n\n  REGINALD. Doctor be--!\n\n  LEO [admonitorily] Rejjy!\n\n  REGINALD [to Soames] You take my tip, Anthony. Put a clause into\n  that agreement that the doctor is to have no say in the job. It's\n  bad enough for the two people to be married to one another\n  without their both being married to the doctor as well.\n\n  LESBIA. That reminds me of something very important. Boxer\n  believes in vaccination: I do not. There must be a clause that I\n  am to decide on such questions as I think best.\n\n  LEO [to the Bishop] Baptism is nearly as important as\n  vaccination: isnt it?\n\n  THE BISHOP. It used to be considered so, my dear.\n\n  LEO. Well, Sinjon scoffs at it: he says that godfathers are\n  ridiculous. I must be allowed to decide.\n\n  REGINALD. Theyll be his children as well as yours, you know.\n\n  LEO. Dont be indelicate, Rejjy.\n\n  EDITH. You are forgetting the very important matter of money.\n\n  COLLINS. Ah! Money! Now we're coming to it!\n\n  EDITH. When I'm married I shall have practically no money except\n  what I shall earn.\n\n  THE BISHOP. I'm sorry, Cecil. A Bishop's daughter is a poor man's\n  daughter.\n\n  SYKES. But surely you dont imagine that I'm going to let Edith\n  work when we're married. I'm not a rich man; but Ive enough to\n  spare her that; and when my mother dies--\n\n  EDITH. What nonsense! Of course I shall work when I'm married. I\n  shall keep your house.\n\n  SYKES. Oh, that!\n\n  REGINALD. You call that work?\n\n  EDITH. Dont you? Leo used to do it for nothing; so no doubt you\n  thought it wasnt work at all. Does your present housekeeper do it\n  for nothing?\n\n  REGINALD. But it will be part of your duty as a wife.\n\n  EDITH. Not under this contract. I'll not have it so. If I'm to\n  keep the house, I shall expect Cecil to pay me at least as well\n  as he would pay a hired housekeeper. I'll not go begging to him\n  every time I want a new dress or a cab fare, as so many women\n  have to do.\n\n  SYKES. You know very well I would grudge you nothing, Edie.\n\n  EDITH. Then dont grudge me my self-respect and independence. I\n  insist on it in fairness to you, Cecil, because in this way there\n  will be a fund belonging solely to me; and if Slattox takes an\n  action against you for anything I say, you can pay the damages\n  and stop the interest out of my salary.\n\n  SOAMES. You forget that under this contract he will not be\n  liable, because you will not be his wife in law.\n\n  EDITH. Nonsense! Of course I shall be his wife.\n\n  COLLINS [his curiosity roused] Is Slattox taking an action\n  against you, miss? Slattox is on the Council with me. Could I\n  settle it?\n\n  EDITH. He has not taken an action; but Cecil says he will.\n\n  COLLINS. What for, miss, if I may ask?\n\n  EDITH. Slattox is a liar and a thief; and it is my duty to expose\n  him.\n\n  COLLINS. You surprise me, miss. Of course Slattox is in a manner\n  of speaking a liar. If I may say so without offence, we're all\n  liars, if it was only to spare one another's feelings. But I\n  shouldnt call Slattox a thief. He's not all that he should be,\n  perhaps; but he pays his way.\n\n  EDITH. If that is only your nice way of saying that Slattox is\n  entirely unfit to have two hundred girls in his power as absolute\n  slaves, then I shall say that too about him at the very next\n  public meeting I address. He steals their wages under pretence of\n  fining them. He steals their food under pretence of buying it for\n  them. He lies when he denies having done it. And he does other\n  things, as you evidently know, Collins. Therefore I give you\n  notice that I shall expose him before all England without the\n  least regard to the consequences to myself.\n\n  SYKES. Or to me?\n\n  EDITH. I take equal risks. Suppose you felt it to be your duty to\n  shoot Slattox, what would become of me and the children? I'm sure\n  I dont want anybody to be shot: not even Slattox; but if the\n  public never will take any notice of even the most crying evil\n  until somebody is shot, what are people to do but shoot somebody?\n\n  SOAMES [inexorably] I'm waiting for my instructions as to the\n  term of the agreement.\n\n  REGINALD [impatiently, leaving the hearth and going behind\n  Soames] It's no good talking all over the shop like this. We\n  shall be here all day. I propose that the agreement holds good\n  until the parties are divorced.\n\n  SOAMES. They cant be divorced. They will not be married.\n\n  REGINALD. But if they cant be divorced, then this will be worse\n  than marriage.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Of course it will. Do stop this nonsense. Why,\n  who are the children to belong to?\n\n  LESBIA. We have already settled that they are to belong to the\n  mother.\n\n  REGINALD. No: I'm dashed if you have. I'll fight for the\n  ownership of my own children tooth and nail; and so will a good\n  many other fellows, I can tell you.\n\n  EDITH. It seems to me that they should be divided between the\n  parents. If Cecil wishes any of the children to be his\n  exclusively, he should pay a certain sum for the risk and trouble\n  of bringing them into the world: say a thousand pounds apiece.\n  The interest on this could go towards the support of the child as\n  long as we live together. But the principal would be my property.\n  In that way, if Cecil took the child away from me, I should at\n  least be paid for what it had cost me.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [putting down her knitting in amazement] Edith!\n  Who ever heard of such a thing!!\n\n  EDITH. Well, how else do you propose to settle it?\n\n  THE BISHOP. There is such a thing as a favorite child. What about\n  the youngest child--the Benjamin--the child of its parents'\n  matured strength and charity, always better treated and better\n  loved than the unfortunate eldest children of their youthful\n  ignorance and wilfulness? Which parent is to own the youngest\n  child, payment or no payment?\n\n  COLLINS. Theres a third party, my lord. Theres the child itself.\n  My wife is so fond of her children that they cant call their\n  lives their own. They all run away from home to escape from her.\n  A child hasnt a grown-up person's appetite for affection. A\n  little of it goes a long way with them; and they like a good\n  imitation of it better than the real thing, as every nurse knows.\n\n  SOAMEs. Are you sure that any of us, young or old, like the real\n  thing as well as we like an artistic imitation of it? Is not the\n  real thing accursed? Are not the best beloved always the good\n  actors rather than the true sufferers? Is not love always\n  falsified in novels and plays to make it endurable? I have\n  noticed in myself a great delight in pictures of the Saints and\n  of Our Lady; but when I fall under that most terrible curse of\n  the priest's lot, the curse of Joseph pursued by the wife of\n  Potiphar, I am invariably repelled and terrified.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Are you now speaking as a saint, Father Anthony, or as\n  a solicitor?\n\n  SOAMES. There is no difference. There is not one Christian rule\n  for solicitors and another for saints. Their hearts are alike;\n  and their way of salvation is along the same road.\n\n  THE BISHOP. But \"few there be that find it.\"  Can you find it for\n  us, Anthony?\n\n  SOAMES. It lies broad before you. It is the way to destruction\n  that is narrow and tortuous. Marriage is an abomination which the\n  Church has founded to cast out and replace by the communion of\n  saints. I learnt that from every marriage settlement I drew up as\n  a solicitor no less than from inspired revelation. You have set\n  yourselves here to put your sin before you in black and white;\n  and you cant agree upon or endure one article of it.\n\n  SYKES. It's certainly rather odd that the whole thing seems to\n  fall to pieces the moment you touch it.\n\n  THE BISHOP. You see, when you give the devil fair play he loses\n  his case. He has not been able to produce even the first clause\n  of a working agreement; so I'm afraid we cant wait for him any\n  longer.\n\n  LESBIA. Then the community will have to do without my children.\n\n  EDITH. And Cecil will have to do without me.\n\n  LEO [getting off the chest] And I positively will not marry\n  Sinjon if he is not clever enough to make some provision for my\n  looking after Rejjy. [She leaves Hotchkiss, and goes back to her\n  chair at the end of the table behind Mrs Bridgenorth].\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. And the world will come to an end with this\n  generation, I suppose.\n\n  COLLINS. Cant nothing be done, my lord?\n\n  THE BISHOP. You can make divorce reasonable and decent: that is\n  all.\n\n  LESBIA. Thank you for nothing. If you will only make marriage\n  reasonable and decent, you can do as you like about divorce. I\n  have not stated my deepest objection to marriage; and I dont\n  intend to. There are certain rights I will not give any person\n  over me.\n\n  REGINALD. Well, I think it jolly hard that a man should support\n  his wife for years, and lose the chance of getting a really good\n  wife, and then have her refuse to be a wife to him.\n\n  LESBIA. I'm not going to discuss it with you, Rejjy. If your\n  sense of personal honor doesnt make you understand, nothing will.\n\n  SOAMES [implacably] I'm still awaiting my instructions.\n\n  They look at one another, each waiting for one of the others to\n  suggest something. Silence.\n\n  REGINALD [blankly] I suppose, after all, marriage is better than\n  --well, than the usual alternative.\n\n  SOAMES [turning fiercely on him] What right have you to say so?\n  You know that the sins that are wasting and maddening this\n  unhappy nation are those committed in wedlock.\n\n  COLLINS. Well, the single ones cant afford to indulge their\n  affections the same as married people.\n\n  SOAMES. Away with it all, I say. You have your Master's\n  commandments. Obey them.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [rising and leaning on the back of the chair left\n  vacant by the General] I really must point out to you, Father\n  Anthony, that the early Christian rules of life were not made to\n  last, because the early Christians did not believe that the world\n  itself was going to last. Now we know that we shall have to go\n  through with it. We have found that there are millions of years\n  behind us; and we know that that there are millions before us.\n  Mrs Bridgenorth's question remains unanswered. How is the world\n  to go on? You say that that is our business--that it is the\n  business of Providence. But the modern Christian view is that we\n  are here to do the business of Providence and nothing else. The\n  question is, how. Am I not to use my reason to find out why? Isnt\n  that what my reason is for? Well, all my reason tells me at\n  present is that you are an impracticable lunatic.\n\n  SOAMEs. Does that help?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. No.\n\n  SOAMEs. Then pray for light.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. No: I am a snob, not a beggar. [He sits down in the\n  General's chair].\n\n  COLLINS. We dont seem to be getting on, do we? Miss Edith: you\n  and Mr Sykes had better go off to church and settle the right and\n  wrong of it afterwards. Itll ease your minds, believe me: I speak\n  from experience. You will burn your boats, as one might say.\n\n  SOAMES. We should never burn our boats. It is death in life.\n\n  COLLINS. Well, Father, I will say for you that you have views of\n  your own and are not afraid to out with them. But some of us are\n  of a more cheerful disposition. On the Borough Council now, you\n  would be in a minority of one. You must take human nature as it\n  is.\n\n  SOAMES. Upon what compulsion must I? I'll take divine nature as\n  it is. I'll not hold a candle to the devil.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Thats a very unchristian way of treating the devil.\n\n  REGINALD. Well, we dont seem to be getting any further, do we?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Will you give it up and get married, Edith?\n\n  EDITH. No. What I propose seems to me quite reasonable.\n\n  THE BISHOP. And you, Lesbia?\n\n  LESBIA. Never.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. Never is a long word, Lesbia. Dont say it.\n\n  LESBIA [with a flash of temper] Dont pity me, Alice, please. As I\n  said before, I am an English lady, quite prepared to do without\n  anything I cant have on honorable conditions.\n\n  SOAMES [after a silence expressive of utter deadlock] I am still\n  awaiting my instructions.\n\n  REGINALD. Well, we dont seem to be getting along, do we?\n\n  LEO [out of patience] You said that before, Rejjy. Do not repeat\n  yourself.\n\n  REGINALD. Oh, bother! [He goes to the garden door and looks out\n  gloomily].\n\n  SOAMES [rising with the paper in his hands] Psha! [He tears it in\n  pieces]. So much for the contract!\n\n  THE VOICE OF THE BEADLE. By your leave there, gentlemen. Make way\n  for the Mayoress. Way for the worshipful the Mayoress, my lords\n  and gentlemen. [He comes in through the tower, in cocked hat and\n  goldbraided overcoat, bearing the borough mace, and posts himself\n  at the entrance]. By your leave, gentlemen, way for the\n  worshipful the Mayoress.\n\n  COLLINS [moving back towards the wall] Mrs George, my lord.\n\n  Mrs George is every inch a Mayoress in point of stylish dressing;\n  and she does it very well indeed. There is nothing quiet about\n  Mrs George; she is not afraid of colors, and knows how to make\n  the most of them. Not at all a lady in Lesbia's use of the term\n  as a class label, she proclaims herself to the first glance as\n  the triumphant, pampered, wilful, intensely alive woman who has\n  always been rich among poor people. In a historical museum she\n  would explain Edward the Fourth's taste for shopkeepers' wives.\n  Her age, which is certainly 40, and might be 50, is carried off\n  by her vitality, her resilient figure, and her confident\n  carriage. So far, a remarkably well-preserved woman. But her\n  beauty is wrecked, like an ageless landscape ravaged by long and\n  fierce war. Her eyes are alive, arresting and haunting; and there\n  is still a turn of delicate beauty and pride in her indomitable\n  chin; but her cheeks are wasted and lined, her mouth writhen and\n  piteous. The whole face is a battlefield of the passions, quite\n  deplorable until she speaks, when an alert sense of fun\n  rejuvenates her in a moment, and makes her company irresistible.\n\n  All rise except Soames, who sits down. Leo joins Reginald at the\n  garden door. Mrs Bridgenorth hurries to the tower to receive her\n  guest, and gets as far as Soames's chair when Mrs George appears.\n  Hotchkiss, apparently recognizing her, recoils in consternation\n  to the study door at the furthest corner of the room from her.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [coming straight to the Bishop with the ring in her\n  hand] Here is your ring, my lord; and here am I. It's your doing,\n  remember: not mine.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Good of you to come.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. How do you do, Mrs Collins?\n\n  MRS GEORGE [going to her past the Bishop, and gazing intently at\n  her] Are you his wife?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. The Bishop's wife? Yes.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. What a destiny! And you look like any other woman!\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [introducing Lesbia] My sister, Miss Grantham.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. So strangely mixed up with the story of the General's\n  life?\n\n  THE BISHOP. You know the story of his life, then?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Not all. We reached the house before he brought it up\n  to the present day. But enough to know the part played in it by\n  Miss Grantham.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [introducing Leo] Mrs Reginald Bridgenorth.\n\n  REGINALD. The late Mrs Reginald Bridgenorth.\n\n  LEO. Hold your tongue, Rejjy. At least have the decency to wait\n  until the decree is made absolute.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [to Leo] Well, youve more time to get married again\n  than he has, havnt you?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [introducing Hotchkiss] Mr St John Hotchkiss.\n\n  Hotchkiss, still far aloof by the study door, bows.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. What! That! [She makes a half tour of the kitchen and\n  ends right in front of him]. Young man: do you remember coming\n  into my shop and telling me that my husband's coals were out of\n  place in your cellar, as Nature evidently intended them for the\n  roof?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I remember that deplorable impertinence with shame and\n  confusion. You were kind enough to answer that Mr Collins was\n  looking out for a clever young man to write advertisements, and\n  that I could take the job if I liked.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. It's still open. [She turns to Edith].\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. My daughter Edith. [She comes towards the study\n  door to make the introduction].\n\n  MRS GEORGE. The bride! [Looking at Edith's dressing-jacket] Youre\n  not going to get married like that, are you?\n\n  THE BISHOP [coming round the table to Edith's left] Thats just\n  what we are discussing. Will you be so good as to join us and\n  allow us the benefit of your wisdom and experience?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Do you want the Beadle as well? He's a married man.\n\n  They all turn, involuntarily and contemplate the Beadle, who\n  sustains their gaze with dignity.\n\n  THE BISHOP. We think there are already too many men to be quite\n  fair to the women.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Right, my lord. [She goes back to the tower and\n  addresses the Beadle] Take away that bauble, Joseph. Wait for me\n  wherever you find yourself most comfortable in the neighborhood.\n  [The Beadle withdraws. She notices Collins for the first time].\n  Hullo, Bill: youve got em all on too. Go and hunt up a drink for\n  Joseph: theres a dear. [Collins goes out. She looks at Soames's\n  cassock and biretta]  What! Another uniform! Are you the sexton?\n  [He rises].\n\n  THE BISHOP. My chaplain, Father Anthony.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Oh Lord! [To Soames, coaxingly] You dont mind, do\n  you?\n\n  SOAMES. I mind nothing but my duties.\n\n  THE BISHOP. You know everybody now, I think.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [turning to the railed chair] Who's this?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Oh, I beg your pardon, Cecil. Mr Sykes. The\n  bridegroom.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [to Sykes] Adorned for the sacrifice, arnt you?\n\n  SYKES. It seems doubtful whether there is going to be any\n  sacrifice.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Well, I want to talk to the women first. Shall we go\n  upstairs and look at the presents and dresses?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. If you wish, certainly.\n\n  REGINALD. But the men want to hear what you have to say too.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. I'll talk to them afterwards: one by one.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [to himself] Great heavens!\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. This way, Mrs Collins. [She leads the way out\n  through the tower, followed by Mrs George, Lesbia, Leo, and\n  Edith].\n\n  THE BISHOP. Shall we try to get through the last batch of letters\n  whilst they are away, Soames?\n\n  SOAMES. Yes, certainly. [To Hotchkiss, who is in his way] Excuse\n  me.\n\n  The Bishop and Soames go into the study, disturbing Hotchkiss,\n  who, plunged in a strange reverie, has forgotten where he is.\n  Awakened by Soames, he stares distractedly; then, with sudden\n  resolution, goes swiftly to the middle of the kitchen.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Cecil. Rejjy. [Startled by his urgency, they hurry to\n  him]. I'm frightfully sorry to desert on this day; but I must\n  bolt. This time it really is pure cowardice. I cant help it.\n\n  REGINALD. What are you afraid of?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I dont know. Listen to me. I was a young fool living\n  by myself in London. I ordered my first ton of coals from that\n  woman's husband. At that time I did not know that it is not true\n  economy to buy the lowest priced article: I thought all coals\n  were alike, and tried the thirteen shilling kind because it\n  seemed cheap. It proved unexpectedly inferior to the family\n  Silkstone; and in the irritation into which the first scuttle\n  threw me, I called at the shop and made an idiot of myself as she\n  described.\n\n  SYKES. Well, suppose you did! Laugh at it, man.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. At that, yes. But there was something worse. Judge of\n  my horror when, calling on the coal merchant to make a trifling\n  complaint at finding my grate acting as a battery of quick-firing\n  guns, and being confronted by his vulgar wife, I felt in her\n  presence an extraordinary sensation of unrest, of emotion, of\n  unsatisfied need. I'll not disgust you with details of the\n  madness and folly that followed that meeting. But it went as far\n  as this: that I actually found myself prowling past the shop at\n  night under a sort of desperate necessity to be near some place\n  where she had been. A hideous temptation to kiss the doorstep\n  because her foot had pressed it made me realize how mad I was. I\n  tore myself away from London by a supreme effort; but I was on\n  the point of returning like a needle to the lodestone when the\n  outbreak of the war saved me. On the field of battle the\n  infatuation wore off. The Billiter affair made a new man of me: I\n  felt that I had left the follies and puerilities of the old days\n  behind me for ever. But half-an-hour ago--when the Bishop sent\n  off that ring--a sudden grip at the base of my heart filled me\n  with a nameless terror--me, the fearless! I recognized its cause\n  when she walked into the room. Cecil: this woman is a harpy, a\n  siren, a mermaid, a vampire. There is only one chance for me:\n  flight, instant precipitate flight. Make my excuses.\n  Forget me. Farewell. [He makes for the door and is confronted by\n  Mrs George entering]. Too late: I'm lost. [He turns back and\n  throws himself desperately into the chair nearest the study door;\n  that being the furthest away from her].\n\n  MRS GEORGE [coming to the hearth and addressing Reginald] Mr\n  Bridgenorth: will you oblige me by leaving me with this young\n  man. I want to talk to him like a mother, on YOUR business.\n\n  REGINALD. Do, maam. He needs it badly. Come along, Sykes. [He\n  goes into the study].\n\n  SYKES [looks irresolutely at Hotchkiss]--?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Too late: you cant save me now, Cecil. Go.\n\n  Sykes goes into the study. Mrs George strolls across to Hotchkiss\n  and contemplates him curiously.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Useless to prolong this agony. [Rising] Fatal woman--\n  if woman you are indeed and not a fiend in human form--\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Is this out of a book? Or is it your usual society\n  small talk?\n\n  HOTCHKISS [recklessly] Jibes are useless: the force that is\n  sweeping me away will not spare you. I must know the worst at\n  once. What was your father?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. A licensed victualler who married his barmaid. You\n  would call him a publican, most likely.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Then you are a woman totally beneath me. Do you deny\n  it? Do you set up any sort of pretence to be my equal in rank, in\n  age, or in culture?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Have you eaten anything that has disagreed with you?\n\n  HOTCHKISS [witheringly] Inferior!\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Thank you. Anything else?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. This. I love you. My intentions are not honorable.\n  [She shows no dismay]. Scream. Ring the bell. Have me turned out\n  of the house.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [with sudden depth of feeling]  Oh, if you could\n  restore to this wasted exhausted heart one ray of the passion\n  that once welled up at the glance at the touch of a lover! It's\n  you who would scream then, young man. Do you see this face, once\n  fresh and rosy like your own, now scarred and riven by a hundred\n  burnt-out fires?\n\n  HOTCHKISS [wildly] Slate fires. Thirteen shillings a ton. Fires\n  that shoot out destructive meteors, blinding and burning, sending\n  men into the streets to make fools of themselves.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You seem to have got it pretty bad, Sinjon.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Dont dare call me Sinjon.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. My name is Zenobia Alexandrina. You may call me Polly\n  for short.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Your name is Ashtoreth--Durga--there is no name yet\n  invented malign enough for you.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [sitting down comfortably] Come! Do you really think\n  youre better suited to that young sauce box than her husband? You\n  enjoyed her company when you were only the friend of the family--\n  when there was the husband there to shew off against and to take\n  all the responsibility. Are you sure youll enjoy it as much when\n  you are the husband? She isnt clever, you know. She's only silly-\n  clever.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [uneasily leaning against the table and holding on to\n  it to control his nervous movements] Need you tell me? fiend that\n  you are!\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You amused the husband, didnt you?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. He has more real sense of humor than she. He's better\n  bred. That was not my fault.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. My husband has a sense of humor too.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. The coal merchant?--I mean the slate merchant.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [appreciatively] He would just love to hear you talk.\n  He's been dull lately for want of a change of company and a bit\n  of fresh fun.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [flinging a chair opposite her and sitting down with an\n  overdone attempt at studied insolence] And pray what is your\n  wretched husband's vulgar conviviality to me?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You love me?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I loathe you.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. It's the same thing.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Then I'm lost.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You may come and see me if you promise to amuse\n  George.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I'll insult him, sneer at him, wipe my boots on him.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. No you wont, dear boy. Youll be a perfect gentleman.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [beaten; appealing to her mercy] Zenobia--\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Polly, please.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Mrs Collins--\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Sir?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Something stronger than my reason and common sense is\n  holding my hands and tearing me along. I make no attempt to deny\n  that it can drag me where you please and make me do what you\n  like. But at least let me know your soul as you seem to know\n  mine. Do you love this absurd coal merchant?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Call him George.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Do you love your Jorjy Porjy?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Oh, I dont know that I love him. He's my husband, you\n  know. But if I got anxious about George's health, and I thought\n  it would nourish him, I would fry you with onions for his\n  breakfast and think nothing of it. George and I are good friends.\n  George belongs to me. Other men may come and go; but George goes\n  on for ever.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Yes: a husband soon becomes nothing but a habit.\n  Listen: I suppose this detestable fascination you have for me is\n  love.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Any sort of feeling for a woman is called love\n  nowadays.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Do you love me?\n\n  MRS GEORGE [promptly] My love is not quite so cheap an article as\n  that, my lad. I wouldnt cross the street to have another look at\n  you--not yet. I'm not starving for love like the robins in\n  winter, as the good ladies youre accustomed to are. Youll have to\n  be very clever, and very good, and very real, if you are to\n  interest me. If George takes a fancy to you, and you amuse him\n  enough, I'll just tolerate you coming in and out occasionally\n  for--well, say a month. If you can make a friend of me in that\n  time so much the better for you. If you can touch my poor dying\n  heart even for an instant, I'll bless you, and never forget you.\n  You may try--if George takes to you.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I'm to come on liking for the month?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. On condition that you drop Mrs Reginald.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. But she wont drop me. Do you suppose I ever wanted to\n  marry her? I was a homeless bachelor; and I felt quite happy at\n  their house as their friend. Leo was an amusing little devil; but\n  I liked Reginald much more than I liked her. She didnt\n  understand. One day she came to me and told me that the\n  inevitable bad happened. I had tact enough not to ask her what\n  the inevitable was; and I gathered presently that she had told\n  Reginald that their marriage was a mistake and that she loved me\n  and could no longer see me breaking my heart for her in suffering\n  silence. What could I say? What could I do? What can I say now?\n  What can I do now?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Tell her that the habit of falling in love with other\n  men's wives is growing on you; and that I'm your latest.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. What! Throw her over when she has thrown Reginald over\n  for me!\n\n  MRS GEORGE [rising] You wont then? Very well. Sorry we shant meet\n  again: I should have liked to see more of you for George's sake.\n  Good-bye [she moves away from him towards the hearth].\n\n  HOTCHKISS [appealing] Zenobia--\n\n  MRS. GEORGE. I thought I lead made a difficult conquest. Now I\n  see you are only one of those poor petticoat-hunting creatures\n  that any woman can pick up. Not for me, thank you. [Inexorable,\n  she turns towards the tower to go].\n\n  HOTCHKISS [following] Dont be an ass, Polly.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [stopping] Thats better.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Cant you see that I maynt throw Leo over just because\n  I should be only too glad to. It would be dishonorable.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Will you be happy if you marry her?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. No, great heaven, NO!\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Will she be happy when she finds you out?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. She's incapable of happiness. But she's not incapable\n  of the pleasure of holding a man against his will.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Right, young man. You will tell her, please, that you\n  love me: before everybody, mind, the very next time you see her.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. But--\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Those are my orders, Sinjon. I cant have you marry\n  another woman until George is tired of you.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Oh, if I only didnt selfishly want to obey you!\n\n  The General comes in from the garden. Mrs George goes half way to\n  the garden door to speak to him. Hotchkiss posts himself on the\n  hearth.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Where have you been all this time?\n\n  THE GENERAL. I'm afraid my nerves were a little upset by our\n  conversation. I just went into the garden and had a smoke. I'm\n  all right now [he strolls down to the study door and presently\n  takes a chair at that end of the big table].\n\n  MRS GEORGE. A smoke! Why, you said she couldnt bear it.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Good heavens! I forgot! It's such a natural thing to\n  do, somehow.\n\n  Lesbia comes in through the tower.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. He's been smoking again.\n\n  LESBIA. So my nose tells me. [She goes to the end of the table\n  nearest the hearth, and sits down].\n\n  THE GENERAL. Lesbia: I'm very sorry. But if I gave it up, I\n  should become so melancholy and irritable that you would be the\n  first to implore me to take to it again.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Thats true. Women drive their husbands into all sorts\n  of wickedness to keep them in good humor. Sinjon: be off with\n  you: this doesnt concern you.\n\n  LESBIA. Please dont disturb yourself, Sinjon. Boxer's broken\n  heart has been worn on his sleeve too long for any pretence of\n  privacy.\n\n  THE GENERAL. You are cruel, Lesbia: devilishly cruel. [He sits\n  down, wounded].\n\n  LESBIA. You are vulgar, Boxer.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. In what way? I ask, as an expert in vulgarity.\n\n  LESBIA. In two ways. First, he talks as if the only thing of any\n  importance in life was which particular woman he shall marry.\n  Second, he has no self-control.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Women are not all the same to me, Lesbia.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Why should they be, pray? Women are all different:\n  it's the men who are all the same. Besides, what does Miss\n  Grantham know about either men or women? She's got too much self-\n  control.\n\n  LESBIA [widening her eyes and lifting her chin haughtily] And\n  pray how does that prevent me from knowing as much about men and\n  women as people who have no self-control?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Because it frightens people into behaving themselves\n  before you; and then how can you tell what they really are? Look\n  at me! I was a spoilt child. My brothers and sisters were well\n  brought up, like all children of respectable publicans. So should\n  I have been if I hadnt been the youngest: ten years younger than\n  my youngest brother. My parents were tired of doing their duty by\n  their children by that time; and they spoilt me for all they were\n  worth. I never knew what it was to want money or anything that\n  money could buy. When I wanted my own way, I had nothing to do\n  but scream for it till I got it. When I was annoyed I didnt\n  control myself: I scratched and called names. Did you ever, after\n  you were grown up, pull a grown-up woman's hair? Did you ever\n  bite a grown-up man? Did you ever call both of them every name\n  you could lay your tongue to?\n\n  LESBIA [shivering with disgust] No.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Well, I did. I know what a woman is like when her\n  hair's pulled. I know what a man is like when he's bit. I know\n  what theyre both like when you tell them what you really feel\n  about them. And thats how I know more of the world than you.\n\n  LESBIA. The Chinese know what a man is like when he is cut into a\n  thousand pieces, or boiled in oil. That sort of knowledge is of\n  no use to me. I'm afraid we shall never get on with one another,\n  Mrs George. I live like a fencer, always on guard. I like to be\n  confronted with people who are always on guard. I hate sloppy\n  people, slovenly people, people who cant sit up straight,\n  sentimental people.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Oh, sentimental your grandmother! You dont learn to\n  hold your own in the world by standing on guard, but by\n  attacking, and getting well hammered yourself.\n\n  LESBIA. I'm not a prize-fighter, Mrs. Collins. If I cant get a\n  thing without the indignity of fighting for it, I do without it.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Do you? Does it strike you that if we were all as\n  clever as you at doing without, there wouldnt be much to live\n  for, would there?\n\n  TAE GENERAL. I'm afraid, Lesbia, the things you do without are\n  the things you dont want.\n\n  LESBIA [surprised at his wit] Thats not bad for the silly soldier\n  man. Yes, Boxer: the truth is, I dont want you enough to make the\n  very unreasonable sacrifices required by marriage. And yet that\n  is exactly why I ought to be married. Just because I have the\n  qualities my country wants most I shall go barren to my grave;\n  whilst the women who have neither the strength to resist marriage\n  nor the intelligence to understand its infinite dishonor will\n  make the England of the future. [She rises and walks towards the\n  study].\n\n  THE GENERAL [as she is about to pass him] Well, I shall not ask\n  you again, Lesbia.\n\n  LESBIA. Thank you, Boxer. [She passes on to the study door].\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Youre quite done with him, are you?\n\n  LESBIA. As far as marriage is concerned, yes. The field is clear\n  for you, Mrs George. [She goes into the study].\n\n  The General buries his face in his hands. Mrs George comes round\n  the table to him.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [sympathetically] She's a nice woman, that. And a\n  sort of beauty about her too, different from anyone else.\n\n  THE GENERAL [overwhelmed] Oh Mrs Collins, thank you, thank you a\n  thousand times. [He rises effusively]. You have thawed the long-\n  frozen springs [he kisses her hand]. Forgive me; and thank you:\n  bless you--[he again takes refuge in the garden, choked with\n  emotion].\n\n  MRS GEORGE [looking after him triumphantly] Just caught the dear\n  old warrior on the bounce, eh?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Unfaithful to me already!\n\n  MRS GEORGE. I'm not your property, young man dont you think it.\n  [She goes over to him and faces him]. You understand that? [He\n  suddenly snatches her into his arms and kisses her]. Oh! You.\n  dare do that again, you young blackguard; and I'll jab one of\n  these chairs in your face [she seizes one and holds it in\n  readiness]. Now you shall not see me for another month.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [deliberately] I shall pay my first visit to your\n  husband this afternoon.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Youll see what he'll say to you when I tell him what\n  youve just done.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. What can he say? What dare he say?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Suppose he kicks you out of the house?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. How can he? Ive fought seven duels with sabres. Ive\n  muscles of iron. Nothing hurts me: not even broken bones.\n  Fighting is absolutely uninteresting to me because it doesnt\n  frighten me or amuse me; and I always win. Your husband is in all\n  these respects an average man, probably. He will be horribly\n  afraid of me; and if under the stimulus of your presence, and for\n  your sake, and because it is the right thing to do among vulgar\n  people, he were to attack me, I should simply defeat him and\n  humiliate him [he gradually gets his hands on the chair and takes\n  it from her, as his words go home phrase by phrase]. Sooner than\n  expose him to that, you would suffer a thousand stolen kisses,\n  wouldnt you?\n\n  MRS GEORGE [in utter consternation] You young viper!\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Ha ha! You are in my power. That is one of the\n  oversights of your code of honor for husbands: the man who can\n  bully them can insult their wives with impunity. Tell him if you\n  dare. If I choose to take ten kisses, how will you prevent me?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You come within reach of me and I'll not leave a hair\n  on your head.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [catching her wrists dexterously] Ive got your hands.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Youve not got my teeth. Let go; or I'll bite. I will,\n  I tell you. Let go.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Bite away: I shall taste quite as nice as George.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You beast. Let me go. Do you call yourself a\n  gentleman, to use your brute strength against a woman?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. You are stronger than me in every way but this. Do you\n  think I will give up my one advantage? Promise youll receive me\n  when I call this afternoon.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. After what youve just done? Not if it was to save my\n  life.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I'll amuse George.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. He wont be in.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [taken aback] Do you mean that we should be alone?\n\n  MRS GEORGE [snatching away her hands triumphantly as his grasp\n  relaxes] Aha! Thats cooled you, has it?\n\n  HOTCHKISS [anxiously] When will George be at home?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. It wont matter to you whether he's at home or not.\n  The door will be slammed in your face whenever you call.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. No servant in London is strong enough to close a door\n  that I mean to keep open. You cant escape me. If you persist,\n  I'll go into the coal trade; make George's acquaintance on the\n  coal exchange; and coax him to take me home with him to make your\n  acquaintance.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. We have no use for you, young man: neither George nor\n  I [she sails away from him and sits down at the end of the table\n  near the study door].\n\n  HOTCHKISS [following her and taking the next chair round the\n  corner of the table] Yes you have. George cant fight for you: I\n  can.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [turning to face him] You bully. You low bully.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. You have courage and fascination: I have courage and a\n  pair of fists. We're both bullies, Polly.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You have a mischievous tongue. Thats enough to keep\n  you out of my house.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. It must be rather a house of cards. A word from me to\n  George--just the right word, said in the right way--and down\n  comes your house.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Thats why I'll die sooner than let you into it.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Then as surely as you live, I enter the coal trade to-\n  morrow. George's taste for amusing company will deliver him into\n  my hands. Before a month passes your home will be at my mercy.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [rising, at bay] Do you think I'll let myself be\n  driven into a trap like this?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. You are in it already. Marriage is a trap. You are\n  married. Any man who has the power to spoil your marriage has the\n  power to spoil your life. I have that power over you.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [desperate] You mean it?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I do.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [resolutely] Well, spoil my marriage and be--\n\n  HOTCHKISS [springing up] Polly!\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Sooner than be your slave I'd face any unhappiness.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. What! Even for George?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. There must be honor between me and George, happiness\n  or no happiness. Do your worst.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [admiring her] Are you really game, Polly? Dare you\n  defy me?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. If you ask me another question I shant be able to\n  keep my hands off you [she dashes distractedly past him to the\n  other end of the table, her fingers crisping].\n\n  HOTCHKISS. That settles it. Polly: I adore you: we were born for\n  one another. As I happen to be a gentleman, I'll never do\n  anything to annoy or injure you except that I reserve the right\n  to give you a black eye if you bite me; but youll never get rid\n  of me now to the end of your life.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. I shall get rid of you if the beadle has to brain you\n  with the mace for it [she makes for the tower].\n\n  HOTCHKISS [running between the table and the oak chest and across\n  to the tower to cut her off] You shant.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [panting] Shant I though?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. No you shant. I have one card left to play that youve\n  forgotten. Why were you so unlike yourself when you spoke to the\n  Bishop?\n\n  MRS GEORGE [agitated beyond measure] Stop. Not that. You shall\n  respect that if you respect nothing else. I forbid you. [He\n  kneels at her feet]. What are you doing? Get up: dont be a fool.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Polly: I ask you on my knees to let me make George's\n  acquaintance in his home this afternoon; and I shall remain on my\n  knees till the Bishop comes in and sees us. What will he think of\n  you then?\n\n  MRS GEORGE [beside herself] Wheres the poker? She rushes to the\n  fireplace; seizes the poker; and makes for Hotchkiss, who flies\n  to the study door. The Bishop enters just then and finds himself\n  between them, narrowly escaping a blow from the poker.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Dont hit him, Mrs Collins. He is my guest.\n\n  Mrs George throws down the poker; collapses into the nearest\n  chair; and bursts into tears. The Bishop goes to her and pats her\n  consolingly on the shoulder. She shudders all through at his\n  touch.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Come! you are in the house of your friends. Can we\n  help you?\n\n  MRS GEORGE [to Hotchkiss, pointing to the study] Go in there,\n  you. Youre not wanted here.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. You understand, Bishop, that Mrs Collins is not to\n  blame for this scene. I'm afraid Ive been rather irritating.\n\n  THE BISHOP. I can quite believe it, Sinjon.\n\n  Hotchkiss goes into the study.\n\n  THE BISHOP [turning to Mrs George with great kindness of manner]\n  I'm sorry you have been worried [he sits down on her left]. Never\n  mind him. A little pluck, a little gaiety of heart, a little\n  prayer; and youll be laughing at him.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Never fear. I have all that. It was as much my fault\n  as his; and I should have put him in his place with a clip of\n  that poker on the side of his head if you hadnt come in.\n\n  THE BISHOP. You might have put him in his coffin that way, Mrs\n  Collins. And I should have been very sorry; because we are all\n  fond of Sinjon.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Yes: it's your duty to rebuke me. But do you think I\n  dont know?\n\n  THE BISHOP. I dont rebuke you. Who am I that I should rebuke you?\n  Besides, I know there are discussions in which the poker is the\n  only possible argument.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. My lord: be earnest with me. I'm a very funny woman,\n  I daresay; but I come from the same workshop as you. I heard you\n  say that yourself years ago.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Quite so; but then I'm a very funny Bishop. Since we\n  are both funny people, let us not forget that humor is a divine\n  attribute.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. I know nothing about divine attributes or whatever\n  you call them; but I can feel when I am being belittled. It was\n  from you that I learnt first to respect myself. It was through\n  you that I came to be able to walk safely through many wild and\n  wilful paths. Dont go back on your own teaching.\n\n  THE BISHOP. I'm not a teacher: only a fellow-traveller of whom\n  you asked the way. I pointed ahead--ahead of myself as well as of\n  you.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [rising and standing over him almost threateningly] As\n  I'm a living woman this day, if I find you out to be a fraud,\n  I'll kill myself.\n\n  THE BISHOP. What! Kill yourself for finding out something! For\n  becoming a wiser and therefore a better woman! What a bad reason!\n\n  MRS GEORGE. I have sometimes thought of killing you, and then\n  killing myself.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Why on earth should you kill yourself--not to mention\n  me?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. So that we might keep our assignation in Heaven.\n\n  THE BISHOP [rising and facing her, breathless] Mrs. Collins! YOU\n  are Incognita Appassionata!\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You read my letters, then? [With a sigh of grateful\n  relief, she sits down quietly, and says] Thank you.\n\n  THE BISHOP [remorsefully] And I have broken the spell by making\n  you come here [sitting down again]. Can you ever forgive me?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You couldnt know that it was only the coal merchant's\n  wife, could you?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Why do you say only the coal merchant's wife?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Many people would laugh at it.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Poor people! It's so hard to know the right place to\n  laugh, isnt it?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. I didnt mean to make you think the letters were from\n  a fine lady. I wrote on cheap paper; and I never could spell.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Neither could I. So that told me nothing.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. One thing I should like you to know.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Yes?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. We didnt cheat your friend. They were as good as we\n  could do at thirteen shillings a ton.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Thats important. Thank you for telling me.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. I have something else to say; but will you please ask\n  somebody to come and stay here while we talk? [He rises and turns\n  to the study door]. Not a woman, if you dont mind. [He nods\n  understandingly and passes on]. Not a man either.\n\n  THE BISHOP [stopping] Not a man and not a woman! We have no\n  children left, Mrs Collins. They are all grown up and married.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. That other clergyman would do.\n\n  THE BISHOP. What! The sexton?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Yes. He didnt mind my calling him that, did he? It\n  was only my ignorance.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Not at all. [He opens the study door and calls]\n  Soames! Anthony! [To Mrs George] Call him Father: he likes it.\n  [Soames appears at the study door]. Mrs Collins wishes you to join\n  us, Anthony.\n\n  Soames looks puzzled.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You dont mind, Dad, do you? [As this greeting visibly\n  gives him a shock that hardly bears out the Bishop's advice, she\n  says anxiously] That was what you told me to call him, wasnt it?\n\n  SOAMES. I am called Father Anthony, Mrs Collins. But it does not\n  matter what you call me. [He comes in, and walks past her to the\n  hearth].\n\n  THE BISHOP. Mrs Collins has something to say to me that she wants\n  you to hear.\n\n  SOAMES. I am listening.\n\n  THE BISHOP [going back to his seat next her] Now.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. My lord: you should never have married.\n\n  SOAMES. This woman is inspired. Listen to her, my lord.\n\n  THE BISHOP [taken aback by the directness of the attack] I\n  married because I was so much in love with Alice that all the\n  difficulties and doubts and dangers of marriage seemed to me the\n  merest moonshine.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Yes: it's mean to let poor things in for so much\n  while theyre in that state. Would you marry now that you know\n  better if you were a widower?\n\n  THE BISHOP. I'm old now. It wouldnt matter.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. But would you if it did matter?\n\n  THE BISHOP. I think I should marry again lest anyone should\n  imagine I had found marriage unhappy with Alice.\n\n  SOAMES [sternly] Are you fonder of your wife than of your\n  salvation?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Oh, very much. When you meet a man who is very\n  particular about his salvation, look out for a woman who is very\n  particular about her character; and marry them to one another:\n  theyll make a perfect pair. I advise you to fall in love;\n  Anthony.\n\n  SOAMES [with horror] I!!\n\n  THE BISHOP. Yes, you! think of what it would do for you. For her\n  sake you would come to care unselfishly and diligently for money\n  instead of being selfishly and lazily indifferent to it. For her\n  sake you would come to care in the same way for preferment. For\n  her sake you would come to care for your health, your appearance,\n  the good opinion of your fellow creatures, and all the really\n  important things that make men work and strive instead of mooning\n  and nursing their salvation.\n\n  SOAMES. In one word, for the sake of one deadly sin I should come\n  to care for all the others.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Saint Anthony! Tempt him, Mrs Collins: tempt him.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [rising and looking strangely before her] Take care,\n  my lord: you still have the power to make me obey your commands.\n  And do you, Mr Sexton, beware of an empty heart.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Yes. Nature abhors a vacuum, Anthony. I would not\n  dare go about with an empty heart: why, the first girl I met\n  would fly into it by mere atmospheric pressure. Alice keeps them\n  out now. Mrs Collins knows.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [a faint convulsion passing like a wave over her] I\n  know more than either of you. One of you has not yet exhausted\n  his first love: the other has not yet reached it. But I--I--[she\n  reels and is again convulsed].\n\n  THE BISHOP [saving her from falling] Whats the matter? Are you\n  ill, Mrs Collins? [He gets her back into her chair]. Soames:\n  theres a glass of water in the study--quick. [Soames hurries to\n  the study door.]\n\n  MRS. GEORGE. No. [Soames stops]. Dont call. Dont bring anyone.\n  Cant you hear anything?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Nothing unusual. [He sits by her, watching her with\n  intense surprise and interest].\n\n  MRS GEORGE. No music?\n\n  SOAMES. No. [He steals to the end of the table and sits on her\n  right, equally interested].\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Do you see nothing--not a great light?\n\n  THE BISHOP. We are still walking in darkness.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Put your hand on my forehead: the hand with the ring.\n  [He does so. Her eyes close].\n\n  SOAMES [inspired to prophesy] There was a certain woman, the wife\n  of a coal merchant, which had been a great sinner . . .\n\n  The Bishop, startled, takes his hand away. Mrs George's eyes open\n  vividly as she interrupts Soames.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You prophesy falsely, Anthony: never in all my life\n  have I done anything that was not ordained for me. [More quietly]\n  Ive been myself. Ive not been afraid of myself. And at last I\n  have escaped from myself, and am become a voice for them that are\n  afraid to speak, and a cry for the hearts that break in silence.\n\n  SOAMES [whispering] Is she inspired?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Marvellous. Hush.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. I have earned the right to speak. I have dared: I\n  have gone through: I have not fallen withered in the fire: I have\n  come at last out beyond, to the back of Godspeed?\n\n  THE BISHOP. And what do you see there, at the back of Godspeed?\n\n  SOAMES [hungrily] Give us your message.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [with intensely sad reproach] When you loved me I gave\n  you the whole sun and stars to play with. I gave you eternity in\n  a single moment, strength of the mountains in one clasp of your\n  arms, and the volume of all the seas in one impulse of your\n  souls. A moment only; but was it not enough? Were you not paid\n  then for all the rest of your struggle on earth? Must I mend your\n  clothes and sweep your floors as well? Was it not enough? I paid\n  the price without bargaining: I bore the children without\n  flinching: was that a reason for heaping fresh burdens on me? I\n  carried the child in my arms: must I carry the father too? When I\n  opened the gates of paradise, were you blind? was it nothing to\n  you? When all the stars sang in your ears and all the winds swept\n  you into the heart of heaven, were you deaf? were you dull? was I\n  no more to you than a bone to a dog? Was it not enough? We spent\n  eternity together; and you ask me for a little lifetime more. We\n  possessed all the universe together; and you ask me to give you\n  my scanty wages as well. I have given you the greatest of all\n  things; and you ask me to give you little things. I gave you your\n  own soul: you ask me for my body as a plaything. Was it not\n  enough? Was it not enough?\n\n  SOAMES. Do you understand this, my lord?\n\n  THE BISHOP. I have that advantage over you, Anthony, thanks to\n  Alice. [He takes Mrs George's hand]. Your hand is very cold. Can\n  you come down to earth? Do you remember who I am, and who you\n  are?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. It was enough for me. I did not ask to meet you--to\n  touch you--[the Bishop quickly releases her hand]. When you spoke\n  to my soul years ago from your pulpit, you opened the doors of my\n  salvation to me; and now they stand open for ever. It was enough:\n  I have asked you for nothing since: I ask you for nothing now. I\n  have lived: it is enough. I have had my wages; and I am ready for\n  my work. I thank you and bless you and leave you. You are happier\n  in that than I am; for when I do for men what you did for me, I\n  have no thanks, and no blessing: I am their prey; and there is\n  no rest from their loving and no mercy from their loathing.\n\n  THE BISHOP. You must take us as we are, Mrs Collins.\n\n  SOAMES. No. Take us as we are capable of becoming.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Take me as I am: I ask no more. [She turns her head\n  to the study door and cries] Yes: come in, come in.\n\n  Hotchkiss comes softly in from the study.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Will you be so kind as to tell me whether I am\n  dreaming? In there I have heard Mrs Collins saying the strangest\n  things, and not a syllable from you two.\n\n  SOAMES. My lord; is this possession by the devil?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Or the ecstasy of a saint?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Or the convulsion of the pythoness on the tripod?\n\n  THE BISHOP. May not the three be one?\n\n  MRS GEORGE [troubled] You are paining and tiring me with idle\n  questions. You are dragging me back to myself. You are tormenting\n  me with your evil dreams of saints and devils and--what was it?--\n  [striving to fathom it] the pythoness--the pythoness--[giving it\n  up] I dont understand. I am a woman: a human creature like\n  yourselves. Will you not take me as I am?\n\n  SOAMES. Yes; but shall we take you and burn you?\n\n  THE BISHOP. Or take you and canonize you?\n\n  HOTCHKISS [gaily] Or take you as a matter of course? [Swiftly to\n  the Bishop] We must get her out of this: it's dangerous. [Aloud\n  to her] May I suggest that you shall be Anthony's devil and the\n  Bishop's saint and my adored Polly? [Slipping behind her, he\n  picks up her hand from her lap and kisses it over her shoulder].\n\n  MRS GEORGE [waking] What was that? Who kissed my hand? [To the\n  Bishop, eagerly] Was it you? [He shakes his head. She is\n  mortified]. I beg your pardon.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Not at all. I'm not repudiating that honor. Allow me\n  [he kisses her hand].\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Thank you for that. It was not the sexton, was it?\n\n  SOAMES. I!\n\n  HOTCHKISS. It was I, Polly, your ever faithful.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [turning and seeing him] Let me catch you doing it\n  again: thats all. How do you come there? I sent you away. [With\n  great energy, becoming quite herself again] What the goodness\n  gracious has been happening?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. As far as I can make out, you have been having a very\n  charming and eloquent sort of fit.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [delighted] What! My second sight! [To the Bishop] Oh,\n  how I have prayed that it might come to me if ever I met you! And\n  now it has come. How stunning! You may believe every word I said:\n  I cant remember it now; but it was something that was just\n  bursting to be said; and so it laid hold of me and said itself.\n  Thats how it is, you see.\n\n  Edith and Cecil Sykes come in through the tower. She has her hat\n  on. Leo follows. They have evidently been out together. Sykes,\n  with an unnatural air, half foolish, half rakish, as if he had\n  lost all his self-respect and were determined not to let it prey\n  on his spirits, throws himself into a chair at the end of the\n  table near the hearth and thrusts his hands into his pockets,\n  like Hogarth's Rake, without waiting for Edith to sit down. She\n  sits in the railed chair. Leo takes the chair nearest the tower\n  on the long side of the table, brooding, with closed lips.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Have you been out, my dear?\n\n  EDITH. Yes.\n\n  THE BISHOP. With Cecil?\n\n  EDITH. Yes.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Have you come to an understanding?\n\n  No reply. Blank silence.\n\n  SYKES. You had better tell them, Edie.\n\n  EDITH. Tell them yourself.\n\n  The General comes in from the garden.\n\n  THE GENERAL [coming forward to the table] Can anybody oblige me\n  with some tobacco? Ive finished mine; and my nerves are still far\n  from settled.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Wait a moment, Boxer. Cecil has something important\n  to tell us.\n\n  SYKES. Weve done it. Thats all.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Done what, Cecil?\n\n  SYKES. Well, what do you suppose?\n\n  EDITH. Got married, of course.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Married! Who gave you away?\n\n  SYKES [jerking his head towards the tower] This gentleman\n  did.[Seeing that they do not understand, he looks round and sees\n  that there is no one there]. Oh! I thought he came in with us.\n  Hes gone downstairs, I suppose. The Beadle.\n\n  THE GENERAL. The Beadle! What the devil did he do that for?\n\n  SYKES. Oh, I dont know: I didnt make any bargain with him. [To\n  Mrs George] How much ought I to give him, Mrs Collins?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Five shillings. [To the Bishop] I want to rest for a\n  moment: there! in your study. I saw it here [she touches her\n  forehead].\n\n  THE BISHOP [opening the study door for her] By all means. Turn my\n  brother out if he disturbs you. Soames: bring the letters out\n  here.\n\n  SYKES. He wont be offended at my offering it, will he?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Not he! He touches children with the mace to cure\n  them of ringworm for fourpence apiece. [She goes into the study.\n  Soames follows her].\n\n  THE GENERAL. Well, Edith, I'm a little disappointed, I must\n  say. However, I'm glad it was done by somebody in a public\n  uniform.\n\n  Mrs Bridgenorth and Lesbia come in through the tower. Mrs\n  Bridgenorth makes for the Bishop. He goes to her, and they meet\n  near the oak chest. Lesbia comes between Sykes and Edith.\n\n  THE BISHOP. Alice, my love, theyre married.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH [placidly] Oh, well, thats all right. Better tell\n  Collins.\n\n  Soames comes back from the study with his writing materials. He\n  seats himself at the nearest end of the table and goes on with\n  his work. Hotchkiss sits down in the next chair round the table\n  corner, with his back to him.\n\n  LESBIA. You have both given in, have you?\n\n  EDITH. Not at all. We have provided for everything.\n\n  SOAMES. How?\n\n  EDITH. Before going to the church, we went to the office of that\n  insurance company--whats its name, Cecil?\n\n  SYKES. The British Family Insurance Corporation. It insures you\n  against poor relations and all sorts of family contingencies.\n\n  EDITH. It has consented to insure Cecil against libel actions\n  brought against him on my account. It will give us specially low\n  terms because I am a Bishop's daughter.\n\n  SYKES. And I have given Edie my solemn word that if I ever commit\n  a crime I'll knock her down before a witness and go off to\n  Brighton with another lady.\n\n  LESBIA. Thats what you call providing for everything! [She goes\n  to the middle of the table on the garden side and sits down].\n\n  LEO. Do make him see there are no worms before he knocks you\n  down, Edith. Wheres Rejjy?\n\n  REGINALD [coming in from the study] Here. Whats the matter?\n\n  LEO [springing up and flouncing round to him] Whats the matter!\n  You may well ask. While Edie and Cecil were at the insurance\n  office I took a taxy and went off to your lodgings; and a nice\n  mess I found everything in. Your clothes are in a disgraceful\n  state. Your liver pad has been made into a kettle-holder. Youre\n  no more fit to be left to yourself than a one-year old baby.\n\n  REGINALD. Oh, I cant be bothered looking after things like that.\n  I'm all right.\n\n  LEO. Youre not: youre a disgrace. You never consider that youre a\n  disgrace to me: you think only of yourself. You must come home\n  with me and be taken proper care of: my conscience will not allow\n  me to let you live like a pig. [She arranges his necktie]. You\n  must stay with me until I marry St John; and then we can adopt\n  you or something.\n\n  REGINALD [breaking loose from her and stumping off past Hotchkiss\n  towards the hearth] No, I'm dashed if I'll be adopted by St John.\n  You can adopt him if you like.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [rising] I suggest that that would really be the better\n  plan, Leo. Ive a confession to make to you. I'm not the man you\n  took me for. Your objection to Rejjy was that he had low tastes.\n\n  REGINALD [turning] Was it? by George!\n\n  LEO. I said slovenly habits. I never thought he had really low\n  tastes until I saw that woman in court. How he could have chosen\n  such a creature and let her write to him after--\n\n  REGINALD. Is this fair? I never--\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Of course you didnt, Rejjy. Dont be silly, Leo. It's I\n  who really have low tastes.\n\n  LEO. You!\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Ive fallen in love with a coal merchant's wife. I\n  adore her. I would rather have one of her boot-laces than a lock\n  of your hair. [He folds his arms and stands like a rock].\n\n  REGINALD. You damned scoundrel, how dare you throw my wife over\n  like that before my face? [He seems on the point of assaulting\n  Hotchkiss when Leo gets between them and draws Reginald away\n  towards the study door].\n\n  LEO. Dont take any notice of him, Rejjy. Go at once and get that\n  odious decree demolished or annulled or whatever it is. Tell Sir\n  Gorell Barnes that I have changed my mind. [To Hotchkiss] I might\n  have known that you were too clever to be really a gentleman.\n  [She takes Reginald away to the oak chest and seats him there. He\n  chuckles. Hotchkiss resumes his seat, brooding].\n\n  THE BISHOP. All the problems appear to be solving themselves.\n\n  LESBIA. Except mine.\n\n  THE GENERAL. But, my dear Lesbia, you see what has happened here\n  to-day. [Coming a little nearer and bending his face towards\n  hers] Now I put it to you, does it not show you the folly of not\n  marrying?\n\n  LESBIA. No: I cant say it does. And [rising] you have been\n  smoking again.\n\n  THE GENERAL. You drive me to it, Lesbia. I cant help it.\n\n  LESBIA [standing behind her chair with her hands on the back of\n  it and looking radiant] Well, I wont scold you to-day. I feel in\n  particularly good humor just now.\n\n  TIE GENERAL. May I ask why, Lesbia?\n\n  LESBIA. [drawing a large breath] To think that after all the\n  dangers of the morning I am still unmarried! still independent!\n  still my own mistress! still a glorious strong-minded old maid of\n  old England!\n\n  Soames silently springs up and makes a long stretch from his end\n  of the table to shake her hand across it.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Do you find any real happiness in being your own\n  mistress? Would it not be more generous--would you not be happier\n  as some one else's mistress--\n\n  LESBIA. Boxer!\n\n  THE GENERAL [rising, horrified] No, no, you must know, my dear\n  Lesbia, that I was not using the word in its improper sense. I am\n  sometimes unfortunate in my choice of expressions; but you know\n  what I mean. I feel sure you would be happier as my wife.\n\n  LESBIA. I daresay I should, in a frowsy sort of way. But I prefer\n  my dignity and my independence. I'm afraid I think this rage for\n  happiness rather vulgar.\n\n  THE GENERAL. Oh, very well, Lesbia. I shall not ask you again.\n  [He sits down huffily].\n\n  LESBIA. You will, Boxer; but it will be no use. [She also sits\n  down again and puts her hand almost affectionately on his]. Some\n  day I hope to make a friend of you; and then we shall get on very\n  nicely.\n\n  THE GENERAL [starting up again] Ha! I think you are hard, Lesbia.\n  I shall make a fool of myself if I remain here. Alice: I shall go\n  into the garden for a while.\n\n  COLLINS [appearing in the tower] I think everything is in order\n  now, maam.\n\n  THE GENERAL [going to him] Oh, by the way, could you oblige me\n  [the rest of the sentence is lost in a whisper].\n\n  COLLINS. Certainly, General. [He takes out a tobacco pouch and\n  hands it to the General, who takes it and goes into the garden].\n\n  LESBIA. I dont believe theres a man in England who really and\n  truly loves his wife as much as he loves his pipe.\n\n  THE BISHOP. By the way, what has happened to the wedding party?\n\n  SYKES. I dont know. There wasnt a soul in the church when we were\n  married except the pew opener and the curate who did the job.\n\n  EDITH. They had all gone home.\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. But the bridesmaids?\n\n  COLLINS. Me and the beadle have been all over the place in a\n  couple of taxies, maam; and weve collected them all. They were a\n  good deal disappointed on account of their dresses, and thought\n  it rather irregular; but theyve agreed to come to the breakfast.\n  The truth is, theyre wild with curiosity to know how it all\n  happened. The organist held on until the organ was nigh worn out,\n  and himself worse than the organ. He asked me particularly to\n  tell you, my lord, that he held back Mendelssohn till the very\n  last; but when that was gone he thought he might as well go too.\n  So he played God Save The King and cleared out the church. He's\n  coming to the breakfast to explain.\n\n  LEO. Please remember, Collins, that there is no truth whatever\n  in the rumor that I am separated from my husband, or that there\n  is, or ever has been, anything between me and Mr Hotchkiss.\n\n  COLLINS. Bless you, maam! one could always see that. [To Mrs\n  Bridgenorth] Will you receive here or in the hall, maam?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. In the hall. Alfred: you and Boxer must go there\n  and be ready to keep the first arrivals talking till we come. We\n  have to dress Edith. Come, Lesbia: come, Leo: we must all help.\n  Now, Edith. [Lesbia, Leo, and Edith go out through the tower].\n  Collins: we shall want you when Miss Edith's dressed to look over\n  her veil and things and see that theyre all right.\n\n  COLLINS. Yes, maam. Anything you would like mentioned about Miss\n  Lesbia, maam?\n\n  MRS BRIDGENORTH. No. She wont have the General. I think you may\n  take that as final.\n\n  COLLINS. What a pity, maam! A fine lady wasted, maam. [They shake\n  their heads sadly; and Mrs Bridgenorth goes out through the\n  tower].\n\n  THE BISHOP. I'm going to the hall, Collins, to receive. Rejjy: go\n  and tell Boxer; and come both of you to help with the small talk.\n  Come, Cecil. [He goes out through the tower, followed by Sykes].\n\n  REGINALD [to Hotchkiss] Youve always talked a precious lot about\n  behaving like a gentleman. Well, if you think youve behaved like\n  a gentleman to Leo, youre mistaken. And I shall have to take her\n  part, remember that.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I understand. Your doors are closed to me.\n\n  REGINALD [quickly] Oh no. Dont be hasty. I think I should like\n  you to drop in after a while, you know. She gets so cross and\n  upset when theres nobody to liven up the house a bit.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I'll do my best.\n\n  REGINALD [relieved] Righto. You wont mind, old chap, do you?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. It's Fate. Ive touched coal; and my hands are black;\n  but theyre clean. So long, Rejjy. [They shake hands; and Reginald\n  goes into the garden to collect Boxer].\n\n  COLLINS. Excuse me, sir; but do you stay to breakfast? Your name\n  is on one of the covers; and I should like to change it if youre\n  not remaining.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. How do I know? Is my destiny any longer in my own\n  hands? Go: ask SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED.\n\n  COLLINS [awestruck] Has Mrs George taken a fancy to you, sir?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Would she had! Worse, man, worse: Ive taken a fancy to\n  Mrs George.\n\n  COLLINS. Dont despair, sir: if George likes your conversation\n  youll find their house a very pleasant one--livelier than Mr\n  Reginald's was, I daresay.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [calling] Polly.\n\n  COLLINS [promptly] Oh, if it's come to Polly already, sir, I\n  should say you were all right.\n\n  Mrs George appears at the door of the study.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Your brother-in-law wishes to know whether I'm to stay\n  for the wedding breakfast. Tell him.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. He stays, Bill, if he chooses to behave himself.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [to Collins] May I, as a friend of the family, have the\n  privilege of calling you Bill?\n\n  COLLINS. With pleasure, sir, I'm sure, sir.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. My own pet name in the bosom of my family is Sonny.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Why didnt you tell me that before? Sonny is just the\n  name I wanted for you. [She pats his cheek familiarly; he rises\n  abruptly and goes to the hearth, where he throws himself moodily\n  into the railed chair] Bill: I'm not going into the hall until\n  there are enough people there to make a proper little court for\n  me. Send the Beadle for me when you think it looks good enough.\n\n  COLLINS. Right, maam. [He goes out through the tower].\n\n  Mrs George left alone with Hotchkiss and Soames, suddenly puts\n  her hands on Soames's shoulders and bends over him.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. The Bishop said I was to tempt you, Anthony.\n\n  SOAMES [without looking round] Woman: go away.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Anthony:\n                  \"When other lips and other hearts\n                   Their tale of love shall tell\n\n  HOTCHKISS [sardonically]\n                   In language whose excess imparts\n                   The power they feel so well.\n\n  MRS GEORGE.\n                   Though hollow hearts may wear a mask,\n                   Twould break your own to see\n                   In such a moment I but ask\n                   That youll remember me.\"\n  And you will, Anthony. I shall put my spell on you.\n\n  SOAMES. Do you think that a man who has sung the Magnificat and\n  adored the Queen of Heaven has any ears for such trash as that or\n  any eyes for such trash as you--saving your poor little soul's\n  presence. Go home to your duties, woman.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [highly approving his fortitude] Anthony: I adopt you\n  as my father. Thats the talk! Give me a man whose whole life\n  doesnt hang on some scrubby woman in the next street; and I'll\n  never let him go [she slaps him heartily on the back].\n\n  SOAMES. Thats enough. You have another man to talk to. I'm busy.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [leaving Soames and going a step or two nearer\n  Hotchkiss] Why arnt you like him, Sonny? Why do you hang on to a\n  scrubby woman in the next street?\n\n  HOTCHKISS [thoughtfully] I must apologize to Billiter.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Who is Billiter?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. A man who eats rice pudding with a spoon. Ive been\n  eating rice pudding with a spoon ever since I saw you first.[He\n  rises]. We all eat our rice pudding with a spoon, dont we,\n  Soames?\n\n  SOAMES. We are members of one another. There is no need to refer\n  to me. In the first place, I'm busy: in the second, youll find it\n  all in the Church Catechism, which contains most of the new\n  discoveries with which the age is bursting. Of course you should\n  apologize to Billiter. He is your equal. He will go to the same\n  heaven if he behaves himself and to the same hell if he doesnt.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [sitting down] And so will my husband the coal\n  merchant.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. If I were your husband's superior here I should be his\n  superior in heaven or hell: equality lies deeper than that. The\n  coal merchant and I are in love with the same woman. That settles\n  the question for me for ever. [He prowls across the kitchen to\n  the garden door, deep in thought].\n\n  SOAMES. Psha!\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You dont believe in women, do you, Anthony? He might\n  as well say that he and George both like fried fish.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. I do not like fried fish. Dont be low, Polly.\n\n  SOAMES. Woman: do not presume to accuse me of unbelief. And do\n  you, Hotchkiss, not despise this woman's soul because she speaks\n  of fried fish. Some of the victims of the Miraculous Draught of\n  Fishes were fried. And I eat fried fish every Friday and like it.\n  You are as ingrained a snob as ever.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [impatiently] My dear Anthony: I find you merely\n  ridiculous as a preacher, because you keep referring me to places\n  and documents and alleged occurrences in which, as a matter of\n  fact, I dont believe. I dont believe in anything but my own will\n  and my own pride and honor. Your fishes and your catechisms and\n  all the rest of it make a charming poem which you call your\n  faith. It fits you to perfection; but it doesnt fit me. I happen,\n  like Napoleon, to prefer Mohammedanism. [Mrs George, associating\n  Mohammedanism with polygamy, looks at him with quick suspicion].\n  I believe the whole British Empire will adopt a reformed\n  Mohammedanism before the end of the century. The character of\n  Mahomet is congenial to me. I admire him, and share his views of\n  life to a considerable extent. That beats you, you see, Soames.\n  Religion is a great force--the only real motive force in the world;\n  but what you fellows dont understand is that you must get at a man\n  through his own religion and not through yours. Instead of facing\n  that fact, you persist in trying to convert all men to your own\n  little sect, so that you can use it against them afterwards. You\n  are all missionaries and proselytizers trying to uproot the\n  native religion from your neighbor's flowerbeds and plant your\n  own in its place. You would rather let a child perish in\n  ignorance than have it taught by a rival sectary. You can talk to\n  me of the quintessential equality of coal merchants and British\n  officers; and yet you cant see the quintessential equality of all\n  the religions. Who are you, anyhow, that you should know better\n  than Mahomet or Confucius or any of the other Johnnies who have\n  been on this job since the world existed?\n\n  MRS GEORGE [admiring his eloquence] George will like you, Sonny.\n  You should hear him talking about the Church.\n\n  SOAMES. Very well, then: go to your doom, both of you. There is\n  only one religion for me: that which my soul knows to be true;\n  but even irreligion has one tenet; and that is the sacredness of\n  marriage. You two are on the verge of deadly sin. Do you deny\n  that?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. You forget, Anthony: the marriage itself is the deadly\n  sin according to you.\n\n  SOAMES. The question is not now what I believe, but what you\n  believe. Take the vows with me; and give up that woman if you\n  have the strength and the light. But if you are still in the grip\n  of this world, at least respect its institutions. Do you believe\n  in marriage or do you not?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. My soul is utterly free from any such superstition. I\n  solemnly declare that between this woman, as you impolitely call\n  her, and me, I see no barrier that my conscience bids me respect.\n  I loathe the whole marriage morality of the middle classes with\n  all my instincts. If I were an eighteenth century marquis I could\n  feel no more free with regard to a Parisian citizen's wife than I\n  do with regard to Polly. I despise all this domestic purity\n  business as the lowest depth of narrow, selfish, sensual, wife-\n  grabbing vulgarity.\n\n  MRS GEORGE [rising promptly] Oh, indeed. Then youre not coming\n  home with me, young man. I'm sorry; for its refreshing to have\n  met once in my life a man who wasnt frightened by my wedding\n  ring; but I'm looking out for a friend and not for a French\n  marquis; so youre not coming home with me.\n\n  HOTCHKISS [inexorably] Yes, I am.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. No.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Yes. Think again. You know your set pretty well, I\n  suppose, your petty tradesmen's set. You know all its scandals\n  and hypocrisies, its jealousies and squabbles, its hundred of\n  divorce cases that never come into court, as well as its tens\n  that do.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. We're not angels. I know a few scandals; but most of\n  us are too dull to be anything but good.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Then you must have noticed that just an all murderers,\n  judging by their edifying remarks on the scaffold, seem to be\n  devout Christians, so all Christians, both male and female, are\n  invariably people over-flowing with domestic sentimentality and\n  professions of respect for the conventions they violate in\n  secret.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Well, you dont expect them to give themselves away,\n  do you?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. They are people of sentiment, not of honor. Now, I'm\n  not a man of sentiment, but a man of honor. I know well what will\n  happen to me when once I cross the threshold of your husband's\n  house and break bread with him. This marriage bond which I\n  despise will bind me as it never seems to bind the people who\n  believe in it, and whose chief amusement it is to go to the\n  theatres where it is laughed at. Soames: youre a Communist, arnt\n  you?\n\n  SOAMES. I am a Christian. That obliges me to be a Communist.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. And you believe that many of our landed estates were\n  stolen from the Church by Henry the eighth?\n\n  SOAMES. I do not merely believe that: I know it as a lawyer.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Would you steal a turnip from one of the landlords of\n  those stolen lands?\n\n  SOAMES [fencing with the question] They have no right to their\n  lands.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Thats not what I ask you. Would you steal a turnip\n  from one of the fields they have no right to?\n\n  SOAMES. I do not like turnips.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. As you are a lawyer, answer me.\n\n  SOAMES. I admit that I should probably not do so. I should\n  perhaps be wrong not to steal the turnip: I cant defend my\n  reluctance to do so; but I think I should not do so. I know I\n  should not do so.\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Neither shall I be able to steal George's wife. I have\n  stretched out my hand for that forbidden fruit before; and I know\n  that my hand will always come back empty. To disbelieve in\n  marriage is easy: to love a married woman is easy; but to betray\n  a comrade, to be disloyal to a host, to break the covenant of\n  bread and salt, is impossible. You may take me home with you,\n  Polly: you have nothing to fear.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. And nothing to hope?\n\n  HOTCHKISS. Since you put it in that more than kind way, Polly,\n  absolutely nothing.\n\n  MRS GEORGE. Hm! Like most men, you think you know everything a\n  woman wants, dont you? But the thing one wants most has nothing\n  to do with marriage at all. Perhaps Anthony here has a glimmering\n  of it. Eh, Anthony?\n\n  SOAMES. Christian fellowship?\n\n  MRS GEORGE. You call it that, do you?\n\n  SOAMES. What do you call it?\n\n  COLLINS [appearing in the tower with the Beadle]. Now, Polly, the\n  hall's full; and theyre waiting for you.\n\n  THE BEADLE. Make way there, gentlemen, please. Way for the\n  worshipful the Mayoress. If you please, my lords and gentlemen.\n  By your leave, ladies and gentlemen: way for the Mayoress.\n\n  Mrs George takes Hotchkiss's arm, and goes out, preceded by the\n  Beadle.\n\n  Soames resumes his writing tranquilly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Getting Married, by George Bernard Shaw\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GETTING MARRIED ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5604.txt or 5604.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/5\/6\/0\/5604\/\n\nProduced by Eve Sobol and Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":919,"split":"train"}
