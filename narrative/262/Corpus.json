Her mother married him out of ambition rather than love, and despite his evil reputation. Soon after their marriage, he told her that he had a living wife, which made their union invalid and their unborn daughter illegitimate. He then sailed to Italy without her and did not return to England for twenty years.\nDuring those two decades, Lady Lovel struggled to prove the validity of her marriage, and consequently her right to her title and her daughter's legitimacy. She enjoyed neither the sympathy of the public nor the support of her family during this time; her only friend and supporter was Thomas Thwaite, a Radical tailor of Keswick, who gave her and her daughter shelter and financed her legal battles.\nEarly in the novel, Lord Lovel returns to England and dies intestate. His earldom, and a small estate in Cumberland, pass to a distant cousin, young Frederick Lovel. However, the bulk of his large fortune is personal property, and thus not attached to the title. If his marriage to Lady Lovel was valid, it will go to her and to their daughter; otherwise, it will go to the young earl.\nThe new earl's lawyers, headed by the Solicitor General, come to believe that their case against Lady Lovel is weak and their claim probably false. They accordingly propose a compromise: that the earl marry Lady Anna, thus reuniting the title and the assets held by her father. The plan is enthusiastically supported by Lady Lovel, as fulfilling all of her ambitions for herself and her daughter. The young earl is favorably impressed by Lady Anna's appearance and character. However, in her twenty years as an outcast, Lady Anna has come to love Thomas Thwaite's son Daniel, and the two have become secretly engaged.\nWhen the engagement is known, Lady Lovel and others strive to break it. Lady Anna will not yield to persuasion or to mistreatment; Daniel Thwaite rejects arguments and bribes to end the relationship. Lady Anna is approaching her twenty-first birthday, after which she will be free to marry without her mother's consent. In desperation, Lady Lovel secures a pistol and attempts to murder Thwaite. She wounds but does not kill him; Thwaite refuses to name her to the police; and the attempt puts an effective end to her attempts to keep the two apart.\nWith Thwaite's consent, Lady Anna makes half of her fortune over to the young earl. She marries Thwaite with the public approval of the Lovel family, though Lady Lovel refuses to attend the ceremony. The two then emigrate to Australia, where they expect that his low birth and her title will no longer be a burden to them.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Lady Anna, by Anthony Trollope\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

That her marriage was\nvalid according to all the forms of the Church, if Lord Lovel were\nthen capable of marrying, no one ever doubted; nor did the Earl\never allege that it was not so. Lovel Grange is a small house,\nsurrounded by a small domain,--small as being the residence of a rich\nnobleman, lying among the mountains which separate Cumberland from\nWestmoreland, about ten miles from Keswick, very lovely, from the\nbrightness of its own green sward and the luxuriance of its wild\nwoodland, from the contiguity of overhanging mountains, and from the\nbeauty of Lovel Tarn, a small lake belonging to the property, studded\nwith little islands, each of which is covered with its own thicket\nof hollies, birch, and dwarfed oaks. The house itself is poor, ill\nbuilt, with straggling passages and low rooms, and is a sombre,\nill-omened looking place. When Josephine Murray was brought there\nas a bride she thought it to be very sombre and ill-omened; but she\nloved the lakes and mountains, and dreamed of some vague mysterious\njoy of life which was to come to her from the wildness of her\ndomicile.\n\nI fear that she had no other ground, firmer than this, on which to\nfound her hopes of happiness. She could not have thought Lord Lovel\nto be a good man when she married him, and it can hardly be said that\nshe loved him. She was then twenty-four years old, and he had counted\ndouble as many years. She was very beautiful, dark, with large, bold,\nblue eyes, with hair almost black, tall, well made, almost robust, a\nwell-born, brave, ambitious woman, of whom it must be acknowledged\nthat she thought it very much to be the wife of a lord. Though our\nstory will be concerned much with her sufferings, the record of her\nbridal days may be very short. It is with struggles that came to\nher in after years that we shall be most concerned, and the reader,\ntherefore, need be troubled with no long description of Josephine\nMurray as she was when she became the Countess Lovel. It is hoped\nthat her wrongs may be thought worthy of sympathy,--and may be felt\nin some sort to atone for the ignoble motives of her marriage.\n\nThe Earl, when he found his bride, had been living almost in solitude\nfor a twelvemonth. Among the neighbouring gentry in the lake country\nhe kept no friendly relations. His property there was small, and his\ncharacter was evil. He was an English earl, and as such known in\nsome unfamiliar fashion to those who know all earls; but he was a\nman never seen in Parliament, who had spent the greater part of his\nmanhood abroad, who had sold estates in other counties, converting\nunentailed acres into increased wealth, but wealth of a kind much\nless acceptable to the general English aristocrat than that which\ncomes direct from land. Lovel Grange was his only remaining English\nproperty, and when in London he had rooms at an hotel. He never\nentertained, and he never accepted hospitality. It was known of him\nthat he was very rich, and men said that he was mad. Such was the man\nwhom Josephine Murray had chosen to marry because he was an earl.\n\nHe had found her near Keswick, living with her father in a pretty\ncottage looking down upon Derwentwater,--a thorough gentleman, for\nCaptain Murray had come of the right Murrays;--and thence he had\ncarried her to Lovel Grange. She had brought with her no penny of\nfortune, and no settlement had been made on her. Her father, who\nwas then an old man, had mildly expostulated; but the ambition\nof the daughter had prevailed, and the marriage was accomplished.\nThe beautiful young woman was carried off as a bride. It will be\nunnecessary to relate what efforts had been made to take her away\nfrom her father's house without bridal honours; but it must be told\nthat the Earl was a man who had never yet spared a woman in his lust.\nIt had been the rule, almost the creed of his life, that woman was\nmade to gratify the appetite of man, and that the man is but a poor\ncreature who does not lay hold of the sweetness that is offered to\nhim. He had so lived as to teach himself that those men who devote\nthemselves to their wives, as a wife devotes herself to her husband,\nare the poor lubberly clods of creation, who had lacked the power to\nreach the only purpose of living which could make life worth having.\nWomen had been to him a prey, as the fox is a prey to the huntsman\nand the salmon to the angler. But he had acquired great skill in his\nsport, and could pursue his game with all the craft which experience\nwill give. He could look at a woman as though he saw all heaven in\nher eyes, and could listen to her as though the music of the spheres\nwas to be heard in her voice. Then he could whisper words which, to\nmany women, were as the music of the spheres, and he could persevere,\nabandoning all other pleasures, devoting himself to the one\nwickedness with a perseverance which almost made success certain.\nBut with Josephine Murray he could be successful on no other terms\nthan those which enabled her to walk out of the church with him as\nCountess Lovel.\n\nShe had not lived with him six months before he told her that the\nmarriage was no marriage, and that she was--his mistress. There was\nan audacity about the man which threw aside all fear of the law, and\nwhich was impervious to threats and interference. He assured her that\nhe loved her, and that she was welcome to live with him; but that she\nwas not his wife, and that the child which she bore could not be the\nheir to his title, and could claim no heirship to his property. He\ndid love her,--having found her to be a woman of whose company he had\nnot tired in six months. He was going back to Italy, and he offered\nto take her with him,--but he could not, he said, permit the farce of\nher remaining at Lovel Grange and calling herself the Countess Lovel.\nIf she chose to go with him to Palermo, where he had a castle, and to\nremain with him in his yacht, she might for the present travel under\nthe name of his wife. But she must know that she was not his wife.\nShe was only his mistress.\n\nOf course she told her father. Of course she invoked every Murray\nin and out of Scotland. Of course there were many threats. A duel\nwas fought up near London, in which Lord Lovel consented to be shot\nat twice,--declaring that after that he did not think that the\ncircumstances of the case required that he should be shot at any\nmore. In the midst of this a daughter was born to her and her father\ndied,--during which time she was still allowed to live at Lovel\nGrange. But what was it expedient that she should do? He declared\nthat he had a former wife when he married her, and that therefore she\nwas not and could not be his wife. Should she institute a prosecution\nagainst him for bigamy, thereby acknowledging that she was herself\nno wife and that her child was illegitimate? From such evidence as\nshe could get, she believed that the Italian woman whom the Earl in\nformer years had married had died before her own marriage. The Earl\ndeclared that the Countess, the real Countess, had not paid her debt\nto nature, till some months after the little ceremony which had taken\nplace in Applethwaite Church. In a moment of weakness Josephine fell\nat his feet and asked him to renew the ceremony. He stooped over her,\nkissed her, and smiled. \"My pretty child,\" he said, \"why should I do\nthat?\" He never kissed her again.\n\nWhat should she do? Before she had decided, he was in his yacht\nsailing to Palermo;--sailing no doubt not alone. What should she do?\nHe had left her an income,--sufficient for the cast-off mistress\nof an Earl,--some few hundreds a year, on condition that she would\nquietly leave Lovel Grange, cease to call herself a Countess, and\ntake herself and her bairn,--whither she would. Every abode of sin\nin London was open to her for what he cared. But what should she\ndo? It seemed to her to be incredible that so great a wrong should\nbefall her, and that the man should escape from her and be free from\npunishment,--unless she chose to own the baseness of her own position\nby prosecuting him for bigamy. The Murrays were not very generous in\ntheir succour, as the old man had been much blamed for giving his\ndaughter to one of whom all the world knew nothing but evil. One\nMurray had fired two shots on her behalf, in answer to each one of\nwhich the Earl had fired into the air; but beyond this the Murrays\ncould do nothing. Josephine herself was haughty and proud, conscious\nthat her rank was greater than that of any of the Murrays with whom\nshe came in contact. But what should she do?\n\nThe Earl had been gone five years, sailing about the world she knew\nnot where, when at last she determined to institute a prosecution for\nbigamy. During these years she was still living at the Grange, with\nher child, and the Courts of Law had allotted her some sum by way of\nalimony till her cause should be decided; but upon this alimony she\nfound it very difficult to lay her hands,--quite impossible to lay\nher hands upon the entirety of it. And then it came to pass that\nshe was eaten up by lawyers and tradesmen, and fell into bad repute\nas asserting that claims made against her, should legally be made\nagainst the very man whom she was about to prosecute because she was\nnot his wife. And this went on till further life at Lovel Grange\nbecame impossible to her.\n\nIn those days there was living in Keswick a certain Mr. Thomas\nThwaite, a tailor, who by degrees had taken a strong part in\ndenouncing the wrongs to which Lady Lovel had been subjected. He\nwas a powerful, sturdy man, with good means for his position, a\nwell-known Radical in a county in which Radicals have never been\npopular, and in which fifty years ago they were much rarer than they\nare now. At this time Keswick and its vicinities were beginning to be\nknown as the abodes of poets, and Thomas Thwaite was acquainted with\nSouthey and Wordsworth. He was an intelligent, up-standing, impulsive\nman, who thought well of his own position in the world, and who could\nspeak his mind. He was tall, massive, and square; tender-hearted and\nvery generous; and he hated the Earl of Lovel with all his heart.\nOnce the two men had met since the story of the Countess's wrongs\nhad become known, and the tailor had struck the Earl to the ground.\nThis had occurred as the Earl was leaving Lovel Grange, and when he\nwas starting on his long journey. The scene took place after he had\nparted from his Countess,--whom he never was to see again. He rose to\nhis feet and rushed at the tailor; but the two were separated, and\nthe Earl thought it best to go on upon his journey. Nothing further\nwas done as to the blow, and many years rolled by before the Earl\ncame back to Cumberland.\n\nIt became impossible for the Countess and her daughter, the young\nLady Anna as she was usually called, to remain at Lovel Grange,\nand they were taken to the house of Mr. Thwaite, in Keswick, as a\ntemporary residence. At this time the Countess was in debt, and\nalready there were lawsuits as to the practicability of obtaining\npayment of those debts from the husband's estate. And as soon as it\nwas determined that the prosecution for bigamy should be instituted,\nthe confusion in this respect was increased. The Countess ceased to\ncall herself a countess, as she certainly would not be a countess\nshould she succeed in proving the Earl to have been guilty. And\nhad he been guilty of bigamy, the decree under which alimony was\nassigned to her would become void. Should she succeed, she would\nbe a penniless unmarried female with a daughter, her child would\nbe unfathered and base, and he,--as far as she could see,--would be\nbeyond the reach of punishment. But, in truth, she and her friend the\ntailor were not in quest of success. She and all her friends believed\nthat the Earl had committed no such crime. But if he were acquitted,\nthen would her claim to be called Lady Lovel, and to enjoy the\nappanages of her rank, be substantiated. Or, at least, something\nwould have been done towards substantiating those claims. But during\nthis time she called herself Mrs. Murray, and the little Lady Anna\nwas called Anna Murray.\n\nIt added much to the hardship of the woman's case that public\nsympathy in distant parts of the country,--up in London, and in\nsouthern counties, and even among a portion of the gentry in\nCumberland and Westmoreland,--did not go with her. She had married\nwithout due care. Some men said,--and many women repeated the\nstory,--that she had known of the existence of the former wife, when\nshe had married the Earl. She had run into debt, and then repudiated\nher debts. She was now residing in the house of a low radical tailor,\nwho had assaulted the man she called her husband; and she was living\nunder her maiden name. Tales were told of her which were utterly\nfalse,--as when it was said that she drank. Others were reported\nwhich had in them some grains of truth,--as that she was violent,\nstiff-necked, and vindictive. Had they said of her that it had\nbecome her one religion to assert her daughter's right,--per fas aut\nnefas,--to assert it by right or wrong; to do justice to her child\nlet what injustice might be done to herself or others,--then the\ntruth would have been spoken.\n\nThe case dragged itself on slowly, and little Anna Murray was a child\nof nine years old when at last the Earl was acquitted of the criminal\ncharge which had been brought against him. During all this time he\nhad been absent. Even had there been a wish to bring him personally\ninto court, the law would have been powerless to reach him. But there\nwas no such wish. It had been found impossible to prove the former\nmarriage, which had taken place in Sicily;--or if not impossible, at\nleast no adequate proof was forthcoming. There was no real desire\nthat there should be such proof. The Earl's lawyers abstained, as\nfar as they could abstain, from taking any steps in the matter. They\nspent what money was necessary, and the Attorney-General of the day\ndefended him. In doing so, the Attorney-General declared that he had\nnothing to do with the Earl's treatment of the lady who now called\nherself Mrs. Murray. He knew nothing of the circumstances of that\nconnection, and would not travel beyond his brief. He was there to\ndefend Earl Lovel on a charge of bigamy. This he did successfully,\nand the Earl was acquitted. Then, in court, the counsel for the wife\ndeclared that his client would again call herself Lady Lovel.\n\nBut it was not so easy to induce other people to call her Lady Lovel.\n\nAnd now not only was she much hampered by money difficulties, but so\nalso was the tailor. But Thomas Thwaite never for a moment slackened\nin his labours to make good the position of the woman whom he had\ndetermined to succour; and for another and a longer period of eight\nyears the battle went on. It went on very slowly, as is the wont with\nsuch battles; and very little way was made. The world, as a rule, did\nnot believe that she who now again called herself the Countess Lovel\nwas entitled to that name. The Murrays, her own people,--as far as\nthey were her own people,--had been taught to doubt her claim. If\nshe were a countess why had she thrown herself into the arms of an\nold tailor? Why did she let her daughter play with the tailor's\nchild,--if, in truth, that daughter was the Lady Anna? Why, above\nall things, was the name of the Lady Anna allowed to be mentioned,\nas it was mentioned, in connection with that of Daniel Thwaite, the\ntailor's son?\n\nDuring these eight weary years Lady Lovel,--for so she shall be\ncalled,--lived in a small cottage about a mile from Keswick, on the\nroad to Grassmere and Ambleside, which she rented from quarter to\nquarter. She still obtained a certain amount of alimony, which,\nhowever, was dribbled out to her through various sieves, and which\nreached her with protestations as to the impossibility of obtaining\nanything like the moderate sum which had been awarded to her. And\nit came at last to be the case that she hardly knew what she was\nstruggling to obtain. It was, of course, her object that all the\nworld should acknowledge her to be the Countess Lovel, and her\ndaughter to be the Lady Anna. But all the world could not be made to\ndo this by course of law. Nor could the law make her lord come home\nand live with her, even such a cat and dog life as must in such case\nhave been hers. Her money rights were all that she could demand;--and\nshe found it to be impossible to get anybody to tell her what were\nher money rights. To be kept out of the poorhouse seemed to be all\nthat she could claim. But the old tailor was true to her,--swearing\nthat she should even yet become Countess Lovel in very truth.\n\nThen, of a sudden, she heard one day,--that Earl Lovel was again at\nthe Grange, living there with a strange woman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE EARL'S WILL.\n\n\nNot a word had been heard in Keswick of the proposed return of the\nold lord,--for the Earl was now an old man,--past his sixtieth year,\nand in truth with as many signs of age as some men bear at eighty.\nThe life which he had led no doubt had had its allurements, but it\nis one which hardly admits of a hale and happy evening. Men who make\nwomen a prey, prey also on themselves. But there he was, back at\nLovel Grange, and no one knew why he had come, nor whence, nor how.\nTo Lovel Grange in those days, now some forty years ago, there was no\nroad for wheels but that which ran through Keswick. Through Keswick\nhe had passed in the middle of the night, taking on the post-horses\nwhich he had brought with him from Grassmere, so that no one in the\ntown should see him and his companion. But it was soon known that\nhe was there, and known also that he had a companion. For months he\nresided thus, and no one saw him but the domestics who waited upon\nhim. But rumours got abroad as to his conduct, and people through the\ncounty declared that Earl Lovel was a maniac. Still his property was\nin his own control, and he did what it listed him to do.\n\nAs soon as men knew that he was in the land, claim after claim was\nmade upon him for money due on behalf of his wife, and loudest among\nthe claimants was Thomas Thwaite, the tailor. He was loudest and\nfiercest among the claimants, but was loud and fierce not in enmity\nto his old friend the Countess, but with a firm resolve to make the\nlord pay the only price of his wickedness which could be exacted from\nhim. And if the Earl could be made to pay the claims against him\nwhich were made by his wife's creditors, then would the law, so far,\nhave decided that the woman was his wife. No answer was made to any\nletter addressed to the Earl, and no one calling at the Grange could\nobtain speech or even sight of the noble owner. The lord's steward at\nthe Grange referred all comers to the lord's attorneys in London, and\nthe lord's attorneys simply repeated the allegation that the lady was\nnot the lord's wife. At last there came tidings that an inquiry was\nto be made as to the state of the lord's health and the state of the\nlord's mind, on behalf of Frederic Lovel, the distant heir to the\ntitle. Let that question of the lord's marriage with Josephine Murray\ngo as it might, Frederic Lovel, who had never seen his far-away\ncousin, must be the future earl. Of that there was no doubt;--and new\ninquiries were to be made. But it might well be that the interest of\nthe young heir would be more deeply involved in the marriage question\nthan in other matters concerning the family. Lovel Grange and the few\nmountain farms attached to the Cumberland estate must become his, let\nthe frantic Earl do what damage he might to those who bore his name;\nbut the bulk of the property, the wealth of the Lovels, the great\nriches which had enabled this mighty lord to live as a beast of prey\namong his kind, were at his own disposal. He had one child certainly,\nthe Lady Anna, who would inherit it all were the father to die\nintestate, and were the marriage proved. The young heir and those\nnear to him altogether disbelieved the marriage,--as was natural.\nThey had never seen her who now called herself the Countess, but\nwho for some years after her child was born had called herself Mrs.\nMurray,--who had been discarded by her own relations, and had taken\nherself to live with a country tailor. As years had rolled by the\nmemory of what had really occurred in Applethwaite Church had become\nindistinct; and, though the reader knows that that marriage was\ncapable of easy proof,--that there would have been but little\ndifficulty had the only difficulty consisted in proving that,--the\nyoung heir and the distant Lovels were not assured of it. Their\ninterest was adverse, and they were determined to disbelieve. But the\nEarl might, and probably would, leave all his wealth to a stranger.\nHe had never in any way noticed his heir. He cared for none that\nbore his name. Those ties in the world which we call love, and deem\nrespectable, and regard as happy, because they have to do with\nmarriage and blood relationship as established by all laws since\nthe days of Moses, were odious to him and ridiculous in his sight,\nbecause all obligations were distasteful to him,--and all laws,\nexcept those which preserved to him the use of his own money. But now\nthere came up the great question whether he was mad or sane. It was\nat once rumoured that he was about to leave the country, and fly back\nto Sicily. Then it was announced that he was dead.\n\nAnd he was dead. He had died at the age of sixty-seven, in the arms\nof the woman he had brought there. His evil career was over, and his\nsoul had gone to that future life for which he had made it fit by the\nlife he had led here. His body was buried in Applethwaite churchyard,\nin the further corner of which long, straggling valley parish Lovel\nGrange is situated. At his grave there stood no single mourner;--but\nthe young lord was there, of his right, disdaining even to wear a\ncrape band round his hat. But the woman remained shut up in her own\nchamber,--a difficulty to the young lord and his lawyer, who could\nhardly tell the foreigner to pack and begone before the body of her\nlate--lover had been laid in the grave. It had been simply intimated\nto her that on such a date,--within a week from the funeral,--her\npresence in the house could not longer be endured. She had flashed\nround upon the lawyer, who had attempted to make this award known to\nher in broken French, but had answered simply by some words of scorn,\nspoken in Italian to her waiting-maid.\n\nThen the will was read in the presence of the young earl;--for there\nwas a will. Everything that the late lord had possessed was left, in\none line, to his best-beloved friend, the Signorina Camilla Spondi;\nand it was stated, and very fully explained, that Camilla Spondi was\nthe Italian lady living at the Grange at the date on which the will\nwas made. Of the old lord's heir, the now existing Earl Lovel, no\nmention was made whatever. There were, however, two other clauses\nor parts in the will. There was a schedule giving in detail the\nparticulars of the property left to Camilla Spondi; and there was\na rambling statement that the maker of the will acknowledged Anna\nMurray to be his illegitimate daughter,--that Anna Murray's mother\nhad never been the testator's legitimate wife, as his real wife,\nthe true Countess Lovel, for whom he had separately made adequate\nprovision, was still alive in Sicily at the date of that will,--and\nthat by a former will now destroyed he had made provision for\nAnna Murray, which provision he had revoked in consequence of\nthe treatment which he had received from Josephine Murray and\nher friends. They who believed the statements made in this will\nafterwards asserted that Anna had been deprived of her inheritance by\nthe blow with which the tailor had felled the Earl to the earth.\n\nTo Camilla Spondi intimation was given of the contents of the Earl's\nwill as far as they concerned her; but she was told at the same time\nthat no portion of the dead man's wealth would be placed in her hands\ntill the courts should have decided whether or no the old lord had\nbeen sane or insane when he signed the document. A sum of money was,\nhowever, given her, on condition that she should take her immediate\ndeparture;--and she departed. With her personally we need have no\nfurther concern. Of her cause and of her claim some mention must be\nmade; but in a few pages she will drop altogether from our story.\n\nA copy of the will was also sent to the lawyers who had hitherto\ntaken charge of the interests of the repudiated Countess, and it\nwas intimated that the allowance hitherto made to her must now of\nnecessity cease. If she thought fit to prosecute any further claim,\nshe must do so by proving her marriage;--and it was explained to her,\nprobably without much of legal or precise truth in the explanation,\nthat such proof must include the disproving of the assertion made in\nthe Earl's will. As it was the intention of the heir to set aside\nthat will, such assurance was, to say the least of it, disingenuous.\nBut the whole thing had now become so confused that it could hardly\nbe expected that lawyers should be ingenuous in discussing it.\n\nThe young Earl clearly inherited the title and the small estate at\nLovel Grange. The Italian woman was prim\u00c3\u00a2 facie heiress to everything\nelse,--except to such portion of the large personal property as the\nwidow could claim as widow, in the event of her being able to prove\nthat she had been a wife. But in the event of the will being no will,\nthe Italian woman would have nothing. In such case the male heir\nwould have all if the marriage were no marriage;--but would have\nnothing if the marriage could be made good. If the marriage could\nbe made good, the Lady Anna would have the entire property, except\nsuch portion as would be claimed of right by her mother, the widow.\nThus the Italian woman and the young lord were combined in interest\nagainst the mother and daughter as regarded the marriage; and the\nyoung lord and the mother and daughter were combined against the\nItalian woman as regarded the will;--but the young lord had to act\nalone against the Italian woman, and against the mother and daughter\nwhom he and his friends regarded as swindlers and impostors. It was\nfor him to set aside the will in reference to the Italian woman,\nand then to stand the brunt of the assault made upon him by the\nsoi-disant wife.\n\nIn a very short time after the old Earl's death a double compromise\nwas offered on behalf of the young Earl. The money at stake was\nimmense. Would the Italian woman take \u00c2\u00a310,000, and go her way back\nto Italy, renouncing all further claim; and would the soi-disant\nCountess abandon her title, acknowledge her child to be illegitimate,\nand go her way with another \u00c2\u00a310,000;--or with \u00c2\u00a320,000, as was soon\nhinted by the gentlemen acting on the Earl's behalf? The proposition\nwas one somewhat difficult in the making, as the compromise, if made\nwith both, would be excellent, but could not be made to any good\neffect with one only. The young Earl certainly could not afford to\nbuy off the Italian woman for \u00c2\u00a310,000, if the effect of such buying\noff would only be to place the whole of the late lord's wealth in the\nhands of his daughter and of his daughter's mother.\n\nThe Italian woman consented. She declared with Italian energy that\nher late loving friend had never been a day insane; but she knew\nnothing of English laws, and but little of English money. She would\ntake the \u00c2\u00a310,000,--having had a calculation made for her of the\nnumber of lire into which it would run. The number was enormous, and\nshe would take the offer. But when the proposal was mentioned to the\nCountess, and explained to her by her old friend, Thomas Thwaite, who\nhad now become a poor man in her cause, she repudiated it with bitter\nscorn,--with a scorn in which she almost included the old man who\nhad made it to her. \"Is it for that, that I have been fighting?\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"For that in part,\" said the old man.\n\n\"No, Mr. Thwaite, not for that at all; but that my girl may have her\nbirth allowed and her name acknowledged.\"\n\n\"Her name shall be allowed and her birth shall be acknowledged,\" said\nthe tailor, in whose heart there was nothing base. \"She shall be the\nLady Anna, and her mother shall be the Countess Lovel.\" The estate of\nthe Countess, if she had an estate, then owed the tailor some five or\nsix thousand pounds, and the compromise offered would have paid the\ntailor every shilling and have left a comfortable income for the two\nwomen.\n\n\"For myself I care but little,\" said the mother, taking the tailor's\nhand in hers and kissing it. \"My child is the Lady Anna, and I do not\ndare to barter away her rights.\" This took place down at the cottage\nin Cumberland, and the tailor at once went up to London to make known\nthe decision of the Countess,--as he invariably called her.\n\nThen the lawyers went to work. As the double compromise could not be\neffected, the single compromise could not stand. The Italian woman\nraved and stamped, and swore that she must have her half million of\nlire. But of course no right to such a claim had been made good to\nher, and the lawyers on behalf of the young Earl went on with their\nwork. Public sympathy as a matter of course went with the young\nEarl. As against the Italian woman he had with him every English man\nand woman. It was horrible to the minds of English men and English\nwomen that an old English Earldom should be starved in order that\nan Italian harlot might revel in untold riches. It was felt by most\nmen and protested by all women that any sign of madness, be it what\nit might,--however insignificant,--should be held to be sufficient\nagainst such a claimant. Was not the fact that the man had made such\na will in itself sufficient proof of his madness? There were not a\nfew who protested that no further proof could be necessary. But with\nus the law is the same for an Italian harlot and an English widow;\nand it may well be that in its niceties it shall be found kinder to\nthe former than to the latter. But the Earl had been mad, and the\nlaw said that he was mad when he had made his will,--and the Italian\nwoman went away, raging, into obscurity.\n\nThe Italian woman was conquered, and now the battle was open and free\nbetween the young Earl and the claimant Countess. Applications were\nmade on behalf of the Countess for funds from the estate wherewith to\nprove the claim, and to a certain limited amount they were granted.\nSuch had been the life of the late Earl that it was held that the\ncost of all litigation resulting from his misdeeds should be paid\nfrom his estate;--but ready money was wanted, immediate ready\nmoney, to be at the disposal of the Countess to any amount needed\nby her agent, and this was hardly to be obtained. By this time\npublic sympathy ran almost entirely with the Earl. Though it was\nacknowledged that the late lord was mad, and though it had become\na cause of rejoicing that the Italian woman had been sent away\npenniless, howling into obscurity, because of the old man's madness,\nstill it was believed that he had written the truth when he declared\nthat the marriage had been a mock marriage. It would be better for\nthe English world that the young Earl should be a rich man, fit to\ndo honour to his position, fit to marry the daughter of a duke, fit\nto carry on the glory of the English peerage, than that a woman, ill\nreputed in the world, should be established as a Countess, with a\ndaughter dowered with tens of thousands, as to whom it was already\nsaid that she was in love with a tailor's son. Nothing could be more\ntouching, more likely to awaken sympathy, than the manner in which\nJosephine Murray had been carried away in marriage, and then roughly\ntold by the man who should have protected her from every harshly\nblowing wind of heaven, that he had deceived her and that she was not\nhis wife. No usage to which woman had ever been subjected, as has\nbeen said before, was more adapted to elicit compassion and energetic\naid. But nineteen years had now passed by since the deed was done,\nand the facts were forgotten. One energetic friend there still\nwas,--or we may say two, the tailor and his son Daniel. But public\nbelief ran against the Countess, and nobody who was anybody in the\nworld would give her her title. Bets were laid, two and three to one\nagainst her; and it was believed that she was an impostor. The Earl\nhad all the glory of success over his first opponent, and the loud\nboasting of self-confident barristers buoyed up his cause.\n\nBut loud-boasting barristers may nevertheless be wise lawyers, and\nthe question of a compromise was again mooted. If the lady would take\nthirty thousand pounds and vanish, she should have the money clear\nof deduction, and all expenses should be paid. The amount offered\nwas thought to be very liberal, but it did not amount to the annual\nincome that was at stake. It was rejected with scorn. Had it been\nquadrupled, it would have been rejected with equal scorn. The\nloud-boasting barristers were still confident; but--. Though it\nwas never admitted in words still it was felt that there might be\na doubt. What if the contending parties were to join forces, if\nthe Countess-ship of the Countess were to be admitted, and the\nheiress-ship of the Lady Anna, and if the Earl and the Lady Anna were\nto be united in holy wedlock? Might there not be a safe solution from\nfurther difficulty in that way?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nLADY ANNA.\n\n\nThe idea of this further compromise, of this something more than\ncompromise, of this half acknowledgment of their own weakness, came\nfrom Mr. Flick, of the firm of Norton and Flick, the solicitors who\nwere employed in substantiating the Earl's position. When Mr. Flick\nmentioned it to Sir William Patterson, the great barrister, who was\nat that time Solicitor-General and leading counsel on behalf of Lord\nLovel, Sir William Patterson stood aghast and was dismayed. Sir\nWilliam intended to make mince-meat of the Countess. It was said of\nhim that he intended to cross-examine the Countess off her legs,\nright out of her claim, and almost into her grave. He certainly did\nbelieve her to be an impostor, who had not thought herself to be\nentitled to her name when she first assumed it.\n\n\"I should be sorry, Mr. Flick, to be driven to think that anything of\nthat kind could be expedient.\"\n\n\"It would make sure of the fortune to the family,\" said Mr. Flick.\n\n\"And what about our friend, the Countess?\"\n\n\"Let her call herself Countess Lovel, Sir William. That will break no\nbones. As to the formality of her own marriage, there can be no doubt\nabout that.\"\n\n\"We can prove by Grogram that she was told that another wife was\nliving,\" said Sir William. Grogram was an old butler who had been in\nthe old Earl's service for thirty years.\n\n\"I believe we can, Sir William; but--. It is quite clear that we\nshall never get the other wife to come over and face an English jury.\nIt is of no use blinking it. The gentleman whom we have sent over\ndoubts her altogether. That there was a marriage is certain, but\nhe fears that this woman is not the old Countess. There were two\nsisters, and it may be that this was the other sister.\"\n\nSir William was a good deal dismayed, but he recovered himself. The\nstakes were so high that it was quite possible that the gentleman who\nhad been sent over might have been induced to open his eyes to the\npossibility of such personation by overtures from the other side. Sir\nWilliam was of opinion that Mr. Flick himself should go to Sicily. He\nwas not sure that he, Sir William, her Majesty's Solicitor-General,\nwould not make the journey in person. He was by no means disposed to\ngive way. \"They tell me that the girl is no better than she should\nbe,\" he said to Mr. Flick.\n\n\"I don't think so bad as that of her,\" said Mr. Flick.\n\n\"Is she a lady,--or anything like a lady?\"\n\n\"I am told she is very beautiful.\"\n\n\"I dare say;--and so was her mother before her. I never saw a\nhandsomer woman of her age than our friend the Countess. But I could\nnot recommend the young lord to marry an underbred, bad girl, and a\nbastard who claims to be his cousin,--and support my proposition\nmerely on the ground of her looks.\"\n\n\"Thirty-five thousand a year, Sir William!\" pleaded the attorney.\n\n\"I hope we can get the thirty-five thousand a year for our client\nwithout paying so dear for them.\"\n\nIt had been presumed that the real Countess, the original Countess,\nthe Italian lady whom the Earl had married in early life, would be\nbrought over, with properly attested documentary evidence in her\npocket, to prove that she was the existing Countess, and that any\nother Countess must be either an impostor or a deluded dupe. No doubt\nthe old Earl had declared, when first informing Josephine Murray\nthat she was not his wife, that his real wife had died during the\nfew months which had intervened since his mock marriage; but it was\nacknowledged on all sides, that the old Earl had been a villain and a\nliar. It was no part of the duty of the young Earl, or of those who\nacted for him, to defend the character of the old Earl. To wash that\nblackamoor white, or even to make him whity-brown, was not necessary\nto anybody. No one was now concerned to account for his crooked\ncourses. But if it could be shown that he had married the lady in\nItaly,--as to which there was no doubt,--and that the lady was still\nalive, or that she had been alive when the second marriage took\nplace, then the Lady Anna could not inherit the property which had\nbeen freed from the grasp of the Italian mistress. But it seemed that\nthe lady, if she lived, could not be made to come. Mr. Flick did go\nto Sicily, and came back renewing his advice to Sir William that Lord\nLovel should be advised to marry the Lady Anna.\n\nAt this time the Countess, with her daughter, had moved their\nresidence from Keswick up to London, and was living in very humble\nlodgings in a small street turning out of the New Road, near the\nYorkshire Stingo. Old Thomas Thwaite had accompanied them from\nCumberland, but the rooms had been taken for them by his son, Daniel\nThwaite, who was at this time foreman to a somewhat celebrated\ntailor who carried on his business in Wigmore Street; and he, Daniel\nThwaite, had a bedroom in the house in which the Countess lodged. The\narrangement was not a wise one, as reports had already been spread\nabroad as to the partiality of the Lady Anna for the young tailor.\nBut how should she not have been partial both to the father and to\nthe son, feeling as she did that they were the only two men who\nbefriended her cause and her mother's? As to the Countess herself,\nshe, perhaps, alone of all those who interested themselves in her\ndaughter's cause, had heard no word of these insinuations against her\nchild. To her both Thomas and Daniel Thwaite were dear friends, to\nrepay whom for their exertions with lavish generosity,--should the\nmeans to do so ever come within her reach,--was one of the dreams\nof her existence. But she was an ambitious woman, thinking much\nof her rank, thinking much even of the blood of her own ancestors,\nconstantly urgent with her daughter in teaching her the duties\nand privileges of wealth and rank. For the Countess never doubted\nthat she would at last attain success. That the Lady Anna should\nthrow herself away upon Daniel Thwaite did not occur to her as a\npossibility. She had not even dreamed that Daniel Thwaite would\naspire to her daughter's hand. And yet every shop-boy and every\nshop-girl in Keswick had been so saying for the last twelvemonth,\nand rumours which had hitherto been confined to Keswick and its\nneighbourhood, were now common in London. For the case was becoming\none of the celebrated causes of the age, and all the world was\ntalking of the Countess and her daughter. No momentary suspicion had\ncrossed the mind of the Countess till after their arrival in London;\nand then when the suspicion did touch her it was not love that she\nsuspected,--but rather an unbecoming familiarity which she attributed\nto her child's ignorance of the great life which awaited her. \"My\ndear,\" she said one day when Daniel Thwaite had left them, \"you\nshould be less free in your manner with that young man.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, mamma?\" said the daughter, blushing.\n\n\"You had better call him Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"But I have called him Daniel ever since I was born.\"\n\n\"He always calls you Lady Anna.\"\n\n\"Sometimes he does, mamma.\"\n\n\"I never heard him call you anything else,\" said the Countess, almost\nwith indignation. \"It is all very well for the old man, because he is\nan old man and has done so much for us.\"\n\n\"So has Daniel;--quite as much, mamma. They have both done\neverything.\"\n\n\"True; they have both been warm friends; and if ever I forget them\nmay God forget me. I trust that we may both live to show them that\nthey are not forgotten. But it is not fitting that there should exist\nbetween you and him the intimacy of equal positions. You are not and\ncannot be his equal. He has been born to be a tailor, and you are the\ndaughter and heiress of an Earl.\"\n\nThese last words were spoken in a tone that was almost awful to\nthe Lady Anna. She had heard so much of her father's rank and her\nfather's wealth,--rank and wealth which were always to be hers,\nbut which had never as yet reached her, which had been a perpetual\ntrouble to her, and a crushing weight upon her young life, that she\nhad almost learned to hate the title and the claim. Of course it was\na part of the religion of her life that her mother had been duly\nmarried to her father. It was beyond a doubt to her that such was the\ncase. But the constant battling for denied rights, the assumption of\na position which could not be attained, the use of titles which were\nsimply ridiculous in themselves as connected with the kind of life\nwhich she was obliged to lead,--these things had all become odious\nto her. She lacked the ambition which gave her mother strength, and\nwould gladly have become Anna Murray or Anna Lovel, with a girl's\nordinary privilege of loving her lover, had such an easy life been\npossible to her.\n\nIn person she was very lovely, less tall and robust than her mother\nhad been, but with a sweeter, softer face. Her hair was less dark,\nand her eyes were neither blue nor bold. But they were bright and\nsoft and very eloquent, and when laden with tears would have softened\nthe heart,--almost of her father. She was as yet less powerful than\nher mother, both in body and mind, but probably better calculated to\nmake a happy home for a husband and children. She was affectionate,\nself-denying, and feminine. Had that offer of compromise for thirty,\ntwenty, or for ten thousand pounds been made to her, she would have\naccepted it willingly,--caring little for her name, little even for\nfame, so that she might have been happy and quiet, and at liberty to\nthink of a lover as are other girls. In her present condition, how\ncould she have any happy love? She was the Lady Anna Lovel, heir to\na ducal fortune,--but she lived in small close lodgings in Wyndham\nStreet, New Road. She did not believe in the good time coming as did\nher mother. Their enemy was an undoubted Earl, undoubtedly owner of\nLovel Grange of which she had heard all her life. Would it not be\nbetter to take what the young lord chose to give them and to be at\nrest? But she did not dare to express such thoughts to her mother.\nHer mother would have crushed her with a look.\n\n\"I have told Mr. Thwaite,\" the mother said to her daughter, \"what we\nwere saying this morning.\"\n\n\"About his son?\"\n\n\"Yes,--about his son.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma!\"\n\n\"I was bound to do so.\"\n\n\"And what did he say, mamma?\"\n\n\"He did not like it, and told me that he did not like it;--but he\nadmitted that it was true. He admitted that his son was no fitting\nintimate for Lady Anna Lovel.\"\n\n\"What should we have done without him?\"\n\n\"Badly indeed; but that cannot change his duty, or ours. He is\nhelping us to struggle for that which is our own; but he would mar\nhis generosity if he put a taint on that which he is endeavouring to\nrestore to us.\"\n\n\"Put a taint, mamma!\"\n\n\"Yes;--a taint would rest upon your rank if you as Lady Anna Lovel\nwere familiar with Daniel Thwaite as with an equal. His father\nunderstands it, and will speak to him.\"\n\n\"Mamma, Daniel will be very angry.\"\n\n\"Then will he be very unreasonable;--but, Anna, I will not have you\ncall him Daniel any more.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE TAILOR OF KESWICK.\n\n\nOld Thomas Thwaite was at this time up in London about the business\nof the Countess, but had no intention of residing there. He still\nkept his shop in Keswick, and still made coats and trousers for\nCumberland statesmen. He was by no means in a condition to retire\nfrom business, having spent the savings of his life in the cause of\nthe Countess and her daughter. Men had told him that, had he not\nstruck the Earl in the yard of the Crown at Keswick, as horses were\nbeing brought out for the lord's travelling carriage, ample provision\nwould have been made by the rich old sinner for his daughter. That\nmight have been so, or might not, but the saying instigated the\ntailor to further zeal and increased generosity. To oppose an Earl,\neven though it might be on behalf of a Countess, was a joy to him; to\nset wrong right, and to put down cruelty and to relieve distressed\nwomen was the pride of his heart,--especially when his efforts were\nmade in antagonism to one of high rank. And he was a man who would\ncertainly be thorough in his work, though his thoroughness should\nbe ruinous to himself. He had despised the Murrays, who ought to\nhave stuck to their distant cousin, and had exulted in his heart\nat thinking that the world would say how much better and truer had\nbeen the Keswick tailor than the well-born and comparatively wealthy\nScotch relations. And the poets of the lakes, who had not as yet\nbecome altogether Tories, had taken him by the hand and praised him.\nThe rights of the Countess and the wrongs of the Countess had become\nhis life. But he still kept on a diminished business in the north,\nand it was now needful that he should return to Cumberland. He had\nheard that renewed offers of compromise were to be made,--though\nno idea of the proposed marriage between the distant cousins had\nbeen suggested to him. He had been discussing the question of some\ncompromise with the Countess when she spoke to him respecting his\nson; and had recommended that certain terms should, if possible, be\neffected. Let the money be divided, on condition that the marriage\nwere allowed. There could be no difficulty in this if the young\nlord would accede to such an arrangement, as the marriage must\nbe acknowledged unless an adverse party should bring home proof\nfrom Italy to the contrary. The sufficiency of the ceremony in\nApplethwaite Church was incontestable. Let the money be divided, and\nthe Countess be Countess Lovel, and Lady Anna be the Lady Anna to all\nthe world. Old Thomas Thwaite himself had seemed to think that there\nwould be enough of triumph in such a settlement. \"But the woman might\nafterwards be bribed to come over and renew her claim,\" said the\nCountess. \"Unless it be absolutely settled now, they will say when I\nam dead and gone that my daughter has no right to her name.\" Then the\ntailor said that he would make further inquiry how that might be. He\nwas inclined to think that there might be a decision which should be\nabsolute, even though that decision should be reached by compromise\nbetween the now contending parties.\n\nThen the Countess had said her word about Daniel Thwaite the son, and\nThomas Thwaite the father had heard it with ill-concealed anger. To\nfight against an Earl on behalf of the Earl's injured wife had been\nvery sweet to him, but to be checked in his fight because he and his\nwere unfit to associate with the child of that injured wife, was very\nbitter. And yet he had sense to know that what the Countess said to\nhim was true. As far as words went, he admitted the truth; but his\nface was more eloquent than his words, and his face showed plainly\nhis displeasure.\n\n\"It is not of you that I am speaking,\" said the Countess, laying her\nhand upon the old man's sleeve.\n\n\"Daniel is, at any rate, fitter than I,\" said the tailor. \"He has\nbeen educated, and I never was.\"\n\n\"He is as good as gold. It is not of that I speak. You know what I\nmean.\"\n\n\"I know very well what you mean, Lady Lovel.\"\n\n\"I have no friend like you, Mr. Thwaite;--none whom I love as I do\nyou. And next to you is your son. For myself, there is nothing that\nI would not do for him or you;--no service, however menial, that I\nwould not render you with my own hands. There is no limit to the\ngratitude which I owe you. But my girl is young, and if this burden\nof rank and wealth is to be hers,--it is proper that she do honour to\nit.\"\n\n\"And it is not honourable that she should be seen speaking--to a\ntailor?\"\n\n\"Ah,--if you choose to take it so!\"\n\n\"How should I take it? What I say is true. And what you say is true\nalso. I will speak to Daniel.\" But she knew well, as he left her,\nthat his heart was bitter against her.\n\nThe old man did speak to his son, sitting with him up in the bed-room\nover that which the Countess occupied. Old Thomas Thwaite was a\nstrong man, but his son was in some respects stronger. As his father\nhad said of him, he had been educated,--or rather instructed; and\ninstruction leads to the power of thinking. He looked deeper into\nthings than did his father, and was governed by wider and greater\nmotives. His father had been a Radical all his life, guided thereto\nprobably by some early training, and made steadfast in his creed by\nfeelings which induced him to hate the pretensions of an assumed\nsuperiority. Old Thwaite could not endure to think that one man\nshould be considered to be worthier than another because he was\nricher. He would admit the riches, and even the justice of the\nriches,--having been himself, during much of his life, a rich man in\nhis own sphere; but would deny the worthiness; and would adduce, in\nproof of his creed, the unworthiness of certain exalted sinners. The\ncareer of the Earl Lovel had been to him a sure proof of the baseness\nof English aristocracy generally. He had dreams of a republic in\nwhich a tailor might be president or senator, or something almost\nnoble. But no rational scheme of governance among mankind had ever\nentered his mind, and of pure politics he knew no more than the\njourneyman who sat stitching upon his board.\n\nBut Daniel Thwaite was a thoughtful man who had read many books.\nMore's Utopia and Harrington's Oceana, with many a tale written\nin the same spirit, had taught him to believe that a perfect form\nof government, or rather of policy, under which all men might be\nhappy and satisfied, was practicable upon earth, and was to be\nachieved,--not merely by the slow amelioration of mankind under\nGod's fostering ordinances,--but by the continued efforts of good and\nwise men who, by their goodness and wisdom, should be able to make\nthe multitude believe in them. To diminish the distances, not only\nbetween the rich and the poor, but between the high and the low, was\nthe grand political theory upon which his mind was always running.\nHis father was ever thinking of himself and of Earl Lovel; while\nDaniel Thwaite was considering the injustice of the difference\nbetween ten thousand aristocrats and thirty million of people, who\nwere for the most part ignorant and hungry. But it was not that he\nalso had not thoughts of himself. Gradually he had come to learn that\nhe need not have been a tailor's foreman in Wigmore Street had not\nhis father spent on behalf of the Countess Lovel the means by which\nhe, the son, might already have become a master tradesman. And yet\nhe had never begrudged it. He had been as keen as his father in the\ncause. It had been the romance of his life, since his life had been\ncapable of romance;--but with him it had been no respect for the\nrank to which his father was so anxious to restore the Countess,\nno value which he attached to the names claimed by the mother and\nthe daughter. He hated the countess-ship of the Countess, and\nthe ladyship of the Lady Anna. He would fain that they should\nhave abandoned them. They were to him odious signs of iniquitous\npretensions. But he was keen enough to punish and to remedy the\nwickedness of the wicked Earl. He reverenced his father because he\nassaulted the wicked Earl and struck him to the ground. He was heart\nand soul in the cause of the injured wife. And then the one thing on\nearth that was really dear to him was the Lady Anna.\n\nIt had been the romance of his life. They had grown up together as\nplaymates in Cumberland. He had fought scores of battles on her\nbehalf with those who had denied that she was the Lady Anna,--even\nthough he had then hated the title. Boys had jeered him because of\nhis noble little sweetheart, and he had exulted at hearing her so\ncalled. His only sister and his mother had died when he was young,\nand there had been none in the house but his father and himself. As\na boy he had ever been at the cottage of the Countess, and he had\nsworn to Lady Anna a thousand times that he would do and die in her\nservice. Now he was a strong man, and was more devoted to her than\never. It was the great romance of his life. How could it be brought\nto pass that the acknowledged daughter of an Earl, dowered with\nenormous wealth, should become the wife of a tailor? And yet such\nwas his ambition and such his purpose. It was not that he cared for\nher dower. It was not, at any rate, the hope of her dower that had\ninduced him to love her. His passion had grown and his purpose had\nbeen formed before the old Earl had returned for the last time to\nLovel Grange,--when nothing was known of the manner in which his\nwealth might be distributed. That her prospect of riches now joined\nitself to his aspirations it would be an affectation to deny. The man\nwho is insensible to the power which money brings with it must be a\ndolt; and Daniel Thwaite was not a dolt, and was fond of power. But\nhe was proud of heart, and he said to himself over and over again\nthat should it ever come to pass that the possession of the girl was\nto depend on the abandonment of the wealth, the wealth should be\nabandoned without a further thought.\n\nIt may be imagined that with such a man the words which his father\nwould speak to him about the Lady Anna, suggesting the respectful\ndistance with which she should be approached by a tailor's foreman,\nwould be very bitter. They were bitter to the speaker and very bitter\nto him who heard them. \"Daniel,\" said the father, \"this is a queer\nlife you are leading with the Countess and Lady Anna just beneath\nyou, in the same house.\"\n\n\"It was a quiet house for them to come to;--and cheap.\"\n\n\"Quiet enough, and as cheap as any, I dare say;--but I don't know\nwhether it is well that you should be thrown so much with them. They\nare different from us.\" The son looked at his father, but made no\nimmediate reply. \"Our lot has been cast with theirs because of their\ndifficulties,\" continued the old man, \"but the time is coming when we\nhad better stand aloof.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, father?\"\n\n\"I mean that we are tailors, and these people are born nobles.\"\n\n\"They have taken our help, father.\"\n\n\"Well; yes, they have. But it is not for us to say anything of that.\nIt has been given with a heart.\"\n\n\"Certainly with a heart.\"\n\n\"And shall be given to the end. But the end of it will come soon now.\nOne will be a Countess and the other will be the Lady Anna. Are they\nfit associates for such as you and me?\"\n\n\"If you ask me, father, I think they are.\"\n\n\"They don't think so. You may be sure of that.\"\n\n\"Have they said so, father?\"\n\n\"The Countess has said so. She has complained that you call her\ndaughter simply Anna. In future you must give her a handle to\nher name.\" Daniel Thwaite was a dark brown man, with no tinge of\nruddiness about him, a thin spare man, almost swarthy, whose hands\nwere as brown as a nut, and whose cheeks and forehead were brown. But\nnow he blushed up to his eyes. The hue of the blood as it rushed to\nhis face forced itself through the darkness of his visage, and he\nblushed, as such men do blush,--with a look of indignation on his\nface. \"Just call her Lady Anna,\" said the father.\n\n\"The Countess has been complaining of me then?\"\n\n\"She has hinted that her daughter will be injured by your\nfamiliarity, and she is right. I suppose that the Lady Anna Lovel\nought to be treated with deference by a tailor,--even though the\ntailor may have spent his last farthing in her service.\"\n\n\"Do not let us talk about the money, father.\"\n\n\"Well; no. I'd as lief not think about the money either. The world is\nnot ripe yet, Daniel.\"\n\n\"No;--the world is not ripe.\"\n\n\"There must be earls and countesses.\"\n\n\"I see no must in it. There are earls and countesses as there used to\nbe mastodons and other senseless, over-grown brutes roaming miserable\nand hungry through the undrained woods,--cold, comfortless, unwieldy\nthings, which have perished in the general progress. The big things\nhave all to give way to the intellect of those which are more finely\nmade.\"\n\n\"I hope men and women will not give way to bugs and fleas,\" said the\ntailor, who was wont to ridicule his son's philosophy.\n\nThe son was about to explain his theory of the perfected mean size of\nintellectual created beings, when his heart was at the present moment\nfull of Anna Lovel. \"Father,\" he said, \"I think that the Countess\nmight have spared her observations.\"\n\n\"I thought so too;--but as she said it, it was best that I should\ntell you. You'll have to marry some day, and it wouldn't do that you\nshould look there for your sweetheart.\" When the matter was thus\nbrought home to him, Daniel Thwaite would argue it no further. \"It\nwill all come to an end soon,\" continued the old man, \"and it may\nbe that they had better not move till it is settled. They'll divide\nthe money, and there will be enough for both in all conscience. The\nCountess will be the Countess, and the Lady Anna will be the Lady\nAnna; and then there will be no more need of the old tailor from\nKeswick. They will go into another world, and we shall hear from them\nperhaps about Christmas time with a hamper of game, and may be a\nlittle wine, as a gift.\"\n\n\"You do not think that of them, father.\"\n\n\"What else can they do? The lawyers will pay the money, and they\nwill be carried away. They cannot come to our house, nor can we go\nto theirs. I shall leave to-morrow, my boy, at six o'clock; and my\nadvice to you is to trouble them with your presence as little as\npossible. You may be sure that they do not want it.\"\n\nDaniel Thwaite was certainly not disposed to take his father's\nadvice, but then he knew much more than did his father. The above\nscene took place in the evening, when the son's work was done. As he\ncrept down on the following morning by the door of the room in which\nthe two ladies slept, he could not but think of his father's words,\n\"It wouldn't do that you should look there for your sweetheart.\" Why\nshould it not do? But any such advice as that was now too late. He\nhad looked there for his sweetheart. He had spoken, and the girl had\nanswered him. He had held her close to his heart, and had pressed her\nlips to his own, and had called her his Anna, his well-beloved, his\npearl, his treasure; and she,--she had only sighed in his arms, and\nyielded to his embrace. She had wept alone when she thought of it,\nwith a conscious feeling that as she was the Lady Anna there could be\nno happy love between herself and the only youth whom she had known.\nBut when he had spoken, and had clasped her to his heart, she had\nnever dreamed of rebuking him. She had known nothing better than he,\nand desired nothing better than to live with him and to be loved by\nhim. She did not think that it could be possible to know any one\nbetter. This weary, weary title filled her with dismay. Daniel, as\nhe walked along thinking of her embrace, thinking of those kisses,\nand thinking also of his father's caution, swore to himself that the\ndifficulties in his way should never stop him in his course.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nTHE SOLICITOR-GENERAL MAKES A PROPOSITION.\n\n\nWhen Mr. Flick returned from Sicily he was very strongly in favour\nof some compromise. He had seen the so-called Italian Countess,--who\ncertainly was now called Contessa by everybody around her,--and he\ndid not believe that she had ever been married to the old Earl. That\nan Italian lady had been married to the old lord now twenty-five\nyears ago, he did believe,--probably the younger sister of this\nwoman,--and he also believed that this wife had been dead before the\nmarriage at Applethwaite. That was his private opinion. Mr. Flick\nwas, in his way, an honest man,--one who certainly would have taken\nno conscious part in getting up an unjust claim; but he was now\nacting as legal agent for the young Earl, and it was not his business\nto get up evidence for the Earl's opponents. He did think that were\nhe to use all his ingenuity and the funds at his disposal he would\nbe able to reach the real truth in such a manner that it should be\nmade clear and indubitable to an English jury; but if the real truth\nwere adverse to his side, why search for it? He understood that\nthe English Countess would stand her ground on the legality of the\nApplethwaite marriage, and on the acquittal of the old Earl as to the\ncharge of bigamy. The English Countess being firm, so far as that\nground would make her firm, it would in reality be for the other\nside--for the young Earl--to prove a former marriage. The burden of\nthe proof would be with him, and not with the English Countess to\ndisprove it. Disingenuous lawyers--Mr. Flick, who though fairly\nhonest could be disingenuous, among the number--had declared the\ncontrary. But such was the case; and, as money was scarce with the\nCountess and her friends, no attempt had been made on their part to\nbring home evidence from Sicily. All this Mr. Flick knew, and doubted\nhow far it might be wise for him further to disturb that Sicilian\nromance. The Italian Countess, who was a hideous, worn-out old woman,\nprofessing to be forty-four, probably fifty-five, and looking as\nthough she were seventy-seven, would not stir a step towards England.\nShe would swear and had sworn any number of oaths. Documentary\nevidence from herself, from various priests, from servants, and\nfrom neighbours there was in plenty. Mr. Flick learned through his\ninterpreter that a certain old priest ridiculed the idea of there\nbeing a doubt. And there were letters,--letters alleged to have been\nwritten by the Earl to the living wife in the old days, which were\nshown to Mr. Flick. Mr. Flick was an educated man, and knew many\nthings. He knew something of the manufacture of paper, and would not\nlook at the letters after the first touch. It was not for him to get\nup evidence for the other side. The hideous old woman was clamorous\nfor money. The priests were clamorous for money. The neighbours were\nclamorous for money. Had not they all sworn anything that was wanted,\nand were they not to be paid? Some moderate payment was made to the\nhideous, screeching, greedy old woman; some trivial payment--as to\nwhich Mr. Flick was heartily ashamed of himself--was made to the\nold priest; and then Mr. Flick hurried home, fully convinced that\na compromise should be made as to the money, and that the legality\nof the titles claimed by the two English ladies should be allowed.\nIt might be that that hideous hag had once been the Countess Lovel.\nIt certainly was the case that the old Earl in latter years had\nso called her, though he had never once seen her during his last\nresidence in Sicily. It might be that the clumsy fiction of the\nletters had been perpetrated with the view of bolstering up a true\ncase with false evidence. But Mr. Flick thought that there should be\na compromise, and expressed his opinion very plainly to Sir William\nPatterson. \"You mean a marriage,\" said the Solicitor-General. At this\ntime Mr. Hardy, Q.C., the second counsel acting on behalf of the\nEarl, was also present.\n\n\"Not necessarily by a marriage, Sir William. They could divide the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"The girl is not of age,\" said Mr. Hardy.\n\n\"She is barely twenty as yet,\" said Sir William.\n\n\"I think it might be managed on her behalf,\" said the attorney.\n\n\"Who could be empowered to sacrifice her rights?\" said Mr. Hardy, who\nwas a gruff man.\n\n\"We might perhaps contrive to tide it over till she is of age,\" said\nthe Solicitor-General, who was a sweet-mannered, mild man among his\nfriends, though he could cross-examine a witness off his legs,--or\nhers, if the necessity of the case required him to do so.\n\n\"Of course we could do that, Sir William. What is a year in such a\ncase as this?\"\n\n\"Not much among lawyers, is it, Mr. Flick? You think that we\nshouldn't bring our case into court.\"\n\n\"It is a good case, Sir William, no doubt. There's the\nwoman,--Countess, we will call her,--ready to swear, and has sworn,\nthat she was the old Earl's wife. All the people round call her the\nCountess. The Earl undoubtedly used to speak of her as the Countess,\nand send her little dribbles of money, as being his Countess, during\nthe ten years and more after he left Lovel Grange. There is the old\npriest who married them.\"\n\n\"The devil's in it if that is not a good case,\" said Mr. Hardy.\n\n\"Go on, Mr. Flick,\" said the Solicitor-General.\n\n\"I've got all the documentary evidence of course, Sir William.\"\n\n\"Go on, Mr. Flick.\"\n\nMr. Flick scratched his head. \"It's a very heavy interest, Sir\nWilliam.\"\n\n\"No doubt it is. Go on.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I've anything further to say, except that I'd\narrange it if I could. Our client, Sir William, would be in a very\npretty position if he got half the income which is at stake.\"\n\n\"Or the whole with the wife,\" said the Solicitor-General.\n\n\"Or the whole with the wife, Sir William. If he were to lose it all,\nhe'd be,--so to say, nowhere.\"\n\n\"Nowhere at all,\" said the Solicitor-General. \"The entailed property\nisn't worth above a thousand a year.\"\n\n\"I'd make some arrangement,\" said Mr. Flick, whose mind may perhaps\nhave had a not unnatural bend towards his own very large venture\nin this concern. That his bill, including the honorarium of the\nbarristers, would sooner or later be paid out of the estate, he did\nnot doubt;--but a compromise would make the settlement easy and\npleasant.\n\nMr. Hardy was in favour of continued fighting. A keener, honester,\nmore enlightened lawyer than Mr. Hardy did not wear silk at that\nmoment, but he had not the gift of seeing through darkness which\nbelonged to the Solicitor-General. When Mr. Flick told them of the\nstrength of their case, as based on various heads of evidence in\ntheir favour, Mr. Hardy believed Mr. Flick's words and rejected Mr.\nFlick's opinion. He believed in his heart that the English Countess\nwas an impostor, not herself believing in her own claim; and it\nwould be gall and wormwood to him to give to such a one a moiety\nof the wealth which should go to support the ancient dignity and\naristocratic grace of the house of Lovel. He hated compromise and\ndesired justice,--and was a great rather than a successful lawyer.\nSir William had at once perceived that there was something in the\nbackground on which it was his duty to calculate, which he was bound\nto consider,--but with which at the same time it was inexpedient\nthat he should form a closer or more accurate acquaintance. He must\ndo the best he could for his client. Earl Lovel with a thousand\na year, and that probably already embarrassed, would be a poor,\nwretched creature, a mock lord, an earl without the very essence of\nan earldom. But Earl Lovel with fifteen or twenty thousand a year\nwould be as good as most other earls. It would be but the difference\nbetween two powdered footmen and four, between four hunters and\neight, between Belgrave Square and Eaton Place. Sir William, had he\nfelt confident, would of course have preferred the four footmen for\nhis client, and the eight hunters, and Belgrave Square; even though\nthe poor English Countess should have starved, or been fed by the\ntailor's bounty. But he was not confident. He began to think that\nthat wicked old Earl had been too wicked for them all. \"They say\nshe's a very nice girl,\" said Sir William.\n\n\"Very handsome indeed, I'm told,\" said Mr. Flick.\n\n\"And in love with the son of the old tailor from Keswick,\" said Mr.\nHardy.\n\n\"She'll prefer the lord to the tailor for a guinea,\" said Sir\nWilliam.\n\nAnd thus it was decided, after some indecisive fashion, that their\nclient should be sounded as to the expedience of a compromise. It\nwas certain to them that the poor woman would be glad to accept, for\nherself and her daughter, half of the wealth at stake, which half\nwould be to her almost unlimited riches, on the condition that their\nrank was secured to them,--their rank and all the privileges of\nhonest legitimacy. But as to such an arrangement the necessary delay\noffered no doubt a serious impediment, and it was considered that\nthe wisest course would be to propose the marriage. But who should\npropose it, and how should it be proposed? Sir William was quite\nwilling to make the suggestion to the young Lord or the young Lord's\nfamily, whose consent must of course be first obtained; but who\nshould then break the ice to the Countess? \"I suppose we must ask our\nfriend, the Serjeant,\" said Mr. Flick. Serjeant Bluestone was the\nleading counsel for our Countess, and was vehemently energetic in\nthis case. He swore everywhere that the Solicitor-General hadn't a\nleg to stand upon, and that the Solicitor-General knew that he hadn't\na leg. Let them bring that Italian Countess over if they dared. He'd\ncountess her, and discountess her too! Since he had first known the\nEnglish courts of law there had been no case hard as this was hard.\nHad not the old Earl been acquitted of the charge of bigamy, when\nthe unfortunate woman had done her best to free herself from her\nposition? Serjeant Bluestone, who was a very violent man, taking up\nall his cases as though the very holding of a brief opposite to him\nwas an insult to himself, had never before been so violent. \"The\nSerjeant will take it as a surrender,\" said Mr. Flick.\n\n\"We must get round the Serjeant,\" said Sir William. \"There are ladies\nin the Lovel family; we must manage it through them.\" And so it was\narranged by the young Lord's lawyers that an attempt should be made\nto marry him to the heiress.\n\nThe two cousins had never seen each other. Lady Anna had hardly heard\nof Frederic Lovel before her father's death; but, since that, had\nbeen brought up to regard the young Lord as her natural enemy. The\nyoung Lord had been taught from his youth upwards to look upon the\nsoi-disant Countess and her daughter as impostors who would some day\nstrive to rob him of his birthright;--and, in these latter days, as\nimpostors who were hard at work upon their project. And he had been\ntold of the intimacy between the Countess and the old tailor,--and\nalso of that between the so-called Lady Anna and the young tailor. To\nthese distant Lovels,--to Frederic Lovel who had been brought up with\nthe knowledge that he must be the Earl, and to his uncle and aunt\nby whom he had been brought up,--the women down at Keswick had been\nrepresented as vulgar, odious, and disreputable. We all know how\nfirm can be the faith of a family in such matters. The Lovels were\nnot without fear as to the result of the attempt that was being\nmade. They understood quite as well as did Mr. Flick the glory of\nthe position which would attend upon success, and the wretchedness\nattendant upon a pauper earldom. They were nervous enough, and in\nsome moods frightened. But their trust in the justice of their cause\nwas unbounded. The old Earl, whose memory was horrible to them, had\npurposely left two enemies in their way. There had been the Italian\nmistress backed up by the will; and there had been this illegitimate\nchild. The one was vanquished; but the other--! Ah,--it would be bad\nwith them indeed if that enemy could not be vanquished too! They had\noffered \u00c2\u00a330,000 to the enemy; but the enemy would not accept the\nbribe. The idea of ending all their troubles by a marriage had never\noccurred to them. Had Mrs. Lovel been asked about it, she would have\nsaid that Anna Murray,--as she always studiously called the Lady\nAnna, was not fit to be married.\n\nThe young Lord, who a few months after his cousin's death had been\nold enough to take his seat in the House of Peers, was a gayhearted,\nkindly young man, who had been brought home from sea at the age of\ntwenty on the death of an elder brother. Some of the family had\nwished that he should go on with his profession in spite of the\nearldom; but it had been thought unfit that he should be an earl and\na midshipman at the same time, and his cousin's death while he was\nstill on shore settled the question. He was a fair-haired, well-made\nyoung lad, looking like a sailor, and every inch a gentleman.\nHad he believed that the Lady Anna was the Lady Anna, no earthly\nconsideration would have induced him to meddle with the money. Since\nthe old Lord's death, he had lived chiefly with his uncle Charles\nLovel, having passed some two or three months at Lovel Grange with\nhis uncle and aunt. Charles Lovel was a clergyman, with a good living\nat Yoxham, in Yorkshire, who had married a rich wife, a woman with\nsome two thousand a year of her own, and was therefore well to do in\nthe world. His two sons were at Harrow, and he had one other child,\na daughter. With them also lived a Miss Lovel, Aunt Julia,--who was\nsupposed of all the Lovels to be the wisest and most strong-minded.\nThe parson, though a popular man, was not strong-minded. He was\npassionate, loud, generous, affectionate and indiscreet. He was very\nproud of his nephew's position as head of the family,--and very full\nof his nephew's wrongs arising from the fraud of those Murray women.\nHe was a violent Tory, and had heard much of the Keswick Radical. He\nnever doubted for a moment that both old Thwaite and young Thwaite\nwere busy in concocting an enormous scheme of plunder by which to\nenrich themselves. To hear that they had both been convicted and\ntransported was the hope of his life. That a Radical should not be\nworthy of transportation was to him impossible. That a Radical should\nbe honest was to him incredible. But he was a thoroughly humane and\ncharitable man, whose good qualities were as little intelligible to\nold Thomas Thwaite, as were those of Thomas Thwaite to him.\n\nTo whom should the Solicitor-General first break the matter? He\nhad already had some intercourse with the Lovels, and had not\nbeen impressed with a sense of the parson's wisdom. He was a Whig\nSolicitor-General, for there were still Whigs in those days, and\nMr. Lovel had not much liked him. Mr. Flick had seen much of the\nfamily,--having had many interviews with the young lord, with the\nparson, and with Aunt Julia. It was at last settled by Sir William's\nadvice that a letter should be written to Aunt Julia by Mr. Flick,\nsuggesting that she should come up to town.\n\n\"Mr. Lovel will be very angry,\" said Mr. Flick.\n\n\"We must do the best we can for our client,\" said Sir William. The\nletter was written, and Miss Lovel was informed in Mr. Flick's most\ndiscreet style, that as Sir William Patterson was anxious to discuss\na matter concerning Lord Lovel's case in which a woman's voice would\nprobably be of more service than that of a man, perhaps Miss Lovel\nwould not object to the trouble of a journey to London. Miss Lovel\ndid come up, and her brother came with her.\n\nThe interview took place in Sir William's chambers, and no one was\npresent but Sir William, Miss Lovel, and Mr. Flick. Mr. Flick had\nbeen instructed to sit still and say nothing, unless he were asked\na question; and he obeyed his instructions. After some apologies,\nwhich were perhaps too soft and sweet,--and which were by no means\nneeded, as Miss Lovel herself, though very wise, was neither soft nor\nsweet,--the great man thus opened his case. \"This is a very serious\nmatter, Miss Lovel.\"\n\n\"Very serious indeed.\"\n\n\"You can hardly perhaps conceive how great a load of responsibility\nlies upon a lawyer's shoulders, when he has to give advice in such a\ncase as this, when perhaps the prosperity of a whole family may turn\nupon his words.\"\n\n\"He can only do his best.\"\n\n\"Ah yes, Miss Lovel. That is easy to say; but how shall he know what\nis the best?\"\n\n\"I suppose the truth will prevail at last. It is impossible to think\nthat a young man such as my nephew should be swindled out of a noble\nfortune by the intrigues of two such women as these. I can't believe\nit, and I won't believe it. Of course I am only a woman, but I always\nthought it wrong to offer them even a shilling.\" Sir William smiled\nand rubbed his head, fixing his eyes on those of the lady. Though he\nsmiled she could see that there was real sadness in his face. \"You\ndon't mean to say you doubt?\" she said.\n\n\"Indeed I do.\"\n\n\"You think that a wicked scheme like this can succeed before an\nEnglish judge?\"\n\n\"But if the scheme be not wicked? Let me tell you one or two things,\nMiss Lovel;--or rather my own private opinion on one or two points.\nI do not believe that these two ladies are swindlers.\"\n\n\"They are not ladies, and I feel sure that they are swindlers,\"\nsaid Miss Lovel very firmly, turning her face as she spoke to the\nattorney.\n\n\"I am telling you, of course, merely my own opinion, and I will\nbeg you to believe of me that in forming it I have used all the\nexperience and all the caution which a long course of practice in\nthese matters has taught me. Your nephew is entitled to my best\nservices, and at the present moment I can perhaps do my duty to him\nmost thoroughly by asking you to listen to me.\" The lady closed her\nlips together, and sat silent. \"Whether Mrs. Murray, as we have\nhitherto called her, was or was not the legal wife of the late Earl,\nI will not just now express an opinion; but I am sure that she thinks\nthat she was. The marriage was formal and accurate. The Earl was\ntried for bigamy, and acquitted. The people with whom we have to\ndo across the water, in Sicily, are not respectable. They cannot\nbe induced to come here to give evidence. An English jury will be\nnaturally averse to them. The question is one simply of facts for\na jury, and we cannot go beyond a jury. Had the daughter been a\nson, it would have been in the House of Lords to decide which young\nman should be the peer;--but, as it is, it is simply a question of\nproperty, and of facts as to the ownership of the property. Should we\nlose the case, your nephew would be--a very poor man.\"\n\n\"A very poor man, indeed, Sir William.\"\n\n\"His position would be distressing. I am bound to say that we should\ngo into court to try the case with very great distrust. Mr. Flick\nquite agrees with me.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Sir William,\" said Mr. Flick.\n\nMiss Lovel again looked at the attorney, closed her lips tighter than\never, but did not say a word.\n\n\"In such cases as this prejudices will arise, Miss Lovel. It is\nnatural that you and your family should be prejudiced against these\nladies. For myself, I am not aware that anything true can be alleged\nagainst them.\"\n\n\"The girl has disgraced herself with a tailor's son,\" almost screamed\nMiss Lovel.\n\n\"You have been told so, but I do not believe it to be true. They\nwere, no doubt, brought up as children together; and Mr. Thwaite has\nbeen most kind to both the ladies.\" It at once occurred to Miss Lovel\nthat Sir William was a Whig, and that there was in truth but little\ndifference between a Whig and a Radical. To be at heart a gentleman,\nor at heart a lady, it was, to her thinking, necessary to be a Tory.\n\"It would be a thousand pities that so noble a property should pass\nout of a family which, by its very splendour and ancient nobility,\nis placed in need of ample means.\" On hearing this sentiment, which\nmight have become even a Tory, Miss Lovel relaxed somewhat the\nmuscles of her face. \"Were the Earl to marry his cousin--\"\n\n\"She is not his cousin.\"\n\n\"Were the Earl to marry the young lady who, it may be, will be proved\nto be his cousin, the whole difficulty would be cleared away.\"\n\n\"Marry her!\"\n\n\"I am told that she is very lovely, and that pains have been taken\nwith her education. Her mother was well born and well bred. If you\nwould get at the truth, Miss Lovel, you must teach yourself to\nbelieve that they are not swindlers. They are no more swindlers than\nI am a swindler. I will go further,--though perhaps you, and the\nyoung Earl, and Mr. Flick, may think me unfit to be intrusted any\nlonger with this case, after such a declaration,--I believe, though\nit is with a doubting belief, that the elder lady is the Countess\nLovel, and that her daughter is the legitimate child and the heir of\nthe late Earl.\"\n\nMr. Flick sat with his mouth open as he heard this,--beating his\nbreast almost with despair. His opinion tallied exactly with Sir\nWilliam's. Indeed, it was by his opinion, hardly expressed, but\nperfectly understood, that Sir William had been led. But he had not\nthought that Sir William would be so bold and candid.\n\n\"You believe that Anna Murray is the real heir?\" gasped Miss Lovel.\n\n\"I do,--with a doubting belief. I am inclined that way,--having to\nform my opinion on very conflicting evidence.\" Mr. Flick was by this\ntime quite sure that Sir William was right, in his opinion,--though\nperhaps wrong in declaring it,--having been corroborated in his own\nbelief by the reflex of it on a mind more powerful than his own.\n\"Thinking as I do,\" continued Sir William,--\"with a natural bias\ntowards my own client,--what will a jury think, who will have no such\nbias? If they are cousins,--distant cousins,--why should they not\nmarry and be happy, one bringing the title, and the other the wealth?\nThere could be no more rational union, Miss Lovel.\"\n\nThen there was a long pause before any one spoke a word. Mr. Flick\nhad been forbidden to speak, and Sir William, having made his\nproposition, was determined to await the lady's reply. The lady was\naghast, and for awhile could neither think nor utter a word. At last\nshe opened her mouth. \"I must speak to my brother about this.\"\n\n\"Quite right, Miss Lovel.\"\n\n\"Now I may go, Sir William?\"\n\n\"Good morning, Miss Lovel.\" And Miss Lovel went.\n\n\"You have gone farther than I thought you would, Sir William,\" said\nMr. Flick.\n\n\"I hardly went far enough, Mr. Flick. We must go farther yet if we\nmean to save any part of the property for the young man. What should\nwe gain, even if we succeeded in proving that the Earl was married\nin early life to the old Sicilian hag that still lives? She would\ninherit the property then;--not the Earl.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nYOXHAM RECTORY.\n\n\nMiss Lovel, wise and strong-minded as she was, did not dare to come\nto any decision on the proposition made to her without consulting\nsome one. Strong as she was, she found herself at once to be too weak\nto speak to her nephew on the subject of her late interview with\nthe great lawyer without asking her brother's opinion. The parson\nhad accompanied her up to London, in a state of wrath against Sir\nWilliam, in that he had not been sent for instead of his sister, and\nto him she told all that had been said. Her brother was away at his\nclub when she got back to her hotel, and she had some hours in which\nto think of what had taken place. She could not at once bring herself\nto believe that all her former beliefs were vain and ill founded.\n\nBut if the opinion of the Solicitor-General had not prevailed with\nher, it prevailed still less when it reached her brother second-hand.\nShe had been shaken, but Mr. Lovel at first was not shaken at all.\nSir William was a Whig and a traitor. He had never known a Whig who\nwas not a traitor. Sir William was throwing them over. The Murray\npeople, who were all Whigs, had got hold of him. He, Mr. Lovel, would\ngo at once to Mr. Hardy, and tell Mr. Hardy what he thought. The\ncase should be immediately taken out of the hands of Messrs. Norton\nand Flick. Did not all the world know that these impostors were\nimpostors? Sir William should be exposed and degraded,--though,\nin regard to this threatened degradation, Mr. Lovel was almost of\nopinion that his party would like their Solicitor-General better for\nhaving shown himself to be a traitor, and therefore proved himself to\nbe a good Whig. He stormed and flew about the room, using language\nwhich hardly became his cloth. If his nephew married the girl, he\nwould never own his nephew again. If that swindle was to prevail,\nlet his nephew be poor and honest. He would give half of all he had\ntowards supporting the peerage, and was sure that his boys would\nthank him for what he had done. But they should never call that woman\ncousin; and as for himself, might his tongue be blistered if ever he\nspoke of either of those women as Countess Lovel. He was inclined\nto think that the whole case should immediately be taken out of\nthe hands of Norton and Flick, without further notice, and another\nsolicitor employed. But at last he consented to call on Mr. Norton on\nthe following morning.\n\nMr. Norton was a heavy, honest old man, who attended to simple\nconveyancing, and sat amidst the tin boxes of his broad-acred\nclients. He had no alternative but to send for Mr. Flick, and Mr.\nFlick came. When Mr. Lovel showed his anger, Mr. Flick became\nsomewhat indignant. Mr. Flick knew how to assert himself, and Mr.\nLovel was not quite the same man in the lawyer's chambers that\nhe had been in his own parlour at the hotel. Mr. Flick was of\nopinion that no better counsel was to be had in England than the\nSolicitor-General, and no opinion more worthy of trust than his. If\nthe Earl chose to put his case into other hands, of course he could\ndo so, but it would behove his lordship to be very careful lest he\nshould prejudice most important interests by showing his own weakness\nto his opponents. Mr. Flick spoke in the interests of his client,--so\nhe said,--and not in his own. Mr. Flick was clearly of opinion that a\ncompromise should be arranged; and having given that opinion, could\nsay nothing more on the present occasion. On the next day the young\nEarl saw Mr. Flick, and also saw Sir William, and was then told by\nhis aunt of the proposition which had been made. The parson retired\nto Yoxham, and Miss Lovel remained in London with her nephew. By\nthe end of the week Miss Lovel was brought round to think that some\ncompromise was expedient. All this took place in May. The cause had\nbeen fixed for trial in the following November, the long interval\nhaving been allowed because of the difficulty expected in producing\nthe evidence necessary for rebutting the claims of the late Earl's\ndaughter.\n\nBy the middle of June all the Lovels were again in London,--the\nparson, his sister, the parson's wife, and the Earl. \"I never saw the\nyoung woman in my life,\" said the Earl to his aunt.\n\n\"As for that,\" said his aunt, \"no doubt you could see her if you\nthought it wise to do so.\"\n\n\"I suppose she might be asked to the rectory?\" said Mrs. Lovel.\n\n\"That would be giving up altogether,\" said the rector.\n\n\"Sir William said that it would not be against us at all,\" said Aunt\nJulia.\n\n\"You would have to call her Lady Anna,\" said Mrs. Lovel.\n\n\"I couldn't do it,\" said the rector. \"It would be much better to give\nher half.\"\n\n\"But why should she take the half if the whole belongs to her?\" said\nthe young lord. \"And why should I ask even for the half if nothing\nbelongs to me?\" At this time the young lord had become almost\ndespondent as to his alleged rights, and now and again had made\neverybody belonging to him miserable by talking of withdrawing from\nhis claim. He had come to understand that Sir William believed that\nthe daughter was the real heir, and he thought that Sir William must\nknow better than others. He was down-hearted and low in spirits, but\nnot the less determined to be just in all that he did.\n\n\"I have made inquiry,\" said Aunt Julia, \"and I do believe that the\nstories which we heard against the girl were untrue.\"\n\n\"The tailor and his son have been their most intimate friends,\" said\nMr. Lovel.\n\n\"Because they had none others,\" said Mrs. Lovel.\n\nIt had been settled that by the 24th of June the lord was to say\nwhether he would or would not take Sir William's advice. If he would\ndo so, Sir William was to suggest what step should next be taken as\nto making the necessary overtures to the two ladies. If he would not,\nthen Sir William was to advise how best the case might be carried\non. They were all again at Yoxham that day, and the necessary\ncommunication was to be made to Mr. Flick by post. The young man\nhad been alone the whole morning thinking of his condition, and\nundoubtedly the desire for the money had grown on him strongly. Why\nshould it not have done so? Is there a nobleman in Great Britain who\ncan say that he could lose the fortune which he possesses or the\nfortune which he expects without an agony that would almost break his\nheart? Young Lord Lovel sighed for the wealth without which his title\nwould only be to him a terrible burden, and yet he was resolved that\nhe would take no part in anything that was unjust. This girl, he\nheard, was beautiful and soft and pleasant, and now they told him\nthat the evil things which had been reported against her had been\nslanders. He was assured that she was neither coarse, nor vulgar, nor\nunmaidenly. Two or three old men, of equal rank with his own,--men\nwho had been his father's friends and were allied to the Lovels, and\nhad been taken into confidence by Sir William,--told him that the\nproper way out of the difficulty had been suggested to him. There\ncould be nothing, they said, more fitting than that two cousins so\nsituated should marry. With such an acknowledgment of her rank and\nbirth everybody would visit his wife. There was not a countess or a\nduchess in London who would not be willing to take her by the hand.\nHis two aunts had gradually given way, and it was clear to him that\nhis uncle would give way,--even his uncle,--if he would but yield\nhimself. It was explained to him that if the girl came to Yoxham,\nwith the privilege of being called Lady Anna by the inhabitants of\nthe rectory, she would of course do so on the understanding that she\nshould accept her cousin's hand. \"But she might not like me,\" said\nthe young Earl to his aunt.\n\n\"Not like you!\" said Mrs. Lovel, putting her hand up to his brow and\npushing away his hair. Was it possible that any girl should not like\nsuch a man as that, and he an earl?\n\n\"And if I did not like her, Aunt Lovel?\"\n\n\"Then I would not ask her to be my wife.\" He thought that there\nwas an injustice in this, and yet before the day was over he had\nassented.\n\n\"I do not think that I can call her Lady Anna,\" said the rector. \"I\ndon't think I can bring my tongue to do it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE SOLICITOR-GENERAL PERSEVERES.\n\n\nThere was considerable difficulty in making the overture to the\ntwo ladies,--or rather in making it to the elder lady; for the\nsuggestion, if made to the daughter, must of course come to her from\nher mother. It had been decided at last that the Lady Anna could not\nbe invited to the rectory till it had been positively settled that\nshe should be the Lady Anna without further opposition; and that all\nopposition to the claim should be withdrawn, at any rate till it was\nfound that the young people were not inclined to be engaged to each\nother. \"How can I call her Lady Anna before I have made up my mind to\nthink that she is Lady Anna?\" said the parson, almost in tears. As to\nthe rest of the family, it may be said that they had come silently to\nthink that the Countess was the Countess and that the Lady Anna was\nthe Lady Anna;--silently in reference to each other, for not one of\nthem except the young lord had positively owned to such a conviction.\nSir William Patterson had been too strong for them. It was true that\nhe was a Whig. It was possible that he was a traitor. But he was a\nman of might, and his opinion had domineered over theirs. To make\nthings as straight as they could be made it would be well that the\nyoung people should be married. What would be the Earldom of Lovel\nwithout the wealth which the old mad Earl had amassed?\n\nSir William and Mr. Flick were strongly in favour of the marriage,\nand Mr. Hardy at last assented. The worst of it was that something of\nall this doubt on the part of the Earl and his friends was sure to\nreach the opposite party. \"They are shaking in their shoes,\" Serjeant\nBluestone said to his junior counsel, Mr. Mainsail. \"I do believe\nthey are not going to fight at all,\" he said to Mr. Goffe, the\nattorney for the Countess. Mr. Mainsail rubbed his hands. Mr. Goffe\nshook his head. Mr. Goffe was sure that they would fight. Mr.\nMainsail, who had worked like a horse in getting up and arranging all\nthe evidence on behalf of the Countess, and in sifting, as best he\nmight, the Italian documents, was delighted. All this Sir William\nfeared, and he felt that it was quite possible that the Earl's\noverture might be rejected because the Earl would not be thought to\nbe worth having. \"We must count upon his coronet,\" said Sir William\nto Mr. Flick. \"She could not do better even if the property were\nundoubtedly her own.\"\n\nBut how was the first suggestion to be made? Mr. Hardy was anxious\nthat everything should be straightforward,--and Sir William assented,\nwith a certain inward peevishness at Mr. Hardy's stiff-necked\npropriety. Sir William was anxious to settle the thing comfortably\nfor all parties. Mr. Hardy was determined not only that right should\nbe done, but also that it should be done in a righteous manner. The\ngreat question now was whether they could approach the widow and her\ndaughter otherwise than through Serjeant Bluestone. \"The Serjeant is\nsuch a blunderbuss,\" said the Solicitor-General. But the Serjeant\nwas counsel for these ladies, and it was at last settled that there\nshould be a general conference at Sir William's chambers. A very\nshort note was written by Mr. Flick to Mr. Goffe, stating that the\nSolicitor-General thought that a meeting might be for the advantage\nof all parties;--and the meeting was arranged. There were present\nthe two barristers and the one attorney for each side, and many an\nanxious thought was given to the manner in which the meeting should\nbe conducted. Serjeant Bluestone was fully resolved that he would\nhold his own against the Solicitor-General, and would speak his mind\nfreely. Mr. Mainsail got up little telling questions. Mr. Goffe and\nMr. Flick both felt that it would behove them to hold their peace,\nunless questioned, but were equally determined to hang fast by their\nclients. Mr. Hardy in his heart of hearts thought that his learned\nfriend was about to fling away his case. Sir William had quite\nmade up his mind as to his line of action. He seated them all most\ncourteously, giving them place according to their rank,--a great\narm-chair for Serjeant Bluestone, from which the Serjeant would\nhardly be able to use his arms with his accustomed energy,--and then\nhe began at once. \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"it would be a great pity\nthat this property should be wasted.\"\n\n\"No fear of that, Mr. Solicitor,\" said the Serjeant.\n\n\"It would be a great pity that this property should be wasted,\"\nrepeated Sir William, bowing to the Serjeant, \"and I am disposed to\nthink that the best thing the two young people can do is to marry\neach other.\" Then he paused, and the three gentlemen opposite sat\nerect, the barristers as speechless as the attorneys. But the\nSolicitor-General had nothing to add. He had made his proposition,\nand was desirous of seeing what effect it might have before he spoke\nanother word.\n\n\"Then you acknowledge the Countess's marriage, of course,\" said the\nSerjeant.\n\n\"Pardon me, Serjeant, we acknowledge nothing. As a matter of course\nshe is the Countess till it be proved that another wife was living\nwhen she was married.\"\n\n\"Quite as a matter of course,\" said the Serjeant.\n\n\"Quite as a matter of course, if that will make the case stronger,\"\ncontinued Sir William. \"Her marriage was formal and regular. That she\nbelieved her marriage to be a righteous marriage before God, I have\nnever doubted. God forbid that I should have a harsh thought against\na poor lady who has suffered so much cruel treatment.\"\n\n\"Why have things been said then?\" asked the Serjeant, beginning to\nthrow about his left arm.\n\n\"If I am not mistaken,\" said Mr. Mainsail, \"evidence has been\nprepared to show that the Countess is a party to a contemplated\nfraud.\"\n\n\"Then you are mistaken, Mr. Mainsail,\" said Sir William. \"I admit\nat once and clearly that the lady is not suspected of any fraud.\nWhether she be actually the Countess Lovel or not it may,--I fear\nit must,--take years to prove, if the law be allowed to take its\ncourse.\"\n\n\"We think that we can dispose of any counter-claim in much less time\nthan that,\" said the Serjeant.\n\n\"It may be so. I myself think that it would not be so. Our\nevidence in favour of the lady, who is now living some two leagues\nout of Palermo, is very strong. She is a poor creature, old,\nignorant,--fairly well off through the bounty of the late Earl,\nbut always craving for some trifle more,--unwilling to come to\nthis country,--childless, and altogether indifferent to the second\nmarriage, except in so far as might interfere with her hopes of\ngetting some further subsidy from the Lovel family. One is not\nvery anxious on her behalf. One is only anxious,--can only be\nanxious,--that the vast property at stake should not get into\nimproper hands.\"\n\n\"And that justice should be done,\" said Mr. Hardy.\n\n\"And that justice should be done of course, as my friend observes.\nHere is a young man who is undoubtedly Earl of Lovel, and who claims\na property as heir to the late Earl. And here is a young lady, I am\ntold very beautiful and highly educated, who is the daughter of the\nlate Earl, and who claims that property believing herself to be his\nlegitimate heiress. The question between them is most intricate.\"\n\n\"The onus probandi lies with you, Mr. Solicitor,\" said the Serjeant.\n\n\"We acknowledge that it does, but the case on that account is none\nthe less intricate. With the view of avoiding litigation and expense,\nand in the certainty that by such an arrangement the enjoyment of the\nproperty will fall to the right owner, we propose that steps shall be\ntaken to bring these two young people together. The lady, whom for\nthe occasion I am quite willing to call the Countess, the mother of\nthe lady whom I hope the young Earl will make his own Countess, has\nnot been sounded on this subject.\"\n\n\"I should hope not,\" said the Serjeant.\n\n\"My excellent friend takes me up a little short,\" said Sir William,\nlaughing. \"You gentlemen will probably consult together on the\nsubject, and whatever may be the advice which you shall consider it\nto be your duty to give to the mother,--and I am sure that you will\nfeel bound to let her know the proposition that has been made; I do\nnot hesitate to say that we have a right to expect that it shall be\nmade known to her,--I need hardly remark that were the young lady to\naccept the young lord's hand we should all be in a boat together in\nreference to the mother's rank, and to the widow's claim upon the\npersonal property left behind him by her late husband.\"\n\nAnd so the Solicitor-General had made his proposition, and the\nconference was broken up with a promise that Mr. Flick should hear\nfrom Mr. Goffe upon the subject. But the Serjeant had at once made\nup his mind against the compromise now proposed. He desired the\ndanger and the dust and the glory of the battle. He was true to his\nclients' interests, no doubt,--intended to be intensely true; but the\npersonal, doggish love of fighting prevailed in the man, and he was\nclear as to the necessity of going on. \"They know they are beat,\" he\nsaid to Mr. Goffe. \"Mr. Solicitor knows as well as I do that he has\nnot an inch of ground under his feet.\" Therefore Mr. Goffe wrote the\nfollowing letter to Messrs. Norton and Flick:--\n\n\n   Raymond's Buildings, Gray's Inn,\n   1st July, 183--.\n\n   DEAR SIRS,\n\n   In reference to the interview which took place at the\n   chambers of the Solicitor-General on the 27th ult., we\n   are to inform you that we are not disposed, as acting for\n   our clients, the Countess of Lovel and her daughter the\n   Lady Anna Lovel, to listen to the proposition then made.\n   Apart from the very strong feeling we entertain as to the\n   certainty of our client's success,--which certainly was\n   not weakened by what we heard on that occasion,--we are\n   of opinion that we could not interfere with propriety in\n   suggesting the marriage of two young persons who have not\n   as yet had any opportunity of becoming acquainted with\n   each other. Should the Earl of Lovel seek the hand of\n   his cousin, the Lady Anna Lovel, and marry her with the\n   consent of the Countess, we should be delighted at such\n   a family arrangement; but we do not think that we, as\n   lawyers,--or, if we may be allowed to say so, that you as\n   lawyers,--have anything to do with such a matter.\n\n   We are, dear Sirs,\n   Yours very faithfully,\n\n   GOFFE AND GOFFE.\n\n   Messrs. Norton and Flick.\n\n\n\"Balderdash!\" said Sir William, when he had read the letter. \"We are\nnot going to be done in that way. It was all very well going to that\nSerjeant as he has the case in hand, though a worse messenger in an\naffair of love--\"\n\n\"Not love, as yet, Mr. Solicitor,\" said Mr. Flick.\n\n\"I mean it to be love, and I'm not going to be put off by Serjeant\nBluestone. We must get to the lady by some other means. Do you write\nto that tailor down at Keswick, and say that you want to see him.\"\n\n\"Will that be regular, Sir William?\"\n\n\"I'll stand the racket, Mr. Flick.\" Mr. Flick did write to Thomas\nThwaite, and Thomas Thwaite came up to London and called at Mr.\nFlick's chambers.\n\nWhen Thomas Thwaite received his commission he was much rejoiced.\nInjustice would be done him unless so much were owned on his behalf.\nBut, nevertheless, some feeling of disappointment which he could not\nanalyze crept across his heart. If once the girl were married to Earl\nLovel there would be an end of his services and of his son's. He had\nnever really entertained an idea that his son would marry the girl.\nAs the reader will perhaps remember, he had warned his son that he\nmust seek a sweetheart elsewhere. He had told himself over and over\nagain that when the Countess came to her own there must be an end of\nthis intimacy,--that there could be nothing in common between him,\nthe radical tailor of Keswick, and a really established Countess.\nThe Countess, while not yet really established, had already begged\nthat his son might be instructed not to call her daughter simply by\nher Christian name. Old Thwaite on receiving this intimation of the\ndifference of their positions, though he had acknowledged its truth,\nhad felt himself bitterly aggrieved, and now the moment had come. Of\ncourse the Countess would grasp at such an offer. Of course it would\ngive her all that she had desired, and much more than she expected.\nIn adjusting his feelings on the occasion the tailor thought but\nlittle of the girl herself. Why should she not be satisfied? Of the\nyoung Earl he had only heard that he was a handsome, modest, gallant\nlad, who only wanted a fortune to make him one of the most popular\nof the golden youth of England. Why should not the girl rejoice\nat the prospect of winning such a husband? To have a husband must\nnecessarily be in her heart, whether she were the Lady Anna Lovel,\nor plain Anna Murray. And what espousals could be so auspicious as\nthese? Feeling all this, without much of calculation, the tailor said\nthat he would do as he was bidden. \"We have sent for you because we\nknow that you have been so old a friend,\" said Mr. Flick, who did\nnot quite approve of the emissary whom he had been instructed by Sir\nWilliam to employ.\n\n\"I will do my best, sir,\" said Mr. Thwaite, making his bow. Thomas\nThwaite, as he went along the streets alone, determined that he would\nperform this new duty imposed upon him without any reference to his\nson.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nIMPOSSIBLE!\n\n\n\"They sent for me, Lady Lovel, to bid me come to your ladyship and\nask your ladyship whether you would consent to a marriage between\nthe two young people.\" It was thus that the tailor repeated for the\nsecond time the message which had been confided to him, showing the\ngall and also the pride which were at work about his heart by the\nrepeated titles which he gave to his old friend.\n\n\"They desire that Anna should marry the young lord!\"\n\n\"Yes, my lady. That's the meaning of it.\"\n\n\"And what am I to be?\"\n\n\"Just the Countess Lovel,--with a third of the property as your own.\nI suppose it would be a third; but you might trust the lawyers to\nsettle that properly. When once they take your daughter among them\nthey won't scrimp you in your honours. They'll all swear that the\nmarriage was good enough then. They know that already, and have made\nthis offer because they know it. Your ladyship needn't fear now\nbut what all the world will own you as the Countess Lovel. I don't\nsuppose I'll be troubled to come up to London any more.\"\n\n\"Oh, my friend!\" The ejaculation she made feeling the necessity of\nsaying something to soothe the tailor's pride; but her heart was\nfixed upon the fruition of that for which she had spent so many years\nin struggling. Was it to come to her at last? Could it be that now,\nnow at once, people throughout the world would call her the Countess\nLovel, and would own her daughter to be the Lady Anna,--till she also\nshould become a countess? Of the young man she had heard nothing\nbut good, and it was impossible that she should have fear in that\ndirection, even had she been timorous by nature. But she was bold\nand eager, hopeful in spite of all that she had suffered, full of\nambition, and not prone to feminine scruples. She had been fighting\nall her life in order that she and her daughter might be acknowledged\nto be among the aristocrats of her country. She was so far a loving,\ndevoted mother that in all her battles she thought more of her child\nthan of herself. She would have consented to carry on the battle in\npoverty to the last gasp of her own breath, could she thereby have\ninsured success for her surviving daughter. But she was not a woman\nlikely to be dismayed at the idea of giving her girl in marriage\nto an absolute stranger, when that stranger was such a one as the\nyoung Earl Lovel. She herself had been a countess, but a wretched,\nunacknowledged, poverty-stricken countess, for the last half of her\neventful life. This marriage would make her daughter a countess,\nprosperous, accepted by all, and very wealthy. What better end could\nthere be to her long struggles? Of course she would assent.\n\n\"I don't know why they should have troubled themselves to send for\nme,\" said the tailor.\n\n\"Because you are the best friend that I have in the world. Whom else\ncould I have trusted as I do you? Has the Earl agreed to it?\"\n\n\"They didn't tell me that, my lady.\"\n\n\"They would hardly have sent, unless he had agreed. Don't you think\nso, Mr. Thwaite?\"\n\n\"I don't know much about such things, my lady.\"\n\n\"You have told--Daniel?\"\n\n\"No, my lady.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Thwaite, do not talk to me in that way. It sounds as though\nyou were deserting me.\"\n\n\"There'll be no reason for not deserting now. You'll have friends by\nthe score more fit to see you through this than old Thomas Thwaite.\nAnd, to own the truth, now that the matter is coming to an end, I am\ngetting weary of it. I'm not so young as I was, and I'd be better\nleft at home to my business.\"\n\n\"I hope that you may disregard your business now without imprudence,\nMr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"No, my lady;--a man should always stick to his business. I hope that\nDaniel will do so better than his father before him,--so that his son\nmay never have to go out to be servant to another man.\"\n\n\"You are speaking daggers to me.\"\n\n\"I have not meant it then. I am rough by nature, I know, and perhaps\na little low just at present. There is something sad in the parting\nof old friends.\"\n\n\"Old friends needn't be parted, Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"When your ladyship was good enough to point out to me my boy's\nimproper manner of speech to Lady Anna, I knew how it must be. You\nwere quite right, my lady. There can be no becoming friendship\nbetween the future Lady Lovel and a journeyman tailor. I was wrong\nfrom the beginning.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Thwaite! without such wrong where should we have been?\"\n\n\"There can be no holding ground of friendship between such as you and\nsuch as we. Lords and ladies, earls and countesses, are our enemies,\nand we are theirs. We may make their robes and take their money, and\ndeal with them as the Jew dealt with the Christians in the play; but\nwe cannot eat with them or drink with them.\"\n\n\"How often have I eaten and drank at your table, when no other table\nwas spread for me?\"\n\n\"You were a Jew almost as ourselves then. We cannot now well stand\nshoulder to shoulder and arm to arm as friends should do.\"\n\n\"How often has my child lain in your arms when she was a baby, and\nbeen quieter there than she would be even in her mother's?\"\n\n\"That has all gone by. Other arms will be open to receive her.\" As\nthe tailor said this he remembered how his boy used to take the\nlittle child out to the mountain side, and how the two would ramble\naway together through the long summer evenings; and he reflected that\nthe memory of those days was no doubt still strong in the heart of\nhis son. Some shadow of the grief which would surely fall upon the\nyoung man now fell upon the father, and caused him almost to repent\nof the work of his life. \"Tailors should consort with tailors,\" he\nsaid, \"and lords and ladies should consort together.\"\n\nSomething of the same feeling struck the Countess also. If it were\nnot for the son, the father, after all that he had done for them,\nmight be almost as near and as dear to them as ever. He might have\ncalled the Lady Anna by her Christian name, at any rate till she had\nbeen carried away as a bride by the Earl. But, though all this was so\nexquisitely painful, it had been absolutely necessary to check the\nson. \"Ah, well,\" she said; \"it is hardly to be hoped that so many\ncrooked things should be made straight without much pain. If you\nknew, Mr. Thwaite, how little it is that I expect for myself!\"\n\n\"It is because I have known it that I am here.\"\n\n\"It will be well for her,--will it not,--to be the wife of her\ncousin?\"\n\n\"If he be a good man. A woman will not always make herself happy by\nmarrying an Earl.\"\n\n\"How many daggers you can use, Mr. Thwaite! But this young man is\ngood. You yourself have said that you have heard so.\"\n\n\"I have heard nothing to the contrary, my lady.\"\n\n\"And what shall I do?\"\n\n\"Just explain it all to Lady Anna. I think it will be clear then.\"\n\n\"You believe that she will be so easily pleased?\"\n\n\"Why should she not be pleased? She'll have some maiden scruples,\ndoubtless. What maid would not? But she'll exult at such an end to\nall her troubles;--and what maid would not? Let them meet as soon as\nmay be and have it over. When he shall have placed the ring on her\nfinger, your battle will have been won.\"\n\nThen the tailor felt that his commission was done and he might take\nhis leave. It had been arranged that in the event of the Countess\nconsenting to the proposed marriage, he should call upon Mr. Flick to\nexplain that it was so. Had she dissented, a short note would have\nbeen sufficient. Had such been the case, the Solicitor-General would\nhave instigated the young lord to go and try what he himself could do\nwith the Countess and her daughter. The tailor had suggested to the\nmother that she should at once make the proposition known to Lady\nAnna, but the Countess felt that one other word was necessary as\nher old friend left her. \"Will you go back at once to Keswick, Mr.\nThwaite?\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning, my lady.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will not tell your son of this,--yet?\"\n\n\"No, my lady. I will not tell my son of this,--yet. My son is\nhigh-minded and stiff-necked, and of great heart. If he saw aught to\nobject to in this marriage, it might be that he would express himself\nloudly.\" Then the tailor took his leave without even shaking hands\nwith the Countess.\n\nThe woman sat alone for the next two hours, thinking of what had\npassed. There had sprung up in these days a sort of friendship\nbetween Mrs. Bluestone and the two Miss Bluestones and the Lady\nAnna, arising rather from the forlorn condition of the young lady\nthan from any positive choice of affection. Mrs. Bluestone was kind\nand motherly. The girls were girlish and good. The father was the\nJupiter Tonans of the household,--as was of course proper,--and was\nworshipped in everything. To the world at large Serjeant Bluestone\nwas a thundering, blundering, sanguine, energetic lawyer, whom nobody\ndisliked very much though he was so big and noisy. But at home\nSerjeant Bluestone was all the judges of the land rolled into one.\nBut he was a kind-hearted man, and he had sent his wife and girls\nto call upon the disconsolate Countess. The disconsolate Lady Anna\nhaving no other friends, had found the companionship of the Bluestone\ngirls to be pleasant to her, and she was now with them at the\nSerjeant's house in Bedford Square. Mrs. Bluestone talked of the\nwrongs and coming rights of the Countess Lovel wherever she went, and\nthe Bluestone girls had all the case at their fingers' ends. To doubt\nthat the Serjeant would succeed, or to doubt that the success of the\nCountess and her daughter would have had any other source than the\nSerjeant's eloquence and the Serjeant's zeal, would have been heresy\nin Bedford Square. The grand idea that young Jack Bluestone, who was\nup at Brasenose, should marry the Lady Anna, had occurred only to the\nmother.\n\nLady Anna was away with her friends as the Countess sat brooding over\nthe new hopes that had been opened to her. At first, she could not\ntear her mind away from the position which she herself would occupy\nas soon as her daughter should have been married and taken away\nfrom her. The young Earl would not want his mother-in-law,--a\nmother-in-law who had spent the best years of her life in the society\nof a tailor. And the daughter, who would still be young enough to\nbegin a new life in a new sphere, would no longer want her mother to\nhelp her. As regarded herself, the Countess was aware that the life\nshe had led so long, and the condition of agonizing struggling to\nwhich she had been brought, had unfitted her for smiling, happy,\nprosperous, aristocratic luxury. There was but one joy left for her,\nand that was to be the joy of success. When that cup should have been\ndrained, there would be nothing left to her. She would have her rank,\nof course,--and money enough to support it. She no longer feared that\nany one would do her material injury. Her daughter's husband no doubt\nwould see that she had a fitting home, with all the appanages and\nparaphernalia suited to a dowager Countess. But who would share her\nhome with her, and where should she find her friends? Even now the\ntwo Miss Bluestones were more to her daughter than she was. When\nshe should be established in her new luxurious home, with servants\ncalling her my lady, with none to contradict her right, she would no\nlonger be enabled to sit late into the night discussing matters with\nher friend the tailor. As regarded herself, it would have been better\nfor her, perhaps, if the fight had been carried on.\n\nBut the fight had been, not for herself, but for her child; and the\nvictory for her girl would have been won by her own perseverance.\nHer whole life had been devoted to establishing the rights of her\ndaughter, and it should be so devoted to the end. It had been her\ngreat resolve that the world should acknowledge the rank of her girl,\nand now it would be acknowledged. Not only would she become the\nCountess Lovel by marriage, but the name which had been assumed for\nher amidst the ridicule of many, and in opposition to the belief of\nnearly all, would be proved to have been her just and proper title.\nAnd then, at last, it would be known by all men that she herself, the\nill-used, suffering mother, had gone to the house of that wicked man,\nnot as his mistress, but as his true wife!\n\nHardly a thought troubled her, then, as to the acquiescence of her\ndaughter. She had no faintest idea that the girl's heart had been\ntouched by the young tailor. She had so lived that she knew but\nlittle of lovers and their love, and in her fear regarding Daniel\nThwaite she had not conceived danger such as that. It had to her\nsimply been unfitting that there should be close familiarity between\nthe two. She expected that her daughter would be ambitious, as she\nwas ambitious, and would rejoice greatly at such perfect success.\nShe herself had been preaching ambition and practising ambition all\nher life. It had been the necessity of her career that she should\nthink more of her right to a noble name than of any other good thing\nunder the sun. It was only natural that she should believe that her\ndaughter shared the feeling.\n\nAnd then Lady Anna came in. \"They wanted me to stay and dine, mamma,\nbut I did not like to think that you should be left alone.\"\n\n\"I must get used to that, my dear.\"\n\n\"Why, mamma? Wherever we have been, we have always been together.\nMrs. Bluestone was quite unhappy because you would not come. They are\nso good-natured! I wish you would go there.\"\n\n\"I am better here, my dear.\" Then there was a pause for a few\nmoments. \"But I am glad that you have come home this evening.\"\n\n\"Of course, I should come home.\"\n\n\"I have something special to say to you.\"\n\n\"To me, mamma! What is it, mamma?\"\n\n\"I think we will wait till after dinner. The things are here now. Go\nup-stairs and take off your hat, and I will tell you after dinner.\"\n\n\"Mamma,\" Lady Anna said, as soon as the maid had left the room, \"has\nold Mr. Thwaite been here?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, he was here.\"\n\n\"I thought so, because you have something to tell me. It is something\nfrom him?\"\n\n\"Not from himself, Anna;--though he was the messenger. Come and sit\nhere, my dear,--close to me. Have you ever thought, Anna, that it\nwould be good for you to be married?\"\n\n\"No, mamma; why should I?\" But that surely was a lie! How often had\nshe thought that it would be good to be married to Daniel Thwaite and\nto have done with this weary searching after rank! And now what could\nher mother mean? Thomas Thwaite had been there, but it was impossible\nthat her mother should think that Daniel Thwaite would be a fit\nhusband for her daughter. \"No, mamma;--why should I?\"\n\n\"It must be thought of, my dearest.\"\n\n\"Why now?\" She could understand perfectly that there was some special\ncause for her mother's manner of speech.\n\n\"After all that we have gone through, we are about to succeed\nat last. They are willing to own everything, to give us all our\nrights,--on one condition.\"\n\n\"What condition, mamma?\"\n\n\"Come nearer to me, dearest. It would not make you unhappy to think\nthat you were going to be the wife of a man you could love?\"\n\n\"No;--not if I really loved him.\"\n\n\"You have heard of your cousin,--the young Earl?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma;--I have heard of him.\"\n\n\"They say that he is everything that is good. What should you think\nof having him for your husband?\"\n\n\"That would be impossible, mamma.\"\n\n\"Impossible!--why impossible? What could be more fitting? Your rank\nis equal to his;--higher even in this, that your father was himself\nthe Earl. In fortune you will be much more than his equal. In age you\nare exactly suited. Why should it be impossible?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, it is impossible!\"\n\n\"What makes you say so, Anna?\"\n\n\"We have never seen each other.\"\n\n\"Tush! my child. Why should you not see each other?\"\n\n\"And then we are his enemies.\"\n\n\"We are no longer enemies, dearest. They have sent to say that if\nwe,--you and I,--will consent to this marriage, then will they\nconsent to it also. It is their wish, and it comes from them. There\ncan be no more proper ending to all this weary lawsuit. It is quite\nright that the title and the name should be supported. It is quite\nright that the fortune which your father left should, in this way,\ngo to support your father's family. You will be the Countess Lovel;\nand all will have been conceded to us. There cannot possibly be any\nfitter way out of our difficulties.\" Lady Anna sat looking at her\nmother in dismay, but could say nothing. \"You need have no fear\nabout the young man. Every one tells me that he is just the man\nthat a mother would welcome as a husband for her daughter. Will\nyou not be glad to see him?\" But the Lady Anna would only say that\nit was impossible. \"Why impossible, my dear;--what do you mean by\nimpossible?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, it is impossible!\"\n\nThe Countess found that she was obliged to give the subject up for\nthat night, and could only comfort herself by endeavouring to believe\nthat the suddenness of the tidings had confused her child.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nIT ISN'T LAW.\n\n\nOn the next morning Lady Anna was ill, and would not leave her bed.\nWhen her mother spoke to her, she declared that her head ached\nwretchedly, and she could not be persuaded to dress herself.\n\n\"Is it what I said to you last night?\" asked the Countess.\n\n\"Oh, mamma, that is impossible,\" she said.\n\nIt seemed to the mother that the mention of the young lord's name\nhad produced a horror in the daughter's mind which nothing could for\nthe present subdue. Before the day was over, however, the girl had\nacknowledged that she was bound in duty, at any rate, to meet her\ncousin; and the Countess, forced to satisfy herself with so much of\nconcession, and acting upon that, fixed herself in her purpose to\ngo on with the project. The lawyers on both sides would assist her.\nIt was for the advantage of them all that there should be such a\nmarriage. She determined, therefore, that she would at once see Mr.\nGoffe, her own attorney, and give him to understand in general terms\nthat the case might be proceeded with on this new matrimonial basis.\n\nBut there was a grievous doubt on her mind,--a fear, a spark of\nsuspicion, of which she had unintentionally given notice to Thomas\nThwaite when she asked him whether he had as yet spoken of the\nproposed marriage to his son. He had understood what was passing in\nher mind when she exacted from him a promise that nothing should as\nyet be said to Daniel Thwaite upon the matter. And yet she assured\nherself over and over again that her girl could not be so weak, so\nvain, so foolish, so wicked as that! It could not be that, after all\nthe struggles of her life,--when at last success, perfect success,\nwas within their grasp, when all had been done and all well done,\nwhen the great reward was then coming up to their very lips with a\nfull tide,--it could not be that in the very moment of victory all\nshould be lost through the base weakness of a young girl! Was it\npossible that her daughter,--the daughter of one who had spent the\nvery marrow of her life in fighting for the position that was due to\nher,--should spoil all by preferring a journeyman tailor to a young\nnobleman of high rank, of ancient lineage, and one, too, who by his\nmarriage with herself would endow her with wealth sufficient to make\nthat rank splendid as well as illustrious? But if it were not so,\nwhat had the girl meant by saying that it was impossible? That the\nword should have been used once or twice in maidenly scruple, the\nCountess could understand; but it had been repeated with a vehemence\nbeyond that which such natural timidity might have produced. And now\nthe girl professed herself to be ill in bed, and when the subject was\nbroached would only weep, and repeat the one word with which she had\nexpressed her repugnance to the match.\n\nHitherto she had not been like this. She had, in her own quiet way,\nshared her mother's aspirations, and had always sympathised with\nher mother's sufferings; and she had been dutiful through it all,\ncarrying herself as one who was bound to special obedience by the\npeculiarity of her parent's position. She had been keenly alive to\nthe wrongs that her mother endured, and had in every respect been a\nloving child. But now she protested that she would not do the one\nthing necessary to complete their triumph, and would give no reason\nfor not doing so. As the Countess thought of all this, she swore\nto herself that she would prefer to divest her bosom of all soft\nmotherly feeling than be vanquished in this matter by her own child.\nHer daughter should find that she could be stern and rough enough if\nshe were really thwarted. What would her life be worth to her if her\nchild, Lady Anna Lovel, the heiress and only legitimate offspring of\nthe late Earl Lovel, were to marry a--tailor?\n\nAnd then, again, she told herself that there was no sufficient excuse\nfor such alarm. Her daughter's demeanour had ever been modest. She\nhad never been given to easy friendship, or to that propensity to\nmen's acquaintance which the world calls flirting. It might be that\nthe very absence of such propensity,--the very fact that hitherto she\nhad never been thrust into society among her equals,--had produced\nthat feeling almost of horror which she had expressed. But she had\nbeen driven, at any rate, to say that she would meet the young man;\nand the Countess, acting upon that, called on Mr. Goffe in his\nchambers, and explained to that gentleman that she proposed to settle\nthe whole question in dispute by giving her daughter to the young\nEarl in marriage. Mr. Goffe, who had been present at the conference\namong the lawyers, understood it all in a moment. The overture had\nbeen made from the other side to his client.\n\n\"Indeed, my lady!\" said Mr. Goffe.\n\n\"Do you not think it will be an excellent arrangement?\"\n\nIn his heart of hearts Mr. Goffe thought that it would be an\nexcellent arrangement; but he could not commit himself to such an\nopinion. Serjeant Bluestone thought that the matter should be fought\nout, and Mr. Goffe was not prepared to separate himself from his\nlegal adviser. As Serjeant Bluestone had said after the conference,\nwith much argumentative vehemence,--\"If we were to agree to this,\nhow would it be if the marriage should not come off? The court can't\nagree to a marriage. The court must direct to whom the property\nbelongs. They profess that they can prove that our marriage was no\nmarriage. They must do so, or else they must withdraw the allegation.\nSuppose the Italian woman were to come forward afterwards with her\nclaim as the widow, where then would be my client's position, and her\ntitle as dowager countess, and her claim upon her husband's personal\nestate? I never heard anything more irregular in my life. It is\njust like Patterson, who always thinks he can make laws according\nto the light of his own reason.\" So Serjeant Bluestone had said to\nthe lawyers who were acting with him; and Mr. Goffe, though he did\nhimself think that this marriage would be the best thing in the\nworld, could not differ from the Serjeant.\n\nNo doubt there might even yet be very great difficulties, even though\nthe young Earl and Lady Anna Lovel should agree to be married. Mr.\nGoffe on that occasion said very little to the Countess, and she\nleft him with a feeling that a certain quantity of cold water had\nbeen thrown upon the scheme. But she would not allow herself to be\ndisturbed by that. The marriage could go on without any consent on\nthe part of the lawyers, and the Countess was quite satisfied that,\nshould the marriage be once completed, the money and the titles would\nall go as she desired. She had already begun to have more faith in\nthe Solicitor-General than in Mr. Goffe or in Serjeant Bluestone.\n\nBut Serjeant Bluestone was not a man to bear such treatment and be\nquiet under it. He heard that very day from Mr. Goffe what had been\ndone, and was loud in the expression of his displeasure. It was the\nmost irregular thing that he had ever known. No other man except\nPatterson in the whole profession would have done it! The counsel on\nthe other side--probably Patterson himself--had been to his client,\nand given advice to his client, and had done so after her own counsel\nhad decided that no such advice should be given! He would see the\nAttorney-General, and ask the Attorney-General what he thought about\nit. Now, it was supposed in legal circles, just at this period, that\nthe Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General were not the best\nfriends in the world; and the latter was wont to call the former an\nold fogey, and the former to say of the latter that he might be a\nvery clever philosopher, but certainly no lawyer. And so by degrees\nthe thing got much talked about in the profession; and there was\nperhaps a balance of opinion that the Solicitor-General had done\nwrong.\n\nBut this was certain,--that no one could be put into possession of\nthe property till the court had decided to whom it belonged. If the\nEarl withdrew from his claim, the widow would simply be called on to\nprove her own marriage,--which had in truth been proved more than\nonce already,--and the right of her legitimate child would follow as\na matter of course. It was by no means probable that the woman over\nin Italy would make any claim on her own behalf,--and even, should\nshe do so, she could not find the means of supporting it. \"They must\nbe asses,\" said the Solicitor-General, \"not to see that I am fighting\ntheir battle for them, and that I am doing so because I can best\nsecure my own client's interests by securing theirs also.\" But even\nhe became nervous after a day or two, and was anxious to learn that\nthe marriage scheme was progressing. He told his client, Lord Lovel,\nthat it would be well that the marriage should take place before the\ncourt sat in November. \"In that case settlements will, of course,\nhave been made, and we shall simply withdraw. We shall state the fact\nof this new marriage, and assert ourselves to be convinced that the\nold marriage was good and valid. But you should lose no time in the\nwooing, my lord.\" At this time the Earl had not seen his cousin, and\nit had not yet been decided when they should meet.\n\n\"It is my duty to explain to you, Lady Lovel, as my client,\" said\nSerjeant Bluestone to the Countess, \"that this arrangement cannot\nafford a satisfactory mode to you of establishing your own position.\"\n\n\"It would be so happy for the whole family!\"\n\n\"As to that I can know nothing, Lady Lovel. If your daughter and the\nEarl are attached to each other, there can be no reason on earth why\nthey should not be married. But it should be a separate thing. Your\nposition should not be made to depend upon hers.\"\n\n\"But they will withdraw, Serjeant Bluestone.\"\n\n\"How do you know that they will withdraw? Supposing at the last\nmoment Lady Anna were to decline the alliance, would they withdraw\nthen? Not a bit of it. The matter would be further delayed, and\nreferred over to next year. You and your daughter would be kept out\nof your money, and there would still be danger.\"\n\n\"I should not care for that;--if they were married.\"\n\n\"And they have set up this Italian countess,--who never was a\ncountess,--any more than I am. Now they have put her up, they are\nbound to dispose of her. If she came forward afterwards, on her own\nbehalf, where would you all be then?\"\n\n\"My daughter would, at any rate, be safe.\"\n\nThe Serjeant did not like it at all. He felt that he was being thrown\nover, not only by his client the Countess,--as to which he might\nhave been indifferent, knowing that the world at large, the laity as\ndistinguished from the lawyers, the children of the world as all who\nwere not lawyers seemed to him to be, will do and must be expected to\ndo, foolish things continually. They cannot be persuaded to subject\nthemselves to lawyers in all their doings, and, of course, go wrong\nwhen they do not do so. The infinite simplicity and silliness of\nmankind and womankind at large were too well known to the Serjeant to\ncause him dismay, let them be shown in ever so egregious a fashion.\nBut in this case the fault came from another lawyer, who had tampered\nwith his clients, and who seemed to be himself as ignorant as\nthough he belonged to the outside world. And this man had been made\nSolicitor-General,--over the heads of half the profession,--simply\nbecause he could make a speech in Parliament!\n\nBut the Solicitor-General was himself becoming uneasy when at the end\nof a fortnight he learned that the young people,--as he had come to\ncall them on all occasions,--had not as yet seen each other. He would\nnot like to have it said of him that he had thrown over his client.\nAnd there were some who still believed that the Italian marriage\nhad been a real marriage, and the Italian wife alive at the time of\nthe Cumberland marriage,--though the Italian woman now living had\nnever been the countess. Mr. Hardy so believed, and, in his private\nopinion, thought that the Solicitor-General had been very indiscreet.\n\n\"I don't think that we could ever dare to face a jury,\" said Sir\nWilliam to Mr. Hardy when they discussed the matter, about a\nfortnight after the proposition had been made.\n\n\"Why did the Earl always say that the Italian woman was his wife?\"\n\n\"Because the Earl was a very devil.\"\n\n\"Mr. Flick does not think so.\"\n\n\"Yes, he does; but Mr. Flick, like all attorneys with a bad case,\ndoes not choose to say quite what he thinks, even to his own counsel.\nMr. Flick does not like to throw his client over, nor do I, nor\ndo you. But with such a case we have no right to create increased\nexpenses, and all the agony of prolonged fallacious hope. The girl is\nher father's heir. Do you suppose I would not stick to my brief if I\ndid not feel sure that it is so?\"\n\n\"Then let the Earl be told, and let the girl have her rights.\"\n\n\"Ah! there you have me. It may be that such would be the juster\ncourse; but then, Hardy, cannot you understand that though I am sure,\nI am not quite sure; that though the case is a bad one, it may not\nbe quite bad enough to be thrown up? It is just the case in which\na compromise is expedient. If but a quarter, or but an eighth of a\nprobability be with you, take your proportion of the thing at stake.\nBut here is a compromise that gives all to each. Who would wish to\nrob the girl of her noble name and great inheritance if she be the\nheiress? Not I, though the Earl be my client. And yet how sad would\nit be to have to tell that young man that there was nothing for him\nbut to submit to lose all the wealth belonging to the family of which\nhe has been born the head! If we can bring them together there will\nbe nothing to make sore the hearts of any of us.\"\n\nMr. Hardy acknowledged to himself that the Solicitor-General pleaded\nhis own case very well; but yet he felt that it wasn't law.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE FIRST INTERVIEW.\n\n\nFor some days after the intimation of her mother's purpose, Lady Anna\nkept her bed. She begged that she might not see a doctor. She had a\nheadache,--nothing but a headache. But it was quite impossible that\nshe should ever marry Earl Lovel. This she said whenever her mother\nwould revert to that subject,--\"I have not seen him, mamma; I do not\nknow him. I am sure it would be impossible.\" Then, when at last she\nwas induced to dress herself, she was still unwilling to be forced to\nundergo the interview to which she had acknowledged that she must be\nsubjected. At last she consented to spend a day in Bedford Square; to\ndine there, and to be brought home in the evening. The Countess was\nat this time not very full of trust in the Serjeant, having learned\nthat he was opposed to the marriage scheme, but she was glad that her\ndaughter should be induced to go out, even to the Serjeant's house,\nas after that visit the girl could have no ground on which to oppose\nthe meeting which was to be arranged. She could hardly plead that she\nwas too ill to see her cousin when she had dined with Mrs. Bluestone.\n\nDuring this time many plans had been proposed for the meeting. The\nSolicitor-General, discussing the matter with the young lord, had\nthought it best that Lady Anna should at once be asked down to\nYoxham,--as the Lady Anna; and the young lord would have been quite\nsatisfied with such an arrangement. He could have gone about his\nobligatory wooing among his own friends, in the house to which he had\nbeen accustomed, with much more ease than in a London lodging. But\nhis uncle, who had corresponded on the subject with Mr. Hardy, still\nobjected. \"We should be giving up everything,\" he said, \"if we were\nonce to call her Lady Anna. Where should we be then if they didn't\nhit it off together? I don't believe, and I never shall believe, that\nshe is really Lady Anna Lovel.\" The Solicitor-General, when he heard\nof this objection, shook his head, finding himself almost provoked to\nanger. What asses were these people not to understand that he could\nsee further into the matter than they could do, and that their best\nway out of their difficulty would be frankly to open their arms to\nthe heiress! Should they continue to be pig-headed and prejudiced,\neverything would soon be gone.\n\nThen he had a scheme for inviting the girl to his own house, and to\nthat scheme he obtained his wife's consent. But here his courage\nfailed him; or, it might be fairer to say, that his prudence\nprevailed. He was very anxious, intensely eager, so to arrange this\ngreat family dispute that all should be benefited,--believing, nay\nfeeling positively certain that all concerned in the matter were\nhonest; but he must not go so far as to do himself an absolute and\ngrievous damage, should it at last turn out that he was wrong in any\nof his surmises. So that plan was abandoned.\n\nThere was nothing left for it but that the young Earl should himself\nface the difficulty, and be introduced to the girl at the lodging in\nWyndham Street. But, as a prelude to this, a meeting was arranged\nat Mr. Flick's chambers between the Countess and her proposed\nson-in-law. That the Earl should go to his own attorney's chambers\nwas all in rule. While he was there the Countess came,--which was not\nin rule, and almost induced the Serjeant to declare, when he heard\nit, that he would have nothing more to do with the case. \"My lord,\"\nsaid the Countess, \"I am glad to meet you, and I hope that we may be\nfriends.\" The young man was less collected, and stammered out a few\nwords that were intended to be civil.\n\n\"It is a pity that you should have conflicting interests,\" said the\nattorney.\n\n\"I hope it need not continue to be so,\" said the Countess. \"My heart,\nLord Lovel, is all in the welfare of our joint family. We will\nbegrudge you nothing if you will not begrudge us the names which\nare our own, and without which we cannot live honourably before\nthe world.\" Then some other few words were muttered, and the Earl\npromised to come to Wyndham Street at a certain hour. Not a word\nwas then said about the marriage. Even the Countess, with all her\nresolution and all her courage, did not find herself able in set\nterms to ask the young man to marry her daughter.\n\n\"She is a very handsome woman,\" said the lord to the attorney, when\nthe Countess had left them.\n\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"And like a lady.\"\n\n\"Quite like a lady. She herself was of a good family.\"\n\n\"I suppose she certainly was the late Earl's wife, Mr. Flick?\"\n\n\"Who can say, my lord? That is just the question. The\nSolicitor-General thinks that she would prove her right, and I do\nnot know that I have ever found him to be wrong when he has had a\nsteadfast opinion.\"\n\n\"Why should we not give it up to her at once?\"\n\n\"I couldn't recommend that, my lord. Why should we give it up? The\ninterests at stake are very great. I couldn't for a moment think of\nsuggesting to you to give it up.\"\n\n\"I want nothing, Mr. Flick, that does not belong to me.\"\n\n\"Just so. But then perhaps it does belong to you. We can never\nbe sure. No doubt the safest way will be for you to contract an\nalliance with this lady. Of course we should give it up then, but the\nsettlements would make the property all right.\" The young Earl did\nnot quite like it. He would rather have commenced his wooing after\nthe girl had been established in her own right, and when she would\nhave had no obligation on her to accept him. But he had consented,\nand it was too late for him now to recede. It had been already\narranged that he should call in Wyndham Street at noon on the\nfollowing day, in order that he might be introduced to his cousin.\n\nOn that evening the Countess sat late with her daughter, purposing\nthat on the morrow nothing should be said before the interview\ncalculated to disturb the girl's mind. But as they sat together\nthrough the twilight and into the darkness of night, close by the\nopen window, through which the heavily laden air of the metropolis\ncame to them, hot with all the heat of a London July day, very many\nwords were spoken by the Countess. \"It will be for you, to-morrow, to\nmake or to mar all that I have been doing since the day on which you\nwere born.\"\n\n\"Oh! mamma, that is so terrible a thing to say!\"\n\n\"But terrible things must be said if they are true. It is so. It is\nfor you to decide whether we shall triumph, or be utterly and for\never crushed.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand it. Why should we be crushed? He would not wish\nto marry me if this fortune were not mine. He is not coming, mamma,\nbecause he loves me.\"\n\n\"You say that because you do not understand. Do you suppose that my\nname will be allowed to me if you should refuse your cousin's suit?\nIf so, you are very much mistaken. The fight will go on, and as we\nhave not money, we shall certainly go to the wall at last. Why should\nyou not love him? There is no one else that you care for.\"\n\n\"No, mamma,\" she said slowly.\n\n\"Then, what more can you want?\"\n\n\"I do not know him, mamma.\"\n\n\"But you will know him. According to that, no girl would ever get\nmarried. Is it not a great thing that you should be asked to assume\nand to enjoy the rank which has belonged to your mother, but which\nshe has never been able to enjoy?\"\n\n\"I do not think, mamma, that I care much about rank.\"\n\n\"Anna!\" The mother's mind as she heard this flew off to the young\ntailor. Had misery so great as this overtaken her after all?\n\n\"I mean that I don't care so much about it. It has never done us any\ngood.\"\n\n\"But if it is a thing that is your own, that you are born to, you\nmust bear it, whether it be in sorrow or in joy; whether it be a\nblessing or a curse. If it be yours, you cannot fling it away from\nyou. You may disgrace it, but you must still have it. Though you were\nto throw yourself away upon a chimney-sweeper, you must still be Lady\nAnna, the daughter of Earl Lovel.\"\n\n\"I needn't call myself so.\"\n\n\"Others must call you so. It is your name, and you cannot be rid of\nit. It is yours of right, as my name has been mine of right; and not\nto assert it, not to live up to it, not to be proud of it, would\nargue incredible baseness. 'Noblesse oblige.' You have heard that\nmotto, and know what it means. And then would you throw away from you\nin some childish phantasy all that I have been struggling to win for\nyou during my whole life? Have you ever thought of what my life has\nbeen, Anna?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\"\n\n\"Would you have the heart to disappoint me, now that the victory is\nwon;--now that it may be made our own by your help? And what is it\nthat I am asking you to do? If this man were bad,--if he were such a\none as your father, if he were drunken, cruel, ill-conditioned, or\neven heavy, foolish, or deformed; had you been told stories to set\nyou against him, as that he had been false with other women, I could\nunderstand it. In that case we would at any rate find out the truth\nbefore we went on. But of this man we hear that he is good, and\npleasant; an excellent young man, who has endeared himself to all who\nknow him. Such a one that all the girls of his own standing in the\nworld would give their eyes to win him.\"\n\n\"Let some girl win him then who cares for him.\"\n\n\"But he wishes to win you, dearest.\"\n\n\"Not because he loves me. How can he love me when he never saw me?\nHow can I love him when I never saw him?\"\n\n\"He wishes to win you because he has heard what you are, and because\nhe knows that by doing so he can set things right which for many\nyears have been wrong.\"\n\n\"It is because he would get all this money.\"\n\n\"You would both get it. He desires nothing unfair. Whatever he\ntakes from you, so much he will give. And it is not only for this\ngeneration. Is it nothing to you that the chiefs of your own family\nwho shall come after you shall be able to hold their heads up among\nother British peers? Would you not wish that your own son should come\nto be Earl Lovel, with wealth sufficient to support the dignity?\"\n\n\"I don't think it would make him happy, mamma.\"\n\n\"There is something more in this, Anna, than I can understand. You\nused not to be so. When we talked of these things in past years you\nused not to be indifferent.\"\n\n\"I was not asked then to--to--marry a man I did not care for.\"\n\n\"There is something else, Anna.\"\n\n\"No, mamma.\"\n\n\"If there be nothing else you will learn to care for him. You will\nsee him to-morrow, and will be left alone with him. I will sit with\nyou for a time, and then I will leave you. All that I ask of you is\nto receive him to-morrow without any prejudice against him. You must\nremember how much depends on you, and that you are not as other girls\nare.\" After that Lady Anna was allowed to go to her bed, and to weep\nin solitude over the wretchedness of her condition. It was not only\nthat she loved Daniel Thwaite with all her heart,--loved him with\na love that had grown with every year of her growth;--but that she\nfeared him also. The man had become her master; and even could she\nhave brought herself to be false, she would have lacked the courage\nto declare her falsehood to the man to whom she had vowed her love.\n\nOn the following morning Lady Anna did not come down to breakfast,\nand the Countess began to fear that she would be unable to induce her\ngirl to rise in time to receive their visitor. But the poor child had\nresolved to receive the man's visit, and contemplated no such escape\nas that. At eleven o'clock she slowly dressed herself, and before\ntwelve crept down into the one sitting-room which they occupied. The\nCountess glanced round at her, anxious to see that she was looking\nher best. Certain instructions had been given as to her dress, and\nthe garniture of her hair, and the disposal of her ribbons. All\nthese had been fairly well obeyed; but there was a fixed, determined\nhardness in her face which made her mother fear that the Earl might\nbe dismayed. The mother knew that her child had never looked like\nthat before.\n\nPunctually at twelve the Earl was announced. The Countess received\nhim very pleasantly, and with great composure. She shook hands with\nhim as though they had known each other all their lives, and then\nintroduced him to her daughter with a sweet smile. \"I hope you will\nacknowledge her as your far-away cousin, my lord. Blood, they say, is\nthicker than water; and, if so, you two ought to be friends.\"\n\n\"I am sure I hope we may be,\" said the Earl.\n\n\"I hope so too,--my lord,\" said the girl, as she left her hand quite\nmotionless in his.\n\n\"We heard of you down in Cumberland,\" said the Countess. \"It is\nlong since I have seen the old place, but I shall never forget it.\nThere is not a bush among the mountains there that I shall not\nremember,--ay, into the next world, if aught of our memories are left\nto us.\"\n\n\"I love the mountains; but the house is very gloomy.\"\n\n\"Gloomy indeed. If you found it sad, what must it have been to me? I\nhope that I may tell you some day of all that I suffered there. There\nare things to tell of which I have never yet spoken to human being.\nShe, poor child, has been too young and too tender to be troubled\nby such a tale. I sometimes think that no tragedy ever written, no\nstory of horrors ever told, can have exceeded in description the\nthings which I endured in that one year of my married life.\" Then\nshe went on at length, not telling the details of that terrible year,\nbut speaking generally of the hardships of her life. \"I have never\nwondered, Lord Lovel, that you and your nearest relations should have\nquestioned my position. A bad man had surrounded me with such art in\nhis wickedness, that it has been almost beyond my strength to rid\nmyself of his toils.\" All this she had planned beforehand, having\nresolved that she would rush into the midst of things at once, and if\npossible enlist his sympathies on her side.\n\n\"I hope it may be over now,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, rising slowly from her seat, \"I hope it may be\nover now.\" The moment had come in which she had to play the most\ndifficult stroke of her whole game, and much might depend on the way\nin which she played it. She could not leave them together, walking\nabruptly out of the room, without giving some excuse for so unusual\na proceeding. \"Indeed, I hope it may be over now, both for us and\nfor you, Lord Lovel. That wicked man, in leaving behind such cause\nof quarrel, has injured you almost as deeply as us. I pray God that\nyou and that dear girl there may so look into each other's hearts\nand trust each other's purposes, that you may be able to set right\nthe ill which your predecessor did. If so, the family of Lovel for\ncenturies to come may be able to bless your names.\" Then with slow\nsteps she left the room.\n\nLady Anna had spoken one word, and that was all. It certainly was not\nfor her now to speak. She sat leaning on the table, with her eyes\nfixed upon the ground, not daring to look at the man who had been\nbrought to her as her future husband. A single glance she had taken\nas he entered the room, and she had seen at once that he was fair\nand handsome, that he still had that sweet winsome boyishness of\nface which makes a girl feel that she need not fear a man,--that the\nman has something of her own weakness, and need not be treated as\none who is wise, grand, or heroic. And she saw too in one glance\nhow different he was from Daniel Thwaite, the man to whom she had\nabsolutely given herself;--and she understood at the moment something\nof the charm of luxurious softness and aristocratic luxury. Daniel\nThwaite was swarthy, hard-handed, blackbearded,--with a noble fire\nin his eyes, but with an innate coarseness about his mouth which\nbetokened roughness as well as strength. Had it been otherwise with\nher than it was, she might, she thought, have found it easy enough to\nlove this young earl. As it was, there was nothing for her to do but\nto wait and answer him as best she might.\n\n\"Lady Anna,\" he said.\n\n\"My lord!\"\n\n\"Will it not be well that we should be friends?\"\n\n\"Oh,--friends;--yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"I will tell you all and everything;--that is, about myself. I was\nbrought up to believe that you and your mother were just--impostors.\"\n\n\"My lord, we are not impostors.\"\n\n\"No;--I believe it. I am sure you are not. Mistakes have been made,\nbut it has not been of my doing. As a boy, what could I believe but\nwhat I was told? I know now that you are and always have been as you\nhave called yourself. If nothing else comes of it, I will at any rate\nsay so much. The estate which your father left is no doubt yours. If\nI could hinder it, there should be no more law.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord.\"\n\n\"Your mother says that she has suffered much. I am sure she has\nsuffered. I trust that all that is over now. I have come here to-day\nmore to say that on my own behalf than anything else.\" A shadow of a\nshade of disappointment, the slightest semblance of a cloud, passed\nacross her heart as she heard this. But it was well. She could not\nhave married him, even if he had wished it, and now, as it seemed,\nthat difficulty was over. Her mother and those lawyers had been\nmistaken, and it was well that he should tell her so at once.\n\n\"It is very good of you, my lord.\"\n\n\"I would not have you think of me that I could come to you hoping\nthat you would promise me your love before I had shown you whether I\nhad loved you or not.\"\n\n\"No, my lord.\" She hardly understood him now,--whether he intended to\npropose himself as a suitor for her hand or not.\n\n\"You, Lady Anna, are your father's heir. I am your cousin, Earl\nLovel, as poor a peer as there is in England. They tell me that we\nshould marry because you are rich and I am an earl.\"\n\n\"So they tell me;--but that will not make it right.\"\n\n\"I would not have it so, even if I dared to think that you would\nagree to it.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, my lord; nor would I.\"\n\n\"But if you could learn to love me--\"\n\n\"No, my lord;--no.\"\n\n\"Do not answer me yet, my cousin. If I swore that I loved you,--loved\nyou so soon after seeing you,--and loved you, too, knowing you to be\nso wealthy an heiress--\"\n\n\"Ah, do not talk of that.\"\n\n\"Well;--not of that. But if I said that I loved you, you would not\nbelieve me.\"\n\n\"It would not be true, my lord.\"\n\n\"But I know that I shall love you. You will let me try? You are very\nlovely, and they tell me you are sweet-humoured. I can believe well\nthat you are sweet and pleasant. You will let me try to love you,\nAnna?\"\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Must it be so, so soon?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Why that? Is it because we are strangers to each other? That may\nbe cured;--if not quickly, as I would have it cured, slowly and by\ndegrees; slowly as you can wish, if only I may come where you shall\nbe. You have said that we may be friends.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,--friends, I hope.\"\n\n\"Friends at least. We are born cousins.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Cannot you call me by my name? Cousins, you know, do so. And\nremember this, you will have and can have no nearer cousin than I am.\nI am bound at least to be a brother to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, be my brother!\"\n\n\"That,--or more than that. I would fain be more than that. But I will\nbe that, at least. As I came to you, before I saw you, I felt that\nwhenever we knew each other I could not be less to you than that. If\nI am your friend, I must be your best friend,--as being, though poor,\nthe head of your family. The Lovels should at least love each other;\nand cousins may love, even though they should not love enough to be\nman and wife.\"\n\n\"I will love you so always.\"\n\n\"Enough to be my wife?\"\n\n\"Enough to be your dear cousin,--your loving sister.\"\n\n\"So it shall be,--unless it can be more. I would not ask you for more\nnow. I would not wish you to give more now. But think of me, and ask\nyourself whether you can dare to give yourself to me altogether.\"\n\n\"I cannot dare, my lord.\"\n\n\"You would not call your brother, lord. My name is Frederic. But\nAnna, dear Anna,\"--and then he took her unresisting hand,--\"you shall\nnot be asked for more now. But cousins, new-found cousins, who love\neach other, and will stand by each other for help and aid against\nthe world, may surely kiss,--as would a brother and a sister. You\nwill not grudge me a kiss.\" Then she put up her cheek innocently,\nand he kissed it gently,--hardly with a lover's kiss. \"I will leave\nyou now,\" he said, still holding her hand. \"But tell your mother\nthus:--that she shall no longer be troubled by lawyers at the suit of\nher cousin Frederic. She is to me the Countess Lovel, and she shall\nbe treated by me with the honour suited to her rank.\" And so he left\nthe house without seeing the Countess again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nIT IS TOO LATE.\n\n\nThe Countess had resolved that she would let their visitor depart\nwithout saying a word to him. Whatever might be the result of the\ninterview, she was aware that she could not improve it by asking any\nquestion from the young lord, or by hearing any account of it from\nhim. The ice had been broken, and it would now be her object to have\nher daughter invited down to Yoxham as soon as possible. If once the\nEarl's friends could be brought to be eager for the match on his\naccount, as was she on her daughter's behalf, then probably the thing\nmight be done. For herself, she expected no invitation, no immediate\ncomfort, no tender treatment, no intimate familiar cousinship. She\nhad endured hitherto, and would be contented to endure, so that\ntriumph might come at last. Nor did she question her daughter very\nclosely, anxious as she was to learn the truth.\n\nCould she have heard every word that had been spoken she would have\nbeen sure of success. Could Daniel Thwaite have heard every word he\nwould have been sure that the girl was about to be false to him. But\nthe girl herself believed herself to have been true. The man had been\nso soft with her, so tender, so pleasant,--so loving with his sweet\ncousinly offers of affection, that she could not turn herself against\nhim. He had been to her eyes beautiful, noble,--almost divine. She\nknew of herself that she could not be his wife,--that she was not fit\nto be his wife,--because she had given her troth to the tailor's son.\nWhen her cousin touched her check with his lips she remembered that\nshe had submitted to be kissed by one with whom her noble relative\ncould hold no fellowship whatever. A feeling of degradation came\nupon her, as though by contact with this young man she was suddenly\nawakened to a sense of what her own rank demanded from her. When\nher mother had spoken to her of what she owed to her family, she\nhad thought only of all the friendship that she and her mother had\nreceived from her lover and his father. But when Lord Lovel told\nher what she was,--how she should ever be regarded by him as a dear\ncousin,--how her mother should be accounted a countess, and receive\nfrom him the respect due to her rank,--then she could understand\nhow unfitting were a union between the Lady Anna Lovel and Daniel\nThwaite, the journeyman tailor. Hitherto Daniel's face had been noble\nin her eyes,--the face of a man who was manly, generous, and strong.\nBut after looking into the eyes of the young Earl, seeing how soft\nwas the down upon his lips, how ruddy the colour of his cheek, how\nbeautiful was his mouth with its pearl-white teeth, how noble the\ncurve of his nostrils, after feeling the softness of his hand, and\ncatching the sweetness of his breath, she came to know what it might\nhave been to be wooed by such a one as he.\n\nBut not on that account did she meditate falseness. It was settled\nfirm as fate. The dominion of the tailor over her spirit had lasted\nin truth for years. The sweet, perfumed graces of the young nobleman\nhad touched her senses but for a moment. Had she been false-minded\nshe had not courage to be false. But in truth she was not\nfalse-minded. It was to her, as that sunny moment passed across her,\nas to some hard-toiling youth who, while roaming listlessly among\nthe houses of the wealthy, hears, as he lingers on the pavement of\na summer night, the melodies which float upon the air from the open\nbalconies above him. A vague sense of unknown sweetness comes upon\nhim, mingled with an irritating feeling of envy that some favoured\nson of Fortune should be able to stand over the shoulders of that\nsinging syren, while he can only listen with intrusive ears from the\nstreet below. And so he lingers and is envious, and for a moment\ncurses his fate,--not knowing how weary may be the youth who stands,\nhow false the girl who sings. But he does not dream that his life is\nto be altered for him, because he has chanced to hear the daughter of\na duchess warble through a window. And so it was with this girl. The\nyouth was very sweet to her, intensely sweet when he told her that he\nwould be a brother, perilously sweet when he bade her not to grudge\nhim one kiss. But she knew that she was not as he was. That she had\nlost the right, could she ever have had the right, to live his life,\nto drink of his cup, and to lie on his breast. So she passed on,\nas the young man does in the street, and consoled herself with the\nconsciousness that strength after all may be preferable to sweetness.\n\nAnd she was an honest girl from her heart, and prone to truth, with a\nstrong glimmer of common sense in her character, of which her mother\nhitherto had been altogether unaware. What right had her mother to\nthink that she could be fit to be this young lord's wife, having\nbrought her up in the companionship of small traders in Cumberland?\nShe never blamed her mother. She knew well that her mother had done\nall that was possible on her behalf. But for that small trader they\nwould not even have had a roof to shelter them. But still there was\nthe fact, and she understood it. She was as her bringing up had made\nher, and it was too late now to effect a change. Ah yes;--it was\nindeed too late. It was all very well that lawyers should look upon\nher as an instrument, as a piece of goods that might now, from the\naccident of her ascertained birth, be made of great service to the\nLovel family. Let her be the lord's wife, and everything would be\nright for everybody. It had been very easy to say that! But she\nhad a heart of her own,--a heart to be touched, and won, and given\naway,--and lost. The man who had been so good to them had sought\nfor his reward, and had got it, and could not now be defrauded. Had\nshe been dishonest she would not have dared to defraud him; had she\ndared, she would not have been so dishonest.\n\n\"Did you like him?\" asked the mother, not immediately after the\ninterview, but when the evening came.\n\n\"Oh yes,--how should one not like him?\"\n\n\"How indeed! He is the finest, noblest youth that ever my eyes rested\non, and so like the Lovels.\"\n\n\"Was my father like that?\"\n\n\"Yes indeed, in the shape of his face, and the tone of his voice, and\nthe movement of his eyes; though the sweetness of the countenance was\nall gone in the Devil's training to which he had submitted himself.\nAnd you too are like him, though darker, and with something of the\nMurrays' greater breadth of face. But I can remember portraits at\nLovel Grange,--every one of them,--and all of them were alike. There\nnever was a Lovel but had that natural grace of appearance. You will\ngaze at those portraits, dear, oftener even than I have done; and you\nwill be happy where I was,--oh--so miserable!\"\n\n\"I shall never see them, mamma.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I do not want to see them.\"\n\n\"You say you like him?\"\n\n\"Yes; I like him.\"\n\n\"And why should you not love him well enough to make him your\nhusband?\"\n\n\"I am not fit to be his wife.\"\n\n\"You are fit;--none could be fitter; none others so fit. You are as\nwell born as he, and you have the wealth which he wants. You must\nhave it, if, as you tell me, he says that he will cease to claim it\nas his own. There can be no question of fitness.\"\n\n\"Money will not make a girl fit, mamma.\"\n\n\"You have been brought up as a lady,--and are a lady. I swear I\ndo not know what you mean. If he thinks you fit, and you can like\nhim,--as you say you do,--what more can be wanted? Does he not wish\nit?\"\n\n\"I do not know. He said he did not, and then,--I think he said he\ndid.\"\n\n\"Is that it?\"\n\n\"No, mamma. It is not that; not that only. It is too late!\"\n\n\"Too late! How too late? Anna, you must tell me what you mean. I\ninsist upon it that you tell me what you mean. Why is it too late?\"\nBut Lady Anna was not prepared to tell her meaning. She had certainly\nnot intended to say anything to her mother of her solemn promise to\nDaniel Thwaite. It had been arranged between him and her that nothing\nwas to be said of it till this law business should be all over. He\nhad sworn to her that to him it made no difference, whether she\nshould be proclaimed to be the Lady Anna, the undoubted owner of\nthousands a year, or Anna Murray, the illegitimate daughter of the\nlate Earl's mistress, a girl without a penny, and a nobody in the\nworld's esteem. No doubt they must shape their life very differently\nin this event or in that. How he might demean himself should this\nfortune be adjudged to the Earl, as he thought would be the case when\nhe first made the girl promise to be his wife, he knew well enough.\nHe would do as his father had done before him, and, he did not\ndoubt,--with better result. What might be his fate should the wealth\nof the Lovels become the wealth of his intended wife, he did not yet\nquite foreshadow to himself. How he should face and fight the world\nwhen he came to be accused of having plotted to get all this wealth\nfor himself he did not know. He had dreams of distributing the\ngreater part among the Lovels and the Countess, and taking himself\nand his wife with one-third of it to some new country in which they\nwould not in derision call his wife the Lady Anna, and in which he\nwould be as good a man as any earl. But let all that be as it might,\nthe girl was to keep her secret till the thing should be settled.\nNow, in these latter days, it had come to be believed by him, as by\nnearly everybody else, that the thing was well-nigh settled. The\nSolicitor-General had thrown up the sponge. So said the bystanders.\nAnd now there was beginning to be a rumour that everything was to\nbe set right by a family marriage. The Solicitor-General would not\nhave thrown up the sponge,--so said they who knew him best,--without\nseeing a reason for doing so. Serjeant Bluestone was still indignant,\nand Mr. Hardy was silent and moody. But the world at large were\nbeginning to observe that in this, as in all difficult cases, the\nSolicitor-General tempered the innocence of the dove with the wisdom\nof the serpent. In the meantime Lady Anna by no means intended to\nallow the secret to pass her lips. Whether she ever could tell her\nmother, she doubted; but she certainly would not do so an hour too\nsoon. \"Why is it too late?\" demanded the Countess, repeating her\nquestion with stern severity of voice.\n\n\"I mean that I have not lived all my life as his wife should live.\"\n\n\"Trash! It is trash. What has there been in your life to disgrace\nyou. We have been poor and we have lived as poor people do live. We\nhave not been disgraced.\"\n\n\"No, mamma.\"\n\n\"I will not hear such nonsense. It is a reproach to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, do not say that. I know how good you have been,--how you\nhave thought of me in every thing. Pray do not say that I reproach\nyou!\" And she came and knelt at her mother's lap.\n\n\"I will not, darling; but do not vex me by saying that you are unfit.\nThere is nothing else, dearest?\"\n\n\"No, mamma,\" she said in a low tone, pausing before she told the\nfalsehood.\n\n\"I think it will be arranged that you shall go down to Yoxham. The\npeople there even are beginning to know that we are right, and are\nwilling to acknowledge us. The Earl, whom I cannot but love already\nfor his gracious goodness, has himself declared that he will not\ncarry on the suit. Mr. Goffe has told me that they are anxious to see\nyou there. Of course you must go,--and will go as Lady Anna Lovel.\nMr. Goffe says that some money can now be allowed from the estate,\nand you shall go as becomes the daughter of Earl Lovel when visiting\namong her cousins. You will see this young man there. If he means\nto love you and to be true to you, he will be much there. I do not\ndoubt but that you will continue to like him. And remember this,\nAnna;--that even though your name be acknowledged,--even though all\nthe wealth be adjudged to be your own,--even though some judge on the\nbench shall say that I am the widowed Countess Lovel, it may be all\nundone some day,--unless you become this young man's wife. That woman\nin Italy may be bolstered up at last, if you refuse him. But when you\nare once the wife of young Lord Lovel, no one then can harm us. There\ncan be no going back after that.\" This the Countess said rather to\npromote the marriage, than from any fear of the consequences which\nshe described. Daniel Thwaite was the enemy that now she dreaded, and\nnot the Italian woman, or the Lovel family.\n\nLady Anna could only say that she would go to Yoxham, if she were\ninvited there by Mrs. Lovel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHAVE THEY SURRENDERED?\n\n\nAs all the world heard of what was going on, so did Daniel Thwaite\nhear it among others. He was a hard-working, conscientious, moody\nman, given much to silence among his fellow workmen;--one to whom\nlife was serious enough; not a happy man, though he had before him\na prospect of prosperity which would make most men happy. But he was\nessentially a tender-hearted, affectionate man, who could make a\nsacrifice of himself if he thought it needed for the happiness of one\nhe loved. When he heard of this proposed marriage, he asked himself\nmany questions as to his duty and as to the welfare of the girl. He\ndid love her with all his heart, and he believed thoroughly in her\naffection for himself. He had, as yet, no sufficient reason to doubt\nthat she would be true to him;--but he knew well that an earl's\ncoronet must be tempting to a girl so circumstanced as was Lady Anna.\nThere were moments in which he thought that it was almost his duty\nto give her up, and bid her go and live among those of her own rank.\nBut then he did not believe in rank. He utterly disbelieved in it;\nand in his heart of hearts he felt that he would make a better and a\nfitter husband to this girl than would an earl, with all an earl's\ntemptation to vice. He was ever thinking of some better world to\nwhich he might take her, which had not been contaminated by empty\nnames and an impudent assumption of hereditary, and therefore false,\ndignity. As regarded the money, it would be hers whether she married\nhim or the Earl. And if she loved him, as she had sworn that she did,\nwhy should he be false to her? Or why, as yet, should he think that\nshe would prefer an empty, gilded lordling to the friend who had been\nher friend as far back as her memory could carry her? If she asked\nto be released, then indeed he would release her,--but not without\nexplaining to her, with such eloquence as he might be able to\nuse,--what it was she proposed to abandon, and what to take in place\nof that which she lost. He was a man, silent and under self-control,\nbut self-confident also; and he did believe himself to be a better\nman than young Earl Lovel.\n\nIn making this resolution,--that he would give her back her troth if\nshe asked for it, but not without expressing to her his thoughts as\nhe did so,--he ignored the masterfulness of his own character. There\nare men who exercise dominion, from the nature of their disposition,\nand who do so from their youth upwards, without knowing, till\nadvanced life comes upon them, that any power of dominion belongs to\nthem. Men are persuasive, and imperious withal, who are unconscious\nthat they use burning words to others, whose words to them are never\neven warm. So it was with this man when he spoke to himself in his\nsolitude of his purpose of resigning the titled heiress. To the\narguments, the entreaties, or the threats of others he would pay no\nheed. The Countess might bluster about her rank, and he would heed\nher not at all. He cared nothing for the whole tribe of Lovels. If\nLady Anna asked for release, she should be released. But not till she\nhad heard his words. How scalding these words might be, how powerful\nto prevent the girl from really choosing her own fate, he did not\nknow himself.\n\nThough he lived in the same house with her he seldom saw her,--unless\nwhen he would knock at the door of an evening, and say a few words to\nher mother rather than to her. Since Thomas Thwaite had left London\nfor the last time the Countess had become almost cold to the young\nman. She would not have been so if she could have helped it; but she\nhad begun to fear him, and she could not bring herself to be cordial\nto him either in word or manner. He perceived it at once, and became,\nhimself, cold and constrained.\n\nOnce, and once only, he met Lady Anna alone, after his father's\ndeparture, and before her interview with Lord Lovel. Then he met\nher on the stairs of the house while her mother was absent at the\nlawyer's chambers.\n\n\"Are you here, Daniel, at this hour?\" she asked, going back to the\nsitting-room, whither he followed her.\n\n\"I wanted to see you, and I knew that your mother would be out. It is\nnot often that I do a thing in secret, even though it be to see the\ngirl that I love.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. I do not see you often now.\"\n\n\"Does that matter much to you, Lady Anna?\"\n\n\"Lady Anna!\"\n\n\"I have been instructed, you know, that I am to call you so.\"\n\n\"Not by me, Daniel.\"\n\n\"No;--not by you; not as yet. Your mother's manners are much altered\nto me. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"How can I tell? Mine are not.\"\n\n\"It is no question of manners, sweetheart, between you and me. It has\nnot come to that, I hope. Do you wish for any change,--as regards\nme?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"As to my love, there can be no change in that. If it suits your\nmother to be disdainful to me, I can bear it. I always thought that\nit would come to be so some day.\"\n\nThere was but little more said then. He asked her no further\nquestion;--none at least that it was difficult for her to\nanswer,--and he soon took his leave. He was a passionate rather than\na tender lover, and having once held her in his arms, and kissed her\nlips, and demanded from her a return of his caress, he was patient\nnow to wait till he could claim them as his own. But, two days after\nthe interview between Lord Lovel and his love, he a second time\ncontrived to find her alone.\n\n\"I have come again,\" he said, \"because I knew your mother is out. I\nwould not trouble you with secret meetings but that just now I have\nmuch to say to you. And then, you may be gone from hence before I had\neven heard that you were going.\"\n\n\"I am always glad to see you, Daniel.\"\n\n\"Are you, my sweetheart? Is that true?\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed it is.\"\n\n\"I should be a traitor to doubt you,--and I do not doubt. I will\nnever doubt you if you tell me that you love me.\"\n\n\"You know I love you.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Anna--; or shall I say Lady Anna?\"\n\n\"Lady Anna,--if you wish to scorn me.\"\n\n\"Then never will I call you so, till it shall come to pass that I do\nwish to scorn you. But tell me. Is it true that Earl Lovel was with\nyou the other day?\"\n\n\"He was here the day before yesterday.\"\n\n\"And why did he come.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why did he come? you know that as far as I have yet heard he is\nstill your mother's enemy and yours, and is persecuting you to rob\nyou of your name and of your property. Did he come as a friend?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! certainly as a friend.\"\n\n\"But he still makes his claim.\"\n\n\"No;--he says that he will make it no longer, that he acknowledges\nmamma as my father's widow, and me as my father's heir.\"\n\n\"That is generous,--if that is all.\"\n\n\"Very generous.\"\n\n\"And he does this without condition? There is nothing to be given to\nhim to pay him for this surrender.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to give,\" she said, in that low, sweet, melancholy\nvoice which was common to her always when she spoke of herself.\n\n\"You do not mean to deceive me, dear, I know; but there is a\nsomething to be given; and I am told that he has asked for it, or\ncertainly will ask. And, indeed, I do not think that an earl, noble,\nbut poverty-stricken, would surrender everything without making some\ncounter claim which would lead him by another path to all that he has\nbeen seeking. Anna, you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Yes; I know.\"\n\n\"Has he made no such claim.\"\n\n\"I cannot tell.\"\n\n\"You cannot tell whether or no he has asked you to be his wife?\"\n\n\"No; I cannot tell. Do not look at me like that, Daniel. He came\nhere, and mamma left us together, and he was kind to me. Oh! so kind.\nHe said that he would be a cousin to me, and a brother.\"\n\n\"A brother!\"\n\n\"That was what he said.\"\n\n\"And he meant nothing more than that,--simply to be your brother?\"\n\n\"I think he did mean more. I think he meant that he would try to love\nme so that he might be my husband.\"\n\n\"And what said you to that?\"\n\n\"I told him that it could not be so.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Why then again he said that we were cousins; that I had no nearer\ncousin anywhere, and that he would be good to me and help me, and\nthat the lawsuit should not go on. Oh, Daniel, he was so good!\"\n\n\"Was that all?\"\n\n\"He kissed me, saying that cousins might kiss?\"\n\n\"No, Anna;--cousins such as you and he may not kiss. Do you hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I hear you.\"\n\n\"If you mean to be true to me, there must be no more of that. Do you\nnot know that all this means that he is to win you to be his wife?\nDid he not come to you with that object?\"\n\n\"I think he did, Daniel.\"\n\n\"I think so too, my dear. Surrender! I'll tell you what that\nsurrender means. They perceive at last that they have not a shadow\nof justice, or even a shadow of a chance of unjust success in their\nclaim. That with all their command of money, which is to be spent,\nhowever, out of your property, they can do nothing; that their false\nwitnesses will not come to aid them; that they have not another\ninch of ground on which to stand. Their great lawyer, Sir William\nPatterson, dares not show himself in court with a case so false and\nfraudulent. At last your mother's rights and yours are to be owned.\nThen they turn themselves about, and think in what other way the\nprize may be won. It is not likely that such a prize should be\nsurrendered by a noble lord. The young man is made to understand that\nhe cannot have it all without a burden, and that he must combine his\nwealth with you. That is it, and at once he comes to you, asking\nyou to be his wife, so that in that way he may lay his hands on the\nwealth of which he has striven to rob you.\"\n\n\"Daniel, I do not think that he is like that!\"\n\n\"I tell you he is not only like it,--but that itself. Is it not clear\nas noon-day? He comes here to talk of love who had never seen you\nbefore. Is it thus that men love?\"\n\n\"But, Daniel, he did not talk so.\"\n\n\"I wonder that he was so crafty, believing him as I do to be a fool.\nHe talked of cousinship and brotherhood, and yet gave you to know\nthat he meant you to be his wife. Was it not so?\"\n\n\"I think it was so, in very truth.\"\n\n\"Of course it was so. Do brothers marry their sisters? Were it not\nfor the money, which must be yours, and which he is kind enough to\nsurrender, would he come to you then with his brotherhood, and his\ncousinship, and his mock love? Tell me that, my lady! Can it be real\nlove,--to which there has been no forerunning acquaintance?\"\n\n\"I think not, indeed.\"\n\n\"And must it not be lust of wealth? That may come by hearsay well\nenough. It is a love which requires no great foreknowledge to burn\nwith real strength. He is a gay looking lad, no doubt.\"\n\n\"I do not know as to gay, but he is beautiful.\"\n\n\"Like enough, my girl; with soft hands, and curled hair, and a sweet\nsmell, and a bright colour, and a false heart. I have never seen the\nlad; but for the false heart I can answer.\"\n\n\"I do not think that he is false.\"\n\n\"Not false! and yet he comes to you asking you to be his wife,\njust at that nick of time in which he finds that you,--the right\nowner,--are to have the fortune of which he has vainly endeavoured to\ndefraud you! Is it not so?\"\n\n\"He cannot be wrong to wish to keep up the glory of the family.\"\n\n\"The glory of the family;--yes, the fame of the late lord, who lived\nas though he were a fiend let loose from hell to devastate mankind.\nThe glory of the family! And how will he maintain it? At racecourses,\nin betting-clubs, among loose women, with luscious wines, never doing\none stroke of work for man or God, consuming and never producing,\neither idle altogether or working the work of the devil. That will be\nthe glory of the family. Anna Lovel, you shall give him his choice.\"\nThen he took her hand in his. \"Ask him whether he will have that\nempty, or take all the wealth of the Lovels. You have my leave.\"\n\n\"And if he took the empty hand what should I do?\" she asked.\n\n\"My brave girl, no; though the chance be but one in a thousand\nagainst me, I would not run the risk. But I am putting it to\nyourself, to your reason, to judge of his motives. Can it be that\nhis mind in this matter is not sordid and dishonest? As to you, the\nchoice is open to you.\"\n\n\"No, Daniel; it is open no longer.\"\n\n\"The choice is open to you. If you will tell me that your heart is so\nset upon being the bride of a lord, that truth and honesty and love,\nand all decent feeling from woman to man can be thrown to the wind,\nto make way for such an ambition,--I will say not a word against it.\nYou are free.\"\n\n\"Have I asked for freedom?\"\n\n\"No, indeed! Had you done so, I should have made all this much\nshorter.\"\n\n\"Then why do you harass me by saying it?\"\n\n\"Because it is my duty. Can I know that he comes here seeking you for\nhis wife; can I hear it said on all sides that this family feud is to\nbe settled by a happy family marriage; can I find that you yourself\nare willing to love him as a cousin or a brother,--without finding\nmyself compelled to speak? There are two men seeking you as their\nwife. One can make you a countess; the other simply an honest man's\nwife, and, so far as that can be low, lower than that title of your\nown which they will not allow you to put before your name. If I am\nstill your choice, give me your hand.\" Of course she gave it him.\n\"So be it; and now I shall fear nothing.\" Then she told him that it\nwas intended that she should go to Yoxham as a visitor; but still he\ndeclared that he would fear nothing.\n\nEarly on the next morning he called on Mr. Goffe, the attorney, with\nthe object of making some inquiry as to the condition of the lawsuit.\nMr. Goffe did not much love the elder tailor, but he specially\ndisliked the younger. He was not able to be altogether uncivil to\nthem, because he knew all that they had done to succour his client;\nbut he avoided them when it was possible, and was chary of giving\nthem information. On this occasion Daniel asked whether it was true\nthat the other side had abandoned their claim.\n\n\"Really Mr. Thwaite, I cannot say that they have,\" said Mr. Goffe.\n\n\"Can you say that they have not?\"\n\n\"No; nor that either.\"\n\n\"Had anything of that kind been decided, I suppose you would have\nknown it, Mr. Goffe?\"\n\n\"Really, sir, I cannot say. There are questions, Mr. Thwaite, which a\nprofessional gentleman cannot answer, even to such friends as you and\nyour father have been. When any real settlement is to be made, the\nCountess Lovel will, as a matter of course, be informed.\"\n\n\"She should be informed at once,\" said Daniel Thwaite sternly: \"and\nso should they who have been concerned with her in this matter.\"\n\n\"You, I know, have heavy claims on the Countess.\"\n\n\"My father has claims, which will never vex her, whether paid or not\npaid; but it is right that he should know the truth. I do not believe\nthat the Countess herself knows, though she has been led to think\nthat the claim has been surrendered.\"\n\nMr. Goffe was very sorry, but really he had nothing further to tell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nNEW FRIENDS.\n\n\nThe introduction to Yoxham followed quickly upon the Earl's visit to\nWyndham Street. There was a great consultation at the rectory before\na decision could be made as to the manner in which the invitation\nshould be given. The Earl thought that it should be sent to the\nmother. The rector combated this view very strongly, still hoping\nthat though he might be driven to call the girl Lady Anna, he might\npostpone the necessity of acknowledging the countess-ship of the\nmother till the marriage should have been definitely acknowledged.\nMrs. Lovel thought that if the girl were Lady Anna, then the mother\nmust be the Countess Lovel, and that it would be as well to be hung\nfor a sheep as a lamb. But the wisdom of Aunt Julia sided with her\nbrother, though she did not share her brother's feelings of animosity\nto the two women. \"It is understood that the girl is to be invited,\nand not the mother,\" said Miss Lovel; \"and as it is quite possible\nthat the thing should fail,--in which case the lawsuit might possibly\ngo on,--the less we acknowledge the better.\" The Earl declared that\nthe lawsuit couldn't go on,--that he would not carry it on. \"My dear\nFrederic, you are not the only person concerned. The lady in Italy,\nwho still calls herself Countess Lovel, may renew the suit on her\nown behalf as soon as you have abandoned it. Should she succeed, you\nwould have to make what best compromise you could with her respecting\nthe property. That is the way I understand it.\" This exposition of\nthe case by Miss Lovel was so clear that it carried the day, and\naccordingly a letter was written by Mrs. Lovel, addressed to Lady\nAnna Lovel, asking her to come and spend a few days at Yoxham. She\ncould bring her maid with her or not as she liked; but she could\nhave the service of Mrs. Lovel's lady's maid if she chose to come\nunattended. The letter sounded cold when it was read, but the writer\nsigned herself, \"Yours affectionately, Jane Lovel.\" It was addressed\nto \"The Lady Anna Lovel, to the care of Messrs. Goffe and Goffe,\nsolicitors, Raymond's Buildings, Gray's Inn.\"\n\nLady Anna was allowed to read it first; but she read it in the\npresence of her mother, to whom she handed it at once, as a matter\nof course. A black frown came across the Countess's brow, and a look\nof displeasure, almost of anger, rested on her countenance. \"Is it\nwrong, mamma?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"It is a part of the whole;--but, my dear, it shall not signify.\nConquerors cannot be conquerors all at once, nor can the vanquished\nbe expected to submit themselves with a grace. But it will come. And\nthough they should ignore me utterly, that will be as nothing. I have\nnot clung to this for years past to win their loves.\"\n\n\"I will not go, mamma, if they are unkind to you.\"\n\n\"You must go, my dear. It is only that they are weak enough to think\nthat they can acknowledge you, and yet continue to deny to me my\nrights. But it matters nothing. Of course you shall go,--and you\nshall go as the daughter of the Countess Lovel.\"\n\nThat mention of the lady's-maid had been unfortunate. Mrs. Lovel had\nsimply desired to make it easy for the young lady to come without\na servant to wait upon her, and had treated her husband's far-away\ncousin as elder ladies often do treat those who are younger when the\nquestion of the maid may become a difficulty. But the Countess, who\nwould hardly herself have thought of it, now declared that her girl\nshould go attended as her rank demanded. Lady Anna, therefore, under\nher mother's dictation, wrote the following reply:--\n\n\n   Wyndham Street, 3rd August, 183--.\n\n   DEAR MRS. LOVEL,\n\n   I shall be happy to accept your kind invitation to Yoxham,\n   but can hardly do so before the 10th. On that day I will\n   leave London for York inside the mail-coach. Perhaps you\n   can be kind enough to have me met where the coach stops.\n   As you are so good as to say you can take her in, I will\n   bring my own maid.\n\n   Yours affectionately,\n\n   ANNA LOVEL.\n\n\n\"But, mamma, I don't want a maid,\" said the girl, who had never been\nwaited on in her life, and who had more often than not made her\nmother's bed and her own till they had come up to London.\n\n\"Nevertheless you shall take one. You will have to make other changes\nbesides that; and the sooner that you begin to make them the easier\nthey will be to you.\"\n\nThen at once the Countess made a pilgrimage to Mr. Goffe in search of\nfunds wherewith to equip her girl properly for her new associations.\nShe was to go, as Lady Anna Lovel, to stay with Mrs. Lovel and\nMiss Lovel and the little Lovels. And she was to go as one who was\nto be the chosen bride of Earl Lovel. Of course she must be duly\ncaparisoned. Mr. Goffe made difficulties,--as lawyers always do,--but\nthe needful money was at last forthcoming. Representations had been\nmade in high legal quarters,--to the custodians for the moment of the\nproperty which was to go to the established heir of the late Earl.\nThey had been made conjointly by Goffe and Goffe, and Norton and\nFlick, and the money was forthcoming. Mr. Goffe suggested that a\ngreat deal could not be wanted all at once for the young lady's\ndress. The Countess smiled as she answered, \"You hardly know, Mr.\nGoffe, the straits to which we have been reduced. If I tell you that\nthis dress which I have on is the only one in which I can fitly\nappear even in your chambers, perhaps you will think that I demean\nmyself.\" Mr. Goffe was touched, and signed a sufficient cheque. They\nwere going to succeed, and then everything would be easy. Even if\nthey did not succeed, he could get it passed in the accounts. And if\nnot that--well, he had run greater risks than this for clients whose\ncauses were of much less interest than this of the Countess and her\ndaughter.\n\nThe Countess had mentioned her own gown, and had spoken strict truth\nin what she had said of it;--but not a shilling of Mr. Goffe's\nmoney went to the establishment of a wardrobe for herself. That her\ndaughter should go down to Yoxham Rectory in a manner befitting the\ndaughter of Earl Lovel was at this moment her chief object. Things\nwere purchased by which the poor girl, unaccustomed to such finery,\nwas astounded and almost stupefied. Two needlewomen were taken\nin at the lodgings in Wyndham Street; parcels from Swan and\nEdgar's,--Marshall and Snellgrove were not then, or at least had not\nloomed to the grandeur of an entire block of houses,--addressed to\nLady Anna Lovel, were frequent at the door, somewhat to the disgust\nof the shopmen, who did not like to send goods to Lady Anna Lovel in\nWyndham Street. But ready money was paid, and the parcels came home.\nLady Anna, poor girl, was dismayed much by the parcels, but she was\nat her wits' end when the lady's-maid came,--a young lady, herself\nso sweetly attired that Lady Anna would have envied her in the old\nCumberland days. \"I shall not know what to say to her, mamma,\" said\nLady Anna.\n\n\"It will all come in two days, if you will only be equal to the\noccasion,\" said the Countess, who in providing her child with this\nexpensive adjunct, had made some calculation that the more her\ndaughter was made to feel the luxuries of aristocratic life, the less\nprone would she be to adapt herself to the roughnesses of Daniel\nThwaite the tailor.\n\nThe Countess put her daughter into the mail-coach, and gave her much\nparting advice. \"Hold up your head when you are with them. That is\nall that you have to do. Among them all your blood will be the best.\"\nThis theory of blood was one of which Lady Anna had never been able\neven to realise the meaning. \"And remember this too;--that you are in\ntruth the most wealthy. It is they that should honour you. Of course\nyou will be courteous and gentle with them,--it is your nature; but\ndo not for a moment allow yourself to be conscious that you are their\ninferior.\" Lady Anna,--who could think but little of her birth,--to\nwhom it had been throughout her life a thing plaguesome rather than\nprofitable,--could remember only what she had been in Cumberland,\nand her binding obligation to the tailor's son. She could remember\nbut that and the unutterable sweetness of the young man who had once\nappeared before her,--to whom she knew that she must be inferior.\n\"Hold up your head among them, and claim your own always,\" said the\nCountess.\n\nThe rectory carriage was waiting for her at the inn yard in York, and\nin it was Miss Lovel. When the hour had come it was thought better\nthat the wise woman of the family should go than any other. For the\nladies of Yoxham were quite as anxious as to the Lady Anna as was she\nin respect of them. What sort of a girl was this that they were to\nwelcome among them as the Lady Anna,--who had lived all her life with\ntailors, and with a mother of whom up to quite a late date they had\nthought all manner of evil? The young lord had reported well of her,\nsaying that she was not only beautiful, but feminine, of soft modest\nmanners, and in all respects like a lady. The Earl, however, was but\na young man, likely to be taken by mere beauty; and it might be that\nthe girl had been clever enough to hoodwink him. So much evil had\nbeen believed that a report stating that all was good could not be\naccepted at once as true. Miss Lovel would be sure to find out, even\nin the space of an hour's drive, and Miss Lovel went to meet her. She\ndid not leave the carriage, but sent the footman to help Lady Anna\nLovel from the coach. \"My dear,\" said Miss Lovel, \"I am very glad\nto see you. Oh, you have brought a maid! We didn't think you would.\nThere is a seat behind which she can occupy.\"\n\n\"Mamma thought it best. I hope it is not wrong, Mrs. Lovel.\"\n\n\"I ought to have introduced myself. I am Miss Lovel, and the rector\nof Yoxham is my brother. It does not signify about the maid in the\nleast. We can do very well with her. I suppose she has been with you\na long time.\"\n\n\"No, indeed;--she only came the day before yesterday.\" And so Miss\nLovel learned the whole story of the lady's-maid.\n\nLady Anna said very little, but Miss Lovel explained a good many\nthings during the journey. The young lord was not at Yoxham. He was\nwith a friend in Scotland, but would be home about the 20th. The two\nboys were at home for the holidays, but would go back to school in a\nfortnight. Minnie Lovel, the daughter, had a governess. The rectory,\nfor a parsonage, was a tolerably large house, and convenient. It had\nbeen Lord Lovel's early home, but at present he was not much there.\n\"He thinks it right to go to Lovel Grange during a part of the\nautumn. I suppose you have seen Lovel Grange.\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed. But you lived near it;--did you not?\"\n\n\"No, not near;--about fifteen miles, I think. I was born there, but\nhave never been there since I was a baby.\"\n\n\"Oh!--you were born there. Of course you know that it is Lord Lovel's\nseat now. I do not know that he likes it, though the scenery is\nmagnificent. But a landlord has to live, at least for some period of\nthe year, upon his property. You saw my nephew.\"\n\n\"Yes; he came to us once.\"\n\n\"I hope you liked him. We think him very nice. But then he is almost\nthe same as a son here. Do you care about visiting the poor?\"\n\n\"I have never tried,\" said Lady Anna.\n\n\"Oh dear!\"\n\n\"We have been so poor ourselves;--we were just one of them.\" Then\nMiss Lovel perceived that she had made a mistake. But she was\ngenerous enough to recognize the unaffected simplicity of the girl,\nand almost began to think well of her.\n\n\"I hope you will come round the parish with us. We shall be very\nglad. Yoxham is a large parish, with scattered hamlets, and there is\nplenty to do. The manufactories are creeping up to us, and we have\nalready a large mill at Yoxham Lock. My brother has to keep two\ncurates now. Here we are, my dear, and I hope we shall be able to\nmake you happy.\"\n\nMrs. Lovel did not like the maid, and Mr. Lovel did not like it at\nall. \"And yet we heard when we were up in town that they literally\nhad not anything to live on,\" said the parson. \"I hope that, after\nall, we may not be making fools of ourselves.\" But there was no help\nfor it, and the maid was of course taken in.\n\nThe children had been instructed to call their cousin Lady\nAnna,--unless they heard their mother drop the title, and then they\nwere to drop it also. They were not so young but what they had all\nheard the indiscreet vigour with which their father had ridiculed the\nclaim to the title, and had been something at a loss to know whence\nthe change had come. \"Perhaps they are as they call themselves,\" the\nrector had said, \"and, if so, heaven forbid that we should not give\nthem their due.\" After this the three young ones, discussing the\nmatter among themselves, had made up their minds that Lady Anna was\nno cousin of theirs,--but \"a humbug.\" When, however, they saw her\ntheir hearts relented, and the girl became soft, and the boys became\ncivil. \"Papa,\" said Minnie Lovel, on the second day, \"I hope she is\nour cousin.\"\n\n\"I hope so too, my dear.\"\n\n\"I think she is. She looks as if she ought to be because she is so\npretty.\"\n\n\"Being pretty, my dear, is not enough. You should love people because\nthey are good.\"\n\n\"But I would not like all the good people to be my cousins;--would\nyou, papa? Old widow Grimes is a very good old woman; but I don't\nwant to have her for a cousin.\"\n\n\"My dear, you are talking about what you don't understand.\"\n\nBut Minnie did in truth understand the matter better than her father.\nBefore three or four days had passed she knew that their guest was\nlovable,--whether cousin or no cousin; and she knew also that the\nnewcomer was of such nature and breeding as made her fit to be a\ncousin. All the family had as yet called her Lady Anna, but Minnie\nthought that the time had come in which she might break through the\nlaw. \"I think I should like to call you just Anna, if you will let\nme,\" she said. They two were in the guest's bedroom, and Minnie was\nleaning against her new friend's shoulder.\n\n\"Oh, I do so wish you would. I do so hate to be called Lady.\"\n\n\"But you are Lady Anna,--arn't you?\"\n\n\"And you are Miss Mary Lovel, but you wouldn't like everybody in the\nhouse to call you so. And then there has been so much said about it\nall my life, that it makes me quite unhappy. I do so wish your mamma\nwouldn't call me Lady Anna.\" Whereupon Minnie very demurely explained\nthat she could not answer for her mamma, but that she would always\ncall her friend Anna,--when papa wasn't by.\n\nBut Minnie was better than her promise. \"Mamma,\" she said the next\nday, \"do you know that she hates to be called Lady Anna.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it. She told me so. Everybody has always been talking\nabout it ever since she was born, and she says she is so sick of it.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, people must be called by their names. If it is her\nproper name she ought not to hate it. I can understand that people\nshould hate an assumed name.\"\n\n\"I am Miss Mary Lovel, but I should not at all like it if everybody\ncalled me Miss Mary. The servants call me Miss Mary, but if papa and\naunt Julia did so, I should think they were scolding me.\"\n\n\"But Lady Anna is not papa's daughter.\"\n\n\"She is his cousin. Isn't she his cousin, mamma? I don't think people\nought to call their cousins Lady Anna. I have promised that I won't.\nCousin Frederic said that she was his cousin. What will he call her?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell, my dear. We shall all know her better by that time.\"\nMrs. Lovel, however, followed her daughter's lead, and from that time\nthe poor girl was Anna to all of them,--except to the rector. He\nlistened, and thought that he would try it; but his heart failed him.\nHe would have preferred that she should be an impostor, were that\nstill possible. He would so much have preferred that she should not\nexist at all! He did not care for her beauty. He did not feel the\ncharm of her simplicity. It was one of the hardships of the world\nthat he should be forced to have her there in his rectory. The Lovel\nwealth was indispensable to the true heir of the Lovels, and on\nbehalf of his nephew and his family he had been induced to consent;\nbut he could not love the interloper. He still dreamed of coming\nsurprises that would set the matter right in a manner that would be\nmuch preferable to a marriage. The girl might be innocent,--as his\nwife and sister told him; but he was sure that the mother was an\nintriguing woman. It would be such a pity that they should have\nentertained the girl, if,--after all,--the woman should at last be\nbut a pseudo-countess! As others had ceased to call her Lady Anna,\nhe could not continue to do so; but he managed to live on with her\nwithout calling her by any name.\n\nIn the meantime Cousin Anna went about among the poor with Minnie\nand Aunt Julia, and won golden opinions. She was soft, feminine,\nalmost humble,--but still with a dash of humour in her, when she was\nsufficiently at her ease with them to be happy. There was very much\nin the life which she thoroughly enjoyed. The green fields, and the\nair which was so pleasant to her after the close heat of the narrow\nLondon streets, and the bright parsonage garden, and the pleasant\nservices of the country church,--and doubtless also the luxuries of\na rich, well-ordered household. Those calculations of her mother had\nnot been made without a true basis. The softness, the niceness, the\nease, the grace of the people around her, won upon her day by day,\nand hour by hour. The pleasant idleness of the drawing-room, with its\nbooks and music, and unstrained chatter of family voices, grew upon\nher as so many new charms. To come down with bright ribbons and clean\nunruffled muslin to breakfast, with nothing to do which need ruffle\nthem unbecomingly, and then to dress for dinner with silk and gauds,\nbefore ten days were over, had made life beautiful to her. She seemed\nto live among roses and perfumes. There was no stern hardness in the\nlife, as there had of necessity been in that which she had ever lived\nwith her mother. The caresses of Minnie Lovel soothed and warmed her\nheart;--and every now and again, when the eyes of Aunt Julia were not\nupon her, she was tempted to romp with the boys. Oh! that they had\nreally been her brothers!\n\nBut in the midst of all there was ever present to her the prospect of\nsome coming wretchedness. The life which she was leading could not\nbe her life. That Earl was coming,--that young Apollo,--and he would\nagain ask her to be his wife. She knew that she could not be his\nwife. She was there, as she understood well, that she might give all\nthis wealth that was to be hers to the Lovel family; and when she\nrefused to give herself,--as the only way in which that wealth could\nbe conveyed,--they would turn her out from their pleasant home.\nThen she must go back to the other life, and be the wife of Daniel\nThwaite; and soft things must be at an end with her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nTHE EARL ARRIVES.\n\n\nAt the end of a fortnight the boys had gone back to school, and Lord\nLovel was to reach the rectory in time for dinner that evening. There\nwas a little stir throughout the rectory, as an earl is an earl\nthough he be in his uncle's house, and rank will sway even aunts\nand cousins. The parson at present was a much richer man than the\npeer;--but the peer was at the head of all the Lovels, and then it\nwas expected that his poverty would quickly be made to disappear.\nAll that Lovel money which had been invested in bank shares, Indian\nrailways, Russian funds, Devon consols, and coal mines, was to become\nhis,--if not in one way, then in another. The Earl was to be a\ntopping man, and the rectory cook was ordered to do her best. The big\nbedroom had been made ready, and the parson looked at his '99 port\nand his '16 Margaux. In those days men drank port, and champagne at\ncountry houses was not yet a necessity. To give the rector of Yoxham\nhis due it must be said of him that he would have done his very best\nfor the head of his family had there been no large fortune within the\nyoung lord's grasp. The Lovels had ever been true to the Lovels, with\nthe exception of that late wretched Earl,--the Lady Anna's father.\n\nBut if the rector and his wife were alive to the importance of the\nexpected arrival, what must have been the state of Lady Anna! They\nhad met but once before, and during that meeting they had been alone\ntogether. There had grown up, she knew not how, during those few\nminutes, a heavenly sweetness between them. He had talked to her with\na voice that had been to her ears as the voice of a god,--it had been\nso sweet and full of music! He had caressed her,--but with a caress\nso gentle and pure that it had been to her void of all taint of evil.\nIt had perplexed her for a moment,--but had left no sense of wrong\nbehind it. He had told her that he loved her,--that he would love\nher dearly; but had not scared her in so telling her, though she\nknew she could never give him back such love as that of which he\nspoke to her. There had been a charm in it, of which she delighted\nto dream,--fancying that she could remember it for ever, as a green\nisland in her life; but could so best remember it if she were assured\nthat she should never see him more. But now she was to see him again,\nand the charm must be renewed,--or else the dream dispelled for\never. Alas! it must be the latter. She knew that the charm must be\ndispelled.\n\nBut there was a doubt on her own mind whether it would not be\ndispelled without any effort on her part. It would vanish at once\nif he were to greet her as the Lovels had greeted her on her first\ncoming. She could partly understand that the manner of their meeting\nin London had thrust upon him a necessity for flattering tenderness\nwith which he might well dispense when he met her among his family.\nHad he really loved her,--had he meant to love her,--he would hardly\nhave been absent so long after her coming. She had been glad that\nhe had been absent,--so she assured herself,--because there could\nnever be any love between them. Daniel Thwaite had told her that\nthe brotherly love which had been offered was false love,--must be\nfalse,--was no love at all. Do brothers marry sisters; and had not\nthis man already told her that he wished to make her his wife? And\nthen there must never be another kiss. Daniel Thwaite had told her\nthat; and he was, not only her lover, but her master also. This was\nthe rule by which she would certainly hold. She would be true to\nDaniel Thwaite. And yet she looked for the lord's coming, as one\nlooks for the rising of the sun of an early morning,--watching for\nthat which shall make all the day beautiful.\n\nAnd he came. The rector and his wife, and Aunt Julia and Minnie, all\nwent out into the hall to meet him, and Anna was left alone in the\nlibrary, where they were wont to congregate before dinner. It was\nalready past seven, and every one was dressed. A quarter of an hour\nwas to be allowed to the lord, and he was to be hurried up at once to\nhis bedroom. She would not see him till he came down ready, and all\nhurried, to lead his aunt to the dining-room. She heard the scuffle\nin the hall. There were kisses;--and a big kiss from Minnie to her\nmuch-prized Cousin Fred; and a loud welcome from the full-mouthed\nrector. \"And where is Anna?\"--the lord asked. They were the first\nwords he spoke, and she heard them, ah! so plainly. It was the same\nvoice,--sweet, genial, and manly; sweet to her beyond all sweetness\nthat she could conceive.\n\n\"You shall see her when you come down from dressing,\" said Mrs.\nLovel,--in a low voice, but still audible to the solitary girl.\n\n\"I will see her before I go up to dress,\" said the lord, walking\nthrough them, and in through the open door to the library. \"So, here\nyou are. I am so glad to see you! I had sworn to go into Scotland\nbefore the time was fixed for your coming,--before I had met\nyou,--and I could not escape. Have you thought ill of me because I\nhave not been here to welcome you sooner?\"\n\n\"No,--my lord.\"\n\n\"There are horrible penalties for anybody who calls me lord in this\nhouse;--are there not, Aunt Jane? But I see my uncle wants his\ndinner.\"\n\n\"I'll take you up-stairs, Fred,\" said Minnie, who was still holding\nher cousin's hand.\n\n\"I am coming. I will only say that I would sooner see you here than\nin any house in England.\"\n\nThen he went, and during the few minutes that he spent in dressing\nlittle or nothing was spoke in the library. The parson in his heart\nwas not pleased by the enthusiasm with which the young man greeted\nthis new cousin; and yet, why should he not be enthusiastic if it was\nintended that they should be man and wife?\n\n\"Now, Lady Anna,\" said the rector, as he offered her his arm to lead\nher out to dinner. It was but a mild corrective to the warmth of his\nnephew. The lord lingered a moment with his aunt in the library.\n\n\"Have you not got beyond that with her yet?\" he asked.\n\n\"Your uncle is more old fashioned than you are, Fred. Things did not\ngo so quick when he was young.\"\n\nIn the evening he came and lounged on a double-seated ottoman behind\nher, and she soon found herself answering a string of questions. Had\nshe been happy at Yoxham? Did she like the place? What had she been\ndoing? \"Then you know Mrs. Grimes already?\" She laughed as she said\nthat she did know Mrs. Grimes. \"The lion of Yoxham is Mrs. Grimes.\nShe is supposed to have all the misfortunes and all the virtues to\nwhich humanity is subject. And how do you and Minnie get on? Minnie\nis my prime minister. The boys, I suppose, teased you out of your\nlife?\"\n\n\"I did like them so much! I never knew a boy till I saw them, Lord\nLovel.\"\n\n\"They take care to make themselves known, at any rate. But they are\nnice, good-humoured lads,--taking after their mother. Don't tell\ntheir father I said so. Do you think it pretty about here?\"\n\n\"Beautifully pretty.\"\n\n\"Just about Yoxham,--because there is so much wood. But this is not\nthe beautiful part of Yorkshire, you know. I wonder whether we could\nmake an expedition to Wharfedale and Bolton Abbey. You would say that\nthe Wharfe was pretty. We'll try and plan it. We should have to sleep\nout one night; but that would make it all the jollier. There isn't a\nbetter inn in England than the Devonshire arms;--and I don't think a\npleasanter spot. Aunt Jane,--couldn't we go for one night to Bolton\nAbbey?\"\n\n\"It is very far, Frederic.\"\n\n\"Thirty miles or so;--that ought to be nothing in Yorkshire. We'll\nmanage it. We could get post-horses from York, and the carriage\nwould take us all. My uncle, you must know, is very chary about\nthe carriage horses, thinking that the corn of idleness,--which is\ndestructive to young men and women,--is very good for cattle. But\nwe'll manage it, and you shall jump over the Stryd.\" Then he told\nher the story how the youth was drowned--and how the monks moaned;\nand he got away to other legends, to the white doe of Rylston, and\nLandseer's picture of the abbey in olden times. She had heard nothing\nbefore of these things,--or indeed of such things, and the hearing\nthem was very sweet to her. The parson, who was still displeased,\nwent to sleep. Minnie had been sent to bed, and Aunt Julia and Aunt\nJane every now and again put in a word. It was resolved before the\nevening was over that the visit should be made to Bolton Abbey. Of\ncourse, their nephew ought to have opportunities of making love to\nthe girl he was doomed to marry. \"Good night, dearest,\" he said when\nshe went to bed. She was sure that the last word had been so spoken,\nand that no ear but her own had heard it. She could not tell him\nthat such word should not be spoken; and yet she felt that the word\nwould be almost as offensive as the kiss to Daniel Thwaite. She must\ncontrive some means of telling him that she could not, would not,\nmust not be his dearest.\n\nShe had now received two letters from her mother since she had been\nat Yoxham, and in each of them there were laid down for her plain\ninstructions as to her conduct. It was now the middle of August, and\nit was incumbent upon her to allow matters so to arrange themselves,\nthat the marriage might be declared to be a settled thing when the\ncase should come on in November. Mr. Goffe and Mr. Flick had met\neach other, and everything was now understood by the two parties of\nlawyers. If the Earl and Lady Anna were then engaged with the mutual\nconsent of all interested,--and so engaged that a day could be fixed\nfor the wedding,--then, when the case was opened in court, would the\nSolicitor-General declare that it was the intention of Lord Lovel\nto make no further opposition to the claims of the Countess and her\ndaughter, and it would only remain for Serjeant Bluestone to put in\nthe necessary proofs of the Cumberland marriage and of the baptism\nof Lady Anna. The Solicitor-General would at the same time state\nto the court that an alliance had been arranged between these\ndistant cousins, and that in that way everything would be settled.\nBut,--and in this clause of her instructions the Countess was most\nurgent,--this could not be done unless the marriage were positively\nsettled. Mr. Flick had been very urgent in pointing out to Mr. Goffe\nthat in truth their evidence was very strong to prove that when\nthe Earl married the now so-called Countess, his first wife was\nstill living, though they gave no credit to the woman who now\ncalled herself the Countess. But, in either case,--whether the\nItalian countess were now alive or now dead,--the daughter would be\nillegitimate, and the second marriage void, if their surmise on this\nhead should prove to be well founded. But the Italian party could of\nitself do nothing, and the proposed marriage would set everything\nright. But the evidence must be brought into court and further\nsifted, unless the marriage were a settled thing by November. All\nthis the Countess explained at great length in her letters, calling\nupon her daughter to save herself, her mother, and the family.\n\nLady Anna answered the first epistle,--or rather, wrote another in\nreturn to it;--but she said nothing of her noble lover, except that\nLord Lovel had not as yet come to Yoxham. She confined herself to\nsimple details of her daily life, and a prayer that her dear mother\nmight be happy. The second letter from the Countess was severe in its\ntone,--asking why no promise had been made, no assurance given,--no\nallusion made to the only subject that could now be of interest. She\nimplored her child to tell her that she was disposed to listen to the\nEarl's suit. This letter was in her pocket when the Earl arrived, and\nshe took it out and read it again after the Earl had whispered in her\near that word so painfully sweet.\n\nShe proposed to answer it before breakfast on the following morning.\nAt Yoxham rectory they breakfasted at ten, and she was always up at\nleast before eight. She determined as she laid herself down that she\nwould think of it all night. It might be best, she believed, to tell\nher mother the whole truth,--that she had already promised everything\nto Daniel Thwaite, and that she could not go back from her word. Then\nshe began to build castles in the air,--castles which she declared to\nherself must ever be in the air,--of which Lord Lovel, and not Daniel\nThwaite, was the hero, owner, and master. She assured herself that\nshe was not picturing to herself any prospect of a really possible\nlife, but was simply dreaming of an impossible Elysium. How many\npeople would she make happy, were she able to let that young\nPhoebus know in one half-uttered word,--or with a single silent\nglance,--that she would in truth be his dearest. It could not be so.\nShe was well aware of that. But surely she might dream of it. All the\ncares of that careful, careworn mother would then be at an end. How\ndelightful would it be to her to welcome that sorrowful one to her\nown bright home, and to give joy where joy had never yet been known!\nHow all the lawyers would praise her, and tell her that she had saved\na noble family from ruin. She already began to have feelings about\nthe family to which she had been a stranger before she had come among\nthe Lovels. And if it really would make him happy, this Phoebus,\nhow glorious would that be! How fit he was to be made happy! Daniel\nhad said that he was sordid, false, fraudulent, and a fool;--but\nDaniel did not, could not, understand the nature of the Lovels. And\nthen she herself;--how would it be with her? She had given her heart\nto Daniel Thwaite, and she had but one heart to give. Had it not been\nfor that, it would have been very sweet to love that young curled\ndarling. There were two sorts of life, and now she had had an insight\ninto each. Daniel had told her that this soft, luxurious life was\nthoroughly bad. He could not have known when saying so, how much\nwas done for their poor neighbours by such as even these Lovels. It\ncould not be wrong to be soft, and peaceful, and pretty, to enjoy\nsweet smells, to sit softly, and eat off delicately painted china\nplates,--as long as no one was defrauded, and many were comforted.\nDaniel Thwaite, she believed, never went to church. Here at Yoxham\nthere were always morning prayers, and they went to church twice\nevery Sunday. She had found it very pleasant to go to church, and to\nbe led along in the easy path of self-indulgent piety on which they\nall walked at Yoxham. The church seats at Yoxham were broad, with\nsoft cushions, and the hassocks were well stuffed. Surely, Daniel\nThwaite did not know everything. As she thus built her castles in the\nair,--castles so impossible to be inhabited,--she fell asleep before\nshe had resolved what letter she should write.\n\nBut in the morning she did write her letter. It must be written,--and\nwhen the family were about the house, she would be too disturbed for\nso great an effort. It ran as follows:--\n\n\n   Yoxham, Friday.\n\n   DEAREST MAMMA,\n\n   I am much obliged for your letter, which I got the\n   day before yesterday. Lord Lovel came here yesterday,\n   or perhaps I might have answered it then. Everybody\n   here seems to worship him almost, and he is so good to\n   everybody! We are all to go on a visit to Bolton Abbey,\n   and sleep at an inn somewhere, and I am sure I shall like\n   it very much, for they say it is most beautiful. If you\n   look at the map, it is nearly in a straight line between\n   here and Kendal, but only much nearer to York. The day is\n   not fixed yet, but I believe it will be very soon.\n\n   I shall be so glad if the lawsuit can be got over, for\n   your sake, dearest mamma. I wish they could let you have\n   your title and your share of the money, and let Lord Lovel\n   have the rest, because he is head of the family. That\n   would be fairest, and I can't see why it should not be so.\n   Your share would be quite enough for you and me. I can't\n   say anything about what you speak of. He has said nothing,\n   and I'm sure I hope he won't. I don't think I could do it;\n   and I don't think the lawyers ought to want me to. I think\n   it is very wrong of them to say so. We are strangers, and\n   I feel almost sure that I could never be what he would\n   want. I don't think people ought to marry for money.\n\n   Dearest mamma, pray do not be angry with me. If you are,\n   you will kill me. I am very happy here, and nobody has\n   said anything about my going away. Couldn't you ask\n   Serjeant Bluestone whether something couldn't be done to\n   divide the money, so that there might be no more law? I am\n   sure he could if he liked, with Mr. Goffe and the other\n   men.\n\n   Dearest mamma, I am,\n   Your most affectionate Daughter,\n\n   ANNA LOVEL.\n\n\nWhen the moment came, and the pen was in her hand, she had not\nthe courage to mention the name of Daniel Thwaite. She knew that\nthe fearful story must be told, but at this moment she comforted\nherself,--or tried to comfort herself,--by remembering that Daniel\nhimself had enjoined that their engagement must yet for a while be\nkept secret.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nWHARFEDALE.\n\n\nThe visit to Wharfedale was fixed for Monday and Tuesday, and on the\nMonday morning they started, after an early breakfast. The party\nconsisted of Aunt Jane, Aunt Julia, Lady Anna, Minnie, and Mr. Cross,\none of the rector's curates. The rector would not accompany them,\nexcusing himself to the others generally on the ground that he could\nnot be absent from his parish on those two days. To his wife and\nsister he explained that he was not able, as yet, to take pleasure in\nsuch a party as this with Lady Anna. There was no knowing, he said,\nwhat might happen. It was evident that he did not mean to open his\nheart to Lady Anna, at any rate till the marriage should be settled.\n\nAn open carriage, which would take them all, was ordered,--with four\npost horses, and two antiquated postboys, with white hats and blue\njackets, and yellow breeches. Minnie and the curate sat on the box,\nand there was a servant in the rumble. Rooms at the inn had been\nordered, and everything was done in proper lordly manner. The sun\nshone brightly above their heads, and Anna, having as yet received\nno further letter from her mother, was determined to be happy. Four\nhorses took them to Bolton Bridge, and then, having eaten lunch and\nordered dinner, they started for their ramble in the woods.\n\nThe first thing to be seen at Bolton Abbey is, of course, the Abbey.\nThe Abbey itself, as a ruin,--a ruin not so ruinous but that a part\nof it is used for a modern church,--is very well; but the glory of\nBolton Abbey is in the river which runs round it and in the wooded\nbanks which overhang it. No more luxuriant pasture, no richer\nfoliage, no brighter water, no more picturesque arrangement of the\nfreaks of nature, aided by the art and taste of man, is to be found,\nperhaps, in England. Lady Anna, who had been used to wilder scenery\nin her native county, was delighted. Nothing had ever been so\nbeautiful as the Abbey;--nothing so lovely as the running Wharfe!\nMight they not climb up among those woods on the opposite bank?\nLord Lovel declared that, of course they would climb up among the\nwoods,--it was for that purpose they had come. That was the way to\nthe Stryd,--over which he was determined that Lady Anna should be\nmade to jump.\n\nBut the river below the Abbey is to be traversed by stepping-stones,\nwhich, to the female uninitiated foot, appear to be full of danger.\nThe Wharfe here is no insignificant brook, to be overcome by a long\nstride and a jump. There is a causeway, of perhaps forty stones,\nacross it, each some eighteen inches distant from the other, which,\nflat and excellent though they be, are perilous from their number.\nMrs. Lovel, who knew the place of old, had begun by declaring that\nno consideration should induce her to cross the water. Aunt Julia\nhad proposed that they should go along the other bank, on the Abbey\nside of the river, and thence cross by the bridge half a mile up.\nBut the Earl was resolved that he would take his cousin over the\nstepping-stones; and Minnie and the curate were equally determined.\nMinnie, indeed, had crossed the river, and was back again, while the\nmatter was still being discussed. Aunt Julia, who was strong-limbed,\nas well as strong-minded, at last assented, the curate having\npromised all necessary aid. Mrs. Lovel seated herself at a distance\nto see the exploit; and then Lord Lovel started, with Lady Anna,\nturning at every stone to give a hand to his cousin.\n\n\"Oh, they are very dreadful!\" said Lady Anna, when about a dozen had\nbeen passed.\n\nThe black water was flowing fast, fast beneath her feet; the stones\nbecame smaller and smaller to her imagination, and the apertures\nbetween them broader and broader.\n\n\"Don't look at the water, dear,\" said the lord, \"but come on quick.\"\n\n\"I can't come on quick. I shall never get over. Oh, Frederic!\" That\nmorning she had promised that she would call him Frederic. Even\nDaniel could not think it wrong that she should call her cousin\nby his Christian name. \"It's no good, I can't do that one,--it's\ncrooked. Mayn't I go back again?\"\n\n\"You can't go back, dear. It is only up to your knees, if you do\ngo in. But take my hand. There,--all the others are straight,--you\nmust come on, or Aunt Julia will catch us. After two or three times,\nyou'll hop over like a milkmaid. There are only half-a-dozen more.\nHere we are. Isn't that pretty?\"\n\n\"I thought I never should have got over. I wouldn't go back for\nanything. But it is lovely; and I am so much obliged to you for\nbringing me here. We can go back another way?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--but now we'll get up the bank. Give me your hand.\" Then\nhe took her along the narrow, twisting, steep paths, to the top of\nthe wooded bank, and they were soon beyond the reach of Aunt Julia,\nMinnie, and the curate.\n\nIt was very pleasant, very lovely, and very joyous; but there was\nstill present to her mind some great fear. The man was there with her\nas an acknowledged lover,--a lover, acknowledged to be so by all but\nherself; but she could not lawfully have any lover but him who was\nnow slaving at his trade in London. She must tell this gallant lord\nthat he must not be her lover; and, as they went along, she was\nalways meditating how she might best tell him, when the moment for\ntelling him should come. But on that morning, during the entire walk,\nhe said no word to her which seemed quite to justify the telling. He\ncalled her by sweet, petting names,--Anna, my girl, pretty coz, and\nsuch like. He would hold her hand twice longer than he would have\nheld that of either aunt in helping her over this or that little\ndifficulty,--and would help her when no help was needed. He talked to\nher, of small things, as though he and she must needs have kindred\ninterests. He spoke to her of his uncle as though, near as his uncle\nwas, the connection were not nigh so close as that between him and\nher. She understood it with a half understanding,--feeling that in\nall this he was in truth making love to her, and yet telling herself\nthat he said no more than cousinship might warrant. But the autumn\ncolours were bright, and the river rippled, and the light breeze\ncame down from the mountains, and the last of the wild flowers were\nstill sweet in the woods. After a while she was able to forget her\ndifficulties, to cease to think of Daniel, and to find in her cousin,\nnot a lover, but simply the pleasantest friend that fortune had ever\nsent her.\n\nAnd so they came, all alone,--for Aunt Julia, though both limbs and\nmind were strong, had not been able to keep up with them,--all alone\nto the Stryd. The Stryd is a narrow gully or passage, which the\nwaters have cut for themselves in the rocks, perhaps five or six\nfeet broad, where the river passes, but narrowed at the top by an\noverhanging mass which in old days withstood the wearing of the\nstream, till the softer stone below was cut away, and then was left\nbridging over a part of the chasm below. There goes a story that a\nmountain chieftain's son, hunting the stag across the valley when the\nfloods were out, in leaping the stream, from rock to rock, failed to\nmake good his footing, was carried down by the rushing waters, and\ndashed to pieces among the rocks. Lord Lovel told her the tale, as\nthey sat looking at the now innocent brook, and then bade her follow\nhim as he leaped from edge to edge.\n\n\"I couldn't do it;--indeed, I couldn't,\" said the shivering girl.\n\n\"It is barely a step,\" said the Earl, jumping over, and back again.\n\"Going from this side, you couldn't miss to do it, if you tried.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I should tumble in. It makes me sick to look at you while\nyou are leaping.\"\n\n\"You'd jump over twice the distance on dry ground.\"\n\n\"Then let me jump on dry ground.\"\n\n\"I've set my heart upon it. Do you think I'd ask you if I wasn't\nsure?\"\n\n\"You want to make another legend of me.\"\n\n\"I want to leave Aunt Julia behind, which we shall certainly do.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I can't afford to drown myself just that you may run away\nfrom Aunt Julia. You can run by yourself, and I will wait for Aunt\nJulia.\"\n\n\"That is not exactly my plan. Be a brave girl, now, and stand up, and\ndo as I bid you.\"\n\nThen she stood up on the edge of the rock, holding tight by his arm.\nHow pleasant it was to be thus frightened, with such a protector near\nher to insure her safety! And yet the chasm yawned, and the water ran\nrapid and was very black. But if he asked her to make the spring, of\ncourse she must make it. What would she not have done at his bidding?\n\n\"I can almost touch you, you see,\" he said, as he stood opposite,\nwith his arm out ready to catch her hand.\n\n\"Oh, Frederic, I don't think I can.\"\n\n\"You can very well, if you will only jump.\"\n\n\"It is ever so many yards.\"\n\n\"It is three feet. I'll back Aunt Julia to do it for a promise of ten\nshillings to the infirmary.\"\n\n\"I'll give the ten shillings, if you'll only let me off.\"\n\n\"I won't let you off,--so you might as well come at once.\"\n\nThen she stood and shuddered for a moment, looking with beseeching\neyes up into his face. Of course she meant to jump. Of course she\nwould have been disappointed had Aunt Julia come and interrupted her\njumping. Yes,--she would jump into his arms. She knew that he would\ncatch her. At that moment her memory of Daniel Thwaite had become\nfaint as the last shaded glimmer of twilight. She shut her eyes for\nhalf a moment, then opened them, looked into his face, and made her\nspring. As she did so, she struck her foot against a rising ledge of\nthe rock, and, though she covered more than the distance in her leap,\nshe stumbled as she came to the ground, and fell into his arms. She\nhad sprained her ankle, in her effort to recover herself.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" he asked, holding her close to his side.\n\n\"No;--I think not;--only a little, that is. I was so awkward.\"\n\n\"I shall never forgive myself if you are hurt.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to forgive. I'll sit down for a moment. It was my\nown fault because I was so stupid,--and it does not in the least\nsignify. I know what it is now; I've sprained my ankle.\"\n\n\"There is nothing so painful as that.\"\n\n\"It hurts a little, but it will go off. It wasn't the jump, but I\ntwisted my foot somehow. If you look so unhappy, I'll get up and jump\nback again.\"\n\n\"I am unhappy, dearest.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you mustn't.\" The prohibition might be taken as applying to\nthe epithet of endearment, and thereby her conscience be satisfied.\nThen he bent over her, looking anxiously into her face as she winced\nwith the pain, and he took her hand and kissed it. \"Oh, no,\" she\nsaid, gently struggling to withdraw the hand which he held. \"Here is\nAunt Julia. You had better just move.\" Not that she would have cared\na straw for the eyes of Aunt Julia, had it not been that the image\nof Daniel Thwaite again rose strong before her mind. Then Aunt Julia,\nand the curate, and Minnie were standing on the rock within a few\npaces of them, but on the other side of the stream.\n\n\"Is there anything the matter?\" asked Miss Lovel.\n\n\"She has sprained her ankle in jumping over the Stryd, and she cannot\nwalk. Perhaps Mr. Cross would not mind going back to the inn and\ngetting a carriage. The road is only a quarter of a mile above us,\nand we could carry her up.\"\n\n\"How could you be so foolish, Frederic, as to let her jump it?\" said\nthe aunt.\n\n\"Don't mind about my folly now. The thing is to get a carriage for\nAnna.\" The curate immediately hurried back, jumping over the Stryd as\nthe nearest way to the inn; and Minnie also sprung across the stream\nso that she might sit down beside her cousin and offer consolation.\nAunt Julia was left alone, and after a while was forced to walk back\nby herself to the bridge.\n\n\"Is she much hurt?\" asked Minnie.\n\n\"I am afraid she is hurt,\" said the lord.\n\n\"Dear, dear Minnie, it does not signify a bit,\" said Anna, lavishing\non her younger cousin the caresses which fate forbade her to give to\nthe elder. \"I know I could walk home in a few minutes. I am better\nnow. It is one of those things which go away almost immediately. I'll\ntry and stand, Frederic, if you'll let me.\" Then she raised herself,\nleaning upon him, and declared that she was nearly well,--and then\nwas reseated, still leaning on him.\n\n\"Shall we attempt to get her up to the road, Minnie, or wait till Mr.\nCross comes to help us?\" Lady Anna declared that she did not want any\nhelp,--certainly not Mr. Cross's help, and that she could do very\nwell, just with Minnie's arm. They waited there sitting on the rocks\nfor half an hour, saying but little to each other, throwing into the\nstream the dry bits of stick which the last flood had left upon the\nstones, and each thinking how pleasant it was to sit there and dream,\nlistening to the running waters. Then Lady Anna hobbled up to the\ncarriage road, helped by a stronger arm than that of her cousin\nMinnie.\n\nOf course there was some concern and dismay at the inn. Embrocations\nwere used, and doctors were talked of, and heads were shaken, and a\ncouch in the sitting-room was prepared, so that the poor injured one\nmight eat her dinner without being driven to the solitude of her own\nbedroom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nFOR EVER.\n\n\nOn the next morning the poor injured one was quite well,--but she\nwas still held to be subject to piteous concern. The two aunts\nshook their heads when she said that she would walk down to the\nstepping-stones that morning, before starting for Yoxham; but she was\nquite sure that the sprain was gone, and the distance was not above\nhalf a mile. They were not to start till two o'clock. Would Minnie\ncome down with her, and ramble about among the ruins?\n\n\"Minnie, come out on the lawn,\" said the lord. \"Don't you come with\nme and Anna;--you can go where you like about the place by yourself.\"\n\n\"Why mayn't I come?\"\n\n\"Never mind, but do as you're bid.\"\n\n\"I know. You are going to make love to cousin Anna.\"\n\n\"You are an impertinent little imp.\"\n\n\"I am so glad, Frederic, because I do like her. I was sure she was a\nreal cousin. Don't you think she is very,--very nice?\"\n\n\"Pretty well.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"You go away and don't tease,--or else I'll never bring you to the\nStryd again.\" So it happened that Lord Lovel and Lady Anna went\nacross the meadow together, down to the river, and sauntered along\nthe margin till they came to the stepping-stones. He passed over, and\nshe followed him, almost without a word. Her heart was so full, that\nshe did not think now of the water running at her feet. It had hardly\nseemed to her to make any difficulty as to the passage. She must\nfollow him whither he would lead her, but her mind misgave her,--that\nthey would not return sweet loving friends as they went out. \"We\nwon't climb,\" said he, \"because it might try your ankle too much. But\nwe will go in here by the meadow. I always think this is one of the\nprettiest views there is,\" he said, throwing himself upon the grass.\n\n\"It is all prettiest. It is like fairy land. Does the Duke let people\ncome here always?\"\n\n\"Yes, I fancy so.\"\n\n\"He must be very good-natured. Do you know the Duke?\"\n\n\"I never saw him in my life.\"\n\n\"A duke sounds so awful to me.\"\n\n\"You'll get used to them some day. Won't you sit down?\" Then she\nglided down to the ground at a little distance from him, and he at\nonce shifted his place so as to be almost close to her. \"Your foot is\nquite well?\"\n\n\"Quite well.\"\n\n\"I thought for a few minutes that there was going to be some dreadful\naccident, and I was so mad with myself for having made you jump it.\nIf you had broken your leg, how would you have borne it?\"\n\n\"Like other people, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Would you have been angry with me?\"\n\n\"I hope not. I am sure not. You were doing the best you could to give\nme pleasure. I don't think I should have been angry at all. I don't\nthink we are ever angry with the people we really like.\"\n\n\"Do you really like me?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I like you.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Is not that enough?\"\n\nShe answered the question as she might have answered it had it been\nallowed to her, as to any girl that was free, to toy with his love,\nknowing that she meant to accept it. It was easier so, than in any\nother way. But her heart within her was sad, and could she have\nstopped his further speech by any word rough and somewhat rude, she\nwould have done so. In truth, she did not know how to answer him\nroughly. He deserved from her that all her words should be soft, and\nsweet and pleasant. She believed him to be good and generous and kind\nand loving. The hard things which Daniel Thwaite had said of him had\nall vanished from her mind. To her thinking, it was no sin in him\nthat he should want her wealth,--he, the Earl, to whom by right the\nwealth of the Lovels should belong. The sin was rather hers,--in that\nshe kept it from him. And then, if she could receive all that he\nwas willing to give, his heart, his name, his house and home, and\nsweet belongings of natural gifts and personal advantages, how much\nmore would she take than what she gave! She could not speak to him\nroughly, though,--alas!--the time had come in which she must speak to\nhim truly. It was not fitting that a girl should have two lovers.\n\n\"No, dear,--not enough,\" he said.\n\nIt can hardly be accounted a fault in him that at this time he felt\nsure of her love. She had been so soft in her ways with him, so\ngracious, yielding, and pretty in her manners, so manifestly pleased\nby his company, so prone to lean upon him, that it could hardly be\nthat he should think otherwise. She had told him, when he spoke to\nher more plainly up in London than he had yet done since they had\nbeen together in the country, that she could never, never be his\nwife. But what else could a girl say at a first meeting with a\nproposed lover? Would he have wished that she should at once have\ngiven herself up without one maidenly scruple, one word of feminine\nrecusancy? If love's course be made to run too smooth it loses all\nits poetry, and half its sweetness. But now they knew each other;--at\nleast, he thought they did. The scruple might now be put away. The\nfeminine recusancy had done its work. For himself,--he felt that he\nloved her in very truth. She was not harsh or loud,--vulgar, or given\nto coarse manners, as might have been expected, and as he had been\nwarned by his friends that he would find her. That she was very\nbeautiful, all her enemies had acknowledged,--and he was quite\nassured that her enemies had been right. She was the Lady Anna Lovel,\nand he felt that he could make her his own without one shade of\nregret to mar his triumph. Of the tailor's son,--though he had been\nwarned of him too,--he made no account whatever. That had been a\nslander, which only endeared the girl to him the more;--a slander\nagainst Lady Anna Lovel which had been an insult to his family. Among\nall the ladies he knew, daughters of peers and high-bred commoners,\nthere were none,--there was not one less likely so to disgrace\nherself than Lady Anna Lovel, his sweet cousin.\n\n\"Do not think me too hurried, dear, if I speak to you again so soon,\nof that of which I spoke once before.\" He had turned himself round\nupon his arm, so as to be very close to her,--so that he would look\nfull into her face, and, if chance favoured him, could take her hand.\nHe paused, as though for an answer; but she did not speak to him a\nword. \"It is not long yet since we first met.\"\n\n\"Oh, no;--not long.\"\n\n\"And I know not what your feelings are. But, in very truth, I can say\nthat I love you dearly. Had nothing else come in the way to bring us\ntogether, I am sure that I should have loved you.\" She, poor child,\nbelieved him as though he were speaking to her the sweetest gospel.\nAnd he, too, believed himself. He was easy of heart perhaps, but not\ndeceitful; anxious enough for his position in the world, but not\nmeanly covetous. Had she been distasteful to him as a woman, he\nwould have refused to make himself rich by the means that had been\nsuggested to him. As it was, he desired her as much as her money, and\nhad she given herself to him then would never have remembered,--would\nnever have known that the match had been sordid. \"Do you believe me?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"And shall it be so?\"\n\nHer face had been turned away, but now she slowly moved her neck so\nthat she could look at him. Should she be false to all her vows, and\ntry whether happiness might not be gained in that way? The manner\nof doing it passed through her mind in that moment. She would write\nto Daniel, and remind him of his promise to set her free if she so\nwilled it. She would never see him again. She would tell him that\nshe had striven to see things as he would have taught her, and had\nfailed. She would abuse herself, and ask for his pardon;--but having\nthus judged for herself, she would never go back from such judgment.\nIt might be done,--if only she could persuade herself that it were\ngood to do it! But, as she thought of it, there came upon her a prick\nof conscience so sharp, that she could not welcome the devil by\nleaving it unheeded. How could she be foresworn to one who had been\nso absolutely good,--whose all had been spent for her and for her\nmother,--whose whole life had been one long struggle of friendship on\nher behalf,--who had been the only playfellow of her youth, the only\nman she had ever ventured to kiss,--the man whom she truly loved? He\nhad warned her against these gauds which were captivating her spirit,\nand now, in the moment of her peril, she would remember his warnings.\n\n\"Shall it be so?\" Lord Lovel asked again, just stretching out his\nhand, so that he could touch the fold of her garment.\n\n\"It cannot be so,\" she said.\n\n\"Cannot be!\"\n\n\"It cannot be so, Lord Lovel.\"\n\n\"It cannot now;--or do you mean the word to be for ever?\"\n\n\"For ever!\" she replied.\n\n\"I know that I have been hurried and sudden,\" he said,--purposely\npassing by her last assurance; \"and I do feel that you have a right\nto resent the seeming assurance of such haste. But in our case,\ndearest, the interests of so many are concerned, the doubts and\nfears, the well-being, and even the future conduct of all our friends\nare so bound up by the result, that I had hoped you would have\npardoned that which would otherwise have been unpardonable.\" Oh\nheavens;--had it not been for Daniel Thwaite, how full of grace, how\nbecoming, how laden with flattering courtesy would have been every\nword that he had uttered to her! \"But,\" he continued, \"if it really\nbe that you cannot love me--\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord Lovel, pray ask of me no further question.\"\n\n\"I am bound to ask and to know,--for all our sakes.\"\n\nThen she rose quickly to her feet, and with altered gait and changed\ncountenance stood over him. \"I am engaged,\" she said, \"to be\nmarried--to Mr. Daniel Thwaite.\" She had told it all, and felt that\nshe had told her own disgrace. He rose also, but stood mute before\nher. This was the very thing of which they had all warned him, but as\nto which he had been so sure that it was not so! She saw it all in\nhis eyes, reading much more there than he could read in hers. She was\ndegraded in his estimation, and felt that evil worse almost than the\nloss of his love. For the last three weeks she had been a real Lovel\namong the Lovels. That was all over now. Let this lawsuit go as it\nmight, let them give to her all the money, and make the title which\nshe hated ever so sure, she never again could be the equal friend\nof her gentle relative, Earl Lovel. Minnie would never again spring\ninto her arms, swearing that she would do as she pleased with her\nown cousin. She might be Lady Anna, but never Anna again to the two\nladies at the rectory. The perfume of his rank had been just scented,\nto be dashed away from her for ever. \"It is a secret at present,\"\nshe said, \"or I should have told you sooner. If it is right that you\nshould repeat it, of course you must.\"\n\n\"Oh, Anna!\"\n\n\"It is true.\"\n\n\"Oh, Anna, for your sake as well as mine this makes me wretched\nindeed!\"\n\n\"As for the money, Lord Lovel, if it be mine to give, you shall have\nit.\"\n\n\"You think then it is that which I have wanted?\"\n\n\"It is that which the family wants, and I can understand that it\nshould be wanted. As for myself,--for mamma and me,--you can hardly\nunderstand how it has been with us when we were young. You despise\nMr. Thwaite,--because he is a tailor.\"\n\n\"I am sure he is not fit to be the husband of Lady Anna Lovel.\"\n\n\"When Lady Anna Lovel had no other friend in the world, he sheltered\nher and gave her a house to live in, and spent his earnings in her\ndefence, and would not yield when all those who might have been\nher friends strove to wrong her. Where would mamma have been,--and\nI,--had there been no Mr. Thwaite to comfort us? He was our only\nfriend,--he and his father. They were all we had. In my childhood I\nhad never a kind word from another child,--but only from him. Would\nit have been right that he should have asked for anything, and that\nI should have refused it?\"\n\n\"He should not have asked for this,\" said Lord Lovel hoarsely.\n\n\"Why not he, as well as you? He is as much a man. If I could believe\nin your love after two days, Lord Lovel, could I not trust his after\ntwenty years of friendship?\"\n\n\"You knew that he was beneath you.\"\n\n\"He was not beneath me. He was above me. We were poor,--while he\nand his father had money, which we took. He could give, while we\nreceived. He was strong while we were weak,--and was strong to\ncomfort us. And then, Lord Lovel, what knew I of rank, living under\nhis father's wing? They told me I was the Lady Anna, and the children\nscouted me. My mother was a countess. So she swore, and I at least\nbelieved her. But if ever rank and title were a profitless burden,\nthey were to her. Do you think that I had learned then to love my\nrank?\"\n\n\"You have learned better now.\"\n\n\"I have learned,--but whether better I may doubt. There are lessons\nwhich are quickly learned; and there are they who say that such are\nthe devil's lessons. I have not been strong enough not to learn. But\nI must forget again, Lord Lovel. And you must forget also.\" He hardly\nknew how to speak to her now;--whether it would be fit for him even\nto wish to persuade her to be his, after she had told him that she\nhad given her troth to a tailor. His uneasy thoughts prompted him\nwith ideas which dismayed him. Could he take to his heart one who had\nbeen pressed close in so vile a grasp? Could he accept a heart that\nhad once been promised to a tailor's workman? Would not all the world\nknow and say that he had done it solely for the money,--even should\nhe succeed in doing it? And yet to fail in this enterprise,--to\nabandon all,--to give up so enticing a road to wealth! Then he\nremembered what he had said,--how he had pledged himself to abandon\nthe lawsuit,--how convinced he had been that this girl was heiress to\nthe Lovel wealth, who now told him that she had engaged herself to\nmarry a tailor.\n\nThere was nothing more that either of them could say to the other at\nthe moment, and they went back in silence to the inn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nTHE JOURNEY HOME.\n\n\nIn absolute silence Lord Lovel and Lady Anna walked back to the inn.\nHe had been dumbfoundered,--nearly so by her first abrupt statement,\nand then altogether by the arguments with which she had defended\nherself. She had nothing further to say. She had, indeed, said all,\nand had marvelled at her own eloquence while she was speaking. Nor\nwas there absent from her a certain pride in that she had done the\nthing that was right, and had dared to defend herself. She was full\nof regrets,--almost of remorse; but, nevertheless, she was proud. He\nknew it all now, and one of her great difficulties had been overcome.\n\nAnd she was fully resolved that as she had dared to tell him, and\nto face his anger, his reproaches, his scorn, she would not falter\nbefore the scorn and the reproaches, or the anger, of the other\nLovels,--of any of the Lovels of Yoxham. Her mother's reproaches\nwould be dreadful to her; her mother's anger would well-nigh kill\nher; her mother's scorn would scorch her very soul. But sufficient\nfor the day was the evil thereof. At the present moment she could be\nstrong with the strength she had assumed. So she walked in at the\nsitting-room window with a bold front, and the Earl followed her. The\ntwo aunts were there, and it was plain to them both that something\nwas astray between the lovers. They had said among themselves that\nLady Anna would accept the offer the moment that it was in form\nmade to her. To their eyes the manner of their guest had been the\nmanner of a girl eager to be wooed; but they had both imagined that\ntheir delicately nurtured and fastidious nephew might too probably\nbe offended by some solecism in conduct, some falling away from\nfeminine grace, such as might too readily be shown by one whose early\nlife had been subjected to rough associates. Even now it occurred to\neach of them that it had been so. The Earl seated himself in a chair,\nand took up a book, which they had brought with them. Lady Anna stood\nat the open window, looking across at the broad field and the river\nbank beyond; but neither of them spoke a word. There had certainly\nbeen some quarrel. Then aunt Julia, in the cause of wisdom, asked a\nquestion;--\n\n\"Where is Minnie? Did not Minnie go with you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Earl. \"She went in some other direction at my bidding.\nMr. Cross is with her, I suppose.\" It was evident from the tone of\nhis voice that the displeasure of the head of all the Lovels was very\ngreat.\n\n\"We start soon, I suppose?\" said Lady Anna.\n\n\"After lunch, my dear; it is hardly one yet.\"\n\n\"I will go up all the same, and see about my things.\"\n\n\"Shall I help you, my dear?\" asked Mrs. Lovel.\n\n\"Oh, no! I would sooner do it alone.\" Then she hurried into her room\nand burst into a flood of tears, as soon as the door was closed\nbehind her.\n\n\"Frederic, what ails her?\" asked aunt Julia.\n\n\"If anything ails her she must tell you herself,\" said the lord.\n\n\"Something is amiss. You cannot wonder that we should be anxious,\nknowing that we know how great is the importance of all this.\"\n\n\"I cannot help your anxiety just at present, aunt Julia; but you\nshould always remember that there will be slips between the cup and\nthe lip.\"\n\n\"Then there has been a slip? I knew it would be so. I always said so,\nand so did my brother.\"\n\n\"I wish you would all remember that about such an affair as this, the\nless said the better.\" So saying, the lord walked out through the\nwindow and sauntered down to the river side.\n\n\"It's all over,\" said aunt Julia.\n\n\"I don't see why we should suppose that at present,\" said aunt Jane.\n\n\"It's all over. I knew it as soon as I saw her face when she came in.\nShe has said something, or done something, and it's all off. It will\nbe a matter of over twenty thousand pounds a year!\"\n\n\"He'll be sure to marry somebody with money,\" said aunt Jane. \"What\nwith his title and his being so handsome, he is certain to do well,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Nothing like that will come in his way. I heard Mr. Flick say that\nit was equal to half a million of money. And then it would have been\nat once. If he goes up to London, and about, just as he is, he'll\nbe head over ears in debt before anybody knows what he is doing. I\nwonder what it is. He likes pretty girls, and there's no denying that\nshe's handsome.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she wouldn't have him.\"\n\n\"That's impossible, Jane. She came down here on purpose to have him.\nShe went out with him this morning to be made love to. They were\ntogether three times longer yesterday, and he came home as sweet\nas sugar to her. I wonder whether she can have wanted to make some\ncondition about the money.\"\n\n\"What condition?\"\n\n\"That she and her mother should have it in their own keeping.\"\n\n\"She doesn't seem to be that sort of a young woman,\" said aunt Jane.\n\n\"There's no knowing what that Mr. Goffe, Serjeant Bluestone, and her\nmother may have put her up to. Frederic wouldn't stand that kind of\nthing for a minute, and he would be quite right. Better anything than\nthat a man shouldn't be his own master. I think you'd better go up to\nher, Jane. She'll be more comfortable with you than with me.\" Then\naunt Jane, obedient as usual, went up to her young cousin's bedroom.\n\nIn the meantime the young lord was standing on the river's brink,\nthinking what he would do. He had, in truth, very much of which\nto think, and points of most vital importance as to which he must\nresolve what should be his action. Must this announcement which he\nhad heard from his cousin dissolve for ever the prospect of his\nmarriage with her; or was it open to him still, as a nobleman, a\ngentleman, and a man of honour, to make use of all those influences\nwhich he might command with the view of getting rid of that\nimpediment of a previous engagement? Being very ignorant of the world\nat large, and altogether ignorant of this man in particular, he did\nnot doubt that the tailor might be bought off. Then he was sure that\nall who would have access to Lady Anna would help him in such a\ncause, and that her own mother would be the most forward to do so.\nThe girl would hardly hold to such a purpose if all the world,--all\nher own world, were against her. She certainly would be beaten from\nit if a bribe sufficient were offered to the tailor. That this must\nbe done for the sake of the Lovel family, so that Lady Anna Lovel\nmight not be known to have married a tailor, was beyond a doubt;\nbut it was not so clear to him that he could take to himself as his\nCountess her who with her own lips had told him that she intended\nto be the bride of a working artisan. As he thought of this, as his\nimagination went to work on all the abominable circumstances of such\na betrothal, he threw from his hand into the stream with all the\nvehemence of passion a little twig which he held. It was too, too\nfrightful, too disgusting; and then so absolutely unexpected, so\nunlike her personal demeanour, so contrary to the look of her eyes,\nto the tone of her voice, to every motion of her body! She had been\nsweet, and gentle, and gracious, till he had almost come to think\nthat her natural feminine gifts of ladyship were more even than\nher wealth, of better savour than her rank, were equal even to her\nbeauty, which he had sworn to himself during the past night to be\nunsurpassed. And this sweet one had told him,--this one so soft and\ngracious,--not that she was doomed by some hard fate to undergo the\ndegrading thraldom, but that she herself had willingly given herself\nto a working tailor from love, and gratitude, and free selection! It\nwas a marvel to him that a thing so delicate should have so little\nsense of her own delicacy! He did not think that he could condescend\nto take the tailor's place.\n\nBut if not,--if he would not take it, or if, as might still be\npossible, the tailor's place could not be made vacant for him,--what\nthen? He had pledged his belief in the justice of his cousin's\nclaim; and had told her that, believing his own claim to be\nunjust, in no case would he prosecute it. Was he now bound by that\nassurance,--bound to it even to the making of the tailor's fortune;\nor might he absent himself from any further action in the matter,\nleaving it entirely in the hands of the lawyers? Might it not be best\nfor her happiness that he should do so? He had been told that even\nthough he should not succeed, there might arise almost interminable\ndelay. The tailor would want his money before he married, and thus\nshe might be rescued from her degradation till she should be old\nenough to understand it. And yet how could he claim that of which he\nhad said, now a score of times, that he knew that it was not his own?\nCould he cease to call this girl by the name which all his people had\nacknowledged as her own, because she had refused to be his wife; and\ndeclare his conviction that she was base-born only because she had\npreferred to his own the addresses of a low-born man, reeking with\nthe sweat of a tailor's board? No, he could not do that. Let her\nmarry but the sweeper of a crossing, and he must still call her Lady\nAnna,--if he called her anything.\n\nSomething must be done, however. He had been told by the lawyers how\nthe matter might be made to right itself, if he and the young lady\ncould at once agree to be man and wife; but he had not been told what\nwould follow, should she decline to accept his offer. Mr. Flick and\nthe Solicitor-General must know how to shape their course before\nNovember came round,--and would no doubt want all the time to shape\nit that he could give them. What was he to say to Mr. Flick and to\nthe Solicitor-General? Was he at liberty to tell to them the secret\nwhich the girl had told to him? That he was at liberty to say that\nshe had rejected his offer must be a matter of course; but might\nhe go beyond that, and tell them the whole story? It would be most\nexpedient for many reasons that they should know it. On her behalf\neven it might be most salutary,--with that view of liberating her\nfrom the grasp of her humiliating lover. But she had told it him,\nagainst her own interests, at her own peril, to her own infinite\nsorrow,--in order that she might thus allay hopes in which he would\notherwise have persevered. He knew enough of the little schemes and\nby-ways of love, of the generosity and self-sacrifice of lovers, to\nfeel that he was bound to confidence. She had told him that if needs\nwere he might repeat her tale;--but she had told him at the same time\nthat her tale was a secret. He could not go with her secret to a\nlawyer's chambers, and there divulge in the course of business that\nwhich had been extracted from her by the necessity to which she had\nsubmitted of setting him free. He could write to Mr. Flick,--if that\nat last was his resolve,--that a marriage was altogether out of the\nquestion, but he could not tell him why it was so.\n\nHe wandered slowly on along the river, having decided only on\nthis,--only on this as a certainty,--that he must tell her secret\nneither to the lawyers, nor to his own people. Then, as he walked, a\nlittle hand touched his behind, and when he turned Minnie Lovel took\nhim by the arm. \"Why are you all alone, Fred?\"\n\n\"I am meditating how wicked the world is,--and girls in particular.\"\n\n\"Where is cousin Anna?\"\n\n\"Up at the house, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Is she wicked?\"\n\n\"Don't you know that everybody is wicked, because Eve ate the apple?\"\n\n\"Adam ate it too.\"\n\n\"Who bade him?\"\n\n\"The devil,\" said the child whispering.\n\n\"But he spoke by a woman's mouth. Why don't you go in and get ready\nto go?\"\n\n\"So I will. Tell me one thing, Fred. May I be a bridesmaid when you\nare married?\"\n\n\"I don't think you can.\"\n\n\"I have set my heart upon it. Why not?\"\n\n\"Because you'll be married first.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Fred; and you know it's nonsense. Isn't cousin Anna\nto be your wife?\"\n\n\"Look here, my darling. I'm awfully fond of you, and think you the\nprettiest little girl in the world. But if you ask impertinent\nquestions I'll never speak to you again. Do you understand?\" She\nlooked up into his face, and did understand that he was in earnest,\nand, leaving him, walked slowly across the meadow back to the house\nalone. \"Tell them not to wait lunch for me,\" he hollowed after\nher;--and she told her aunt Julia that cousin Frederic was very sulky\ndown by the river, and that they were not to wait for him.\n\nWhen Mrs. Lovel went up-stairs into Lady Anna's room not a word was\nsaid about the occurrence of the morning. The elder lady was afraid\nto ask a question, and the younger was fully determined to tell\nnothing even had a question been asked her. Lord Lovel might say\nwhat he pleased. Her secret was with him, and he could tell it if he\nchose. She had given him permission to do so, of which no doubt he\nwould avail himself. But, on her own account, she would say nothing;\nand when questioned she would merely admit the fact. She would\nneither defend her engagement, nor would she submit to have it\ncensured. If they pleased she would return to her mother in London at\nany shortest possible notice.\n\nThe party lunched almost in silence, and when the horses were ready\nLord Lovel came in to help them into the carriage. When he had placed\nthe three ladies he desired Minnie to take the fourth seat, saying\nthat he would sit with Mr. Cross on the box. Minnie looked at his\nface, but there was still the frown there, and she obeyed him without\nany remonstrance. During the whole of the long journey home there was\nhardly a word spoken. Lady Anna knew that she was in disgrace, and\nwas ignorant how much of her story had been told to the two elder\nladies. She sat almost motionless looking out upon the fields, and\naccepting her position as one that was no longer thought worthy of\nnotice. Of course she must go back to London. She could not continue\nto live at Yoxham, neither spoken to nor speaking. Minnie went to\nsleep, and Minnie's mother and aunt now and then addressed a few\nwords to each other. Anna felt sure that to the latest day of her\nexistence she would remember that journey. On their arrival at the\nRectory door Mr. Cross helped the ladies out of the carriage, while\nthe lord affected to make himself busy with the shawls and luggage.\nThen he vanished, and was seen no more till he appeared at dinner.\n\n\"What sort of a trip have you had?\" asked the rector, addressing\nhimself to the three ladies indifferently.\n\nFor a moment nobody answered him, and then aunt Julia spoke. \"It\nwas very pretty, as it always is at Bolton in summer. We were told\nthat the duke has not been there this year at all. The inn was\ncomfortable, and I think that the young people enjoyed themselves\nyesterday very much.\" The subject was too important, too solemn, too\ngreat, to allow of even a word to be said about it without proper\nconsideration.\n\n\"Did Frederic like it?\"\n\n\"I think he did yesterday,\" said Mrs. Lovel. \"I think we were all a\nlittle tired coming home to-day.\"\n\n\"Anna sprained her ankle, jumping over the Stryd,\" said Minnie.\n\n\"Not seriously, I hope.\"\n\n\"Oh dear no;--nothing at all to signify.\" It was the only word which\nAnna spoke till it was suggested that she should go up to her room.\nThe girl obeyed, as a child might have done, and went up-stairs,\nfollowed by Mrs. Lovel. \"My dear,\" she said, \"we cannot go on like\nthis. What is the matter?\"\n\n\"You must ask Lord Lovel.\"\n\n\"Have you quarrelled with him?\"\n\n\"I have not quarrelled, Mrs. Lovel. If he has quarrelled with me, I\ncannot help it.\"\n\n\"You know what we have all wished.\"\n\n\"It can never be so.\"\n\n\"Have you said so to Frederic?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"Have you given him any reason, Anna?\"\n\n\"I have,\" she said after a pause.\n\n\"What reason, dear?\"\n\nShe thought for a moment before she replied. \"I was obliged to tell\nhim the reason, Mrs. Lovel; but I don't think that I need tell\nanybody else. Of course I must tell mamma.\"\n\n\"Does your mamma know it?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"And is it a reason that must last for ever?\"\n\n\"Yes;--for ever. But I do not know why everybody is to be angry with\nme. Other girls may do as they please. If you are angry with me I had\nbetter go back to London at once.\"\n\n\"I do not know that anybody has been angry with you. We may be\ndisappointed without being angry.\" That was all that was said, and\nthen Lady Anna was left to dress for dinner. At dinner Lord Lovel had\nso far composed himself as to be able to speak to his cousin, and an\neffort at courtesy was made by them all,--except by the rector. But\nthe evening passed away in a manner very different from any that had\ngone before it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTOO HEAVY FOR SECRETS.\n\n\nDuring that night the young lord was still thinking of his future\nconduct,--of what duty and honour demanded of him, and of the\nmanner in which he might best make duty and honour consort with his\ninterests. In all the emergencies of his short life he had hitherto\nhad some one to advise him,--some elder friend whose counsel he might\ntake even though he would seem to make little use of it when it\nwas offered to him. He had always somewhat disdained aunt Julia,\nbut nevertheless aunt Julia had been very useful to him. In latter\ndays, since the late Earl's death, when there came upon him, as the\nfirst of his troubles, the necessity of setting aside that madman's\nwill, Mr. Flick had been his chief counsellor; and yet in all his\ncommunications with Mr. Flick he had assumed to be his own guide and\nmaster. Now it seemed that he must in truth guide himself, but he\nknew not how to do it. Of one thing he felt certain. He must get away\nfrom Yoxham and hurry up to London.\n\nIt behoved him to keep his cousin's secret; but would he not be\nkeeping it with a sanctity sufficiently strict if he imparted it to\none sworn friend,--a friend who should be bound not to divulge it\nfurther without his consent? If so, the Solicitor-General should be\nhis friend. An intimacy had grown up between the great lawyer and his\nnoble client, not social in its nature, but still sufficiently close,\nas Lord Lovel thought, to admit of such confidence. He had begun to\nbe aware that without assistance of this nature he would not know\nhow to guide himself. Undoubtedly the wealth of the presumed heiress\nhad become dearer to him,--had become at least more important to\nhim,--since he had learned that it must probably be lost. Sir\nWilliam Patterson was a gentleman as well as a lawyer;--one who had\nnot simply risen to legal rank by diligence and intellect, but a\ngentleman born and bred, who had been at a public school, and had\nlived all his days with people of the right sort. Sir William was his\nlegal adviser, and he would commit Lady Anna's secret to the keeping\nof Sir William.\n\nThere was a coach which started in those days from York at noon,\nreaching London early on the following day. He would go up by this\ncoach, and would thus avoid the necessity of much further association\nwith his family before he had decided what should be his conduct. But\nhe must see his cousin before he went. He therefore sent a note to\nher before she had left her room on the following morning;--\n\n\n   DEAR ANNA,\n\n   I purpose starting for London in an hour or so, and wish\n   to say one word to you before I go. Will you meet me at\n   nine in the drawing-room? Do not mention my going to my\n   uncle or aunts, as it will be better that I should tell\n   them myself.\n\n   Yours, L.\n\n\nAt ten minutes before nine Lady Anna was in the drawing-room waiting\nfor him, and at ten minutes past nine he joined her.\n\n\"I beg your pardon for keeping you waiting.\" She gave him her hand,\nand said that it did not signify in the least. She was always early.\n\"I find that I must go up to London at once,\" he said. To this she\nmade no answer, though he seemed to expect some reply. \"In the first\nplace, I could not remain here in comfort after what you told me\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"I shall be sorry to drive you away. It is your home; and as I must\ngo soon, had I not better go at once?\"\n\n\"No;--that is, I think not. I shall go at any rate. I have told none\nof them what you told me yesterday.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that, Lord Lovel.\"\n\n\"It is for you to tell it,--if it must be told.\"\n\n\"I did tell your aunt Jane,--that you and I never can be as--you said\nyou wished.\"\n\n\"I did wish it most heartily. You did not tell it--all.\"\n\n\"No;--not all.\"\n\n\"You astounded me so, that I could hardly speak to you as I should\nhave spoken. I did not mean to be uncourteous.\"\n\n\"I did not think you uncourteous, Lord Lovel. I am sure you would not\nbe uncourteous to me.\"\n\n\"But you astounded me. It is not that I think much of myself, or of\nmy rank as belonging to me. I know that I have but little to be proud\nof. I am very poor,--and not clever like some young men who have not\nlarge fortunes, but who can become statesmen and all that. But I do\nthink much of my order; I think much of being a gentleman,--and much\nof ladies being ladies. Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--I understand you.\"\n\n\"If you are Lady Anna Lovel--\"\n\n\"I am Lady Anna Lovel.\"\n\n\"I believe you are with all my heart. You speak like it, and look\nlike it. You are fit for any position. Everything is in your favour.\nI do believe it. But if so--\"\n\n\"Well, Lord Lovel;--if so?\"\n\n\"Surely you would not choose to--to--to degrade your rank. That is\nthe truth. If I be your cousin, and the head of your family, I have a\nright to speak as such. What you told me would be degradation.\"\n\nShe thought a moment, and then she replied to him,--\"It would be no\ndisgrace.\"\n\nHe too found himself compelled to think before he could speak again.\n\"Do you think that you could like your associates if you were to be\nmarried to Mr. Thwaite?\"\n\n\"I do not know who they would be. He would be my companion, and I\nlike him. I love him dearly. There! you need not tell me, Lord Lovel.\nI know it all. He is not like you;--and I, when I had become his\nwife, should not be like your aunt Jane. I should never see people\nof that sort any more, I suppose. We should not live here in England\nat all,--so that I should escape the scorn of all my cousins. I know\nwhat I am doing, and why I am doing it;--and I do not think you ought\nto tempt me.\"\n\nShe knew at least that she was open to temptation. He could perceive\nthat, and was thankful for it. \"I do not wish to tempt you, but I\nwould save you from unhappiness if I could. Such a marriage would be\nunnatural. I have not seen Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"Then, my lord, you have not seen a most excellent man, who, next to\nmy mother, is my best friend.\"\n\n\"But he cannot be a gentleman.\"\n\n\"I do not know;--but I do know that I can be his wife. Is that all,\nLord Lovel?\"\n\n\"Not quite all. I fear that this weary lawsuit will come back upon us\nin some shape. I cannot say whether I have the power to stop it if I\nwould. I must in part be guided by others.\"\n\n\"I cannot do anything. If I could, I would not even ask for the money\nfor myself.\"\n\n\"No, Lady Anna. You and I cannot decide it. I must again see my\nlawyer. I do not mean the attorney,--but Sir William Patterson, the\nSolicitor-General. May I tell him what you told me yesterday?\"\n\n\"I cannot hinder you.\"\n\n\"But you can give me your permission. If he will promise me that it\nshall go no farther,--then may I tell him? I shall hardly know what\nto do unless he knows all that I know.\"\n\n\"Everybody will know soon.\"\n\n\"Nobody shall know from me,--but only he. Will you say that I may\ntell him?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"I am much indebted to you even for that. I cannot tell you now how\nmuch I hoped when I got up yesterday morning at Bolton Bridge that I\nshould have to be indebted to you for making me the happiest man in\nEngland. You must forgive me if I say that I still hope at heart that\nthis infatuation may be made to cease. And now, good-bye, Lady Anna.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Lord Lovel.\"\n\nShe at once went to her room, and sent down her maid to say that she\nwould not appear at prayers or at breakfast. She would not see him\nagain before he went. How probable it was that her eyes had rested on\nhis form for the last time! How beautiful he was, how full of grace,\nhow like a god! How pleasant she had found it to be near him; how\nfull of ineffable sweetness had been everything that he had touched,\nall things of which he had spoken to her! He had almost overcome her,\nas though she had eaten of the lotus. And she knew not whether the\ncharm was of God or devil. But she did know that she had struggled\nagainst it,--because of her word, and because she owed a debt which\nfalsehood and ingratitude would ill repay. Lord Lovel had called her\nLady Anna now. Ah, yes; how good he was! When it became significant\nto her that he should recognise her rank, he did so at once. He had\nonly dropped the title when, having been recognised, it had become\na stumbling-block to her. Now he was gone from her, and, if it was\npossible, she would cease even to dream of him.\n\n\"I suppose, Frederic, that the marriage is not to be?\" the rector\nsaid to him as he got into the dog-cart at the rectory door.\n\n\"I cannot tell. I do not know. I think not. But, uncle, would you\noblige me by not speaking of it just at present? You will know all\nvery soon.\"\n\nThe rector stood on the gravel, watching the dog-cart as it\ndisappeared, with his hands in the pockets of his clerical trousers,\nand with heavy signs of displeasure on his face. It was very well to\nbe uncle to an earl, and out of his wealth to do what he could to\nassist, and, if possible, to dispel his noble nephew's poverty. But\nsurely something was due to him! It was not for his pleasure that\nthis girl,--whom he was forced to call Lady Anna, though he could\nnever believe her to be so, whom his wife and sister called cousin\nAnna, though he still thought that she was not, and could not be,\ncousin to anybody,--it was not for anything that he could get, that\nhe was entertaining her as an honoured guest at his rectory. And now\nhis nephew was gone, and the girl was left behind. And he was not to\nbe told whether there was to be a marriage or not! \"I cannot tell. I\ndo not know. I think not.\" And then he was curtly requested to ask no\nmore questions. What was he to do with the girl? While the young Earl\nand the lawyers were still pondering the question of her legitimacy,\nthe girl, whether a Lady Anna and a cousin,--or a mere nobody, who\nwas trying to rob the family,--was to be left on his hands! Why,--oh,\nwhy had he allowed himself to be talked out of his own opinion? Why\nhad he ever permitted her to be invited to his rectory? Ah, how the\ntitle stuck in his throat as he asked her to take the customary glass\nof wine with him at dinner-time that evening!\n\nOn reaching London, towards the end of August, Lord Lovel found that\nthe Solicitor-General was out of town. Sir William had gone down to\nSomersetshire with the intention of saying some comforting words to\nhis constituents. Mr. Flick knew nothing of his movements; but his\nclerk was found, and his clerk did not expect him back in London till\nOctober. But, in answer to Lord Lovel's letter, Sir William undertook\nto come up for one day. Sir William was a man who quite recognised\nthe importance of the case he had in hand.\n\n\"Engaged to the tailor,--is she?\" he said; not, however, with any\nlook of surprise.\n\n\"But, Sir William,--you will not repeat this, even to Mr. Flick, or\nto Mr. Hardy. I have promised Lady Anna that it shall not go beyond\nyou.\"\n\n\"If she sticks to her bargain, it cannot be kept secret very\nlong;--nor would she wish it. It's just what we might have expected,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't say so if you knew her.\"\n\n\"H--m. I'm older than you, Lord Lovel. You see, she had nobody else\nnear her. A girl must cotton to somebody, and who was there? We ought\nnot to be angry with her.\"\n\n\"But it shocks me so.\"\n\n\"Well, yes. As far as I can learn his father and he have stood by\nthem very closely;--and did so, too, when there seemed to be but\nlittle hope. But they might be paid for all they did at a less rate\nthan that. If she sticks to him nobody can beat him out of it. What\nI mean is, that it was all fair game. He ran his chance, and did it\nin a manly fashion.\" The Earl did not quite understand Sir William,\nwho seemed to take almost a favourable view of these monstrous\nbetrothals. \"What I mean is, that nobody can touch him, or find fault\nwith him. He has not carried her away, and got up a marriage before\nshe was of age. He hasn't kept her from going out among her friends.\nHe hasn't--wronged her, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I think he has wronged her frightfully.\"\n\n\"Ah,--well. We mean different things. I am obliged to look at it as\nthe world will look at it.\"\n\n\"Think of the disgrace of such a marriage;--to a tailor.\"\n\n\"Whose father had advanced her mother some five or six thousand\npounds to help her to win back her position. That's about the truth\nof it. We must look at it all round, you know.\"\n\n\"You think, then, that nothing should be done?\"\n\n\"I think that everything should be done that can be done. We have\nthe mother on our side. Very probably we may have old Thwaite on\nour side. From what you say, it is quite possible that at this very\nmoment the girl herself may be on our side. Let her remain at Yoxham\nas long as you can get her to stay, and let everything be done to\nflatter and amuse her. Go down again yourself, and play the lover as\nwell as I do not doubt you know how to do it.\" It was clear then that\nthe great legal pundit did not think that an Earl should be ashamed\nto carry on his suit to a lady who had confessed her attachment to\na journeyman tailor. \"It will be a trouble to us all, of course,\nbecause we must change our plan when the case comes on in November.\"\n\n\"But you still think that she is the heiress?\"\n\n\"So strongly, that I feel all but sure of it. We shouldn't, in truth,\nhave had a leg to stand on, and we couldn't fight it. I may as well\ntell you at once, my lord, that we couldn't do it with any chance\nof success. And what should we have gained had we done so? Nothing!\nUnless we could prove that the real wife were dead, we should have\nbeen fighting for that Italian woman, whom I most thoroughly believe\nto be an impostor.\"\n\n\"Then there is nothing to be done?\"\n\n\"Very little in that way. But if the young lady be determined to\nmarry the tailor, I think we should simply give notice that we\nwithdraw our opposition to the English ladies, and state that we had\nso informed the woman who asserts her own claim and calls herself a\nCountess in Sicily; and we should let the Italian woman know that we\nhad done so. In such case, for aught anybody can say here, she might\ncome forward with her own case. She would find men here who would\ntake it up on speculation readily enough. There would be a variety\nof complications, and no doubt very great delay. In such an event\nwe should question very closely the nature of the property; as, for\naught I have seen as yet, a portion of it might revert to you as real\nestate. It is very various,--and it is not always easy to declare\nat once what is real and what personal. Hitherto you have appeared\nas contesting the right of the English widow to her rank, and not\nnecessarily as a claimant of the estate. The Italian widow, if a\nwidow, would be the heir, and not your lordship. For that, among\nother reasons, the marriage would be most expedient. If the Italian\nCountess were to succeed in proving that the Earl had a wife living\nwhen he married Miss Murray,--which I feel sure he had not,--then we\nshould come forward again with our endeavours to show that that first\nwife had died since,--as the Earl himself undoubtedly declared more\nthan once. It would be a long time before the tailor got his money\nwith his wife. The feeling of the court would be against him.\"\n\n\"Could we buy the tailor, Sir William?\"\n\nThe Solicitor-General nursed his leg before he answered.\n\n\"Mr. Flick could answer that question better than I can do. In fact,\nMr. Flick should know it all. The matter is too heavy for secrets,\nLord Lovel.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nLADY ANNA RETURNS TO LONDON.\n\n\nAfter the Earl was gone Lady Anna had but a bad time of it at Yoxham.\nShe herself could not so far regain her composure as to live on\nas though no disruption had taken place. She knew that she was in\ndisgrace, and the feeling was dreadful to her. The two ladies were\ncivil, and tried to make the house pleasant, but they were not\ncordial as they had been hitherto. For one happy halcyon week,--for a\nday or two before the Earl had come, and for those bright days during\nwhich he had been with them,--she had found herself to be really\nadmitted into the inner circle as one of the family. Mrs. Lovel\nhad been altogether gracious with her. Minnie had been her darling\nlittle friend. Aunt Julia had been so far won as to be quite alive to\nthe necessity of winning. The rector himself had never quite given\nway,--had never been so sure of his footing as to feel himself safe\nin abandoning all power of receding; but the effect of this had been\nto put the rector himself, rather than his guest, into the back\nground. The servants had believed in her, and even Mrs. Grimes had\nspoken in her praise,--expressing an opinion that she was almost good\nenough for the young Earl. All Yoxham had known that the two young\npeople were to be married, and all Yoxham had been satisfied. But now\neverything was wrong. The Earl had fled, and all Yoxham knew that\neverything was wrong. It was impossible that her position should be\nas it had been.\n\nThere were consultations behind her back as to what should be done,\nof which,--though she heard no word of them,--she was aware. She went\nout daily in the carriage with Mrs. Lovel, but aunt Julia did not go\nwith them. Aunt Julia on these occasions remained at home discussing\nthe momentous affair with her brother. What should be done? There\nwas a great dinner-party, specially convened to do honour to the\nEarl's return, and not among them a single guest who had not heard\nthat there was to be a marriage. The guests came to see, not only\nthe Earl, but the Earl's bride. When they arrived the Earl had\nflown. Mrs. Lovel expressed her deep sorrow that business of great\nimportance had made it necessary that the Earl should go to London.\nLady Anna was, of course, introduced to the strangers; but it\nwas evident to the merest tyro in such matters, that she was not\nintroduced as would have been a bride expectant. They had heard how\ncharming she was, how all the Lovels had accepted her, how deeply was\nthe Earl in love; and, lo, she sat in the house silent and almost\nunregarded. Of course, the story of the lawsuit, with such variations\nas rumour might give it, was known to them all. A twelvemonth\nago,--nay, at a period less remote than that,--the two female\nclaimants in Cumberland had always been spoken of in those parts as\nwretched, wicked, vulgar impostors. Then came the reaction. Lady Anna\nwas the heiress, and Lady Anna was to be the Countess. It had flown\nabout the country during the last ten days that there was no one like\nthe Lady Anna. Now they came to see her, and another reaction had set\nin. She was the Lady Anna they must suppose. All the Lovels, even the\nrector, so called her. Mrs. Lovel introduced her as Lady Anna Lovel,\nand the rector,--hating himself as he did so,--led her out to dinner\nthough there was a baronet's wife in the room,--the wife of a baronet\nwho dated back from James I. She was the Lady Anna, and therefore\nthe heiress;--but it was clear to them all that there was to be no\nmarriage.\n\n\"Then poor Lord Lovel will absolutely not have enough to starve\nupon,\" said the baronet's wife to the baronet, as soon as the\ncarriage door had been shut upon them.\n\nWhat were they to do with her? The dinner party had taken place on a\nWednesday,--the day after the Earl's departure; and on the Thursday\naunt Julia wrote to her nephew thus:--\n\n\n   Yoxham Rectory, 3rd September.\n\n   MY DEAR FREDERIC,\n\n   My brother wishes me to write to you and say that we are\n   all here very uneasy about Lady Anna. We have only heard\n   from her that the match which was contemplated is not\n   to take place. Whether that be so from unwillingness on\n   her part or yours we have never yet been told;--but both\n   to your aunt Jane and myself she speaks of it as though\n   the decision were irrevocable. What had we better do?\n   Of course, it is our most anxious desire,--as it is our\n   pleasure and our duty,--to arrange everything according\n   to your wishes and welfare. Nothing can be of so much\n   importance to any of us in this world as your position in\n   it. If it is your wish that Lady Anna should remain here,\n   of course she shall remain. But if, in truth, there is no\n   longer any prospect of a marriage, will not her longer\n   sojourn beneath your uncle's roof be a trouble to all of\n   us,--and especially to her?\n\n   Your aunt Jane thinks that it may be only a lover's\n   quarrel. For myself, I feel sure that you would not have\n   left us as you did, had it not been more than that. I\n   think that you owe it to your uncle to write to me,--or to\n   him, if you like it better,--and to give us some clue to\n   the state of things.\n\n   I must not conceal from you the fact that my brother has\n   never felt convinced, as you do, that Lady Anna's mother\n   was, in truth, the Countess Lovel. At your request, and in\n   compliance with the advice of the Solicitor-General, he\n   has been willing to receive her here; and, as she has been\n   here, he has given her the rank which she claims. He took\n   her out to dinner yesterday before Lady Fitzwarren,--which\n   will never be forgiven should it turn out ultimately that\n   the first wife was alive when the Earl married Anna's\n   mother. Of course, while here she must be treated as Lady\n   Anna Lovel; but my brother does not wish to be forced so\n   to do, if it be intended that any further doubt should be\n   raised. In such case he desires to be free to hold his\n   former opinion. Therefore pray write to us, and tell us\n   what you wish to have done. I can assure you that we are\n   at present very uncomfortable.\n\n   Believe me to be,\n   My dear Frederic,\n   Your most affectionate aunt,\n\n   JULIA LOVEL.\n\n\nThe Earl received this before his interview with Sir William, but\nleft it unanswered till after he had seen that gentleman. Then he\nwrote as follows:--\n\n\n   Carlton Club, 5th September, 183--.\n\n   MY DEAR AUNT JULIA,\n\n   Will you tell my uncle that I think you had better get\n   Lady Anna to stay at the rectory as long as possible. I'll\n   let you know all about it very soon. Best love to aunt\n   Jane.\n\n   I am,\n   Your affectionate nephew,\n\n   LOVEL.\n\n\nThis very short epistle was most unsatisfactory to the rector, but\nit was felt by them all that nothing could be done. With such an\ninjunction before them, they could not give the girl a hint that they\nwished her to go. What uncle or what aunt, with such a nephew as Lord\nLovel, so noble and so poor, could turn out an heiress with twenty\nthousand a year, as long as there was the slightest chance of a\nmarriage? Not a doubt would have rankled in their minds had they been\nquite sure that she was the heiress. But, as it was, the Earl ought\nto have said more than he did say.\n\n\"I cannot keep myself from feeling sometimes that Frederic does take\nliberties with me,\" the rector said to his sister. But he submitted.\nIt was a part of the religion of the family,--and no little\npart,--that they should cling to their head and chief. What would the\nworld have been to them if they could not talk with comfortable ease\nand grace of their nephew Frederic?\n\nDuring this time Anna spoke more than once to Mrs. Lovel as to her\ngoing. \"I have been a long time here,\" she said, \"and I'm sure that\nI am in Mr. Lovel's way.\"\n\n\"Not in the least, my dear. If you are happy, pray stay with us.\"\n\nThis was before the arrival of the brief epistle,--when they were\nwaiting to know whether they were to dismiss their guest from Yoxham,\nor to retain her.\n\n\"As for being happy, nobody can be happy, I think, till all this is\nsettled. I will write to mamma, and tell her that I had better return\nto her. Mamma is all alone.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I can advise, my dear; but as far as we are\nconcerned, we shall be very glad if you can stay.\"\n\nThe brief epistle had not then arrived, and they were, in truth,\nanxious that she should go;--but one cannot tell one's visitor to\ndepart from one's house without a downright rupture. Not even the\nrector himself dared to make such rupture, without express sanction\nfrom the Earl.\n\nThen Lady Anna, feeling that she must ask advice, wrote to her\nmother. The Countess had answered her last letter with great\nseverity,--that letter in which the daughter had declared that people\nought not to be asked to marry for money. The Countess, whose whole\nlife had made her stern and unbending, said very hard things to\nher child; had told her that she was ungrateful and disobedient,\nunmindful of her family, neglectful of her duty, and willing to\nsacrifice the prosperity and happiness of all belonging to her, for\nsome girlish feeling of mere romance. The Countess was sure that her\ndaughter would never forgive herself in after years, if she now\nallowed to pass by this golden opportunity of remedying all the evil\nthat her father had done. \"You are simply asked to do that which\nevery well-bred girl in England would be delighted to do,\" wrote the\nCountess.\n\n\"Ah! she does not know,\" said Lady Anna.\n\nBut there had come upon her now a fear heavier and more awful than\nthat which she entertained for her mother. Earl Lovel knew her\nsecret, and Earl Lovel was to tell it to the Solicitor-General. She\nhardly doubted that it might as well be told to all the judges on the\nbench at once. Would it not be better that she should be married to\nDaniel Thwaite out of hand, and so be freed from the burden of any\nsecret? The young lord had been thoroughly ashamed of her when she\ntold it. Those aunts at Yoxham would hardly speak to her if they knew\nit. That lady before whom she had been made to walk out to dinner,\nwould disdain to sit in the same room with her if she knew it. It\nmust be known,--must be known to them all. But she need not remain\nthere, beneath their eyes, while they learned it. Her mother must\nknow it, and it would be better that she should tell her mother. She\nwould tell her mother,--and request that she might have permission to\nreturn at once to the lodgings in Wyndham Street. So she wrote the\nfollowing letter,--in which, as the reader will perceive, she could\nnot even yet bring herself to tell her secret:--\n\n\n   Yoxham Rectory, Monday.\n\n   MY DEAR MAMMA,\n\n   I want you to let me come home, because I think I have\n   been here long enough. Lord Lovel has gone away, and\n   though you are so very angry, it is better I should\n   tell you that we are not any longer friends. Dear, dear,\n   dearest mamma; I am so very unhappy that you should not be\n   pleased with me. I would die to-morrow if I could make you\n   happy. But it is all over now, and he would not do it even\n   if I could say that it should be so. He has gone away, and\n   is in London, and would tell you so himself if you would\n   ask him. He despises me, as I always knew he would,--and\n   so he has gone away. I don't think anything of myself,\n   because I knew it must be so; but I am so very unhappy\n   because you will be unhappy.\n\n   I don't think they want to have me here any longer, and of\n   course there is no reason why they should. They were very\n   nice to me before all this happened, and they never say\n   anything illnatured to me now. But it is very different,\n   and there cannot be any good in remaining. You are all\n   alone, and I think you would be glad to see your poor\n   Anna, even though you are so angry with her. Pray let me\n   come home. I could start very well on Friday, and I think\n   I will do so, unless I hear from you to the contrary. I\n   can take my place by the coach, and go away at twelve\n   o'clock from York, and be at that place in London on\n   Saturday at eleven. I must take my place on Thursday. I\n   have plenty of money, as I have not spent any since I have\n   been here. Of course Sarah will come with me. She is not\n   nearly so nice since she knew that Lord Lovel was to go\n   away.\n\n   Dear mamma, I do love you so much.\n\n   Your most affectionate daughter,\n\n   ANNA.\n\n\nIt was not wilfully that the poor girl gave her mother no opportunity\nof answering her before she had taken her place by the coach. On\nThursday morning the place had to be taken, and on Thursday evening\nshe got her mother's letter. By the same post came the Earl's letter\nto his aunt, desiring that Lady Anna might, if possible, be kept at\nYoxham. The places were taken, and it was impossible. \"I don't see\nwhy you should go,\" said aunt Julia, who clearly perceived that her\nnephew had been instigated to pursue the marriage scheme since he had\nbeen in town. Lady Anna urged that the money had been paid for two\nplaces by the coach. \"My brother could arrange that, I do not doubt,\"\nsaid aunt Julia. But the Countess now expected her daughter, and\nLady Anna stuck to her resolve. Her mother's letter had not been\npropitious to the movement. If the places were taken, of course she\nmust come. So said the Countess. It was not simply that the money\nshould not be lost, but that the people at Yoxham must not be allowed\nto think that her daughter was over anxious to stay. \"Does your mamma\nwant to have you back?\" asked aunt Julia. Lady Anna would not say\nthat her mother wanted her back, but simply pleaded again that the\nplaces had been taken.\n\nWhen the morning came for her departure, the carriage was ordered to\ntake her into York, and the question arose as to who should go with\nher. It was incumbent on the rector, who held an honorary stall in\nthe cathedral, to be with the dean and his brother prebendaries on\nthat day, and the use of his own carriage would be convenient to him.\n\n\"I think I'll have the gig,\" said the rector.\n\n\"My dear Charles,\" pleaded his sister, \"surely that will be foolish.\nShe can't hurt you.\"\n\n\"I don't know that,\" said the rector. \"I think she has hurt me very\nmuch already. I shouldn't know how to talk to her.\"\n\n\"You may be sure that Frederic means to go on with it,\" said Mrs.\nLovel.\n\n\"It would have been better for Frederic if he had never seen her,\"\nsaid the rector; \"and I'm sure it would have been better for me.\"\n\nBut he consented at last, and he himself handed Lady Anna into the\ncarriage. Mrs. Lovel accompanied them, but Aunt Julia made her\nfarewells in the rectory drawing-room. She managed to get the girl to\nherself for a moment or two, and thus she spoke to her. \"I need not\ntell you that, for yourself, my dear, I like you very much.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Miss Lovel.\"\n\n\"I have heartily wished that you might be our Frederic's wife.\"\n\n\"It can never be,\" said Lady Anna.\n\n\"I won't give up all hope. I don't pretend to understand what there\nis amiss between you and Frederic, but I won't give it up. If it is\nto be so, I hope that you and I may be loving friends till I die.\nGive me a kiss, my dear.\" Lady Anna, whose eyes were suffused with\ntears, threw herself into the arms of the elder lady and embraced\nher.\n\nMrs. Lovel also kissed her, and bade God bless her as she parted from\nher at the coach door; but the rector was less demonstrative. \"I hope\nyou will have a pleasant journey,\" he said, taking off his clerical\nhat.\n\n\"Let it go as it may,\" said Mrs. Lovel, as she walked into the close\nwith her husband, \"you may take my word, she's a good girl.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid she's sly,\" said the rector.\n\n\"She's no more sly than I am,\" said Mrs. Lovel, who herself was by no\nmeans sly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nLADY ANNA'S RECEPTION.\n\n\nThe Countess went into the City to meet her daughter at the Saracen's\nHead, whither the York coach used to run, and received her almost in\nsilence. \"Oh, mamma, dear mamma,\" said Lady Anna, \"I am so glad to\nbe back with you again.\" Sarah, the lady's-maid, was there, useless,\nofficious, and long-eared. The Countess said almost nothing; she\nsubmitted to be kissed, and she asked after the luggage. At that time\nshe had heard the whole story about Daniel Thwaite.\n\nThe Solicitor-General had disregarded altogether his client's\ninjunctions as to secrecy. He had felt that in a matter of so great\nimportance it behoved him to look to his client's interests, rather\nthan his client's instructions. This promise of a marriage with the\ntailor's son must be annihilated. On behalf of the whole Lovel family\nit was his duty, as he thought, to see that this should be effected,\nif possible,--and as quickly as possible. This was his duty, not only\nas a lawyer employed in a particular case, but as a man who would be\nbound to prevent any great evil which he saw looming in the future.\nIn his view of the case the marriage of Lady Anna Lovel, with a\ncolossal fortune, to Daniel Thwaite the tailor, would be a grievous\ninjury to the social world of his country,--and it was one of\nthose evils which may probably be intercepted by due and discreet\nprecautions. No doubt the tailor wanted money. The man was entitled\nto some considerable reward for all that he had done and all that he\nhad suffered in the cause. But Sir William could not himself propose\nthe reward. He could not chaffer for terms with the tailor. He could\nnot be seen in that matter. But having heard the secret from the\nEarl, he thought that he could get the work done. So he sent for Mr.\nFlick, the attorney, and told Mr. Flick all that he knew. \"Gone and\nengaged herself to the tailor!\" said Mr. Flick, holding up both his\nhands. Then Sir William took Lady Anna's part. After all, such an\nengagement was not,--as he thought,--unnatural. It had been made\nwhile she was very young, when she knew no other man of her own age\nin life, when she was greatly indebted to this man, when she had\nhad no opportunity of measuring a young tailor against a young lord.\nShe had done it probably in gratitude;--so said Sir William;--and\nnow clung to it from good faith rather than affection. Neither was\nhe severe upon the tailor. He was a man especially given to make\nexcuses for poor weak, erring, unlearned mortals, ignorant of the\nlaw,--unless when a witness attempted to be impervious;--and now he\nmade excuses for Daniel Thwaite. The man might have done so much\nworse than he was doing. There seemed already to be a noble reliance\non himself in his conduct. Lord Lovel thought that there had been no\ncorrespondence while the young lady had been at Yoxham. There might\nhave been, but had not been, a clandestine marriage. Other reasons\nhe gave why Daniel Thwaite should not be regarded as altogether\nvillanous. But, nevertheless, the tailor must not be allowed to carry\noff the prize. The prize was too great for him. What must be done?\nSir William condescended to ask Mr. Flick what he thought ought to be\ndone. \"No doubt we should be very much guided by you, Mr. Solicitor,\"\nsaid Mr. Flick.\n\n\"One thing is, I think, plain, Mr. Flick. You must see the Countess\nand tell her, or get Mr. Goffe to do so. It is clear that she has\nbeen kept in the dark between them. At present they are all living\ntogether in the same house. She had better leave the place and go\nelsewhere. They should be kept apart, and the girl, if necessary,\nshould be carried abroad.\"\n\n\"I take it there is a difficulty about money, Mr. Solicitor.\"\n\n\"There ought to be none,--and I will take it upon myself to say that\nthere need be none. It is a case in which the court will willingly\nallow money out of the income of the property. The thing is so large\nthat there should be no grudging of money for needful purposes.\nSeeing what prim\u00c3\u00a2 facie claims these ladies have, they are bound to\nallow them to live decently, in accordance with their alleged rank,\ntill the case is settled. No doubt she is the heiress.\"\n\n\"You feel quite sure, Sir William?\"\n\n\"I do;--though, as I have said before, it is a case of feeling sure,\nand not being sure. Had that Italian woman been really the widow,\nsomebody would have brought her case forward more loudly.\"\n\n\"But if the other Italian woman who died was the wife?\"\n\n\"You would have found it out when you were there. Somebody from the\ncountry would have come to us with evidence, knowing how much we\ncould afford to pay for it. Mind you, the matter has been tried\nbefore, in another shape. The old Earl was indicted for bigamy and\nacquitted. We are bound to regard that young woman as Lady Anna\nLovel, and we are bound to regard her and her mother conjointly as\nco-heiresses, in different degrees, to all the personal property\nwhich the old Earl left behind him. We can't with safety take any\nother view. There will still be difficulties in their way;--and very\nserious difficulties, were she to marry this tailor; but, between you\nand me, he would eventually get the money. Perhaps, Mr. Flick, you\nhad better see him. You would know how to get at his views without\ncompromising anybody. But, in the first place, let the Countess know\neverything. After what has been done, you won't have any difficulty\nin meeting Mr. Goffe.\"\n\nMr. Flick had no difficulty in seeing Mr. Goffe,--though he felt that\nthere would be very much difficulty in seeing Mr. Daniel Thwaite.\nHe did tell Mr. Goffe the story of the wicked tailor,--by no means\nmaking those excuses which the Solicitor-General had made for the\nman's presumptuous covetousness. \"I knew the trouble we should have\nwith that man,\" said Mr. Goffe, who had always disliked the Thwaites.\nThen Mr. Flick went on to say that Mr. Goffe had better tell the\nCountess,--and Mr. Goffe on this point agreed with his adversary. Two\nor three days after that, but subsequently to the date of the last\nletter which the mother had written to her daughter, Lady Lovel was\ntold that Lady Anna was engaged to marry Mr. Daniel Thwaite.\n\nShe had suspected how it might be; her heart had for the last month\nbeen heavy with the dread of this great calamity; she had made her\nplans with the view of keeping the two apart; she had asked her\ndaughter questions founded on this very fear;--and yet she could not\nfor a while be brought to believe it. How did Mr. Goffe know? Mr.\nGoffe had heard it from Mr. Flick, who had heard it from Sir William\nPatterson; to whom the tale had been told by Lord Lovel. \"And who\ntold Lord Lovel?\" said the Countess flashing up in anger.\n\n\"No doubt Lady Anna did so,\" said the attorney. But in spite of her\nindignation she could retain her doubts. The attorney, however, was\ncertain. \"There could be no hope but that it was so.\" She still\npretended not to believe it, though fully intending to take all due\nprecautions in the matter. Since Mr. Goffe thought that it would be\nprudent, she would remove to other lodgings. She would think of that\nplan of going abroad. She would be on her guard, she said. But she\nwould not admit it to be possible that Lady Anna Lovel, the daughter\nof Earl Lovel, her daughter, should have so far disgraced herself.\n\nBut she did believe it. Her heart had in truth told her that it was\ntrue at the first word the lawyer had spoken to her. How blind she\nmust have been not to have known it! How grossly stupid not to have\nunderstood those asseverations from the girl, that the marriage with\nher cousin was impossible! Her child had not only deceived her, but\nhad possessed cunning enough to maintain her deception. It must have\nbeen going on for at least the last twelvemonth, and she, the while,\nhad been kept in the dark by the manoeuvres of a simple girl! And\nthen she thought of the depth of the degradation which was prepared\nfor her. Had she passed twenty years of unintermittent combat for\nthis,--that when all had been done, when at last success was won,\nwhen the rank and wealth of her child had been made positively\nsecure before the world, when she was about to see the unquestioned\ncoronet of a Countess placed upon her child's brow,--all should be\ndestroyed through a passion so mean as this! Would it not have been\nbetter to have died in poverty and obscurity,--while there were yet\ndoubts,--before any assured disgrace had rested on her? But, oh! to\nhave proved that she was a Countess, and her child the heiress of\nan Earl, in order that the Lady Anna Lovel might become the wife of\nDaniel Thwaite, the tailor!\n\nShe made many resolutions; but the first was this, that she would\nnever smile upon the girl again till this baseness should have been\nabandoned. She loved her girl as only mothers do love. More devoted\nthan the pelican, she would have given her heart's blood,--had given\nall her life,--not only to nurture, but to aggrandize her child. The\nestablishment of her own position, her own honour, her own name, was\nto her but the incidental result of her daughter's emblazonment in\nthe world. The child which she had borne to Earl Lovel, and which the\nfather had stigmatised as a bastard, should by her means be known as\nthe Lady Anna, the heiress of that father's wealth,--the wealthiest,\nthe fairest, the most noble of England's daughters. Then there had\ncome the sweet idea that this high-born heiress of the Lovels, should\nherself become Countess Lovel, and the mother had risen higher in her\ndelighted pride. It had all been for her child! Had she not loved as\na mother, and with all a mother's tenderness? And for what?\n\nShe would love still, but she would never again be tender till her\ndaughter should have repudiated her base,--her monstrous engagement.\nShe bound up all her faculties to harshness, and a stern resolution.\nHer daughter had been deceitful, and she would now be ruthless. There\nmight be suffering, but had not she suffered? There might be sorrow,\nbut had not she sorrowed? There might be a contest, but had not she\never been contesting? Sooner than that the tailor should reap the\nfruit of her labours,--labours which had been commenced when she\nfirst gave herself in marriage to that dark, dreadful man,--sooner\nthan that her child should make ignoble the blood which it had cost\nher so much to ennoble, she would do deeds which should make even\nthe wickedness of her husband child's play in the world's esteem. It\nwas in this mood of mind that she went to meet her daughter at the\nSaracen's Head.\n\nShe had taken fresh lodgings very suddenly,--in Keppel Street, near\nRussell Square, a long way from Wyndham Street. She had asked Mr.\nGoffe to recommend her a place, and he had sent her to an old lady\nwith whom he himself had lodged in his bachelor's days. Keppel\nStreet cannot be called fashionable, and Russell Square is not much\naffected by the nobility. Nevertheless the house was superior in\nall qualifications to that which she was now leaving, and the rent\nwas considerably higher. But the affairs of the Countess in regard\nto money were in the ascendant; and Mr. Goffe did not scruple to\ntake for her a \"genteel\" suite of drawing-rooms,--two rooms with\nfolding-doors, that is,--with the bedrooms above, first-class\nlodging-house attendance, and a garret for the lady's-maid. \"And then\nit will be quite close to Mrs. Bluestone,\" said Mr. Goffe, who knew\nof that intimacy.\n\nThe drive in a glass coach home from the coach-yard to Keppel Street\nwas horrible to Lady Anna. Not a word was spoken, as Sarah, the\nlady's-maid, sat with them in the carriage. Once or twice the poor\ngirl tried to get hold of her mother's hand, in order that she might\nentice something of a caress. But the Countess would admit of no such\nsoftness, and at last withdrew her hand roughly. \"Oh mamma!\" said\nLady Anna, unable to suppress her dismay. But the Countess said never\na word. Sarah, the lady's-maid, began to think that there must be a\nsecond lover. \"Is this Wyndham Street?\" said Lady Anna when the coach\nstopped.\n\n\"No, my dear;--this is not Wyndham Street. I have taken another\nabode. This is where we are to live. If you will get out I will\nfollow you, and Sarah will look to the luggage.\" Then the daughter\nentered the house, and met the old woman curtseying to her. She at\nonce felt that she had been removed from contact with Daniel Thwaite,\nand was sure that her mother knew her story. \"That is your room,\"\nsaid her mother. \"You had better get your things off. Are you tired?\"\n\n\"Oh! so tired!\" and Lady Anna burst into tears.\n\n\"What will you have?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing! I think I will go to bed, mamma. Why are you unkind to\nme? Do tell me. Anything is better than that you should be unkind.\"\n\n\"Anna,--have not you been unkind to me?\"\n\n\"Never, mamma;--never. I have never meant to be unkind. I love you\nbetter than all the world. I have never been unkind. But, you;--Oh,\nmamma, if you look at me like that, I shall die.\"\n\n\"Is it true that you have promised that you would be the wife of Mr.\nDaniel Thwaite?\"\n\n\"Mamma!\"\n\n\"Is it true? I will be open with you. Mr. Goffe tells me that you\nhave refused Lord Lovel, telling him that you must do so because you\nwere engaged to Mr. Daniel Thwaite. Is that true?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma;--it is true.\"\n\n\"And you have given your word to that man?\"\n\n\"I have, mamma.\"\n\n\"And yet you told me that there was no one else when I spoke to you\nof Lord Lovel? You lied to me?\" The girl sat confounded, astounded,\nwithout power of utterance. She had travelled from York to London,\ninside one of those awful vehicles of which we used to be so proud\nwhen we talked of our stage coaches. She was thoroughly weary and\nworn out. She had not breakfasted that morning, and was sick and\nill at ease, not only in heart, but in body also. Of course it was\nso. Her mother knew that it was so. But this was no time for fond\ncompassion. It would be better, far better that she should die\nthan that she should not be compelled to abandon this grovelling\nabasement. \"Then you lied to me?\" repeated the Countess still\nstanding over her.\n\n\"Oh, mamma, you mean to kill me.\"\n\n\"I would sooner die here, at your feet, this moment, and know that\nyou must follow me within an hour, than see you married to such a one\nas that. You shall never marry him. Though I went into court myself\nand swore that I was that lord's mistress,--that I knew it when I\nwent to him,--that you were born a brat beyond the law, that I had\nlived a life of perjury, I would prevent such greater disgrace as\nthis. It shall never be. I will take you away where he shall never\nhear of you. As to the money, it shall go to the winds, so that he\nshall never touch it. Do you think that it is you that he cares for?\nHe has heard of all this wealth,--and you are but the bait upon his\nhook to catch it.\"\n\n\"You do not know him, mamma.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me of him, that I do not know him; impudent slut!\nDid I not know him before you were born? Have I not known him all\nthrough? Will you give me your word of honour that you will never see\nhim again?\" Lady Anna tried to think, but her mind would not act for\nher. Everything was turning round, and she became giddy and threw\nherself on the bed. \"Answer me, Anna. Will you give me your word of\nhonour that you will never see him again?\"\n\nShe might still have said yes. She felt that enough of speech was\nleft to her for so small an effort,--and she knew that if she did so\nthe agony of the moment would pass away from her. With that one word\nspoken her mother would be kind to her, and would wait upon her;\nwould bring her tea, and would sit by her bedside, and caress her.\nBut she too was a Lovel, and she was, moreover, the daughter of her\nwho once had been Josephine Murray.\n\n\"I cannot say that, mamma,\" she said, \"because I have promised.\"\n\nHer mother dashed from the room, and she was left alone upon the bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nDANIEL AND THE LAWYER.\n\n\nIt has been said that the Countess, when she sent her daughter down\nto Yoxham, laid her plans with the conviction that the associations\nto which the girl would be subjected among the Lovels would fill her\nheart and mind with a new-born craving for the kind of life which she\nwould find in the rector's family;--and she had been right. Daniel\nThwaite also had known that it would be so. He had been quite alive\nto the fact that he and his conversation would be abased, and that\nhis power, both of pleasing and of governing, would be lessened,\nby this new contact. But, had he been able to hinder her going, he\nwould not have done so. None of those who were now interested in\nhis conduct knew aught of the character of this man. Sir William\nPatterson had given him credit for some honesty, but even he had\nnot perceived,--had had no opportunity of perceiving,--the staunch\nuprightness which was as it were a backbone to the man in all his\ndoings. He was ambitious, discontented, sullen, and tyrannical. He\nhated the domination of others, but was prone to domineer himself. He\nsuspected evil of all above him in rank, and the millennium to which\nhe looked forward was to be produced by the gradual extirpation\nof all social distinctions. Gentlemen, so called, were to him as\nsavages, which had to be cleared away in order that that perfection\nmight come at last which the course of nature was to produce in\nobedience to the ordinances of the Creator. But he was a man who\nreverenced all laws,--and a law, if recognised as a law, was a law\nto him whether enforced by a penalty, or simply exigent of obedience\nfrom his conscience. This girl had been thrown in his way, and he\nhad first pitied and then loved her from his childhood. She had been\ninjured by the fiendish malice of her own father,--and that father\nhad been an Earl. He had been strong in fighting for the rights\nof the mother,--not because it had been the mother's right to be\na Countess,--but in opposition to the Earl. At first,--indeed\nthroughout all these years of conflict, except the last year,--there\nhad been a question, not of money, but of right. The wife was\nentitled to due support,--to what measure of support Daniel had never\nknown or inquired; but the daughter had been entitled to nothing. The\nEarl, had he made his will before he was mad,--or, more probably, had\nhe not destroyed, when mad, the will which he had before made,--might\nand would have left the girl without a shilling. In those days, when\nDaniel's love was slowly growing, when he wandered about with the\nchild among the rocks, when the growing girl had first learned to\nswear to him that he should always be her friend of friends, when the\nlove of the boy had first become the passion of the man, there had\nbeen no thought of money in it. Money! Had he not been well aware\nfrom his earliest understanding of the need of money for all noble\npurposes, that the earnings of his father, which should have made the\nworld to him a world of promise, were being lavished in the service\nof these forlorn women? He had never complained. They were welcome to\nit all. That young girl was all the world to him; and it was right\nthat all should be spent; as though she had been a sister, as though\nshe had already been his wife. There had been no plot then by which\nhe was to become rich on the Earl's wealth. Then had come the will,\nand the young Earl's claims, and the general belief of men in all\nquarters that the young Earl was to win everything. What was left of\nthe tailor's savings was still being spent on behalf of the Countess.\nThe first fee that ever found its way into the pocket of Serjeant\nBluestone had come from the diminished hoard of old Thomas Thwaite.\nThen the will had been set aside; and gradually the cause of the\nCountess had grown to be in the ascendant. Was he to drop his love,\nto confess himself unworthy, and to slink away out of her sight,\nbecause the girl would become an heiress? Was he even to conceive so\nbadly of her as to think that she would drop her love because she\nwas an heiress? There was no such humility about him,--nor such\nabsence of self-esteem. But, as regarded her, he told himself at once\nthat she should have the chance of being base and noble,--all base,\nand all noble as far as title and social standing could make her\nso,--if such were her desire. He had come to her and offered her her\nfreedom;--had done so, indeed, with such hot language of indignant\nprotest against the gilded gingerbread of her interested suitor, as\nwould have frightened her from the acceptance of his offer had she\nbeen minded to accept it;--but his words had been hot, not from\na premeditated purpose to thwart his own seeming liberality, but\nbecause his nature was hot and his temper imperious. This lordling\nwas ready to wed his bride,--the girl he had known and succoured\nthroughout their joint lives,--simply because she was rich and the\nlordling was a pauper. From the bottom of his heart he despised the\nlordling. He had said to himself a score of times that he could be\nwell content to see the lord take the money, waste it among thieves\nand prostitutes, and again become a pauper, while he had the girl to\nsit with him at his board, and share with him the earnings of his\nhonest labour. Of course he had spoken out. But the girl should be at\nliberty to do as she pleased.\n\nHe wrote no line to her before she went, or while she was at Yoxham,\nnor did he speak a word concerning her during her absence. But as he\nsat at his work, or walked to and fro between his home and the shop,\nor lay sleepless in bed, all his thoughts were of her. Twice or\nthrice a week he would knock at the door of the Countess's room, and\nsay a word or two, as was rendered natural by their long previous\nintercourse. But there had been no real intercourse between them. The\nCountess told him nothing of her plans; nor did he ever speak to her\nof his. Each suspected the other; and each was grimly civil. Once or\ntwice the Countess expressed a hope that the money advanced by Thomas\nThwaite might soon be repaid to him with much interest. Daniel would\nalways treat the subject with a noble indifference. His father, he\nsaid, had never felt an hour's regret at having parted with his\nmoney. Should it, perchance, come back to him, he would take it, no\ndoubt, with thanks.\n\nThen he heard one evening, as he returned from his work, that the\nCountess was about to remove herself on the morrow to another home.\nThe woman of the house, who told him, did not know where the Countess\nhad fixed her future abode. He passed on up to his bedroom, washed\nhis hands, and immediately went down to his fellow-lodger. After the\nfirst ordinary greeting, which was cold and almost unkind, he at once\nasked his question. \"They tell me that you go from this to-morrow\nLady Lovel.\" She paused a moment, and then bowed her head. \"Where is\nit that you are going to live?\" She paused again, and paused long,\nfor she had to think what answer she would make him. \"Do you object\nto let me know?\" he asked.\n\n\"Mr. Thwaite, I must object.\"\n\nThen at that moment there came upon him the memory of all that he and\nhis father had done, and not the thought of that which he intended to\ndo. This was the gratitude of a Countess! \"In that case of course I\nshall not ask again. I had hoped that we were friends.\"\n\n\"Of course we are friends. Your father has been the best friend I\never had. I shall write to your father and let him know. I am bound\nto let your father know all that I do. But at present my case is in\nthe hands of my lawyers, and they have advised that I should tell no\none in London where I live.\"\n\n\"Then good evening, Lady Lovel. I beg your pardon for having\nintruded.\" He left the room without another word, throwing off the\ndust from his feet as he went with violent indignation. He and she\nmust now be enemies. She had told him that she would separate herself\nfrom him,--and they must be separated. Could he have expected better\nthings from a declared Countess? But how would it be with Lady Anna?\nShe also had a title. She also would have wealth She might become a\nCountess if she wished it. Let him only know by one sign from her\nthat she did wish it, and he would take himself off at once to the\nfarther side of the globe, and live in a world contaminated by no\nnoble lords and titled ladies. As it happened the Countess might\nas well have given him the address, as the woman at the lodgings\ninformed him on the next morning that the Countess had removed\nherself to No. ---- Keppel Street.\n\nHe did not doubt that Lady Anna was about to return to London. That\nquick removal would not otherwise have been made. But what mattered\nit to him whether she were at Yoxham or in Keppel Street? He could do\nnothing. There would come a time,--but it had not come as yet,--when\nhe must go to the girl boldly, let her be guarded as she might, and\ndemand her hand. But the demand must be made to herself and herself\nonly. When that time came there should be no question of money.\nWhether she were the undisturbed owner of hundreds of thousands, or\na rejected claimant to her father's name, the demand should be made\nin the same tone and with the same assurance. He knew well the whole\nhistory of her life. She had been twenty years old last May, and it\nwas now September. When the next spring should come round she would\nbe her own mistress, free to take herself from her mother's hands,\nand free to give herself to whom she would. He did not say that\nnothing should be done during those eight months; but, according to\nhis lights, he could not make his demand with full force till she was\na woman, as free from all legal control, as was he as a man.\n\nThe chances were much against him. He knew what were the allurements\nof luxury. There were moments in which he told himself that of course\nshe would fall into the nets that were spread for her. But then again\nthere would grow within his bosom a belief in truth and honesty which\nwould buoy him up. How grand would be his victory, how great the\ntriumph of a human soul's nobility, if, after all these dangers, if\nafter all the enticements of wealth and rank, the girl should come\nto him, and lying on his bosom, should tell him that she had never\nwavered from him through it all! Of this, at any rate, he assured\nhimself,--that he would not go prying, with clandestine manoeuvres,\nabout that house in Keppel Street. The Countess might have told him\nwhere she intended to live without increasing her danger.\n\nWhile things were in this state with him he received a letter from\nMessrs. Norton and Flick, the attorneys, asking him to call on Mr.\nFlick at their chambers in Lincoln's Inn. The Solicitor-General had\nsuggested to the attorney that he should see the man, and Mr. Flick\nhad found himself bound to obey; but in truth he hardly knew what to\nsay to Daniel Thwaite. It must be his object of course to buy off\nthe tailor; but such arrangements are difficult, and require great\ncaution. And then Mr. Flick was employed by Earl Lovel, and this man\nwas the friend of the Earl's opponents in the case. Mr. Flick did\nfeel that the Solicitor-General was moving into great irregularities\nin this cause. The cause itself was no doubt peculiar,--unlike\nany other cause with which Mr. Flick had become acquainted in his\nexperience; there was no saying at the present moment who had\nopposed interests, and who combined interests in the case; but\nstill etiquette is etiquette, and Mr. Flick was aware that such a\nhouse as that of Messrs. Norton and Flick should not be irregular.\nNevertheless he sent for Daniel Thwaite.\n\nAfter having explained who he was, which Daniel knew very well,\nwithout being told, Mr. Flick began his work. \"You are aware, Mr.\nThwaite, that the friends on both sides are endeavouring to arrange\nthis question amicably without any further litigation.\"\n\n\"I am aware that the friends of Lord Lovel, finding that they have no\nground to stand on at law, are endeavouring to gain their object by\nother means.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Thwaite. I cannot admit that for a moment. That would be\naltogether an erroneous view of the proceeding.\"\n\n\"Is Lady Anna Lovel the legitimate daughter of the late Earl?\"\n\n\"That is what we do not know. That is what nobody knows. You are not\na lawyer, Mr. Thwaite, or you would be aware that there is nothing\nmore difficult to decide than questions of legitimacy. It has\nsometimes taken all the Courts a century to decide whether a marriage\nis a marriage or not. You have heard of the great MacFarlane case.\nTo find out who was the MacFarlane they had to go back a hundred\nand twenty years, and at last decide on the memory of a man whose\ngrandmother had told him that she had seen a woman wearing a\nwedding-ring. The case cost over forty thousand pounds, and took\nnineteen years. As far as I can see this is more complicated even\nthan that. We should in all probability have to depend on the\nproceedings of the courts in Sicily, and you and I would never live\nto see the end of it.\"\n\n\"You would live on it, Mr. Flick, which is more than I could do.\"\n\n\"Mr. Thwaite, that I think is a very improper observation; but,\nhowever--. My object is to explain to you that all these difficulties\nmay be got over by a very proper and natural alliance between Earl\nLovel and the lady who is at present called by courtesy Lady Anna\nLovel.\"\n\n\"By the Crown's courtesy, Mr. Flick,\" said the tailor, who understood\nthe nature of the titles which he hated.\n\n\"We allow the name, I grant you, at present; and are anxious to\npromote the marriage. We are all most anxious to bring to a close\nthis ruinous litigation. Now, I am told that the young lady feels\nherself hampered by some childish promise that has been made--to\nyou.\"\n\nDaniel Thwaite had expected no such announcement as this. He did not\nconceive that the girl would tell the story of her engagement, and\nwas unprepared at the moment for any reply. But he was not a man to\nremain unready long. \"Do you call it childish?\" he said.\n\n\"I do certainly.\"\n\n\"Then what would her engagement be if now made with the Earl? The\nengagement with me, as an engagement, is not yet twelve months old,\nand has been repeated within the last month. She is an infant, Mr.\nFlick, according to your language, and therefore, perhaps, a child in\nthe eye of the law. If Lord Lovel wishes to marry her, why doesn't he\ndo so? He is not hindered, I suppose, by her being a child.\"\n\n\"Any marriage with you, you know, would in fact be impossible.\"\n\n\"A marriage with me, Mr. Flick, would be quite as possible as one\nwith the Lord Lovel. When the lady is of age, no clergyman in England\ndare refuse to marry us, if the rules prescribed by law have been\nobeyed.\"\n\n\"Well, well, Mr. Thwaite; I do not want to argue with you about the\nlaw and about possibilities. The marriage would not be fitting, and\nyou know that it would not be fitting.\"\n\n\"It would be most unfitting,--unless the lady wished it as well as I.\nJust as much may be said of her marriage with Earl Lovel. To which of\nus has she given her promise? which of us has she known and loved?\nwhich of us has won her by long friendship and steady regard? and\nwhich of us, Mr. Flick, is attracted to the marriage by the lately\nassured wealth of the young woman? I never understood that Lord Lovel\nwas my rival when Lady Anna was regarded as the base-born child of\nthe deceased madman.\"\n\n\"I suppose, Mr. Thwaite, you are not indifferent to her money?\"\n\n\"Then you suppose wrongly,--as lawyers mostly do when they take upon\nthemselves to attribute motives.\"\n\n\"You are not civil, Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"You did not send for me here, sir, in order that there should be\ncivilities between us. But I will at least be true. In regard to Lady\nAnna's money, should it become mine by reason of her marriage with\nme, I will guard it for her sake, and for that of the children she\nmay bear, with all my power. I will assert her right to it as a\nman should do. But my purpose in seeking her hand will neither be\nstrengthened nor weakened by her money. I believe that it is hers.\nNay,--I know that the law will give it to her. On her behalf, as\nbeing betrothed to her, I defy Lord Lovel and all other claimants.\nBut her money and her hand are two things apart, and I will never be\ngoverned as to the one by any regard as to the other. Perhaps, Mr.\nFlick, I have said enough,--and so, good morning.\" Then he went away.\n\nThe lawyer had never dared to suggest the compromise which had been\nhis object in sending for the man. He had not dared to ask the tailor\nhow much ready money he would take down to abandon the lady, and thus\nto relieve them all from that difficulty. No doubt he exercised a\nwise discretion, as had he done so, Daniel Thwaite might have become\neven more uncivil than before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nTHERE IS A GULF FIXED.\n\n\n\"Do you think that you could be happier as the wife of such a one as\nDaniel Thwaite, a creature infinitely beneath you, separated as you\nwould be from all your kith and kin, from all whose blood you share,\nfrom me and from your family, than you would be as the bearer of a\nproud name, the daughter and the wife of an Earl Lovel,--the mother\nof the earl to come? I will not speak now of duty, or of fitness, or\nof the happiness of others which must depend upon you. It is natural\nthat a girl should look to her own joys in marriage. Do you think\nthat your joy can consist in calling that man your husband?\"\n\nIt was thus that the Countess spoke to her daughter, who was then\nlying worn out and ill on her bed in Keppel Street. For three days\nshe had been subject to such addresses as this, and during those\nthree days no word of tenderness had been spoken to her. The Countess\nhad been obdurate in her hardness,--still believing that she might\nthus break her daughter's spirit, and force her to abandon her\nengagement. But as yet she had not succeeded. The girl had been\nmeek and, in all other things, submissive. She had not defended her\nconduct. She had not attempted to say that she had done well in\npromising to be the tailor's bride. She had shown herself willing by\nher silence to have her engagement regarded as a great calamity, as a\ndreadful evil that had come upon the whole Lovel family. She had not\nboldness to speak to her mother as she had spoken on the subject to\nthe Earl. She threw herself entirely upon her promise, and spoke of\nher coming destiny as though it had been made irrevocable by her own\nword. \"I have promised him, mamma, and have sworn that it should be\nso.\" That was the answer which she now made from her bed;--the answer\nwhich she had made a dozen times during the last three days.\n\n\"Is everybody belonging to you to be ruined because you once spoke a\nfoolish word?\"\n\n\"Mamma, it was often spoken,--very often, and he does not wish that\nanybody should be ruined. He told me that Lord Lovel might have the\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Foolish, ungrateful girl! It is not for Lord Lovel that I am\npleading to you. It is for the name, and for your own honour. Do you\nnot constantly pray to God to keep you in that state of life to which\nit has pleased Him to call you;--and are you not departing from it\nwilfully and sinfully by such an act as this?\" But still Lady Anna\ncontinued to say that she was bound by the obligation which was upon\nher.\n\nOn the following day the Countess was frightened, believing that the\ngirl was really ill. In truth she was ill,--so that the doctor who\nvisited her declared that she must be treated with great care. She\nwas harassed in spirit,--so the doctor said,--and must be taken away,\nso that she might be amused. The Countess was frightened, but still\nwas resolute. She not only loved her daughter,--but loved no other\nhuman being on the face of the earth. Her daughter was all that she\nhad to bind her to the world around her. But she declared to herself\nagain and again that it would be better that her daughter should\ndie than live and be married to the tailor. It was a case in which\npersecution even to the very gate of the grave would be wise and\nwarrantable,--if by such persecution this odious, monstrous marriage\nmight be avoided. And she did believe that persecution would avail at\nlast. If she were only steady in her resolve, the girl would never\ndare to demand the right to leave her mother's house and walk off to\nthe church to be married to Daniel Thwaite, without the countenance\nof a single friend. The girl's strength was not of that nature. But\nwere she, the Countess, to yield an inch, then this evil might come\nupon them. She had heard that young people can always beat their\nparents if they be sufficiently obdurate. Parents are soft-hearted to\ntheir children, and are prone to yield. And so would she have been\nsoft-hearted, if the interests concerned had been less important,\nif the deviation from duty had been less startling, or the union\nproposed less monstrous and disgraceful. But in this case it behoved\nher to be obdurate,--even though it should be to the very gates of\nthe grave. \"I swear to you,\" she said, \"that the day of your marriage\nto Daniel Thwaite shall be the day of my death.\"\n\nIn her straits she went to Serjeant Bluestone for advice. Now, the\nSerjeant had hitherto been opposed to all compromise, feeling certain\nthat everything might be gained without the sacrifice of a single\nright. He had not a word to say against a marriage between the two\ncousins, but let the cousin who was the heiress be first placed in\npossession of her rights. Let her be empowered, when she consented\nto become Lady Lovel, to demand such a settlement of the property as\nwould be made on her behalf if she were the undisputed owner of the\nproperty. Let her marry the lord if she would, but not do so in order\nthat she might obtain the partial enjoyment of that which was all her\nown. And then, so the Serjeant had argued, the widowed Countess would\nnever be held to have established absolutely her own right to her\nname, should any compromise be known to have been effected. People\nmight call her Countess Lovel; but, behind her back, they would say\nthat she was no countess. The Serjeant had been very hot about it,\nespecially disliking the interference of Sir William. But now, when\nhe heard this new story, his heat gave way. Anything must be done\nthat could be done;--everything must be done to prevent such a\ntermination to the career of the two ladies as would come from a\nmarriage with the tailor.\n\nBut he was somewhat dismayed when he came to understand the condition\nof affairs in Keppel Street. \"How can I not be severe?\" said the\nCountess, when he remonstrated with her. \"If I were tender with\nher she would think that I was yielding. Is not everything at\nstake,--everything for which my life has been devoted?\" The Serjeant\ncalled his wife into council, and then suggested that Lady Anna\nshould spend a week or two in Bedford Square. He assured the Countess\nthat she might be quite sure that Daniel Thwaite should find no\nentrance within his doors.\n\n\"But if Lord Lovel would do us the honour to visit us, we should be\nmost happy to see him,\" said the Serjeant.\n\nLady Anna was removed to Bedford Square, and there became subject to\ntreatment that was milder, but not less persistent. Mrs. Bluestone\nlectured her daily, treating her with the utmost respect, paying to\nher rank a deference, which was not indeed natural to the good lady,\nbut which was assumed, so that Lady Anna might the better comprehend\nthe difference between her own position and that of the tailor. The\ngirls were told nothing of the tailor,--lest the disgrace of so\nunnatural a partiality might shock their young minds; but they\nwere instructed that there was danger, and that they were always,\nin speaking to their guest, to take it for granted that she was\nto become Countess Lovel. Her maid, Sarah, went with her to the\nSerjeant's, and was taken into a half-confidence. Lady Anna was never\nto be left a moment alone. She was to be a prisoner with gilded\nchains,--for whom a splendid, a glorious future was in prospect, if\nonly she would accept it.\n\n\"I really think that she likes the lord the best,\" said Mrs.\nBluestone to her husband.\n\n\"Then why the mischief won't she have him?\" This was in October, and\nthat November term was fast approaching in which the cause was set\ndown for trial.\n\n\"I almost think she would if he'd come and ask her again. Of course,\nI have never mentioned the other man; but when I speak to her of Earl\nLovel, she always answers me as though she were almost in love with\nhim. I was inquiring yesterday what sort of a man he was, and she\nsaid he was quite perfect. 'It is a thousand pities,' she said, 'that\nhe should not have this money. He ought to have it, as he is the\nEarl.'\"\n\n\"Why doesn't she give it to him?\"\n\n\"I asked her that; but she shook, her head and said, that it could\nnever be. I think that man has made her swear some sort of awful\noath, and has frightened her.\"\n\n\"No doubt he has made her swear an oath, but we all know how the gods\nregard the perjuries of lovers,\" said the Serjeant. \"We must get the\nyoung lord here when he comes back to town.\"\n\n\"Is he handsome?\" asked Alice Bluestone, the younger daughter, who\nhad become Lady Anna's special friend in the family. Of course they\nwere talking of Lord Lovel.\n\n\"Everybody says he is.\"\n\n\"But what do you say?\"\n\n\"I don't think it matters much about a man being handsome,--but he is\nbeautiful. Not dark, like all the other Lovels; nor yet what you call\nfair. I don't think that fair men ever look manly.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Alice, who was contemplating an engagement with a\nblack-haired young barrister.\n\n\"Lord Lovel is brown,--with blue eyes; but it is the shape of his\nface that is so perfect,--an oval, you know, that is not too long.\nBut it isn't that makes him look as he does. He looks as though\neverybody in the world ought to do exactly what he tells them.\"\n\n\"And why don't you, dear, do exactly what he tells you?\"\n\n\"Ah,--that is another question. I should do many things if he told\nme. He is the head of our family. I think he ought to have all this\nmoney, and be a rich great man, as the Earl Lovel should be.\"\n\n\"And yet you won't be his wife?\"\n\n\"Would you,--if you had promised another man?\"\n\n\"Have you promised another man?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I have.\"\n\n\"Who is he, Lady Anna?\"\n\n\"They have not told you, then?\"\n\n\"No;--nobody has told me. I know they all want you to marry Lord\nLovel,--and I know he wants it. I know he is quite in love with you.\"\n\n\"Ah;--I do not think that. But if he were, it could make no\ndifference. If you had once given your word to another man, would you\ngo back because a lord asked you?\"\n\n\"I don't think I would ever give my word without asking mamma.\"\n\n\"If he had been good to you, and you had loved him always, and he had\nbeen your best friend,--what would you do then?\"\n\n\"Who is he, Lady Anna?\"\n\n\"Do not call me Lady Anna, or I shall not like you. I will tell you,\nbut you must not say that I told you. Only I thought everybody knew.\nI told Lord Lovel, and he, I think, has told all the world. It is Mr.\nDaniel Thwaite.\"\n\n\"Mr. Daniel Thwaite!\" said Alice, who had heard enough of the case to\nknow who the Thwaites were. \"He is a tailor!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lady Anna proudly; \"he is a tailor.\"\n\n\"Surely that cannot be good,\" said Alice, who, having long since felt\nwhat it was to be the daughter of a serjeant, had made up her mind\nthat she would marry nothing lower than a barrister.\n\n\"It is what you call bad, I dare say.\"\n\n\"I don't think a tailor can be a gentleman.\"\n\n\"I don't know. Perhaps I wasn't a lady when I promised him. But I\ndid promise. You can never know what he and his father did for us.\nI think we should have died only for them. You don't know how we\nlived;--in a little cottage, with hardly any money, with nobody to\ncome near us but they. Everybody else thought that we were vile and\nwicked. It is true. But they always were good to us. Would not you\nhave loved him?\"\n\n\"I should have loved him in a kind of way.\"\n\n\"When one takes so much, one must give in return what one has to\ngive,\" said Lady Anna.\n\n\"Do you love him still?\"\n\n\"Of course I love him.\"\n\n\"And you wish to be his wife?\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think I don't. It is not that I am ashamed for myself.\nWhat would it have signified if I had gone away with him straight\nfrom Cumberland, before I had ever seen my cousins? Supposing that\nmamma hadn't been the Countess--\"\n\n\"But she is.\"\n\n\"So they say now;--but if they had said that she was not, nobody\nwould have thought it wrong then for me to marry Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it wrong yourself?\"\n\n\"It would be best for me to say that I would never marry any one at\nall. He would be very angry with me.\"\n\n\"Lord Lovel?\"\n\n\"Oh no;--not Lord Lovel. Daniel would be very angry, because he\nreally loves me. But it would not be so bad to him as though I became\nLord Lovel's wife. I will tell you the truth, dear. I am ashamed to\nmarry Mr. Thwaite,--not for myself, but because I am Lord Lovel's\ncousin and mamma's daughter. And I should be ashamed to marry Lord\nLovel.\"\n\n\"Why, dear?\"\n\n\"Because I should be false and ungrateful! I should be afraid to\nstand before him if he looked at me. You do not know how he can look.\nHe, too, can command. He, too, is noble. They believe it is the money\nhe wants, and when they call him a tailor, they think that he must be\nmean. He is not mean. He is clever, and can talk about things better\nthan my cousin. He can work hard and give away all that he earns. And\nso could his father. They gave all they had to us, and have never\nasked it again. I kissed him once,--and then he said I had paid all\nmy mother's debt.\" Alice Bluestone shrank within herself when she was\ntold by this daughter of a countess of such a deed. It was horrid\nto her mind that a tailor should be kissed by a Lady Anna Lovel.\nBut she herself had perhaps been as generous to the black-browed\nyoung barrister, and had thought no harm. \"They think I do not\nunderstand,--but I do. They all want this money, and then they accuse\nhim, and say he does it that he may become rich. He would give up all\nthe money,--just for me. How would you feel if it were like that with\nyou?\"\n\n\"I think that a girl who is a lady, should never marry a man who is\nnot a gentleman. You know the story of the rich man who could not\nget to Abraham's bosom because there was a gulf fixed. That is how\nit should be;--just as there is with royal people as to marrying\nroyalty. Otherwise everything would get mingled, and there would soon\nbe no difference. If there are to be differences, there should be\ndifferences. That is the meaning of being a gentleman,--or a lady.\"\nSo spoke the young female Conservative with wisdom beyond her\nyears;--nor did she speak quite in vain.\n\n\"I believe what I had better do would be to die,\" said Lady Anna.\n\"Everything would come right then.\"\n\nSome day or two after this Serjeant Bluestone sent a message up to\nLady Anna, on his return home from the courts, with a request that\nshe would have the great kindness to come down to him in his study.\nThe Serjeant had treated her with more than all the deference due to\nher rank since she had been in his house, striving to teach her what\nit was to be the daughter of an Earl and probable owner of twenty\nthousand a year. The Serjeant, to give him his due, cared as little\nas most men for the peerage. He vailed his bonnet to no one but a\njudge,--and not always that with much ceremonious observance. But now\nhis conduct was a part of his duty to a client whom he was determined\nto see established in her rights. He would have handed her her cup\nof tea on his knees every morning, if by doing so he could have made\nclear to her eyes how deep would be her degradation were she to marry\nthe tailor. The message was now brought to her by Mrs. Bluestone,\nwho almost apologized for asking her to trouble herself to walk\ndown-stairs to the back parlour. \"My dear Lady Anna,\" said the\nSerjeant, \"may I ask you to sit down for a moment or two while I\nspeak to you? I have just left your mother.\"\n\n\"How is dear mamma?\" The Serjeant assured her that the Countess was\nwell in health. At this time Lady Anna had not visited her mother\nsince she had left Keppel Street, and had been told that Lady Lovel\nhad refused to see her till she had pledged herself never to marry\nDaniel Thwaite. \"I do so wish I might go to mamma!\"\n\n\"With all my heart I wish you could, Lady Anna. Nothing makes such\nheart-burning sorrow as a family quarrel. But what can I say? You\nknow what your mother thinks?\"\n\n\"Couldn't you manage that she should let me go there just once?\"\n\n\"I hope that we can manage it;--but I want you to listen to me first.\nLord Lovel is back in London.\" She pressed her lips together and\nfastened one hand firmly on the other. If the assurance that was\nrequired from her was ever to be exacted, it should not be exacted by\nSerjeant Bluestone. \"I have seen his lordship to-day,\" continued the\nSerjeant, \"and he has done me the honour to promise that he will dine\nhere to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Lord Lovel?\"\n\n\"Yes;--your cousin, Earl Lovel. There is no reason, I suppose, why\nyou should not meet him? He has not offended you?\"\n\n\"Oh no.--But I have offended him.\"\n\n\"I think not, Lady Anna. He does not speak of you as though there\nwere offence.\"\n\n\"When we parted he would hardly look at me, because I told him--. You\nknow what I told him.\"\n\n\"A gentleman is not necessarily offended because a lady does not\naccept his first offer. Many gentlemen would be offended if that were\nso;--and very many happy marriages would never have a chance of being\nmade. At any rate he is coming, and I thought that perhaps you would\nexcuse me if I endeavoured to explain how very much may depend on the\nmanner in which you may receive him. You must feel that things are\nnot going on quite happily now.\"\n\n\"I am so unhappy, Serjeant Bluestone!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. It must be so. You are likely to be placed,--I think I\nmay say you certainly will be placed,--in such a position that the\nwhole prosperity of a noble and ancient family must depend on what\nyou may do. With one word you can make once more bright a fair name\nthat has long been beneath a cloud. Here in England the welfare of\nthe State depends on the conduct of our aristocracy!\" Oh, Serjeant\nBluestone, Serjeant Bluestone! how could you so far belie your\nopinion as to give expression to a sentiment utterly opposed to your\nown convictions! But what is there that a counsel will not do for a\nclient? \"If they whom Fate and Fortune have exalted, forget what the\ncountry has a right to demand from them, farewell, alas, to the glory\nof old England!\" He had found this kind of thing very effective with\ntwelve men, and surely it might prevail with one poor girl. \"It is\nnot for me, Lady Anna, to dictate to you the choice of a husband. But\nit has become my duty to point out to you the importance of your own\nchoice, and to explain to you, if it may be possible, that you are\nnot like other young ladies. You have in your hands the marring or\nthe making of the whole family of Lovel. As for that suggestion of\na marriage to which you were induced to give ear by feelings of\ngratitude, it would, if carried out, spread desolation in the bosom\nof every relative to whom you are bound by the close ties of noble\nblood.\" He finished his speech, and Lady Anna retired without a word.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nBEDFORD SQUARE.\n\n\nThe Earl, without asking any question on the subject, had found that\nthe Solicitor-General thought nothing of that objection which had\nweighed so heavily on his own mind, as to carrying on his suit with\na girl who had been wooed successfully by a tailor. His own spirit\nrebelled for a while against such condescension. When Lady Anna had\nfirst told him that she had pledged her word to a lover low in the\nscale of men, the thing had seemed to him to be over. What struggle\nmight be made to prevent the accomplishment of so base a marriage\nmust be effected for the sake of the family, and not on his own\nspecial behoof. Not even for twenty thousand a year, not even for\nLady Anna Lovel, not for all the Lovels, would he take to his bosom\nas his bride, the girl who had leaned with loving fondness on the\nshoulders of Daniel Thwaite. But when he found that others did\nnot feel it as he felt it, he turned the matter over again in his\nmind,--and by degrees relented. There had doubtless been much in the\nwhole affair which had placed it outside the pale of things which are\nsubject to the ordinary judgment of men. Lady Anna's position in the\nworld had been very singular. A debt of gratitude was due by her to\nthe tailor, which had seemed to exact from her some great payment. As\nshe had said herself, she had given the only thing which she had to\ngive. Now there would be much to give. The man doubtless deserved his\nreward and should have it, but that reward must not be the hand of\nthe heiress of the Lovels. He, the Earl, would once again claim that\nas his own.\n\nHe had hurried out of town after seeing Sir William, but had not\nreturned to Yoxham. He went again to Scotland, and wrote no further\nletter to the rectory after those three lines which the reader has\nseen. Then he heard from Mr. Flick that Lady Anna was staying with\nthe Serjeant in Bedford Square, and he returned to London at the\nlawyer's instance. It was so expedient that if possible something\nshould be settled before November!\n\nThe only guests asked to meet the Earl at Serjeant Bluestone's, were\nSir William and Lady Patterson, and the black-browed young barrister.\nThe whole proceeding was very irregular,--as Mr. Flick, who knew what\nwas going on, said more than once to his old partner, Mr. Norton.\nThat the Solicitor-General should dine with the Serjeant might be all\nvery well,--though, as school boys say, they had never known each\nother at home before. But that they should meet in this way the then\ntwo opposing clients,--the two claimants to the vast property as to\nwhich a cause was to come on for trial in a few weeks,--did bewilder\nMr. Flick. \"I suppose the Solicitor-General sees his way, but he may\nbe in a mess yet,\" said Mr. Flick. Mr. Norton only scratched his\nhead. It was no work of his.\n\nSir William, who arrived before the Earl, was introduced for the\nfirst time to the young lady. \"Lady Anna,\" he said, \"for some months\npast I have heard much of you. And now I have great pleasure in\nmeeting you.\" She smiled, and strove to look pleased, but she had\nnot a word to say to him. \"You know I ought to be your enemy,\" he\ncontinued laughing, \"but I hope that is well nigh over. I should not\nlike to have to fight so fair a foe.\" Then the young lord arrived,\nand the lawyers of course gave way to the lover.\n\nLady Anna, from the moment in which she was told that he was to come,\nhad thought of nothing but the manner of their greeting. It was not\nthat she was uneasy as to her own fashion of receiving him. She could\nsmile and be silent, and give him her hand or leave it ungiven, as he\nmight demand. But in what manner would he accost her? She had felt\nsure that he had despised her from the moment in which she had told\nhim of her engagement. Of course he had despised her. Those fine\nsentiments about ladies and gentlemen, and the gulf which had been\nfixed, had occurred to her before she heard them from the mouth\nof Miss Alice Bluestone. She understood, as well as did her young\nfriend, what was the difference between her cousin the Earl, and her\nlover the tailor. Of course it would be sweet to be able to love such\na one as her cousin. They all talked to her as though she was simply\nobstinate and a fool, not perceiving, as she did herself, that the\nuntowardness of her fortune had prescribed this destiny for her.\nGood as Daniel Thwaite might be,--as she knew that he was,--she felt\nherself to be degraded in having promised to be his wife. The lessons\nthey had taught her had not been in vain. And she had been specially\ndegraded in the eyes of him, who was to her imagination the brightest\nof human beings. They told her that she might still be his wife\nif only she would consent to hold out her hand when he should ask\nfor it. She did not believe it. Were it true, it could make no\ndifference,--but she did not believe it. He had scorned her when she\ntold him the tale at Bolton Abbey. He had scorned her when he hurried\naway from Yoxham. Now he was coming to the Serjeant's house, with\nthe express intention of meeting her again. Why should he come? Alas,\nalas! She was sure that he would never speak to her again in that\nbright sunny manner, with those dulcet honey words, which he had used\nwhen first they saw each other in Wyndham Street.\n\nNor was he less uneasy as to this meeting. He had not intended to\nscorn her when he parted from her, but he had intended that she\nshould understand that there was an end of his suit. He had loved her\ndearly, but there are obstacles to which love must yield. Had she\nalready married this tailor, how would it have been with him then?\nThat which had appeared to him to be most fit for him to do, had\nsuddenly become altogether unfit,--and he had told himself at the\nmoment that he must take back his love to himself as best he might.\nHe could not sue for that which had once been given to a tailor. But\nnow all that was changed, and he did intend to sue again. She was\nvery beautiful,--to his thinking the very pink of feminine grace, and\nreplete with charms;--soft in voice, soft in manner, with just enough\nof spirit to give her character. What a happy chance it had been,\nwhat marvellous fortune, that he should have been able to love this\ngirl whom it was so necessary that he should marry;--what a happy\nchance, had it not been for this wretched tailor! But now, in spite\nof the tailor, he would try his fate with her once again. He had not\nintended to scorn her when he left her, but he knew that his manner\nto her must have told her that his suit was over. How should he renew\nit again in the presence of Serjeant and Mrs. Bluestone and of Sir\nWilliam and Lady Patterson?\n\nHe was first introduced to the wives of the two lawyers while Lady\nAnna was sitting silent on the corner of a sofa. Mrs. Bluestone,\nforeseeing how it would be, had endeavoured with much prudence to\nestablish her young friend at some distance from the other guests,\nin order that the Earl might have the power of saying some word; but\nthe young barrister had taken this opportunity of making himself\nagreeable, and stood opposite to her talking nothings about the\nemptiness of London, and the glories of the season when it should\ncome. Lady Anna did not hear a word that the young barrister said.\nLady Anna's ear was straining itself to hear what Lord Lovel might\nsay, and her eye, though not quite turned towards him, was watching\nhis every motion. Of course he must speak to her. \"Lady Anna is on\nthe sofa,\" said Mrs. Bluestone. Of course he knew that she was there.\nHe had seen her dear face the moment that he entered the room. He\nwalked up to her and gave her his hand, and smiled upon her.\n\nShe had made up her little speech. \"I hope they are quite well at\nYoxham,\" she said, in that low, soft, silver voice which he had told\nhimself would so well befit the future Countess Lovel.\n\n\"Oh yes;--I believe so. I am a truant there, for I do not answer aunt\nJulia's letters as punctually as I ought to do. I shall be down there\nfor the hunting I suppose next month.\" Then dinner was announced; and\nas it was necessary that the Earl should take down Mrs. Bluestone\nand the Serjeant Lady Anna,--so that the young barrister absolutely\nwent down to dinner with the wife of the Solicitor-General,--the\nconversation was brought to an end. Nor was it possible that they\nshould be made to sit next each other at dinner. And then, when\nat last the late evening came and they were all together in the\ndrawing-room, other things intervened and the half hour so passed\nthat hardly a word was spoken between them. But there was just one\nword as he went away. \"I shall call and see you,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think he means it,\" the Serjeant said to his wife that\nevening, almost in anger.\n\n\"Why not, my dear?\"\n\n\"He did not speak to her.\"\n\n\"People can't speak at dinner-parties when there is anything\nparticular to say. If he didn't mean it, he wouldn't have come. And\nif you'll all have a little patience she'll mean it too. I can't\nforgive her mother for being so hard to her. She's one of the\nsweetest creatures I ever came across.\"\n\nA little patience, and here was November coming! The Earl who had\nnow been dining in his house, meeting his own client there, must\nagain become the Serjeant's enemy in November, unless this matter\nwere settled. The Serjeant at present could see no other way of\nproceeding. The Earl might no doubt retire from the suit, but a jury\nmust then decide whether the Italian woman had any just claim. And\nagainst the claim of the Italian woman the Earl would again come\nforward. The Serjeant as he thought of it, was almost sorry that he\nhad asked the Earl and the Solicitor-General to his house.\n\nOn the very next morning,--early in the day,--the Earl was announced\nin Bedford Square. The Serjeant was of course away at his chambers.\nLady Anna was in her room and Mrs. Bluestone was sitting with her\ndaughter. \"I have come to see my cousin,\" said the Earl boldly.\n\n\"I am so glad that you have come, Lord Lovel.\"\n\n\"Thank you,--well; yes. I know you will not mind my saying so\noutright. Though the papers say that we are enemies, we have many\nthings in common between us.\"\n\n\"I will send her to you. My dear, we will go into the dining-room.\nYou will find lunch ready when you come down, Lord Lovel.\" Then she\nleft him, and he stood looking for a while at the books that were\nlaid about the table.\n\nIt seemed to him to be an age, but at last the door was opened and\nhis cousin crept into the room. When he had parted from her at Yoxham\nhe had called her Lady Anna; but he was determined that she should\nat any rate be again his cousin. \"I could hardly speak to you\nyesterday,\" he said, while he held her hand.\n\n\"No;--Lord Lovel.\"\n\n\"People never can, I think, at small parties like that. Dear Anna,\nyou surprised me so much by what you told me on the banks of the\nWharfe!\" She did not know how to answer him even a word. \"I know that\nI was unkind to you.\"\n\n\"I did not think so, my lord.\"\n\n\"I will tell you just the plain truth. Even though it may be bitter,\nthe truth will be best between us, dearest. When first I heard what\nyou said, I believed that all must be over between you and me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said.\n\n\"But I have thought about it since, and I will not have it so. I have\nnot come to reproach you.\"\n\n\"You may if you will.\"\n\n\"I have no right to do so, and would not if I had. I can understand\nyour feelings of deep gratitude and can respect them.\"\n\n\"But I love him, my lord,\" said Lady Anna, holding her head on high\nand speaking with much dignity. She could hardly herself understand\nthe feeling which induced her so to address him. When she was alone\nthinking of him and of her other lover, her heart was inclined to\nregret in that she had not known her cousin in her early days,--as\nshe had known Daniel Thwaite. She could tell herself, though she\ncould not tell any other human being, that when she had thought that\nshe was giving her heart to the young tailor, she had not quite known\nwhat it was to have a heart to give. The young lord was as a god to\nher; whereas Daniel was but a man,--to whom she owed so deep a debt\nof gratitude that she must sacrifice herself, if needs, be, on his\nbehalf. And yet when the Earl spoke to her of her gratitude to this\nman,--praising it, and professing that he also understood those very\nfeelings which had governed her conduct,--she blazed up almost in\nwrath, and swore that she loved the tailor.\n\nThe Earl's task was certainly difficult. It was his first impulse to\nrush away again, as he had rushed away before. To rush away and leave\nthe country, and let the lawyers settle it all as they would. Could\nit be possible that such a girl as this should love a journeyman\ntailor, and should be proud of her love! He turned from her and\nwalked to the door and back again, during which time she had almost\nrepented of her audacity.\n\n\"It is right that you should love him--as a friend,\" he said.\n\n\"But I have sworn to be his wife.\"\n\n\"And must you keep your oath?\" As she did not answer him he pressed\non with his suit. \"If he loves you I am sure he cannot wish to hurt\nyou, and you know that such a marriage as that would be very hurtful.\nCan it be right that you should descend from your position to pay a\ndebt of gratitude, and that you should do it at the expense of all\nthose who belong to you? Would you break your mother's heart, and\nmine, and bring disgrace upon your family merely because he was good\nto you?\"\n\n\"He was good to my mother as well as me.\"\n\n\"Will it not break her heart? Has she not told you so? But perhaps\nyou do not believe it, my love.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she said.\n\n\"Ah, dearest, you may believe. To my eyes you are the sweetest of\nall God's creatures. Perhaps you think I say so only for the money's\nsake.\"\n\n\"No, my lord, I do not think that.\"\n\n\"Of course much is due to him.\"\n\n\"He wants nothing but that I should be his wife. He has said so, and\nhe is never false. I can trust him at any rate, even though I should\nbetray him. But I will not betray him. I will go away with him and\nthey shall not hear of me, and nobody will remember that I was my\nfather's daughter.\"\n\n\"You are doubting even now, dear.\"\n\n\"But I ought not to doubt. If I doubt it is because I am weak.\"\n\n\"Then still be weak. Surely such weakness will be good when it will\nplease all those who must be dearest to you.\"\n\n\"It will not please him, Lord Lovel.\"\n\n\"Will you do this, dearest;--will you take one week to consider\nand then write to me? You cannot refuse me that, knowing that the\nhappiness and the honour and the welfare of every Lovel depends upon\nyour answer.\"\n\nShe felt that she could not refuse, and she gave him the promise.\nOn that day week she would write to him, and tell him then to what\nresolve she should have brought herself. He came up close to her,\nmeaning to kiss her if she would let him; but she stood aloof, and\nmerely touched his hand. She would obey her betrothed,--at any rate\ntill she should have made up her mind that she would be untrue\nto him. Lord Lovel could not press his wish, and left the house\nunmindful of Mrs. Bluestone's luncheon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nTHE DOG IN THE MANGER.\n\n\nDuring all this time Daniel Thwaite had been living alone, working\nday after day and hour after hour among the men in Wigmore Street,\ntrusted by his employer, disliked by those over whom he was set in\nsome sort of authority, and befriended by none. He had too heavy a\nweight on his spirits to be light of heart, even had his nature been\ngiven to lightness. How could he even hope that the girl would resist\nall the temptation that would be thrown in her way, all the arguments\nthat would be used to her, the natural entreaties that would be\nshowered upon her from all her friends? Nor did he so think of\nhimself, as to believe that his own personal gifts would bind her to\nhim when opposed by those other personal gifts which he knew belonged\nto the lord. Measuring himself by his own standard, regarding that\nman to be most manly who could be most useful in the world, he did\nthink himself to be infinitely superior to the Earl. He was the\nworking bee, whereas the Earl was the drone. And he was one who used\nto the best of his abilities the mental faculties which had been\ngiven to him; whereas the Earl,--so he believed,--was himself hardly\nconscious of having had mental faculties bestowed upon him. The Earl\nwas, to his thinking, as were all earls, an excrescence upon society,\nwhich had been produced by the evil habits and tendencies of mankind;\na thing to be got rid of before any near approach could be made\nto that social perfection in the future coming of which he fully\nbelieved. But, though useless, the Earl was beautiful to the eye.\nThough purposeless, as regarded any true purpose of speech, his voice\nwas of silver and sweet to the ears. His hands, which could never\nhelp him to a morsel of bread, were soft to the touch. He was sweet\nwith perfumes and idleness, and never reeked of the sweat of labour.\nWas it possible that such a girl as Anna Lovel should resist the\npopinjay, backed as he would be by her own instincts and by the\nprayers of every one of her race? And then from time to time another\nthought would strike him. Using his judgment as best he might on her\nbehalf, ought he to wish that she should do so? The idleness of an\nearl might be bad, and equally bad the idleness of a countess. To be\nthe busy wife of a busy man, to be the mother of many children who\nshould be all taught to be busy on behalf of mankind, was, to his\nthinking, the highest lot of woman. But there was a question with him\nwhether the accidents of her birth and fortune had not removed her\nfrom the possibility of such joy as that. How would it be with her,\nand him too, if, in after life, she should rebuke him because he\nhad not allowed her to be the wife of a nobleman? And how would it\nbe with him if hereafter men said of him that he held her to an\noath extracted from her in her childhood because of her wealth? He\nhad been able to answer Mr. Flick on that head, but he had more\ndifficulty in answering himself.\n\nHe had written to his father after the Countess had left the house\nin which he lodged, and his father had answered him. The old man was\nnot much given to the writing of letters. \"About Lady Lovel and her\ndaughter,\" said he, \"I won't take no more trouble, nor shouldn't you.\nShe and you is different, and must be.\" And that was all he said.\nYes;--he and Lady Anna were different, and must remain so. Of a\nmorning, when he went fresh to his work, he would resolve that he\nwould send her word that she was entirely free from him, and would\nbid her do according to the nature of the Lovels. But in the evening,\nas he would wander back, slowly, all alone, tired of his work, tired\nof the black solitude of the life he was leading, longing for some\nsoftness to break the harsh monotony of his labour, he would remember\nall her prettinesses, and would, above all, remember the pretty oaths\nwith which she had sworn that she, Anna Lovel, loved him, Daniel\nThwaite, with all the woman's love which a woman could give. He\nwould remember the warm kiss which had seemed to make fresh for hours\nhis dry lips, and would try to believe that the bliss of which he\nhad thought so much might still be his own. Had she abandoned him,\nhad she assented to a marriage with the Earl, he would assuredly\nhave heard of it. He also knew well the day fixed for the trial,\nand understood the importance which would be attached to an early\nmarriage, should that be possible,--or at least to a public\ndeclaration of an engagement. At any rate she had not as yet been\nfalse to him.\n\nOne day he received at his place of work the following note;--\n\n\n   DEAR MR. THWAITE,\n\n   I wish to speak to you on most important business.\n   Could you call on me to-morrow at eight o'clock in the\n   evening,--here?\n\n   Yours very faithfully and always grateful,\n\n   J. LOVEL.\n\n\nAnd then the Countess had added her address in Keppel Street;--the\nvery address which, about a month back, she had refused to give him.\nOf course he went to the Countess,--fully believing that Lady Anna\nwould also be at the house, though believing also that he would not\nbe allowed to see her. But at this time Lady Anna was still staying\nwith Mrs. Bluestone in Bedford Square.\n\nIt was no doubt natural that every advantage should be taken of\nthe strong position which Lord Lovel held. When he had extracted a\npromise from Lady Anna that she would write to him at the end of a\nweek, he told Sir William, Sir William told his wife, Lady Patterson\ntold Mrs. Bluestone, and Mrs. Bluestone told the Countess. They\nwere all now in league against the tailor. If they could only get a\npromise from the girl before the cause came on,--anything that they\ncould even call a promise,--then the thing might be easy. United\ntogether they would not be afraid of what the Italian woman might do.\nAnd this undertaking to write to Lord Lovel was almost as good as a\npromise. When a girl once hesitates with a lover, she has as good\nas surrendered. To say even that she will think of it, is to accept\nthe man. Then Mrs. Bluestone and the Countess, putting their heads\ntogether, determined that an appeal should be made to the tailor. Had\nSir William or the Serjeant been consulted, either would have been\nprobably strong against the measure. But the ladies acted on their\nown judgment, and Daniel Thwaite presented himself in Keppel Street.\n\"It is very kind of you to come,\" said the Countess.\n\n\"There is no great kindness in that,\" said Daniel, thinking perhaps\nof those twenty years of service which had been given by him and by\nhis father.\n\n\"I know you think that I have been ungrateful for all that you have\ndone for me.\" He did think so, and was silent. \"But you would hardly\nwish me to repay you for helping me in my struggle by giving up all\nfor which I have struggled.\"\n\n\"I have asked for nothing, Lady Lovel.\"\n\n\"Have you not?\"\n\n\"I have asked you for nothing.\"\n\n\"But my daughter is all that I have in the world. Have you asked\nnothing of her?\"\n\n\"Yes, Lady Lovel. I have asked much from her, and she has given\nme all that I have asked. But I have asked nothing, and now claim\nnothing, as payment for service done. If Lady Anna thinks she is in\nmy debt after such fashion as that, I will soon make her free.\"\n\n\"She does think so, Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"Let her tell me so with her own lips.\"\n\n\"You will not think that I am lying to you.\"\n\n\"And yet men do lie, and women too, without remorse, when the stakes\nare high. I will believe no one but herself in this. Let her come\ndown and stand before me and look me in the face and tell me that it\nis so,--and I promise you that there shall be no further difficulty.\nI will not even ask to be alone with her. I will speak but a dozen\nwords to her, and you shall hear them.\"\n\n\"She is not here, Mr. Thwaite. She is not living in this house.\"\n\n\"Where is she then?\"\n\n\"She is staying with friends.\"\n\n\"With the Lovels,--in Yorkshire?\"\n\n\"I do not think that good can be done by my telling you where she\nis.\"\n\n\"Do you mean me to understand that she is engaged to the Earl?\"\n\n\"I tell you this,--that she acknowledges herself to be bound to you,\nbut bound to you simply by gratitude. It seems that there was a\npromise.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,--there was a promise, Lady Lovel; a promise as firmly spoken\nas when you told the late lord that you would be his wife.\"\n\n\"I know that there was a promise,--though I, her mother, living\nwith her at the time, had no dream of such wickedness. There was a\npromise, and by that she feels herself to be in some measure bound.\"\n\n\"She should do so,--if words can ever mean anything.\"\n\n\"I say she does,--but it is only by a feeling of gratitude. What;--is\nit probable that she should wish to mate so much below her degree,\nif she were now left to her own choice? Does it seem natural to you?\nShe loves the young Earl,--as why should she not? She has been thrown\ninto his company on purpose that she might learn to love him,--when\nno one knew of this horrid promise which had been exacted from her\nbefore she had seen any in the world from whom to choose.\"\n\n\"She has seen two now, him and me, and she can choose as she pleases.\nLet us both agree to take her at her word, and let us both be present\nwhen that word is spoken. If she goes to him and offers him her hand\nin my presence, I would not take it then though she were a princess,\nin lieu of being Lady Anna Lovel. Will he treat me as fairly? Will he\nbe as bold to abide by her choice?\"\n\n\"You can never marry her, Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"Why can I never marry her? Would not my ring be as binding on her\nfinger as his? Would not the parson's word make me and her one flesh\nand one bone as irretrievably as though I were ten times an earl? I\nam a man and she a woman. What law of God, or of man,--what law of\nnature can prevent us from being man and wife? I say that I can marry\nher,--and with her consent, I will.\"\n\n\"Never! You shall never live to call yourself the husband of my\ndaughter. I have striven and suffered,--as never woman strove and\nsuffered before, to give to my child the name and the rank which\nbelong to her. I did not do so that she might throw them away on such\na one as you. If you will deal honestly by us--\"\n\n\"I have dealt by you more than honestly.\"\n\n\"If you will at once free her from this thraldom in which you hold\nher, and allow her to act in accordance with the dictates of her own\nheart--\"\n\n\"That she shall do.\"\n\n\"If you will not hinder us in building up again the honour of the\nfamily, which was nigh ruined by the iniquities of my husband, we\nwill bless you.\"\n\n\"I want but one blessing, Lady Lovel.\"\n\n\"And in regard to her money--\"\n\n\"I do not expect you to believe me, Countess; but her money counts\nas nothing with me. If it becomes hers and she becomes my wife, as\nher husband I will protect it for her. But there shall be no dealing\nbetween you and me in regard to money.\"\n\n\"There is money due to your father, Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"If so, that can be paid when you come by your own. It was not lent\nfor the sake of a reward.\"\n\n\"And you will not liberate that poor girl from her thraldom.\"\n\n\"She can liberate herself if she will. I have told you what I will\ndo. Let her tell me to my face what she wishes.\"\n\n\"That she shall never do, Mr. Thwaite;--no, by heavens. It is not\nnecessary that she should have your consent to make such an alliance\nas her friends think proper for her. You have entangled her by a\npromise, foolish on her part, and very wicked on yours, and you\nmay work us much trouble. You may delay the settlement of all this\nquestion,--perhaps for years; and half ruin the estate by prolonged\nlawsuits; you may make it impossible for me to pay your father what\nI owe him till he, and I also, shall be no more; but you cannot, and\nshall not, have access to my daughter.\"\n\nDaniel Thwaite, as he returned home, tried to think it all over\ndispassionately. Was it as the Countess had represented? Was he\nacting the part of the dog in the manger, robbing others of happiness\nwithout the power of achieving his own? He loved the girl, and was\nhe making her miserable by his love? He was almost inclined to think\nthat the Countess had spoken truth in this respect.\n\n\nEND OF VOL.

The enclosure was open, and in the letter\naddressed to the Countess the tailor simply asked her to read and to\nsend on to her daughter that which he had written, adding that if she\nwould do so he would promise to abide by any answer which might come\nto him in Lady Anna's own handwriting. Daniel Thwaite when he made\nthis offer felt that he was giving up everything. Even though the\nwords might be written by the girl, they would be dictated by the\ngirl's mother, or by those lawyers who were now leagued together\nto force her into a marriage with the Earl. But it was right, he\nthought,--and upon the whole best for all parties,--that he should\ngive up everything. He could not bring himself to say so to the\nCountess or to any of those lawyers, when he was sent for and told\nthat because of the lowliness of his position a marriage between him\nand the highly born heiress was impossible. On such occasions he\nrevolted from the authority of those who endeavoured to extinguish\nhim. But, when alone, he could see at any rate as clearly as they\ndid, the difficulties which lay in his way. He also knew that there\nwas a great gulf fixed, as Miss Alice Bluestone had said,--though he\ndiffered from the young lady as to the side of the gulf on which lay\nheaven, and on which heaven's opposite. The letter to Lady Anna was\nas follows;--\n\n\n   MY DEAREST,\n\n   This letter if it reaches you at all will be given to you\n   by your mother, who will have read it. It is sent to her\n   open that she may see what I say to you. She sent for me\n   and I went to her this evening, and she told me that it\n   was impossible that I should ever be your husband. I was\n   so bold as to tell her ladyship that there could be no\n   impossibility. When you are of age you can walk out from\n   your mother's house and marry me, as can I you; and no one\n   can hinder us. There is nothing in the law, either of God\n   or man, that can prevent you from becoming my wife,--if it\n   be your wish to be so. But your mother also said that it\n   was not your wish, and she went on to say that were you\n   not bound to me by ties of gratitude you would willingly\n   marry your cousin, Lord Lovel. Then I offered to meet you\n   in the presence of your mother,--and in the presence too\n   of Lord Lovel,--and to ask you then before all of us to\n   which of us two your heart was given. And I promised that\n   if in my presence you would stretch out your right hand to\n   the Earl neither you nor your mother should be troubled\n   further by Daniel Thwaite. But her ladyship swore to me,\n   with an oath, that I should never be allowed to see you\n   again.\n\n   I therefore write to you, and bid you think much of what\n   I say to you before you answer me. You know well that I\n   love you. You do not suspect that I am trying to win you\n   because you are rich. You will remember that I loved you\n   when no one thought that you would be rich. I do love you\n   in my heart of hearts. I think of you in my dreams and\n   fancy then that all the world has become bright to me,\n   because we are walking together, hand-in-hand, where none\n   can come between to separate us. But I would not wish you\n   to be my wife, just because you have promised. If you do\n   not love me,--above all, if you love this other man,--say\n   so, and I will have done with it. Your mother says that\n   you are bound to me by gratitude. I do not wish you to be\n   my wife unless you are bound to me by love. Tell me then\n   how it is;--but, as you value my happiness and your own,\n   tell me the truth.\n\n   I will not say that I shall think well of you, if you have\n   been carried away by this young man's nobility. I would\n   have you give me a fair chance. Ask yourself what has\n   brought him as a lover to your feet. How it came to pass\n   that I was your lover you cannot but remember. But, for\n   you, it is your first duty not to marry a man unless you\n   love him. If you go to him because he can make you a\n   countess you will be vile indeed. If you go to him because\n   you find that he is in truth dearer to you than I am,\n   because you prefer his arm to mine, because he has wound\n   himself into your heart of hearts,--I shall think your\n   heart indeed hardly worth the having; but according to\n   your lights you will be doing right. In that case you\n   shall have no further word from me to trouble you.\n\n   But I desire that I may have an answer to this in your own\n   handwriting.\n\n   Your own sincere lover,\n\n   DANIEL THWAITE.\n\n\nIn composing and copying and recopying this letter the tailor sat up\nhalf the night, and then very early in the morning he himself carried\nit to Keppel Street, thus adding nearly three miles to his usual walk\nto Wigmore Street. The servant at the lodging-house was not up, and\ncould hardly be made to rise by the modest appeals which Daniel made\nto the bell; but at last the delivery was effected, and the forlorn\nlover hurried back to his work.\n\nThe Countess as she sat at breakfast read the letter over and over\nagain, and could not bring herself to decide whether it was right\nthat it should be given to her daughter. She had not yet seen Lady\nAnna since she had sent the poor offender away from the house in\nanger, and had more than once repeated her assurance through Mrs.\nBluestone that she would not do so till a promise had been given\nthat the tailor should be repudiated. Should she make this letter\nan excuse for going to the house in Bedford Square, and of seeing\nher child, towards whom her very bowels were yearning? At this time,\nthough she was a countess, with the prospect of great wealth, her\ncondition was not enviable. From morning to night she was alone,\nunless when she would sit for an hour in Mr. Goffe's office, or on\nthe rarer occasions of a visit to the chambers of Serjeant Bluestone.\nShe had no acquaintances in London whatever. She knew that she\nwas unfitted for London society even if it should be open to her.\nShe had spent her life in struggling with poverty and powerful\nenemies,--almost alone,--taking comfort in her happiest moments in\nthe strength and goodness of her old friend Thomas Thwaite. She now\nfound that those old days had been happier than these later days.\nHer girl had been with her and had been,--or had at any rate seemed\nto be,--true to her. She had something then to hope, something to\nexpect, some happiness of glory to which she could look forward.\nBut now she was beginning to learn,--nay had already learned, that\nthere was nothing for her to expect. Her rank was allowed to her.\nShe no longer suffered from want of money. Her cause was about to\ntriumph,--as the lawyers on both sides had seemed to say. But in\nwhat respect would the triumph be sweet to her? Even should her girl\nbecome the Countess Lovel, she would not be the less isolated. None\nof the Lovels wanted her society. She had banished her daughter to\nBedford Square, and the only effect of the banishment was that her\ndaughter was less miserable in Bedford Square than she would have\nbeen with her mother in Keppel Street.\n\nShe did not dare to act without advice, and therefore she took the\nletter to Mr. Goffe. Had it not been for a few words towards the end\nof the letter she would have sent it to her daughter at once. But the\nman had said that her girl would be vile indeed if she married the\nEarl for the sake of becoming a countess, and the widow of the late\nEarl did not like to put such doctrine into the hands of Lady Anna.\nIf she delivered the letter of course she would endeavour to dictate\nthe answer;--but her girl could be stubborn as her mother; and how\nwould it be with them if quite another letter should be written than\nthat which the Countess would have dictated?\n\nMr. Goffe read the letter and said that he would like to consider\nit for a day. The letter was left with Mr. Goffe, and Mr. Goffe\nconsulted the Serjeant. The Serjeant took the letter home to Mrs.\nBluestone, and then another consultation was held. It found its\nway to the very house in which the girl was living for whom it was\nintended, but was not at last allowed to reach her hand. \"It's a fine\nmanly letter,\" said the Serjeant.\n\n\"Then the less proper to give it to her,\" said Mrs. Bluestone, whose\nheart was all softness towards Lady Anna, but as hard as a millstone\ntowards the tailor.\n\n\"If she does like this young lord the best, why shouldn't she tell\nthe man the truth?\" said the Serjeant.\n\n\"Of course she likes the young lord the best,--as is natural.\"\n\n\"Then in God's name let her say so, and put an end to all this\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"You see, my dear, it isn't always easy to understand a girl's mind\nin such matters. I haven't a doubt which she likes best. She is not\nat all the girl to have a vitiated taste about young men. But you see\nthis other man came first, and had the advantage of being her only\nfriend at the time. She has felt very grateful to him, and as yet she\nis only beginning to learn the difference between gratitude and love.\nI don't at all agree with her mother as to being severe with her.\nI can't bear severity to young people, who ought to be made happy.\nBut I am quite sure that this tailor should be kept away from her\naltogether. She must not see him or his handwriting. What would she\nsay to herself if she got that letter? 'If he is generous, I can be\ngenerous too;' and if she ever wrote him a letter, pledging herself\nto him, all would be over. As it is, she has promised to write to\nLord Lovel. We will hold her to that; and then, when she has given\na sort of a promise to the Earl, we will take care that the tailor\nshall know it. It will be best for all parties. What we have got to\ndo is to save her from this man, who has been both her best friend\nand her worst enemy.\" Mrs. Bluestone was an excellent woman, and\nin this emergency was endeavouring to do her duty at considerable\ntrouble to herself and with no hope of any reward. The future\nCountess when she should become a Countess would be nothing to her.\nShe was a good woman;--but she did not care what evil she inflicted\non the tailor, in her endeavours to befriend the daughter of the\nCountess.\n\nThe tailor's letter, unseen and undreamt of by Lady Anna, was sent\nback through the Serjeant and Mr. Goffe to Lady Lovel, with strong\nadvice from Mr. Goffe that Lady Anna should not be allowed to see\nit. \"I don't hesitate to tell you, Lady Lovel, that I have consulted\nthe Serjeant, and that we are both of opinion that no intercourse\nwhatever should be permitted between Lady Anna Lovel and Mr. Daniel\nThwaite.\" The unfortunate letter was therefore sent back to the\nwriter with the following note;--\"The Countess Lovel presents her\ncompliments to Mr. Daniel Thwaite, and thinks it best to return the\nenclosed. The Countess is of opinion that no intercourse whatever\nshould take place between her daughter and Mr. Daniel Thwaite.\"\n\nThen Daniel swore an oath to himself that the intercourse between\nthem should not thus be made to cease. He had acted as he thought\nnot only fairly but very honourably. Nay;--he was by no means sure\nthat that which had been intended for fairness and honour might not\nhave been sheer simplicity. He had purposely abstained from any\nclandestine communication with the girl he loved,--even though she\nwas one to whom he had had access all his life, with whom he had\nbeen allowed to grow up together;--who had eaten of his bread and\ndrank of his cup. Now her new friends,--and his own old friend the\nCountess,--would keep no measures with him. There was to be no\nintercourse whatever! But, by the God of heaven, there should be\nintercourse!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nTHE KESWICK POET.\n\n\nInfinite difficulties were now complicating themselves on the head of\npoor Daniel Thwaite. The packet which the Countess addressed to him\ndid not reach him in London, but was forwarded after him down to\nCumberland, whither he had hurried on receipt of news from Keswick\nthat his father was like to die. The old man had fallen in a fit, and\nwhen the message was sent it was not thought likely that he would\never see his son again. Daniel went down to the north as quickly as\nhis means would allow him, going by steamer to Whitehaven, and thence\nby coach to Keswick. His entire wages were but thirty-five shillings\na week, and on that he could not afford to travel by the mail to\nKeswick. But he did reach home in time to see his father alive, and\nto stand by the bedside when the old man died.\n\nThough there was not time for many words between them, and though\nthe apathy of coming death had already clouded the mind of Thomas\nThwaite, so that he, for the most part, disregarded,--as dying men do\ndisregard,--those things which had been fullest of interest to him;\nstill something was said about the Countess and Lady Anna. \"Just\ndon't mind them any further, Dan,\" said the father.\n\n\"Indeed that will be best,\" said Daniel.\n\n\"Yes, in truth. What can they be to the likes o' you? Give me a drop\nof brandy, Dan.\" The drop of brandy was more to him now than the\nCountess; but though he thought but little of this last word, his son\nthought much of it. What could such as the Countess and her titled\ndaughter be to him, Daniel Thwaite, the broken tailor? For, in truth,\nhis father was dying, a broken man. There was as much owed by him\nin Keswick as all the remaining property would pay; and as for the\nbusiness, it had come to that, that the business was not worth\npreserving.\n\nThe old tailor died and was buried, and all Keswick knew that he had\nleft nothing behind him, except the debt that was due to him by the\nCountess, as to which, opinion in the world of Keswick varied very\nmuch. There were those who said that the two Thwaites, father and\nson, had known very well on which side their bread was buttered,\nand that Daniel Thwaite would now, at his father's death, become\nthe owner of bonds to a vast amount on the Lovel property. It was\ngenerally understood in Keswick that the Earl's claim was to be\nabandoned, that the rights of the Countess and her daughter were to\nbe acknowledged, and that the Earl and his cousin were to become man\nand wife. If so the bonds would be paid, and Daniel Thwaite would\nbecome a rich man. Such was the creed of those who believed in the\ndebt. But there were others who did not believe in the existence\nof any such bonds, and who ridiculed the idea of advances of money\nhaving been made. The old tailor had, no doubt, relieved the\nimmediate wants of the Countess by giving her shelter and food, and\nhad wasted his substance in making journeys, and neglecting his\nbusiness; but that was supposed to be all. For such services on\nbehalf of the father, it was not probable that much money would be\npaid to the son; and the less so, as it was known in Keswick that\nDaniel Thwaite had quarrelled with the Countess. As this latter\nopinion preponderated Daniel did not find that he was treated with\nany marked respect in his native town.\n\nThe old man did leave a will;--a very simple document, by which\neverything that he had was left to his son. And there was this\nparagraph in it; \"I expect that the Countess Lovel will repay to my\nson Daniel all moneys that I have advanced on her behalf.\" As for\nbonds,--or any single bond,--Daniel could find none. There was an\naccount of certain small items due by the Countess, of long date,\nand there was her ladyship's receipt for a sum of \u00c2\u00a3500, which had\napparently been lent at the time of the trial for bigamy. Beyond this\nhe could find no record of any details whatever, and it seemed to him\nthat his claim was reduced to something less than \u00c2\u00a3600. Nevertheless,\nhe had understood from his father that the whole of the old man's\nsavings had been spent on behalf of the two ladies, and he believed\nthat some time since he had heard a sum named exceeding \u00c2\u00a36,000. In\nhis difficulty he asked a local attorney, and the attorney advised\nhim to throw himself on the generosity of the Countess. He paid the\nattorney some small fee, and made up his mind at once that he would\nnot take the lawyer's advice. He would not throw himself on the\ngenerosity of the Countess.\n\nThere was then still living in that neighbourhood a great man, a\npoet, who had nearly carried to its close a life of great honour\nand of many afflictions. He was one who, in these, his latter days,\neschewed all society, and cared to see no faces but those of the\nsurviving few whom he had loved in early life. And as those few\nsurvivors lived far away, and as he was but little given to move from\nhome, his life was that of a recluse. Of the inhabitants of the place\naround him, who for the most part had congregated there since he had\ncome among them, he saw but little, and his neighbours said that he\nwas sullen and melancholic. But, according to their degrees, he had\nbeen a friend to Thomas Thwaite, and now, in his emergency, the son\ncalled upon the poet. Indifferent visitors, who might be and often\nwere intruders, were but seldom admitted at that modest gate; but\nDaniel Thwaite was at once shown into the presence of the man of\nletters. They had not seen each other since Daniel was a youth, and\nneither would have known the other. The poet was hardly yet an old\nman, but he had all the characteristics of age. His shoulders were\nbent, and his eyes were deep set in his head, and his lips were thin\nand fast closed. But the beautiful oval of his face was still there,\nin spite of the ravages of years, of labours, and of sorrow; and the\nspecial brightness of his eye had not yet been dimmed. \"I have been\nsorry, Mr. Thwaite, to hear of your father's death,\" said the poet.\n\"I knew him well, but it was some years since, and I valued him as a\nman of singular probity and spirit.\" Then Daniel craved permission\nto tell his story;--and he told it all from the beginning to the\nend,--how his father and he had worked for the Countess and her girl,\nhow their time and then their money had been spent for her; how he\nhad learned to love the girl, and how, as he believed, the girl had\nloved him. And he told with absolute truth the whole story, as far\nas he knew it, of what had been done in London during the last nine\nmonths. He exaggerated nothing, and did not scruple to speak openly\nof his own hopes. He showed his letter to the Countess, and her note\nto him, and while doing so hid none of his own feelings. Did the poet\nthink that there was any reason why, in such circumstances, a tailor\nshould not marry the daughter of a Countess? And then he gave, as far\nas he knew it, the history of the money that had been advanced, and\nproduced a copy of his father's will. \"And now, sir, what would you\nhave me do?\"\n\n\"When you first spoke to the girl of love, should you not have spoken\nto the mother also, Mr. Thwaite?\"\n\n\"Would you, sir, have done so?\"\n\n\"I will not say that;--but I think that I ought. Her girl was all\nthat she had.\"\n\n\"It may be that I was wrong. But if the girl loves me now--\"\n\n\"I would not hurt your feelings for the world, Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"Do not spare them, sir. I did not come to you that soft things might\nbe said to me.\"\n\n\"I do not think it of your father's son. Seeing what is your own\ndegree in life and what is theirs, that they are noble and of an old\nnobility, among the few hot-house plants of the nation, and that you\nare one of the people,--a blade of corn out of the open field, if I\nmay say so,--born to eat your bread in the sweat of your brow, can\nyou think that such a marriage would be other than distressing to\nthem?\"\n\n\"Is the hot-house plant stronger or better, or of higher use, than\nthe ear of corn?\"\n\n\"Have I said that it was, my friend? I will not say that either is\nhigher in God's sight than the other, or better, or of a nobler use.\nBut they are different; and though the differences may verge together\nwithout evil when the limits are near, I do not believe in graftings\nso violent as this.\"\n\n\"You mean, sir, that one so low as a tailor should not seek to marry\nso infinitely above himself as with the daughter of an Earl.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Thwaite, that is what I mean; though I hope that in coming\nto me you knew me well enough to be sure that I would not willingly\noffend you.\"\n\n\"There is no offence;--there can be no offence. I am a tailor, and am\nin no sort ashamed of my trade. But I did not think, sir, that you\nbelieved in lords so absolutely as that.\"\n\n\"I believe but in one Lord,\" said the poet. \"In Him who, in His\nwisdom and for His own purposes, made men of different degrees.\"\n\n\"Has it been His doing, sir,--or the devil's?\"\n\n\"Nay, I will not discuss with you a question such as that. I will not\nat any rate discuss it now.\"\n\n\"I have read, sir, in your earlier books--\"\n\n\"Do not quote my books to me, either early or late. You ask me for\nadvice, and I give it according to my ability. The time may come too,\nMr. Thwaite,\"--and this he said laughing,--\"when you also will be\nless hot in your abhorrence of a nobility than you are now.\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n\"Ah;--'tis so that young men always make assurances to themselves of\ntheir own present wisdom.\"\n\n\"You think then that I should give her up entirely?\"\n\n\"I would leave her to herself, and to her mother,--and to this young\nlord, if he be her lover.\"\n\n\"But if she loves me! Oh, sir, she did love me once. If she loves me,\nshould I leave her to think, as time goes on, that I have forgotten\nher? What chance can she have if I do not interfere to let her know\nthat I am true to her?\"\n\n\"She will have the chance of becoming Lady Lovel, and of loving her\nhusband.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, you do not believe in vows of love?\"\n\n\"How am I to answer that?\" said the poet. \"Surely I do believe in\nvows of love. I have written much of love, and have ever meant to\nwrite the truth, as I knew it, or thought that I knew it. But the\nlove of which we poets sing is not the love of the outer world. It\nis more ecstatic, but far less serviceable. It is the picture of\nthat which exists, but grand with imaginary attributes, as are the\nportraits of ladies painted by artists who have thought rather of\ntheir art than of their models. We tell of a constancy in love which\nis hardly compatible with the usages of this as yet imperfect world.\nLook abroad, and see whether girls do not love twice, and young men\nthrice. They come together, and rub their feathers like birds, and\nfancy that each has found in the other an eternity of weal or woe.\nThen come the causes of their parting. Their fathers perhaps are\nCapulets and Montagues, but their children, God be thanked, are\nnot Romeos and Juliets. Or money does not serve, or distance\nintervenes, or simply a new face has the poor merit of novelty.\nThe constancy of which the poets sing is the unreal,--I may almost\nsay the unnecessary,--constancy of a Juliet. The constancy on\nwhich our nature should pride itself is that of an Imogen. You read\nShakespeare, I hope, Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"I know the plays you quote, sir. Imogen was a king's daughter, and\nmarried a simple gentleman.\"\n\n\"I would not say that early vows should mean nothing,\" continued the\npoet, unwilling to take notice of the point made against him. \"I like\nto hear that a girl has been true to her first kiss. But this girl\nwill have the warrant of all the world to justify a second choice.\nAnd can you think that because your company was pleasant to her here\namong your native mountains, when she knew none but you, that she\nwill be indifferent to the charms of such a one as you tell me this\nLord Lovel is? She will have regrets,--remorse even; she will sorrow,\nbecause she knows that you have been good to her. But she will yield,\nand her life will be happier with him,--unless he be a bad man, which\nI do not know,--than it would be with you. Would there be no regrets,\nthink you, no remorse, when she found that as your wife she had\nseparated herself from all that she had been taught to regard as\ndelightful in this world? Would she be happy in quarrelling with her\nmother and her new-found relatives? You think little of noble blood,\nand perhaps I think as little of it in matters relating to myself.\nBut she is noble, and she will think of it. As for your money,\nMr. Thwaite, I should make it a matter of mere business with the\nCountess, as though there was no question relating to her daughter.\nShe probably has an account of the money, and doubtless will pay you\nwhen she has means at her disposal.\"\n\nDaniel left his Mentor without another word on his own behalf,\nexpressing thanks for the counsel that had been given to him, and\nassuring the poet that he would endeavour to profit by it. Then he\nwalked away, over the very paths on which he had been accustomed to\nstray with Anna Lovel, and endeavoured to digest the words that he\nhad heard. He could not bring himself to see their truth. That he\nshould not force the girl to marry him, if she loved another better\nthan she loved him, simply by the strength of her own obligation to\nhim, he could understand. But that it was natural that she should\ntransfer to another the affection that she had once bestowed upon\nhim, because that other was a lord, he would not allow. Not only\nhis heart but all his intellect rebelled against such a decision. A\ntransfer so violent would, he thought, show that she was incapable\nof loving. And yet this doctrine had come to him from one who, as he\nhimself had said, had written much of love.\n\nBut, though he argued after this fashion with himself, the words of\nthe old poet had had their efficacy. Whether the fault might be with\nthe girl, or with himself, or with the untoward circumstances of the\ncase, he determined to teach himself that he had lost her. He would\nnever love another woman. Though the Earl's daughter could not be\ntrue to him, he, the suitor, would be true to the Earl's daughter.\nThere might no longer be Romeos among the noble Capulets and the\nnoble Montagues,--whom indeed he believed to be dead to faith; but\nthe salt of truth had not therefore perished from the world. He\nwould get what he could from this wretched wreck of his father's\nproperty,--obtain payment if it might be possible of that poor \u00c2\u00a3500\nfor which he held the receipt,--and then go to some distant land in\nwhich the wisest of counsellors would not counsel him that he was\nunfit because of his trade to mate himself with noble blood.\n\nWhen he had proved his father's will he sent a copy of it up to the\nCountess with the following letter;--\n\n\n   Keswick, November 4, 183--.\n\n   MY LADY,\n\n   I do not know whether your ladyship will yet have heard\n   of my father's death. He died here on the 24th of last\n   month. He was taken with apoplexy on the 15th, and never\n   recovered from the fit. I think you will be sorry for him.\n\n   I find myself bound to send your ladyship a copy of his\n   will. Your ladyship perhaps may have some account of what\n   money has passed between you and him. I have none except a\n   receipt for \u00c2\u00a3500 given to you by him many years ago. There\n   is also a bill against your ladyship for \u00c2\u00a371 18_s._ 9_d._\n   It may be that no more is due than this, but you will\n   know. I shall be happy to hear from your ladyship on the\n   subject, and am,\n\n   Yours respectfully,\n\n   DANIEL THWAITE.\n\n\nBut he still was resolved that before he departed for the far western\nland he would obtain from Anna Lovel herself an expression of her\ndetermination to renounce him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nLADY ANNA'S LETTER.\n\n\nIn the mean time the week had gone round, and Lady Anna's letter to\nthe Earl had not yet been written. An army was arrayed against the\ngirl to induce her to write such a letter as might make it almost\nimpossible for her afterwards to deny that she was engaged to the\nlord, but the army had not as yet succeeded. The Countess had not\nseen her daughter,--had been persistent in her refusal to let her\ndaughter come to her till she had at any rate repudiated her other\nsuitor; but she had written a strongly worded but short letter,\nurging it as a great duty that Lady Anna Lovel was bound to support\nher family and to defend her rank. Mrs. Bluestone, from day to day,\nwith soft loving words taught the same lesson. Alice Bluestone in\ntheir daily conversations spoke of the tailor, or rather of this\npromise to the tailor, with a horror which at any rate was not\naffected. The Serjeant, almost with tears in his eyes, implored her\nto put an end to the lawsuit. Even the Solicitor-General sent her\ntender messages,--expressing his great hope that she might enable\nthem to have this matter adjusted early in November. All the details\nof the case as it now stood had been explained to her over and over\nagain. If, when the day fixed for the trial should come round, it\ncould be said that she and the young Earl were engaged to each\nother, the Earl would altogether abandon his claim,--and no further\nstatement would be made. The fact of the marriage in Cumberland would\nthen be proved,--the circumstances of the trial for bigamy would be\ngiven in evidence,--and all the persons concerned would be together\nanxious that the demands of the two ladies should be admitted in\nfull. It was the opinion of the united lawyers that were this done,\nthe rank of the Countess would be allowed, and that the property left\nbehind him by the old lord would be at once given up to those who\nwould inherit it under the order of things as thus established. The\nCountess would receive that to which she would be entitled as widow,\nthe daughter would be the heir-at-law to the bulk of the personal\nproperty, and the Earl would merely claim any real estate, if,--as\nwas very doubtful,--any real estate had been left in question. In\nthis case the disposition of the property would be just what they\nwould all desire, and the question of rank would be settled for\never. But if the young lady should not have then agreed to this very\npleasant compromise, the Earl indeed would make no further endeavours\nto invalidate the Cumberland marriage, and would retire from the\nsuit. But it would then be stated that there was a claimant in\nSicily,--or at least evidence in Italy, which if sifted might\npossibly bar the claim of the Countess. The Solicitor-General did\nnot hesitate to say that he believed the living woman to be a weak\nimpostor, who had been first used by the Earl and had then put\nforward a falsehood to get an income out of the property; but he was\nby no means convinced that the other foreign woman, whom the Earl had\nundoubtedly made his first wife, might not have been alive when the\nsecond marriage was contracted. If it were so, the Countess would\nbe no Countess, Anna Lovel would simply be Anna Murray, penniless,\nbaseborn, and a fit wife for the tailor, should the tailor think fit\nto take her. \"If it be so,\" said Lady Anna through her tears, \"let it\nbe so; and he will take me.\"\n\nIt may have been that the army was too strong for its own\npurpose,--too much of an army to gain a victory on that field,--that\na weaker combination of forces would have prevailed when all this\narray failed. No one had a word to say for the tailor; no one\nadmitted that he had been a generous friend; no feeling was expressed\nfor him. It seemed to be taken for granted that he, from the\nbeginning, had laid his plans for obtaining possession of an enormous\nincome in the event of the Countess being proved to be a Countess.\nThere was no admission that he had done aught for love. Now, in all\nthese matters, Lady Anna was sure of but one thing alone, and that\nwas of the tailor's truth. Had they acknowledged that he was good and\nnoble, they might perhaps have persuaded her,--as the poet had almost\npersuaded her lover,--that the fitness of things demanded that they\nshould be separated.\n\nBut she had promised that she would write the letter by the end of\nthe week, and when the end of a fortnight had come she knew that\nit must be written. She had declared over and over again to Mrs.\nBluestone that she must go away from Bedford Square. She could not\nlive there always, she said. She knew that she was in the way of\neverybody. Why should she not go back to her own mother? \"Does\nmamma mean to say that I am never to live with her any more?\" Mrs.\nBluestone promised that if she would write her letter and tell her\ncousin that she would try to love him, she should go back to her\nmother at once. \"But I cannot live here always,\" persisted Lady Anna.\nMrs. Bluestone would not admit that there was any reason why her\nvisitor should not continue to live in Bedford Square as long as the\narrangement suited Lady Lovel.\n\nVarious letters were written for her. The Countess wrote one which\nwas an unqualified acceptance of the Earl's offer, and which was\nvery short. Alice Bluestone wrote one which was full of poetry. Mrs.\nBluestone wrote a third, in which a great many ambiguous words were\nused,--in which there was no definite promise, and no poetry. But\nhad this letter been sent it would have been almost impossible for\nthe girl afterwards to extricate herself from its obligations.\nThe Serjeant, perhaps, had lent a word or two, for the letter was\nundoubtedly very clever. In this letter Lady Anna was made to say\nthat she would always have the greatest pleasure in receiving her\ncousin's visits, and that she trusted that she might be able to\nco-operate with her cousins in bringing the lawsuit to a close;--that\nshe certainly would not marry any one without her mother's consent,\nbut that she did not find herself able at the present to say more\nthan that. \"It won't stop the Solicitor-General, you know,\" the\nSerjeant had remarked, as he read it. \"Bother the Solicitor-General!\"\nMrs. Bluestone had answered, and had then gone on to show that it\nwould lead to that which would stop the learned gentleman. The\nSerjeant had added a word or two, and great persuasion was used to\ninduce Lady Anna to use this epistle.\n\nBut she would have none of it. \"Oh, I couldn't, Mrs. Bluestone;--he\nwould know that I hadn't written all that.\"\n\n\"You have promised to write, and you are bound to keep your promise,\"\nsaid Mrs. Bluestone.\n\n\"I believe I am bound to keep all my promises,\" said Lady Anna,\nthinking of those which she had made to Daniel Thwaite.\n\nBut at last she sat down and did write a letter for herself,\nspecially premising that no one should see it. When she had made her\npromise, she certainly had not intended to write that which should be\nshown to all the world. Mrs. Bluestone had begged that at any rate\nthe Countess might see it. \"If mamma will let me go to her, of course\nI will show it her,\" said Lady Anna. At last it was thought best to\nallow her to write her own letter and to send it unseen. After many\nstruggles and with many tears she wrote her letter as follows;--\n\n\n   Bedford Square, Tuesday.\n\n   MY DEAR COUSIN,\n\n   I am sorry that I have been so long in doing what I said\n   I would do. I don't think I ought to have promised, for I\n   find it very difficult to say anything, and I think that\n   it is wrong that I should write at all. It is not my fault\n   that there should be a lawsuit. I do not want to take\n   anything away from anybody, or to get anything for myself.\n   I think papa was very wicked when he said that mamma was\n   not his wife, and of course I wish it may all go as she\n   wishes. But I don't think anybody ought to ask me to do\n   what I feel to be wrong.\n\n   Mr. Daniel Thwaite is not at all such a person as they\n   say. He and his father have been mamma's best friends, and\n   I shall never forget that. Old Mr. Thwaite is dead, and I\n   am very sorry to hear it. If you had known them as we did\n   you would understand what I feel. Of course he is not your\n   friend; but he is my friend, and I dare say that makes me\n   unfit to be friends with you. You are a nobleman and he\n   is a tradesman; but when we knew him first he was quite\n   as good as we, and I believe we owe him a great deal of\n   money, which mamma can't pay him. I have heard mamma say\n   before she was angry with him, that she would have been in\n   the workhouse, but for them, and that Mr. Daniel Thwaite\n   might now be very well off, and not a working tailor at\n   all as Mrs. Bluestone calls him, if they hadn't given all\n   they had to help us. I cannot bear after that to hear them\n   speak of him as they do.\n\n   Of course I should like to do what mamma wants; but how\n   would you feel if you had promised somebody else? I do so\n   wish that all this might be stopped altogether. My dear\n   mamma will not allow me to see her; and though everybody\n   is very kind, I feel that I ought not to be here with Mrs.\n   Bluestone. Mamma talked of going abroad somewhere. I wish\n   she would, and take me away. I should see nobody then, and\n   there would be no trouble. But I suppose she hasn't got\n   enough money. This is a very poor letter, but I do not\n   know what else I can say.\n\n   Believe me to be,\n   My dear cousin,\n   Yours affectionately,\n\n   ANNA LOVEL.\n\n\nThen came, in a postscript, the one thing that she had to say,--\"I\nthink that I ought to be allowed to see Mr. Daniel Thwaite.\"\n\nLord Lovel after receiving this letter called in Bedford Square and\nsaw Mrs. Bluestone,--but he did not show the letter. His cousin was\nout with the girls and he did not wait to see her. He merely said\nthat he had received a letter which had not given him much comfort.\n\"But I shall answer it,\" he said,--and the reader who has seen the\none letter shall see also the other.\n\n\n   Brown's Hotel, Albemarle Street,\n   4th November, 183--.\n\n   DEAREST ANNA,\n\n   I have received your letter and am obliged to you for it,\n   though there is so little in it to flatter or to satisfy\n   me. I will begin by assuring you that, as far as I am\n   concerned, I do not wish to keep you from seeing Mr.\n   Daniel Thwaite. I believe in my heart of hearts that if\n   you were now to see him often you would feel aware that\n   a union between you and him could not make either of you\n   happy. You do not even say that you think it would do so.\n\n   You defend him, as though I had accused him. I grant all\n   that you say in his favour. I do not doubt that his father\n   behaved to you and to your mother with true friendship.\n   But that will not make him fit to be the husband of Anna\n   Lovel. You do not even say that you think that he would be\n   fit. I fancy I understand it all, and I love you better\n   for the pride with which you cling to so firm a friend.\n\n   But, dearest, it is different when we talk of marriage. I\n   imagine that you hardly dare now to think of becoming his\n   wife. I doubt whether you say even to yourself that you\n   love him with that kind of love. Do not suppose me vain\n   enough to believe that therefore you must love me. It is\n   not that. But if you would once tell yourself that he is\n   unfit to be your husband, then you might come to love me,\n   and would not be the less willing to do so, because all\n   your friends wish it. It must be something to you that you\n   should be able to put an end to all this trouble.\n\n   Yours, dearest Anna,\n   Most affectionately,\n\n   L.\n\n   I called in Bedford Square this morning, but you were not\n   at home!\n\n\n\"But I do dare,\" she said to herself, when she had read the letter.\n\"Why should I not dare? And I do say to myself that I love him.\nWhy should I not love him now, when I was not ashamed to love him\nbefore?\" She was being persecuted; and as the step of the wayfarer\nbrings out the sweet scent of the herb which he crushes with his\nheel, so did persecution with her extract from her heart that\nstrength of character which had hitherto been latent. Had they left\nher at Yoxham, and said never a word to her about the tailor; had the\nrector and the two aunts showered soft courtesies on her head,--they\nmight have vanquished her. But now the spirit of opposition was\nstronger within her than ever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nLOVEL V. MURRAY AND ANOTHER.\n\n\nMonday, the 9th of November, was the day set down for the trial of\nthe case which had assumed the name of \"Lovel versus Murray and\nAnother.\" This denomination had been adopted many months ago, when it\nhad been held to be practicable by the Lovel party to prove that the\nlady who was now always called the Countess, was not entitled to bear\nthe name of Lovel, but was simply Josephine Murray, and her daughter\nsimply Anna Murray. Had there been another wife alive when the\nmother was married that name and that name only could have been hers,\nwhether she had been the victim of the old Earl's fraud,--or had\nherself been a party to it. The reader will have understood that\nas the case went on the opinions of those who acted for the young\nEarl, and more especially the opinion of the young Earl himself, had\nbeen changed. Prompted to do so by various motives, they, who had\nundertaken to prove that the Countess was no Countess, had freely\naccorded to her her title, and had themselves entertained her\ndaughter with all due acknowledgment of rank and birth. Nevertheless\nthe name of the case remained and had become common in people's\nmouths. The very persons who would always speak of the Countess Lovel\nspoke also very familiarly of the coming trial in \"Lovel v. Murray,\"\nand now the 9th of November had come round and the case of \"Lovel v.\nMurray and Another\" was to be tried. The nature of the case was\nthis. The two ladies, mother and daughter, had claimed the personal\nproperty of the late lord as his widow and daughter. Against that\nclaim Earl Lovel made his claim, as heir-at-law, alleging that there\nwas no widow, and no legitimate child. The case had become infinitely\ncomplicated by the alleged existence of the first wife,--in which\ncase she as widow would have inherited. But still the case went on\nas Lovel v. Murray,--the Lovel so named being the Earl, and not the\nalleged Italian widow.\n\nSuch being the question presumably at issue, it became the duty of\nthe Solicitor-General to open the pleadings. In the ordinary course\nof proceeding it would have been his task to begin by explaining\nthe state of the family, and by assuming that he could prove the\nformer marriage and the existence of the former wife at the time\nof the latter marriage. His evidence would have been subject to\ncross-examination, and then another counter-statement would have been\nmade on behalf of the Countess, and her witnesses would have been\nbrought forward. When all this had been done the judge would have\ncharged the jury, and with the jury would have rested the decision.\nThis would have taken many days, and all the joys and sorrows, all\nthe mingled hopes and anxieties of a long trial had been expected.\nBets had been freely made, odds being given at first on behalf of\nLord Lovel, and afterwards odds on behalf of the Countess. Interest\nhad been made to get places in the court, and the clubs had resounded\nnow with this fact and now with that which had just been brought home\nfrom Sicily as certain. Then had come suddenly upon the world the\ntidings that there would absolutely be no trial, that the great case\nof \"Lovel v. Murray and Another\" was to be set at rest for ever by\nthe marriage of \"Lovel\" with \"Another,\" and by the acceptance by\n\"Lovel\" of \"Murray\" as his mother-in-law. But the quidnuncs would\nnot accept this solution. No doubt Lord Lovel might marry the second\nparty in the defence, and it was admitted on all hands that he\nprobably would do so;--but that would not stop the case. If there\nwere an Italian widow living, that widow was the heir to the\nproperty. Another Lovel would take the place of Lord Lovel,--and the\ncause of Lovel v. Murray must still be continued. The first marriage\ncould not be annulled, simply by the fact that it would suit the\nyoung Earl that it should be annulled. Then, while this dispute was\nin progress, it was told at all the clubs that there was to be no\nmarriage,--that the girl had got herself engaged to a tailor, and\nthat the tailor's mastery over her was so strong that she did not\ndare to shake him off. Dreadful things were told about the tailor and\npoor Lady Anna. There had been a secret marriage; there was going to\nbe a child;--the latter fact was known as a certain fact to a great\nmany men at the clubs;--the tailor had made everything safe in twenty\ndifferent ways. He was powerful over the girl equally by love, by\nfear, and by written bond. The Countess had repelled her daughter\nfrom her house by turning her out into the street by night, and had\nthreatened both murder and suicide. Half the fortune had been offered\nto the tailor, in vain. The romance of the story had increased\ngreatly during the last few days preceding the trial,--but it was\nadmitted by all that the trial as a trial would be nothing. There\nwould probably be simply an adjournment.\n\nIt would be hard to say how the story of the tailor leaked out, and\nbecame at last public and notorious. It had been agreed among all the\nlawyers that it should be kept secret,--but it may perhaps have been\nfrom some one attached to them that it was first told abroad. No\ndoubt all Norton and Flick knew it, and all Goffe and Goffe. Mr.\nMainsail and his clerk, Mr. Hardy and his clerk, Serjeant Bluestone\nand his clerk, all knew it; but they had all promised secrecy. The\nclerk of the Solicitor-General was of course beyond suspicion. The\ntwo Miss Bluestones had known the story, but they had solemnly\nundertaken to be silent as the grave. Mrs. Bluestone was a lady with\nmost intimately confidential friends,--but she was sworn to secrecy.\nIt might have come from Sarah, the lady's-maid, whom the Countess\nhad unfortunately attached to her daughter when the first gleam of\nprosperity had come upon them.\n\nAmong the last who heard the story of the tailor,--the last of any\nwho professed the slightest interest in the events of the Lovel\nfamily,--were the Lovels of Yoxham. The Earl had told them nothing.\nIn answer to his aunt's letters, and then in answer to a very urgent\nappeal from his uncle, the young nobleman had sent only the most curt\nand most ambiguous replies. When there was really something to tell\nhe would tell everything, but at present he could only say that he\nhoped that everything would be well. That had been the extent of the\ninformation given by the Earl to his relations, and the rector had\nwaxed wrathful. Nor was his wrath lessened, or the sorrow of the\ntwo aunts mitigated, when the truth reached them by the mouth of\nthat very Lady Fitzwarren who had been made to walk out of the room\nafter--Anna Murray, as Lady Fitzwarren persisted in calling the\n\"young person\" after she had heard the story of the tailor. She told\nthe story at Yoxham parsonage to the two aunts, and brought with her\na printed paragraph from a newspaper to prove the truth of it. As it\nis necessary that we should now hurry into the court to hear what\nthe Solicitor-General had to say about the case, we cannot stop to\nsympathize with the grief of the Lovels at Yoxham. We may, however,\npause for a moment to tell the burden of the poor rector's song for\nthat evening. \"I knew how it would be from the beginning. I told you\nso. I was sure of it. But nobody would believe me.\"\n\nThe Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster was crowded on the 9th of\nNovember. The case was to be heard before the Lord Chief Justice,\nand it was known that at any rate Sir William Patterson would have\nsomething to tell. If nothing else came of it, the telling of that\nstory would be worth the hearing. All the preliminaries of the trial\nwent on, as though every one believed that it was to be carried\nthrough to the bitter end,--as though evidence were to be adduced and\nrebutted, and further contradicted by other evidence, which would\nagain be rebutted with that pleasing animosity between rival lawyers,\nwhich is so gratifying to the outside world, and apparently to\nthemselves also. The jurors were sworn in,--a special jury,--and long\nwas the time taken, and many the threats made by the Chief Justice,\nbefore twelve gentlemen would consent to go into the box. Crowds were\nround the doors of the court, of which every individual man would\nhave paid largely for standing-room to hear the trial; but when they\nwere wanted for use, men would not come forward to accept a seat,\nwith all that honour which belongs to a special juryman. And yet it\nwas supposed that at last there would be no question to submit to a\njury.\n\nAbout noon the Solicitor began his statement. He was full of smiles\nand nods and pleasant talk, gestures indicative of a man who had\na piece of work before him in which he could take delight. It is\nalways satisfactory to see the assurance of a cock crowing in his own\nfarm-yard, and to admire his easy familiarity with things that are\nawful to a stranger bird. If you, O reader, or I were bound to stand\nup in that court, dressed in wig and gown, and to tell a story that\nwould take six hours in the telling, the one or the other of us\nknowing it to be his special duty so to tell it that judge, and\ncounsellors, and jury, should all catch clearly every point that was\nto be made,--how ill would that story be told, how would those points\nescape the memory of the teller, and never come near the intellect of\nthe hearers! And how would the knowledge that it would be so, confuse\nyour tongue or mine,--and make exquisitely miserable that moment of\nrising before the audience! But our Solicitor-General rose to his\nlegs a happy man, with all that grace of motion, that easy slowness,\nthat unassumed confidence which belongs to the ordinary doings of\nour familiar life. Surely he must have known that he looked well\nin his wig and gown, as with low voice and bent neck, with only\nhalf-suppressed laughter, he whispered into the ears of the gentleman\nwho sat next to him some pleasant joke that had just occurred to him.\nHe could do that, though the eyes of all the court were upon him; so\ngreat was the man! And then he began with a sweet low voice, almost\nmodest in its tones. For a few moments it might have been thought\nthat some young woman was addressing the court, so gentle, so dulcet\nwere the tones.\n\n\"My lord, it is my intention on this occasion to do that which an\nadvocate can seldom do,--to make a clean breast of it, to tell the\ncourt and the jury all that I know of this case, all that I think of\nit, and all that I believe,--and in short to state a case as much in\nthe interest of my opponents as of my clients. The story with which I\nmust occupy the time of the court, I fear, for the whole remainder of\nthe day, with reference to the Lovel family, is replete with marvels\nand romance. I shall tell you of great crimes and of singular\nvirtues, of sorrows that have been endured and conquered, and of\nhopes that have been nearly realised; but the noble client on whose\nbehalf I am here called upon to address you, is not in any manner\nthe hero of this story. His heroism will be shown to consist in\nthis,--unless I mar the story in telling it,--that he is only anxious\nto establish the truth, whether that truth be for him or against him.\nWe have now to deal with an ancient and noble family, of which my\nclient, the present Earl Lovel, is at this time the head and chief.\nOn the question now before us depends the possession of immense\nwealth. Should this trial be carried to its natural conclusion it\nwill be for you to decide whether this wealth belongs to him as the\nheir-at-law of the late Earl, or whether there was left some nearer\nheir when that Earl died, whose rightful claim would bar that of my\nclient. But there is more to be tried than this,--and on that more\ndepends the right of two ladies to bear the name of Lovel. Such\nright, or the absence of such right, would in this country of itself\nbe sufficient to justify, nay, to render absolutely necessary, some\ntrial before a jury in any case of well-founded doubt. Our titles\nof honour bear so high a value among us, are so justly regarded as\nthe outward emblem of splendour and noble conduct, are recognised so\nuniversally as passports to all society, that we are naturally prone\nto watch their assumption with a caution most exact and scrupulous.\nWhen the demand for such honour is made on behalf of a man it\ngenerally includes the claim to some parliamentary privilege, the\nright to which has to be decided not by a jury, but by the body to\nwhich that privilege belongs. The claim to a peerage must be tried\nbefore the House of Lords,--if made by a woman as by a man, because\nthe son of the heiress would be a peer of Parliament. In the case\nwith which we are now concerned no such right is in question. The\nlady who claims to be the Countess Lovel, and her daughter who claims\nto be Lady Anna Lovel, make no demand which renders necessary other\ndecision than that of a jury. It is as though any female commoner in\nthe land claimed to have been the wife of an alleged husband. But\nnot the less is the claim made to a great and a noble name; and as\na grave doubt has been thrown upon the justice of the demand made\nby these ladies, it has become the duty of my client as the head of\nthe Lovels, as being himself, without any doubt, the Earl Lovel of\nthe day, to investigate the claim made, and to see that no false\npretenders are allowed to wear the highly prized honours of his\nfamily. Independently of the great property which is at stake, the\nnature of which it will be my duty to explain to you, the question at\nissue whether the elder lady be or be not Countess Lovel, and whether\nthe younger lady be or be not Lady Anna Lovel, has demanded the\ninvestigation which could not adequately have been made without this\njudicial array. I will now state frankly to you our belief that these\ntwo ladies are fully entitled to the names which they claim to bear;\nand I will add to that statement a stronger assurance of my own\npersonal conviction and that of my client that they themselves are\nfully assured of the truth and justice of their demand. I think it\nright also to let you know that since these inquiries were first\ncommenced, since the day for this trial was fixed, the younger of\nthese ladies has been residing with the uncle of my client, under\nthe same roof with my client, as an honoured and most welcome guest,\nand there, in the face of the whole country, has received that\nappellation of nobility from all the assembled members of my client's\nfamily, to dispute which I apparently now stand before you on that\nclient's behalf.\" The rector of Yoxham, who was in court, shook\nhis head vehemently when the statement was made that Lady Anna had\nbeen his welcome guest; but nobody was then regarding the rector of\nYoxham, and he shook his head in vain.\n\n\"You will at once ask why, if this be so, should the trial be\ncontinued. 'As all is thus conceded,' you will say, 'that these two\nladies claim, whom in your indictment you have misnamed Murray, why\nnot, in God's name, give them their privileges, and the wealth which\nshould appertain to them, and release them from the persecution of\njudicial proceedings?' In the first place I must answer that neither\nmy belief, nor that of my friends who are acting with me, nor even\nthat of my noble client himself, is sufficient to justify us in\nabstaining from seeking a decision which shall be final as against\nfurther claimants. If the young Earl should die, then would there be\nanother Earl, and that other Earl might also say, with grounds as\njust as those on which we have acted, that the lady, whom I shall\nhenceforward call the Countess Lovel, is no Countess. We think that\nshe is,--but it will be for you to decide whether she is or is not,\nafter hearing the evidence which will, no doubt, be adduced of her\nmarriage,--and any evidence to the contrary which other parties may\nbring before you. We shall adduce no evidence to the contrary, nor\ndo I think it probable that we shall ask a single question to shake\nthat with which my learned friend opposite is no doubt prepared. In\nfact, there is no reason why my learned friend and I should not sit\ntogether, having our briefs and our evidence in common. And then, as\nthe singular facts of this story become clear to you,--as I trust\nthat I may be able to make them clear,--you will learn that there are\nother interests at stake beyond those of my client and of the two\nladies who appear here as his opponents. Two statements have been\nmade tending to invalidate the rights of Countess Lovel,--both having\noriginated with one who appears to have been the basest and blackest\nhuman being with whose iniquities my experience as a lawyer has made\nme conversant. I speak of the late Earl. It was asserted by him,\nalmost from the date of his marriage with the lady who is now his\nwidow,--falsely stated, as I myself do not doubt,--that when he\nmarried her he had a former wife living. But it is, I understand,\ncapable of absolute proof that he also stated that this former wife\ndied soon after that second marriage,--which in such event would have\nbeen but a mock marriage. Were such the truth,--should you come to\nthe belief that the late Earl spoke truth in so saying,--the whole\nproperty at issue would become the undisputed possession of my\nclient. The late Earl died intestate, the will which he did leave\nhaving been already set aside by my client as having been made when\nthe Earl was mad. The real wife, according to this story, would\nbe dead. The second wife, according to this story, would be no\nwife,--and no widow. The daughter, according to this story, would\nbe no daughter in the eye of the law,--would, at any rate, be no\nheiress. The Earl would be the undisputed heir to the personal\nproperty, as he is to the real property and to the title. But we\ndisbelieve this story utterly,--we intend to offer no evidence to\nshow that the first wife,--for there was such a wife,--was living\nwhen the second marriage was contracted. We have no such evidence,\nand believe that none such can be found. Then that recreant nobleman,\nin whose breast there was no touch of nobility, in whose heart was no\nspark of mercy, made a second statement,--to this effect--that his\nfirst wife had not died at all. His reason for this it is hardly for\nus to seek. He may have done so, as affording a reason why he should\nnot go through a second marriage ceremony with the lady whom he had\nso ill used. But that he did make this statement is certain,--and\nit is also certain that he allowed an income to a certain woman as\nthough to a wife, that he allowed her to be called the Countess,\nthough he was then living with another Italian woman; and it is also\ncertain that this woman is still living,--or at least that she was\nliving some week or two ago. We believe her to have been an elder\nsister of her who was the first wife, and whose death occurred before\nthe second marriage. Should it be proved that this living woman was\nthe legitimate wife of the late Earl, not only would the right be\nbarred of those two English ladies to whom all our sympathies are now\ngiven, but no portion of the property in dispute would go either to\nthem or to my client. I am told that before his lordship, the Chief\nJustice, shall have left the case in your hands, an application will\nbe made to the court on behalf of that living lady. I do not know how\nthat may be, but I am so informed. If such application be made,--if\nthere be any attempt to prove that she should inherit as widow,--then\nwill my client again contest the case. We believe that the Countess\nLovel, the English Countess, is the widow, and that Lady Anna Lovel\nis Lady Anna Lovel, and is the heiress. Against them we will not\nstruggle. As was our bounden duty, we have sent not once only, but\ntwice and thrice, to Italy and to Sicily in search of evidence which,\nif true, would prove that the English Countess was no Countess. We\nhave failed, and have no evidence which we think it right to ask a\njury to believe. We think that a mass of falsehood has been heaped\ntogether among various persons in a remote part of a foreign country,\nwith the view of obtaining money, all of which was grounded on\nthe previous falsehoods of the late Earl. We will not use these\nfalsehoods with the object of disputing a right in the justice of\nwhich we have ourselves the strongest confidence. We withdraw from\nany such attempt.\n\n\"But as yet I have only given you the preliminaries of my story.\" He\nhad, in truth, told his story. He had, at least, told all of it that\nit will import that the reader should hear. He, indeed,--unfortunate\none,--will have heard the most of that story twice or thrice before.\nBut the audience in the Court of Queen's Bench still listened with\nbreathless attention, while, under this new head of his story he\ntold every detail again with much greater length than he had done in\nthe prelude which has been here given. He stated the facts of the\nCumberland marriage, apologizing to his learned friend the Serjeant\nfor taking, as he said, the very words out of his learned friend's\nmouth. He expatiated with an eloquence that was as vehement as it\nwas touching on the demoniacal schemes of that wicked Earl, to whom,\nduring the whole of his fiendish life, women had been a prey. He\nrepudiated, with a scorn that was almost terrible in its wrath, the\nidea that Josephine Murray had gone to the Earl's house with the name\nof wife, knowing that she was, in fact, but a mistress. She herself\nwas in court, thickly veiled, under the care of one of the Goffes,\nhaving been summoned there as a necessary witness, and could not\ncontrol her emotion as she listened to the words of warm eulogy with\nwhich the adverse counsel told the history of her life. It seemed\nto her then that justice was at last being done to her. Then the\nSolicitor-General reverted again to the two Italian women,--the\nSicilian sisters, as he called them,--and at much length gave his\nreasons for discrediting the evidence which he himself had sought,\nthat he might use it with the object of establishing the claim of his\nclient. And lastly, he described the nature of the possessions which\nhad been amassed by the late Earl, who, black with covetousness as he\nwas with every other sin, had so manipulated his property that almost\nthe whole of it had become personal, and was thus inheritable by a\nfemale heiress. He knew, he said, that he was somewhat irregular\nin alluding to facts,--or to fiction, if any one should call it\nfiction,--which he did not intend to prove, or to attempt to prove;\nbut there was something, he said, beyond the common in the aspect\nwhich this case had taken, something in itself so irregular, that he\nthought he might perhaps be held to be excused in what he had done.\n\"For the sake of the whole Lovel family, for the sake of these two\nmost interesting ladies, who have been subjected, during a long\nperiod of years, to most undeserved calamities, we are anxious to\nestablish the truth. I have told you what we believe to be the truth,\nand as that in no single detail militates against the case as it will\nbe put forward by my learned friends opposite, we have no evidence to\noffer. We are content to accept the marriage of the widowed Countess\nas a marriage in every respect legal and binding.\" So saying the\nSolicitor-General sat down.\n\nIt was then past five o'clock, and the court, as a matter of course,\nwas adjourned, but it was adjourned by consent to the Wednesday,\ninstead of to the following day, in order that there might be due\nconsideration given to the nature of the proceedings that must\nfollow. As the thing stood at present it seemed that there need be no\nfurther plea of \"Lovel v. Murray and Another.\" It had been granted\nthat Murray was not Murray, but Lovel; yet it was thought that\nsomething further would be done.\n\nIt had all been very pretty; but yet there had been a feeling of\ndisappointment throughout the audience. Not a word had been said as\nto that part of the whole case which was supposed to be the most\nromantic. Not a word had been said about the tailor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nDANIEL THWAITE ALONE.\n\n\nThere were two persons in the court who heard the statement of the\nSolicitor-General with equal interest,--and perhaps with equal\ndisapprobation,--whose motives and ideas on the subject were exactly\nopposite. These two were the Rev. Mr. Lovel, the uncle of the\nplaintiff, and Daniel Thwaite, the tailor, whose whole life had been\npassed in furthering the cause of the defendants. The parson, from\nthe moment in which he had heard that the young lady whom he had\nentertained in his house had engaged herself to marry the tailor,\nhad reverted to his old suspicions,--suspicions which, indeed, he\nhad never altogether laid aside. It had been very grievous to him to\nprefer a doubtful Lady Anna to a most indubitable Lady Fitzwarren.\nHe liked the old-established things,--things which had always been\nunsuspected, which were not only respectable but firm-rooted. For\ntwenty years he had been certain that the Countess was a false\ncountess; and he, too, had lamented with deep inward lamentation over\nthe loss of the wealth which ought to have gone to support the family\nearldom. It was monstrous to him that the property of one Earl Lovel\nshould not appertain to the next Earl. He would on the moment have\nhad the laws with reference to the succession of personal property\naltered, with retrospective action, so that so great an iniquity\nshould be impossible. When the case against the so-called Countess\nwas, as it were, abandoned by the Solicitor-General, and the\ngreat interests at stake thrown up, he would have put the conduct\nof the matter into other hands. Then had come upon him the\nbitterness of having to entertain in his own house the now almost\nundisputed,--though by him still suspected,--heiress, on behalf of\nhis nephew, of a nephew who did not treat him well. And now the\nheiress had shown what she really was by declaring her intention\nof marrying a tailor! When that became known, he did hope that the\nSolicitor-General would change his purpose and fight the cause.\n\nThe ladies of the family, the two aunts, had affected to disbelieve\nthe paragraph which Lady Fitzwarren had shown them with so much\ntriumph. The rector had declared that it was just the kind of thing\nthat he had expected. Aunt Julia, speaking freely, had said that it\nwas just the kind of thing which she, knowing the girl, could not\nbelieve. Then the rector had come up to town to hear the trial, and\non the day preceding it had asked his nephew as to the truth of the\nrumour which had reached him. \"It is true,\" said the young lord,\nknitting his brow, \"but it had better not be talked about.\"\n\n\"Why not talked about? All the world knows it. It has been in the\nnewspapers.\"\n\n\"Any one wishing to oblige me will not mention it,\" said the Earl.\nThis was too bad. It could not be possible,--for the honour of all\nthe Lovels it could not surely be possible,--that Lord Lovel was\nstill seeking the hand of a young woman who had confessed that\nshe was engaged to marry a journeyman tailor! And yet to him, the\nuncle,--to him who had not long since been in loco parentis to the\nlord,--the lord would vouchsafe no further reply than that above\ngiven! The rector almost made himself believe that, great as might\nbe the sorrow caused by such disruption, it would become his duty to\nquarrel with the Head of his family!\n\nHe listened with most attentive ears to every word spoken by the\nSolicitor-General, and quarrelled with almost every word. Would not\nany one have imagined that this advocate had been paid to plead\nthe cause, not of the Earl, but of the Countess? As regarded the\ninterests of the Earl, everything was surrendered. Appeal was made\nfor the sympathies of all the court,--and, through the newspapers,\nfor the sympathies of all England,--not on behalf of the Earl who was\nbeing defrauded of his rights, but on behalf of the young woman who\nhad disgraced the name which she pretended to call her own,--and\nwhose only refuge from that disgrace must be in the fact that to that\nname she had no righteous claim! Even when this apostate barrister\ncame to a recapitulation of the property at stake, and explained the\ncause of its being vested, not in land as is now the case with the\nbulk of the possessions of noble lords,--but in shares and funds and\nventures of commercial speculation here and there, after the fashion\nof tradesmen,--he said not a word to stir up in the minds of the\njury a feeling of the injury which had been done to the present Earl.\n\"Only that I am told that he has a wife of his own I should think\nthat he meant to marry one of the women himself,\" said the indignant\nrector in the letter which he wrote to his sister Julia.\n\nAnd the tailor was as indignant as the rector. He was summoned as a\nwitness and was therefore bound to attend,--at the loss of his day's\nwork. When he reached the court, which he did long before the judge\nhad taken his seat, he found it to be almost impossible to effect\nan entrance. He gave his name to some officer about the place,\nbut learned that his name was altogether unknown. He showed his\nsubpoena and was told that he must wait till he was called. \"Where\nmust I wait?\" asked the angry radical. \"Anywhere,\" said the man in\nauthority; \"but you can't force your way in here.\" Then he remembered\nthat no one had as yet paid so dearly for this struggle, no one had\nsuffered so much, no one had been so instrumental in bringing the\ntruth to light, as he, and this was the way in which he was treated!\nHad there been any justice in those concerned a seat would have been\nprovided for him in the court, even though his attendance had not\nbeen required. There were hundreds there, brought thither by simple\ncuriosity, to whom priority of entrance into the court had been\naccorded by favour, because they were wealthy, or because they were\nmen of rank, or because they had friends high in office. All his\nwealth had been expended in this case; it was he who had been the\nmost constant friend of this Countess; but for him and his father\nthere might probably have been no question of a trial at this day.\nAnd yet he was allowed to beg for admittance, and to be shoved out of\ncourt because he had no friends. \"The court is a public court, and is\nopen to the public,\" he said, as he thrust his shoulders forward with\na resolution that he would effect an entrance. Then he was taken in\nhand by two constables and pushed back through the doorway,--to the\ngreat detriment of the apple-woman who sat there in those days.\n\nBut by pluck and resolution he succeeded in making good some inch of\nstanding room within the court before the Solicitor-General began his\nstatement, and he was able to hear every word that was said. That\nstatement was not more pleasing to him than to the rector of Yoxham.\nHis first quarrel was with the assertion that titles of nobility are\nin England the outward emblem of noble conduct. No words that might\nhave been uttered could have been more directly antagonistic to his\nfeelings and political creed. It had been the accident of his life\nthat he should have been concerned with ladies who were noble by\nmarriage and birth, and that it had become a duty to him to help to\nclaim on their behalf empty names which were in themselves odious to\nhim. It had been the woman's right to be acknowledged as the wife of\nthe man who had disowned her, and the girl's right to be known as\nhis legitimate daughter. Therefore had he been concerned. But he had\ndeclared to himself, from his first crude conception of an opinion\non the subject, that it would be hard to touch pitch and not be\ndefiled. The lords of whom he heard were, or were believed by\nhim to be, bloated with luxury, were both rich and idle, were\ngamblers, debauchers of other men's wives, deniers of all rights\nof citizenship, drones who were positively authorised to eat the\nhoney collected by the working bees. With his half-knowledge, his\nill-gotten and ill-digested information, with his reading which had\nall been on one side, he had been unable as yet to catch a glimpse of\nthe fact that from the ranks of the nobility are taken the greater\nproportion of the hardworking servants of the State. His eyes saw\nmerely the power, the privileges, the titles, the ribbons, and the\nmoney;--and he hated a lord. When therefore the Solicitor-General\nspoke of the recognised virtue of titles in England, the tailor\nuttered words of scorn to his stranger neighbour. \"And yet this man\ncalls himself a Liberal, and voted for the Reform Bill,\" he said.\n\"In course he did,\" replied the stranger; \"that was the way of his\nparty.\" \"There isn't an honest man among them all,\" said the tailor\nto himself. This was at the beginning of the speech, and he listened\non through five long hours, not losing a word of the argument,\nnot missing a single point made in favour of the Countess and her\ndaughter. It became clear to him at any rate that the daughter would\ninherit the money. When the Solicitor-General came to speak of\nthe nature of the evidence collected in Italy, Daniel Thwaite was\nunconsciously carried away into a firm conviction that all those\nconcerned in the matter in Italy were swindlers. The girl was no\ndoubt the heiress. The feeling of all the court was with her,--as he\ncould well perceive. But in all that speech not one single word was\nsaid of the friend who had been true to the girl and to her mother\nthrough all their struggles and adversity. The name of Thomas Thwaite\nwas not once mentioned. It might have been expedient for them to\nignore him, Daniel, the son; but surely had there been any honour\namong them, any feeling of common honesty towards folk so low in\nthe scale of humanity as tailors, some word would have been spoken\nto tell of the friendship of the old man who had gone to his grave\nalmost a pauper because of his truth and constancy. But no;--there\nwas not a word!\n\nAnd he listened, with anxious ears, to learn whether anything would\nbe said as to that proposed \"alliance,\"--he had always heard it\ncalled an alliance with a grim smile,--between the two noble cousins.\nHeaven and earth had been moved to promote \"the alliance.\" But the\nSolicitor-General said not a word on the subject,--any more than he\ndid of that other disreputable social arrangement, which would have\nbeen no more than a marriage. All the audience might suppose from\nanything that was said there that the young lady was fancy free and\nhad never yet dreamed of a husband. Nevertheless there was hardly\none there who had not heard something of the story of the Earl's\nsuit,--and something also of the tailor's success.\n\nWhen the court broke up Daniel Thwaite had reached standing-room,\nwhich brought him near to the seat that was occupied by Serjeant\nBluestone. He lingered as long as he could, and saw all the\nbarristers concerned standing with their heads together laughing,\nchatting, and well pleased, as though the day had been for them a day\nof pleasure. \"I fancy the speculation is too bad for any one to take\nit up,\" he heard the Serjeant say, among whose various gifts was not\nthat of being able to moderate his voice. \"I dare say not,\" said\nDaniel to himself as he left the court; \"and yet we took it up when\nthe risk was greater, and when there was nothing to be gained.\" He\nhad as yet received no explicit answer to the note which he had\nwritten to the Countess when he sent her the copy of his father's\nwill. He had, indeed, received a notice from Mr. Goffe that the\nmatter would receive immediate attention, and that the Countess hoped\nto be able to settle the claim in a very short time. But that he\nthought was not such a letter as should have been sent to him on\nan occasion so full of interest to him! But they were all hard and\nunjust and bad. The Countess was bad because she was a Countess,--the\nlawyers because they were lawyers,--the whole Lovel family because\nthey were Lovels. At this moment poor Daniel Thwaite was very bitter\nagainst all mankind. He would, he thought, go at once to the Western\nworld of which he was always dreaming, if he could only get that sum\nof \u00c2\u00a3500 which was manifestly due to him.\n\nBut as he wandered away after the court was up, getting some wretched\nsolitary meal at a cheap eating-house on his road, he endeavoured to\nfix his thoughts on the question of the girl's affection to himself.\nTaking all that had been said in that courtly lawyer's speech this\nmorning as the groundwork of his present judgment, what should he\njudge to be her condition at the moment? He had heard on all sides\nthat it was intended that she should marry the young Earl, and it\nhad been said in his hearing that such would be declared before the\njudge. No such declaration had been made. Not a word had been uttered\nto signify that such an \"alliance\" was contemplated. Efforts had\nbeen made with him to induce him to withdraw his claim to the girl's\nhand. The Countess had urged him, and the lawyers had urged him.\nMost assuredly they would not have done so,--would have in no wise\ntroubled themselves with him at all,--had they been able to prevail\nwith Lady Anna. And why had they not so prevailed? The girl,\ndoubtless, had been subjected to every temptation. She was kept\nsecure from his interference. Hitherto he had not even made an effort\nto see her since she had left the house in which he himself lived.\nShe had nothing to fear from him. She had been sojourning among those\nLovels, who would doubtless have made the way to deceit and luxury\neasy for her. He could not doubt but that she had been solicited to\nenter into this alliance. Could he be justified in flattering himself\nthat she had hitherto resisted temptation because in her heart of\nhearts she was true to her first love? He was true. He was conscious\nof his own constancy. He was sure of himself that he was bound to her\nby his love, and not by the hope of any worldly advantage. And why\nshould he think that she was weaker, vainer, less noble than himself?\nHad he not evidence to show him that she was strong enough to resist\na temptation to which he had never been subjected? He had read of\nwomen who were above the gilt and glitter of the world. When he was\ndisposed to think that she would be false, no terms of reproach\nseemed to him too severe to heap upon her name; and yet, when he\nfound that he had no ground on which to accuse her, even in his own\nthoughts, of treachery to himself, he could hardly bring himself to\nthink it possible that she should not be treacherous. She had sworn\nto him, as he had sworn to her, and was he not bound to believe her\noath?\n\nThen he remembered what the poet had said to him. The poet had\nadvised him to desist altogether, and had told him that it would\ncertainly be best for the girl that he should do so. The poet had not\nbased his advice on the ground that the girl would prove false, but\nthat it would be good for the girl to be allowed to be false,--good\nfor the girl that she should be encouraged to be false, in order that\nshe might become an earl's wife! But he thought that it would be bad\nfor any woman to be an earl's wife; and so thinking, how could he\nabandon his love in order that he might hand her over to a fashion\nof life which he himself despised? The poet must be wrong. He would\ncling to his love till he should know that his love was false to him.\nShould he ever learn that, then his love should be troubled with him\nno further.\n\nBut something must be done. Even, on her behalf, if she were true to\nhim, something must be done. Was it not pusillanimous in him to make\nno attempt to see his love and to tell her that he at any rate was\ntrue to her? These people, who were now his enemies, the lawyers and\nthe Lovels, with the Countess at the head of them, had used him like\na dog, had repudiated him without remorse, had not a word even to say\nof the services which his father had rendered. Was he bound by honour\nor duty to stand on any terms with them? Could there be anything due\nto them from him? Did it not behove him as a man to find his way\ninto the girl's presence and to assist her with his courage? He did\nnot fear them. What cause had he to fear them? In all that had been\nbetween them his actions to them had been kind and good, whereas they\nwere treating him with the basest ingratitude.\n\nBut how should he see Lady Anna? As he thought of all this he\nwandered up from Westminster, where he had eaten his dinner, to\nRussell Square and into Keppel Street, hesitating whether he would\nat once knock at the door and ask to see Lady Anna Lovel. Lady Anna\nwas still staying with Mrs. Bluestone; but Daniel Thwaite had not\nbelieved the Countess when she told him that her daughter was not\nliving with her. He doubted, however, and did not knock at the door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nJUSTICE IS TO BE DONE.\n\n\nIt must not be thought that the Countess was unmoved when she\nreceived Daniel Thwaite's letter from Keswick enclosing the copy\nof his father's will. She was all alone, and she sat long in her\nsolitude, thinking of the friend who was gone and who had been always\ntrue to her. She herself would have done for old Thomas Thwaite any\nservice which a woman could render to a man, so strongly did she feel\nall that the man had done for her. As she had once said, no menial\noffice performed by her on behalf of the old tailor would have been\ndegrading to her. She had eaten his bread, and she never for a moment\nforgot the obligation. The slow tears stood in her eyes as she\nthought of the long long hours which she had passed in his company,\nwhile, almost desponding herself, she had received courage from his\npersistency. And her feeling for the son would have been the same,\nhad not the future position of her daughter and the standing of\nthe house of Lovel been at stake. It was not in her nature to be\nungrateful; but neither was it in her nature to postpone the whole\nobject of her existence to her gratitude. Even though she should\nappear to the world as a monster of ingratitude, she must treat the\nsurviving Thwaite as her bitterest enemy as long as he maintained\nhis pretensions to her daughter's hand. She could have no friendly\ncommunication with him. She herself would hold no communication\nwith him at all, if she might possibly avoid it, lest she should\nbe drawn into some renewed relation of friendship with him. He was\nher enemy,--her enemy in such fierce degree that she was always\nplotting the means of ridding herself altogether of his presence\nand influence. To her thinking the man had turned upon her most\ntreacherously, and was using, for his own purposes and his own\naggrandizement, that familiarity with her affairs which he had\nacquired by reason of his father's generosity. She believed but\nlittle in his love; but whether he loved the girl or merely sought\nher money, was all one to her. Her whole life had been passed in an\neffort to prove her daughter to be a lady of rank, and she would\nrather sacrifice her life in the basest manner than live to see all\nher efforts annulled by a low marriage. Love, indeed, and romance!\nWhat was the love of one individual, what was the romance of a\nchildish girl, to the honour and well-being of an ancient and noble\nfamily? It was her ambition to see her girl become the Countess\nLovel, and no feeling of gratitude should stand in her way. She would\nrather slay that lowborn artisan with her own hand than know that he\nhad the right to claim her as his mother-in-law. Nevertheless, the\nslow tears crept down her cheeks as she thought of former days, and\nof the little parlour behind the tailor's shop at Keswick, in which\nthe two children had been wont to play.\n\nBut the money must be paid; or, at least, the debt must be\nacknowledged. As soon as she had somewhat recovered herself she\nopened the old desk which had for years been the receptacle of all\nher papers, and taking out sundry scribbled documents, went to work\nat a sum in addition. It cannot be said of her that she was a good\naccountant, but she had been so far careful as to have kept entries\nof all the monies she had received from Thomas Thwaite. She had once\ncarried in her head a correct idea of the entire sum she owed him;\nbut now she set down the items with dates, and made the account fair\non a sheet of note paper. So much money she certainly did owe to\nDaniel Thwaite, and so much she would certainly pay if ever the means\nof paying it should be hers. Then she went off with her account to\nMr. Goffe.\n\nMr. Goffe did not think that the matter pressed. The payment of\nlarge sums which have been long due never is pressing in the eyes of\nlawyers. Men are always supposed to have a hundred pounds in their\nwaistcoat pockets; but arrangements have to be made for the settling\nof thousands. \"You had better let me write him a line and tell him\nthat it shall be looked to as soon as the question as to the property\nis decided,\" said Mr. Goffe. But this did not suit the views of the\nCountess. She spoke out very openly as to all she owed to the father,\nand as to her eternal enmity to the son. It behoved her to pay the\ndebt, if only that she might be able to treat the man altogether as\nan enemy. She had understood that, even pending the trial, a portion\nof the income would be allowed by the courts for her use and for the\nexpenses of the trial. It was assented that this money should be\npaid. Could steps be taken by which it might be settled at once? Mr.\nGoffe, taking the memorandum, said that he would see what could be\ndone, and then wrote his short note to Daniel Thwaite. When he had\ncomputed the interest which must undoubtedly be paid on the borrowed\nmoney he found that a sum of about \u00c2\u00a39,000 was due to the tailor.\n\"Nine thousand pounds!\" said one Mr. Goffe to another. \"That will be\nbetter to him than marrying the daughter of an earl.\" Could Daniel\nhave heard the words he would have taken the lawyer by the throat and\nhave endeavoured to teach him what love is.\n\nThen the trial came on. Before the day fixed had come round, but only\njust before it, Mr. Goffe showed the account to Serjeant Bluestone.\n\"God bless my soul!\" said the Serjeant. \"There should be some\nvouchers for such an amount as that.\" Mr. Goffe declared that there\nwere no vouchers, except for a very trifling part of it; but still\nthought that the amount should be allowed. The Countess was quite\nwilling to make oath, if need be, that the money had been supplied\nto her. Then the further consideration of the question was for the\nmoment postponed, and the trial came on.\n\nOn the Tuesday, which had been left a vacant day as regarded the\ntrial, there was a meeting,--like all other proceedings in this\ncause, very irregular in its nature,--at the chambers of the\nSolicitor-General, at which Serjeant Bluestone attended with Messrs.\nHardy, Mainsail, Flick, and Goffe; and at this meeting, among other\nmatters of business, mention was made of the debt due by the Countess\nto Daniel Thwaite. Of this debt the Solicitor-General had not as yet\nheard,--though he had heard of the devoted friendship of the old\ntailor. That support had been afforded to some extent,--that for\na period the shelter of old Thwaite's roof had been lent to the\nCountess,--that the man had been generous and trusting, he did\nknow. He had learned, of course, that thence had sprung that early\nfamiliarity which had enabled the younger Thwaite to make his\nengagement with Lady Anna. That something should be paid when the\nladies came by their own he was aware. But the ladies were not his\nclients, and into the circumstances he had not inquired. Now he was\nastounded and almost scandalized by the amount of the debt.\n\n\"Do you mean to say that he advanced \u00c2\u00a39,000 in hard cash?\" said the\nSolicitor-General.\n\n\"That includes interest at five per cent., Sir William, and also a\nsmall sum for bills paid by Thomas Thwaite on her behalf. She has had\nin actual cash about \u00c2\u00a37,000.\"\n\n\"And where has it gone?\"\n\n\"A good deal of it through my hands,\" said Mr. Goffe boldly. \"During\ntwo or three years she had no income at all, and during the last\ntwenty years she has been at law for her rights. He advanced all the\nmoney when that trial for bigamy took place.\"\n\n\"God bless my soul!\" said Mr. Serjeant Bluestone.\n\n\"Did he leave a will?\" asked the Solicitor-General.\n\n\"Oh, yes; a will which has been proved, and of which I have a copy.\nThere was nothing else to leave but this debt, and that is left to\nthe son.\"\n\n\"It should certainly be paid without delay,\" said Mr. Hardy. Mr.\nMainsail questioned whether they could get the money. Mr. Goffe\ndoubted whether it could be had before the whole affair was settled.\nMr. Flick was sure that on due representation the amount would be\nadvanced at once. The income of the property was already accumulating\nin the hands of the court, and there was an anxiety that all just\ndemands,--demands which might be considered to be justly made on the\nfamily property,--should be paid without delay. \"I think there would\nhardly be a question,\" said Mr. Hardy.\n\n\"Seven thousand pounds advanced by these two small tradesmen to the\nCountess Lovel,\" said the Solicitor-General, \"and that done at a time\nwhen no relation of her own or of her husband would lend her a penny!\nI wish I had known that when I went into court yesterday.\"\n\n\"It would hardly have done any good,\" said the Serjeant.\n\n\"It would have enabled one at any rate to give credit where credit is\ndue. And this son is the man who claims to be affianced to the Lady\nAnna?\"\n\n\"The same man, Sir William,\" said Mr. Goffe.\n\n\"One is almost inclined to think that he deserves her.\"\n\n\"I can't agree with you there at all,\" said the Serjeant angrily.\n\n\"One at any rate is not astonished that the young lady should think\nso,\" continued the Solicitor-General. \"Upon my word, I don't know how\nwe are to expect that she should throw her early lover overboard\nafter such evidence of devotion.\"\n\n\"The marriage would be too incongruous,\" said Mr. Hardy.\n\n\"Quite horrible,\" said the Serjeant.\n\n\"It distresses one to think of it,\" said Mr. Goffe.\n\n\"It would be much better that she should not be Lady Anna at all, if\nshe is to do that,\" said Mr. Mainsail.\n\n\"Very much better,\" said Mr. Flick, shaking his head, and remembering\nthat he was employed by Lord Lovel and not by the Countess,--a fact\nof which it seemed to him that the Solicitor-General altogether\nforgot the importance.\n\n\"Gentlemen, you have no romance among you,\" said Sir William. \"Have\nnot generosity and valour always prevailed over wealth and rank with\nladies in story?\"\n\n\"I do not remember any valorous tailors who have succeeded with\nladies of high degree,\" said Mr. Hardy.\n\n\"Did not the lady of the Strachy marry the yeoman of the wardrobe?\"\nasked the Solicitor-General.\n\n\"I don't know that we care much about romance here,\" said the\nSerjeant. \"The marriage would be so abominable, that it is not to be\nthought of.\"\n\n\"The tailor should at any rate get his money,\" said the\nSolicitor-General, \"and I will undertake to say that if the case be\nas represented by Mr. Goffe--\"\n\n\"It certainly is,\" said the attorney.\n\n\"Then there will be no difficulty in raising the funds for paying it.\nIf he is not to have his wife, at any rate let him have his money.\nI think, Mr. Flick, that intimation should be made to him that Earl\nLovel will join the Countess in immediate application to the court\nfor means to settle his claim. Circumstanced as we are at present,\nthere can be no doubt that such application will have the desired\nresult. It should, of course, be intimated that Serjeant Bluestone\nand myself are both of opinion that the money should be allowed for\nthe purpose.\"\n\nAs the immediate result of this conversation, Daniel Thwaite received\non the following morning letters both from Mr. Goffe and Mr. Flick.\nThe former intimated to him that a sum of nine thousand odd pounds\nwas held to be due to him by the Countess, and that immediate steps\nwould be taken for its payment. That from Mr. Flick, which was much\nshorter than the letter from his brother attorney, merely stated that\nas a very large sum of money appeared to be due by the Countess Lovel\nto the estate of the late Thomas Thwaite, for sums advanced to the\nCountess during the last twenty years, the present Earl Lovel had\nbeen advised to join the Countess in application to the courts,\nthat the amount due might be paid out of the income of the property\nleft by the late Earl; and that that application would be made\n\"_immediately_.\" Mr. Goffe in his letter, went on to make certain\nsuggestions, and to give much advice. As this very large debt, of\nwhich no proof was extant, was freely admitted by the Countess, and\nas steps were being at once taken to ensure payment of the whole\nsum named to Daniel Thwaite, as his father's heir, it was hoped\nthat Daniel Thwaite would at once abandon his preposterous claim to\nthe hand of Lady Anna Lovel. Then Mr. Goffe put forward in glowing\ncolours the iniquity of which Daniel Thwaite would be guilty should\nhe continue his fruitless endeavours to postpone the re-establishment\nof a noble family which was thus showing its united benevolence by\npaying to him the money which it owed him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nTHE VERDICT.\n\n\nOn the Wednesday the court reassembled in all its judicial glory.\nThere was the same crowd, the same Lord Chief Justice, the same jury,\nand the same array of friendly lawyers. There had been a rumour that\na third retinue of lawyers would appear on behalf of what was now\ngenerally called the Italian interest, and certain words which had\nfallen from the Solicitor-General on Monday had assured the world at\nlarge that the Italian interest would be represented. It was known\nthat the Italian case had been confided to a firm of enterprising\nsolicitors, named Mowbray and Mopus, perhaps more feared than\nrespected, which was supposed to do a great amount of speculative\nbusiness. But no one from the house of Messrs. Mowbray and Mopus was\nin court on the Wednesday morning; and no energetic barrister was\never enriched by a fee from them on behalf of the Italian widow.\nThe speculation had been found to be too deep, the expenditure\nwhich would be required in advance too great, and the prospect of\nremuneration too remote even for Mowbray and Mopus. It appeared\nafterwards that application had been made by those gentlemen for an\nassurance that expenses incurred on behalf of the Italian Countess\nshould be paid out of the estate; but this had been refused. No\nguarantee to this effect could be given, at any rate till it should\nbe seen whether the Italian lady had any show of justice on her side.\nIt was now the general belief that if there was any truth at all in\nthe Italian claim, it rested on the survivorship, at the time of the\nCumberland marriage, of a wife who had long since died. As the proof\nof this would have given no penny to any one in Italy,--would simply\nhave shown that the Earl was the heir,--Messrs. Mowbray and Mopus\nretired, and there was an end, for ever and a day, of the Italian\ninterest.\n\nThough there was the same throng in the court as on the Monday,\nthere did not seem to be the same hubbub on the opening of the day's\nproceedings. The barristers were less busy with their papers, the\nattorneys sat quite at their ease, and the Chief Justice, with an\nassistant judge, who was his bench-fellow, appeared for some minutes\nto be quite passive. Then the Solicitor-General arose and said that,\nwith permission, he would occupy the court for only a few minutes.\nHe had stated on Monday his belief that an application would be made\nto the court on behalf of other interests than those which had been\nrepresented when the court first met. It appeared that he had been\nwrong in that surmise. Of course he had no knowledge on the subject,\nbut it did not appear that any learned gentleman was prepared to\naddress the court for any third party. As he, on behalf of his\nclient, had receded from the case, his Lordship would probably say\nwhat, in his Lordship's opinion, should now be the proceeding of\nthe court. The Earl Lovel abandoned his plea, and perhaps the court\nwould, in those circumstances, decide that its jurisdiction in the\nmatter was over. Then the Lord Chief Justice, with his assistant\njudge, retired for a while, and all the assembled crowd appeared to\nbe at liberty to discuss the matter just as everybody pleased.\n\nIt was undoubtedly the opinion of the bar at large, and at that\nmoment of the world in general, that the Solicitor-General had done\nbadly for his client. The sum of money which was at stake was, they\nsaid, too large to be played with. As the advocate of the Earl, Sir\nWilliam ought to have kept himself aloof from the Countess and her\ndaughter. In lieu of regarding his client, he had taken upon himself\nto set things right in general, according to his idea of right. No\ndoubt he was a clever man, and knew how to address a jury, but he was\nalways thinking of himself, and bolstering up something of his own,\ninstead of thinking of his case and bolstering up his client. And\nthis conception of his character in general, and of his practice in\nthis particular, became the stronger, as it was gradually believed\nthat the living Italian Countess was certainly an impostor. There\nwould have been little good in fighting against the English Countess\non her behalf;--but if they could only have proved that the other\nItalian woman, who was now dead, had been the real Countess when the\nCumberland marriage was made, then what a grand thing it would have\nbeen for the Lovel family! Of those who held this opinion, the rector\nof Yoxham was the strongest, and the most envenomed against the\nSolicitor-General. During the whole of that Tuesday he went about\ndeclaring that the interests of the Lovel family had been sacrificed\nby their own counsel, and late in the afternoon he managed to get\nhold of Mr. Hardy. Could nothing be done? Mr. Hardy was of opinion\nthat nothing could be done now; but in the course of the evening he\ndid, at the rector's instance, manage to see Sir William, and to ask\nthe question, \"Could nothing be done?\"\n\n\"Nothing more than we propose to do.\"\n\n\"Then the case is over,\" said Mr. Hardy. \"I am assured that no one\nwill stir on behalf of that Italian lady.\"\n\n\"If any one did stir it would only be loss of time and money. My dear\nHardy, I understand as well as any one what people are saying, and\nI know what must be the feeling of many of the Lovels. But I can\nonly do my duty by my client to the best of my judgment. In the\nfirst place, you must remember that he has himself acknowledged the\nCountess.\"\n\n\"By our advice,\" said Mr. Hardy.\n\n\"You mean by mine. Exactly so;--but with such conviction on his own\npart that he positively refuses to be a party to any suit which\nshall be based on the assumption that she is not Countess Lovel.\nLet an advocate be ever so obdurate, he can hardly carry on a case\nin opposition to his client's instructions. We are acting for Lord\nLovel, and not for the Lovel family. And I feel assured of this, that\nwere we to attempt to set up the plea that that other woman was alive\nwhen the marriage took place in Cumberland, you, yourself, would be\nashamed of the evidence which it would become your duty to endeavour\nto foist upon the jury. We should certainly be beaten, and, in\nthe ultimate settlement of the property, we should have to do\nwith enemies instead of friends. The man was tried for bigamy and\nacquitted. Would any jury get over that unless you had evidence\nto offer to them that was plain as a pikestaff, and absolutely\nincontrovertible?\"\n\n\"Do you still think the girl will marry the Earl?\"\n\n\"No; I do not. She seems to have a will of her own, and that will is\nbent the other way. But I do think that a settlement may be made of\nthe property which shall be very much in the Earl's favour.\" When on\nthe following morning the Solicitor-General made his second speech,\nwhich did not occupy above a quarter of an hour, it became manifest\nthat he did not intend to alter his course of proceeding, and while\nthe judges were absent it was said by everybody in the court that the\nCountess and Lady Anna had gained their suit.\n\n\"I consider it to be a most disgraceful course of proceeding on the\npart of Sir William Patterson,\" said the rector to a middle-aged\nlegal functionary, who was managing clerk to Norton and Flick.\n\n\"We all think, sir, that there was more fight in it,\" said the legal\nfunctionary.\n\n\"There was plenty of fight in it. I don't believe that any jury in\nEngland would willingly have taken such an amount of property from\nthe head of the Lovel family. For the last twenty years,--ever since\nI first heard of the pretended English marriage,--everybody has known\nthat she was no more a Countess than I am. I can't understand it;\nupon my word I can't. I have not had much to do with law, but I've\nalways been brought up to think that an English barrister would be\ntrue to his client. I believe a case can be tried again if it can be\nshown that the lawyers have mismanaged it.\" The unfortunate rector,\nwhen he made this suggestion, no doubt forgot that the client in this\ncase was in full agreement with the wicked advocate.\n\nThe judges were absent for about half an hour, and on their return\nthe Chief Justice declared that his learned brother,--the Serjeant\nnamely,--had better proceed with the case on behalf of his clients.\nHe went on to explain that as the right to the property in dispute,\nand indeed the immediate possession of that property, would be ruled\nby the decision of the jury, it was imperative that they should hear\nwhat the learned counsel for the so-called Countess and her daughter\nhad to say, and what evidence they had to offer, as to the validity\nof her marriage. It was not to be supposed that he intended to throw\nany doubt on that marriage, but such would be the safer course. No\ndoubt, in the ordinary course of succession, a widow and a daughter\nwould inherit and divide among them in certain fixed proportions the\npersonal property of a deceased but intestate husband and father,\nwithout the intervention of any jury to declare their rights. But in\nthis case suspicion had been thrown and adverse statements had been\nmade; and as his learned brother was, as a matter of course, provided\nwith evidence to prove that which the plaintiff had come into the\ncourt with the professed intention of disproving, the case had better\ngo on. Then he wrapped his robes around him and threw himself back\nin the attitude of a listener. Serjeant Bluestone, already on his\nlegs, declared himself prepared and willing to proceed. No doubt\nthe course as now directed was the proper course to be pursued. The\nSolicitor-General, rising gracefully and bowing to the court, gave\nhis consent with complaisant patronage. \"Your Lordship, no doubt,\nis right.\" His words were whispered, and very probably not heard;\nbut the smile, as coming from a Solicitor-General,--from such a\nSolicitor-General as Sir William Patterson,--was sufficient to put\nany judge at his ease.\n\nThen Serjeant Bluestone made his statement, and the case was\nproceeded with after the fashion of such trials. It will not concern\nus to follow the further proceedings of the court with any close\nattention. The Solicitor-General went away, to some other business,\nand much of the interest seemed to drop. The marriage in Cumberland\nwas proved; the trial for bigamy, with the acquittal of the Earl, was\nproved; the two opposed statements of the Earl, as to the death of\nthe first wife, and afterwards as to the fact that she was living,\nwere proved. Serjeant Bluestone and Mr. Mainsail were very busy for\ntwo days, having everything before them. Mr. Hardy, on behalf of the\nyoung lord, kept his seat, but he said not a word--not even asking a\nquestion of one of Serjeant Bluestone's witnesses. Twice the foreman\nof the jury interposed, expressing an opinion, on behalf of himself\nand his brethren, that the case need not be proceeded with further;\nbut the judge ruled that it was for the interest of the Countess,--he\nceased to style her the so-called Countess,--that her advocates\nshould be allowed to complete their case. In the afternoon of the\nsecond day they did complete it, with great triumph and a fine\nflourish of forensic oratory as to the cruel persecution which their\nclient had endured. The Solicitor-General came back into court in\ntime to hear the judge's charge, which was very short. The jury were\ntold that they had no alternative but to find a verdict for the\ndefendants. It was explained to them that this was a plea to show\nthat a certain marriage which had taken place in Cumberland in 181--,\nwas no real or valid marriage. Not only was that plea withdrawn, but\nevidence had been adduced proving that that marriage was valid. Such\na marriage was, as a matter of course, prim\u00c3\u00a2 facie valid, let what\nstatements might be made to the contrary by those concerned or not\nconcerned. In such case the burden of proof would rest entirely with\nthe makers of such statement. No such proof had been here attempted,\nand the marriage must be declared a valid marriage. The jury had\nnothing to do with the disposition of the property, and it would be\nsufficient for them simply to find a verdict for the defendants. The\njury did as they were bid; but, going somewhat beyond this, declared\nthat they found the two defendants to be properly named the Countess\nLovel, and Lady Anna Lovel. So ended the case of \"Lovel v. Murray and\nAnother.\"\n\nThe Countess, who had been in the court all day, was taken home to\nKeppel Street by the Serjeant in a glass coach that had been hired\nto be in waiting for her. \"And now, Lady Lovel,\" said Serjeant\nBluestone, as he took his seat opposite to her, \"I can congratulate\nyour ladyship on the full restitution of your rights.\" She only shook\nher head. \"The battle has been fought and won at last, and I will\nmake free to say that I have never seen more admirable persistency\nthan you have shown since first that bad man astounded your ears by\nhis iniquity.\"\n\n\"It has been all to no purpose,\" she said.\n\n\"To no purpose, Lady Lovel! I may as well tell you now that it is\nexpected that his Majesty will send to congratulate you on the\nrestitution of your rights.\"\n\nAgain she shook her head. \"Ah, Serjeant Bluestone;--that will be but\nof little service.\"\n\n\"No further objection can now be made to the surrender of the whole\nproperty. There are some mining shares as to which there may be a\nquestion whether they are real or personal, but they amount to but\nlittle. A third of the remainder, which will, I imagine, exceed--\"\n\n\"If it were ten times as much, Serjeant Bluestone, there would be no\ncomfort in it. If it were ten times that, it would not at all help to\nheal my sorrow. I have sometimes thought that when one is marked for\ntrouble, no ease can come.\"\n\n\"I don't think more of money than another man,\" began the Serjeant.\n\n\"You do not understand.\"\n\n\"Nor yet of titles,--though I feel for them, when they are worthily\nworn, the highest respect,\" as he so spoke the Serjeant lifted his\nhat from his brow. \"But, upon my word, to have won such a case as\nthis justifies triumph.\"\n\n\"I have won nothing,--nothing,--nothing!\"\n\n\"You mean about Lady Anna?\"\n\n\"Serjeant Bluestone, when first I was told that I was not that man's\nwife, I swore to myself that I would die sooner than accept any lower\nname; but when I found that I was a mother, then I swore that I would\nlive till my child should bear the name that of right belonged to\nher.\"\n\n\"She does bear it now.\"\n\n\"What name does she propose to bear? I would sooner be poor, in\nbeggary,--still fighting, even without means to fight, for an empty\ntitle,--still suffering, still conscious that all around me regarded\nme as an impostor, than conquer only to know that she, for whom all\nthis has been done, has degraded her name and my own. If she does\nthis thing, or, if she has a mind so low, a spirit so mean, as to\nthink of doing it, would it not be better for all the world that she\nshould be the bastard child of a rich man's kept mistress, than the\nacknowledged daughter of an earl, with a countess for her mother, and\na princely fortune to support her rank? If she marries this man, I\nshall heartily wish that Lord Lovel had won the case. I care nothing\nfor myself now. I have lost all that. The king's message will comfort\nme not at all. If she do this thing I shall only feel the evil we\nhave done in taking the money from the Earl. I would sooner see her\ndead at my feet than know that she was that man's wife;--ay, though\nI had stabbed her with my own hand!\"\n\nThe Serjeant for the nonce could say nothing more to her. She had\nworked herself into such a passion that she would listen to no words\nbut her own, and think of nothing but the wrong that was still being\ndone to her. He put her down at the hall door in Keppel Street,\nsaying, as he lifted his hat again, that Mrs. Bluestone should come\nand call upon her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nWILL YOU PROMISE?\n\n\nThe news of the verdict was communicated the same evening to Lady\nAnna,--as to whose name there could now no longer be any dispute. \"I\ncongratulate you, Lady Anna,\" said the Serjeant, holding her hand,\n\"that everything as far as this trial is concerned has gone just as\nwe could wish.\"\n\n\"We owe it all to you,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Not at all. My work has been very easy. In fact I have some feeling\nof regret that I have not been placed in a position that would enable\nme to earn my wages. The case was too good,--so that a poor aspiring\nlawyer has not been able to add to his reputation. But as far as you\nare concerned, my dear, everything has gone as you should wish. You\nare now a very wealthy heiress, and the great duty devolves upon\nyou of disposing of your wealth in a fitting manner.\" Lady Anna\nunderstood well what was meant, and was silent. Even when she was\nalone, her success did not make her triumphant. She could anticipate\nthat the efforts of all her friends to make her false to her word\nwould be redoubled. Unless she could see Daniel Thwaite, it would be\nimpossible that she should not be conquered.\n\nThe Serjeant told his wife the promise which he had made on her\nbehalf, and she, of course, undertook to go to Keppel Street on\nthe following morning. \"You had better bring her here,\" said the\nSerjeant. Mrs. Bluestone remarked that that might be sooner said than\ndone. \"She'll be glad of an excuse to come,\" answered the Serjeant.\n\"On such an occasion as this, of course they must see each other.\nSomething must be arranged about the property. In a month or two,\nwhen she is of age, she will have the undisputed right to do what\nshe pleases with about three hundred thousand pounds. It is a most\nremarkable position for a young girl who has never yet had the\ncommand of a penny, and who professes that she is engaged to marry a\nworking tailor. Of course her mother must see her.\"\n\nMrs. Bluestone did call in Keppel Street, and sat with the Countess a\nlong time, undergoing a perfect hailstorm of passion. For a long time\nLady Lovel declared that she would never see her daughter again till\nthe girl had given a solemn promise that she would not marry Daniel\nThwaite. \"Love her! Of course I love her. She is all that I have\nin the world. But of what good is my love to me, if she disgraces\nme? She has disgraced me already. When she could bring herself to\ntell her cousin that she was engaged to this man, we were already\ndisgraced. When she once allowed the man to speak to her in that\nstrain, without withering him with her scorn, she disgraced us both.\nFor what have I done it all, if this is to be the end of it?\" But at\nlast she assented and promised that she would come. No;--it would not\nbe necessary to send a carriage for her. The habits of her own life\nneed not be at all altered because she was now a Countess beyond\ndispute, and also wealthy. She would be content to live as she had\never lived. It had gone on too long for her to desire personal\ncomfort,--luxury for herself, or even social rank. The only pleasure\nthat she had anticipated, the only triumph that she desired, was to\nbe found in the splendour of her child. She would walk to Bedford\nSquare, and then walk back to her lodgings in Keppel Street. She\nwanted no carriage.\n\nEarly on the following day there was heard the knock at the door\nwhich Lady Anna had been taught to expect. The coming visit had been\ndiscussed in all its bearings, and it had been settled that Mrs.\nBluestone should be with the daughter when the mother arrived. It was\nthought that in this way the first severity of the Countess would be\nmitigated, and that the chance of some agreement between them might\nbe increased. Both the Serjeant and Mrs. Bluestone now conceived that\nthe young lady had a stronger will of her own than might have been\nexpected from her looks, her language, and her manners. She had not\nas yet yielded an inch, though she would not argue the matter at\nall when she was told that it was her positive duty to abandon the\ntailor. She would sit quite silent; and if silence does give consent,\nshe consented to this doctrine. Mrs. Bluestone, with a diligence\nwhich was equalled only by her good humour, insisted on the misery\nwhich must come upon her young friend should she quarrel with the\nCountess, and with all the Lovels,--on the unfitness of the tailor,\nand the impossibility that such a marriage should make a lady\nhappy,--on the sacred duty which Lady Anna's rank imposed upon her to\nsupport her order, and on the general blessedness of a well-preserved\nand exclusive aristocracy. \"I don't mean to say that nobly born\npeople are a bit better than commoners,\" said Mrs. Bluestone.\n\"Neither I nor my children have a drop of noble blood in our veins.\nIt is not that. But God Almighty has chosen that there should be\ndifferent ranks to carry out His purposes, and we have His word to\ntell us that we should all do our duties in that state of life to\nwhich it has pleased Him to call us.\" The excellent lady was somewhat\namong the clouds in her theology, and apt to mingle the different\nsources of religious instruction from which she was wont to draw\nlessons for her own and her children's guidance; but she meant to\nsay that the proper state of life for an earl's daughter could not\ninclude an attachment to a tailor; and Lady Anna took it as it was\nmeant. The nobly born young lady did not in heart deny the truth of\nthe lesson;--but she had learned another lesson, and she did not\nknow how to make the two compatible. That other lesson taught her to\nbelieve that she ought to be true to her word;--that she specially\nought to be true to one who had ever been specially true to her. And\nlatterly there had grown upon her a feeling less favourable to the\nEarl than that which he had inspired when she first saw him, and\nwhich he had increased when they were together at Yoxham. It is hard\nto say why the Earl had ceased to charm her, or by what acts or words\nhe had lowered himself in her eyes. He was as handsome as ever, as\nmuch like a young Apollo, as gracious in his manner, and as gentle in\nhis gait. And he had been constant to her. Perhaps it was that she\nhad expected that one so godlike should have ceased to adore a woman\nwho had degraded herself to the level of a tailor, and that, so\nconceiving, she had begun to think that his motives might be merely\nhuman, and perhaps sordid. He ought to have abstained and seen her no\nmore after she had owned her own degradation. But she said nothing\nof all this to Mrs. Bluestone. She made no answer to the sermons\npreached to her. She certainly said no word tending to make that lady\nthink that the sermons had been of any avail. \"She looks as soft as\nbutter,\" Mrs. Bluestone said that morning to her husband; \"but she is\nobstinate as a pig all the time.\"\n\n\"I suppose her father was the same way before her,\" said the\nSerjeant, \"and God knows her mother is obstinate enough.\"\n\nWhen the Countess was shown into the room Lady Anna was trembling\nwith fear and emotion. Lady Lovel, during the last few weeks, since\nher daughter had seen her, had changed the nature of her dress.\nHitherto, for years past, she had worn a brown stuff gown, hardly\never varying even the shade of the sombre colour,--so that her\ndaughter had perhaps never seen her otherwise clad. No woman that\never breathed was less subject to personal vanity than had been the\nso-called Countess who lived in the little cottage outside Keswick.\nHer own dress had been as nothing to her, and in the days of her\nclose familiarity with old Thomas Thwaite she had rebuked her friend\nwhen he had besought her to attire herself in silk. \"We'll go into\nKeswick and get Anna a new ribbon,\" she would say, \"and that will be\ngrandeur enough for her and me too.\" In this brown dress she had come\nup to London, and so she had been clothed when her daughter last saw\nher. But now she wore a new, full, black silk dress, which, plain\nas it was, befitted her rank and gave an increased authority to her\ncommanding figure. Lady Anna trembled all the more, and her heart\nsank still lower within her, because her mother no longer wore the\nold brown gown. When the Countess entered the room she took no\nimmediate notice of Mrs. Bluestone, but went up to her child and\nkissed her. \"I am comforted, Anna, in seeing you once again,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Dear, dearest mamma!\"\n\n\"You have heard, I suppose, that the trial has been decided in your\nfavour?\"\n\n\"In yours, mamma.\"\n\n\"We have explained it all to her, Lady Lovel, as well as we could.\nThe Serjeant yesterday evening gave us a little history of what\noccurred. It seems to have been quite a triumph.\"\n\n\"It may become a triumph,\" said the Countess;--\"a triumph so complete\nand glorious that I shall desire nothing further in this world. It\nhas been my work to win the prize; it is for her to wear it,--if she\nwill do so.\"\n\n\"I hope you will both live to enjoy it many years,\" said Mrs.\nBluestone. \"You will have much to say to each other, and I will leave\nyou now. We shall have lunch, Lady Lovel, at half-past one, and I\nhope that you will join us.\"\n\nThen they were alone together. Lady Anna had not moved from her chair\nsince she had embraced her mother, but the Countess had stood during\nthe whole time that Mrs. Bluestone had been in the room. When the\nroom door was closed they both remained silent for a few moments, and\nthen the girl rushed across the room and threw herself on her knees\nat her mother's feet. \"Oh, mamma, mamma, tell me that you love me.\nOh, mamma, why have you not let me come to you? Oh, mamma, we never\nwere parted before.\"\n\n\"My child never before was wilfully disobedient to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma;--tell me that you love me.\"\n\n\"Love you! Yes, I love you. You do not doubt that, Anna. How could it\nbe possible that you should doubt it after twenty years of a mother's\ncare? You know I love you.\"\n\n\"I know that I love you, mamma, and that it kills me to be sent away\nfrom you. You will take me home with you now;--will you not?\"\n\n\"Home! You shall make your own home, and I will take you whither you\nwill. I will be a servant to minister to every whim; all the world\nshall be a Paradise to you; you shall have every joy that wealth, and\nlove, and sweet friends can procure for you,--if you will obey me in\none thing.\" Lady Anna, still crouching upon the ground, hid her face\nin her mother's dress, but she was silent. \"It is not much that I ask\nafter a life spent in winning for you all that has now been won. I\nonly demand of you that you shall not disgrace yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, I am not disgraced.\"\n\n\"Say that you will marry Lord Lovel, and all that shall be forgotten.\nIt shall at any rate be forgiven, or remembered only as the folly of\na child. Will you say that you will become Lord Lovel's wife?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma!\"\n\n\"Answer me, Anna;--will you say that you will receive Lord Lovel as\nyour accepted lover? Get up, girl, and look me in the face. Of what\nuse is it to grovel there, while your spirit is in rebellion? Will\nyou do this? Will you save us all from destruction, misery, and\ndisgrace? Will you remember who you are;--what blood you have in your\nveins;--what name it is that you bear? Stand up, and look me in the\nface, if you dare.\"\n\nLady Anna did stand up, and did look her mother in the face. \"Mamma,\"\nshe said, \"we should understand each other better if we were living\ntogether as we ought to do.\"\n\n\"I will never live with you till you have promised obedience. Will\nyou, at any rate, pledge to me your word that you will never become\nthe wife of Daniel Thwaite?\" Then she paused, and stood looking at\nthe girl, perhaps for a minute. Lady Anna stood before her, with her\neyes turned upon the ground. \"Answer me the question that I have\nasked you. Will you promise me that you will never become the wife of\nDaniel Thwaite?\"\n\n\"I have promised him that I would.\"\n\n\"What is that to me? Is your duty to him higher than your duty to me?\nCan you be bound by any promise to so great a crime as that would be?\nI will ask you the question once more, and I will be governed by your\nanswer. If you will promise to discard this man, you shall return\nhome with me, and shall then choose everything for yourself. We will\ngo abroad and travel if you wish it, and all things shall be prepared\nto give you pleasure. You shall have at once the full enjoyment of\nall that has been won for you; and as for your cousin,--you shall not\nfor a while be troubled even by his name. It is the dear wish of my\nheart that you should be the wife of Earl Lovel;--but I have one\nwish dearer even than that,--one to which that shall be altogether\npostponed. If you will save yourself, and me, and all your family\nfrom the terrible disgrace with which you have threatened us,--I will\nnot again mention your cousin's name to you till it shall please you\nto hear it. Anna, you knelt to me, just now. Shall I kneel to you?\"\n\n\"No, mamma, no;--I should die.\"\n\n\"Then, my love, give me the promise that I have asked.\"\n\n\"Mamma, he has been so good to us!\"\n\n\"And we will be good to him,--good to him in his degree. Of what\navail to me will have been his goodness, if he is to rob me of the\nvery treasure which his goodness helped to save? Is he to have all,\nbecause he gave some aid? Is he to take from me my heart's blood,\nbecause he bound up my arm when it was bruised? Because he helped me\nsome steps on earth, is he to imprison me afterwards in hell? Good!\nNo, he is not good in wishing so to destroy us. He is bad, greedy,\ncovetous, self-seeking, a very dog, and by the living God he shall\ndie like a dog unless you will free me from his fangs. You have not\nanswered me. Will you tell me that you will discard him as a suitor\nfor your hand? If you will say so, he shall receive tenfold reward\nfor his--goodness. Answer me, Anna;--I claim an answer from you.\"\n\n\"Mamma!\"\n\n\"Speak, if you have anything to say. And remember the commandment,\nHonour thy--\" But she broke down, when she too remembered it, and\nbore in mind that the precept would have called upon her daughter to\nhonour the memory of the deceased Earl. \"But if you cannot do it for\nlove, you will never do it for duty.\"\n\n\"Mamma, I am sure of one thing.\"\n\n\"Of what are you sure?\"\n\n\"That I ought to be allowed to see him before I give him up.\"\n\n\"You shall never be allowed to see him.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, mamma, for a moment. When he asked me to--love him, we\nwere equals.\"\n\n\"I deny it. You were never equals.\"\n\n\"We lived as such,--except in this, that they had money for our\nwants, and we had none to repay them.\"\n\n\"Money can have nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"Only that we took it. And then he was everything to us. It seemed as\nthough it would be impossible to refuse anything that he asked. It\nwas impossible to me. As to being noble, I am sure that he was noble.\nYou always used to say that nobody else ever was so good as those\ntwo. Did you not say so, mamma?\"\n\n\"If I praise my horse or my dog, do I say that they are of the same\nnature as myself?\"\n\n\"But he is a man; quite as much a man as,--as any man could be.\"\n\n\"You mean that you will not do as I bid you.\"\n\n\"Let me see him, mamma. Let me see him but once. If I might see him,\nperhaps I might do as you wish--about him. I cannot say anything more\nunless I may see him.\"\n\nThe Countess still stormed and still threatened, but she could not\nmove her daughter. She also found that the child had inherited\nparticles of the nature of her parents. But it was necessary that\nsome arrangement should be made as to the future life, both of Lady\nAnna and of herself. She might bury herself where she would, in the\nmost desolate corner of the earth, but she could not leave Lady\nAnna in Bedford Square. In a few months Lady Anna might choose any\nresidence she pleased for herself, and there could be no doubt whose\nhouse she would share, if she were not still kept in subjection. The\ntwo parted then in deep grief,--the mother almost cursing her child\nin her anger, and Lady Anna overwhelmed with tears. \"Will you not\nkiss me, mamma, before you go?\"\n\n\"No, I will never kiss you again till you have shown me that you are\nmy child.\"\n\nBut before she left the house, the Countess was closeted for a while\nwith Mrs. Bluestone, and, in spite of all that she had said, it was\nagreed between them that it would be better to permit an interview\nbetween the girl and Daniel Thwaite. \"Let him say what he will,\"\nargued Mrs. Bluestone, \"she will not be more headstrong than she is\nnow. You will still be able to take her away with you to some foreign\ncountry.\"\n\n\"But he will treat her as though he were her lover,\" said the\nCountess, unable to conceal the infinite disgust with which the idea\noverwhelmed her.\n\n\"What does it matter, Lady Lovel? We have got to get a promise from\nher, somehow. Since she was much with him, she has seen people of\nanother sort, and she will feel the difference. It may be that she\nwants to ask him to release her. At any rate she speaks as though she\nmight be released by what he would say to her. Unless she thought\nit might be so herself, she would not make a conditional promise. I\nwould let them meet.\"\n\n\"But where?\"\n\n\"In Keppel Street.\"\n\n\"In my presence?\"\n\n\"No, not that; but you will, of course, be in the house,--so that she\ncannot leave it with him. Let her come to you. It will be an excuse\nfor her doing so, and then she can remain. If she does not give the\npromise, take her abroad, and teach her to forget it by degrees.\" So\nit was arranged, and on that evening Mrs. Bluestone told Lady Anna\nthat she was to be allowed to meet Daniel Thwaite.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nDANIEL THWAITE RECEIVES HIS MONEY.\n\n\nThere was of course much commotion among all circles of society in\nLondon as soon as it was known to have been decided that the Countess\nLovel was the Countess Lovel, and that Lady Anna was the heiress\nof the late Earl. Bets were paid,--and bets no doubt were left\nunpaid,--to a great amount. Men at the clubs talked more about the\nLovels than they had done even during the month preceding the trial.\nThe Countess became on a sudden very popular. Exaggerated stories\nwere told of the romance of her past life,--though it would have been\nwell nigh impossible to exaggerate her sufferings. Her patience, her\nlong endurance and persistency were extolled by all. The wealth that\nwould accrue to her and to her daughter was of course doubled. Had\nanybody seen her? Did anybody know her? Even the Murrays began to be\nproud of her, and old Lady Jemima Magtaggart, who had been a Murray\nbefore she married General Mag, as he was called, went at once and\ncalled upon the Countess in Keppel Street. Being the first that\ndid so, before the Countess had suspected any invasion, she was\nadmitted,--and came away declaring that sorrow must have driven the\nCountess mad. The Countess, no doubt, did not receive her distant\nrelative with any gentle courtesy. She had sworn to herself often,\nthat come what come might, she would never cross the threshold of a\nMurray. Old Lord Swanage, who had married some very distant Lovel,\nwrote to her a letter full of very proper feeling. It had been, he\nsaid, quite impossible for him to know the truth before the truth had\ncome to light, and therefore he made no apology for not having before\nthis made overtures of friendship to his connection. He now begged to\nexpress his great delight that she who had so well deserved success\nhad been successful, and to offer her his hand in friendship, should\nshe be inclined to accept it. The Countess answered him in a strain\nwhich certainly showed that she was not mad. It was not her policy to\nquarrel with any Lovel, and her letter was very courteous. She was\ngreatly obliged to him for his kindness, and had felt as strongly as\nhe could do that she could have no claim on her husband's relations\ntill she should succeed in establishing her rights. She accepted his\nhand in the spirit in which it had been offered, and hoped that his\nLordship might yet become a friend of her daughter. For herself,--she\nfeared that all that she had suffered had made her unfit for much\nsocial intercourse. Her strength, she said, had been sufficient to\ncarry her thus far, but was now failing her.\n\nThen, too, there came to her that great glory of which the lawyer had\ngiven her a hint. She received a letter from the private secretary\nof his Majesty the King, telling her that his Majesty had heard her\nstory with great interest, and now congratulated her heartily on the\nre-establishment of her rank and position. She wrote a very curt\nnote, begging that her thanks might be given to his Majesty,--and\nthen she burned the private secretary's letter. No congratulations\nwere anything to her till she should see her daughter freed from the\ndebasement of her engagement to the tailor.\n\nSpeculation was rife as to the kind of life which the Countess would\nlead. That she would have wealth sufficient to blaze forth in London\nwith all the glories of Countess-ship, there was no doubt. Her own\nshare of the estate was put down as worth at least ten thousand a\nyear for her life, and this she would enjoy without deductions, and\nwith no other expenditure than that needed for herself. Her age was\nascertained to a day, and it was known that she was as yet only\nforty-five. Was it not probable that some happy man might share\nher wealth with her? What an excellent thing it would be for old\nLundy,--the Marquis of Lundy,--who had run through every shilling of\nhis own property! Before a week was over, the suggestion had been\nmade to old Lundy. \"They say she is mad, but she can't be mad enough\nfor that,\" said the Marquis.\n\nThe rector hurried home full of indignation, but he had a word or\ntwo with his nephew before he started. \"What do you mean to do now,\nFrederic?\" asked the rector with a very grave demeanour.\n\n\"Do? I don't know that I shall do anything.\"\n\n\"You give up the girl, then?\"\n\n\"My dear uncle; that is a sort of question that I don't think a man\never likes to be asked.\"\n\n\"But I suppose I may ask how you intend to live?\"\n\n\"I trust, uncle Charles, that I shall not, at any rate, be a burden\nto my relatives.\"\n\n\"Oh; very well; very well. Of course I have nothing more to say. I\nthink it right, all the same, to express my opinion that you have\nbeen grossly misused by Sir William Patterson. Of course what I say\nwill have no weight with you; but that is my opinion.\"\n\n\"I do not agree with you, uncle Charles.\"\n\n\"Very well; I have nothing more to say. It is right that I should\nlet you know that I do not believe that this woman was ever Lord\nLovel's wife. I never did believe it, and I never will believe it.\nAll that about marrying the girl has been a take in from beginning\nto end;--all planned to induce you to do just what you have done. No\nword in courtesy should ever have been spoken to either of them.\"\n\n\"I am as sure that she is the Countess as I am that I am the Earl.\"\n\n\"Very well. It costs me nothing, but it costs you thirty thousand a\nyear. Do you mean to come down to Yoxham this winter?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Are the horses to be kept there?\" Now hitherto the rich rector had\nkept the poor lord's hunters without charging his nephew ought for\ntheir expense. He was a man so constituted that it would have been\na misery to him that the head of his family should not have horses\nto ride. But now he could not but remember all that he had done, all\nthat he was doing, and the return that was made to him. Nevertheless\nhe could have bit the tongue out of his mouth for asking the question\nas soon as the words were spoken.\n\n\"I will have them sold immediately,\" said the Earl. \"They shall come\nup to Tattersal's before the week is over.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean that.\"\n\n\"I am glad that you thought of it, uncle Charles. They shall be taken\naway at once.\"\n\n\"They are quite welcome to remain at Yoxham.\"\n\n\"They shall be removed,--and sold,\" said the Earl. \"Remember me to my\naunts. Good bye.\" Then the rector went down to Yoxham an angry and a\nmiserable man.\n\nThere were very many who still agreed with the rector in thinking\nthat the Earl's case had been mismanaged. There was surely enough of\nground for a prolonged fight to have enabled the Lovel party to have\ndriven their opponents to a compromise. There was a feeling that the\nSolicitor-General had been carried away by some romantic idea of\nabstract right, and had acted in direct opposition to all the usages\nof forensic advocacy as established in England. What was it to him\nwhether the Countess were or were not a real Countess? It had been\nhis duty to get what he could for the Earl, his client. There had\nbeen much to get, and with patience no doubt something might have\nbeen got. But he had gotten nothing. Many thought that he had\naltogether cut his own throat, and that he would have to take the\nfirst \"puny\" judgeship vacant. \"He is a great man,--a very great man\nindeed,\" said the Attorney-General, in answer to some one who was\nabusing Sir William. \"There is not one of us can hold a candle to\nhim. But, then, as I have always said, he ought to have been a poet!\"\n\nIn discussing the Solicitor-General's conduct men thought more\nof Lady Anna than her mother. The truth about Lady Anna and her\nengagement was generally known in a misty, hazy, half-truthful\nmanner. That she was engaged to marry Daniel Thwaite, who was now\nbecoming famous and the cause of a greatly increased business in\nWigmore Street, was certain. It was certain also that the Earl had\ndesired to marry her. But as to the condition in which the matter\nstood at present there was a very divided opinion. Not a few were\npositive that a written engagement had been given to the Earl that\nhe should have the heiress before the Solicitor-General had made his\nspeech,--but, according to these, the tailor's hold over the young\nlady was so strong, that she now refused to abide by her own compact.\nShe was in the tailor's hands and the tailor could do what he liked\nwith her. It was known that Lady Anna was in Bedford Square, and not\na few walked before the Serjeant's house in the hopes of seeing her.\nThe romance at any rate was not over, and possibly there might even\nyet be a compromise. If the Earl could get even five thousand a year\nout of the property, it was thought that the Solicitor-General might\nhold his own and in due time become at any rate a Chief Baron.\n\nIn the mean time Daniel Thwaite remained in moody silence among the\nworkmen in Wigmore Street, unseen of any of those who rushed there\nfor new liveries in order that they might catch a glimpse of the\nsuccessful hero,--till one morning, about five days after the trial\nwas over, when he received a letter from Messrs. Goffe and Goffe.\nMessrs. Goffe and Goffe had the pleasure of informing him that an\naccurate account of all money transactions between Countess Lovel\nand his father had been kept by the Countess;--that the Countess on\nbehalf of herself and Lady Anna Lovel acknowledged a debt due to the\nestate of the late Mr. Thomas Thwaite, amounting to \u00c2\u00a39,109 3_s._\n4_d._, and that a cheque to that amount should be at once handed to\nhim,--Daniel Thwaite the son,--if he would call at the chambers of\nMessrs. Goffe and Goffe, with a certified copy of the probate of the\nwill of Thomas Thwaite the father.\n\nNine thousand pounds,--and that to be paid to him immediately,--on\nthat very day if he chose to call for it! The copy of the probate of\nthe will he had in his pocket at that moment. But he worked out his\nday's work without going near Goffe and Goffe. And yet he thought\nmuch of his money; and once, when one of his employers spoke to\nhim somewhat roughly, he remembered that he was probably a better\nman than his master. What should he now do with himself and his\nmoney,--how bestow himself,--how use it so that he might be of\nservice to the world? He would go no doubt to some country in which\nthere were no earls and no countesses;--but he could go nowhere till\nhe should know what might be his fate with the Earl's daughter, who\nat present was his destiny. His mind was absolutely divided. In one\nhour he would say to himself that the poet was certainly right;--and\nin the next he was sure that the poet must have been wrong. As\nregarded money, nine thousand pounds was as good to him as any sum\nthat could be named. He could do with that all that he required that\nmoney should do for him. Could he at this time have had his own way\nabsolutely, he would have left all the remainder of the wealth behind\nhim, to be shared as they pleased to share it between the Earl and\nthe Countess, and he would have gone at once, taking with him the\ngirl whom he loved. He would have revelled in the pride of thinking\nthat all of them should say that he had wanted and had won the girl\nonly,--and not the wealth of the Lovels; that he had taken only what\nwas his own, and that his wife would be dependent on him, not he on\nher. But this was not possible. It was now months since he had heard\nthe girl's voice, or had received any assurance from her that she\nwas still true to him. But, in lieu of this, he had the assurance\nthat she was in possession of enormous wealth, and that she was the\nrecognised cousin of lords and ladies by the dozen.\n\nWhen the evening came he saw one of his employers and told the man\nthat he wished that his place might be filled. Why was he going? Did\nhe expect to better himself? When was he going? Was he in earnest?\nDaniel told the truth at once as far as the payment of the money was\nconcerned. He was to receive on the following day a sum of money\nwhich had been due to his father, and, when that should have been\npaid him, it would not suit him to work longer for weekly wages. The\ntailor grumbled, but there was nothing else to be said. Thwaite might\nleave them to-morrow if he wished. Thwaite took him at his word and\nnever returned to the shop in Wigmore Street after that night.\n\nOn reaching his lodgings he found another letter,--from Serjeant\nBluestone. The Countess had so far given way as to accede to the\nproposition that there should be a meeting between her daughter and\nthe tailor, and then there had arisen the question as to the manner\nin which this meeting should be arranged. The Countess would not\nwrite herself, nor would she allow her daughter to do so. It was\ndesirable, she thought, that as few people should know of the meeting\nas possible, and at last, most unwillingly, the Serjeant undertook\nthe task of arranging it. He wrote therefore as follows;--\n\n\n   Mr. Serjeant Bluestone presents his compliments to Mr.\n   Daniel Thwaite. Mr. Thwaite has no doubt heard of the\n   result of the trial by which the Countess Lovel and her\n   daughter have succeeded in obtaining the recognition of\n   their rank. It is in contemplation with the Countess and\n   Lady Anna Lovel to go abroad, but Lady Anna is desirous\n   before she goes of seeing the son of the man who was her\n   mother's staunch friend during many years of suffering.\n   Lady Anna will be at home, at No. ---- Keppel Street, at\n   eleven o'clock on Monday, 23rd instant, if Mr. Thwaite can\n   make it convenient to call then and there.\n\n   Bedford Square,\n   17th November, 18--.\n\n   If Mr. Thwaite could call on the Serjeant before that\n   date, either early in the morning at his house, or on\n   Saturday at his chambers, ---- ----, Inner Temple, it\n   might perhaps be serviceable.\n\n\nThe postscript had not been added without much consideration. What\nwould the tailor think of this invitation? Would he not be disposed\nto take it as encouragement in his pernicious suit? Would he not\ngo to Keppel Street with a determination to insist upon the girl's\npromise? The Serjeant had thought that it would be best to let the\nthing take its chance. But the Serjeant's wife, and the Serjeant's\ndaughters, and the Countess, too, had all agreed that something if\npossible should be said to disabuse him of this idea. He was to have\nnine thousand pounds paid to him. Surely that might be sufficient.\nBut, if he was greedy and wanted more money, more money should be\ngiven to him. Only he must be made to understand that the marriage\nwas out of the question. So the Serjeant again gave way, and proposed\nthe interview. Daniel sent back his compliments to the Serjeant\nand begged to say he would do as he was bid. He would call at the\nSerjeant's chambers on the Saturday, and in Keppel Street on the\nfollowing Monday, at the hours named.\n\nOn the next morning,--the first morning of his freedom from the\nservitude of Wigmore Street,--he went to Messrs. Goffe and Goffe. He\ngot up late and breakfasted late, in order that he might feel what it\nwas to be an idle man. \"I might now be as idle as the young Earl,\"\nhe said to himself; \"but were I to attempt it, what should I do with\nmyself? How should I make the hours pass by?\" He felt that he was\nlauding himself as the idea passed through his mind, and struggled to\nquench his own pride. \"And yet,\" said he in his thoughts, \"is it not\nfit that I should know myself to be better than he is? If I have no\nself-confidence, how can I be bold to persevere? The man that works\nis to him that is idle, as light is to darkness.\"\n\nHe was admitted at once to Mr. Goffe's private room, and was received\nwith a smiling welcome, and an outstretched hand. \"I am delighted,\nMr. Thwaite, to be able to settle your claim on Lady Lovel with so\nlittle delay. I hope you are satisfied with her ladyship's statement\nof the account.\"\n\n\"Much more than satisfied with the amount. It appeared to me that I\nhad no legal claim for more than a few hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"We knew better than that, Mr. Thwaite. We should have seen that no\ngreat injury was done. But luckily the Countess has been careful, and\nhas put down each sum advanced, item by item. Full interest has been\nallowed at five per cent., as is quite proper. The Countess is an\nexcellent woman of business.\"\n\n\"No doubt, Mr. Goffe. I could have wished that she would have\ncondescended to honour me with a line;--but that is a matter of\nfeeling.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Thwaite; there are reasons;--you must know that there are\nreasons.\"\n\n\"There may be good reasons or bad reasons.\"\n\n\"And there may be good judgment in such matters and bad judgment.\nBut, however,--. You will like to have this money by a cheque, no\ndoubt. There it is, \u00c2\u00a39,109 3_s._ 4_d._ It is not often that we write\none cheque for a bigger sum than that, Mr. Thwaite. Shall I cross it\non your bankers? No bankers! With such a sum as that let me recommend\nyou to open an account at once.\" And Mr. Goffe absolutely walked down\nto Fleet Street with Daniel Thwaite the tailor, and introduced him at\nhis own bank. The business was soon transacted, and Daniel Thwaite\nwent away westward, a capitalist, with a cheque book in his pocket.\nWhat was he to do with himself? He walked east again before the day\nwas over, and made inquiries at various offices as to vessels sailing\nfor Boston, New York, Baltimore, and Quebec. Or how would it be with\nhim if he should be minded to go east instead of west? So he supplied\nhimself also with information as to vessels for Sydney. And what\nshould he do when he got to the new country? He did not mean to be a\ntailor. He was astonished to find how little he had as yet realised\nin his mind the details of the exodus which he had proposed to\nhimself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nI WILL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR NOTHING.\n\n\nOn the Saturday, Daniel was at the Serjeant's chambers early in the\nmorning,--long before the hour at which the Serjeant himself was wont\nto attend. No time had in fact been named, and the tailor had chosen\nto suppose that as he had been desired to be early in Bedford Square,\nso had it also been intended that he should be early in the Temple.\nFor two hours he walked about the passages and the courts, thinking\nill of the lawyer for being so late at his business, and endeavouring\nto determine what he would do with himself. He had not a friend in\nthe world, unless Lady Anna were a friend;--hardly an acquaintance.\nAnd yet, remembering what his father had done, what he himself had\nhelped to do, he thought that he ought to have had many friends.\nThose very persons who were now his bitterest enemies, the Countess\nand all they who had supported her, should have been bound to him by\nclose ties. Yet he knew that it was impossible that they should not\nhate him. He could understand their feelings with reference to their\nown rank, though to him that rank was contemptible. Of course he was\nalone. Of course he would fail. He was almost prepared to acknowledge\nas much to the Serjeant. He had heard of a certain vessel that would\nstart in three days for the rising colony called New South Wales, and\nhe almost wished that he had taken his passage in her.\n\nAt ten o'clock he had been desired to call at eleven, and as the\nclock struck eleven he knocked at the Serjeant's door. \"Serjeant\nBluestone is not here yet,\" said the clerk, who was disposed to be\nannoyed by the man's pertinacity.\n\n\"He told me to come early in the morning, and this is not early.\"\n\n\"He is not here yet, sir.\"\n\n\"You told me to come at eleven, and it is past eleven.\"\n\n\"It is one minute past, and you can sit down and wait for him if you\nplease.\" Daniel refused to wait, and was again about to depart in\nhis wrath, when the Serjeant appeared upon the stairs. He introduced\nhimself, and expressed regret that he should have found his visitor\nthere before him. Daniel, muttering something, followed the lawyer\ninto his room, and then the door was closed. He stood till he was\ninvited to sit, and was determined to make himself disagreeable. This\nman was one of his enemies,--was one who no doubt thought little\nof him because he was a tailor, who suspected his motives, and was\nanxious to rob him of his bride. The Serjeant retired for a moment\nto an inner room, while the tailor girded up his loins and prepared\nhimself for battle.\n\n\"Mr. Thwaite,\" said the Serjeant, as he re-entered the room, \"you\nprobably know that I have been counsel for Lady Lovel and her\ndaughter in the late trial.\" Daniel assented by a nod of his head.\n\"My connection with the Countess would naturally have been then\nclosed. We have gained our cause, and there would be an end of it.\nBut as things have turned out it has been otherwise. Lady Anna Lovel\nhas been staying with Mrs. Bluestone.\"\n\n\"In Bedford Square?\"\n\n\"Yes, at my house.\"\n\n\"I did not know. The Countess told me she was not in Keppel Street,\nbut refused to inform me where she was staying. I should not have\ninterfered with her ladyship's plans, had she been less secret with\nme.\"\n\n\"Surely it was unnecessary that she should tell you.\"\n\n\"Quite unnecessary;--but hardly unnatural after all that has\noccurred. As the Countess is with you only a friend of late date, you\nare probably unaware of the former friendship which existed between\nus. There was a time in which I certainly did not think that Lady\nLovel would ever decline to speak to me about her daughter. But all\nthis is nothing to you, Serjeant Bluestone.\"\n\n\"It is something to me, Mr. Thwaite, as her friend. Is there no\nreason why she should have treated you thus? Ask your own\nconscience.\"\n\n\"My conscience is clear in the matter.\"\n\n\"I have sent for you here, Mr. Thwaite, to ask you whether you cannot\nyourself understand that this which you have proposed to do must\nmake you an enemy to the Countess, and annul and set aside all that\nkindness which you have shown her? I put it to your own reason. Do\nyou think it possible that the Countess should be otherwise than\noutraged at the proposition you have made to her?\"\n\n\"I have made no proposition to her ladyship.\"\n\n\"Have you made none to her daughter?\"\n\n\"Certainly I have. I have asked her to be my wife.\"\n\n\"Come, Mr. Thwaite, do not palter with me.\"\n\n\"Palter with you! Who dares to say that I palter? I have never\npaltered. Paltering is--lying, as I take it. Let the Countess be my\nenemy. I have not said that she should not be so. She might have\nanswered my letter, I think, when the old man died. In our rank of\nlife we should have done so. It may be different with lords and\ntitled ladies. Let it pass, however. I did not mean to make any\ncomplaint. I came here because you sent for me.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I did send for you,\" said the Serjeant, wishing with all his\nheart that he had never been persuaded to take a step which imposed\nupon him so great a difficulty. \"I did send for you. Lady Anna Lovel\nhas expressed a wish to see you, before she leaves London.\"\n\n\"I will wait upon Lady Anna Lovel.\"\n\n\"I need hardly tell you that her wish has been opposed by her\nfriends.\"\n\n\"No doubt it was.\"\n\n\"But she has said with so much earnestness that she cannot consider\nherself to be absolved from the promise which she made to you when\nshe was a child--\"\n\n\"She was no child when she made it.\"\n\n\"It does not signify. She cannot be absolved from the promise which I\nsuppose she did make--\"\n\n\"She certainly made it, Serjeant Bluestone.\"\n\n\"Will you allow me to continue my statement? It will not occupy you\nlong. She assures her mother that she cannot consider herself to be\nabsolved from that promise without your sanction. She has been living\nin my house for some weeks, and I do not myself doubt in the least\nthat were she thus freed an alliance would soon be arranged between\nher and her cousin.\"\n\n\"I have heard of that--alliance.\"\n\n\"It would be in every respect a most satisfactory and happy marriage.\nThe young Earl has behaved with great consideration and forbearance\nin abstaining from pushing his claims.\"\n\n\"In abstaining from asking for that which he did not believe to be\nhis own.\"\n\n\"You had better hear me to the end, Mr. Thwaite. All the friends of\nthe two young people desire it. The Earl himself is warmly attached\nto his cousin.\"\n\n\"So am I,--and have been for many years.\"\n\n\"We all believe that she loves him.\"\n\n\"Let her say so to me, Serjeant Bluestone, and there shall be an end\nof it all. It seems to me that Lord Lovel and I have different ideas\nabout a woman. I would not take the hand of a girl who told me that\nshe loved another man, even though she was as dear to me, as,--as\nLady Anna is dear to me now. And as for what she might have in\nher hand, it would go for naught with me, though I might have to\nface beggary without her. It seems to me that Lord Lovel is less\nparticular in this matter.\"\n\n\"I do not see that you and I have anything to do with that,\" replied\nthe Serjeant, hardly knowing what to say.\n\n\"I have nothing to do with Lord Lovel, certainly,--nor has he with\nme. As to his cousin,--it is for her to choose.\"\n\n\"We think,--I am only telling you what we think;--but we think, Mr.\nThwaite, that the young lady's affections are fixed on her cousin. It\nis natural that they should be so; and watching her as closely as we\ncan, we believe such to be the case. I will be quite on the square\nwith you, Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"With me and with everybody else, I hope, Serjeant Bluestone.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said the Serjeant, laughing; \"but at any rate I will\nbe so with you now. We have been unable to get from Lady Anna any\ncertain reply,--any assurance of her own wishes. She has told her\nmother that she cannot accept Lord Lovel's addresses till she has\nseen you.\" The Serjeant in this was not quite on the square, as Lady\nAnna had never said so. \"We believe that she considers it necessary,\nto her conscience, to be made free by your permission, before she can\nfollow her own inclinations and accede to those of all her friends.\"\n\n\"She shall have my permission in a moment,--if she will ask for it.\"\n\n\"Could you not be more generous even than that?\"\n\n\"How more generous, Serjeant Bluestone?\"\n\n\"Offer it to her unasked. You have already said that you would\nnot accept her hand if you did not believe that you had her heart\nalso,--and the sentiment did you honour. Think of her condition, and\nbe generous to her.\"\n\n\"Generous to her! You mean generous to Lady Lovel,--generous to Lord\nLovel,--generous to all the Lovels except her. It seems to me that\nall the generosity is to be on one side.\"\n\n\"By no means. We can be generous too.\"\n\n\"If that be generosity, I will be generous. I will offer her that\npermission. I will not wait till she asks for it. I will beg her to\ntell me if it be true that she loves this cousin, and if she can say\nthat it is true, she shall want no permission from me to be free. She\nshall be free.\"\n\n\"It is not a question, you see, between yourself and Lord Lovel. It\nis quite out of the question that she should in any event become your\nwife. Even had she power to do it--\"\n\n\"She has the power.\"\n\n\"Practically she has no such power, Mr. Thwaite. A young person such\nas Lady Anna Lovel is and must be under the control of her natural\nguardian. She is so altogether. Her mother could not,--and would\nnot,--constrain her to any marriage; but has quite sufficient power\nover her to prevent any marriage. Lady Anna has never for a moment\nsupposed that she could become your wife since she learned what were\nthe feelings of her mother and her family.\" The Serjeant certainly\ndid not keep his promise of being \"on the square.\" \"But your\ngenerosity is necessary to enable Lady Lovel to bring to a happy\ntermination all those sufferings with which her life has been\nafflicted.\"\n\n\"I do not owe much to the Countess; but if it be generous to do as I\nhave said I would do,--I will be generous. I will tell her daughter,\nwithout any question asked from her, that she is free to marry her\ncousin if she wishes.\"\n\nSo far the Serjeant, though he had not been altogether as truthful\nas he had promised, had been discreet. He had said nothing to set\nthe tailor vehemently against the Lovel interest, and had succeeded\nin obtaining a useful pledge. But, in his next attempt, he was less\nwise. \"I think, you know, Mr. Thwaite, that the Countess also has\nbeen generous.\"\n\n\"As how?\"\n\n\"You have received \u00c2\u00a39,000 already, I believe.\"\n\n\"I have received what I presume to be my own. If I have had more it\nshall be refunded.\"\n\n\"No;--no; by no means. Taking a liberal view of the matter, as the\nCountess was bound to do in honour, she was, I think, right in paying\nyou what she has paid.\"\n\n\"I want nothing from her in what you call honour. I want nothing\nliberal. If the money be not mine in common honesty she shall have it\nback again. I want nothing but my own.\"\n\n\"I think you are a little high flown, Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"I dare say I may be,--to the thinking of a lawyer.\"\n\n\"The Countess, who is in truth your friend,--and will always be your\nfriend if you will only be amenable to reason,--has been delighted\nto think that you are now in possession of a sum of money which will\nplace you above want.\"\n\n\"The Countess is very kind.\"\n\n\"And I can say more than that. She and all her friends are aware how\nmuch is due to your father's son. If you will only aid us in our\npresent project, if you will enable Lady Anna to become the wife of\nher cousin the Earl, much more shall be done than the mere payment\nof the debt which was due to you. It has been proposed to settle on\nyou for life an annuity of four hundred pounds a year. To this the\nCountess, Earl Lovel, and Lady Anna will all agree.\"\n\n\"Has the consent of Lady Anna been asked?\" demanded the tailor, in a\nvoice which was low, but which the Serjeant felt at the moment to be\ndangerous.\n\n\"You may take my word that it shall be forthcoming,\" said the\nSerjeant.\n\n\"I will take your word for nothing, Serjeant Bluestone. I do not\nthink that among you all, you would dare to make such a proposition\nto Lady Anna Lovel, and I wonder that you should dare to make it to\nme. What have you seen in me to lead you to suppose that I would sell\nmyself for a bribe? And how can you have been so unwise as to offer\nit after I have told you that she shall be free,--if she chooses to\nbe free? But it is all one. You deal in subterfuges till you think it\nimpossible that a man should be honest. You mine underground, till\nyour eyes see nothing in the open daylight. You walk crookedly, till\na straight path is an abomination to you. Four hundred a year is\nnothing to me for such a purpose as this,--would have been nothing\nto me even though no penny had been paid to me of the money which\nis my own. I can easily understand what it is that makes the Earl\nso devoted a lover. His devotion began when he had been told that\nthe money was hers and not his,--and that in no other way could he\nget it. Mine began when no one believed that she would ever have\na shilling for her fortune,--when all who bore her name and her\nmother's ridiculed their claim. Mine was growing when my father first\nasked me whether I grudged that he should spend all that he had in\ntheir behalf. Mine came from giving. His springs from the desire to\nget. Make the four hundred, four thousand;--make it eight thousand,\nSerjeant Bluestone, and offer it to him. I also will agree. With him\nyou may succeed. Good morning, Serjeant Bluestone. On Monday next I\nwill not be worse than my word,--even though you have offered me a\nbribe.\"\n\nThe Serjeant let the tailor go without a word further,--not, indeed,\nhaving a word to say. He had been insulted in his own chambers,--told\nthat his word was worthless, and his honesty questionable. But he\nhad been so told, that at the moment he had been unable to stop the\nspeaker. He had sat, and smiled, and stroked his chin, and looked\nat the tailor as though he had been endeavouring to comfort himself\nwith the idea that the man addressing him was merely an ignorant,\nhalf-mad, enthusiastic tailor, from whom decent conduct could not be\nexpected. He was still smiling when Daniel Thwaite closed the door,\nand he almost laughed as he asked his clerk whether that energetic\ngentleman had taken himself down-stairs. \"Oh, yes, sir; he glared\nat me when I opened the door, and rushed down four steps at a time.\"\nBut, on the whole, the Serjeant was contented with the interview. It\nwould, no doubt, have been better had he said nothing of the four\nhundred a year. But in the offering of bribes there is always that\ndanger. One can never be sure who will swallow his douceur at an easy\ngulp, so as hardly to betray an effort, and who will refuse even to\nopen his lips. And then the latter man has the briber so much at\nadvantage. When the luscious morsel has been refused, it is so easy\nto be indignant, so pleasant to be enthusiastically virtuous! The\nbribe had been refused, and so far the Serjeant had failed;--but the\ndesired promise had been made, and the Serjeant felt certain that it\nwould be kept. He did not doubt but that Daniel Thwaite would himself\noffer the girl her freedom. But there was something in the man,\nthough he was a tailor. He had an eye and a voice, and it might be\nthat freedom offered, as he could offer it, would not be accepted.\n\nDaniel, as he went out into the court from the lawyer's presence, was\nless satisfied than the lawyer. He had told the lawyer that his word\nwas worth nothing, and yet he had believed much that the lawyer had\nsaid to him. The lawyer had told him that the girl loved her cousin,\nand only wanted his permission to be free that she might give her\nhand and her heart together to the young lord. Was it not natural\nthat she should wish to do so? Within each hour, almost within\neach minute, he regarded the matter in lights that were perfectly\nantagonistic to each other. It was natural that she should wish to be\na Countess, and that she should love a young lord who was gentle and\nbeautiful;--and she should have his permission accorded freely. But\nthen, again, it was most unnatural, bestial, and almost monstrous,\nthat a girl should change her love for a man, going from one man to\nanother, simply because the latter man was gilt with gold, and decked\nwith jewels, and sweet with perfume from a hairdresser's. The poet\nmust have been wrong there. If love be anything but a dream, surely\nit must adhere to the person, and not be liable to change at every\noffered vantage of name or birth, of rank or wealth.\n\nBut she should have the offer. She should certainly have the offer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nTHE SERJEANT AND MRS. BLUESTONE AT HOME.\n\n\nLady Anna was not told till the Saturday that she was to meet her\nlover, the tailor, on the following Monday. She was living at\nthis time, as it were, in chains, though the chains were gilded.\nIt was possible that she might be off at any moment with Daniel\nThwaite,--and now the more possible because he had money at his\ncommand. If this should occur, then would the game which the Countess\nand her friends were playing, be altogether lost. Then would the\ncheckmate have been absolute. The reader will have known that such\na step had never been contemplated by the man, and will also have\nperceived that it would have been altogether opposed to the girl's\ncharacter; but it is hoped that the reader has looked more closely\ninto the man's motives and the girl's character than even her mother\nwas able to do. The Countess had thought that she had known her\ndaughter. She had been mistaken, and now there was hardly anything\nof which she could not suspect her girl to be capable. Lady Anna was\nwatched, therefore, during every minute of the four and twenty hours.\nA policeman was told off to protect the house at night from rope\nladders or any other less cumbrous ingenuity. The servants were set\non guard. Sarah, the lady's-maid, followed her mistress almost like\na ghost when the poor young lady went to her bedroom. Mrs. Bluestone,\nor one of the girls, was always with her, either indoors or out of\ndoors. Out of doors, indeed, she never went without more guards than\none. A carriage had been hired,--a luxury with which Mrs. Bluestone\nhad hitherto dispensed,--and the carriage was always there when Lady\nAnna suggested that she should like to leave the house. She was\nwarmly invited to go shopping, and made to understand that in the way\nof ordinary shopping she could buy what she pleased. But her life was\ninexpressibly miserable. \"What does mamma mean to do?\" she said to\nMrs. Bluestone on the Saturday morning.\n\n\"In what way, my dear?\"\n\n\"Where does she mean to go? She won't live always in Keppel Street?\"\n\n\"No,--I do not think that she will live always in Keppel Street. It\ndepends a good deal upon you, I think.\"\n\n\"I will go wherever she pleases to take me. The lawsuit is over now,\nand I don't know why we should stay here. I am sure you can't like\nit.\"\n\nTo tell the truth, Mrs. Bluestone did not like it at all.\nCircumstances had made her a gaoler, but by nature she was very ill\nconstituted for that office. The harshness of it was detestable to\nher, and then there was no reason whatever why she should sacrifice\nher domestic comfort for the Lovels. The thing had grown upon them,\ntill the Lovels had become an incubus to her. Personally, she liked\nLady Anna, but she was unable to treat Lady Anna as she would treat\nany other girl that she liked. She had told the Serjeant more than\nonce that she could not endure it much longer. And the Serjeant did\nnot like it better than did his wife. It was all a labour of love,\nand a most unpleasant labour. \"The Countess must take her away,\" the\nSerjeant had said. And now the Serjeant had been told by the tailor,\nin his own chambers, that his word was worth nothing!\n\n\"To tell you the truth, Lady Anna, we none of us like it,--not\nbecause we do not like you, but because the whole thing is\ndisagreeable. You are creating very great misery, my dear, because\nyou are obstinate.\"\n\n\"Because I won't marry my cousin?\"\n\n\"No, my dear; not because you won't marry your cousin. I have never\nadvised you to marry your cousin, unless you could love him. I don't\nthink girls should ever be told to marry this man or that. But it is\nvery proper that they should be told not to marry this man or that.\nYou are making everybody about you miserable, because you will not\ngive up a most improper engagement, made with a man who is in every\nrespect beneath you.\"\n\n\"I wish I were dead,\" said Lady Anna.\n\n\"It is very easy to say that, my dear; but what you ought to wish is,\nto do your duty.\"\n\n\"I do wish to do my duty, Mrs. Bluestone.\"\n\n\"It can't be dutiful to stand out against your mother in this way.\nYou are breaking your mother's heart. And if you were to do this\nthing, you would soon find that you had broken your own. It is\ndownright obstinacy. I don't like to be harsh, but as you are here,\nin my charge, I am bound to tell you the truth.\"\n\n\"I wish mamma would let me go away,\" said Lady Anna, bursting into\ntears.\n\n\"She will let you go at once, if you will only make the promise that\nshe asks of you.\" In saying this, Mrs. Bluestone was hardly more upon\nthe square than her husband had been, for she knew very well, at that\nmoment, that Lady Anna was to go to Keppel Street early on the Monday\nmorning, and she had quite made up her mind that her guest should not\ncome back to Bedford Square. She had now been moved to the special\nseverity which she had shown by certain annoyances of her own to\nwhich she had been subjected by the presence of Lady Anna in her\nhouse. She could neither entertain her friends nor go out to be\nentertained by them, and had told the Serjeant more than once that\na great mistake had been made in having the girl there at all. But\njudgment had operated with her as well as feeling. It was necessary\nthat Lady Anna should be made to understand before she saw the tailor\nthat she could not be happy, could not be comfortable, could not be\nother than very wretched,--till she had altogether dismissed her\nlow-born lover.\n\n\"I did not think you would be so unkind to me,\" sobbed Lady Anna\nthrough her tears.\n\n\"I do not mean to be unkind, but you must be told the truth. Every\nminute that you spend in thinking of that man is a disgrace to you.\"\n\n\"Then I shall be disgraced all my life,\" said Lady Anna, bursting out\nof the room.\n\nOn that day the Serjeant dined at his club, but came home about nine\no'clock. It had all been planned so that the information might be\ngiven in the most solemn manner possible. The two girls were sitting\nup in the drawing-room with the guest who, since the conversation in\nthe morning, had only seen Mrs. Bluestone during dinner. First there\nwas the knock at the door, and then, after a quarter of an hour,\nwhich was spent up-stairs in perfect silence, there came a message.\nWould Lady Anna have the kindness to go to the Serjeant in the\ndining-room. In silence she left the room, and in silence descended\nthe broad staircase. The Serjeant and Mrs. Bluestone were sitting\non one side of the fireplace, the Serjeant in his own peculiar\narm-chair, and the lady close to the fender, while a seat opposite to\nthem had been placed for Lady Anna. The room was gloomy with dark red\ncurtains and dark flock paper. On the table there burned two candles,\nand no more. The Serjeant got up and motioned Lady Anna to a chair.\nAs soon as she had seated herself, he began his speech. \"My dear\nyoung lady, you must be no doubt aware that you are at present\ncausing a great deal of trouble to your best friends.\"\n\n\"I don't want to cause anybody trouble,\" said Lady Anna, thinking\nthat the Serjeant in speaking of her best friends alluded to himself\nand his wife. \"I only want to go away.\"\n\n\"I am coming to that directly, my dear. I cannot suppose that you\ndo not understand the extent of the sorrow that you have inflicted\non your parent by,--by the declaration which you made to Lord Lovel\nin regard to Mr. Daniel Thwaite.\" There is nothing, perhaps, in the\nway of exhortation and scolding which the ordinary daughter,--or\nson,--dislikes so much as to be told of her, or his, \"parent.\" \"My\ndear fellow, your father will be annoyed,\" is taken in good part.\n\"What will mamma say?\" is seldom received amiss. But when young\npeople have their \"parents\" thrown at them, they feel themselves\nto be aggrieved, and become at once antagonistic. Lady Anna became\nstrongly antagonistic. If her mother, who had always been to her\nher \"own, own mamma,\" was going to be her parent, there must be an\nend of all hope of happiness. She said nothing, but compressed her\nlips together. She would not allow herself to be led an inch any\nway by a man who talked to her of her parent. \"The very idea of\nsuch a marriage as this man had suggested to you under the guise\nof friendship was dreadful to her. It could be no more than an\nidea;--but that you should have entertained it was dreadful. She has\nsince asked you again and again to repudiate the idea, and hitherto\nyou have refused to obey.\"\n\n\"I can never know what mamma really wants till I go and live with her\nagain.\"\n\n\"I am coming to that, Lady Anna. The Countess has informed Mrs.\nBluestone that you had refused to give the desired promise unless you\nshould be allowed to see Mr. Daniel Thwaite, intimating, I presume,\nthat his permission would be necessary to free you from your\nimaginary bond to him.\"\n\n\"It would be necessary.\"\n\n\"Very well. The Countess naturally felt an abhorrence at allowing\nyou again to be in the presence of one so much beneath you,--who\nhad ventured to address you as he has done. It was a most natural\nfeeling. But it has occurred to Mrs. Bluestone and myself, that as\nyou entertain this idea of an obligation, you should be allowed to\nextricate yourself from it after your own fashion. You are to meet\nMr. Thwaite,--on Monday,--at eleven o'clock,--in Keppel Street.\"\n\n\"And I am not to come back again?\"\n\nWhen one executes the office of gaoler without fee or reward, giving\nup to one's prisoner one's best bedroom, and having a company dinner,\nmore or less, cooked for one's prisoner every day, one does not like\nto be told too plainly of the anticipated joys of enfranchisement.\nMrs. Bluestone, who had done her best both for the mother and the\ngirl, and had done it all from pure motherly sympathy, was a little\nhurt. \"I am sure, Lady Anna, we shall not wish you to return,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Bluestone, you don't understand me. I don't think you know\nhow unhappy I am because of mamma.\"\n\nMrs. Bluestone relented at once. \"If you will only do as your mamma\nwishes, everything will be made happy for you.\"\n\n\"Mr. Thwaite will be in Keppel Street at eleven o'clock on Monday,\"\ncontinued the Serjeant, \"and an opportunity will then be given you\nof obtaining from him a release from that unfortunate promise which\nI believe you once made him. I may tell you that he has expressed\nhimself willing to give you that release. The debt due to him, or\nrather to his late father, has now been paid by the estate, and\nI think you will find that he will make no difficulty. After that\nanything that he may require shall be done to forward his views.\"\n\n\"Am I to take my things?\" she asked.\n\n\"Sarah shall pack them up, and they shall be sent after you if it be\ndecided that you are to stay with Lady Lovel.\" They then went to bed.\n\nIn all this neither the Serjeant nor his wife had been \"on the\nsquare.\" Neither of them had spoken truly to the girl. Mrs. Bluestone\nhad let the Countess know that with all her desire to assist her\nladyship, and her ladyship's daughter, she could not receive Lady\nAnna back in Bedford Square. As for that sending of her things upon\ncertain conditions,--it was a simple falsehood. The things would\ncertainly be sent. And the Serjeant, without uttering an actual lie,\nhad endeavoured to make the girl think that the tailor was in pursuit\nof money,--and of money only, though he must have known that it was\nnot so. The Serjeant no doubt hated a lie,--as most of us do hate\nlies; and had a strong conviction that the devil is the father of\nthem. But then the lies which he hated, and as to the parentage of\nwhich he was quite certain, were lies told to him. Who yet ever met\na man who did not in his heart of hearts despise an attempt made by\nothers to deceive--himself? They whom we have found to be gentler in\ntheir judgment towards attempts made in another direction have been\nmore than one or two. The object which the Serjeant had in view was\nso good that it seemed to him to warrant some slight deviation from\nparallelogrammatic squareness;--though he held it as one of his first\nrules of life that the end cannot justify the means.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nIT IS STILL TRUE.\n\n\nOn Sunday they all went to church, and not a word was said about the\ntailor. Alice Bluestone was tender and valedictory; Mrs. Bluestone\nwas courteous and careful; the Serjeant was solemn and civil. Before\nthe day was over Lady Anna was quite sure that it was not intended\nthat she should come back to Bedford Square. Words were said by the\ntwo girls, and by Sarah the waiting-maid, which made it certain that\nthe packing up was to be a real packing up. No hindrance was offered\nto her when she busied herself about her own dresses and folded up\nher stock of gloves and ribbons. On Monday morning after breakfast,\nMrs. Bluestone nearly broke down. \"I am sure, my dear,\" she said,\n\"we have liked you very much, and if there has been anything\nuncomfortable it has been from unfortunate circumstances.\" The\nSerjeant bade God bless her when he walked off half an hour before\nthe carriage came to take her, and she knew that she was to sit no\nlonger as a guest at the Serjeant's table. She kissed the girls, was\nkissed by Mrs. Bluestone, got into the carriage with the maid, and in\nher heart said good-bye to Bedford Square for ever.\n\nIt was but three minutes' drive from the Serjeant's house to that in\nwhich her mother lived, and in that moment of time she was hardly\nable to realise the fact that within half an hour she would be once\nmore in the presence of Daniel Thwaite. She did not at present at all\nunderstand why this thing was to be done. When last she had seen her\nmother, the Countess had solemnly declared, had almost sworn, that\nthey two should never see each other again. And now the meeting was\nso close at hand that the man must already be near her. She put up\nher face to the carriage window as though she almost expected to\nsee him on the pavement. And how would the meeting be arranged?\nWould her mother be present? She took it for granted that her\nmother would be present. She certainly anticipated no pleasure from\nthe meeting,--though she would be glad, very glad, to see Daniel\nThwaite once again. Before she had time to answer herself a question\nthe carriage had stopped, and she could see her mother at the\ndrawing-room window. She trembled as she went up-stairs, and hardly\ncould speak when she found herself in her mother's presence. If her\nmother had worn the old brown gown it would have been better, but\nthere she was, arrayed in black silk,--in silk that was new and stiff\nand broad and solemn,--a parent rather than a mother, and every inch\na Countess. \"I am so glad to be with you again, mamma.\"\n\n\"I shall not be less glad to have you with me, Anna,--if you will\nbehave yourself with propriety.\"\n\n\"Give me a kiss, mamma.\" Then the Countess bent her head and allowed\nher daughter's lips to touch her cheeks. In old days,--days that were\nnot so very old,--she would kiss her child as though such embraces\nwere the only food that nourished her.\n\n\"Come up-stairs, and I will show you your room.\" Then the daughter\nfollowed the mother in solemn silence. \"You have heard that Mr.\nDaniel Thwaite is coming here, to see you, at your own request. It\nwill not be many minutes before he is here. Take off your bonnet.\"\nAgain Lady Anna silently did as she was bid. \"It would have been\nbetter,--very much better,--that you should have done as you were\ndesired without subjecting me to this indignity. But as you have\ntaken into your head an idea that you cannot be absolved from an\nimpossible engagement without his permission, I have submitted. Do\nnot let it be long, and let me hear then that all this nonsense is\nover. He has got what he desires, as a very large sum of money has\nbeen paid to him.\" Then there came a knock at the door from Sarah,\nwho just showed her face to say that Mr. Thwaite was in the room\nbelow. \"Now go down. In ten minutes I shall expect to see you here\nagain;--or, after that, I shall come down to you.\" Lady Anna took her\nmother by the hand, looking up with beseeching eyes into her mother's\nface. \"Go, my dear, and let this be done as quickly as possible. I\nbelieve that you have too great a sense of propriety to let him do\nmore than speak to you. Remember,--you are the daughter of an earl;\nand remember also all that I have done to establish your right for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Mamma, I do not know what to do. I am afraid.\"\n\n\"Shall I go with you, Anna?\"\n\n\"No, mamma;--it will be better without you. You do not know how good\nhe is.\"\n\n\"If he will abandon this madness he shall be my friend of friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, I am afraid. But I had better go.\" Then, trembling she\nleft the room and slowly descended the stairs. She had certainly\nspoken the truth in saying that she was afraid. Up to this moment\nshe had not positively made up her mind whether she would or would\nnot yield to the entreaties of her friends. She had decided upon\nnothing,--leaving in fact the arbitrament of her faith in the hands\nof the man who had now come to see her. Throughout all that had been\nsaid and done her sympathies had been with him, and had become the\nstronger the more her friends had reviled him. She knew that they had\nspoken evil of him, not because he was evil,--but with the unholy\nview of making her believe what was false. She had seen through all\nthis, and had been aroused by it to a degree of firmness of which\nher mother had not imagined her to be capable. Had they confined\nthemselves to the argument of present fitness, admitting the truth\nand honesty of the man,--and admitting also that his love for her and\nhers for him had been the natural growth of the familiar friendship\nof their childhood and youth, their chance of moulding her to their\npurposes would have been better. As it was they had never argued with\nher on the subject without putting forward some statement which she\nfound herself bound to combat. She was told continually that she had\ndegraded herself; and she could understand that another Lady Anna\nmight degrade herself most thoroughly by listening to the suit of\na tailor. But she had not disgraced herself. Of that she was sure,\nthough she could not well explain to them her reasons when they\naccused her. Circumstances, and her mother's mode of living, had\nthrown her into intimacy with this man. For all practical purposes\nof life he had been her equal,--and being so had become her dearest\nfriend. To take his hand, to lean on his arm, to ask his assistance,\nto go to him in her troubles, to listen to his words and to believe\nthem, to think of him as one who might always be trusted, had\nbecome a second nature to her. Of course she loved him. And now\nthe martyrdom through which she had passed in Bedford Square had\nchanged,--unconsciously as regarded her own thoughts,--but still\nhad changed her feelings in regard to her cousin. He was not to her\nnow the bright and shining thing, the godlike Phoebus, which he had\nbeen in Wyndham Street and at Yoxham. In all their lectures to her\nabout her title and grandeur they had succeeded in inculcating an\nidea of the solemnity of rank, but had robbed it in her eyes of all\nits grace. She had only been the more tormented because the fact of\nher being Lady Anna Lovel had been fully established. The feeling in\nher bosom which was most hostile to the tailor's claim upon her was\nher pity for her mother.\n\nShe entered the room very gently, and found him standing by the\ntable, with his hands clasped together. \"Sweetheart!\" he said, as\nsoon as he saw her, calling her by a name which he used to use when\nthey were out in the fields together in Cumberland.\n\n\"Daniel!\" Then he came to her and took her hand. \"If you have\nanything to say, Daniel, you must be very quick, because mamma will\ncome in ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Have you anything to say, sweetheart?\" She had much to say if she\nonly knew how to say it; but she was silent. \"Do you love me, Anna?\"\nStill she was silent. \"If you have ceased to love me, pray tell me\nso,--in all honesty.\" But yet she was silent. \"If you are true to\nme,--as I am to you, with all my heart,--will you not tell me so?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she murmured.\n\nHe heard her, though no other could have done so.\n\n\n   \"A lover's ears will hear the lowest sound\n    When the suspicious head of theft is stopped.\"\n\n\n\"If so,\" said he, again taking her hand, \"this story they have told\nme is untrue.\"\n\n\"What story, Daniel?\" But she withdrew her hand quickly as she asked\nhim.\n\n\"Nay;--it is mine; it shall be mine if you love me, dear. I will\ntell you what story. They have said that you love your cousin, Earl\nLovel.\"\n\n\"No;\" said she scornfully, \"I have never said so. It is not true.\"\n\n\"You cannot love us both.\" His eye was fixed upon hers, that eye to\nwhich in past years she had been accustomed to look for guidance,\nsometimes in joy and sometimes in fear, and which she had always\nobeyed. \"Is not that true?\"\n\n\"Oh yes;--that is true of course.\"\n\n\"You have never told him that you loved him.\"\n\n\"Oh, never.\"\n\n\"But you have told me so,--more than once; eh, sweetheart?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And it was true?\"\n\nShe paused a moment, and then gave him the same answer, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"And it is still true?\"\n\nShe repeated the word a third time. \"Yes.\" But she again so spoke\nthat none but a lover's ear could have heard it.\n\n\"If it be so, nothing but the hand of God shall separate us. You\nknow that they sent for me to come here.\" She nodded her head. \"Do\nyou know why? In order that I might abandon my claim to your hand.\nI will never give it up. But I made them a promise, and I will keep\nit. I told them that if you preferred Lord Lovel to me, I would at\nonce make you free of your promise,--that I would offer to you such\nfreedom, if it would be freedom. I do offer it to you;--or rather,\nAnna, I would have offered it, had you not already answered the\nquestion. How can I offer it now?\" Then he paused, and stood\nregarding her with fixed eyes. \"But there,--there; take back your\nword if you will. If you think that it is better to be the wife of a\nlord, because he is a lord, though you do not love him, than to lie\nupon the breast of the man you do love,--you are free from me.\" Now\nwas the moment in which she must obey her mother, and satisfy her\nfriends, and support her rank, and decide that she would be one of\nthe noble ladies of England, if such decision were to be made at\nall. She looked up into his face, and thought that after all it was\nhandsomer than that of the young Earl. He stood thus with dilated\nnostrils, and fire in his eyes, and his lips just parted, and his\nhead erect,--a very man. Had she been so minded she would not have\ndared to take his offer. They surely had not known the man when they\nallowed him to have this interview. He repeated his words. \"You are\nfree if you will say so;--but you must answer me.\"\n\n\"I did answer you, Daniel.\"\n\n\"My noble girl! And now, my heart's only treasure, I may speak out\nand tell you what I think. It cannot be good that a woman should\npurchase rank and wealth by giving herself to a man she does not\nlove. It must be bad,--monstrously bad. I never believed it when they\ntold it me of you. And yet when I did not hear of you or see you for\nmonths--\"\n\n\"It was not my fault.\"\n\n\"No, sweetheart;--and I tried to find comfort by so saying to myself.\n'If she really loves me, she will be true,' I said. And yet who was I\nthat I should think that you would suffer so much for me? But I will\nrepay you,--if the truth and service of a life may repay such a debt\nas that. At any rate hear this from me;--I will never doubt again.\"\nAnd as he spoke he was moving towards her, thinking to take her in\nhis arms, when the door was opened and Countess Lovel was within the\nroom. The tailor was the first to speak. \"Lady Lovel, I have asked\nyour daughter, and I find that it is her wish to adhere to the\nengagement which she made with me in Cumberland. I need hardly say\nthat it is my wish also.\"\n\n\"Anna! Is this true?\"\n\n\"Mamma; mamma! Oh, mamma!\"\n\n\"If it be so I will never speak word to you more.\"\n\n\"You will; you will! Do not look at me like that. You will speak to\nme!\"\n\n\"You shall never again be child of mine.\" But in saying this she had\nforgotten herself, and now she remembered her proper cue. \"I do not\nbelieve a word of it. The man has come here and has insulted and\nfrightened you. He knows,--he must know,--that such a marriage is\nimpossible. It can never take place. It shall never take place. Mr.\nThwaite, as you are a living man, you shall never live to marry my\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"My lady, in this matter of marriage your daughter must no doubt\ndecide for herself. Even now, by all the laws of God,--and I believe\nof man too,--she is beyond your control either to give her in\nmarriage or to withhold her. In a few months she will be as much her\nown mistress as you now are yours.\"\n\n\"Sir, I am not asking you about my child. You are insolent.\"\n\n\"I came here, Lady Lovel, because I was sent for.\"\n\n\"And now you had better leave us. You made a promise which you have\nbroken.\"\n\n\"By heavens, no. I made a promise and I have kept it. I said that I\nwould offer her freedom, and I have done so. I told her, and I tell\nher again now, that if she will say that she prefers her cousin to\nme, I will retire.\" The Countess looked at him and also recognised\nthe strength of his face, almost feeling that the man had grown in\npersonal dignity since he had received the money that was due to him.\n\"She does not prefer the Earl. She has given her heart to me; and\nI hold it,--and will hold it. Look up, dear, and tell your mother\nwhether what I say be true.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Lady Anna.\n\n\"Then may the blight of hell rest upon you both!\" said the Countess,\nrushing to the door. But she returned. \"Mr. Thwaite,\" she said, \"I\nwill trouble you at once to leave the house, and never more to return\nto it.\"\n\n\"I will leave it certainly. Good bye, my own love.\" He attempted\nagain to take the girl by the hand, but the Countess, with violence,\nrushed at them and separated them. \"If you but touch him, I will\nstrike you,\" she said to her daughter. \"As for you, it is her money\nthat you want. If it be necessary, you shall have, not hers, but\nmine. Now go.\"\n\n\"That is a slander, Lady Lovel. I want no one's money. I want the\ngirl I love,--whose heart I have won; and I will have her. Good\nmorning, Lady Lovel. Dear, dear Anna, for this time good bye. Do not\nlet any one make you think that I can ever be untrue to you.\" The\ngirl only looked at him. Then he left the room; and the mother and\nthe daughter were alone together. The Countess stood erect, looking\nat her child, while Lady Anna, standing also, kept her eyes fixed\nupon the ground. \"Am I to believe it all,--as that man says?\" asked\nthe Countess.\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that you have renewed your engagement to that\nlow-born wretch?\"\n\n\"Mamma,--he is not a wretch.\"\n\n\"Do you contradict me? After all, is it come to this?\"\n\n\"Mamma,--you, you--cursed me.\"\n\n\"And you will be cursed. Do you think that you will do such\nwickedness as this, that you can destroy all that I have done for\nyou, that you make yourself the cause of ruin to a whole family, and\nthat you will not be punished for it? You say that you love me.\"\n\n\"You know that I love you, mamma.\"\n\n\"And yet you do not scruple to drive me mad.\"\n\n\"Mamma, it was you who brought us together.\"\n\n\"Ungrateful child! Where else could I take you then?\"\n\n\"But I was there,--and of course I loved him. I could not cease to\nlove him because,--because they say that I am a grand lady.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Anna. You shall never marry him; never. With my own\nhands I will kill him first;--or you.\" The girl stood looking into\nher mother's face, and trembling. \"Do you understand that?\"\n\n\"You do not mean it, mamma.\"\n\n\"By the God above me, I do! Do you think that I will stop at anything\nnow;--after having done so much? Do you think that I will live to see\nmy daughter the wife of a foul, sweltering tailor? No, by heavens! He\ntells you that when you are twenty-one, you will not be subject to my\ncontrol. I warn you to look to it. I will not lose my control, unless\nwhen I see you married to some husband fitting your condition in\nlife. For the present you will live in your own room, as I will live\nin mine. I will hold no intercourse whatever with you, till I have\nconstrained you to obey me.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nLET HER DIE.\n\n\nAfter the scene which was described in the last chapter there was a\nvery sad time indeed in Keppel Street. The Countess had been advised\nby the Serjeant and Mrs. Bluestone to take her daughter immediately\nabroad, in the event of the interview with Daniel Thwaite being\nunsatisfactory. It was believed by all concerned, by the Bluestones,\nand the Goffes, by Sir William Patterson who had been told of the\ncoming interview, and by the Countess herself, that this would not\nbe the case. They had all thought that Lady Anna would come out\nfrom that meeting disengaged and free to marry whom she would,--and\nthey thought also that within a very few weeks of her emancipation\nshe would accept her cousin's hand. The Solicitor-General had\ncommunicated with the Earl, who was still in town, and the Earl again\nbelieved that he might win the heiress. But should the girl prove\nobstinate;--\"take her away at once,--very far away;--to Rome, or some\nsuch place as that.\" Such had been Mrs. Bluestone's advice, and in\nthose days Rome was much more distant than it is now. \"And don't let\nanybody know where you are going,\" added the Serjeant,--\"except Mr.\nGoffe.\" The Countess had assented;--but when the moment came, there\nwere reasons against her sudden departure. Mr. Goffe told her that\nshe must wait at any rate for another fortnight. The presence of\nherself and her daughter were necessary in London for the signing\nof deeds and for the completion of the now merely formal proofs of\nidentity. And money was again scarce. A great deal of money had been\nspent lately, and unless money was borrowed without security, and at\na great cost,--to which Mr. Goffe was averse,--the sum needed could\nhardly be provided at once. Mr. Goffe recommended that no day earlier\nthan the 20th December should be fixed for their departure.\n\nIt was now the end of November; and it became a question how the\nintermediate time should be passed. The Countess was resolved that\nshe would hold no pleasant intercourse at all with her daughter. She\nwould not even tell the girl of her purpose of going abroad. From\nhour to hour she assured herself with still increasing obduracy that\nnothing but severity could avail anything. The girl must be cowed\nand frightened into absolute submission,--even though at the expense\nof her health. Even though it was to be effected by the absolute\ncrushing of her spirits,--this must be done. Though at the cost of\nher life, it must be done. This woman had lived for the last twenty\nyears with but one object before her eyes,--an object sometimes\nseeming to be near, more often distant, and not unfrequently\naltogether beyond her reach, but which had so grown upon her\nimagination as to become the heaven to which her very soul aspired.\nTo be and to be known to be among the highly born, the so-called\nnoble, the titled from old dates,--to be of those who were purely\naristocratic, had been all the world to her. As a child,--the\nchild of well-born but poor parents, she had received the idea. In\nfollowing it out she had thrown all thoughts of love to the wind and\nhad married a reprobate earl. Then had come her punishment,--or, as\nshe had conceived it, her most unmerited misfortunes. For many years\nof her life her high courage and persistent demeanour had almost\natoned for the vice of her youth. The love of rank was strong in her\nbosom as ever, but it was fostered for her child rather than for\nherself. Through long, tedious, friendless, poverty-stricken years\nshe had endured all, still assuring herself that the day would come\nwhen the world should call the sweet plant that grew by her side\nby its proper name. The little children hooted after her daughter,\ncalling her girl in derision The Lady Anna,--when Lady Anna had been\nmore poorly clad and blessed with less of the comforts of home than\nany of them. Years would roll by, and they should live to know that\nthe Lady Anna,--the sport of their infantine cruelty,--was Lady\nAnna indeed. And as the girl became a woman the dream was becoming\na reality. The rank, the title, the general acknowledgment and\nthe wealth would all be there. Then came the first great decisive\ntriumph. Overtures of love and friendship were made from the other\nside. Would Lady Anna consent to become the Countess Lovel, all\nanimosities might be buried, and everything be made pleasant,\nprosperous, noble, and triumphant!\n\nIt is easy to fill with air a half-inflated bladder. It is already so\nbuoyant with its own lightness, that it yields itself with ease to\nreceive the generous air. The imagination of the woman flew higher\nthan ever it had flown when the proposition came home to her in all\nits bearings. Of course it had been in her mind that her daughter\nshould marry well;--but there had been natural fears. Her child had\nnot been educated, had not lived, had not been surrounded in her\nyoung days, as are those girls from whom the curled darlings are wont\nto choose their wives. She would too probably be rough in manner,\nungentle in speech, ungifted in accomplishments, as compared with\nthose who from their very cradles are encompassed by the blessings of\nwealth and high social standing. But when she looked at her child's\nbeauty, she would hope. And then her child was soft, sweet-humoured,\nwinning in all her little ways, pretty even in the poor duds which\nwere supplied to her mainly by the generosity of the tailor. And so\nshe would hope, and sometimes despair;--and then hope again. But she\nhad never hoped for anything so good as this. Such a marriage would\nnot only put her daughter as high as a Lovel ought to be, but would\nmake it known in a remarkable manner to all coming ages that she, she\nherself, she the despised and slandered one,--who had been treated\nalmost as woman had never been treated before,--was in very truth the\nCountess Lovel by whose income the family had been restored to its\nold splendour.\n\nAnd so the longing grew upon her. Then, almost for the first time,\ndid she begin to feel that it was necessary for the purposes of her\nlife that the girl whom she loved so thoroughly, should be a creature\nin her hands, to be dealt with as she pleased. She would have had her\ndaughter accede to the proposed marriage even before she had seen\nLord Lovel, and was petulant when her daughter would not be as clay\nin the sculptor's hand. But still the girl's refusal had been but as\nthe refusal of a girl. She should not have been as are other girls.\nShe should have known better. She should have understood what the\npeculiarity of her position demanded. But it had not been so with\nher. She had not soared as she should have done, above the love-laden\ndreams of common maidens. And so the visit to Yoxham was permitted.\nThen came the great blow,--struck as it were by a third hand, and\nthat the hand of an attorney. The Countess Lovel learned through Mr.\nGoffe,--who had heard the tale from other lawyers,--that her daughter\nLady Anna Lovel had, with her own mouth, told her noble lover that\nshe was betrothed to a tailor! She felt at the moment that she could\nhave died,--cursing her child for this black ingratitude.\n\nBut there might still be hope. The trial was going on,--or the work\nwhich was progressing towards the trial, and she was surrounded by\nthose who could advise her. Doubtless what had happened was a great\nmisfortune. But there was room for hope;--room for most assured hope.\nThe Earl was not disposed to abandon the match, though he had, of\ncourse, been greatly annoyed,--nay, disgusted and degraded by the\ngirl's communication. But he had consented to see the matter in the\nproper light. The young tailor had got an influence over the girl\nwhen she was a child, was doubtless in pursuit of money, and must\nbe paid. The folly of a child might be forgiven, and the Earl would\npersevere. No one would know what had occurred, and the thing would\nbe forgotten as a freak of childhood. The Countess had succumbed to\nthe policy of all this;--but she was not deceived by the benevolent\nfalsehood. Lady Anna had been over twenty when she had been receiving\nlover's vows from this man, reeking from his tailor's board. And her\ngirl, her daughter, had deceived her. That the girl had deceived her,\nsaying there was no other lover, was much; but it was much more and\nworse and more damnable that there had been thorough deception as\nto the girl's own appreciation of her rank. The sympathy tendered\nthrough so many years must have been always pretended sympathy. With\nthese feelings hot within her bosom, she could not bring herself to\nspeak one kindly word to Lady Anna after the return from Yoxham. The\ngirl was asked to abandon her odious lover with stern severity. It\nwas demanded of her that she should do so with cruel threats. She\nwould never quite yield, though she had then no strength of purpose\nsufficient to enable her to declare that she would not yield. We know\nhow she was banished to Bedford Square, and transferred from the\nruthless persistency of her mother, to the less stern but not less\nfixed manoeuvres of Mrs. Bluestone. At that moment of her existence\nshe was herself in doubt. In Wyndham Street and at Yoxham she had\nalmost more than doubted. The softness of the new Elysium had well\nnigh unnerved her. When that young man had caught her from stone to\nstone as she passed over the ford at Bolton, she was almost ready\nto give herself to him. But then had come upon her the sense of\nsickness, that faint, overdone flavour of sugared sweetness, which\narises when sweet things become too luscious to the eater. She had\nstruggled to be honest and strong, and had just not fallen into the\npot of treacle.\n\nBut, notwithstanding all this, they who saw her and knew the story,\nwere still sure that the lord must at last win the day. There was not\none who believed that such a girl could be true to such a troth as\nshe had made. Even the Solicitor-General, when he told the tale which\nthe amorous steward had remembered to his own encouragement, did not\nthink but what the girl and the girl's fortune would fall into the\nhands of his client. Human nature demanded that it should be so.\nThat it should be as he wished it was so absolutely consonant with\nall nature as he had known it, that he had preferred trusting to\nthis result, in his client's behalf, to leaving the case in a jury's\nhands. At this moment he was sure he was right in his judgment. And\nindeed he was right;--for no jury could have done anything for his\nclient.\n\nIt went on till at last the wise men decided that the girl only\nwanted to be relieved by her old lover, that she might take a new\nlover with his permission. The girl was no doubt peculiar; but, as\nfar as the wise ones could learn from her manner,--for with words\nshe would say nothing,--that was her state of mind. So the interview\nwas planned,--to the infinite disgust of the Countess, who, however,\nbelieved that it might avail; and we know what was the result. Lady\nAnna, who long had doubted,--who had at last almost begun to doubt\nwhether Daniel Thwaite was true to her,--had renewed her pledges,\nstrengthened her former promises, and was now more firmly betrothed\nthan ever to him whom the Countess hated as a very fiend upon earth.\nBut there certainly should be no marriage! Though she pistolled the\nman at the altar, there should be no marriage.\n\nAnd then there came upon her the infinite disgust arising from\nthe necessity of having to tell her sorrows to others,--who could\nnot sympathize with her, though their wishes were as hers. It was\nhard upon her that no step could be taken by her in reference\nto her daughter without the knowledge of Mr. Goffe and Serjeant\nBluestone,--and the consequent knowledge of Mr. Flick and the\nSolicitor-General. It was necessary, too, that Lord Lovel should know\nall. His conduct in many things must depend on the reception which\nmight probably be accorded to a renewal of his suit. Of course he\nmust be told. He had already been told that the tailor was to be\nadmitted to see his love, in order that she might be absolved by the\ntailor from her first vow. It had not been pleasant,--but he had\nacceded. Mr. Flick had taken upon himself to say that he was sure\nthat everything would be made pleasant. The Earl had frowned, and had\nbeen very short with Mr. Flick. These confidences with lawyers about\nhis lovesuit, and his love's tone with her low-born lover, had not\nbeen pleasant to Lord Lovel. But he had endured it,--and now he\nmust be told of the result. Oh, heavens;--what a hell of misery was\nthis girl making for her high-born relatives! But the story of the\ntailor's visit to Keppel Street did not reach the unhappy ones at\nYoxham till months had passed away.\n\nMr. Goffe was very injudicious in postponing the departure of the\ntwo ladies--as the Solicitor-General told Mr. Flick afterwards very\nplainly, when he heard of what had been done. \"Money; she might have\nhad any money. I would have advanced it. You would have advanced it!\"\n\"Oh certainly,\" said Mr. Flick, not, however, at all relishing the\nidea of advancing money to his client's adversary. \"I never heard of\nsuch folly,\" continued Sir William. \"That comes of trusting people\nwho should not be trusted.\" But it was too late then. Lady Anna was\nlying ill in bed, in fever; and three doctors doubted whether she\nwould ever get up again. \"Would it not be better that she should\ndie?\" said her mother to herself, standing over her and looking at\nher. It would,--so thought the mother then,--be better that she\nshould die than get up to become the wife of Daniel Thwaite. But how\nmuch better that she should live and become the Countess Lovel! She\nstill loved her child, as only a mother can love her only child,--as\nonly a mother can love who has no hope of joy in the world, but what\nis founded on her child. But the other passion had become so strong\nin her bosom that it almost conquered her mother's yearnings. Was she\nto fight for long years that she might be beaten at last when the\nprize was so near her,--when the cup was almost at her lips? Were\nthe girl now to be taken to her grave, there would be an end at any\nrate of the fear which now most heavily oppressed her. But the three\ndoctors were called in, one after another; and Lady Anna was tended\nas though her life was as precious as that of any other daughter.\n\nThese new tidings caused new perturbation among the lawyers. \"They\nsay that Clerke and Holland have given her over,\" said Mr. Flick to\nSir William.\n\n\"I am sorry to hear it,\" said Mr. Solicitor; \"but girls do live\nsometimes in spite of the doctors.\"\n\n\"Yes; very true, Sir William; very true. But if it should go in that\nway it might not perhaps be amiss for our client.\"\n\n\"God forbid that he should prosper by his cousin's death, Mr. Flick.\nBut the Countess would be the heir.\"\n\n\"The Countess is devoted to the Earl. We ought to do something,\nSir William. I don't think that we could claim above eight or\nten thousand pounds at most as real property. He put his money\neverywhere, did that old man. There are shares in iron mines in the\nAlleghanies, worth ever so much.\"\n\n\"They are no good to us,\" said the Solicitor-General, alluding to his\nclient's interests.\n\n\"Not worth a halfpenny to us, though they are paying twenty per cent.\non the paid-up capital. He seems to have determined that the real\nheir should get nothing, even if there were no will. A wicked old\nman!\"\n\n\"Very wicked, Mr. Flick.\"\n\n\"A horrible old man! But we really ought to do something, Mr.\nSolicitor. If the girl won't marry him there should be some\ncompromise, after all that we have done.\"\n\n\"How can the girl marry any one, Mr. Flick,--if she's going to die?\"\n\nA few days after this, Sir William called in Keppel Street and saw\nthe Countess, not with any idea of promoting a compromise,--for the\ndoing which this would not have been the time, nor would he have been\nthe fitting medium,--but in order that he might ask after Lady Anna's\nhealth. The whole matter was in truth now going very much against the\nEarl. Money had been allowed to the Countess and her daughter; and in\ntruth all the money was now their own, to do with it as they listed,\nthough there might be some delay before each was put into absolute\npossession of her own proportion; but no money had been allowed, or\ncould be allowed, to the Earl. And, that the fact was so, was now\nbecoming known to all men. Hitherto credit had at any rate been\neasy with the young lord. When the old Earl died, and when the will\nwas set aside, it was thought that he would be the heir. When the\nlawsuit first came up, it was believed everywhere that some generous\ncompromise would be the worst that could befall him. After that the\nmarriage had been almost a certainty, and then it was known that\nhe had something of his own, so that tradesmen need not fear that\ntheir bills would be paid. It can hardly be said that he had been\nextravagant; but a lord must live, and an earl can hardly live and\nmaintain a house in the country on a thousand a year, even though he\nhas an uncle to keep his hunters for him. Some prudent men in London\nwere already beginning to ask for their money, and the young Earl was\nin trouble. As Mr. Flick had said, it was quite time that something\nshould be done. Sir William still depended on the panacea of a\nmarriage, if only the girl would live. The marriage might be delayed;\nbut, if the cards were played prudently, might still make everything\ncomfortable. Such girls do not marry tailors, and will always prefer\nlords to tradesmen!\n\n\"I hope that you do not think that my calling is intrusive,\" he said.\nThe Countess, dressed all in black, with that funereal frown upon her\nbrow which she always now wore, with deep-sunk eyes, and care legible\nin every feature of her handsome face, received him with a courtesy\nthat was as full of woe as it was graceful. She was very glad to make\nhis acquaintance. There was no intrusion. He would forgive her, she\nthought, if he perceived that circumstances had almost overwhelmed\nher with sorrow. \"I have come to ask after your daughter,\" said he.\n\n\"She has been very ill, Sir William.\"\n\n\"Is she better now?\"\n\n\"I hardly know; I cannot say. They seemed to think this morning that\nthe fever was less violent.\"\n\n\"Then she will recover, Lady Lovel.\"\n\n\"They do not say so. But indeed I did not ask them. It is all in\nGod's hands. I sometimes think that it would be better that she\nshould die, and there be an end of it.\"\n\nThis was the first time that these two had been in each other's\ncompany, and the lawyer could not altogether repress the feeling of\nhorror with which he heard the mother speak in such a way of her only\nchild. \"Oh, Lady Lovel, do not say that!\"\n\n\"But I do say it. Why should I not say it to you, who know all? Of\nwhat good will her life be to herself, or to any one else, if she\npollute herself and her family by this marriage? It would be better\nthat she should be dead,--much better that she should be dead. She\nis all that I have, Sir William. It is for her sake that I have been\nstruggling from the first moment in which I knew that I was to be a\nmother. The whole care of my life has been to prove her to be her\nfather's daughter in the eye of the law. I doubt whether you can know\nwhat it is to pursue one object, and only one, through your whole\nlife, with never-ending solicitude,--and to do it all on behalf of\nanother. If you did, you would understand my feeling now. It would be\nbetter for her that she should die than become the wife of such a one\nas Daniel Thwaite.\"\n\n\"Lady Lovel, not only as a mother, but as a Christian, you should get\nthe better of that feeling.\"\n\n\"Of course I should. No doubt every clergyman in England would tell\nme the same thing. It is easy to say all that, sir. Wait till you\nare tried. Wait till all your ambition is to be betrayed, every hope\nrolled in the dust, till all the honours you have won are to be\nsoiled and degraded, till you are made a mark for general scorn and\npublic pity,--and then tell me how you love the child by whom such\nevils are brought upon you!\"\n\n\"I trust that I may never be so tried, Lady Lovel.\"\n\n\"I hope not; but think of all that before you preach to me. But I\ndo love her; and it is because I love her that I would fain see her\nremoved from the reproaches which her own madness will bring upon\nher. Let her die;--if it be God's will. I can follow her without\none wish for a prolonged life. Then will a noble family be again\nestablished, and her sorrowful tale will be told among the Lovels\nwith a tear and without a curse.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nLADY ANNA'S BEDSIDE.\n\n\nAll December went by, and the neighbours in the houses round spent\neach his merry Christmas; and the snow and frost of January passed\nover them, and February had come and nearly gone, before the\ndoctors dared to say that Lady Anna Lovel's life was not still in\ndanger. During this long period the world had known all about her\nillness,--as it did know, or pretended to know, the whole history of\nher life. The world had been informed that she was dying, and had,\nupon the whole, been really very sorry for her. She had interested\nthe world, and the world had heard much of her youth and beauty,--of\nthe romance too of her story, of her fidelity to the tailor, and of\nher persecutions. During these months of her illness the world was\ndisposed to think that the tailor was a fine fellow, and that he\nought to be taken by the hand. He had money now, and it was thought\nthat it would be a good thing to bring him into some club. There\nwas a very strong feeling at the Beaufort that if he were properly\nproposed and seconded he would be elected,--not because he was going\nto marry an heiress, but because he was losing the heiress whom he\nwas to have married. If the girl died, then Lord Lovel himself might\nbring him forward at the Beaufort. Of all this Daniel himself knew\nnothing; but he heard, as all the world heard, that Lady Anna was on\nher deathbed.\n\nWhen the news first reached him,--after a fashion that seemed to him\nto be hardly worthy of credit,--he called at the house in Keppel\nStreet and asked the question. Yes; Lady Anna was very ill; but,\nas it happened, Sarah the lady's-maid opened the door, and Sarah\nremembered the tailor. She had seen him when he was admitted to\nher young mistress, and knew enough of the story to be aware that\nhe should be snubbed. Her first answer was given before she had\nbethought herself; then she snubbed him, and told no one but the\nCountess of his visit. After that Daniel went to one of the doctors,\nand waited at his door with patience till he could be seen. The\nunhappy man told his story plainly. He was Daniel Thwaite, late a\ntailor, the man from Keswick, to whom Lady Anna Lovel was engaged. In\ncharity and loving kindness, would the doctor tell him of the state\nof his beloved one? The doctor took him by the hand and asked him\nin, and did tell him. His beloved one was then on the very point\nof death. Whereupon Daniel wrote to the Countess in humble strains,\nhimself taking the letter, and waiting without in the street for any\nanswer that might be vouchsafed. If it was, as he was told, that his\nbeloved was dying, might he be allowed to stand once at her bedside\nand kiss her hand? In about an hour an answer was brought to him at\nthe area gate. It consisted of his own letter, opened, and returned\nto him without a word. He went away too sad to curse, but he declared\nto himself that such cruelty in a woman's bosom could exist only in\nthe bosom of a countess.\n\nBut as others heard early in February that Lady Anna was like to\nrecover, so did Daniel Thwaite. Indeed, his authority was better than\nthat which reached the clubs, for the doctor still stood his friend.\nCould the doctor take a message from him to Lady Anna;--but one word?\nNo;--the doctor could take no message. That he would not do. But he\ndid not object to give to the lover a bulletin of the health of his\nsweetheart. In this way Daniel knew sooner than most others when the\nchange took place in the condition of his beloved one.\n\nLady Anna would be of age in May, and the plan of her betrothed was\nas follows. He would do nothing till that time, and then he would\ncall upon her to allow their banns to be published in Bloomsbury\nChurch after the manner of the Church of England. He himself had\ntaken lodgings in Great Russell Street, thinking that his object\nmight be aided by living in the same parish. If, as was probable, he\nwould not be allowed to approach Lady Anna either in person, or by\nletter, then he would have recourse to the law, and would allege that\nthe young lady was unduly kept a prisoner in custody. He was told\nthat such complaint would be as idle wind, coming from him,--that\nno allegation of that kind could obtain any redress unless it came\nfrom the young lady herself; but he flattered himself that he could\nso make it that the young lady would at any rate obtain thereby the\nprivilege of speaking for herself. Let some one ask her what were her\nwishes and he would be prepared to abide by her expression of them.\n\nIn the meantime Lord Lovel also had been anxious;--but his anxiety\nhad been met in a very different fashion. For many days the Countess\nsaw him daily, so that there grew up between them a close intimacy.\nWhen it was believed that the girl would die,--believed with that\nsad assurance which made those who were concerned speak of her death\nalmost as a certainty, the Countess, sitting alone with the young\nEarl, had told him that all would be his if the girl left them. He\nhad muttered something as to there being no reason for that. \"Who\nelse should have it?\" said the Countess. \"Where should it go? Your\npeople, Lovel, have not understood me. It is for the family that I\nhave been fighting, fighting, fighting,--and never ceasing. Though\nyou have been my adversary,--it has been all for the Lovels. If she\ngoes,--it shall be yours at once. There is no one knows how little\nI care for wealth myself.\" Then the girl had become better, and the\nCountess again began her plots, and her plans, and her strategy. She\nwould take the girl abroad in May, in April if it might be possible.\nThey would go,--not to Rome then, but to the south of France, and,\nas the weather became too warm for them, on to Switzerland and the\nTyrol. Would he, Lord Lovel, follow them? Would he follow them and\nbe constant in his suit, even though the frantic girl should still\ntalk of her tailor lover? If he would do so, as far as money was\nconcerned, all should be in common with them. For what was the money\nwanted but that the Lovels might be great and noble and splendid? He\nsaid that he would do so. He also loved the girl,--thought at least\nduring the tenderness created by her illness that he loved her with\nall his heart. He sat hour after hour with the Countess in Keppel\nStreet,--sometimes seeing the girl as she lay unconscious, or\nfeigning that she was so; till at last he was daily at her bedside.\n\"You had better not talk to him, Anna,\" her mother would say, \"but of\ncourse he is anxious to see you.\" Then the Earl would kiss her hand,\nand in her mother's presence she had not the courage,--perhaps she\nhad not the strength,--to withdraw it. In these days the Countess was\nnot cruelly stern as she had been. Bedside nursing hardly admits of\nsuch cruelty of manner. But she never spoke to her child with little\ntender endearing words, never embraced her,--but was to her a careful\nnurse rather than a loving mother.\n\nThen by degrees the girl got better, and was able to talk. \"Mamma,\"\nshe said one day, \"won't you sit by me?\"\n\n\"No, my dear; you should not be encouraged to talk.\"\n\n\"Sit by me, and let me hold your hand.\" For a moment the Countess\ngave way, and sat by her daughter, allowing her hand to remain\npressed beneath the bedclothes;--but she rose abruptly, remembering\nher grievance, remembering that it would be better that her child\nshould die, should die broken-hearted by unrelenting cruelty, than be\nencouraged to think it possible that she should do as she desired. So\nshe rose abruptly and left the bedside without a word.\n\n\"Mamma,\" said Lady Anna; \"will Lord Lovel be here to-day?\"\n\n\"I suppose he will be here.\"\n\n\"Will you let me speak to him for a minute?\"\n\n\"Surely you may speak to him.\"\n\n\"I am strong now, mamma, and I think that I shall be well again some\nday. I have so often wished that I might die.\"\n\n\"You had better not talk about it, my dear.\"\n\n\"But I should like to speak to him, mamma, without you.\"\n\n\"What to say,--Anna?\"\n\n\"I hardly know;--but I should like to speak to him. I have something\nto say about money.\"\n\n\"Cannot I say it?\"\n\n\"No, mamma. I must say it myself,--if you will let me.\" The Countess\nlooked at her girl with suspicion, but she gave the permission\ndemanded. Of course it would be right that this lover should see his\nlove. The Countess was almost minded to require from Lady Anna an\nassurance that no allusion should be made to Daniel Thwaite; but the\nman's name had not been mentioned between them since the beginning\nof the illness, and she was loth to mention it now. Nor would it\nhave been possible to prevent for long such an interview as that now\nproposed.\n\n\"He shall come in if he pleases,\" said the Countess; \"but I hope you\nwill remember who you are and to whom you are speaking.\"\n\n\"I will remember both, mamma,\" said Lady Anna. The Countess looked\ndown on her daughter's face, and could not help thinking that her\nchild was different from what she had been. There had been almost\ndefiance in the words spoken, though they had been spoken with the\nvoice of an invalid.\n\nAt three o'clock that afternoon, according to his custom, Lord Lovel\ncame, and was at once told that he was to be spoken to by his cousin.\n\"She says it is about money,\" said the Countess.\n\n\"About money?\"\n\n\"Yes;--and if she confines herself to that, do as she bids you. If\nshe is ever to be your wife it will be all right; and if not,--then\nit will be better in your hands than in hers. In three months time\nshe can do as she pleases with it all.\" He was then taken into Lady\nAnna's room. \"Here is your cousin,\" said the Countess. \"You must not\ntalk long or I shall interrupt you. If you wish to speak to him about\nthe property,--as the head of your family,--that will be very right;\nbut confine yourself to that for the present.\" Then the Countess left\nthem and closed the door.\n\n\"It is not only about money, Lord Lovel.\"\n\n\"You might call me Frederic now,\" said he tenderly.\n\n\"No;--not now. If I am ever well again and we are then friends I will\ndo so. They tell me that there is ever so much money,--hundreds of\nthousands of pounds. I forget how much.\"\n\n\"Do not trouble yourself about that.\"\n\n\"But I do trouble myself very much about it,--and I know that it\nought to be yours. There is one thing I want to tell you, which you\nmust believe. If I am ever any man's wife, I shall be the wife of\nDaniel Thwaite.\" That dark frown came upon his face which she had\nseen once before. \"Pray believe that it is so,\" she continued. \"Mamma\ndoes not believe it,--will not believe it; but it is so. I love him\nwith all my heart. I think of him every minute. It is very very cruel\nthat I may not hear from him or send one word to tell him how I am.\nThere! My hand is on the Bible, and I swear to you that if I am ever\nthe wife of any man, I will be his wife.\"\n\nHe looked down at her and saw that she was wan and thin and weak, and\nhe did not dare to preach to her the old family sermon as to his rank\nand station. \"But, Anna, why do you tell me this now?\" he said.\n\n\"That you may believe it and not trouble yourself with me any more.\nYou must believe it when I tell you so in this manner. I may perhaps\nnever live to rise from my bed. If I get well, I shall send to him,\nor go. I will not be hindered. He is true to me, and I will be true\nto him. You may tell mamma if you think proper. She would not believe\nme, but perhaps she may believe you. But, Lord Lovel, it is not fit\nthat he should have all this money. He does not want it, and he would\nnot take it. Till I am married I may do what I please with it;--and\nit shall be yours.\"\n\n\"That cannot be.\"\n\n\"Yes, it can. I know that I can make it yours if I please. They tell\nme that--that you are not rich, as Lord Lovel should be, because all\nthis has been taken from you. That was the reason why you came to\nme.\"\n\n\"By heaven, Anna, I love you most truly.\"\n\n\"It could not have been so when you had not seen me. Will you take a\nmessage from me to Daniel Thwaite?\"\n\nHe thought awhile before he answered it. \"No, I cannot do that.\"\n\n\"Then I must find another messenger. Mr. Goffe will do it perhaps. He\nshall tell me how much he wants to keep, and the rest shall be yours.\nThat is all. If you tell mamma, ask her not to be hard to me.\" He\nstood over her and took her hand, but knew not how to speak a word\nto her. He attempted to kiss her hand; but she raised herself on her\nelbow, and shook her head and drew it from him. \"It belongs to Daniel\nThwaite,\" she said. Then he left her and did not speak another word.\n\n\"What has she said?\" asked the Countess, with an attempt at smiling.\n\n\"I do not know that I should tell you.\"\n\n\"Surely, Lovel, you are bound to tell me.\"\n\n\"She has offered me all her property,--or most of it.\"\n\n\"She is right,\" said the Countess.\n\n\"But she has sworn to me, on the Bible, that she will never be my\nwife.\"\n\n\"Tush!--it means nothing.\"\n\n\"Ah yes;--it means much. It means all. She never loved me,--not for\nan instant. That other man has been before me, and she is too firm to\nbe moved.\"\n\n\"Did she say so?\"\n\nHe was silent for a moment and then replied, \"Yes; she did say so.\"\n\n\"Then let her die!\" said the Countess.\n\n\"Lady Lovel!\"\n\n\"Let her die. It will be better. Oh, God! that I should be brought to\nthis. And what will you do, my lord? Do you mean to say that you will\nabandon her?\"\n\n\"I cannot ask her to be my wife again.\"\n\n\"What;--because she has said this in her sickness,--when she is half\ndelirious,--while she is dreaming of the words that man spoke to her?\nHave you no more strength than that? Are you so poor a creature?\"\n\n\"I think I have been a poor creature to ask her a second time at\nall.\"\n\n\"No; not so. Your duty and mine are the same,--as should be hers. We\nmust forget ourselves while we save the family. Do not I bear all?\nHave not I borne everything--contumely, solitude, ill words, poverty,\nand now this girl's unkindness? But even yet I will not give it up.\nTake the property,--as it is offered.\"\n\n\"I could not touch it.\"\n\n\"If not for you, then for your children. Take it all, so that we may\nbe the stronger. But do not abandon us now, if you are a man.\"\n\nHe would not stay to hear her further exhortations, but hurried away\nfrom the house full of doubt and unhappiness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nLADY ANNA'S OFFER.\n\n\nEarly in March Lady Anna was convalescent, but had not yet left the\nhouse in Keppel Street,--and the confusion and dismay of the Countess\nwere greater than ever. Lady Anna had declared that she would not\nleave England for the present. She was reminded that at any rate till\nthe 10th of May she was subject to her mother's control. But by this\ntime her mother's harshness to her had produced some corresponding\nhardness in her. \"Yes, mamma;--but I will not go abroad. Things\nmust be settled, and I am not well enough to go yet.\" The Countess\nasserted that everything could be arranged abroad, that papers could\nbe sent after them, that Mr. Goffe could come out to them, and with\nmuch show of authority persisted. She would do anything by which\nshe might be able to remove Lady Anna from the influence of Daniel\nThwaite at the time at which the girl would cease to be subject to\nher. But in truth the girl had ceased to be subject to her. \"No,\nmamma, I will not go. If you will ask Serjeant Bluestone, or Sir\nWilliam Patterson, I am sure they will say that I ought not to be\nmade to go.\" There were some terrible scenes in which the mother was\ndriven almost to desperation. Lady Anna repeated to the Countess all\nthat she had said to Lord Lovel,--and swore to her mother with the\nBible in hand that if ever she became the wife of any man she would\nbe the wife of Daniel Thwaite. Then the Countess with great violence\nknocked the book out of her daughter's grasp, and it was thrown to\nthe other side of the room. \"If this is to go on,\" said the Countess,\n\"one of us must die.\"\n\n\"Mamma, I have done nothing to make you so unkind to me. You have not\nspoken one word of kindness to me since I came from Yoxham.\"\n\n\"If this goes on I shall never speak a word of kindness to you\nagain,\" said the mother.\n\nBut in the midst of all this there was one point on which they were\nagreed,--on which they came sufficiently near together for action,\nthough there was still a wide difference between them. Some large\nproportion of the property at stake was to be made over to Lord Lovel\non the day that gave the girl the legal power of transferring her\nown possessions. The Countess began by presuming that the whole of\nLady Anna's wealth was to be so transferred,--not from any lack of\nreverence for the great amount which was in question, but feeling\nthat for all good purposes it would be safer in the hands of the\nEarl than in those of her own child. If it could be arranged that\nthe tailor could get nothing with his bride, then it might still\nbe possible that the tailor might refuse the match. At any rate a\nquarrel might be fostered and the evil might be staved off. But to\nthis Lady Anna would not assent. If she might act in this business in\nconcert with Mr. Thwaite she would be able, she thought, to do better\nby her cousin than she proposed. But as she was not allowed to learn\nwhat were Mr. Thwaite's wishes, she would halve her property with her\ncousin. As much as this she was willing to do,--and was determined to\ndo, acting on her own judgment. More she would not do,--unless she\ncould see Mr. Thwaite. As it stood, her proposition was one which\nwould, if carried out, bestow something like \u00c2\u00a310,000 a year upon\nthe Earl. Then Mr. Goffe was sent for, and Lady Anna was allowed to\ncommunicate her suggestion to the lawyer. \"That should require a\ngreat deal of thought,\" said Mr. Goffe with solemnity. Lady Anna\ndeclared that she had been thinking of it all the time she had been\nill. \"But it should not be done in a hurry,\" said Mr. Goffe. Then\nLady Anna remarked that in the meantime, her cousin, the Earl, the\nhead of her family, would have nothing to support his title. Mr.\nGoffe took his leave, promising to consult his partner, and to see\nMr. Flick.\n\nMr. Goffe did consult his partner and did see Mr. Flick, and then\nSerjeant Bluestone was asked his advice,--and the Solicitor-General.\nThe Serjeant had become somewhat tired of the Lovels, and did not\ncare to give any strong advice either in one direction or in the\nother. The young lady, he said, might of course do what she liked\nwith her own when it was her own; but he thought that she should not\nbe hurried. He pointed it out as a fact that the Earl had not the\nslightest claim upon any portion of the estate,--not more than he\nwould have had if this money had come to Lady Anna from her mother's\ninstead of from her father's relatives. He was still of opinion that\nthe two cousins might ultimately become man and wife if matters were\nleft tranquil and the girl were taken abroad for a year or two. Lady\nAnna, however, would be of age in a few weeks, and must of course do\nas she liked with her own.\n\nBut they all felt that everything would at last be ruled by what the\nSolicitor-General might say. The Solicitor-General was going out of\ntown for a week or ten days,--having the management of a great case\nat the Spring Assizes. He would think over Lady Anna's proposition,\nand say what he had to say when he returned. Lord Lovel, however,\nhad been his client, and he had said from first to last that more\nwas to be done for his client by amicable arrangement than by\nhostile opposition. If the Earl could get \u00c2\u00a310,000 a year by amicable\narrangement, the Solicitor-General would be shown to have been right\nin the eyes of all men, and it was probable,--as both Mr. Goffe and\nMr. Flick felt,--that he would not repudiate a settlement of the\nfamily affairs by which he would be proved to have been a discreet\ncounsellor.\n\nIn the meantime it behoved Lord Lovel himself to have an opinion. Mr.\nFlick of course had told him of the offer,--which had in truth been\nmade directly to himself by his cousin. At this time his affairs were\nnot in a happy condition. A young earl, handsome and well esteemed,\nmay generally marry an heiress,--if not one heiress then another.\nThough he be himself a poor man, his rank and position will stand in\nlieu of wealth. And so would it have been with this young earl,--who\nwas very handsome and excellently well esteemed,--had it not been\nthat all the world knew that it was his especial business to marry\none especial heiress. He could hardly go about looking for other\nhoney, having, as he had, one particular hive devoted by public\nopinion to himself. After a year or two he might have looked\nelsewhere,--but what was he to do in the meantime? He was well nigh\npenniless, and in debt. So he wrote a letter to his uncle, the\nparson.\n\nIt may be remembered that when the uncle and nephew last parted in\nLondon there was not much love between them. From that day to this\nthey had not seen each other, nor had there been any communication\nbetween them. The horses had been taken away and sold. The rector\nhad spoken to the ladies of his household more than once with great\nbitterness of the young man's ingratitude; and they more than once\nhad spoken to the rector, with a woman's piteous tenderness, of the\nyoung lord's poverty. But it was all sorrow and distress. For in\ntruth the rector could not be happy while he was on bad terms with\nthe head of his family. Then the young lord wrote as though there had\nbeen nothing amiss between them. It had in truth all passed away from\nhis mind. This very liberal offer had been made to him. It amounted\nto wealth in lieu of poverty,--to what would be comfortable wealth\neven for an earl. Ten thousand a year was offered to him by his\ncousin. Might he accept it? The rector took the letter in good part,\nand begged his nephew to come at once to Yoxham. Whereupon the nephew\nwent to Yoxham.\n\n\"What does Sir William say?\" asked the rector, who, in spite of\nhis disapproval of all that Sir William had done, felt that the\nSolicitor-General was the man whose influence in the matter would\nreally prevail.\n\n\"He has said nothing as yet. He is out of town.\"\n\n\"Ten thousand a year! Who was it made the offer?\"\n\n\"She made it herself.\"\n\n\"Lady Anna?\"\n\n\"Yes;--Lady Anna. It is a noble offer.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. But then if she has no right to any of it, what does it\namount to?\"\n\n\"But she has a right to all of it;--she and her mother between them.\"\n\n\"I shall never believe it, Frederic--never; and not the less so\nbecause they now want to bind you to them by such a compromise as\nthis.\"\n\n\"I think you look at it in a wrong light, uncle Charles.\"\n\n\"Well;--well. I will say nothing more about it. I don't see why you\nshouldn't take it,--I don't indeed. It ought all to have been yours.\nEverybody says that. You'll have to buy land, and it won't give you\nnearly so much then. I hope you'll buy land all the same, and I do\nhope it will be properly settled when you marry. As to marrying, you\nwill be able to do much better than what you used to think of.\"\n\n\"We won't talk about that, uncle Charles,\" said the Earl.\n\nAs far as the rector's opinion went, it was clear that the offer\nmight be accepted; but yet it was felt that very much must depend\non what the Solicitor-General might say. Then Miss Lovel gave her\nopinion on the matter, which did not altogether agree with that of\nher brother. She believed in Lady Anna, whereas the rector professed\nthat he did not. The rector and Lady Fitzwarren were perhaps the\nonly two persons who, after all that had been said and done, still\nmaintained that the Countess was an impostor, and that Lady Anna\nwould only be Anna Murray, if everybody had his due. Miss Lovel was\nquite as anxious on behalf of the Earl as was her brother, but she\nclung to the hope of a marriage. \"I still think it might all come\nright, if you would only wait,\" said aunt Julia.\n\n\"It's all very well talking of waiting, but how am I to live?\"\n\n\"You could live here, Frederic. There is nothing my brother would\nlike so much. I thought he would break his heart when the horses were\ntaken away. It would only be for a year.\"\n\n\"What would come of it?\"\n\n\"At the end of the year she would be your wife.\"\n\n\"Never!\" said the Earl.\n\n\"Young men are so impatient.\"\n\n\"Never, under any circumstances, would I ask her again. You may make\nyour mind up to that. As sure as you stand there, she will marry\nDaniel Thwaite, if she lives another twelvemonth.\"\n\n\"You really think so, Frederic?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it. After what she said to me, it would be impossible I\nshould doubt it.\"\n\n\"And she will be Lady Anna Thwaite! Oh dear, how horrible. I wish\nshe had died when she was ill;--I do indeed. A journeyman tailor!\nBut something will prevent it. I really think that Providence will\ninterfere to prevent it!\" But in reference to the money she gave in\nher adhesion. If the great lawyer said that it might be taken,--then\nit should be taken. At the end of a week the Earl hurried back to\nLondon to see the great lawyer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nNO DISGRACE AT ALL.\n\n\nBefore the Solicitor-General returned to town things had come to\na worse pass than ever. Lady Lovel had ordered her daughter to be\nready to start to Paris by a certain hour, on a certain day,--giving\nher three days for preparation,--and Lady Anna had refused to go.\nWhereupon the Countess had caused her own things to be packed up, and\nthose of her daughter. Sarah was now altogether in the confidence of\nthe Countess, so that Lady Anna had not even dominion over her own\nclothes. The things were stowed away, and all the arrangements were\nmade for the journey; but Lady Anna refused to go, and when the hour\ncame could not be induced to get into the carriage. The lodgings had\nbeen paid for to the day, and given up; so that the poor old woman\nin Keppel Street was beside herself. Then the Countess, of necessity,\npostponed her journey for twenty-four hours, telling her daughter\nthat on the next day she would procure the assistance of magistrates\nand force the rebel to obedience.\n\nHardly a word had been spoken between the mother and daughter\nduring those three days. There had been messages sent backwards and\nforwards, and once or twice the Countess had violently entered Lady\nAnna's bedroom, demanding submission. Lady Anna was always on the\nbed when her mother entered, and, there lying, would shake her head,\nand then with sobs accuse the Countess of unkindness. Lady Lovel had\nbecome furious in her wrath, hardly knowing what she herself did or\nsaid, always asserting her own authority, declaring her own power,\nand exclaiming against the wicked ingratitude of her child. This\nshe did till the young waiting-woman was so frightened that she was\nalmost determined to leave the house abruptly, though keenly alive to\nthe profit and glory of serving a violent and rich countess. And the\nold lady who let the lodgings was intensely anxious to be rid of her\nlodgers, though her money was scrupulously paid, and no questions\nasked as to extra charges. Lady Anna was silent and sullen. When\nleft to herself she spent her time at her writing-desk, of which she\nhad managed to keep the key. What meals she took were brought up to\nher bedroom, so that a household more uncomfortable could hardly be\ngathered under a roof.\n\nOn the day fixed for that departure which did not take place, the\nCountess wrote to Mr. Goffe for assistance,--and Lady Anna, by the\naid of the mistress of the house, wrote to Serjeant Bluestone. The\nletter to Mr. Goffe was the first step taken towards obtaining that\nassistance from civil authorities to which the Countess thought\nherself to be entitled in order that her legal dominion over her\ndaughter might be enforced. Lady Anna wrote to the Serjeant, simply\nbegging that he would come to see her, putting her letter open into\nthe hands of the landlady. She implored him to come at once,--and,\nas it happened, he called in Keppel Street that night, whereas Mr.\nGoffe's visit was not made till the next morning. He asked for the\nCountess, and was shown into the drawing-room. The whole truth\nwas soon made clear to him, for the Countess attempted to conceal\nnothing. Her child was rebelling against authority, and she was sure\nthat the Serjeant would assist her in putting down and conquering\nsuch pernicious obstinacy. But she found at once that the Serjeant\nwould not help her. \"But Lady Anna will be herself of age in a day or\ntwo,\" he said.\n\n\"Not for nearly two months,\" said the Countess indignantly.\n\n\"My dear Lady Lovel, under such circumstances you can hardly put\nconstraint upon her.\"\n\n\"Why not? She is of age, or she is not. Till she be of age she is\nbound to obey me.\"\n\n\"True;--she is bound to obey you after a fashion, and so indeed she\nwould be had she been of age a month since. But such obligations here\nin England go for very little, unless they are supported by reason.\"\n\n\"The law is the law.\"\n\n\"Yes;--but the law would be all in her favour before you could get it\nto assist you,--even if you could get its assistance. In her peculiar\nposition, it is rational that she should choose to wait till she\nbe able to act for herself. Very great interests will be at her\ndisposal, and she will of course wish to be near those who can advise\nher.\"\n\n\"I am her only guardian. I can advise her.\" The Serjeant shook his\nhead. \"You will not help me then?\"\n\n\"I fear I cannot help you, Lady Lovel.\"\n\n\"Not though you know the reasons which induce me to take her away\nfrom England before she slips entirely out of my hands and ruins all\nour hopes?\" But still the Serjeant shook his head. \"Every one is\nleagued against me,\" said the Countess, throwing up her hands in\ndespair.\n\nThen the Serjeant asked permission to visit Lady Anna, but was told\nthat he could not be allowed to do so. She was in bed, and there was\nnothing to make it necessary that she should receive a visit from a\ngentleman in her bedroom. \"I am an old man,\" said the Serjeant, \"and\nhave endeavoured to be a true and honest friend to the young lady.\nI think, Lady Lovel, that you will do wrong to refuse my request.\nI tell you fairly that I shall be bound to interfere on her behalf.\nShe has applied to me as her friend, and I feel myself constrained to\nattend to her application.\"\n\n\"She has applied to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Lady Lovel. There is her letter.\"\n\n\"She has deceived me again,\" said the Countess, tearing the letter\ninto atoms. But the Serjeant so far frightened her that she was\ninduced to promise that Mrs. Bluestone should see Lady Anna on the\nfollowing morning,--stipulating, however, that Mrs. Bluestone should\nsee herself before she went up-stairs.\n\nOn the following morning Mr. Goffe came early. But Mr. Goffe\ncould give his client very little comfort. He was, however, less\nuncomfortable than the Serjeant had been. He was of opinion that\nLady Anna certainly ought to go abroad, in obedience to her mother's\ninstructions, and was willing to go to her and tell her so, with what\nsolemnity of legal authority he might be able to assume; but he could\nnot say that anything could be done absolutely to enforce obedience.\nMr. Goffe suggested that perhaps a few gentle words might be\nsuccessful. \"Gentle words!\" said the Countess, who had become quite\nunable to restrain herself. \"The harshest words are only too gentle\nfor her. If I had known what she was, Mr. Goffe, I would never have\nstirred in this business. They might have called me what they would,\nand it would have been better.\" When Mr. Goffe came downstairs\nhe had not a word to say more as to the efficacy of gentleness.\nHe simply remarked that he did not think the young lady could be\ninduced to go, and suggested that everybody had better wait till the\nSolicitor-General returned to town.\n\nThen Mrs. Bluestone came, almost on the heels of the attorney;--poor\nMrs. Bluestone, who now felt that it was a dreadful grievance both\nto her and to her husband that they had had anything to do with the\nLovel family! She was very formal in her manner,--and, to tell the\ntruth for her, rather frightened. The Serjeant had asked her to call\nand see Lady Anna Lovel. Might she be permitted to do so? Then the\nCountess burst forth with a long story of all her wrongs,--with the\nhistory of her whole life. Not beginning with her marriage,--but\nworking back to it from the intense misery, and equally intense\nambition of the present hour. She told it all; how everybody had been\nagainst her,--how she had been all alone at the dreary Grange in\nWestmoreland,--how she had been betrayed by her husband, and turned\nout to poverty and scorn;--how she had borne it all for the sake of\nthe one child who was, by God's laws and man's, the heiress to her\nfather's name; how she had persevered,--intermingling it all with a\ncertain worship of high honours and hereditary position with which\nMrs. Bluestone was able in some degree to sympathise. She was clever,\nand words came to her freely. It was almost impossible that any\nhearer should refuse to sympathise with her,--any hearer who knew\nthat her words were true. And all that she told was true. The things\nwhich she narrated had been done;--the wrongs had been endured;--and\nthe end of it all which she feared, was imminent. And the hearer\nthought as did the speaker as to the baseness of this marriage with\nthe tailor,--thought as did the speaker of the excellence of the\nmarriage with the lord. But still there was something in the woman's\neye,--something in the tone of her voice, something in the very\nmotion of her hands as she told her story, which made Mrs. Bluestone\nfeel that Lady Anna should not be left under her mother's control.\nIt would be very well that the Lovel family should be supported, and\nthat Lady Anna should be kept within the pale of her own rank. But\nthere might be things worse than Lady Anna's defection,--and worse\neven than the very downfall of the Lovels.\n\nAfter sitting for nearly two hours with the Countess, Mrs. Bluestone\nwas taken up-stairs. \"Mrs. Bluestone has come to see you,\" said the\nCountess, not entering the room, and retreating again immediately as\nshe closed the door.\n\n\"This is very kind of you, Mrs. Bluestone,\" said Lady Anna, who was\nsitting crouching in her dressing-gown over the fire. \"But I thought\nthat perhaps the Serjeant would come.\" The lady, taken off her guard,\nimmediately said that the Serjeant had been there on the preceding\nevening. \"And mamma would not let me see him! But you will help me!\"\n\nIn this interview, as in that below, a long history was told to the\nvisitor, and was told with an eloquent energy which she certainly had\nnot expected. \"They talk to me of ladies,\" said Lady Anna. \"I was not\na lady. I knew nothing of ladies and their doings. I was a poor girl,\nfriendless but for my mother, sometimes almost without shoes to my\nfeet, often ragged, solitary, knowing nothing of ladies. Then there\ncame one lad, who played with me;--and it was mamma who brought us\ntogether. He was good to me, when all others were bad. He played with\nme, and gave me things, and taught me,--and loved me. Then when he\nasked me to love him again, and to love him always, was I to think\nthat I could not,--because I was a lady! You despise him because he\nis a tailor. A tailor was good to me, when no one else was good. How\ncould I despise him because he was a tailor? I did not despise him,\nbut I loved him with all my heart.\"\n\n\"But when you came to know who you were, Lady Anna--\"\n\n\"Yes;--yes. I came to know who I was, and they brought my cousin to\nme, and told me to love him, and bade me be a lady indeed. I felt it\ntoo, for a time. I thought it would be pleasant to be a Countess, and\nto go among great people; and he was pleasant, and I thought that I\ncould love him too, and do as they bade me. But when I thought of it\nmuch,--when I thought of it alone,--I hated myself. In my heart of\nhearts I loved him who had always been my friend. And when Lord Lovel\ncame to me at Bolton, and said that I must give my answer then,--I\ntold him all the truth. I am glad I told him the truth. He should not\nhave come again after that. If Daniel is so poor a creature because\nhe is a tailor,--must not I be poor who love him? And what must he be\nwhen he comes to me again after that?\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Bluestone descended from the room she was quite sure that\nthe girl would become Lady Anna Thwaite, and told the Countess that\nsuch was her opinion. \"By the God above me,\" said the Countess rising\nfrom her chair;--\"by the God above me, she never shall.\" But after\nthat the Countess gave up her project of forcing her daughter to go\nabroad. The old lady of the house was told that the rooms would still\nbe required for some weeks to come,--perhaps for months; and having\nhad a conference on the subject with Mrs. Bluestone, did not refuse\nher consent.\n\nAt last Sir William returned to town, and was besieged on all sides,\nas though in his hands lay the power of deciding what should become\nof all the Lovel family. Mr. Goffe was as confidential with him as\nMr. Flick, and even Serjeant Bluestone condescended to appeal to him.\nThe young Earl was closeted with him on the day of his return, and he\nhad found on his desk the following note from the Countess;--\n\n\"The Countess Lovel presents her compliments to the\nSolicitor-General. The Countess is very anxious to leave England\nwith her daughter, but has hitherto been prevented by her child's\nobstinacy. Sir William Patterson is so well aware of all the\ncircumstances that he no doubt can give the Countess advice as to the\nmanner in which she should proceed to enforce the obedience of her\ndaughter. The Countess Lovel would feel herself unwarranted in thus\ntrespassing on the Solicitor-General, were it not that it is her\nchief anxiety to do everything for the good of Earl Lovel and the\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Look at that, my lord,\" said the Solicitor-General, showing the Earl\nthe letter. \"I can do nothing for her.\"\n\n\"What does she want to have done?\"\n\n\"She wants to carry her daughter away beyond the reach of Mr.\nThwaite. I am not a bit surprised; but she can't do it. The days\nare gone by when a mother could lock her daughter up, or carry her\naway,--at any rate in this country.\"\n\n\"It is very sad.\"\n\n\"It might have been much worse. Why should she not marry Mr. Thwaite?\nLet them make the settlement as they propose, and then let the young\nlady have her way. She will have her way,--whether her mother lets\nher or no.\"\n\n\"It will be a disgrace to the family, Sir William.\"\n\n\"No disgrace at all! How many peers' daughters marry commoners in\nEngland. It is not with us as it is with some German countries in\nwhich noble blood is separated as by a barrier from blood that is not\nnoble. The man I am told is clever and honest. He will have great\nmeans at his command, and I do not see why he should not make as\ngood a gentleman as the best of us. At any rate she must not be\npersecuted.\"\n\nSir William answered the Countess's letter as a matter of course, but\nthere was no comfort in his answer. \"The Solicitor-General presents\nhis compliments to the Countess Lovel. With all the will in the world\nto be of service, he fears that he can do no good by interfering\nbetween the Countess and Lady Anna Lovel. If, however, he may venture\nto give advice, he would suggest to the Countess that as Lady Anna\nwill be of age in a short time, no attempt should now be made to\nexercise a control which must cease when that time shall arrive.\"\n\"They are all joined against me,\" said the Countess, when she read\nthe letter;--\"every one of them! But still it shall never be. I will\nnot live to see it.\"\n\nThen there was a meeting between Mr. Flick and Sir William. Mr. Flick\nmust inform the ladies that nothing could be done till Lady Anna\nwas of age;--that not even could any instructions be taken from her\nbefore that time as to what should subsequently be done. If, when\nthat time came, she should still be of a mind to share with her\ncousin the property, she could then instruct Mr. Goffe to make out\nthe necessary deeds.\n\nAll this was communicated by letter to the Countess, but Mr. Goffe\nespecially requested that the letter might be shown to Lady Anna, and\nthat he might receive a reply intimating that Lady Anna understood\nits purport. If necessary he would call upon Lady Anna in Keppel\nStreet. After some delay and much consideration, the Countess sent\nthe attorney's letter to her daughter, and Lady Anna herself wrote\na reply. She perfectly understood the purport of Mr. Goffe's letter,\nand would thank Mr. Goffe to call upon her on the 10th of May, when\nthe matter might, she hoped, be settled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nNEARER AND NEARER.\n\n\nSo they went on living in utter misery till the month of May had come\nround, and Lady Anna was at last pronounced to be convalescent.\n\nLate one night, long after midnight, the Countess crept into her\ndaughter's room and sat down by the bedside. Lady Anna was asleep,\nand the Countess sat there and watched. At this time the girl had\npassed her birthday, and was of age. Mr. Goffe had been closeted\nwith her and with her mother for two mornings running, Sir William\nPatterson had also been with them, and instructions had been given as\nto the property, upon which action was to be at once taken. Of that\nproportion of the estate which fell to Lady Anna, one entire moiety\nwas to be made over to the Earl. While this was being arranged no\nword was said as to Daniel Thwaite, or as to the marriage with\nthe lord. The settlement was made as though it were a thing of\nitself; and they all had been much surprised,--the mother, the\nSolicitor-General, and the attorney,--at the determination of purpose\nand full comprehension of the whole affair which Lady Anna displayed.\nWhen it came to the absolute doing of the matter,--the abandonment\nof all this money,--the Countess became uneasy and discontented.\nShe also had wished that Lord Lovel should have the property,--but\nher wish had been founded on a certain object to be attained, which\nobject was now farther from her than ever. But the property in\nquestion was not hers, but her daughter's, and she made no loud\nobjection to the proceeding. The instructions were given, and the\ndeeds were to be forthcoming some time before the end of the month.\n\nIt was on the night of the 11th of May that the Countess sat at her\nchild's bedside. She had brought up a taper with her, and there she\nsat watching the sleeping girl. Thoughts wondrously at variance with\neach other, and feelings thoroughly antagonistic, ran through her\nbrain and heart. This was her only child,--the one thing that there\nwas for her to love,--the only tie to the world that she possessed.\nBut for her girl, it would be good that she should be dead. And if\nher girl should do this thing, which would make her life a burden to\nher,--how good it would be for her to die! She did not fear to die,\nand she feared nothing after death;--but with a coward's dread she\ndid fear the torment of her failure if this girl should become the\nwife of Daniel Thwaite. In such case most certainly would she never\nsee the girl again,--and life then would be all a blank to her. But\nshe understood that though she should separate herself from the world\naltogether, men would know of her failure, and would know that she\nwas devouring her own heart in the depth of her misery. If the girl\nwould but have done as her mother had proposed, would have followed\nafter her kind, and taken herself to those pleasant paths which had\nbeen opened for her, with what a fond caressing worship, with what\ninfinite kisses and blessings, would she, the mother, have tended\nthe young Countess and assisted in making the world bright for the\nhigh-born bride. But a tailor! Foh! What a degraded creature was her\nchild to cling to so base a love!\n\nShe did, however, acknowledge to herself that the girl's clinging was\nof a kind she had no power to lessen. The ivy to its standard tree\nis not more loyal than was her daughter to this wretched man. But\nthe girl might die,--or the tailor might die,--or she, the miserable\nmother, might die; and so this misery might be at an end. Nothing\nbut death could end it. Thoughts and dreams of other violence had\ncrossed her brain,--of carrying the girl away, of secluding her, of\nfrightening her from day to day into some childish, half-idiotic\nsubmission. But for that the tame obedience of the girl would have\nbeen necessary,--or that external assistance which she had sought,\nin vain, to obtain among the lawyers. Such hopes were now gone, and\nnothing remained but death.\n\nWhy had not the girl gone when she was so like to go? Why had she not\ndied when it had seemed to be God's pleasure to take her? A little\nindifference, some slight absence of careful tending, any chance\naccident would have made that natural which was now,--which was\nnow so desirable and yet beyond reach! Yes;--so desirable! For\nwhose sake could it be wished that a life so degraded should be\nprolonged? But there could be no such escape. With her eyes fixed on\nvacancy, revolving it in her mind, she thought that she could kill\nherself;--but she knew that she could not kill her child.\n\nBut, should she destroy herself, there would be no vengeance in that.\nCould she be alone, far out at sea, in some small skiff with that\nlow-born tailor, and then pull out the plug, and let him know what\nhe had done to her as they both went down together beneath the water,\nthat would be such a cure of the evil as would now best suit her\nwishes. But there was no such sea, and no such boat. Death, however,\nmight still be within her grasp.\n\nThen she laid her hand on the girl's shoulder, and Lady Anna awoke.\n\"Oh, mamma;--is that you?\"\n\n\"It is I, my child.\"\n\n\"Mamma, mamma; is anything the matter? Oh, mamma, kiss me.\" Then\nthe Countess stooped down and kissed the girl passionately. \"Dear\nmamma,--dearest mamma!\"\n\n\"Anna, will you do one thing for me? If I never speak to you of Lord\nLovel again, will you forget Daniel Thwaite?\" She paused, but Lady\nAnna had no answer ready. \"Will you not say as much as that for me?\nSay that you will forget him till I am gone.\"\n\n\"Gone, mamma? You are not going!\"\n\n\"Till I am dead. I shall not live long, Anna. Say at least that you\nwill not see him or mention his name for twelve months. Surely, Anna,\nyou will do as much as that for a mother who has done so much for\nyou.\" But Lady Anna would make no promise. She turned her face to the\npillow and was dumb. \"Answer me, my child. I may at least demand an\nanswer.\"\n\n\"I will answer you to-morrow, mamma.\" Then the Countess fell on her\nknees at the bedside and uttered a long, incoherent prayer, addressed\npartly to the God of heaven, and partly to the poor girl who was\nlying there in bed, supplicating with mad, passionate eagerness that\nthis evil thing might be turned away from her. Then she seized the\ngirl in her embrace and nearly smothered her with kisses. \"My own, my\ndarling, my beauty, my all; save your mother from worse than death,\nif you can;--if you can!\"\n\nHad such tenderness come sooner it might have had deeper effect. As\nit was, though the daughter was affected and harassed,--though she\nwas left panting with sobs and drowned in tears,--she could not but\nremember the treatment she had suffered from her mother during the\nlast six months. Had the request for a year's delay come sooner,\nit would have been granted; but now it was made after all measures\nof cruelty had failed. Ten times during the night did she say that\nshe would yield,--and ten times again did she tell herself that\nwere she to yield now, she would be a slave all her life. She had\nresolved,--whether right or wrong,--still, with a strong mind and a\ngreat purpose, that she would not be turned from her way, and when\nshe arose in the morning she was resolved again. She went into her\nmother's room and at once declared her purpose. \"Mamma, it cannot be.\nI am his, and I must not forget him or be ashamed of his name;--no,\nnot for a day.\"\n\n\"Then go from me, thou ungrateful one, hard of heart, unnatural\nchild, base, cruel, and polluted. Go from me, if it be possible, for\never!\"\n\nThen did they live for some days separated for a second time, each\ntaking her meals in her own room; and Mrs. Richards, the owner of\nthe lodgings, went again to Mrs. Bluestone, declaring that she was\nafraid of what might happen, and that she must pray to be relieved\nfrom the presence of the ladies. Mrs. Bluestone had to explain that\nthe lodgings had been taken for the quarter, and that a mother and\ndaughter could not be put out into the street merely because they\nlived on bad terms with each other. The old woman, as was natural,\nincreased her bills;--but that had no effect.\n\nOn the 15th of May Lady Anna wrote a note to Daniel Thwaite, and sent\na copy of it to her mother before she had posted it. It was in two\nlines;--\n\n\n   DEAR DANIEL,\n\n   Pray come and see me here. If you get this soon enough,\n   pray come on Tuesday about one.\n\n   Yours affectionately,\n\n   ANNA.\n\n\n\"Tell mamma,\" said she to Sarah, \"that I intend to go out and put\nthat in the post to-day.\" The letter was addressed to Wyndham Street.\nNow the Countess knew that Daniel Thwaite had left Wyndham Street.\n\n\"Tell her,\" said the Countess, \"tell her--; but, of what use to tell\nher anything? Let the door be closed upon her. She shall never return\nto me any more.\" The message was given to Lady Anna as she went\nforth:--but she posted the letter, and then called in Bedford Square.\nMrs. Bluestone returned with her to Keppel Street; but as the door\nwas opened by Mrs. Richards, and as no difficulty was made as to Lady\nAnna's entrance, Mrs. Bluestone returned home without asking to see\nthe Countess.\n\nThis happened on a Saturday, but when Tuesday came Daniel Thwaite\ndid not come to Keppel Street. The note was delivered in course of\npost at his old abode, and was redirected from Wyndham Street late on\nMonday evening,--having no doubt given cause there for much curiosity\nand inspection. Late on the Tuesday it did reach Daniel Thwaite's\nresidence in Great Russell Street, but he was then out, wandering\nabout the streets as was his wont, telling himself of all the horrors\nof an idle life, and thinking what steps he should take next as to\nthe gaining of his bride. He had known to a day when she was of age,\nand had determined that he would allow her one month from thence\nbefore he would call upon her to say what should be their mutual\nfate. She had reached that age but a few days, and now she had\nwritten to him herself.\n\nOn returning home he received the girl's letter, and when the early\nmorning had come,--the Wednesday morning, the day after that fixed\nby Lady Anna,--he made up his mind as to his course of action. He\nbreakfasted at eight, knowing how useless it would be to stir early,\nand then called in Keppel Street, leaving word with Mrs. Richards\nherself that he would be there again at one o'clock to see Lady Anna.\n\"You can tell Lady Anna that I only got her note last night very\nlate.\" Then he went off to the hotel in Albemarle Street at which he\nknew that Lord Lovel was living. It was something after nine when\nhe reached the house, and the Earl was not yet out of his bedroom.\nDaniel, however, sent up his name, and the Earl begged that he would\ngo into the sitting-room and wait. \"Tell Mr. Thwaite that I will not\nkeep him above a quarter of an hour.\" Then the tailor was shown into\nthe room where the breakfast things were laid, and there he waited.\n\nWithin the last few weeks very much had been said to the Earl\nabout Daniel Thwaite by many people, and especially by the\nSolicitor-General. \"You may be sure that she will become his wife,\"\nSir William had said, \"and I would advise you to accept him as her\nhusband. She is not a girl such as we at first conceived her to be.\nShe is firm of purpose, and very honest. Obstinate, if you will,\nand,--if you will,--obstinate to a bad end. But she is generous, and\nlet her marry whom she will, you cannot cast her out. You will owe\neverything to her high sense of honour;--and I am much mistaken if\nyou will not owe much to him. Accept them both, and make the best\nof them. In five years he'll be in Parliament as likely as not. In\nten years he'll be Sir Daniel Thwaite,--if he cares for it. And in\nfifteen years Lady Anna will be supposed by everybody to have made\na very happy marriage.\" Lord Lovel was at this time inclined to be\nsubmissive in everything to his great adviser, and was now ready to\ntake Mr. Daniel Thwaite by the hand.\n\nHe did take him by the hand as he entered the sitting-room, radiant\nfrom his bath, clad in a short bright-coloured dressing-gown such\nas young men then wore o' mornings, with embroidered slippers on\nhis feet, and a smile on his face. \"I have heard much of you, Mr.\nThwaite,\" he said, \"and am glad to meet you at last. Pray sit down.\nI hope you have not breakfasted.\"\n\nPoor Daniel was hardly equal to the occasion. The young lord had\nbeen to him always an enemy,--an enemy because the lord had been the\nadversary of the Countess and her daughter, an enemy because the lord\nwas an earl and idle, an enemy because the lord was his rival. Though\nhe now was nearly sure that this last ground of enmity was at an\nend, and though he had come to the Earl for certain purposes of his\nown, he could not bring himself to feel that there should be good\nfellowship between them. He took the hand that was offered to him,\nbut took it awkwardly, and sat down as he was bidden. \"Thank your\nlordship, but I breakfasted long since. If it will suit you, I will\nwalk about and call again.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I can eat, and you can talk to me. Take a cup of tea at\nany rate.\" The Earl rang for another teacup, and began to butter his\ntoast.\n\n\"I believe your lordship knows that I have long been engaged to marry\nyour lordship's cousin,--Lady Anna Lovel.\"\n\n\"Indeed I have been told so.\"\n\n\"By herself.\"\n\n\"Well;--yes; by herself.\"\n\n\"I have been allowed to see her but once during the last eight or\nnine months.\"\n\n\"That has not been my fault, Mr. Thwaite.\"\n\n\"I want you to understand, my lord, that it is not for her money that\nI have sought her.\"\n\n\"I have not accused you, surely.\"\n\n\"But I have been accused. I am going to see her now,--if I can get\nadmittance to her. I shall press her to fix a day for our marriage,\nand if she will do so, I shall leave no stone unturned to accomplish\nit. She has a right to do with herself as she pleases, and no\nconsideration shall stop me but her wishes.\"\n\n\"I shall not interfere.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that, my lord.\"\n\n\"But I will not answer for her mother. You cannot be surprised, Mr.\nThwaite, that Lady Lovel should be averse to such a marriage.\"\n\n\"She was not averse to my father's company nor to mine a few years\nsince;--no nor twelve months since. But I say nothing about that.\nLet her be averse. We cannot help it. I have come to you to say that\nI hope something may be done about the money before she becomes my\nwife. People say that you should have it.\"\n\n\"Who says so?\"\n\n\"I cannot say who;--perhaps everybody. Should every shilling of it be\nyours I should marry her as willingly to-morrow. They have given me\nwhat is my own, and that is enough for me. For what is now hers and,\nperhaps, should be yours, I will not interfere with it. When she is\nmy wife, I will guard for her and for those who may come after her\nwhat belongs to her then; but as to what may be done before that, I\ncare nothing.\"\n\nOn hearing this the Earl told him the whole story of the arrangement\nwhich was then in progress;--how the property would in fact be\ndivided into three parts, of which the Countess would have one, he\none, and Lady Anna one. \"There will be enough for us all,\" said the\nEarl.\n\n\"And much more than enough for me,\" said Daniel as he got up to take\nhis leave. \"And now I am going to Keppel Street.\"\n\n\"You have all my good wishes,\" said the Earl. The two men again shook\nhands;--again the lord was radiant and good humoured;--and again the\ntailor was ashamed and almost sullen. He knew that the young nobleman\nhad behaved well to him, and it was a disappointment to him that any\nnobleman should behave well.\n\nNevertheless as he walked away slowly towards Keppel Street,--for the\ntime still hung on his hands,--he began to feel that the great prize\nof prizes was coming nearer within his grasp.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nDANIEL THWAITE COMES TO KEPPEL STREET.\n\n\nEven the Bluestones were now convinced that Lady Anna Lovel must be\nallowed to marry the Keswick tailor, and that it would be expedient\nthat no further impediment should be thrown in her way. Mrs.\nBluestone had been told, while walking to Keppel Street with the\nyoung lady, of the purport of the letter and of the invitation given\nto Daniel Thwaite. The Serjeant at once declared that the girl must\nhave her own way,--and the Solicitor-General, who also heard of it,\nexpressed himself very strongly. It was absurd to oppose her. She was\nher own mistress. She had shown herself competent to manage her own\naffairs. The Countess must be made to understand that she had better\nyield at once with what best grace she could. Then it was that he\nmade that prophecy to the Earl as to the future success of the\nfortunate tailor, and then too he wrote at great length to the\nCountess, urging many reasons why her daughter should be allowed to\nreceive Mr. Daniel Thwaite. \"Your ladyship has succeeded in very\nmuch,\" wrote the Solicitor-General, \"and even in respect of this\nmarriage you will have the satisfaction of feeling that the man is in\nevery way respectable and well-behaved. I hear that he is an educated\nman, with culture much higher than is generally found in the state of\nlife which he has till lately filled, and that he is a man of high\nfeeling and noble purpose. The manner in which he has been persistent\nin his attachment to your daughter is in itself evidence of this. And\nI think that your ladyship is bound to remember that the sphere of\nlife in which he has hitherto been a labourer, would not have been so\nhumble in its nature had not the means which should have started him\nin the world been applied to support and succour your own cause. I am\nwell aware of your feelings of warm gratitude to the father; but I\nthink you should bear in mind, on the son's behalf, that he has been\nwhat he has been because his father was so staunch a friend to your\nladyship.\" There was very much more of it, all expressing the opinion\nof Sir William that the Countess should at once open her doors to\nDaniel Thwaite.\n\nThe reader need hardly be told that this was wormwood to the\nCountess. It did not in the least touch her heart and had but little\neffect on her purpose. Gratitude;--yes! But if the whole result of\nthe exertion for which the receiver is bound to be grateful, is to\nbe neutralised by the greed of the conferrer of the favour,--if all\nis to be taken that has been given, and much more also,--what ground\nwill there be left for gratitude? If I save a man's purse from a\nthief, and then demand for my work twice what that purse contained,\nthe man had better have been left with the robbers. But she was told,\nnot only that she ought to accept the tailor as a son-in-law, but\nalso that she could not help herself. They should see whether she\ncould not help herself. They should be made to acknowledge that she\nat any rate was in earnest in her endeavours to preserve pure and\nunspotted the honour of the family.\n\nBut what should she do? That she should put on a gala dress and a\nsmiling face and be carried off to church with a troop of lawyers and\ntheir wives to see her daughter become the bride of a low journeyman,\nwas of course out of the question. By no act, by no word, by no\nsign would she give aught of a mother's authority to nuptials so\ndisgraceful. Should her daughter become Lady Anna Thwaite, they two,\nmother and daughter, would never see each other again. Of so much at\nany rate she was sure. But could she be sure of nothing beyond that?\nShe could at any rate make an effort.\n\nThen there came upon her a mad idea,--an idea which was itself\nevidence of insanity,--of the glory which would be hers if by any\nmeans she could prevent the marriage. There would be a halo round her\nname were she to perish in such a cause, let the destruction come\nupon her in what form it might. She sat for hours meditating,--and at\nevery pause in her thoughts she assured herself that she could still\nmake an effort.\n\nShe received Sir William's letter late on the Tuesday,--and during\nthat night she did not lie down or once fall asleep. The man, as she\nknew, had been told to come at one on that day, and she had been\nprepared; but he did not come, and she then thought that the letter,\nwhich had been addressed to his late residence, had failed to reach\nhim. During the night she wrote a very long answer to Sir William\npleading her own cause, expatiating on her own feelings, and\npalliating any desperate deed which she might be tempted to perform.\nBut, when the letter had been copied and folded, and duly sealed with\nthe Lovel arms, she locked it in her desk, and did not send it on its\nway even on the following morning. When the morning came, shortly\nafter eight o'clock, Mrs. Richards brought up the message which\nDaniel had left at the door. \"Be we to let him in, my lady?\" said\nMrs. Richards with supplicating hands upraised. Her sympathies were\nall with Lady Anna, but she feared the Countess, and did not dare\nin such a matter to act without the mother's sanction. The Countess\nbegged the woman to come to her in an hour for further instructions,\nand at the time named Mrs. Richards, full of the importance of her\nwork, divided between terror and pleasurable excitement, again\ntoddled up-stairs. \"Be we to let him in, my lady? God, he knows it's\nhard upon the likes of me, who for the last three months doesn't know\nwhether I'm on my head or heels.\" The Countess very quietly requested\nthat when Mr. Thwaite should call he might be shown into the parlour.\n\n\"I will see Mr. Thwaite myself, Mrs. Richards; but it will be better\nthat my daughter should not be disturbed by any intimation of his\ncoming.\"\n\nThen there was a consultation below stairs as to what should be done.\nThere had been many such consultations, but they had all ended in\nfavour of the Countess. Mrs. Richards from fear, and the lady's-maid\nfrom favour, were disposed to assist the elder lady. Poor Lady Anna\nthroughout had been forced to fight her battles with no friend near\nher. Now she had many friends,--many who were anxious to support her,\neven the Bluestones, who had been so hard upon her while she was\nalong with them;--but they who were now her friends were never near\nher to assist her with a word.\n\nSo it came to pass that when Daniel Thwaite called at the house\nexactly at one o'clock Lady Anna was not expecting him. On the\nprevious day at that hour she had sat waiting with anxious ears for\nthe knock at the door which might announce his coming. But she had\nwaited in vain. From one to two,--even till seven in the evening, she\nhad waited. But he had not come, and she had feared that some scheme\nhad been used against her. The people at the Post Office had been\nbribed,--or the women in Wyndham Street had been false. But she would\nnot be hindered. She would go out alone and find him,--if he were to\nbe found in London.\n\nWhen he did come, she was not thinking of his coming. He was shown\ninto the dining-room, and within a minute afterwards the Countess\nentered with stately step. She was well dressed, even to the\nadjustment of her hair; and she was a woman so changed that he would\nhardly have known her as that dear and valued friend whose slightest\nword used to be a law to his father,--but who in those days never\nseemed to waste a thought upon her attire. She had been out that\nmorning walking through the streets, and the blood had mounted to her\ncheeks He acknowledged to himself that she looked like a noble and\nhigh-born dame. There was a fire in her eye, and a look of scorn\nabout her mouth and nostrils, which had even for him a certain\nfascination,--odious to him as were the pretensions of the so-called\ngreat. She was the first to speak. \"You have called to see my\ndaughter,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, Lady Lovel,--I have.\"\n\n\"You cannot see her.\"\n\n\"I came at her request.\"\n\n\"I know you did, but you cannot see her. You can be hardly so\nignorant of the ways of the world, Mr. Thwaite, as to suppose that a\nyoung lady can receive what visitors she pleases without the sanction\nof her guardians.\"\n\n\"Lady Anna Lovel has no guardian, my lady. She is of age, and is at\npresent her own guardian.\"\n\n\"I am her mother, and shall exercise the authority of a mother over\nher. You cannot see her. You had better go.\"\n\n\"I shall not be stopped in this way, Lady Lovel.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you will force your way up to her? To do so you\nwill have to trample over me;--and there are constables in the\nstreet. You cannot see her. You had better go.\"\n\n\"Is she a prisoner?\"\n\n\"That is between her and me, and is no affair of yours. You are\nintruding here, Mr. Thwaite, and cannot possibly gain anything by\nyour intrusion.\" Then she strode out in the passage, and motioned him\nto the front door. \"Mr. Thwaite, I will beg you to leave this house,\nwhich for the present is mine. If you have any proper feeling you\nwill not stay after I have told you that you are not welcome.\"\n\nBut Lady Anna, though she had not expected the coming of her lover,\nhad heard the sound of voices, and then became aware that the man was\nbelow. As her mother was speaking she rushed down-stairs and threw\nherself into her lover's arms. \"It shall never be so in my presence,\"\nsaid the Countess, trying to drag the girl from his embrace by the\nshoulders.\n\n\"Anna;--my own Anna,\" said Daniel in an ecstacy of bliss. It was not\nonly that his sweetheart was his own, but that her spirit was so\nhigh.\n\n\"Daniel!\" she said, still struggling in his arms.\n\nBy this time they were all in the parlour, whither the Countess\nhad been satisfied to retreat to escape the eyes of the women who\nclustered at the top of the kitchen stairs. \"Daniel Thwaite,\" said\nthe Countess, \"if you do not leave this, the blood which will be shed\nshall rest on your head,\" and so saying, she drew nigh to the window\nand pulled down the blind. She then crossed over and did the same to\nthe other blind, and having done so, took her place close to a heavy\nupright desk, which stood between the fireplace and the window. When\nthe two ladies first came to the house they had occupied only the\nfirst and second floors;--but, since the success of their cause, the\nwhole had been taken, including the parlour in which this scene was\nbeing acted; and the Countess spent many hours daily sitting at the\nheavy desk in this dark gloomy chamber.\n\n\"Whose blood shall be shed?\" said Lady Anna, turning to her mother.\n\n\"It is the raving of madness,\" said Daniel.\n\n\"Whether it be madness or not, you shall find, sir, that it is\ntrue. Take your hands from her. Would you disgrace the child in the\npresence of her mother?\"\n\n\"There is no disgrace, mamma. He is my own, and I am his. Why should\nyou try to part us?\"\n\nBut now they were parted. He was not a man to linger much over the\nsweetness of a caress when sterner work was in his hands to be\ndone. \"Lady Lovel,\" he said, \"you must see that this opposition is\nfruitless. Ask your cousin, Lord Lovel, and he will tell you that it\nis so.\"\n\n\"I care nothing for my cousin. If he be false, I am true. Though all\nthe world be false, still will I be true. I do not ask her to marry\nher cousin. I simply demand that she shall relinquish one who is\ninfinitely beneath her,--who is unfit to tie her very shoe-string.\"\n\n\"He is my equal in all things,\" said Lady Anna, \"and he shall be my\nlord and husband.\"\n\n\"I know of no inequalities such as those you speak of, Lady Lovel,\"\nsaid the tailor. \"The excellence of your daughter's merits I admit,\nand am almost disposed to claim some goodness for myself, finding\nthat one so good can love me. But, Lady Lovel, I do not wish to\nremain here now. You are disturbed.\"\n\n\"I am disturbed, and you had better go.\"\n\n\"I will go at once if you will let me name some early day on which I\nmay be allowed to meet Lady Anna,--alone. And I tell her here that if\nshe be not permitted so to see me, it will be her duty to leave her\nmother's house, and come to me. There is my address, dear.\" Then he\nhanded to her a paper on which he had written the name of the street\nand number at which he was now living. \"You are free to come and go\nas you list, and if you will send to me there, I will find you here\nor elsewhere as you may command me. It is but a short five minutes'\nwalk beyond the house at which you were staying in Bedford Square.\"\n\nThe Countess stood silent for a moment or two, looking at them,\nduring which neither the girl spoke nor her lover. \"You will not\neven allow her six months to think of it?\" said the Countess.\n\"I will allow her six years if she says that she requires time to\nthink of it.\"\n\n\"I do not want an hour,--not a minute,\" said Lady Anna.\n\nThe mother flashed round upon her daughter. \"Poor vain, degraded\nwretch,\" she said.\n\n\"She is a true woman, honest to the heart's core,\" said the lover.\n\n\"You shall come to-morrow,\" said the Countess. \"Do you hear me,\nAnna?--he shall come to-morrow. There shall be an end of this in some\nway, and I am broken-hearted. My life is over for me, and I may as\nwell lay me down and die. I hope God in his mercy may never send upon\nanother woman,--upon another wife, or another mother,--trouble such\nas that with which I have been afflicted. But I tell you this, Anna;\nthat what evil a husband can do,--even let him be evil-minded as was\nyour father,--is nothing,--nothing,--nothing to the cruelty of a\ncruel child. Go now, Mr. Thwaite; if you please. If you will return\nat the same hour to-morrow she shall speak with you--alone. And then\nshe must do as she pleases.\"\n\n\"Anna, I will come again to-morrow,\" said the tailor. But Lady Anna\ndid not answer him. She did not speak, but stayed looking at him till\nhe was gone.\n\n\"To-morrow shall end it all. I can stand this no longer. I have\nprayed to you,--a mother to her daughter; I have prayed to you for\nmercy, and you will show me none. I have knelt to you.\"\n\n\"Mamma!\"\n\n\"I will kneel again if it may avail.\" And the Countess did kneel.\n\"Will you not spare me?\"\n\n\"Get up, mamma; get up. What am I doing,--what have I done that you\nshould speak to me like this?\"\n\n\"I ask you from my very soul,--lest I commit some terrible crime. I\nhave sworn that I would not see this marriage,--and I will not see\nit.\"\n\n\"If he will consent I will delay it,\" said the girl trembling.\n\n\"Must I beg to him then? Must I kneel to him? Must I ask him to save\nme from the wrath to come? No, my child, I will not do that. If it\nmust come, let it come. When you were a little thing at my knees, the\ngentlest babe that ever mother kissed, I did not think that you would\nlive to be so hard to me. You have your mother's brow, my child, but\nyou have your father's heart.\"\n\n\"I will ask him to delay it,\" said Anna.\n\n\"No;--if it be to come to that I will have no dealings with you.\nWhat; that he,--he who has come between me and all my peace, he who\nwith his pretended friendship has robbed me of my all, that he is to\nbe asked to grant me a few weeks' delay before this pollution comes\nupon me,--during which the whole world will know that Lady Anna Lovel\nis to be the tailor's wife! Leave me. When he comes to-morrow, you\nshall be sent for;--but I will see him first. Leave me, now. I would\nbe alone.\"\n\nLady Anna made an attempt to take her mother's hand, but the Countess\nrepulsed her rudely. \"Oh, mamma!\"\n\n\"We must be bitter enemies or loving friends, my child. As it is we\nare bitter enemies; yes, the bitterest. Leave me now. There is no\nroom for further words between us.\" Then Lady Anna slunk up to her\nown room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nDANIEL THWAITE COMES AGAIN.\n\n\nThe Countess Lovel had prepared herself on that morning for the doing\nof a deed, but her heart had failed her. How she might have carried\nherself through it had not her daughter came down to them,--how far\nshe might have been able to persevere, cannot be said now. But it\nwas certain that she had so far relented that even while the hated\nman was there in her presence, she determined that she would once\nagain submit herself to make entreaties to her child, once again to\nspeak of all that she had endured, and to pray at least for delay if\nnothing else could be accorded to her. If her girl would but promise\nto remain with her for six months, then they might go abroad,--and\nthe chances afforded them by time and distance would be before her.\nIn that case she would lavish such love upon the girl, so many\nindulgences, such sweets of wealth and ease, such store of caresses\nand soft luxury, that surely the young heart might thus be turned\nto the things which were fit for rank, and high blood, and splendid\npossessions. It could not be but that her own child,--the child who\na few months since had been as gentle with her and as obedient as an\ninfant,--should give way to her as far as that. She tried it, and\nher daughter had referred her prayer,--or had said that she would\nrefer it,--to the decision of her hated lover; and the mother had\nat once lost all command of her temper. She had become fierce,--nay,\nferocious; and had lacked the guile and the self-command necessary to\ncarry out her purpose. Had she persevered Lady Anna must have granted\nher the small boon that she then asked. But she had given way to her\nwrath, and had declared that her daughter was her bitterest enemy.\nAs she seated herself at the old desk where Lady Anna left her, she\nswore within her own bosom that the deed must be done.\n\nEven at the moment when she was resolving that she would kneel once\nmore at her daughter's knees, she prepared herself for the work that\nshe must do, should the daughter still be as hard as stone to her.\n\"Come again at one to-morrow,\" she said to the tailor; and the tailor\nsaid that he would come.\n\nWhen she was alone she seated herself on her accustomed chair and\nopened the old desk with a key that had now become familiar to her\nhand. It was a huge piece of furniture,--such as is never made in\nthese days, but is found among every congregation of old household\ngoods,--with numberless drawers clustering below, with a vast body,\nfull of receptacles for bills, wills, deeds, and waste-paper, and\na tower of shelves above, ascending almost to the ceiling. In the\ncentre of the centre body was a square compartment, but this had been\nleft unlocked, so that its contents might be ready to her hand. Now\nshe opened it and took from it a pistol; and, looking warily over her\nshoulder to see that the door was closed, and cautiously up at the\nwindows, lest some eye might be spying her action even through the\nthick blinds, she took the weapon in her hand and held it up so that\nshe might feel, if possible, how it would be with her when she should\nattempt the deed. She looked very narrowly at the lock, of which\nthe trigger was already back at its place, so that no exertion of\narrangement might be necessary for her at the fatal moment. Never as\nyet had she fired a pistol;--never before had she held such a weapon\nin her hand;--but she thought that she could do it when her passion\nran high.\n\nThen for the twentieth time she asked herself whether it would not\nbe easier to turn it against her own bosom,--against her own brain;\nso that all might be over at once. Ah, yes;--so much easier! But how\nthen would it be with this man who had driven her, by his subtle\ncourage and persistent audacity, to utter destruction? Could he and\nshe be made to go down together in that boat which her fancy had\nbuilt for them, then indeed it might be well that she should seek her\nown death. But were she now to destroy herself,--herself and only\nherself,--then would her enemy be left to enjoy his rich prize, a\nprize only the richer because she would have disappeared from the\nworld! And of her, if such had been her last deed, men would only\nsay that the mad Countess had gone on in her madness. With looks of\nsad solemnity, but heartfelt satisfaction, all the Lovels, and that\nwretched tailor, and her own daughter, would bestow some mock grief\non her funeral, and there would be an end for ever of Josephine\nCountess Lovel,--and no one would remember her, or her deeds, or her\nsufferings. When she wandered out from the house on that morning,\nafter hearing that Daniel Thwaite would be there at one, and had\nwalked nearly into the mid city so that she might not be watched,\nand had bought her pistol and powder and bullets, and had then with\npatience gone to work and taught herself how to prepare the weapon\nfor use, she certainly had not intended simply to make the triumph of\nher enemy more easy.\n\nAnd yet she knew well what was the penalty of murder, and she knew\nalso that there could be no chance of escape. Very often had she\nturned it in her mind, whether she could not destroy the man so that\nthe hand of the destroyer might be hidden. But it could not be so.\nShe could not dog him in the streets. She could not get at him in his\nmeals to poison him. She could not creep to his bedside and strangle\nhim in the silent watches of the night. And this woman's heart, even\nwhile from day to day she was meditating murder,--while she was\ntelling herself that it would be a worthy deed to cut off from life\none whose life was a bar to her own success,--even then revolted from\nthe shrinking stealthy step, from the low cowardice of the hidden\nmurderer. To look him in the face and then to slay him,--when no\nescape for herself would be possible, that would have in it something\nthat was almost noble; something at any rate bold,--something that\nwould not shame her. They would hang her for such a deed! Let them\ndo so. It was not hanging that she feared, but the tongues of those\nwho should speak of her when she was gone. They should not speak of\nher as one who had utterly failed. They should tell of a woman who,\ncruelly misused throughout her life, maligned, scorned, and tortured,\nrobbed of her own, neglected by her kindred, deserted and damned by\nher husband, had still struggled through it all till she had proved\nherself to be that which it was her right to call herself;--of\na woman who, though thwarted in her ambition by her own child,\nand cheated of her triumph at the very moment of her success, had\ndared rather to face an ignominious death than see all her efforts\nfrustrated by the maudlin fancy of a girl. Yes! She would face it\nall. Let them do what they would with her. She hardly knew what might\nbe the mode of death adjudged to a Countess who had murdered. Let\nthem kill her as they would, they would kill a Countess;--and the\nwhole world would know her story.\n\nThat day and night were very dreadful to her. She never asked a\nquestion about her daughter. They had brought her food to her in that\nlonely parlour, and she hardly heeded them as they laid the things\nbefore her, and then removed them. Again and again did she unlock the\nold desk, and see that the weapon was ready to her hand. Then she\nopened that letter to Sir William Patterson, and added a postscript\nto it. \"What I have since done will explain everything.\" That was\nall she added, and on the following morning, about noon, she put the\nletter on the mantelshelf. Late at night she took herself to bed,\nand was surprised to find that she slept. The key of the old desk\nwas under her pillow, and she placed her hand on it the moment that\nshe awoke. On leaving her own room she stood for a moment at her\ndaughter's door. It might be, if she killed the man, that she would\nnever see her child again. At that moment she was tempted to rush\ninto her daughter's room, to throw herself upon her daughter's bed,\nand once again to beg for mercy and grace. She listened, and she knew\nthat her daughter slept. Then she went silently down to the dark\nroom and the old desk. Of what use would it be to abase herself? Her\ndaughter was the only thing that she could love; but her daughter's\nheart was filled with the image of that low-born artisan.\n\n\"Is Lady Anna up?\" she asked the maid about ten o'clock.\n\n\"Yes, my lady; she is breakfasting now.\"\n\n\"Tell her that when--when Mr. Thwaite comes, I will send for her as\nsoon as I wish to see her.\"\n\n\"I think Lady Anna understands that already, my lady.\"\n\n\"Tell her what I say.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lady. I will, my lady.\" Then the Countess spoke no further\nword till, punctually at one o'clock, Daniel Thwaite was shown into\nthe room. \"You keep your time, Mr. Thwaite,\" she said.\n\n\"Working men should always do that, Lady Lovel,\" he replied, as\nthough anxious to irritate her by reminding her how humble was the\nman who could aspire to be the son-in-law of a Countess.\n\n\"All men should do so, I presume. I also am punctual. Well sir;--have\nyou anything else to say?\"\n\n\"Much to say,--to your daughter, Lady Lovel.\"\n\n\"I do not know that you will ever see my daughter again.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that she has been taken away from this?\" The\nCountess was silent, but moved away from the spot on which she stood\nto receive him towards the old desk, which stood open,--with the\ndoor of the centre space just ajar. \"If it be so, you have deceived\nme most grossly, Lady Lovel. But it can avail you nothing, for I\nknow that she will be true to me. Do you tell me that she has been\nremoved?\"\n\n\"I have told you no such thing.\"\n\n\"Bid her come then,--as you promised me.\"\n\n\"I have a word to say to you first. What if she should refuse to\ncome?\"\n\n\"I do not believe that she will refuse. You yourself heard what she\nsaid yesterday. All earth and all heaven should not make me doubt\nher, and certainly not your word, Lady Lovel. You know how it is, and\nyou know how it must be.\"\n\n\"Yes,--I do; I do; I do.\" She was facing him with her back to the\nwindow, and she put forth her left hand upon the open desk, and\nthrust it forward as though to open the square door which stood\najar;--but he did not notice her hand; he had his eye fixed upon her,\nand suspected only deceit,--not violence. \"Yes, I know how it must\nbe,\" she said, while her fingers approached nearer to the little\ndoor.\n\n\"Then let her come to me.\"\n\n\"Will nothing turn you from it?\"\n\n\"Nothing will turn me from it.\"\n\nThen suddenly she withdrew her hand and confronted him more closely.\n\"Mine has been a hard life, Mr. Thwaite;--no life could have been\nharder. But I have always had something before me for which to long,\nand for which to hope;--something which I might reach if justice\nshould at length prevail.\"\n\n\"You have got money and rank.\"\n\n\"They are nothing--nothing. In all those many years, the thing that I\nhave looked for has been the splendour and glory of another, and the\nsatisfaction I might feel in having bestowed upon her all that she\nowned. Do you think that I will stand by, after such a struggle,\nand see you rob me of it all,--you,--you, who were one of the tools\nwhich came to my hand to work with? From what you know of me, do you\nthink that my spirit could stoop so low? Answer me, if you have ever\nthought of that. Let the eagles alone, and do not force yourself into\nour nest. You will find, if you do, that you will be rent to pieces.\"\n\n\"This is nothing, Lady Lovel. I came here,--at your bidding, to see\nyour daughter. Let me see her.\"\n\n\"You will not go?\"\n\n\"Certainly I will not go.\"\n\nShe looked at him as she slowly receded to her former\nstanding-ground, but he never for a moment suspected the nature of\nher purpose. He began to think that some actual insanity had befallen\nher, and was doubtful how he should act. But no fear of personal\nviolence affected him. He was merely questioning with himself whether\nit would not be well for him to walk up-stairs into the upper room,\nand seek Lady Anna there, as he stood watching the motion of her\neyes.\n\n\"You had better go,\" said she, as she again put her left hand on the\nflat board of the open desk.\n\n\"You trifle with me, Lady Lovel,\" he answered. \"As you will not allow\nLady Anna to come to me here, I will go to her elsewhere. I do not\ndoubt but that I shall find her in the house.\" Then he turned to\nthe door, intending to leave the room. He had been very near to her\nwhile they were talking, so that he had some paces to traverse before\nhe could put his hand upon the lock,--but in doing so his back was\nturned on her. In one respect it was better for her purpose that it\nshould be so. She could open the door of the compartment and put her\nhand upon the pistol without having his eye upon her. But, as it\nseemed to her at the moment, the chance of bringing her purpose to\nits intended conclusion was less than it would have been had she been\nable to fire at his face. She had let the moment go by,--the first\nmoment,--when he was close to her, and now there would be half the\nroom between them. But she was very quick. She seized the pistol,\nand, transferring it to her right hand, she rushed after him, and\nwhen the door was already half open she pulled the trigger. In the\nagony of that moment she heard no sound, though she saw the flash.\nShe saw him shrink and pass the door, which he left unclosed, and\nthen she heard a scuffle in the passage, as though he had fallen\nagainst the wall. She had provided herself especially with a second\nbarrel,--but that was now absolutely useless to her. There was no\npower left to her wherewith to follow him and complete the work which\nshe had begun. She did not think that she had killed him, though\nshe was sure that he was struck. She did not believe that she had\naccomplished anything of her wishes,--but had she held in her hand a\nsix-barrelled revolver, as of the present day, she could have done no\nmore with it. She was overwhelmed with so great a tremor at her own\nviolence that she was almost incapable of moving. She stood glaring\nat the door, listening for what should come, and the moments seemed\nto be hours. But she heard no sound whatever. A minute passed away\nperhaps, and the man did not move. She looked around as if seeking\nsome way of escape,--as though, were it possible, she would get to\nthe street through the window. There was no mode of escape, unless\nshe would pass out through the door to the man who, as she knew, must\nstill be there. Then she heard him move. She heard him rise,--from\nwhat posture she knew not, and step towards the stairs. She was still\nstanding with the pistol in her hand, but was almost unconscious that\nshe held it. At last her eye glanced upon it, and she was aware that\nshe was still armed. Should she rush after him, and try what she\ncould do with that other bullet? The thought crossed her mind, but\nshe knew that she could do nothing. Had all the Lovels depended upon\nit, she could not have drawn that other trigger. She took the pistol,\nput it back into its former hiding-place, mechanically locked the\nlittle door, and then seated herself in her chair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nTHE ATTEMPT AND NOT THE DEED CONFOUNDS US.\n\n\nThe tailor's hand was on the lock of the door when he first saw the\nflash of the fire, and then felt that he was wounded. Though his back\nwas turned to the woman he distinctly saw the flash, but he never\ncould remember that he had heard the report. He knew nothing of the\nnature of the injury he had received, and was hardly aware of the\nplace in which he had been struck, when he half closed the door\nbehind him and then staggered against the opposite wall. For a moment\nhe was sick, almost to fainting, but yet he did not believe that he\nhad been grievously hurt. He was, however, disabled, weak, and almost\nincapable of any action. He seated himself on the lowest stair, and\nbegan to think. The woman had intended to murder him! She had lured\nhim there with the premeditated intention of destroying him! And this\nwas the mother of his bride,--the woman whom he intended to call his\nmother-in-law! He was not dead, nor did he believe that he was like\nto die; but had she killed him,--what must have been the fate of the\nmurderess! As it was, would it not be necessary that she should be\nhanded over to the law, and dealt with for the offence? He did not\nknow that they might not even hang her for the attempt.\n\nHe said afterwards that he thought that he sat there for a quarter of\nan hour. Three minutes, however, had not passed before Mrs. Richards,\nascending from the kitchen, found him upon the stairs. \"What is it,\nMr. Thwaite?\" said she.\n\n\"Is anything the matter?\" he asked with a faint smile.\n\n\"The place is full of smoke,\" she said, \"and there is a smell of\ngunpowder.\"\n\n\"There is no harm done at any rate,\" he answered.\n\n\"I thought I heard a something go off,\" said Sarah, who was behind\nMrs. Richards.\n\n\"Did you?\" said he. \"I heard nothing; but there certainly is a\nsmoke,\" and he still smiled.\n\n\"What are you sitting there for, Mr. Thwaite?\" asked Mrs. Richards.\n\n\"You ain't no business to sit there, Mr. Thwaite,\" said Sarah.\n\n\"You've been and done something to the Countess,\" said Mrs. Richards.\n\n\"The Countess is all right. I'm going up-stairs to see Lady\nAnna;--that's all. But I've hurt myself a little. I'm bad in my left\nshoulder, and I sat down just to get a rest.\" As he spoke he was\nstill smiling.\n\nThen the woman looked at him and saw that he was very pale. At that\ninstant he was in great pain, though he felt that as the sense of\nintense sickness was leaving him he would be able to go up-stairs and\nsay a word or two to his sweetheart, should he find her. \"You ain't\njust as you ought to be, Mr. Thwaite,\" said Mrs. Richards. He was\nvery haggard, and perspiration was on his brow, and she thought that\nhe had been drinking.\n\n\"I am well enough,\" said he rising,--\"only that I am much troubled by\na hurt in my arm. At any rate I will go up-stairs.\" Then he mounted\nslowly, leaving the two women standing in the passage.\n\nMrs. Richards gently opened the parlour door, and entered the room,\nwhich was still reeking with smoke and the smell of the powder, and\nthere she found the Countess seated at the old desk, but with her\nbody and face turned round towards the door. \"Is anything the matter,\nmy lady?\" asked the woman.\n\n\"Where has he gone?\"\n\n\"Mr. Thwaite has just stepped up-stairs,--this moment. He was very\nqueer like, my lady.\"\n\n\"Is he hurt?\"\n\n\"We think he's been drinking, my lady,\" said Sarah.\n\n\"He says that his shoulder is ever so bad,\" said Mrs. Richards.\n\nThen for the first time it occurred to the Countess that perhaps the\ndeed which she had done,--the attempt in which she had failed,--might\nnever be known. Instinctively she had hidden the pistol and had\nlocked the little door, and concealed the key within her bosom as\nsoon as she was alone. Then she thought that she would open the\nwindow; but she had been afraid to move, and she had sat there\nwaiting while she heard the sound of voices in the passage. \"Oh,--his\nshoulder!\" said she. \"No,--he has not been drinking. He never drinks.\nHe has been very violent, but he never drinks. Well,--why do you\nwait?\"\n\n\"There is such a smell of something,\" said Mrs. Richards.\n\n\"Yes;--you had better open the windows. There was an accident. Thank\nyou;--that will do.\"\n\n\"And is he to be alone,--with Lady Anna, up-stairs?\" asked the maid.\n\n\"He is to be alone with her. How can I help it? If she chooses to be\na scullion she must follow her bent. I have done all I could. Why do\nyou wait? I tell you that he is to be with her. Go away, and leave\nme.\" Then they went and left her, wondering much, but guessing\nnothing of the truth. She watched them till they had closed the door,\nand then instantly opened the other window wide. It was now May, but\nthe weather was still cold. There had been rain the night before, and\nit had been showery all the morning. She had come in from her walk\ndamp and chilled, and there was a fire in the grate. But she cared\nnothing for the weather. Looking round the room she saw a morsel\nof wadding near the floor, and she instantly burned it. She longed\nto look at the pistol, but she did not dare to take it from its\nhiding-place lest she should be discovered in the act. Every energy\nof her mind was now strained to the effort of avoiding detection.\nShould he choose to tell what had been done, then, indeed, all would\nbe over. But had he not resolved to be silent he would hardly have\nborne the agony of the wound and gone up-stairs without speaking\nof it. She almost forgot now the misery of the last year in the\nintensity of her desire to escape the disgrace of punishment. A\nsudden nervousness, a desire to do something by which she might help\nto preserve herself, seized upon her. But there was nothing which she\ncould do. She could not follow him lest he should accuse her to her\nface. It would be vain for her to leave the house till he should have\ngone. Should she do so, she knew that she would not dare return to\nit. So she sat, thinking, dreaming, plotting, crushed by an agony of\nfear, looking anxiously at the door, listening for every footfall\nwithin the house; and she watched too for the well-known click of\nthe area gate, dreading lest any one should go out to seek the\nintervention of the constables.\n\nIn the meantime Daniel Thwaite had gone up-stairs, and had knocked at\nthe drawing-room door. It was instantly opened by Lady Anna herself.\n\"I heard you come;--what a time you have been here!--I thought that\nI should never see you.\" As she spoke she stood close to him that he\nmight embrace her. But the pain of his wound affected his whole body,\nand he felt that he could hardly raise even his right arm. He was\naware now that the bullet had entered his back, somewhere on his left\nshoulder. \"Oh, Daniel;--are you ill?\" she said, looking at him.\n\n\"Yes, dear;--I am ill;--not very ill. Did you hear nothing?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Nor yet see anything?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I will tell you all another time;--only do not ask me now.\" She had\nseated herself beside him and wound her arm round his back as though\nto support him. \"You must not touch me, dearest.\"\n\n\"You have been hurt.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I have been hurt. I am in pain, though I do not think that it\nsignifies. I had better go to a surgeon, and then you shall hear from\nme.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Daniel;--what is it, Daniel?\"\n\n\"I will tell you,--but not now. You shall know all, but I\nshould do harm were I to say it now. Say not a word to any one,\nsweetheart,--unless your mother ask you.\"\n\n\"What shall I tell her?\"\n\n\"That I am hurt,--but not seriously hurt;--and that the less said\nthe sooner mended. Tell her also that I shall expect no further\ninterruption to my letters when I write to you,--or to my visits when\nI can come. God bless you, dearest;--one kiss, and now I will go.\"\n\n\"You will send for me if you are ill, Daniel?\"\n\n\"If I am really ill, I will send for you.\" So saying, he left her,\nwent down-stairs, with great difficulty opened for himself the front\ndoor, and departed.\n\nLady Anna, though she had been told nothing of what had happened,\nexcept that her lover was hurt, at once surmised something of what\nhad been done. Daniel Thwaite had suffered some hurt from her\nmother's wrath. She sat for a while thinking what it might have been.\nShe had seen no sign of blood. Could it be that her mother had struck\nhim in her anger with some chance weapon that had come to hand? That\nthere had been violence she was sure,--and sure also that her mother\nhad been in fault. When Daniel had been some few minutes gone she\nwent down, that she might deliver his message. At the foot of the\nstairs, and near the door of the parlour, she met Mrs. Richards. \"I\nsuppose the young man has gone, my lady?\" asked the woman.\n\n\"Mr. Thwaite has gone.\"\n\n\"And I make so bold, my lady, as to say that he ought not to come\nhere. There has been a doing of some kind, but I don't know what. He\nsays as how he's been hurt, and I'm sure I don't know how he should\nbe hurt here,--unless he brought it with him. I never had nothing of\nthe kind here before, long as I've been here. Of course your title\nand that is all right, my lady; but the young man isn't fit;--that's\nthe truth of it. My belief is he'd been a drinking; and I won't have\nit in my house.\"\n\nLady Anna passed by her without a word and went into her mother's\nroom. The Countess was still seated in her chair, and neither rose\nnor spoke when her daughter entered. \"Mamma, Mr. Thwaite is hurt.\"\n\n\"Well;--what of it? Is it much that ails him?\"\n\n\"He is in pain. What has been done, mamma?\" The Countess looked at\nher, striving to learn from the girl's face and manner what had been\ntold and what concealed. \"Did you--strike him?\"\n\n\"Has he said that I struck him?\"\n\n\"No, mamma;--but something has been done that should not have been\ndone. I know it. He has sent you a message, mamma.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" asked the Countess, in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"That he was hurt, but not seriously.\"\n\n\"Oh;--he said that.\"\n\n\"I fear he is hurt seriously.\"\n\n\"But he said that he was not?\"\n\n\"Yes;--and that the less said the sooner mended.\"\n\n\"Did he say that too?\"\n\n\"That was his message.\"\n\nThe Countess gave a long sigh, then sobbed, and at last broke out\ninto hysteric tears. It was evident to her now that the man was\nsparing her,--was endeavouring to spare her. He had told no one as\nyet. \"The least said the soonest mended.\" Oh yes;--if he would say\nnever a word to any one of what had occurred between them that day,\nthat would be best for her. But how could he not tell? When some\ndoctor should ask him how he had come by that wound, surely he would\ntell then! It could not be possible that such a deed should have been\ndone there, in that little room, and that no one should know it! And\nwhy should he not tell,--he who was her enemy? Had she caught him at\nadvantage, would she not have smote him, hip and thigh? And then she\nreflected what it would be to owe perhaps her life to the mercy of\nDaniel Thwaite,--to the mercy of her enemy, of him who knew,--if no\none else should know,--that she had attempted to murder him. It would\nbe better for her, should she be spared to do so, to go away to some\ndistant land, where she might hide her head for ever.\n\n\"May I go to him, mamma, to see him?\" Lady Anna asked. The Countess,\nfull of her own thoughts, sat silent, answering not a word. \"I know\nwhere he lives, mamma, and I fear that he is much hurt.\"\n\n\"He will not--die,\" muttered the Countess.\n\n\"God forbid that he should die;--but I will go to him.\" Then she\nreturned up-stairs without a word of opposition from her mother, put\non her bonnet, and sallied forth. No one stopped her or said a word\nto her now, and she seemed to herself to be as free as air. She\nwalked up to the corner of Gower Street, and turned down into Bedford\nSquare, passing the house of the Serjeant. Then she asked her way\ninto Great Russell Street, which she found to be hardly more than a\nstone's throw from the Serjeant's door, and soon found the number at\nwhich her lover lived. No;--Mr. Thwaite was not at home. Yes;--she\nmight wait for him;--but he had no room but his bedroom. Then she\nbecame very bold. \"I am engaged to be his wife,\" she said. \"Are\nyou the Lady Anna?\" asked the woman, who had heard the story. Then\nshe was received with great distinction, and invited to sit down\nin a parlour on the ground-floor. There she sat for three hours,\nmotionless, alone,--waiting,--waiting,--waiting. When it was quite\ndark, at about six o'clock, Daniel Thwaite entered the room with his\nleft arm bound up. \"My girl!\" he said, with so much joy in his tone\nthat she could not but rejoice to hear him. \"So you have found me\nout, and have come to me!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have come. Tell me what it is. I know that you are hurt.\"\n\n\"I have been hurt certainly. The doctor wanted me to go into a\nhospital, but I trust that I may escape that. But I must take care of\nmyself. I had to come back here in a coach, because the man told me\nnot to walk.\"\n\n\"How was it, Daniel? Oh, Daniel, you will tell me everything?\"\n\nThen she sat beside him as he lay upon the couch, and listened to him\nwhile he told her the whole story. He hid nothing from her, but as he\nwent on he made her understand that it was his intention to conceal\nthe whole deed, to say nothing of it, so that the perpetrator\nshould escape punishment, if it might be possible. She listened in\nawe-struck silence as she heard the tale of her mother's guilt. And\nhe, with wonderful skill, with hearty love for the girl, and in true\nmercy to her feelings, palliated the crime of the would-be murderess.\n\"She was beside herself with grief and emotion,\" he said, \"and has\nhardly surprised me by what she has done. Had I thought of it, I\nshould almost have expected it.\"\n\n\"She may do it again, Daniel.\"\n\n\"I think not. She will be cowed now, and quieter. She did not\ninterfere when you told her that you were coming to me? It will be\na lesson to her, and so it may be good for us.\" Then he bade her to\ntell her mother that he, as far as he was concerned, would hold his\npeace. If she would forget all past injuries, so would he. If she\nwould hold out her hand to him, he would take it. If she could not\nbring herself to this,--could not bring herself as yet,--then let her\ngo apart. No notice should be taken of what she had done. \"But she\nmust not again stand between us,\" he said.\n\n\"Nothing shall stand between us,\" said Lady Anna.\n\nThen he told her, laughing as he did so, how hard it had been for\nhim to keep the story of his wound secret from the doctor, who had\nalready extracted the ball, and who was to visit him on the morrow.\nThe practitioner to whom he had gone, knowing nothing of gunshot\nwounds, had taken him to a first-class surgeon, and the surgeon had\nof course asked as to the cause of the wound. Daniel had said that it\nwas an accident as to which he could not explain the cause. \"You mean\nyou will not tell,\" said the surgeon. \"Exactly so. I will not tell.\nIt is my secret. That I did not do it myself you may judge from the\nspot in which I was shot.\" To this the surgeon assented; and, though\nhe pressed the question, and said something as to the necessity for\nan investigation, he could get no satisfaction. However, he had\nlearned Daniel's name and address. He was to call on the morrow, and\nwould then perhaps succeed in learning something of the mystery. \"In\nthe meantime, my darling, I must go to bed, for it seems as though\nevery bone in my body was sore. I have brought an old woman with me\nwho is to look after me.\"\n\nThen she left him, promising that she would come on the morrow and\nwould nurse him. \"Unless they lock me up, I will be here,\" she said.\nDaniel Thwaite thought that in the present circumstances no further\nattempt would be made to constrain her actions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nTHE LAWYERS AGREE.\n\n\nWhen a month had passed by a great many people knew how Mr. Daniel\nThwaite had come by the wound in his back, but nobody knew it\n\"officially.\" There is a wide difference in the qualities of\nknowledge regarding such matters. In affairs of public interest we\noften know, or fancy that we know, down to every exact detail, how a\nthing has been done,--who have given the bribes and who have taken\nthem,--who has told the lie and who has pretended to believe it,--who\nhas peculated and how the public purse has suffered,--who was in\nlove with such a one's wife and how the matter was detected, then\nsmothered up, and condoned; but there is no official knowledge, and\nnothing can be done. The tailor and the Earl, the Countess and her\ndaughter, had become public property since the great trial had been\ncommenced, and many eyes were on them. Before a week had gone by it\nwas known in every club and in every great drawing-room that the\ntailor had been shot in the shoulder,--and it was almost known that\nthe pistol had been fired by the hands of the Countess. The very\neminent surgeon into whose hands Daniel had luckily fallen did not\npress his questions very far when his patient told him that it would\nbe for the welfare of many people that nothing further should be\nasked on the matter. \"An accident has occurred,\" said Daniel, \"as to\nwhich I do not intend to say anything further. I can assure you that\nno injury has been done beyond that which I suffer.\" The eminent\nsurgeon no doubt spoke of the matter among his friends, but he always\ndeclared that he had no certain knowledge as to the hand which fired\nthe pistol.\n\nThe women in Keppel Street of course talked. There had certainly been\na smoke and a smell of gunpowder. Mrs. Richards had heard nothing.\nSarah thought that she had heard a noise. They both were sure that\nDaniel Thwaite had been much the worse for drink,--a statement which\nled to considerable confusion. No pistol was ever seen,--though\nthe weapon remained in the old desk for some days, and was at last\nconveyed out of the house when the Countess left it with all her\nbelongings. She had been afraid to hide it more stealthily or even\nthrow it away, lest her doing so should be discovered. Had the law\ninterfered,--had any search-warrant been granted,--the pistol would,\nof course, have been found. As it was, no one asked the Countess a\nquestion on the subject. The lawyers who had been her friends, and\nhad endeavoured to guide her through her difficulties, became afraid\nof her, and kept aloof from her. They had all gone over to the\nopinion that Lady Anna should be allowed to marry the tailor, and had\non that account become her enemies. She was completely isolated, and\nwas now spoken of mysteriously,--as a woman who had suffered much,\nand was nearly mad with grief, as a violent, determined, dangerous\nbeing, who was interesting as a subject for conversation, but one not\nat all desirable as an acquaintance. During the whole of this month\nthe Countess remained in Keppel Street, and was hardly ever seen by\nany but the inmates of that house.\n\nLady Anna had returned home all alone, on the evening of the day on\nwhich the deed had been done, after leaving her lover in the hands\nof the old nurse with whose services he had been furnished. The rain\nwas still falling as she came through Russell Square. The distance\nwas indeed short, but she was wet and cold and draggled when she\nreturned; and the criminality of the deed which her mother had\ncommitted had come fully home to her mind during the short journey.\nThe door was opened to her by Mrs. Richards, and she at once asked\nfor the Countess. \"Lady Anna, where have you been?\" asked Mrs.\nRichards, who was learning to take upon herself, during these\ntroubles, something of the privilege of finding fault. But Lady\nAnna put her aside without a word, and went into the parlour. There\nsat the Countess just as she had been left,--except that a pair of\ncandles stood upon the table, and that the tea-things had been laid\nthere. \"You are all wet,\" she said. \"Where have you been?\"\n\n\"He has told me all,\" the girl replied, without answering the\nquestion. \"Oh, mamma;--how could you do it?\"\n\n\"Who has driven me to it? It has been you,--you, you. Well;--what\nelse?\"\n\n\"Mamma, he has forgiven you.\"\n\n\"Forgiven me! I will not have his forgiveness.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma;--if I forgive you, will you not be friends with us?\" She\nstooped over her mother, and kissed her, and then went on and told\nwhat she had to tell. She stood and told it all in a low voice, so\nthat no ear but that of her mother should hear her,--how the ball had\nhit him, how it had been extracted, how nothing had been and nothing\nshould be told, how Daniel would forgive it all and be her friend,\nif she would let him. \"But, mamma, I hope you will be sorry.\" The\nCountess sat silent, moody, grim, with her eyes fixed on the table.\nShe would say nothing. \"And, mamma,--I must go to him every day,--to\ndo things for him and to help to nurse him. Of course he will be my\nhusband now.\" Still the Countess said not a word, either of approval\nor of dissent. Lady Anna sat down for a moment or two, hoping that\nher mother would allow her to eat and drink in the room, and that\nthus they might again begin to live together. But not a word was\nspoken nor a motion made, and the silence became awful, so that the\ngirl did not dare to keep her seat. \"Shall I go, mamma?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes;--you had better go.\" After that they did not see each other\nagain on that evening, and during the week or ten days following they\nlived apart.\n\nOn the following morning, after an early breakfast, Lady Anna went to\nGreat Russell Street, and there she remained the greater part of the\nday. The people of the house understood that the couple were to be\nmarried as soon as their lodger should be well, and had heard much of\nthe magnificence of the marriage. They were kind and good, and the\ntailor declared very often that this was the happiest period of his\nexistence. Of all the good turns ever done to him, he said, the wound\nin his back had been the best. As his sweetheart sat by his bedside\nthey planned their future life. They would still go to the distant\nland on which his heart was set, though it might be only for awhile;\nand she, with playfulness, declared that she would go there as Mrs.\nThwaite. \"I suppose they can't prevent me calling myself Mrs.\nThwaite, if I please.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said the tailor. \"Evil burs stick fast.\"\n\nIt would be vain now to tell of all the sweet lovers' words that were\nspoken between them during those long hours;--but the man believed\nthat no girl had ever been so true to her lover through so many\ndifficulties as Lady Anna had been to him, and she was sure that she\nhad never varied in her wish to become the wife of the man who had\nfirst asked her for her love. She thought much and she thought often\nof the young lord; but she took the impress of her lover's mind, and\nlearned to regard her cousin, the Earl, as an idle, pretty popinjay,\nborn to eat, to drink, and to carry sweet perfumes. \"Just a\nbutterfly,\" said the tailor.\n\n\"One of the brightest butterflies,\" said the girl.\n\n\"A woman should not be a butterfly,--not altogether a butterfly,\" he\nanswered. \"But for a man it is surely a contemptible part. Do you\nremember the young man who comes to Hotspur on the battlefield, or\nhim whom the king sent to Hamlet about the wager? When I saw Lord\nLovel at his breakfast table, I thought of them. I said to myself\nthat spermaceti was the 'sovereignest thing on earth for an inward\nwound,' and I told myself that he was of 'very soft society, and\ngreat showing.'\" She smiled, though she did not know the words he\nquoted, and assured him that her poor cousin Lord Lovel would not\ntrouble him much in the days that were to come. \"He will not trouble\nme at all, but as he is your cousin I would fain that he could be a\nman. He had a sort of gown on which would have made a grand frock for\nyou, sweetheart;--only too smart I fear for my wife.\" She laughed\nand was pleased,--and remembered without a shade either of regret\nor remorse the manner in which the popinjay had helped her over the\nstepping-stones at Bolton Abbey.\n\nBut the tailor, though he thus scorned the lord, was quite willing\nthat a share of the property should be given up to him. \"Unless you\ndid, how on earth could he wear such grand gowns as that? I can\nunderstand that he wants it more than I do, and if there are to be\nearls, I suppose they should be rich. We do not want it, my girl.\"\n\n\"You will have half, Daniel,\" she said.\n\n\"As far as that goes, I do not want a doit of it,--not a penny-piece.\nWhen they paid me what became my own by my father's will, I was rich\nenough,--rich enough for you and me too, my girl, if that was all.\nBut it is better that it should be divided. If he had it all he\nwould buy too many gowns; and it may be that with us some good will\ncome of it. As far as I can see, no good comes of money spent on\nrace-courses, and in gorgeous gowns.\"\n\nThis went on from day to day throughout a month, and every day Lady\nAnna took her place with her lover. After a while her mother came up\ninto the drawing-room in Keppel Street, and then the two ladies again\nlived together. Little or nothing, however, was said between them\nas to their future lives. The Countess was quiet, sullen,--and to a\nbystander would have appeared to be indifferent. She had been utterly\nvanquished by the awe inspired by her own deed, and by the fear which\nhad lasted for some days that she might be dragged to trial for the\noffence. As that dread subsided she was unable to recover her former\nspirits. She spoke no more of what she had done and what she had\nsuffered, but seemed to submit to the inevitable. She said nothing of\nany future life that might be in store for her, and, as far as her\ndaughter could perceive, had no plans formed for the coming time. At\nlast Lady Anna found it necessary to speak of her own plans. \"Mamma,\"\nshe said, \"Mr. Thwaite wishes that banns should be read in church for\nour marriage.\"\n\n\"Banns!\" exclaimed the Countess.\n\n\"Yes, mamma; he thinks it best.\" The Countess made no further\nobservation. If the thing was to be, it mattered little to her\nwhether they were to be married by banns or by licence,--whether her\ngirl should walk down to church like a maid-servant, or be married\nwith all the pomp and magnificence to which her rank and wealth might\nentitle her. How could there be splendour, how even decency, in such\na marriage as this? She at any rate would not be present, let them be\nmarried in what way they would. On the fourth Sunday after the shot\nhad been fired the banns were read for the first time in Bloomsbury\nChurch, and the future bride was described as Anna Lovel,--commonly\ncalled Lady Anna Lovel,--spinster. Neither on that occasion, or on\neither of the two further callings, did any one get up in church to\ndeclare that impediment existed why Daniel Thwaite the tailor and\nLady Anna Lovel should not be joined together in holy matrimony.\n\nIn the mean time the lawyers had been at work dividing the property,\nand in the process of doing so it had been necessary that Mr. Goffe\nshould have various interviews with the Countess. She also, as the\nundisputed widow of the late intestate Earl, was now a very rich\nwoman, with an immense income at her control. But no one wanted\nassistance from her. There was her revenue, and she was doomed to\nlive apart with it in her solitude,--with no fellow-creature to\nrejoice with her in her triumph, with no dependant whom she could\nmake happy with her wealth. She was a woman with many faults,--but\ncovetousness was not one of them. If she could have given it all\nto the young Earl,--and her daughter with it, she would have been\na happy woman. Had she been permitted to dream that it was all so\nsettled that her grandchild would become of all Earl Lovels the most\nwealthy and most splendid, she would have triumphed indeed. But, as\nit was, there was no spot in her future career brighter to her than\nthose long years of suffering which she had passed in the hope that\nsome day her child might be successful. Triumph indeed! There was\nnothing before her but solitude and shame.\n\nNevertheless she listened to Mr. Goffe, and signed the papers that\nwere put before her. When, however, he spoke to her of what was\nnecessary for the marriage,--as to the settlement, which must, Mr.\nGoffe said, be made as to the remaining moiety of her daughter's\nproperty,--she answered curtly that she knew nothing of that. Her\ndaughter's affairs were no concern of hers. She had, indeed, worked\nhard to establish her daughter's rights, but her daughter was now of\nage, and could do as she pleased with her own. She would not even\nremain in the room while the matter was being discussed. \"Lady Anna\nand I have separate interests,\" she said haughtily.\n\nLady Anna herself simply declared that half of her estate should be\nmade over to her cousin, and that the other half should go to her\nhusband. But the attorney was not satisfied to take instructions on\na matter of such moment from one so young. As to all that was to\nappertain to the Earl, the matter was settled. The Solicitor-General\nand Serjeant Bluestone had acceded to the arrangement, and the\nCountess herself had given her assent before she had utterly\nseparated her own interests from those of her daughter. In regard\nto so much, Mr. Goffe could go to work in conjunction with Mr.\nFlick without a scruple; but as to that other matter there must be\nconsultations, conferences, and solemn debate. The young lady, no\ndoubt, might do as she pleased; but lawyers can be very powerful. Sir\nWilliam was asked for his opinion, and suggested that Daniel Thwaite\nhimself should be invited to attend at Mr. Goffe's chambers, as soon\nas his wound would allow him to do so. Daniel, who did not care for\nhis wound so much as he should have done, was with Mr. Goffe on the\nfollowing morning, and heard a lengthy explanation from the attorney.\nThe Solicitor-General had been consulted;--this Mr. Goffe said,\nfeeling that a tailor would not have a word to say against so high\nan authority;--the Solicitor-General had been consulted, and was of\nopinion that Lady Anna's interests should be guarded with great care.\nA very large property, he might say a splendid estate, was concerned.\nMr. Thwaite of course understood that the family had been averse\nto this marriage,--naturally very averse. Now, however, they were\nprepared to yield.\n\nThe tailor interrupted the attorney at this period of his speech. \"We\ndon't want anybody to yield, Mr. Goffe. We are going to do what we\nplease, and don't know anything about yielding.\"\n\nMr. Goffe remarked that all that might be very well, but that, as so\nlarge a property was at stake, the friends of the lady, according to\nall usage, were bound to interfere. A settlement had already been\nmade in regard to the Earl.\n\n\"You mean, Mr. Goffe, that Lady Anna has given her cousin half her\nmoney?\"\n\nThe attorney went on to say that Mr. Thwaite might put it in that\nway if he pleased. The deeds had already been executed. With regard\nto the other moiety Mr. Thwaite would no doubt not object to a\ntrust-deed, by which it should be arranged that the money should be\ninvested in land, the interest to be appropriated to the use of Lady\nAnna, and the property be settled on the eldest son. Mr. Thwaite\nwould, of course, have the advantage of the income during his wife's\nlife. The attorney, in explaining all this, made an exceedingly good\nlegal exposition, and then waited for the tailor's assent.\n\n\"Are those Lady Anna's instructions?\"\n\nMr. Goffe replied that the proposal was made in accordance with the\nadvice of the Solicitor-General.\n\n\"I'll have nothing to do with such a settlement,\" said the tailor.\n\"Lady Anna has given away half her money, and may give away the\nwhole if she pleases. She will be the same to me whether she comes\nfull-handed or empty. But when she is my wife her property shall be\nmy property,--and when I die there shall be no such abomination as an\neldest son.\" Mr. Goffe was persuasive, eloquent, indignant, and very\nwise. All experience, all usage, all justice, all tradition, required\nthat there should be some such settlement as he had suggested. But it\nwas in vain. \"I don't want my wife to have anything of her own before\nmarriage,\" said he; \"but she certainly shall have nothing after\nmarriage,--independent of me.\" For a man with sound views of domestic\npower and marital rights always choose a Radical! In this case there\nwas no staying him. The girl was all on his side, and Mr. Goffe, with\ninfinite grief, was obliged to content himself with binding up a\ncertain portion of the property to make an income for the widow,\nshould the tailor die before his wife. And thus the tailor's marriage\nreceived the sanction of all the lawyers.\n\nA day or two after this Daniel Thwaite called upon the Countess.\nIt was now arranged that they should be married early in July, and\nquestions had arisen as to the manner of the ceremony. Who should\ngive away the bride? Of what nature should the marriage be? Should\nthere be any festival? Should there be bridesmaids? Where should they\ngo when they were married? What dresses should be bought? After what\nfashion should they be prepared to live? Those, and questions of a\nlike nature, required to be answered, and Lady Anna felt that these\nmatters should not be fixed without some reference to her mother.\nIt had been her most heartfelt desire to reconcile the Countess to\nthe marriage,--to obtain, at any rate, so much recognition as would\nenable her mother to be present in the church. But the Countess had\naltogether refused to speak on the subject, and had remained silent,\ngloomy, and impenetrable. Then Daniel had himself proposed that he\nwould see her, and on a certain morning he called. He sent up his\nname, with his compliments, and the Countess allowed him to be shown\ninto her room. Lady Anna had begged that it might be so, and she had\nyielded,--yielded without positive assent, as she had now done in\nall matters relating to this disastrous marriage. On that morning,\nhowever, she had spoken a word. \"If Mr. Thwaite chooses to see me, I\nmust be alone.\" And she was alone when the tailor was shown into the\nroom. Up to that day he had worn his arm in a sling,--and should then\nhave continued to do so; but, on this visit of peace to her who had\nattempted to be his murderer, he put aside this outward sign of the\ninjury she had inflicted on him. He smiled as he entered the room,\nand she rose to receive him. She was no longer a young woman;--and no\nwoman of her age or of any other had gone through rougher usage;--but\nshe could not keep the blood out of her cheeks as her eyes met\nhis, nor could she summon to her support that hard persistency of\noutward demeanour with which she had intended to arm herself for the\noccasion. \"So you have come to see me, Mr. Thwaite?\" she said.\n\n\"I have come, Lady Lovel, to shake hands with you, if it may be so,\nbefore my marriage with your daughter. It is her wish that we should\nbe friends,--and mine also.\" So saying, he put out his hand, and the\nCountess slowly gave him hers. \"I hope the time may come, Lady Lovel,\nwhen all animosity may be forgotten between you and me, and nothing\nbe borne in mind but the old friendship of former years.\"\n\n\"I do not know that that can be,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope it may be so. Time cures all things,--and I hope it may be\nso.\"\n\n\"There are sorrows, Mr. Thwaite, which no time can cure. You have\ntriumphed, and can look forward to the pleasures of success. I have\nbeen foiled, and beaten, and broken to pieces. With me the last is\nworse even than the first. I do not know that I can ever have another\nfriend. Your father was my friend.\"\n\n\"And I would be so also.\"\n\n\"You have been my enemy. All that he did to help me,--all that\nothers have done since to forward me on my way, has been brought\nto nothing--by you! My joys have been turned to grief, my rank has\nbeen made a disgrace, my wealth has become like ashes between my\nteeth;--and it has been your doing. They tell me that you will be my\ndaughter's husband. I know that it must be so. But I do not see that\nyou can be my friend.\"\n\n\"I had hoped to find you softer, Lady Lovel.\"\n\n\"It is not my nature to be soft. All this has not tended to make me\nsoft. If my daughter will let me know from time to time that she is\nalive, that is all that I shall require of her. As to her future\ncareer, I cannot interest myself in it as I had hoped to do.\nGood-bye, Mr. Thwaite. You need fear no further interference from\nme.\"\n\nSo the interview was over, and not a word had been said about the\nattempt at murder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nHARD LINES.\n\n\nAt the time that the murder was attempted Lord Lovel was in\nLondon,--and had seen Daniel Thwaite on that morning; but before any\nconfirmed rumour had reached his ears he had left London again on his\nroad to Yoxham. He knew now that he would be endowed with something\nlike ten thousand a year out of the wealth of the late Earl, but\nthat he would not have the hand of his fair cousin, the late Earl's\ndaughter. Perhaps it was as well as it was. The girl had never loved\nhim, and he could now choose for himself;--and need not choose till\nit should be his pleasure to settle himself as a married man. After\nall, his marriage with Lady Anna would have been a constrained\nmarriage,--a marriage which he would have accepted as the means of\nmaking his fortune. The girl certainly had pleased him;--but it\nmight be that a girl who preferred a tailor would not have continued\nto please him. At any rate he could not be unhappy with his\nnewly-acquired fortune, and he went down to Yoxham to receive the\ncongratulation of his friends, thinking that it would become him now\nto make some exertion towards reconciling his uncle and aunt to the\ncoming marriage.\n\n\"Have you heard anything about Mr. Thwaite?\" Mr. Flick said to him\nthe day before he started. The Earl had heard nothing. \"They say that\nhe has been wounded by a pistol-ball.\" Lord Lovel stayed some days at\na friend's house on his road into Yorkshire, and when he reached the\nrectory, the rector had received news from London. Mr. Thwaite the\ntailor had been murdered, and it was surmised that the deed had been\ndone by the Countess. \"I trust the papers were signed before you\nleft London,\" said the anxious rector. The documents making over\nthe property were all right, but the Earl would believe nothing of\nthe murder. Mr. Thwaite might have been wounded. He had heard so\nmuch before,--but he was quite sure that it had not been done by the\nCountess. On the following day further tidings came. Mr. Thwaite was\ndoing well, but everybody said that the attempt had been made by Lady\nLovel. Thus by degrees some idea of the facts as they had occurred\nwas received at the rectory.\n\n\"You don't mean that you want us to have Mr. Thwaite here?\" said the\nrector, holding up his hands, upon hearing a proposition made to him\nby his nephew a day or two later.\n\n\"Why not, uncle Charles?\"\n\n\"I couldn't do it. I really don't think your aunt could bring herself\nto sit down to table with him.\"\n\n\"Aunt Jane?\"\n\n\"Yes, your aunt Jane,--or your aunt Julia either.\" Now a quieter lady\nthan aunt Jane, or one less likely to turn up her nose at any guest\nwhom her husband should choose to entertain, did not exist.\n\n\"May I ask my aunts?\"\n\n\"What good can it do, Frederic?\"\n\n\"He's going to marry our cousin. He's not at all such a man as you\nseem to think.\"\n\n\"He has been a journeyman tailor all his life.\"\n\n\"You'll find he'll make a very good sort of gentleman. Sir William\nPatterson says that he'll be in Parliament before long.\"\n\n\"Sir William! Sir William is always meddling. I have never thought\nmuch about Sir William.\"\n\n\"Come, uncle Charles,--you should be fair. If we had gone on\nquarrelling and going to law, where should I have been now? I should\nnever have got a shilling out of the property. Everybody says so. No\ndoubt Sir William acted very wisely.\"\n\n\"I am no lawyer. I can't say how it might have been. But I may have\nmy doubts if I like. I have always understood that Lady Lovel, as you\nchoose to call her, was never Lord Lovel's wife. For twenty years I\nhave been sure of it, and I can't change so quickly as some other\npeople.\"\n\n\"She is Lady Lovel now. The King and Queen would receive her as such\nif she went to Court. Her daughter is Lady Anna Lovel.\"\n\n\"It may be so. It is possible.\"\n\n\"If it be not so,\" said the young lord thumping the table, \"where\nhave I got the money from?\" This was an argument that the rector\ncould not answer;--so he merely shook his head. \"I am bound to\nacknowledge them after taking her money.\"\n\n\"But not him. You haven't had any of his money. You needn't\nacknowledge him.\"\n\n\"We had better make the best of it, uncle Charles. He is going to\nmarry our cousin, and we should stand by her. Sir William very\nstrongly advises me to be present at the marriage, and to offer to\ngive her away.\"\n\n\"The girl you were going to marry yourself!\"\n\n\"Or else that you should do it. That of course would be better.\"\n\nThe rector of Yoxham groaned when the proposition was made to him.\nWhat infinite vexation of spirit and degradation had come to him from\nthese spurious Lovels during the last twelve months! He had been made\nto have the girl in his house and to give her precedence as Lady\nAnna, though he did not believe in her; he had been constrained to\ntreat her as the desired bride of his august nephew the Earl,--till\nshe had refused the Earl's hand; after he had again repudiated her\nand her mother because of her base attachment to a low-born artisan,\nhe had been made to re-accept her in spirit, because she had been\ngenerous to his nephew;--and now he was asked to stand at the altar\nand give her away to the tailor! And there could come to him neither\npleasure nor profit from the concern. All that he had endured he\nhad borne simply for the sake of his family and his nephew. \"She is\ndegrading us all,--as far as she belongs to us,\" said the rector. \"I\ncan't see why I should be asked to give her my countenance in doing\nit.\"\n\n\"Everybody says that it is very good of her to be true to the man she\nloved when she was poor and in obscurity. Sir William says--\"\n\n\"---- Sir William!\" muttered the rector between his teeth, as he\nturned away in disgust. What had been the first word of that minatory\nspeech Lord Lovel did not clearly hear. He had been brought up as\na boy by his uncle, and had never known his uncle to offend by\nswearing. No one in Yoxham would have believed it possible that the\nparson of the parish should have done so. Mrs. Grimes would have\ngiven evidence in any court in Yorkshire that it was absolutely\nimpossible. The archbishop would not have believed it though\nhis archdeacon had himself heard the word. All the man's known\nantecedents since he had been at Yoxham were against the probability.\nThe entire close at York would have been indignant had such an\naccusation been made. But his nephew in his heart of hearts believed\nthat the rector of Yoxham had damned the Solicitor-General.\n\nThere was, however, more cause for malediction, and further\nprovocations to wrath, in store for the rector. The Earl had not as\nyet opened all his budget, or let his uncle know the extent of the\nsacrifice that was to be demanded from him. Sir William had been very\nurgent with the young nobleman to accord everything that could be\naccorded to his cousin. \"It is not of course for me to dictate,\" he\nhad said, \"but as I have been allowed so far to give advice somewhat\nbeyond the scope of my profession, perhaps you will let me say that\nin mere honesty you owe her all that you can give. She has shared\neverything with you, and need have given nothing. And he, my lord,\nhad he been so minded, might no doubt have hindered her from doing\nwhat she has done. You owe it to your honour to accept her and her\nhusband with an open hand. Unless you can treat her with cousinly\nregard you should not have taken what has been given to you as a\ncousin. She has recognised you to your great advantage as the head of\nher family, and you should certainly recognise her as belonging to\nit. Let the marriage be held down at Yoxham. Get your uncle and aunt\nto ask her down. Do you give her away, and let your uncle marry them.\nIf you can put me up for a night in some neighbouring farm-house, I\nwill come and be a spectator. It will be for your honour to treat her\nafter that fashion.\" The programme was a large one, and the Earl felt\nthat there might be some difficulty.\n\nBut in the teeth of that dubious malediction he persevered, and his\nnext attack was upon aunt Julia. \"You liked her;--did you not?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I liked her.\" The tone implied great doubt. \"I liked her, till\nI found that she had forgotten herself.\"\n\n\"But she didn't forget herself. She just did what any girl would have\ndone, living as she was living. She has behaved nobly to me.\"\n\n\"She has behaved no doubt conscientiously.\"\n\n\"Come, aunt Julia! Did you ever know any other woman to give away\nten thousand a-year to a fellow simply because he was her cousin? We\nshould do something for her. Why should you not ask her down here\nagain?\"\n\n\"I don't think my brother would like it.\"\n\n\"He will if you tell him. And we must make a gentleman of him.\"\n\n\"My dear Frederic, you can never wash a blackamoor white.\"\n\n\"Let us try. Don't you oppose it. It behoves me, for my honour, to\nshow her some regard after what she has done for me.\"\n\nAunt Julia shook her head, and muttered to herself some further\nremark about negroes. The inhabitants of the Yoxham rectory,--who\nwere well born, ladies and gentlemen without a stain, who were\nhitherto free from all base intermarriages, and had nothing among\ntheir male cousins below soldiers and sailors, parsons and lawyers,\nwho had successfully opposed an intended marriage between a cousin in\nthe third degree and an attorney because the alliance was below the\nlevel of the Lovels, were peculiarly averse to any intermingling of\nranks. They were descended from ancient earls, and their chief was\nan earl of the present day. There was but one titled young lady now\namong them,--and she had only just won her right to be so considered.\nThere was but one Lady Anna,--and she was going to marry a tailor!\n\"Duty is duty,\" said aunt Julia as she hurried away. She meant her\nnephew to understand that duty commanded her to shut her heart\nagainst any cousin who could marry a tailor.\n\nThe lord next attacked aunt Jane. \"You wouldn't mind having her\nhere?\"\n\n\"Not if your uncle thought well of it,\" said Mrs. Lovel.\n\n\"I'll tell you what my scheme is.\" Then he told it all. Lady Anna\nwas to be invited to the rectory. The tailor was to be entertained\nsomewhere near on the night preceding his wedding. The marriage was\nto be celebrated by his uncle in Yoxham Church. Sir William was to\nbe asked to join them. And the whole thing was to be done exactly as\nthough they were all proud of the connection.\n\n\"Does your uncle know?\" asked Mrs. Lovel, who had been nearly stunned\nby the proposition.\n\n\"Not quite. I want you to suggest it. Only think, aunt Jane, what\nshe has done for us all!\" Aunt Jane couldn't think that very much\nhad been done for her. They were not to be enriched by the cousin's\nmoney. They had never been interested in the matter on their own\naccount. They wanted nothing. And yet they were to be called upon to\nhave a tailor at their board,--because Lord Lovel was the head of\ntheir family. But the Earl was the Earl; and poor Mrs. Lovel knew how\nmuch she owed to his position. \"If you wish it of course I'll tell\nhim, Frederic.\"\n\n\"I do wish it;--and I'll be so much obliged to you.\"\n\nThe next morning the parson had been told all that was required of\nhim, and he came down to prayers as black as a thunder-cloud. It had\nbeen before suggested to him that he should give the bride away, and\nthough he had grievously complained of the request, he knew that he\nmust do it should the Earl still demand it. He had no power to oppose\nthe head of the family. But he had never thought then that he would\nbe asked to pollute his own rectory by the presence of that odious\ntailor. While he was shaving that morning very religious ideas had\nfilled his mind. What a horrible thing was wickedness! All this evil\nhad come upon him and his because the late Earl had been so very\nwicked a man! He had sworn to his wife that he would not bear it.\nHe had done and was ready to do more almost than any other uncle in\nEngland. But this he could not endure. Yet when he was shaving, and\nthinking with religious horror of the iniquities of that iniquitous\nold lord, he knew that he would have to yield. \"I dare say they\nwouldn't come,\" said aunt Julia. \"He won't like to be with us any\nmore than we shall like to have him.\" There was some comfort in that\nhope; and trusting to it the rector had yielded everything before the\nthird day was over.\n\n\"And I may ask Sir William?\" said the Earl.\n\n\"Of course we shall be glad to see Sir William Patterson if you\nchoose to invite him,\" said the rector, still oppressed by gloom.\n\"Sir William Patterson is a gentleman no doubt, and a man of high\nstanding. Of course I and your aunt will be pleased to receive him.\nAs a lawyer I don't think much of him;--but that has nothing to do\nwith it.\" It may be remarked here that though Mr. Lovel lived for a\ngreat many years after the transactions which are here recorded, he\nnever gave way in reference to the case that had been tried. If the\nlawyers had persevered as they ought to have done, it would have been\nfound out that the Countess was no Countess, that the Lady Anna was\nno Lady Anna, and that all the money had belonged by right to the\nEarl. With that belief,--with that profession of belief,--he went to\nhis grave an old man of eighty.\n\nIn the meantime he consented that the invitation should be given. The\nCountess and her daughter were to be asked to Yoxham;--the use of the\nparish church was to be offered for the ceremony; he was to propose\nto marry them; the Earl was to give the bride away; and Daniel\nThwaite the tailor was to be asked to dine at Yoxham Rectory on the\nday before the marriage! The letters were to be written from the\nrectory by aunt Julia, and the Earl was to add what he pleased for\nhimself. \"I suppose this sort of trial is sent to us for our good,\"\nsaid the rector to his wife that night in the sanctity of their\nbedroom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nTHINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES.\n\n\nBut the Countess never gave way an inch. The following was the answer\nwhich she returned to the note written to her by aunt Julia;--\n\n\"The Countess Lovel presents her compliments to Miss Lovel. The\nCountess disapproves altogether of the marriage which is about to\ntake place between Lady Anna Lovel and Mr. Daniel Thwaite, and will\ntake no part in the ceremony.\"\n\n\"By heavens,--she is the best Lovel of us all,\" said the rector when\nhe read the letter.\n\nThis reply was received at Yoxham three days before any answer came\neither from Lady Anna or from the tailor. Daniel had received his\ncommunication from the young lord, who had called him \"Dear Mr.\nThwaite,\" who had written quite familiarly about the coming nuptials\nwith \"his cousin Anna,\"--had bade him come down and join the family\n\"like a good fellow,\"--and had signed himself, \"Yours always most\nsincerely, Lovel.\" \"It almost takes my breath away,\" said the tailor\nto his sweetheart, laughing.\n\n\"They are cousins, you know,\" said Lady Anna. \"And there was a little\ngirl there I loved so much.\"\n\n\"They can't but despise me, you know,\" said the tailor.\n\n\"Why should any one despise you?\"\n\n\"No one should,--unless I be mean and despicable. But they do,--you\nmay be sure. It is only human nature that they should. We are made of\ndifferent fabric,--though the stuff was originally the same. I don't\nthink I should be at my ease with them. I should be half afraid of\ntheir gilt and their gingerbread, and should be ashamed of myself\nbecause I was so. I should not know how to drink wine with them, and\nshould do a hundred things which would make them think me a beast.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you shouldn't hold up your head with any man in\nEngland,\" said Lady Anna.\n\n\"And so I ought;--but I shouldn't. I should be awed by those whom\nI feel to be my inferiors. I had rather not. We had better keep to\nourselves, dear!\" But the girl begged for some delay. It was a matter\nthat required to be considered. If it were necessary for her to\nquarrel with all her cousins for the sake of her husband,--with the\nbright fain\u00c3\u00a9ant young Earl, with aunts Jane and Julia, with her\ndarling Minnie, she would do so. The husband should be to her in\nall respects the first and foremost. For his sake, now that she had\nresolved that she would be his, she would if necessary separate\nherself from all the world. She had withstood the prayers of her\nmother, and she was sure that nothing else could move her. But if\nthe cousins were willing to accept her husband, why should he not be\nwilling to be accepted? Pride in him might be as weak as pride in\nthem. If they would put out their hands to him, why should he refuse\nto put out his own? \"Give me a day, Daniel, to think about it.\" He\ngave her the day, and then that great decider of all things, Sir\nWilliam, came to him, congratulating him, bidding him be of good\ncheer, and saying fine things of the Lovel family generally. Our\ntailor received him courteously, having learned to like the man,\nunderstanding that he had behaved with honesty and wisdom in regard\nto his client, and respecting him as one of the workers of the day;\nbut he declared that for the Lovel family, as a family,--\"he did not\ncare for them particularly.\" \"They are poles asunder from me,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Not so,\" replied Sir William. \"They were poles asunder, if you will.\nBut by your good fortune and merit, if you will allow me to say so,\nyou have travelled from the one pole very far towards the other.\"\n\n\"I like my own pole a deal the best, Sir William.\"\n\n\"I am an older man than you, Mr. Thwaite, and allow me to assure you\nthat you are wrong.\"\n\n\"Wrong in preferring those who work for their bread to those who eat\nit in idleness?\"\n\n\"Not that;--but wrong in thinking that there is not hard work done\nat the one pole as well as the other; and wrong also in not having\nperceived that the best men who come up from age to age are always\nmigrating from that pole which you say you prefer, to the antipodean\npole to which you are tending yourself. I can understand your feeling\nof contempt for an idle lordling, but you should remember that lords\nhave been made lords in nine cases out of ten for good work done by\nthem for the benefit of their country.\"\n\n\"Why should the children of lords be such to the tenth and twentieth\ngeneration?\"\n\n\"Come into parliament, Mr. Thwaite, and if you have views on that\nsubject opposed to hereditary peerages, express them there. It is a\nfair subject for argument. At present, I think that the sense of the\ncountry is in favour of an aristocracy of birth. But be that as it\nmay, do not allow yourself to despise that condition of society which\nit is the ambition of all men to enter.\"\n\n\"It is not my ambition.\"\n\n\"Pardon me. When you were a workman among workmen, did you not wish\nto be their leader? When you were foremost among them, did you not\nwish to be their master? If you were a master tradesman, would you\nnot wish to lead and guide your brother tradesmen? Would you not\ndesire wealth in order that you might be assisted by it in your views\nof ambition? If you were an alderman in your borough, would you\nnot wish to be the mayor? If mayor, would you not wish to be its\nrepresentative in Parliament? If in Parliament, would you not wish\nto be heard there? Would you not then clothe yourself as those among\nwhom you lived, eat as they ate, drink as they drank, keep their\nhours, fall into their habits, and be one of them? The theory of\nequality is very grand.\"\n\n\"The grandest thing in the world, Sir William.\"\n\n\"It is one to which all legislative and all human efforts should\nand must tend. All that is said and all that is done among people\nthat have emancipated themselves from the thraldom of individual\naggrandizement, serve to diminish in some degree the distance between\nthe high and the low. But could you establish absolute equality in\nEngland to-morrow, as it was to have been established in France some\nhalf century ago, the inequality of men's minds and character would\nre-establish an aristocracy within twenty years. The energetic, the\ntalented, the honest, and the unselfish will always be moving towards\nan aristocratic side of society, because their virtues will beget\nesteem, and esteem will beget wealth,--and wealth gives power for\ngood offices.\"\n\n\"As when one man throws away forty thousand a year on race-courses.\"\n\n\"When you make much water boil, Mr. Thwaite, some of it will probably\nboil over. When two men run a race, some strength must be wasted in\nfruitless steps beyond the goal. It is the fault of many patriotic\nmen that, in their desire to put down the evils which exist they will\nsee only the power that is wasted, and have no eyes for the good work\ndone. The subject is so large that I should like to discuss it with\nyou when we have more time. For the present let me beg of you, for\nyour own sake as well as for her who is to be your wife, that you\nwill not repudiate civility offered to you by her family. It will\nshow a higher manliness in you to go among them, and accept among\nthem the position which your wife's wealth and your own acquirements\nwill give you, than to stand aloof moodily because they are\naristocrats.\"\n\n\"You can make yourself understood when you speak, Sir William.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear you say so,\" said the lawyer, smiling.\n\n\"I cannot, and so you have the best of me. But you can't make me like\na lord, or think that a young man ought to wear a silk gown.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you that the silk gowns should be kept for their\nelders,\" and so the conversation was ended.\n\nDaniel Thwaite had not been made to like a lord, but the eloquence\nof the urbane lawyer was not wasted on him. Thinking of it all as he\nwandered alone through the streets, he began to believe that it would\nbe more manly to do as he was advised than to abstain because the\ndoing of the thing would in itself be disagreeable to him. On the\nfollowing day, Lady Anna was with him as usual; for the pretext of\nhis wound still afforded to her the means of paying to him those\ndaily visits which in happier circumstances he would naturally have\npaid to her. \"Would you like to go to Yoxham?\" he said. She looked\nwistfully up into his face. With her there was a real wish that the\npoles might be joined together by her future husband. She had found,\nas she had thought of it, that she could not make herself either\nhappy or contented except by marrying him, but it had not been\nwithout regret that she had consented to destroy altogether the link\nwhich bound her to the noble blood of the Lovels. She had been made\nto appreciate the sweet flavour of aristocratic influences, and now\nthat the Lovels were willing to receive her in spite of her marriage,\nshe was more than willing to accept their offered friendship. \"If you\nreally wish it, you shall go,\" he said.\n\n\"But you must go also.\"\n\n\"Yes;--for one day. And I must have a pair of gloves and a black\ncoat.\"\n\n\"And a blue one,--to be married in.\"\n\n\"Alas me! Must I have a pink silk gown to walk about in, early in the\nmorning?\"\n\n\"You shall if you like, and I'll make it for you.\"\n\n\"I'd sooner see you darning my worsted stockings, sweetheart.\"\n\n\"I can do that too.\"\n\n\"And I shall have to go to church in a coach, and come back in\nanother, and all the people will smell sweet, and make eyes at me\nbehind my back, and wonder among themselves how the tailor will\nbehave himself.\"\n\n\"The tailor must behave himself properly,\" said Lady Anna.\n\n\"That's just what he won't do,--and can't do. I know you'll be\nashamed of me, and then we shall both be unhappy.\"\n\n\"I won't be ashamed of you. I will never be ashamed of you. I will be\nashamed of them if they are not good to you. But, Daniel, you shall\nnot go if you do not like it. What does it all signify, if you are\nnot happy?\"\n\n\"I will go,\" said he. \"And now I'll sit down and write a letter to my\nlord.\"\n\nTwo letters were written accepting the invitation. As that from the\ntailor to the lord was short and characteristic it shall be given.\n\n\n   MY DEAR LORD,\n\n   I am much obliged to you for your lordship's invitation\n   to Yoxham, and if accepting it will make me a good fellow,\n   I will accept it. I fear, however, that I can never be a\n   proper fellow to your lordship. Not the less do I feel\n   your courtesy, and I am,\n\n   With all sincerity,\n   Your lordship's very obedient servant,\n\n   DANIEL THWAITE.\n\n\nLady Anna's reply to aunt Julia was longer and less sententious, but\nit signified her intention of going down to Yoxham a week before the\nday settled for the marriage, which was now the 10th of July. She was\nmuch obliged, she said, to the rector for his goodness in promising\nto marry them; and as she had no friends of her own she hoped that\nMinnie Lovel would be her bridesmaid. There were, however, sundry\nother letters before the ceremony was performed, and among them was\none in which she was asked to bring Miss Alice Bluestone down with\nher,--so that she might have one bridesmaid over and beyond those\nprovided by the Yoxham aristocracy. To this arrangement Miss Alice\nBluestone acceded joyfully,--in spite of that gulf, of which she had\nspoken;--and, so accompanied, but without her lady's-maid, Lady Anna\nreturned to Yoxham that she might be there bound in holy matrimony\nto Daniel Thwaite the tailor, by the hands of her cousin, the Rev.\nCharles Lovel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nTHE MARRIAGE.\n\n\nThe marriage was nearly all that a marriage should be when a Lady\nAnna is led to the hymeneal altar. As the ceremony was transferred\nfrom Bloomsbury, London, to Yoxham, in Yorkshire, a licence had been\nprocured, and the banns of which Daniel Thwaite thought so much, had\nbeen called in vain. Of course there are differences in aristocratic\nmarriages. All earls' daughters are not married at St. George's,\nHanover Square, nor is it absolutely necessary that a bishop should\ntie the knot, or that the dresses should be described in a newspaper.\nThis was essentially a quiet marriage,--but it was quiet with a\nsplendid quietude, and the obscurity of it was graceful and decorous.\nAs soon as the thing was settled,--when it was a matter past doubt\nthat all the Lovels were to sanction the marriage,--the two aunts\nwent to work heartily. Another Lovel girl, hardly more than seen\nbefore by any of the family, was gathered to the Lovel home as a\nthird bridesmaid, and for the fourth,--who should officiate, but the\neldest daughter of Lady Fitzwarren? The Fitzwarrens were not rich,\ndid not go to town annually, and the occasions for social brilliancy\nin the country are few and far between! Lady Fitzwarren did not like\nto refuse her old friend, Mrs. Lovel; and then Lady Anna was Lady\nAnna,--or at any rate would be so, as far as the newspapers of the\nday were concerned. Miss Fitzwarren allowed herself to be attired\nin white and blue, and to officiate in the procession,--having,\nhowever, assured her most intimate friend, Miss De Moleyns, that\nno consideration on earth should induce her to allow herself to be\nkissed by the tailor.\n\nIn the week previous to the arrival of Daniel Thwaite, Lady Anna\nagain ingratiated herself with the ladies at the rectory. During the\ndays of her persecution she had been silent and apparently hard;--but\nnow she was again gentle, yielding, and soft. \"I do like her manner,\nall the same,\" said Minnie. \"Yes, my dear. It's a pity that it should\nbe as it is to be, because she is very nice.\" Minnie loved her\nfriend, but thought it to be a thing of horror that her friend should\nmarry a tailor. It was almost as bad as the story of the Princess who\nhad to marry a bear;--worse indeed, for Minnie did not at all believe\nthat the tailor would ever turn out to be a gentleman, whereas she\nhad been sure from the first that the bear would turn into a prince.\n\nDaniel came to Yoxham, and saw very little of anybody at the rectory.\nHe was taken in at the house of a neighbouring squire, where he\ndined as a matter of course. He did call at the rectory, and saw his\nbride,--but on that occasion he did not even see the rector. The\nsquire took him to the church in the morning, dressed in a blue frock\ncoat, brown trousers, and a grey cravat. He was very much ashamed of\nhis own clothes, but there was nothing about him to attract attention\nhad not everybody known he was a tailor. The rector shook hands with\nhim politely but coldly. The ladies were more affectionate; and\nMinnie looked up into his face long and anxiously. \"He wasn't very\nnice,\" she said afterwards, \"but I thought he'd be worse than\nthat!\" When the marriage was over he kissed his wife, but made no\nattempt upon the bridesmaids. Then there was a breakfast at the\nrectory,--which was a very handsome bridal banquet. On such occasions\nthe part of the bride is always easily played. It is her duty to look\npretty if she can, and should she fail in that,--as brides usually\ndo,--her failure is attributed to the natural emotions of the\noccasion. The part of the bridegroom is more difficult. He should\nbe manly, pleasant, composed, never flippant, able to say a few\nwords when called upon, and quietly triumphant. This is almost more\nthan mortal can achieve, and bridegrooms generally manifest some\nshortcomings at the awful moment. Daniel Thwaite was not successful.\nHe was silent and almost morose. When Lady Fitzwarren congratulated\nhim with high-flown words and a smile,--a smile that was intended to\ncombine something of ridicule with something of civility,--he almost\nbroke down in his attempt to answer her. \"It is very good of you, my\nlady,\" said he. Then she turned her back and whispered a word to the\nparson, and Daniel was sure that she was laughing at him. The hero of\nthe day was the Solicitor-General. He made a speech, proposing health\nand prosperity to the newly-married couple. He referred, but just\nreferred, to the trial, expressing the pleasure which all concerned\nhad felt in recognising the rights and rank of the fair and noble\nbride as soon as the facts of the case had come to their knowledge.\nThen he spoke of the truth and long-continued friendship and devoted\nconstancy of the bridegroom and his father, saying that in the long\nexperience of his life he had known nothing more touching or more\ngraceful than the love which in early days had sprung up between the\nbeautiful young girl and her earliest friend. He considered it to be\namong the happinesses of his life that he had been able to make the\nacquaintance of Mr. Daniel Thwaite, and he expressed a hope that he\nmight long be allowed to regard that gentleman as his friend. There\nwas much applause, in giving which the young Earl was certainly the\nloudest. The rector could not bring himself to say a word. He was\nstriving to do his duty by the head of his family, but he could not\nbring himself to say that the marriage between Lady Anna Lovel and\nthe tailor was a happy event. Poor Daniel was compelled to make some\nspeech in reply to his friend, Sir William. \"I am bad at speaking,\"\nsaid he, \"and I hope I shall be excused. I can only say that I am\nunder deep obligation to Sir William Patterson for what he has done\nfor my wife.\"\n\nThe couple went away with a carriage and four horses to York, and the\nmarriage was over. \"I hope I have done right,\" said the rector in\nwhispered confidence to Lady Fitzwarren.\n\n\"I think you have, Mr. Lovel. I'm sure you have. The circumstances\nwere very difficult, but I am sure you have done right. She must\nalways be considered as the legitimate child of her father.\"\n\n\"They say so,\" murmured the rector sadly.\n\n\"Just that. And as she will always be considered to be the Lady Anna,\nyou were bound to treat her as you have done. It was a pity that\nit was not done earlier, so that she might have formed a worthier\nconnection. The Earl, however, has not been altogether overlooked,\nand there is some comfort in that. I dare say Mr. Thwaite may be\na good sort of man, though he is--not just what the family could\nhave wished.\" These words were undoubtedly spoken by her ladyship\nwith much pleasure. The Fitzwarrens were poor, and the Lovels were\nall rich. Even the young Earl was now fairly well to do in the\nworld,--thanks to the generosity of the newly-found cousin. It was,\ntherefore, pleasant to Lady Fitzwarren to allude to the family\nmisfortune which must in some degree alloy the prosperity of her\nfriends. Mr. Lovel understood it all, and sighed; but he felt no\nanger. He was grateful to Lady Fitzwarren for coming to his house at\nall on so mournful an occasion.\n\nAnd so we may bid farewell to Yoxham. The rector was an honest,\nsincere man, unselfish, true to his instincts, genuinely English,\ncharitable, hospitable, a doer of good to those around him. In\njudging of such a character we find the difficulty of drawing the\nline between political sagacity and political prejudice. Had he been\nother than he was, he would probably have been less serviceable in\nhis position.\n\nThe bride and bridegroom went for their honeymoon into Devonshire,\nand on their road they passed through London. Lady Anna Thwaite,--for\nshe had not at least as yet been able to drop her title,--wrote to\nher mother telling her of her arrival, and requesting permission to\nsee her. On the following day she went alone to Keppel Street and was\nadmitted. \"Dear, dear mamma,\" she said, throwing herself into the\narms of her mother.\n\n\"So it is done?\" said the Countess.\n\n\"Yes;--mamma,--we are married. I wrote to you from York.\"\n\n\"I got your letter, but I could not answer it. What could I say?\nI wish it had not been so;--but it is done. You have chosen for\nyourself, and I will not reproach you.\"\n\n\"Do not reproach me now, mamma.\"\n\n\"It would be useless. I will bear my sorrows in silence, such as they\nare. Do not talk to me of him, but tell me what is the life that is\nproposed for you.\"\n\nThey were to stay in the south of Devonshire for a month and then to\nsail for the new colony founded at the Antipodes. As to any permanent\nmode of life no definite plan had yet been formed. They were bound\nfor Sydney, and when there, \"my husband,\"--as Lady Anna called\nhim, thinking that the word might be less painful to the ears of\nher mother than the name of the man who had become so odious to\nher,--would do as should seem good to him. They would at any rate\nlearn something of the new world that was springing up, and he would\nthen be able to judge whether he would best serve the purpose that he\nhad at heart by remaining there or by returning to England. \"And now,\nmamma, what will you do?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said the Countess.\n\n\"But where will you live?\"\n\n\"If I could only find out, my child, where I might die, I would tell\nyou that.\"\n\n\"Mamma, do not talk to me of dying.\"\n\n\"How should I talk of my future life, my dear? For what should I\nlive? I had but you, and you have left me.\"\n\n\"Come with me, mamma.\"\n\n\"No, my dear. I could not live with him nor he with me. It will be\nbetter that he and I should never see each other again.\"\n\n\"But you will not stay here?\"\n\n\"No;--I shall not stay here. I must use myself to solitude, but the\nsolitude of London is unendurable. I shall go back to Cumberland if\nI can find a home there. The mountains will remind me of the days\nwhich, sad as they were, were less sad than the present. I little\ndreamed then when I had gained everything my loss would be so great\nas it has been. Was the Earl there?\"\n\n\"At our marriage? Oh yes, he was there.\"\n\n\"I shall ask him to do me a kindness. Perhaps he will let me live at\nLovel Grange?\"\n\nWhen the meeting was over Lady Anna returned to her husband\noverwhelmed with tears. She was almost broken-hearted when she asked\nherself whether she had in truth been cruel to her mother. But she\nknew not how she could have done other than she had done. Her mother\nhad endeavoured to conquer her by hard usage,--and had failed. But\nnot the less her heart was very sore. \"My dear,\" said the tailor to\nher, \"hearts will be sore. As the world goes yet awhile there must be\ninjustice; and sorrow will follow.\"\n\nWhen they had been gone from London about a month the Countess wrote\nto her cousin the Earl and told him her wishes. \"If you desire to\nlive there of course there must be an end of it. But if not, you\nmight let the old place to me. It will not be as if it were gone out\nof the family. I will do what I can for the people around me, so that\nthey may learn not to hate the name of Lovel.\"\n\nThe young lord told her that she should have the use of the house as\nlong as she pleased,--for her lifetime if it suited her to live there\nso long. As for rent,--of course he could take none after all that\nhad been done for him. But the place should be leased to her so that\nshe need not fear to be disturbed. When the spring time came, after\nthe sailing of the vessel which took the tailor and his wife off to\nthe Antipodes, Lady Lovel travelled down with her maid to Cumberland,\nleaving London without a friend to whom she could say adieu. And at\nLovel Grange she took up her abode, amidst the old furniture and the\nold pictures, with everything to remind her of the black tragedy of\nher youth, when her husband had come to her and had told her, with a\nsmile upon his lips and scorn in his eye, that she was not his wife,\nand that the child which she bore would be a bastard. Over his wicked\nword she had at any rate triumphed. Now she was living there in his\nhouse the unquestioned and undoubted Countess Lovel, the mistress of\nmuch of his wealth, while still were living around her those who had\nknown her when she was banished from her home. There, too often with\nill-directed generosity, she gave away her money, and became loved\nof the poor around her. But in the way of society she saw no human\nbeing, and rarely went beyond the valley in which stood the lonely\nhouse to which she had been brought as a bride.\n\nOf the further doings of Mr. Daniel Thwaite and his wife Lady\nAnna,--of how they travelled and saw many things; and how he became\nperhaps a wiser man,--the present writer may, he hopes, live to tell.\n\n\nPrinted by Virtue and Co., City Road, London.\n\n\n\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's note:\n\nObvious typographical errors have been corrected.\n\nSpecific changes in wording of the text are listed below.\n\n   Volume I, Chapter XIX, paragraph 43. The word \"Lady\" was changed\n   to \"Aunt\" in the sentence: Mrs. Lovel accompanied them, but AUNT\n   Julia made her farewells in the rectory drawing-room.\n\n   Volume II, Chapter XXXVII, paragraph 1. The word \"was\" was changed\n   to \"were\" in the sentence: The Countess had assented;--but when\n   the moment came, there WERE reasons against her sudden departure.\n\n   Volume II, Chapter XXXIX, paragraph 5. The word \"or\" was deleted\n   from the sentence: He pointed it out as a fact that the Earl had\n   not the slightest claim upon any portion of the estate,--not more\n   than he would have had if this money had come to Lady Anna from\n   her mother's instead of [OR] from her father's relatives.\n\n   Volume II, Chapter XXXIX, paragraph 6. The word \"not\" was deleted\n   from the sentence: If the Earl could get \u00c2\u00a310,000 a year by\n   amicable arrangement, the Solicitor-General would be shown to have\n   been right in the eyes of all men, and it was [NOT] probable,--as\n   both Mr. Goffe and Mr. Flick felt,--that he would not repudiate a\n   settlement of the family affairs by which he would be proved to\n   have been a discreet counsellor.\n\n   Volume II, Chapter XLV, paragraph 20. \"David\" was changed to\n   \"Daniel\" in the sentence: Neither on that occasion, or on either\n   of the two further callings, did any one get up in church to\n   declare that impediment existed why DANIEL Thwaite the tailor and\n   Lady Anna Lovel should not be joined together in holy matrimony.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LADY ANNA***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 31274-8.txt or 31274-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/3\/1\/2\/7\/31274\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":262,"split":"train"}
