Its main storyline features the courtship of the Rev. Mr Crawley's daughter, Grace, and Major Henry Grantly, son of the wealthy Archdeacon Grantly. The Archdeacon, although allowing that Grace is a lady, doesn't think her of high enough rank or wealth for his widowed son; his position is strengthened by the Reverend Mr Crawley's apparent crime. Almost broken by poverty and trouble, the Reverend Mr Crawley hardly knows himself if he is guilty or not; fortunately, the mystery is resolved just as Major Grantly's determination and Grace Crawley's own merit force the Archdeacon to overcome his prejudice against her as a daughter-in-law. As with Lucy Robarts in Framley Parsonage, the objecting parent finally invites the young lady into the family; this new connection also inspires the Dean and Archdeacon to find a new, more prosperous, post for Grace's impoverished father.\nThrough death or marriage, this final volume manages to tie up more than one thread from the beginning of the series. One subplot deals with the death of Mrs. Proudie, the virago wife of the Bishop of Barchester, and his subsequent grief and collapse. Mrs. Proudie, upon her arrival in Barchester in Barchester Towers, had increased the tribulations of the gentle Mr. Harding, title character of The Warden; he dies of a peaceful old age, mourned by his family and the old men he loved and looked after as Warden.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Last Chronicle of Barset, by Anthony\nTrollope\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

They,--the Walkers,--lived in a great brick\nhouse in the middle of the town, gave dinners, to which the county\ngentlemen not unfrequently condescended to come, and in a mild way\nled the fashion in Silverbridge. \"I can never bring myself to believe\nit, John,\" said Miss Walker.\n\n\"You'll have to bring yourself to believe it,\" said John, without\ntaking his eyes from his book.\n\n\"A clergyman,--and such a clergyman too!\"\n\n\"I don't see that that has anything to do with it.\" And as he now\nspoke, John did take his eyes off his book. \"Why should not a\nclergyman turn thief as well as anybody else? You girls always seem\nto forget that clergymen are only men after all.\"\n\n\"Their conduct is likely to be better than that of other men, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"I deny it utterly,\" said John Walker. \"I'll undertake to say that\nat this moment there are more clergymen in debt in Barsetshire than\nthere are either lawyers or doctors. This man has always been in\ndebt. Since he has been in the county I don't think he has ever been\nable to show his face in the High Street of Silverbridge.\"\n\n\"John, that is saying more than you have a right to say,\" said Mrs.\nWalker.\n\n\"Why, mother, this very cheque was given to a butcher who had\nthreatened a few days before to post bills all about the county,\ngiving an account of the debt that was due to him, if the money was\nnot paid at once.\"\n\n\"More shame for Mr. Fletcher,\" said Mary. \"He has made a fortune as\nbutcher in Silverbridge.\"\n\n\"What has that to do with it? Of course a man likes to have his\nmoney. He had written three times to the bishop, and he had sent\na man over to Hogglestock to get his little bill settled six days\nrunning. You see he got it at last. Of course, a tradesman must look\nfor his money.\"\n\n\"Mamma, do you think that Mr. Crawley stole the cheque?\" Mary, as she\nasked the question, came and stood over her mother, looking at her\nwith anxious eyes.\n\n\"I would rather give no opinion, my dear.\"\n\n\"But you must think something when everybody is talking about it,\nmamma.\"\n\n\"Of course my mother thinks he did,\" said John, going back to his\nbook. \"It is impossible that she should think otherwise.\"\n\n\"That is not fair, John,\" said Mrs. Walker; \"and I won't have you\nfabricate thoughts for me, or put the expression of them into my\nmouth. The whole affair is very painful, and as your father is\nengaged in the inquiry, I think that the less said about the matter\nin this house the better. I am sure that that would be your father's\nfeeling.\"\n\n\"Of course I should say nothing about it before him,\" said Mary. \"I\nknow that papa does not wish to have it talked about. But how is one\nto help thinking about such a thing? It would be so terrible for all\nof us who belong to the Church.\"\n\n\"I do not see that at all,\" said John. \"Mr. Crawley is not more than\nany other man just because he's a clergyman. I hate all that kind of\nclap-trap. There are a lot of people here in Silverbridge who think\nthe matter shouldn't be followed up, just because the man is in a\nposition which makes the crime more criminal in him than it would be\nin another.\"\n\n\"But I feel sure that Mr. Crawley has committed no crime at all,\"\nsaid Mary.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Walker, \"I have just said that I would rather\nyou would not talk about it. Papa will be in directly.\"\n\n\"I won't, mamma;--only--\"\n\n\"Only! yes; just only!\" said John. \"She'd go on till dinner if any\none would stay to hear her.\"\n\n\"You've said twice as much as I have, John.\" But John had left the\nroom before his sister's last words could reach him.\n\n\"You know, mamma, it is quite impossible not to help thinking of it,\"\nsaid Mary.\n\n\"I dare say it is, my dear.\"\n\n\"And when one knows the people it does make it so dreadful.\"\n\n\"But do you know them? I never spoke to Mr. Crawley in my life, and\nI do not think I ever saw her.\"\n\n\"I knew Grace very well,--when she used to come first to Miss\nPrettyman's school.\"\n\n\"Poor girl. I pity her.\"\n\n\"Pity her! Pity is no word for it, mamma. My heart bleeds for them.\nAnd yet I do not believe for a moment that he stole the cheque. How\ncan it be possible? For though he may have been in debt because they\nhave been so very, very poor; yet we all know that he has been an\nexcellent clergyman. When the Robartses were dining here last, I\nheard Mrs. Robarts say that for piety and devotion to his duties she\nhad hardly ever seen any one equal to him. And the Robartses know\nmore of them than anybody.\"\n\n\"They say that the dean is his great friend.\"\n\n\"What a pity it is that the Arabins should be away just now when he\nis in such trouble.\" And in this way the mother and daughter went\non discussing the question of the clergyman's guilt in spite of Mrs.\nWalker's previously expressed desire that nothing more might be said\nabout it. But Mrs. Walker, like many other mothers, was apt to be\nmore free in converse with her daughter than she was with her son.\nWhile they were thus talking the father came in from his office, and\nthen the subject was dropped. He was a man between fifty and sixty\nyears of age, with grey hair, rather short, and somewhat corpulent,\nbut still gifted with that amount of personal comeliness which\ncomfortable position and the respect of others will generally seem to\ngive. A man rarely carries himself meanly, whom the world holds high\nin esteem.\n\n\"I am very tired, my dear,\" said Mr. Walker.\n\n\"You look tired. Come and sit down for a few minutes before you\ndress. Mary, get your father's slippers.\" Mary instantly ran to the\ndoor.\n\n\"Thanks, my darling,\" said the father. And then he whispered to his\nwife, as soon as Mary was out of hearing, \"I fear that unfortunate\nman is guilty. I fear he is! I fear he is!\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens! what will become of them?\"\n\n\"What indeed? She has been with me to-day.\"\n\n\"Has she? And what could you say to her?\"\n\n\"I told her at first that I could not see her, and begged her not to\nspeak to me about it. I tried to make her understand that she should\ngo to some one else. But it was of no use.\"\n\n\"And how did it end?\"\n\n\"I asked her to go in to you, but she declined. She said you could do\nnothing for her.\"\n\n\"And does she think her husband guilty?\"\n\n\"No, indeed. She think him guilty! Nothing on earth,--or from heaven\neither, as I take it, would make her suppose it to be possible. She\ncame to me simply to tell me how good he was.\"\n\n\"I love her for that,\" said Mrs. Walker.\n\n\"So did I. But what is the good of loving her? Thank you, dearest.\nI'll get your slippers for you some day, perhaps.\"\n\nThe whole county was astir in this matter of this alleged guilt of\nthe Reverend Josiah Crawley,--the whole county, almost as keenly as\nthe family of Mr. Walker, of Silverbridge. The crime laid to his\ncharge was the theft of a cheque for twenty pounds, which he was said\nto have stolen out of a pocket-book left or dropped in his house, and\nto have passed as money into the hands of one Fletcher, a butcher\nof Silverbridge, to whom he was indebted. Mr. Crawley was in those\ndays the perpetual curate of Hogglestock, a parish in the northern\nextremity of East Barsetshire; a man known by all who knew anything\nof him to be very poor,--an unhappy, moody, disappointed man, upon\nwhom the troubles of the world always seemed to come with a double\nweight. But he had ever been respected as a clergyman, since his\nold friend Mr. Arabin, the dean of Barchester, had given him the\nsmall incumbency which he now held. Though moody, unhappy, and\ndisappointed, he was a hard-working, conscientious pastor among\nthe poor people with whom his lot was cast; for in the parish of\nHogglestock there resided only a few farmers higher in degree than\nfield labourers, brickmakers, and such like. Mr. Crawley had now\npassed some ten years of his life at Hogglestock; and during those\nyears he had worked very hard to do his duty, struggling to teach the\npeople around him perhaps too much of the mystery, but something also\nof the comfort, of religion. That he had become popular in his parish\ncannot be said of him. He was not a man to make himself popular in\nany position. I have said that he was moody and disappointed. He was\neven worse than this; he was morose, sometimes almost to insanity.\nThere had been days in which even his wife had found it impossible\nto deal with him otherwise than as with an acknowledged lunatic. And\nthis was known among the farmers, who talked about their clergyman\namong themselves as though he were a madman. But among the very poor,\namong the brickmakers of Hoggle End,--a lawless, drunken, terribly\nrough lot of humanity,--he was held in high respect; for they knew\nthat he lived hardly, as they lived; that he worked hard, as they\nworked; and that the outside world was hard to him, as it was to\nthem; and there had been an apparent sincerity of godliness about the\nman, and a manifest struggle to do his duty in spite of the world's\nill-usage, which had won its way even with the rough; so that Mr.\nCrawley's name had stood high with many in his parish, in spite of\nthe unfortunate peculiarity of his disposition. This was the man who\nwas now accused of stealing a cheque for twenty pounds.\n\nBut before the circumstances of the alleged theft are stated, a word\nor two must be said as to Mr. Crawley's family. It is declared that a\ngood wife is a crown to her husband, but Mrs. Crawley had been much\nmore than a crown to him. As had regarded all the inner life of the\nman,--all that portion of his life which had not been passed in the\npulpit or in pastoral teaching,--she had been crown, throne, and\nsceptre all in one. That she had endured with him and on his behalf\nthe miseries of poverty, and the troubles of a life which had known\nno smiles, is perhaps not to be alleged as much to her honour.\nShe had joined herself to him for better or worse, and it was her\nmanifest duty to bear such things; wives always have to bear them,\nknowing when they marry that they must take their chance. Mr. Crawley\nmight have been a bishop, and Mrs. Crawley, when she married him,\nperhaps thought it probable that such would be his fortune. Instead\nof that he was now, just as he was approaching his fiftieth year, a\nperpetual curate, with an income of one hundred and thirty pounds\nper annum,--and a family. That had been Mrs. Crawley's luck in life,\nand of course she bore it. But she had also done much more than\nthis. She had striven hard to be contented, or, rather, to appear\nto be contented, when he had been most wretched and most moody.\nShe had struggled to conceal from him her own conviction as to his\nhalf-insanity, treating him at the same time with the respect due\nto an honoured father of a family, and with the careful measured\nindulgence fit for a sick and wayward child. In all the terrible\ntroubles of their life her courage had been higher than his. The\nmetal of which she was made had been tempered to a steel which was\nvery rare and fine, but the rareness and fineness of which he had\nfailed to appreciate. He had often told her that she was without\npride, because she had stooped to receive from others, on his behalf\nand on behalf of her children, things which were very needful, but\nwhich she could not buy. He had told her that she was a beggar, and\nthat it was better to starve than to beg. She had borne the rebuke\nwithout a word in reply, and had then begged again for him, and had\nendured the starvation herself. Nothing in their poverty had, for\nyears past, been a shame to her; but every accident of their poverty\nwas still, and ever had been, a living disgrace to him.\n\n[Illustration: Mr. and Mrs. Crawley.]\n\nThey had had many children, and three were still alive. Of the\neldest, Grace Crawley, we shall hear much in the coming story. She\nwas at this time nineteen years old, and there were those who said\nthat, in spite of her poverty, her shabby outward apparel, and a\ncertain thin, unfledged, unrounded form of person, a want of fulness\nin the lines of her figure, she was the prettiest girl in that part\nof the world. She was living now at a school in Silverbridge, where\nfor the last year she had been a teacher; and there were many in\nSilverbridge who declared that very bright prospects were opening to\nher,--that young Major Grantly of Cosby Lodge, who, though a widower\nwith a young child, was the cynosure of all female eyes in and\nround Silverbridge, had found beauty in her thin face, and that\nGrace Crawley's fortune was made in the teeth, as it were, of the\nprevailing ill-fortune of her family. Bob Crawley, who was two years\nyounger, was now at Marlbro' School, from whence it was intended that\nhe should proceed to Cambridge, and be educated there at the expense\nof his godfather, Dean Arabin. In this also the world saw a stroke\nof good luck. But then nothing was lucky to Mr. Crawley. Bob, indeed,\nwho had done very well at school, might do well at Cambridge,--might\ndo great things there. But Mr. Crawley would almost have preferred\nthat the boy should work in the fields, than that he should be\neducated in a manner so manifestly eleemosynary. And then his\nclothes! How was he to be provided with clothes fit either for school\nor for college? But the dean and Mrs. Crawley between them managed\nthis, leaving Mr. Crawley very much in the dark, as Mrs. Crawley was\nin the habit of leaving him. Then there was a younger daughter, Jane,\nstill at home, who passed her life between her mother's work-table\nand her father's Greek, mending linen and learning to scan\niambics,--for Mr. Crawley in his early days had been a ripe scholar.\n\nAnd now there had come upon them all this terribly-crushing disaster.\nThat poor Mr. Crawley had gradually got himself into a mess of debt\nat Silverbridge, from which he was quite unable to extricate himself,\nwas generally known by all the world both of Silverbridge and\nHogglestock. To a great many it was known that Dean Arabin had\npaid money for him, very much contrary to his own consent, and\nthat he had quarrelled, or attempted to quarrel, with the dean in\nconsequence,--had so attempted, although the money had in part passed\nthrough his own hands. There had been one creditor, Fletcher, the\nbutcher of Silverbridge, who had of late been specially hard upon\npoor Crawley. This man, who had not been without good nature in his\ndealings, had heard stories of the dean's good-will and such like,\nand had loudly expressed his opinion that the perpetual curate of\nHogglestock would show a higher pride in allowing himself to be\nindebted to a rich brother clergyman, than in remaining under thrall\nto a butcher. And thus a rumour had grown up. And then the butcher\nhad written repeated letters to the bishop,--to Bishop Proudie of\nBarchester, who had at first caused his chaplain to answer them,\nand had told Mr. Crawley somewhat roundly what was his opinion of a\nclergyman who eat meat and did not pay for it. But nothing that the\nbishop could say or do enabled Mr. Crawley to pay the butcher. It was\nvery grievous to such a man as Mr. Crawley to receive these letters\nfrom such a man as Bishop Proudie; but the letters came, and made\nfestering wounds, but then there was an end of them. And at last\nthere had come forth from the butcher's shop a threat that if the\nmoney were not paid by a certain date, printed bills should be posted\nabout the county. All who heard of this in Silverbridge were very\nangry with Mr. Fletcher, for no one there had ever known a tradesman\nto take such a step before; but Fletcher swore that he would\npersevere, and defended himself by showing that six or seven months\nsince, in the spring of the year, Mr. Crawley had been paying money\nin Silverbridge, but had paid none to him,--to him who had been not\nonly his earliest, but his most enduring creditor. \"He got money\nfrom the dean in March,\" said Mr. Fletcher to Mr. Walker, \"and he\npaid twelve pounds ten to Green, and seventeen pounds to Grobury,\nthe baker.\" It was that seventeen pounds to Grobury, the baker, for\nflour, which made the butcher so fixedly determined to smite the\npoor clergyman hip and thigh. \"And he paid money to Hall, and to Mrs.\nHolt, and to a deal more; but he never came near my shop. If he had\neven shown himself, I would not have said so much about it.\" And then\na day before the date named, Mrs. Crawley had come to Silverbridge,\nand had paid the butcher twenty pounds in four five-pound notes. So\nfar Fletcher the butcher had been successful.\n\nSome six weeks after this, inquiry began to be made as to a certain\ncheque for twenty pounds drawn by Lord Lufton on his bankers in\nLondon, which cheque had been lost early in the spring by Mr. Soames,\nLord Lufton's man of business in Barsetshire, together with a\npocket-book in which it had been folded. This pocket-book Soames had\nbelieved himself to have left at Mr. Crawley's house, and had gone\nso far, even at the time of the loss, as to express his absolute\nconviction that he had so left it. He was in the habit of paying a\nrentcharge to Mr. Crawley on behalf of Lord Lufton, amounting to\ntwenty pounds four shillings, every half-year. Lord Lufton held\nthe large tithes of Hogglestock, and paid annually a sum of forty\npounds eight shillings to the incumbent. This amount was, as a rule,\nremitted punctually by Mr. Soames through the post. On the occasion\nnow spoken of, he had had some reason for visiting Hogglestock, and\nhad paid the money personally to Mr. Crawley. Of so much there was\nno doubt. But he had paid it by a cheque drawn by himself on his\nown bankers at Barchester, and that cheque had been cashed in the\nordinary way on the next morning. On returning to his own house in\nBarchester he had missed his pocket-book, and had written to Mr.\nCrawley to make inquiry. There had been no money in it, beyond the\ncheque drawn by Lord Lufton for twenty pounds. Mr. Crawley had\nanswered this letter by another, saying that no pocket-book had been\nfound in his house. All this had happened in March.\n\nIn October, Mrs. Crawley paid the twenty pounds to Fletcher, the\nbutcher, and in November Lord Lufton's cheque was traced back through\nthe Barchester bank to Mr. Crawley's hands. A brickmaker of Hoggle\nEnd, much favoured by Mr. Crawley, had asked for change over the\ncounter of this Barchester bank,--not, as will be understood,\nthe bank on which the cheque was drawn--and had received it. The\naccommodation had been refused to the man at first, but when he\npresented the cheque the second day, bearing Mr. Crawley's name on\nthe back of it, together with a note from Mr. Crawley himself, the\nmoney had been given for it; and the identical notes so paid had been\ngiven to Fletcher, the butcher, on the next day by Mrs. Crawley. When\ninquiry was made, Mr. Crawley stated that the cheque had been paid\nto him by Mr. Soames, on behalf of the rentcharge due to him by Lord\nLufton. But the error of this statement was at once made manifest.\nThere was the cheque, signed by Mr. Soames himself, for the exact\namount,--twenty pounds four shillings. As he himself declared, he had\nnever in his life paid money on behalf of Lord Lufton by a cheque\ndrawn by his lordship. The cheque given by Lord Lufton, and which had\nbeen lost, had been a private matter between them. His lordship had\nsimply wanted change in his pocket, and his agent had given it to\nhim. Mr. Crawley was speedily shown to be altogether wrong in the\nstatement made to account for possession of the cheque.\n\nThen he became very moody and would say nothing further. But his\nwife, who had known nothing of his first statement when made, came\nforward and declared that she believed the cheque for twenty pounds\nto be a part of a present given by Dean Arabin to her husband in\nApril last. There had been, she said, great heartburnings about\nthis gift, and she had hardly dared to speak to her husband on the\nsubject. An execution had been threatened in the house by Grobury,\nthe baker, of which the dean had heard. Then there had been some\nscenes at the deanery between her husband and the dean and Mrs.\nArabin, as to which she had subsequently heard much from Mrs. Arabin.\nMrs. Arabin had told her that money had been given,--and at last\ntaken. Indeed, so much had been very apparent, as bills had been paid\nto the amount of at least fifty pounds. When the threat made by the\nbutcher had reached her husband's ears, the effect upon him had been\nvery grievous. All this was the story told by Mrs. Crawley to Mr.\nWalker, the lawyer, when he was pushing his inquiries. She, poor\nwoman, at any rate told all that she knew. Her husband had told her\none morning, when the butcher's threat was weighing heavily on his\nmind, speaking to her in such a humour that she found it impossible\nto cross-question him, that he had still money left, though it was\nmoney which he had hoped that he would not be driven to use; and he\nhad given her the four five-pound notes, and had told her to go to\nSilverbridge and satisfy the man who was so eager for his money. She\nhad done so, and had felt no doubt that the money so forthcoming had\nbeen given by the dean. That was the story as told by Mrs. Crawley.\n\nBut how could she explain her husband's statement as to the cheque,\nwhich had been shown to be altogether false? All this passed between\nMr. Walker and Mrs. Crawley, and the lawyer was very gentle with her.\nIn the first stages of the inquiry he had simply desired to learn the\ntruth, and place the clergyman above suspicion. Latterly, being bound\nas he was to follow the matter up officially, he would not have seen\nMrs. Crawley, had he been able to escape that lady's importunity.\n\"Mr. Walker,\" she had said, at last, \"you do not know my husband.\nNo one knows him but I. It is hard to have to tell you of all our\ntroubles.\" \"If I can lessen them, trust me that I will do so,\" said\nthe lawyer. \"No one, I think, can lessen them in this world,\" said\nthe lady. \"The truth is, sir, that my husband often knows not what\nhe says. When he declared that the money had been paid to him by Mr.\nSoames, most certainly he thought so. There are times when in his\nmisery he knows not what he says,--when he forgets everything.\"\n\nUp to this period Mr. Walker had not suspected Mr. Crawley of\nanything dishonest, nor did he suspect him as yet. The poor man had\nprobably received the money from the dean, and had told the lie about\nit, not choosing to own that he had taken money from his rich friend,\nand thinking that there would be no further inquiry. He had been very\nfoolish, and that would be the end of it. Mr. Soames was by no means\nso good-natured in his belief. \"How should my pocket-book have got\ninto Dean Arabin's hands?\" said Mr. Soames, almost triumphantly. \"And\nthen I felt sure at the time that I had left it at Crawley's house!\"\n\nMr. Walker wrote a letter to the dean, who at that moment was in\nFlorence, on his way to Rome, from whence he was going on to the Holy\nLand. There came back a letter from Mr. Arabin, saying that on the\n17th of March he had given to Mr. Crawley a sum of fifty pounds, and\nthat the payment had been made with five Bank of England notes of\nten pounds each, which had been handed by him to his friend in the\nlibrary at the deanery. The letter was very short, and may, perhaps,\nbe described as having been almost curt. Mr. Walker, in his anxiety\nto do the best he could for Mr. Crawley, had simply asked a question\nas to the nature of the transaction between the two gentlemen, saying\nthat no doubt the dean's answer would clear up a little mystery which\nexisted at present respecting a cheque for twenty pounds. The dean\nin answer simply stated the fact as it has been given above; but\nhe wrote to Mr. Crawley begging to know what was in truth this new\ndifficulty, and offering any assistance in his power. He explained\nall the circumstances of the money, as he remembered them. The sum\nadvanced had certainly consisted of fifty pounds, and there had\ncertainly been five Bank of England notes. He had put the notes\ninto an envelope, which he had not closed, but had addressed to Mr.\nCrawley, and had placed this envelope in his friend's hands. He went\non to say that Mrs. Arabin would have written, but that she was in\nParis with her son. Mrs. Arabin was to remain in Paris during his\nabsence in the Holy Land, and meet him in Italy on his return. As\nshe was so much nearer at hand, the dean expressed a hope that Mrs.\nCrawley would apply to her if there was any trouble.\n\nThe letter to Mr. Walker was conclusive as to the dean's money. Mr.\nCrawley had not received Lord Lufton's cheque from the dean. Then\nwhence had he received it? The poor wife was left by the lawyer to\nobtain further information from her husband. Ah, who can tell how\nterrible were the scenes between that poor pair of wretches, as the\nwife endeavoured to learn the truth from her miserable, half-maddened\nhusband! That her husband had been honest throughout, she had not\nany shadow of doubt. She did not doubt that to her at least he\nendeavoured to tell the truth, as far as his poor racked imperfect\nmemory would allow him to remember what was true and what was not\ntrue. The upshot of it all was that the husband declared that he\nstill believed that the money had come to him from the dean. He had\nkept it by him, not wishing to use it if he could help it. He had\nforgotten it,--so he said at times,--having understood from Arabin\nthat he was to have fifty pounds, and having received more. If it had\nnot come to him from the dean, then it had been sent to him by the\nPrince of Evil for his utter undoing; and there were times in which\nhe seemed to think that such had been the manner in which the fatal\ncheque had reached him. In all that he said he was terribly confused,\ncontradictory, unintelligible,--speaking almost as a madman might\nspeak,--ending always by declaring that the cruelty of the world had\nbeen too much for him, that the waters were meeting over his head,\nand praying for God's mercy to remove him from the world. It need\nhardly be said that his poor wife in these days had a burden on her\nshoulders that was more than enough to crush any woman.\n\nShe at last acknowledged to Mr. Walker that she could not account\nfor the twenty pounds. She herself would write again to the dean\nabout it, but she hardly hoped for any further assistance there. \"The\ndean's answer is very plain,\" said Mr. Walker. \"He says that he gave\nMr. Crawley five ten-pound notes, and those five notes we have traced\nto Mr. Crawley's hands.\" Then Mrs. Crawley could say nothing further\nbeyond making protestations of her husband's innocence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nBY HEAVENS HE HAD BETTER NOT!\n\n\nI must ask the reader to make the acquaintance of Major Grantly of\nCosby Lodge, before he is introduced to the family of Mr. Crawley, at\ntheir parsonage in Hogglestock. It has been said that Major Grantly\nhad thrown a favourable eye on Grace Crawley,--by which report\noccasion was given to all men and women in those parts to hint that\nthe Crawleys, with all their piety and humility, were very cunning,\nand that one of the Grantlys was,--to say the least of it,--very\nsoft, admitted as it was throughout the county of Barsetshire,\nthat there was no family therein more widely awake to the affairs\ngenerally of this world and the next combined, than the family of\nwhich Archdeacon Grantly was the respected head and patriarch. Mrs.\nWalker, the most good-natured woman in Silverbridge, had acknowledged\nto her daughter that she could not understand it,--that she could not\nsee anything at all in Grace Crawley. Mr. Walker had shrugged his\nshoulders and expressed a confident belief that Major Grantly had\nnot a shilling of his own beyond his half-pay and his late wife's\nfortune, which was only six thousand pounds. Others, who were\nill-natured, had declared that Grace Crawley was little better than a\nbeggar, and that she could not possibly have acquired the manners of\na gentlewoman. Fletcher the butcher had wondered whether the major\nwould pay his future father-in-law's debts; and Dr. Tempest, the\nold rector of Silverbridge, whose four daughters were all as yet\nunmarried, had turned up his old nose, and had hinted that half-pay\nmajors did not get caught in marriage so easily as that.\n\nSuch and such like had been the expressions of the opinion of\nmen and women in Silverbridge. But the matter had been discussed\nfurther afield than at Silverbridge, and had been allowed to intrude\nitself as a most unwelcome subject into the family conclave of the\narchdeacon's rectory. To those who have not as yet learned the fact\nfrom the public character and well-appreciated reputation of the\nman, let it be known that Archdeacon Grantly was at this time, as\nhe had been for many years previously, Archdeacon of Barchester and\nRector of Plumstead Episcopi. A rich and prosperous man he had ever\nbeen,--though he also had had his sore troubles, as we all have,--his\nhaving arisen chiefly from want of that higher ecclesiastical\npromotion which his soul had coveted, and for which the whole tenour\nof his life had especially fitted him. Now, in his green old age, he\nhad ceased to covet, but had not ceased to repine. He had ceased to\ncovet aught for himself, but still coveted much for his children; and\nfor him such a marriage as this which was now suggested for his son\nwas encompassed almost with the bitterness of death. \"I think it\nwould kill me,\" he had said to his wife; \"by heavens, I think it\nwould be my death!\"\n\nA daughter of the archdeacon had made a splendid matrimonial\nalliance,--so splendid that its history was at the time known to all\nthe aristocracy of the county, and had not been altogether forgotten\nby any of those who keep themselves well instructed in the details of\nthe peerage. Griselda Grantly had married Lord Dumbello, the eldest\nson of the Marquis of Hartletop,--than whom no English nobleman was\nmore puissant, if broad acres, many castles, high title, and stars\nand ribbons are any signs of puissance,--and she was now, herself,\nMarchioness of Hartletop, with a little Lord Dumbello of her own. The\ndaughter's visits to the parsonage of her father were of necessity\nrare, such necessity having come from her own altered sphere of life.\nA Marchioness of Hartletop has special duties which will hardly\npermit her to devote herself frequently to the humdrum society of a\nclerical father and mother. That it would be so, father and mother\nhad understood when they sent the fortunate girl forth to a higher\nworld. But, now and again, since her August marriage, she had laid\nher coroneted head upon one of the old rectory pillows for a night\nor so, and on such occasions all the Plumsteadians had been loud in\npraise of her condescension. Now it happened that when this second\nand more aggravated blast of the evil wind reached the rectory,--the\nrenewed waft of the tidings as to Major Grantly's infatuation\nregarding Miss Grace Crawley, which, on its renewal, seemed to bring\nwith it something of confirmation,--it chanced, I say, that at that\nmoment Griselda, Marchioness of Hartletop, was gracing the paternal\nmansion. It need hardly be said that the father was not slow to\ninvoke such a daughter's counsel, and such a sister's aid.\n\nI am not quite sure that the mother would have been equally quick to\nask her daughter's advice, had she been left in the matter entirely\nto her own propensities. Mrs. Grantly had ever loved her daughter\ndearly, and had been very proud of that great success in life which\nGriselda had achieved; but in late years, the child had become,\nas a woman, separate from the mother, and there had arisen, not\nunnaturally, a break of that close confidence which in early years\nhad existed between them. Griselda, Marchioness of Hartletop,\nwas more than ever a daughter to the archdeacon, even though he\nmight never see her. Nothing could rob him of the honour of such a\nprogeny,--nothing, even though there had been actual estrangement\nbetween them. But it was not so with Mrs. Grantly. Griselda had\ndone very well, and Mrs. Grantly had rejoiced; but she had lost her\nchild. Now the major, who had done well also, though in a much lesser\ndegree, was still her child, moving in the same sphere of life with\nher, still dependent in a great degree upon his father's bounty, a\nneighbour in the county, a frequent visitor at the parsonage, and\na visitor who could be received without any of that trouble which\nattended the unfrequent comings of Griselda, the marchioness, to the\nhome of her youth. And for this reason Mrs. Grantly, terribly put out\nas she was at the idea of a marriage between her son and one standing\nso poorly in the world's esteem as Grace Crawley, would not have\nbrought forward the matter before her daughter, had she been left\nto her own desires. A marchioness in one's family is a tower of\nstrength, no doubt; but there are counsellors so strong that we\ndo not wish to trust them, lest in the trusting we ourselves be\noverwhelmed by their strength. Now Mrs. Grantly was by no means\nwilling to throw her influence into the hands of her titled daughter.\n\nBut the titled daughter was consulted and gave her advice. On the\noccasion of the present visit to Plumstead she had consented to lay\nher head for two nights on the parsonage pillows, and on the second\nevening her brother the major was to come over from Cosby Lodge\nto meet her. Before his coming the affair of Grace Crawley was\ndiscussed.\n\n\"It would break my heart, Griselda,\" said the archdeacon,\npiteously--\"and your mother's.\"\n\n\"There is nothing against the girl's character,\" said Mrs. Grantly,\n\"and the father and mother are gentlefolks by birth; but such a\nmarriage for Henry would be very unseemly.\"\n\n\"To make it worse, there is this terrible story about him,\" said the\narchdeacon.\n\n\"I don't suppose there is much in that,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"I can't say. There is no knowing. They told me to-day in Barchester\nthat Soames is pressing the case against him.\"\n\n\"Who is Soames, papa?\" asked the marchioness.\n\n\"He is Lord Lufton's man of business, my dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord Lufton's man of business!\" There was something of a sneer\nin the tone of the lady's voice as she mentioned Lord Lufton's name.\n\n\"I am told,\" continued the archdeacon, \"that Soames declares the\ncheque was taken from a pocket-book which he left by accident in\nCrawley's house.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say, archdeacon, that you think that Mr.\nCrawley--a clergyman--stole it!\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"I don't say anything of the kind, my dear. But supposing Mr. Crawley\nto be as honest as the sun, you wouldn't wish Henry to marry his\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said the mother. \"It would be an unfitting marriage.\nThe poor girl has had no advantages.\"\n\n\"He is not able even to pay his baker's bill. I always thought Arabin\nwas very wrong to place such a man in such a parish as Hogglestock.\nOf course the family could not live there.\" The Arabin here spoken of\nwas Dr. Arabin, dean of Barchester. The dean and the archdeacon had\nmarried sisters, and there was much intimacy between the families.\n\n\"After all it is only a rumour as yet,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"Fothergill told me only yesterday, that he sees her almost every\nday,\" said the father. \"What are we to do, Griselda? You know how\nheadstrong Henry is.\" The marchioness sat quite still, looking at the\nfire, and made no immediate answer to this address.\n\n\"There is nothing for it, but that you should tell him what you\nthink,\" said the mother.\n\n\"If his sister were to speak to him, it might do much,\" said the\narchdeacon. To this Mrs. Grantly said nothing; but Mrs. Grantly's\ndaughter understood very well that her mother's confidence in her was\nnot equal to her father's. Lady Hartletop said nothing, but still\nsat, with impassive face, and eyes fixed upon the fire. \"I think\nthat if you were to speak to him, Griselda, and tell him that he\nwould disgrace his family, he would be ashamed to go on with such a\nmarriage,\" said the father. \"He would feel, connected as he is with\nLord Hartletop--\"\n\n\"I don't think he would feel anything about that,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"I dare say not,\" said Lady Hartletop.\n\n\"I am sure he ought to feel it,\" said the father. They were all\nsilent, and sat looking at the fire.\n\n\"I suppose, papa, you allow Henry an income,\" said Lady Hartletop,\nafter a while.\n\n\"Indeed I do,--eight hundred a year.\"\n\n\"Then I think I should tell him that that must depend upon his\nconduct. Mamma, if you won't mind ringing the bell, I will send\nfor Cecile, and go upstairs and dress.\" Then the marchioness went\nupstairs to dress, and in about an hour the major arrived in his\ndog-cart. He also was allowed to go upstairs to dress before anything\nwas said to him about his great offence.\n\n\"Griselda is right,\" said the archdeacon, speaking to his wife out of\nhis dressing-room. \"She always was right. I never knew a young woman\nwith more sense than Griselda.\"\n\n\"But you do not mean to say that in any event you would stop Henry's\nincome?\" Mrs. Grantly also was dressing, and made reply out of her\nbedroom.\n\n\"Upon my word, I don't know. As a father I would do anything to\nprevent such a marriage as that.\"\n\n\"But if he did marry her in spite of the threat? And he would if he\nhad once said so.\"\n\n\"Is a father's word, then, to go for nothing; and a father who allows\nhis son eight hundred a year? If he told the girl that he would be\nruined she couldn't hold him to it.\"\n\n\"My dear, they'd know as well as I do, that you would give way after\nthree months.\"\n\n\"But why should I give way? Good heavens--!\"\n\n\"Of course you'd give way, and of course we should have the young\nwoman here, and of course we should make the best of it.\"\n\nThe idea of having Grace Crawley as a daughter at the Plumstead\nRectory was too much for the archdeacon, and he resented it by\nadditional vehemence in the tone of his voice, and a nearer personal\napproach to the wife of his bosom. All unaccoutred as he was, he\nstood in the doorway between the two rooms, and thence fulminated\nat his wife his assurances that he would never allow himself to be\nimmersed in such a depth of humility as that she had suggested. \"I\ncan tell you this, then, that if ever she comes here, I shall take\ncare to be away. I will never receive her here. You can do as you\nplease.\"\n\n\"That is just what I cannot do. If I could do as I pleased, I would\nput a stop to it at once.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that you want to encourage him. A child about sixteen\nyears of age!\"\n\n\"I am told she is nineteen.\"\n\n\"What does it matter if she was fifty-nine? Think of what her\nbringing up has been. Think what it would be to have all the Crawleys\nin our house for ever, and all their debts, and all their disgrace!\"\n\n\"I do not know that they have ever been disgraced.\"\n\n\"You'll see. The whole county has heard of the affair of this twenty\npounds. Look at that dear girl upstairs, who has been such a comfort\nto us. Do you think it would be fit that she and her husband should\nmeet such a one as Grace Crawley at our table?\"\n\n\"I don't think it would do them a bit of harm,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\"But there would be no chance of that, seeing that Griselda's husband\nnever comes to us.\"\n\n\"He was here the year before last.\"\n\n\"And I never was so tired of a man in all my life.\"\n\n\"Then you prefer the Crawleys, I suppose. This is what you get from\nEleanor's teaching.\" Eleanor was the dean's wife, and Mrs. Grantly's\nyounger sister. \"It has always been a sorrow to me that I ever\nbrought Arabin into the diocese.\"\n\n\"I never asked you to bring him, archdeacon. But nobody was so glad\nas you when he proposed to Eleanor.\"\n\n\"Well, the long and the short of it is this, I shall tell Henry\nto-night that if he makes a fool of himself with this girl, he must\nnot look to me any longer for an income. He has about six hundred\na year of his own, and if he chooses to throw himself away, he had\nbetter go and live in the south of France, or in Canada, or where he\npleases. He shan't come here.\"\n\n\"I hope he won't marry the girl, with all my heart,\" said Mrs.\nGrantly.\n\n\"He had better not. By heavens, he had better not!\"\n\n\"But if he does, you'll be the first to forgive him.\"\n\nOn hearing this the archdeacon slammed the door, and retired to his\nwashing apparatus. At the present moment he was very angry with his\nwife, but then he was so accustomed to such anger, and was so well\naware that it in truth meant nothing, that it did not make him\nunhappy. The archdeacon and Mrs. Grantly had now been man and\nwife for more than a quarter of a century, and had never in truth\nquarrelled. He had the most profound respect for her judgment, and\nthe most implicit reliance on her conduct. She had never yet offended\nhim, or caused him to repent the hour in which he had made her Mrs.\nGrantly. But she had come to understand that she might use a woman's\nprivilege with her tongue; and she used it,--not altogether to his\ncomfort. On the present occasion he was the more annoyed because he\nfelt that she might be right. \"It would be a positive disgrace, and\nI never would see him again,\" he said to himself. And yet as he said\nit, he knew that he would not have the strength of character to carry\nhim through a prolonged quarrel with his son. \"I never would see\nher,--never, never!\" he said to himself. \"And then such an opening as\nhe might have at his sister's house.\"\n\nMajor Grantly had been a successful man in life,--with the one\nexception of having lost the mother of his child within a twelvemonth\nof his marriage and within a few hours of that child's birth. He had\nserved in India as a very young man, and had been decorated with the\nVictoria Cross. Then he had married a lady with some money, and had\nleft the active service of the army, with the concurring advice of\nhis own family and that of his wife. He had taken a small place in\nhis father's county, but the wife for whose comfort he had taken it\nhad died before she was permitted to see it. Nevertheless he had gone\nto reside there, hunting a good deal and farming a little, making\nhimself popular in the district, and keeping up the good name of\nGrantly in a successful way, till--alas,--it had seemed good to him\nto throw those favouring eyes on poor Grace Crawley. His wife had\nnow been dead just two years, and as he was still under thirty,\nno one could deny it would be right that he should marry again.\nNo one did deny it. His father had hinted that he ought to do so,\nand had generously whispered that if some little increase to the\nmajor's present income were needed, he might possibly be able to do\nsomething. \"What is the good of keeping it?\" the archdeacon had said\nin liberal after-dinner warmth; \"I only want it for your brother and\nyourself.\" The brother was a clergyman.\n\nAnd the major's mother had strongly advised him to marry again\nwithout loss of time. \"My dear Henry,\" she had said, \"you'll never be\nyounger, and youth does go for something. As for dear little Edith,\nbeing a girl, she is almost no impediment. Do you know those two\ngirls at Chaldicotes?\"\n\n\"What, Mrs. Thorne's nieces?\"\n\n\"No; they are not her nieces but her cousins. Emily Dunstable is very\nhandsome;--and as for money--!\"\n\n\"But what about birth, mother?\"\n\n\"One can't have everything, my dear.\"\n\n\"As far as I am concerned, I should like to have everything or\nnothing,\" the major had said laughing. Now for him to think of Grace\nCrawley after that,--of Grace Crawley who had no money, and no\nparticular birth, and not even beauty itself,--so at least Mrs.\nGrantly said,--who had not even enjoyed the ordinary education of\na lady, was too bad. Nothing had been wanting to Emily Dunstable's\neducation, and it was calculated that she would have at least twenty\nthousand pounds on the day of her marriage.\n\nThe disappointment to the mother would be the more sore because\nshe had gone to work upon her little scheme with reference to Miss\nEmily Dunstable, and had at first, as she thought, seen her way to\nsuccess,--to success in spite of the disparaging words which her\nson had spoken to her. Mrs. Thorne's house at Chaldicotes,--or Dr.\nThorne's house as it should, perhaps, be more properly called, for\nDr. Thorne was the husband of Mrs. Thorne,--was in these days the\npleasantest house in Barsetshire. No one saw so much company as the\nThornes, or spent so much money in so pleasant a way. The great\ncounty families, the Pallisers and the De Courcys, the Luftons\nand the Greshams, were no doubt grander, and some of them were\nperhaps richer than the Chaldicote Thornes,--as they were called to\ndistinguish them from the Thornes of Ullathorne; but none of these\npeople were so pleasant in their ways, so free in their hospitality,\nor so easy in their modes of living, as the doctor and his wife.\nWhen first Chaldicotes, a very old country seat, had by the chances\nof war fallen into their hands and been newly furnished, and newly\ndecorated, and newly gardened, and newly greenhoused and hot-watered\nby them, many of the county people had turned up their noses at\nthem. Dear old Lady Lufton had done so, and had been greatly\ngrieved,--saying nothing, however, of her grief, when her son and\ndaughter-in-law had broken away from her, and submitted themselves to\nthe blandishments of the doctor's wife. And the Grantlys had stood\naloof, partly influenced, no doubt, by their dear and intimate old\nfriend Miss Monica Thorne of Ullathorne, a lady of the very old\nschool, who, though good as gold and kind as charity, could not\nendure that an interloping Mrs. Thorne, who never had a grandfather,\nshould come to honour and glory in the county, simply because of her\nriches. Miss Monica Thorne stood out, but Mrs. Grantly gave way, and\nhaving once given way found that Dr. Thorne, and Mrs. Thorne, and\nEmily Dunstable, and Chaldicote House together, were very charming.\nAnd the major had been once there with her, and had made himself\nvery pleasant, and there had certainly been some little passage\nof incipient love between him and Miss Dunstable, as to which Mrs.\nThorne, who managed everything, seemed to be well pleased. This had\nbeen after the first mention made by Mrs. Grantly to her son of Emily\nDunstable's name, but before she had heard any faintest whispers of\nhis fancy for Grace Crawley; and she had therefore been justified\nin hoping,--almost in expecting, that Emily Dunstable would be her\ndaughter-in-law, and was therefore the more aggrieved when this\nterrible Crawley peril first opened itself before her eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON'S THREAT.\n\n\nThe dinner-party at the rectory comprised none but the Grantly\nfamily. The marchioness had written to say that she preferred to have\nit so. The father had suggested that the Thornes of Ullathorne, very\nold friends, might be asked, and the Greshams from Boxall Hill, and\nhad even promised to endeavour to get old Lady Lufton over to the\nrectory, Lady Lufton having in former years been Griselda's warm\nfriend. But Lady Hartletop had preferred to see her dear father\nand mother in privacy. Her brother Henry she would be glad to meet,\nand hoped to make some arrangement with him for a short visit to\nHartlebury, her husband's place in Shropshire,--as to which latter\nhint, it may, however, be at once said, that nothing further was\nspoken after the Crawley alliance had been suggested. And there had\nbeen a very sore point mooted by the daughter in a request made\nby her to her father that she might not be called upon to meet\nher grandfather, her mother's father, Mr. Harding, a clergyman of\nBarchester, who was now stricken in years.--\"Papa would not have\ncome,\" said Mrs. Grantly, \"but I think,--I do think--\" Then she\nstopped herself.\n\n\"Your father has odd ways sometimes, my dear. You know how fond I am\nof having him here myself.\"\n\n\"It does not signify,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"Do not let us say anything\nmore about it. Of course we cannot have everything. I am told the\nchild does her duty in her sphere of life, and I suppose we ought to\nbe contented.\" Then Mrs. Grantly went up to her own room, and there\nshe cried. Nothing was said to the major on the unpleasant subject\nof the Crawleys before dinner. He met his sister in the drawing-room,\nand was allowed to kiss her noble cheek. \"I hope Edith is well,\nHenry,\" said the sister. \"Quite well; and little Dumbello is the\nsame, I hope?\" \"Thank you, yes; quite well.\" Then there seemed to\nbe nothing more to be said between the two. The major never made\ninquiries after the august family, or would allow it to appear that\nhe was conscious of being shone upon by the wife of a marquis. Any\nadulation which Griselda received of that kind came from her father,\nand, therefore, unconsciously she had learned to think that her\nfather was better bred than the other members of her family, and more\nfitted by nature to move in that sacred circle to which she herself\nhad been exalted. We need not dwell upon the dinner, which was but a\ndull affair. Mrs. Grantly strove to carry on the family party exactly\nas it would have been carried on had her daughter married the son\nof some neighbouring squire; but she herself was conscious of the\nstruggle, and the fact of there being a struggle produced failure.\nThe rector's servants treated the daughter of the house with special\nawe, and the marchioness herself moved, and spoke, and ate, and drank\nwith a cold magnificence, which I think had become a second nature\nwith her, but which was not on that account the less oppressive.\nEven the archdeacon, who enjoyed something in that which was so\ndisagreeable to his wife, felt a relief when he was left alone after\ndinner with his son. He felt relieved as his son got up to open the\ndoor for his mother and sister, but was aware at the same time that\nhe had before him a most difficult and possibly a most disastrous\ntask. His dear son Henry was not a man to be talked smoothly out of,\nor into, any propriety. He had a will of his own, and having hitherto\nbeen a successful man, who in youth had fallen into few youthful\ntroubles,--who had never justified his father in using stern parental\nauthority,--was not now inclined to bend his neck. \"Henry,\" said the\narchdeacon, \"what are you drinking? That's '34 port, but it's not\njust what it should be. Shall I send for another bottle?\"\n\n\"It will do for me, sir. I shall only take a glass.\"\n\n\"I shall drink two or three glasses of claret. But you young fellows\nhave become so desperately temperate.\"\n\n\"We take our wine at dinner, sir.\"\n\n\"By-the-by, how well Griselda is looking.\"\n\n\"Yes, she is. It's always easy for women to look well when they're\nrich.\" How would Grace Crawley look, then, who was poor as poverty\nitself, and who should remain poor, if his son was fool enough to\nmarry her? That was the train of thought which ran through the\narchdeacon's mind. \"I do not think much of riches,\" said he, \"but\nit is always well that a gentleman's wife or a gentleman's daughter\nshould have a sufficiency to maintain her position in life.\"\n\n\"You may say the same, sir, of everybody's wife and everybody's\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean, Henry.\"\n\n\"I am not quite sure that I do, sir.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I had better speak out at once. A rumour has reached your\nmother and me, which we don't believe for a moment, but which,\nnevertheless, makes us unhappy even as a report. They say that there\nis a young woman living in Silverbridge to whom you are becoming\nattached.\"\n\n\"Is there any reason why I should not become attached to a young\nwoman in Silverbridge?--though I hope any young woman to whom I may\nbecome attached will be worthy at any rate of being called a young\nlady.\"\n\n\"I hope so, Henry; I hope so. I do hope so.\"\n\n\"So much I will promise, sir; but I will promise nothing more.\"\n\nThe archdeacon looked across into his son's face, and his heart sank\nwithin him. His son's voice and his son's eyes seemed to tell him two\nthings. They seemed to tell him, firstly, that the rumour about Grace\nCrawley was true; and, secondly, that the major was resolved not to\nbe talked out of his folly. \"But you are not engaged to any one, are\nyou?\" said the archdeacon. The son did not at first make any answer,\nand then the father repeated the question. \"Considering our mutual\npositions, Henry, I think you ought to tell me if you are engaged.\"\n\n\"I am not engaged. Had I become so, I should have taken the first\nopportunity of telling either you or my mother.\"\n\n\"Thank God. Now, my dear boy, I can speak out more plainly. The young\nwoman whose name I have heard is daughter to that Mr. Crawley who is\nperpetual curate at Hogglestock. I knew that there could be nothing\nin it.\"\n\n\"But there is something in it, sir.\"\n\n\"What is there in it? Do not keep me in suspense, Henry. What is it\nyou mean?\"\n\n\"It is rather hard to be cross-questioned in this way on such a\nsubject. When you express yourself as thankful that there is nothing\nin the rumour, I am forced to stop you, as otherwise it is possible\nthat hereafter you may say that I have deceived you.\"\n\n\"But you don't mean to marry her?\"\n\n\"I certainly do not mean to pledge myself not to do so.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me, Henry, that you are in love with Miss\nCrawley?\" Then there was another pause, during which the archdeacon\nsat looking for an answer; but the major said never a word. \"Am I to\nsuppose that you intend to lower yourself by marrying a young woman\nwho cannot possibly have enjoyed any of the advantages of a lady's\neducation? I say nothing of the imprudence of the thing; nothing of\nher own want of fortune; nothing of your having to maintain a whole\nfamily steeped in poverty; nothing of the debts and character of the\nfather, upon whom, as I understand, at this moment there rests a very\ngrave suspicion of--of--of--what I'm afraid I must call downright\ntheft.\"\n\n\"Downright theft, certainly, if he were guilty.\"\n\n\"I say nothing of all that; but looking at the young woman herself--\"\n\n\"She is simply the best educated girl whom it has ever been my lot to\nmeet.\"\n\n\"Henry, I have a right to expect that you will be honest with me.\"\n\n\"I am honest with you.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to ask this girl to marry you?\"\n\n\"I do not think that you have any right to ask me that question,\nsir.\"\n\n\"I have a right at any rate to tell you this, that if you so far\ndisgrace yourself and me, I shall consider myself bound to withdraw\nfrom you all the sanction which would be conveyed by my--my--my\ncontinued assistance.\"\n\n\"Do you intend me to understand that you will stop my income?\"\n\n\"Certainly I should.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, I think you would behave to me most cruelly. You advised\nme to give up my profession.\"\n\n\"Not in order that you might marry Grace Crawley.\"\n\n\"I claim the privilege of a man of my age to do as I please in\nsuch a matter as marriage. Miss Crawley is a lady. Her father is a\nclergyman, as is mine. Her father's oldest friend is my uncle. There\nis nothing on earth against her except her poverty. I do not think I\never heard of such cruelty on a father's part.\"\n\n\"Very well, Henry.\"\n\n\"I have endeavoured to do my duty by you, sir, always; and by my\nmother. You can treat me in this way, if you please, but it will not\nhave any effect on my conduct. You can stop my allowance to-morrow,\nif you like it. I had not as yet made up my mind to make an offer to\nMiss Crawley, but I shall now do so to-morrow morning.\"\n\nThis was very bad indeed, and the archdeacon was extremely unhappy.\nHe was by no means at heart a cruel man. He loved his children\ndearly. If this disagreeable marriage were to take place, he would\ndoubtless do exactly as his wife had predicted. He would not stop his\nson's income for a single quarter; and, though he went on telling\nhimself that he would stop it, he knew in his own heart that any\nsuch severity was beyond his power. He was a generous man in money\nmatters,--having a dislike for poverty which was not generous,--and\nfor his own sake could not have endured to see a son of his in want.\nBut he was terribly anxious to exercise the power which the use of\nthe threat might give him. \"Henry,\" he said, \"you are treating me\nbadly, very badly. My anxiety has always been for the welfare of\nmy children. Do you think that Miss Crawley would be a fitting\nsister-in-law for that dear girl upstairs?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do, or for any other dear girl in the world; excepting\nthat Griselda, who is not clever, would hardly be able to appreciate\nMiss Crawley, who is clever.\"\n\n\"Griselda not clever! Good heavens!\" Then there was another pause,\nand as the major said nothing, the father continued his entreaties.\n\"Pray, pray think of what my wishes are, and your mother's. You are\nnot committed as yet. Pray think of us while there is time. I would\nrather double your income if I saw you marry any one that we could\nname here.\"\n\n\"I have enough as it is, if I may only be allowed to know that it\nwill not be capriciously withdrawn.\" The archdeacon filled his glass\nunconsciously, and sipped his wine, while he thought what further\nhe might say. Perhaps it might be better that he should say nothing\nfurther at the present moment. The major, however, was indiscreet,\nand pushed the question. \"May I understand, sir, that your threat is\nwithdrawn, and that my income is secure?\"\n\n\"What, if you marry this girl?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; will my income be continued to me if I marry Miss\nCrawley?\"\n\n\"No, it will not.\" Then the father got up hastily, pushed the\ndecanter back angrily from his hand, and without saying another word\nwalked away into the drawing-room. That evening at the rectory was\nvery gloomy. The archdeacon now and again said a word or two to his\ndaughter, and his daughter answered him in monosyllables. The major\nsat apart moodily, and spoke to no one. Mrs. Grantly, understanding\nwell what had passed, knew that nothing could be done at the present\nmoment to restore family comfort; so she sat by the fire and knitted.\nExactly at ten they all went to bed.\n\n\"Dear Henry,\" said the mother to her son the next morning; \"think\nmuch of yourself, and of your child, and of us, before you take any\ngreat step in life.\"\n\n\"I will, mother,\" said he. Then he went out and put on his wrapper,\nand got into his dog-cart, and drove himself off to Silverbridge. He\nhad not spoken to his father since they were in the dining-room on\nthe previous evening. When he started, the marchioness had not yet\ncome downstairs; but at eleven she breakfasted, and at twelve she\nalso was taken away. Poor Mrs. Grantly had not had much comfort from\nher children's visits.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE CLERGYMAN'S HOUSE AT HOGGLESTOCK.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMrs. Crawley had walked from Hogglestock to Silverbridge on the\noccasion of her visit to Mr. Walker, the attorney, and had been\nkindly sent back by that gentleman in his wife's little open\ncarriage. The tidings she brought home with her to her husband were\nvery grievous. The magistrates would sit on the next Thursday,--it\nwas then Friday,--and Mr. Crawley had better appear before them to\nanswer the charge made by Mr. Soames. He would be served with a\nsummons, which he could obey of his own accord. There had been many\npoints very closely discussed between Walker and Mrs. Crawley, as to\nwhich there had been great difficulty in the choice of words which\nshould be tender enough in regard to the feelings of the poor lady,\nand yet strong enough to convey to her the very facts as they stood.\nWould Mr. Crawley come, or must a policeman be sent to fetch him? The\nmagistrates had already issued a warrant for his apprehension. Such\nin truth was the fact, but they had agreed with Mr. Walker, that as\nthere was no reasonable ground for anticipating any attempt at escape\non the part of the reverend gentleman, the lawyer might use what\ngentle means he could for ensuring the clergyman's attendance. Could\nMrs. Crawley undertake to say that he would appear? Mrs. Crawley\ndid undertake either that her husband should appear on the Thursday,\nor else that she would send over in the early part of the week and\ndeclare her inability to ensure his appearance. In that case it was\nunderstood the policeman must come. Then Mr. Walker had suggested\nthat Mr. Crawley had better employ a lawyer. Upon this Mrs. Crawley\nhad looked beseechingly up into Mr. Walker's face, and had asked\nhim to undertake the duty. He was of course obliged to explain that\nhe was already employed on the other side. Mr. Soames had secured\nhis services, and though he was willing to do all in his power to\nmitigate the sufferings of the family, he could not abandon the duty\nhe had undertaken. He named another attorney, however, and then sent\nthe poor woman home in his wife's carriage. \"I fear that unfortunate\nman is guilty. I fear he is,\" Mr. Walker had said to his wife within\nten minutes of the departure of the visitor.\n\nMrs. Crawley would not allow herself to be driven up to the garden\ngate before her own house, but had left the carriage some three\nhundred yards off down the road, and from thence she walked home.\nIt was now quite dark. It was nearly six in the evening on a wet\nDecember night, and although cloaks and shawls had been supplied to\nher, she was wet and cold when she reached her home. But at such a\nmoment, anxious as she was to prevent the additional evil which would\ncome to them all from illness to herself, she could not pass through\nto her room till she had spoken to her husband. He was sitting in\nthe one sitting-room on the left side of the passage as the house\nwas entered, and with him was their daughter Jane, a girl now nearly\nsixteen years of age. There was no light in the room, and hardly\nmore than a spark of fire showed itself in the grate. The father was\nsitting on one side of the hearth, in an old arm-chair, and there he\nhad sat for the last hour without speaking. His daughter had been in\nand out of the room, and had endeavoured to gain his attention now\nand again by a word, but he had never answered her, and had not even\nnoticed her presence. At the moment when Mrs. Crawley's step was\nheard upon the gravel which led to the door, Jane was kneeling before\nthe fire with a hand upon her father's arm. She had tried to get her\nhand into his, but he had either been unaware of the attempt, or had\nrejected it.\n\n\"Here is mamma, at last,\" said Jane, rising to her feet as her mother\nentered the house.\n\n\"Are you all in the dark?\" said Mrs. Crawley, striving to speak in a\nvoice that should not be sorrowful.\n\n\"Yes, mamma; we are in the dark. Papa is here. Oh, mamma, how wet you\nare!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear. It is raining. Get a light out of the kitchen, Jane, and\nI will go upstairs in two minutes.\" Then, when Jane was gone, the\nwife made her way in the dark over to her husband's side, and spoke a\nword to him. \"Josiah,\" she said, \"will you not speak to me?\"\n\n\"What should I speak about? Where have you been?\"\n\n\"I have been to Silverbridge. I have been to Mr. Walker. He, at any\nrate, is very kind.\"\n\n\"I don't want his kindness. I want no man's kindness. Mr. Walker is\nthe attorney, I believe. Kind, indeed!\"\n\n\"I mean considerate. Josiah, let us do the best we can in this\ntrouble. We have had others as heavy before.\"\n\n\"But none to crush me as this will crush me. Well; what am I to do?\nAm I to go to prison--to-night?\" At this moment his daughter returned\nwith a candle, and the mother could not make her answer at once. It\nwas a wretched, poverty-stricken room. By degrees the carpet had\ndisappeared, which had been laid down some nine or ten years since,\nwhen they had first come to Hogglestock, and which even then had not\nbeen new. Now nothing but a poor fragment of it remained in front of\nthe fire-place. In the middle of the room there was a table which\nhad once been large; but one flap of it was gone altogether, and the\nother flap sloped grievously towards the floor, the weakness of old\nage having fallen into its legs. There were two or three smaller\ntables about, but they stood propped against walls, thence obtaining\na security which their own strength would not give them. At the\nfurther end of the room there was an ancient piece of furniture,\nwhich was always called \"papa's secretary,\" at which Mr. Crawley\ncustomarily sat and wrote his sermons, and did all work that was done\nby him within his house. The man who had made it, some time in the\nlast century, had intended it to be a locked guardian for domestic\ndocuments, and the receptacle for all that was most private in the\nhouse of some paterfamilias. But beneath the hands of Mr. Crawley it\nalways stood open; and with the exception of the small space at which\nhe wrote, was covered with dog's-eared books, from nearly all of\nwhich the covers had disappeared. There were there two odd volumes of\nEuripides, a Greek Testament, an Odyssey, a duodecimo Pindar, and a\nminiature Anacreon. There was half a Horace,--the two first books of\nthe Odes at the beginning, and the De Arte Poetica at the end having\ndisappeared. There was a little bit of a volume of Cicero, and there\nwere C\u00c3\u00a6sar's Commentaries, in two volumes, so stoutly bound that they\nhad defied the combined ill-usage of time and the Crawley family. All\nthese were piled upon the secretary, with many others,--odd volumes\nof sermons and the like; but the Greek and Latin lay at the top, and\nshowed signs of most frequent use. There was one arm-chair in the\nroom,--a Windsor-chair, as such used to be called, made soft by an\nold cushion in the back, in which Mr. Crawley sat when both he and\nhis wife were in the room, and Mrs. Crawley when he was absent.\nAnd there was an old horsehair sofa,--now almost denuded of its\nhorsehair,--but that, like the tables, required the assistance of a\nfriendly wall. Then there was half a dozen of other chairs,--all of\ndifferent sorts,--and they completed the furniture of the room. It\nwas not such a room as one would wish to see inhabited by a beneficed\nclergyman of the Church of England; but they who know what money will\ndo and what it will not, will understand how easily a man with a\nfamily, and with a hundred and thirty pounds a year, may be brought\nto the need of inhabiting such a chamber. When it is remembered that\nthree pounds of meat a day, at ninepence a pound, will cost over\nforty pounds a year, there need be no difficulty in understanding\nthat it may be so. Bread for such a family must cost at least\ntwenty-five pounds. Clothes for five persons, of whom one must at any\nrate wear the raiment of a gentleman, can hardly be found for less\nthan ten pounds a year a head. Then there remains fifteen pounds for\ntea, sugar, beer, wages, education, amusements, and the like. In such\ncircumstances a gentleman can hardly pay much for the renewal of his\nfurniture!\n\nMrs. Crawley could not answer her husband's question before her\ndaughter, and was therefore obliged to make another excuse for again\nsending her out of the room. \"Jane, dear,\" she said, \"bring my things\ndown to the kitchen and I will change them by the fire. I will be\nthere in two minutes, when I have had a word with your papa.\" The\ngirl went immediately and then Mrs. Crawley answered her husband's\nquestion. \"No, my dear; there is no question of your going to\nprison.\"\n\n\"But there will be.\"\n\n\"I have undertaken that you shall attend before the magistrates at\nSilverbridge on Thursday next, at twelve o'clock. You will do that?\"\n\n\"Do it! You mean, I suppose, to say that I must go there. Is anybody\nto come and fetch me?\"\n\n\"Nobody will come. Only you must promise that you will be there. I\nhave promised for you. You will go; will you not?\" She stood leaning\nover him, half embracing him, waiting for an answer; but for a\nwhile he gave none. \"You will tell me that you will do what I have\nundertaken for you, Josiah?\"\n\n\"I think I would rather that they fetched me. I think that I will not\ngo myself.\"\n\n\"And have policemen come for you into the parish! Mr. Walker has\npromised that he will send over his phaeton. He sent me home in it\nto-day.\"\n\n\"I want nobody's phaeton. If I go I will walk. If it were ten times\nthe distance, and though I had not a shoe left to my feet I would\nwalk. If I go there at all, of my own accord, I will walk there.\"\n\n\"But you will go?\"\n\n\"What do I care for the parish? What matters it who sees me now? I\ncannot be degraded worse than I am. Everybody knows it.\"\n\n\"There is no disgrace without guilt,\" said his wife.\n\n\"Everybody thinks me guilty. I see it in their eyes. The children\nknow of it, and I hear their whispers in the school, 'Mr. Crawley has\ntaken some money.' I heard the girl say it myself.\"\n\n\"What matters what the girl says?\"\n\n\"And yet you would have me go in a fine carriage to Silverbridge, as\nthough to a wedding. If I am wanted there let them take me as they\nwould another. I shall be here for them,--unless I am dead.\"\n\nAt this moment Jane reappeared, pressing her mother to take off her\nwet clothes, and Mrs. Crawley went with her daughter to the kitchen.\nThe one red-armed young girl who was their only servant was sent\naway, and then the mother and child discussed how best they might\nprevail with the head of the family. \"But, mamma, it must come right;\nmust it not?\"\n\n\"I trust it will. I think it will. But I cannot see my way as yet.\"\n\n\"Papa cannot have done anything wrong.\"\n\n\"No, my dear; he has done nothing wrong. He has made great\nmistakes, and it is hard to make people understand that he has not\nintentionally spoken untruths. He is ever thinking of other things,\nabout the school, and his sermons, and he does not remember.\"\n\n\"And about how poor we are, mamma.\"\n\n\"He has much to occupy his mind, and he forgets things which dwell in\nthe memory with other people. He said that he had got this money from\nMr. Soames, and of course he thought that it was so.\"\n\n\"And where did he get it, mamma?\"\n\n\"Ah,--I wish I knew. I should have said that I had seen every\nshilling that came into the house; but I know nothing of this\ncheque,--whence it came.\"\n\n\"But will not papa tell you?\"\n\n\"He would tell me if he knew. He thinks it came from the dean.\"\n\n\"And are you sure it did not?\"\n\n\"Yes; quite sure; as sure as I can be of anything. The dean told me\nhe would give him fifty pounds, and the fifty pounds came. I had them\nin my own hands. And he has written to say that it was so.\"\n\n\"But couldn't this be part of the fifty pounds?\"\n\n\"No, dear, no.\"\n\n\"Then where did papa get it? Perhaps he picked it up, and has\nforgotten?\"\n\nTo this Mrs. Crawley made no reply. The idea that the cheque had been\nfound by her husband,--had been picked up as Jane had said,--had\noccurred also to Jane's mother. Mr. Soames was confident that he had\ndropped the pocket-book at the parsonage. Mrs. Crawley had always\ndisliked Mr. Soames, thinking him to be hard, cruel, and vulgar. She\nwould not have hesitated to believe him guilty of a falsehood, or\neven of direct dishonesty, if by so believing she could in her own\nmind have found the means of reconciling her husband's possession of\nthe cheque with absolute truth on his part. But she could not do so.\nEven though Soames had, with devilish premeditated malice, slipped\nthe cheque into her husband's pocket, his having done so would not\naccount for her husband's having used the cheque when he found it\nthere. She was driven to make excuses for him which, valid as they\nmight be with herself, could not be valid with others. He had said\nthat Mr. Soames had paid the cheque to him. That was clearly a\nmistake. He had said that the cheque had been given to him by the\ndean. That was clearly another mistake. She knew, or thought she\nknew, that he, being such as he was, might make such blunders as\nthese, and yet be true. She believed that such statements might be\nblunders and not falsehoods,--so convinced was she that her husband's\nmind would not act at all times as do the minds of other men. But\nhaving such a conviction she was driven to believe also that almost\nanything might be possible. Soames may have been right, or he might\nhave dropped, not the book, but the cheque. She had no difficulty\nin presuming Soames to be wrong in any detail, if by so supposing\nshe could make the exculpation of her husband easier to herself. If\nvillany on the part of Soames was needful to her theory, Soames would\nbecome to her a villain at once,--of the blackest dye. Might it not\nbe possible that the cheque having thus fallen into her husband's\nhands, he had come, after a while, to think that it had been sent to\nhim by his friend, the dean? And if it were so, would it be possible\nto make others so believe? That there was some mistake which would\nbe easily explained were her husband's mind lucid at all points, but\nwhich she could not explain because of the darkness of his mind, she\nwas thoroughly convinced. But were she herself to put forward such\na defence on her husband's part, she would in doing so be driven to\nsay that he was a lunatic,--that he was incapable of managing the\naffairs of himself or his family. It seemed to her that she would be\ncompelled to have him proved to be either a thief or a madman. And\nyet she knew that he was neither. That he was not a thief was as\nclear to her as the sun at noonday. Could she have lain on the man's\nbosom for twenty years, and not yet have learned the secrets of the\nheart beneath? The whole mind of the man was, as she told herself,\nwithin her grasp. He might have taken the twenty pounds; he might\nhave taken it and spent it, though it was not his own; but yet he\nwas no thief. Nor was he a madman. No man more sane in preaching\nthe gospel of his Lord, in making intelligible to the ignorant the\npromises of his Saviour, ever got into a parish pulpit, or taught in\na parish school. The intellect of the man was as clear as running\nwater in all things not appertaining to his daily life and its\ndifficulties. He could be logical with a vengeance,--so logical as to\ncause infinite trouble to his wife, who, with all her good sense, was\nnot logical. And he had Greek at his fingers' ends,--as his daughter\nknew very well. And even to this day he would sometimes recite to\nthem English poetry, lines after lines, stanzas upon stanzas, in a\nsweet low melancholy voice, on long winter evenings when occasionally\nthe burden of his troubles would be lighter to him than was usual.\nBooks in Latin and in French he read with as much ease as in English,\nand took delight in such as came to him, when he would condescend\nto accept such loans from the deanery. And there was at times a\nlightness of heart about the man. In the course of the last winter he\nhad translated into Greek irregular verse the very noble ballad of\nLord Bateman, maintaining the rhythm and the rhyme, and had repeated\nit with uncouth glee till his daughter knew it all by heart. And when\nthere had come to him a five-pound note from some admiring magazine\neditor as the price of the same,--still through the dean's hands,--he\nhad brightened up his heart and had thought for an hour or two that\neven yet the world would smile upon him. His wife knew well that he\nwas not mad; but yet she knew that there were dark moments with him,\nin which his mind was so much astray that he could not justly be\ncalled to account as to what he might remember and what he might\nforget. How would it be possible to explain all this to a judge and\njury, so that they might neither say that he was dishonest, nor yet\nthat he was mad? \"Perhaps he picked it up, and had forgotten,\" her\ndaughter said to her. Perhaps it was so, but she might not as yet\nadmit as much even to her child.\n\n\"It is a mystery, dear, as yet, which, with God's aid, will be\nunravelled. Of one thing we at least may be sure; that your papa has\nnot wilfully done anything wrong.\"\n\n\"Of course we are sure of that, mamma.\"\n\nMrs. Crawley had many troubles during the next four or five days, of\nwhich the worst, perhaps, had reference to the services of the Sunday\nwhich intervened between the day of her visit to Silverbridge, and\nthe sitting of the magistrates. On the Saturday it was necessary\nthat he should prepare his sermons, of which he preached two on\nevery Sunday, though his congregation consisted only of farmers,\nbrickmakers, and agricultural labourers, who would willingly have\ndispensed with the second. Mrs. Crawley proposed to send over to\nMr. Robarts, a neighbouring clergyman, for the loan of a curate. Mr.\nRobarts was a warm friend to the Crawleys, and in such an emergency\nwould probably have come himself; but Mr. Crawley would not hear of\nit. The discussion took place early on the Saturday morning, before\nit was as yet daylight, for the poor woman was thinking day and\nnight of her husband's troubles, and it had this good effect, that\nimmediately after breakfast he seated himself at his desk, and worked\nat his task as though he had forgotten all else in the world.\n\nAnd on the Sunday morning he went into his school before the hour of\nthe church service, as had been his wont, and taught there as though\neverything with him was as usual. Some of the children were absent,\nhaving heard of their teacher's tribulation, and having been told\nprobably that he would remit his work; and for these absent ones he\nsent in great anger. The poor bairns came creeping in, for he was a\nman who by his manners had been able to secure their obedience in\nspite of his poverty. And he preached to the people of his parish on\nthat Sunday, as he had always preached; eagerly, clearly, with an\neloquence fitted for the hearts of such an audience. No one would\nhave guessed from his tones and gestures and appearance on that\noccasion, that there was aught wrong with him,--unless there had been\nthere some observer keen enough to perceive that the greater care\nwhich he used, and the special eagerness of his words, denoted a\nspecial frame of mind.\n\nAfter that, after those church services were over, he sank again and\nnever roused himself till the dreaded day had come.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nWHAT THE WORLD THOUGHT ABOUT IT.\n\n\nOpinion in Silverbridge, at Barchester, and throughout the county,\nwas very much divided as to the guilt or innocence of Mr. Crawley. Up\nto the time of Mrs. Crawley's visit to Silverbridge, the affair had\nnot been much discussed. To give Mr. Soames his due, he had been by\nno means anxious to press the matter against the clergyman; but he\nhad been forced to go on with it. While the first cheque was missing,\nLord Lufton had sent him a second cheque for the money, and the loss\nhad thus fallen upon his lordship. The cheque had of course been\ntraced, and inquiry had of course been made as to Mr. Crawley's\npossession of it. When that gentleman declared that he had received\nit from Mr. Soames, Mr. Soames had been forced to contradict and to\nresent such an assertion. When Mr. Crawley had afterwards said that\nthe money had come to him from the dean, and when the dean had shown\nthat this also was untrue, Mr. Soames, confident as he was that he\nhad dropped the pocket-book at Mr. Crawley's house, could not but\ncontinue the investigation. He had done so with as much silence as\nthe nature of the work admitted. But by the day of the magistrates'\nmeeting at Silverbridge the subject had become common through the\ncounty, and men's minds were very much divided.\n\nAll Hogglestock believed their parson to be innocent; but then all\nHogglestock believed him to be mad. At Silverbridge the tradesmen\nwith whom he had dealt, and to whom he had owed, and still owed,\nmoney, all declared him to be innocent. They knew something of the\nman personally, and could not believe him to be a thief. All the\nladies in Silverbridge, too, were sure of his innocence. It was to\nthem impossible that such a man should have stolen twenty pounds.\n\"My dear,\" said the eldest Miss Prettyman to poor Grace Crawley, \"in\nEngland, where the laws are good, no gentleman is ever made out to\nbe guilty when he is innocent; and your papa, of course, is innocent.\nTherefore you should not trouble yourself.\" \"It will break papa's\nheart,\" Grace had said, and she did trouble herself. But the\ngentlemen in Silverbridge were made of sterner stuff, and believed\nthe man to be guilty, clergyman and gentleman though he was. Mr.\nWalker, who among the lights in Silverbridge was the leading light,\nwould not speak a word upon the subject to anybody; and then\neverybody, who was anybody, knew that Mr. Walker was convinced of the\nman's guilt. Had Mr. Walker believed him to be innocent, his tongue\nwould have been ready enough. John Walker, who was in the habit of\nlaughing at his father's good nature, had no doubt upon the subject.\nMr. Winthrop, Mr. Walker's partner, shook his head. People did not\nthink much of Mr. Winthrop, excepting certain unmarried ladies; for\nMr. Winthrop was a bachelor, and had plenty of money. People did not\nthink much of Mr. Winthrop; but still on this subject he might know\nsomething, and when he shook his head he manifestly intended to\nindicate guilt. And Dr. Tempest, the rector of Silverbridge, did\nnot hesitate to declare his belief in the guilt of the incumbent\nof Hogglestock. No man reverences a clergyman, as a clergyman, so\nslightly as a brother clergyman. To Dr. Tempest it appeared to be\nneither very strange nor very terrible that Mr. Crawley should have\nstolen twenty pounds. \"What is a man to do,\" he said, \"when he\nsees his children starving? He should not have married on such a\npreferment as that.\" Mr. Crawley had married, however, long before he\ngot the living of Hogglestock.\n\nThere were two Lady Luftons,--mother-in-law and daughter-in-law,--who\nat this time were living together at Framley Hall, Lord Lufton's seat\nin the county of Barset, and they were both thoroughly convinced\nof Mr. Crawley's innocence. The elder lady had lived much among\nclergymen, and could hardly, I think, by any means have been brought\nto believe in the guilt of any man who had taken upon himself the\norders of the Church of England. She had also known Mr. Crawley\npersonally for some years, and was one of those who could not admit\nto herself that any one was vile who had been near to herself. She\nbelieved intensely in the wickedness of the outside world, of the\nworld which was far away from herself, and of which she never saw\nanything; but they who were near to her, and who had even become dear\nto her, or who even had been respected by her, were made, as it were,\nsaints in her imagination. They were brought into the inner circle,\nand could hardly be expelled. She was an old woman who thought all\nevil of those she did not know, and all good of those whom she did\nknow; and as she did know Mr. Crawley, she was quite sure he had not\nstolen Mr. Soames's twenty pounds. She did know Mr. Soames also; and\nthus there was a mystery for the unravelling of which she was very\nanxious. And the young Lady Lufton was equally sure, and perhaps with\nbetter reason for such certainty. She had, in truth, known more of\nMr. Crawley personally, than had any one in the county, unless it was\nthe dean. The younger Lady Lufton, the present Lord Lufton's wife,\nhad sojourned at one time in Mr. Crawley's house, amidst the Crawley\npoverty, living as they lived, and nursing Mrs. Crawley through an\nillness which had well nigh been fatal to her; and the younger Lady\nLufton believed in Mr. Crawley,--as Mr. Crawley also believed in her.\n\n\"It is quite impossible, my dear,\" the old woman said to her\ndaughter-in-law.\n\n\"Quite impossible, my lady.\" The dowager was always called \"my\nlady,\" both by her own daughter and by her son's wife, except in the\npresence of their children, when she was addressed as \"grandmamma.\"\n\"Think how well I knew him. It's no use talking of evidence. No\nevidence would make me believe it.\"\n\n\"Nor me; and I think it a great shame that such a report should be\nspread about.\"\n\n\"I suppose Mr. Soames could not help himself?\" said the younger lady,\nwho was not herself very fond of Mr. Soames.\n\n\"Ludovic says that he has only done what he was obliged to do.\" The\nLudovic spoken of was Lord Lufton.\n\nThis took place in the morning, but in the evening the affair was\nagain discussed at Framley Hall. Indeed, for some days, there was\nhardly any other subject held to be worthy of discussion in the\ncounty. Mr. Robarts, the clergyman of the parish and the brother of\nthe younger Lady Lufton, was dining at the hall with his wife, and\nthe three ladies had together expressed their perfect conviction of\nthe falseness of the accusation. But when Lord Lufton and Mr. Robarts\nwere together after the ladies had left them there was much less of\nthis certainty expressed. \"By Jove,\" said Lord Lufton, \"I don't know\nwhat to think of it. I wish with all my heart that Soames had said\nnothing about it, and that the cheque had passed without remark.\"\n\n\"That was impossible. When the banker sent to Soames, he was obliged\nto take the matter up.\"\n\n\"Of course he was. But I'm sorry that it was so. For the life of me I\ncan't conceive how the cheque got into Crawley's hands.\"\n\n\"I imagine that it had been lying in the house, and that Crawley had\ncome to think that it was his own.\"\n\n\"But, my dear Mark,\" said Lord Lufton, \"excuse me if I say that\nthat's nonsense. What do we do when a poor man has come to think that\nanother man's property is his own? We send him to prison for making\nthe mistake.\"\n\n\"I hope they won't send Crawley to prison.\"\n\n\"I hope so too; but what is a jury to do?\"\n\n\"You think it will go to a jury, then?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Lord Lufton. \"I don't see how the magistrates can save\nthemselves from committing him. It is one of those cases in which\nevery one concerned would wish to drop it if it were only possible.\nBut it is not possible. On the evidence, as one sees it at present,\none is bound to say that it is a case for a jury.\"\n\n\"I believe that he is mad,\" said the brother parson.\n\n\"He always was, as far as I could learn,\" said the lord. \"I never\nknew him, myself. You do, I think?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I know him.\" And the vicar of Framley became silent and\nthoughtful as the memory of a certain interview between himself and\nMr. Crawley came back upon his mind. At that time the waters had\nnearly closed over his head and Mr. Crawley had given him some\nassistance. When the gentlemen had again found the ladies, they kept\ntheir own doubts to themselves; for at Framley Hall, as at present\ntenanted, female voices and female influences predominated over those\nwhich came from the other sex.\n\nAt Barchester, the cathedral city of the county in which the Crawleys\nlived, opinion was violently against Mr. Crawley. In the city Mrs.\nProudie, the wife of the bishop, was the leader of opinion in\ngeneral, and she was very strong in her belief of the man's guilt.\nShe had known much of clergymen all her life, as it behoved a\nbishop's wife to do, and she had none of that mingled weakness and\nignorance which taught so many ladies in Barsetshire to suppose that\nan ordained clergyman could not become a thief. She hated old Lady\nLufton with all her heart, and old Lady Lufton hated her as warmly.\nMrs. Proudie would say frequently that Lady Lufton was a conceited\nold idiot, and Lady Lufton would declare as frequently that\nMrs. Proudie was a vulgar virago. It was known at the palace in\nBarchester, that kindness had been shown to the Crawleys by the\nfamily at Framley Hall, and this alone would have been sufficient to\nmake Mrs. Proudie believe that Mr. Crawley could have been guilty of\nany crime. And as Mrs. Proudie believed, so did the bishop believe.\n\"It is a terrible disgrace to the diocese,\" said the bishop, shaking\nhis head, and patting his apron as he sat by his study fire.\n\n\"Fiddlestick!\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"But, my dear,--a beneficed clergyman!\"\n\n\"You must get rid of him; that's all. You must be firm whether he be\nacquitted or convicted.\"\n\n\"But if he be acquitted, I cannot get rid of him, my dear.\"\n\n\"Yes, you can, if you are firm. And you must be firm. Is it not true\nthat he has been disgracefully involved in debt ever since he has\nbeen there; that you have been pestered by letters from unfortunate\ntradesmen who cannot get their money from him?\"\n\n\"That is true, my dear, certainly.\"\n\n\"And is that kind of thing to go on? He cannot come to the palace as\nall clergymen should do, because he has got no clothes to come in. I\nsaw him once about the lanes, and I never set my eyes on such an\nobject in my life! I would not believe that the man was a clergyman\ntill John told me. He is a disgrace to the diocese, and he must\nbe got rid of. I feel sure of his guilt, and I hope he will be\nconvicted. One is bound to hope that a guilty man should be\nconvicted. But if he escape conviction, you must sequestrate the\nliving because of the debts. The income is enough to get an excellent\ncurate. It would just do for Thumble.\" To all of which the bishop\nmade no further reply, but simply nodded his head and patted his\napron. He knew that he could not do exactly what his wife required of\nhim; but if it should so turn out that poor Crawley was found to be\nguilty, then the matter would be comparatively easy.\n\n\"It should be an example to us, that we should look to our own steps,\nmy dear,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"That's all very well,\" said Mrs. Proudie, \"but it has become your\nduty, and mine too, to look to the steps of other people; and that\nduty we must do.\"\n\n\"Of course, my dear; of course.\" That was the tone in which the\nquestion of Mr. Crawley's alleged guilt was discussed at the palace.\n\nWe have already heard what was said on the subject at the house of\nArchdeacon Grantly. As the days passed by, and as other tidings\ncame in, confirmatory of those which had before reached him, the\narchdeacon felt himself unable not to believe in the man's guilt.\nAnd the fear which he entertained as to his son's intended marriage\nwith Grace Crawley, tended to increase the strength of his belief.\nDr. Grantly had been a very successful man in the world, and on all\nordinary occasions had been able to show that bold front with which\nsuccess endows a man. But he still had his moments of weakness, and\nfeared greatly lest anything of misfortune should touch him, and mar\nthe comely roundness of his prosperity. He was very wealthy. The\nwife of his bosom had been to him all that a wife should be. His\nreputation in the clerical world stood very high. He had lived all\nhis life on terms of equality with the best of the gentry around\nhim. His only daughter had made a splendid marriage. His two sons\nhad hitherto done well in the world, not only as regarded their\nhappiness, but as to marriage also, and as to social standing. But\nhow great would be the fall if his son should at last marry the\ndaughter of a convicted thief! How would the Proudies rejoice over\nhim,--the Proudies who had been crushed to the ground by the success\nof the Hartletop alliance; and how would the low-church curates who\nswarmed in Barsetshire, gather together and scream in delight over\nhis dismay! \"But why should we say that he is guilty?\" said Mrs.\nGrantly.\n\n\"It hardly matters as far as we are concerned, whether they find him\nguilty or not,\" said the archdeacon; \"if Henry marries that girl my\nheart will be broken.\"\n\nBut perhaps to no one except to the Crawleys themselves had the\nmatter caused so much terrible anxiety as to the archdeacon's son. He\nhad told his father that he had made no offer of marriage to Grace\nCrawley, and he had told the truth. But there are perhaps few men who\nmake such offers in direct terms without having already said and done\nthat which make such offers simply necessary as the final closing of\nan accepted bargain. It was so at any rate between Major Grantly and\nMiss Crawley, and Major Grantly acknowledged to himself that it was\nso. He acknowledged also to himself that as regarded Grace herself\nhe had no wish to go back from his implied intentions. Nothing that\neither his father or mother might say would shake him in that. But\ncould it be his duty to bind himself to the family of a convicted\nthief? Could it be right that he should disgrace his father and his\nmother and his sister and his one child by such a connection? He\nhad a man's heart, and the poverty of the Crawleys caused him no\nsolicitude. But he shrank from the contamination of a prison.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nGRACE CRAWLEY.\n\n\nIt has already been said that Grace Crawley was at this time\nliving with the two Miss Prettymans, who kept a girls' school at\nSilverbridge. Two more benignant ladies than the Miss Prettymans\nnever presided over such an establishment. The younger was fat,\nand fresh, and fair, and seemed to be always running over with the\nmilk of human kindness. The other was very thin and very small, and\nsomewhat afflicted with bad health;--was weak, too, in the eyes, and\nsubject to racking headaches, so that it was considered generally\nthat she was unable to take much active part in the education of\nthe pupils. But it was considered as generally that she did all the\nthinking, that she knew more than any other woman in Barsetshire, and\nthat all the Prettyman schemes for education emanated from her mind.\nIt was said, too, by those who knew them best, that her sister's\ngood-nature was as nothing to hers; that she was the most charitable,\nthe most loving, and the most conscientious of schoolmistresses.\nThis was Miss Annabella Prettyman, the elder; and perhaps it may be\ninferred that some portion of her great character for virtue may have\nbeen due to the fact that nobody ever saw her out of her own house.\nShe could not even go to church, because the open air brought on\nneuralgia. She was therefore perhaps taken to be magnificent, partly\nbecause she was unknown. Miss Anne Prettyman, the younger, went about\nfrequently to tea-parties,--would go, indeed, to any party to which\nshe might be invited; and was known to have a pleasant taste for\npound-cake and sweet-meats. Being seen so much in the outer world,\nshe became common, and her character did not stand so high as did\nthat of her sister. Some people were ill-natured enough to say that\nshe wanted to marry Mr. Winthrop; but of what maiden lady that goes\nout into the world are not such stories told? And all such stories in\nSilverbridge were told with special reference to Mr. Winthrop.\n\nMiss Crawley, at present, lived with the Miss Prettymans, and\nassisted them in the school. This arrangement had been going on for\nthe last twelve months, since the time in which Grace would have left\nthe school in the natural course of things. There had been no bargain\nmade, and no intention that Grace should stay. She had been invited\nto fill the place of an absent superintendent, first for one month,\nthen for another, and then for two more months; and when the\nassistant came back, the Miss Prettymans thought there were reasons\nwhy Grace should be asked to remain a little longer. But they took\ngreat care to let the fashionable world of Silverbridge know that\nGrace Crawley was a visitor with them, and not a teacher. \"We pay\nher no salary, or anything of that kind,\" said Miss Anne Prettyman;\na statement, however, which was by no means true, for during those\nfour months the regular stipend had been paid to her; and twice since\nthen, Miss Annabella Prettyman, who managed all the money matters,\nhad called Grace into her little room, and had made a little speech,\nand had put a little bit of paper into her hand. \"I know I ought\nnot to take it,\" Grace had said to her friend Anne. \"If I was not\nhere, there would be no one in my place.\" \"Nonsense, my dear,\" Anne\nPrettyman had said; \"it is the greatest comfort to us in the world.\nAnd you should make yourself nice, you know, for his sake. All the\ngentlemen like it.\" Then Grace had been very angry, and had sworn\nthat she would give the money back again. Nevertheless, I think she\ndid make herself as nice as she knew how to do. And from all this it\nmay be seen that the Miss Prettymans had hitherto quite approved of\nMajor Grantly's attentions.\n\nBut when this terrible affair came on about the cheque which had been\nlost and found and traced to Mr. Crawley's hands, Miss Anne Prettyman\nsaid nothing further to Grace Crawley about Major Grantly. It was not\nthat she thought that Mr. Crawley was guilty, but she knew enough of\nthe world to be aware that suspicion of such guilt might compel such\na man as Major Grantly to change his mind. \"If he had only popped,\"\nAnne said to her sister, \"it would have been all right. He would\nnever have gone back from his word.\" \"My dear,\" said Annabella, \"I\nwish you would not talk about popping. It is a terrible word.\" \"I\nshouldn't, to any one except you,\" said Anne.\n\nThere had come to Silverbridge some few months since, on a visit to\nMrs. Walker, a young lady from Allington, in the neighbouring county,\nbetween whom and Grace Crawley there had grown up from circumstances\na warm friendship. Grace had a cousin in London,--a clerk high up and\nwell-to-do in a public office, a nephew of her mother's,--and this\ncousin was, and for years had been, violently smitten in love for\nthis young lady. But the young lady's tale had been sad, and though\nshe acknowledged feelings of most affectionate friendship for the\ncousin, she could not bring herself to acknowledge more. Grace\nCrawley had met the young lady at Silverbridge, and words had been\nspoken about the cousin; and though the young lady from Allington was\nsome years older than Grace, there had grown up to be a friendship,\nand, as is not uncommon between young ladies, there had been an\nagreement that they would correspond. The name of the lady was Miss\nLily Dale, and the name of the well-to-do cousin in London was Mr.\nJohn Eames.\n\nAt the present moment Miss Dale was at home with her mother at\nAllington, and Grace Crawley in her terrible sorrow wrote to her\nfriend, pouring out her whole heart. As Grace's letter and Miss\nDale's answer will assist us in our story, I will venture to give\nthem both.\n\n\n   Silverbridge, -- December, 186--.\n\n   DEAREST LILY,\n\n   I hardly know how to tell you what has happened, it is so\n   very terrible. But perhaps you will have heard it already,\n   as everybody is talking of it here. It has got into the\n   newspapers, and therefore it cannot be kept secret. Not\n   that I should keep anything from you; only this is so very\n   dreadful that I hardly know how to write it. Somebody\n   says,--a Mr. Soames, I believe it is,--that papa has taken\n   some money that does not belong to him, and he is to be\n   brought before the magistrates and tried. Of course, papa\n   has done nothing wrong. I do think he would be the last\n   man in the world to take a penny that did not belong to\n   him. You know how poor he is; what a life he has had! But\n   I think he would almost sooner see mamma starving;--I am\n   sure he would rather be starved himself, than even borrow\n   a shilling which he could not pay. To suppose that he\n   would take money [she had tried to write the word \"steal,\"\n   but she could not bring her pen to form the letters] is\n   monstrous. But, somehow, the circumstances have been made\n   to look bad against him, and they say that he must come\n   over here to the magistrates. I often think that of all\n   men in the world papa is the most unfortunate. Everything\n   seems to go against him, and yet he is so good! Poor mamma\n   has been over here, and she is distracted. I never saw\n   her so wretched before. She had been to your friend, Mr.\n   Walker, and came to me afterwards for a minute. Mr. Walker\n   has got something to do with it, though mamma says she\n   thinks he is quite friendly to papa. I wonder whether\n   you could find out, through Mr. Walker, what he thinks\n   about it. Of course, mamma knows that papa has done\n   nothing wrong; but she says that the whole thing is most\n   mysterious, and that she does not know how to account for\n   the money. Papa, you know, is not like other people. He\n   forgets things; and is always thinking, thinking, thinking\n   of his great misfortunes. Poor papa! My heart bleeds so\n   when I remember all his sorrows, that I hate myself for\n   thinking about myself.\n\n   When mamma left me,--and it was then I first knew that\n   papa would really have to be tried,--I went to Miss\n   Annabella, and told her that I would go home. She asked me\n   why, and I said I would not disgrace her house by staying\n   in it. She got up and took me in her arms, and there came\n   a tear out of both her dear old eyes, and she said that if\n   anything evil came to papa,--which she would not believe,\n   as she knew him to be a good man,--there should be a\n   home in her house not only for me, but for mamma and\n   Jane. Isn't she a wonderful woman? When I think of her,\n   I sometimes think that she must be an angel already.\n   Then she became very serious,--for just before, through\n   her tears, she had tried to smile,--and she told me to\n   remember that all people could not be like her, who had\n   nobody to look to but herself and her sister; and that at\n   present I must task myself not to think of that which I\n   had been thinking of before. She did not mention anybody's\n   name, but of course I understood very well what she meant;\n   and I suppose she is right. I said nothing in answer to\n   her, for I could not speak. She was holding my hand, and I\n   took hers up and kissed it, to show her, if I could, that\n   I knew that she was right; but I could not have spoken\n   about it for all the world. It was not ten days since\n   that she herself, with all her prudence, told me that she\n   thought I ought to make up my mind what answer I would\n   give him. And then I did not say anything; but of course\n   she knew. And after that Miss Anne spoke quite freely\n   about it, so that I had to beg her to be silent even\n   before the girls. You know how imprudent she is. But it\n   is all over now. Of course Miss Annabella is right. He\n   has got a great many people to think of; his father and\n   mother, and his darling little Edith, whom he brought here\n   twice, and left her with us once for two days, so that\n   she got to know me quite well; and I took such a love for\n   her, that I could not bear to part with her. But I think\n   sometimes that all our family are born to be unfortunate,\n   and then I tell myself that I will never hope for anything\n   again.\n\n   Pray write to me soon. I feel as though nothing on earth\n   could comfort me, and yet I shall like to have your\n   letter. Dear, dear Lily, I am not even yet so wretched but\n   what I shall rejoice to be told good news of you. If it\n   only could be as John wishes it! And why should it not?\n   It seems to me that nobody has a right or a reason to be\n   unhappy except us. Good-by, dearest Lily,\n\n   Your affectionate friend,\n\n   GRACE CRAWLEY.\n\n   P.S.--I think I have made up my mind that I will go back\n   to Hogglestock at once if the magistrates decide against\n   papa. I think I should be doing the school harm if I were\n   to stay here.\n\n\nThe answer to this letter did not reach Miss Crawley till after the\nmagistrates' meeting on the Thursday, but it will be better for our\nstory that it should be given here than postponed until the result\nof that meeting shall have been told. Miss Dale's answer was as\nfollows:--\n\n\n   Allington, -- December, 186--.\n\n   DEAR GRACE,\n\n   Your letter has made me very unhappy. If it can at all\n   comfort you to know that mamma and I sympathize with you\n   altogether, in that you may at any rate be sure. But in\n   such troubles nothing will give comfort. They must be\n   borne, till the fire of misfortune burns itself out.\n\n   I had heard about the affair a day or two before I got\n   your note. Our clergyman, Mr. Boyce, told us of it. Of\n   course we all know that the charge must be altogether\n   unfounded, and mamma says that the truth will be sure to\n   show itself at last. But that conviction does not cure the\n   evil, and I can well understand that your father should\n   suffer grievously; and I pity your mother quite as much as\n   I do him.\n\n   As for Major Grantly, if he be such a man as I took him to\n   be from the little I saw of him, all this would make no\n   difference to him. I am sure that it ought to make none.\n   Whether it should not make a difference in you is another\n   question. I think it should; and I think your answer to\n   him should be that you could not even consider any such\n   proposition while your father was in so great trouble. I\n   am so much older than you, and seem to have had so much\n   experience, that I do not scruple, as you will see, to\n   come down upon you with all the weight of my wisdom.\n\n   About that other subject I had rather say nothing. I have\n   known your cousin all my life, almost; and I regard no one\n   more kindly than I do him. When I think of my friends, he\n   is always one of the dearest. But when one thinks of going\n   beyond friendship, even if one tries to do so, there are\n   so many barriers!\n\n   Your affectionate friend,\n\n   LILY DALE.\n\n   Mamma bids me say that she would be delighted to have you\n   here whenever it might suit you to come; and I add to this\n   message my entreaty that you will come at once. You say\n   that you think you ought to leave Miss Prettyman's for a\n   while. I can well understand your feeling; but as your\n   sister is with your mother, surely you had better come\n   to us,--I mean quite at once. I will not scruple to tell\n   you what mamma says, because I know your good sense. She\n   says that as the interest of the school may possibly be\n   concerned, and as you have no regular engagement, she\n   thinks you ought to leave Silverbridge; but she says that\n   it will be better that you come to us than that you should\n   go home. If you went home, people might say that you had\n   left in some sort of disgrace. Come to us, and when all\n   this has been put right, then you go back to Silverbridge;\n   and then, if a certain person speaks again, you can make a\n   different answer. Mamma quite understands that you are to\n   come; so you have only got to ask your own mamma, and come\n   at once.\n\n\nThis letter, as the reader will understand, did not reach Grace\nCrawley till after the all-important Thursday; but before that day\nhad come round, Grace had told Miss Prettyman,--had told both the\nMiss Prettymans--that she was resolved to leave them. She had done\nthis without even consulting her mother, driven to it by various\nmotives. She knew that her father's conduct was being discussed by\nthe girls in the school, and that things were said of him which it\ncould not but be for the disadvantage of Miss Prettyman that any one\nshould say of a teacher in her establishment. She felt, too, that\nshe could not hold up her head in Silverbridge in these days, as it\nwould become her to do if she retained her position. She did struggle\ngallantly, and succeeded much more nearly than she was herself\naware. She was all but able to carry herself as though no terrible\naccusation was being made against her father. Of the struggle,\nhowever, she was not herself the less conscious, and she told herself\nthat on that account also she must go. And then she must go also\nbecause of Major Grantly. Whether he was minded to come and speak\nto her that one other needed word, or whether he was not so minded,\nit would be better that she should be away from Silverbridge. If he\nspoke it she could only answer him by a negative; and if he were\nminded not to speak it, would it not be better that she should leave\nherself the power of thinking that his silence had been caused by her\nabsence, and not by his coldness or indifference?\n\nShe asked, therefore, for an interview with Miss Prettyman, and was\nshown into the elder sister's room, at eleven o'clock on the Tuesday\nmorning. The elder Miss Prettyman never came into the school herself\ntill twelve, but was in the habit of having interviews with the young\nladies,--which were sometimes very awful in their nature,--for the\ntwo previous hours. During these interviews an immense amount of\nbusiness was done, and the fortunes in life of some girls were said\nto have been there made or marred; as when, for instance, Miss\nCrimpton had been advised to stay at home with her uncle in England,\ninstead of going out with her sisters to India, both of which sisters\nwere married within three months of their landing at Bombay. The way\nin which she gave her counsel on such occasions was very efficacious.\nNo one knew better than Miss Prettyman that a cock can crow most\neffectively in his own farmyard, and therefore all crowing intended\nto be effective was done by her within the shrine of her own peculiar\nroom.\n\n\"Well, my dear, what is it?\" she said to Grace. \"Sit in the\narm-chair, my dear, and we can then talk comfortably.\" The teachers,\nwhen they were closeted with Miss Prettyman, were always asked to sit\nin the arm-chair, whereas a small, straight-backed, uneasy chair was\nkept for the use of the young ladies. And there was, too, a stool of\nrepentance, out against the wall, very uncomfortable indeed for young\nladies who had not behaved themselves so prettily as young ladies\ngenerally do.\n\nGrace seated herself, and then began her speech very quickly. \"Miss\nPrettyman,\" she said, \"I have made up my mind that I will go home, if\nyou please.\"\n\n\"And why should you go home, Grace? Did I not tell you that you\nshould have a home here?\" Miss Prettyman had weak eyes, and was very\nsmall, and had never possessed any claim to be called good-looking.\nAnd she assumed nothing of majestical awe from any adornment or\nstudied amplification of the outward woman by means of impressive\ntrappings. The possessor of an unobservant eye might have called her\na mean-looking, little old woman. And certainly there would have\nbeen nothing awful in her to any one who came across her otherwise\nthan as a lady having authority in her own school. But within her\nown precincts, she did know how to surround herself with a dignity\nwhich all felt who approached her there. Grace Crawley, as she heard\nthe simple question which Miss Prettyman had asked, unconsciously\nacknowledged the strength of the woman's manner. She already stood\nrebuked for having proposed a plan so ungracious, so unnecessary, and\nso unwise.\n\n\"I think I ought to be with mamma at present,\" said Grace.\n\n\"Your mother has your sister with her.\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Prettyman; Jane is there.\"\n\n\"If there be no other reason, I cannot think that that can be held to\nbe a reason now. Of course your mother would like to have you always;\nunless you should be married,--but then there are reasons why this\nshould not be so.\"\n\n\"Of course there are.\"\n\n\"I do not think,--that is, if I know all that there is to be\nknown,--I do not think, I say, that there can be any good ground for\nyour leaving us now,--just now.\"\n\nThen Grace sat silent for a moment, gathering her courage, and\ncollecting her words; and after that she spoke. \"It is because of\npapa, and because of this charge--\"\n\n\"But, Grace--\"\n\n\"I know what you are going to say, Miss Prettyman;--that is, I think\nI know.\"\n\n\"If you will hear me, you may be sure that you know.\"\n\n\"But I want you to hear me for one moment first. I beg your pardon,\nMiss Prettyman; I do indeed, but I want to say this before you go on.\nI must go home, and I know I ought. We are all disgraced, and I won't\nstop here to disgrace the school. I know papa has done nothing wrong;\nbut nevertheless we are disgraced. The police are to bring him in\nhere on Thursday, and everybody in Silverbridge will know it. It\ncannot be right that I should be here teaching in the school, while\nit is all going on;--and I won't. And, Miss Prettyman, I couldn't do\nit,--indeed I couldn't. I can't bring myself to think of anything\nI am doing. Indeed I can't; and then, Miss Prettyman, there are\nother reasons.\" By the time that she had proceeded thus far, Grace\nCrawley's words were nearly choked by her tears.\n\n\"And what are the other reasons, Grace?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Grace, struggling to speak through her tears.\n\n\"But I know,\" said Miss Prettyman. \"I know them all. I know all your\nreasons, and I tell you that in my opinion you ought to remain where\nyou are, and not go away. The very reasons which to you are reasons\nfor your going, to me are reasons for your remaining here.\"\n\n\"I can't remain. I am determined to go. I don't mind you and Miss\nAnne, but I can't bear to have the girls looking at me,--and the\nservants.\"\n\nThen Miss Prettyman paused awhile, thinking what words of wisdom\nwould be most appropriate in the present conjuncture. But words of\nwisdom did not seem to come easily to her, having for the moment been\nbanished by tenderness of heart. \"Come here, my love,\" she said at\nlast. \"Come here, Grace.\" Slowly Grace got up from her seat and came\nround, and stood by Miss Prettyman's elbow. Miss Prettyman pushed\nher chair a little back, and pushed herself a little forward, and\nstretching out one hand, placed her arm round Grace's waist, and\nwith the other took hold of Grace's hand, and thus drew her down and\nkissed the girl's forehead and lips. And then Grace found herself\nkneeling at her friend's feet. \"Grace,\" she said, \"do you not know\nthat I love you? Do you not know that I love you dearly?\" In answer\nto this, Grace kissed the withered hand she held in hers, while the\nwarm tears trickled down upon Miss Prettyman's knuckles. \"I love you\nas though you were my own,\" exclaimed the schoolmistress; \"and will\nyou not trust me, that I know what is best for you?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"I love you as though you were my own,\" said the\nSchoolmistress.]\n\n\"I must go home,\" said Grace.\n\n\"Of course you shall, if you think it right at last; but let us\ntalk of it. No one in this house, you know, has the slightest\nsuspicion that your father has done anything that is in the least\ndishonourable.\"\n\n\"I know that you have not.\"\n\n\"No, nor has Anne.\" Miss Prettyman said this as though no one in that\nhouse beyond herself and her sister had a right to have any opinion\non any subject.\n\n\"I know that,\" said Grace.\n\n\"Well, my dear. If we think so--\"\n\n\"But the servants, Miss Prettyman?\"\n\n\"If any servant in this house says a word to offend you,\nI'll--I'll--\"\n\n\"They don't say anything, Miss Prettyman, but they look. Indeed I'd\nbetter go home. Indeed I had!\"\n\n\"Do not you think your mother has cares enough upon her, and burden\nenough, without having another mouth to feed, and another head to\nshelter? You haven't thought of that, Grace!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have.\"\n\n\"And as for the work, whilst you are not quite well you shall not be\ntroubled with teaching. I have some old papers that want copying and\nsettling, and you shall sit here and do that just for an employment.\nAnne knows that I've long wanted to have it done, and I'll tell her\nthat you've kindly promised to do it for me.\"\n\n\"No; no; no,\" said Grace; \"I must go home.\" She was still kneeling at\nMiss Prettyman's knee, and still holding Miss Prettyman's hand. And\nthen, at that moment, there came a tap at the door, gentle but yet\nnot humble, a tap which acknowledged, on the part of the tapper, the\nsupremacy in that room of the lady who was sitting there, but which\nstill claimed admittance almost as a right. The tap was well known by\nboth of them to be the tap of Miss Anne. Grace immediately jumped up,\nand Miss Prettyman settled herself in her chair with a motion which\nalmost seemed to indicate some feeling of shame as to her late\nposition.\n\n\"I suppose I may come in?\" said Miss Anne, opening the door and\ninserting her head.\n\n\"Yes, you may come in,--if you have anything to say,\" said Miss\nPrettyman, with an air which seemed to be intended to assert her\nsupremacy. But, in truth, she was simply collecting the wisdom and\ndignity which had been somewhat dissipated by her tenderness.\n\n\"I did not know that Grace Crawley was here,\" said Miss Anne.\n\n\"Grace Crawley is here,\" said Miss Prettyman.\n\n\"What is the matter, Grace?\" said Miss Anne, seeing the tears.\n\n\"Never mind now,\" said Miss Prettyman.\n\n\"Poor dear, I'm sure I'm sorry as though she were my own sister,\"\nsaid Anne. \"But, Annabella, I want to speak to you especially.\"\n\n\"To me, in private?\"\n\n\"Yes, to you; in private, if Grace won't mind?\"\n\nThen Grace prepared to go. But as she was going, Miss Anne, upon\nwhose brow a heavy burden of thought was lying, stopped her suddenly.\n\"Grace, my dear,\" she said, \"go upstairs into your room, will\nyou?--not across the hall to the school.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't she go to the school?\" said Miss Prettyman.\n\nMiss Anne paused a moment, and then answered,--unwillingly, as though\ndriven to make a reply which she knew to be indiscreet. \"Because\nthere is somebody in the hall.\"\n\n\"Go to your room, dear,\" said Miss Prettyman. And Grace went to her\nroom, never turning an eye down towards the hall. \"Who is it?\" said\nMiss Prettyman.\n\n\"Major Grantly is here, asking to see you,\" said Miss Anne.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nMISS PRETTYMAN'S PRIVATE ROOM.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMajor Grantly, when threatened by his father with pecuniary\npunishment, should he demean himself by such a marriage as that he\nhad proposed to himself, had declared that he would offer his hand\nto Miss Crawley on the next morning. This, however, he had not done.\nHe had not done it, partly because he did not quite believe his\nfather's threat, and partly because he felt that that threat was\nalmost justified,--for the present moment,--by the circumstances\nin which Grace Crawley's father had placed himself. Henry Grantly\nacknowledged, as he drove himself home on the morning after his\ndinner at the rectory, that in this matter of his marriage he did owe\nmuch to his family. Should he marry at all, he owed it to them to\nmarry a lady. And Grace Crawley,--so he told himself,--was a lady.\nAnd he owed it to them to bring among them as his wife a woman who\nshould not disgrace him or them by her education, manners, or even by\nher personal appearance. In all these respects Grace Crawley was, in\nhis judgment, quite as good as they had a right to expect her to be,\nand in some respects a great deal superior to that type of womanhood\nwith which they had been most generally conversant. \"If everybody had\nher due, my sister isn't fit to hold a candle to her,\" he said to\nhimself. It must be acknowledged, therefore, that he was really in\nlove with Grace Crawley; and he declared to himself, over and over\nagain, that his family had no right to demand that he should marry\na woman with money. The archdeacon's son by no means despised money.\nHow could he, having come forth as a bird fledged from such a nest\nas the rectory at Plumstead Episcopi? Before he had been brought by\nhis better nature and true judgment to see that Grace Crawley was\nthe greater woman of the two, he had nearly submitted himself to the\ntwenty thousand pounds of Miss Emily Dunstable,--to that, and her\ngood-humour and rosy freshness combined. But he regarded himself as\nthe well-to-do son of a very rich father. His only child was amply\nprovided for; and he felt that, as regarded money, he had a right\nto do as he pleased. He felt this with double strength after his\nfather's threat.\n\nBut he had no right to make a marriage by which his family would be\ndisgraced. Whether he was right or wrong in supposing that he would\ndisgrace his family were he to marry the daughter of a convicted\nthief, it is hardly necessary to discuss here. He told himself that\nit would be so,--telling himself also that, by the stern laws of\nthe world, the son and the daughter must pay for the offence of the\nfather and the mother. Even among the poor, who would willingly marry\nthe child of a man who had been hanged? But he carried the argument\nbeyond this, thinking much of the matter, and endeavouring to think\nof it not only justly, but generously. If the accusation against\nCrawley were false,--if the man were being injured by an unjust\ncharge,--even if he, Grantly, could make himself think that the\ngirl's father had not stolen the money, then he would dare everything\nand go on. I do not know that his argument was good, or that his\nmind was logical in the matter. He ought to have felt that his own\njudgment as to the man's guilt was less likely to be correct than\nthat of those whose duty it was and would be to form and to express\na judgment on the matter; and as to Grace herself, she was equally\ninnocent whether her father were guilty or not guilty. If he were\nto be debarred from asking her for her hand by his feelings for her\nfather and mother, he should hardly have trusted to his own skill in\nascertaining the real truth as to the alleged theft. But he was not\nlogical, and thus, meaning to be generous, he became unjust.\n\nHe found that among those in Silverbridge whom he presumed to be\nbest informed on such matters, there was a growing opinion that Mr.\nCrawley had stolen the money. He was intimate with all the Walkers,\nand was able to find out that Mrs. Walker knew that her husband\nbelieved in the clergyman's guilt. He was by no means alone in his\nwillingness to accept Mr. Walker's opinion as the true opinion.\nSilverbridge, generally, was endeavouring to dress itself in Mr.\nWalker's glass, and to believe as Mr. Walker believed. The ladies\nof Silverbridge, including the Miss Prettymans, were aware that Mr.\nWalker had been very kind both to Mr. and Mrs. Crawley, and argued\nfrom this that Mr. Walker must think the man to be innocent. But\nHenry Grantly, who did not dare to ask a direct question of the\nsolicitor, went cunningly to work, and closeted himself with Mrs.\nWalker,--with Mrs. Walker, who knew well of the good fortune which\nwas hovering over Grace's head and was so nearly settling itself upon\nher shoulders. She would have given a finger to be able to whitewash\nMr. Crawley in the major's estimation. Nor must it be supposed that\nshe told the major in plain words that her husband had convinced\nhimself of the man's guilt. In plain words no question was asked\nbetween them, and in plain words no opinion was expressed. But there\nwas the look of sorrow in the woman's eye, there was the absence of\nreference to her husband's assurance that the man was innocent, there\nwas the air of settled grief which told of her own conviction; and\nthe major left her, convinced that Mrs. Walker believed Mr. Crawley\nto be guilty.\n\nThen he went to Barchester; not open-mouthed with inquiry, but rather\nwith open ears, and it seemed to him that all men in Barchester were\nof one mind. There was a county-club in Barchester, and at this\ncounty-club nine men out of every ten were talking about Mr. Crawley.\nIt was by no means necessary that a man should ask questions on\nthe subject. Opinion was expressed so freely that no such asking\nwas required; and opinion in Barchester,--at any rate in the\ncounty-club,--seemed now to be all of one mind. There had been every\ndisposition at first to believe Mr. Crawley to be innocent. He had\nbeen believed to be innocent, even after he had said wrongly that the\ncheque had been paid to him by Mr. Soames; but he had since stated\nthat he had received it from Dean Arabin, and that statement was also\nshown to be false. A man who has a cheque changed on his own behalf\nis bound at least to show where he got the cheque. Mr. Crawley had\nnot only failed to do this, but had given two false excuses. Henry\nGrantly, as he drove home to Silverbridge on the Sunday afternoon,\nsummed up all the evidence in his own mind, and brought in a verdict\nof Guilty against the father of the girl whom he loved.\n\nOn the following morning he walked into Silverbridge and called at\nMiss Prettyman's house. As he went along his heart was warmer towards\nGrace than it had ever been before. He had told himself that he was\nnow bound to abstain, for his father's sake, from doing that which\nhe had told his father that he would certainly do. But he knew also,\nthat he had said that which, though it did not bind him to Miss\nCrawley, gave her a right to expect that he would so bind himself.\nAnd Miss Prettyman could not but be aware of what his intention had\nbeen, and could not but expect that he should now be explicit. Had\nhe been a wise man altogether, he would probably have abstained from\nsaying anything at the present moment,--a wise man, that is, in the\nways and feelings of the world in such matters. But, as there are men\nwho will allow themselves all imaginable latitude in their treatment\nof women, believing that the world will condone any amount of fault\nof that nature, so are there other men, and a class of men which on\nthe whole is the more numerous of the two, who are tremblingly alive\nto the danger of censure on this head,--and to the danger of censure\nnot only from others, but from themselves also. Major Grantly had\ndone that which made him think it imperative upon him to do something\nfurther, and to do that something at once.\n\nTherefore he started off on the Monday morning after breakfast and\nwalked to Silverbridge, and as he walked he built various castles in\nthe air. Why should he not marry Grace,--if she would have him,--and\ntake her away beyond the reach of her father's calamity? Why should\nhe not throw over his own people altogether, money, position,\nsociety, and all, and give himself up to love? Were he to do so, men\nmight say that he was foolish, but no one could hint that he was\ndishonourable. His spirit was high enough to teach him to think that\nsuch conduct on his part would have in it something of magnificence;\nbut, yet, such was not his purpose. In going to Miss Prettyman it was\nhis intention to apologize for not doing this magnificent thing. His\nmind was quite made up. Nevertheless he built those castles in the\nair.\n\nIt so happened that he encountered the younger Miss Prettyman in\nthe hall. It would not at all have suited him to reveal to her the\npurport of his visit, or ask her either to assist his suit or to\nreceive his apologies. Miss Anne Prettyman was too common a personage\nin the Silverbridge world to be fit for such employment. Miss Anne\nPrettyman was, indeed, herself submissive to him, and treated him\nwith the courtesy which is due to a superior being. He therefore\nsimply asked her whether he could be allowed to see her sister.\n\n\"Surely, Major Grantly;--that is, I think so. It is a little early,\nbut I think she can receive you.\"\n\n\"It is early, I know; but as I want to say a word or two on\nbusiness--\"\n\n\"Oh, on business. I am sure she will see you on business; she will\nonly be too proud. If you will be kind enough to step in here for two\nminutes.\" Then Miss Anne, having deposited the major in the little\nparlour, ran upstairs with her message to her sister. \"Of course it's\nabout Grace Crawley,\" she said to herself as she went. \"It can't be\nabout anything else. I wonder what it is he's going to say. If he's\ngoing to pop, and the father in all this trouble, he's the finest\nfellow that ever trod.\" Such were her thoughts as she tapped at the\ndoor and announced in the presence of Grace that there was somebody\nin the hall.\n\n\"It's Major Grantly,\" whispered Anne, as soon as Grace had shut the\ndoor behind her.\n\n\"So I supposed by your telling her not to go into the hall. What has\nhe come to say?\"\n\n\"How on earth can I tell you that, Annabella? But I suppose he can\nhave only one thing to say after all that has come and gone. He can\nonly have come with one object.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't have come to me for that. He would have asked to see\nherself.\"\n\n\"But she never goes out now, and he can't see her.\"\n\n\"Or he would have gone to them over at Hogglestock,\" said Miss\nPrettyman. \"But of course he must come up now he is here. Would you\nmind telling him? or shall I ring the bell?\"\n\n\"I'll tell him. We need not make more fuss than necessary, with the\nservants, you know. I suppose I'd better not come back with him?\"\n\nThere was a tone of supplication in the younger sister's voice as she\nmade the last suggestion, which ought to have melted the heart of the\nelder; but it was unavailing. \"As he has asked to see me, I think you\nhad better not,\" said Annabella. Miss Anne Prettyman bore her cross\nmeekly, offered no argument on the subject, and returning to the\nlittle parlour where she had left the major, brought him upstairs and\nushered him into her sister's room without even entering it again,\nherself.\n\nMajor Grantly was as intimately acquainted with Miss Anne Prettyman\nas a man under thirty may well be with a lady nearer fifty than\nforty, who is not specially connected with him by any family tie; but\nof Miss Prettyman he knew personally very much less. Miss Prettyman,\nas has before been said, did not go out, and was therefore not common\nto the eyes of the Silverbridgians. She did occasionally see her\nfriends in her own house, and Grace Crawley's lover, as the major had\ncome to be called, had been there on more than one occasion; but of\nreal personal intimacy between them there had hitherto existed none.\nHe might have spoken, perhaps, a dozen words to her in his life. He\nhad now more than a dozen to speak to her, but he hardly knew how to\ncommence them.\n\nShe had got up and curtseyed, and had then taken his hand and asked\nhim to sit down. \"My sister tells me that you want to see me,\" she\nsaid, in her softest, mildest voice.\n\n\"I do, Miss Prettyman. I want to speak to you about a matter that\ntroubles me very much,--very much indeed.\"\n\n\"Anything that I can do, Major Grantly--\"\n\n\"Thank you, yes. I know that you are very good, or I should not have\nventured to come to you. Indeed I shouldn't trouble you now, of\ncourse, if it was only about myself. I know very well what a great\nfriend you are to Miss Crawley.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am. We love Grace dearly here.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said the major, bluntly; \"I love her dearly, too.\" Then he\npaused, as though he thought that Miss Prettyman ought to take up the\nspeech. But Miss Prettyman seemed to think differently, and he was\nobliged to go on. \"I don't know whether you have ever heard about it,\nor noticed it, or--or--or--\" He felt that he was very awkward, and he\nblushed. Major as he was, he blushed as he sat before the old woman,\ntrying to tell his story, but not knowing how to tell it. \"The truth\nis, Miss Prettyman, I have done all but ask her to be my wife, and\nnow has come this terrible affair about her father.\"\n\n\"It is a terrible affair, Major Grantly; very terrible.\"\n\n\"By Jove, you may say that!\"\n\n\"Of course Mr. Crawley is as innocent in the matter as you or I are.\"\n\n\"You think so, Miss Prettyman?\"\n\n\"Think so! I feel quite sure of it. What; a clergyman of the Church\nof England, a pious, hard-working country clergyman, whom we have\nknown among us by his good works for years, suddenly turn thief,\nand pilfer a few pounds! It is not possible, Major Grantly. And the\nfather of such a daughter, too! It is not possible. It may do for\nmen of business to think so, lawyers and such like, who are obliged\nto think in accordance with the evidence, as they call it; but to\nmy mind the idea is monstrous. I don't know how he got it, and I\ndon't care; but I'm quite sure he did not steal it. Whoever heard of\nanybody becoming so base as that all at once?\"\n\nThe major was startled by her eloquence, and by the indignant tone of\nvoice in which it was expressed. It seemed to tell him that she would\ngive him no sympathy in that which he had come to say to her, and to\nupbraid him already in that he was not prepared to do the magnificent\nthing of which he had thought when he had been building his castles\nin the air. Why should he not do the magnificent thing? Miss\nPrettyman's eloquence was so strong that it half convinced him that\nthe Barchester Club and Mr. Walker had come to a wrong conclusion\nafter all.\n\n\"And how does Miss Crawley bear it?\" he asked, desirous of postponing\nfor a while any declaration of his own purpose.\n\n\"She is very unhappy, of course. Not that she thinks evil of her\nfather.\"\n\n\"Of course she does not think him guilty.\"\n\n\"Nobody thinks him so in this house, Major Grantly,\" said the little\nwoman, very imperiously. \"But Grace is, naturally enough, very\nsad;--very sad indeed. I do not think I can ask you to see her\nto-day.\"\n\n\"I was not thinking of it,\" said the major.\n\n\"Poor, dear girl! it is a great trial for her. Do you wish me to give\nher any message, Major Grantly?\"\n\nThe moment had now come in which he must say that which he had come\nto say. The little woman waited for an answer, and as he was there,\nwithin her power as it were, he must speak. I fear that what he said\nwill not be approved by any strong-minded reader. I fear that our\nlover will henceforth be considered by such a one as being but a\nweak, wishy-washy man, who had hardly any mind of his own to speak\nof;--that he was a man of no account, as the poor people say. \"Miss\nPrettyman, what message ought I to send to her?\" he said.\n\n\"Nay, Major Grantly, how can I tell you that? How can I put words\ninto your mouth?\"\n\n\"It isn't the words,\" he said; \"but the feelings.\"\n\n\"And how can I tell the feelings of your heart?\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that, I know what my feelings are. I do love her with all\nmy heart;--I do, indeed. A fortnight ago I was only thinking whether\nshe would accept me when I asked her,--wondering whether I was too\nold for her, and whether she would mind having Edith to take care\nof.\"\n\n\"She is very fond of Edith,--very fond indeed.\"\n\n\"Is she?\" said the major, more distracted than ever. Why should he\nnot do the magnificent thing after all? \"But it is a great charge for\na young girl when she marries.\"\n\n\"It is a great charge;--a very great charge. It is for you to think\nwhether you should entrust so great a charge to one so young.\"\n\n\"I have no fear about that at all.\"\n\n\"Nor should I have any,--as you ask me. We have known Grace well,\nthoroughly, and are quite sure that she will do her duty in that\nstate of life to which it may please God to call her.\"\n\nThe major was aware when this was said to him that he had not come\nto Miss Prettyman for a character of the girl he loved; and yet\nhe was not angry at receiving it. He was neither angry, nor even\nindifferent. He accepted the character almost gratefully, though\nhe felt that he was being led away from his purpose. He consoled\nhimself for this, however, by remembering that the path by which Miss\nPrettyman was now leading him, led to the magnificent, and to those\npleasant castles in the air which he had been building as he walked\ninto Silverbridge. \"I am quite sure that she is all that you say,\" he\nreplied. \"Indeed I had made up my mind about that long ago.\"\n\n\"And what can I do for you, Major Grantly?\"\n\n\"You think I ought not to see her?\"\n\n\"I will ask herself, if you please. I have such trust in her judgment\nthat I should leave her altogether to her own discretion.\"\n\nThe magnificent thing must be done, and the major made up his mind\naccordingly. Something of regret came over his spirit as he thought\nof a father-in-law disgraced and degraded, and of his own father\nbroken-hearted. But now there was hardly an alternative left to him.\nAnd was it not the manly thing for him to do? He had loved the girl\nbefore this trouble had come upon her, and was he not bound to accept\nthe burden which his love had brought with it? \"I will see her,\" he\nsaid, \"at once, if you will let me, and ask her to be my wife. But I\nmust see her alone.\"\n\nThen Miss Prettyman paused. Hitherto she had undoubtedly been playing\nher fish cautiously, or rather her young friend's fish,--perhaps I\nmay say cunningly. She had descended to artifice on behalf of the\ngirl whom she loved, admired, and pitied. She had seen some way into\nthe man's mind, and had been partly aware of his purpose,--of his\ninfirmity of purpose, of his double purpose. She had perceived that a\nword from her might help Grace's chance, and had led the man on till\nhe had committed himself, at any rate to her. In doing this she had\nbeen actuated by friendship rather than by abstract principle. But\nnow, when the moment had come in which she must decide upon some\naction, she paused. Was it right, for the sake of either of them,\nthat an offer of marriage should be made at such a moment as this?\nIt might be very well, in regard to some future time, that the major\nshould have so committed himself. She saw something of the man's\nspirit, and believed that, having gone so far,--having so far told\nhis love, he would return to his love hereafter, let the result of\nthe Crawley trial be what it might. But,--but, this could be no\nproper time for love-making. Though Grace loved the man, as Miss\nPrettyman knew well,--though Grace loved the child, having allowed\nherself to long to call it her own, though such a marriage would be\nthe making of Grace's fortune as those who loved her could hardly\nhave hoped that it should ever have been made, she would certainly\nrefuse the man, if he were to propose to her now. She would refuse\nhim, and then the man would be free;--free to change his mind if he\nthought fit. Considering all these things, craftily in the exercise\nof her friendship, too cunningly, I fear, to satisfy the claims of a\nhigh morality, she resolved that the major had better not see Miss\nCrawley at the present moment. Miss Prettyman paused before she\nreplied, and, when she did speak, Major Grantly had risen from his\nchair and was standing with his back to the fire. \"Major Grantly,\"\nshe said, \"you shall see her if you please, and if she pleases; but I\ndoubt whether her answer at such a moment as this would be that which\nyou would wish to receive.\"\n\n\"You think she would refuse me?\"\n\n\"I do not think that she would accept you now. She would feel,--I am\nsure she would feel, that these hours of her father's sorrow are not\nhours in which love should be either offered or accepted. You shall,\nhowever, see her if you please.\"\n\nThe major allowed himself a moment for thought; and as he thought he\nsighed. Grace Crawley became more beautiful in his eyes than ever,\nwas endowed by these words from Miss Prettyman with new charms and\nbrighter virtues than he had seen before. Let come what might he\nwould ask her to be his wife on some future day, if he did not so ask\nher now. For the present, perhaps, he had better be guided by Miss\nPrettyman. \"Then I will not see her,\" he said.\n\n\"I think that will be the wiser course.\"\n\n\"Of course you knew before this that I--loved her?\"\n\n\"I thought so, Major Grantly.\"\n\n\"And that I intended to ask her to be my wife?\"\n\n\"Well; since you put the question to me so plainly, I must confess\nthat as Grace's friend I should not quite have let things go on as\nthey have gone,--though I am not at all disposed to interfere with\nany girl whom I believe to be pure and good as I know her to be,--but\nstill I should hardly have been justified in letting things go as\nthey have gone, if I had not believed that such was your purpose.\"\n\n\"I wanted to set myself right with you, Miss Prettyman.\"\n\n\"You are right with me,--quite right;\" and she got up and gave him\nher hand. \"You are a fine, noble-hearted gentleman, and I hope that\nour Grace may live to be your happy wife, and the mother of your\ndarling child, and the mother of other children. I do not see how a\nwoman could have a happier lot in life.\"\n\n\"And will you give Grace my love?\"\n\n\"I will tell her at any rate that you have been here, and that\nyou have inquired after her with the greatest kindness. She will\nunderstand what that means without any word of love.\"\n\n\"Can I do anything for her,--or for her father; I mean in the way\nof--money? I don't mind mentioning it to you, Miss Prettyman.\"\n\n\"I will tell her that you are ready to do it, if anything can be\ndone. For myself I feel no doubt that the mystery will be cleared up\nat last; and then, if you will come here, we shall be so glad to see\nyou.--I shall, at least.\"\n\nThen the major went, and Miss Prettyman herself actually descended\nwith him into the hall, and bade him farewell most affectionately\nbefore her sister and two of the maids who came out to open the door.\nMiss Anne Prettyman, when she saw the great friendship with which\nthe major was dismissed, could not contain herself, but asked most\nimpudent questions, in a whisper indeed, but in such a whisper that\nany sharp-eared maid-servant could hear and understand them. \"Is\nit settled,\" she asked when her sister had ascended only the first\nflight of stairs;--\"has he popped?\" The look with which the elder\nsister punished and dismayed the younger, I would not have borne for\ntwenty pounds. She simply looked, and said nothing, but passed on.\nWhen she had regained her room she rang the bell, and desired the\nservant to ask Miss Crawley to be good enough to step to her. Poor\nMiss Anne retired discomforted into the solitude of one of the lower\nrooms, and sat for some minutes all alone, recovering from the shock\nof her sister's anger. \"At any rate, he hasn't popped,\" she said to\nherself, as she made her way back to the school.\n\nAfter that Miss Prettyman and Miss Crawley were closeted together for\nabout an hour. What passed between them need not be repeated here\nword for word; but it may be understood that Miss Prettyman said no\nmore than she ought to have said, and that Grace understood all that\nshe ought to have understood.\n\n\"No man ever behaved with more considerate friendship, or more like a\ngentleman,\" said Miss Prettyman.\n\n\"I am sure he is very good, and I am so glad he did not ask to see\nme,\" said Grace. Then Grace went away, and Miss Prettyman sat awhile\nin thought, considering what she had done, not without some stings of\nconscience.\n\nMajor Grantly, as he walked home, was not altogether satisfied with\nhimself, though he gave himself credit for some diplomacy which I\ndo not think he deserved. He felt that Miss Prettyman and the world\nin general, should the world in general ever hear anything about\nit, would give him credit for having behaved well; and that he had\nobtained this credit without committing himself to the necessity\nof marrying the daughter of a thief, should things turn out badly\nin regard to the father. But,--and this but robbed him of all the\npleasure which comes from real success,--but he had not treated Grace\nCrawley with the perfect generosity which love owes, and he was in\nsome degree ashamed of himself. He felt, however, that he might\nprobably have Grace, should he choose to ask for her when this\ntrouble should have passed by. \"And I will,\" he said to himself, as\nhe entered the gate of his own paddock, and saw his child in her\nperambulator before the nurse. \"And I will ask her, sooner or later,\nlet things go as they may.\" Then he took the perambulator under his\nown charge for half-an-hour, to the satisfaction of the nurse, of the\nchild, and of himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nMR. CRAWLEY IS TAKEN TO SILVERBRIDGE.\n\n\nIt had become necessary on the Monday morning that Mrs. Crawley\nshould obtain from her husband an undertaking that he would present\nhimself before the magistrates at Silverbridge on the Thursday. She\nhad been made to understand that the magistrates were sinning against\nthe strict rule of the law in not issuing a warrant at once for Mr.\nCrawley's apprehension; and that they were so sinning at the instance\nof Mr. Walker,--at whose instance they would have committed almost\nany sin practicable by a board of English magistrates, so great was\ntheir faith in him; and she knew that she was bound to answer her\nengagement. She had also another task to perform--that, namely,\nof persuading him to employ an attorney for his defence; and she\nwas prepared with the name of an attorney, one Mr. Mason, also of\nSilverbridge, who had been recommended to her by Mr. Walker. But when\nshe came to the performance of these two tasks on the Monday morning,\nshe found that she was unable to accomplish either of them. Mr.\nCrawley first declared that he would have nothing to do with any\nattorney. As to that he seemed to have made up his mind beforehand,\nand she saw at once that she had no hope of shaking him. But when she\nfound that he was equally obstinate in the other matter, and that he\ndeclared that he would not go before the magistrates unless he were\nmade to do so,--unless the policemen came and fetched him, then she\nalmost sank beneath the burden of her troubles, and for a while was\ndisposed to let things go as they would. How could she strive to bear\na load that was so manifestly too heavy for her shoulders?\n\nOn the Sunday the poor man had exerted himself to get through his\nSunday duties, and he had succeeded. He had succeeded so well that\nhis wife had thought that things might yet come right with him, that\nhe would remember, before it was too late, the true history of that\nunhappy bit of paper, and that he was rising above that half madness\nwhich for months past had afflicted him. On the Sunday evening, when\nhe was tired with his work, she thought it best to say nothing to him\nabout the magistrates and the business of Thursday. But on the Monday\nmorning she commenced her task, feeling that she owed it to Mr.\nWalker to lose no more time. He was very decided in his manners and\nmade her understand that he would employ no lawyer on his own behalf.\n\"Why should I want a lawyer? I have done nothing wrong,\" he said.\nThen she tried to make him understand that many who may have done\nnothing wrong require a lawyer's aid. \"And who is to pay him?\" he\nasked. To this she replied, unfortunately, that there would be no\nneed of thinking of that at once. \"And I am to get further into\ndebt!\" he said. \"I am to put myself right before the world by\nincurring debts which I know I can never pay? When it has been a\nquestion of food for the children I have been weak, but I will not be\nweak in such a matter as this. I will have no lawyer.\" She did not\nregard this denial on his part as very material, though she would\nfain have followed Mr. Walker's advice had she been able; but when,\nlater in the day, he declared that the police should fetch him, then\nher spirit gave way. Early in the morning he had seemed to assent to\nthe expediency of going into Silverbridge on the Thursday, and it was\nnot till after he had worked himself into a rage about the proposed\nattorney, that he utterly refused to make the journey. During the\nwhole day, however, his state was such as almost to break his wife's\nheart. He would do nothing. He would not go to the school, nor even\nstir beyond the house-door. He would not open a book. He would not\neat, nor would he even sit at table or say the accustomed grace\nwhen the scanty mid-day meal was placed upon the table. \"Nothing is\nblessed to me,\" he said, when his wife pressed him to say the words\nfor their child's sake. \"Shall I say that I thank God when my heart\nis thankless? Shall I serve my child by a lie?\" Then for hours he\nsat in the same position, in the old arm-chair, hanging over the\nfire speechless, sleepless, thinking ever, as she well knew, of the\ninjustice of the world. She hardly dared to speak to him, so great\nwas the bitterness of his words when he was goaded to reply. At last,\nlate in the evening, feeling that it would be her duty to send in to\nMr. Walker early on the following morning, she laid her hand gently\non his shoulder and asked him for his promise. \"I may tell Mr. Walker\nthat you will be there on Thursday?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, shouting at her. \"No. I will have no such message\nsent.\" She started back, trembling. Not that she was accustomed to\ntremble at his ways, or to show that she feared him in his paroxysms,\nbut that his voice had been louder than she had before known it. \"I\nwill hold no intercourse with them at Silverbridge in this matter. Do\nyou hear me, Mary?\"\n\n\"I hear you, Josiah; but I must keep my word to Mr. Walker. I\npromised that I would send to him.\"\n\n\"Tell him, then, that I will not stir a foot out of this house on\nThursday, of my own accord. On Thursday I shall be here; and here I\nwill remain all day,--unless they take me hence by force.\"\n\n\"But, Josiah--\"\n\n\"Will you obey me, or I shall walk into Silverbridge myself and tell\nthe man that I will not come to him.\" Then he arose from his chair\nand stretched forth his hand to his hat as though he were going forth\nimmediately, on his way to Silverbridge. The night was now pitch\ndark, and the rain was falling, and abroad he would encounter all the\nseverity of the pitiless winter. Still it might have been better that\nhe should have gone. The exercise and the fresh air, even the wet and\nthe mud, would have served to bring back his mind to reason. But his\nwife thought of the misery of the journey, of his scanty clothing, of\nhis worn boots, of the need there was to preserve the raiment which\nhe wore; and she remembered that he was fasting,--that he had eaten\nnothing since the morning, and that he was not fit to be alone. She\nstopped him, therefore, before he could reach the door.\n\n\"Your bidding shall be done,\" she said,--\"of course.\"\n\n\"Tell them, then, that they must seek me here if they want me.\"\n\n\"But, Josiah, think of the parish,--of the people who respect\nyou,--for their sakes let it not be said that you were taken away by\npolicemen.\"\n\n\"Was St. Paul not bound in prison? Did he think of what the people\nmight see?\"\n\n\"If it were necessary, I would encourage you to bear it without a\nmurmur.\"\n\n\"It is necessary, whether you murmur, or do not murmur. Murmur,\nindeed! Why does not your voice ascend to heaven with one loud wail\nagainst the cruelty of man?\" Then he went forth from the room into an\nempty chamber on the other side of the passage; and his wife, when\nshe followed him there after a few minutes, found him on his knees,\nwith his forehead against the floor, and with his hands clutching at\nthe scanty hairs of his head. Often before had she seen him so, on\nthe same spot, half grovelling, half prostrate in prayer, reviling\nin his agony all things around him,--nay, nearly all things above\nhim,--and yet striving to reconcile himself to his Creator by the\nhumiliation of confession.\n\nIt might be better with him now, if only he could bring himself to\nsome softness of heart. Softly she closed the door, and placing the\ncandle on the mantel-shelf, softly she knelt beside him, and softly\ntouched his hand with hers. He did not stir nor utter a word, but\nseemed to clutch at his thin locks more violently than before. Then\nshe kneeling there, aloud, but with low voice, with her thin hands\nclasped, uttered a prayer in which she asked her God to remove from\nher husband the bitterness of that hour. He listened till she had\nfinished, and then he rose slowly to his feet. \"It is in vain,\" said\nhe. \"It is all in vain. It is all in vain.\" Then he returned back to\nthe parlour, and seating himself again in the arm-chair, remained\nthere without speaking till past midnight. At last, when she told him\nthat she herself was very cold, and reminded him that for the last\nhour there had been no fire, still speechless, he went up with her to\ntheir bed.\n\nEarly on the following morning she contrived to let him know that she\nwas about to send a neighbour's son over with a note to Mr. Walker,\nfearing to urge him further to change his mind; but hoping that he\nmight express his purpose of doing so when he heard that the letter\nwas to be sent; but he took no notice whatever of her words. At this\nmoment he was reading Greek with his daughter, or rather rebuking her\nbecause she could not be induced to read Greek.\n\n\"Oh, papa,\" the poor girl said, \"don't scold me now. I am so unhappy\nbecause of all this.\"\n\n\"And am not I unhappy?\" he said, as he closed the book. \"My God,\nwhat have I done against thee, that my lines should be cast in such\nterrible places?\"\n\nThe letter was sent to Mr. Walker. \"He knows himself to be innocent,\"\nsaid the poor wife, writing what best excuse she knew how to make,\n\"and thinks that he should take no step himself in such a matter. He\nwill not employ a lawyer, and he says that he should prefer that he\nshould be sent for, if the law requires his presence at Silverbridge\non Thursday.\" All this she wrote, as though she felt that she ought\nto employ a high tone in defending her husband's purpose; but she\nbroke down altogether in the few words of the postscript. \"Indeed,\nindeed I have done what I could!\" Mr. Walker understood it all, both\nthe high tone and the subsequent fall.\n\nOn the Thursday morning, at about ten o'clock, a fly stopped at the\ngate of the Hogglestock Parsonage, and out of it there came two\nmen. One was dressed in ordinary black clothes, and seemed from his\nbearing to be a respectable man of the middle class of life. He\nwas, however, the superintendent of police for the Silverbridge\ndistrict. The other man was a policeman, pure and simple, with the\nhelmet-looking hat which has lately become common, and all the\nordinary half-military and wholly disagreeable outward adjuncts of\nthe profession. \"Wilkins,\" said the superintendent, \"likely enough I\nshall want you, for they tell me the gent is uncommon strange. But if\nI don't call you when I come out, just open the door like a servant,\nand mount up on the box when we're in. And don't speak nor say\nnothing.\" Then the senior policeman entered the house.\n\nHe found Mrs. Crawley sitting in the parlour with her bonnet and\nshawl on, and Mr. Crawley in the arm-chair, leaning over the fire.\n\"I suppose we had better go with you,\" said Mrs. Crawley directly the\ndoor was opened; for of course she had seen the arrival of the fly\nfrom the window.\n\n\"The gentleman had better come with us if he'll be so kind,\" said\nThompson. \"I've brought a close carriage for him.\"\n\n\"But I may go with him?\" said the wife, with frightened voice. \"I may\naccompany my husband. He is not well, sir, and wants assistance.\"\n\nThompson thought about it for a moment before he spoke. There was\nroom in the fly for only two, or if for three, still he knew his\nplace better than to thrust himself inside together with his prisoner\nand his prisoner's wife. He had been specially asked by Mr. Walker\nto be very civil. Only one could sit on the box with the driver, and\nif the request was conceded the poor policeman must walk back. The\nwalk, however, would not kill the policeman. \"All right, ma'am,\" said\nThompson;--\"that is, if the gentleman will just pass his word not to\nget out till I ask him.\"\n\n\"He will not! He will not!\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\n\"I will pass my word for nothing,\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\nUpon hearing this, Thompson assumed a very long face, and shook his\nhead as he turned his eyes first towards the husband and then towards\nthe wife, and shrugged his shoulders, and compressing his lips, blew\nout his breath, as though in this way he might blow off some of the\nmingled sorrow and indignation with which the gentleman's words\nafflicted him.\n\nMrs. Crawley rose and came close to him. \"You may take my word for\nit, he will not stir. You may indeed. He thinks it incumbent on him\nnot to give any undertaking himself, because he feels himself to be\nso harshly used.\"\n\n\"I don't know about harshness,\" said Thompson, brindling up. \"A close\ncarriage brought, and--\"\n\n\"I will walk. If I am made to go, I will walk,\" shouted Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"I did not allude to you,--or to Mr. Walker,\" said the poor wife.\n\"I know you have been most kind. I meant the harshness of the\ncircumstances. Of course he is innocent, and you must feel for him.\"\n\n\"Yes, I feel for him, and for you too, ma'am.\"\n\n\"That is all I meant. He knows his own innocence, and therefore he is\nunwilling to give way in anything.\"\n\n\"Of course he knows hisself, that's certain. But he'd better come in\nthe carriage, if only because of the dirt and slush.\"\n\n\"He will go in the carriage; and I will go with him. There will be\nroom there for you, sir.\"\n\nThompson looked up at the rain, and told himself that it was very\ncold. Then he remembered Mr. Walker's injunction, and bethought\nhimself that Mrs. Crawley, in spite of her poverty, was a lady. He\nconceived even unconsciously the idea that something was due to her\nbecause of her poverty. \"I'll go with the driver,\" said he, \"but\nhe'll only give hisself a deal of trouble if he attempts to get out.\"\n\n\"He won't; he won't,\" said Mrs. Crawley. \"And I thank you with all my\nheart.\"\n\n\"Come along, then,\" said Thompson.\n\nShe went up to her husband, hat in hand, and looking round to see\nthat she was not watched, put the hat on his head, and then lifted\nhim as it were from his chair. He did not refuse to be led, and\nallowed her to throw round his shoulders the old cloak which was\nhanging in the passage, and then he passed out, and was the first\nto seat himself in the Silverbridge fly. His wife followed him, and\ndid not hear the blandishments with which Thompson instructed his\nmyrmidon to follow through the mud on foot. Slowly they made their\nway through the lanes, and it was nearly twelve when the fly was\ndriven into the yard of the \"George and Vulture\" at Silverbridge.\n\nSilverbridge, though it was blessed with a mayor and corporation,\nand was blessed also with a Member of Parliament all to itself, was\nnot blessed with any court-house. The magistrates were therefore\ncompelled to sit in the big room at the \"George and Vulture,\" in\nwhich the county balls were celebrated, and the meeting of the West\nBarsetshire freemasons was held. That part of the country was, no\ndoubt, very much ashamed of its backwardness in this respect, but\nas yet nothing had been done to remedy the evil. Thompson and his\nfly were therefore driven into the yard of the Inn, and Mr. and\nMrs. Crawley were ushered by him up into a little bed-chamber close\nadjoining to the big room in which the magistrates were already\nassembled. \"There's a bit of fire here,\" said Thompson, \"and you can\nmake yourselves a little warm.\" He himself was shivering with the\ncold. \"When the gents is ready in there, I'll just come and fetch\nyou.\"\n\n\"I may go in with him?\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\n\"I'll have a chair for you at the end of the table, just nigh to\nhim,\" said Thompson. \"You can slip into it and say nothing to\nnobody.\" Then he left them and went away to the magistrates.\n\nMr. Crawley had not spoken a word since he had entered the vehicle.\nNor had she said much to him, but had sat with him holding his hand\nin hers. Now he spoke to her,--\"Where is it that we are?\" he asked.\n\n\"At Silverbridge, dearest.\"\n\n\"But what is this chamber? And why are we here?\"\n\n\"We are to wait here till the magistrates are ready. They are in the\nnext room.\"\n\n\"But this is the Inn?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, it is the Inn.\"\n\n\"And I see crowds of people about.\" There were crowds of people\nabout. There had been men in the yard, and others standing about on\nthe stairs, and the public room was full of men who were curious to\nsee the clergyman who had stolen twenty pounds, and to hear what\nwould be the result of the case before the magistrates. He must be\ncommitted; so, at least, said everybody; but then there would be the\nquestion of bail. Would the magistrates let him out on bail, and who\nwould be the bailsmen? \"Why are the people here?\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"I suppose it is the custom when the magistrates are sitting,\" said\nhis wife.\n\n\"They have come to see the degradation of a clergyman,\" said\nhe;--\"and they will not be disappointed.\"\n\n\"Nothing can degrade but guilt,\" said his wife.\n\n\"Yes,--misfortune can degrade, and poverty. A man is degraded when\nthe cares of the world press so heavily upon him that he cannot rouse\nhimself. They have come to look at me as though I were a hunted\nbeast.\"\n\n\"It is but their custom always on such days.\"\n\n\"They have not always a clergyman before them as a criminal.\" Then he\nwas silent for a while, while she was chafing his cold hands. \"Would\nthat I were dead, before they had brought me to this! Would that I\nwere dead!\"\n\n\"Is it not right, dear, that we should all bear what He sends us?\"\n\n\"Would that I were dead!\" he repeated. \"The load is too heavy for me\nto bear, and I would that I were dead!\"\n\nThe time seemed to be very long before Thompson returned and asked\nthem to accompany him into the big room. When he did so, Mr. Crawley\ngrasped hold of his chair as though he had resolved that he would not\ngo. But his wife whispered a word to him, and he obeyed her. \"He will\nfollow me,\" she said to the policeman. And in that way they went from\nthe small room into the large one. Thompson went first; Mrs. Crawley\nwith her veil down came next; and the wretched man followed his wife,\nwith his eyes fixed upon the ground and his hands clasped together\nupon his breast. He could at first have seen nothing, and could\nhardly have known where he was when they placed him in a chair. She,\nwith a better courage, contrived to look round through her veil, and\nsaw that there was a long board or table covered with green cloth,\nand that six or seven gentlemen were sitting at one end of it, while\nthere seemed to be a crowd standing along the sides and about the\nroom. Her husband was seated at the other end of the table, near\nthe corner, and round the corner,--so that she might be close to\nhim,--her chair had been placed. On the other side of him there was\nanother chair, now empty, intended for any professional gentleman\nwhom he might choose to employ.\n\nThere were five magistrates sitting there. Lord Lufton, from Framley,\nwas in the chair;--a handsome man, still young, who was very popular\nin the county. The cheque which had been cashed had borne his\nsignature, and he had consequently expressed his intention of not\nsitting at the board; but Mr. Walker, desirous of having him there,\nhad overruled him, showing him that the loss was not his loss. The\ncheque, if stolen, had not been stolen from him. He was not the\nprosecutor. \"No, by Jove,\" said Lord Lufton, \"if I could quash the\nwhole thing, I'd do it at once!\"\n\n\"You can't do that, my lord, but you may help us at the board,\" said\nMr. Walker.\n\nThen there was the Hon. George De Courcy, Lord De Courcy's brother,\nfrom Castle Courcy. Lord De Courcy did not live in the county, but\nhis brother did so, and endeavoured to maintain the glory of the\nfamily by the discretion of his conduct. He was not, perhaps, among\nthe wisest of men, but he did very well as a country magistrate,\nholding his tongue, keeping his eyes open, and, on such occasions as\nthis, obeying Mr. Walker in all things. Dr. Tempest was also there,\nthe rector of the parish, he being both magistrate and clergyman.\nThere were many in Silverbridge who declared that Dr. Tempest would\nhave done far better to stay away when a brother clergyman was\nthus to be brought before the bench; but it had been long since Dr.\nTempest had cared what was said about him in Silverbridge. He had\nbecome so accustomed to the life he led as to like to be disliked,\nand to be enamoured of unpopularity. So when Mr. Walker had ventured\nto suggest to him that, perhaps, he might not choose to be there, he\nhad laughed Mr. Walker to scorn. \"Of course I shall be there,\" he\nsaid. \"I am interested in the case,--very much interested. Of course\nI shall be there.\" And had not Lord Lufton been present he would have\nmade himself more conspicuous by taking the chair. Mr. Fothergill was\nthe fourth. Mr. Fothergill was man of business to the Duke of Omnium,\nwho was the great owner of property in and about Silverbridge, and he\nwas the most active magistrate in that part of the county. He was a\nsharp man, and not at all likely to have any predisposition in favour\nof a clergyman. The fifth was Dr. Thorne, of Chaldicotes, a gentleman\nwhose name has been already mentioned in these pages. He had been\nfor many years a medical man practising in a little village in the\nfurther end of the county; but it had come to be his fate, late in\nlife, to marry a great heiress, with whose money the ancient house\nand domain of Chaldicotes had been purchased from the Sowerbys. Since\nthen Dr. Thorne had done his duty well as a country gentleman,--not,\nhowever, without some little want of smoothness between him and the\nduke's people.\n\nChaldicotes lay next to the duke's territory, and the duke had wished\nto buy Chaldicotes. When Chaldicotes slipped through the duke's\nfingers and went into the hands of Dr. Thorne,--or of Dr. Thorne's\nwife,--the duke had been very angry with Mr. Fothergill. Hence it had\ncome to pass that there had not always been smoothness between the\nduke's people and the Chaldicotes people. It was now rumoured that\nDr. Thorne intended to stand for the county on the next vacancy, and\nthat did not tend to make things smoother. On the right hand of Lord\nLufton sat Lord George and Mr. Fothergill, and beyond Mr. Fothergill\nsat Mr. Walker, and beyond Mr. Walker sat Mr. Walker's clerk. On the\nleft hand of the chairman were Dr. Tempest and Dr. Thorne, and a\nlittle lower down was Mr. Zachary Winthrop, who held the situation of\nclerk to the magistrates. Many people in Silverbridge said that this\nwas all wrong, as Mr. Winthrop was partner with Mr. Walker, who was\nalways employed before the magistrates if there was any employment\ngoing for an attorney. For this, however, Mr. Walker cared very\nlittle. He had so much of his own way in Silverbridge, that he was\nsupposed to care nothing for anybody.\n\nThere were many other gentlemen in the room, and some who knew Mr.\nCrawley with more or less intimacy. He, however, took notice of no\none, and when one friend, who had really known him well, came up\nbehind and spoke to him gently leaning over his chair, the poor man\nhardly recognized his friend.\n\n\"I'm sure your husband won't forget me,\" said Mr. Robarts, the\nclergyman of Framley, as he gave his hand to that lady across the\nback of Mr. Crawley's chair.\n\n\"No, Mr. Robarts, he does not forget you. But you must excuse him if\nat this moment he is not quite himself. It is a trying situation for\na clergyman.\"\n\n\"I can understand all that; but I'll tell you why I have come. I\nsuppose this inquiry will finish the whole affair, and clear up\nwhatever may be the difficulty. But should it not do so, it may be\njust possible, Mrs. Crawley, that something may be said about bail. I\ndon't understand much about it, and I daresay you do not either; but\nif there should be anything of that sort, let Mr. Crawley name me.\nA brother clergyman will be best, and I'll have some other gentleman\nwith me.\" Then he left her, not waiting for any answer.\n\nAt the same time there was a conversation going on between Mr. Walker\nand another attorney standing behind him, Mr. Mason. \"I'll go to\nhim,\" said Walker, \"and try to arrange it.\" So Mr. Walker seated\nhimself in the empty chair beside Mr. Crawley, and endeavoured to\nexplain to the wretched man, that he would do well to allow Mr. Mason\nto assist him. Mr. Crawley seemed to listen to all that was said, and\nthen turned upon the speaker sharply: \"I will have no one to assist\nme,\" he said so loudly that every one in the room heard the words.\n\"I am innocent. Why should I want assistance? Nor have I money to\npay for it.\" Mr. Mason made a quick movement forward, intending to\nexplain that that consideration need offer no impediment, but was\nstopped by further speech from Mr. Crawley. \"I will have no one to\nhelp me,\" said he, standing upright, and for the first time removing\nhis hat from his head. \"Go on, and do what it is you have to do.\"\nAfter that he did not sit down till the proceedings were nearly over,\nthough he was invited more than once by Lord Lufton to do so.\n\nWe need not go through all the evidence that was brought to bear upon\nthe question. It was proved that money for the cheque was paid to Mr.\nCrawley's messenger, and that this money was given to Mr. Crawley.\nWhen there occurred some little delay in the chain of evidence\nnecessary to show that Mr. Crawley had signed and sent the cheque and\ngot the money, he became impatient. \"Why do you trouble the man?\" he\nsaid. \"I had the cheque, and I sent him; I got the money. Has any\none denied it, that you should strive to drive a poor man like that\nbeyond his wits?\" Then Mr. Soames and the manager of the bank showed\nwhat inquiry had been made as soon as the cheque came back from the\nLondon bank; how at first they had both thought that Mr. Crawley\ncould of course explain the matter, and how he had explained it by\na statement which was manifestly untrue. Then there was evidence to\nprove that the cheque could not have been paid to him by Mr. Soames,\nand as this was given, Mr. Crawley shook his head and again became\nimpatient. \"I erred in that,\" he exclaimed. \"Of course I erred. In my\nhaste I thought it was so, and in my haste I said so. I am not good\nat reckoning money and remembering sums; but I saw that I had been\nwrong when my error was shown to me, and I acknowledged at once that\nI had been wrong.\"\n\nUp to this point he had behaved not only with so much spirit, but\nwith so much reason, that his wife began to hope that the importance\nof the occasion had brought back the clearness of his mind, and that\nhe would, even now, be able to place himself right as the inquiry\nwent on. Then it was explained that Mr. Crawley had stated that the\ncheque had been given to him by Dean Arabin, as soon as it was shown\nthat it could not have been given to him by Mr. Soames. In reference\nto this, Mr. Walker was obliged to explain that application had been\nmade to the dean, who was abroad, and that the dean had stated that\nhe had given fifty pounds to his friend. Mr. Walker explained also\nthat the very notes of which this fifty pounds had consisted had been\ntraced back to Mr. Crawley, and that they had had no connection with\nthe cheque or with the money which had been given for the cheque at\nthe bank.\n\nMr. Soames stated that he had lost the cheque with a pocket-book;\nthat he had certainly lost it on the day on which he had called on\nMr. Crawley at Hogglestock; and that he missed his pocket-book on his\njourney back from Hogglestock to Barchester. At the moment of missing\nit he remembered that he had taken the book out from his pocket in\nMr. Crawley's room, and, at that moment, he had not doubted but\nthat he had left it in Mr. Crawley's house. He had written and\nsent to Mr. Crawley to inquire, but had been assured that nothing\nhad been found. There had been no other property of value in the\npocket-book,--nothing but a few visiting cards and a memorandum, and\nhe had therefore stopped the cheque at the London bank, and thought\nno more about it.\n\nMr. Crawley was then asked to explain in what way he came possessed\nof the cheque. The question was first put by Lord Lufton; but it soon\nfell into Mr. Walker's hands, who certainly asked it with all the\nkindness with which such an inquiry could be made. Could Mr. Crawley\nat all remember by what means that bit of paper had come into his\npossession, or how long he had had it? He answered the last question\nfirst. \"It had been with him for months.\" And why had he kept it? He\nlooked round the room sternly, almost savagely, before he answered,\nfixing his eyes for a moment upon almost every face around him as he\ndid so. Then he spoke. \"I was driven by shame to keep it,--and then\nby shame to use it.\" That this statement was true, no one in the room\ndoubted.\n\nAnd then the other question was pressed upon him; and he lifted up\nhis hands, and raised his voice, and swore by the Saviour in whom he\ntrusted, that he knew not from whence the money had come to him. Why\nthen had he said that it had come from the dean? He had thought so.\nThe dean had given him money, covered up, in an enclosure, \"so that\nthe touch of the coin might not add to my disgrace in taking his\nalms,\" said the wretched man, thus speaking openly and freely in his\nagony of the shame which he had striven so persistently to hide. He\nhad not seen the dean's monies as they had been given, and he had\nthought that the cheque had been with them. Beyond that he could tell\nthem nothing.\n\nThen there was a conference between the magistrates and Mr. Walker,\nin which Mr. Walker submitted that the magistrates had no alternative\nbut to commit the gentleman. To this Lord Lufton demurred, and with\nhim Dr. Thorne.\n\n\"I believe, as I am sitting here,\" said Lord Lufton, \"that he has\ntold the truth, and that he does not know any more than I do from\nwhence the cheque came.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure he does not,\" said Dr. Thorne.\n\nLord George remarked that it was the \"queerest go he had ever come\nacross.\" Dr. Tempest merely shook his head. Mr. Fothergill pointed\nout that even supposing the gentleman's statement to be true, it by\nno means went towards establishing the gentleman's innocence. The\ncheque had been traced to the gentleman's hands, and the gentleman\nwas bound to show how it had come into his possession. Even supposing\nthat the gentleman had found the cheque in his house, which was\nlikely enough, he was not thereby justified in changing it, and\napplying the proceeds to his own purposes. Mr. Walker told them that\nMr. Fothergill was right, and that the only excuse to be made for Mr.\nCrawley was that he was out of his senses.\n\n\"I don't see it,\" said Lord Lufton. \"I might have a lot of paper\nmoney by me, and not know from Adam where I got it.\"\n\n\"But you would have to show where you got it, my lord, when inquiry\nwas made,\" said Mr. Fothergill.\n\nLord Lufton, who was not particularly fond of Mr. Fothergill, and\nwas very unwilling to be instructed by him in any of the duties of a\nmagistrate, turned his back at once upon the duke's agent; but within\nthree minutes afterwards he had submitted to the same instructions\nfrom Mr. Walker.\n\nMr. Crawley had again seated himself, and during this period of the\naffair was leaning over the table with his face buried on his arms.\nMrs. Crawley sat by his side, utterly impotent as to any assistance,\njust touching him with her hand, and waiting behind her veil till\nshe should be made to understand what was the decision of the\nmagistrates. This was at last communicated to her,--and to him,--in\na whisper by Mr. Walker. Mr. Crawley must understand that he was\ncommitted to take his trial at Barchester, at the next assizes, which\nwould be held in April, but that bail would be taken;--his own bail\nin five hundred pounds, and that of two others in two hundred and\nfifty pounds each. And Mr. Walker explained further that he and the\nbailmen were ready, and that the bail-bond was prepared. The bailmen\nwere to be the Rev. Mr. Robarts, and Major Grantly. In five minutes\nthe bond was signed and Mr. Crawley was at liberty to go away, a free\nman,--till the Barchester Assizes should come round in April.\n\nOf all that was going on at this time Mr. Crawley knew little or\nnothing, and Mrs. Crawley did not know much. She did say a word of\nthanks to Mr. Robarts, and begged that the same might be said to--the\nother gentleman. If she had heard the major's name she did not\nremember it. Then they were led out back into the bed-room, where\nMrs. Walker was found, anxious to do something, if she only knew\nwhat, to comfort the wretched husband and the wretched wife. But what\ncomfort or consolation could there be within their reach? There was\ntea made ready for them, and sandwiches cut from the Inn larder. And\nthere was sherry in the Inn decanter. But no such comfort as that was\npossible for either of them.\n\nThey were taken home again in the fly, returning without the escort\nof Mr. Thompson, and as they went some few words were spoken by Mrs.\nCrawley. \"Josiah,\" she said, \"there will be a way out of this, even\nyet, if you will only hold up your head and trust.\"\n\n\"There is a way out of it,\" he said. \"There is a way. There is but\none way.\" When he had so spoken she said no more, but resolved that\nher eye should never be off him, no,--not for a moment. Then, when\nshe had gotten him once more into that front parlour, she threw her\narms round him and kissed him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nGRACE CRAWLEY GOES TO ALLINGTON.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe tidings of what had been done by the magistrates at their petty\nsessions was communicated the same night to Grace Crawley by Miss\nPrettyman. Miss Anne Prettyman had heard the news within five minutes\nof the execution of the bail-bond, and had rushed to her sister with\ninformation as to the event. \"They have found him guilty; they have,\nindeed. They have convicted him,--or whatever it is, because he\ncouldn't say where he got it.\" \"You do not mean that they have sent\nhim to prison?\" \"No;--not to prison; not as yet, that is. I don't\nunderstand it altogether; but he's to be tried again at the assizes.\nIn the meantime he's to be out on bail. Major Grantly is to be the\nbail,--he and Mr. Robarts. That, I think, was very nice of him.\" It\nwas undoubtedly the fact that Miss Anne Prettyman had received an\naccession of pleasurable emotion when she learned that Mr. Crawley\nhad not been sent away scathless, but had been condemned, as it\nwere, to a public trial at the assizes. And yet she would have\ndone anything in her power to save Grace Crawley, or even to save\nher father. And it must be explained that Miss Anne Prettyman was\nsupposed to be specially efficient in teaching Roman history to her\npupils, although she was so manifestly ignorant of the course of\nlaw in the country in which she lived. \"Committed him,\" said Miss\nPrettyman, correcting her sister with scorn. \"They have not convicted\nhim. Had they convicted him, there could be no question of bail.\"\n\"I don't know how all that is, Annabella, but at any rate Major\nGrantly is to be the bailsman, and there is to be another trial at\nBarchester.\" \"There cannot be more than one trial in a criminal\ncase,\" said Miss Prettyman, \"unless the jury should disagree, or\nsomething of that kind. I suppose he has been committed, and that the\ntrial will take place at the assizes.\" \"Exactly,--that's just it.\"\nHad Lord Lufton appeared as lictor, and had Thompson carried the\nfasces, Miss Anne would have known more about it.\n\nThe sad tidings were not told to Grace till the evening. Mrs.\nCrawley, when the inquiry was over before the magistrates, would fain\nhave had herself driven to the Miss Prettymans' school, that she\nmight see her daughter; but she felt that to be impossible while\nher husband was in her charge. The father would of course have gone\nto his child, had the visit been suggested to him; but that would\nhave caused another terrible scene; and the mother, considering it\nall in her mind, thought it better to abstain. Miss Prettyman did\nher best to make poor Grace think that the affair had gone so far\nfavourably,--did her best, that is, without saying anything which her\nconscience told her to be false. \"It is to be settled at the assizes\nin April,\" she said.\n\n\"And in the meantime what will become of papa?\"\n\n\"Your papa will be at home, just as usual. He must have some one to\nadvise him. I dare say it would have been all over now if he would\nhave employed an attorney.\"\n\n\"But it seems so hard that an attorney should be wanted.\"\n\n\"My dear Grace, things in this world are hard.\"\n\n\"But they are always harder for papa and mamma than for anybody\nelse.\" In answer to this, Miss Prettyman made some remarks intended\nto be wise and kind at the same time. Grace, whose eyes were laden\nwith tears, made no immediate reply to this, but reverted to her\nformer statement, that she must go home. \"I cannot remain, Miss\nPrettyman; I am so unhappy.\"\n\n\"Will you be more happy at home?\"\n\n\"I can bear it better there.\"\n\nThe poor girl soon learned from the intended consolations of those\naround her, from the ill-considered kindnesses of the pupils, and\nfrom words which fell from the servants, that her father had in\nfact been judged to be guilty, as far as judgment had as yet gone.\n\"They do say, miss, it's only because he hadn't a lawyer,\" said the\nhousekeeper. And if men so kind as Lord Lufton and Mr. Walker had\nmade him out to be guilty, what could be expected from a stern judge\ndown from London, who would know nothing about her poor father and\nhis peculiarities, and from twelve jurymen who would be shopkeepers\nout of Barchester. It would kill her father, and then it would kill\nher mother; and after that it would kill her also. And there was no\nmoney in the house at home. She knew it well. She had been paid three\npounds a month for her services at the school, and the money for the\nlast two months had been sent to her mother. Yet, badly as she wanted\nanything that she might be able to earn, she knew that she could\nnot go on teaching. It had come to be acknowledged by both the\nMiss Prettymans that any teaching on her part for the present was\nimpossible. She would go home and perish with the rest of them. There\nwas no room left for hope to her, or to any of her family. They had\naccused her father of being a common thief,--her father whom she knew\nto be so nobly honest, her father whom she believed to be among the\nmost devoted of God's servants. He was accused of a paltry theft, and\nthe magistrates and lawyers and policemen among them had decided that\nthe accusation was true! How could she look the girls in the face\nafter that, or attempt to hold her own among the teachers!\n\nOn the next morning there came the letter from Miss Lily Dale, and\nwith that in her hand she again went to Miss Prettyman. She must\ngo home, she said. She must at any rate see her mother. Could Miss\nPrettyman be kind enough to send her home. \"I haven't sixpence to pay\nfor anything,\" she said, bursting out into tears; \"and I haven't a\nright to ask for it.\" Then the statements which Miss Prettyman made\nin her eagerness to cover this latter misfortune were decidedly\nfalse. There was so much money owing to Grace, she said; money for\nthis, money for that, money for anything or nothing! Ten pounds would\nhardly clear the account. \"Nobody owes me anything; but if you'll\nlend me five shillings!\" said Grace, in her agony. Miss Prettyman, as\nshe made her way through this difficulty, thought of Major Grantly\nand his love. It would have been of no use, she knew. Had she brought\nthem together on that Monday, Grace would have said nothing to him.\nIndeed such a meeting at such a time would have been improper.\nBut, regarding Major Grantly, as she did, in the light of a\nmillionaire,--for the wealth of the archdeacon was notorious,--she\ncould not but think it a pity that poor Grace should be begging for\nfive shillings. \"You need not at any rate trouble yourself about\nmoney, Grace,\" said Miss Prettyman. \"What is a pound or two more or\nless between you and me? It is almost unkind of you to think about\nit. Is that letter in your hand anything for me to see, my dear?\"\nThen Grace explained that she did not wish to show Miss Dale's\nletter, but that Miss Dale had asked her to go to Allington. \"And you\nwill go,\" said Miss Prettyman. \"It will be the best thing for you,\nand the best thing for your mother.\"\n\nIt was at last decided that Grace should go to her friend at\nAllington, and to Allington she went. She returned home for a day or\ntwo, and was persuaded by her mother to accept the invitation that\nhad been given her. At Hogglestock, while she was there, new troubles\ncame up, of which something shall shortly be told; but they were\ntroubles in which Grace could give no assistance to her mother, and\nwhich, indeed, though they were in truth troubles, as will be seen,\nwere so far beneficent that they stirred her father up to a certain\naction which was in itself salutary. \"I think it will be better that\nyou should be away, dearest,\" said the mother, who now, for the first\ntime, heard plainly all that poor Grace had to tell about Major\nGrantly;--Grace having, heretofore, barely spoken, in most ambiguous\nwords, of Major Grantly as a gentleman whom she had met at Framley,\nand whom she had described as being \"very nice.\"\n\nIn old days, long ago, Lucy Robarts, the present Lady Lufton, sister\nof the Rev. Mark Robarts, the parson of Framley, had sojourned\nfor a while under Mr. Crawley's roof at Hogglestock. Peculiar\ncircumstances, which need not, perhaps, be told here, had given\noccasion for this visit. She had then resolved,--for her future\ndestiny had been known to her before she left Mrs. Crawley's\nhouse,--that she would in coming days do much to befriend the family\nof her friend; but the doing of much had been very difficult. And the\ndoing of anything had come to be very difficult through a certain\nindiscretion on Lord Lufton's part. Lord Lufton had offered\nassistance, pecuniary assistance, to Mr. Crawley, which Mr. Crawley\nhad rejected with outspoken anger. What was Lord Lufton to him that\nhis lordship should dare to come to him with his paltry money in his\nhand? But after a while, Lady Lufton, exercising some cunning in the\noperations of her friendship, had persuaded her sister-in-law at the\nFramley parsonage to have Grace Crawley over there as a visitor,--and\nthere she had been during the summer holidays previous to the\ncommencement of our story. And there, at Framley, she had become\nacquainted with Major Grantly, who was staying with Lord Lufton at\nFramley Court. She had then said something to her mother about Major\nGrantly, something ambiguous, something about his being \"very nice,\"\nand the mother had thought how great was the pity that her daughter,\nwho was \"nice\" too in her estimation, should have so few of those\nadjuncts to assist her which come from full pockets. She had thought\nno more about it then; but now she felt herself constrained to think\nmore. \"I don't quite understand why he should have come to Miss\nPrettyman on Monday,\" said Grace, \"because he hardly knows her at\nall.\"\n\n\"I suppose it was on business,\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\n\"No, mamma, it was not on business.\"\n\n\"How can you tell, dear?\"\n\n\"Because Miss Prettyman said it was,--it was--to ask after me. Oh,\nmamma, I must tell you. I know he did like me.\"\n\n\"Did he ever say so to you, dearest?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\"\n\n\"And what did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I told him nothing, mamma.\"\n\n\"And did he ask to see you on Monday?\"\n\n\"No, mamma; I don't think he did. I think he understood it all too\nwell, for I could not have spoken to him then.\"\n\nMrs. Crawley pursued the cross-examination no further, but made up\nher mind that it would be better that her girl should be away from\nher wretched home during this period of her life. If it were written\nin the book of fate that one of her children should be exempted from\nthe series of misfortunes which seemed to fall, one after another,\nalmost as a matter of course, upon her husband, upon her, and upon\nher family; if so great good fortune were in store for her Grace as\nsuch a marriage as this which seemed to be so nearly offered to her,\nit might probably be well that Grace should be as little at home as\npossible. Mrs. Crawley had heard nothing but good of Major Grantly;\nbut she knew that the Grantlys were proud rich people,--who lived\nwith their heads high up in the county,--and it could hardly be that\na son of the archdeacon would like to take his bride direct from\nHogglestock parsonage.\n\nIt was settled that Grace should go to Allington as soon as a letter\ncould be received from Miss Dale in return to Grace's note, and on\nthe third morning after her arrival at home she started. None but\nthey who have themselves been poor gentry,--gentry so poor as not to\nknow how to raise a shilling,--can understand the peculiar bitterness\nof the trials which such poverty produces. The poverty of the normal\npoor does not approach it; or, rather, the pangs arising from such\npoverty are altogether of a different sort. To be hungry and have no\nfood, to be cold and have no fuel, to be threatened with distraint\nfor one's few chairs and tables, and with the loss of the roof over\none's head,--all these miseries, which, if they do not positively\nreach, are so frequently near to reaching the normal poor, are, no\ndoubt, the severest of the trials to which humanity is subjected.\nThey threaten life,--or, if not life, then liberty,--reducing the\nabject one to a choice between captivity and starvation. By hook or\ncrook, the poor gentleman or poor lady,--let the one or the other\nbe ever so poor,--does not often come to the last extremity of the\nworkhouse. There are such cases, but they are exceptional. Mrs.\nCrawley, through all her sufferings, had never yet found her cupboard\nto be absolutely bare, or the bread-pan to be actually empty. But\nthere are pangs to which, at the time, starvation itself would seem\nto be preferable. The angry eyes of unpaid tradesmen, savage with\nan anger which one knows to be justifiable; the taunt of the poor\nservant who wants her wages; the gradual relinquishment of habits\nwhich the soft nurture of earlier, kinder years had made second\nnature; the wan cheeks of the wife whose malady demands wine; the\nrags of the husband whose outward occupations demand decency; the\nneglected children, who are learning not to be the children of\ngentlefolk; and, worse than all, the alms and doles of half-generous\nfriends, the waning pride, the pride that will not wane, the growing\ndoubt whether it be not better to bow the head, and acknowledge to\nall the world that nothing of the pride of station is left,--that the\nhand is open to receive and ready to touch the cap, that the fall\nfrom the upper to the lower level has been accomplished,--these are\nthe pangs of poverty which drive the Crawleys of the world to the\nfrequent entertaining of that idea of the bare bodkin. It was settled\nthat Grace should go to Allington;--but how about her clothes? And\nthen, whence was to come the price of her journey?\n\n\"I don't think they'll mind about my being shabby at Allington. They\nlive very quietly there.\"\n\n\"But you say that Miss Dale is so very nice in all her ways.\"\n\n\"Lily is very nice, mamma; but I shan't mind her so much as her\nmother, because she knows it all. I have told her everything.\"\n\n\"But you have given me all your money, dearest.\"\n\n\"Miss Prettyman told me I was to come to her,\" said Grace, who had\nalready taken some small sum from the schoolmistress, which at once\nhad gone into her mother's pocket, and into household purposes. \"She\nsaid I should be sure to go to Allington, and that of course I should\ngo to her, as I must pass through Silverbridge.\"\n\n\"I hope papa will not ask about it,\" said Mrs. Crawley. Luckily papa\ndid not ask about it, being at the moment occupied much with other\nthoughts and other troubles, and Grace was allowed to return by\nSilverbridge, and to take what was needed from Miss Prettyman. Who\ncan tell of the mending and patching, of the weary wearing midnight\nhours of needlework which were accomplished before the poor girl\nwent, so that she might not reach her friend's house in actual rags?\nAnd when the work was ended, what was there to show for it? I do not\nthink that the idea of the bare bodkin, as regarded herself, ever\nflitted across Mrs. Crawley's brain,--she being one of those who are\nvery strong to endure; but it must have occurred to her very often\nthat the repose of the grave is sweet, and that there cometh after\ndeath a levelling and making even of things, which would at last cure\nall her evils.\n\nGrace no doubt looked forward to a levelling and making even of\nthings,--or perhaps even to something more prosperous than that,\nwhich should come to her relief on this side of the grave. She could\nnot but have high hopes in regard to her future destiny. Although,\nas has been said, she understood no more than she ought to have\nunderstood from Miss Prettyman's account of the conversation with\nMajor Grantly, still, innocent as she was, she had understood much.\nShe knew that the man loved her, and she knew also that she loved the\nman. She thoroughly comprehended that the present could be to her no\ntime for listening to speeches of love, or for giving kind answers;\nbut still I think that she did look for relief on this side of the\ngrave.\n\n\"Tut, tut,\" said Miss Prettyman as Grace in vain tried to conceal her\ntears up in the private sanctum. \"You ought to know me by this time,\nand to have learned that I can understand things.\" The tears had\nflown in return not only for the five gold sovereigns which Miss\nPrettyman had pressed into her hand, but on account of the prettiest,\nsoft, grey merino frock that ever charmed a girl's eye. \"I should\nlike to know how many girls I have given dresses to, when they have\nbeen going out visiting. Law, my dear; they take them, many of them,\nfrom us old maids, almost as if we were only paying our debts in\ngiving them.\" And then Miss Anne gave her a cloth cloak, very warm,\nwith pretty buttons and gimp trimmings,--just such a cloak as any\ngirl might like to wear who thought that she would be seen out\nwalking by her Major Grantly on a Christmas morning. Grace Crawley\ndid not expect to be seen out walking by her Major Grantly, but\nnevertheless she liked the cloak. By the power of her practical will,\nand by her true sympathy, the elder Miss Prettyman had for a while\nconquered the annoyance which, on Grace's part, was attached to the\nreceiving of gifts, by the consciousness of her poverty; and when\nMiss Anne, with some pride in the tone of her voice, expressed a\nhope that Grace would think the cloak pretty, Grace put her arms\npleasantly round her friend's neck, and declared that it was very\npretty,--the prettiest cloak in all the world!\n\nGrace was met at the Guestwick railway-station by her friend Lilian\nDale, and was driven over to Allington in a pony carriage belonging\nto Lilian's uncle, the squire of the parish. I think she will be\nexcused in having put on her new cloak, not so much because of the\ncold as with a view of making the best of herself before Mrs. Dale.\nAnd yet she knew that Mrs. Dale would know all the circumstances of\nher poverty, and was very glad that it should be so. \"I am so glad\nthat you have come, dear,\" said Lily. \"It will be such a comfort.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are very good,\" said Grace.\n\n\"And mamma is so glad. From the moment that we both talked ourselves\ninto eagerness about it,--while I was writing my letter, you know, we\nresolved that it must be so.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I shall be a great trouble to Mrs. Dale.\"\n\n\"A trouble to mamma! Indeed you will not. You shall be a trouble to\nno one but me. I will have all the trouble myself, and the labour I\ndelight in shall physic my pain.\"\n\nGrace Crawley could not during the journey be at home and at ease\neven with her friend Lily. She was going to a strange house under\nstrange circumstances. Her father had not indeed been tried and found\nguilty of theft, but the charge of theft had been made against him,\nand the magistrates before whom it had been made had thought that the\ncharge was true. Grace knew that all the local newspapers had told\nthe story, and was of course aware that Mrs. Dale would have heard\nit. Her own mind was full of it, and though she dreaded to speak of\nit, yet she could not be silent. Miss Dale, who understood much of\nthis, endeavoured to talk her friend into easiness; but she feared to\nbegin upon the one subject, and before the drive was over they were,\nboth of them, too cold for much conversation. \"There's mamma,\" said\nMiss Dale as they drove up, turning out of the street of the village\nto the door of Mrs. Dale's house. \"She always knows, by instinct,\nwhen I am coming. You must understand now that you are among us,\nthat mamma and I are not mother and daughter, but two loving old\nladies, living together in peace and harmony. We do have our\nquarrels,--whether the chicken shall be roast or boiled, but never\nanything beyond that. Mamma, here is Grace, starved to death; and she\nsays if you don't give her some tea she will go back at once.\"\n\n\"I will give her some tea,\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\"And I am worse than she is, because I've been driving. It's all up\nwith Bernard and Mr. Green for the next week at least. It is freezing\nas hard as it can freeze, and they might as well try to hunt in\nLapland as here.\"\n\n\"They'll console themselves with skating,\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\"Have you ever observed, Grace,\" said Miss Dale, \"how much amusement\ngentlemen require, and how imperative it is that some other game\nshould be provided when one game fails?\"\n\n\"Not particularly,\" said Grace.\n\n\"Oh, but it is so. Now, with women, it is supposed that they can\namuse themselves or live without amusement. Once or twice in a year,\nperhaps something is done for them. There is an arrow-shooting\nparty, or a ball, or a picnic. But the catering for men's sport is\nnever-ending, and is always paramount to everything else. And yet the\npet game of the day never goes off properly. In partridge time, the\npartridges are wild, and won't come to be killed. In hunting time\nthe foxes won't run straight,--the wretches. They show no spirit,\nand will take to ground to save their brushes. Then comes a nipping\nfrost, and skating is proclaimed; but the ice is always rough, and\nthe woodcocks have deserted the country. And as for salmon,--when the\nsummer comes round I do really believe that they suffer a great deal\nabout the salmon. I'm sure they never catch any. So they go back to\ntheir clubs and their cards, and their billiards, and abuse their\ncooks and blackball their friends. That's about it, mamma; is it\nnot?\"\n\n\"You know more about it than I do, my dear.\"\n\n\"Because I have to listen to Bernard, as you never will do. We've got\nsuch a Mr. Green down here, Grace. He's such a duck of a man,--such\ntop-boots and all the rest of it. And yet they whisper to me that\nhe doesn't ride always to hounds. And to see him play billiards\nis beautiful, only he never can make a stroke. I hope you play\nbilliards, Grace, because uncle Christopher has just had a new table\nput up.\"\n\n\"I never saw a billiard-table yet,\" said Grace.\n\n\"Then Mr. Green shall teach you. He'll do anything that you ask him.\nIf you don't approve the colour of the ball, he'll go to London to\nget you another one. Only you must be very careful about saying that\nyou like anything before him, as he'll be sure to have it for you\nthe next day. Mamma happened to say that she wanted a four-penny\npostage-stamp, and he walked off to Guestwick to get it for her\ninstantly, although it was lunch-time.\"\n\n\"He did nothing of the kind, Lily,\" said her mother. \"He was going\nto Guestwick, and was very good-natured, and brought me back a\npostage-stamp that I wanted.\"\n\n\"Of course he's good-natured, I know that. And there's my cousin\nBernard. He's Captain Dale, you know. But he prefers to be called Mr.\nDale, because he has left the army, and has set up as junior squire\nof the parish. Uncle Christopher is the real squire; only Bernard\ndoes all the work. And now you know all about us. I'm afraid you'll\nfind us dull enough,--unless you can take a fancy to Mr. Green.\"\n\n\"Does Mr. Green live here?\" asked Grace.\n\n\"No; he does not live here. I never heard of his living anywhere. He\nwas something once, but I don't know what; and I don't think he's\nanything now in particular. But he's Bernard's friend, and like most\nmen, as one sees them, he never has much to do. Does Major Grantly\never go forth to fight his country's battles?\" This last question she\nasked in a low whisper, so that the words did not reach her mother.\nGrace blushed up to her eyes, however, as she answered,--\n\n\"I think that Major Grantly has left the army.\"\n\n\"We shall get her round in a day or two, mamma,\" said Lily Dale to\nher mother that night. \"I'm sure it will be the best thing to force\nher to talk of her troubles.\"\n\n\"I would not use too much force, my dear.\"\n\n\"Things are better when they're talked about. I'm sure they are. And\nit will be good to make her accustomed to speak of Major Grantly.\nFrom what Mary Walker tells me, he certainly means it. And if so, she\nshould be ready for it when it comes.\"\n\n\"Do not make her ready for what may never come.\"\n\n\"No, mamma; but she is at present such a child that she knows nothing\nof her own powers. She should be made to understand that it is\npossible that even a Major Grantly may think himself fortunate in\nbeing allowed to love her.\"\n\n\"I should leave all that to Nature, if I were you,\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nDINNER AT FRAMLEY COURT.\n\n\nLord Lufton, as he drove home to Framley after the meeting of\nthe magistrates at Silverbridge, discussed the matter with his\nbrother-in-law, Mark Robarts, the clergyman. Lord Lufton was driving\na dog-cart, and went along the road at the rate of twelve miles\nan hour. \"I'll tell you what it is, Mark,\" he said, \"that man is\ninnocent; but if he won't employ lawyers at his trial, the jury will\nfind him guilty.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think about it,\" said the clergyman.\n\n\"Were you in the room when he protested so vehemently that he didn't\nknow where he got the money?\"\n\n\"I was in the room all the time.\"\n\n\"And did you not believe him when he said that?\"\n\n\"Yes,--I think I did.\"\n\n\"Anybody must have believed him,--except old Tempest, who never\nbelieves anybody, and Fothergill, who always suspects everybody. The\ntruth is, that he had found the cheque and put it by, and did not\nremember anything about it.\"\n\n\"But, Lufton, surely that would amount to stealing it.\"\n\n\"Yes, if it wasn't that he is such a poor, cracked, crazy creature,\nwith his mind all abroad. I think Soames did drop his book in\nhis house. I'm sure Soames would not say so unless he was quite\nconfident. Somebody has picked it up, and in some way the cheque has\ngot into Crawley's hand. Then he has locked it up and has forgotten\nall about it; and when that butcher threatened him, he has put his\nhand upon it, and he has thought, or believed, that it had come from\nSoames or from the dean, or from heaven, if you will. When a man is\nso crazy as that, you can't judge of him as you do of others.\"\n\n\"But a jury must judge of him as it would of others.\"\n\n\"And therefore there should be a lawyer to tell the jury what to do.\nThey should have somebody up out of the parish to show that he is\nbeside himself half his time. His wife would be the best person, only\nit would be hard lines on her.\"\n\n\"Very hard. And after all he would only escape by being shown to be\nmad.\"\n\n\"And he is mad.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Proudie would come upon him in such a case as that, and\nsequester his living.\"\n\n\"And what will Mrs. Proudie do when he's a convicted thief? Simply\nunfrock him, and take away his living altogether. Nothing on earth\nshould induce me to find him guilty if I were on a jury.\"\n\n\"But you have committed him.\"\n\n\"Yes,--I've been one, at least, in doing so. I simply did that which\nWalker told us we must do. A magistrate is not left to himself as a\njuryman is. I'd eat the biggest pair of boots in Barchester before I\nfound him guilty. I say, Mark, you must talk it over with the women,\nand see what can be done for them. Lucy tells me that they're so\npoor, that if they have bread to eat, it's as much as they have.\"\n\nOn this evening Archdeacon Grantly and his wife dined and slept at\nFramley Court, there having been a very long family friendship\nbetween old Lady Lufton and the Grantlys, and Dr. Thorne with his\nwife, from Chaldicotes, also dined at Framley. There was also there\nanother clergyman from Barchester, Mr. Champion, one of the prebends\nof the cathedral. There were only three now who had houses in the\ncity since the retrenchments of the ecclesiastical commission had\ncome into full force. And this Mr. Champion was dear to the Dowager\nLady Lufton, because he carried on worthily the clerical war against\nthe bishop which had raged in Barsetshire ever since Dr. Proudie had\ncome there,--which war old Lady Lufton, good and pious and charitable\nas she was, considered that she was bound to keep up, even to the\nknife, till Dr. Proudie and all his satellites should have been\nbanished into outer darkness. As the light of the Proudies still\nshone brightly, it was probable that poor old Lady Lufton might die\nbefore her battle was accomplished. She often said that it would be\nso, but when so saying, always expressed a wish that the fight might\nbe carried on after her death. \"I shall never, never rest in my\ngrave,\" she had once said to the archdeacon, \"while that woman sits\nin your father's palace.\" For the archdeacon's father had been Bishop\nof Barchester before Dr. Proudie. What mode of getting rid of the\nbishop or his wife Lady Lufton proposed to herself, I am unable to\nsay; but I think she lived in hopes that in some way it might be\ndone. If only the bishop could have been found to have stolen a\ncheque for twenty pounds instead of poor Mr. Crawley, Lady Lufton\nwould, I think, have been satisfied.\n\nIn the course of these battles Framley Court would sometimes assume a\nclerical aspect,--have a prevailing hue, as it were, of black coats,\nwhich was not altogether to the taste of Lord Lufton, and as to which\nhe would make complaint to his wife, and to Mark Robarts, himself a\nclergyman. \"There's more of this than I can stand,\" he'd say to the\nlatter. \"There's a deuced deal more of it than you like yourself, I\nknow.\"\n\n\"It's not for me to like or dislike. It's a great thing having your\nmother in the parish.\"\n\n\"That's all very well; and of course she'll do as she likes. She may\nask whom she pleases here, and I shan't interfere. It's the same as\nthough it was her own house. But I shall take Lucy to Lufton.\" Now\nLord Lufton had been building his house at Lufton for the last seven\nyears, and it was not yet finished,--or nearly finished, if all that\nhis wife and mother said was true. And if they could have their\nway, it never would be finished. And so, in order that Lord Lufton\nmight not be actually driven away by the turmoils of ecclesiastical\ncontest, the younger Lady Lufton would endeavour to moderate both the\nwrath and the zeal of the elder one, and would struggle against the\ncoming clergymen. On this day, however, three sat at the board at\nFramley, and Lady Lufton, in her justification to her son, swore that\nthe invitation had been given by her daughter-in-law. \"You know, my\ndear,\" the dowager said to Lord Lufton, \"something must be done for\nthese poor Crawleys; and as the dean is away, Lucy wants to speak to\nthe archdeacon about them.\"\n\n\"And the archdeacon could not subscribe his ten-pound note without\nhaving Mr. Champion to back him?\"\n\n\"My dear Ludovic, you do put it in such a way.\"\n\n\"Never mind, mother. I've no special dislike to Champion; only as you\nare not paid five thousand a year for your trouble, it is rather hard\nthat you should have to do all the work of opposition bishop in the\ndiocese.\"\n\nIt was felt by them all,--including Lord Lufton himself, who became\nso interested in the matter as to forgive the black coats before the\nevening was over,--that this matter of Mr. Crawley's committal was\nvery serious, and demanded the full energies of their party. It was\nknown to them all that the feeling at the palace was inimical to Mr.\nCrawley. \"That she-Beelzebub hates him for his poverty, and because\nArabin brought him into the diocese,\" said the archdeacon, permitting\nhimself to use very strong language in his allusion to the bishop's\nwife. It must be recorded on his behalf that he used the phrase in\nthe presence only of the gentlemen of the party. I think he might\nhave whispered the word into the ear of his confidential friend old\nLady Lufton, and perhaps have given no offence; but he would not have\nventured to use such words aloud in the presence of ladies.\n\n\"You forget, archdeacon,\" said Dr. Thorne, laughing, \"that the\nshe-Beelzebub is my wife's particular friend.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said the archdeacon. \"Your wife knows better than\nthat. You tell her what I call her, and if she complains of the name,\nI'll unsay it.\" It may therefore be supposed that Dr. Thorne, and\nMrs. Thorne, and the archdeacon, knew each other intimately, and\nunderstood each other's feelings on these matters.\n\nIt was quite true that the palace party was inimical to Mr. Crawley.\nMr. Crawley undoubtedly was poor, and had not been so submissive to\nepiscopal authority as it behoves any clergyman to be whose loaves\nand fishes are scanty. He had raised his back more than once against\norders emanating from the palace in a manner that had made the hairs\non the head of the bishop's wife to stand almost on end, and had\ntaken as much upon himself as though his living had been worth twelve\nhundred a year. Mrs. Proudie, almost as energetic in her language as\nthe archdeacon, had called him a beggarly perpetual curate. \"We must\nhave perpetual curates, my dear,\" the bishop had said. \"They should\nknow their places then. But what can you expect of a creature from\nthe deanery? All that ought to be altered. The dean should have no\npatronage in the diocese. No dean should have any patronage. It is\nan abuse from the beginning to the end. Dean Arabin, if he had any\nconscience, would be doing the duty at Hogglestock himself.\" How the\nbishop strove to teach his wife, with mildest words, what really\nought to be a dean's duty, and how the wife rejoined by teaching her\nhusband, not in the mildest words, what ought to be a bishop's duty,\nwe will not further inquire here. The fact that such dialogues took\nplace at the palace is recorded simply to show that the palatial\nfeeling in Barchester ran counter to Mr. Crawley.\n\nAnd this was cause enough, if no other cause existed, for partiality\nto Mr. Crawley at Framley Court. But, as has been partly explained,\nthere existed, if possible, even stronger ground than this for\nadherence to the Crawley cause. The younger Lady Lufton had known\nthe Crawleys intimately, and the elder Lady Lufton had reckoned them\namong the neighbouring clerical families of her acquaintance. Both\nthese ladies were therefore staunch in their defence of Mr. Crawley.\nThe archdeacon himself had his own reasons,--reasons which for the\npresent he kept altogether within his own bosom,--for wishing that\nMr. Crawley had never entered the diocese. Whether the perpetual\ncurate should or should not be declared to be a thief, it would be\nterrible to him to have to call the child of that perpetual curate\nhis daughter-in-law. But not the less on this occasion was he true to\nhis order, true to his side in the diocese, true to his hatred of the\npalace.\n\n\"I don't believe it for a moment,\" he said, as he took his place on\nthe rug before the fire in the drawing-room when the gentlemen came\nin from their wine. The ladies understood at once what it was that\nhe couldn't believe. Mr. Crawley had for the moment so usurped the\ncounty that nobody thought of talking of anything else.\n\n\"How is it, then,\" said Mrs. Thorne, \"that Lord Lufton, and my\nhusband, and the other wiseacres at Silverbridge, have committed him\nfor trial?\"\n\n\"Because we were told to do so by the lawyer,\" said Dr. Thorne.\n\n\"Ladies will never understand that magistrates must act in accordance\nwith the law,\" said Lord Lufton.\n\n\"But you all say he's not guilty,\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"The fact is, that the magistrates cannot try the question,\" said\nthe archdeacon; \"they only hear the primary evidence. In this case\nI don't believe Crawley would ever have been committed if he had\nemployed an attorney, instead of speaking for himself.\"\n\n\"Why didn't somebody make him have an attorney?\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"I don't think any attorney in the world could have spoken for him\nbetter than he spoke for himself,\" said Dr. Thorne.\n\n\"And yet you committed him,\" said his wife. \"What can we do for him?\nCan't we pay the bail, and send him off to America?\"\n\n\"A jury will never find him guilty,\" said Lord Lufton.\n\n\"And what is the truth of it?\" asked the younger Lady Lufton.\n\nThen the whole matter was discussed again, and it was settled among\nthem all that Mr. Crawley had undoubtedly appropriated the cheque\nthrough temporary obliquity of judgment,--obliquity of judgment and\nforgetfulness as to the source from whence the cheque had come to\nhim. \"He has picked it up about the house, and then has thought that\nit was his own,\" said Lord Lufton. Had they come to the conclusion\nthat such an appropriation of money had been made by one of the\nclergy of the palace, by one of the Proudeian party, they would\ndoubtless have been very loud and very bitter as to the iniquity\nof the offender. They would have said much as to the weakness of\nthe bishop and the wickedness of the bishop's wife, and would have\ndeclared the appropriator to have been as very a thief as ever\npicked a pocket or opened a till;--but they were unanimous in their\nacquittal of Mr. Crawley. It had not been his intention, they said,\nto be a thief, and a man should be judged only by his intention. It\nmust now be their object to induce a Barchester jury to look at the\nmatter in the same light.\n\n\"When they come to understand how the land lies,\" said the\narchdeacon, \"they will be all right. There's not a tradesman in the\ncity who does not hate that woman as though she were--\"\n\n\"Archdeacon,\" said his wife, cautioning him to repress his energy.\n\n\"Their bills are all paid by this new chaplain they've got, and he is\nmade to claim discount on every leg of mutton,\" said the archdeacon.\nArguing from which fact,--or from which assertion, he came to the\nconclusion that no Barchester jury would find Mr. Crawley guilty.\n\nBut it was agreed on all sides that it would not be well to trust to\nthe unassisted friendship of the Barchester tradesmen. Mr. Crawley\nmust be provided with legal assistance, and this must be furnished\nto him whether he should be willing or unwilling to receive it. That\nthere would be a difficulty was acknowledged. Mr. Crawley was known\nto be a man not easy of persuasion, with a will of his own, with\na great energy of obstinacy on points which he chose to take up\nas being of importance to his calling, or to his own professional\nstatus. He had pleaded his own cause before the magistrates, and it\nmight be that he would insist on doing the same thing before the\njudge. At last Mr. Robarts, the clergyman of Framley, was deputed\nfrom the knot of Crawleian advocates assembled in Lady Lufton's\ndrawing-room, to undertake the duty of seeing Mr. Crawley, and of\nexplaining to him that his proper defence was regarded as a matter\nappertaining to the clergy and gentry generally of that part of the\ncountry, and that for the sake of the clergy and gentry the defence\nmust of course be properly conducted. In such circumstances the\nexpense of the defence would of course be borne by the clergy and\ngentry concerned. It was thought that Mr. Robarts could put the\nmatter to Mr. Crawley with such a mixture of the strength of manly\nfriendship and the softness of clerical persuasion, as to overcome\nthe recognized difficulties of the task.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTHE BISHOP SENDS HIS INHIBITION.\n\n\nTidings of Mr. Crawley's fate reached the palace at Barchester on the\nafternoon of the day on which the magistrates had committed him. All\nsuch tidings travel very quickly, conveyed by imperceptible wires,\nand distributed by indefatigable message boys whom Rumour seems to\nsupply for the purpose. Barchester is twenty miles from Silverbridge\nby road, and more than forty by railway. I doubt whether any one was\ncommissioned to send the news along the actual telegraph, and yet\nMrs. Proudie knew it before four o'clock. But she did not know it\nquite accurately. \"Bishop,\" she said, standing at her husband's study\ndoor. \"They have committed that man to gaol. There was no help for\nthem unless they had forsworn themselves.\"\n\n\"Not forsworn themselves, my dear,\" said the bishop, striving, as was\nusual with him, by some meek and ineffectual word to teach his wife\nthat she was occasionally led by her energy into error. He never\npersisted in the lessons when he found, as was usual, that they were\ntaken amiss.\n\n\"I say forsworn themselves!\" said Mrs. Proudie; \"and now what do\nyou mean to do? This is Thursday, and of course the man must not be\nallowed to desecrate the church of Hogglestock by performing the\nSunday services.\"\n\n\"If he has been committed, my dear, and is in prison,--\"\n\n\"I said nothing about prison, bishop.\"\n\n\"Gaol, my dear.\"\n\n\"I say they have committed him to gaol. So my informant tells me.\nBut of course all the Plumstead and Framley set will move heaven and\nearth to get him out, so that he may be there as a disgrace to the\ndiocese. I wonder how the dean will feel when he hears of it! I do,\nindeed. For the dean, though he is an idle, useless man, with no\nchurch principles, and no real piety, still he has a conscience. I\nthink he has a conscience.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he has, my dear.\"\n\n\"Well;--let us hope so. And if he has a conscience, what must be his\nfeelings when he hears that this creature whom he brought into the\ndiocese has been committed to gaol along with common felons.\"\n\n\"Not with felons, my dear; at least, I should think not.\"\n\n\"I say with common felons! A downright robbery of twenty pounds,\njust as though he had broken into the bank! And so he did, with\nsly artifice, which is worse in such hands than a crowbar. And now\nwhat are we to do? Here is Thursday, and something must be done\nbefore Sunday for the souls of those poor benighted creatures at\nHogglestock.\" Mrs. Proudie was ready for the battle, and was even\nnow sniffing the blood afar-off. \"I believe it's a hundred and\nthirty pounds a year,\" she said, before the bishop had collected his\nthoughts sufficiently for a reply.\n\n\"I think we must find out, first of all, whether he is really to be\nshut up in prison,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"And suppose he is not to be shut up. Suppose they have been weak,\nor untrue to their duty--and from what we know of the magistrates of\nBarsetshire, there is too much reason to suppose that they will have\nbeen so; suppose they have let him out, is he to go about like a\nroaring lion--among the souls of the people?\"\n\nThe bishop shook in his shoes. When Mrs. Proudie began to talk of the\nsouls of the people he always shook in his shoes. She had an eloquent\nway of raising her voice over the word souls that was qualified\nto make any ordinary man shake in his shoes. The bishop was a\nconscientious man, and well knew that poor Mr. Crawley, even though\nhe might have become a thief under terrible temptation, would\nnot roar at Hogglestock to the injury of any man's soul. He was\naware that this poor clergyman had done his duty laboriously and\nefficiently, and he was also aware that though he might have been\ncommitted by the magistrates, and then let out upon bail, he should\nnot be regarded now, in these days before his trial, as a convicted\nthief. But to explain all this to Mrs. Proudie was beyond his power.\nHe knew well that she would not hear a word in mitigation of Mr.\nCrawley's presumed offence. Mr. Crawley belonged to the other party,\nand Mrs. Proudie was a thorough-going partisan. I know a man,--an\nexcellent fellow, who, being himself a strong politician, constantly\nexpresses a belief that all politicians opposed to him are thieves,\nchild-murderers, parricides, lovers of incest, demons upon the\nearth. He is a strong partisan, but not, I think, so strong as Mrs.\nProudie. He says that he believes all evil of his opponents; but she\nreally believed the evil. The archdeacon had called Mrs. Proudie a\nshe-Beelzebub; but that was a simple ebullition of mortal hatred. He\nbelieved her to be simply a vulgar, interfering, brazen-faced virago.\nMrs. Proudie in truth believed that the archdeacon was an actual\nemanation from Satan, sent to those parts to devour souls,--as she\nwould call it,--and that she herself was an emanation of another\nsort, sent from another source expressly to Barchester, to prevent\nsuch devouring, as far as it might possibly be prevented by a mortal\nagency. The bishop knew it all,--understood it all. He regarded the\narchdeacon as a clergyman belonging to a party opposed to his party,\nand he disliked the man. He knew that from his first coming into the\ndiocese he had been encountered with enmity by the archdeacon and\nthe archdeacon's friends. If left to himself he could feel and to a\ncertain extent could resent such enmity. But he had no faith in his\nwife's doctrine of emanations. He had no faith in many things which\nshe believed religiously;--and yet what could he do? If he attempted\nto explain, she would stop him before he had got through the first\nhalf of his first sentence.\n\n\"If he is out on bail--,\" commenced the bishop.\n\n\"Of course he will be out on bail.\"\n\n\"Then I think he should feel--\"\n\n\"Feel! such men never feel! What feeling can one expect from a\nconvicted thief?\"\n\n\"Not convicted as yet, my dear,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"A convicted thief,\" repeated Mrs. Proudie; and she vociferated the\nwords in such a tone that the bishop resolved that he would for the\nfuture let the word convicted pass without notice. After all she was\nonly using the phrase in a peculiar sense given to it by herself.\n\n[Illustration: \"A convicted thief,\" repeated Mrs. Proudie.]\n\n\"It won't be proper, certainly, that he should do the services,\"\nsuggested the bishop.\n\n\"Proper! It would be a scandal to the whole diocese. How could he\nraise his head as he pronounced the eighth commandment? That must be\nat least prevented.\"\n\nThe bishop, who was seated, fretted himself in his chair, moving\nabout with little movements. He knew that there was a misery coming\nupon him; and, as far as he could see, it might become a great\nmisery,--a huge blistering sore upon him. When miseries came to him,\nas they did not unfrequently, he would unconsciously endeavour to\nfathom them and weigh them, and then, with some gallantry, resolve to\nbear them, if he could find that their depth and weight were not too\ngreat for his powers of endurance. He would let the cold wind whistle\nby him, putting up the collar of his coat, and would encounter the\nwinter weather without complaint. And he would be patient under the\nhot sun, knowing well that tranquillity is best for those who have to\nbear tropical heat. But when the storm threatened to knock him off\nhis legs, when the earth beneath him became too hot for his poor\ntender feet,--what could he do then? There had been with him such\nperiods of misery, during which he had wailed inwardly and had\nconfessed to himself that the wife of his bosom was too much for him.\nNow the storm seemed to be coming very roughly. It would be demanded\nof him that he should exercise certain episcopal authority which he\nknew did not belong to him. Now, episcopal authority admits of being\nstretched or contracted according to the character of the bishop who\nuses it. It is not always easy for a bishop himself to know what he\nmay do, and what he may not do. He may certainly give advice to any\nclergyman in his diocese, and he may give it in such form that it\nwill have in it something of authority. Such advice coming from a\ndominant bishop to a clergyman with a submissive mind, has in it very\nmuch of authority. But Bishop Proudie knew that Mr. Crawley was not a\nclergyman with a submissive mind, and he feared that he himself, as\nregarded from Mr. Crawley's point of view, was not a dominant bishop.\nAnd yet he could only act by advice. \"I will write to him,\" said\nthe bishop, \"and will explain to him that as he is circumstanced he\nshould not appear in the reading desk.\"\n\n\"Of course he must not appear in the reading desk. That scandal must\nat any rate be inhibited.\" Now the bishop did not at all like the use\nof the word inhibited, understanding well that Mrs. Proudie intended\nit to be understood as implying some episcopal command against which\nthere should be no appeal;--but he let it pass.\n\n\"I will write to him, my dear, to-night.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Thumble can go over with the letter the first thing in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Will not the post be better?\"\n\n\"No, bishop; certainly not.\"\n\n\"He would get it sooner, if I write to-night, my dear.\"\n\n\"In either case he will get it to-morrow morning. An hour or two will\nnot signify, and if Mr. Thumble takes it himself we shall know how it\nis received. It will be well that Thumble should be there in person\nas he will want to look for lodgings in the parish.\"\n\n\"But, my dear--\"\n\n\"Well, bishop?\"\n\n\"About lodgings? I hardly think that Mr. Thumble, if we decide that\nMr. Thumble shall undertake the duty--\"\n\n\"We have decided that Mr. Thumble should undertake the duty. That is\ndecided.\"\n\n\"But I do not think he should trouble himself to look for lodgings at\nHogglestock. He can go over on the Sundays.\"\n\n\"And who is to do the parish work? Would you have that man, a\nconvicted thief, to look after the schools, and visit the sick, and\nperhaps attend the dying?\"\n\n\"There will be a great difficulty; there will indeed,\" said the\nbishop, becoming very unhappy, and feeling that he was driven by\ncircumstances either to assert his own knowledge or teach his wife\nsomething of the law with reference to his position as a bishop. \"Who\nis to pay Mr. Thumble?\"\n\n\"The income of the parish must be sequestrated, and he must be paid\nout of that. Of course he must have the income while he does the\nwork.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, I cannot sequestrate the man's income.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it, bishop. If the bishop cannot sequestrate, who\ncan? But you are always timid in exercising the authority put into\nyour hands for wise purposes. Not sequestrate the income of a man\nwho has been proved to be a thief! You leave that to us, and we\nwill manage it.\" The \"us\" here named comprised Mrs. Proudie and the\nbishop's managing chaplain.\n\nThen the bishop was left alone for an hour to write the letter which\nMr. Thumble was to carry over to Mr. Crawley,--and after a while\nhe did write it. Before he commenced the task, however, he sat for\nsome moments in his arm-chair close by the fire-side, asking himself\nwhether it might not be possible for him to overcome his enemy in\nthis matter. How would it go with him suppose he were to leave the\nletter unwritten, and send in a message by his chaplain to Mrs.\nProudie, saying that as Mr. Crawley was out on bail, the parish might\nbe left for the present without episcopal interference? She could not\nmake him interfere. She could not force him to write the letter. So,\nat least, he said to himself. But as he said it, he almost thought\nthat she could do these things. In the last thirty years, or more,\nshe had ever contrived by some power latent in her to have her will\neffected. But what would happen if now, even now, he were to rebel?\nThat he would personally become very uncomfortable, he was well\naware, but he thought that he could bear that. The food would become\nbad,--mere ashes between his teeth, the daily modicum of wine would\nlose its flavour, the chimneys would all smoke, the wind would come\nfrom the east, and the servants would not answer the bell. Little\nmiseries of that kind would crowd upon him. He had arrived at a time\nof life in which such miseries make such men very miserable; but yet\nhe thought that he could endure them. And what other wretchedness\nwould come to him? She would scold him,--frightfully, loudly,\nscornfully, and worse than all, continually. But of this he had so\nmuch habitually, that anything added might be borne also;--if only he\ncould be sure that the scoldings should go on in private, that the\nworld of the palace should not be allowed to hear the revilings to\nwhich he would be subjected. But to be scolded publicly was the great\nevil which he dreaded beyond all evils. He was well aware that the\npalace would know his misfortune, that it was known, and freely\ndiscussed by all, from the examining chaplain down to the palace\nboot-boy;--nay, that it was known to all the diocese; but yet he\ncould smile upon those around him, and look as though he held his\nown like other men,--unless when open violence was displayed. But\nwhen that voice was heard aloud along the corridors of the palace,\nand when he was summoned imperiously by the woman, calling for her\nbishop, so that all Barchester heard it, and when he was compelled\nto creep forth from his study, at the sound of that summons, with\ndistressed face, and shaking hands, and short hurrying steps,--a\nbeing to be pitied even by a deacon,--not venturing to assume\nan air of masterdom should he chance to meet a housemaid on the\nstairs,--then, at such moments as that, he would feel that any\nsubmission was better than the misery which he suffered. And he well\nknew that should he now rebel, the whole house would be in a turmoil.\nHe would be bishoped here, and bishoped there, before the eyes of all\npalatial men and women, till life would be a burden to him. So he got\nup from his seat over the fire, and went to his desk and wrote the\nletter. The letter was as follows:--\n\n\n   The Palace, Barchester, -- December, 186--.\n\n   REVEREND SIR,--[he left out the dear, because he knew\n   that if he inserted it he would be compelled to write the\n   letter over again]\n\n   I have heard to-day with the greatest trouble of spirit,\n   that you have been taken before a bench of magistrates\n   assembled at Silverbridge, having been previously arrested\n   by the police in your parsonage house at Hogglestock, and\n   that the magistrates of Silverbridge have committed you to\n   take your trial at the next assizes at Barchester, on a\n   charge of theft.\n\n   Far be it from me to prejudge the case. You will\n   understand, reverend sir, that I express no opinion\n   whatever as to your guilt or innocence in this matter.\n   If you have been guilty, may the Lord give you grace to\n   repent of your great sin and to make such amends as may\n   come from immediate acknowledgment and confession. If you\n   are innocent, may He protect you, and make your innocence\n   to shine before all men. In either case may the Lord be\n   with you and keep your feet from further stumbling.\n\n   But I write to you now as your bishop, to explain to you\n   that circumstanced as you are, you cannot with decency\n   perform the church services of your parish. I have that\n   confidence in you that I doubt not you will agree with\n   me in this, and will be grateful to me for relieving you\n   so far from the immediate perplexities of your position.\n   I have, therefore, appointed the Rev. Caleb Thumble to\n   perform the duties of incumbent of Hogglestock till such\n   time as a jury shall have decided upon your case at\n   Barchester; and in order that you may at once become\n   acquainted with Mr. Thumble, as will be most convenient\n   that you should do, I will commission him to deliver this\n   letter into your hand personally to-morrow, trusting that\n   you will receive him with that brotherly spirit in which\n   he is sent upon this painful mission.\n\n   Touching the remuneration to which Mr. Thumble will become\n   entitled for his temporary ministrations in the parish\n   of Hogglestock, I do not at present lay down any strict\n   injunction. He must, at any rate, be paid at a rate not\n   less than that ordinarily afforded for a curate.\n\n   I will once again express my fervent hope that the Lord\n   may bring you to see the true state of your own soul, and\n   that He may fill you with the grace of repentance, so that\n   the bitter waters of the present hour may not pass over\n   your head and destroy you.\n\n   I have the honour to be,\n   Reverend Sir,\n   Your faithful servant in Christ,\n\n   T. BARNUM.*\n\n   *Baronum Castrum having been the old Roman name from which\n   the modern Barchester is derived, the bishops of the\n   diocese have always signed themselves Barnum.\n\n\nThe bishop had hardly finished his letter when Mrs. Proudie returned\nto the study, followed by the Rev. Caleb Thumble. Mr. Thumble was a\nlittle man, about forty years of age, who had a wife and children\nliving in Barchester, and who existed on such chance clerical crumbs\nas might fall from the table of the bishop's patronage. People in\nBarchester said that Mrs. Thumble was a cousin of Mrs. Proudie's; but\nas Mrs. Proudie stoutly denied the connection, it may be supposed\nthat the people of Barchester were wrong. And, had Mr. Thumble's wife\nin truth been a cousin, Mrs. Proudie would surely have provided for\nhim during the many years in which the diocese had been in her hands.\nNo such provision had been made, and Mr. Thumble, who had now been\nliving in the diocese for three years, had received nothing else from\nthe bishop than such chance employment as this which he was now to\nundertake at Hogglestock. He was a humble, mild-voiced man, when\nwithin the palace precincts, and had so far succeeded in making\nhis way among his brethren in the cathedral city as to be employed\nnot unfrequently for absent minor canons in chanting the week-day\nservices, being remunerated for his work at the rate of about two\nshillings and sixpence a service.\n\nThe bishop handed his letter to his wife, observing in an off-hand\nkind of way that she might as well see what he said. \"Of course I\nshall read it,\" said Mrs. Proudie. And the bishop winced visibly,\nbecause Mr. Thumble was present. \"Quite right,\" said Mrs. Proudie,\n\"quite right to let him know that you knew that he had been\narrested,--actually arrested by the police.\"\n\n\"I thought it proper to mention that, because of the scandal,\" said\nthe bishop.\n\n\"Oh, it has been terrible in the city,\" said Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"Never mind, Mr. Thumble,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"Never mind that at\npresent.\" Then she continued to read the letter. \"What's this?\nConfession! That must come out, bishop. It will never do that you\nshould recommend confession to anybody, under any circumstances.\"\n\n\"But, my dear--\"\n\n\"It must come out, bishop.\"\n\n\"My lord has not meant auricular confession,\" suggested Mr. Thumble.\nThen Mrs. Proudie turned round and looked at Mr. Thumble, and Mr.\nThumble nearly sank amidst the tables and chairs. \"I beg your pardon,\nMrs. Proudie,\" he said. \"I didn't mean to intrude.\"\n\n\"The word must come out, bishop,\" repeated Mrs. Proudie. \"There\nshould be no stumbling-blocks prepared for feet that are only too\nready to fall.\" And the word did come out.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Thumble,\" said the lady, as she gave the letter to her\nsatellite, \"the bishop and I wish you to be at Hogglestock early\nto-morrow. You should be there not later than ten, certainly.\" Then\nshe paused until Mr. Thumble had given the required promise. \"And we\nrequest that you will be very firm in the mission which is confided\nto you, a mission which, as of course you see, is of a very delicate\nand important nature. You must be firm.\"\n\n\"I will endeavour,\" said Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"The bishop and I both feel that this most unfortunate man must not\nunder any circumstances be allowed to perform the services of the\nChurch while this charge is hanging over him,--a charge as to the\ntruth of which no sane man can entertain a doubt.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Mrs. Proudie,\" said Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"The bishop and I therefore are most anxious that you should make Mr.\nCrawley understand at once,--at once,\" and the lady, as she spoke,\nlifted up her left hand with an eloquent violence which had its\neffect upon Mr. Thumble, \"that he is inhibited,\"--the bishop shook\nin his shoes,--\"inhibited from the performance of any of his sacred\nduties.\" Thereupon, Mr. Thumble promised obedience and went his way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nMR. CRAWLEY SEEKS FOR SYMPATHY.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMatters went very badly indeed in the parsonage house at Hogglestock.\nOn the Friday morning, the morning of the day after his committal,\nMr. Crawley got up very early, long before the daylight, and dressing\nhimself in the dark, groped his way downstairs. His wife having\nvainly striven to persuade him to remain where he was, followed\nhim into the cold room below with a lighted candle. She found him\nstanding with his hat on and with his old cloak, as though he were\nprepared to go out. \"Why do you do this?\" she said. \"You will make\nyourself ill with the cold and the night air; and then you, and I\ntoo, will be worse than we now are.\"\n\n\"We cannot be worse. You cannot be worse, and for me it does not\nsignify. Let me pass.\"\n\n\"I will not let you pass, Josiah. Be a man and bear it. Ask God for\nstrength, instead of seeking it in an over-indulgence of your own\nsorrow.\"\n\n\"Indulgence!\"\n\n\"Yes, love;--indulgence. It is indulgence. You will allow your mind\nto dwell on nothing for a moment but your own wrongs.\"\n\n\"What else have I that I can think of? Is not all the world against\nme?\"\n\n\"Am I against you?\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think you are. When you accuse me of self-indulgence you\nare against me,--me, who for myself have desired nothing but to be\nallowed to do my duty, and to have bread enough to keep me alive, and\nclothes enough to make me decent.\"\n\n\"Is it not self-indulgence, this giving way to grief? Who would know\nso well as you how to teach the lesson of endurance to others? Come,\nlove. Lay down your hat. It cannot be fitting that you should go out\ninto the wet and cold of the raw morning.\"\n\nFor a moment he hesitated, but as she raised her hand to take his\ncloak from him he drew back from her, and would not permit it. \"I\nshall find those up whom I want to see,\" he said. \"I must visit my\nflock, and I dare not go through the parish by daylight lest they\nhoot after me as a thief.\"\n\n\"Not one in Hogglestock would say a word to insult you.\"\n\n\"Would they not? The very children in the school whisper at me. Let\nme pass, I say. It has not as yet come to that, that I should be\nstopped in my egress and ingress. They have--bailed me; and while\ntheir bail lasts, I may go where I will.\"\n\n\"Oh, Josiah, what words to me! Have I ever stopped your liberty?\nWould I not give my life to secure it?\"\n\n\"Let me go, then, now. I tell you that I have business in hand.\"\n\n\"But I will go with you? I will be ready in an instant.\"\n\n\"You go! Why should you go? Are there not the children for you to\nmind?\"\n\n\"There is only Jane.\"\n\n\"Stay with her, then. Why should you go about the parish?\" She\nstill held him by the cloak, and looked anxiously up into his face.\n\"Woman,\" he said, raising his voice, \"what is it that you dread? I\ncommand you to tell me what is it that you fear?\" He had now taken\nhold of her by the shoulder, slightly thrusting her from him, so that\nhe might see her face by the dim light of the single candle. \"Speak,\nI say. What is that you think that I shall do?\"\n\n\"Dearest, I know that you will be better at home, better with me,\nthan you can be on such a morning as this out in the cold damp air.\"\n\n\"And is that all?\" He looked hard at her, while she returned his gaze\nwith beseeching loving eyes. \"Is there nothing behind, that you will\nnot tell me?\"\n\nShe paused for a moment before she replied. She had never lied to\nhim. She could not lie to him. \"I wish you knew my heart towards\nyou,\" she said, \"with all and everything in it.\"\n\n\"I know your heart well, but I want to know your mind. Why would you\npersuade me not to go out among my poor?\"\n\n\"Because it will be bad for you to be out alone in the dark lanes, in\nthe mud and wet, thinking of your sorrow. You will brood over it till\nyou will lose your senses through the intensity of your grief. You\nwill stand out in the cold air, forgetful of everything around you,\ntill your limbs will be numbed, and your blood chilled,--\"\n\n\"And then--?\"\n\n\"Oh, Josiah, do not hold me like that, and look at me so angrily.\"\n\n\"And even then I will bear my burden till the Lord in His mercy shall\nsee fit to relieve me. Even then I will endure, though a bare bodkin\nor a leaf of hemlock would put an end to it. Let me pass on; you need\nfear nothing.\"\n\nShe did let him pass without another word, and he went out of the\nhouse, shutting the door after him noiselessly, and closing the\nwicket-gate of the garden. For a while she sat herself down on the\nnearest chair, and tried to make up her mind how she might best treat\nhim in his present state of mind. As regarded the present morning\nher heart was at ease. She knew that he would do now nothing of that\nwhich she had apprehended. She could trust him not to be false in\nhis word to her, though she could not before have trusted him not\nto commit so much heavier a sin. If he would really employ himself\nfrom morning till night among the poor, he would be better so,--his\ntrouble would be easier of endurance,--than with any other employment\nwhich he could adopt. What she most dreaded was that he should sit\nidle over the fire and do nothing. When he was so seated she could\nread his mind, as though it was open to her as a book. She had been\nquite right when she had accused him of over-indulgence in his grief.\nHe did give way to it till it became a luxury to him,--a luxury which\nshe would not have had the heart to deny him, had she not felt it\nto be of all luxuries the most pernicious. During these long hours,\nin which he would sit speechless, doing nothing, he was telling\nhimself from minute to minute that of all God's creatures he was\nthe most heavily afflicted, and was revelling in the sense of the\ninjustice done to him. He was recalling all the facts of his life,\nhis education, which had been costly, and, as regarded knowledge,\nsuccessful; his vocation to the church, when in his youth he\nhad determined to devote himself to the service of his Saviour,\ndisregarding promotion or the favour of men; the short, sweet days\nof his early love, in which he had devoted himself again,--thinking\nnothing of self, but everything of her; his diligent working, in\nwhich he had ever done his very utmost for the parish in which he was\nplaced, and always his best for the poorest; the success of other\nmen who had been his compeers, and, as he too often told himself,\nintellectually his inferiors; then of his children, who had been\ncarried off from his love to the churchyard,--over whose graves he\nhimself had stood, reading out the pathetic words of the funeral\nservice with unswerving voice and a bleeding heart; and then of his\nchildren still living, who loved their mother so much better than\nthey loved him. And he would recall all the circumstances of his\npoverty,--how he had been driven to accept alms, to fly from\ncreditors, to hide himself, to see his chairs and tables seized\nbefore the eyes of those over whom he had been set as their spiritual\npastor. And in it all, I think, there was nothing so bitter to the\nman as the derogation from the spiritual grandeur of his position\nas priest among men, which came as one necessary result from his\npoverty. St. Paul could go forth without money in his purse or shoes\nto his feet or two suits to his back, and his poverty never stood in\nthe way of his preaching, or hindered the veneration of the faithful.\nSt. Paul, indeed, was called upon to bear stripes, was flung into\nprison, encountered terrible dangers. But Mr. Crawley,--so he told\nhimself,--could have encountered all that without flinching. The\nstripes and scorn of the unfaithful would have been nothing to him,\nif only the faithful would have believed in him, poor as he was, as\nthey would have believed in him had he been rich! Even they whom he\nhad most loved treated him almost with derision, because he was now\ndifferent from them. Dean Arabin had laughed at him because he had\npersisted in walking ten miles through the mud instead of being\nconveyed in the dean's carriage; and yet, after that, he had been\ndriven to accept the dean's charity! No one respected him. No one!\nHis very wife thought that he was a lunatic. And now he had been\npublicly branded as a thief; and in all likelihood would end his\ndays in a gaol! Such were always his thoughts as he sat idle, silent,\nmoody, over the fire; and his wife well knew their currents. It would\ncertainly be better that he should drive himself to some employment,\nif any employment could be found possible to him.\n\nWhen she had been alone for a few minutes, Mrs. Crawley got up from\nher chair, and going into the kitchen, lighted the fire there, and\nput the kettle over it, and began to prepare such breakfast for\nher husband as the means in the house afforded. Then she called\nthe sleeping servant-girl, who was little more than a child, and\nwent into her own girl's room, and then she got into bed with her\ndaughter.\n\n\"I have been up with your papa, dear, and I am cold.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, poor mamma! Why is papa up so early?\"\n\n\"He has gone out to visit some of the brickmakers before they go to\ntheir work. It is better for him to be employed.\"\n\n\"But, mamma, it is pitch dark.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, it is still dark. Sleep again for a while, and I will\nsleep too. I think Grace will be here to-night, and then there will\nbe no room for me here.\"\n\nMr. Crawley went forth and made his way with rapid steps to a portion\nof his parish nearly two miles distant from his house, through which\nwas carried a canal, affording water communication in some intricate\nway both to London and Bristol. And on the brink of this canal there\nhad sprung up a colony of brickmakers, the nature of the earth in\nthose parts combining with the canal to make brickmaking a suitable\ntrade. The workmen there assembled were not, for the most part,\nnative-born Hogglestockians, or folk descended from Hogglestockian\nparents. They had come thither from unknown regions, as labourers of\nthat class do come when they are needed. Some young men from that and\nneighbouring parishes had joined themselves to the colony, allured by\nwages, and disregarding the menaces of the neighbouring farmers; but\nthey were all in appearance and manners nearer akin to the race of\nnavvies than to ordinary rural labourers. They had a bad name in the\ncountry; but it may be that their name was worse than their deserts.\nThe farmers hated them, and consequently they hated the farmers.\nThey had a beershop, and a grocer's shop, and a huxter's shop for\ntheir own accommodation, and were consequently vilified by the small\nold-established tradesmen around them. They got drunk occasionally,\nbut I doubt whether they drank more than did the farmers themselves\non market-day. They fought among themselves sometimes, but they\nforgave each other freely, and seemed to have no objection to black\neyes. I fear that they were not always good to their wives, nor\nwere their wives always good to them; but it should be remembered\nthat among the poor, especially when they live in clusters, such\nmisfortunes cannot be hidden as they may be amidst the decent\nbelongings of more wealthy people. That they worked very hard was\ncertain; and it was certain also that very few of their number ever\ncame upon the poor rates. What became of the old brickmakers no one\nknew. Who ever sees a worn-out aged navvie?\n\nMr. Crawley, ever since his first coming into Hogglestock, had been\nvery busy among these brickmakers, and by no means without success.\nIndeed the farmers had quarrelled with him because the brickmakers\nhad so crowded the narrow parish church, as to leave but scant room\nfor decent people. \"Doo they folk pay tithes? That's what I want\n'un to tell me?\" argued one farmer,--not altogether unnaturally,\nbelieving as he did that Mr. Crawley was paid by tithes out of his\nown pocket. But Mr. Crawley had done his best to make the brickmakers\nwelcome at the church, scandalizing the farmers by causing them\nto sit or stand in any portion of the church which was hitherto\nunappropriated. He had been constant in his personal visits to them,\nand had felt himself to be more a St. Paul with them than with any\nother of his neighbours around him.\n\nIt was a cold morning, but the rain of the preceding evening had\ngiven way to frost, and the air, though sharp, was dry. The ground\nunder the feet was crisp, having felt the wind and frost, and was no\nlonger clogged with mud. In his present state of mind the walk was\ngood for our poor pastor, and exhilarated him; but still, as he went,\nhe thought always of his injuries. His own wife believed that he was\nabout to commit suicide, and for so believing he was very angry with\nher; and yet, as he well knew, the idea of making away with himself\nhad flitted through his own mind a dozen times. Not from his own wife\ncould he get real sympathy. He would see what he could do with a\ncertain brickmaker of his acquaintance.\n\n\"Are you here, Dan?\" he said, knocking at the door of a cottage which\nstood alone, close to the towing-path of the canal, and close also to\na forlorn corner of the muddy, watery, ugly, disordered brickfield.\nIt was now just past six o'clock, and the men would be rising, as\nin midwinter they commenced their work at seven. The cottage was an\nunalluring, straight brick-built tenement, seeming as though intended\nto be one of a row which had never progressed beyond Number One. A\nvoice answered from the interior, inquiring who was the visitor, to\nwhich Mr. Crawley replied by giving his name. Then the key was turned\nin the lock, and Dan Morris, the brickmaker, appeared with a candle\nin his hand. He had been engaged in lighting the fire, with a view to\nhis own breakfast. \"Where is your wife, Dan?\" asked Mr. Crawley. The\nman answered by pointing with a short poker, which he held in his\nhand, to the bed, which was half screened from the room by a ragged\ncurtain, which hung from the ceiling half-way down to the floor. \"And\nare the Darvels here?\" asked Mr. Crawley. Then Morris, again using\nthe poker, pointed upwards, showing that the Darvels were still in\ntheir own allotted abode upstairs.\n\n\"You're early out, Muster Crawley,\" said Morris, and then he went on\nwith his fire. \"Drat the sticks, if they bean't as wet as the old\n'un hisself. Get up, old woman, and do you do it, for I can't. They\nwun't kindle for me, nohow.\" But the old woman, having well noted the\npresence of Mr. Crawley, thought it better to remain where she was.\n\nMr. Crawley sat himself down by the obstinate fire, and began to\narrange the sticks. \"Dan, Dan,\" said a voice from the bed, \"sure you\nwouldn't let his reverence trouble himself with the fire.\"\n\n\"How be I to keep him from it, if he chooses? I didn't ax him.\" Then\nMorris stood by and watched, and after a while Mr. Crawley succeeded\nin his attempt.\n\n\"How could it burn when you had not given the small spark a current\nof air to help it?\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"In course not,\" said the woman, \"but he be such a stupid.\"\n\nThe husband said no word in acknowledgment of this compliment, nor\ndid he thank Mr. Crawley for what he had done, nor appear as though\nhe intended to take any notice of him. He was going on with his work\nwhen Mr. Crawley again interrupted him.\n\n\"How did you get back from Silverbridge yesterday, Dan?\"\n\n\"Footed it,--all the blessed way.\"\n\n\"It's only eight miles.\"\n\n\"And I footed it there, and that's sixteen. And I paid\none-and-sixpence for beer and grub;--s'help me, I did.\"\n\n\"Dan!\" said the voice from the bed, rebuking him for the impropriety\nof his language.\n\n\"Well; I beg pardon, but I did. And they guv' me two bob;--just two\nplain shillings, by ----\"\n\n\"Dan!\"\n\n\"And I'd 've arned three-and-six here at brickmaking easy; that's\nwhat I would. How's a poor man to live that way? They'll not cotch me\nat Barchester 'Sizes at that price; they may be sure of that. Look\nthere,--that's what I've got for my day.\" And he put his hand into\nhis breeches'-pocket and fetched out a sixpence. \"How's a man to fill\nhis belly out of that? Damnation!\"\n\n\"Dan!\"\n\n\"Well, what did I say? Hold your jaw, will you, and not be halloaing\nat me that way? I know what I'm a saying of, and what I'm a doing\nof.\"\n\n\"I wish they'd given you something more with all my heart,\" said\nCrawley.\n\n\"We knows that,\" said the woman from the bed. \"We is sure of that,\nyour reverence.\"\n\n\"Sixpence!\" said the man, scornfully. \"If they'd have guv me nothing\nat all but the run of my teeth at the public-house, I'd 've taken it\nbetter. But sixpence!\"\n\nThen there was a pause. \"And what have they given to me?\" said Mr.\nCrawley, when the man's ill-humour about his sixpence had so far\nsubsided as to allow of his busying himself again about the premises.\n\n\"Yes, indeed;--yes, indeed,\" said the woman. \"Yes, yes, we feel that;\nwe do indeed, Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"I tell you what, sir; for another sixpence I'd 've sworn you'd\nnever guv' me the paper at all; and so I will now, if it bean't too\nlate;--sixpence or no sixpence. What do I care? d---- them.\"\n\n\"Dan!\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't I? They hain't got brains enough among them to\nwinny the truth from the lies,--not among the lot of 'em. I'll swear\nafore the judge that you didn't give it me at all, if that'll do any\ngood.\"\n\n\"Man, do you think I would have you perjure yourself, even if that\nwould do me a service? And do you think that any man was ever served\nby a lie?\"\n\n\"Faix, among them chaps it don't do to tell them too much of the\ntruth. Look at that!\" And he brought out the sixpence again from his\nbreeches'-pocket. \"And look at your reverence. Only that they've let\nyou out for a while, they've been nigh as hard on you as though you\nwere one of us.\"\n\n\"If they think that I stole it, they have been right,\" said Mr.\nCrawley.\n\n\"It's been along of that chap, Soames,\" said the woman. \"The lord\nwould 've paid the money out of his own pocket and never said not a\nword.\"\n\n\"If they think that I've been a thief, they've done right,\" repeated\nMr. Crawley. \"But how can they think so? How can they think so? Have\nI lived like a thief among them?\"\n\n\"For the matter o' that, if a man ain't paid for his work by them as\nis his employers, he must pay hisself. Them's my notions. Look at\nthat!\" Whereupon he again pulled out the sixpence, and held it forth\nin the palm of his hand.\n\n\"You believe, then,\" said Mr. Crawley, speaking very slowly, \"that I\ndid steal the money. Speak out, Dan; I shall not be angry. As you go\nyou are honest men, and I want to know what such of you think about\nit.\"\n\n\"He don't think nothing of the kind,\" said the woman, almost getting\nout of bed in her energy. \"If he'd athought the like o' that in his\nhead, I'd read 'un such a lesson he'd never think again the longest\nday he had to live.\"\n\n\"Speak out, Dan,\" said the clergyman, not attending to the woman.\n\"You can understand that no good can come of a lie.\" Dan Morris\nscratched his head. \"Speak out, man, when I tell you,\" said Crawley.\n\n[Illustration: \"Speak out, Dan.\"]\n\n\"Drat it all,\" said Dan, \"where's the use of so much jaw about it?\"\n\n\"Say you know his reverence is as innocent as the babe as isn't\nborn,\" said the woman.\n\n\"No; I won't,--say nothing of the kind,\" said Dan.\n\n\"Speak out the truth,\" said Crawley.\n\n\"They do say, among 'em,\" said Dan, \"that you picked it up, and then\ngot a woolgathering in your head till you didn't rightly know where\nit come from.\" Then he paused. \"And after a bit you guv' it me to get\nthe money. Didn't you, now?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"And they do say if a poor man had done it, it'd been stealing, for\nsartain.\"\n\n\"And I'm a poor man,--the poorest in all Hogglestock; and, therefore,\nof course, it is stealing. Of course I am a thief. Yes; of course I\nam a thief. When did not the world believe the worst of the poor?\"\nHaving so spoken, Mr. Crawley rose from his chair and hurried out of\nthe cottage, waiting no further reply from Dan Morris or his wife.\nAnd as he made his way slowly home, not going there by the direct\nroad, but by a long circuit, he told himself that there could be no\nsympathy for him anywhere. Even Dan Morris, the brickmaker, thought\nthat he was a thief.\n\n\"And am I a thief?\" he said to himself, standing in the middle of the\nroad, with his hands up to his forehead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTHE BISHOP'S ANGEL.\n\n\nIt was nearly nine before Mr. Crawley got back to his house, and\nfound his wife and daughter waiting breakfast for him. \"I should not\nwonder if Grace were over here to-day,\" said Mrs. Crawley. \"She'd\nbetter remain where she is,\" said he. After this the meal passed\nalmost without a word. When it was over, Jane, at a sign from her\nmother, went up to her father and asked him whether she should read\nwith him. \"Not now,\" he said, \"not just now. I must rest my brain\nbefore it will be fit for any work.\" Then he got into the chair over\nthe fire, and his wife began to fear that he would remain there all\nthe day.\n\nBut the morning was not far advanced, when there came a visitor who\ndisturbed him, and by disturbing him did him real service. Just at\nten there arrived at the little gate before the house a man on a\npony, whom Jane espied, standing there by the pony's head and looking\nabout for some one to relieve him from the charge of his steed.\nThis was Mr. Thumble, who had ridden over to Hogglestock on a poor\nspavined brute belonging to the bishop's stable, and which had once\nbeen the bishop's cob. Now it was the vehicle by which Mrs. Proudie's\nepiscopal messages were sent backwards and forwards through a\ntwelve-miles ride round Barchester; and so many were the lady's\nrequirements, that the poor animal by no means eat the hay of\nidleness. Mr. Thumble had suggested to Mrs. Proudie, after their\ninterview with the bishop and the giving up of the letter to the\nclerical messenger's charge, that before hiring a gig from the\n\"Dragon of Wantley,\" he should be glad to know,--looking as he always\ndid to \"Mary Anne and the children,\"--whence the price of the gig was\nto be returned to him. Mrs. Proudie had frowned at him,--not with all\nthe austerity of frowning which she could use when really angered,\nbut simply with a frown which gave her some little time for thought,\nand would enable her to continue the rebuke if, after thinking,\nshe should find that rebuke was needed. But mature consideration\nshowed her that Mr. Thumble's caution was not without reason. Were\nthe bishop energetic,--or even the bishop's managing chaplain as\nenergetic as he should be, Mr. Crawley might, as Mrs. Proudie felt\nassured, be made in some way to pay for a conveyance for Mr. Thumble.\nBut the energy was lacking, and the price of the gig, if the gig were\nordered, would certainly fall ultimately upon the bishop's shoulders.\nThis was very sad. Mrs. Proudie had often grieved over the necessary\nexpenditure of episcopal surveillance, and had been heard to declare\nher opinion that a liberal allowance for secret service should\nbe made in every diocese. What better could the Ecclesiastical\nCommissioners do with all those rich revenues which they had stolen\nfrom the bishops? But there was no such liberal allowance at present,\nand, therefore, Mrs. Proudie, after having frowned at Mr. Thumble for\nsome seconds, desired him to take the grey cob. Now, Mr. Thumble had\nridden the grey cob before, and would much have preferred a gig. But\neven the grey cob was better than a gig at his own cost.\n\n\"Mamma, there's a man at the gate wanting to come in,\" said Jane. \"I\nthink he's a clergyman.\"\n\nMr. Crawley immediately raised his head, though he did not at once\nleave his chair. Mrs. Crawley went to the window, and recognized the\nreverend visitor. \"My dear, it is that Mr. Thumble, who is so much\nwith the bishop.\"\n\n\"What does Mr. Thumble want with me?\"\n\n\"Nay, my dear; he will tell you that himself.\" But Mrs. Crawley,\nthough she answered him with a voice intended to be cheerful, greatly\nfeared the coming of this messenger from the palace. She perceived\nat once that the bishop was about to interfere with her husband in\nconsequence of that which the magistrates had done yesterday.\n\n\"Mamma, he doesn't know what to do with his pony,\" said Jane.\n\n\"Tell him to tie it to the rail,\" said Mr. Crawley. \"If he has\nexpected to find menials here, as he has them at the palace, he will\nbe wrong. If he wants to come in here, let him tie the beast to the\nrail.\" So Jane went out and sent a message to Mr. Thumble by the\ngirl, and Mr. Thumble did tie the pony to the rail, and followed the\ngirl into the house. Jane in the meantime had retired out by the back\ndoor to the school, but Mrs. Crawley kept her ground. She kept her\nground although she almost believed that her husband would prefer to\nhave the field to himself. As Mr. Thumble did not at once enter the\nroom, Mr. Crawley stalked to the door, and stood with it open in his\nhand. Though he knew Mr. Thumble's person, he was not acquainted\nwith him, and therefore he simply bowed to the visitor, bowing\nmore than once or twice with a cold courtesy, which did not put Mr.\nThumble altogether at his ease. \"My name is Mr. Thumble,\" said the\nvisitor,--\"The Reverend Caleb Thumble,\" and he held the bishop's\nletter in his hand. Mr. Crawley seemed to take no notice of the\nletter, but motioned Mr. Thumble with his hand into the room.\n\n\"I suppose you have come over from Barchester this morning?\" said\nMrs. Crawley.\n\n\"Yes, madam,--from the palace.\" Mr. Thumble, though a humble man in\npositions in which he felt that humility would become him,--a humble\nman to his betters, as he himself would have expressed it,--had still\nabout him something of that pride which naturally belonged to those\nclergymen who were closely attached to the palace at Barchester. Had\nhe been sent on a message to Plumstead,--could any such message from\nBarchester palace have been possible, he would have been properly\nhumble in his demeanour to the archdeacon, or to Mrs. Grantly had he\nbeen admitted to the august presence of that lady; but he was aware\nthat humility would not become him on his present mission; he had\nbeen expressly ordered to be firm by Mrs. Proudie, and firm he meant\nto be; and therefore, in communicating to Mrs. Crawley the fact that\nhe had come from the palace, he did load the tone of his voice with\nsomething of dignity which Mr. Crawley might perhaps be excused for\nregarding as arrogance.\n\n\"And what does the 'palace' want with me?\" said Mr. Crawley. Mrs.\nCrawley knew at once that there was to be a battle. Nay, the battle\nhad begun. Nor was she altogether sorry; for though she could not\ntrust her husband to sit alone all day in his arm-chair over the\nfire, she could trust him to carry on a disputation with any other\nclergyman on any subject whatever. \"What does the palace want with\nme?\" And as Mr. Crawley asked the question he stood erect, and looked\nMr. Thumble full in the face. Mr. Thumble called to mind the fact,\nthat Mr. Crawley was a very poor man indeed,--so poor that he owed\nmoney all round the country to butchers and bakers, and the other\nfact, that he, Mr. Thumble himself, did not owe any money to any one,\nhis wife luckily having a little income of her own; and, strengthened\nby these remembrances, he endeavoured to bear Mr. Crawley's attack\nwith gallantry.\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Crawley, you are aware that this unfortunate affair\nat Silverbridge--\"\n\n\"I am not prepared, sir, to discuss the unfortunate affair at\nSilverbridge with a stranger. If you are the bearer of any message to\nme from the Bishop of Barchester, perhaps you will deliver it.\"\n\n\"I have brought a letter,\" said Mr. Thumble. Then Mr. Crawley\nstretched out his hand without a word, and taking the letter with him\nto the window, read it very slowly. When he had made himself master\nof its contents, he refolded the letter, placed it again in the\nenvelope, and returned to the spot where Mr. Thumble was standing.\n\"I will answer the bishop's letter,\" he said; \"I will answer it of\ncourse, as it is fitting that I should do. Shall I ask you to wait\nfor my reply, or shall I send it by course of post?\"\n\n\"I think, Mr. Crawley, as the bishop wishes me to undertake the\nduty--\"\n\n\"You will not undertake the duty, Mr. Thumble. You need not trouble\nyourself, for I shall not surrender my pulpit to you.\"\n\n\"But the bishop--\"\n\n\"I care nothing for the bishop in this matter.\" So much he spoke in\nanger, and then he corrected himself. \"I crave the bishop's pardon,\nand yours as his messenger, if in the heat occasioned by my strong\nfeelings I have said aught which may savour of irreverence towards\nhis lordship's office. I respect his lordship's high position as\nbishop of this diocese, and I bow to his commands in all things\nlawful. But I must not bow to him in things unlawful, nor must I\nabandon my duty before God at his bidding, unless his bidding be\ngiven in accordance with the canons of the Church and the laws of the\nland. It will be my duty, on the coming Sunday, to lead the prayers\nof my people in the church of my parish, and to preach to them from\nmy pulpit; and that duty, with God's assistance, I will perform. Nor\nwill I allow any clergyman to interfere with me in the performance\nof those sacred offices,--no, not though the bishop himself should\nbe present with the object of enforcing his illegal command.\" Mr.\nCrawley spoke these words without hesitation, even with eloquence,\nstanding upright, and with something of a noble anger gleaming over\nhis poor wan face; and, I think, that while speaking them, he was\nhappier than he had been for many a long day.\n\nMr. Thumble listened to him patiently, standing with one foot a\nlittle in advance of the other, with one hand folded over the other,\nwith his head rather on one side, and with his eyes fixed on the\ncorner where the wall and ceiling joined each other. He had been\ntold to be firm, and he was considering how he might best display\nfirmness. He thought that he remembered some story of two parsons\nfighting for one pulpit, and he thought also that he should not\nhimself like to incur the scandal of such a proceeding in the\ndiocese. As to the law in the matter he knew nothing himself; but\nhe presumed that a bishop would probably know the law better than a\nperpetual curate. That Mrs. Proudie was intemperate and imperious, he\nwas aware. Had the message come from her alone, he might have felt\nthat even for her sake he had better give way. But as the despotic\narrogance of the lady had been in this case backed by the timid\npresence and hesitating words of her lord, Mr. Thumble thought\nthat he must have the law on his side. \"I think you will find, Mr.\nCrawley,\" said he, \"that the bishop's inhibition is strictly legal.\"\nHe had picked up the powerful word from Mrs. Proudie and flattered\nhimself that it might be of use to him in carrying his purpose.\n\n\"It is illegal,\" said Mr. Crawley, speaking somewhat louder than\nbefore, \"and will be absolutely futile. As you pleaded to me that you\nyourself and your own personal convenience were concerned in this\nmatter, I have made known my intentions to you, which otherwise I\nshould have made known only to the bishop. If you please, we will\ndiscuss the subject no further.\"\n\n\"Am I to understand, Mr. Crawley, that you refuse to obey the\nbishop?\"\n\n\"The bishop has written to me, sir; and I will make known my\nintention to the bishop by a written answer. As you have been the\nbearer of the bishop's letter to me, I am bound to ask you whether\nI shall be indebted to you for carrying back my reply, or whether\nI shall send it by course of post?\" Mr. Thumble considered for a\nmoment, and then made up his mind that he had better wait, and carry\nback the epistle. This was Friday, and the letter could not be\ndelivered by post till the Saturday morning. Mrs. Proudie might be\nangry with him if he should be the cause of loss of time. He did\nnot, however, at all like waiting, having perceived that Mr. Crawley,\nthough with language courteously worded, had spoken of him as a mere\nmessenger.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that I may, perhaps, best further the object\nwhich we must all have in view, that namely of providing properly\nfor the Sunday services of the church of Hogglestock, by taking your\nreply personally to the bishop.\"\n\n\"That provision is my care and need trouble no one else,\" said\nMr. Crawley, in a loud voice. Then, before seating himself at his\nold desk, he stood awhile, pondering, with his back turned to his\nvisitor. \"I have to ask your pardon, sir,\" said he, looking round\nfor a moment, \"because, by reason of the extreme poverty of this\nhouse, my wife is unable to offer to you that hospitality which is\nespecially due from one clergyman to another.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't mention it,\" said Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"If you will allow me, sir, I would prefer that it should be\nmentioned.\" Then he seated himself at his desk, and commenced his\nletter.\n\nMr. Thumble felt himself to be awkwardly placed. Had there been no\nthird person in the room he could have sat down in Mr. Crawley's\narm-chair, and waited patiently till the letter should be finished.\nBut Mrs. Crawley was there, and of course he was bound to speak to\nher. In what strain could he do so? Even he, little as he was given\nto indulge in sentiment, had been touched by the man's appeal to his\nown poverty, and he felt, moreover, that Mrs. Crawley must have been\ndeeply moved by her husband's position with reference to the bishop's\norder. It was quite out of the question that he should speak of that,\nas Mr. Crawley would, he was well aware, immediately turn upon him.\nAt last he thought of a subject, and spoke with a voice intended to\nbe pleasant. \"That was the school-house I passed, probably, just as I\ncame here?\" Mrs. Crawley told him that it was the school-house. \"Ah,\nyes, I thought so. Have you a certified teacher here?\" Mrs. Crawley\nexplained that no Government aid had ever reached Hogglestock.\nBesides themselves, they had only a young woman whom they themselves\nhad instructed. \"Ah, that is a pity,\" said Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"I,--I am the certified teacher,\" said Mr. Crawley, turning round\nupon him from his chair.\n\n\"Oh, ah, yes,\" said Mr. Thumble; and after that Mr. Thumble asked\nno more questions about the Hogglestock school. Soon afterwards Mrs.\nCrawley left the room, seeing the difficulty under which Mr. Thumble\nwas labouring, and feeling sure that her presence would not now be\nnecessary. Mr. Crawley's letter was written quickly, though every now\nand then he would sit for a moment with his pen poised in the air,\nsearching his memory for a word. But the words came to him easily,\nand before an hour was over he had handed his letter to Mr. Thumble.\nThe letter was as follows:--\n\n\n   The Parsonage, Hogglestock, Dec. 186--.\n\n   RIGHT REVEREND LORD,\n\n   I have received the letter of yesterday's date which your\n   lordship has done me the honour of sending to me by the\n   hands of the Reverend Mr. Thumble, and I avail myself of\n   that gentleman's kindness to return to you an answer by\n   the same means, moved thus to use his patience chiefly\n   by the consideration that in this way my reply to your\n   lordship's injunctions may be in your hands with less\n   delay than would attend the regular course of the\n   mail-post.\n\n   It is with deep regret that I feel myself constrained to\n   inform your lordship that I cannot obey the command which\n   you have laid upon me with reference to the services of my\n   church in this parish. I cannot permit Mr. Thumble, or any\n   other delegate from your lordship, to usurp my place in my\n   pulpit. I would not have you to think, if I can possibly\n   dispel such thoughts from your mind, that I disregard your\n   high office, or that I am deficient in that respectful\n   obedience to the bishop set over me, which is due to the\n   authority of the Crown as the head of the church in these\n   realms; but in this, as in all questions of obedience, he\n   who is required to obey must examine the extent of the\n   authority exercised by him who demands obedience. Your\n   lordship might possibly call upon me, using your voice as\n   bishop of the diocese, to abandon altogether the freehold\n   rights which are now mine in this perpetual curacy. The\n   judge of assize, before whom I shall soon stand for my\n   trial, might command me to retire to prison without a\n   verdict given by the jury. The magistrates who committed\n   me so lately as yesterday, upon whose decision in that\n   respect your lordship has taken action against me so\n   quickly, might have equally strained their authority. But\n   in no case, in this land, is he that is subject bound\n   to obey, further than where the law gives authority and\n   exacts obedience. It is not in the power of the Crown\n   itself to inhibit me from the performance of my ordinary\n   duties in this parish by any such missive as that sent to\n   me by your lordship. If your lordship think it right to\n   stop my mouth as a clergyman in your diocese, you must\n   proceed to do so in an ecclesiastical court in accordance\n   with the laws, and will succeed in your object, or fail,\n   in accordance with the evidences as to ministerial fitness\n   or unfitness, which may be produced respecting me before\n   the proper tribunal.\n\n   I will allow that much attention is due from a clergyman\n   to pastoral advice given to him by his bishop. On that\n   head I must first express to your lordship my full\n   understanding that your letter has not been intended to\n   convey advice, but an order;--an inhibition, as your\n   messenger, the Reverend Mr. Thumble, has expressed it.\n   There might be a case certainly in which I should submit\n   myself to counsel, though I should resist command. No\n   counsel, however, has been given,--except indeed that I\n   should receive your messenger in a proper spirit, which\n   I hope I have done. No other advice has been given me,\n   and therefore there is now no such case as that I have\n   imagined. But in this matter, my lord, I could not have\n   accepted advice from living man, no, not though the\n   hands of the apostles themselves had made him bishop\n   who tendered it to me, and had set him over me for my\n   guidance. I am in a terrible strait. Trouble, and sorrow,\n   and danger are upon me and mine. It may well be, as your\n   lordship says, that the bitter waters of the present\n   hour may pass over my head and destroy me. I thank\n   your lordship for telling me whither I am to look for\n   assistance. Truly I know not whether there is any to be\n   found for me on earth. But the deeper my troubles, the\n   greater my sorrow, the more pressing my danger, the\n   stronger is my need that I should carry myself in these\n   days with that outward respect of self which will teach\n   those around me to know that, let who will condemn me, I\n   have not condemned myself. Were I to abandon my pulpit,\n   unless forced to do so by legal means, I should in doing\n   so be putting a plea of guilty against myself upon the\n   record. This, my lord, I will not do.\n\n   I have the honour to be, my lord,\n   Your lordship's most obedient servant,\n\n   JOSIAH CRAWLEY.\n\n\nWhen he had finished writing his letter he read it over slowly, and\nthen handed it to Mr. Thumble. The act of writing, and the current of\nthe thoughts through his brain, and the feeling that in every word\nwritten he was getting the better of the bishop,--all this joined to\na certain manly delight in warfare against authority, lighted up the\nman's face and gave to his eyes an expression which had been long\nwanting to them. His wife at that moment came into the room and he\nlooked at her with an air of triumph as he handed the letter to Mr.\nThumble. \"If you will give that to his lordship with an assurance\nof my duty to his lordship in all things proper, I will thank you\nkindly, craving your pardon for the great delay to which you have\nbeen subjected.\"\n\n\"As to the delay, that is nothing,\" said Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"It has been much; but you as a clergyman will feel that it has been\nincumbent on me to speak my mind fully.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; of course.\" Mr. Crawley was standing up, as also was Mrs.\nCrawley. It was evident to Mr. Thumble that they both expected that\nhe should go. But he had been specially enjoined to be firm, and he\ndoubted whether hitherto he had been firm enough. As far as this\nmorning's work had as yet gone, it seemed to him that Mr. Crawley had\nhad the play all to himself, and that he, Mr. Thumble, had not had\nhis innings. He, from the palace, had been, as it were, cowed by this\nman, who had been forced to plead his own poverty. It was certainly\nincumbent upon him, before he went, to speak up, not only for the\nbishop, but for himself also. \"Mr. Crawley,\" he said, \"hitherto I\nhave listened to you patiently.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Mr. Crawley, smiling, \"you have indeed been patient, and\nI thank you; but my words have been written, not spoken.\"\n\n\"You have told me that you intend to disobey the bishop's\ninhibition.\"\n\n\"I have told the bishop so certainly.\"\n\n\"May I ask you now to listen to me for a few minutes?\"\n\nMr. Crawley, still smiling, still having in his eyes the unwonted\ntriumph which had lighted them up, paused a moment, and then answered\nhim. \"Reverend sir, you must excuse me if I say no,--not on this\nsubject.\"\n\n\"You will not let me speak?\"\n\n\"No; not on this matter, which is very private to me. What should\nyou think if I went into your house and inquired of you as to those\nthings which were particularly near to you?\"\n\n\"But the bishop sent me.\"\n\n\"Though ten bishops had sent me,--a council of archbishops if you\nwill!\" Mr. Thumble started back, appalled at the energy of the words\nused to him. \"Shall a man have nothing of his own;--no sorrow in his\nheart, no care in his family, no thought in his breast so private and\nspecial to him, but that, if he happen to be a clergyman, the bishop\nmay touch it with his thumb?\"\n\n\"I am not the bishop's thumb,\" said Mr. Thumble, drawing himself up.\n\n\"I intended not to hint anything personally objectionable to\nyourself. I will regard you as one of the angels of the church.\" Mr.\nThumble, when he heard this, began to be sure that Mr. Crawley was\nmad; he knew of no angels that could ride about the Barsetshire lanes\non grey ponies. \"And as such I will respect you; but I cannot discuss\nwith you the matter of the bishop's message.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well. I will tell his lordship.\"\n\n\"I will pray you to do so.\"\n\n\"And his lordship, should he so decide, will arm me with such power\non my next coming as will enable me to carry out his lordship's\nwishes.\"\n\n\"His lordship will abide by the law, as will you also.\" In speaking\nthese last words he stood with the door in his hand, and Mr. Thumble,\nnot knowing how to increase or even to maintain his firmness, thought\nit best to pass out, and mount his grey pony and ride away.\n\n\"The poor man thought that you were laughing at him when you called\nhim an angel of the church,\" said Mrs. Crawley, coming up to him and\nsmiling on him.\n\n\"Had I told him he was simply a messenger, he would have taken it\nworse;--poor fool! When they have rid themselves of me they may put\nhim here, in my church; but not yet,--not yet. Where is Jane? Tell\nher that I am ready to commence the Seven against Thebes with her.\"\nThen Jane was immediately sent for out of the school, and the Seven\nagainst Thebes was commenced with great energy. Often during the next\nhour and a half Mrs. Crawley from the kitchen would hear him reading\nout, or rather saying by rote, with sonorous, rolling voice, great\npassages from some chorus, and she was very thankful to the bishop\nwho had sent over to them a message and a messenger which had been\nso salutary in their effect upon her husband. \"In truth an angel of\nthe church,\" she said to herself as she chopped up the onions for\nthe mutton-broth; and ever afterwards she regarded Mr. Thumble as an\n\"angel.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nMAJOR GRANTLY CONSULTS A FRIEND.\n\n\nGrace Crawley passed through Silverbridge on her way to Allington on\nthe Monday, and on the Tuesday morning Major Grantly received a very\nshort note from Miss Prettyman, telling him that she had done so.\n\"Dear Sir,--I think you will be glad to learn that our friend Miss\nCrawley went from us yesterday on a visit to her friend, Miss Dale,\nat Allington.--Yours truly, Annabella Prettyman.\" The note said no\nmore than that. Major Grantly was glad to get it, obtaining from it\nthat satisfaction which a man always feels when he is presumed to\nbe concerned in the affairs of the lady with whom he is in love.\nAnd he regarded Miss Prettyman with favourable eyes,--as a discreet\nand friendly woman. Nevertheless, he was not altogether happy. The\nvery fact that Miss Prettyman should write to him on such a subject\nmade him feel that he was bound to Grace Crawley. He knew enough\nof himself to be sure that he could not give her up without making\nhimself miserable. And yet, as regarded her father, things were going\nfrom bad to worse. Everybody now said that the evidence was so strong\nagainst Mr. Crawley as to leave hardly a doubt of his guilt. Even\nthe ladies in Silverbridge were beginning to give up his cause,\nacknowledging that the money could not have come rightfully into his\nhands, and excusing him on the plea of partial insanity. \"He has\npicked it up and put it by for months, and then thought that it was\nhis own.\" The ladies of Silverbridge could find nothing better to\nsay for him than that; and when young Mr. Walker remarked that such\nlittle mistakes were the customary causes of men being taken to\nprison, the ladies of Silverbridge did not know how to answer him.\nIt had come to be their opinion that Mr. Crawley was affected with a\npartial lunacy, which ought to be forgiven in one to whom the world\nhad been so cruel; and when young Mr. Walker endeavoured to explain\nto them that a man must be sane altogether or mad altogether, and\nthat Mr. Crawley must, if sane, be locked up as a thief, and if mad,\nlocked up as a madman, they sighed, and were convinced that until the\nworld should have been improved by a new infusion of romance, and a\nstronger feeling of poetic justice, Mr. John Walker was right.\n\nAnd the result of this general opinion made its way out to Major\nGrantly, and made its way, also, to the archdeacon at Plumstead. As\nto the major, in giving him his due, it must be explained that the\nmore certain he became of the father's guilt, the more certain also\nhe became of the daughter's merits. It was very hard. The whole thing\nwas cruelly hard. It was cruelly hard upon him that he should be\nbrought into this trouble, and be forced to take upon himself the\narmour of a knight-errant for the redress of the wrong on the part\nof the young lady. But when alone in his house, or with his child,\nhe declared to himself that he would do so. It might well be that\nhe could not live in Barsetshire after he had married Mr. Crawley's\ndaughter. He had inherited from his father enough of that longing\nfor ascendancy among those around him to make him feel that in\nsuch circumstances he would be wretched. But he would be made more\nwretched by the self-knowledge that he had behaved badly to the\ngirl he loved; and the world beyond Barsetshire was open to him. He\nwould take her with him to Canada, to New Zealand, or to some other\nfar-away country, and there begin his life again. Should his father\nchoose to punish him for so doing by disinheriting him, they would be\npoor enough; but, in his present frame of mind, the major was able to\nregard such poverty as honourable and not altogether disagreeable.\n\nHe had been out shooting all day at Chaldicotes, with Dr. Thorne and\na party who were staying in the house there, and had been talking\nabout Mr. Crawley, first with one man and then with another. Lord\nLufton had been there, and young Gresham from Greshamsbury, and Mr.\nRobarts the clergyman, and news had come among them of the attempt\nmade by the bishop to stop Mr. Crawley from preaching. Mr. Robarts\nhad been of opinion that Mr. Crawley should have given way; and Lord\nLufton, who shared his mother's intense dislike of everything that\ncame from the palace, had sworn that he was right to resist. The\nsympathy of the whole party had been with Mr. Crawley; but they had\nall agreed that he had stolen the money.\n\n\"I fear he'll have to give way to the bishop at last,\" Lord Lufton\nhad said.\n\n\"And what on earth will become of his children?\" said the doctor.\n\"Think of the fate of that pretty girl; for she is a very pretty\ngirl. It will be ruin to her. No man will allow himself to fall\nin love with her when her father shall have been found guilty of\nstealing a cheque for twenty pounds.\"\n\n\"We must do something for the whole family,\" said the lord. \"I say,\nThorne, you haven't half the game here that there used to be in poor\nold Sowerby's time.\"\n\n\"Haven't I?\" said the doctor. \"You see Sowerby had been at it all his\ndays, and never did anything else. I only began late in life.\"\n\nThe major had intended to stay and dine at Chaldicotes, but when\nhe heard what was said about Grace, his heart became sad, and he\nmade some excuse as to his child, and returned home. Dr. Thorne had\ndeclared that no man could allow himself to fall in love with her.\nBut what if a man had fallen in love with her beforehand? What if a\nman had not only fallen in love, but spoken of his love? Had he been\nalone with the doctor, he would, I think, have told him the whole of\nhis trouble; for in all the county there was no man whom he would\nsooner have trusted with his secret. This Dr. Thorne was known far\nand wide for his soft heart, his open hand, and his well-sustained\nindifference to the world's opinions on most of those social matters\nwith which the world meddles; and therefore the words which he had\nspoken had more weight with Major Grantly than they would have had\nfrom other lips. As he drove home he almost made up his mind that he\nwould consult Dr. Thorne upon the matter. There were many younger men\nwith whom he was very intimate,--Frank Gresham, for instance, and\nLord Lufton himself; but this was an affair which he hardly knew how\nto discuss with a young man. To Dr. Thorne he thought that he could\nbring himself to tell the whole story.\n\nIn the evening there came to him a messenger from Plumstead, with a\nletter from his father and some present for the child. He knew at\nonce that the present had been thus sent as an excuse for the letter.\nHis father might have written by the post, of course; but that would\nhave given to his letter a certain air and tone which he had not\nwished it to bear. After some message from the major's mother, and\nsome allusion to Edith, the archdeacon struck off upon the matter\nthat was near his heart.\n\n\"I fear it is all up with that unfortunate man at Hogglestock,\" he\nsaid. \"From what I hear of the evidence which came out before the\nmagistrates, there can, I think, be no doubt as to his guilt. Have\nyou heard that the bishop sent over on the following day to stop him\nfrom preaching? He did so, and sent again on the Sunday. But Crawley\nwould not give way, and so far I respect the man; for, as a matter\nof course, whatever the bishop did, or attempted to do, he would do\nwith an extreme of bad taste, probably with gross ignorance as to his\nown duty and as to the duty of the man under him. I am told that on\nthe first day Crawley turned out of his house the messenger sent to\nhim,--some stray clergyman whom Mrs. Proudie keeps about the house;\nand that on the Sunday the stairs to the reading-desk and pulpit\nwere occupied by a lot of brickmakers, among whom the parson from\nBarchester did not venture to attempt to make his way, although he\nwas fortified by the presence of one of the cathedral vergers and by\none of the palace footmen. I can hardly believe about the verger and\nthe footman. As for the rest, I have no doubt it is all true. I pity\nCrawley from my heart. Poor, unfortunate man! The general opinion\nseems to be that he is not in truth responsible for what he has done.\nAs for his victory over the bishop, nothing on earth could be better.\n\n\"Your mother particularly wishes you to come over to us before the\nend of the week, and to bring Edith. Your grandfather will be here,\nand he is becoming so infirm that he will never come to us for\nanother Christmas. Of course you will stay over the new year.\"\n\nThough the letter was full of Mr. Crawley and his affairs there was\nnot a word in it about Grace. This, however, was quite natural. Major\nGrantly perfectly well understood his father's anxiety to carry his\npoint without seeming to allude to the disagreeable subject. \"My\nfather is very clever,\" he said to himself, \"very clever. But he\nisn't so clever but one can see how clever he is.\"\n\nOn the next day he went into Silverbridge, intending to call on Miss\nPrettyman. He had not quite made up his mind what he would say to\nMiss Prettyman; nor was he called upon to do so, as he never got as\nfar as that lady's house. While walking up the High Street he saw\nMrs. Thorne in her carriage, and, as a matter of course, he stopped\nto speak to her. He knew Mrs. Thorne quite as intimately as he did\nher husband, and liked her quite as well. \"Major Grantly,\" she said,\nspeaking out loud to him, half across the street; \"I was very angry\nwith you yesterday. Why did you not come up to dinner? We had a room\nready for you and everything.\"\n\n\"I was not quite well, Mrs. Thorne.\"\n\n\"Fiddlestick. Don't tell me of not being well. There was Emily\nbreaking her heart about you.\"\n\n\"I'm sure Miss Dunstable--\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, I think she'll get over it. It won't be\nmortal with her. But do tell me, Major Grantly, what are we to think\nabout this poor Mr. Crawley? It was so good of you to be one of his\nbailsmen.\"\n\n\"He would have found twenty in Silverbridge, if he had wanted them.\"\n\n\"And do you hear that he has defied the bishop? I do so like him for\nthat. Not but what poor Mrs. Proudie is the dearest friend I have in\nthe world, and I'm always fighting a battle with old Lady Lufton on\nher behalf. But one likes to see one's friends worsted sometimes, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand what did happen at Hogglestock on Sunday,\"\nsaid the major.\n\n\"Some say he had the bishop's chaplain put under the pump. I don't\nbelieve that; but there is no doubt that when the poor fellow tried\nto get into the pulpit, they took him and carried him neck and heels\nout of the church. But, tell me, Major Grantly, what is to become of\nthe family?\"\n\n\"Heaven knows!\"\n\n\"Is it not sad? And that eldest girl is so nice! They tell me\nthat she is perfect,--not only in beauty, but in manners and\naccomplishments. Everybody says that she talks Greek just as well as\nshe does English, and that she understands philosophy from the top to\nthe bottom.\"\n\n\"At any rate, she is so good and so lovely that one cannot but pity\nher now,\" said the major.\n\n\"You know her, then, Major Grantly? By-the-by, of course you do, as\nyou were staying with her at Framley.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know her.\"\n\n\"What is to become of her? I'm going your way. You might as well\nget into the carriage, and I'll drive you home. If he is sent to\nprison,--and they say he must be sent to prison,--what is to become\nof them?\" Then Major Grantly did get into the carriage, and, before\nhe got out again, he had told Mrs. Thorne the whole story of his\nlove.\n\nShe listened to him with the closest attention; only interrupting\nhim now and then with little words, intended to signify her approval.\nHe, as he told his tale, did not look her in the face, but sat with\nhis eyes fixed upon her muff. \"And now,\" he said, glancing up at her\nalmost for the first time as he finished his speech, \"and now, Mrs.\nThorne, what am I to do?\"\n\n\"Marry her, of course,\" said she, raising her hand aloft and bringing\nit down heavily upon his knee as she gave her decisive reply.\n\n\"H--sh--h,\" he exclaimed, looking back in dismay towards the\nservants.\n\n\"Oh, they never hear anything up there. They're thinking about the\nlast pot of porter they had, or the next they're to get. Deary me,\nI am so glad! Of course you'll marry her.\"\n\n\"You forget my father.\"\n\n\"No, I don't. What has a father to do with it? You're old enough to\nplease yourself without asking your father. Besides, Lord bless me,\nthe archdeacon isn't the man to bear malice. He'll storm and threaten\nand stop the supplies for a month or so. Then he'll double them, and\ntake your wife to his bosom, and kiss her and bless her, and all that\nkind of thing. We all know what parental wrath means in such cases as\nthat.\"\n\n\"But my sister--\"\n\n\"As for your sister, don't talk to me about her. I don't care two\nstraws about your sister. You must excuse me, Major Grantly, but Lady\nHartletop is really too big for my powers of vision.\"\n\n\"And Edith,--of course, Mrs. Thorne, I can't be blind to the fact\nthat in many ways such a marriage would be injurious to her. No man\nwishes to be connected with a convicted thief.\"\n\n\"No, Major Grantly; but a man does wish to marry the girl that he\nloves. At least, I suppose so. And what man ever was able to give a\nmore touching proof of his affection than you can do now? If I were\nyou, I'd be at Allington before twelve o'clock to-morrow,--I would\nindeed. What does it matter about the trumpery cheque? Everybody\nknows it was a mistake, if he did take it. And surely you would not\npunish her for that.\"\n\n\"No,--no; but I don't suppose she'd think it a punishment.\"\n\n\"You go and ask her, then. And I'll tell you what. If she hasn't\na house of her own to be married from, she shall be married from\nChaldicotes. We'll have such a breakfast! And I'll make as much\nof her as if she were the daughter of my old friend, the bishop\nhimself,--I will indeed.\"\n\nThis was Mrs. Thorne's advice. Before it was completed, Major Grantly\nhad been carried half-way to Chaldicotes. When he left his impetuous\nfriend he was too prudent to make any promise, but he declared that\nwhat she had said should have much weight with him.\n\n\"You won't mention it to anybody?\" said the major.\n\n\"Certainly not, without your leave,\" said Mrs. Thorne. \"Don't you\nknow that I'm the soul of honour?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nUP IN LONDON.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSome kind and attentive reader may perhaps remember that Miss\nGrace Crawley, in a letter written by her to her friend Miss Lily\nDale, said a word or two of a certain John. \"If it can only be as\nJohn wishes it!\" And the same reader, if there be one so kind and\nattentive, may also remember that Miss Lily Dale had declared,\nin reply, that \"about that other subject she would rather say\nnothing,\"--and then she had added, \"When one thinks of going\nbeyond friendship,--even if one tries to do so,--there are so many\nbarriers!\" From which words the kind and attentive reader, if such\nreader be in such matters intelligent as well as kind and attentive,\nmay have learned a great deal with reference to Miss Lily Dale.\n\nWe will now pay a visit to the John in question,--a certain Mr. John\nEames, living in London, a bachelor, as the intelligent reader will\ncertainly have discovered, and cousin to Miss Grace Crawley. Mr. John\nEames at the time of our story was a young man, some seven or eight\nand twenty years of age, living in London, where he was supposed by\nhis friends in the country to have made his mark, and to be something\na little out of the common way. But I do not know that he was very\nmuch out of the common way, except in the fact that he had had some\nfew thousand pounds left him by an old nobleman, who had been in no\nway related to him, but who had regarded him with great affection,\nand who had died some two years since. Before this, John Eames had\nnot been a very poor man, as he filled the comfortable official\nposition of private secretary to the Chief Commissioner of the\nIncome-tax Board, and drew a salary of three hundred and fifty pounds\na year from the resources of his country; but when, in addition to\nthis source of official wealth, he became known as the undoubted\npossessor of a hundred and twenty-eight shares in one of the most\nprosperous joint-stock banks in the metropolis, which property had\nbeen left to him free of legacy duty by the lamented nobleman above\nnamed, then Mr. John Eames rose very high indeed as a young man\nin the estimation of those who knew him, and was supposed to be\nsomething a good deal out of the common way. His mother, who lived\nin the country, was obedient to his slightest word, never venturing\nto impose upon him any sign of parental authority; and to his\nsister, Mary Eames, who lived with her mother, he was almost a god\nupon earth. To sisters who have nothing of their own,--not even\nsome special god for their own individual worship,--generous,\naffectionate, unmarried brothers, with sufficient incomes, are gods\nupon earth.\n\nAnd even up in London Mr. John Eames was somebody. He was so\nespecially at his office; although, indeed, it was remembered by many\na man how raw a lad he had been when he first came there, not so\nvery many years ago; and how they had laughed at him and played\nhim tricks; and how he had customarily been known to be without a\nshilling for the last week before pay-day, during which period he\nwould borrow sixpence here and a shilling there with great energy,\nfrom men who now felt themselves to be honoured when he smiled upon\nthem. Little stories of his former days would often be told of him\nbehind his back; but they were not told with ill-nature, because\nhe was very constant in referring to the same matters himself.\nAnd it was acknowledged by every one at the office, that neither\nthe friendship of the nobleman, nor the fact of the private\nsecretaryship, nor the acquisition of his wealth, had made him proud\nto his old companions or forgetful of old friendships. To the young\nmen, lads who had lately been appointed, he was perhaps a little\ncold; but then it was only reasonable to conceive that such a one\nas Mr. John Eames was now could not be expected to make an intimate\nacquaintance with every new clerk that might be brought into the\noffice. Since competitive examinations had come into vogue, there was\nno knowing who might be introduced; and it was understood generally\nthrough the establishment,--and I may almost say by the civil service\nat large, so wide was his fame,--that Mr. Eames was very averse\nto the whole theory of competition. The \"Devil take the hindmost\"\nscheme, he called it; and would then go on to explain that hindmost\ncandidates were often the best gentlemen, and that, in this way, the\nDevil got the pick of the flock. And he was respected the more for\nthis opinion, because it was known that on this subject he had fought\nsome hard battles with the chief commissioner. The chief commissioner\nwas a great believer in competition, wrote papers about it, which he\nread aloud to various bodies of the civil service,--not at all to\ntheir delight,--which he got to be printed here and there, and which\nhe sent by post all over the kingdom. More than once this chief\ncommissioner had told his private secretary that they must part\ncompany, unless the private secretary could see fit to alter his\nview, or could, at least, keep his views to himself. But the private\nsecretary would do neither; and, nevertheless, there he was, still\nprivate secretary. \"It's because Johnny has got money,\" said one of\nthe young clerks, who was discussing this singular state of things\nwith his brethren at the office. \"When a chap has got money, he may\ndo what he likes. Johnny has got lots of money, you know.\" The young\nclerk in question was by no means on intimate terms with Mr. Eames,\nbut there had grown up in the office a way of calling him Johnny\nbehind his back, which had probably come down from the early days of\nhis scrapes and his poverty.\n\nNow the entire life of Mr. John Eames was pervaded by a great secret;\nand although he never, in those days, alluded to the subject in\nconversation with any man belonging to the office, yet the secret was\nknown to them all. It had been historical for the last four or five\nyears, and was now regarded as a thing of course. Mr. John Eames was\nin love, and his love was not happy. He was in love, and had long\nbeen in love, and the lady of his love was not kind to him. The\nlittle history had grown to be very touching and pathetic, having\nreceived, no doubt, some embellishments from the imaginations of the\ngentlemen of the Income-tax Office. It was said of him that he had\nbeen in love from his early boyhood, that at sixteen he had been\nengaged, under the sanction of the nobleman now deceased and of the\nyoung lady's parents, that contracts of betrothals had been drawn up,\nand things done very unusual in private families in these days, and\nthat then there had come a stranger into the neighbourhood just as\nthe young lady was beginning to reflect whether she had a heart of\nher own or not, and that she had thrown her parents, and the noble\nlord, and the contract, and poor Johnny Eames to the winds, and had--\nHere the story took different directions, as told by different men.\nSome said the lady had gone off with the stranger, and that there had\nbeen a clandestine marriage, which afterwards turned out to be no\nmarriage at all; others, that the stranger suddenly took himself off,\nand was no more seen by the young lady; others that he owned at last\nto having another wife,--and so on. The stranger was very well known\nto be one Mr. Crosbie, belonging to another public office; and there\nwere circumstances in his life, only half known, which gave rise to\nthese various rumours. But there was one thing certain, one point\nas to which no clerk in the Income-tax Office had a doubt, one fact\nwhich had conduced much to the high position which Mr. John Eames now\nheld in the estimation of his brother clerks,--he had given this Mr.\nCrosbie such a thrashing that no man had ever received such treatment\nbefore and had lived through it. Wonderful stories were told\nabout that thrashing, so that it was believed, even by the least\nenthusiastic in such matters, that the poor victim had only dragged\non a crippled existence since the encounter. \"For nine weeks he never\nsaid a word or eat a mouthful,\" said one young clerk to a younger\nclerk who was just entering the office; \"and even now he can't speak\nabove a whisper, and has to take all his food in pap.\" It will be\nseen, therefore, that Mr. John Eames had about him much of the\nheroic.\n\nThat he was still in love, and in love with the same lady, was known\nto every one in the office. When it was declared of him that in the\nway of amatory expressions he had never in his life opened his mouth\nto another woman, there were those in the office who knew that this\nwas an exaggeration. Mr. Cradell, for instance, who in his early\nyears had been very intimate with John Eames, and who still kept up\nthe old friendship,--although, being a domestic man, with a wife and\nsix young children, and living on a small income, he did not go much\nout among his friends,--could have told a very different story; for\nMrs. Cradell herself had, in days before Cradell had made good his\nclaim upon her, been not unadmired by Cradell's fellow-clerk. But the\nconstancy of Mr. Eames's present love was doubted by none who knew\nhim. It was not that he went about with his stockings ungartered, or\nany of the old acknowledged signs of unrequited affection. In his\nmanner he was rather jovial than otherwise, and seemed to live a\nhappy, somewhat luxurious life, well contented with himself and the\nworld around him. But still he had this passion within his bosom,\nand I am inclined to think that he was a little proud of his own\nconstancy.\n\nIt might be presumed that when Miss Dale wrote to her friend Grace\nCrawley about going beyond friendship, pleading that there were so\nmany \"barriers,\" she had probably seen her way over most of them. But\nthis was not so; nor did John Eames himself at all believe that the\nbarriers were in a way to be overcome. I will not say that he had\ngiven the whole thing up as a bad job, because it was the law of\nhis life that the thing never should be abandoned as long as hope\nwas possible. Unless Miss Dale should become the wife of somebody\nelse, he would always regard himself as affianced to her. He had so\ndeclared to Miss Dale herself and to Miss Dale's mother, and to all\nthe Dale people who had ever been interested in the matter. And there\nwas an old lady living in Miss Dale's neighbourhood, the sister of\nthe lord who had left Johnny Eames the bank shares, who always fought\nhis battles for him, and kept a close look-out, fully resolved that\nJohn Eames should be rewarded at last. This old lady was connected\nwith the Dales by family ties, and therefore had means of close\nobservation. She was in constant correspondence with John Eames, and\nnever failed to acquaint him when any of the barriers were, in her\njudgment, giving way. The nature of some of the barriers may possibly\nbe made intelligible to my readers by the following letter from Lady\nJulia De Guest to her young friend.\n\n\n   Guestwick Cottage, -- December, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR JOHN,--\n\n   I am much obliged to you for going to Jones's. I send\n   stamps for two shillings and fourpence, which is what I\n   owe you. It used only to be two shillings and twopence,\n   but they say everything has got to be dearer now, and\n   I suppose pills as well as other things. Only think\n   of Pritchard coming to me, and saying she wanted her\n   wages raised, after living with me for twenty years! I\n   was _very_ angry, and scolded her roundly; but as she\n   acknowledged she had been wrong, and cried and begged my\n   pardon, I did give her two guineas a year more.\n\n   I saw dear Lily just for a moment on Sunday, and upon my\n   word I think she grows prettier every year. She had a\n   young friend with her,--a Miss Crawley,--who, I believe,\n   is the cousin I have heard you speak of. What is this sad\n   story about her father, the clergyman? Mind you tell me\n   all about it.\n\n   It is quite true what I told you about the De Courcys. Old\n   Lady De Courcy is in London, and Mr. Crosbie is going to\n   law with her about his wife's money. He has been at it\n   in one way or the other ever since poor Lady Alexandrina\n   died. I wish she had lived, with all my heart. For though\n   I feel sure that our Lily will never willingly see him\n   again, yet the tidings of her death disturbed her, and set\n   her thinking of things that were fading from her mind. I\n   rated her soundly, not mentioning your name, however; but\n   she only kissed me, and told me in her quiet drolling way\n   that I didn't mean a word of what I said.\n\n   You can come here whenever you please after the tenth of\n   January. But if you come early in January you must go to\n   your mother first, and come to me for the last week of\n   your holiday. Go to Blackie's in Regent Street, and bring\n   me down all the colours in wool that I ordered. I said you\n   would call. And tell them at Dolland's the last spectacles\n   don't suit at all, and I won't keep them. They had better\n   send me down, by you, one or two more pairs to try. And\n   you had better see Smithers and Smith, in Lincoln's Inn\n   Fields, No. 57--but you have been there before,--and beg\n   them to let me know how my poor dear brother's matters are\n   to be settled at last. As far as I can see I shall be dead\n   before I shall know what income I have got to spend. As\n   to my cousins at the manor, I never see them; and as to\n   talking to them about business, I should not dream of it.\n   She hasn't come to me since she first called, and she may\n   be _quite sure_ I shan't go to her till she does. Indeed\n   I think we shall like each other apart quite as much as\n   we should together. So let me know when you're coming,\n   and _pray_ don't forget to call at Blackie's; nor yet at\n   Dolland's, which is much more important than the wool,\n   because of my eyes getting so weak. But what I want you\n   specially to remember is about Smithers and Smith. How is\n   a woman to live if she doesn't know how much she has got\n   to spend?\n\n   Believe me to be, my dear John,\n   Your most sincere friend,\n\n   JULIA DE GUEST.\n\n\nLady Julia always directed her letters for her young friend to his\noffice, and there he received the one now given to the reader. When\nhe had read it he made a memorandum as to the commissions, and\nthen threw himself back in his arm-chair to think over the tidings\ncommunicated to him. All the facts stated he had known before; that\nLady De Courcy was in London, and that her son-in-law, Mr. Crosbie,\nwhose wife,--Lady Alexandrina,--had died some twelve months since\nat Baden Baden, was at variance with her respecting money which he\nsupposed to be due to him. But there was that in Lady Julia's letter\nwhich was wormwood to him. Lily Dale was again thinking of this\nman, whom she had loved in old days, and who had treated her with\nmonstrous perfidy! It was all very well for Lady Julia to be sure\nthat Lily Dale would never desire to see Mr. Crosbie again; but\nJohn Eames was by no means equally certain that it would be so.\n\"The tidings of her death disturbed her!\" said Johnny, repeating to\nhimself certain words out of the old lady's letter. \"I know they\ndisturbed me. I wish she could have lived for ever. If he ever\nventures to show himself within ten miles of Allington, I'll see if I\ncannot do better than I did the last time I met him!\" Then there came\na knock at the door, and the private secretary, finding himself to\nbe somewhat annoyed by the disturbance at such a moment, bade the\nintruder enter in angry voice. \"Oh, it's you, Cradell, is it? What\ncan I do for you?\" Mr. Cradell, who now entered, and who, as before\nsaid, was an old ally of John Eames, was a clerk of longer standing\nin the department than his friend. In age he looked to be much older,\nand he had left with him none of that appearance of the gloss of\nyouth which will stick for many years to men who are fortunate in\ntheir worldly affairs. Indeed it may be said that Mr. Cradell was\nalmost shabby in his outward appearance, and his brow seemed to be\nladen with care, and his eyes were dull and heavy.\n\n\"I thought I'd just come in and ask you how you are,\" said Cradell.\n\n\"I'm pretty well, thank you; and how are you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm pretty well,--in health, that is. You see one has so many\nthings to think of when one has a large family. Upon my word, Johnny,\nI think you've been lucky to keep out of it.\"\n\n\"I have kept out of it, at any rate; haven't I?\"\n\n\"Of course; living with you as much as I used to do, I know the whole\nstory of what has kept you single.\"\n\n\"Don't mind about that, Cradell; what is it you want?\"\n\n\"I mustn't let you suppose, Johnny, that I'm grumbling about my lot.\nNobody knows better than you what a trump I got in my wife.\"\n\n\"Of course you did;--an excellent woman.\"\n\n\"And if I cut you out a little there, I'm sure you never felt malice\nagainst me for that.\"\n\n\"Never for a moment, old fellow.\"\n\n\"We all have our luck, you know.\"\n\n\"Your luck has been a wife and family. My luck has been to be a\nbachelor.\"\n\n\"You may say a family,\" said Cradell. \"I'm sure that Amelia does the\nbest she can; but we are desperately pushed some times,--desperately\npushed. I never was so bad, Johnny, as I am now.\"\n\n\"So you said the last time.\"\n\n\"Did I? I don't remember it. I didn't think I was so bad then.\nBut, Johnny, if you can let me have one more fiver now I have made\narrangements with Amelia how I'm to pay you off by thirty shillings a\nmonth,--as I get my salary. Indeed I have. Ask her else.\"\n\n\"I'll be shot if I do.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Johnny.\"\n\n\"It's no good your Johnnying me, for I won't be Johnnyed out of\nanother shilling. It comes too often, and there's no reason why I\nshould do it. And what's more, I can't afford it. I've people of my\nown to help.\"\n\n\"But oh, Johnny, we all know how comfortable you are. And I'm sure no\none rejoiced as I did when the money was left to you. If it had been\nmyself I could hardly have thought more of it. Upon my solemn word\nand honour if you'll let me have it this time, it shall be the last.\"\n\n\"Upon my word and honour then, I won't. There must be an end to\neverything.\"\n\nAlthough Mr. Cradell would probably, if pressed, have admitted the\ntruth of this last assertion, he did not seem to think that the end\nhad as yet come to his friend's benevolence. It certainly had not\ncome to his own importunity. \"Don't say that, Johnny; pray don't.\"\n\n\"But I do say it.\"\n\n\"When I told Amelia yesterday evening that I didn't like to go to you\nagain, because of course a man has feelings, she told me to mention\nher name. 'I'm sure he'd do it for my sake,' she said.\"\n\n\"I don't believe she said anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Upon my word she did. You ask her.\"\n\n\"And if she did, she oughtn't to have said it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Johnny, don't speak in that way of her. She's my wife, and you\nknow what your own feelings were once. But look here,--we are in that\nstate at home at this moment, that I must get money somewhere before\nI go home. I must, indeed. If you'll let me have three pounds this\nonce, I'll never ask you again. I'll give you a written promise if\nyou like, and I'll pledge myself to pay it back by thirty shillings\na time out of the two next months' salary. I will, indeed.\" And\nthen Mr. Cradell began to cry. But when Johnny at last took out his\ncheque-book and wrote a cheque for three pounds, Mr. Cradell's eyes\nglistened with joy. \"Upon my word I am so much obliged to you! You\nare the best fellow that ever lived. And Amelia will say the same\nwhen she hears of it.\"\n\n\"I don't believe she'll say anything of the kind, Cradell. If I\nremember anything of her, she has a stouter heart than that.\" Cradell\nadmitted that his wife had a stouter heart than himself, and then\nmade his way back to his own part of the office.\n\nThis little interruption to the current of Mr. Eames's thoughts was,\nI think, for the good of the service, as, immediately on his friend's\ndeparture, he went to his work; whereas, had not he been thus called\naway from his reflections about Miss Dale, he would have sat thinking\nabout her affairs probably for the rest of the morning. As it was, he\nreally did write a dozen notes in answer to as many private letters\naddressed to his chief, Sir Raffle Buffle, in all of which he made\nexcellently-worded false excuses for the non-performance of various\nrequests made to Sir Raffle by the writers. \"He's about the best\nhand at it that I know,\" said Sir Raffle, one day, to the secretary;\n\"otherwise you may be sure I shouldn't keep him there.\" \"I will allow\nthat he is clever,\" said the secretary. \"It isn't cleverness, so much\nas tact. It's what I call tact. I hadn't been long in the service\nbefore I mastered it myself; and now that I've been at the trouble to\nteach him I don't want to have the trouble to teach another. But upon\nmy word he must mind his _p_'s and _q_'s; upon my word he must; and\nyou had better tell him so.\" \"The fact is, Mr. Kissing,\" said the\nprivate secretary the next day to the secretary,--Mr. Kissing was at\nthat time secretary to the board of commissioners for the receipt\nof income tax--\"The fact is, Mr. Kissing, Sir Raffle should never\nattempt to write a letter himself. He doesn't know how to do it. He\nalways says twice too much, and yet not half enough. I wish you'd\ntell him so. He won't believe me.\" From which it will be seen Mr.\nEames was proud of his special accomplishment, but did not feel any\ngratitude to the master who assumed to himself the glory of having\ntaught him. On the present occasion John Eames wrote all his letters\nbefore he thought again of Lily Dale, and was able to write them\nwithout interruption, as the chairman was absent for the day at the\nTreasury,--or perhaps at his club. Then, when he had finished, he\nrang his bell, and ordered some sherry and soda-water, and stretched\nhimself before the fire,--as though his exertions in the public\nservice had been very great,--and seated himself comfortably in his\narm-chair, and lit a cigar, and again took out Lady Julia's letter.\n\nAs regarded the cigar, it may be said that both Sir Raffle and Mr.\nKissing had given orders that on no account should cigars be lit\nwithin the precincts of the Income-tax Office. Mr. Eames had taken\nupon himself to understand that such orders did not apply to a\nprivate secretary, and was well aware that Sir Raffle knew his\nhabit. To Mr. Kissing, I regret to say, he put himself in opposition\nwhenever and wherever opposition was possible; so that men in the\noffice said that one of the two must go at last. \"But Johnny can\ndo anything, you know, because he has got money.\" That was too\nfrequently the opinion finally expressed among the men.\n\nSo John Eames sat down, and drank his soda-water, and smoked his\ncigar, and read his letter; or rather, simply that paragraph of the\nletter which referred to Miss Dale. \"The tidings of her death have\ndisturbed her, and set her thinking again of things that were fading\nfrom her mind.\" He understood it all. And yet how could it possibly\nbe so? How could it be that she should not despise a man,--despise\nhim if she did not hate him,--who had behaved as this man had behaved\nto her? It was now four years since this Crosbie had been engaged to\nMiss Dale, and had jilted her so heartlessly as to incur the disgust\nof every man in London who had heard the story. He had married an\nearl's daughter, who had left him within a few months of their\nmarriage, and now Mr. Crosbie's noble wife was dead. The wife was\ndead, and simply because the man was free again, he, John Eames,\nwas to be told that Miss Dale's mind was \"disturbed,\" and that her\nthoughts were going back to things which had faded from her memory,\nand which should have been long since banished altogether from such\nholy ground.\n\nIf Lily Dale were now to marry Mr. Crosbie, anything so perversely\ncruel as the fate of John Eames would never yet have been told in\nromance. That was his own idea on the matter as he sat smoking his\ncigar. I have said that he was proud of his constancy, and yet, in\nsome sort, he was also ashamed of it. He acknowledged the fact of his\nlove, and believed himself to have out-Jacobed Jacob; but he felt\nthat it was hard for a man who had risen in the world as he had done\nto be made a plaything of by a foolish passion. It was now four years\nago,--that affair of Crosbie,--and Miss Dale should have accepted him\nlong since. Half-a-dozen times he had made up his mind to be very\nstern to her; and he had written somewhat sternly,--but the first\nmoment that he saw her he was conquered again. \"And now that brute\nwill reappear, and everything will be wrong again,\" he said to\nhimself. If the brute did reappear, something should happen of which\nthe world should hear the tidings. So he lit another cigar, and began\nto think what that something should be.\n\nAs he did so he heard a loud noise, as of harsh, rattling winds in\nthe next room, and he knew that Sir Raffle had come back from the\nTreasury. There was a creaking of boots, and a knocking of chairs,\nand a ringing of bells, and then a loud angry voice,--a voice that\nwas very harsh, and on this occasion very angry. Why had not his\ntwelve-o'clock letters been sent up to him to the West End? Why not?\nMr. Eames knew all about it. Why did Mr. Eames know all about it? Why\nhad not Mr. Eames sent them up? Where was Mr. Eames? Let Mr. Eames\nbe sent to him. All which Mr. Eames heard standing with the cigar in\nhis mouth and his back to the fire. \"Somebody has been bullying old\nBuffle, I suppose. After all he has been at the Treasury to-day,\"\nsaid Eames to himself. But he did not stir till the messenger had\nbeen to him, nor even then, at once. \"All right, Rafferty,\" he said;\n\"I'll go in just now.\" Then he took half-a-dozen more whiffs from the\ncigar, threw the remainder into the fire, and opened the door which\ncommunicated between his room and Sir Raffle's.\n\nThe great man was standing with two unopened epistles in his hand.\n\"Eames,\" said he, \"here are letters--\" Then he stopped himself, and\nbegan upon another subject. \"Did I not give express orders that I\nwould have no smoking in the office?\"\n\n\"I think Mr. Kissing said something about it, sir.\"\n\n\"Mr. Kissing! It was not Mr. Kissing at all. It was I. I gave the\norder myself.\"\n\n\"You'll find it began with Mr. Kissing.\"\n\n\"It did not begin with Mr. Kissing; it began and ended with me. What\nare you going to do, sir?\" John Eames had stepped towards the bell,\nand his hand was already on the bell-pull.\n\n\"I was going to ring for the papers, sir.\"\n\n\"And who told you to ring for the papers? I don't want the papers.\nThe papers won't show anything. I suppose my word may be taken\nwithout the papers. Since you're so fond of Mr. Kissing--\"\n\n\"I'm not fond of Mr. Kissing at all.\"\n\n\"You'll have to go back to him, and let somebody come here who will\nnot be too independent to obey my orders. Here are two most important\nletters have been lying here all day, instead of being sent up to me\nat the Treasury.\"\n\n\"Of course they have been lying there. I thought you were at the\nclub.\"\n\n\"I told you I should go to the Treasury. I have been there all the\nmorning with the chancellor,\"--when Sir Raffle spoke officially of\nthe chancellor he was not supposed to mean the Lord Chancellor--\"and\nhere I find letters which I particularly wanted lying upon my desk\nnow. I must put an end to this kind of thing. I must, indeed. If you\nlike the outer office better say so at once, and you can go.\"\n\n\"I'll think about it, Sir Raffle.\"\n\n\"Think about it! What do you mean by thinking about it? But I can't\ntalk about that now. I'm very busy, and shall be here till past\nseven. I suppose you can stay?\"\n\n\"All night, if you wish it, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well. That will do for the present.--I wouldn't have had these\nletters delayed for twenty pounds.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose it would have mattered one straw if both of them\nremained unopened till next week.\" This last little speech, however,\nwas not made aloud to Sir Raffle, but by Johnny to himself in the\nsolitude of his own room.\n\nVery soon after that he went away, Sir Raffle having discovered that\none of the letters in question required his immediate return to the\nWest End. \"I've changed my mind about staying. I shan't stay now. I\nshould have done if these letters had reached me as they ought.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose I can go?\"\n\n\"You can do as you like about that,\" said Sir Raffle.\n\nEames did do as he liked, and went home, or to his club; and as\nhe went he resolved that he would put an end, and at once, to the\npresent trouble of his life. Lily Dale should accept him or reject\nhim; and, taking either the one or the other alternative, she should\nhear a bit of his mind plainly spoken.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nDOWN AT ALLINGTON.\n\n\nIt was Christmas-time down at Allington, and at three o'clock on\nChristmas Eve, just as the darkness of the early winter evening was\ncoming on, Lily Dale and Grace Crawley were seated together, one\nabove the other, on the steps leading up to the pulpit in Allington\nChurch. They had been working all day at the decorations of the\nchurch, and they were now looking round them at the result of their\nhandiwork. To an eye unused to the gloom the place would have been\nnearly dark; but they could see every corner turned by the ivy\nsprigs, and every line on which the holly-leaves were shining.\nAnd the greeneries of the winter had not been stuck up in the\nold-fashioned, idle way, a bough just fastened up here and a twig\ninserted there; but everything had been done with some meaning, with\nsome thought towards the original architecture of the building. The\nGothic lines had been followed, and all the lower arches which it had\nbeen possible to reach with an ordinary ladder had been turned as\ntruly with the laurel cuttings as they had been turned originally\nwith the stone.\n\n\"I wouldn't tie another twig,\" said the elder girl, \"for all the\nChristmas pudding that was ever boiled.\"\n\n\"It's lucky then that there isn't another twig to tie.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that. I see a score of places where the work has\nbeen scamped. This is the sixth time I have done the church, and I\ndon't think I'll ever do it again. When we first began it, Bell and\nI, you know,--before Bell was married,--Mrs. Boyce, and the Boycian\nestablishment generally, used to come and help. Or rather we used to\nhelp her. Now she hardly ever looks after it at all.\"\n\n\"She is older, I suppose.\"\n\n\"She's a little older, and a deal idler. How idle people do get!\nLook at him. Since he has had a curate he hardly ever stirs round\nthe parish. And he is getting so fat that-- H--sh! Here she is\nherself,--come to give her judgment upon us.\" Then a stout lady, the\nwife of the vicar, walked slowly up the aisle. \"Well, girls,\" she\nsaid, \"you have worked hard, and I am sure Mr. Boyce will be very\nmuch obliged to you.\"\n\n\"Mr. Boyce, indeed!\" said Lily Dale. \"We shall expect the whole\nparish to rise from their seats and thank us. Why didn't Jane and\nBessy come and help us?\"\n\n\"They were so tired when they came in from the coal club. Besides,\nthey don't care for this kind of thing,--not as you do.\"\n\n\"Jane is utilitarian to the backbone, I know,\" said Lily, \"and Bessy\ndoesn't like getting up ladders.\"\n\n\"As for ladders,\" said Mrs. Boyce, defending her daughter, \"I am not\nquite sure that Bessy isn't right. You don't mean to say that you did\nall those in the capitals yourself?\"\n\n\"Every twig, with Hopkins to hold the ladder and cut the sticks; and\nas Hopkins is just a hundred and one years old, we could have done it\npretty nearly as well alone.\"\n\n\"I do not think that,\" said Grace.\n\n\"He has been grumbling all the time,\" said Lily, \"and swears he never\nwill have the laurels so robbed again. Five or six years ago he used\nto declare that death would certainly save him from the pain of such\nanother desecration before the next Christmas; but he has given up\nthat foolish notion now, and talks as though he meant to protect the\nAllington shrubs at any rate to the end of this century.\"\n\n\"I am sure we gave our share from the parsonage,\" said Mrs. Boyce,\nwho never understood a joke.\n\n\"All the best came from the parsonage, as of course they ought,\" said\nLily. \"But Hopkins had to make up the deficiency. And as my uncle\ntold him to take the haycart for them instead of the hand-barrow, he\nis broken-hearted.\"\n\n\"I am sure he was very good-natured,\" said Grace.\n\n\"Nevertheless he is broken-hearted; and I am very good-natured too,\nand I am broken-backed. Who is going to preach to-morrow morning,\nMrs. Boyce?\"\n\n\"Mr. Swanton will preach in the morning.\"\n\n\"Tell him not to be long, because of the children's pudding. Tell Mr.\nBoyce if he is long, we won't any of us come next Sunday.\"\n\n\"My dear, how can you say such wicked things! I shall not tell him\nanything of the kind.\"\n\n\"That's not wicked, Mrs. Boyce. If I were to say I had eaten so much\nlunch that I didn't want any dinner, you'd understand that. If Mr.\nSwanton will preach for three-quarters of an hour--\"\n\n\"He only preached for three-quarters of an hour once, Lily.\"\n\n\"He has been over the half-hour every Sunday since he has been here.\nHis average is over forty minutes, and I say it's a shame.\"\n\n\"It is not a shame at all, Lily,\" said Mrs. Boyce, becoming very\nserious.\n\n\"Look at my uncle; he doesn't like to go to sleep, and he has to\nsuffer a purgatory in keeping himself awake.\"\n\n\"If your uncle is heavy, how can Mr. Swanton help it? If Mr. Dale's\nmind were on the subject he would not sleep.\"\n\n\"Come, Mrs. Boyce; there's somebody else sleeps sometimes besides my\nuncle. When Mr. Boyce puts up his finger and just touches his nose,\nI know as well as possible why he does it.\"\n\n\"Lily Dale, you have no business to say so. It is not true. I don't\nknow how you can bring yourself to talk in that way of your own\nclergyman. If I were to tell your mamma she would be shocked.\"\n\n\"You won't be so ill-natured, Mrs. Boyce,--after all that I've done\nfor the church.\"\n\n\"If you'd think more about the clergyman, Lily, and less about the\nchurch,\" said Mrs. Boyce very sententiously, \"more about the matter\nand less about the manner, more of the reality and less of the form,\nI think you'd find that your religion would go further with you. Miss\nCrawley is the daughter of a clergyman, and I'm sure she'll agree\nwith me.\"\n\n\"If she agrees with anybody in scolding me I'll quarrel with her.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to scold you, Lily.\"\n\n\"I don't mind it from you, Mrs. Boyce. Indeed, I rather like it. It\nis a sort of pastoral visitation; and as Mr. Boyce never scolds me\nhimself, of course I take it as coming from him by attorney.\" Then\nthere was silence for a minute or two, during which Mrs. Boyce was\nendeavouring to discover whether Miss Dale was laughing at her or\nnot. As she was not quite certain, she thought at last that she would\nlet the suspected fault pass unobserved. \"Don't wait for us, Mrs.\nBoyce,\" said Lily. \"We must remain till Hopkins has sent Gregory to\nsweep the church out and take away the rubbish. We'll see that the\nkey is left at Mrs. Giles's.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear. Then I may as well go. I thought I'd come in\nand see that it was all right. I'm sure Mr. Boyce will be very much\nobliged to you and Miss Crawley. Good-night, my dear.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Mrs. Boyce; and be sure you don't let Mr. Swanton be\nlong to-morrow.\" To this parting shot Mrs. Boyce made no rejoinder;\nbut she hurried out of the church somewhat the quicker for it, and\nclosed the door after her with something of a slam.\n\nOf all persons clergymen are the most irreverent in the handling of\nthings supposed to be sacred, and next to them clergymen's wives, and\nafter them those other ladies, old or young, who take upon themselves\nsemi-clerical duties. And it is natural that it should be so; for is\nit not said that familiarity does breed contempt? When a parson takes\nhis lay friend over his church on a week day, how much less of the\nspirit of genuflexion and head-uncovering the clergyman will display\nthan the layman! The parson pulls about the woodwork and knocks about\nthe stonework, as though it were mere wood and stone; and talks\naloud in the aisle, and treats even the reading-desk as a common\nthing; whereas the visitor whispers gently, and carries himself as\nthough even in looking at a church he was bound to regard himself as\nperforming some service that was half divine. Now Lily Dale and Grace\nCrawley were both accustomed to churches, and had been so long at\nwork in this church for the last two days, that the building had lost\nto them much of its sacredness, and they were almost as irreverent as\nthough they were two curates.\n\n\"I am so glad she has gone,\" said Lily. \"We shall have to stop here\nfor the next hour, as Gregory won't know what to take away and what\nto leave. I was so afraid she was going to stop and see us off the\npremises.\"\n\n\"I don't know why you should dislike her.\"\n\n\"I don't dislike her. I like her very well,\" said Lily Dale. \"But\ndon't you feel that there are people whom one knows very intimately,\nwho are really friends,--for whom if they were dying one would\ngrieve, whom if they were in misfortune one would go far to help, but\nwith whom for all that one can have no sympathy. And yet they are\nso near to one that they know all the events of one's life, and are\njustified by unquestioned friendship in talking about things which\nshould never be mentioned except where sympathy exists.\"\n\n\"Yes; I understand that.\"\n\n\"Everybody understands it who has been unhappy. That woman sometimes\nsays things to me that make me wish,--wish that they'd make him\nbishop of Patagonia. And yet she does it all in friendship, and mamma\nsays that she is quite right.\"\n\n\"I liked her for standing up for her husband.\"\n\n\"But he does go to sleep,--and then he scratches his nose to show\nthat he's awake. I shouldn't have said it, only she is always hinting\nat uncle Christopher. Uncle Christopher certainly does go to sleep\nwhen Mr. Boyce preaches, and he hasn't studied any scientific little\nmovements during his slumbers to make the people believe that he's\nall alive. I gave him a hint one day, and he got so angry with me!\"\n\n\"I shouldn't have thought he could have been angry with you. It seems\nto me from what you say that you may do whatever you please with\nhim.\"\n\n\"He is very good to me. If you knew it all,--if you could understand\nhow good he has been! I'll try and tell you some day. It is not what\nhe has done that makes me love him so,--but what he has thoroughly\nunderstood, and what, so understanding, he has not done, and what he\nhas not said. It is a case of sympathy. If ever there was a gentleman\nuncle Christopher is one. And I used to dislike him so, at one time!\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Chiefly because he would make me wear brown frocks when I wanted to\nhave them pink or green. And he kept me for six months from having\nthem long, and up to this day he scolds me if there is half an inch\non the ground for him to tread upon.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't mind that if I were you.\"\n\n\"I don't,--not now. But it used to be serious when I was a young\ngirl. And we thought, Bell and I, that he was cross to mamma. He and\nmamma didn't agree at first, you know, as they do now. It is quite\ntrue that he did dislike mamma when we first came here.\"\n\n\"I can't think how anybody could ever dislike Mrs. Dale.\"\n\n\"But he did. And then he wanted to make up a marriage between Bell\nand my cousin Bernard. But neither of them cared a bit for the other,\nand then he used to scold them,--and then,--and then,--and then--Oh,\nhe was so good to me! Here's Gregory at last. Gregory, we've been\nwaiting this hour and a half.\"\n\n\"It ain't ten minutes since Hopkins let me come with the barrows,\nmiss.\"\n\n\"Then Hopkins is a traitor. Never mind. You'd better begin now,--up\nthere at the steps. It'll be quite dark in a few minutes. Here's Mrs.\nGiles with her broom. Come, Mrs. Giles; we shall have to pass the\nnight here if you don't make haste. Are you cold, Grace?\"\n\n\"No; I'm not cold. I'm thinking what they are doing now in the church\nat Hogglestock.\"\n\n\"The Hogglestock church is not pretty;--like this?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. It is a very plain brick building, with something like a\npigeon-house for a belfry. And the pulpit is over the reading-desk,\nand the reading-desk over the clerk, so that papa, when he preaches,\nis nearly up to the ceiling. And the whole place is divided into\npews, in which the farmers hide themselves when they come to church.\"\n\n\"So that nobody can see whether they go to sleep or no. Oh, Mrs.\nGiles, you mustn't pull that down. That's what we have been putting\nup all day.\"\n\n\"But it be in the way, miss; so that the minister can't budge in or\nout o' the door.\"\n\n\"Never mind. Then he must stay one side or the other. That would be\ntoo much after all our trouble!\" And Miss Dale hurried across the\nchancel to save some prettily arching boughs, which, in the judgment\nof Mrs. Giles, encroached too much on the vestry door. \"As if it\nsignified which side he was,\" she said in a whisper to Grace.\n\n\"I don't suppose they'll have anything in the church at home,\" said\nGrace.\n\n\"Somebody will stick up a wreath or two, I daresay.\"\n\n\"Nobody will. There never is anybody at Hogglestock to stick up\nwreaths, or to do anything for the prettinesses of life. And\nnow there will be less done than ever. How can mamma look after\nholly-leaves in her present state? And yet she will miss them, too.\nPoor mamma sees very little that is pretty; but she has not forgotten\nhow pleasant pretty things are.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew your mother, Grace.\"\n\n\"I think it would be impossible for any one to know mamma now,--for\nany one who had not known her before. She never makes even a new\nacquaintance. She seems to think that there is nothing left for her\nin the world but to try and keep papa out of misery. And she does not\nsucceed in that. Poor papa!\"\n\n\"Is he very unhappy about this wicked accusation?\"\n\n\"Yes; he is very unhappy. But, Lily, I don't know about its being\nwicked.\"\n\n\"But you know that it is untrue.\"\n\n\"Of course I know that papa did not mean to take anything that was\nnot his own. But, you see, nobody knows where it came from; and\nnobody except mamma and Jane and I understand how very absent papa\ncan be. I'm sure he doesn't know the least in the world how he came\nby it himself, or he would tell mamma. Do you know, Lily, I think I\nhave been wrong to come away.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, dear. Remember how anxious Mrs. Crawley was that you\nshould come.\"\n\n\"But I cannot bear to be comfortable here while they are so wretched\nat home. It seems such a mockery. Every time I find myself smiling at\nwhat you say to me, I think I must be the most heartless creature in\nthe world.\"\n\n\"Is it so very bad with them, Grace?\"\n\n\"Indeed it is bad. I don't think you can imagine what mamma has to\ngo through. She has to cook all that is eaten in the house, and then,\nvery often, there is no money in the house to buy anything. If you\nwere to see the clothes she wears, even that would make your heart\nbleed. I who have been used to being poor all my life,--even I, when\nI am at home, am dismayed by what she has to endure.\"\n\n\"What can we do for her, Grace?\"\n\n\"You can do nothing, Lily. But when things are like that at home you\ncan understand what I feel in being here.\"\n\nMrs. Giles and Gregory had now completed their task, or had so nearly\ndone so as to make Miss Dale think that she might safely leave the\nchurch. \"We will go in now,\" she said; \"for it is dark and cold, and\nwhat I call creepy. Do you ever fancy that perhaps you will see a\nghost some day?\"\n\n\"I don't think I shall ever see a ghost; but all the same I should be\nhalf afraid to be here alone in the dark.\"\n\n\"I am often here alone in the dark, but I am beginning to think I\nshall never see a ghost now. I am losing all my romance, and getting\nto be an old woman. Do you know, Grace, I do so hate myself for being\nsuch an old maid.\"\n\n\"But who says you're an old maid, Lily?\"\n\n\"I see it in people's eyes, and hear it in their voices. And they\nall talk to me as if I were very steady, and altogether removed from\nanything like fun and frolic. It seems to be admitted that if a girl\ndoes not want to fall in love, she ought not to care for any other\nfun in the world. If anybody made out a list of the old ladies in\nthese parts, they'd put down Lady Julia, and mamma, and Mrs. Boyce,\nand me, and old Mrs. Hearne. The very children have an awful respect\nfor me, and give over playing directly they see me. Well, mamma,\nwe've done at last, and I have had such a scolding from Mrs. Boyce.\"\n\n\"I daresay you deserved it, my dear.\"\n\n\"No, I did not, mamma. Ask Grace if I did.\"\n\n\"Was she not saucy to Mrs. Boyce, Miss Crawley?\"\n\n\"She said that Mr. Boyce scratches his nose in church,\" said Grace.\n\n\"So he does; and goes to sleep, too.\"\n\n\"If you told Mrs. Boyce that, Lily, I think she was quite right to\nscold you.\"\n\nSuch was Miss Lily Dale, with whom Grace Crawley was staying;--Lily\nDale with whom Mr. John Eames, of the Income-tax Office, had been\nso long and so steadily in love, that he was regarded among his\nfellow-clerks as a miracle of constancy,--who had, herself, in former\ndays been so unfortunate in love as to have been regarded among her\nfriends in the country as the most ill-used of women. As John Eames\nhad been able to be comfortable in life,--that is to say, not utterly\na wretch,--in spite of his love, so had she managed to hold up her\nhead, and live as other young women live, in spite of her misfortune.\nBut as it may be said also that his constancy was true constancy,\nalthough he knew how to enjoy the good things of the world, so also\nhad her misfortune been a true misfortune, although she had been able\nto bear it without much outer show of shipwreck. For a few days,--for\na week or two, when the blow first struck her, she had been knocked\ndown, and the friends who were nearest to her had thought that she\nwould never again stand erect upon her feet. But she had been very\nstrong, stout at heart, of a fixed purpose, and capable of resistance\nagainst oppression. Even her own mother had been astonished, and\nsometimes almost dismayed, by the strength of her will. Her mother\nknew well how it was with her now; but they who saw her frequently,\nand who did not know her as her mother knew her,--the Mrs. Boyces of\nher acquaintance,--whispered among themselves that Lily Dale was not\nso soft of heart as people used to think.\n\nOn the next day, Christmas Day, as the reader will remember, Grace\nCrawley was taken up to dine at the big house with the old squire.\nMrs. Dale's eldest daughter, with her husband, Dr. Crofts, was to be\nthere; and also Lily's old friend, who was also especially the old\nfriend of Johnny Eames, Lady Julia De Guest. Grace had endeavoured to\nbe excused from the party, pleading many pleas. But the upshot of all\nher pleas was this,--that while her father's position was so painful\nshe ought not to go out anywhere. In answer to this, Lily Dale,\ncorroborated by her mother, assured her that for her father's sake\nshe ought not to exhibit any such feeling; that in doing so, she\nwould seem to express a doubt as to her father's innocence. Then she\nallowed herself to be persuaded, telling her friend, however, that\nshe knew the day would be very miserable to her. \"It will be very\nhumdrum, if you please,\" said Lily. \"Nothing can be more humdrum than\nChristmas at the Great House. Nevertheless, you must go.\"\n\nComing out of church, Grace was introduced to the old squire. He\nwas a thin, old man, with grey hair, and the smallest possible grey\nwhiskers, with a dry, solemn face; not carrying in his outward gait\nmuch of the customary jollity of Christmas. He took his hat off to\nGrace, and said some word to her as to hoping to have the pleasure\nof seeing her at dinner. It sounded very cold to her, and she became\nat once afraid of him. \"I wish I was not going,\" she said to Lily,\nagain. \"I know he thinks I ought not to go. I shall be so thankful if\nyou will but let me stay.\"\n\n[Illustration: Grace Crawley is introduced to Squire Dale.]\n\n\"Don't be foolish, Grace. It all comes from your not knowing him, or\nunderstanding him. And how should you understand him? I give you my\nword that I would tell you if I did not know that he wishes you to\ngo.\"\n\nShe had to go. \"Of course I haven't a dress fit. How should I?\" she\nsaid to Lily. \"How wrong it is of me to put myself up to such a thing\nas this.\"\n\n\"Your dress is beautiful, child. We are none of us going in evening\ndresses. Pray believe that I will not make you do wrong. If you won't\ntrust me, can't you trust mamma?\"\n\nOf course she went. When the three ladies entered the drawing-room of\nthe Great House they found that Lady Julia had arrived just before\nthem. Lady Julia immediately took hold of Lily, and led her apart,\nhaving a word or two to say about the clerk in the Income-tax Office.\nI am not sure but what the dear old woman sometimes said a few more\nwords than were expedient, with a view to the object which she had so\nclosely at heart. \"John is to be with us the first week in February,\"\nshe said. \"I suppose you'll see him before that, as he'll probably be\nwith his mother a few days before he comes to me.\"\n\n\"I daresay we shall see him quite in time, Lady Julia,\" said Lily.\n\n\"Now, Lily, don't be ill-natured.\"\n\n\"I'm the most good-natured young woman alive, Lady Julia, and as for\nJohnny, he is always made as welcome at the Small House as violets\nin March. Mamma purrs about him when he comes, asking all manner of\nflattering questions as though he were a cabinet minister at least,\nand I always admire some little knicknack that he has got, a new\nring, or a stud, or a button. There isn't another man in all the\nworld whose buttons I'd look at.\"\n\n\"It isn't his buttons, Lily.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's just it. I can go as far as his buttons. But come, Lady\nJulia, this is Christmas-time, and Christmas should be a holiday.\"\n\nIn the meantime Mrs. Dale was occupied with her married daughter and\nher son-in-law, and the squire had attached himself to poor Grace.\n\"You have never been in this part of the country before, Miss\nCrawley,\" he said.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"It is rather pretty just about here, and Guestwick Manor is a fine\nplace in its way, but we have not so much natural beauty as you have\nin Barsetshire. Chaldicote Chase is, I think, as pretty as anything\nin England.\"\n\n\"I never saw Chaldicote Chase, sir. It isn't pretty at all at\nHogglestock, where we live.\"\n\n\"Ah, I forgot. No; it is not very pretty at Hogglestock. That's where\nthe bricks come from.\"\n\n\"Papa is clergyman at Hogglestock.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I remember. Your father is a great scholar. I have often\nheard of him. I am so sorry he should be distressed by this charge\nthey have made. But it will all come right at the assizes. They\nalways get at the truth there. I used to be intimate with a clergyman\nin Barsetshire of the name of Grantly;\"--Grace felt that her ears\nwere tingling, and that her face was red;--\"Archdeacon Grantly. His\nfather was bishop of the diocese.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Archdeacon Grantly lives at Plumstead.\"\n\n\"I was staying once with an old friend of mine, Mr. Thorne of\nUllathorne, who lives close to Plumstead, and saw a good deal of\nthem. I remember thinking Henry Grantly was a very nice lad. He\nmarried afterwards.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; but his wife is dead now, and he has got a little\ngirl,--Edith Grantly.\"\n\n\"Is there no other child?\"\n\n\"No, sir; only Edith.\"\n\n\"You know him, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I know Major Grantly,--and Edith. I never saw Archdeacon\nGrantly.\"\n\n\"Then, my dear, you never saw a very famous pillar of the church.\nI remember when people used to talk a great deal about Archdeacon\nGrantly; but when his time came to be made a bishop, he was not\nsufficiently new-fangled; and so he got passed by. He is much better\noff as he is, I should say. Bishops have to work very hard, my dear.\"\n\n\"Do they, sir?\"\n\n\"So they tell me. And the archdeacon is a wealthy man. So Henry\nGrantly has got an only daughter? I hope she is a nice child, for\nI remember liking him well.\"\n\n\"She is a very nice child, indeed, Mr. Dale. She could not be\nnicer. And she is so lovely.\" Then Mr. Dale looked into his young\ncompanion's face, struck by the sudden animation of her words, and\nperceived for the first time that she was very pretty.\n\nAfter this Grace became accustomed to the strangeness of the faces\nround her, and managed to eat her dinner without much perturbation of\nspirit. When after dinner the squire proposed to her that they should\ndrink the health of her papa and mamma, she was almost reduced to\ntears, and yet she liked him for doing it. It was terrible to her to\nhave them mentioned, knowing as she did that every one who mentioned\nthem must be aware of their misery,--for the misfortune of her father\nhad become notorious in the country; but it was almost more terrible\nto her that no allusion should be made to them; for then she would be\ndriven to think that her father was regarded as a man whom the world\ncould not afford to mention. \"Papa and mamma,\" she just murmured,\nraising her glass to her lips. \"Grace, dear,\" said Lily from across\nthe table, \"here's papa and mamma, and the young man at Marlborough\nwho is carrying everything before him.\" \"Yes; we won't forget the\nyoung man at Marlborough,\" said the squire. Grace felt this to be\ngood-natured, because her brother at Marlborough was the one bright\nspot in her family,--and she was comforted.\n\n\"And we will drink the health of my friend, John Eames,\" said Lady\nJulia.\n\n\"John Eames' health,\" said the squire, in a low voice.\n\n\"Johnny's health,\" said Mrs. Dale; but Mrs. Dale's voice was not very\nbrisk.\n\n\"John's health,\" said Dr. Crofts and Mrs. Crofts in a breath.\n\n\"Here's the health of Johnny Eames,\" said Lily; and her voice was the\nclearest and the boldest of them all. But she made up her mind that\nif Lady Julia could not be induced to spare her for the future, she\nand Lady Julia must quarrel. \"No one can understand,\" she said to her\nmother that evening, \"how dreadful it is,--this being constantly told\nbefore one's family and friends that one ought to marry a certain\nyoung man.\"\n\n\"She didn't say that, my dear.\"\n\n\"I should much prefer that she should, for then I could get up on\nmy legs and answer her off the reel.\" Of course everybody there\nunderstood what she meant,--including old John Bates, who stood at\nthe sideboard and coolly drank the toast himself.\n\n\"He always does that to all the family toasts on Christmas Day. Your\nuncle likes it.\"\n\n\"That wasn't a family toast, and John Bates had no right to drink\nit.\"\n\nAfter dinner they all played cards,--a round game,--and the squire\nput in the stakes. \"Now, Grace,\" said Lily, \"you are the visitor and\nyou must win, or else uncle Christopher won't be happy. He always\nlikes a young lady visitor to win.\"\n\n\"But I never played a game of cards in my life.\"\n\n\"Go and sit next to him and he'll teach you. Uncle Christopher, won't\nyou teach Grace Crawley? She never saw a Pope Joan board in her life\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Come here, my dear, and sit next to me. Dear, dear, dear; fancy\nHenry Grantly having a little girl. What a handsome lad he was. And\nit seems only yesterday.\" If it was so that Lily had said a word to\nher uncle about Grace and the major, the old squire had become on a\nsudden very sly. Be that as it may, Grace Crawley thought that he was\na pleasant old man; and though, while talking to him about Edith, she\npersisted in not learning to play Pope Joan, so that he could not\ncontrive that she should win, nevertheless the squire took to her\nvery kindly, and told her to come up with Lily and see him sometimes\nwhile she was staying at the Small House. The squire in speaking of\nhis sister-in-law's cottage always called it the Small House.\n\n\"Only think of my winning,\" said Lady Julia, drawing together her\nwealth. \"Well, I'm sure I want it bad enough, for I don't at all know\nwhether I've got any income of my own. It's all John Eames' fault, my\ndear, for he won't go and make those people settle it in Lincoln's\nInn Fields.\" Poor Lily, who was standing on the hearth-rug, touched\nher mother's arm. She knew that Johnny's name was lugged in with\nreference to Lady Julia's money altogether for her benefit. \"I\nwonder whether she ever had a Johnny of her own,\" she said to her\nmother, \"and, if so, whether she liked it when her friends sent the\ntown-crier round to talk about him.\"\n\n\"She means to be good-natured,\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\"Of course she does. But it is such a pity when people won't\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"My uncle didn't bite you after all, Grace,\" said Lily to her friend\nas they were going home at night, by the pathway which led from the\ngarden of one house to the garden of the other.\n\n\"I like Mr. Dale very much,\" said Grace. \"He was very kind to me.\"\n\n\"There is some queer-looking animal of whom they say that he is\nbetter than he looks, and I always think of that saying when I think\nof my uncle.\"\n\n\"For shame, Lily,\" said her mother. \"Your uncle, for his age, is as\ngood a looking man as I know. And he always looks like just what he\nis,--an English gentleman.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to say a word against his dear old face and figure,\nmamma; but his heart, and mind, and general disposition, as they come\nout in experience and days of trial, are so much better than the\nsamples of them which he puts out on the counter for men and women\nto judge by. He wears well, and he washes well,--if you know what I\nmean, Grace.\"\n\n\"Yes; I think I know what you mean.\"\n\n\"The Apollos of the world,--I don't mean in outward looks,\nmamma,--but the Apollos in heart, the men,--and the women too,--who\nare so full of feeling, so soft-natured, so kind, who never say\na cross word, who never get out of bed on the wrong side in the\nmorning,--it so often turns out that they won't wash.\"\n\nSuch was the expression of Miss Lily Dale's experience.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nMR. CRAWLEY IS SUMMONED TO BARCHESTER.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe scene which occurred in Hogglestock church on the Sunday after\nMr. Thumble's first visit to that parish had not been described with\nabsolute accuracy either by the archdeacon in his letter to his son,\nor by Mrs. Thorne. There had been no footman from the palace in\nattendance on Mr. Thumble, nor had there been a battle with the\nbrickmakers; neither had Mr. Thumble been put under the pump. But Mr.\nThumble had gone over, taking his gown and surplice with him, on the\nSunday morning, and had intimated to Mr. Crawley his intention of\nperforming the service. Mr. Crawley, in answer to this, had assured\nMr. Thumble that he would not be allowed to open his mouth in the\nchurch; and Mr. Thumble, not seeing his way to any further successful\naction, had contented himself with attending the services in his\nsurplice, making thereby a silent protest that he, and not Mr.\nCrawley, ought to have been in the reading-desk and the pulpit.\n\nWhen Mr. Thumble reported himself and his failure at the palace,\nhe strove hard to avoid seeing Mrs. Proudie, but not successfully.\nHe knew something of the palace habits, and did manage to reach\nthe bishop alone on the Sunday evening, justifying himself to his\nlordship for such an interview by the remarkable circumstances of\nthe case and the importance of his late mission. Mrs. Proudie always\nwent to church on Sunday evenings, making a point of hearing three\nservices and three sermons every Sunday of her life. On week-days\nshe seldom heard any, having an idea that week-day services were an\ninvention of the High Church enemy, and that they should therefore be\nvehemently discouraged. Services on saints' days she regarded as rank\npapacy, and had been known to accuse a clergyman's wife, to her face,\nof idolatry, because the poor lady had dated a letter, St. John's\nEve. Mr. Thumble, on this Sunday evening, was successful in finding\nthe bishop at home, and alone, but he was not lucky enough to get\naway before Mrs. Proudie returned. The bishop, perhaps, thought that\nthe story of the failure had better reach his wife's ears from Mr.\nThumble's lips than from his own.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Thumble?\" said Mrs. Proudie, walking into the study, armed\nin her full Sunday-evening winter panoply, in which she had just\ndescended from her carriage. The church which Mrs. Proudie attended\nin the evening was nearly half a mile from the palace, and the\ncoachman and groom never got a holiday on Sunday night. She was\ngorgeous in a dark brown silk dress of awful stiffness and terrible\ndimensions; and on her shoulders she wore a short cloak of velvet and\nfur, very handsome withal, but so swelling in its proportions on all\nsides as necessarily to create more of dismay than of admiration in\nthe mind of any ordinary man. And her bonnet was a monstrous helmet\nwith the beaver up, displaying the awful face of the warrior, always\nready for combat, and careless to guard itself from attack. The large\ncontorted bows which she bore were as a grisly crest upon her casque,\nbeautiful, doubtless, but majestic and fear-compelling. In her hand\nshe carried her armour all complete, a prayer-book, a bible, and a\nbook of hymns. These the footman had brought for her to the study\ndoor, but she had thought fit to enter her husband's room with them\nin her own custody.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Thumble!\" she said.\n\nMr. Thumble did not answer at once, thinking, probably, that the\nbishop might choose to explain the circumstances. But, neither did\nthe bishop say any thing.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Thumble?\" she said again; and then she stood looking at\nthe man who had failed so disastrously.\n\n\"I have explained to the bishop,\" said he. \"Mr. Crawley has been\ncontumacious,--very contumacious indeed.\"\n\n\"But you preached at Hogglestock?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, Mrs. Proudie. Nor would it have been possible, unless\nI had had the police to assist me.\"\n\n\"Then you should have had the police. I never heard of anything so\nmismanaged in all my life,--never in all my life.\" And she put her\nbooks down on the study table, and turned herself round from Mr.\nThumble towards the bishop. \"If things go on like this, my lord,\" she\nsaid, \"your authority in the diocese will very soon be worth nothing\nat all.\" It was not often that Mrs. Proudie called her husband my\nlord, but when she did do so, it was a sign that terrible times had\ncome;--times so terrible that the bishop would know that he must\neither fight or fly. He would almost endure anything rather than\ndescend into the arena for the purpose of doing battle with his wife,\nbut occasions would come now and again when even the alternative of\nflight was hardly left to him.\n\n\"But, my dear,--\" began the bishop.\n\n\"Am I to understand that this man has professed himself to be\naltogether indifferent to the bishop's prohibition?\" said Mrs.\nProudie, interrupting her husband and addressing Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"Quite so. He seemed to think that the bishop had no lawful power in\nthe matter at all,\" said Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"Do you hear that, my lord?\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"Nor have I any,\" said the bishop, almost weeping as he spoke.\n\n\"No authority in your own diocese!\"\n\n\"None to silence a man merely by my own judgment. I thought, and\nstill think, that it was for this gentleman's own interest, as well\nas for the credit of the Church, that some provision should be made\nfor his duties during his present,--present--difficulties.\"\n\n\"Difficulties indeed! Everybody knows that the man has been a thief.\"\n\n\"No, my dear; I do not know it.\"\n\n\"You never know anything, bishop.\"\n\n\"I mean to say that I do not know it officially. Of course I have\nheard the sad story; and, though I hope it may not be the--\"\n\n\"There is no doubt about its truth. All the world knows it. He has\nstolen twenty pounds, and yet he is to be allowed to desecrate the\nChurch, and imperil the souls of the people!\" The bishop got up from\nhis chair and began to walk backwards and forwards through the room\nwith short quick steps. \"It only wants five days to Christmas Day,\"\ncontinued Mrs. Proudie, \"and something must be done at once. I say\nnothing as to the propriety or impropriety of his being out on bail,\nas it is no affair of ours. When I heard that he had been bailed by a\nbeneficed clergyman of this diocese, of course I knew where to look\nfor the man who would act with so much impropriety. Of course I was\nnot surprised when I found that that person belonged to Framley.\nBut, as I have said before, that is no business of ours. I hope, Mr.\nThumble, that the bishop will never be found interfering with the\nordinary laws of the land. I am very sure that he will never do so by\nmy advice. But when there comes a question of inhibiting a clergyman\nwho has committed himself as this clergyman unfortunately has done,\nthen I say that that clergyman ought to be inhibited.\" The bishop\nwalked up and down the room throughout the whole of this speech, but\ngradually his steps became quicker, and his turns became shorter.\n\"And now here is Christmas Day upon us, and what is to be done?\" With\nthese words Mrs. Proudie finished her speech.\n\n\"Mr. Thumble,\" said the bishop, \"perhaps you had better now retire.\nI am very sorry that you should have had so thankless and so\ndisagreeable a task.\"\n\n\"Why should Mr. Thumble retire?\" asked Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"I think it better,\" said the bishop. \"Mr. Thumble, good night.\" Then\nMr. Thumble did retire, and Mrs. Proudie stood forth in her full\npanoply of armour, silent and awful, with her helmet erect, and\nvouchsafed no recognition whatever of the parting salutation with\nwhich Mr. Thumble greeted her. \"My dear, the truth is, you do not\nunderstand the matter,\" said the bishop as soon as the door was\nclosed. \"You do not know how limited is my power.\"\n\n\"Bishop, I understand it a great deal better than some people; and I\nunderstand also what is due to myself and the manner in which I ought\nto be treated by you in the presence of the subordinate clergy of the\ndiocese. I shall not, however, remain here to be insulted either in\nthe presence or in the absence of any one.\" Then the conquered amazon\ncollected together the weapons which she had laid upon the table, and\ntook her departure with majestic step, and not without the clang of\narms. The bishop, when he was left alone, enjoyed for a few moments\nthe triumph of his victory.\n\nBut then he was left so very much alone! When he looked round about\nhim upon his solitude after the departure of his wife, and remembered\nthat he should not see her again till he should encounter her on\nground that was all her own, he regretted his own success, and was\ntempted to follow her and to apologize. He was unable to do anything\nalone. He would not even know how to get his tea, as the very\nservants would ask questions, if he were to do so unaccustomed\na thing as to order it to be brought up to him in his solitude.\nThey would tell him that Mrs. Proudie was having tea in her little\nsitting-room upstairs, or else that the things were laid in the\ndrawing-room. He did wander forth to the latter apartment, hoping\nthat he might find his wife there; but the drawing-room was dark\nand deserted, and so he wandered back again. It was a grand thing\ncertainly to have triumphed over his wife, and there was a crumb\nof comfort in the thought that he had vindicated himself before Mr.\nThumble; but the general result was not comforting, and he knew from\nof old how short-lived his triumph would be.\n\nBut wretched as he was during that evening he did employ himself with\nsome energy. After much thought he resolved that he would again write\nto Mr. Crawley, and summon him to appear at the palace. In doing this\nhe would at any rate be doing something. There would be action. And\nthough Mr. Crawley would, as he thought, decline to obey the order,\nsomething would be gained even by that disobedience. So he wrote\nhis summons,--sitting very comfortless and all alone on that Sunday\nevening,--dating his letter, however, for the following day:--\n\n\n   Palace, December 20, 186--.\n\n   REVEREND SIR,\n\n   I have just heard from Mr. Thumble that you have declined\n   to accede to the advice which I thought it my duty to\n   tender to you as the bishop who has been set over you by\n   the Church, and that you yesterday insisted on what you\n   believed to be your right, to administer the services in\n   the parish church of Hogglestock. This has occasioned me\n   the deepest regret. It is, I think, unavailing that I\n   should further write to you my mind upon the subject, as\n   I possess such strong evidence that my written word will\n   not be respected by you. I have, therefore, no alternative\n   now but to invite you to come to me here; and this I do,\n   hoping that I may induce you to listen to that authority\n   which I cannot but suppose you acknowledge to be vested in\n   the office which I hold.\n\n   I shall be glad to see you on to-morrow, Tuesday, as near\n   the hour of two as you can make it convenient to yourself\n   to be here, and I will take care to order that refreshment\n   shall be provided for yourself and your horse.\n\n   I am, Reverend Sir,\n   &c. &c. &c.,\n\n   THOS. BARNUM.\n\n\n\"My dear,\" he said, when he did again encounter his wife that night,\n\"I have written to Mr. Crawley, and I thought I might as well bring\nup the copy of my letter.\"\n\n\"I wash my hands of the whole affair,\" said Mrs. Proudie--\"of the\nwhole affair!\"\n\n\"But you will look at the letter?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. Why should I look at the letter? My word goes for\nnothing. I have done what I could, but in vain. Now let us see how\nyou will manage it yourself.\"\n\nThe bishop did not pass a comfortable night; but in the morning\nhis wife did read his letter, and after that things went a little\nsmoother with him. She was pleased to say that, considering all\nthings; seeing, as she could not help seeing, that the matter\nhad been dreadfully mismanaged, and that great weakness had been\ndisplayed;--seeing that these faults had already been committed,\nperhaps no better step could now be taken than that proposed in the\nletter.\n\n\"I suppose he will not come,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"I think he will,\" said Mrs. Proudie, \"and I trust that we may be\nable to convince him that obedience will be his best course. He will\nbe more humble-minded here than at Hogglestock.\" In saying this the\nlady showed some knowledge of the general nature of clergymen and of\nthe world at large. She understood how much louder a cock can crow in\nits own farmyard than elsewhere, and knew that episcopal authority,\nbacked by all the solemn awe of palatial grandeur, goes much further\nthan it will do when sent under the folds of an ordinary envelope.\nBut though she understood ordinary human nature, it may be that she\ndid not understand Mr. Crawley's nature.\n\nBut she was at any rate right in her idea as to Mr. Crawley's\nimmediate reply. The palace groom who rode over to Hogglestock\nreturned with an immediate answer.\n\n\"MY LORD\"--said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\n   I will obey your lordship's summons, and, unless\n   impediments should arise, I will wait upon your lordship\n   at the hour you name to-morrow. I will not trespass on\n   your hospitality. For myself, I rarely break bread in any\n   house but my own; and as to the horse, I have none.\n\n   I have the honour to be,\n   My lord, &c. &c.,\n\n   JOSIAH CRAWLEY.\n\n\n\"Of course I shall go,\" he had said to his wife as soon as he had had\ntime to read the letter, and make known to her the contents. \"I shall\ngo if it be possible for me to get there. I think that I am bound to\ncomply with the bishop's wishes in so much as that.\"\n\n\"But how will you get there, Josiah?\"\n\n\"I will walk,--with the Lord's aid.\"\n\nNow Hogglestock was fifteen miles from Barchester, and Mr. Crawley\nwas, as his wife well knew, by no means fitted in his present state\nfor great physical exertion. But from the tone in which he had\nreplied to her, she well knew that it would not avail for her to\nremonstrate at the moment. He had walked more than thirty miles in a\nday since they had been living at Hogglestock, and she did not doubt\nbut that it might be possible for him to do it again. Any scheme,\nwhich she might be able to devise for saving him from so terrible\na journey in the middle of winter, must be pondered over silently,\nand brought to bear, if not slyly, at least deftly, and without\ndiscussion. She made no reply therefore when he declared that on\nthe following day he would walk to Barchester and back,--with the\nLord's aid; nor did she see, or ask to see the note which he sent\nto the bishop. When the messenger was gone, Mr. Crawley was all\nalert, looking forward with evident glee to his encounter with the\nbishop,--snorting like a racehorse at the expected triumph of the\ncoming struggle. And he read much Greek with Jane on that afternoon,\npouring into her young ears, almost with joyous rapture, his\nappreciation of the glory and the pathos and the humanity, as also of\nthe awful tragedy, of the story of Oedipus. His very soul was on fire\nat the idea of clutching the weak bishop in his hand, and crushing\nhim with his strong grasp.\n\nIn the afternoon Mrs. Crawley slipped out to a neighbouring farmer's\nwife, and returned in an hour's time with a little story which she\ndid not tell with any appearance of eager satisfaction. She had\nlearned well what were the little tricks necessary to the carrying\nof such a matter as that which she had now in hand. Mr. Mangle, the\nfarmer, as it happened, was going to-morrow morning in his tax-cart\nas far as Framley Mill, and would be delighted if Mr. Crawley\nwould take a seat. He must remain at Framley the best part of\nthe afternoon, and hoped that Mr. Crawley would take a seat back\nagain. Now Framley Mill was only half a mile off the direct road to\nBarchester, and was almost half way from Hogglestock parsonage to the\ncity. This would, at any rate, bring the walk within a practicable\ndistance. Mr. Crawley was instantly placed upon his guard, like an\nanimal that sees the bait and suspects the trap. Had he been told\nthat farmer Mangle was going all the way to Barchester, nothing would\nhave induced him to get into the cart. He would have felt sure that\nfarmer Mangle had been persuaded to pity him in his poverty and his\nstrait, and he would sooner have started to walk to London than have\nput a foot upon the step of the cart. But this lift half way did look\nto him as though it were really fortuitous. His wife could hardly\nhave been cunning enough to persuade the farmer to go to Framley,\nconscious that the trap would have been suspected had the bait been\nmade more full. But I fear,--I fear the dear good woman had been thus\ncunning,--had understood how far the trap might be baited, and had\nthus succeeded in catching her prey.\n\nOn the following morning he consented to get into farmer Mangle's\ncart, and was driven as far as Framley Mill. \"I wouldn't think\nnowt, your reverence, of running you over into Barchester,--that I\nwouldn't. The powny is so mortial good,\" said farmer Mangle in his\nfoolish good-nature.\n\n[Illustration: Farmer Mangle and Mr. Crawley.]\n\n\"And how about your business here?\" said Mr. Crawley. The farmer\nscratched his head, remembering all Mrs. Crawley's injunctions, and\nawkwardly acknowledged that to be sure his own business with the\nmiller was very pressing. Then Mr. Crawley descended, terribly\nsuspicious, and went on his journey.\n\n\"Anyways, your reverence will call for me coming back?\" said farmer\nMangle. But Mr. Crawley would make no promise. He bade the farmer not\nwait for him. If they chanced to meet together on the road he might\nget up again. If the man really had business at Framley, how could\nhe have offered to go on to Barchester? Were they deceiving him? The\nwife of his bosom had deceived him in such matters before now. But\nhis trouble in this respect was soon dissipated by the pride of his\nanticipated triumph over the bishop. He took great glory from the\nthought that he would go before the bishop with dirty boots,--with\nboots necessarily dirty,--with rusty pantaloons, that he would be hot\nand mud-stained with his walk, hungry, and an object to be wondered\nat by all who should see him, because of the misfortunes which had\nbeen unworthily heaped upon his head; whereas the bishop would be\nsleek and clean and well-fed,--pretty with all the prettinesses that\nare becoming to a bishop's outward man. And he, Mr. Crawley, would be\nhumble, whereas the bishop would be very proud. And the bishop would\nbe in his own arm-chair,--the cock in his own farmyard, while he, Mr.\nCrawley, would be seated afar off, in the cold extremity of the room,\nwith nothing of outward circumstances to assist him,--a man called\nthither to undergo censure. And yet he would take the bishop in his\ngrasp and crush him,--crush him,--crush him! As he thought of this\nhe walked quickly through the mud, and put out his long arm and his\ngreat hand, far before him out into the air, and, there and then, he\ncrushed the bishop in his imagination. Yes, indeed! He thought it\nvery doubtful whether the bishop would ever send for him a second\ntime. As all this passed through his mind, he forgot his wife's\ncunning, and farmer Mangle's sin, and for the moment he was happy.\n\nAs he turned a corner round by Lord Lufton's park paling, who should\nhe meet but his old friend Mr. Robarts, the parson of Framley,--the\nparson who had committed the sin of being bail for him,--the sin,\nthat is, according to Mrs. Proudie's view of the matter. He was\nwalking with his hand still stretched out,--still crushing the\nbishop, when Mr. Robarts was close upon him.\n\n\"What, Crawley! upon my word I am very glad to see you; you are\ncoming up to me, of course?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Robarts; no, not to-day. The bishop has summoned me\nto his presence, and I am on my road to Barchester.\"\n\n\"But how are you going?\"\n\n\"I shall walk.\"\n\n\"Walk to Barchester. Impossible!\"\n\n\"I hope not quite impossible, Mr. Robarts. I trust I shall get as\nfar before two o'clock; but to do so I must be on my road.\" Then\nhe showed signs of a desire to go on upon his way without further\nparley.\n\n\"But, Crawley, do let me send you over. There is the horse and gig\ndoing nothing.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Robarts; no. I should prefer the walk to-day.\"\n\n\"And you have walked from Hogglestock?\"\n\n\"No;--not so. A neighbour coming hither, who happened to have\nbusiness at your mill,--he brought me so far in his cart. The walk\nhome will be nothing,--nothing. I shall enjoy it. Good morning, Mr.\nRobarts.\"\n\nBut Mr. Robarts thought of the dirty road, and of the bishop's\npresence, and of his own ideas of what would be becoming for a\nclergyman,--and persevered. \"You will find the lanes so very muddy;\nand our bishop, you know, is apt to notice such things. Do be\npersuaded.\"\n\n\"Notice what things?\" demanded Mr. Crawley, in an indignant tone.\n\n\"He, or perhaps she rather, will say how dirty your shoes were when\nyou came to the palace.\"\n\n\"If he, or she, can find nothing unclean about me but my shoes,\nlet them say their worst. I shall be very indifferent. I have long\nceased, Mr. Robarts, to care much what any man or woman may say\nabout my shoes. Good morning.\" Then he stalked on, clutching and\ncrushing in his hand the bishop, and the bishop's wife, and the whole\ndiocese,--and all the Church of England. Dirty shoes, indeed! Whose\nwas the fault that there were in the church so many feet soiled by\nunmerited poverty, and so many hands soiled by undeserved wealth? If\nthe bishop did not like his shoes, let the bishop dare to tell him\nso! So he walked on through the thick of the mud, by no means picking\nhis way.\n\nHe walked fast, and he found himself in the close half an hour before\nthe time named by the bishop. But on no account would he have rung\nthe palace bell one minute before two o'clock. So he walked up and\ndown under the towers of the cathedral, and cooled himself, and\nlooked up at the pleasant plate-glass in the windows of the house of\nhis friend the dean, and told himself how, in their college days, he\nand the dean had been quite equal,--quite equal, except that by the\nvoices of all qualified judges in the university, he, Mr. Crawley,\nhad been acknowledged to be the riper scholar. And now the Mr. Arabin\nof those days was Dean of Barchester,--travelling abroad luxuriously\nat this moment for his delight, while he, Crawley, was perpetual\ncurate at Hogglestock, and had now walked into Barchester at the\ncommand of the bishop, because he was suspected of having stolen\ntwenty pounds! When he had fully imbued his mind with the injustice\nof all this, his time was up, and he walked boldly to the bishop's\ngate, and boldly rang the bishop's bell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE BISHOP OF BARCHESTER IS CRUSHED.\n\n\nWho inquires why it is that a little greased flour rubbed in among\nthe hair on a footman's head,--just one dab here and another\nthere,--gives such a tone of high life to the family? And seeing\nthat the thing is so easily done, why do not more people attempt it?\nThe tax on hair-powder is but thirteen shillings a year. It may,\nindeed, be that the slightest dab in the world justifies the wearer\nin demanding hot meat three times a day, and wine at any rate on\nSundays. I think, however, that a bishop's wife may enjoy the\nprivilege without such heavy attendant expense; otherwise the man who\nopened the bishop's door to Mr. Crawley would hardly have been so\nornamented.\n\nThe man asked for a card. \"My name is Mr. Crawley,\" said our friend.\n\"The bishop has desired me to come to him at this hour. Will you be\npleased to tell him that I am here.\" The man again asked for a card.\n\"I am not bound to carry with me my name printed on a ticket,\" said\nMr. Crawley. \"If you cannot remember it, give me pen and paper, and I\nwill write it.\" The servant, somewhat awed by the stranger's manner,\nbrought the pen and paper, and Mr. Crawley wrote his name:--\n\n\n   THE REV. JOSIAH CRAWLEY, M.A.,\n   _Perpetual Curate of Hogglestock._\n\n\nHe was then ushered into a waiting-room, but, to his disappointment,\nwas not kept there waiting long. Within three minutes he was ushered\ninto the bishop's study, and into the presence of the two great\nluminaries of the diocese. He was at first somewhat disconcerted by\nfinding Mrs. Proudie in the room. In the imaginary conversation with\nthe bishop which he had been preparing on the road, he had conceived\nthat the bishop would be attended by a chaplain, and he had suited\nhis words to the joint discomfiture of the bishop and of the lower\nclergyman;--but now the line of his battle must be altered. This\nwas no doubt an injury, but he trusted to his courage and readiness\nto enable him to surmount it. He had left his hat behind him in\nthe waiting-room, but he kept his old short cloak still upon his\nshoulders; and when he entered the bishop's room his hands and arms\nwere hid beneath it. There was something lowly in this constrained\ngait. It showed at least that he had no idea of being asked to\nshake hands with the August persons he might meet. And his head was\nsomewhat bowed, though his great, bald, broad forehead showed itself\nso prominent, that neither the bishop nor Mrs. Proudie could drop it\nfrom their sight during the whole interview. He was a man who when\nseen could hardly be forgotten. The deep angry remonstrant eyes, the\nshaggy eyebrows, telling tales of frequent anger,--of anger frequent\nbut generally silent,--the repressed indignation of the habitual\nfrown, the long nose and large powerful mouth, the deep furrows\non the cheek, and the general look of thought and suffering, all\ncombined to make the appearance of the man remarkable, and to\ndescribe to the beholders at once his true character. No one ever on\nseeing Mr. Crawley took him to be a happy man, or a weak man, or an\nignorant man, or a wise man.\n\n\"You are very punctual, Mr. Crawley,\" said the bishop. Mr. Crawley\nsimply bowed his head, still keeping his hands beneath his cloak.\n\"Will you not take a chair nearer to the fire?\" Mr. Crawley had not\nseated himself, but had placed himself in front of a chair at the\nextreme end of the room,--resolved that he would not use it unless he\nwere duly asked.\n\n\"Thank you, my lord,\" he said, \"I am warm with walking, and, if you\nplease, will avoid the fire.\"\n\n\"You have not walked, Mr. Crawley?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord. I have been walking.\"\n\n\"Not from Hogglestock!\"\n\nNow this was a matter which Mr. Crawley certainly did not mean to\ndiscuss with the bishop. It might be well for the bishop to demand\nhis presence in the palace, but it could be no part of the bishop's\nduty to inquire how he got there. \"That, my lord, is a matter of no\nmoment,\" said he. \"I am glad at any rate that I have been enabled to\nobey your lordship's order in coming hither on this morning.\"\n\nHitherto Mrs. Proudie had not said a word. She stood back in the\nroom, near the fire,--more backward a good deal than she was\naccustomed to do when clergymen made their ordinary visits. On\nsuch occasions she would come forward and shake hands with them\ngraciously,--graciously even, if proudly; but she had felt that she\nmust do nothing of that kind now; there must be no shaking hands with\na man who had stolen a cheque for twenty pounds! It might probably be\nnecessary to keep Mr. Crawley at a distance, and therefore she had\nremained in the background. But Mr. Crawley seemed to be disposed to\nkeep himself in the background, and therefore she could speak. \"I\nhope your wife and children are well, Mr. Crawley,\" she said.\n\n\"Thank you, madam, my children are well, and Mrs. Crawley suffers no\nspecial ailment at present.\"\n\n\"That is much to be thankful for, Mr. Crawley.\" Whether he were or\nwere not thankful for such mercies as these was no business of the\nbishop or of the bishop's wife. That was between him and his God. So\nhe would not even bow to this civility, but sat with his head erect,\nand with a great frown on his heavy brow.\n\nThen the bishop rose from his chair to speak, intending to take up\na position on the rug. But as he did so Mr. Crawley, who had seated\nhimself on an intimation that he was expected to sit down, rose also,\nand the bishop found that he would thus lose his expected vantage.\n\"Will you not be seated, Mr. Crawley?\" said the bishop. Mr. Crawley\nsmiled, but stood his ground. Then the bishop returned to his\narm-chair, and Mr. Crawley also sat down again. \"Mr. Crawley,\"\nbegan the bishop, \"this matter which came the other day before the\nmagistrates at Silverbridge has been a most unfortunate affair. It\nhas given me, I can assure you, the most sincere pain.\"\n\nMr. Crawley had made up his mind how far the bishop should be allowed\nto go without a rebuke. He had told himself that it would only be\nnatural, and would not be unbecoming, that the bishop should allude\nto the meeting of the magistrates and to the alleged theft, and that\ntherefore such allusion should be endured with patient humility.\nAnd, moreover, the more rope he gave the bishop, the more likely the\nbishop would be to entangle himself. It certainly was Mr. Crawley's\nwish that the bishop should entangle himself. He, therefore, replied\nvery meekly, \"It has been most unfortunate, my lord.\"\n\n\"I have felt for Mrs. Crawley very deeply,\" said Mrs. Proudie. Mr.\nCrawley had now made up his mind that as long as it was possible he\nwould ignore the presence of Mrs. Proudie altogether; and, therefore,\nhe made no sign that he had heard the latter remark.\n\n\"It has been most unfortunate,\" continued the bishop. \"I have never\nbefore had a clergyman in my diocese placed in so distressing a\nposition.\"\n\n\"That is a matter of opinion, my lord,\" said Mr. Crawley, who at that\nmoment thought of a crisis which had come in the life of another\nclergyman in the diocese of Barchester, with the circumstances of\nwhich he had by chance been made acquainted.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said the bishop. \"And I am expressing my opinion.\" Mr.\nCrawley, who understood fighting, did not think that the time had\nyet come for striking a blow, so he simply bowed again. \"A most\nunfortunate position, Mr. Crawley,\" continued the bishop. \"Far be it\nfrom me to express an opinion upon the matter, which will have to\ncome before a jury of your countrymen. It is enough for me to know\nthat the magistrates assembled at Silverbridge, gentlemen to whom no\ndoubt you must be known, as most of them live in your neighbourhood,\nhave heard evidence upon the subject--\"\n\n\"Most convincing evidence,\" said Mrs. Proudie, interrupting her\nhusband. Mr. Crawley's black brow became a little blacker as he heard\nthe word, but still he ignored the woman. He not only did not speak,\nbut did not turn his eye upon her.\n\n\"They have heard the evidence on the subject,\" continued the bishop,\n\"and they have thought it proper to refer the decision as to your\ninnocence or your guilt to a jury of your countrymen.\"\n\n\"And they were right,\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"Very possibly. I don't deny it. Probably,\" said the bishop, whose\neloquence was somewhat disturbed by Mr. Crawley's ready acquiescence.\n\n\"Of course they were right,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"At any rate it is so,\" said the bishop. \"You are in the position of\na man amenable to the criminal laws of the land.\"\n\n\"There are no criminal laws, my lord,\" said Mr. Crawley; \"but to such\nlaws as there are we are all amenable,--your lordship and I alike.\"\n\n\"But you are so in a very particular way. I do not wish to remind\nyou what might be your condition now, but for the interposition of\nprivate friends.\"\n\n\"I should be in the condition of a man not guilty before the\nlaw;--guiltless, as far as the law goes,--but kept in durance, not\nfor faults of his own, but because otherwise, by reason of laches in\nthe police, his presence at the assizes might not be ensured. In such\na position a man's reputation is made to hang for awhile on the trust\nwhich some friends or neighbours may have in it. I do not say that\nthe test is a good one.\"\n\n\"You would have been put in prison, Mr. Crawley, because the\nmagistrates were of opinion that you had taken Mr. Soames's cheque,\"\nsaid Mrs. Proudie. On this occasion he did look at her. He turned one\nglance upon her from under his eyebrows, but he did not speak.\n\n\"With all that I have nothing to do,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"Nothing whatever, my lord,\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"But, bishop, I think that you have,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"The\njudgment formed by the magistrates as to the conduct of one of your\nclergymen makes it imperative upon you to act in the matter.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, yes; I am coming to that. What Mrs. Proudie says is\nperfectly true. I have been constrained most unwillingly to take\naction in this matter. It is undoubtedly the fact that you must at\nthe next assizes surrender yourself at the court-house yonder, to be\ntried for this offence against the laws.\"\n\n\"That is true. If I be alive, my lord, and have strength sufficient,\nI shall be there.\"\n\n\"You must be there,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"The police will look to\nthat, Mr. Crawley.\" She was becoming very angry in that the man would\nnot answer her a word. On this occasion again he did not even look at\nher.\n\n\"Yes; you will be there,\" said the bishop. \"Now that is, to say the\nleast of it, an unseemly position for a beneficed clergyman.\"\n\n\"You said before, my lord, that it was an unfortunate position, and\nthe word, methinks, was better chosen.\"\n\n\"It is very unseemly, very unseemly indeed,\" said Mrs. Proudie;\n\"nothing could possibly be more unseemly. The bishop might very\nproperly have used a much stronger word.\"\n\n\"Under these circumstances,\" continued the bishop, \"looking to the\nwelfare of your parish, to the welfare of the diocese, and allow me\nto say, Mr. Crawley, to the welfare of yourself also--\"\n\n\"And especially to the souls of the people,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\nThe bishop shook his head. It is hard to be impressively eloquent\nwhen one is interrupted at every best turned period, even by a\nsupporting voice. \"Yes;--and looking of course to the religious\ninterests of your people, Mr. Crawley, I came to the conclusion\nthat it would be expedient that you should cease your ministrations\nfor awhile.\" The bishop paused, and Mr. Crawley bowed his head.\n\"I, therefore, sent over to you a gentleman with whom I am well\nacquainted, Mr. Thumble, with a letter from myself, in which I\nendeavoured to impress upon you, without the use of any severe\nlanguage, what my convictions were.\"\n\n\"Severe words are often the best mercy,\" said Mrs. Proudie. Mr.\nCrawley had raised his hand, with his finger out, preparatory to\nanswering the bishop. But as Mrs. Proudie had spoken he dropped his\nfinger and was silent.\n\n\"Mr. Thumble brought me back your written reply,\" continued the\nbishop, \"by which I was grieved to find that you were not willing to\nsubmit yourself to my counsel in the matter.\"\n\n\"I was most unwilling, my lord. Submission to authority is at times a\nduty;--and at times opposition to authority is a duty also.\"\n\n\"Opposition to just authority cannot be a duty, Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"Opposition to usurped authority is an imperative duty,\" said Mr.\nCrawley.\n\n\"And who is to be the judge?\" demanded Mrs. Proudie. Then there was\nsilence for a while; when, as Mr. Crawley made no reply, the lady\nrepeated her question. \"Will you be pleased to answer my question,\nsir? Who, in such a case, is to be the judge?\" But Mr. Crawley did\nnot please to answer her question. \"The man is obstinate,\" said Mrs.\nProudie.\n\n\"I had better proceed,\" said the bishop. \"Mr. Thumble brought me back\nyour reply, which grieved me greatly.\"\n\n\"It was contumacious and indecent,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\nThe bishop again shook his head and looked so unutterably miserable\nthat a smile came across Mr. Crawley's face. After all, others\nbesides himself had their troubles and trials. Mrs. Proudie saw\nand understood the smile, and became more angry than ever. She drew\nher chair close to the table, and began to fidget with her fingers\namong the papers. She had never before encountered a clergyman so\ncontumacious, so indecent, so unreverend,--so upsetting. She had had\nto do with men difficult to manage;--the archdeacon for instance;\nbut the archdeacon had never been so impertinent to her as this man.\nShe had quarrelled once openly with a chaplain of her husband's, a\nclergyman whom she herself had introduced to her husband, and who had\ntreated her very badly;--but not so badly, not with such unscrupulous\nviolence, as she was now encountering from this ill-clothed beggarly\nman, this perpetual curate, with his dirty broken boots, this already\nhalf-convicted thief! Such was her idea of Mr. Crawley's conduct to\nher, while she was fingering the papers,--simply because Mr. Crawley\nwould not speak to her.\n\n\"I forget where I was,\" said the bishop. \"Oh. Mr. Thumble came back,\nand I received your letter;--of course I received it. And I was\nsurprised to learn from that, that in spite of what had occurred at\nSilverbridge, you were still anxious to continue the usual Sunday\nministrations in your church.\"\n\n\"I was determined that I would do my duty at Hogglestock, as long as\nI might be left there to do it,\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"Duty!\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"Just a moment, my dear,\" said the bishop. \"When Sunday came, I had\nno alternative but to send Mr. Thumble over again to Hogglestock. It\noccurred to us,--to me and Mrs. Proudie,--\"\n\n\"I will tell Mr. Crawley just now what has occurred to me,\" said Mrs.\nProudie.\n\n\"Yes;--just so. And I am sure that he will take it in good part. It\noccurred to me, Mr. Crawley, that your first letter might have been\nwritten in haste.\"\n\n\"It was written in haste, my lord; your messenger was waiting.\"\n\n\"Yes;--just so. Well; so I sent him again, hoping that he might be\naccepted as a messenger of peace. It was a most disagreeable mission\nfor any gentleman, Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"Most disagreeable, my lord.\"\n\n\"And you refused him permission to obey the instructions which I had\ngiven him! You would not let him read from your desk, or preach from\nyour pulpit.\"\n\n\"Had I been Mr. Thumble,\" said Mrs. Proudie, \"I would have read from\nthat desk and I would have preached from that pulpit.\"\n\nMr. Crawley waited a moment, thinking that the bishop might perhaps\nspeak again; but as he did not, but sat expectant as though he had\nfinished his discourse, and now expected a reply, Mr. Crawley got up\nfrom his seat and drew near to the table. \"My lord,\" he began, \"it\nhas all been just as you have said. I did answer your first letter in\nhaste.\"\n\n\"The more shame for you,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"And therefore, for aught I know, my letter to your lordship may be\nso worded as to need some apology.\"\n\n\"Of course it needs an apology,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"But for the matter of it, my lord, no apology can be made, nor is\nany needed. I did refuse to your messenger permission to perform the\nservices of my church, and if you send twenty more, I shall refuse\nthem all,--till the time may come when it will be your lordship's\nduty, in accordance with the laws of the Church,--as borne out and\nbacked by the laws of the land, to provide during my constrained\nabsence for the spiritual wants of those poor people at Hogglestock.\"\n\n\"Poor people, indeed,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"Poor wretches!\"\n\n\"And, my lord, it may well be, that it shall soon be your lordship's\nduty to take due and legal steps for depriving me of my benefice at\nHogglestock;--nay, probably, for silencing me altogether as to the\nexercise of my sacred profession!\"\n\n\"Of course it will, sir. Your gown will be taken from you,\" said Mrs.\nProudie. The bishop was looking with all his eyes up at the great\nforehead and great eyebrows of the man, and was so fascinated by the\npower that was exercised over him by the other man's strength that he\nhardly now noticed his wife.\n\n\"It may well be so,\" continued Mr. Crawley. \"The circumstances\nare strong against me; and, though your lordship has altogether\nmisunderstood the nature of the duty performed by the magistrates in\nsending my case for trial,--although, as it seems to me, you have\ncome to conclusions in this matter in ignorance of the very theory of\nour laws,--\"\n\n\"Sir!\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"Yet I can foresee the probability that a jury may discover me to\nhave been guilty of theft.\"\n\n\"Of course the jury will do so,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"Should such verdict be given, then, my lord, your interference will\nbe legal, proper, and necessary. And you will find that, even if it\nbe within my power to oppose obstacles to your lordship's authority,\nI will oppose no such obstacle. There is, I believe, no appeal in\ncriminal cases.\"\n\n\"None at all,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"There is no appeal against your\nbishop. You should have learned that before.\"\n\n\"But till that time shall come, my lord, I shall hold my own at\nHogglestock as you hold your own here at Barchester. Nor have you\nmore power to turn me out of my pulpit by your mere voice, than I\nhave to turn you out of your throne by mine. If you doubt me, my\nlord, your lordship's ecclesiastical court is open to you. Try it\nthere.\"\n\n\"You defy us, then?\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"My lord, I grant your authority as bishop to be great, but even a\nbishop can only act as the law allows him.\"\n\n\"God forbid that I should do more,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"Sir, you will find that your wicked threats will fall back upon your\nown head,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"Peace, woman,\" Mr. Crawley said, addressing her at last. The bishop\njumped out of his chair at hearing the wife of his bosom called a\nwoman. But he jumped rather in admiration than in anger. He had\nalready begun to perceive that Mr. Crawley was a man who had better\nbe left to take care of the souls at Hogglestock, at any rate till\nthe trial should come on.\n\n\"Woman!\" said Mrs. Proudie, rising to her feet as though she really\nintended some personal encounter.\n\n\"Madam,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"you should not interfere in these\nmatters. You simply debase your husband's high office. The distaff\nwere more fitting for you. My lord, good morning.\" And before either\nof them could speak again, he was out of the room, and through the\nhall, and beyond the gate, and standing beneath the towers of the\ncathedral. Yes, he had, he thought, in truth crushed the bishop. He\nhad succeeded in crumpling the bishop up within the clutch of his\nfist.\n\nHe started in a spirit of triumph to walk back on his road towards\nHogglestock. He did not think of the long distance before him for\nthe first hour of his journey. He had had his victory, and the\nremembrance of that braced his nerves and gave elasticity to his\nsinews, and he went stalking along the road with rapid strides,\nmuttering to himself from time to time as he went along some word\nabout Mrs. Proudie and her distaff. Mr. Thumble would not, he\nthought, come to him again,--not, at any rate, till the assizes were\ndrawing near. And he had resolved what he would do then. When the\nday of his trial was near, he would himself write to the bishop, and\nbeg that provision might be made for his church, in the event of the\nverdict going against him. His friend, Dean Arabin, was to be home\nbefore that time, and the idea had occurred to him of asking the\ndean to see to this; but now the other would be the more independent\ncourse, and the better. And there was a matter as to which he was not\naltogether well pleased with the dean, although he was so conscious\nof his own peculiarities as to know that he could hardly trust\nhimself for a judgment. But, at any rate, he would apply to the\nbishop,--to the bishop whom he had just left prostrate in his\npalace,--when the time of his trial should be close at hand.\n\nFull of such thoughts as these he went along almost gaily, nor felt\nthe fatigue of the road till he had covered the first five miles out\nof Barchester. It was nearly four o'clock, and the thick gloom of\nthe winter evening was making itself felt. And then he began to be\nfatigued. He had not as yet eaten since he had left his home in the\nmorning, and he now pulled a crust out of his pocket and leaned\nagainst a gate as he crunched it. There were still ten miles before\nhim, and he knew that such an addition to the work he had already\ndone would task him very severely. Farmer Mangle had told him that he\nwould not leave Framley Mill till five, and he had got time to reach\nFramley Mill by that time. But he had said that he would not return\nto Framley Mill, and he remembered his suspicion that his wife and\nfarmer Mangle between them had cozened him. No; he would persevere\nand walk,--walk, though he should drop upon the road. He was now\nnearer fifty than forty years of age, and hardships as well as time\nhad told upon him. He knew that though his strength was good for the\ncommencement of a hard day's work, it would not hold out for him as\nit used to do. He knew that the last four miles in the dark night\nwould be very sad with him. But still he persevered, endeavouring, as\nhe went, to cherish himself with the remembrance of his triumph.\n\nHe passed the turning going down to Framley with courage, but when\nhe came to the further turning, by which the cart would return\nfrom Framley to the Hogglestock road, he looked wistfully down the\nroad for farmer Mangle. But farmer Mangle was still at the mill,\nwaiting in expectation that Mr. Crawley might come to him. But the\npoor traveller paused here barely for a minute, and then went on,\nstumbling through the mud, striking his ill-covered feet against the\nrough stones in the dark, sweating in his weakness, almost tottering\nat times, and calculating whether his remaining strength would serve\nto carry him home. He had almost forgotten the bishop and his wife\nbefore at last he grasped the wicket gate leading to his own door.\n\n\"Oh, mamma, here is papa!\"\n\n\"But where is the cart? I did not hear the wheels,\" said Mrs.\nCrawley.\n\n\"Oh, mamma, I think papa is ill.\" Then the wife took her drooping\nhusband by both arms and strove to look him in the face. \"He has\nwalked all the way, and he is ill,\" said Jane.\n\n\"No, my dear, I am very tired, but not ill. Let me sit down, and\ngive me some bread and tea, and I shall recover myself.\" Then Mrs.\nCrawley, from some secret hoard, got him a small modicum of spirits,\nand gave him meat and tea, and he was docile; and, obeying her\nbehests, allowed himself to be taken to his bed.\n\n\"I do not think the bishop will send for me again,\" he said, as she\ntucked the clothes around him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nWHERE DID IT COME FROM?\n\n\nWhen Christmas morning came no emissary from the bishop appeared at\nHogglestock to interfere with the ordinary performance of the day's\nservices. \"I think we need fear no further disturbance,\" Mr. Crawley\nsaid to his wife,--and there was no further disturbance.\n\nOn the day after his walk from Framley to Barchester, and from\nBarchester back to Hogglestock, Mr. Crawley had risen not much the\nworse for his labour, and had gradually given to his wife a full\naccount of what had taken place. \"A poor weak man,\" he said, speaking\nof the bishop. \"A poor weak creature, and much to be pitied.\"\n\n\"I have always heard that she is a violent woman.\"\n\n\"Very violent, and very ignorant; and most intrusive withal.\"\n\n\"And you did not answer her a word?\"\n\n\"At last my forbearance with her broke down, and I bade her mind her\ndistaff.\"\n\n\"What;--really? Did you say those words to her?\"\n\n\"Nay; as for my exact words I cannot remember them. I was thinking\nmore of the words with which it might be fitting that I should answer\nthe bishop. But I certainly told her that she had better mind her\ndistaff.\"\n\n\"And how did she behave then?\"\n\n\"I did not wait to see. The bishop had spoken, and I had replied; and\nwhy should I tarry to behold the woman's violence? I had told him\nthat he was wrong in law, and that I at least would not submit to\nusurped authority. There was nothing to keep me longer, and so I went\nwithout much ceremony of leave-taking. There had been little ceremony\nof greeting on their part, and there was less in the making of adieux\non mine. They had told me that I was a thief--\"\n\n\"No, Josiah,--surely not so? They did not use that very word?\"\n\n\"I say they did;--they did use the very word. But stop. I am wrong.\nI wrong his lordship, and I crave pardon for having done so. If my\nmemory serve me, no expression so harsh escaped from the bishop's\nmouth. He gave me, indeed, to understand more than once that the\naction taken by the magistrates was tantamount to a conviction,\nand that I must be guilty because they had decided that there was\nevidence sufficient to justify a trial. But all that arose from my\nlord's ignorance of the administration of the laws of his country.\nHe was very ignorant,--puzzle-pated, as you may call it,--led by the\nnose by his wife, weak as water, timid, and vacillating. But he did\nnot wish, I think, to be insolent. It was Mrs. Proudie who told me to\nmy face that I was a--thief.\"\n\n\"May she be punished for the cruel word!\" said Mrs. Crawley. \"May the\nremembrance that she has spoken it come, some day, heavily upon her\nheart!\"\n\n\"'Vengeance is mine. I will repay,' saith the Lord,\" answered Mr.\nCrawley. \"We may safely leave all that alone, and rid our minds of\nsuch wishes, if it be possible. It is well, I think, that violent\noffences, when committed, should be met by instant rebuke. To turn\nthe other cheek instantly to the smiter can hardly be suitable in\nthese days, when the hands of so many are raised to strike. But the\nreturn blow should be given only while the smart remains. She hurt\nme then; but what is it to me now, that she called me a thief to my\nface? Do I not know that, all the country round, men and women are\ncalling me the same behind my back?\"\n\n\"No, Josiah, you do not know that. They say that the thing is very\nstrange,--so strange that it requires a trial; but no one thinks you\nhave taken that which was not your own.\"\n\n\"I think I did. I myself think I took that which was not my own. My\npoor head suffers so;--so many grievous thoughts distract me, that\nI am like a child, and know not what I do.\" As he spoke thus he put\nboth hands up to his head, leaning forward as though in anxious\nthought,--as though he were striving to bring his mind to bear with\naccuracy upon past events. \"It could not have been mine, and yet--\"\nThen he sat silent, and made no effort to continue his speech.\n\n\"And yet?\"--said his wife, encouraging him to proceed. If she could\nonly learn the real truth, she thought that she might perhaps yet\nsave him, with assistance from their friends.\n\n\"When I said that I had gotten it from that man I must have been\nmad.\"\n\n\"From which man, love?\"\n\n\"From the man Soames,--he who accuses me. And yet, as the Lord hears\nme, I thought so then. The truth is, that there are times when I\nam not--sane. I am not a thief,--not before God; but I am--mad at\ntimes.\" These last words he spoke very slowly, in a whisper,--without\nany excitement,--indeed with a composure which was horrible to\nwitness. And what he said was the more terrible because she was so\nwell convinced of the truth of his words. Of course he was no thief.\nShe wanted no one to tell her that. As he himself had expressed it,\nhe was no thief before God, however the money might have come into\nhis possession. That there were times when his reason, once so\nfine and clear, could not act, could not be trusted to guide him\nright, she had gradually come to know with fear and trembling. But\nhe himself had never before hinted his own consciousness of this\ncalamity. Indeed he had been so unwilling to speak of himself and of\nhis own state, that she had been unable even to ask him a question\nabout the money,--lest he should suspect that she suspected him. Now\nhe was speaking,--but speaking with such heartrending sadness that\nshe could hardly urge him to go on.\n\n\"You have sometimes been ill, Josiah, as any of us may be,\" she said,\n\"and that has been the cause.\"\n\n\"There are different kinds of sickness. There is sickness of the\nbody, and sickness of the heart, and sickness of the spirit;--and\nthen there is sickness of the mind, the worst of all.\"\n\n\"With you, Josiah, it has chiefly been the first.\"\n\n\"With me, Mary, it has been all of them,--every one! My spirit is\nbroken, and my mind has not been able to keep its even tenour amidst\nthe ruins. But I will strive. I will strive. I will strive still. And\nif God helps me, I will prevail.\" Then he took up his hat and cloak,\nand went forth among the lanes; and on this occasion his wife was\nglad that he should go alone.\n\nThis occurred a day or two before Christmas, and Mrs. Crawley during\nthose days said nothing more to her husband on the subject which he\nhad so unexpectedly discussed. She asked him no questions about the\nmoney, or as to the possibility of his exercising his memory, nor did\nshe counsel him to plead that the false excuses given by him for his\npossession of the cheque had been occasioned by the sad slip to which\nsorrow had in those days subjected his memory and his intellect. But\nthe matter had always been on her mind. Might it not be her paramount\nduty to do something of this at the present moment? Might it not be\nthat his acquittal or conviction would depend on what she might now\nlearn from him? It was clear to her that he was brighter in spirit\nsince his encounter with the Proudies than he had ever been since the\naccusation had been first made against him. And she knew well that\nhis present mood would not be of long continuance. He would fall\nagain into his moody silent ways, and then the chance of learning\naught from him would be past, and perhaps, for ever.\n\nHe performed the Christmas services with nothing of special\ndespondency in his tone or manner, and his wife thought that she\nhad never heard him give the sacrament with more impressive dignity.\nAfter the service he stood awhile at the churchyard gate, and\nexchanged a word of courtesy as to the season with such of the\nfamilies of the farmers as had stayed for the Lord's supper.\n\n\"I waited at Framley for your reverence till arter six,--so I did,\"\nsaid farmer Mangle.\n\n\"I kept the road, and walked the whole way,\" said Mr. Crawley. \"I\nthink I told you that I should not return to the mill. But I am not\nthe less obliged by your great kindness.\"\n\n\"Say nowt o' that,\" said the farmer. \"No doubt I had business at the\nmill,--lots to do at the mill.\" Nor did he think that the fib he was\ntelling was at all incompatible with the Holy Sacrament in which he\nhad just taken a part.\n\nThe Christmas dinner at the parsonage was not a repast that did much\nhonour to the season, but it was a better dinner than the inhabitants\nof that house usually saw on the board before them. There was roast\npork and mince-pies, and a bottle of wine. As Mrs. Crawley with her\nown hand put the meat upon the table, and then, as was her custom in\ntheir house, proceeded to cut it up, she looked at her husband's face\nto see whether he was scrutinizing the food with painful eye. It was\nbetter that she should tell the truth at once than that she should\nbe made to tell it, in answer to a question. Everything on the table,\nexcept the bread and potatoes, had come in a basket from Framley\nCourt. Pork had been sent instead of beef, because people in the\ncountry, when they kill their pigs, do sometimes give each other\npork,--but do not exchange joints of beef, when they slay their oxen.\nAll this was understood by Mrs. Crawley, but she almost wished that\nbeef had been sent, because beef would have attracted less attention.\nHe said, however, nothing to the meat; but when his wife proposed to\nhim that he should eat a mince-pie he resented it. \"The bare food,\"\nsaid he, \"is bitter enough, coming as it does; but that would choke\nme.\" She did not press it, but eat one herself, as otherwise her girl\nwould have been forced also to refuse the dainty.\n\nThat evening, as soon as Jane was in bed, she resolved to ask him\nsome further questions. \"You will have a lawyer, Josiah,--will you\nnot?\" she said.\n\n\"Why should I have a lawyer?\"\n\n\"Because he will know what questions to ask, and how questions on the\nother side should be answered.\"\n\n\"I have no questions to ask, and there is only one way in which\nquestions should be answered. I have no money to pay a lawyer.\"\n\n\"But, Josiah, in such a case as this, where your honour, and our very\nlife depend upon it--\"\n\n\"Depend on what?\"\n\n\"On your acquittal.\"\n\n\"I shall not be acquitted. It is as well to look it in the face at\nonce. Lawyer, or no lawyer, they will say that I took the money. Were\nI upon the jury, trying the case myself, knowing all that I know\nnow,\"--and as he said this he struck forth with his hands into the\nair,--\"I think that I should say so myself. A lawyer will do no good.\nIt is here. It is here.\" And again he put his hands up to his head.\n\nSo far she had been successful. At this moment it had in truth been\nher object to induce him to speak of his own memory, and not of the\naid that a lawyer might give. The proposition of the lawyer had been\nbrought in to introduce the subject.\n\n\"But, Josiah,--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nIt was very hard for her to speak. She could not bear to torment him\nby any allusion to his own deficiencies. She could not endure to make\nhim think that she suspected him of any frailty either in intellect\nor thought. Wifelike, she desired to worship him, and that he should\nknow that she worshipped him. But if a word might save him! \"Josiah,\nwhere did it come from?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said he; \"yes; that is the question. Where did it come\nfrom?\"--and he turned sharp upon her, looking at her with all the\npower of his eyes. \"It is because I cannot tell you where it came\nfrom that I ought to be,--either in Bedlam, as a madman, or in the\ncounty gaol as a thief.\" The words were so dreadful to her that she\ncould not utter at the moment another syllable. \"How is a man--to\nthink himself--fit--for a man's work, when he cannot answer his wife\nsuch a plain question as that?\" Then he paused again. \"They should\ntake me to Bedlam at once,--at once,--at once. That would not\ndisgrace the children as the gaol will do.\"\n\nMrs. Crawley could ask no further questions on that evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nWHAT MR. WALKER THOUGHT ABOUT IT.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt had been suggested to Mr. Robarts, the parson of Framley, that\nhe should endeavour to induce his old acquaintance, Mr. Crawley, to\nemploy a lawyer to defend him at his trial, and Mr. Robarts had not\nforgotten the commission which he had undertaken. But there were\ndifficulties in the matter of which he was well aware. In the first\nplace Mr. Crawley was a man whom it had not at any time been easy\nto advise on matters private to himself; and, in the next place,\nthis was a matter on which it was very hard to speak to the man\nimplicated, let him be who he would. Mr. Robarts had come round to\nthe generally accepted idea that Mr. Crawley had obtained possession\nof the cheque illegally,--acquitting his friend in his own mind\nof theft, simply by supposing that he was wool-gathering when the\ncheque came in his way. But in speaking to Mr. Crawley, it would be\nnecessary,--so he thought,--to pretend a conviction that Mr. Crawley\nwas as innocent in fact as in intention.\n\nHe had almost made up his mind to dash at the subject when he met Mr.\nCrawley walking through Framley to Barchester, but he had abstained,\nchiefly because Mr. Crawley had been too quick for him, and had got\naway. After that he resolved that it would be almost useless for\nhim to go to work unless he should be provided with a lawyer ready\nand willing to undertake the task; and as he was not so provided\nat present, he made up his mind that he would go into Silverbridge,\nand see Mr. Walker, the attorney there. Mr. Walker always advised\neverybody in those parts about everything, and would be sure to\nknow what would be the proper thing to be done in this case. So\nMr. Robarts got into his gig, and drove himself into Silverbridge,\npassing very close to Mr. Crawley's house on his road. He drove at\nonce to Mr. Walker's office, and on arriving there found that the\nattorney was not at that moment within. But Mr. Winthrop was within.\nWould Mr. Robarts see Mr. Winthrop? Now, seeing Mr. Winthrop was\na very different thing from seeing Mr. Walker, although the two\ngentlemen were partners. But still Mr. Robarts said that he would see\nMr. Winthrop. Perhaps Mr. Walker might return while he was there.\n\n\"Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. Robarts?\" asked Mr.\nWinthrop. Mr. Robarts said that he had wished to see Mr. Walker\nabout that poor fellow Crawley. \"Ah, yes; very sad case! So much\nsadder being a clergyman, Mr. Robarts. We are really quite sorry for\nhim;--we are indeed. We wouldn't have touched the case ourselves\nif we could have helped ourselves. We wouldn't indeed. But we are\nobliged to take all that business here. At any rate he'll get nothing\nbut fair usage from us.\"\n\n\"I am sure of that. You don't know whether he has employed any lawyer\nas yet to defend him?\"\n\n\"I can't say. We don't know, you know. I should say he had,--probably\nsome Barchester attorney. Borleys and Bonstock in Barchester are very\ngood people,--very good people indeed;--for that sort of business I\nmean, Mr. Robarts. I don't suppose they have much county property in\ntheir hands.\"\n\nMr. Robarts knew that Mr. Winthrop was a fool, and that he could get\nno useful advice from him. So he suggested that he would take his gig\ndown to the inn, and call back again before long. \"You'll find that\nWalker knows no more than I do about it,\" said Mr. Winthrop, \"but\nof course he'll be glad to see you if he happens to come in.\" So Mr.\nRobarts went to the inn, put up his horse, and then, as he sauntered\nback up the street, met Mr. Walker coming out of the private door of\nhis house.\n\n\"I've been at home all the morning,\" he said, \"but I've had a stiff\njob of work on hand, and told them to say in the office that I was\nnot in. Seen Winthrop, have you? I don't suppose he did know that\nI was here. The clerks often know more than the partners. About Mr.\nCrawley is it? Come into my dining-room, Mr. Robarts, where we shall\nbe alone. Yes;--it is a bad case; a very bad case. The pity is that\nanybody should ever have said anything about it. Lord bless me, if\nI'd been Soames I'd have let him have the twenty pounds. Lord Lufton\nwould never have allowed Soames to lose it.\"\n\n\"But Soames wanted to find out the truth.\"\n\n\"Yes;--that was just it. Soames couldn't bear to think that he should\nbe left in the dark, and then, when the poor man said that Soames had\npaid the cheque to him in the way of business,--it was not odd that\nSoames' back should have been up, was it? But, Mr. Robarts, I should\nhave thought a deal about it before I should have brought such a man\nas Mr. Crawley before a bench of magistrates on that charge.\"\n\n\"But between you and me, Mr. Walker, did he steal the money?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Robarts, you know how I'm placed.\"\n\n\"Mr. Crawley is my friend, and of course I want to assist him. I was\nunder a great obligation to Mr. Crawley once, and I wish to befriend\nhim, whether he took the money or not. But I could act so much better\nif I felt sure one way or the other.\"\n\n\"If you ask me, I think he did take it.\"\n\n\"What!--stole it?\"\n\n\"I think he knew it was not his own when he took it. You see I don't\nthink he meant to use it when he took it. He perhaps had some queer\nidea that Soames had been hard on him, or his lordship, and that the\nmoney was fairly his due. Then he kept the cheque by him till he was\nabsolutely badgered out of his life by the butcher up the street\nthere. That was about the long and the short of it, Mr. Robarts.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. And now what had he better do?\"\n\n\"Well; if you ask me,-- He is in very bad health, isn't he?\"\n\n\"No; I should say not. He walked to Barchester and back the other\nday.\"\n\n\"Did he? But he's very queer, isn't he?\"\n\n\"Very odd-mannered indeed.\"\n\n\"And does and says all manner of odd things?\"\n\n\"I think you'd find the bishop would say so after that interview.\"\n\n\"Well; if it would do any good, you might have the bishop examined.\"\n\n\"Examined for what, Mr. Walker?\"\n\n\"If you could show, you know, that Crawley has got a bee in his\nbonnet; that the mens sana is not there, in short;--I think you might\nmanage to have the trial postponed.\"\n\n\"But then somebody must take charge of his living.\"\n\n\"You parsons could manage that among you;--you and the dean and the\narchdeacon. The archdeacon has always got half-a-dozen curates about\nsomewhere. And then,--after the assizes, Mr. Crawley might come to\nhis senses; and I think,--mind it's only an idea,--but I think the\ncommittal might be quashed. It would have been temporary insanity,\nand, though mind I don't give my word for it, I think he might go on\nand keep his living. I think so, Mr. Robarts.\"\n\n\"That has never occurred to me.\"\n\n\"No;--I daresay not. You see the difficulty is this. He's so\nstiff-necked,--will do nothing himself. Well, that will do for one\nproof of temporary insanity. The real truth is, Mr. Robarts, he is as\nmad as a hatter.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I've often thought so.\"\n\n\"And you wouldn't mind saying so in evidence,--would you? Well, you\nsee, there is no helping such a man in any other way. He won't even\nemploy a lawyer to defend him.\"\n\n\"That was what I had come to you about.\"\n\n\"I'm told he won't. Now a man must be mad who won't employ a lawyer\nwhen he wants one. You see, the point we should gain would be\nthis,--if we tried to get him through as being a little touched in\nthe upper story,--whatever we could do for him, we could do against\nhis own will. The more he opposed us the stronger our case would be.\nHe would swear he was not mad at all, and we should say that that was\nthe greatest sign of his madness. But when I say we, of course I mean\nyou. I must not appear in it.\"\n\n\"I wish you could, Mr. Walker.\"\n\n\"Of course I can't; but that won't make any difference.\"\n\n\"I suppose he must have a lawyer?\"\n\n\"Yes, he must have a lawyer;--or rather his friends must.\"\n\n\"And who should employ him, ostensibly?\"\n\n\"Ah;--there's the difficulty. His wife wouldn't do it, I suppose? She\ncouldn't do him a better turn.\"\n\n\"He would never forgive her. And she would never consent to act\nagainst him.\"\n\n\"Could you interfere?\"\n\n\"If necessary, I will;--but I hardly know him well enough.\"\n\n\"Has he no father or mother, or uncles or aunts? He must have\nsomebody belonging to him,\" said Mr. Walker.\n\nThen it occurred to Mr. Robarts that Dean Arabin would be the proper\nperson to interfere. Dean Arabin and Mr. Crawley had been intimate\nfriends in early life, and Dean Arabin knew more of him than did any\nman, at least in those parts. All this Mr. Robarts explained to Mr.\nWalker, and Mr. Walker agreed with him that the services of Dean\nArabin should if possible be obtained. Mr. Robarts would at once\nwrite to Dean Arabin and explain at length all the circumstances of\nthe case. \"The worst of it is, he will hardly be home in time,\" said\nMr. Walker. \"Perhaps he would come a little sooner if you were to\npress it?\"\n\n\"But we could act in his name in his absence, I suppose?--of course\nwith his authority?\"\n\n\"I wish he could be here a month before the assizes, Mr. Robarts. It\nwould be better.\"\n\n\"And in the meantime shall I say anything to Mr. Crawley, myself,\nabout employing a lawyer?\"\n\n\"I think I would. If he turns upon you, as like enough he may, and\nabuses you, that will help us in one way. If he should consent, and\nperhaps he may, that would help us in the other way. I'm told he's\nbeen over and upset the whole coach at the palace.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't think the bishop got much out of him,\" said the parson.\n\n\"I don't like Crawley the less for speaking his mind free to the\nbishop,\" said the attorney, laughing. \"And he'll speak it free to you\ntoo, Mr. Robarts.\"\n\n\"He won't break any of my bones. Tell me, Mr. Walker, what lawyer\nshall I name to him?\"\n\n\"You can't have a better man than Mr. Mason, up the street there.\"\n\n\"Winthrop proposed Borleys at Barchester.\"\n\n\"No, no, no. Borleys and Bonstock are capital people to push a fellow\nthrough on a charge of horse-stealing, or to squeeze a man for a\nlittle money; but they are not the people for Mr. Crawley in such a\ncase as this. Mason is a better man; and then Mason and I know each\nother.\" In saying which Mr. Walker winked.\n\nThere was then a discussion between them whether Mr. Robarts should\ngo at once to Mr. Mason; but it was decided at last that he should\nsee Mr. Crawley and also write to the dean before he did so. The dean\nmight wish to employ his own lawyer, and if so the double expense\nshould be avoided. \"Always remember, Mr. Robarts, that when you go\ninto an attorney's office door, you will have to pay for it, first or\nlast. In here, you see, the dingy old mahogany, bare as it is, makes\nyou safe. Or else it's the salt-cellar, which will not allow itself\nto be polluted by six-and-eightpenny considerations. But there is the\nother kind of tax to be paid. You must go up and see Mrs. Walker, or\nyou won't have her help in this matter.\"\n\nMr. Walker returned to his work, either to some private den within\nhis house, or to his office, and Mr. Robarts was taken upstairs to\nthe drawing-room. There he found Mrs. Walker and her daughter, and\nMiss Anne Prettyman, who had just looked in, full of the story of\nMr. Crawley's walk to Barchester. Mr. Thumble had seen one of Dr.\nTempest's curates, and had told the whole story--he, Mr. Thumble,\nhaving heard Mrs. Proudie's version of what had occurred, and having,\nof course, drawn his own deductions from her premises. And it seemed\nthat Mr. Crawley had been watched as he passed through the close\nout of Barchester. A minor canon had seen him, and had declared\nthat he was going at the rate of a hunt, swinging his arms on high\nand speaking very loud, though,--as the minor canon said with\nregret,--the words were hardly audible. But there had been no doubt\nas to the man. Mr. Crawley's old hat, and short rusty cloak, and\ndirty boots, had been duly observed and chronicled by the minor\ncanon; and Mr. Thumble had been enabled to put together a not\naltogether false picture of what had occurred. As soon as the\ngreetings between Mr. Robarts and the ladies had been made, Miss\nAnne Prettyman broke out again, just where she had left off when Mr.\nRobarts came in. \"They say that Mrs. Proudie declared that she will\nhave him sent to Botany Bay!\"\n\n\"Luckily Mrs. Proudie won't have much to do in the matter,\" said Miss\nWalker, who ranged herself, as to church matters, in ranks altogether\nopposed to those commanded by Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"She will have nothing to do with it, my dear,\" said Mrs. Walker;\n\"and I daresay Mrs. Proudie was not foolish enough to say anything of\nthe kind.\"\n\n\"Mamma, she would be fool enough to say anything. Would she not, Mr.\nRobarts?\"\n\n\"You forget, Miss Walker, that Mrs. Proudie is in authority over me.\"\n\n\"So she is, for the matter of that,\" said the young lady; \"but I know\nvery well what you all think of her, and say of her too, at Framley.\nYour friend, Lady Lufton, loves her dearly. I wish I could have been\nhidden behind a curtain in the palace, to hear what Mr. Crawley said\nto her.\"\n\n\"Mr. Smillie declares,\" said Miss Anne Prettyman, \"that the bishop\nhas been ill ever since. Mr. Smillie went over to his mother's at\nBarchester for Christmas, and took part of the cathedral duty, and\nwe had Mr. Spooner over here in his place. So Mr. Smillie of course\nheard all about it. Only fancy, poor Mr. Crawley walking all the way\nfrom Hogglestock to Barchester and back;--and I am told he hardly had\na shoe to his foot! Is it not a shame, Mr. Robarts?\"\n\n\"I don't think it was quite so bad as you say, Miss Prettyman; but,\nupon the whole, I do think it is a shame. But what can we do?\"\n\n\"I suppose there are tithes at Hogglestock. Why are they not given up\nto the church, as they ought to be?\"\n\n\"My dear Miss Prettyman, that is a very large subject, and I am\nafraid it cannot be settled in time to relieve our poor friend\nfrom his distress.\" Then Mr. Robarts escaped from the ladies in\nMr. Walker's house, who, as it seemed to him, were touching upon\ndangerous ground, and went back to the yard of the George Inn for\nhis gig,--the George and Vulture it was properly called, and was\nthe house in which the magistrates had sat when they committed Mr.\nCrawley for trial.\n\n\"Footed it every inch of the way, blowed if he didn't,\" the ostler\nwas saying to a gentleman's groom, whom Mr. Robarts recognized to be\nthe servant of his friend, Major Grantly; and Mr. Robarts knew that\nthey also were talking about Mr. Crawley. Everybody in the county was\ntalking about Mr. Crawley. At home, at Framley, there was no other\nsubject of discourse. Lady Lufton, the dowager, was full of it, being\nfirmly convinced that Mr. Crawley was innocent, because the bishop\nwas supposed to regard him as guilty. There had been a family\nconclave held at Framley Court over that basket of provisions which\nhad been sent for the Christmas cheer of the Hogglestock parsonage,\neach of the three ladies, the two Lady Luftons and Mrs. Robarts,\nhaving special views of their own. How the pork had been substituted\nfor the beef by old Lady Lufton, young Lady Lufton thinking that\nafter all the beef would be less dangerous, and how a small turkey\nhad been rashly suggested by Mrs. Robarts, and how certain small\narticles had been inserted in the bottom of the basket which Mrs.\nCrawley had never shewn to her husband, need not here be told at\nlength. But Mr. Robarts, as he heard the two grooms talking about\nMr. Crawley, began to feel that Mr. Crawley had achieved at least\ncelebrity.\n\nThe groom touched his hat as Mr. Robarts walked up. \"Has the major\nreturned home yet?\" Mr. Robarts asked. The groom said that his master\nwas still at Plumstead, and that he was to go over to Plumstead to\nfetch the major and Miss Edith in a day or two. Then Mr. Robarts got\ninto his gig, and as he drove out of the yard he heard the words of\nthe men as they returned to the same subject. \"Footed it all the\nway,\" said one. \"And yet he's a gen'leman, too,\" said the other.\nMr. Robarts thought of this as he drove on, intending to call at\nHogglestock on that very day on his way home. It was undoubtedly the\nfact that Mr. Crawley was recognized to be a gentleman by all who\nknew him, high or low, rich or poor, by those who thought well of\nhim and by those who thought ill. These grooms, who had been telling\neach other that this parson, who was to be tried as a thief, had been\nconstrained to walk from Hogglestock to Barchester and back, because\nhe could not afford to travel in any other way, and that his boots\nwere cracked and his clothes ragged, had still known him to be a\ngentleman! Nobody doubted it; not even they who thought he had stolen\nthe money. Mr. Robarts himself was certain of it, and told himself\nthat he knew it by evidences which his own education made clear to\nhim. But how was it that the grooms knew it? For my part I think that\nthere are no better judges of the article than the grooms.\n\nThinking still of all which he had heard, Mr. Robarts found himself\nat Mr. Crawley's gate at Hogglestock.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nMR. ROBARTS ON HIS EMBASSY.\n\n\nMr. Robarts was not altogether easy in his mind as he approached Mr.\nCrawley's house. He was aware that the task before him was a very\ndifficult one, and he had not confidence in himself,--that he was\nexactly the man fitted for the performance of such a task. He was a\nlittle afraid of Mr. Crawley, acknowledging tacitly to himself that\nthe man had a power of ascendancy with which he would hardly be able\nto cope successfully. In old days he had once been rebuked by Mr.\nCrawley, and had been cowed by the rebuke; and though there was no\ntouch of rancour in his heart on this account, no slightest remaining\nvenom,--but rather increased respect and friendship,--still he\nwas unable to overcome the remembrance of the scene in which the\nperpetual curate of Hogglestock had undoubtedly had the mastery\nof him. So, when two dogs have fought and one has conquered, the\nconquered dog will always show an unconscious submission to the\nconqueror.\n\nHe hailed a boy on the road as he drew near to the house, knowing\nthat he would find no one at the parsonage to hold his horse for him,\nand was thus able without delay to walk through the garden and knock\nat the door. \"Papa was not at home,\" Jane said. \"Papa was at the\nschool. But papa could certainly be summoned. She herself would run\nacross to the school if Mr. Robarts would come in.\" So Mr. Robarts\nentered, and found Mrs. Crawley in the sitting-room. Mr. Crawley\nwould be in directly, she said. And then, hurrying on to the subject\nwith confused haste, in order that a word or two might be spoken\nbefore her husband came back, she expressed her thanks and his for\nthe good things which had been sent to them at Christmas-tide.\n\n\"It's old Lady Lufton's doings,\" said Mr. Robarts, trying to laugh\nthe matter over.\n\n\"I knew that it came from Framley, Mr. Robarts, and I know how good\nyou all are there. I have not written to thank Lady Lufton. I thought\nit better not to write. Your sister will understand why, if no one\nelse does. But you will tell them from me, I am sure, that it was, as\nthey intended, a comfort to us. Your sister knows too much of us for\nme to suppose that our great poverty can be secret from her. And, as\nfar as I am concerned, I do not now much care who knows it.\"\n\n\"There is no disgrace in not being rich,\" said Mr. Robarts.\n\n\"No; and the feeling of disgrace which does attach itself to being so\npoor as we are is deadened by the actual suffering which such poverty\nbrings with it. At least it has become so with me. I am not ashamed\nto say that I am very grateful for what you all have done for us at\nFramley. But you must not say anything to him about that.\"\n\n\"Of course I will not, Mrs. Crawley.\"\n\n\"His spirit is higher than mine, I think, and he suffers more from\nthe natural disinclination which we all have to receiving alms. Are\nyou going to speak to him about this affair of the--cheque, Mr.\nRobarts?\"\n\n\"I am going to ask him to put his case into some lawyer's hands.\"\n\n\"Oh! I wish he would!\"\n\n\"And will he not?\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you, your coming to ask him, but--\"\n\n\"Has he so strong an objection?\"\n\n\"He will tell you that he has no money to pay a lawyer.\"\n\n\"But, surely, if he were convinced that it was absolutely necessary\nfor the vindication of his innocence, he would submit to charge\nhimself with an expense so necessary, not only for himself, but for\nhis family?\"\n\n\"He will say it ought not to be necessary. You know, Mr. Robarts,\nthat in some respects he is not like other men. You will not let what\nI say of him set you against him?\"\n\n\"Indeed, no.\"\n\n\"It is most kind of you to make the attempt. He will be here\ndirectly, and when he comes I will leave you together.\"\n\nWhile she was yet speaking his step was heard along the gravel-path,\nand he hurried into the room with quick steps. \"I crave your pardon,\nMr. Robarts,\" he said, \"that I should keep you waiting.\" Now Mr.\nRobarts had not been there ten minutes, and any such asking of\npardon was hardly necessary. And, even in his own house, Mr.\nCrawley affected a mock humility, as though, either through\nhis own debasement, or because of the superior station of the\nother clergyman, he were not entitled to put himself on an equal\nfooting with his visitor. He would not have shaken hands with Mr.\nRobarts,--intending to indicate that he did not presume to do so\nwhile the present accusation was hanging over him,--had not the\naction been forced upon him. And then there was something of a\nprotest in his manner, as though remonstrating against a thing that\nwas unbecoming to him. Mr. Robarts, without analysing it, understood\nit all, and knew that behind the humility there was a crushing\npride,--a pride which, in all probability, would rise up and crush\nhim before he could get himself out of the room again. It was,\nperhaps, after all, a question whether the man was not served rightly\nby the extremities to which he was reduced. There was something\nradically wrong within him, which had put him into antagonism with\nall the world, and which produced these never-dying grievances. There\nwere many clergymen in the country with incomes as small as that\nwhich had fallen to the lot of Mr. Crawley, but they managed to\nget on without displaying their sores as Mr. Crawley displayed his.\nThey did not wear their old rusty cloaks with all that ostentatious\nbitterness of poverty which seemed to belong to that garment when\ndisplayed on Mr. Crawley's shoulders. Such, for a moment, were Mr.\nRobarts' thoughts, and he almost repented himself of his present\nmission. But then he thought of Mrs. Crawley, and remembering that\nher sufferings were at any rate undeserved, determined that he would\npersevere.\n\nMrs. Crawley disappeared almost as soon as her husband appeared,\nand Mr. Robarts found himself standing in front of his friend, who\nremained fixed on the spot, with his hands folded over each other\nand his neck slightly bent forward, in token also of humility. \"I\nregret,\" he said, \"that your horse should be left there, exposed to\nthe inclemency of the weather; but--\"\n\n\"The horse won't mind it a bit,\" said Mr. Robarts. \"A parson's horse\nis like a butcher's, and knows that he mustn't be particular about\nwaiting in the cold.\"\n\n\"I never have had one myself,\" said Mr. Crawley. Now Mr. Robarts had\nhad more horses than one before now, and had been thought by some\nto have incurred greater expense than was befitting in his stable\ncomforts. The subject, therefore, was a sore one, and he was worried\na little. \"I just wanted to say a few words to you, Crawley,\" he\nsaid, \"and if I am not occupying too much of your time--\"\n\n\"My time is altogether at your disposal. Will you be seated?\"\n\nThen Mr. Robarts sat down, and, swinging his hat between his\nlegs, bethought himself how he should begin his work. \"We had the\narchdeacon over at Framley the other day,\" he said. \"Of course you\nknow the archdeacon?\"\n\n\"I never had the advantage of any acquaintance with Dr. Grantly. Of\ncourse I know him well by name, and also personally,--that is, by\nsight.\"\n\n\"And by character?\"\n\n\"Nay; I can hardly say so much as that. But I am aware that his name\nstands high with many of his order.\"\n\n\"Exactly; that is what I mean. You know that his judgment is thought\nmore of in clerical matters than that of any other clergyman in the\ncounty.\"\n\n\"By a certain party, Mr. Robarts.\"\n\n\"Well, yes. They don't think much of him, I suppose, at the palace.\nBut that won't lower him in your estimation.\"\n\n\"I by no means wish to derogate from Dr. Grantly's high position\nin his own archdeaconry,--to which, as you are aware, I am not\nattached,--nor to criticize his conduct in any respect. It would be\nunbecoming in me to do so. But I cannot accept it as a point in a\nclergyman's favour, that he should be opposed to his bishop.\"\n\nNow this was too much for Mr. Robarts. After all that he had heard of\nthe visit paid by Mr. Crawley to the palace,--of the venom displayed\nby Mrs. Proudie on that occasion, and of the absolute want of\nsubordination to episcopal authority which Mr. Crawley himself was\nsupposed to have shown,--Mr. Robarts did feel it hard that his friend\nthe archdeacon should be snubbed in this way because he was deficient\nin reverence for his bishop! \"I thought, Crawley,\" he said, \"that\nyou yourself were inclined to dispute orders coming to you from the\npalace. The world at least says as much concerning you.\"\n\n\"What the world says of me I have learned to disregard very much, Mr.\nRobarts. But I hope that I shall never disobey the authority of the\nChurch when properly and legally exercised.\"\n\n\"I hope with all my heart you never will; nor I either. And the\narchdeacon, who knows, to the breadth of a hair, what a bishop ought\nto do and what he ought not, and what he may do and what he may not,\nwill, I should say, be the last man in England to sin in that way.\"\n\n\"Very probably. I am far from contradicting you there. Pray\nunderstand, Mr. Robarts, that I bring no accusation against the\narchdeacon. Why should I?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to discuss him at all.\"\n\n\"Nor did I, Mr. Robarts.\"\n\n\"I only mentioned his name, because, as I said, he was over with us\nthe other day at Framley, and we were all talking about your affair.\"\n\n\"My affair!\" said Mr. Crawley. And then came a frown upon his brow,\nand a gleam of fire into his eyes, which effectually banished that\nlook of extreme humility which he had assumed. \"And may I ask why the\narchdeacon was discussing--my affair?\"\n\n\"Simply from the kindness which he bears to you.\"\n\n\"I am grateful for the archdeacon's kindness, as a man is bound to be\nfor any kindness, whether displayed wisely or unwisely. But it seems\nto me that my affair, as you call it, Mr. Robarts, is of that nature\nthat they who wish well to me will better further their wishes by\nsilence than by any discussion.\"\n\n\"Then I cannot agree with you.\" Mr. Crawley shrugged his shoulders,\nopened his hands a little and then closed them, and bowed his head.\nHe could not have declared more clearly by any words that he differed\naltogether from Mr. Robarts, and that as the subject was one so\npeculiarly his own he had a right to expect that his opinion should\nbe allowed to prevail against that of any other person. \"If you come\nto that, you know, how is anybody's tongue to be stopped?\"\n\n\"That vain tongues cannot be stopped, I am well aware. I do not\nexpect that people's tongues should be stopped. I am not saying what\nmen will do, but what good wishes should dictate.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you'll hear me out for a minute.\" Mr. Crawley again\nbowed his head. \"Whether we were wise or unwise, we were discussing\nthis affair.\"\n\n\"Whether I stole Mr. Soames's money?\"\n\n\"No; nobody supposed for a moment you had stolen it.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand how they should suppose anything else, knowing,\nas they do, that the magistrates have committed me for the theft.\nThis took place at Framley, you say, and probably in Lord Lufton's\npresence.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And Lord Lufton was chairman at the sitting of the magistrates at\nwhich I was committed. How can it be that he should think otherwise?\"\n\n\"I am sure he has not an idea that you were guilty. Nor yet has Dr.\nThorne, who was also one of the magistrates. I don't suppose one of\nthem then thought so.\"\n\n\"Then their action, to say the least of it, was very strange.\"\n\n\"It was all because you had nobody to manage it for you. I thoroughly\nbelieve that if you had placed the matter in the hands of a good\nlawyer, you would never have heard a word more about it. That seems\nto be the opinion of everybody I speak to on the subject.\"\n\n\"Then in this country a man is to be punished or not, according to\nhis ability to fee a lawyer!\"\n\n\"I am not talking about punishment.\"\n\n\"And presuming an innocent man to have the ability and not the will\nto do so, he is to be punished, to be ruined root and branch, self\nand family, character and pocket, simply because, knowing his own\ninnocence, he does not choose to depend on the mercenary skill of a\nman whose trade he abhors for the establishment of that which should\nbe clear as the sun at noon-day! You say I am innocent, and yet you\ntell me I am to be condemned as a guilty man, have my gown taken\nfrom me, be torn from my wife and children, be disgraced before the\neyes of all men, and be made a byword and a thing horrible to be\nmentioned, because I will not fee an attorney to fee another man\nto come and lie on my behalf, to browbeat witnesses, to make false\nappeals, and perhaps shed false tears in defending me. You have come\nto me asking me to do this, if I understand you, telling me that the\narchdeacon would so advise me.\"\n\n\"That is my object.\" Mr. Crawley, as he had spoken, had in his\nvehemence risen from his seat, and Mr. Robarts was also standing.\n\n\"Then tell the archdeacon,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"that I will have none\nof his advice. I will have no one there paid by me to obstruct the\ncourse of justice or to hoodwink a jury. I have been in courts of\nlaw, and know what is the work for which these gentlemen are hired.\nI will have none of it, and I will thank you to tell the archdeacon\nso, with my respectful acknowledgments of his consideration and\ncondescension. I say nothing as to my own innocence, or my own guilt.\nBut I do say that if I am dragged before that tribunal, an innocent\nman, and am falsely declared to be guilty, because I lack money to\nbribe a lawyer to speak for me, then the laws of this country deserve\nbut little of that reverence which we are accustomed to pay to them.\nAnd if I be guilty--\"\n\n\"Nobody supposes you to be guilty.\"\n\n\"And if I be guilty,\" continued Mr. Crawley, altogether ignoring the\ninterruption, except by the repetition of his words, and a slight\nraising of his voice, \"I will not add to my guilt by hiring any one\nto prove a falsehood or to disprove a truth.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that you should say so, Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"I speak according to what light I have, Mr. Robarts; and if I have\nbeen over-warm with you,--and I am conscious that I have been in\nfault in that direction,--I must pray you to remember that I am\nsomewhat hardly tried. My sorrows and troubles are so great that they\nrise against me and disturb me, and drive me on,--whither I would not\nbe driven.\"\n\n\"But, my friend, is not that just the reason why you should trust in\nthis matter to some one who can be more calm than yourself?\"\n\n\"I cannot trust to any one,--in a matter of conscience. To do as you\nwould have me is to me wrong. Shall I do wrong because I am unhappy?\"\n\n\"You should cease to think it wrong when so advised by persons you\ncan trust.\"\n\n\"I can trust no one with my own conscience;--not even the archdeacon,\ngreat as he is.\"\n\n\"The archdeacon has meant only well to you.\"\n\n\"I will presume so. I will believe so. I do think so. Tell the\narchdeacon from me that I humbly thank him;--that, in a matter of\nchurch question, I might probably submit my judgment to his; even\nthough he might have no authority over me, knowing as I do that in\nsuch matters his experience has been great. Tell him also, that\nthough I would fain that this unfortunate affair might burden the\ntongue of none among my neighbours,--at least till I shall have stood\nbefore the judge to receive the verdict of the jury, and, if needful,\nhis lordship's sentence--still I am convinced that in what he has\nspoken, as also in what he has done, he has not yielded to the\nidleness of gossip, but has exercised his judgment with intended\nkindness.\"\n\n\"He has certainly intended to do you a service; and as for its not\nbeing talked about, that is out of the question.\"\n\n\"And for yourself, Mr. Robarts, whom I have ever regarded as a friend\nsince circumstances brought me into your neighbourhood,--for you,\nwhose sister I love tenderly in memory of past kindness, though now\nshe is removed so far above my sphere, as to make it unfit that I\nshould call her my friend--\"\n\n\"She does not think so at all.\"\n\n\"For yourself, as I was saying, pray believe me that though from the\nroughness of my manner, being now unused to social intercourse, I\nseem to be ungracious and forbidding, I am grateful and mindful, and\nthat in the tablets of my heart I have written you down as one in\nwhom I could trust,--were it given to me to trust in men and women.\"\nThen he turned round with his face to the wall and his back to his\nvisitor, and so remained till Mr. Robarts had left him. \"At any rate\nI wish you well through your trouble,\" said Robarts; and as he spoke\nhe found that his own words were nearly choked by a sob that was\nrising in his throat.\n\nHe went away without another word, and got out to his gig without\nseeing Mrs. Crawley. During one period of the interview he had been\nvery angry with the man,--so angry as to make him almost declare to\nhimself that he would take no more trouble on his behalf. Then he\nhad been brought to acknowledge that Mr. Walker was right, and that\nCrawley was certainly mad. He was so mad, so far removed from the\ndominion of sound sense, that no jury could say that he was guilty\nand that he ought to be punished for his guilt. And, as he so\nresolved, he could not but ask himself the question, whether the\ncharge of the parish ought to be left in the hands of such a man? But\nat last, just before he went, these feelings and these convictions\ngave way to pity, and he remembered simply the troubles which seemed\nto have been heaped on the head of this poor victim to misfortune.\nAs he drove home he resolved that there was nothing left for him to\ndo, but to write to the dean. It was known to all who knew them both,\nthat the dean and Mr. Crawley had lived together on the closest\nintimacy at college, and that that friendship had been maintained\nthrough life;--though, from the peculiarity of Mr. Crawley's\ncharacter, the two had not been much together of late years. Seeing\nhow things were going now, and hearing how pitiful was the plight in\nwhich Mr. Crawley was placed, the dean would, no doubt, feel it to be\nhis duty to hasten his return to England. He was believed to be at\nthis moment in Jerusalem, and it would be long before a letter could\nreach him; but there still wanted three months to the assizes, and\nhis return might be probably effected before the end of February.\n\n\"I never was so distressed in my life,\" Mark Robarts said to his\nwife.\n\n\"And you think you have done no good?\"\n\n\"Only this, that I have convinced myself that the poor man is not\nresponsible for what he does, and that for her sake as well as\nfor his own, some person should be enabled to interfere for his\nprotection.\" Then he told Mrs. Robarts what Mr. Walker had said; also\nthe message which Mr. Crawley had sent to the archdeacon. But they\nboth agreed that that message need not be sent on any further.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nMAJOR GRANTLY AT HOME.\n\n\nMrs. Thorne had spoken very plainly in the advice which she had given\nto Major Grantly. \"If I were you, I'd be at Allington before twelve\no'clock to-morrow.\" That had been Mrs. Thorne's advice; and though\nMajor Grantly had no idea of making the journey so rapidly as the\nlady had proposed, still he thought that he would make it before\nlong, and follow the advice in spirit if not to the letter. Mrs.\nThorne had asked him if it was fair that the girl should be punished\nbecause of the father's fault; and the idea had been sweet to him\nthat the infliction or non-infliction of such punishment should be\nin his hands. \"You go and ask her,\" Mrs. Thorne had said. Well;--he\nwould go and ask her. If it should turn out at last that he had\nmarried the daughter of a thief, and that he was disinherited for\ndoing so,--an arrangement of circumstances which he had to teach\nhimself to regard as very probable,--he would not love Grace the less\non that account, or allow himself for one moment to repent what he\nhad done. As he thought of all this he became somewhat in love with a\nsmall income, and imagined to himself what honours would be done to\nhim by the Mrs. Thornes of the county, when they should come to know\nin what way he had sacrificed himself to his love. Yes;--they would\ngo and live at Pau. He thought Pau would do. He would have enough\nof income for that;--and Edith would get lessons cheaply, and would\nlearn to talk French fluently. He certainly would do it. He would\ngo down to Allington, and ask Grace to be his wife; and bid her\nunderstand that if she loved him she could not be justified in\nrefusing him by the circumstances of her father's position.\n\nBut he must go to Plumstead before he could go to Allington. He\nwas engaged to spend his Christmas there, and must go now at once.\nThere was not time for the journey to Allington before he was due\nat Plumstead. And, moreover, though he could not bring himself\nto resolve that he would tell his father what he was going to\ndo;--\"It would seem as though I were asking his leave!\" he said to\nhimself;--he thought that he would make a clean breast of it to his\nmother. It made him sad to think that he should cut the rope which\nfastened his own boat among the other boats in the home harbour\nat Plumstead, and that he should go out all alone into strange\nwaters,--turned adrift altogether, as it were, from the Grantly\nfleet. If he could only get the promise of his mother's sympathy\nfor Grace it would be something. He understood,--no one better than\nhe,--the tendency of all his family to an uprising in the world,\nwhich tendency was almost as strong in his mother as in his father.\nAnd he had been by no means without a similar ambition himself,\nthough with him the ambition had been only fitful, not enduring.\nHe had a brother, a clergyman, a busy, stirring, eloquent London\npreacher, who got churches built, and was heard of far and wide as a\nrising man, who had married a certain Lady Anne, the daughter of an\nearl, and who was already mentioned as a candidate for high places.\nHow his sister was the wife of a marquis, and a leader in the\nfashionable world, the reader already knows. The archdeacon himself\nwas a rich man, so powerful that he could afford to look down upon a\nbishop; and Mrs. Grantly, though there was left about her something\nof an old softness of nature, a touch of the former life which had\nbeen hers before the stream of her days had run gold, yet she, too,\nhad taken kindly to wealth and high standing, and was by no means one\nof those who construe literally that passage of scripture which tells\nus of the camel and the needle's eye. Our Henry Grantly, our major,\nknew himself to be his mother's favourite child,--knew himself to\nhave become so since something of coolness had grown up between her\nand her august daughter. The augustness of the daughter had done much\nto reproduce the old freshness of which I have spoken in the mother's\nheart, and had specially endeared to her the son who, of all her\nchildren, was the least subject to the family failing. The clergyman,\nCharles Grantly,--he who had married the Lady Anne,--was his father's\ndarling in these days. The old archdeacon would go up to London and\nbe quite happy in his son's house. He met there the men whom he loved\nto meet, and heard the talk which he loved to hear. It was very fine,\nhaving the Marquis of Hartletop for his son-in-law, but he had never\ncared to be much at Lady Hartletop's house. Indeed, the archdeacon\ncared to be in no house in which those around him were supposed to\nbe bigger than himself. Such was the little family fleet from out of\nwhich Henry Grantly was now proposing to sail alone with his little\nboat,--taking Grace Crawley with him at the helm. \"My father is a\njust man at the bottom,\" he said to himself, \"and though he may not\nforgive me, he will not punish Edith.\"\n\nBut there was still left one of the family,--not a Grantly, indeed,\nbut one so nearly allied to them as to have his boat moored in\nthe same harbour,--who, as the major well knew, would thoroughly\nsympathize with him. This was old Mr. Harding, his mother's\nfather,--the father of his mother and of his aunt Mrs. Arabin,--whose\nhome was now at the deanery. He was also to be at Plumstead during\nthis Christmas, and he at any rate would give a ready assent to such\na marriage as that which the major was proposing for himself. But\nthen poor old Mr. Harding had been thoroughly deficient in that\nambition which had served to aggrandize the family into which his\ndaughter had married. He was a poor old man who, in spite of good\nfriends,--for the late bishop of the diocese had been his dearest\nfriend,--had never risen high in his profession, and had fallen even\nfrom the moderate altitude which he had attained. But he was a man\nwhom all loved who knew him; and it was much to the credit of his\nson-in-law, the archdeacon, that, with all his tendencies to love\nrising suns, he had ever been true to Mr. Harding.\n\nMajor Grantly took his daughter with him, and on his arrival at\nPlumstead she of course was the first object of attention. Mrs.\nGrantly declared that she had grown immensely. The archdeacon\ncomplimented her red cheeks, and said that Cosby Lodge was as\nhealthy a place as any in the county, while Mr. Harding, Edith's\ngreat-grandfather, drew slowly from his pocket sundry treasures\nwith which he had come prepared for the delight of the little girl.\nCharles Grantly and Lady Anne had no children, and the heir of all\nthe Hartletops was too august to have been trusted to the embraces of\nher mother's grandfather. Edith, therefore, was all that he had in\nthat generation, and of Edith he was prepared to be as indulgent as\nhe had been, in their time, of his grandchildren the Grantlys, and\nstill was of his grandchildren the Arabins, and had been before that\nof his own daughters. \"She's more like Eleanor than any one else,\"\nsaid the old man in a plaintive tone. Now Eleanor was Mrs. Arabin,\nthe dean's wife, and was at this time,--if I were to say over forty\nI do not think I should be uncharitable. No one else saw the special\nlikeness, but no one else remembered, as Mr. Harding did, what\nEleanor had been when she was three years old.\n\n[Illustration: \"She's more like Eleanor than any one else.\"]\n\n\"Aunt Nelly is in France,\" said the child.\n\n\"Yes, my darling, aunt Nelly is in France, and I wish she were at\nhome. Aunt Nelly has been away a long time.\"\n\n\"I suppose she'll stay till the dean picks her up on his way home?\"\nsaid Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"So she says in her letters. I heard from her yesterday, and I\nbrought the letter, as I thought you'd like to see it.\" Mrs. Grantly\ntook the letter and read it, while her father still played with the\nchild. The archdeacon and the major were standing together on the rug\ndiscussing the shooting at Chaldicotes, as to which the archdeacon\nhad a strong opinion. \"I'm quite sure that a man with a place like\nthat does more good by preserving than by leaving it alone. The\nbetter head of game he has the richer the county will be generally.\nIt is just the same with pheasants as it is with sheep and bullocks.\nA pheasant doesn't cost more than he's worth any more than a\nbarn-door fowl. Besides, a man who preserves is always respected by\nthe poachers, and the man who doesn't is not.\"\n\n\"There's something in that, sir, certainly,\" said the major.\n\n\"More than you think for, perhaps. Look at poor Sowerby, who went on\nthere for years without a shilling. How he was respected, because he\nlived as the people around him expected a gentleman to live. Thorne\nwill have a bad time of it, if he tries to change things.\"\n\n\"Only think,\" exclaimed Mrs. Grantly, \"when Eleanor wrote she had not\nheard of that affair of poor Mr. Crawley's.\"\n\n\"Does she say anything about him?\" asked the major.\n\n\"I'll read what she says. 'I see in Galignani that a clergyman in\nBarsetshire has been committed for theft. Pray tell me who it is. Not\nthe bishop, I hope, for the credit of the diocese?'\"\n\n\"I wish it were,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"For shame, my dear,\" said his wife.\n\n\"No shame at all. If we are to have a thief among us, I'd sooner find\nhim in a bad man than a good one. Besides we should have a change at\nthe palace, which would be a great thing.\"\n\n\"But is it not odd that Eleanor should have heard nothing of it?\"\nsaid Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"It's odd that you should not have mentioned it yourself.\"\n\n\"I did not, certainly; nor you, papa, I suppose?\"\n\nMr. Harding acknowledged that he had not spoken of it, and then they\ncalculated that perhaps she might not have received any letter from\nher husband written since the news had reached him. \"Besides, why\nshould he have mentioned it?\" said the major. \"He only knows as yet\nof the inquiry about the cheque, and can have heard nothing of what\nwas done by the magistrates.\"\n\n\"Still it seems so odd that Eleanor should not have known of it,\nseeing that we have been talking of nothing else for the last week,\"\nsaid Mrs. Grantly.\n\nFor two days the major said not a word of Grace Crawley to any one.\nNothing could be more courteous and complaisant than was his father's\nconduct to him. Anything that he wanted for Edith was to be done. For\nhimself there was no trouble which would not be taken. His hunting,\nand his shooting, and his fishing seemed to have become matters of\nparamount consideration to his father. And then the archdeacon became\nvery confidential about money matters,--not offering anything to his\nson, which, as he well knew, would have been seen through as palpable\nbribery and corruption,--but telling him of this little scheme and of\nthat, of one investment and of another;--how he contemplated buying a\nsmall property here, and spending a few thousands on building there.\n\"Of course it is all for you and your brother,\" said the archdeacon,\nwith that benevolent sadness which is used habitually by fathers on\nsuch occasions; \"and I like you to know what it is that I am doing.\nI told Charles about the London property the last time I was up,\"\nsaid the archdeacon, \"and there shall be no difference between\nhim and you, if all goes well.\" This was very good-natured on the\narchdeacon's part, and was not strictly necessary, as Charles was the\neldest son; but the major understood it perfectly. \"There shall be an\nelysium opened to you, if only you will not do that terrible thing of\nwhich you spoke when last here.\" The archdeacon uttered no such words\nas these, and did not even allude to Grace Crawley; but the words\nwere as good as spoken, and had they been spoken ever so plainly the\nmajor could not have understood them more clearly. He was quite awake\nto the loveliness of the elysium opened before him. He had had his\nmoment of anxiety, whether his father would or would not make an\nelder son of his brother Charles. The whole thing was now put before\nhim plainly. Give up Grace Crawley, and you shall share alike with\nyour brother. Disgrace yourself by marrying her, and your brother\nshall have everything. There was the choice, and it was still open\nto him to take which side he pleased. Were he never to go near Grace\nCrawley again no one would blame him, unless it were Miss Prettyman\nor Mrs. Thorne. \"Fill your glass, Henry,\" said the archdeacon. \"You'd\nbetter, I tell you, for there is no more of it left.\" Then the major\nfilled his glass and sipped the wine, and swore to himself that\nhe would go down to Allington at once. What! Did his father think\nto bribe him by giving him '20 port? He would certainly go down\nto Allington, and he would tell his mother to-morrow morning,\nor certainly on the next day, what he was going to do. \"Pity it\nshould be all gone; isn't it, sir?\" said the archdeacon to his\nfather-in-law. \"It has lasted my time,\" said Mr. Harding, \"and I'm\nvery much obliged to it. Dear, dear; how well I remember your father\ngiving the order for it! There were two pipes, and somebody said it\nwas a heady wine. 'If the prebendaries and rectors can't drink it,'\nsaid your father, 'the curates will.'\"\n\n\"Curates indeed!\" said the archdeacon. \"It's too good for a bishop,\nunless one of the right sort.\"\n\n\"Your father used to say those things, but with him the poorer the\nguest the better the cheer. When he had a few clergymen round him,\nhow he loved to make them happy!\"\n\n\"Never talked shop to them,--did he?\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"Not after dinner, at any rate. Goodness gracious, when one thinks of\nit! Do you remember how we used to play cards?\"\n\n\"Every night regularly;--threepenny points, and sixpence on the\nrubber,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"Dear, dear! How things are changed! And I remember when the\nclergymen did more of the dancing in Barchester than all the other\nyoung men in the city put together.\"\n\n\"And a good set they were;--gentlemen every one of them. It's well\nthat some of them don't dance now;--that is, for the girls' sake.\"\n\n\"I sometimes sit and wonder,\" said Mr. Harding, \"whether your\nfather's spirit ever comes back to the old house and sees the\nchanges,--and if so whether he approves them.\"\n\n\"Approves them!\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"Well;--yes. I think he would, upon the whole. I'm sure of this: he\nwould not disapprove, because the new ways are changed from his ways.\nHe never thought himself infallible. And do you know, my dear, I am\nnot sure that it isn't all for the best. I sometimes think that some\nof us were very idle when we were young. I was, I know.\"\n\n\"I worked hard enough,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"Ah, yes; you. But most of us took it very easily. Dear, dear! When\nI think of it, and see how hard they work now, and remember what\npleasant times we used to have,--I don't feel sometimes quite sure.\"\n\n\"I believe the work was done a great deal better than it is now,\"\nsaid the archdeacon. \"There wasn't so much fuss, but there was more\nreality. And men were men, and clergymen were gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Yes;--they were gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Such a creature as that old woman at the palace couldn't have held\nhis head up among us. That's what has come from Reform. A reformed\nHouse of Commons makes Lord Brock Prime Minister, and then your Prime\nMinister makes Dr. Proudie a bishop! Well;--it will last my time, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"It has lasted mine,--like the wine,\" said Mr. Harding.\n\n\"There's one glass more, and you shall have it, sir.\" Then Mr.\nHarding drank the last glass of the 1820 port, and they went into the\ndrawing-room.\n\nOn the next morning after breakfast the major went out for a walk\nby himself. His father had suggested to him that he should go over\nto shoot at Framley, and had offered him the use of everything\nthe archdeaconry possessed in the way of horses, dogs, guns and\ncarriages. But the major would have none of these things. He would go\nout and walk by himself. \"He's not thinking of her; is he?\" said the\narchdeacon to his wife, in a whisper. \"I don't know. I think he is,\"\nsaid Mrs. Grantly. \"It will be so much the better for Charles, if\nhe does,\" said the archdeacon grimly; and the look of his face as\nhe spoke was by no means pleasant. \"You will do nothing unjust,\narchdeacon,\" said his wife. \"I will do as I like with my own,\" said\nhe. And then he also went out and took a walk by himself.\n\nThat evening after dinner, there was no 1820 port, and no\nrecollections of old days. They were rather dull, the three of them,\nas they sat together,--and dulness is always more unendurable than\nsadness. Old Mr. Harding went to sleep and the archdeacon was cross.\n\"Henry,\" he said, \"you haven't a word to throw to a dog.\" \"I've got\nrather a headache this evening, sir,\" said the major. The archdeacon\ndrank two glasses of wine, one after another, quickly. Then he woke\nhis father-in-law gently, and went off. \"Is there anything the\nmatter?\" asked the old man. \"Nothing particular. My father seems to\nbe a little cross.\" \"Ah! I've been to sleep and I oughtn't. It's my\nfault. We'll go in and smooth him down.\" But the archdeacon wouldn't\nbe smoothed down on that occasion. He would let his son see the\ndifference between a father pleased, and a father displeased,--or\nrather between a father pleasant, and a father unpleasant. \"He hasn't\nsaid anything to you, has he?\" said the archdeacon that night to his\nwife. \"Not a word;--as yet.\" \"If he does it without the courage to\ntell us, I shall think him a cur,\" said the archdeacon. \"But he did\ntell you,\" said Mrs. Grantly, standing up for her favourite son;\n\"and, for the matter of that, he has courage enough for anything. If\nhe does it, I shall always say that he has been driven to it by your\nthreats.\"\n\n\"That's sheer nonsense,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"It's not nonsense at all,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"Then I suppose I was to hold my tongue and say nothing?\" said\nthe archdeacon; and as he spoke he banged the door between his\ndressing-room and Mrs. Grantly's bedroom.\n\nOn the first day of the new year Major Grantly spoke his mind to\nhis mother. The archdeacon had gone into Barchester, having in vain\nattempted to induce his son to go with him. Mr. Harding was in the\nlibrary reading a little and sleeping a little, and dreaming of\nold days and old friends, and perhaps, sometimes, of the old wine.\nMrs. Grantly was alone in a small sitting-room which she frequented\nupstairs, when suddenly her son entered the room. \"Mother,\" he said,\n\"I think it better to tell you that I am going to Allington.\"\n\n\"To Allington, Henry?\" She knew very well who was at Allington, and\nwhat must be the business which would take him there.\n\n\"Yes, mother. Miss Crawley is there, and there are circumstances\nwhich make it incumbent on me to see her without delay.\"\n\n\"What circumstances, Henry?\"\n\n\"As I intend to ask her to be my wife, I think it best to do so now.\nI owe it to her and to myself that she should not think that I am\ndeterred by her father's position.\"\n\n\"But would it not be reasonable that you should be deterred by her\nfather's position?\"\n\n\"No, I think not. I think it would be dishonest as well as\nungenerous. I cannot bring myself to brook such delay. Of course I am\nalive to the misfortune which has fallen upon her,--upon her and me,\ntoo, should she ever become my wife. But it is one of those burdens\nwhich a man should have shoulders broad enough to bear.\"\n\n\"Quite so, if she were your wife, or even if you were engaged to her.\nThen honour would require it of you, as well as affection. As it is,\nyour honour does not require it, and I think you should hesitate, for\nall our sakes, and especially for Edith's.\"\n\n\"It will do Edith no harm; and, mother, if you alone were concerned,\nI think you would feel that it would not hurt you.\"\n\n\"I was not thinking of myself, Henry.\"\n\n\"As for my father, the very threats which he has used make me\nconscious that I have only to measure the price. He has told me that\nhe will stop my allowance.\"\n\n\"But that may not be the worst. Think how you are situated. You are\nthe younger son of a man who will be held to be justified in making\nan elder son, if he thinks fit to do so.\"\n\n\"I can only hope that he will be fair to Edith. If you will tell him\nthat from me, it is all that I will ask you to do.\"\n\n\"But you will see him yourself?\"\n\n\"No, mother; not till I have been to Allington. Then I will see him\nagain or not, just as he pleases. I shall stop at Guestwick, and\nwill write to you a line from thence. If my father decides on doing\nanything, let me know at once, as it will be necessary that I should\nget rid of the lease of my house.\"\n\n\"Oh, Henry!\"\n\n\"I have thought a great deal about it, mother, and I believe I am\nright. Whether I am right or wrong, I shall do it. I will not ask\nyou now for any promise or pledge; but should Miss Crawley become my\nwife, I hope that you at least will not refuse to see her as your\ndaughter.\" Having so spoken, he kissed his mother, and was about to\nleave the room; but she held him by his arm, and he saw that her\neyes were full of tears. \"Dearest mother, if I grieve you I am sorry\nindeed.\"\n\n\"Not me, not me, not me,\" she said.\n\n\"For my father, I cannot help it. Had he not threatened me I should\nhave told him also. As he has done so, you must tell him. But give\nhim my kindest love.\"\n\n\"Oh, Henry; you will be ruined. You will, indeed. Can you not wait?\nRemember how headstrong your father is, and yet how good;--and how he\nloves you! Think of all that he has done for you. When did he refuse\nyou anything?\"\n\n\"He has been good to me, but in this I cannot obey him. He should not\nask me.\"\n\n\"You are wrong. You are indeed. He has a right to expect that you\nwill not bring disgrace upon the family.\"\n\n\"Nor will I;--except such disgrace as may attend upon poverty.\nGood-by, mother. I wish you could have said one kind word to me.\"\n\n\"Have I not said a kind word?\"\n\n\"Not as yet, mother.\"\n\n\"I would not for worlds speak unkindly to you. If it were not for\nyour father I would bid you bring whom you pleased home to me as your\nwife; and I would be as a mother to her. And if this girl should\nbecome your wife--\"\n\n\"It shall not be my fault if she does not.\"\n\n\"I will try to love her--some day.\"\n\nThen the major went, leaving Edith at the rectory, as requested by\nhis mother. His own dog-cart and his servant were at Plumstead, and\nhe drove himself home to Cosby Lodge.\n\nWhen the archdeacon returned the news was told to him at once. \"Henry\nhas gone to Allington to propose to Miss Crawley,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"Gone,--without speaking to me!\"\n\n\"He left his love, and said that it was useless his remaining, as he\nknew he should only offend you.\"\n\n\"He has made his bed, and he must lie upon it,\" said the archdeacon.\nAnd then there was not another word said about Grace Crawley on that\noccasion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nMISS LILY DALE'S RESOLUTION.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe ladies at the Small House at Allington breakfasted always at\nnine,--a liberal nine; and the postman whose duty it was to deliver\nletters in that village at half-past eight, being also liberal in\nhis ideas as to time, always arrived punctually in the middle of\nbreakfast, so that Mrs. Dale expected her letters, and Lily hers,\njust before their second cup of tea, as though the letters formed\na part of the morning meal. Jane, the maid-servant, always brought\nthem in, and handed them to Mrs. Dale,--for Lily had in these days\ncome to preside at the breakfast-table; and then there would be an\nexamination of the outsides before the envelopes were violated, and\nas each knew pretty well all the circumstances of the correspondence\nof the other, there would be some guessing as to what this or that\nepistle might contain; and after that a reading out loud of passages,\nand not unfrequently of the entire letter. But now, at the time\nof which I am speaking, Grace Crawley was at the Small House, and\ntherefore the common practice was somewhat in abeyance.\n\nOn one of the first days of the new year Jane brought in the letters\nas usual, and handed them to Mrs. Dale. Lily was at the time occupied\nwith the teapot, but still she saw the letters, and had not her hands\nso full as to be debarred from the expression of her usual anxiety.\n\"Mamma, I'm sure I see two there for me,\" she said. \"Only one for\nyou, Lily,\" said Mrs. Dale. Lily instantly knew from the tone of\nthe voice that some letter had come, which by the very aspect of\nthe handwriting had disturbed her mother. \"There is one for you, my\ndear,\" said Mrs. Dale, throwing a letter across the table to Grace.\n\"And one for you, Lily, from Bell. The others are for me.\" \"And whom\nare yours from, mamma?\" asked Lily. \"One is from Mrs. Jones; the\nother, I think, is a letter on business.\" Then Lily said nothing\nfurther, but she observed that her mother only opened one of her\nletters at the breakfast-table. Lily was very patient;--not by\nnature, I think, but by exercise and practice. She had, once in\nher life, been too much in a hurry; and having then burned herself\ngrievously, she now feared the fire. She did not therefore follow her\nmother after breakfast, but sat with Grace over the fire, hemming\ndiligently at certain articles of clothing which were intended for\nuse in the Hogglestock parsonage. The two girls were making a set of\nnew shirts for Mr. Crawley. \"But I know he will ask where they come\nfrom,\" said Grace; \"and then mamma will be scolded.\" \"But I hope\nhe'll wear them,\" said Lily. \"Sooner or later he will,\" said Grace;\n\"because mamma manages generally to have her way at last.\" Then\nthey went on for an hour or so, talking about the home affairs at\nHogglestock. But during the whole time Lily's mind was intent upon\nher mother's letter.\n\nNothing was said about it at lunch, and nothing when they walked out\nafter lunch, for Lily was very patient. But during the walk Mrs. Dale\nbecame aware that her daughter was uneasy. These two watched each\nother unconsciously with a closeness which hardly allowed a glance of\nthe eye, certainly not a tone of the voice, to pass unobserved. To\nMrs. Dale it was everything in the world that her daughter should be,\nif not happy at heart, at least tranquil; and to Lily, who knew that\nher mother was always thinking of her, and of her alone, her mother\nwas the only human divinity now worthy of adoration. But nothing was\nsaid about the letter during the walk.\n\nWhen they came home it was nearly dusk, and it was their habit to\nsit up for a while without candles, talking, till the evening had in\ntruth set in and the unmistakable and enforced idleness of remaining\nwithout candles was apparent. During this time, Lily, demanding\npatience of herself all the while, was thinking what she would do, or\nrather what she would say, about the letter. That nothing could be\ndone or said in the presence of Grace Crawley was a matter of course,\nnor would she do or say anything to get rid of Grace. She would be\nvery patient; but she would, at last, ask her mother about the\nletter.\n\nAnd then, as luck would have it, Grace Crawley got up and left the\nroom. Lily still waited for a few minutes, and, in order that her\npatience might be thoroughly exercised, she said a word or two about\nher sister Bell; how the eldest child's whooping-cough was nearly\nwell, and how the baby was doing wonderful things with its first\ntooth. But as Mrs. Dale had already seen Bell's letter, all this was\nnot intensely interesting. At last Lily came to the point and asked\nher question. \"Mamma, from whom was that other letter which you got\nthis morning?\"\n\nOur story will perhaps be best told by communicating the letter to\nthe reader before it was discussed with Lily. The letter was as\nfollows:--\n\n\n   General Committee Office, -- January, 186--.\n\n\nI should have said that Mrs. Dale had not opened the letter till she\nhad found herself in the solitude of her own bedroom; and that then,\nbefore doing so, she had examined the handwriting with anxious eyes.\nWhen she first received it she thought she knew the writer, but was\nnot sure. Then she had glanced at the impression over the fastening,\nand had known at once from whom the letter had come. It was from Mr.\nCrosbie, the man who had brought so much trouble into her house, who\nhad jilted her daughter; the only man in the world whom she had a\nright to regard as a positive enemy to herself. She had no doubt\nabout it, as she tore the envelope open; and yet, when the address\ngiven made her quite sure, a new feeling of shivering came upon her,\nand she asked herself whether it might not be better that she should\nsend his letter back to him without reading it. But she read it.\n\n\"MADAM,\" the letter began,--\n\n\n   You will be very much surprised to hear from me, and I\n   am quite aware that I am not entitled to the ordinary\n   courtesy of an acknowledgment from you, should you be\n   pleased to throw my letter on one side as unworthy of your\n   notice. But I cannot refrain from addressing you, and must\n   leave it to you to reply to me or not, as you may think\n   fit.\n\n   I will only refer to that episode of my life with which\n   you are acquainted, for the sake of acknowledging my great\n   fault and of assuring you that I did not go unpunished. It\n   would be useless for me now to attempt to explain to you\n   the circumstances which led me into that difficulty which\n   ended in so great a blunder; but I will ask you to believe\n   that my folly was greater than my sin.\n\n   But I will come to my point at once. You are, no doubt,\n   aware that I married a daughter of Lord De Courcy, and\n   that I was separated from my wife a few weeks after our\n   unfortunate marriage. It is now something over twelve\n   months since she died at Baden-Baden in her mother's\n   house. I never saw her since the day we first parted. I\n   have not a word to say against her. The fault was mine in\n   marrying a woman whom I did not love and had never loved.\n   When I married Lady Alexandrina I loved, not her, but your\n   daughter.\n\n   I believe I may venture to say to you that your daughter\n   once loved me. From the day on which I last wrote to you\n   that terrible letter which told you of my fate, I have\n   never mentioned the name of Lily Dale to human ears. It\n   has been too sacred for my mouth,--too sacred for the\n   intercourse of any friendship with which I have been\n   blessed. I now use it for the first time to you, in order\n   that I may ask whether it be possible that her old love\n   should ever live again. Mine has lived always,--has never\n   faded for an hour, making me miserable during the years\n   that have passed since I saw her, but capable of making me\n   very happy, if I may be allowed to see her again.\n\n   You will understand my purpose now as well as though I\n   were to write pages. I have no scheme formed in my head\n   for seeing your daughter again. How can I dare to form a\n   scheme, when I am aware that the chance of success must be\n   so strong against me? But if you will tell me that there\n   can be a gleam of hope, I will obey any commands that\n   you can put upon me in any way that you may point out. I\n   am free again,--and she is free. I love her with all my\n   heart, and seem to long for nothing in the world but that\n   she should become my wife. Whether any of her old love may\n   still abide with her, you will know. If it do, it may even\n   yet prompt her to forgive one who, in spite of falseness\n   of conduct, has yet been true to her in heart.\n\n   I have the honour to be, Madam,\n   Your most obedient servant,\n\n   ADOLPHUS CROSBIE.\n\n\nThis was the letter which Mrs. Dale had received, and as to which she\nhad not as yet said a word to Lily, or even made up her mind whether\nshe would say a word or not. Dearly as the mother and daughter loved\neach other, thorough as was the confidence between them, yet the\nname of Adolphus Crosbie had not been mentioned between them oftener,\nperhaps, than half-a-dozen times since the blow had been struck.\nMrs. Dale knew that their feelings about the man were altogether\ndifferent. She, herself, not only condemned him for what he had done,\nbelieving it to be impossible that any shadow of excuse could be\nurged for his offence, thinking that the fault had shown the man to\nbe mean beyond redemption,--but she had allowed herself actually to\nhate him. He had in one sense murdered her daughter, and she believed\nthat she could never forgive him. But Lily, as her mother well knew,\nhad forgiven this man altogether, had made excuses for him which\ncleansed his sin of all its blackness in her own eyes, and was to\nthis day anxious as ever for his welfare and his happiness. Mrs. Dale\nfeared that Lily did in truth love him still. If it was so, was she\nnot bound to show her this letter? Lily was old enough to judge for\nherself,--old enough, and wise enough too. Mrs. Dale told herself\nhalf-a-score of times that morning that she could not be justified in\nkeeping the letter from her daughter.\n\nBut yet she much wished that the letter had never been written,\nand would have given very much to be able to put it out of the way\nwithout injustice to Lily. To her thinking it would be impossible\nthat Lily should be happy in marrying such a man. Such a marriage\nnow would be, as Mrs. Dale thought, a degradation to her daughter.\nA terrible injury had been done to her; but such reparation as this\nwould, in Mrs. Dale's eyes, only make the injury deeper. And yet Lily\nloved the man; and, loving him, how could she resist the temptation\nof his offer? \"Mamma, from whom was that letter which you got this\nmorning?\" Lily asked. For a few moments Mrs. Dale remained silent.\n\"Mamma,\" continued Lily, \"I think I know whom it was from. If you\ntell me to ask nothing further, of course I will not.\"\n\n\"No, Lily; I cannot tell you that.\"\n\n\"Then, mamma, out with it at once. What is the use of shivering on\nthe brink?\"\n\n\"It was from Mr. Crosbie.\"\n\n\"I knew it. I cannot tell you why, but I knew it. And now, mamma;--am\nI to read it?\"\n\n\"You shall do as you please, Lily.\"\n\n\"Then I please to read it.\"\n\n\"Listen to me a moment first. For myself, I wish that the letter had\nnever been written. It tells badly for the man, as I think of it. I\ncannot understand how any man could have brought himself to address\neither you or me, after having acted as he acted.\"\n\n\"But, mamma, we differ about all that, you know.\"\n\n\"Now he has written, and there is the letter,--if you choose to read\nit.\"\n\nLily had it in her hand, but she still sat motionless, holding it.\n\"You think, mamma, I ought not to read it?\"\n\n\"You must judge for yourself, dearest.\"\n\n\"And if I do not read it, what shall you do, mamma?\"\n\n\"I shall do nothing;--or, perhaps, I should in such a case\nacknowledge it, and tell him that we have nothing more to say to\nhim.\"\n\n\"That would be very stern.\"\n\n\"He has done that which makes some sternness necessary.\"\n\nThen Lily was again silent, and still she sat motionless, with the\nletter in her hand. \"Mamma,\" she said, at last, \"if you tell me not\nto read it, I will give it you back unread. If you bid me exercise my\nown judgment, I shall take it upstairs and read it.\"\n\n\"You must exercise your own judgment,\" said Mrs. Dale. Then Lily got\nup from her chair and walked slowly out of the room, and went to her\nmother's chamber. The thoughts which passed through Mrs. Dale's mind\nwhile her daughter was reading the letter were very sad. She could\nfind no comfort anywhere. Lily, she told herself, would surely give\nway to this man's renewed expressions of affection, and she, Mrs.\nDale herself, would be called upon to give her child to a man whom\nshe could neither love nor respect;--whom, for aught she knew, she\ncould never cease to hate. And she could not bring herself to believe\nthat Lily would be happy with such a man. As for her own life,\ndesolate as it would be,--she cared little for that. Mothers know\nthat their daughters will leave them. Even widowed mothers, mothers\nwith but one child left,--such a one as was this mother,--are aware\nthat they will be left alone, and they can bring themselves to\nwelcome the sacrifice of themselves with something of satisfaction.\nMrs. Dale and Lily had, indeed, of late become bound together\nespecially, so that the mother had been justified in regarding the\nlink which joined them as being firmer than that by which most\ndaughters are bound to their mothers;--but in all that she would have\nfound no regret. Even now, in these very days, she was hoping that\nLily might yet be brought to give herself to John Eames. But she\ncould not, after all that was come and gone, be happy in thinking\nthat Lily should be given to Adolphus Crosbie.\n\nWhen Mrs. Dale went upstairs to her own room before dinner Lily was\nnot there; nor were they alone together again that evening, except\nfor a moment, when Lily, as was usual, went into her mother's room\nwhen she was undressing. But neither of them then said a word about\nthe letter. Lily during dinner and throughout the evening had borne\nherself well, giving no sign of special emotion, keeping to herself\nentirely her own thoughts about the proposition made to her. And\nafterwards she had progressed diligently with the fabrication of Mr.\nCrawley's shirts, as though she had no such letter in her pocket. And\nyet there was not a moment in which she was not thinking of it. To\nGrace, just before she went to bed, she did say one word. \"I wonder\nwhether it can ever come to a person to be so placed that there can\nbe no doing right, let what will be done;--that, do or not do, as you\nmay, it must be wrong?\"\n\n\"I hope you are not in such a condition,\" said Grace.\n\n\"I am something near it,\" said Lily, \"but perhaps if I look long\nenough I shall see the light.\"\n\n\"I hope it will be a happy light at last,\" said Grace, who thought\nthat Lily was referring only to John Eames.\n\nAt noon on the next day Lily had still said nothing to her mother\nabout the letter; and then what she said was very little. \"When must\nyou answer Mr. Crosbie, mamma?\"\n\n\"When, my dear?\"\n\n\"I mean how long may you take? It need not be to-day.\"\n\n\"No;--certainly not to-day.\"\n\n\"Then I will talk over it with you to-morrow. It wants some\nthinking;--does it not, mamma?\"\n\n\"It would not want much with me, Lily.\"\n\n\"But then, mamma, you are not I. Believing as I believe, feeling as\nI feel, it wants some thinking. That's what I mean.\"\n\n\"I wish I could help you, my dear.\"\n\n\"You shall help me,--to-morrow.\" The morrow came and Lily was still\nvery patient; but she had prepared herself, and had prepared the time\nalso, so that in the hour of the gloaming she was alone with her\nmother, and sure that she might remain alone with her for an hour or\nso. \"Mamma, sit there,\" she said; \"I will sit down here, and then I\ncan lean against you and be comfortable. You can bear as much of me\nas that,--can't you, mamma?\" Then Mrs. Dale put her arm over Lily's\nshoulder, and embraced her daughter. \"And now, mamma, we will talk\nabout this wonderful letter.\"\n\n\"I do not know, dear, that I have anything to say about it.\"\n\n\"But you must have something to say about it, mamma. You must bring\nyourself to have something to say,--to have a great deal to say.\"\n\n\"You know what I think as well as though I talked for a week.\"\n\n\"That won't do, mamma. Come, you must not be hard with me.\"\n\n\"Hard, Lily!\"\n\n\"I don't mean that you will hurt me, or not give me any food,--or\nthat you will not go on caring about me more than anything else in\nthe whole world ten times over;--\" And Lily as she spoke tightened\nthe embrace of her mother's arm round her neck. \"I'm not afraid\nyou'll be hard in that way. But you must soften your heart so as to\nbe able to mention his name and talk about him, and tell me what I\nought to do. You must see with my eyes, and hear with my ears, and\nfeel with my heart;--and then, when I know that you have done that,\nI must judge with your judgment.\"\n\n\"I wish you to use your own.\"\n\n\"Yes;--because you won't see with my eyes and hear with my ears.\nThat's what I call being hard. Though you should feed me with blood\nfrom your breast, I should call you a hard pelican, unless you could\ngive me also the sympathy which I demand from you. You see, mamma, we\nhave never allowed ourselves to speak of this man.\"\n\n\"What need has there been, dearest?\"\n\n\"Only because we have been thinking of him. Out of the full heart the\nmouth speaketh;--that is, the mouth does so when the full heart is\nallowed to have its own way comfortably.\"\n\n\"There are things which should be forgotten.\"\n\n\"Forgotten, mamma!\"\n\n\"The memory of which should not be fostered by much talking.\"\n\n\"I have never blamed you, mamma; never, even in my heart. I have\nknown how good and gracious and sweet you have been. But I have often\naccused myself of cowardice because I have not allowed his name to\ncross my lips either to you or to Bell. To talk of forgetting such an\naccident as that is a farce. And as for fostering the memory of it--!\nDo you think that I have ever spent a night from that time to this\nwithout thinking of him? Do you imagine that I have ever crossed\nour own lawn, or gone down through the garden-path there, without\nthinking of the times when he and I walked there together? There\nneeds no fostering for such memories as those. They are weeds which\nwill grow rank and strong though nothing be done to foster them.\nThere is the earth and the rain, and that is enough for them. You\ncannot kill them if you would, and they certainly will not die\nbecause you are careful not to hoe and rake the ground.\"\n\n\"Lily, you forget how short the time has been as yet.\"\n\n\"I have thought it very long; but the truth is, mamma, that this\nnon-fostering of memories, as you call it, has not been the real\ncause of our silence. We have not spoken of Mr. Crosbie because we\nhave not thought alike about him. Had you spoken you would have\nspoken with anger, and I could not endure to hear him abused. That\nhas been it.\"\n\n\"Partly so, Lily.\"\n\n\"Now you must talk of him, and you must not abuse him. We must talk\nof him, because something must be done about his letter. Even if it\nbe left unanswered, it cannot be so left without discussion. And yet\nyou must say no evil of him.\"\n\n\"Am I to think that he behaved well?\"\n\n\"No, mamma; you are not to think that; but you are to look upon his\nfault as a fault that has been forgiven.\"\n\n\"It cannot be forgotten, dear.\"\n\n\"But, mamma, when you go to heaven--\"\n\n\"My dear!\"\n\n\"But you will go to heaven, mamma, and why should I not speak of it?\nYou will go to heaven, and yet I suppose you have been very wicked,\nbecause we are all very wicked. But you won't be told of your\nwickedness there. You won't be hated there, because you were this or\nthat when you were here.\"\n\n\"I hope not, Lily; but isn't your argument almost profane?\"\n\n\"No; I don't think so. We ask to be forgiven just as we forgive. That\nis the way in which we hope to be forgiven, and therefore it is the\nway in which we ought to forgive. When you say that prayer at night,\nmamma, do you ever ask yourself whether you have forgiven him?\"\n\n\"I forgive him as far as humanity can forgive. I would do him no\ninjury.\"\n\n\"But if you and I are forgiven only after that fashion we shall never\nget to heaven.\" Lily paused for some further answer from her mother,\nbut as Mrs. Dale was silent she allowed that portion of the subject\nto pass as completed. \"And now, mamma, what answer do you think we\nought to send to his letter?\"\n\n\"My dear, how am I to say? You know I have said already that if I\ncould act on my own judgment, I would send none.\"\n\n\"But that was said in the bitterness of gall.\"\n\n\"Come, Lily, say what you think yourself. We shall get on better when\nyou have brought yourself to speak. Do you think that you wish to see\nhim again?\"\n\n\"I don't know, mamma. Upon the whole, I think not.\"\n\n\"Then in heaven's name let me write and tell him so.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment, mamma. There are two persons here to be\nconsidered,--or rather, three.\"\n\n\"I would not have you think of me in such a question.\"\n\n\"I know you would not; but never mind, and let me go on. The three of\nus are concerned, at any rate; you, and he, and I. I am thinking of\nhim now. We have all suffered, but I do believe that hitherto he has\nhad the worst of it.\"\n\n\"And who has deserved the worst?\"\n\n\"Mamma, how can you go back in that way? We have agreed that that\nshould be regarded as done and gone. He has been very unhappy, and\nnow we see what remedy he proposes to himself for his misery. Do I\nflatter myself if I allow myself to look at it in that way?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he thinks he is offering a remedy for your misery.\"\n\nAs this was said Lily turned round slowly and looked up into her\nmother's face. \"Mamma,\" she said, \"that is very cruel. I did not\nthink you could be so cruel. How can you, who believe him to be so\nselfish, think that?\"\n\n\"It is very hard to judge of men's motives. I have never supposed him\nto be so black that he would not wish to make atonement for the evil\nhe has done.\"\n\n\"If I thought that there certainly could be but one answer.\"\n\n\"Who can look into a man's heart and judge all the sources of his\nactions? There are mixed feelings there, no doubt. Remorse for what\nhe has done; regret for what he has lost;--something, perhaps, of the\npurity of love.\"\n\n\"Yes, something,--I hope something,--for his sake.\"\n\n\"But when a horse kicks and bites, you know his nature and do not go\nnear him. When a man has cheated you once, you think he will cheat\nyou again, and you do not deal with him. You do not look to gather\ngrapes from thistles, after you have found that they are thistles.\"\n\n\"I still go for the roses though I have often torn my hand with\nthorns in looking for them.\"\n\n\"But you do not pluck those that have become cankered in the\nblowing.\"\n\n\"Because he was once at fault, will he be cankered always?\"\n\n\"I would not trust him.\"\n\n\"Now, mamma, see how different we are; or, rather, how different it\nis when one judges for oneself or for another. If it were simply\nmyself, and my own future fate in life, I would trust him with it all\nto-morrow, without a word. I should go to him as a gambler goes to\nthe gambling-table, knowing that if I lost everything I could hardly\nbe poorer than I was before. But I should have a better hope than the\ngambler is justified in having. That, however, is not my difficulty.\nAnd when I think of him I can see a prospect of success for the\ngambler. I think so well of myself that, loving him, as I do;--yes,\nmamma, do not be uneasy;--loving him, as I do, I believe I could be a\ncomfort to him. I think that he might be better with me than without\nme. That is, he would be so, if he could teach himself to look back\nupon the past as I can do, and to judge of me as I can judge of him.\"\n\n\"He has nothing, at least, for which to condemn you.\"\n\n\"But he would have, were I to marry him now. He would condemn me\nbecause I had forgiven him. He would condemn me because I had borne\nwhat he had done to me, and had still loved him--loved him through it\nall. He would feel and know the weakness;--and there is weakness. I\nhave been weak in not being able to rid myself of him altogether. He\nwould recognize this after awhile, and would despise me for it. But\nhe would not see what there is of devotion to him in my being able to\nbear the taunts of the world in going back to him, and your taunts,\nand my own taunts. I should have to bear his also,--not spoken aloud,\nbut to be seen in his face and heard in his voice,--and that I could\nnot endure. If he despised me, and he would, that would make us both\nunhappy. Therefore, mamma, tell him not to come; tell him that he can\nnever come; but, if it be possible, tell him this tenderly.\" Then she\ngot up and walked away, as though she were going out of the room; but\nher mother had caught her before the door was opened.\n\n\"Lily,\" she said, \"if you think you can be happy with him, he shall\ncome.\"\n\n\"No, mamma, no. I have been looking for the light ever since I read\nhis letter, and I think I see it. And now, mamma, I will make a clean\nbreast of it. From the moment in which I heard that that poor woman\nwas dead, I have been in a state of flutter. It has been weak of\nme, and silly, and contemptible. But I could not help it. I kept on\nasking myself whether he would ever think of me now. Well; he has\nanswered the question; and has so done it that he has forced upon me\nthe necessity of a resolution. I have resolved, and I believe that I\nshall be the better for it.\"\n\nThe letter which Mrs. Dale wrote to Mr. Crosbie, was as follows:--\n\n\"Mrs. Dale presents her compliments to Mr. Crosbie, and begs to\nassure him that it will not now be possible that he should renew the\nrelations which were broken off three years ago, between him and Mrs.\nDale's family.\" It was very short, certainly, and it did not by any\nmeans satisfy Mrs. Dale. But she did not know how to say more without\nsaying too much. The object of her letter was to save him the trouble\nof a futile perseverance, and them from the annoyance of persecution;\nand this she wished to do without mentioning her daughter's name. And\nshe was determined that no word should escape her in which there was\nany touch of severity, any hint of an accusation. So much she owed to\nLily in return for all that Lily was prepared to abandon. \"There is\nmy note,\" she said at last, offering it to her daughter. \"I did not\nmean to see it,\" said Lily, \"and, mamma, I will not read it now. Let\nit go. I know you have been good and have not scolded him.\" \"I have\nnot scolded him, certainly,\" said Mrs. Dale. And then the letter was\nsent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nMRS. DOBBS BROUGHTON'S DINNER-PARTY.\n\n\nMr. John Eames, of the Income-tax Office, had in these days risen\nso high in the world that people in the west-end of town, and very\nrespectable people too,--people living in South Kensington, in\nneighbourhoods not far from Belgravia, and in very handsome houses\nround Bayswater,--were glad to ask him out to dinner. Money had been\nleft to him by an earl, and rumour had of course magnified that\nmoney. He was a private secretary, which is in itself a great advance\non being a mere clerk. And he had become the particularly intimate\nfriend of an artist who had pushed himself into high fashion during\nthe last year or two,--one Conway Dalrymple, whom the rich English\nworld was beginning to pet and pelt with gilt sugar-plums, and who\nseemed to take very kindly to petting and gilt sugar-plums. I don't\nknow whether the friendship of Conway Dalrymple had not done as much\nto secure John Eames his position at the Bayswater dinner-tables, as\nhad either the private secretaryship, or the earl's money; and yet,\nwhen they had first known each other, now only two or three years\nago, Conway Dalrymple had been the poorer man of the two. Some chance\nhad brought them together, and they had lived in the same rooms for\nnearly two years. This arrangement had been broken up, and the Conway\nDalrymple of these days had a studio of his own, somewhere near\nKensington Palace, where he painted portraits of young countesses,\nand in which he had even painted a young duchess. It was the peculiar\nmerit of his pictures,--so at least said the art-loving world,--that\nthough the likeness was always good, the stiffness of the modern\nportrait was never there. There was also ever some story told in\nDalrymple's pictures over and above the story of the portraiture.\nThis countess was drawn as a fairy with wings, that countess as\na goddess with a helmet. The thing took for a time, and Conway\nDalrymple was picking up his gilt sugar-plums with considerable\nrapidity.\n\nOn a certain day he and John Eames were to dine out together at a\ncertain house in that Bayswater district. It was a large mansion,\nif not made of stone yet looking very stony, with thirty windows at\nleast, all of them with cut-stone frames, requiring, let me say, at\nleast four thousand a year for its maintenance. And its owner, Dobbs\nBroughton, a man very well known both in the City and over the grass\nin Northamptonshire, was supposed to have a good deal more than four\nthousand a year. Mrs. Dobbs Broughton, a very beautiful woman, who\ncertainly was not yet thirty-five, let her worst enemies say what\nthey might, had been painted by Conway Dalrymple as a Grace. There\nwere, of course, three Graces in the picture, but each Grace was Mrs.\nDobbs Broughton repeated. We all know how Graces stand sometimes;\ntwo Graces looking one way, and one the other. In this picture, Mrs.\nDobbs Broughton as centre Grace looked you full in the face. The same\nlady looked away from you, displaying her left shoulder as one side\nGrace, and displaying her right shoulder as the other side Grace. For\nthis pretty toy Mr. Conway Dalrymple had picked up a gilt sugar-plum\nto the tune of six hundred pounds, and had, moreover, won the heart\nboth of Mr. and Mrs. Dobbs Broughton. \"Upon my word, Johnny,\"\nDalrymple had said to his friend, \"he's a deuced good fellow, has\nreally a good glass of claret,--which is getting rarer and rarer\nevery day,--and will mount you for a day, whenever you please,\ndown at Market Harboro'. Come and dine with them.\" Johnny Eames\ncondescended, and did go and dine with Mr. Dobbs Broughton. I wonder\nwhether he remembered, when Conway Dalrymple was talking of the\nrarity of good claret, how much beer the young painter used to drink\nwhen they were out together in the country, as they used to be\noccasionally, three years ago; and how the painter had then been\nused to complain that bitter beer cost threepence a glass, instead\nof twopence, which had hitherto been the recognized price of the\narticle. In those days the sugar-plums had not been gilt, and had\nbeen much rarer.\n\nJohnny Eames and his friend went together to the house of Mr. Dobbs\nBroughton. As Dalrymple lived close to the Broughtons, Eames picked\nhim up in a cab. \"Filthy things, these cabs are,\" said Dalrymple, as\nhe got into the Hansom.\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Johnny. \"They're pretty good, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"Foul things,\" said Conway. \"Don't you feel what a draught comes in\nhere because the glass is cracked. I'd have one of my own, only I\nshould never know what to do with it.\"\n\n\"The greatest nuisance on earth, I should think,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"If you could always have it standing ready round the corner,\" said\nthe artist, \"it would be delightful. But one would want half a dozen\nhorses, and two or three men for that.\"\n\n\"I think the stands are the best,\" said Johnny.\n\nThey were a little late,--a little later than they should have been\nhad they considered that Eames was to be introduced to his new\nacquaintances. But he had already lived long enough before the world\nto be quite at his ease in such circumstances, and he entered Mrs.\nBroughton's drawing-room with his pleasantest smile upon his face.\nBut as he entered he saw a sight which made him look serious in spite\nof his efforts to the contrary. Mr. Adolphus Crosbie, secretary to\nthe Board at the General Committee Office, was standing on the rug\nbefore the fire.\n\n\"Who will be there?\" Eames had asked of his friend, when the\nsuggestion to go and dine with Dobbs Broughton had been made to him.\n\n\"Impossible to say,\" Conway had replied. \"A certain horrible fellow\nof the name of Musselboro, will almost certainly be there. He always\nis when they have anything of a swell dinner-party. He is a sort of\npartner of Broughton's in the City. He wears a lot of chains, and has\nelaborate whiskers, and an elaborate waistcoat, which is worse; and\nhe doesn't wash his hands as often as he ought to do.\"\n\n\"An objectionable party, rather, I should say,\" said Eames.\n\n\"Well, yes; Musselboro is objectionable. He's very good-humoured you\nknow, and good-looking in a sort of way, and goes everywhere; that\nis among people of this sort. Of course he's not hand-and-glove with\nLord Derby; and I wish he could be made to wash his hands. They\nhaven't any other standing dish, and you may meet anybody. They\nalways have a Member of Parliament; they generally manage to catch\na Baronet; and I have met a Peer there. On that august occasion\nMusselboro was absent.\"\n\nSo instructed, Eames, on entering the room, looked round at once for\nMr. Musselboro. \"If I don't see the whiskers and chain,\" he had said,\n\"I shall know there's a Peer.\" Mr. Musselboro was in the room, but\nEames had descried Mr. Crosbie long before he had seen Mr.\nMusselboro.\n\nThere was no reason for confusion on his part in meeting Crosbie.\nThey had both loved Lily Dale. Crosbie might have been successful,\nbut for his own fault. Eames had on one occasion been thrown into\ncontact with him, and on that occasion had quarrelled with him and\nhad beaten him, giving him a black eye, and in this way obtaining\nsome mastery over him. There was no reason why he should be ashamed\nof meeting Crosbie; and yet, when he saw him, the blood mounted\nall over his face, and he forgot to make any further search for Mr.\nMusselboro.\n\n\"I am so much obliged to Mr. Dalrymple for bringing you,\" said Mrs.\nDobbs Broughton very sweetly, \"only he ought to have come sooner.\nNaughty man! I know it was his fault. Will you take Miss Demolines\ndown? Miss Demolines,--Mr. Eames.\"\n\nMr. Dobbs Broughton was somewhat sulky and had not welcomed our hero\nvery cordially. He was beginning to think that Conway Dalrymple gave\nhimself airs and did not sufficiently understand that a man who had\nhorses at Market Harboro' and '41 Lafitte was at any rate as good\nas a painter who was pelted with gilt sugar-plums for painting\ncountesses. But he was a man whose ill-humour never lasted long, and\nhe was soon pressing his wine on Johnny Eames as though he loved him\ndearly.\n\nBut there was yet a few minutes before they went down to dinner, and\nJohnny Eames, as he endeavoured to find something to say to Miss\nDemolines,--which was difficult, as he did not in the least know Miss\nDemolines' line of conversation,--was aware that his efforts were\nimpeded by thoughts of Mr. Crosbie. The man looked older than when he\nhad last seen him,--so much older that Eames was astonished. He was\nbald, or becoming bald; and his whiskers were grey, or were becoming\ngrey, and he was much fatter. Johnny Eames, who was always thinking\nof Lily Dale, could not now keep himself from thinking of Adolphus\nCrosbie. He saw at a glance that the man was in mourning, though\nthere was nothing but his shirt-studs by which to tell it; and he\nknew that he was in mourning for his wife. \"I wish she might have\nlived for ever,\" Johnny said to himself.\n\nHe had not yet been definitely called upon by the entrance of the\nservant to offer his arm to Miss Demolines, when Crosbie walked\nacross to him from the rug and addressed him.\n\n\"Mr. Eames,\" said he, \"it is some time since we met.\" And he offered\nhis hand to Johnny.\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" said Johnny, accepting the proffered salutation. \"I\ndon't know exactly how long, but ever so long.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to have the opportunity of shaking hands with you,\"\nsaid Crosbie; and then he retired, as it had become his duty to wait\nwith his arm ready for Mrs. Dobbs Broughton. Having married an earl's\ndaughter he was selected for that honour. There was a barrister in\nthe room, and Mrs. Dobbs Broughton ought to have known better. As\nshe professed to be guided in such matters by the rules laid down by\nthe recognized authorities, she ought to have been aware that a man\ntakes no rank from his wife. But she was entitled I think to merciful\nconsideration for her error. A woman situated as was Mrs. Dobbs\nBroughton cannot altogether ignore these terrible rules. She cannot\nlet her guests draw lots for precedence. She must select some one for\nthe honour of her own arm. And amidst the intricacies of rank how\nis it possible for a woman to learn and to remember everything? If\nProvidence would only send Mrs. Dobbs Broughton a Peer for every\ndinner-party, the thing would go more easily; but what woman will\ntell me, off-hand, which should go out of a room first: a C.B., an\nAdmiral of the Blue, the Dean of Barchester, or the Dean of Arches?\nWho is to know who was everybody's father? How am I to remember that\nyoung Thompson's progenitor was made a baronet and not a knight when\nhe was Lord Mayor? Perhaps Mrs. Dobbs Broughton ought to have known\nthat Mr. Crosbie could have gained nothing by his wife's rank, and\nthe barrister may be considered to have been not immoderately severe\nwhen he simply spoke of her afterwards as the silliest and most\nignorant old woman he had ever met in his life. Eames with the lovely\nMiss Demolines on his arm was the last to move before the hostess.\nMr. Dobbs Broughton had led the way energetically with old Lady\nDemolines. There was no doubt about Lady Demolines,--as his wife\nhad told him, because her title marked her. Her husband had been\na physician in Paris, and had been knighted in consequence of\nsome benefit supposed to have been done to some French scion of\nroyalty,--when such scions in France were royal and not imperial.\nLady Demolines' rank was not much, certainly; but it served to mark\nher, and was beneficial.\n\n[Illustration: \"I am very glad to have the opportunity\nof shaking hands with you.\"]\n\nAs he went downstairs Eames was still thinking of his meeting with\nCrosbie, and had as yet hardly said a word to his neighbour, and his\nneighbour had not said a word to him. Now Johnny understood dinners\nquite well enough to know that in a party of twelve, among whom six\nare ladies, everything depends on your next neighbour, and generally\non the next neighbour who specially belongs to you; and as he took\nhis seat he was a little alarmed as to his prospect for the next two\nhours. On his other hand sat Mrs. Ponsonby, the barrister's wife, and\nhe did not much like the look of Mrs. Ponsonby. She was fat, heavy,\nand good-looking; with a broad space between her eyes, and light\nsmooth hair;--a youthful British matron every inch of her, of whom\nany barrister with a young family of children might be proud. Now\nMiss Demolines, though she was hardly to be called beautiful, was at\nany rate remarkable. She had large, dark, well-shaped eyes, and very\ndark hair, which she wore tangled about in an extraordinary manner,\nand she had an expressive face,--a face made expressive by the\nowner's will. Such power of expression is often attained by dint of\nlabour,--though it never reaches to the expression of anything in\nparticular. She was almost sufficiently good-looking to be justified\nin considering herself to be a beauty.\n\nBut Miss Demolines, though she had said nothing as yet, knew her game\nvery well. A lady cannot begin conversation to any good purpose in\nthe drawing-room, when she is seated and the man is standing;--nor\ncan she know then how the table may subsequently arrange itself.\nPowder may be wasted, and often is wasted, and the spirit rebels\nagainst the necessity of commencing a second enterprise. But Miss\nDemolines, when she found herself seated, and perceived that on the\nother side of her was Mr. Ponsonby, a married man, commenced her\nenterprise at once, and our friend John Eames was immediately aware\nthat he would have no difficulty as to conversation.\n\n\"Don't you like winter dinner-parties?\" began Miss Demolines. This\nwas said just as Johnny was taking his seat, and he had time to\ndeclare that he liked dinner-parties at all periods of the year if\nthe dinner was good and the people pleasant before the host had\nmuttered something which was intended to be understood to be a grace.\n\"But I mean especially in winter,\" continued Miss Demolines. \"I don't\nthink daylight should ever be admitted at a dinner-table; and though\nyou may shut out the daylight, you can't shut out the heat. And then\nthere are always so many other things to go to in May and June and\nJuly. Dinners should be stopped by Act of Parliament for those three\nmonths. I don't care what people do afterwards, because we always fly\naway on the first of August.\n\n\"That is good-natured on your part.\"\n\n\"I'm sure what I say would be for the good of society;--but at this\ntime of the year a dinner is warm and comfortable.\"\n\n\"Very comfortable, I think.\"\n\n\"And people get to know each other;\"--in saying which Miss Demolines\nlooked very pleasantly up into Johnny's face.\n\n\"There is a great deal in that,\" said he. \"I wonder whether you and I\nwill get to know each other?\"\n\n\"Of course we shall;--that is, if I'm worth knowing.\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt about that, I should say.\"\n\n\"Time alone can tell. But, Mr. Eames, I see that Mr. Crosbie is a\nfriend of yours.\"\n\n\"Hardly a friend.\"\n\n\"I know very well that men are friends when they step up and shake\nhands with each other. It is the same as when women kiss.\"\n\n\"When I see women kiss, I always think that there is deep hatred at\nthe bottom of it.\"\n\n\"And there may be deep hatred between you and Mr. Crosbie for\nanything I know to the contrary,\" said Miss Demolines.\n\n\"The very deepest,\" said Johnny, pretending to look grave.\n\n\"Ah; then I know he is your bosom friend, and that you will tell him\nanything I say. What a strange history that was of his marriage!\"\n\n\"So I have heard;--but he is not quite bosom friend enough with me to\nhave told me all the particulars. I know that his wife is dead.\"\n\n\"Dead; oh, yes; she has been dead these two years I should say.\"\n\n\"Not so long as that, I should think.\"\n\n\"Well,--perhaps not. But it's ever so long ago;--quite long enough\nfor him to be married again. Did you know her?\"\n\n\"I never saw her in my life.\"\n\n\"I knew her,--not well indeed; but I am intimate with her sister,\nLady Amelia Gazebee, and I have met her there. None of that family\nhave married what you may call well. And now, Mr. Eames, pray look at\nthe menu and tell me what I am to eat. Arrange for me a little dinner\nof my own, out of the great bill of fare provided. I always expect\nsome gentleman to do that for me. Mr. Crosbie, you know, only lived\nwith his wife for one month.\"\n\n\"So I've been told.\"\n\n\"And a terrible month they had of it. I used to hear of it. He\ndoesn't look that sort of man, does he?\"\n\n\"Well;--no. I don't think he does. But what sort of man do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, such a regular Bluebeard! Of course you know how he treated\nanother girl before he married Lady Alexandrina. She died of\nit,--with a broken heart; absolutely died; and there he is,\nindifferent as possible;--and would treat me in the same way\nto-morrow if I would let him.\"\n\nJohnny Eames, finding it impossible to talk to Miss Demolines about\nLily Dale, took up the card of the dinner and went to work in\nearnest, recommending his neighbour what to eat and what to pass by.\n\"But you've skipped the p\u00c3\u00a2t\u00c3\u00a9,\" she said, with energy.\n\n\"Allow me to ask you to choose mine for me instead. You are much more\nfit to do it.\" And she did choose his dinner for him.\n\nThey were sitting at a round table, and in order that the ladies\nand gentlemen should alternate themselves properly, Mr. Musselboro\nwas opposite to the host. Next to him on his right was old Mrs. Van\nSiever, the widow of a Dutch merchant, who was very rich. She was\na ghastly thing to look at, as well from the quantity as from the\nnature of the wiggeries which she wore. She had not only a false\nfront, but long false curls, as to which it cannot be conceived\nthat she would suppose that any one would be ignorant as to their\nfalseness. She was very thin, too, and very small, and putting aside\nher wiggeries, you would think her to be all eyes. She was a ghastly\nold woman to the sight, and not altogether pleasant in her mode of\ntalking. She seemed to know Mr. Musselboro very well, for she called\nhim by his name without any prefix. He had, indeed, begun life as a\nclerk in her husband's office.\n\n\"Why doesn't What's-his-name have real silver forks?\" she said to\nhim. Now Mrs. What's-his-name,--Mrs. Dobbs Broughton we will call\nher,--was sitting on the other side of Mr. Musselboro, between him\nand Mr. Crosbie; and, so placed, Mr. Musselboro found it rather hard\nto answer the question, more especially as he was probably aware that\nother questions would follow.\n\n\"What's the use?\" said Mr. Musselboro. \"Everybody has these plated\nthings now. What's the use of a lot of capital lying dead?\"\n\n\"Everybody doesn't. I don't. You know as well as I do, Musselboro,\nthat the appearance of the thing goes for a great deal. Capital isn't\nlying dead as long as people know that you've got it.\"\n\nBefore answering this Mr. Musselboro was driven to reflect that Mrs.\nDobbs Broughton would probably hear his reply. \"You won't find that\nthere is any doubt on that head in the City as to Broughton,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"I shan't ask in the City, and if I did, I should not believe what\npeople told me. I think there are sillier folks in the City than\nanywhere else. What did he give for that picture upstairs which the\nyoung man painted?\"\n\n\"What, Mrs. Dobbs Broughton's portrait?\"\n\n\"You don't call that a portrait, do you? I mean the one with the\nthree naked women?\" Mr. Musselboro glanced round with one eye, and\nfelt sure that Mrs. Dobbs Broughton had heard the question. But the\nold woman was determined to have an answer. \"How much did he give for\nit, Musselboro?\"\n\n\"Six hundred pounds, I believe,\" said Mr. Musselboro, looking\nstraight before him as he answered, and pretending to treat the\nsubject with perfect indifference.\n\n\"Did he indeed, now? Six hundred pounds! And yet he hasn't got silver\nspoons. How things are changed! Tell me, Musselboro, who was that\nyoung man who came in with the painter?\"\n\nMr. Musselboro turned round and asked Mrs. Broughton. \"A Mr.\nJohn Eames, Mrs. Van Siever,\" said Mrs. Broughton, whispering\nacross the front of Mr. Musselboro. \"He is private secretary to\nLord--Lord--Lord--I forget who. Some one of the Ministers, I know.\nAnd he had a great fortune left him the other day by Lord--Lord--Lord\nsomebody else.\"\n\n\"All among the lords, I see,\" said Mrs. Van Siever. Then Mrs. Dobbs\nBroughton drew herself back, remembering some little attack which had\nbeen made on her by Mrs. Van Siever when she herself had had the real\nlord to dine with her.\n\nThere was a Miss Van Siever there also, sitting between Crosbie and\nConway Dalrymple. Conway Dalrymple had been specially brought there\nto sit next to Miss Van Siever. \"There's no knowing how much she'll\nhave,\" said Mrs. Dobbs Broughton, in the warmth of her friendship.\n\"But it's all real. It is, indeed. The mother is awfully rich.\"\n\n\"But she's awful in another way, too,\" said Dalrymple.\n\n\"Indeed she is, Conway.\" Mrs. Dobbs Broughton had got into a way of\ncalling her young friend by his Christian name. \"All the world calls\nhim Conway,\" she had said to her husband once when her husband caught\nher doing so. \"She is awful. Her husband made the business in the\nCity, when things were very different from what they are now, and I\ncan't help having her. She has transactions of business with Dobbs.\nBut there's no mistake about the money.\"\n\n\"She needn't leave it to her daughter, I suppose?\"\n\n\"But why shouldn't she? She has nobody else. You might offer to paint\nher, you know. She'd make an excellent picture. So much character.\nYou come and see her.\"\n\nConway Dalrymple had expressed his willingness to meet Miss Van\nSiever, saying something, however, as to his present position being\none which did not admit of any matrimonial speculation. Then Mrs.\nDobbs Broughton had told him, with much seriousness, that he was\naltogether wrong, and that were he to forget himself, or commit\nhimself, or misbehave himself, there must be an end to their pleasant\nintimacy. In answer to which, Mr. Dalrymple had said that his Grace\nwas surely of all Graces the least gracious. And now he had come to\nmeet Miss Van Siever, and was seated next to her at table.\n\nMiss Van Siever, who at this time had perhaps reached her\ntwenty-fifth year, was certainly a handsome young woman. She was fair\nand large, bearing no likeness whatever to her mother. Her features\nwere regular, and her full, clear eyes had a brilliance of their\nown, looking at you always stedfastly and boldly, though very\nseldom pleasantly. Her mouth would have been beautiful had it not\nbeen too strong for feminine beauty. Her teeth were perfect,--too\nperfect,--looking like miniature walls of carved ivory. She knew\nthe fault of this perfection, and shewed her teeth as little as she\ncould. Her nose and chin were finely chiselled, and her head stood\nwell upon her shoulders. But there was something hard about it all\nwhich repelled you. Dalrymple, when he saw her, recoiled from her,\nnot outwardly, but inwardly. Yes, she was handsome, as may be a horse\nor a tiger; but there was about her nothing of feminine softness.\nHe could not bring himself to think of taking Clara Van Siever as\nthe model that was to sit before him for the rest of his life. He\ncertainly could make a picture of her, as had been suggested by his\nfriend, Mrs. Broughton, but it must be as Judith with the dissevered\nhead, or as Jael using her hammer over the temple of Sisera. Yes,--he\nthought she would do as Jael; and if Mrs. Van Siever would throw\nhim a sugar-plum,--for he would want the sugar-plum, seeing that\nany other result was out of the question,--the thing might be done.\nSuch was the idea of Mr. Conway Dalrymple respecting Miss Van\nSiever,--before he led her down to dinner.\n\nAt first he found it hard to talk to her. She answered him, and\nnot with monosyllables. But she answered him without sympathy, or\napparent pleasure in talking. Now the young artist was in the habit\nof being flattered by ladies, and expected to have his small talk\nmade very easy for him. He liked to give himself little airs, and\nwas not generally disposed to labour very hard at the task of making\nhimself agreeable.\n\n\"Were you ever painted yet?\" he asked her after they had both been\nsitting silent for two or three minutes.\n\n\"Was I ever--ever painted? In what way?\"\n\n\"I don't mean rouged, or enamelled, or got up by Madame Rachel; but\nhave you ever had your portrait taken?\"\n\n\"I have been photographed,--of course.\"\n\n\"That's why I asked you if you had been painted,--so as to make some\nlittle distinction between the two. I am a painter by profession, and\ndo portraits.\"\n\n\"So Mrs. Broughton told me.\"\n\n\"I am not asking for a job, you know.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure of that.\"\n\n\"But I should have thought you would have been sure to have sat to\nsomebody.\"\n\n\"I never did. I never thought of doing so. One does those things at\nthe instigation of one's intimate friends,--fathers, mothers, uncles,\nand aunts, and the like.\"\n\n\"Or husbands, perhaps,--or lovers?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; my intimate friend is my mother, and she would never\ndream of such a thing. She hates pictures.\"\n\n\"Hates pictures!\"\n\n\"And especially portraits. And I'm afraid, Mr. Dalrymple, she hates\nartists.\"\n\n\"Good heavens; how cruel! I suppose there is some story attached\nto it. There has been some fatal likeness,--some terrible\npicture,--something in her early days?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind, Mr. Dalrymple. It is merely the fact that her\nsympathies are with ugly things, rather than with pretty things. I\nthink she loves the mahogany dinner-table better than anything else\nin the house; and she likes to have everything dark, and plain, and\nsolid.\"\n\n\"And good?\"\n\n\"Good of its kind, certainly.\"\n\n\"If everybody was like your mother, how would the artists live?\"\n\n\"There would be none.\"\n\n\"And the world, you think, would be none the poorer?\"\n\n\"I did not speak of myself. I think the world would be very much\nthe poorer. I am very fond of the ancient masters, though I do not\nsuppose that I understand them.\"\n\n\"They are easier understood than the modern, I can tell you. Perhaps\nyou don't care for modern pictures?\"\n\n\"Not in comparison, certainly. If that is uncivil, you have brought\nit on yourself. But I do not in truth mean anything derogatory to the\npainters of the day. When their pictures are old, they,--that is the\ngood ones among them,--will be nice also.\"\n\n\"Pictures are like wine, and want age, you think?\"\n\n\"Yes, and statues too, and buildings above all things. The colours\nof new paintings are so glaring, and the faces are so bright and\nself-conscious, that they look to me when I go to the exhibition like\ncoloured prints in a child's new picture-book. It is the same thing\nwith buildings. One sees all the points, and nothing is left to the\nimagination.\"\n\n\"I find I have come across a real critic.\"\n\n\"I hope, at any rate, I am not a sham one;\" and Miss Van Siever as\nshe said this looked very savage.\n\n\"I shouldn't take you to be a sham in anything.\"\n\n\"Ah, that would be saying a great deal for myself. Who can undertake\nto say that he is not a sham in anything?\"\n\nAs she said this the ladies were getting up. So Miss Van Siever also\ngot up, and left Mr. Conway Dalrymple to consider whether he could\nsay or could think of himself that he was not a sham in anything.\nAs regarded Miss Clara Van Siever, he began to think that he should\nnot object to paint her portrait, even though there might be no\nsugar-plum. He would certainly do it as Jael; and he would, if he\ndared, insert dimly in the background some idea of the face of\nthe mother, half-appearing, half-vanishing, as the spirit of the\nsacrifice. He was composing his picture, while Mr. Dobbs Broughton\nwas arranging himself and his bottles.\n\n\"Musselboro,\" he said, \"I'll come up between you and Crosbie. Mr.\nEames, though I run away from you, the claret shall remain; or,\nrather, it shall flow backwards and forwards as rapidly as you will.\"\n\n\"I'll keep it moving,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Do; there's a good fellow. It's a nice glass of wine, isn't it? Old\nRamsby, who keeps as good a stock of stuff as any wine-merchant in\nLondon, gave me a hint, three or four years ago, that he'd a lot of\ntidy Bordeaux. It's '41, you know. He had ninety dozen, and I took it\nall.\"\n\n\"What was the figure, Broughton?\" said Crosbie, asking the question\nwhich he knew was expected.\n\n\"Well, I only gave one hundred and four for it then; it's worth a\nhundred and twenty now. I wouldn't sell a bottle of it for any money.\nCome, Dalrymple, pass it round; but fill your glass first.\"\n\n\"Thank you, no; I don't like it. I'll drink sherry.\"\n\n\"Don't like it!\" said Dobbs Broughton.\n\n\"It's strange, isn't it? but I don't.\"\n\n\"I thought you particularly told me to drink his claret?\" said Johnny\nto his friend afterwards.\n\n\"So I did,\" said Conway; \"and wonderfully good wine it is. But I make\nit a rule never to eat or drink anything in a man's house when he\npraises it himself and tells me the price of it.\"\n\n\"And I make it a rule never to cut the nose off my own face,\" said\nJohnny.\n\nBefore they went, Johnny Eames had been specially invited to call\non Lady Demolines, and had said that he would do so. \"We live in\nPorchester Gardens,\" said Miss Demolines. \"Upon my word, I believe\nthat the farther London stretches in that direction, the farther\nmamma will go. She thinks the air so much better. I know it's a long\nway.\"\n\n\"Distance is nothing to me,\" said Johnny; \"I can always set off over\nnight.\"\n\nConway Dalrymple did not get invited to call on Mrs. Van Siever, but\nbefore he left the house he did say a word or two more to his friend\nMrs. Broughton as to Clara Van Siever. \"She is a fine young woman,\"\nhe said; \"she is indeed.\"\n\n\"You have found it out, have you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have found it out. I do not doubt that some day she'll\nmurder her husband or her mother, or startle the world by some\nnewly-invented crime; but that only makes her the more interesting.\"\n\n\"And when you add to that all the old woman's money,\" said Mrs. Dobbs\nBroughton, \"you think that she might do?\"\n\n\"For a picture, certainly. I'm speaking of her simply as a model.\nCould we not manage it? Get her once here, without her mother knowing\nit, or Broughton, or any one. I've got the subject,--Jael and Sisera,\nyou know. I should like to put Musselboro in as Sisera, with the nail\nhalf driven in.\" Mrs. Dobbs Broughton declared that the scheme was a\ngreat deal too wicked for her participation, but at last she promised\nto think of it.\n\n\"You might as well come up and have a cigar,\" Dalrymple said, as he\nand his friend left Mr. Broughton's house. Johnny said that he would\ngo up and have a cigar or two. \"And now tell me what you think of\nMrs. Dobbs Broughton and her set,\" said Conway.\n\n\"Well; I'll tell you what I think of them. I think they stink of\nmoney, as the people say; but I'm not sure that they've got any all\nthe same.\"\n\n\"I should suppose he makes a large income.\"\n\n\"Very likely, and perhaps spends more than he makes. A good deal of\nit looked to me like make-believe. There's no doubt about the claret,\nbut the champagne was execrable. A man is a criminal to have such\nstuff handed round to his guests. And there isn't the ring of real\ngold about the house.\"\n\n\"I hate the ring of the gold, as you call it,\" said the artist.\n\n\"So do I,--I hate it like poison; but if it is there, I like it to be\ntrue. There is a sort of persons going now,--and one meets them out\nhere and there every day of one's life,--who are downright Brummagem\nto the ear and to the touch and to the sight, and we recognize them\nas such at the very first moment. My honoured lord and master, Sir\nRaffle, is one such. There is no mistaking him. Clap him down upon\nthe counter, and he rings dull and untrue at once. Pardon me, my\ndear Conway, if I say the same of your excellent friend Mr. Dobbs\nBroughton.\"\n\n\"I think you go a little too far, but I don't deny it. What you mean\nis, that he's not a gentleman.\"\n\n\"I mean a great deal more than that. Bless you, when you come to talk\nof a gentleman, who is to define the word? How do I know whether or\nno I'm a gentleman myself? When I used to be in Burton Crescent, I\nwas hardly a gentleman then,--sitting at the same table with Mrs.\nRoper and the Lupexes;--do you remember them, and the lovely Amelia?\"\n\n\"I suppose you were a gentleman, then, as well as now.\"\n\n\"You, if you had been painting duchesses then, with a studio in\nKensington Gardens, would not have said so, if you had happened to\ncome across me. I can't define a gentleman, even in my own mind;--but\nI can define the sort of man with whom I think I can live\npleasantly.\"\n\n\"And poor Dobbs doesn't come within the line?\"\n\n\"N--o, not quite; a very nice fellow, I'm quite sure, and I'm very\nmuch obliged to you for taking me there.\"\n\n\"I never will take you to any house again. And what did you think of\nhis wife?\"\n\n\"That's a horse of another colour altogether. A pretty woman with\nsuch a figure as hers has got a right to be anything she pleases.\nI see you are a great favourite.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not;--not especially. I do like her. She wants to make up a\nmatch between me and that Miss Van Siever. Miss Van is to have gold\nby the ingot, and jewels by the bushel, and a hatful of bank shares,\nand a whole mine in Cornwall, for her fortune.\"\n\n\"And is very handsome into the bargain.\"\n\n\"Yes; she's handsome.\"\n\n\"So is her mother,\" said Johnny. \"If you take the daughter, I'll\ntake the mother, and see if I can't do you out of a mine or two.\nGood-night, old fellow. I'm only joking about old Dobbs. I'll go and\ndine there again to-morrow, if you like it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nMISS MADALINA DEMOLINES.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I don't think you care two straws about her,\" Conway Dalrymple\nsaid to his friend John Eames, two days after the dinner-party at\nMrs. Dobbs Broughton's. The painter was at work in his studio, and\nthe private secretary from the Income-tax Office, who was no doubt\nengaged on some special mission to the West End on the part of Sir\nRaffle Buffle, was sitting in a lounging-chair and smoking a cigar.\n\n\"Because I don't go about with my stockings cross-gartered, and do\nthat kind of business?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; because you don't do that kind of business, more or\nless.\"\n\n\"It isn't in my line, my dear fellow. I know what you mean, very\nwell. I daresay, artistically speaking,--\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass, Johnny.\"\n\n\"Well then, poetically, or romantically, if you like that better,-- I\ndaresay that poetically or romantically I am deficient. I eat my\ndinner very well, and I don't suppose I ought to do that; and, if\nyou'll believe me, I find myself laughing sometimes.\"\n\n\"I never knew a man who laughed so much. You're always laughing.\"\n\n\"And that, you think, is a bad sign?\"\n\n\"I don't believe you really care about her. I think you are aware\nthat you have got a love-affair on hand, and that you hang on to it\nrather persistently, having in some way come to a resolution that\nyou would be persistent. But there isn't much heart in it. I daresay\nthere was once.\"\n\n\"And that is your opinion?\"\n\n\"You are just like some of those men who for years past have been\ngoing to write a book on some new subject. The intention has been\nsincere at first, and it never altogether dies away. But the would-be\nauthor, though he still talks of his work, knows that it will never\nbe executed, and is very patient under the disappointment. All\nenthusiasm about the thing is gone, but he is still known as the man\nwho is going to do it some day. You are the man who means to marry\nMiss Dale in five, ten, or twenty years' time.\"\n\n\"Now, Conway, all that is thoroughly unfair. The would-be author\ntalks of his would-be book to everybody. I have never talked of Miss\nDale to any one but you, and one or two very old family friends. And\nfrom year to year, and from month to month, I have done all that has\nbeen in my power to win her. I don't think I shall ever succeed, and\nyet I am as determined about it as I was when I first began it,--or\nrather much more so. If I do not marry Lily, I shall never marry at\nall, and if anybody were to tell me to-morrow that she had made up\nher mind to have me, I should well nigh go mad for joy. But I am not\ngoing to give up all my life for love. Indeed the less I can bring\nmyself to give up for it, the better I shall think of myself. Now\nI'll go away and call on old lady Demolines.\n\n\"And flirt with her daughter.\"\n\n\"Yes;--flirt with her daughter, if I get the opportunity. Why\nshouldn't I flirt with her daughter?\"\n\n\"Why not, if you like it?\"\n\n\"I don't like it,--not particularly, that is; because the young lady\nis not very pretty, nor yet very graceful, nor yet very wise.\"\n\n\"She is pretty after a fashion,\" said the artist, \"and if not wise,\nshe is at any rate clever.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I do not like her,\" said John Eames.\n\n\"Then why do you go there?\"\n\n\"One has to be civil to people though they are neither pretty nor\nwise. I don't mean to insinuate that Miss Demolines is particularly\nbad, or indeed that she is worse than young ladies in general. I only\nabused her because there was an insinuation in what you said, that I\nwas going to amuse myself with Miss Demolines in the absence of Miss\nDale. The one thing has nothing to do with the other thing. Nothing\nthat I shall say to Miss Demolines will at all militate against my\nloyalty to Lily.\"\n\n\"All right, old fellow;--I didn't mean to put you on your purgation.\nI want you to look at that sketch. Do you know for whom it is\nintended?\" Johnny took up a scrap of paper, and having scrutinized it\nfor a minute or two declared that he had not the slightest idea who\nwas represented. \"You know the subject,--the story that is intended\nto be told?\" said Dalrymple.\n\n\"Upon my word I don't. There's some old fellow seems to be catching\nit over the head; but it's all so confused I can't make much of it.\nThe woman seems to be uncommon angry.\"\n\n\"Do you ever read your Bible?\"\n\n\"Ah, dear! not as often as I ought to do. Ah, I see; it's Sisera. I\nnever could quite believe that story. Jael might have killed Captain\nSisera in his sleep,--for which, by-the-by, she ought to have been\nhung, and she might possibly have done it with a hammer and a nail.\nBut she could not have driven it through, and staked him to the\nground.\"\n\n\"I've warrant enough for putting it into a picture, at any rate. My\nJael there is intended for Miss Van Siever.\"\n\n\"Miss Van Siever! Well, it is like her. Has she sat for it?\"\n\n\"O dear, no; not yet. I mean to get her to do so. There's a strength\nabout her, which would make her sit the part admirably. And I fancy\nshe would like to be driving a nail into a fellow's head. I think I\nshall take Musselboro for a Sisera.\"\n\n\"You're not in earnest?\"\n\n\"He would just do for it. But of course I shan't ask him to sit, as\nmy Jael would not like it. She would not consent to operate on so\nbase a subject. So you really are going down to Guestwick?\"\n\n\"Yes; I start to-morrow. Good-by, old fellow. I'll come and sit for\nSisera if you'll let me;--only Miss Van Jael shall have a blunted\nnail, if you please.\"\n\nThen Johnny left the artist's room and walked across from Kensington\nto Lady Demolines' house. As he went he partly accused himself, and\npartly excused himself in that matter of his love for Lily Dale.\nThere were moments of his life in which he felt that he would\nwillingly die for her,--that life was not worth having without\nher,--in which he went about inwardly reproaching fortune for having\ntreated him so cruelly. Why should she not be his? He half believed\nthat she loved him. She had almost told him so. She could not\nsurely still love that other man who had treated her with such vile\nfalsehood? As he considered the question in all its bearings he\nassured himself over and over again that there would be now no fear\nof that rival;--and yet he had such fears, and hated Crosbie almost\nas much as ever. It was a thousand pities, certainly, that the man\nshould have been made free by the death of his wife. But it could\nhardly be that he should seek Lily again, or that Lily, if so sought,\nshould even listen to him. But yet there he was, free once more,--an\nodious being, whom Johnny was determined to sacrifice to his\nvengeance, if cause for such sacrifice should occur. And thus\nthinking of the real truth of his love, he endeavoured to excuse\nhimself to himself from that charge of vagueness and laxness which\nhis friend Conway Dalrymple had brought against him. And then again\nhe accused himself of the same sin. If he had been positively in\nearnest, with downright manly earnestness, would he have allowed the\nthing to drag itself on with a weak uncertain life, as it had done\nfor the last two or three years? Lily Dale had been a dream to him in\nhis boyhood; and he had made a reality of his dream as soon as he had\nbecome a man. But before he had been able, as a man, to tell his love\nto the girl whom he had loved as a child, another man had intervened,\nand his prize had been taken from him. Then the wretched victor\nhad thrown his treasure away, and he, John Eames, had been content\nto stoop to pick it up,--was content to do so now. But there was\nsomething which he felt to be unmanly in the constant stooping.\nDalrymple had told him that he was like a man who is ever writing\na book and yet never writes it. He would make another attempt to\nget his book written,--an attempt into which he would throw all his\nstrength and all his heart. He would do his very best to make Lily\nhis own. But if he failed now, he would have done with it. It seemed\nto him to be below his dignity as a man to be always coveting a thing\nwhich he could not obtain.\n\nJohnny was informed by the boy in buttons, who opened the door for\nhim at Lady Demolines', that the ladies were at home, and he was\nshown up into the drawing-room. Here he was allowed full ten minutes\nto explore the knicknacks on the table, and open the photograph book,\nand examine the furniture, before Miss Demolines made her appearance.\nWhen she did come, her hair was tangled more marvellously even than\nwhen he saw her at the dinner-party, and her eyes were darker, and\nher cheeks thinner. \"I'm afraid mamma won't be able to come down,\"\nsaid Miss Demolines. \"She will be so sorry; but she is not quite well\nto-day. The wind is in the east, she says, and when she says the wind\nis in the east she always refuses to be well.\"\n\n\"Then I should tell her it was in the west.\"\n\n\"But it is in the east.\"\n\n\"Ah, there I can't help you, Miss Demolines. I never know which is\neast, and which west; and if I did, I shouldn't know from which point\nthe wind blew.\"\n\n\"At any rate mamma can't come downstairs, and you must excuse her.\nWhat a very nice woman Mrs. Dobbs Broughton is.\" Johnny acknowledged\nthat Mrs. Dobbs Broughton was charming. \"And Mr. Broughton is so\ngood-natured!\" Johnny again assented. \"I like him of all things,\"\nsaid Miss Demolines. \"So do I,\" said Johnny;--\"I never liked anybody\nso much in my life. I suppose one is bound to say that kind of\nthing.\" \"Oh, you ill-natured man,\" said Miss Demolines. \"I suppose\nyou think that poor Mr. Broughton is a little--just a little,--you\nknow what I mean.\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Yes, you do; you know very well what I mean. And of course he is.\nHow can he help it?\"\n\n\"Poor fellow,--no. I don't suppose he can help it, or he\nwould;--wouldn't he?\"\n\n\"Of course Mr. Broughton had not the advantage of birth or much early\neducation. All his friends know that, and make allowance accordingly.\nWhen she married him, she was aware of his deficiency, and made up\nher mind to put up with it.\"\n\n\"It was very kind of her; don't you think so?\"\n\n\"I knew Maria Clutterbuck for years before she was married. Of course\nshe was very much my senior, but, nevertheless, we were friends.\nI think I was hardly more than twelve years old when I first began\nto correspond with Maria. She was then past twenty. So you see, Mr.\nEames, I make no secret of my age.\"\n\n\"Why should you?\"\n\n\"But never mind that. Everybody knows that Maria Clutterbuck was\nvery much admired. Of course I'm not going to tell you or any other\ngentleman all her history.\"\n\n\"I was in hopes you were.\"\n\n\"Then certainly your hopes will be frustrated, Mr. Eames. But\nundoubtedly when she told us that she was going to take Dobbs\nBroughton, we were a little disappointed. Maria Clutterbuck had\nbeen used to a better kind of life. You understand what I mean, Mr.\nEames?\"\n\n\"Oh, exactly;--and yet it's not a bad kind of life, either.\"\n\n\"No, no; that is true. It has its attractions. She keeps her\ncarriage, sees a good deal of company, has an excellent house, and\ngoes abroad for six weeks every year. But you know, Mr. Eames, there\nis, perhaps, a little uncertainty about it.\"\n\n\"Life is always uncertain, Miss Demolines.\"\n\n\"You're quizzing now, I know. But don't you feel now, really, that\nCity money is always very chancy? It comes and goes so quick.\"\n\n\"As regards the going, I think that's the same with all money,\" said\nJohnny.\n\n\"Not with land, or the funds. Mamma has every shilling laid out in\na first-class mortgage on land at four per cent. That does make one\nfeel so secure! The land can't run away.\"\n\n\"But you think poor Broughton's money may?\"\n\n\"It's all speculation, you know. I don't believe she minds it; I\ndon't, indeed. She lives that kind of fevered life now that she likes\nexcitement. Of course we all know that Mr. Dobbs Broughton is not\nwhat we can call an educated gentleman. His manners are against him,\nand he is very ignorant. Even dear Maria would admit that.\"\n\n\"One would perhaps let that pass without asking her opinion at all.\"\n\n\"She has acknowledged it to me, twenty times. But he is very\ngood-natured, and lets her do pretty nearly anything that she likes.\nI only hope she won't trespass on his good-nature. I do, indeed.\"\n\n\"You mean, spend too much money?\"\n\n\"No; I didn't mean that exactly. Of course she ought to be moderate,\nand I hope she is. To that kind of fevered existence profuse\nexpenditure is perhaps necessary. But I was thinking of something\nelse. I fear she is a little giddy.\"\n\n\"Dear me! I should have thought she was too--too--too--\"\n\n\"You mean too old for anything of that kind. Maria Broughton must be\nthirty-three if she's a day.\"\n\n\"That would make you just twenty-five,\" said Johnny, feeling\nperfectly sure as he said so that the lady whom he was addressing was\nat any rate past thirty!\n\n\"Never mind my age, Mr. Eames; whether I am twenty-five, or a\nhundred-and-five, has nothing to do with poor Maria Clutterbuck. But\nnow I'll tell you why I mention all this to you. You must have seen\nhow foolish she is about your friend Mr. Dalrymple?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I haven't.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Mr. Eames; you have. If she were your wife, would you like\nher to call a man Conway? Of course you would not. I don't mean to\nsay that there's anything in it. I know Maria's principles too well\nto suspect that. It's merely because she's flighty and fevered.\"\n\n\"That fevered existence accounts for it all,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"No doubt it does,\" said Miss Demolines, with a nod of her head,\nwhich was intended to show that she was willing to give her friend\nthe full benefit of any excuse which could be offered for her. \"But\ndon't you think you could do something, Mr. Eames?\"\n\n\"I do something?\"\n\n\"Yes, you. You and Mr. Dalrymple are such friends! If you were just\nto point out to him you know--\"\n\n\"Point out what? Tell him that he oughtn't to be called Conway?\nBecause, after all, I suppose that's the worst of it. If you mean to\nsay that Dalrymple is in love with Mrs. Broughton, you never made a\ngreater mistake in your life.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; not in love. That would be terrible, you know.\" And Miss\nDemolines shook her head sadly. \"But there may be so much mischief\ndone without anything of that kind! Thoughtlessness, you know, Mr.\nEames,--pure thoughtlessness! Think of what I have said, and if\nyou can speak a word to your friend, do. And now I want to ask you\nsomething else. I'm so glad you are come, because circumstances have\nseemed to make it necessary that you and I should know each other.\nWe may be of so much use if we put our heads together.\" Johnny bowed\nwhen he heard this, but made no immediate reply. \"Have you heard\nanything about a certain picture that is being planned?\" Johnny did\nnot wish to answer this question, but Miss Demolines paused so long,\nand looked so earnestly into his face, that he found himself forced\nto say something.\n\n\"What picture?\"\n\n\"A certain picture that is--, or, perhaps, that is not to be, painted\nby Mr. Dalrymple?\"\n\n\"I hear so much about Dalrymple's pictures! You don't mean the\nportrait of Lady Glencora Palliser? That is nearly finished, and will\nbe in the Exhibition this year.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that at all. I mean a picture that has not yet been\nbegun.\"\n\n\"A portrait, I suppose?\"\n\n\"As to that I cannot quite say. It is at any rate to be a likeness.\nI am sure you have heard of it. Come, Mr. Eames; it would be better\nthat we should be candid with each other. You remember Miss Van\nSiever, of course?\"\n\n\"I remember that she dined at the Broughtons'.\"\n\n\"And you have heard of Jael, I suppose, and Sisera?\"\n\n\"Yes; in a general way,--in the Bible.\"\n\n\"And now will you tell me whether you have not heard the names of\nJael and Miss Van Siever coupled together? I see you know all about\nit.\"\n\n\"I have heard of it, certainly.\"\n\n\"Of course you have. So have I, as you perceive. Now, Mr.\nEames,\"--and Miss Demolines' voice became tremulously eager as she\naddressed him,--\"it is your duty, and it is my duty, to take care\nthat that picture shall never be painted.\"\n\n\"But why should it not be painted?\"\n\n\"You don't know Miss Van Siever, yet.\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Nor Mrs. Van Siever.\"\n\n\"I never spoke a word to her.\"\n\n\"I do. I know them both,--well.\" There was something almost grandly\ntragic in Miss Demolines' voice as she thus spoke. \"Yes, Mr. Eames,\nI know them well. If that scheme be continued, it will work terrible\nmischief. You and I must prevent it.\"\n\n\"But I don't see what harm it will do.\"\n\n\"Think of Conway Dalrymple passing so many hours in Maria's\nsitting-room upstairs! The picture is to be painted there, you know.\"\n\n\"But Miss Van Siever will be present. Won't that make it all right?\nWhat is there wrong about Miss Van Siever?\"\n\n\"I won't deny that Clara Van Siever has a certain beauty of her own.\nTo me she is certainly the most unattractive woman that I ever came\nnear. She is simply repulsive!\" Hereupon Miss Demolines held up her\nhand as though she were banishing Miss Van Siever for ever from\nher sight, and shuddered slightly. \"Men think her handsome, and\nshe is handsome. But she is false, covetous, malicious, cruel, and\ndishonest.\"\n\n\"What a fiend in petticoats!\"\n\n\"You may say that, Mr. Eames. And then her mother! Her mother is\nnot so bad. Her mother is very different. But the mother is an\nodious woman, too. It was an evil day for Maria Clutterbuck when\nshe first saw either the mother or the daughter. I tell you that in\nconfidence.\"\n\n\"But what can I do?\" said Johnny, who began to be startled and almost\ninterested by the eagerness of the woman.\n\n\"I'll tell you what you can do. Don't let your friend go to Mr.\nBroughton's house to paint the picture. If he does do it, there will\nmischief come of it. Of course you can prevent him.\"\n\n\"I should not think of trying to prevent him unless I knew why.\"\n\n\"She's a nasty proud minx, and it would set her up ever so high,--to\nthink that she was being painted by Mr. Dalrymple! But that isn't the\nreason. Maria would get into terrible trouble about it, and there\nwould be no end of mischief. I must not tell you more now, and if you\ndo not believe me, I cannot help it. Surely, Mr. Eames, my word may\nbe taken as going for something? And when I ask you to help me in\nthis, I do expect that you will not refuse me.\" By this time Miss\nDemolines was sitting close to him, and had more than once put\nher hand upon his arm in the energy of her eloquence. Then as he\nremembered that he had never seen Miss Demolines till the other\nday, or Miss Van Siever, or even Mrs. Dobbs Broughton, he bethought\nhimself that it was all very droll. Nevertheless he had no objection\nto Miss Demolines putting her hand upon his arm.\n\n\"I never like to interfere in anything that does not seem to be my\nown business,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Is not your friend's business your own business? What does\nfriendship mean if it is not so? And when I tell you that it is my\nbusiness, mine of right, does that go for nothing with you? I thought\nI might depend upon you, Mr. Eames; I did indeed.\" Then again she put\nher hand upon his arm, and as he looked into her eyes he began to\nthink that after all she was good-looking in a certain way. At any\nrate she had fine eyes, and there was something picturesque about the\nentanglement of her hair. \"Think of it, and then come back and talk\nto me again,\" said Miss Demolines.\n\n\"But I am going out of town to-morrow.\"\n\n\"For how long?\"\n\n\"For ten days.\"\n\n\"Nothing can be done during that time. Clara Van Siever is going\naway in a day, and will not be back for three weeks. I happen to\nknow that; so we have plenty of time for working. It would be very\ndesirable that she should never even hear of it; but that cannot be\nhoped, as Maria has such a tongue! Couldn't you see Mr. Dalrymple\nto-night?\"\n\n\"Well, no; I don't think I could.\"\n\n\"Mind, at least, that you come to me as soon as ever you return.\"\n\nBefore he got out of the house, which he did after a most\naffectionate farewell, Johnny felt himself compelled to promise that\nhe would come to Miss Demolines again as soon as he got back to town;\nand as the door was closed behind him by the boy in buttons, he made\nup his mind that he certainly would call as soon as he returned to\nLondon. \"It's as good as a play,\" he said to himself. Not that he\ncared in the least for Miss Demolines, or that he would take any\nsteps with the intention of preventing the painting of the picture.\nMiss Demolines had some battle to fight, and he would leave her to\nfight it with her own weapons. If his friend chose to paint a picture\nof Jael, and take Miss Van Siever as a model, it was no business of\nhis. Nevertheless he would certainly go and see Miss Demolines again,\nbecause, as he said, she was as good as a play.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nTHE PICTURE.\n\n\nOn that same afternoon Conway Dalrymple rolled up his sketch of\nJael and Sisera, put it into his pocket, dressed himself with some\nconsiderable care, putting on a velvet coat which he was in the habit\nof wearing out of doors when he did not intend to wander beyond\nKensington Gardens and the neighbourhood and which was supposed to\nbecome him well, yellow gloves, and a certain Spanish hat of which he\nwas fond, and slowly sauntered across to the house of his friend Mrs.\nDobbs Broughton. When the door was opened to him he did not ask if\nthe lady were at home, but muttering some word to the servant, made\nhis way through the hall, upstairs, to a certain small sitting-room\nlooking to the north, which was much used by the mistress of the\nhouse. It was quite clear that Conway Dalrymple had arranged his\nvisit beforehand, and that he was expected. He opened the door\nwithout knocking, and, though the servant had followed him, he\nentered without being announced. \"I'm afraid I'm late,\" he said, as\nhe gave his hand to Mrs. Broughton; \"but for the life I could not get\naway sooner.\"\n\n\"You are quite in time,\" said the lady, \"for any good that you are\nlikely to do.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means this, my friend, that you had better give the idea up. I\nhave been thinking of it all day, and I do not approve of it.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\"\n\n\"Of course you will say so, Conway. I have observed of late that\nwhatever I say to you is called nonsense. I suppose it is the new\nfashion that gentlemen should so express themselves, but I am not\nquite sure that I like it.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean. I am very anxious about this picture, and I\nshall be much disappointed if it cannot be done now. It was you put\nit into my head first.\"\n\n\"I regret it very much, I can assure you; but it will not be generous\nin you to urge that against me.\"\n\n\"But why shouldn't it succeed?\"\n\n\"There are many reasons,--some personal to myself.\"\n\n\"I do not know what they can be. You hinted at something which I only\ntook as having been said in joke.\"\n\n\"If you mean about Miss Van Siever and yourself, I was quite in\nearnest, Conway. I do not think you could do better, and I should be\nglad to see it of all things. Nothing would please me more than to\nbring Miss Van Siever and you together.\"\n\n\"And nothing would please me less.\"\n\n\"But why so?\"\n\n\"Because,--because--. I can do nothing but tell you the truth,\ncarina; because my heart is not free to present itself at Miss Van\nSiever's feet.\"\n\n\"It ought to be free, Conway, and you must make it free. It will\nbe well that you should be married, and well for others besides\nyourself. I tell you so as your friend, and you have no truer friend.\nSit where you are, if you please. You can say anything you have to\nsay without stalking about the room.\"\n\n\"I was not going to stalk,--as you call it.\"\n\n\"You will be safer and quieter while you are sitting. I heard a knock\nat the door, and I do not doubt that it is Clara. She said she would\nbe here.\"\n\n\"And you have told her of the picture?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have told her. She said that it would be impossible, and that\nher mother would not allow it. Here she is.\" Then Miss Van Siever\nwas shown into the room, and Dalrymple perceived that she was a girl\nthe peculiarity of whose complexion bore daylight better even than\ncandlelight. There was something in her countenance which seemed to\ndeclare that she could bear any light to which it might be subjected\nwithout flinching from it. And her bonnet, which was very plain,\nand her simple brown morning gown, suited her well. She was one who\nrequired none of the circumstances of studied dress to carry off\naught in her own appearance. She could look her best when other women\nlook their worst, and could dare to be seen at all times. Dalrymple,\nwith an artist's eye, saw this at once, and immediately confessed to\nhimself that there was something great about her. He could not deny\nher beauty. But there was ever present to him that look of hardness\nwhich had struck him when he first saw her. He could not but fancy\nthat though at times she might be playful, and allow the fur of\nher coat to be stroked with good-humour,--she would be a dangerous\nplaything, using her claws unpleasantly when the good-humour should\nhave passed away. But not the less was she beautiful, and--beyond\nthat and better than that, for his purpose,--she was picturesque.\n\n\"Clara,\" said Mrs. Broughton, \"here is this mad painter, and he says\nthat he will have you on his canvas, either with your will or without\nit.\"\n\n\"Even if he could do that, I am sure he would not,\" said Miss Van\nSiever.\n\n\"To prove to you that I can, I think I need only show you the\nsketch,\" said Dalrymple, taking the drawing out of his pocket. \"As\nregards the face, I know it so well by heart already, that I feel\ncertain I could produce a likeness without even a sitting. What do\nyou think of it, Mrs. Broughton?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"What do you think of it, Mrs. Broughton?\"]\n\n\"It is clever,\" said she, looking at it with all that enthusiasm\nwhich women are able to throw into their eyes on such occasions;\n\"very clever. The subject would just suit her. I have never doubted\nthat.\"\n\n\"Eames says that it is confused,\" said the artist.\n\n\"I don't see that at all,\" said Mrs. Broughton.\n\n\"Of course a sketch must be rough. This one has been rubbed about and\naltered,--but I think there is something in it.\"\n\n\"An immense deal,\" said Mrs. Broughton. \"Don't you think so, Clara?\"\n\n\"I am not a judge.\"\n\n\"But you can see the woman's fixed purpose; and her stealthiness as\nwell;--and the man sleeps like a log. What is that dim outline?\"\n\n\"Nothing in particular,\" said Dalrymple. But the dim outline was\nintended to represent Mrs. Van Siever.\n\n\"It is very good,--unquestionably good,\" said Mrs. Dobbs Broughton.\n\"I do not for a moment doubt that you would make a great picture of\nit. It is just the subject for you, Conway; so much imagination, and\nyet such a scope for portraiture. It would be full of action, and yet\nsuch perfect repose. And the lights and shadows would be exactly in\nyour line. I can see at a glance how you would manage the light in\nthe tent, and bring it down just on the nail. And then the pose of\nthe woman would be so good, so much strength, and yet such grace!\nYou should have the bowl he drank the milk out of, so as to tell\nthe whole story. No painter living tells a story so well as you do,\nConway.\" Conway Dalrymple knew that the woman was talking nonsense to\nhim, and yet he liked it, and liked her for talking it.\n\n\"But Mr. Dalrymple can paint his Sisera without making me a Jael,\"\nsaid Miss Van Siever.\n\n\"Of course he can,\" said Mrs. Broughton.\n\n\"But I never will,\" said the artist. \"I conceived the subject as\nconnected with you, and I will never disjoin the two ideas.\"\n\n\"I think it no compliment, I can assure you,\" said Miss Van Siever.\n\n\"And none was intended. But you may observe that artists in all ages\nhave sought for higher types of models in painting women who have\nbeen violent or criminal, than have sufficed for them in their\nportraitures of gentleness and virtue. Look at all the Judiths, and\nthe Lucretias, and the Charlotte Cordays; how much finer the women\nare than the Madonnas and the Saint Cecilias.\"\n\n\"After that, Clara, you need not scruple to be a Jael,\" said Mrs.\nBroughton.\n\n\"But I do scruple,--very much; so strongly that I know I never shall\ndo it. In the first place I don't know why Mr. Dalrymple wants it.\"\n\n\"Want it!\" said Conway. \"I want to paint a striking picture.\"\n\n\"But you can do that without putting me into it.\"\n\n\"No;--not this picture. And why should you object? It is the\ncommonest thing in the world for ladies to sit to artists in that\nmanner.\"\n\n\"People would know it.\"\n\n\"Nobody would know it, so that you need care about it. What would\nit matter if everybody knew it? We are not proposing anything\nimproper;--are we, Mrs. Broughton?\"\n\n\"She shall not be pressed if she does not like it,\" said Mrs.\nBroughton. \"You know I told you before Clara came in, that I was\nafraid it could not be done.\"\n\n\"And I don't like it,\" said Miss Van Siever, with some little\nhesitation in her voice.\n\n\"I don't see anything improper in it, if you mean that,\" said Mrs.\nBroughton.\n\n\"But, mamma!\"\n\n\"Well, yes; that is the difficulty, no doubt. The only question is,\nwhether your mother is not so very singular, as to make it impossible\nthat you should comply with her in everything.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that I do not comply with her in very much,\" said Miss\nVan Siever in her gentlest voice.\n\n\"Oh, Clara!\"\n\n\"You drive me to say so, as otherwise I should be a hypocrite. Of\ncourse I ought not to have said it before Mr. Dalrymple.\"\n\n\"You and Mr. Dalrymple will understand all about that, I daresay,\nbefore the picture is finished,\" said Mrs. Broughton.\n\nIt did not take much persuasion on the part of Conway Dalrymple to\nget the consent of the younger lady to be painted, or of the elder to\nallow the sitting to go on in her room. When the question of easels\nand other apparatus came to be considered Mrs. Broughton was rather\nflustered, and again declared with energy that the whole thing\nmust fall to the ground; but a few more words from the painter\nrestored her, and at last the arrangements were made. As Mrs. Dobbs\nBroughton's dear friend, Madalina Demolines had said, Mrs. Dobbs\nBroughton liked a fevered existence. \"What will Dobbs say?\" she\nexclaimed more than once. And it was decided at last that Dobbs\nshould know nothing about it as long as it could be kept from him.\n\"Of course he shall be told at last,\" said his wife. \"I wouldn't keep\nanything from the dear fellow for all the world. But if he knew it at\nfirst it would be sure to get through Musselboro to your mother.\"\n\n\"I certainly shall beg that Mr. Broughton may not be taken into\nconfidence if Mr. Musselboro is to follow,\" said Clara. \"And it must\nbe understood that I must cease to sit immediately, whatever may be\nthe inconvenience, should mamma speak to me about it.\"\n\nThis stipulation was made and conceded, and then Miss Van Siever went\naway, leaving the artist with Mrs. Dobbs Broughton. \"And now, if you\nplease, Conway, you had better go too,\" said the lady, as soon as\nthere had been time for Miss Van Siever to get downstairs and out of\nthe hall-door.\n\n\"Of course you are in a hurry to get rid of me.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"A little while ago I improperly said that some suggestion of yours\nwas nonsense and you rebuked me for my blunt incivility. Might not I\nrebuke you now with equal justice?\"\n\n\"Do so, if you will;--but leave me. I tell you, Conway, that in these\nmatters you must either be guided by me, or you and I must cease to\nsee each other. It does not do that you should remain here with me\nlonger than the time usually allowed for a morning call. Clara has\ncome and gone, and you also must go. I am sorry to disturb you, for\nyou seem to be so very comfortable in that chair.\"\n\n\"I am comfortable,--and I can look at you. Come;--there can be no\nharm in saying that, if I say nothing else. Well;--there, now I am\ngone.\" Whereupon he got up from his arm-chair.\n\n\"But you are not gone while you stand there.\"\n\n\"And you would really wish me to marry that girl?\"\n\n\"I do,--if you can love her.\"\n\n\"And what about her love?\"\n\n\"You must win it, of course. She is to be won, like any other woman.\nThe fruit won't fall into your mouth merely because you open your\nlips. You must climb the tree.\"\n\n\"Still climbing trees in the Hesperides,\" said Conway. \"Love does\nthat, you know; but it is hard to climb the trees without the love.\nIt seems to me that I have done my climbing,--have clomb as high as\nI knew how, and that the boughs are breaking with me, and that I am\nlikely to get a fall. Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"I would rather not understand you.\"\n\n\"That is no answer to my question. Do you understand that at this\nmoment I am getting a fall which will break every bone in my skin and\nput any other climbing out of the question as far as I am concerned?\nDo you understand that?\"\n\n\"No; I do not,\" said Mrs. Broughton, in a tremulous voice.\n\n\"Then I'll go and make love at once to Clara Van Siever. There's\nenough of pluck left in me to ask her to marry me, and I suppose I\ncould manage to go through the ceremony if she accepted me.\"\n\n\"But I want you to love her,\" said Mrs. Dobbs Broughton.\n\n\"I daresay I should love her well enough after a bit;--that is, if\nshe didn't break my head or comb my hair. I suppose there will be no\nobjection to my saying that you sent me when I ask her?\"\n\n\"Conway, you will of course not mention my name to her. I have\nsuggested to you a marriage which I think would tend to make you\nhappy, and would give you a stability in life which you want. It is\nperhaps better that I should be explicit at once. As an unmarried\nman I cannot continue to know you. You have said words of late which\nhave driven me to this conclusion. I have thought about it much,--too\nmuch, perhaps, and I know that I am right. Miss Van Siever has beauty\nand wealth and intellect, and I think that she would appreciate the\nlove of such a man as you are. Now go.\" And Mrs. Dobbs Broughton,\nstanding upright, pointed to the door. Conway Dalrymple slowly took\nhis Spanish hat from off the marble slab on which he had laid it, and\nleft the room without saying a word. The interview had been quite\nlong enough, and there was nothing else which he knew how to say with\neffect.\n\nCroquet is a pretty game out of doors, and chess is delightful in a\ndrawing-room. Battledoor and shuttlecock and hunt-the-slipper have\nalso their attractions. Proverbs are good, and cross questions with\ncrooked answers may be made very amusing. But none of these games are\nequal to the game of love-making,--providing that the players can\nbe quite sure that there shall be no heart in the matter. Any touch\nof heart not only destroys the pleasure of the game, but makes the\nplayer awkward and incapable and robs him of his skill. And thus it\nis that there are many people who cannot play the game at all. A\ndeficiency of some needed internal physical strength prevents the\nowners of the heart from keeping a proper control over its valves,\nand thus emotion sets in, and the pulses are accelerated, and feeling\nsupervenes. For such a one to attempt a game of love-making, is as\nthough your friend with the gout should insist on playing croquet. A\nsense of the ridiculous, if nothing else, should in either case deter\nthe afflicted one from the attempt. There was no such absurdity with\nour friend Mrs. Dobbs Broughton and Conway Dalrymple. Their valves\nand pulses were all right. They could play the game without the\nslightest danger of any inconvenient result;--of any inconvenient\nresult, that is, as regarded their own feelings. Blind people cannot\nsee and stupid people cannot understand,--and it might be that Mr.\nDobbs Broughton, being both blind and stupid in such matters, might\nperceive something of the playing of the game and not know that it\nwas only a game of skill.\n\nWhen I say that as regarded these two lovers there was nothing of\nlove between them, and that the game was therefore so far innocent, I\nwould not be understood as asserting that these people had no hearts\nwithin their bosoms. Mrs. Dobbs Broughton probably loved her husband\nin a sensible, humdrum way, feeling him to be a bore, knowing him to\nbe vulgar, aware that he often took a good deal more wine than was\ngood for him, and that he was almost as uneducated as a hog. Yet she\nloved him, and showed her love by taking care that he should have\nthings for dinner which he liked to eat. But in this alone there were\nto be found none of the charms of a fevered existence, and therefore\nMrs. Dobbs Broughton, requiring those charms for her comfort, played\nher little game with Conway Dalrymple. And as regarded the artist\nhimself, let no reader presume him to have been heartless because he\nflirted with Mrs. Dobbs Broughton. Doubtless he will marry some day,\nwill have a large family for which he will work hard, and will make a\ngood husband to some stout lady who will be careful in looking after\nhis linen. But on the present occasion he fell into some slight\ntrouble in spite of the innocence of his game. As he quitted his\nfriend's room he heard the hall-door slammed heavily; then there was\na quick step on the stairs, and on the landing-place above the first\nflight he met the master of the house, somewhat flurried, as it\nseemed, and not looking comfortable, either as regarded his person or\nhis temper. \"By George, he's been drinking!\" Conway said to himself,\nafter the first glance. Now it certainly was the case that poor Dobbs\nBroughton would sometimes drink at improper hours.\n\n\"What the devil are you doing here?\" said Dobbs Broughton to his\nfriend the artist. \"You're always here. You're here a doosed sight\nmore than I like.\" Husbands when they have been drinking are very apt\nto make mistakes as to the purport of the game.\n\n\"Why, Dobbs,\" said the painter, \"there's something wrong with you.\"\n\n\"No, there ain't. There's nothing wrong; and if there was, what's\nthat to you? I shan't ask you to pay anything for me, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Well;--I hope not.\"\n\n\"I won't have you here, and let that be an end of it. It's all very\nwell when I choose to have a few friends to dinner, but my wife can\ndo very well without your fal-lalling here all day. Will you remember\nthat, if you please?\"\n\nConway Dalrymple, knowing that he had better not argue any question\nwith a drunken man, took himself out of the house, shrugging his\nshoulders as he thought of the misery which his poor dear playfellow\nwould now be called upon to endure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nA HERO AT HOME.\n\n\nOn the morning after his visit to Miss Demolines John Eames found\nhimself at the Paddington Station asking for a ticket for Guestwick,\nand as he picked up his change another gentleman also demanded\na ticket for the same place. Had Guestwick been as Liverpool or\nManchester, Eames would have thought nothing about it. It is a matter\nof course that men should always be going from London to Liverpool\nand Manchester; but it seemed odd to him that two men should want\nfirst-class tickets for so small a place as Guestwick at the same\nmoment. And when, afterwards, he was placed by the guard in the\nsame carriage with this other traveller, he could not but feel\nsome little curiosity. The man was four or five years Johnny's\nsenior, a good-looking fellow, with a pleasant face, and the outward\nappurtenances of a gentleman. The intelligent reader will no doubt\nbe aware that the stranger was Major Grantly; but the intelligent\nreader has in this respect had much advantage over John Eames, who\nup to this time had never even heard of his cousin Grace Crawley's\nlover. \"I think you were asking for a ticket for Guestwick,\" said\nJohnny;--whereupon the major owned that such was the case. \"I lived\nat Guestwick the greater part of my life,\" said Johnny, \"and it's\nthe dullest, dearest little town in all England.\" \"I never was\nthere before,\" said the major, \"and indeed I can hardly say I am\ngoing there now. I shall only pass through it.\" Then he got out his\nnewspaper, and Johnny also got out his, and for a time there was no\nconversation between them. John remembered how holy was the errand\nupon which he was intent, and gathered his thoughts together,\nresolving that having so great a matter on his mind he would think\nabout nothing else and speak about nothing at all. He was going\ndown to Allington to ask Lily Dale for the last time whether she\nwould be his wife; to ascertain whether he was to be successful or\nunsuccessful in the one great wish of his life; and, as such was\nthe case with him,--as he had in hand a thing so vital, it could\nbe nothing to him whether the chance companion of his voyage was\nan agreeable or a disagreeable person. He himself, in any of the\nordinary circumstances of life, was prone enough to talk with any\none he might meet. He could have travelled for twelve hours together\nwith an old lady, and could listen to her or make her listen to him\nwithout half an hour's interruption. But this journey was made on no\nordinary occasion, and it behoved him to think of Lily. Therefore,\nafter the first little almost necessary effort at civility, he fell\nback into gloomy silence. He was going to do his best to win Lily\nDale, and this doing of his best would require all his thought and\nall his energy.\n\nAnd probably Major Grantly's mind was bent in the same direction. He,\ntoo, had this work before him, and could not look upon his work as a\nthing that was altogether pleasant. He might probably get that which\nhe was intent upon obtaining. He knew,--he almost knew,--that he had\nwon the heart of the girl whom he was seeking. There had been that\nbetween him and her which justified him in supposing that he was dear\nto her, although no expression of affection had ever passed from her\nlips to his ears. Men may know all that they require to know on that\nsubject without any plainly spoken words. Grace Crawley had spoken\nno word, and yet he had known,--at any rate had not doubted, that\nhe could have the place in her heart of which he desired to be the\nmaster. She would never surrender herself altogether till she had\ntaught herself to be sure of him to whom she gave herself. But she\nhad listened to him with silence that had not rebuked him, and he had\ntold himself that he might venture, without fear of that rebuke as\nto which the minds of some men are sensitive to a degree which other\nmen cannot even understand. But for all this Major Grantly could not\nbe altogether happy as to his mission. He would ask Grace Crawley\nto be his wife; but he would be ruined by his own success. And the\nremembrance that he would be severed from all his own family by the\nthing that he was doing, was very bitter to him. In generosity he\nmight be silent about this to Grace, but who can endure to be silent\non such a subject to the woman who is to be his wife? And then it\nwould not be possible for him to abstain from explanation. He was now\nfollowing her down to Allington, a step which he certainly would not\nhave taken but for the misfortune which had befallen her father, and\nhe must explain to her in some sort why he did so. He must say to\nher,--if not in so many words, still almost as plainly as words could\nspeak,--I am here now to ask you to be my wife, because you specially\nrequire the protection and countenance of the man who loves you, in\nthe present circumstances of your father's affairs. He knew that he\nwas doing right;--perhaps had some idea that he was doing nobly; but\nthis very appreciation of his own good qualities made the task before\nhim the more difficult.\n\nMajor Grantly had The Times, and John Eames had the Daily News, and\nthey exchanged papers. One had the last Saturday, and the other the\nlast Spectator, and they exchanged those also. Both had the Pall Mall\nGazette, of which enterprising periodical they gradually came to\ndiscuss the merits and demerits, thus falling into conversation at\nlast, in spite of the weight of the mission on which each of them was\nintent. Then, at last, when they were within half-an-hour of the end\nof their journey, Major Grantly asked his companion what was the best\ninn at Guestwick. He had at first been minded to go on to Allington\nat once,--to go on to Allington and get his work done, and then\nreturn home or remain there, or find the nearest inn with a decent\nbed, as circumstances might direct him. But on reconsideration, as he\ndrew nearer to the scene of his future operations, he thought that\nit might be well for him to remain that night at Guestwick. He did\nnot quite know how far Allington was from Guestwick, but he did know\nthat it was still mid-winter, and that the days were very short. \"The\nMagpie\" was the best inn, Johnny said. Having lived at Guestwick all\nhis life, and having a mother living there now, he had never himself\nput up at \"The Magpie,\" but he believed it to be a good country inn.\nThey kept post-horses there, he knew. He did not tell the stranger\nthat his late old friend, Lord De Guest, and his present old friend,\nLady Julia, always hired post-horses from \"The Magpie,\" but he\ngrounded his ready assertion on the remembrance of that fact. \"I\nthink I shall stay there to-night,\" said the major. \"You'll find it\npretty comfortable, I don't doubt,\" said Johnny. \"Though, indeed, it\nalways seems to me that a man alone at an inn has a very bad time of\nit. Reading is all very well, but one gets tired of it at last. And\nthen I hate horse-hair chairs.\" \"It isn't very delightful,\" said the\nmajor, \"but beggars mustn't be choosers.\" Then there was a pause,\nafter which the major spoke again. \"You don't happen to know which\nway Allington lies?\"\n\n\"Allington!\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Yes, Allington. Is there not a village called Allington?\"\n\n\"There is a village called Allington, certainly. It lies over there.\"\nAnd Johnny pointed with his finger through the window. \"As you do not\nknow the country you can see nothing, but I can see the Allington\ntrees at this moment.\"\n\n\"I suppose there is no inn at Allington?\"\n\n\"There's a public-house, with a very nice clean bedroom. It is\ncalled the 'Red Lion.' Mrs. Forrard keeps it. I would quite as soon\nstay there as at 'The Magpie.' Only if they don't expect you, they\nwouldn't have much for dinner.\"\n\n\"Then you know the village of Allington?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know the village of Allington very well. I have friends\nliving there. Indeed, I may say I know everybody in Allington.\"\n\n\"Do you know Mrs. Dale?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Dale?\" said Johnny. \"Yes, I know Mrs. Dale. I have known Mrs.\nDale pretty nearly all my life.\" Who could this man be who was going\ndown to see Mrs. Dale,--Mrs. Dale, and consequently, Lily Dale?\nHe thought that he knew Mrs. Dale so well, that she could have no\nvisitor of whom he would not be entitled to have some knowledge. But\nMajor Grantly had nothing more to say at the moment about Mrs. Dale.\nHe had never seen Mrs. Dale in his life, and was now going to her\nhouse, not to see her, but a friend of hers. He found that he could\nnot very well explain this to a stranger, and therefore at the moment\nhe said nothing further. But Johnny would not allow the subject to be\ndropped. \"Have you known Mrs. Dale long?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have not the pleasure of knowing her at all,\" said the major.\n\n\"I thought, perhaps, by your asking after her--\"\n\n\"I intend to call upon her, that is all. I suppose they will have\nan omnibus here from 'The Magpie?'\" Eames said that there no doubt\nwould be an omnibus from \"The Magpie,\" and then they were at their\njourney's end.\n\nFor the present we will follow John Eames, who went at once to his\nmother's house. It was his intention to remain there for two or three\ndays, and then go over to the house, or rather to the cottage, of\nhis great ally Lady Julia, which lay just beyond Guestwick Manor,\nand somewhat nearer to Allington than to the town of Guestwick. He\nhad made up his mind that he would not himself go over to Allington\ntill he could do so from Guestwick Cottage, as it was called,\nfeeling that, under certain untoward circumstances,--should untoward\ncircumstances arise,--Lady Julia's sympathy might be more endurable\nthan that of his mother. But he would take care that it should be\nknown at Allington that he was in the neighbourhood. He understood\nthe necessary strategy of his campaign too well to suppose that he\ncould startle Lily into acquiescence.\n\nWith his own mother and sister, John Eames was in these days quite a\nhero. He was a hero with them now, because in his early boyish days\nthere had been so little about him that was heroic. Then there had\nbeen a doubt whether he would ever earn his daily bread, and he had\nbeen a very heavy burden on the slight family resources in the matter\nof jackets and trousers. The pride taken in our Johnny had not been\ngreat, though the love felt for him had been warm. But gradually\nthings had changed, and John Eames had become heroic in his mother's\neyes. A chance circumstance had endeared him to Earl De Guest, and\nfrom that moment things had gone well with him. The earl had given\nhim a watch and had left him a fortune, and Sir Raffle Buffle had\nmade him a private secretary. In the old days, when Johnny's love\nfor Lily Dale was first discussed by his mother and sister, they had\nthought it impossible that Lily should ever bring herself to regard\nwith affection so humble a suitor;--for the Dales have ever held\ntheir heads up in the world. But now there is no misgiving on that\nscore with Mrs. Eames and her daughter. Their wonder is that Lily\nDale should be such a fool as to decline the love of such a man. So\nJohnny was received with the respect due to a hero, as well as with\nthe affection belonging to a son;--by which I mean it to be inferred\nthat Mrs. Eames had got a little bit of fish for dinner as well as a\nleg of mutton.\n\n\"A man came down in the train with me who says he is going over to\nAllington,\" said Johnny. \"I wonder who he can be. He is staying at\n'The Magpie.'\"\n\n\"A friend of Captain Dale's, probably,\" said Mary. Captain Dale was\nthe squire's nephew and his heir.\n\n\"But this man was not going to the squire's. He was going to the\nSmall House.\"\n\n\"Is he going to stay there?\"\n\n\"I suppose not, as he asked about the inn.\" Then Johnny reflected\nthat the man might probably be a friend of Crosbie's, and became\nmelancholy in consequence. Crosbie might have thought it expedient\nto send an ambassador down to prepare the ground for him before he\nshould venture again upon the scene himself. If it were so, would it\nnot be well that he, John Eames, should get over to Lily as soon as\npossible, and not wait till he should be staying with Lady Julia?\n\nIt was at any rate incumbent upon him to call upon Lady Julia the\nnext morning, because of his commission. The Berlin wool might remain\nin his portmanteau till his portmanteau should go with him to the\ncottage; but he would take the spectacles at once, and he must\nexplain to Lady Julia what the lawyers had told him about the income.\nSo he hired a saddle-horse from \"The Magpie\" and started after\nbreakfast on the morning after his arrival. In his unheroic days he\nwould have walked,--as he had done, scores of times, over the whole\ndistance from Guestwick to Allington. But now, in these grander days,\nhe thought about his boots and the mud, and the formal appearance of\nthe thing. \"Ah dear,\" he said, to himself, as the nag walked slowly\nout of the town, \"it used to be better with me in the old days. I\nhardly hoped that she would ever accept me, but at least she had\nnever refused me. And then that brute had not as yet made his way\ndown to Allington!\"\n\nHe did not go very fast. After leaving the town he trotted on for a\nmile or so. But when he got to the palings of Guestwick Manor he let\nthe animal walk again, and his mind ran back over the incidents of\nhis life which were connected with the place. He remembered a certain\nlong ramble which he had taken in those woods after Lily had refused\nhim. That had been subsequent to the Crosbie episode in his life, and\nJohnny had been led to hope by certain of his friends,--especially\nby Lord De Guest and his sister,--that he might then be successful.\nBut he had been unsuccessful, and had passed the bitterest hour of\nhis life wandering about in those woods. Since that he had been\nunsuccessful again and again; but the bitterness of failure had not\nbeen so strong with him as on that first occasion. He would try\nagain now, and if he failed, he would fail for the last time. As he\nwas thinking of all this, a gig overtook him on the road, and on\nlooking round he saw that the occupant of the gig was the man who had\ntravelled with him on the previous day in the train. Major Grantly\nwas alone in the gig, and as he recognized John Eames he stopped his\nhorse. \"Are you also going to Allington?\" he asked. John Eames, with\nsomething of scorn in his voice, replied that he had no intention of\ngoing to Allington on that day. He still thought that this man might\nbe an emissary from Crosbie, and therefore resolved that but scant\ncourtesy was due to him. \"I am on my way there now,\" said Grantly,\n\"and am going to the house of your friend. May I tell her that I\ntravelled with you yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Johnny. \"You may tell her that you came down with\nJohn Eames.\"\n\n\"And are you John Eames?\" asked the major.\n\n\"If you have no objection,\" said Johnny. \"But I can hardly suppose\nyou have ever heard my name before?\"\n\n\"It is familiar to me, because I have the pleasure of knowing a\ncousin of yours, Miss Grace Crawley.\"\n\n\"My cousin is at present staying at Allington with Mrs. Dale,\" said\nJohnny.\n\n\"Just so,\" said the major, who now began to reflect that he had been\nindiscreet in mentioning Grace Crawley's name. No doubt every one\nconnected with the family, all the Crawleys, all the Dales, and all\nthe Eameses, would soon know the business which had brought him down\nto Allington; but he need not have taken the trouble of beginning the\nstory against himself. John Eames, in truth, had never even heard\nMajor Grantly's name, and was quite unaware of the fortune which\nawaited his cousin. Even after what he had now been told, he still\nsuspected the stranger of being an emissary from his enemy; but the\nmajor, not giving him credit for his ignorance, was annoyed with\nhimself for having told so much of his own history. \"I will tell the\nladies that I had the pleasure of meeting you,\" he said; \"that is, if\nI am lucky enough to see them.\" And then he drove on.\n\n\"I know I should hate that fellow if I were to meet him anywhere\nagain,\" said Johnny to himself as he rode on. \"When I take an\naversion to a fellow at first sight, I always stick to it. It's\ninstinct, I suppose.\" And he was still giving himself credit for\nthe strength of his instincts when he reached Lady Julia's cottage.\nHe rode at once into the stable-yard, with the privilege of an\naccustomed friend of the house, and having given up his horse,\nentered the cottage by the back door. \"Is my lady at home, Jemima?\"\nhe said to the maid.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. John; she is in the drawing-room, and friends of yours are\nwith her.\" Then he was announced, and found himself in the presence\nof Lady Julia, Lily Dale, and Grace Crawley.\n\nHe was very warmly received. Lady Julia really loved him dearly, and\nwould have done anything in her power to bring about a match between\nhim and Lily. Grace was his cousin, and though she had not seen him\noften, she was prepared to love him dearly as Lily's lover. And\nLily,--Lily loved him dearly too,--if only she could have brought\nherself to love him as he wished to be loved! To all of them Johnny\nEames was something of a hero. At any rate in the eyes of all of them\nhe possessed those virtues which seemed to them to justify them in\npetting him and making much of him.\n\n\"I am so glad you've come,--that is, if you've brought my\nspectacles,\" said Lady Julia.\n\n\"My pockets are crammed with spectacles,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"And when are you coming to me?\"\n\n\"I was thinking of Tuesday.\"\n\n\"No; don't come till Wednesday. But I mean Monday. No; Monday won't\ndo. Come on Tuesday,--early, and drive me out. And now tell us the\nnews.\"\n\nJohnny swore that there was no news. He made a brave attempt to\nbe gay and easy before Lily; but he failed, and he knew that he\nfailed,--and he knew that she knew that he failed. \"Mamma will be so\nglad to see you,\" said Lily. \"I suppose you haven't seen Bell yet?\"\n\n\"I only got to Guestwick yesterday afternoon,\" said he.\n\n\"And it will be so nice our having Grace at the Small House;--won't\nit? Uncle Christopher has quite taken a passion for Grace,--so that I\nam hardly anybody now in the Allington world.\"\n\n\"By-the-by,\" said Johnny, \"I came down here with a friend of yours,\nGrace.\"\n\n\"A friend of mine?\" said Grace.\n\n\"So he says, and he is at Allington at this moment. He passed me in a\ngig going there.\"\n\n\"And what was his name?\" Lily asked.\n\n\"I have not the remotest idea,\" said Johnny. \"He is a man about my\nown age, very good-looking, and apparently very well able to take\ncare of himself. He is short-sighted, and holds a glass in one eye\nwhen he looks out of a carriage-window. That's all that I know about\nhim.\"\n\nGrace Crawley's face had become suffused with blushes at the first\nmention of the friend and the gig; but then Grace blushed very\neasily. Lily knew all about it at once;--at once divined who must\nbe the friend in the gig, and was almost beside herself with joy.\nLady Julia, who had heard no more of the major than had Johnny, was\nstill clever enough to perceive that the friend must be a particular\nfriend,--for she had noticed Miss Crawley's blushes. And Grace\nherself had no doubt as to the man. The picture of her lover, with\nthe glass in his eye as he looked out of the window, had been too\nperfect to admit of a doubt. In her distress she put out her hand and\ntook hold of Lily's dress.\n\n\"And you say he is at Allington now?\" said Lily.\n\n\"I have no doubt he is at the Small House at this moment,\" said\nJohnny.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nSHOWING HOW MAJOR GRANTLY TOOK A WALK.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMajor Grantly drove his gig into the yard of the \"Red Lion\" at\nAllington, and from thence walked away at once to Mrs. Dale's house.\nWhen he reached the village he had hardly made up his mind as to the\nway in which he would begin his attack; but now, as he went down\nthe street, he resolved that he would first ask for Mrs. Dale. Most\nprobably he would find himself in the presence of Mrs. Dale and her\ndaughter, and of Grace also, at his first entrance; and if so, his\nposition would be awkward enough. He almost regretted now that he had\nnot written to Mrs. Dale, and asked for an interview. His task would\nbe very difficult if he should find all the ladies together. But he\nwas strong in the feeling that when his purpose was told it would\nmeet the approval at any rate of Mrs. Dale; and he walked boldly\non, and bravely knocked at the door of the Small House, as he had\nalready learned that Mrs. Dale's residence was called by all the\nneighbourhood. Nobody was at home, the servant said; and then, when\nthe visitor began to make further inquiry, the girl explained that\nthe two young ladies had walked as far as Guestwick Cottage, and that\nMrs. Dale was at this moment at the Great House with the squire. She\nhad gone across soon after the young ladies had started. The maid,\nhowever, was interrupted before she had finished telling all this to\nthe major, by finding her mistress behind her in the passage. Mrs.\nDale had returned, and had entered the house from the lawn.\n\n\"I am here now, Jane,\" said Mrs. Dale, \"if the gentleman wishes to\nsee me.\"\n\nThen the major announced himself. \"My name is Major Grantly,\" said\nhe; and he was blundering on with some words about his own intrusion,\nwhen Mrs. Dale begged him to follow her into the drawing-room. He had\nmuttered something to the effect that Mrs. Dale would not know who\nhe was; but Mrs. Dale knew all about him, and had heard the whole\nof Grace's story from Lily. She and Lily had often discussed the\nquestion whether, under existing circumstances, Major Grantly should\nfeel himself bound to offer his hand to Grace, and the mother and\ndaughter had differed somewhat on the matter. Mrs. Dale had held that\nhe was not so bound, urging that the unfortunate position in which\nMr. Crawley was placed was so calamitous to all connected with him,\nas to justify any man, not absolutely engaged, in abandoning the\nthoughts of such a marriage. Mrs. Dale had spoken of Major Grantly's\nfather and mother and brother and sister, and had declared her\nopinion that they were entitled to consideration. But Lily had\nopposed this idea very stoutly, asserting that in an affair of love\na man should think neither of father or brother or mother or sister.\n\"If he is worth anything,\" Lily had said, \"he will come to her\nnow,--now in her trouble; and will tell her that she at least has got\na friend who will be true to her. If he does that, then I shall think\nthat there is something of the poetry and nobleness of love left.\"\nIn answer to this Mrs. Dale had replied that women had no right to\nexpect from men such self-denying nobility as that. \"I don't expect\nit, mamma,\" said Lily. \"And I am sure that Grace does not. Indeed I\nam quite sure that Grace does not expect even to see him ever again.\nShe never says so, but I know that she has made up her mind about\nit. Still I think he ought to come.\" \"It can hardly be that a man is\nbound to do a thing, the doing of which, as you confess, would be\nalmost more than noble,\" said Mrs. Dale. And so the matter had been\ndiscussed between them. But now, as it seemed to Mrs. Dale, the man\nhad come to do this noble thing. At any rate he was there in her\ndrawing-room, and before either of them had sat down he had contrived\nto mention Grace. \"You may not probably have heard my name,\" he said,\n\"but I am acquainted with your friend, Miss Crawley.\"\n\n\"I know your name very well, Major Grantly. My brother-in-law who\nlives over yonder, Mr. Dale, knows your father very well,--or he did\nsome years ago. And I have heard him say that he remembers you.\"\n\n\"I recollect. He used to be staying at Ullathorne. But that is a long\ntime ago. Is he at home now?\"\n\n\"Mr. Dale is almost always at home. He very rarely goes away, and I\nam sure would be glad to see you.\"\n\nThen there was a little pause in the conversation. They had managed\nto seat themselves, and Mrs. Dale had said enough to put her visitor\nfairly at his ease. If he had anything special to say to her, he must\nsay it,--any request or proposition to make as to Grace Crawley, he\nmust make it. And he did make it at once. \"My object in coming to\nAllington,\" he said, \"was to see Miss Crawley.\"\n\n\"She and my daughter have taken a long walk to call on a friend, and\nI am afraid they will stay for lunch; but they will certainly be home\nbetween three and four, if that is not too long for you to remain at\nAllington.\"\n\n\"O dear, no,\" said he. \"It will not hurt me to wait.\"\n\n\"It certainly will not hurt me, Major Grantly. Perhaps you will lunch\nwith me?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Mrs. Dale; if you'll permit me, I'll explain\nto you why I have come here. Indeed, I have intended to do so all\nthrough, and I can only ask you to keep my secret, if after all it\nshould require to be kept.\"\n\n\"I will certainly keep any secret that you may ask me to keep,\" said\nMrs. Dale, taking off her bonnet.\n\n\"I hope there may be no need of one,\" said Major Grantly. \"The truth\nis, Mrs. Dale, that I have known Miss Crawley for some time,--nearly\nfor two years now, and--I may as well speak it out at once,--I have\nmade up my mind to ask her to be my wife. That is why I am here.\"\nConsidering the nature of the statement, which must have been\nembarrassing, I think that it was made with fluency and simplicity.\n\n\"Of course, Major Grantly, you know that I have no authority with our\nyoung friend,\" said Mrs. Dale. \"I mean that she is not connected with\nus by family ties. She has a father and mother, living, as I believe,\nin the same county with yourself.\"\n\n\"I know that, Mrs. Dale.\"\n\n\"And you may, perhaps, understand that, as Miss Crawley is now\nstaying with me, I owe it in a measure to her friends to ask you\nwhether they are aware of your intention.\"\n\n\"They are not aware of it.\"\n\n\"I know that at the present moment they are in great trouble.\"\n\nMrs. Dale was going on, but she was interrupted by Major Grantly.\n\"That is just it,\" he said. \"There are circumstances at present which\nmake it almost impossible that I should go to Mr. Crawley and ask his\npermission to address his daughter. I do not know whether you have\nheard the whole story?\"\n\n\"As much, I believe, as Grace could tell me.\"\n\n\"He is, I believe, in such a state of mental distress as to be hardly\ncapable of giving me a considerate answer. And I should not know how\nto speak to him, or how not to speak to him, about this unfortunate\naffair. But, Mrs. Dale, you will, I think, perceive that the same\ncircumstances make it imperative upon me to be explicit to Miss\nCrawley. I think I am the last man to boast of a woman's regard, but\nI had learned to think that I was not indifferent to Grace. If that\nbe so, what must she think of me if I stay away from her now?\"\n\n\"She understands too well the weight of the misfortune which has\nfallen upon her father, to suppose that any one not connected with\nher can be bound to share it.\"\n\n\"That is just it. She will think that I am silent for that reason. I\nhave determined that that shall not keep me silent, and, therefore,\nI have come here. I may, perhaps, be able to bring comfort to her in\nher trouble. As regards my worldly position,--though, indeed, it will\nnot be very good,--as hers is not good either, you will not think\nyourself bound to forbid me to see her on that head.\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I need hardly say that I fully understand that,\nas regards money, you are offering everything where you can get\nnothing.\"\n\n\"And you understand my feeling?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I do,--and appreciate the great nobility of your love for\nGrace. You shall see her here, if you wish it,--and to-day, if you\nchoose to wait.\" Major Grantly said that he would wait and would see\nGrace on that afternoon. Mrs. Dale again suggested that he should\nlunch with her, but this he declined. She then proposed that he\nshould go across and call upon the squire, and thus consume his time.\nBut to this he also objected. He was not exactly in the humour, he\nsaid, to renew so old and so slight an acquaintance at that time. Mr.\nDale would probably have forgotten him, and would be sure to ask what\nhad brought him to Allington. He would go and take a walk, he said,\nand come again exactly at half-past three. Mrs. Dale again expressed\nher certainty that the young ladies would be back by that time, and\nMajor Grantly left the house.\n\nMrs. Dale when she was left alone could not but compare the good\nfortune which was awaiting Grace, with the evil fortune which had\nfallen on her own child. Here was a man who was at all points a\ngentleman. Such, at least, was the character which Mrs. Dale at once\nconceded to him. And Grace had chanced to come across this man, and\nto please his eye, and satisfy his taste, and be loved by him. And\nthe result of that chance would be that Grace would have everything\ngiven to her that the world has to give worth acceptance. She would\nhave a companion for her life whom she could trust, admire, love, and\nof whom she could be infinitely proud. Mrs. Dale was not at all aware\nwhether Major Grantly might have five hundred a year to spend, or\nfive thousand,--or what sum intermediate between the two,--nor did\nshe give much of her thoughts at the moment to that side of the\nsubject. She knew without thinking of it,--or fancied that she knew,\nthat there were means sufficient for comfortable living. It was\nsolely the nature and character of the man that was in her mind, and\nthe sufficiency that was to be found in them for a wife's happiness.\nBut her daughter, her Lily, had come across a man who was a\nscoundrel, and, as the consequence of that meeting, all her life was\nmarred! Could any credit be given to Grace for her success, or any\nblame attached to Lily for her failure? Surely not the latter! How\nwas her girl to have guarded herself from a love so unfortunate, or\nhave avoided the rock on which her vessel had been shipwrecked? Then\nmany bitter thoughts passed through Mrs. Dale's mind, and she almost\nenvied Grace Crawley her lover. Lily was contented to remain as she\nwas, but Lily's mother could not bring herself to be satisfied that\nher child should fill a lower place in the world than other girls. It\nhad ever been her idea,--an idea probably never absolutely uttered\neven to herself, but not the less practically conceived,--that it is\nthe business of a woman to be married. That her Lily should have been\nwon and not worn, had been, and would be, a trouble to her for ever.\n\nMajor Grantly went back to the inn and saw his horse fed, and smoked\na cigar, and then, finding that it was still only just one o'clock,\nhe started for a walk. He was careful not to go out of Allington by\nthe road he had entered it, as he had no wish to encounter Grace and\nher friend on their return into the village; so he crossed a little\nbrook which runs at the bottom of the hill on which the chief street\nof Allington is built, and turned into a field-path to the left as\nsoon as he had got beyond the houses. Not knowing the geography of\nthe place he did not understand that by taking that path he was\nmaking his way back to the squire's house; but it was so; and after\nsauntering on for about a mile and crossing back again over the\nstream, of which he took no notice, he found himself leaning across a\ngate, and looking into a paddock on the other side of which was the\nhigh wall of a gentleman's garden. To avoid this he went on a little\nfurther and found himself on a farm road, and before he could retrace\nhis steps so as not to be seen, he met a gentleman whom he presumed\nto be the owner of the house. It was the squire surveying his home\nfarm, as was his daily custom; but Major Grantly had not perceived\nthat the house must of necessity be Allington House, having been\naware that he had passed the entrance to the place, as he entered\nthe village on the other side. \"I'm afraid I'm intruding,\" he said,\nlifting his hat. \"I came up the path yonder, not knowing that it\nwould lead me so close to a gentleman's house.\"\n\n\"There is a right of way through the fields on to the Guestwick\nroad,\" said the squire, \"and therefore you are not trespassing in any\nsense; but we are not particular about such things down here, and you\nwould be very welcome if there were no right of way. If you are a\nstranger, perhaps you would like to see the outside of the old house.\nPeople think it picturesque.\"\n\nThen Major Grantly became aware that this must be the squire, and\nhe was annoyed with himself for his own awkwardness in having thus\ncome upon the house. He would have wished to keep himself altogether\nunseen if it had been possible,--and especially unseen by this old\ngentleman, to whom, now that he had met him, he was almost bound to\nintroduce himself. But he was not absolutely bound to do so, and he\ndetermined that he would still keep his peace. Even if the squire\nshould afterwards hear of his having been there, what would it\nmatter? But to proclaim himself at the present moment would be\ndisagreeable to him. He permitted the squire, however, to lead him\nto the front of the house, and in a few moments was standing on the\nterrace hearing an account of the architecture of the mansion.\n\n[Illustration: Squire Dale and Major Grantly.]\n\n\"You can see the date still in the brickwork of one of the\nchimneys,--that is, if your eyes are very good you can see it,--1617.\nIt was completed in that year, and very little has been done to it\nsince. We think the chimneys are pretty.\"\n\n\"They are very pretty,\" said the major. \"Indeed, the house altogether\nis as graceful as it can be.\"\n\n\"Those trees are old, too,\" said the squire, pointing to two cedars\nwhich stood at the side of the house. \"They say they are older than\nthe house, but I don't feel sure of it. There was a mansion here\nbefore, very nearly, though not quite, on the same spot.\"\n\n\"Your own ancestors were living here before that, I suppose?\" said\nGrantly, meaning to be civil.\n\n\"Well, yes; two or three hundred years before it, I suppose. If you\ndon't mind coming down to the churchyard, you'll get an excellent\nview of the house;--by far the best that there is. By-the-by, would\nyou like to step in and take a glass of wine?\"\n\n\"I'm very much obliged,\" said the major, \"but indeed I'd rather not.\"\nThen he followed the squire down to the churchyard, and was shown the\nchurch as well as the view of the house, and the vicarage, and a view\nover to Allington woods from the vicarage gate, of which the squire\nwas very fond, and in this way he was taken back on to the Guestwick\nside of the village, and even down on to the road by which he had\nentered it, without in the least knowing where he was. He looked at\nhis watch and saw that it was past two. \"I'm very much obliged to\nyou, sir,\" he said, again taking off his hat to the squire, \"and if\nI shall not be intruding I'll make my way back to the village.\"\n\n\"What village?\" said the squire.\n\n\"To Allington,\" said Grantly.\n\n\"This is Allington,\" said the squire; and as he spoke, Lily Dale and\nGrace Crawley turned a corner from the Guestwick road and came close\nupon them. \"Well, girls, I did not expect to see you,\" said the\nsquire; \"your mamma told me you wouldn't be back till it was nearly\ndark, Lily.\"\n\n\"We have come back earlier than we intended,\" said Lily. She of\ncourse had seen the stranger with her uncle, and knowing the ways of\nthe squire in such matters had expected to be introduced to him. But\nthe reader will be aware that no introduction was possible. It never\noccurred to Lily that this man could be the Major Grantly of whom she\nand Grace had been talking during the whole length of the walk home.\nBut Grace and her lover had of course known each other at once, and\nGrantly, though he was abashed and almost dismayed by the meeting, of\ncourse came forward and gave his hand to his friend. Grace in taking\nit did not utter a word.\n\n\"Perhaps I ought to have introduced myself to you as Major Grantly?\"\nsaid he, turning to the squire.\n\n\"Major Grantly! Dear me! I had no idea that you were expected in\nthese parts.\"\n\n\"I have come without being expected.\"\n\n\"You are very welcome, I'm sure. I hope your father is well? I used\nto know him some years ago, and I daresay he has not forgotten me.\"\nThen, while the girls stood by in silence, and while Grantly was\nendeavouring to escape, the squire invited him very warmly to send\nhis portmanteau up to the house. \"We'll have the ladies up from the\nhouse below, and make it as little dull for you as possible.\" But\nthis would not have suited Grantly,--at any rate would not suit him\ntill he should know what answer he was to have. He excused himself\ntherefore, pleading a positive necessity to be at Guestwick that\nevening, and then, explaining that he had already seen Mrs. Dale, he\nexpressed his intention of going back to the Small House in company\nwith the ladies, if they would allow him. The squire, who did not as\nyet quite understand it all, bade him a formal adieu, and Lily led\nthe way home down behind the churchyard wall and through the bottom\nof the gardens belonging to the Great House. She of course knew now\nwho the stranger was, and did all in her power to relieve Grace of\nher embarrassment. Grace had hitherto not spoken a single word since\nshe had seen her lover, nor did she say a word to him in their walk\nto the house. And, in truth, he was not much more communicative than\nGrace. Lily did all the talking, and with wonderful female skill\ncontrived to have some words ready for use till they all found\nthemselves together in Mrs. Dale's drawing-room. \"I have caught a\nmajor, mamma, and landed him,\" said Lily laughing, \"but I'm afraid,\nfrom what I hear, that you had caught him first.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nMISS LILY DALE'S LOGIC.\n\n\nLady Julia De Guest always lunched at one exactly, and it was not\nmuch past twelve when John Eames made his appearance at the cottage.\nHe was of course told to stay, and of course said that he would stay.\nIt had been his purpose to lunch with Lady Julia; but then he had\nnot expected to find Lily Dale at the cottage. Lily herself would\nhave been quite at her ease, protected by Lady Julia, and somewhat\nprotected also by her own powers of fence, had it not been that Grace\nwas there also. But Grace Crawley, from the moment that she had heard\nthe description of the gentleman who looked out of the window with\nhis glass in his eye, had by no means been at her ease. Lily saw at\nonce that she could not be brought to join in any conversation, and\nboth John and Lady Julia, in their ignorance of the matter in hand,\nmade matters worse.\n\n\"So that was Major Grantly?\" said John. \"I have heard of him before,\nI think. He is a son of the old archdeacon, is he not?\"\n\n\"I don't know about old archdeacon,\" said Lady Julia. \"The archdeacon\nis the son of the old bishop, whom I remember very well. And it is\nnot so very long since the bishop died, either.\"\n\n\"I wonder what he's doing at Allington?\" said Johnny.\n\n\"I think he knows my uncle,\" said Lily.\n\n\"But he's going to call on your mother,\" he said. Then Johnny\nremembered that the major had said something as to knowing Miss\nCrawley, and for the moment he was silent.\n\n\"I remember when they talked of making the son a bishop also,\" said\nLady Julia.\n\n\"What;--this same man who is now a major?\" said Johnny.\n\n\"No, you goose. He is not the son; he is the grandson. They were\ngoing to make the archdeacon a bishop, and I remember hearing that\nhe was terribly disappointed. He is getting to be an old man now,\nI suppose; and yet, dear me, how well I remember his father.\"\n\n\"He didn't look like a bishop's son,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"How does a bishop's son look?\" Lily asked.\n\n\"I suppose he ought to have some sort of clerical tinge about him;\nbut this fellow had nothing of that kind.\"\n\n\"But then this fellow, as you call him,\" said Lily, \"is only the son\nof an archdeacon.\"\n\n\"That accounts for it, I suppose,\" said Johnny.\n\nBut during all this time Grace did not say a word, and Lily perceived\nit. Then she bethought herself as to what she had better do. Grace,\nshe knew, could not be comfortable where she was. Nor, indeed, was\nit probable that Grace would be very comfortable in returning home.\nThere could not be much ease for Grace till the coming meeting\nbetween her and Major Grantly should be over. But it would be better\nthat Grace should go back to Allington at once; and better also,\nperhaps, for Major Grantly that it should be so. \"Lady Julia,\" she\nsaid, \"I don't think we'll mind stopping for lunch to-day.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear; you promised.\"\n\n\"I think we must break our promise; I do indeed. You mustn't be\nangry with us.\" And Lily looked at Lady Julia, as though there were\nsomething which Lady Julia ought to understand, which she, Lily,\ncould not quite explain. I fear that Lily was false, and intended her\nold friend to believe that she was running away because John Eames\nhad come there.\n\n\"But you will be famished,\" said Lady Julia.\n\n\"We shall live through it,\" said Lily.\n\n\"It is out of the question that I should let you walk all the way\nhere from Allington and all the way back without taking something.\"\n\n\"We shall just be home in time for lunch if we go now,\" said Lily.\n\"Will not that be best, Grace?\"\n\nGrace hardly knew what would be best. She only knew that Major\nGrantly was at Allington, and that he had come thither to see her.\nThe idea of hurrying back after him was unpleasant to her, and yet\nshe was so flurried that she felt thankful to Lily for taking her\naway from the cottage. The matter was compromised at last. They\nremained for half an hour, and ate some biscuits and pretended to\ndrink a glass of wine, and then they started. John Eames, who in\ntruth believed that Lily Dale was running away from him, was by\nno means well pleased, and when the girls were gone, did not make\nhimself so agreeable to his old friend as he should have done. \"What\na fool I am to come here at all,\" he said, throwing himself into an\narm-chair as soon as the front door was closed.\n\n\"That's very civil to me, John!\"\n\n\"You know what I mean, Lady Julia. I am a fool to come near her,\nuntil I can do so without thinking more of her than I do of any other\ngirl in the county.\"\n\n\"I don't think you have anything to complain of as yet,\" said Lady\nJulia, who had in some sort perceived that Lily's retreat had been on\nGrace's account, and not on her own. \"It seems to me that Lily was\nvery glad to see you, and when I told her that you were coming to\nstay here, and would be near them for some days, she seemed to be\nquite pleased;--she did indeed.\"\n\n\"Then why did she run away the moment I came in?\" said Johnny.\n\n\"I think it was something you said about that man who has gone to\nAllington.\"\n\n\"What difference can the man make to her? The truth is, I despise\nmyself;--I do indeed, Lady Julia. Only think of my meeting Crosbie at\ndinner the other day, and his having the impertinence to come up and\nshake hands with me.\"\n\n\"I suppose he didn't say anything about what happened at the\nPaddington Station?\"\n\n\"No; he didn't speak about that. I wish I knew whether she cares for\nhim still. If I thought she did, I would never speak another word to\nher,--I mean about myself. Of course I am not going to quarrel with\nthem. I am not such a fool as that.\" Then Lady Julia tried to comfort\nhim, and succeeded so far that he was induced to eat the mince veal\nthat had been intended for the comfort and support of the two young\nladies who had run away.\n\n\"Do you think it is he?\" were the first words which Grace said when\nthey were fairly on their way back together.\n\n\"I should think it must be. What other man can there be, of that\nsort, who would be likely to come to Allington to see you?\"\n\n\"His coming is not likely. I cannot understand that he should come.\nHe let me leave Silverbridge without seeing me,--and I thought that\nhe was quite right.\"\n\n\"And I think he is quite right to come here. I am very glad he has\ncome. It shows that he has really something like a heart inside him.\nHad he not come, or sent, or written, or taken some step before the\ntrial comes on, to make you know that he was thinking of you, I\nshould have said that he was as hard,--as hard as any other man that\nI ever heard of. Men are so hard! But I don't think he is, now. I\nam beginning to regard him as the one chevalier sans peur et sans\nreproche, and to fancy that you ought to go down on your knees before\nhim, and kiss his highness's shoebuckle. In judging of men one's mind\nvacillates so quickly between the scorn which is due to a false man\nand the worship which is due to a true man.\" Then she was silent for\na moment, but Grace said nothing, and Lily continued, \"I tell you\nfairly, Grace, that I shall expect very much from you now.\"\n\n\"Much in what way, Lily?\"\n\n\"In the way of worship. I shall not be content that you should merely\nlove him. If he has come here, as he must have done, to say that the\nmoment of the world's reproach is the moment he has chosen to ask you\nto be his wife, I think that you will owe him more than love.\"\n\n\"I shall owe him more than love, and I will pay him more than love,\"\nsaid Grace. There was something in the tone of her voice as she spoke\nwhich made Lily stop her and look up into her face. There was a smile\nthere which Lily had never seen before, and which gave a beauty to\nher which was wonderful to Lily's eyes. Surely this lover of Grace's\nmust have seen her smile like that, and therefore had loved her and\nwas giving such wonderful proof of his love. \"Yes,\" continued Grace,\nstanding and looking at her friend, \"you may stare at me, Lily, but\nyou may be sure that I will do for Major Grantly all the good that I\ncan do for him.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Grace?\"\n\n\"Never mind what I mean. You are very imperious in managing your own\naffairs, and you must let me be so equally in mine.\"\n\n\"But I tell you everything.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose that if--if--if in real truth it can possibly be the\ncase that Major Grantly shall have come here to offer me his hand\nwhen we are all ground down into the dust, as we are, do you think\nthat I will let him sacrifice himself? Would you?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Why not? There will be no sacrifice. He will be asking\nfor that which he wishes to get; and you will be bound to give it to\nhim.\"\n\n\"If he wants it, where is his nobility? If it be as you say, he will\nhave shown himself noble, and his nobility will have consisted in\nthis, that he has been willing to take that which he does not want,\nin order that he may succour one whom he loves. I also will succour\none whom I love, as best I know how.\" Then she walked on quickly\nbefore her friend, and Lily stood for a moment thinking before she\nfollowed her. They were now on a field-path, by which they were\nenabled to escape the road back to Allington for the greater part of\nthe distance, and Grace had reached a stile, and had clambered over\nit before Lily had caught her.\n\n\"You must not go away by yourself,\" said Lily.\n\n\"I don't wish to go away by myself.\"\n\n\"I want you to stop a moment and listen to me. I am sure you are\nwrong in this,--wrong for both your sakes. You believe that he loves\nyou?\"\n\n\"I thought he did once; and if he has come here to see me, I suppose\nhe does still.\"\n\n\"If that be the case, and if you also love him--\"\n\n\"I do. I make no mystery about that to you. I do love him with all my\nheart. I love him to-day, now that I believe him to be here, and that\nI suppose I shall see him, perhaps this very afternoon. And I loved\nhim yesterday, when I thought that I should never see him again. I\ndo love him. I do. I love him so well that I will never do him an\ninjury.\"\n\n\"That being so, if he makes you an offer you are bound to accept it.\nI do not think that you have an alternative.\"\n\n\"I have an alternative, and I shall use it. Why don't you take my\ncousin John?\"\n\n\"Because I like somebody else better. If you have got as good a\nreason I won't say another word to you.\"\n\n\"And why don't you take that other person?\"\n\n\"Because I cannot trust his love; that is why. It is not very kind of\nyou, opening my sores afresh, when I am trying to heal yours.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lily, am I unkind,--unkind to you, who have been so generous to\nme?\"\n\n\"I'll forgive you all that and a deal more if you will only listen\nto me and try to take my advice. Because this major of yours does a\ngenerous thing, which is for the good of you both,--the infinite good\nof both of you,--you are to emulate his generosity by doing a thing\nwhich will be for the good of neither of you. That is about it. Yes,\nit is, Grace. You cannot doubt that he has been meaning this for some\ntime past; and of course, if he looks upon you as his own,--and I\ndaresay, if the whole truth is to be told, he does--\"\n\n\"But I am not his own.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are, in one sense; you have just said so with a great deal\nof energy. And if it is so,--let me see, where was I?\"\n\n\"Oh, Lily, you need not mind where you were.\"\n\n\"But I do mind, and I hate to be interrupted in my arguments. Yes,\njust that. If he saw his cow sick, he'd try to doctor the cow in her\nsickness. He sees that you are sick, and of course he comes to your\nrelief.\"\n\n\"I am not Major Grantly's cow.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are.\"\n\n\"Nor his dog, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is his,\nexcept--except, Lily, the dearest friend that he has on the face of\nthe earth. He cannot have a friend that will go further for him than\nI will. He will never know how far I will go to serve him. You don't\nknow his people. Nor do I know them. But I know what they are. His\nsister is married to a marquis.\"\n\n\"What has that to do with it?\" said Lily, sharply. \"If she were\nmarried to an archduke, what difference would that make?\"\n\n\"And they are proud people--all of them--and rich; and they live with\nhigh persons in the world.\"\n\n\"I didn't care though they lived with the royal family, and had the\nPrince of Wales for their bosom friend. It only shows how much better\nhe is than they are.\"\n\n\"But think what my family is,--how we are situated. When my father\nwas simply poor I did not care about it, because he has been born and\nbred a gentleman. But now he is disgraced. Yes, Lily, he is. I am\nbound to say so, at any rate to myself, when I am thinking of Major\nGrantly; and I will not carry that disgrace into a family which would\nfeel it so keenly as they would do.\" Lily, however, went on with her\narguments, and was still arguing when they turned the corner of the\nlane, and came upon Lily's uncle and the major himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nSHOWING WHAT MAJOR GRANTLY DID AFTER HIS WALK.\n\n\nIn going down from the church to the Small House Lily Dale had all\nthe conversation to herself. During some portion of the way the path\nwas only broad enough for two persons, and here Major Grantly walked\nby Lily's side, while Grace followed them. Then they found their way\ninto the house, and Lily made her little speech to her mother about\ncatching the major. \"Yes, my dear, I have seen Major Grantly before,\"\nsaid Mrs. Dale. \"I suppose he has met you on the road. But I did not\nexpect that any of you would have returned so soon.\" Some little\nexplanation followed as to the squire, and as to Major Grantly's\nwalk, and after that the great thing was to leave the two lovers\nalone. \"You will dine here, of course, Major Grantly,\" Mrs. Dale\nsaid. But this he declined. He had learned, he said, that there was a\nnight-train up to London, and he thought that he would return to town\nby that. He had intended, when he left London, to get back as soon as\npossible. Then Mrs. Dale, having hesitated for two or three seconds,\ngot up and left the room, and Lily followed. \"It seems very odd and\nabrupt,\" said Mrs. Dale to her daughter, \"but I suppose it is best.\"\n\"Of course it is best, mamma. Do as one would be done by,--that's the\nonly rule. It will be much better for her that she should have it\nover.\"\n\nGrace was seated on a sofa, and Major Grantly got up from his chair,\nand came and stood opposite to her. \"Grace,\" he said, \"I hope you are\nnot angry with me for coming down to see you here.\"\n\n\"No, I am not angry,\" she said.\n\n\"I have thought a great deal about it, and your friend, Miss\nPrettyman, knew that I was coming. She quite approves of my coming.\"\n\n\"She has written to me, but did not tell me of it,\" said Grace, not\nknowing what other answer to make.\n\n\"No,--she could not have done that. She had no authority. I only\nmention her name because it will have weight with you, and because\nI have not done that which, under other circumstances, perhaps, I\nshould have been bound to do. I have not seen your father.\"\n\n\"Poor papa,\" said Grace.\n\n\"I have felt that at the present moment I could not do so with any\nsuccess. It has not come of any want of respect either for him or\nfor you. Of course, Grace, you know why I am here?\" He paused, and\nthen remembering that he had no right to expect an answer to such a\nquestion, he continued, \"I have come here, dearest Grace, to ask you\nto be my wife, and to be a mother to Edith. I know that you love\nEdith.\"\n\n\"I do indeed.\"\n\n\"And I have hoped sometimes,--though I suppose I ought not to say\nso,--but I have hoped and almost thought sometimes, that you have\nbeen willing to--to love me, too. It is better to tell the truth\nsimply, is it not?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Grace.\n\n\"And therefore, and because I love you dearly myself, I have come to\nask you to be my wife.\" Saying which he opened out his hand, and held\nit to her. But she did not take it. \"There is my hand, Grace. If your\nheart is as I would have it you can give me yours, and I shall want\nnothing else to make me happy.\" But still she made no motion towards\ngranting him his request. \"If I have been too sudden,\" he said, \"you\nmust forgive me for that. I have been sudden and abrupt, but as\nthings are, no other way has been open to me. Can you not bring\nyourself to give me some answer, Grace?\" His hand had now fallen\nagain to his side, but he was still standing before her.\n\nShe had said no word to him as yet, except that one in which she had\nacknowledged her love for his child, and had expressed no surprise,\neven in her countenance, at his proposal. And yet the idea that he\nshould do such a thing, since the idea that he certainly would do it\nhad become clear to her, had filled her with a world of surprise. No\ngirl ever lived with any beauty belonging to her who had a smaller\nknowledge of her own possession than Grace Crawley. Nor had she the\nslightest pride in her own acquirements. That she had been taught in\nmany things more than had been taught to other girls, had come of her\npoverty and of the desolation of her home. She had learned to read\nGreek and Italian because there had been nothing else for her to do\nin that sad house. And, subsequently, accuracy of knowledge had been\nnecessary for the earning of her bread. I think that Grace had at\ntimes been weak enough to envy the idleness and almost to envy the\nignorance of other girls. Her figure was light, perfect in symmetry,\nfull of grace at all points; but she had thought nothing of her\nfigure, remembering only the poverty of her dress, but remembering\nalso with a brave resolution that she would never be ashamed of it.\nAnd as her acquaintance with Major Grantly had begun and had grown,\nand as she had learned to feel unconsciously that his company was\npleasanter to her than that of any other person she knew, she had\nstill told herself that anything like love must be out of the\nquestion. But then words had been spoken, and there had been glances\nin his eye, and a tone in his voice, and a touch upon his fingers,\nof which she could not altogether refuse to accept the meaning. And\nothers had spoken to her of it, the two Miss Prettymans and her\nfriend Lily. Yet she would not admit to herself that it could be so,\nand she would not allow herself to confess to herself that she loved\nhim. Then had come the last killing misery to which her father had\nbeen subjected. He had been accused of stealing money, and had been\ncommitted to be tried for the theft. From that moment, at any rate,\nany hope, if there had been a hope, must be crushed. But she swore\nto herself bravely that there had been no such hope. And she assured\nherself also that nothing had passed which had entitled her to\nexpect anything beyond ordinary friendship from the man of whom she\ncertainly had thought much. Even if those touches and those tones\nand those glances had meant anything, all such meaning must be\nannihilated by this disgrace which had come upon her. She might know\nthat her father was innocent; she might be sure, at any rate, that\nhe had been innocent in intention; but the world thought differently,\nand she, her brother and sister, and her mother and her poor father,\nmust bend to the world's opinion. If those dangerous joys had meant\nanything, they must be taken as meaning nothing more.\n\nThus she had argued with herself, and, fortified by such\nself-teachings, she had come down to Allington. Since she had been\nwith her friends there had come upon her from day to day a clear\nconviction that her arguments had been undoubtedly true,--a clear\nconviction which had been very cold to her heart in spite of all her\ncourage. She had expected nothing, hoped for nothing, and yet when\nnothing came she was sad. She thought of one special half-hour in\nwhich he had said almost all that he might have said,--more than he\nought to have said;--of a moment during which her hand had remained\nin his; of a certain pressure with which he had put her shawl upon\nher shoulders. If he had only written to her one word to tell her\nthat he believed her father was innocent! But no; she had no right to\nexpect anything from him. And then Lily had ceased to talk of him,\nand she did expect nothing. Now he was there before her, asking her\nto come to him and be his wife. Yes; she would kiss his shoebuckles,\nonly that the kissing of his shoebuckles would bring upon him that\ninjury which he should never suffer from her hands! He had been\ngenerous, and her self-pride was satisfied. But her other pride was\ntouched, and she also would be generous. \"Can you not bring yourself\nto give me some answer?\" he had said to her. Of course she must give\nhim an answer, but how should she give it?\n\n\"You are very kind,\" she said.\n\n\"I would be more than kind.\"\n\n\"So you are. Kind is a cold word when used to such a friend at such a\ntime.\"\n\n\"I would be everything on earth to you that a man can be to a woman.\"\n\n\"I know I ought to thank you if I knew how. My heart is full of\nthanks; it is, indeed.\"\n\n\"And is there no room for love there?\"\n\n\"There is no room for love in our house, Major Grantly. You have not\nseen papa.\"\n\n\"No; but, if you wish it, I will do so at once.\"\n\n\"It would do no good,--none. I only asked you because you can hardly\nknow how sad is our state at home.\"\n\n\"But I cannot see that that need deter you, if you can love me.\"\n\n\"Can you not? If you saw him, and the house, and my mother, you would\nnot say so. In the Bible it is said of some season that it is not a\ntime for marrying, or for giving in marriage. And so it is with us.\"\n\n\"I am not pressing you as to a day. I only ask you to say that you\nwill be engaged to me,--so that I may tell my own people, and let it\nbe known.\"\n\n\"I understand all that. I know how good you are. But, Major Grantly,\nyou must understand me also when I assure you that it cannot be so.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you refuse me altogether?\"\n\n\"Yes; altogether.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Must I answer that question? Ought I to be made to answer it? But I\nwill tell you fairly, without touching on anything else, that I feel\nthat we are all disgraced, and that I will not take disgrace into\nanother family.\"\n\n\"Grace, do you love me?\"\n\n\"I love no one now,--that is, as you mean. I can love no one. I have\nno room for any feeling except for my father and mother, and for us\nall. I should not be here now but that I save my mother the bread\nthat I should eat at home.\"\n\n\"Is it as bad as that?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is as bad as that. It is much worse than that, if you knew\nit all. You cannot conceive how low we have fallen. And now they tell\nme that my father will be found guilty, and will be sent to prison.\nPutting ourselves out of the question, what would you think of a girl\nwho could engage herself to any man under such circumstances? What\nwould you think of a girl who would allow herself to be in love in\nsuch a position? Had I been ten times engaged to you I would have\nbroken it off.\" Then she got up to leave him.\n\nBut he stopped her, holding her by the arm. \"What you have said will\nmake me say what I certainly should never have said without it. I\ndeclare that we are engaged.\"\n\n\"No, we are not,\" said Grace.\n\n\"You have told me that you loved me.\"\n\n\"I never told you so.\"\n\n\"There are other ways of speaking than the voice; and I will boast to\nyou, though to no one else, that you have told me so. I believe you\nlove me. I shall hold myself as engaged to you, and I shall think\nyou false if I hear that you listen to another man. Now, good-by,\nGrace;--my own Grace.\"\n\n\"No, I am not your own,\" she said, through her tears.\n\n\"You are my own, my very own. God bless you, dear, dear, dearest\nGrace. You shall hear from me in a day or two, and shall see me as\nsoon as this horrid trial is over.\" Then he took her in his arms\nbefore she could escape from him, and kissed her forehead and her\nlips, while she struggled in his arms. After that he left the room\nand the house as quickly as he could, and was seen no more of the\nDales upon that occasion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nSHOWING HOW MAJOR GRANTLY RETURNED TO GUESTWICK.\n\n\nGrace, when she was left alone, threw herself upon the sofa, and hid\nher face in her hands. She was weeping almost hysterically, and had\nbeen utterly dismayed and frightened by her lover's impetuosity.\nThings had gone after a fashion which her imagination had not painted\nto her as possible. Surely she had the power to refuse the man if she\npleased. And yet she felt as she lay there weeping that she did in\ntruth belong to him as part of his goods, and that her generosity had\nbeen foiled. She had especially resolved that she would not confess\nto any love for him. She had made no such confession. She had guarded\nherself against doing so with all the care which she knew how to\nuse. But he had assumed the fact, and she had been unable to deny\nit. Could she have lied to him, and have sworn that she did not love\nhim? Could she have so perjured herself, even in support of her\ngenerosity? Yes, she would have done so,--so she told herself,--if a\nmoment had been given to her for thought. She ought to have done so,\nand she blamed herself for being so little prepared for the occasion.\nThe lie would be useless now. Indeed, she would have no opportunity\nfor telling it; for of course she would not answer,--would not even\nread his letter. Though he might know that she loved him, yet she\nwould not be his wife. He had forced her secret from her, but he\ncould not force her to marry him. She did love him, but he should\nnever be disgraced by her love.\n\nAfter a while she was able to think of his conduct, and she believed\nthat she ought to be very angry with him. He had taken her roughly in\nhis arms, and had insulted her. He had forced a kiss from her. She\nhad felt his arms warm and close and strong about her, and had not\nknown whether she was in paradise or in purgatory. She was very angry\nwith him. She would send back his letter to him without reading\nit,--without opening it, if that might be possible. He had done that\nto her which nothing could justify. But yet,--yet,--yet how dearly\nshe loved him! Was he not a prince of men? He had behaved badly, of\ncourse; but had any man ever behaved so badly before in so divine a\nway? Was it not a thousand pities that she should be driven to deny\nanything to a lover who so richly deserved everything that could be\ngiven to him? He had kissed her hand as he let her go, and now, not\nknowing what she did, she kissed the spot on which she had felt his\nlips. His arm had been round her waist, and the old frock which she\nwore should be kept by her for ever, because it had been so graced.\n\nWhat was she now to say to Lily and to Lily's mother? Of one thing\nthere was no doubt. She would never tell them of her lover's wicked\naudacity. That was a secret never to be imparted to any ears. She\nwould keep her resentment to herself, and not ask the protection of\nany vicarious wrath. He could never so sin again, that was certain;\nand she would keep all knowledge and memory of the sin for her own\npurposes. But how could it be that such a man as that, one so good\nthough so sinful, so glorious though so great a trespasser, should\nhave come to such a girl as her and have asked for her love? Then she\nthought of her father's poverty and the misery of her own condition,\nand declared to herself that it was very wonderful.\n\nLily was the first to enter the room, and she, before she did so,\nlearned from the servant that Major Grantly had left the house. \"I\nheard the door, miss, and then I saw the top of his hat out of the\npantry window.\" Armed with this certain information Lily entered the\ndrawing-room, and found Grace in the act of rising from the sofa.\n\n\"Am I disturbing you?\" said Lily.\n\n\"No; not at all. I am glad you have come. Kiss me, and be good to\nme.\" And she twined her arms about Lily and embraced her.\n\n\"Am I not always good to you, you simpleton? Has he been good?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean?\"\n\n\"And have you been good to him?\"\n\n\"As good as I knew how, Lily.\"\n\n\"And where is he?\"\n\n\"He has gone away. I shall never see him any more, Lily.\"\n\nThen she hid her face upon her friend's shoulder and broke forth\nagain into hysterical tears.\n\n\"But tell me, Grace, what he said;--that is, if you mean to tell me!\"\n\n\"I will tell you everything;--that is, everything I can.\" And Grace\nblushed as she thought of the one secret which she certainly would\nnot tell.\n\n\"Has he,--has he done what I said he would do? Come, speak out\nboldly. Has he asked you to be his wife?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Grace, barely whispering the word.\n\n\"And you have accepted him?\"\n\n\"No, Lily, I have not. Indeed, I have not. I did not know how to\nspeak, because I was surprised;--and he, of course, could say what\nhe liked. But I told him as well as I could, that I would not marry\nhim.\"\n\n\"And why;--did you tell him why?\"\n\n\"Yes; because of papa!\"\n\n\"Then, if he is the man I take him to be, that answer will go for\nnothing. Of course he knew all that before he came here. He did not\nthink you were an heiress with forty thousand pounds. If he is in\nearnest, that will go for nothing. And I think he is in earnest.\"\n\n\"And so was I in earnest.\"\n\n\"Well, Grace;--we shall see.\"\n\n\"I suppose I may have a will of my own, Lily.\"\n\n\"Do not be so sure of that. Women are not allowed to have wills of\ntheir own on all occasions. Some man comes in a girl's way, and she\ngets to be fond of him, just because he does come in her way. Well;\nwhen that has taken place, she has no alternative but to be taken if\nhe chooses to take her; or to be left, if he chooses to leave her.\"\n\n\"Lily, don't say that.\"\n\n\"But I do say it. A man may assure himself that he will find for\nhimself a wife who shall be learned, or beautiful, or six feet\nhigh, if he wishes it, or who has red hair, or red eyes, or red\ncheeks,--just what he pleases; and he may go about till he finds it,\nas you can go about and match your worsteds. You are a fool if you\nbuy a colour you don't want. But we can never match our worsteds\nfor that other piece of work, but are obliged to take any colour\nthat comes,--and, therefore, it is that we make such a jumble of it!\nHere's mamma. We must not be philosophical before her. Mamma, Major\nGrantly has--skedaddled.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lily, what a word!\"\n\n\"But, oh, mamma, what a thing! Fancy his going away and not saying a\nword to anybody!\"\n\n\"If he had anything to say to Grace, I suppose he said it.\"\n\n\"He asked her to marry him, of course. We none of us had any doubt\nabout that. He swore to her that she and none but she should be his\nwife,--and all that kind of thing. But he seems to have done it in\nthe most prosaic way;--and now he has gone away without saying a word\nto any of us. I shall never speak to him again,--unless Grace asks\nme.\"\n\n\"Grace, my dear, may I congratulate you?\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\nGrace did not answer, as Lily was too quick for her. \"Oh, she has\nrefused him, of course. But Major Grantly is a man of too much sense\nto expect that he should succeed the first time. Let me see; this is\nthe fourteenth. These clocks run fourteen days, and, therefore, you\nmay expect him again about the twenty-eighth. For myself, I think you\nare giving him an immense deal of unnecessary trouble, and that if he\nleft you in the lurch it would only serve you right; but you have the\nworld with you, I'm told. A girl is supposed to tell a man two fibs\nbefore she may tell him one truth.\"\n\n\"I told him no fib, Lily. I told him that I would not marry him, and\nI will not.\"\n\n\"But why not, dear Grace?\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\"Because the people say that papa is a thief!\" Having said this,\nGrace walked slowly out of the room, and neither Mrs. Dale nor Lily\nattempted to follow her.\n\n\"She's as good as gold,\" said Lily, when the door was closed.\n\n\"And he;--what of him?\"\n\n\"I think he is good, too; but she has told me nothing yet of what\nhe has said to her. He must be good, or he would not have come down\nhere after her. But I don't wonder at his coming, because she is so\nbeautiful! Once or twice as we were walking back to-day, I thought\nher face was the most lovely that I had ever seen. And did you see\nher just now, as she spoke of her father?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--I saw her.\"\n\n\"Think what she will be in two or three years' time, when she becomes\na woman. She talks French, and Italian, and Hebrew for anything that\nI know; and she is perfectly beautiful. I never saw a more lovely\nfigure;--and she has spirit enough for a goddess. I don't think that\nMajor Grantly is such a fool after all.\"\n\n\"I never took him for a fool.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt all his own people do;--or they will, when they hear\nof it. But, mamma, she will grow to be big enough to walk atop of all\nthe Lady Hartletops in England. It will all come right at last.\"\n\n\"You think it will?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Why should it not? If he is worth having, it will;--and\nI think he is worth having. He must wait till this horrid trial is\nover. It is clear to me that Grace thinks that her father will be\nconvicted.\"\n\n\"But he cannot have taken the money.\"\n\n\"I think he took it, and I think it wasn't his. But I don't think he\nstole it. I don't know whether you can understand the difference.\"\n\n\"I am afraid a jury won't understand it.\"\n\n\"A jury of men will not. I wish they could put you and me on it,\nmamma. I would take my best boots and eat them down to the heels, for\nGrace's sake, and for Major Grantly's. What a good-looking man he\nis!\"\n\n\"Yes, he is.\"\n\n\"And so like a gentleman! I'll tell you what, mamma; we won't say\nanything to her about him for the present. Her heart will be so full\nshe will be driven to talk, and we can comfort her better in that\nway.\" The mother and daughter agreed to act upon these tactics, and\nnothing more was said to Grace about her lover on that evening.\n\nMajor Grantly walked from Mrs. Dale's house to the inn and ordered\nhis gig, and drove himself out of Allington, almost without\nremembering where he was or whither he was going. He was thinking\nsolely of what had just occurred, and of what, on his part, should\nfollow as the result of that meeting. Half at least of the noble\ndeeds done in this world are due to emulation, rather than to the\nnative nobility of the actors. A young man leads a forlorn hope\nbecause another young man has offered to do so. Jones in the\nhunting-field rides at an impracticable fence because he is told that\nSmith took it three years ago. And Walker puts his name down for ten\nguineas at a charitable dinner, when he hears Thompson's read out for\nfive. And in this case the generosity and self-denial shown by Grace\nwarmed and cherished similar virtues within her lover's breast. Some\nfew weeks ago Major Grantly had been in doubt as to what his duty\nrequired of him in reference to Grace Crawley; but he had no doubt\nwhatsoever now. In the fervour of his admiration he would have gone\nstraight to the archdeacon, had it been possible, and have told him\nwhat he had done and what he intended to do. Nothing now should\nstop him;--no consideration, that is, either as regarded money or\nposition. He had pledged himself solemnly, and he was very glad that\nhe had pledged himself. He would write to Grace and explain to her\nthat he trusted altogether in her father's honour and innocence, but\nthat no consideration as to that ought to influence either him or her\nin any way. If, independently of her father, she could bring herself\nto come to him and be his wife, she was bound to do so now, let the\nposition of her father be what it might. And thus, as he drove his\ngig back towards Guestwick, he composed a very pretty letter to the\nlady of his love.\n\nAnd as he went, at the corner of the lane which led from the main\nroad up to Guestwick cottage, he again came upon John Eames, who\nwas also returning to Guestwick. There had been a few words spoken\nbetween Lady Julia and Johnny respecting Major Grantly after the\ngirls had left the cottage, and Johnny had been persuaded that the\nstrange visitor to Allington could have no connection with his\narch-enemy. \"And why has he gone to Allington?\" John demanded,\nsomewhat sternly, of his hostess.\n\n\"Well; if you ask me, I think he has gone there to see your cousin,\nGrace Crawley.\"\n\n\"He told me that he knew Grace,\" said John, looking as though he were\nconscious of his own ingenuity in putting two and two together very\ncleverly.\n\n\"Your cousin Grace is a very pretty girl,\" said Lady Julia.\n\n\"It's a long time since I've seen her,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Why, you saw her just this minute,\" said Lady Julia.\n\n\"I didn't look at her,\" said Johnny. Therefore, when he again met\nMajor Grantly, having continued to put two and two together with\ngreat ingenuity, he felt quite sure that the man had nothing to do\nwith the arch-enemy, and he determined to be gracious. \"Did you find\nthem at home at Allington?\" he said, raising his hat.\n\n\"How do you do again?\" said the major. \"Yes, I found your friend Mrs.\nDale at home.\"\n\n\"But not her daughter, or my cousin? They were up there;--where I've\ncome from. But, perhaps, they had got back before you left.\"\n\n\"I saw them both. They found me on the road with Mr. Dale.\"\n\n\"What,--the squire? Then you have seen everybody?\"\n\n\"Everybody I wished to see at Allington.\"\n\n\"But you wouldn't stay at the 'Red Lion?'\"\n\n\"Well, no. I remembered that I wanted to get back to London; and as\nI had seen my friends, I thought I might as well hurry away.\"\n\n\"You knew Mrs. Dale before, then?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't. I never saw her in my life before. But I knew the old\nsquire when I was a boy. However, I should have said friend. I went\nto see one friend, and I saw her.\"\n\nJohn Eames perceived that his companion put a strong emphasis on the\nword \"her,\" as though he were determined to declare boldly that he\nhad gone to Allington solely to see Grace Crawley. He had not the\nslightest objection to recognizing in Major Grantly a suitor for his\ncousin's hand. He could only reflect what an unusually fortunate girl\nGrace must be if such a thing could be true. Of those poor Crawleys\nhe had only heard from time to time that their misfortunes were as\nnumerous as the sands on the sea-shore, and as unsusceptible of any\nfixed and permanent arrangement. But, as regarded Grace, here would\nbe a very permanent arrangement. Tidings had reached him that Grace\nwas a great scholar, but he had never heard much of her beauty. It\nmust probably be the case that Major Grantly was fond of Greek. There\nwas, he reminded himself, no accounting for tastes; but as nothing\ncould be more respectable than such an alliance, he thought that it\nwould become him to be civil to the major.\n\n\"I hope you found her quite well. I had barely time to speak to her\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Yes, she was very well. This is a sad thing about her father.\"\n\n\"Very sad,\" said Johnny. Perhaps the major had heard about the\naccusation for the first time to-day, and was going to find an escape\non that plea. If such was the case, it would not be so well to be\nparticularly civil.\n\n\"I believe Mr. Crawley is a cousin of yours?\" said the major.\n\n\"His wife is my mother's first-cousin. Their mothers were sisters.\"\n\n\"She is an excellent woman.\"\n\n\"I believe so. I don't know much about them myself,--that is,\npersonally. Of course I have heard of this charge that has been made\nagainst him. It seems to me to be a great shame.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't exactly say that it is a shame. I do not know that\nthere has been anything done with a feeling of persecution or of\ncruelty. It is a great mystery, and we must have it cleared up if we\ncan.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose he can have been guilty,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Certainly not in the ordinary sense of the word. I heard all the\nevidence against him.\"\n\n\"Oh, you did?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the major. \"I live near them in Barsetshire, and I am one\nof his bailsmen.\"\n\n\"Then you are an old friend, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not exactly that; but circumstances make me very much interested\nabout them. I fancy that the cheque was left in his house by\naccident, and that it got into his hands he didn't know how, and that\nwhen he used it he thought it was his.\"\n\n\"That's queer,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"He is very odd, you know.\"\n\n\"But it's a kind of oddity that they don't like at the assizes.\"\n\n\"The great cruelty is,\" said the major, \"that whatever may be the\nresult, the punishment will fall so heavily upon his wife and\ndaughters. I think the whole county ought to come forward and take\nthem by the hand. Well, good-by. I'll drive on, as I'm a little in a\nhurry.\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" said Johnny. \"I'm very glad to have had the pleasure of\nmeeting you.\" \"He's a good sort of a fellow after all,\" he said to\nhimself when the gig had passed on. \"He wouldn't have talked in that\nway if he had meant to hang back.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nMR. TOOGOOD.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. Crawley had declared to Mr. Robarts, that he would summon no\nlegal aid to his assistance at the coming trial. The reader may,\nperhaps, remember the impetuosity with which he rejected the advice\non this subject which was conveyed to him by Mr. Robarts with all the\nauthority of Archdeacon Grantly's name. \"Tell the archdeacon,\" he had\nsaid, \"that I will have none of his advice.\" And then Mr. Robarts had\nleft him, fully convinced that any further interference on his part\ncould be of no avail. Nevertheless, the words which had then been\nspoken were not without effect. This coming trial was ever present to\nMr. Crawley's mind, and though, when driven to discuss the subject,\nhe would speak of it with high spirit, as he had done both to the\nbishop and to Mr. Robarts, yet in his long hours of privacy, or when\nalone with his wife, his spirit was anything but high. \"It will kill\nme,\" he would say to her. \"I shall get salvation thus. Death will\nrelieve me, and I shall never be called upon to stand before those\ncruel eager eyes.\" Then would she try to say words of comfort,\nsometimes soothing him as though he were a child, and at others\nbidding him be a man, and remember that as a man he should have\nsufficient endurance to bear the eyes of any crowd that might be\nthere to look at him.\n\n\"I think I will go up to London,\" he said to her one evening, very\nsoon after the day of Mr. Robarts's visit.\n\n\"Go up to London, Josiah!\" Mr. Crawley had not been up to London\nonce since they had been settled at Hogglestock, and this sudden\nresolution on his part frightened his wife. \"Go up to London,\ndearest! and why?\"\n\n\"I will tell you why. They all say that I should speak to some man of\nthe law whom I may trust about this coming trial. I trust no one in\nthese parts. Not, mark you, that I say that they are untrustworthy.\nGod forbid that I should so speak or even so think of men whom I\nknow not. But the matter has become so common in men's mouths at\nBarchester and at Silverbridge, that I cannot endure to go among\nthem and to talk of it. I will go up to London, and I will see your\ncousin, Mr. John Toogood, of Gray's Inn.\" Now in this scheme there\nwas an amount of everyday prudence which startled Mrs. Crawley almost\nas much as did the prospect of the difficulties to be overcome if the\njourney were to be made. Her husband, in the first place, had never\nonce seen Mr. John Toogood; and in days very long back, when he and\nshe were making their first gallant struggle,--for in those days it\nhad been gallant,--down in their Cornish curacy, he had reprobated\ncertain Toogood civilities,--professional civilities,--which had been\nproffered, perhaps, with too plain an intimation that on the score\nof relationship the professional work should be done without payment.\nThe Mr. Toogood of those days, who had been Mrs. Crawley's uncle,\nand the father of Mrs. Eames and grandfather of our friend Johnny\nEames, had been much angered by some correspondence which had grown\nup between him and Mr. Crawley, and from that day there had been a\ncessation of all intercourse between the families. Since those days\nthat Toogood had been gathered to the ancient Toogoods of old, and\nthe son reigned on the family throne in Raymond's Buildings. The\npresent Toogood was therefore first-cousin to Mrs. Crawley. But\nthere had been no intimacy between them. Mrs. Crawley had not seen\nher cousin since her marriage,--as indeed she had seen none of her\nrelations, having been estranged from them by the singular bearing of\nher husband. She knew that her cousin stood high in his profession,\nthe firm of Toogood and Crump,--Crump and Toogood it should have been\nproperly called in these days,--having always held its head up high\nabove all dirty work; and she felt that her husband could look for\nadvice from no better source. But how would such a one as he manage\nto tell his story to a stranger? Nay, how would he find his way alone\ninto the lawyer's room, to tell his story at all,--so strange was he\nto the world? And then the expense! \"If you do not wish me to apply\nto your cousin, say so, and there shall be an end of it,\" said Mr.\nCrawley in an angry tone.\n\n\"Of course I would wish it. I believe him to be an excellent man, and\na good lawyer.\"\n\n\"Then why should I not go to his chambers? In form\u00c3\u00a2 pauperis I must\ngo to him, and must tell him so. I cannot pay him for the labour of\nhis counsel, nor for such minutes of his time as I shall use.\"\n\n\"Oh, Josiah, you need not speak of that.\"\n\n\"But I must speak of it. Can I go to a professional man, who keeps\nas it were his shop open for those who may think fit to come, and\npurchase of him, and take of his goods, and afterwards, when the\ngoods have been used, tell him that I have not the price in my hand?\nI will not do that, Mary. You think that I am mad, that I know not\nwhat I do. Yes,--I see it in your eyes; and you are sometimes partly\nright. But I am not so mad but that I know what is honest. I will\ntell your cousin that I am sore straitened, and brought down into\nthe very dust by misfortune. And I will beseech him, for what of\nancient feeling of family he may bear to you, to listen to me for a\nwhile. And I will be very short, and, if need be, will bide his time\npatiently, and perhaps he may say a word to me that may be of use.\"\n\nThere was certainly very much in this to provoke Mrs. Crawley. It\nwas not only that she knew well that her cousin would give ample\nand immediate attention, and lend himself thoroughly to the matter\nwithout any idea of payment,--but that she could not quite believe\nthat her husband's humility was true humility. She strove to believe\nit, but knew that she failed. After all it was only a feeling on her\npart. There was no argument within herself about it. An unpleasant\ntaste came across the palate of her mind, as such a savour will\nsometimes, from some unexpected source, come across the palate of the\nmouth. Well; she could only gulp at it, and swallow it and excuse it.\nAmong the salad that comes from your garden a bitter leaf will now\nand then make its way into your salad-bowl. Alas, there were so many\nbitter leaves ever making their way into her bowl! \"What I mean is,\nJosiah, that no long explanation will be needed. I think, from what I\nremember of him, that he would do for us anything that he could do.\"\n\n\"Then I will go to the man, and will humble myself before him. Even\nthat, hard as it is to me, may be a duty that I owe.\" Mr. Crawley as\nhe said this was remembering the fact that he was a clergyman of the\nChurch of England, and that he had a rank of his own in the country,\nwhich, did he ever do such a thing as go out to dinner in company,\nwould establish for him a certain right of precedence; whereas this\nattorney, of whom he was speaking, was, so to say, nobody in the eyes\nof the world.\n\n\"There need be no humbling, Josiah, other than that which is due from\nman to man in all circumstances. But never mind; we will not talk\nabout that. If it seems good to you, go to Mr. Toogood. I think that\nit is good. May I write to him and say that you will go?\"\n\n\"I will write myself; it will be more seemly.\"\n\nThen the wife paused before she asked the next question,--paused for\nsome minute or two, and then asked it with anxious doubt,--\"And may\nI go with you, Josiah?\"\n\n\"Why should two go when one can do the work?\" he answered sharply.\n\"Have we money so much at command?\"\n\n\"Indeed, no.\"\n\n\"You should go and do it all, for you are wiser in these things than\nI am, were it not that I may not dare to show--that I submit myself\nto my wife.\"\n\n\"Nay, my dear!\"\n\n\"But it is ay, my dear. It is so. This is a thing such as men do; not\nsuch as women do, unless they be forlorn and unaided of men. I know\nthat I am weak where you are strong; that I am crazed where you are\nclear-witted.\"\n\n\"I meant not that, Josiah. It was of your health that I thought.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless it is as I say; but, for all that, it may not be that\nyou should do my work. There are those watching me who would say,\n'Lo! he confesses himself incapable.' And then some one would whisper\nsomething of a madhouse. Mary, I fear that worse than a prison.\"\n\n\"May God in His mercy forbid such cruelty!\"\n\n\"But I must look to it, my dear. Do you think that that woman, who\nsits there at Barchester in high places, disgracing herself and that\npuny ecclesiastical lord who is her husband,--do you think that she\nwould not immure me if she could? She is a she-wolf,--only less\nreasonable than the dumb brute as she sharpens her teeth in malice\ncoming from anger, and not in malice coming from hunger as do the\nouter wolves of the forest. I tell you, Mary, that if she had a\ncolourable ground for her action, she would swear to-morrow that I am\nmad.\"\n\n\"You shall go alone to London.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will go alone. They shall not say that I cannot yet do my own\nwork as a man should do it. I stood up before him, the puny man who\nis called a bishop, and before her who makes herself great by his\nlittleness, and I scorned them both to their faces. Though the shoes\nwhich I had on were all broken, as I myself could not but see when I\nstood, yet I was greater than they were with all their purple and\nfine linen.\"\n\n\"But, Josiah, my cousin will not be harsh to you.\"\n\n\"Well,--and if he be not?\"\n\n\"Ill-usage you can bear; and violent ill-usage, such as that which\nMrs. Proudie allowed herself to exhibit, you can repay with interest;\nbut kindness seems to be too heavy a burden for you.\"\n\n\"I will struggle. I will endeavour. I will speak but little, and, if\npossible, I will listen much. Now, my dear, I will write to this man,\nand you shall give me the address that is proper for him.\" Then he\nwrote the letter, not accepting a word in the way of dictation from\nhis wife, but \"craving the great kindness of a short interview, for\nwhich he ventured to become a solicitor, urged thereto by his wife's\nassurance that one with whom he was connected by family ties would do\nas much as this for the possible preservation of the honour of the\nfamily.\" In answer to this, Mr. Toogood wrote back as follows:--\"Dear\nMr. Crawley, I will be at my office all Thursday morning next from\nten to two, and will take care that you shan't be kept waiting for\nme above ten minutes. You parsons never like waiting. But hadn't you\nbetter come and breakfast with me and Maria at nine? then we'd have a\ntalk as we walk to the office. Yours always, THOMAS TOOGOOD.\" And\nthe letter was dated from the attorney's private house in Tavistock\nSquare.\n\n\"I am sure he means to be kind,\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\n\"Doubtless he means to be kind. But his kindness is rough;--I will\nnot say unmannerly, as the word would be harsh. I have never even\nseen the lady whom he calls Maria.\"\n\n\"She is his wife!\"\n\n\"So I would venture to suppose; but she is unknown to me. I will\nwrite again, and thank him, and say that I will be with him at ten to\nthe moment.\"\n\nThere were still many things to be settled before the journey could\nbe made. Mr. Crawley, in his first plan, proposed that he should\ngo up by night mail train, travelling in the third class, having\nwalked over to Silverbridge to meet it; that he should then walk\nabout London from 5 A.M. to 10 A.M., and afterwards come down by an\nafternoon train to which a third class was also attached. But at last\nhis wife persuaded him that such a task as that, performed in the\nmiddle of the winter, would be enough to kill any man, and that,\nif attempted, it would certainly kill him; and he consented at\nlast to sleep the night in town,--being specially moved thereto by\ndiscovering that he could, in conformity with this scheme, get in\nand out of the train at a station considerably nearer to him than\nSilverbridge, and that he could get a return-ticket at a third-class\nfare. The whole journey, he found, could be done for a pound,\nallowing him seven shillings for his night's expenses in London;\nand out of the resources of the family there were produced two\nsovereigns, so that in the event of accident he would not utterly be\na castaway from want of funds.\n\nSo he started on his journey after an early dinner, almost hopeful\nthrough the new excitement of a journey to London, and his wife\nwalked with him nearly as far as the station. \"Do not reject my\ncousin's kindness,\" were the last words she spoke.\n\n\"For his professional kindness, if he will extend it to me, I will\nbe most thankful,\" he replied. She did not dare to say more; nor had\nshe dared to write privately to her cousin, asking for any special\nhelp, lest by doing so she should seem to impugn the sufficiency and\nstability of her husband's judgment. He got up to town late at night,\nand having made inquiry of one of the porters, he hired a bed for\nhimself in the neighbourhood of the railway station. Here he had\na cup of tea and a morsel of bread-and-butter, and in the morning\nhe breakfasted again on the same fare. \"No, I have no luggage,\"\nhe had said to the girl at the public-house, who had asked him as\nto his travelling gear. \"If luggage be needed as a certificate of\nrespectability, I will pass on elsewhere,\" said he. The girl stared,\nand assured him that she did not doubt his respectability. \"I\nam a clergyman of the Church of England,\" he had said, \"but my\ncircumstances prevent me from seeking a more expensive lodging.\"\nThey did their best to make him comfortable, and, I think, almost\ndisappointed him in not heaping further misfortunes on his head.\n\nHe was in Raymond's Buildings at half-past nine, and for half an\nhour walked up and down the umbrageous pavement,--it used to be\numbrageous, but perhaps the trees have gone now,--before the doors\nof the various chambers. He could hear the clock strike from Gray's\nInn; and the moment that it had struck he was turning in, but was\nencountered in the passage by Mr. Toogood, who was equally punctual\nwith himself. Strange stories about Mr. Crawley had reached Mr.\nToogood's household, and that Maria, the mention of whose Christian\nname had been so offensive to the clergyman, had begged her husband\nnot to be a moment late. Poor Mr. Toogood, who on ordinary days\ndid perhaps take a few minutes' grace, was thus hurried away almost\nwith his breakfast in his throat, and, as we have seen, just\nsaved himself. \"Perhaps, sir, you are Mr. Crawley?\" he said, in a\ngood-humoured, cheery voice. He was a good-humoured, cheery-looking\nman, about fifty years of age, with grizzled hair and sunburnt face,\nand large whiskers. Nobody would have taken him to be a partner in\nany of those great houses of which we have read in history,--the\nQuirk, Gammon and Snaps of the profession, or the Dodson and Foggs,\nwho are immortal.\n\n\"That is my name, sir,\" said Mr. Crawley, taking off his hat and\nbowing low, \"and I am here by appointment to meet Mr. Toogood, the\nsolicitor, whose name I see affixed upon the door-post.\"\n\n\"I am Mr. Toogood, the solicitor, and I hope I see you quite well,\nMr. Crawley.\" Then the attorney shook hands with the clergyman and\npreceded him upstairs to the front room on the first floor. \"Here we\nare, Mr. Crawley, and pray take a chair. I wish you could have made\nit convenient to come and see us at home. We are rather long, as my\nwife says,--long in family, she means, and therefore are not very\nwell off for spare beds--\"\n\n\"Oh, sir.\"\n\n\"I've twelve of 'em living, Mr. Crawley,--from eighteen years, the\neldest,--a girl, down to eighteen months the youngest,--a boy, and\nthey go in and out, boy and girl, boy and girl, like the cogs of a\nwheel. They ain't such far away distant cousins from your own young\nones--only first, once, as we call it.\"\n\n\"I am aware that there is a family tie, or I should not have ventured\nto trouble you.\"\n\n\"Blood is thicker than water; isn't it? I often say that. I heard\nof one of your girls only yesterday. She is staying somewhere down\nin the country, not far from where my sister lives--Mrs. Eames, the\nwidow of poor John Eames, who never did any good in this world. I\ndaresay you've heard of her?\"\n\n\"The name is familiar to me, Mr. Toogood.\"\n\n\"Of course it is. I've a nephew down there just now, and he saw\nyour girl the other day;--very highly he spoke of her too. Let me\nsee;--how many is it you have?\"\n\n\"Three living, Mr. Toogood.\"\n\n\"I've just four times three;--that's the difference. But I comfort\nmyself with the text about the quiver you know; and I tell them that\nwhen they've eat up all the butter, they'll have to take their bread\ndry.\"\n\n\"I trust the young people take your teaching in a proper spirit.\"\n\n\"I don't know much about spirit. There's spirit enough. My second\ngirl, Lucy, told me that if I came home to-day without tickets for\nthe pantomime I shouldn't have any dinner allowed me. That's the way\nthey treat me. But we understand each other at home. We're all pretty\ngood friends there, thank God. And there isn't a sick chick among the\nboiling.\"\n\n\"You have many mercies for which you should indeed be thankful,\" said\nMr. Crawley, gravely.\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes; that's true. I think of that sometimes, though\nperhaps not so much as I ought to do. But the best way to be thankful\nis to use the goods the gods provide you. 'The lovely Thais sits\nbeside you. Take the goods the gods provide you.' I often say that\nto my wife, till the children have got to calling her Thais. The\nchildren have it pretty much their own way with us, Mr. Crawley.\"\n\nBy this time Mr. Crawley was almost beside himself, and was\naltogether at a loss how to bring in the matter on which he wished\nto speak. He had expected to find a man who in the hurry of London\nbusiness might perhaps just manage to spare him five minutes,--who\nwould grapple instantly with the subject that was to be discussed\nbetween them, would speak to him half-a-dozen hard words of wisdom,\nand would then dismiss him and turn on the instant to other matters\nof important business;--but here was an easy familiar fellow, who\nseemed to have nothing on earth to do, and who at this first meeting\nhad taken advantage of a distant family connexion to tell him\neverything about the affairs of his own household. And then how\npeculiar were the domestic traits which he told! What was Mr. Crawley\nto say to a man who had taught his own children to call their mother\nThais? Of Thais Mr. Crawley did know something, and he forgot to\nremember that perhaps Mr. Toogood knew less. He felt it, however, to\nbe very difficult to submit the details of his case to a gentleman\nwho talked in such a strain about his own wife and children.\n\nBut something must be done. Mr. Crawley, in his present frame of\nmind, could not sit and talk about Thais all day. \"Sir,\" he said,\n\"the picture of your home is very pleasant, and I presume that plenty\nabounds there.\"\n\n\"Well, you know, pretty toll-loll for that. With twelve of 'em, Mr.\nCrawley, I needn't tell you they are not all going to have castles\nand parks of their own, unless they can get 'em off their own bats.\nBut I pay upwards of a hundred a year each for my eldest three boys'\nschooling, and I've been paying eighty for the girls. Put that and\nthat together and see what it comes to. Educate, educate, educate;\nthat's my word.\"\n\n\"No better word can be spoken, sir.\"\n\n\"I don't think there's a girl in Tavistock Square that can beat\nPolly,--she's the eldest, called after her mother, you know;--that\ncan beat her at the piano. And Lucy has read Lord Byron and Tom Moore\nall through, every word of 'em. By Jove, I believe she knows most of\nTom Moore by heart. And the young uns are coming on just as well.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, sir, as your time is, no doubt, precious--\"\n\n\"Just at this time of the day we don't care so much about it, Mr.\nCrawley; and one doesn't catch a new cousin every day, you know.\"\n\n\"However, if you will allow me,--\"\n\n\"We'll tackle to? Very well; so be it. Now, Mr. Crawley, let me hear\nwhat it is that I can do for you.\" Of a sudden, as Mr. Toogood spoke\nthese last words, the whole tone of his voice seemed to change, and\neven the position of his body became so much altered as to indicate a\ndifferent kind of man. \"You just tell your story in your own way, and\nI won't interrupt you till you've done. That's always the best.\"\n\n\"I must first crave your attention to an unfortunate preliminary,\"\nsaid Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"I come before you in form\u00c3\u00a2 pauperis.\" Here Mr. Crawley paused and\nstood up before the attorney with his hands crossed one upon the\nother, bending low, as though calling attention to the poorness of\nhis raiment. \"I know that I have no justification for my conduct. I\nhave nothing of reason to offer why I should trespass upon your time.\nI am a poor man, and cannot pay you for your services.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother!\" said Mr. Toogood, jumping up out of his chair.\n\n\"I do not know whether your charity will grant me that which I ask--\"\n\n\"Don't let's have any more of this,\" said the attorney. \"We none of\nus like this kind of thing at all. If I can be of any service to you,\nyou're as welcome to it as flowers in May; and as for billing my\nfirst-cousin, which your wife is, I should as soon think of sending\nin an account to my own.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Toogood,--\"\n\n\"Do you go on now with your story; I'll put the rest all right.\"\n\n\"I was bound to be explicit, Mr. Toogood.\"\n\n\"Very well; now you have been explicit with a vengeance, and you may\nheave a-head. Let's hear the story, and if I can help you I will.\nWhen I've said that, you may be sure I mean it. I've heard something\nof it before; but let me hear it all from you.\"\n\nThen Mr. Crawley began and told the story. Mr. Toogood was actually\ntrue to his promise and let the narrator go on with his narrative\nwithout interruption. When Mr. Crawley came to his own statement that\nthe cheque had been paid to him by Mr. Soames, and went on to say\nthat that statement had been false,--\"I told him that, but I told\nhim so wrongly,\" and then paused, thinking that the lawyer would ask\nsome question, Mr. Toogood simply said, \"Go on; go on. I'll come back\nto all that when you've done.\" And he merely nodded his head when\nMr. Crawley spoke of his second statement, that the money had come\nfrom the dean. \"We had been bound together by close ties of early\nfamiliarity,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"and in former years our estates in\nlife were the same. But he has prospered and I have failed. And when\ncreditors were importunate, I consented to accept relief in money\nwhich had previously been often offered. And I must acknowledge,\nMr. Toogood, while saying this, that I have known,--have known with\nheartfelt agony,--that at former times my wife has taken that from\nmy friend Mr. Arabin, with hand half-hidden from me, which I have\nrefused. Whether it be better to eat--the bread of charity,--or\nnot to eat bread at all, I, for myself, have no doubt,\" he said;\n\"but when the want strikes one's wife and children, and the charity\nstrikes only oneself, then there is a doubt.\" When he spoke thus, Mr.\nToogood got up, and thrusting his hands into his waistcoat pockets\nwalked about the room, exclaiming, \"By George, by George, by George!\"\nBut he still let the man go on with his story, and heard him out at\nlast to the end.\n\n\"And they committed you for trial at the next Barchester assizes?\"\nsaid the lawyer.\n\n\"They did.\"\n\n\"And you employed no lawyer before the magistrates?\"\n\n\"None;--I refused to employ any one.\"\n\n\"You were wrong there, Mr. Crawley. I must be allowed to say that you\nwere wrong there.\"\n\n\"I may possibly have been so from your point of view, Mr. Toogood;\nbut permit me to explain. I--\"\n\n\"It's no good explaining now. Of course you must employ a lawyer for\nyour defence,--an attorney who will put the case into the hands of\ncounsel.\"\n\n\"But that I cannot do, Mr. Toogood.\"\n\n\"You must do it. If you don't do it, your friends should do it for\nyou. If you don't do it, everybody will say you're mad. There isn't\na single solicitor you could find within half a mile of you at this\nmoment who wouldn't give you the same advice,--not a single man,\neither, who has got a head on his shoulders worth a turnip.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Crawley was told that madness would be laid to his charge if\nhe did not do as he was bid, his face became very black, and assumed\nsomething of that look of determined obstinacy which it had worn when\nhe was standing in the presence of the bishop and Mrs. Proudie. \"It\nmay be so,\" he said. \"It may be as you say, Mr. Toogood. But these\nneighbours of yours, as to whose collected wisdom you speak with so\nmuch certainty, would hardly recommend me to indulge in a luxury for\nwhich I have no means of paying.\"\n\n\"Who thinks about paying under such circumstances as these?\"\n\n\"I do, Mr. Toogood.\"\n\n\"The wretchedest costermonger that comes to grief has a barrister in\na wig and gown to give him his chance of escape.\"\n\n\"But I am not a costermonger, Mr. Toogood,--though more wretched\nperhaps than any costermonger now in existence. It is my lot to have\nto endure the sufferings of poverty, and at the same time not to\nbe exempt from those feelings of honour to which poverty is seldom\nsubject. I cannot afford to call in legal assistance for which I\ncannot pay,--and I will not do it.\"\n\n\"I'll carry the case through for you. It certainly is not just my\nline of business,--but I'll see it carried through for you.\"\n\n\"Out of your own pocket?\"\n\n\"Never mind; when I say I'll do a thing, I'll do it.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Toogood; this thing you can not do. But do not suppose I am\nthe less grateful.\"\n\n\"What is it I can do then? Why do you come to me if you won't take my\nadvice?\"\n\nAfter this the conversation went on for a considerable time without\ntouching on any point which need be brought palpably before the\nreader's eye. The attorney continued to beg the clergyman to have his\ncase managed in the usual way, and went so far as to tell him that\nhe would be ill-treating his wife and family if he continued to be\nobstinate. But the clergyman was not shaken from his resolve, and was\nat last able to ask Mr. Toogood what he had better do,--how he had\nbetter attempt to defend himself,--on the understanding that no legal\naid was to be employed. When this question was at last asked in such\na way as to demand an answer, Mr. Toogood sat for a moment or two in\nsilence. He felt that an answer was not only demanded, but almost\nenforced; and yet there might be much difficulty in giving it.\n\n\"Mr. Toogood,\" said Mr. Crawley, seeing the attorney's hesitation, \"I\ndeclare to you before God, that my only object will be to enable the\njury to know about this sad matter all that I know myself. If I could\nopen my breast to them I should be satisfied. But then a prisoner can\nsay nothing; and what he does say is ever accounted false.\"\n\n\"That is why you should have legal assistance.\"\n\n\"We had already come to a conclusion on that matter, as I thought,\"\nsaid Mr. Crawley.\n\nMr. Toogood paused for another moment or two, and then dashed at his\nanswer; or rather, dashed at a counter question. \"Mr. Crawley, where\ndid you get the cheque? You must pardon me, you know; or, if you wish\nit, I will not press the question. But so much hangs on that, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Every thing would hang on it,--if I only knew.\"\n\n\"You mean that you forget?\"\n\n\"Absolutely; totally. I wish, Mr. Toogood, I could explain to you the\ntoilsome perseverance with which I have cudgelled my poor brains,\nendeavouring to extract from them some scintilla of memory that would\naid me.\"\n\n\"Could you have picked it up in the house?\"\n\n\"No;--no; that I did not do. Dull as I am, I know so much. It was\nmine of right, from whatever source it came to me. I know myself as\nno one else can know me, in spite of the wise man's motto. Had I\npicked up a cheque in my house, or on the road, I should not have\nslept till I had taken steps to restore it to the seeming owner. So\nmuch I can say. But, otherwise, I am in such matters so shandy-pated,\nthat I can trust myself to be sure of nothing. I thought;--I\ncertainly thought--\"\n\n\"You thought what?\"\n\n\"I thought that it had been given to me by my friend the dean. I\nremember well that I was in his library at Barchester, and I was\nsomewhat provoked in spirit. There were lying on the floor hundreds\nof volumes, all glittering with gold, and reeking with new leather\nfrom the binders. He asked me to look at his toys. Why should I look\nat them? There was a time, but the other day it seemed, when he had\nbeen glad to borrow from me such treasures as I had. And it seemed to\nme that he was heartless in showing me these things. Well; I need not\ntrouble you with all that.\"\n\n\"Go on;--go on. Let me hear it all, and I shall learn something.\"\n\n\"I know now how vain, how vile I was. I always know afterwards how\nlow the spirit has grovelled. I had gone to him then because I\nhad resolved to humble myself, and, for my wife's sake, to ask my\nfriend--for money. With words which were very awkward,--which no\ndoubt were ungracious--I had asked him, and he had bid me follow\nhim from his hall into his library. There he left me awhile, and on\nreturning told me with a smile that he had sent for money,--and, if\nI can remember, the sum he named was fifty pounds.\"\n\n\"But it has turned out, as you say, that you have paid fifty pounds\nwith his money,--besides the cheque.\"\n\n\"That is true;--that is quite true. There is no doubt of that. But\nas I was saying,--then he fell to talking about the books, and I was\nangered. I was very sore in my heart. From the moment in which the\nwords of beggary had passed from my lips, I had repented. And he had\nlaughed and had taken it gaily. I turned upon him and told him that I\nhad changed my mind. I was grateful, but I would not have his money.\nAnd so I prepared to go. But he argued with me, and would not let me\ngo,--telling me of my wife and of my children, and while he argued\nthere came a knock at the door, and something was handed in, and I\nknew that it was the hand of his wife.\"\n\n\"It was the money, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Toogood; it was the money. And I became the more uneasy,\nbecause she herself is rich. I liked it the less because it seemed to\ncome from her hand. But I took it. What could I do when he reminded\nme that I could not keep my parish unless certain sums were paid?\nHe gave me a little parcel in a cover, and I took it,--and left him\nsorrowing. I had never before come quite to that;--though, indeed, it\nhad in fact been often so before. What was the difference whether the\nalms were given into my hands or into my wife's?\"\n\n\"You are too touchy about it all, Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"Of course I am. Do you try it, and see whether you will be touchy.\nYou have worked hard at your profession, I daresay.\"\n\n\"Well, yes; pretty well. To tell the truth, I have worked hard. By\nGeorge, yes! It's not so bad now as it used to be.\"\n\n\"But you have always earned your bread; bread for yourself, and bread\nfor your wife and little ones. You can buy tickets for the play.\"\n\n\"I couldn't always buy tickets, mind you.\"\n\n\"I have worked as hard, and yet I cannot get bread. I am older than\nyou, and I cannot earn my bare bread. Look at my clothes. If you had\nto go and beg from Mr. Crump, would not you be touchy?\"\n\n\"As it happens, Crump isn't so well off as I am.\"\n\n\"Never mind. But I took it, and went home, and for two days I did not\nlook at it. And then there came an illness upon me, and I know not\nwhat passed. But two men who had been hard on me came to the house\nwhen I was out, and my wife was in a terrible state; and I gave her\nthe money, and she went into Silverbridge and paid them.\"\n\n\"And this cheque was with what you gave her?\"\n\n\"No; I gave her money in notes,--just fifty pounds. When I gave\nit her, I thought I gave it all; and yet afterwards I thought I\nremembered that in my illness I had found the cheque with the dean's\nmoney. But it was not so.\"\n\n\"You are sure of that?\"\n\n\"He has said that he put five notes of \u00c2\u00a310 each into the cover, and\nsuch notes I certainly gave to my wife.\"\n\n\"Where then did you get the cheque?\" Mr. Crawley again paused\nbefore he answered. \"Surely, if you will exert your mind, you will\nremember,\" said the lawyer. \"Where did you get the cheque?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\nMr. Toogood threw himself back in his chair, took his knee up into\nhis lap to nurse it, and began to think of it. He sat thinking of it\nfor some minutes without a word,--perhaps for five minutes, though\nthe time seemed to be much longer to Mr. Crawley, who was, however,\ndetermined that he would not interrupt him. And Mr. Toogood's\nthoughts were at variance with Mr. Toogood's former words. Perhaps,\nafter all, this scheme of Mr. Crawley's,--or rather the mode of\ndefence on which he had resolved without any scheme,--might be the\nbest of which the case admitted. It might be well that he should go\ninto court without a lawyer. \"He has convinced me of his innocence,\"\nMr. Toogood said to himself, \"and why should he not convince a\njury? He has convinced me, not because I am specially soft, or\nbecause I love the man,--for as to that I dislike him rather than\notherwise;--but because there is either real truth in his words,\nor else so well-feigned a show of truth that no jury can tell the\ndifference. I think it is true. By George, I think he did get the\ntwenty pounds honestly, and that he does not this moment know where\nhe got it. He may have put his finger into my eye; but, if so, why\nnot also into the eyes of a jury?\" Then he released his leg, and\nspoke something of his thoughts aloud. \"It's a sad story,\" he said;\n\"a very sad story.\"\n\n\"Well, yes, it's sad enough. If you could see my house, you'd say\nso.\"\n\n\"I haven't a doubt but what you're as innocent as I am.\" Mr. Toogood,\nas he said this, felt a little twinge of conscience. He did believe\nMr. Crawley to be innocent, but he was not so sure of it as his words\nwould seem to imply. Nevertheless he repeated the words again;--\"as\ninnocent as I am.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Mr. Crawley. \"I don't know. I think I am; but I\ndon't know.\"\n\n\"I believe you are. But you see the case is a very distressing one.\nA jury has a right to say that the man in possession of a cheque\nfor twenty pounds should account for his possession of it. If I\nunderstand the story aright, Mr. Soames will be able to prove that he\nbrought the cheque into your house, and, as far as he knows, never\ntook it out again.\"\n\n\"I suppose so; all the same, if he brought it in, then did he also\ntake it out again.\"\n\n\"I am saying what he will prove,--or, in other words, what he will\nstate upon oath. You can't contradict him. You can't get into the box\nto do it,--even if that would be of any avail; and I am glad that you\ncannot, as it would be of no avail. And you can put no one else into\nthe box who can do so.\"\n\n\"No; no.\"\n\n\"That is to say, we think you cannot do so. People can do so many\nthings that they don't think they can do; and can't do so many things\nthat they think that they can do! When will the dean be home?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Before the trial?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I have no idea.\"\n\n\"It's almost a toss-up whether he'd do more harm or good if he were\nthere.\"\n\n\"I wish he might be there if he has anything to say, whether it might\nbe for harm or good.\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Arabin;--she is with him?\"\n\n\"They tell me she is not. She is in Europe. He is in Palestine.\"\n\n\"In Palestine, is he?\"\n\n\"So they tell me. A dean can go where he likes. He has no cure of\nsouls to stand in the way of his pleasures.\"\n\n\"He hasn't,--hasn't he? I wish I were a dean; that is, if I were not\na lawyer. Might I write a line to the dean,--and to Mrs. Dean, if\nit seemed fit? You wouldn't mind that? As you have come to see your\ncousin at last,--and very glad I am that you have,--you must leave\nhim a little discretion. I won't say anything I oughtn't to say.\" Mr.\nCrawley opposed this scheme for some time, but at last consented to\nthe proposition. \"And I'll tell you what, Mr. Crawley; I am very fond\nof cathedrals, I am indeed; and I have long wanted to see Barchester.\nThere's a very fine what-you-may-call-em; isn't there? Well; I'll\njust run down at the assizes. We have nothing to do in London when\nthe judges are in the country,--of course.\" Mr. Toogood looked into\nMr. Crawley's eyes as he said this, to see if his iniquity were\ndetected, but the perpetual curate was altogether innocent in these\nmatters. \"Yes; I'll just run down for a mouthful of fresh air. Of\ncourse I shan't open my mouth in court. But I might say one word\nto the dean, if he's there;--and one word to Mr. Soames. Who is\nconducting the prosecution?\" Mr. Crawley said that Mr. Walker was\ndoing so. \"Walker, Walker, Walker? oh,--yes; Walker and Winthrop,\nisn't it? A decent sort of man, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I have heard nothing to his discredit, Mr. Toogood.\"\n\n\"And that's saying a great deal for a lawyer. Well, Mr. Crawley, if\nnothing else comes out between this and that,--nothing, that is, that\nshall clear your memory about that unfortunate bit of paper, you must\nsimply tell your story to the jury as you've told it to me. I don't\nthink any twelve men in England would convict you;--I don't indeed.\"\n\n\"You think they would not?\"\n\n\"Of course I've only heard one side, Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"No,--no,--no, that is true.\"\n\n\"But judging as well as I can judge from one side, I don't think a\njury can convict you. At any rate I'll see you at Barchester, and\nI'll write a line or two before the trial, just to find out anything\nthat can be found out. And you're sure you won't come and take a bit\nof mutton with us in the Square? The girls would be delighted to see\nyou, and so would Maria.\" Mr. Crawley said that he was quite sure\nhe could not do that, and then having tendered reiterated thanks\nto his new friend in words which were touching in spite of their\nold-fashioned gravity, he took his leave, and walked back again to\nthe public-house at Paddington.\n\nHe returned home to Hogglestock on the same afternoon, reaching that\nplace at nine in the evening. During the whole of the day after\nleaving Raymond's Buildings he was thinking of the lawyer, and of the\nwords which the lawyer had spoken. Although he had been disposed to\nquarrel with Mr. Toogood on many points, although he had been more\nthan once disgusted by the attorney's bad taste, shocked by his low\nmorality, and almost insulted by his easy familiarity, still, when\nthe interview was over, he liked the attorney. When first Mr. Toogood\nhad begun to talk, he regretted very much that he had subjected\nhimself to the necessity of discussing his private affairs with\nsuch a windbag of a man; but when he left the chamber he trusted Mr.\nToogood altogether, and was very glad that he had sought his aid. He\nwas tired and exhausted when he reached home, as he had eaten nothing\nbut a biscuit or two since his breakfast; but his wife got him food\nand tea, and then asked him as to his success. \"Was my cousin kind to\nyou?\"\n\n\"Very kind,--more than kind,--perhaps somewhat too pressing in his\nkindness. But I find no fault. God forbid that I should. He is, I\nthink, a good man, and certainly has been good to me.\"\n\n\"And what is to be done?\"\n\n\"He will write to the dean.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that.\"\n\n\"And he will be at Barchester.\"\n\n\"Thank God for that.\"\n\n\"But not as my lawyer.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, I thank God that some one will be there who will know\nhow to give you assistance and advice.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nTHE PLUMSTEAD FOXES.\n\n\nThe letters had been brought into the breakfast-parlour at Plumstead\nRectory one morning, and the archdeacon had inspected them all, and\nthen thrown over to his wife her share of the spoil,--as was the\ncustom of the house. As to most of Mrs. Grantly's letters, he never\nmade any further inquiry. To letters from her sister, the dean's\nwife, he was profoundly indifferent, and rarely made any inquiry\nas to those which were directed in writing with which he was not\nfamiliar. But there were others as to which, as Mrs. Grantly knew, he\nwould be sure to ask her questions if she did not show them. No note\never reached her from Lady Hartletop as to which he was not curious,\nand yet Lady Hartletop's notes very seldom contained much that was\nof interest. Now, on this morning, there came a letter which, as\na matter of course, Mrs. Grantly read at breakfast, and which,\nshe knew, would not be allowed to disappear without inquiry. Nor,\nindeed, did she wish to keep the letter from her husband. It was\ntoo important to be so treated. But she would have been glad to\ngain time to think in what spirit she would discuss the contents\nof the letter,--if only such time might be allowed to her. But the\narchdeacon would allow her no time. \"What does Henry say, my dear?\"\nhe asked, before the breakfast things had been taken away.\n\n\"What does he say? Well; he says--. I'll give you his letter to read\nby-and-by.\"\n\n\"And why not now?\"\n\n\"I thought I'd read it again myself, first.\"\n\n\"But if you have read it, I suppose you know what's in it?\"\n\n\"Not very clearly, as yet. However, there it is.\" She knew very well\nthat when she had once been asked for it, no peace would be allowed\nto her till he had seen it. And, alas! there was not much probability\nof peace in the house for some time after he should see it.\n\nThe archdeacon read the three or four first lines in silence,--and\nthen he burst out. \"He has, has he? Then, by heavens--\"\n\n\"Stop, dearest; stop,\" said his wife, rising from her chair and\ncoming over to him; \"do not say words which you will surely repent.\"\n\n\"I will say words which shall make him repent. He shall never have\nfrom me a son's portion.\"\n\n\"Do not make threats in anger. Do not! You know that it is wrong. If\nhe has offended you, say nothing about it,--even to yourself,--as to\nthreatened punishments, till you can judge of the offence in cool\nblood.\"\n\n\"I am cool,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"No, my dear; no; you are angry. And you have not even read his\nletter through.\"\n\n\"I will read his letter.\"\n\n\"You will see that the marriage is not imminent. It may be that even\nyet it will never take place. The young lady has refused him.\"\n\n\"Psha!\"\n\n\"You will see that she has done so. He tells us so himself. And she\nhas behaved very properly.\"\n\n\"Why has she refused him?\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt about the reason. She feels that, with this\ncharge hanging over her father, she is not in a position to become\nthe wife of any gentleman. You cannot but respect her for that.\"\n\nThen the archdeacon finished his son's letter, uttering sundry\ninterjections and ejaculations as he did so.\n\n\"Of course; I knew it. I understood it all,\" he said at last. \"I've\nnothing to do with the girl. I don't care whether she be good or\nbad.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\"\n\n\"I care not at all,--with reference to my own concerns. Of course\nI would wish that the daughter of a neighbouring clergyman,--that\nthe daughter of any neighbour,--that the daughter of any one\nwhatsoever,--should be good rather than bad. But as regards Henry and\nme, and our mutual relation, her goodness can make no difference. Let\nher be another Grizel, and still such a marriage must estrange him\nfrom me, and me from him.\"\n\n\"But she has refused him.\"\n\n\"Yes; and what does he say?--that he has told her that he will not\naccept her refusal. Of course we know what it all means. The girl\nI am not judging. The girl I will not judge. But my own son, to\nwhom I have ever done a father's duty with a father's affectionate\nindulgence,--him I will judge. I have warned him, and he declares\nhimself to be careless of my warning. I shall take no notice of this\nletter. I shall neither write to him about it, or speak to him about\nit. But I charge you to write to him, and tell him that if he does\nthis thing he shall not have a child's portion from me. It is not\nthat I will shorten that which would have been his; but he shall\nhave--nothing!\" Then, having spoken these words with a solemnity\nwhich for the moment silenced his wife, he got up and left the\nroom. He left the room and closed the door, but, before he had gone\nhalf the length of the hall towards his own study, he returned and\naddressed his wife again. \"You understand my instructions, I hope?\"\n\n\"What instructions?\"\n\n\"That you write to Henry and tell him what I say.\"\n\n\"I will speak again to you about it by-and-by.\"\n\n\"I will speak no more about it,--not a word more. Let there be not a\nword more said, but oblige me by doing as I ask you.\"\n\nThen he was again about to leave the room, but she stopped him. \"Wait\na moment, my dear.\"\n\n\"Why should I wait?\"\n\n\"That you may listen to me. Surely you will do that, when I ask you.\nI will write to Henry, of course, if you bid me; and I will give him\nyour message, whatever it may be; but not to-day, my dear.\"\n\n\"Why not to-day?\"\n\n\"Because the sun shall go down upon your wrath before I become its\nmessenger. If you choose to write to-day yourself, I cannot help it.\nI cannot hinder you. If I am to write to him on your behalf I will\ntake my instructions from you to-morrow morning. When to-morrow\nmorning comes you will not be angry with me because of the delay.\"\n\nThe archdeacon was by no means satisfied; but he knew his wife too\nwell, and himself too well, and the world too well, to insist on the\nimmediate gratification of his passion. Over his bosom's mistress\nhe did exercise a certain marital control,--which was, for instance,\nquite sufficiently fixed to enable him to look down with thorough\ncontempt on such a one as Bishop Proudie; but he was not a despot who\ncould exact a passive obedience to every fantasy. His wife would not\nhave written the letter for him on that day, and he knew very well\nthat she would not do so. He knew also that she was right;--and yet\nhe regretted his want of power. His anger at the present moment was\nvery hot,--so hot that he wished to wreak it. He knew that it would\ncool before the morrow;--and, no doubt, knew also theoretically, that\nit would be most fitting that it should cool. But not the less was\nit a matter of regret to him that so much good hot anger should\nbe wasted, and that he could not have his will of his disobedient\nson while it lasted. He might, no doubt, have written himself,\nbut to have done so would not have suited him. Even in his anger\nhe could not have written to his son without using the ordinary\nterms of affection, and in his anger he could not bring himself to\nuse those terms. \"You will find that I shall be of the same mind\nto-morrow,--exactly,\" he said to his wife. \"I have resolved about it\nlong since; and it is not likely that I shall change in a day.\" Then\nhe went out, about his parish, intending to continue to think of his\nson's iniquity, so that he might keep his anger hot,--red hot. Then\nhe remembered that the evening would come, and that he would say his\nprayers; and he shook his head in regret,--in a regret of which he\nwas only half conscious, though it was very keen, and which he did\nnot attempt to analyze,--as he reflected that his rage would hardly\nbe able to survive that ordeal. How common with us it is to repine\nthat the devil is not stronger over us than he is.\n\nThe archdeacon, who was a very wealthy man, had purchased a property\nin Plumstead, contiguous to the glebe-land, and had thus come to\nexercise in the parish the double duty of rector and squire. And\nof this estate in Barsetshire, which extended beyond the confines\nof Plumstead into the neighbouring parish of Eiderdown, and which\ncomprised also an outlying farm in the parish of Stogpingum,--Stoke\nPinguium would have been the proper name had not barbarous Saxon\ntongues clipped it of its proper proportions,--he had always intended\nthat his son Henry should enjoy the inheritance. There was other\nproperty, both in land and in money, for his elder son, and other\nagain for the maintenance of his wife,--for the archdeacon's father\nhad been for many years Bishop of Barchester, and such a bishopric\nas that of Barchester had been in those days was worth money. Of\nhis intention in this respect he had never spoken in plain language\nto either of his sons; but the major had for the last year or two\nenjoyed the shooting of the Barsetshire covers, giving what orders\nhe pleased about the game; and the father had encouraged him to\ntake something like the management of the property into his hands.\nThere might be some fifteen hundred acres of it altogether, and the\narchdeacon had rejoiced over it with his wife scores of times, saying\nthat there was many a squire in the county whose elder son would\nnever find himself half so well placed as would his own younger son.\nNow there was a string of narrow woods called Plumstead Coppices\nwhich ran from a point near the church right across the parish,\ndividing the archdeacon's land from the Ullathorne estate, and these\ncoppices, or belts of woodland, belonged to the archdeacon. On the\nmorning of which we are speaking, the archdeacon, mounted on his cob,\nstill thinking of his son's iniquity and of his own fixed resolve to\npunish him as he had said that he would punish him, opened with his\nwhip a woodland gate, from which a green muddy lane led through the\ntrees up to the house of his gamekeeper. The man's wife was ill, and\nin his ordinary way of business the archdeacon was about to call and\nask after her health. At the door of the cottage he found the man,\nwho was woodman as well as gamekeeper, and was responsible for fences\nand faggots, as well as for foxes and pheasants' eggs.\n\n\"How's Martha, Flurry?\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"Thanking your reverence, she be a deal improved since the mistress\nwas here,--last Tuesday it was, I think.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that. It was only rheumatism, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Just a tich of fever with it, your reverence, the doctor said.\"\n\n\"Tell her I was asking after it. I won't mind getting down to-day, as\nI am rather busy. She has had what she wanted from the house?\"\n\n\"The mistress has been very good in that way. She always is, God\nbless her!\"\n\n\"Good-day to you, Flurry. I'll ask Mr. Sims to come and read to her\na bit this afternoon, or to-morrow morning.\" The archdeacon kept two\ncurates, and Mr. Sims was one of them.\n\n\"She'll take it very kindly, your reverence. But while you are here,\nsir, there's just a word I'd like to say. I didn't happen to catch\nMr. Henry when he was here the other day.\"\n\n\"Never mind Mr. Henry; what is it you have to say?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Never mind Mr. Henry.\"]\n\n\"I do think, I do indeed, sir, that Mr. Thorne's man ain't dealing\nfairly along of the foxes. I wouldn't say a word about it, only that\nMr. Henry is so particular.\"\n\n\"What about the foxes? What is he doing with the foxes?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, he's a trapping on 'em. He is, indeed, your reverence. I\nwouldn't speak if I warn't well nigh mortial sure.\"\n\nNow the archdeacon had never been a hunting man, though in his early\ndays many a clergyman had been in the habit of hunting without\nlosing his clerical character by doing so; but he had lived all\nhis life among gentlemen in a hunting county, and had his own very\nstrong ideas about the trapping of foxes. Foxes first, and pheasants\nafterwards, had always been the rule with him as to any land of which\nhe himself had had the management. And no man understood better than\nhe did how to deal with keepers as to this matter of fox-preserving,\nor knew better that keepers will in truth obey not the words of their\nemployers, but their sympathies. \"Wish them to have foxes, and pay\nthem, and they will have them,\" Mr. Sowerby of Chaldicotes used to\nsay, and he in his day was reckoned to be the best preserver of foxes\nin Barsetshire. \"Tell them to have them, and don't wish it, and pay\nthem well, and you won't have a fox to interfere with your game.\nI don't care what a man says to me, I can read it all like a book\nwhen I see his covers drawn.\" That was what poor Mr. Sowerby of\nChaldicotes used to say, and the archdeacon had heard him say it a\nscore of times, and had learned the lesson. But now his heart was not\nwith the foxes,--and especially not with the foxes on behalf of his\nson Henry. \"I can't have any meddling with Mr. Thorne,\" he said; \"I\ncan't, and I won't.\"\n\n\"But I don't suppose it can be Mr. Thorne's order, your reverence;\nand Mr. Henry is so particular.\"\n\n\"Of course it isn't Mr. Thorne's order. Mr. Thorne has been a hunting\nman all his life.\"\n\n\"But he have guv' up now, your reverence. He ain't a hunted these two\nyears.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he wouldn't have the foxes trapped.\"\n\n\"Not if he knowed it, he wouldn't, your reverence. A gentleman of\nthe likes of him, who's been a hunting over fifty year, wouldn't do\nthe likes of that; but the foxes is trapped, and Mr. Henry 'll be a\nputting it on me if I don't speak out. They is Plumstead foxes, too;\nand a vixen was trapped just across the field yonder, in Goshall\nSprings, no later than yesterday morning.\" Flurry was now thoroughly\nin earnest; and, indeed, the trapping of a vixen in February is a\nserious thing.\n\n\"Goshall Springs don't belong to me,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"No, your reverence; they're on the Ullathorne property. But a word\nfrom your reverence would do it. Mr. Henry thinks more of the foxes\nthan anything. The last word he told me was that it would break his\nheart if he saw the coppices drawn blank.\"\n\n\"Then he must break his heart.\" The words were pronounced, but the\narchdeacon had so much command over himself as to speak them in such\na voice that the man should not hear them. But it was incumbent\non him to say something that the man should hear. \"I will have no\nmeddling in the matter, Flurry. Whether there are foxes or whether\nthere are not, is matter of no great moment. I will not have a word\nsaid to annoy Mr. Thorne.\" Then he rode away, back through the wood\nand out on to the road, and the horse walked with him leisurely on,\nwhither the archdeacon hardly knew,--for he was thinking, thinking,\nthinking. \"Well;--if that ain't the darn'dest thing that ever was,\"\nsaid Flurry; \"but I'll tell the squire about Thorne's man,--darned if\nI don't.\" Now \"the squire\" was young Squire Gresham, the master of\nthe East Barsetshire hounds.\n\nBut the archdeacon went on thinking, thinking, thinking. He could\nhave heard nothing of his son to stir him more in his favour than\nthis strong evidence of his partiality for foxes. I do not mean it\nto be understood that the archdeacon regarded foxes as better than\nactive charity, or a contented mind, or a meek spirit, or than\nself-denying temperance. No doubt all these virtues did hold in his\nmind their proper places, altogether beyond contamination of foxes.\nBut he had prided himself on thinking that his son should be a\ncountry gentleman, and, probably nothing doubting as to the major's\nactive charity and other virtues, was delighted to receive evidence\nof those tastes which he had ever wished to encourage in his son's\ncharacter. Or rather, such evidence would have delighted him at any\nother time than the present. Now it only added more gall to his cup.\n\"Why should he teach himself to care for such things, when he has not\nthe spirit to enjoy them,\" said the archdeacon to himself. \"He is a\nfool,--a fool. A man that has been married once, to go crazy after a\nlittle girl, that has hardly a dress to her back, and who never was\nin a drawing-room in her life! Charles is the eldest, and he shall be\nthe eldest. It will be better to keep it together. It is the way in\nwhich the country has become what it is.\" He was out nearly all day,\nand did not see his wife till dinner-time. Her father, Mr. Harding,\nwas still with them, but had breakfasted in his own room. Not a word,\ntherefore, was said about Henry Grantly between the father and mother\non that evening.\n\nMrs. Grantly was determined that, unless provoked, she would say\nnothing to him till the following morning. He should sleep upon his\nwrath before she spoke to him again. And he was equally unwilling to\nrecur to the subject. Had she permitted it, the next morning would\nhave passed away, and no word would have been spoken. But this\nwould not have suited her. She had his orders to write, and she had\nundertaken to obey these orders,--with the delay of one day. Were\nshe not to write at all,--or in writing to send no message from the\nfather, there would be cause for further anger. And yet this, I\nthink, was what the archdeacon wished.\n\n\"Archdeacon,\" she said, \"I shall write to Henry to-day.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\n\"And what am I to say from you?\"\n\n\"I told you yesterday what are my intentions.\"\n\n\"I am not asking about that now. We hope there will be years and\nyears to come, in which you may change them, and shape them as you\nwill. What shall I tell him now from you?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say to him,--nothing; not a word. He knows what\nhe has to expect from me, for I have told him. He is acting with his\neyes open, and so am I. If he marries Miss Crawley, he must live on\nhis own means. I told him that myself so plainly, that he can want\nno further intimation.\" Then Mrs. Grantly knew that she was absolved\nfrom the burden of yesterday's message, and she plumed herself on the\nprudence of her conduct. On the same morning the archdeacon wrote the\nfollowing note:--\n\n\n   DEAR THORNE,--\n\n   My man tells me that foxes have been trapped on Darvell's\n   farm, just outside the coppices. I know nothing of it\n   myself, but I am sure you'll look to it.\n\n   Yours always,\n\n   T. GRANTLY.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nMRS. PROUDIE SENDS FOR HER LAWYER.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThere was great dismay in Barchester Palace after the visit paid\nto the bishop and Mrs. Proudie by that terrible clerical offender,\nMr. Crawley. It will be remembered, perhaps, how he had defied the\nbishop with spoken words, and how he had defied the bishop's wife by\nspeaking no words to her. For the moment, no doubt, Mr. Crawley had\nthe best of it. Mrs. Proudie acknowledged to herself that this was\nthe case; but as she was a woman who had never yet succumbed to an\nenemy, who had never,--if on such an occasion I may be allowed to use\na schoolboy's slang,--taken a licking from any one, it was not likely\nthat Mr. Crawley would be long allowed to enjoy his triumph in peace.\nIt would be odd if all the weight of the palace would not be able to\nsilence a wretch of a perpetual curate who had already been committed\nto take his trial for thieving;--and Mrs. Proudie was determined\nthat all the weight of the palace should be used. As for the bishop,\nthough he was not as angry as his wife, he was quite as unhappy, and\ntherefore quite as hostile to Mr. Crawley; and was fully conscious\nthat there could be no peace for him now until Mr. Crawley should\nbe crushed. If only the assizes would come at once, and get him\ncondemned out of the way, what a blessed thing it would be! But\nunluckily it still wanted three months to the assizes, and during\nthose three months Mr. Crawley would be at large and subject only to\nepiscopal authority. During that time he could not be silenced by the\narm of the civil law. His wife was not long in expressing her opinion\nafter Mr. Crawley had left the palace. \"You must proceed against him\nin the Court of Arches,--and that at once,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"You\ncan do that, of course? I know that it will be expensive. Of course\nit will be expensive. I suppose it may cost us some hundreds of\npounds; but duty is duty, my lord, and in such a case as this your\nduty as a bishop is paramount.\"\n\nThe poor bishop knew that it was useless to explain to her the\nvarious mistakes which she made,--which she was ever making,--as to\nthe extent of his powers and the modes of procedure which were open\nto him. When he would do so she would only rail at him for being\nlukewarm in his office, poor in spirit, and afraid of dealing roundly\nwith those below him. On the present occasion he did say a word, but\nshe would not even hear him to the end. \"Don't tell me about rural\ndeans, as if I didn't know. The rural dean has nothing to do with\nsuch a case. The man has been committed for trial. Send for Mr.\nChadwick at once, and let steps be taken before you are an hour\nolder.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, Mr. Chadwick can do nothing.\"\n\n\"Then I will see Mr. Chadwick.\" And in her anger she did sit down and\nwrite a note to Mr. Chadwick, begging him to come over to her at the\npalace.\n\nMr. Chadwick was a lawyer, living in Barchester, who earned his bread\nfrom ecclesiastical business. His father, and his uncle, and his\ngrandfather and granduncles, had all been concerned in the affairs\nof the diocese of Barchester. His uncle had been bailiff to the\nepiscopal estates, or steward as he had been called, in Bishop\nGrantly's time, and still contrived to draw his income in some shape\nfrom the property of the see. The nephew had also been the legal\nassistant of the bishop in his latter days, and had been continued in\nthat position by Bishop Proudie, not from love, but from expediency.\nMr. John Chadwick was one of those gentlemen, two or three of\nwhom are to be seen in connection with every see,--who seem to be\nhybrids--half-lay, half-cleric. They dress like clergymen, and affect\nthat mixture of clerical solemnity and clerical waggishness which\nis generally to be found among minor canons and vicar chorals of a\ncathedral. They live, or at least have their offices, half in the\nClose and half out of it,--dwelling as it were just on the borders\nof holy orders. They always wear white neck-handkerchiefs and black\ngloves; and would be altogether clerical in their appearance, were\nit not that as regards the outward man they impinge somewhat on the\ncharacteristics of the undertaker. They savour of the church, but\nthe savour is of the church's exterior. Any stranger thrown into\nchance contact with one of them would, from instinct, begin to talk\nof things ecclesiastical without any reference to things theological\nor things religious. They are always most worthy men, much respected\nin the society of the Close, and I never heard of one of them\nwhose wife was not comfortable or whose children were left without\nprovision.\n\nSuch a one was Mr. John Chadwick, and as it was a portion of his\nduties to accompany the bishop to consecrations and ordinations, he\nknew Dr. Proudie very well. Having been brought up, as it were, under\nthe very wing of Bishop Grantly, it could not well be that he should\nlove Bishop Grantly's successor. The old bishop and the new bishop\nhad been so different that no man could like, or even esteem, them\nboth. But Mr. Chadwick was a prudent man, who knew well the source\nfrom which he earned his bread, and he had never quarrelled with\nBishop Proudie. He knew Mrs. Proudie also,--of necessity,--and when I\nsay of him that he had hitherto avoided any open quarrel with her, it\nwill I think be allowed that he was a man of prudence and sagacity.\n\nBut he had sometimes been sorely tried, and he felt when he got\nher note that he was now about to encounter a very sore trial. He\nmuttered something which might have been taken for an oath, were it\nnot that the outward signs of the man gave warranty that no oath\ncould proceed from such a one. Then he wrote a short note presenting\nhis compliments to Mrs. Proudie, and saying that he would call at the\npalace at eleven o'clock on the following morning.\n\nBut, in the meantime, Mrs. Proudie, who could not be silent on\nthe subject for a moment, did learn something of the truth from\nher husband. The information did not come to her in the way of\ninstruction, but was teased out of the unfortunate man. \"I know that\nyou can proceed against him in the Court of Arches, under the 'Church\nDiscipline Act,'\" she said.\n\n\"No, my dear; no;\" said the bishop, shaking his head in his misery.\n\n\"Or in the Consistorial Court. It's all the same thing.\"\n\n\"There must be an inquiry first,--by his brother clergy. There must\nindeed. It's the only way of proceeding.\"\n\n\"But there has been an inquiry, and he has been committed.\"\n\n\"That doesn't signify, my dear. That's the Civil Law.\"\n\n\"And if the Civil Law condemns him, and locks him up in prison;--as\nit most certainly will do?\"\n\n\"But it hasn't done so yet, my dear. I really think that as it has\ngone so far, it will be best to leave it as it is till he has taken\nhis trial.\"\n\n\"What; leave him there after what occurred this morning in this\npalace?\" The palace with Mrs. Proudie was always a palace, and never\na house. \"No; no; ten thousand times, no. Are you not aware that he\ninsulted you, and grossly, most grossly insulted me? I was never\ntreated with such insolence by any clergyman before, since I first\ncame to this palace;--never, never. And we know the man to be a\nthief;--we absolutely know it. Think, my lord, of the souls of his\npeople!\"\n\n\"Oh, dear; oh, dear; oh, dear,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"Why do you fret yourself in that way?\"\n\n\"Because you will get me into trouble. I tell you the only thing to\nbe done is to issue a commission with the rural dean at the head of\nit.\"\n\n\"Then issue a commission.\"\n\n\"And they will take three months.\"\n\n\"Why should they take three months? Why should they take more than\nthree days,--or three hours? It is all plain sailing.\"\n\n\"These things are never plain sailing, my dear. When a bishop has\nto oppose any of his clergy, it is always made as difficult as\npossible.\"\n\n\"More shame for them who make it so.\"\n\n\"But it is so. If I were to take legal proceedings against him, it\nwould cost,--oh, dear,--more than a thousand pounds, I should say.\"\n\n\"If it costs two, you must do it.\" Mrs. Proudie's anger was still\nvery hot, or she would not have spoken of an unremunerative outlay of\nmoney in such language as that.\n\nIn this manner she did come to understand, before the arrival of\nMr. Chadwick, that her husband could take no legal steps towards\nsilencing Mr. Crawley until a commission of clergymen had been\nappointed to inquire into the matter, and that that commission\nshould be headed by the rural dean within the limits of whose rural\ndeanery the parish of Hogglestock was situated, or by some beneficed\nparochial clergyman of repute in the neighbourhood. Now the rural\ndean was Dr. Tempest of Silverbridge,--who had held that position\nbefore the coming of Dr. Proudie to the diocese; and there had grown\nup in the bosom of Mrs. Proudie a strong feeling that undue mercy\nhad been shown to Mr. Crawley by the magistrates of Silverbridge, of\nwhom Dr. Tempest had been one. \"These magistrates had taken bail for\nhis appearance at the assizes, instead of committing him to prison\nat once,--as they were bound to do, when such an offence as that\nhad been committed by a clergyman. But, no;--even though there was\na clergyman among them, they had thought nothing of the souls of\nthe poor people!\" In such language Mrs. Proudie had spoken of the\naffair at Silverbridge, and having once committed herself to such an\nopinion, of course she thought that Dr. Tempest would go through fire\nand water,--would omit no stretch of what little judicial power might\nbe committed to his hands,--with the view of opposing his bishop and\nmaintaining the culprit in his position. \"In such a case as this, can\nnot you name an acting rural dean yourself? Dr. Tempest, you know, is\nvery old.\" \"No, my dear; no; I cannot.\" \"You can ask Mr. Chadwick,\nat any rate, and then you could name Mr. Thumble.\" \"But Mr. Thumble\ndoesn't even hold a living in the diocese. Oh, dear; oh, dear; oh,\ndear!\" And so the matter rested until Mr. Chadwick came.\n\nMrs. Proudie had no doubt intended to have Mr. Chadwick all to\nherself,--at any rate so to encounter him in the first instance. But\nhaving been at length convinced that the inquiry by the rural dean\nwas really necessary as a preliminary, and having also slept upon the\nquestion of expenditure, she gave directions that the lawyer should\nbe shown into the bishop's study, and she took care to be absent\nat the moment of his arrival. Of course she did not intend that Mr.\nChadwick should leave the palace without having heard what she had\nto say, but she thought that it would be well that he should be made\nto conceive that though the summons had been written by her, it\nhad really been intended on the part of the bishop. \"Mr. Chadwick\nwill be with you at eleven, bishop,\" she said, as she got up from\nthe breakfast-table, at which she left his lordship with two of\nhis daughters and with a married son-in-law, a clergyman who was\nstaying in the house. \"Very well, my dear,\" said the bishop, with a\nsmile,--for he was anxious not to betray any vexation at his wife's\ninterference before his daughters or the Rev. Mr. Tickler. But he\nunderstood it all. Mr. Chadwick had been sent for with reference to\nMr. Crawley, and he was driven,--absolutely driven, to propose to his\nlawyer that this commission of inquiry should be issued.\n\nPunctually at eleven Mr. Chadwick came, wearing a very long face\nas he entered the palace door,--for he felt that he would in all\nprobability be now compelled to quarrel with Mrs. Proudie. Much he\ncould bear, but there was a limit to his endurance. She had never\nabsolutely sent for him before, though she had often interfered\nwith him. \"I shall have to tell her a bit of my mind,\" he said, as\nhe stepped across the Close, habited in his best suit of black,\nwith most exact white cravat, and yet looking not quite like a\nclergyman,--with some touch of the undertaker in his gait. When he\nfound that he was shown into the bishop's room, and that the bishop\nwas there,--and the bishop only,--his mind was relieved. It would\nhave been better that the bishop should have written himself, or that\nthe chaplain should have written in his lordship's name; that,\nhowever, was a trifle.\n\nBut the bishop did not know what to say to him. If he intended to\ndirect an inquiry to be made by the rural dean, it would be by no\nmeans becoming that he should consult Mr. Chadwick as to doing so.\nIt might be well, or if not well at any rate not improper, that he\nshould make the application to Dr. Tempest through Mr. Chadwick; but\nin that case he must give the order at once, and he still wished to\navoid it if it were possible. Since he had been in the diocese no\ncase so grave as this had been pushed upon him. The intervention\nof the rural dean in an ordinary way he had used,--had been made\nto use,--more than once, by his wife. A vicar had been absent a\nlittle too long from one parish, and there had been rumours about\nbrandy-and-water in another. Once he had been very nearly in deep\nwater because Mrs. Proudie had taken it in dudgeon that a certain\nyoung rector, who had been left a widower, had a very pretty\ngoverness for his children; and there had been that case, sadly\nnotorious in the diocese at the time, of our excellent friend Mr.\nRobarts of Framley, when the bailiffs were in his house because he\ncouldn't pay his debts,--or rather, the debts of his friend for whom\nhe had signed bills. But in all these cases some good fortune had\nintervened, and he had been saved from the terrible necessity of any\nulterior process. But now,--now he was being driven beyond himself,\nand all to no purpose. If Mrs. Proudie would only wait three months\nthe civil law would do it all for him. But here was Mr. Chadwick in\nthe room, and he knew that it would be useless for him to attempt to\ntalk to Mr. Chadwick about other matters, and so dismiss him. The\nwife of his bosom would be down upon them before Chadwick could be\nout of the room.\n\n\"H--m--ha. How d'ye do, Mr. Chadwick--won't you sit down?\" Mr.\nChadwick thanked his lordship, and sat down. \"It's very cold, isn't\nit, Mr. Chadwick?\"\n\n\"A hard frost, my lord, but a beautiful day.\"\n\n\"Won't you come near the fire?\" The bishop knew that Mrs. Proudie was\non the road, and had an eye to the proper strategical position of\nhis forces. Mrs. Proudie would certainly take up her position in a\ncertain chair from whence the light enabled her to rake her husband\nthoroughly. What advantage she might have from this he could not\nprevent;--but he could so place Mr. Chadwick, that the lawyer should\nbe more within the reach of his eye than that of his wife. So the\nbishop pointed to an arm-chair opposite to himself and near the fire,\nand Mr. Chadwick seated himself accordingly.\n\n\"This is a very sad affair about Mr. Crawley,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"Very sad indeed,\" said the lawyer. \"I never pitied a man so much in\nmy life, my lord.\"\n\nThis was not exactly the line which the bishop was desirous of\ntaking. \"Of course he is to be pitied;--of course he is. But from all\nI hear, Mr. Chadwick, I am afraid,--I am afraid we must not acquit\nhim.\"\n\n\"As to that, my lord, he has to stand his trial, of course.\"\n\n\"But, you see, Mr. Chadwick, regarding him as a beneficed\nclergyman,--with a cure of souls,--the question is whether I should\nbe justified in leaving him where he is till his trial shall come\non.\"\n\n\"Of course your lordship knows best about that, but--\"\n\n\"I know there is a difficulty. I know that. But I am inclined to\nthink that in the interests of the parish I am bound to issue a\ncommission of inquiry.\"\n\n\"I believe your lordship has attempted to silence him, and that he\nhas refused to comply.\"\n\n\"I thought it better for everybody's sake,--especially for his own,\nthat he should for a while be relieved from his duties; but he is\nan obstinate man, a very obstinate man. I made the attempt with all\nconsideration for his feelings.\"\n\n\"He is hard put to it, my lord. I know the man and his pride. The\ndean has spoken of him to me more than once, and nobody knows him so\nwell as the dean. If I might venture to offer an opinion--\"\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Chadwick,\" said Mrs. Proudie, coming into the room\nand taking her accustomed seat. \"No thank you, no; I will stay away\nfrom the fire, if you please. His lordship has spoken to you no doubt\nabout this unfortunate, wretched man?\"\n\n\"We are speaking of him now, my dear.\"\n\n\"Something must of course be done to put a stop to the crying\ndisgrace of having such a man preaching from a pulpit in this\ndiocese. When I think of the souls of the people in that poor\nvillage, my hair literally stands on end. And then he is\ndisobedient!\"\n\n\"That is the worst of it,\" said the bishop. \"It would have been\nso much better for himself if he would have allowed me to provide\nquietly for the services till the trial be over.\"\n\n\"I could have told you, my lord, that he would not do that, from what\nI knew of him,\" said Mr. Chadwick.\n\n\"But he must do it,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"He must be made to do it.\"\n\n\"His lordship will find it difficult,\" said Mr. Chadwick.\n\n\"I can issue a commission, you know, to the rural dean,\" said the\nbishop mildly.\n\n\"Yes, you can do that. And Dr. Tempest in two months' time will have\nnamed his assessors--\"\n\n\"Dr. Tempest must not name them; the bishop must name them,\" said\nMrs. Proudie.\n\n\"It is customary to leave that to the rural dean,\" said Mr. Chadwick.\n\"The bishop no doubt can object to any one named.\"\n\n\"And can specially select any clergyman he pleases from the\narchdeaconry,\" said the bishop. \"I have known it done.\"\n\n\"The rural dean in such case has probably been an old man, and not\nactive,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"And Dr. Tempest is a very old man,\" said Mrs. Proudie, \"and in such\na matter not at all trustworthy. He was one of the magistrates who\ntook bail.\"\n\n\"His lordship could hardly set him aside,\" said the lawyer. \"At any\nrate I would not recommend him to try. I think you might suggest a\ncommission of five, and propose two of the number yourself. I do not\nthink that in such a case Dr. Tempest would raise any question.\"\n\nAt last it was settled in this way. Mr. Chadwick was to prepare a\nletter to Dr. Tempest, for the bishop's signature, in which the\ndoctor should be requested, as the rural dean to whom Mr. Crawley was\nsubject, to hold a commission of five to inquire into Mr. Crawley's\nconduct. The letter was to explain to Dr. Tempest that the bishop,\nmoved by his solicitude for the souls of the people of Hogglestock,\nhad endeavoured, \"in a friendly way,\" to induce Mr. Crawley to desist\nfrom his ministrations; but that having failed through Mr. Crawley's\nobstinacy, he had no alternative but to proceed in this way. \"You had\nbetter say that his lordship, as bishop of the diocese, can take no\nheed of the coming trial,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"I think his lordship\nhad better say nothing at all about the trial,\" said Mr. Chadwick. \"I\nthink that will be best,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"But if they report against him,\" said Mr. Chadwick, \"you can only\nthen proceed in the ecclesiastical court,--at your own expense.\"\n\n\"He'll hardly be so obstinate as that,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"I'm afraid you don't know him, my lord,\" said the lawyer. The\nbishop, thinking of the scene which had taken place in that very room\nonly yesterday, felt that he did know Mr. Crawley, and felt also that\nthe hope which he had just expressed was one in which he himself put\nno trust. But something might turn up; and it was devoutly to be\nhoped that Dr. Tempest would take a long time over his inquiry. The\nassizes might come on as soon as it was terminated, or very shortly\nafterwards; and then everything might be well. \"You won't find Dr.\nTempest very ready at it,\" said Mr. Chadwick. The bishop in his heart\nwas comforted by the words. \"But he must be made to be ready to do\nhis duty,\" said Mrs. Proudie, imperiously. Mr. Chadwick shrugged his\nshoulders, then got up, spoke his farewell little speeches, and left\nthe palace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nLILY DALE WRITES TWO WORDS IN HER BOOK.\n\n\nJohn Eames saw nothing more of Lily Dale till he packed up his\nportmanteau, left his mother's house, and went to stay for a few days\nwith his old friend Lady Julia; and this did not happen till he had\nbeen above a week at Guestwick. Mrs. Dale repeatedly said that it was\nodd that Johnny did not come to see them; and Grace, speaking of him\nto Lily, asked why he did not come. Lily, in her funny way, declared\nthat he would come soon enough. But even while she was joking there\nwas something of half-expressed consciousness in her words,--as\nthough she felt it to be foolish to speak of his coming as she\nmight of that of any other young man, before people who knew her\nwhole story. \"He'll come quick enough. He knows, and I know, that\nhis coming will do no good. Of course I shall be glad to see him.\nWhy shouldn't I be glad to see him? I've known him and liked\nhim all my life. I liked him when there did not seem to be much\nabout him to like, and now that he is clever, and agreeable, and\ngood-looking,--which he never was as a lad,--why shouldn't I go on\nliking him? He's more like a brother to me than anybody else I've\ngot. James,\"--James was her brother-in-law, Dr. Crofts,--\"thinks of\nnothing but his patients and his babies, and my cousin Bernard is\nmuch too grand a person for me to take the liberty of loving him. I\nshall be very glad to see Johnny Eames.\" From all which Mrs. Dale was\nled to believe that Johnny's case was still hopeless. And how should\nit not be hopeless? Had Lily not confessed within the last week or\ntwo that she still loved Adolphus Crosbie?\n\nMrs. Eames also, and Mary, were surprised that John did not go over\nto Allington. \"You haven't seen Mrs. Dale yet, or the squire?\" said\nhis mother.\n\n\"I shall see them when I am at the cottage.\"\n\n\"Yes;--no doubt. But it seems strange that you should be here so long\nwithout going to them.\"\n\n\"There's time enough,\" said he. \"I shall have nothing else to do\nwhen I'm at the cottage.\" Then, when Mary had spoken to him again in\nprivate, expressing a hope that there was \"nothing wrong,\" he had\nbeen very angry with his sister. \"What do you mean by wrong? What\nrubbish you girls talk! and you never have any delicacy of feeling to\nmake you silent.\"\n\n\"Oh, John, don't say such hard things as that of me!\"\n\n\"But I do say them. You'll make me swear among you some day that I\nwill never see Lily Dale again. As it is, I wish I never had seen\nher,--simply because I am so dunned about it.\" In all of which I\nthink that Johnny was manifestly wrong. When the humour was on him he\nwas fond enough of talking about Lily Dale. Had he not taught her to\ndo so, I doubt whether his sister would ever have mentioned Lily's\nname to him. \"I did not mean to dun you, John,\" said Mary, meekly.\n\nBut at last he went to Lady Julia's, and was no sooner there than he\nwas ready to start for Allington. When Lady Julia spoke to him about\nLily, he did not venture to snub her. Indeed, of all his friends,\nLady Julia was the one with whom on this subject he allowed himself\nthe most unrestricted confidence. He came over one day, just before\ndinner, and declared his intention of walking over to Allington\nimmediately after breakfast on the following morning. \"It's the last\ntime, Lady Julia,\" he said.\n\n\"So you say, Johnny.\"\n\n\"And so I mean it! What's the good of a man frittering away his life?\nWhat's the good of wishing for what you can't get?\"\n\n\"Jacob was not in such a hurry when he wished for Rachel.\"\n\n\"That was all very well for an old patriarch who had seven or eight\nhundred years to live.\"\n\n\"My dear John, you forget your Bible. Jacob did not live half as long\nas that.\"\n\n\"He lived long enough, and slowly enough, to be able to wait fourteen\nyears;--and then he had something to comfort him in the meantime.\nAnd after all, Lady Julia, it's more than seven years since I first\nthought Lily was the prettiest girl I ever saw.\"\n\n\"How old are you now?\"\n\n\"Twenty-seven,--and she's twenty-four.\"\n\n\"You've time enough yet, if you'll only be patient.\"\n\n\"I'll be patient for to-morrow, Lady Julia, but never again. Not\nthat I mean to quarrel with her. I'm not such a fool as to quarrel\nwith a girl because she can't like me. I know how it all is. If that\nscoundrel had not come across my path just when he did,--in that\nvery nick of time, all might have been right betwixt her and me.\nI couldn't have offered to marry her before, when I hadn't as much\nincome as would have found her in bread-and-butter. And then, just as\nbetter times came to me, he stepped in! I wonder whether it will be\nexpected of me that I should forgive him?\"\n\n\"As far as that goes, you have no right to be angry with him.\"\n\n\"But I am,--all the same.\"\n\n\"And so was I,--but not for stepping in, as you call it.\"\n\n\"You and I are different, Lady Julia. I was angry with him for\nstepping in; but I couldn't show it. Then he stepped out, and I did\nmanage to show it. And now I shouldn't wonder if he doesn't step in\nagain. After all, why should he have such a power? It was simply the\nnick of time which gave it to him.\" That John Eames should be able to\nfind some consolation in this consideration is devoutly to be hoped\nby us all.\n\nThere was nothing said about Lily Dale the next morning at breakfast.\nLady Julia observed that John was dressed a little more neatly than\nusual;--though the change was not such as to have called for her\nspecial observation, had she not known the business on which he was\nintent.\n\n\"You have nothing to send to the Dales?\" he said, as he got up from\nthe table.\n\n\"Nothing but my love, Johnny.\"\n\n\"No worsted or embroidery work,--or a pot of special jam for the\nsquire?\"\n\n\"No, sir, nothing; though I should like to make you carry a pair of\npanniers, if I could.\"\n\n\"They would become me well,\" said Johnny, \"for I am going on an ass's\nerrand.\" Then, without waiting for the word of affection which was on\nthe old woman's lips, he got himself out of the room, and started on\nhis journey.\n\nThe walk was only three miles and the weather was dry and frosty, and\nhe had come to the turn leading up to the church and the squire's\nhouse almost before he remembered that he was near Allington. Here\nhe paused for a moment to think. If he continued his way down by the\n\"Red Lion\" and through Allington Street, he must knock at Mrs. Dale's\ndoor, and ask for admission by means of the servant,--as would be\ndone by any ordinary visitor. But he could make his way on to the\nlawn by going up beyond the wall of the churchyard and through the\nsquire's garden. He knew the path well,--very well; and he thought\nthat he might take so much liberty as that, both with the squire and\nwith Mrs. Dale, although his visits to Allington were not so frequent\nnow as they used to be in the days of his boyhood. He did not wish\nto be admitted by the servant, and therefore he went through the\ngardens. Luckily he did not see the squire, who would have detained\nhim, and he escaped from Hopkins, the old gardener, with little more\nthan a word. \"I'm going down to see the ladies, Hopkins; I suppose I\nshall find them?\" And then, while Hopkins was arranging his spade so\nthat he might lean upon it for a little chat, Johnny was gone and had\nmade his way into the other garden. He had thought it possible that\nhe might meet Lily out among the walks by herself, and such a meeting\nas this would have suited him better than any other. And as he\ncrossed the little bridge which separated the gardens he thought of\nmore than one such meeting,--of one especial occasion on which he\nhad first ventured to tell her in plain words that he loved her. But\nbefore that day Crosbie had come there, and at the moment in which he\nwas speaking of his love she regarded Crosbie as an angel of light\nupon the earth. What hope could there have been for him then? What\nuse was there in his telling such a tale of love at that time? When\nhe told it, he knew that Crosbie had been before him. He knew that\nCrosbie was at that moment the angel of light. But as he had never\nbefore been able to speak of his love, so was he then unable not to\nspeak of it. He had spoken, and of course had been simply rebuked.\nSince that day Crosbie had ceased to be an angel of light, and he,\nJohn Eames, had spoken often. But he had spoken in vain, and now he\nwould speak once again.\n\nHe went through the garden and over the lawn belonging to the Small\nHouse and saw no one. He forgot, I think, that ladies do not come\nout to pick roses when the ground is frozen, and that croquet is not\noften in progress with the hoar-frost on the grass. So he walked\nup to the little terrace before the drawing-room, and looking in\nsaw Mrs. Dale, and Lily, and Grace at their morning work. Lily was\ndrawing, and Mrs. Dale was writing, and Grace had her needle in her\nhand. As it happened, no one at first perceived him, and he had time\nto feel that after all he would have managed better if he had been\nannounced in the usual way. As, however, it was now necessary that\nhe should announce himself, he knocked at the window, and they all\nimmediately looked up and saw him. \"It's my cousin John,\" said Grace.\n\"Oh, Johnny, how are you at last?\" said Mrs. Dale. But it was Lily\nwho, without speaking, opened the window for him, who was the first\nto give him her hand, and who led him through into the room.\n\n\"It's a great shame my coming in this way,\" said John, \"and letting\nall the cold air in upon you.\"\n\n\"We shall survive it,\" said Mrs. Dale. \"I suppose you have just come\ndown from my brother-in-law?\"\n\n\"No; I have not seen the squire as yet. I will do so before I go\nback, of course. But it seemed such a commonplace sort of thing to go\nround by the village.\"\n\n\"We are very glad to see you, by whatever way you come;--are we not,\nmamma?\" said Lily.\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that. We were only saying yesterday that as you\nhad been in the country a fortnight without coming to us, we did not\nthink we would be at home when you did come.\"\n\n\"But I have caught you, you see,\" said Johnny.\n\nAnd so they went on, chatting of old times and of mutual friends very\ncomfortably for full an hour. And there was some serious conversation\nabout Grace's father and his affairs, and John declared his opinion\nthat Mr. Crawley ought to go to his uncle, Thomas Toogood, not at all\nknowing at that time that Mr. Crawley himself had come to the same\nopinion. And John gave them an elaborate description of Sir Raffle\nBuffle, standing up with his back to the fire with his hat on his\nhead, and speaking with a loud harsh voice, to show them the way in\nwhich he declared that that gentleman received his inferiors; and\nthen bowing and scraping and rubbing his hands together and simpering\nwith would-be softness,--declaring that after that fashion Sir Raffle\nreceived his superiors. And they were very merry,--so that no one\nwould have thought that Johnny was a despondent lover, now bent on\nthrowing the dice for his last stake; or that Lily was aware that she\nwas in the presence of one lover, and that she was like to fall to\nthe ground between two stools,--having two lovers, neither of whom\ncould serve her turn.\n\n\"How can you consent to serve him if he's such a man as that?\" said\nLily, speaking of Sir Raffle.\n\n\"I do not serve him. I serve the Queen,--or rather the public. I\ndon't take his wages, and he does not play his tricks with me. He\nknows that he can't. He has tried it, and has failed. And he only\nkeeps me where I am because I've had some money left me. He thinks it\nfine to have a private secretary with a fortune. I know that he tells\npeople all manner of lies about it, making it out to be five times\nas much as it is. Dear old Huffle Snuffle. He is such an ass; and\nyet he's had wit enough to get to the top of the tree, and to keep\nhimself there. He began the world without a penny. Now he has got a\nhandle to his name, and he'll live in clover all his life. It's very\nodd, isn't it, Mrs. Dale?\"\n\n\"I suppose he does his work?\"\n\n\"When men get so high as that, there's no knowing whether they work\nor whether they don't. There isn't much for them to do, as far as I\ncan see. They have to look beautiful, and frighten the young ones.\"\n\n\"And does Sir Raffle look beautiful?\" Lily asked.\n\n\"After a fashion, he does. There is something imposing about such a\nman till you're used to it, and can see through it. Of course it's\nall padding. There are men who work, no doubt. But among the bigwigs,\nand bishops and cabinet ministers, I fancy that the looking beautiful\nis the chief part of it. Dear me, you don't mean to say it's luncheon\ntime?\"\n\nBut it was luncheon time, and not only had he not as yet said a word\nof all that which he had come to say, but had not as yet made any\nmove towards getting it said. How was he to arrange that Lily\nshould be left alone with him? Lady Julia had said that she should\nnot expect him back till dinner-time, and he had answered her\nlackadaisically, \"I don't suppose I shall be there above ten minutes.\nTen minutes will say all I've got to say, and do all I've got to do.\nAnd then I suppose I shall go and cut names about upon bridges,--eh,\nLady Julia?\" Lady Julia understood his words; for once, upon a former\noccasion, she had found him cutting Lily's name on the rail of a\nwooden bridge in her brother's grounds. But he had now been a couple\nof hours at the Small House, and had not said a word of that which he\nhad come to say.\n\n\"Are you going to walk out with us after lunch?\" said Lily.\n\n\"He will have had walking enough,\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\"We'll convoy him back part of the way,\" said Lily.\n\n\"I'm not going yet,\" said Johnny, \"unless you turn me out.\"\n\n\"But we must have our walk before it is dark,\" said Lily.\n\n\"You might go up with him to your uncle,\" said Mrs. Dale. \"Indeed,\nI promised to go up myself, and so did you, Grace, to see the\nmicroscope. I heard Mr. Dale give orders that one of those\nlong-legged reptiles should be caught on purpose for your\ninspection.\"\n\nMrs. Dale's little scheme for bringing the two together was very\ntransparent, but it was not the less wise on that account. Schemes\nwill often be successful, let them be ever so transparent. Little\nintrigues become necessary, not to conquer unwilling people, but\npeople who are willing enough, who, nevertheless, cannot give way\nexcept under the machinations of an intrigue.\n\n\"I don't think I'll mind looking at the long-legged creature to-day,\"\nsaid Johnny.\n\n\"I must go, of course,\" said Grace.\n\nLily said nothing at the moment, either about the long-legged\ncreature or the walk. That which must be, must be. She knew well why\nJohn Eames had come there. She knew that the visits to his mother\nand to Lady Julia would never have been made, but that he might have\nthis interview. And he had a right to demand, at any rate, as much as\nthat. That which must be, must be. And therefore when both Mrs. Dale\nand Grace stoutly maintained their purpose of going up to the squire,\nLily neither attempted to persuade John to accompany them, nor said\nthat she would do so herself.\n\n\"I will convoy you home myself,\" she said, \"and Grace, when she has\ndone with the beetle, shall come and meet me. Won't you, Grace?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"We are not helpless young ladies in these parts, nor yet timorous,\"\ncontinued Lily. \"We can walk about without being afraid of ghosts,\nrobbers, wild bulls, young men, or gipsies. Come the field path,\nGrace. I will go as far as the big oak with him, and then I shall\nturn back, and I shall come in by the stile opposite the church gate,\nand through the garden. So you can't miss me.\"\n\n\"I daresay he'll come back with you,\" said Grace.\n\n\"No, he won't. He will do nothing of the kind. He'll have to go on\nand open Lady Julia's bottle of port wine for his own drinking.\"\n\nAll this was very good on Lily's part, and very good also on the part\nof Mrs. Dale; and John was of course very much obliged to them. But\nthere was a lack of romance in it all, which did not seem to him\nto argue well as to his success. He did not think much about it,\nbut he felt that Lily would not have been so ready to arrange their\nwalk had she intended to yield to his entreaty. No doubt in these\nlatter days plain good sense had become the prevailing mark of\nher character,--perhaps, as Johnny thought, a little too strongly\nprevailing; but even with all her plain good sense and determination\nto dispense with the absurdities of romance in the affairs of her\nlife, she would not have proposed herself as his companion for a\nwalk across the fields merely that she might have an opportunity\nof accepting his hand. He did not say all this to himself, but he\ninstinctively felt that it was so. And he felt also that it should\nhave been his duty to arrange the walk, or the proper opportunity for\nthe scene that was to come. She had done it instead,--she and her\nmother between them, thereby forcing upon him a painful conviction\nthat he himself had not been equal to the occasion. \"I always make a\nmull of it,\" he said to himself, when the girls went up to get their\nhats.\n\nThey went down together through the garden, and parted where the\npaths led away, one to the great house and the other towards the\nchurch. \"I'll certainly come and call upon the squire before I go\nback to London,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"We'll tell him so,\" said Mrs. Dale. \"He would be sure to hear that\nyou had been with us, even if we said nothing about it.\"\n\n\"Of course he would,\" said Lily; \"Hopkins has seen him.\" Then they\nseparated, and Lily and John Eames were together.\n\nHardly a word was said, perhaps not a word, till they had crossed the\nroad and got into the field opposite to the church. And in this first\nfield there was more than one path, and the children of the village\nwere often there, and it had about it something of a public nature.\nJohn Eames felt that it was by no means a fitting field to say that\nwhich he had to say. In crossing it, therefore, he merely remarked\nthat the day was very fine for walking. Then he added one special\nword, \"And it is so good of you, Lily, to come with me.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to come with you. I would do more than that, John,\nto show how glad I am to see you.\" Then they had come to the second\nlittle gate, and beyond that the fields were really fields, and there\nwere stiles instead of wicket-gates, and the business of the day must\nbe begun.\n\n\"Lily, whenever I come here you say you are glad to see me?\"\n\n\"And so I am,--very glad. Only you would take it as meaning what it\ndoes not mean, I would tell you, that of all my friends living away\nfrom the reach of my daily life, you are the one whose coming is ever\nthe most pleasant to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lily!\"\n\n\"It was, I think, only yesterday that I was telling Grace that you\nare more like a brother to me than any one else. I wish it might be\nso. I wish we might swear to be brother and sister. I'd do more for\nyou then than walk across the fields with you to Guestwick Cottage.\nYour prosperity would then be the thing in the world for which I\nshould be most anxious. And if you should marry--\"\n\n[Illustration: Lily wishes that they might swear to be\nBrother and Sister.]\n\n\"It can never be like that between us,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Can it not? I think it can. Perhaps not this year, or next year;\nperhaps not in the next five years. But I make myself happy with\nthinking that it may be so some day. I shall wait for it patiently,\nvery patiently, even though you should rebuff me again and again,--as\nyou have done now.\"\n\n\"I have not rebuffed you.\"\n\n\"Not maliciously, or injuriously, or offensively. I will be very\npatient, and take little rebuffs without complaining. This is the\nworst stile of all. When Grace and I are here together we can never\nmanage it without tearing ourselves all to pieces. It is much nicer\nto have you to help me.\"\n\n\"Let me help you always,\" he said, keeping her hands in his after he\nhad aided her to jump from the stile to the ground.\n\n\"Yes, as my brother.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense, Lily.\"\n\n\"Is it nonsense? Nonsense is a hard word.\"\n\n\"It is nonsense as coming from you to me. Lily, I sometimes think\nthat I am persecuting you, writing to you, coming after you, as I\nam doing now,--telling the same whining story,--asking, asking, and\nasking for that which you say you will never give me. And then I feel\nashamed of myself, and swear that I will do it no more.\"\n\n\"Do not be ashamed of yourself; but yet do it no more.\"\n\n\"And then,\" he continued, without minding her words, \"at other times\nI feel that it must be my own fault; that if I only persevered with\nsufficient energy I must be successful. At such times I swear that I\nwill never give it up.\"\n\n\"Oh, John, if you could only know how little worthy of such pursuit\nit is.\"\n\n\"Leave me to judge of that, dear. When a man has taken a month, or\nperhaps only a week, or perhaps not more than half an hour, to make\nup his mind, it may be very well to tell him that he doesn't know\nwhat he is about. I've been in the office now for over seven years,\nand the first day I went I put an oath into a book that I would come\nback and get you for my wife when I had got enough to live upon.\"\n\n\"Did you, John?\"\n\n\"Yes. I can show it you. I used to come and hover about the place in\nthe old days, before I went to London, when I was such a fool that\nI couldn't speak to you if I met you. I am speaking of a time long\nbefore,--before that man came down here.\"\n\n\"Do not speak of him, Johnny.\"\n\n\"I must speak of him. A man isn't to hold his tongue when everything\nhe has in the world is at stake. I suppose he loved you after a\nfashion, once.\"\n\n\"Pray, pray do not speak ill of him.\"\n\n\"I am not going to abuse him. You can judge of him by his deeds. I\ncannot say anything worse of him than what they say. I suppose he\nloved you; but he certainly did not love you as I have done. I have\nat any rate been true to you. Yes, Lily, I have been true to you.\nI am true to you. He did not know what he was about. I do. I am\njustified in saying that I do. I want you to be my wife. It is no use\nyour talking about it as though I only half wanted it.\"\n\n\"I did not say that.\"\n\n\"Is not a man to have any reward? Of course if you had married him\nthere would have been an end of it. He had come in between me and my\nhappiness, and I must have borne it, as other men bear such sorrows.\nBut you have not married him; and, of course, I cannot but feel that\nI may yet have a chance. Lily, answer me this. Do you believe that I\nlove you?\" But she did not answer him. \"You can at any rate tell me\nthat. Do you think that I am in earnest?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think you are in earnest.\"\n\n\"And do you believe that I love you with all my heart and all my\nstrength and all my soul?\"\n\n\"Oh, John!\"\n\n\"But do you?\"\n\n\"I think you love me.\"\n\n\"Think! what am I to say or to do to make you understand that my only\nidea of happiness is the idea that sooner or later I may get you to\nbe my wife? Lily, will you say that it shall be so? Speak, Lily.\nThere is no one that will not be glad. Your uncle will consent,--has\nconsented. Your mother wishes it. Bell wishes it. My mother wishes\nit. Lady Julia wishes it. You would be doing what everybody about\nyou wants you to do. And why should you not do it? It isn't that you\ndislike me. You wouldn't talk about being my sister, if you had not\nsome sort of regard for me.\"\n\n\"I have a regard for you.\"\n\n\"Then why will you not be my wife? Oh, Lily, say the word now, here,\nat once. Say the word, and you'll make me the happiest fellow in all\nEngland.\" As he spoke he took her by both arms, and held her fast.\nShe did not struggle to get away from him, but stood quite still,\nlooking into his face, while the first sparkle of a salt tear formed\nitself in each eye. \"Lily, one little word will do it,--half a word,\na nod, a smile. Just touch my arm with your hand and I will take it\nfor a yes.\" I think that she almost tried to touch him; that the word\nwas in her throat, and that she almost strove to speak it. But there\nwas no syllable spoken, and her fingers did not loose themselves to\nfall upon his sleeve. \"Lily, Lily, what can I say to you?\"\n\n\"I wish I could,\" she whispered;--but the whisper was so hoarse that\nhe hardly recognized the voice.\n\n\"And why can you not? What is there to hinder you? There is nothing\nto hinder you, Lily.\"\n\n\"Yes, John; there is that which must hinder me.\"\n\n\"And what is it?\"\n\n\"I will tell you. You are so good and so true, and so\nexcellent,--such a dear, dear, dear friend, that I will tell you\neverything, so that you may read my heart. I will tell you as I tell\nmamma,--you and her and no one else;--for you are the choice friend\nof my heart. I cannot be your wife because of the love I bear for\nanother man.\"\n\n\"And that man is he,--he who came here?\"\n\n\"Of course it is he. I think, Johnny, you and I are alike in this,\nthat when we have loved we cannot bring ourselves to change. You will\nnot change, though it would be so much better you should do so.\"\n\n\"No; I will never change.\"\n\n\"Nor can I. When I sleep I dream of him. When I am alone I cannot\nbanish him from my thoughts. I cannot define what it is to love him.\nI want nothing from him,--nothing, nothing. But I move about through\nmy little world thinking of him, and I shall do so to the end. I\nused to feel proud of my love, though it made me so wretched that I\nthought it would kill me. I am not proud of it any longer. It is a\nfoolish poor-spirited weakness,--as though my heart had been only\nhalf formed in the making. Do you be stronger, John. A man should be\nstronger than a woman.\"\n\n\"I have none of that sort of strength.\"\n\n\"Nor have I. What can we do but pity each other, and swear that we\nwill be friends,--dear friends. There is the oak-tree and I have got\nto turn back. We have said everything that we can say,--unless you\nwill tell me that you will be my brother.\"\n\n\"No; I will not tell you that.\"\n\n\"Good-by, then, Johnny.\"\n\nHe paused, holding her by the hand and thinking of another question\nwhich he longed to put to her,--considering whether he would ask her\nthat question or not. He hardly knew whether he were entitled to ask\nit;--whether or no the asking of it would be ungenerous. She had said\nthat she would tell him everything,--as she had told everything to\nher mother. \"Of course,\" he said, \"I have no right to expect to know\nanything of your future intentions?\"\n\n\"You may know them all,--as far as I know them myself. I have said\nthat you should read my heart.\"\n\n\"If this man, whose name I cannot bear to mention, should come\nagain--\"\n\n\"If he were to come again he would come in vain, John.\" She did not\nsay that he had come again. She could tell her own secret, but not\nthat of another person.\n\n\"You would not marry him, now that he is free?\"\n\nShe stood and thought a while before she answered him. \"No, I should\nnot marry him now. I think not.\" Then she paused again. \"Nay, I am\nsure I would not. After what has passed I could not trust myself to\ndo it. There is my hand on it. I will not.\"\n\n\"No, Lily, I do not want that.\"\n\n\"But I insist. I will not marry Mr. Crosbie. But you must not\nmisunderstand me, John. There;--all that is over for me now. All\nthose dreams about love, and marriage, and of a house of my own, and\nchildren,--and a cross husband, and a wedding-ring growing always\ntighter as I grow fatter and older. I have dreamed of such things\nas other girls do,--more perhaps than other girls, more than I\nshould have done. And now I accept the thing as finished. You wrote\nsomething in your book, you dear John,--something that could not be\nmade to come true. Dear John, I wish for your sake it was otherwise.\nI will go home and I will write in my book, this very day, Lilian\nDale, Old Maid. If ever I make that false, do you come and ask me for\nthe page.\"\n\n\"Let it remain there till I am allowed to tear it out.\"\n\n\"I will write it, and it shall never be torn out. You I cannot marry.\nHim I will not marry. You may believe me, Johnny, when I say there\ncan never be a third.\"\n\n\"And is that to be the end of it?\"\n\n\"Yes;--that is to be the end of it. Not the end of our friendship.\nOld maids have friends.\"\n\n\"It shall not be the end of it. There shall be no end of it with me.\"\n\n\"But, John--\"\n\n\"Do not suppose that I will trouble you again,--at any rate not for a\nwhile. In five years time perhaps,--\"\n\n\"Now, Johnny, you are laughing at me. And of course it is the best\nway. If there is not Grace, and she has caught me before I have\nturned back. Good-by, dear, dear John. God bless you. I think you\nthe finest fellow there is in the world. I do, and so does mamma.\nRemember always that there is a temple at Allington in which your\nworship is never forgotten.\" Then she pressed his hand and turned\naway from him to meet Grace Crawley. John did not stop to speak a\nword to his cousin, but pursued his way alone.\n\n\"That cousin of yours,\" said Lily, \"is simply the dearest,\nwarmest-hearted, finest creature that ever was seen in the shape of\na man.\"\n\n\"Have you told him that you think him so?\" said Grace.\n\n\"Indeed, I have,\" said Lily.\n\n\"But have you told this finest, warmest, dearest creature that he\nshall be rewarded with the prize he covets?\"\n\n\"No, Grace. I have told him nothing of the kind. I think he\nunderstands it all now. If he does not, it is not for the want of my\ntelling him. I don't suppose any lady was ever more open-spoken to a\ngentleman than I have been to him.\"\n\n\"And why have you sent him away disappointed? You know you love him.\"\n\n\"You see, my dear,\" said Lily, \"you allow yourself, for the sake of\nyour argument, to use a word in a double sense, and you attempt to\nconfound me by doing so. But I am a great deal too clever for you,\nand have thought too much about it, to be taken in in that way. I\ncertainly love your cousin John; and so I do love Mr. Boyce, the\nvicar.\"\n\n\"You love Johnny much better than you do Mr. Boyce.\"\n\n\"True; very much better; but it is the same sort of love. However, it\nis a great deal too deep for you to understand. You're too young, and\nI shan't try to explain it. But the long and the short of it is,--I\nam not going to marry your cousin.\"\n\n\"I wish you were,\" said Grace, \"with all my heart.\"\n\nJohn Eames as he returned to the cottage was by no means able to\nfall back upon those resolutions as to his future life, which he had\nformed for himself and communicated to his friend Dalrymple, and\nwhich he had intended to bring at once into force in the event of\nhis being again rejected by Lily Dale. \"I will cleanse my mind of it\naltogether,\" he had said, \"and though I may not forget her, I will\nlive as though she were forgotten. If she declines my proposal again,\nI will accept her word as final. I will not go about the world any\nlonger as a stricken deer,--to be pitied or else bullied by the rest\nof the herd.\" On his way down to Guestwick he had sworn twenty times\nthat it should be so. He would make one more effort, and then he\nwould give it up. But now, after his interview with Lily, he was as\nlittle disposed to give it up as ever.\n\nHe sat upon a gate in a paddock through which there was a back\nentrance into Lady Julia's garden, and there swore a thousand oaths\nthat he would never give her up. He was, at any rate, sure that she\nwould never become the wife of any one else. He was equally sure that\nhe would never become the husband of any other wife. He could trust\nher. Yes; he was sure of that. But could he trust himself? Communing\nwith himself, he told himself that after all he was but a poor\ncreature. Circumstances had been very good to him, but he had done\nnothing for himself. He was vain, and foolish, and unsteady. So he\ntold himself while sitting upon the gate. But he had, at any rate,\nbeen constant to Lily, and constant he would remain.\n\nHe would never more mention her name to any one,--unless it were to\nLady Julia to-night. To Dalrymple he would not open his mouth about\nher, but would plainly ask his friend to be silent on that subject if\nher name should be mentioned by him. But morning and evening he would\npray for her, and in his prayers he would always think of her as\nhis wife. He would never speak to another girl without remembering\nthat he was bound to Lily. He would go nowhere into society without\nrecalling to mind the fact that he was bound by the chains of a\nsolemn engagement. If he knew himself he would be constant to Lily.\n\nAnd then he considered in what manner it would be best and most\nbecoming that he should still prosecute his endeavour and repeat his\noffer. He thought that he would write to her every year, on the same\nday of the year, year after year, it might be for the next twenty\nyears. And his letters should be very simple. Sitting there on the\ngate he planned the wording of his letters;--of his first letter, and\nof his second, and of his third. They should be very like to each\nother,--should hardly be more than a repetition of the same words.\n\"If now you are ready for me, then, Lily, am I, as ever, still ready\nfor you.\" And then \"if now\" again, and again \"if now;--and still\nif now.\" When his hair should be grey, and the wrinkles on his\ncheeks,--ay, though they should be on hers, he would still continue\nto tell her from year to year that he was ready to take her. Surely\nsome day that \"if now\" would prevail. And should it never prevail,\nthe merit of his constancy should be its own reward.\n\nSuch letters as those she would surely keep. Then he looked forward,\ndown into the valley of coming years, and fancied her as she might\nsit reading them in the twilight of some long evening,--letters which\nhad been written all in vain. He thought that he could look forward\nwith some satisfaction towards the close of his own career, in having\nbeen the hero of such a love-story. At any rate, if such a story were\nto be his story, the melancholy attached to it should arise from no\nfault of his own. He would still press her to be his wife. And then\nas he remembered that he was only twenty-seven and that she was\ntwenty-four, he began to marvel at the feeling of grey old age which\nhad come upon him, and tried to make himself believe that he would\nhave her yet before the bloom was off her cheek.\n\nHe went into the cottage and made his way at once into the room in\nwhich Lady Julia was sitting. She did not speak at first, but looked\nanxiously into his face. And he did not speak, but turned to a table\nnear the window and took up a book,--though the room was too dark for\nhim to see to read the words. \"John,\" at last said Lady Julia.\n\n\"Well, my lady?\"\n\n\"Have you nothing to tell me, John?\"\n\n\"Nothing on earth,--except the same old story, which has now become a\nmatter of course.\"\n\n\"But, John, will you not tell me what she has said?\"\n\n\"Lady Julia, she has said no; simply no. It is a very easy word to\nsay, and she has said it so often that it seems to come from her\nquite naturally.\" Then he got a candle and sat down over the fire\nwith a volume of a novel. It was not yet past five, and Lady Julia\ndid not go upstairs to dress till six, and therefore there was an\nhour during which they were together. John had at first been rather\ngrand to his old friend, and very uncommunicative. But before the\ndressing bell had rung he had been coaxed into a confidential strain\nand had told everything. \"I suppose it is wrong and selfish,\" he\nsaid. \"I suppose I am a dog in a manger. But I do own that there is a\nconsolation to me in the assurance that she will never be the wife of\nthat scoundrel.\"\n\n\"I could never forgive her if she were to marry him now,\" said Lady\nJulia.\n\n\"I could never forgive him. But she has said that she will not, and I\nknow that she will not forswear herself. I shall go on with it, Lady\nJulia. I have made up my mind to that. I suppose it will never come\nto anything, but I shall stick to it. I can live an old bachelor as\nwell as another man. At any rate I shall stick to it.\" Then the good\nsilly old woman comforted him and applauded him as though he were a\nhero among men, and did reward him, as Lily had predicted, by one of\nthose now rare bottles of superexcellent port which had come to her\nfrom her brother's cellar.\n\nJohn Eames stayed out his time at the cottage, and went over more\nthan once again to Allington, and called on the squire, on one\noccasion dining with him and meeting the three ladies from the Small\nHouse; and he walked with the girls, comporting himself like any\nordinary man. But he was not again alone with Lily Dale, nor did he\nlearn whether she had in truth written those two words in her book.\nBut the reader may know that she did write them there on the evening\nof the day on which the promise was made. \"Lilian Dale,--Old Maid.\"\n\nAnd when John's holiday was over, he returned to his duties at the\nelbow of Sir Raffle Buffle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nGRACE CRAWLEY RETURNS HOME.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAbout this time Grace Crawley received two letters, the first of\nthem reaching her while John Eames was still at the cottage, and\nthe other immediately after his return to London. They both help to\ntell our story, and our reader shall, therefore, read them if he\nso please,--or, rather, he shall read the first and as much of the\nsecond as is necessary for him. Grace's answer to the first letter he\nshall see also. Her answer to the second will be told in a very few\nwords. The first was from Major Grantly, and the task of answering\nthat was by no means easy to Grace.\n\n\n   Cosby Lodge, -- February, 186--.\n\n   DEAREST GRACE,\n\n   I told you when I parted from you, that I should write\n   to you, and I think it best to do so at once, in order\n   that you may fully understand me. Spoken words are soon\n   forgotten,--\n\n\"I shall never forget his words,\" Grace said to herself as she read\nthis;--\n\n   and are not always as plain as they might be. Dear Grace,\n   I suppose I ought not to say so, but I fancied when I\n   parted from you at Allington, that I had succeeded in\n   making myself dear to you. I believe you to be so true in\n   spirit, that you were unable to conceal from me the fact\n   that you love me. I shall believe that this is so, till I\n   am deliberately and solemnly assured by yourself that it\n   is not so;--and I conjure you to think what is due both to\n   yourself and to myself, before you allow yourself to think\n   of making such an assurance unless it be strictly true.\n\n   I have already told my own friends that I have asked you\n   to be my wife. I tell you this, in order that you may\n   know how little effect your answer to me has had towards\n   inducing me to give you up. What you said about your\n   father and your family has no weight with me, and ought\n   ultimately to have none with you. This business of your\n   father's is a great misfortune,--so great that, probably,\n   had we not known each other before it happened, it might\n   have prevented our becoming intimate when we chanced to\n   meet. But we had met before it happened, and before it\n   happened I had determined to ask you to be my wife. What\n   should I have to think of myself if I allowed my heart to\n   be altered by such a cause as that?\n\n   I have only further to say that I love you better than any\n   one in the world, and that it is my best hope that you\n   will be my wife. I will not press you till this affair of\n   your father's has been settled; but when that is over I\n   shall look for my reward without reference to its result.\n   Not that I doubt the result if there be anything like\n   justice in England; but that your debt to me, if you owe\n   me any debt, will be altogether irrespective of that. If,\n   as I suppose, you will remain at Allington for some time\n   longer, I shall not see you till after the trial is over.\n   As soon as that is done, I will come to you wherever you\n   are. In the meantime I shall look for an answer to this;\n   and if it be true that you love me, dear, dear Grace, pray\n   have the courage to tell me so.\n\n   Most affectionately your own,\n\n   HENRY GRANTLY.\n\n\nWhen the letter was given to Grace across the breakfast-table, both\nMrs. Dale and Lily suspected that it came from Major Grantly, but not\na word was spoken about it. When Grace with hesitating hand broke the\nenvelope, neither of her friends looked at her. Lily had a letter\nof her own, and Mrs. Dale opened the newspaper. But still it was\nimpossible not to perceive that her face became red with blushes,\nand then they knew that the letter must be from Major Grantly. Grace\nherself could not read it, though her eye ran down over the two pages\ncatching a word here and a word there. She had looked at the name at\nonce, and had seen the manner of his signature. \"Most affectionately\nyour own!\" What was she to say to him? Twice, thrice, as she sat at\nthe breakfast-table she turned the page of the letter, and at each\nturning she read the signature. And she read the beginning, \"Dearest\nGrace.\" More than that she did not really read till she had got the\nletter away with her into the seclusion of her own room.\n\n[Illustration: She read the beginning--\"Dearest Grace.\"]\n\nNot a word was said about the letter at breakfast. Poor Grace went on\neating or pretending to eat, but could not bring herself to utter a\nword. Mrs. Dale and Lily spoke of various matters, which were quite\nindifferent to them; but even with them the conversation was so\ndifficult that Grace felt it to be forced, and was conscious that\nthey were thinking about her and her lover. As soon as she could make\nan excuse she left the room, and hurrying upstairs took the letter\nfrom her pocket and read it in earnest.\n\n\"That was from Major Grantly, mamma,\" said Lily.\n\n\"I daresay it was, my dear.\"\n\n\"And what had we better do; or what had we better say?\"\n\n\"Nothing,--I should say. Let him fight his own battle. If we\ninterfere, we may probably only make her more stubborn in clinging to\nher old idea.\"\n\n\"I think she will cling to it.\"\n\n\"For a time she will, I daresay. And it will be best that she should.\nHe himself will respect her for it afterwards.\" Thus it was agreed\nbetween them that they should say nothing to Grace about the letter\nunless Grace should first speak to them.\n\nGrace read her letter over and over again. It was the first\nlove-letter she had ever had;--the first letter she had ever received\nfrom any man except her father and brother,--the first, almost, that\nhad ever been written to her by any other than her own old special\nfriends. The words of it were very strange to her ear. He had told\nher when he left her that he would write to her, and therefore she\nhad looked forward to the event which had now come; but she had\nthought that it would be much more distant,--and she had tried to\nmake herself believe that when it did come it would be very different\nfrom this letter which she now possessed. \"He will tell me that he\nhas altered his mind. He ought to do so. It is not proper that he\nshould still think of me when we are in such disgrace.\" But now the\nletter had come, and she acknowledged the truth of his saying that\nwritten words were clearer in their expression than those simply\nspoken. \"Not that I could ever forget a syllable that he said.\" Yet,\nas she held the letter in her hand she felt that it was a possession.\nIt was a thing at which she could look in coming years, when he and\nshe might be far apart,--a thing at which she could look with pride\nin remembering that he had thought her worthy of it.\n\nNeither on that day nor on the next did she think of her answer, nor\non the third or the fourth with any steady thinking. She knew that an\nanswer would have to be written, and she felt that the sooner it was\nwritten the easier might be the writing; but she felt also that it\nshould not be written too quickly. A week should first elapse, she\nthought, and therefore a week was allowed to elapse, and then the day\nfor writing her answer came. She had spoken no word about it either\nto Mrs. Dale or to Lily. She had longed to do so, but had feared.\nEven though she should speak to Lily she could not be led by Lily's\nadvice. Her letter, whatever it might be, must be her own letter. She\nwould admit of no dictation. She must say her own say, let her say it\never so badly. As to the manner of saying it, Lily's aid would have\nbeen invaluable; but she feared that she could not secure that aid\nwithout compromising her own power of action,--her own individuality;\nand therefore she said no word about the letter either to Lily or to\nLily's mother.\n\nOn a certain morning she fixed herself at her desk to write her\nletter. She had known that the task would be difficult, but she had\nlittle known how difficult it would be. On that day of her first\nattempt she did not get it written at all. How was she to begin? He\nhad called her \"Dearest Grace;\" and this mode of beginning seemed as\neasy as it was sweet. \"It is very easy for a gentleman,\" she said to\nherself, \"because he may say just what he pleases.\" She wrote the\nwords, \"Dearest Henry,\" on a scrap of paper, and immediately tore it\ninto fragments as though she were ashamed of having written them. She\nknew that she would not dare to send away a letter beginning with\nsuch words. She would not even have dared to let such words in her\nown handwriting remain within the recesses of her own little desk.\n\"Dear Major Grantly,\" she began at length. It seemed to her to\nbe very ugly, but after much consideration she believed it to be\ncorrect. On the second day the letter was written as follows:--\n\n\n   Allington, Thursday.\n\n   MY DEAR MAJOR GRANTLY,--\n\n   I do not know how I ought to answer your kind letter, but\n   I must tell you that I am very much flattered by your\n   great goodness to me. I cannot understand why you should\n   think so much of me, but I suppose it is because you have\n   felt for all our misfortunes. I will not say anything\n   about what might have happened, if it had not been for\n   papa's sorrow and disgrace; and as far as I can help it,\n   I will not think of it; but I am sure that I ought not to\n   think about loving any one, that is, in the way you mean,\n   while we are in such trouble at home. I should not dare to\n   meet any of your great friends, knowing that I had brought\n   nothing with me but disgrace. And I should feel that I was\n   doing an injury to _dear_ Edith, which would be worse to\n   me than anything.\n\n   Pray believe that I am quite in earnest about this. I know\n   that a gentleman ought not to marry any girl to do himself\n   and his family an injury by it; and I know that if I\n   were to make such a marriage I should be unhappy ever\n   afterwards, even though I loved the man ever so dearly,\n   with all my heart.\n\nThese last words she had underscored at first, but the doing so had\nbeen the unconscious expression of her own affection, and had been\ndone with no desire on her part to convey that expression to him. But\non reading the words she discovered their latent meaning, and wrote\nit all again.\n\n   Therefore I know that it will be best that I should wish\n   you good-by, and I do so, thanking you again and again for\n   your goodness to me.\n\n   Believe me to be,\n   Yours very sincerely,\n\n   GRACE CRAWLEY.\n\n\nThe letter when it was written was hateful to her; but she had\ntried her hand at it again and again, and had found that she could\ndo nothing better. There was much in his letter that she had not\nattempted to answer. He had implored her to tell him whether or no\nshe did in truth love him. Of course she loved him. He knew that well\nenough. Why should she answer any such question? There was a way of\nanswering it indeed which might serve her turn,--or rather serve his,\nof which she was thinking more than of her own. She might say that\nshe did not love him. It would be a lie, and he would know that\nit would be a lie. But still it might serve the turn. She did not\nlike the idea of writing such a lie as that, but nevertheless she\nconsidered the matter. It would be very wicked; but still, if it\nwould serve the turn, might it not be well to write it? But at last\nshe reflected that, after all, the doing of the thing was in her\nown hands. She could refuse to marry this man without burdening her\nconscience with any lie about it. It only required that she should\nbe firm. She abstained, therefore, from the falsehood, and left her\nlover's question unanswered. So she put up her letter and directed\nit, and carried it herself to the village post-office.\n\nOn the day after this she got the second letter, and that she showed\nimmediately to Mrs. Dale. It was from her mother, and was written to\ntell her that her father was seriously ill. \"He went up to London to\nsee a lawyer about this weary work of the trial,\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\"The fatigue was very great, and on the next day he was so weak that\nhe could not leave his bed. Dr. Turner, who has been very kind, says\nthat we need not frighten ourselves, but he thinks it must be some\ntime before he can leave the house. He has a low fever on him, and\nwants nourishment. His mind has wandered once or twice, and he has\nasked for you, and I think it will be best, love, that you should\ncome home. I know you will not mind it when I say that I think he\nwould like to have you here. Dr. Turner says that the illness is\nchiefly owing to his not having proper food.\"\n\nOf course she would go at once. \"Dear Mrs. Dale,\" she said, \"I must\ngo home. Can you send me to the station?\" Then Mrs. Dale read the\nletter. Of course they would send her. Would she go on that day, or\non the next? Might it not be better to write first, and say that she\nwas going? But Grace would go at once. \"I know it will be a comfort\nto mamma; and I know that he is worse than mamma says.\" Of course\nthere was no more to be said, and she was despatched to the station.\nBefore she went Mrs. Dale asked after her purse. \"If there is any\ntrouble about money,--for your journey, or anything, you will not\nscruple to come to me as to an old friend.\" But Grace assured her\nthat there was no trouble about money--for her journey. Then Lily\ntook her aside and produced two clean new five-pound notes. \"Grace,\ndear, you won't be ill-natured. You know I have a little fortune of\nmy own. You know I can give them without missing them.\" Grace threw\nherself into her friend's arms and wept, but would have none of her\nmoney. \"Buy a present from me for your mother,--whom I love though\nI do not know her.\" \"I will give her your love,\" Grace said, \"but\nnothing else.\" And then she went.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nHOOK COURT.\n\n\nMr. Dobbs Broughton and Mr. Musselboro were sitting together on a\ncertain morning at their office in the City, discussing the affairs\nof their joint business. The City office was a very poor place\nindeed, in comparison with the fine house which Mr. Dobbs occupied at\nthe West End; but then City offices are poor places, and there are\ncertain City occupations which seem to enjoy the greater credit the\npoorer are the material circumstances by which they are surrounded.\nTurning out of a lane which turns out of Lombard Street, there is a\ndesolate, forlorn-looking, dark alley, which is called Hook Court.\nThe entrance to this alley is beneath the first-floor of one of the\nhouses in the lane, and in passing under this covered way the visitor\nto the place finds himself in a small paved square court, at the two\nfurther corners of which there are two open doors; for in Hook Court\nthere are only two houses. There is No. 1, Hook Court, and No. 2,\nHook Court. The entire premises indicated by No. 1, are occupied by a\nfirm of wine and spirit merchants, in connexion with whose trade one\nside and two angles of the court are always lumbered with crates,\nhampers, and wooden cases. And nearly in the middle of the court,\nthough somewhat more to the wine-merchants' side than to the other,\nthere is always gaping open a trap-door, leading down to vaults\nbelow; and over the trap there is a great board with a bright\nadvertisement in very large letters:--\n\n   BURTON AND BANGLES.\n   HIMALAYA WINES,\n   22_s._ 6_d._ per dozen.\n\nAnd this notice is so bright and so large, and the trap-door is\nso conspicuous in the court, that no visitor, even to No. 2, ever\nafterwards can quite divest his memory of those names, Burton and\nBangles, Himalaya wines. It may therefore be acknowledged that Burton\nand Bangles have achieved their object in putting up the notice.\nThe house No. 2, small as it seems to be, standing in the jamb of a\ncorner, is divided among different occupiers, whose names are painted\nin small letters upon the very dirty posts of the doorway. Nothing\ncan be more remarkable than the contrast between Burton and Bangles\nand these other City gentlemen in the method taken by them in\ndeclaring their presence to visitors in the court. The names of Dobbs\nBroughton and of A. Musselboro,--the Christian name of Mr. Musselboro\nwas Augustus,--were on one of those dirty posts, not joined together\nby any visible \"and,\" so as to declare boldly that they were\npartners; but in close vicinity,--showing at least that the two\ngentlemen would be found in apartments very near to each other. And\non the first-floor of this house Dobbs Broughton and his friend did\noccupy three rooms,--or rather two rooms and a closet--between them.\nThe larger and front room was tenanted by an old clerk, who sat\nwithin a rail in one corner of it. And there was a broad, short\ncounter which jutted out from the wall into the middle of the room,\nintended for the use of such of the public as might come to transact\nmiscellaneous business with Dobbs Broughton or Augustus Musselboro.\nBut any one accustomed to the look of offices might have seen\nwith half an eye that very little business was ever done on that\ncounter. Behind this large room was a smaller one, belonging to Dobbs\nBroughton, in the furnishing and arrangement of which some regard had\nbeen paid to comfort. The room was carpeted, and there was a sofa\nin it, though a very old one, and two arm-chairs and a mahogany\noffice-table, and a cellaret, which was generally well supplied\nwith wine which Dobbs Broughton did not get out of the vaults of\nhis neighbours, Burton and Bangles. Behind this again, but with a\nseparate entrance from the passage, was the closet; and this closet\nwas specially devoted to the use of Mr. Musselboro. Closet as it\nwas,--or cupboard as it might almost have been called,--it contained\na table and two chairs; and it had a window of its own, which opened\nout upon a blank wall which was distant from it not above four feet.\nAs the house to which this wall belonged was four stories high, it\nwould sometimes happen that Mr. Musselboro's cupboard was rather\ndark. But this mattered the less as in these days Mr. Musselboro\nseldom used it. Mr. Musselboro, who was very constant at his place of\nbusiness,--much more constant than his friend, Dobbs Broughton,--was\ngenerally to be found in his friend's room. Only on some special\noccasions, on which it was thought expedient that the commercial\nworld should be made to understand that Mr. Augustus Musselboro had\nan individual existence of his own, did that gentleman really seat\nhimself in the dark closet. Mr. Dobbs Broughton, had he been asked\nwhat was his trade, would have said that he was a stockbroker; and he\nwould have answered truly, for he was a stockbroker. A man may be a\nstockbroker though he never sells any stock; as he may be a barrister\nthough he has no practice at the bar. I do not say that Mr. Broughton\nnever sold any stock; but the buying and selling of stock for other\npeople was certainly not his chief business. And had Mr. Musselboro\nbeen asked what was his trade, he would have probably given an\nevasive answer. At any rate in the City, and among people who\nunderstood City matters, he would not have said that he was a\nstockbroker. Both Mr. Broughton and Mr. Musselboro bought and sold\na good deal, but it was chiefly on account. The shares which were\nbought and sold very generally did not pass from hand to hand;\nbut the difference in the price of the shares did do so. And then\nthey had another little business between them. They lent money on\ninterest. And in this business there was a third partner, whose name\ndid not appear on the dirty door-post. That third partner was Mrs.\nVan Siever, the mother of Clara Van Siever whom Mr. Conway Dalrymple\nintended to portray as Jael driving a nail into Sisera's head.\n\nOn a certain morning Mr. Broughton and Mr. Musselboro were sitting\ntogether in the office which has been described. They were in Mr.\nBroughton's room, and occupied each an arm-chair on the different\nsides of the fire. Mr. Musselboro was sitting close to the table, on\nwhich a ledger was open before him, and he had a pen and ink before\nhim, as though he had been at work. Dobbs Broughton had a small\nbetting-book in his hand, and was seated with his feet up against the\nside of the fireplace. Both men wore their hats, and the aspect of\nthe room was not the aspect of a place of business. They had been\nsilent for some minutes when Broughton took his cigar-case out of his\npocket, and nibbled off the end of a cigar, preparatory to lighting\nit.\n\n\"You had better not smoke here this morning, Dobbs,\" said Musselboro.\n\n\"Why shouldn't I smoke in my own room?\"\n\n\"Because she'll be here just now.\"\n\n\"What do I care? If you think I'm going to be afraid of Mother Van,\nyou're mistaken. Let come what may, I'm not going to live under her\nthumb.\" So he lighted his cigar.\n\n\"All right,\" said Musselboro, and he took up his pen and went to work\nat his book.\n\n\"What is she coming here for this morning?\" asked Broughton.\n\n\"To look after her money. What should she come for?\"\n\n\"She gets her interest. I don't suppose there's better paid money in\nthe City.\"\n\n\"She hasn't got what was coming to her at Christmas yet.\"\n\n\"And this is February. What would she have? She had better put her\ndirty money into the three per cents., if she is frightened at having\nto wait a week or two.\"\n\n\"Can she have it to-day?\"\n\n\"What, the whole of it? Of course she can't. You know that as well as\nI do. She can have four hundred pounds, if she wants it. But seeing\nall she gets out of the concern, she has no right to press for it in\nthat way. She is the ---- old usurer I ever came across in my life.\"\n\n\"Of course she likes her money.\"\n\n\"Likes her money! By George she does; her own and anybody else's that\nshe can get hold of. For a downright leech, recommend me always to a\nwoman. When a woman does go in for it, she is much more thorough than\nany man.\" Then Broughton turned over the little pages of his book,\nand Musselboro pondered over the big pages of his book, and there was\nsilence for a quarter of an hour.\n\n\"There's something about nine hundred and fifteen pounds due to her,\"\nsaid Musselboro.\n\n\"I daresay there is.\"\n\n\"It would be a very good thing to let her have it if you've got it.\nThe whole of it this morning, I mean.\"\n\n\"If! yes, if!\" said Broughton.\n\n\"I know there's more than that at the bank.\"\n\n\"And I'm to draw out every shilling that there is! I'll see Mother\nVan--further first. She can have \u00c2\u00a3500 if she likes it,--and the\nrest in a fortnight. Or she can have my note-of-hand for it all at\nfourteen days.\"\n\n\"She won't like that at all,\" said Musselboro.\n\n\"Then she must lump it. I'm not going to bother myself about her.\nI've pretty nearly as much money in it as she has, and we're in a\nboat together. If she comes here bothering, you'd better tell her\nso.\"\n\n\"You'll see her yourself?\"\n\n\"Not unless she comes within the next ten minutes. I must go down to\nthe court. I said I'd be there by twelve. I've got somebody I want to\nsee.\"\n\n\"I'd stay if I were you.\"\n\n\"Why should I stay for her? If she thinks that I'm going to make\nmyself her clerk, she's mistaken. It may be all very well for you,\nMussy, but it won't do for me. I'm not dependent on her, and I don't\nwant to marry her daughter.\"\n\n\"It will simply end in her demanding to have her money back again.\"\n\n\"And how will she get it?\" said Dobbs Broughton. \"I haven't a doubt\nin life but she'd take it to-morrow if she could put her hands upon\nit. And then, after a bit, when she began to find that she didn't\nlike four per cent., she'd bring it back again. But nobody can do\nbusiness after such a fashion as that. For the last three years she's\ndrawn close upon two thousand a year for less than eighteen thousand\npounds. When a woman wants to do that, she can't have her money in\nher pocket every Monday morning.\"\n\n\"But you've done better than that yourself, Dobbs.\"\n\n\"Of course I have. And who has made the connexion; and who has done\nthe work? I suppose she doesn't think that I'm to have all the sweat\nand that she is to have all the profit.\"\n\n\"If you talk of work, Dobbs, it is I that have done the most of it.\"\nThis Mr. Musselboro said in a very serious voice, and with a look of\nmuch reproach.\n\n\"And you've been paid for what you've done. Come, Mussy, you'd better\nnot turn against me. You'll never get your change out of that. Even\nif you marry the daughter, that won't give you the mother's money.\nShe'll stick to every shilling of it till she dies; and she'd take\nit with her then, if she knew how.\" Having said this, he got up from\nhis chair, put his little book into his pocket, and walked out of\nthe office. He pushed his way across the court, which was more than\nordinarily crowded with the implements of Burton and Bangles' trade,\nand as he passed under the covered way he encountered at the entrance\nan old woman getting out of a cab. The old woman was, of course,\nMother Van, as her partner, Mr. Dobbs Broughton, irreverently called\nher. \"Mrs. Van Siever, how d'ye do? Let me give you a hand. Fare from\nSouth Kensington? I always give the fellows three shillings.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me it's six miles!\" And she tendered a florin\nto the man.\n\n\"Can't take that, ma'am,\" said the cabman.\n\n\"Can't take it! But you must take it. Broughton, just get a\npoliceman, will you?\" Dobbs Broughton satisfied the driver out of his\nown pocket, and the cab was driven away. \"What did you give him?\"\nsaid Mrs. Van Siever.\n\n\"Just another sixpence. There never is a policeman anywhere about\nhere.\"\n\n\"It'll be out of your own pocket, then,\" said Mrs. Van. \"But you're\nnot going away?\"\n\n\"I must be at Capel Court by half-past twelve;--I must, indeed. If it\nwasn't real business, I'd stay.\"\n\n\"I told Musselboro I should be here.\"\n\n\"He's up there, and he knows all about the business just as well as\nI do. When I found that I couldn't stay for you, I went through the\naccount with him, and it's all settled. Good morning. I'll see you at\nthe West End in a day or two.\" Then he made his way out into Lombard\nStreet, and Mrs. Van Siever picked her steps across the yard, and\nmounted the stairs, and made her way into the room in which Mr.\nMusselboro was sitting.\n\n\"Somebody's been smoking, Gus,\" she said, almost as soon as she had\nentered the room.\n\n\"That's nothing new here,\" he replied, as he got up from his chair.\n\n\"There's no good being done when men sit and smoke over their work.\nIs it you, or he, or both of you?\"\n\n\"Well;--it was Broughton was smoking just now. I don't smoke of a\nmorning myself.\"\n\n\"What made him get up and run away when I came?\"\n\n\"How can I tell, Mrs. Van Siever,\" said Musselboro, laughing. \"If he\ndid run away when you came, I suppose it was because he didn't want\nto see you.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't he want to see me? Gus, I expect the truth from\nyou. How are things going on here?\" To this question Mr. Musselboro\nmade no immediate answer; but tilted himself back in his chair and\ntook his hat off, and put his thumbs into the arm-holes of his\nwaistcoat, and looked his patroness full in the face. \"Gus,\" she\nsaid again, \"I do expect the truth from you. How are things going on\nhere?\"\n\n\"There'd be a good business,--if he'd only keep things together.\"\n\n\"But he's idle. Isn't he idle?\"\n\n\"Confoundedly idle,\" said Musselboro.\n\n\"And he drinks;--don't he drink in the day?\"\n\n\"Like the mischief,--some days. But that isn't the worst of it.\"\n\n\"And what is the worst of it?\"\n\n\"Newmarket;--that's the rock he's going to pieces on.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say he takes the money out of the business\nfor that?\" And Mrs. Van Siever's face, as she asked the question,\nexpressed almost a tragic horror. \"If I thought that I wouldn't give\nhim an hour's mercy.\"\n\n\"When a man bets he doesn't well know what money he uses. I can't say\nthat he takes money that is not his own. Situated as I am, I don't\nknow what is his own and what isn't. If your money was in my name I\ncould keep a hand on it;--but as it is not I can do nothing. I can\nsee that what is put out is put out fairly well; and when I think of\nit, Mrs. Van Siever, it is quite wonderful that we've lost so little.\nIt has been next to nothing. That has been my doing;--and that's\nabout all that I can do.\"\n\n\"You must know whether he has used my money for his own purposes or\nnot.\"\n\n\"If you ask me, I think he has,\" said Mr. Musselboro.\n\n\"Then I'll go into it, and I'll find it out, and if it is so, as\nsure as my name's Van Siever, I'll sew him up.\" Having uttered which\nterrible threat, the old woman drew a chair to the table and seated\nherself fairly down, as though she were determined to go through all\nthe books of the office before she quitted that room. Mrs. Van Siever\nin her present habiliments was not a thing so terrible to look at as\nshe had been in her wiggeries at Mrs. Dobbs Broughton's dinner-table.\nHer curls were laid aside altogether, and she wore simply a front\nbeneath her close bonnet,--and a very old front, too, which was not\nloudly offensive because it told no lies. Her eyes were as bright,\nand her little wizen face was as sharp, as ever; but the wizen face\nand the bright eyes were not so much amiss as seen together with\nthe old dark brown silk dress which she now wore, as they had been\nwith the wiggeries and the evening finery. Even now, in her morning\ncostume, in her work-a-day business dress, as we may call it, she\nlooked to be very old,--so old that nobody could guess her age.\nPeople attempting to guess would say that she must be at least over\neighty. And yet she was wiry, and strong, and nimble. It was not\nbecause she was feeble that she was thought to be so old. They who so\njudged of her were led to their opinion by the extreme thinness of\nher face, and by the brightness of her eyes, joined to the depth of\nthe hollows in which they lay, and the red margin by which they were\nsurrounded. It was not really the fact that Mrs. Van Siever was so\nvery aged, for she had still some years to live before she would\nreach eighty, but that she was such a weird old woman, so small, so\nghastly, and so ugly! \"I'll sew him up, if he's been robbing me,\" she\nsaid. \"I will, indeed.\" And she stretched out her hand to grab at the\nledger which Musselboro had been using.\n\n\"You won't understand anything from that,\" said he, pushing the book\nover to her.\n\n\"You can explain it to me.\"\n\n\"That's all straight sailing, that is.\"\n\n\"And where does he keep the figures that ain't straight sailing?\nThat's the book I want to see.\"\n\n\"There is no such book.\"\n\n\"Look here, Gus,--if I find you deceiving me I'll throw you overboard\nas sure as I'm a living woman. I will indeed. I'll have no mercy.\nI've stuck to you, and made a man of you, and I expect you to stick\nto me.\"\n\n\"Not much of a man,\" said Musselboro, with a touch of scorn in his\nvoice.\n\n\"You've never had a shilling yet but what I gave you.\"\n\n\"Yes; I have. I've had what I've worked for,--and worked confounded\nhard too.\"\n\n\"Look here, Musselboro; if you're going to throw me over, just tell\nme so, and let us begin fair.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to throw you over. I've always been on the square with\nyou. Why don't you trust me out and out, and then I could do a deal\nbetter for you. You ask me now about your money. I don't know about\nyour money, Mrs. Van Siever. How am I to know anything about your\nmoney, Mrs. Van Siever? You don't give me any power of keeping a\nhand upon Dobbs Broughton. I suppose you have security from Dobbs\nBroughton, but I don't know what security you have, Mrs. Van Siever.\nHe owes you now \u00c2\u00a3915 16_s._ 2_d._ on last year's account!\"\n\n\"Why doesn't he give me a cheque for the money?\"\n\n\"He says he can't spare it. You may have \u00c2\u00a3500, and the rest when he\ncan give it you. Or he'll give you his note-of-hand at fourteen days\nfor the whole.\"\n\n\"Bother his note-of-hand. Why should I take his note-of-hand?\"\n\n\"Do as you like, Mrs. Van Siever.\"\n\n\"It's the interest on my own money. Why don't he give it me? I\nsuppose he has had it.\"\n\n\"You must ask him that, Mrs. Van Siever. You're in partnership with\nhim, and he can tell you. Nobody else knows anything about it. If you\nwere in partnership with me, then of course I could tell you. But\nyou're not. You've never trusted me, Mrs. Van Siever.\"\n\nThe lady remained there closeted with Mr. Musselboro for an hour\nafter that, and did, I think, at length learn something more as to\nthe details of her partner's business, than her faithful servant Mr.\nMusselboro had at first found himself able to give to her. And at\nlast they came to friendly and confidential terms, in the midst\nof which the personal welfare of Mr. Dobbs Broughton was, I fear,\nsomewhat forgotten. Not that Mr. Musselboro palpably and plainly\nthrew his friend overboard. He took his friend's part,--alleging\nexcuses for him, and pleading some facts. \"Of course, you know, a man\nlike that is fond of pleasure, Mrs. Van Siever. He's been at it more\nor less all his life. I don't suppose he ever missed a Derby or an\nOaks, or the cup at Ascot, or the Goodwood in his life.\" \"He'll have\nto miss them before long, I'm thinking,\" said Mrs. Van Siever. \"And\nas to not cashing up, you must remember, Mrs. Van Siever, that ten\nper cent. won't come in quite as regularly as four or five. When you\ngo for high interest, there must be hitches here and there. There\nmust, indeed, Mrs. Van Siever.\" \"I know all about it,\" said Mrs. Van\nSiever. \"If he gave it me as soon as he got it himself, I shouldn't\ncomplain. Never mind. He's only got to give me my little bit of money\nout of the business, and then he and I will be all square. You come\nand see Clara this evening, Gus.\"\n\nThen Mr. Musselboro put Mrs. Van Siever into another cab, and\nwent out upon 'Change,--hanging about the Bank, and standing in\nThreadneedle Street, talking to other men just like himself. When he\nsaw Dobbs Broughton he told that gentleman that Mrs. Van Siever had\nbeen in her tantrums, but that he had managed to pacify her before\nshe left Hook Court. \"I'm to take her the cheque for the five hundred\nto-night,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nJAEL.\n\n\nOn the first of March, Conway Dalrymple's easel was put up in Mrs.\nDobbs Broughton's boudoir upstairs, the canvas was placed upon it\non which the outlines of Jael and Sisera had been already drawn,\nand Mrs. Broughton and Clara Van Siever and Conway Dalrymple were\nassembled with the view of steady art-work. But before we see how\nthey began their work together, we will go back for a moment to John\nEames on his return to his London lodgings. The first thing every\nman does when he returns home after an absence, is to look at his\nletters, and John Eames looked at his. There were not very many.\nThere was a note marked immediate, from Sir Raffle Buffle, in which\nSir R. had scrawled in four lines a notification that he should be\ndriven to an extremity of inconvenience if Eames were not at his post\nat half-past nine on the following morning. \"I think I see myself\nthere at that hour,\" said John. There was a notification of a house\ndinner, which he was asked to join, at his club, and a card for an\nevening gathering at Lady Glencora Palliser's,--procured for him by\nhis friend Conway,--and an invitation to dinner at the house of his\nuncle, Mr. Toogood; and there was a scented note in the handwriting\nof a lady, which he did not recognize. \"My nearest and dearest\nfriend, M. D. M.,\" he said, as he opened the note and looked at the\nsignature. Then he read the letter from Miss Demolines.\n\n\n   MY DEAR MR. EAMES,\n\n   Pray come to me at once. I know that you are to be back\n   to-morrow. Do not lose an hour if you can help it. I shall\n   be at home at half-past five. I fear what you know of has\n   been begun. But it certainly shall not go on. In one way\n   or another it must be prevented. I won't say another word\n   till I see you, but pray come at once.\n\n   Yours always,\n\n   M. D. M.\n\n   Thursday.\n\n   Poor mamma isn't very well, so you had better ask for me.\n\n\n\"Beautiful!\" said Johnny, as he read the note. \"There's nothing I\nlike so much as a mystery,--especially if it's about nothing. I\nwonder why she is so desperately anxious that the picture should not\nbe painted. I'd ask Dalrymple, only I should spoil the mystery.\" Then\nhe sat himself down, and began to think of Lily. There could be no\ntreason to Lily in his amusing himself with the freaks of such a\nwoman as Miss Demolines.\n\nAt eleven o'clock on the morning of the 1st of March,--the day\nfollowing that on which Miss Demolines had written her note,--the\neasel was put up and the canvas was placed on it in Mrs. Broughton's\nroom. Mrs. Broughton and Clara were both there, and when they had\nseen the outlines as far as it had been drawn, they proceeded to make\narrangements for their future operations. The period of work was to\nbegin always at eleven, and was to be continued for an hour and a\nhalf or for two hours on the days on which they met. I fear that\nthere was a little improper scheming in this against the two persons\nwhom the ladies were bound to obey. Mr. Dobbs Broughton invariably\nleft his house soon after ten in the morning. It would sometimes\nhappen, though not frequently, that he returned home early in the\nday,--at four perhaps, or even before that; and should he chance to\ndo so while the picture was going on, he would catch them at their\nwork if the work were postponed till after luncheon. And then again,\nMrs. Van Siever would often go out in the morning, and when she did\nso, would always go without her daughter. On such occasions she went\ninto the City, or to other resorts of business, at which, in some\nmanner quite unintelligible to her daughter, she looked after her\nmoney. But when she did not go out in the morning, she did go out\nin the afternoon, and she would then require her daughter's company.\nThere was some place to which she always went of a Friday morning,\nand at which she stayed for two or three hours. Friday therefore was\na fitting day on which to begin the work at Mrs. Broughton's house.\nAll this was explained between the three conspirators. Mrs. Dobbs\nBroughton declared that if she entertained the slightest idea that\nher husband would object to the painting of the picture in her room,\nnothing on earth would induce her to lend her countenance to it; but\nyet it might be well not to tell him just at first, perhaps not till\nthe sittings were over,--perhaps not till the picture was finished;\nas, otherwise, tidings of the picture might get round to ears which\nwere not intended to hear it. \"Poor dear Dobbs is so careless with a\nsecret.\" Miss Van Siever explained her motives in a very different\nway. \"I know mamma would not let me do it if she knew it; and\ntherefore I shall not tell her.\" \"My dear Clara,\" said Mrs. Broughton\nwith a smile, \"you are so outspoken!\" \"And why not?\" said Miss Van\nSiever. \"I am old enough to judge for myself. If mamma does not want\nto be deceived, she ought not to treat me like a child. Of course\nshe'll find it out sooner or later; but I don't care about that.\"\nConway Dalrymple said nothing as the two ladies were thus excusing\nthemselves. \"How delightful it must be not to have a master,\" said\nMrs. Broughton, addressing him. \"But then a man has to work for his\nown bread,\" said he. \"I suppose it comes about equal in the long\nrun.\"\n\nVery little drawing or painting was done on that day. In the first\nplace it was necessary that the question of costume should be\nsettled, and both Mrs. Broughton and the artist had much to say on\nthe subject. It was considered proper that Jael should be dressed as\na Jewess, and there came to be much question how Jewesses dressed\nthemselves in those very early days. Mrs. Broughton had prepared her\njewels and raiment of many colours, but the painter declared that\nthe wife of Heber the Kenite would have no jewels. But when Mrs.\nBroughton discovered from her Bible that Heber had been connected by\nfamily ties with Moses, she was more than ever sure that Heber's wife\nwould have in her tent much of the spoilings of the Egyptians. And\nwhen Clara Van Siever suggested that at any rate she would not have\nworn them in a time of confusion when soldiers were loose, flying\nabout the country, Mrs. Broughton was quite confident that she would\nhave put them on before she invited the captain of the enemy's host\ninto her tent. The artist at last took the matter into his own hand\nby declaring that Miss Van Siever would sit the subject much better\nwithout jewels, and therefore all Mrs. Broughton's gewgaws were put\nback into their boxes. And then on four different times the two\nladies had to retire into Mrs. Broughton's room in order that Jael\nmight be arrayed in various costumes,--and in each costume she had to\nkneel down, taking the hammer in her hand, and holding the pointed\nstick which had been prepared to do duty as the nail, upon the\nforehead of a dummy Sisera. At last it was decided that her raiment\nshould be altogether white, and that she should wear, twisted round\nher head and falling over her shoulder, a Roman silk scarf of various\ncolours. \"Where Jael could have gotten it I don't know,\" said Clara.\n\"You may be sure that there were lots of such things among the\nEgyptians,\" said Mrs. Broughton, \"and that Moses brought away all the\nbest for his own family.\"\n\n\"And who is to be Sisera?\" asked Mrs. Broughton in one of the pauses\nin their work.\n\n\"I'm thinking of asking my friend John Eames to sit.\"\n\n\"Of course we cannot sit together,\" said Miss Van Siever.\n\n\"There's no reason why you should,\" said Dalrymple. \"I can do the\nsecond figure in my own room.\" Then there was a bargain made that\nSisera should not be a portrait. \"It would never do,\" said Mrs.\nBroughton, shaking her head very gravely.\n\nThough there was really very little done to the picture on that day,\nthe work was commenced; and Mrs. Broughton, who had at first objected\nstrongly to the idea, and who had said twenty times that it was quite\nout of the question that it should be done in her house, became very\neager in her delight about it. Nobody should know anything of the\npicture till it should be exhibited. That would be best. And it\nshould be the picture of the year! She was a little heart-broken when\nDalrymple assured her that it could not possibly be finished for\nexhibition in that May; but she came to again when he declared that\nhe meant to put out all his strength upon it. \"There will be five or\nsix months' work in it,\" he said. \"Will there, indeed? And how much\nwork was there in 'The Graces'?\" \"The Graces,\" as will perhaps be\nremembered, was the triple portrait of Mrs. Dobbs Broughton herself.\nThis question the artist did not answer with absolute accuracy, but\ncontented himself with declaring that with such a model as Mrs.\nBroughton the picture had been comparatively easy.\n\nMrs. Broughton, having no doubt that ultimate object of which she had\nspoken to her friend Conway steadily in view, took occasion before\nthe sitting was over to leave the room, so that the artist might have\nan opportunity of speaking a word in private to his model,--if he had\nany such word to speak. And Mrs. Broughton, as she did this, felt\nthat she was doing her duty as a wife, a friend, and a Christian. She\nwas doing her duty as a wife, because she was giving the clearest\nproof in the world,--the clearest at any rate to herself,--that the\nintimacy between herself and her friend Conway had in it nothing that\nwas improper. And she was doing her duty as a friend, because Clara\nVan Siever, with her large expectations, would be an eligible wife.\nAnd she was doing her duty as a Christian, because the whole thing\nwas intended to be moral. Miss Demolines had declared that her\nfriend Maria Clutterbuck,--as Miss Demolines delighted to call Mrs.\nBroughton, in memory of dear old innocent days,--had high principles;\nand the reader will see that she was justified in her declaration.\n\"It will be better so,\" said Mrs. Broughton, as she sat upon her bed\nand wiped a tear from the corner of her eye. \"Yes; it will be better\nso. There is a pang. Of course there's a pang. But it will be better\nso.\" Acting upon this high principle, she allowed Conway Dalrymple\nfive minutes to say what he had to say to Clara Van Siever. Then she\nallowed herself to indulge in some very savage feelings in reference\nto her husband,--accusing her husband in her thoughts of great\ncruelty,--nay, of brutality, because of certain sharp words that he\nhad said as to Conway Dalrymple. \"But of course he can't understand,\"\nsaid Mrs. Broughton to herself. \"How is it to be expected that he\nshould understand?\"\n\nBut she allowed her friend on this occasion only five minutes,\nthinking probably that so much time might suffice. A woman, when she\nis jealous, is apt to attribute to the other woman with whom her\njealousy is concerned, both weakness and timidity, and to the man\nboth audacity and strength. A woman who has herself taken perhaps\ntwelve months in the winning, will think that another woman is to\nbe won in five minutes. It is not to be supposed that Mrs. Dobbs\nBroughton had ever been won by any one except by Mr. Dobbs Broughton.\nAt least, let it not be supposed that she had ever acknowledged a\nspark of love for Conway Dalrymple. But nevertheless there was enough\nof jealousy in her present mood to make her think poorly of Miss\nVan Siever's capacity for standing a siege against the artist's\neloquence. Otherwise, having left the two together with the object\nwhich she had acknowledged to herself, she would hardly have returned\nto them after so very short an interval.\n\n\"I hope you won't dislike the trouble of all this?\" said Dalrymple to\nhis model, as soon as Mrs. Broughton was gone.\n\n\"I cannot say that I like it very much,\" said Miss Van Siever.\n\n\"I'm afraid it will be a bore;--but I hope you'll go through with\nit.\"\n\n\"I shall if I am not prevented,\" said Miss Van Siever. \"When I've\nsaid that I'll do a thing, I like to do it.\"\n\nThere was a pause in the conversation which took up a considerable\nportion of the five minutes. Miss Van Siever was not holding her nail\nduring these moments, but was sitting in a commonplace way on her\nchair, while Dalrymple was scraping his palette. \"I wonder what it\nwas that first induced you to sit?\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. I took a fancy for it.\"\n\n\"I'm very glad you did take the fancy. You'll make an excellent\nmodel. If you won't mind posing again for a few minutes--I will not\nweary you to-day. Your right arm a little more forward.\"\n\n\"But I should tumble down.\"\n\n\"Not if you lean well on to the nail.\"\n\n\"But that would have woken Sisera before she had struck a blow.\"\n\n\"Never mind that. Let us try it.\" Then Mrs. Broughton returned, with\nthat pleasant feeling in her bosom of having done her duty as a wife,\na friend, and a Christian. \"Mrs. Broughton,\" continued the painter,\n\"just steady Miss Van Siever's shoulder with your hand; and now bring\nthe arm and the elbow a little more forward.\"\n\n\"But Jael did not have a friend to help her in that way,\" said Miss\nVan Siever.\n\nAt the end of an hour and a half the two ladies retired, and Jael\ndisrobed herself, and Miss Van Siever put on her customary raiment.\nIt was agreed among them that they had commenced their work\nauspiciously, and that they would meet again on the following Monday.\nThe artist begged to be allowed an hour to go on with his work in\nMrs. Broughton's room, and the hour was conceded to him. It was\nunderstood that he could not take the canvas backwards and forwards\nwith him to his own house, and he pointed out that no progress\nwhatever could be made, unless he were occasionally allowed some\nsuch grace as this. Mrs. Broughton doubted and hesitated, made\ndifficulties, and lifted up her hands in despair. \"It is easy for\nyou to say, Why not? but I know very well why not.\" But at last she\ngave way. \"Honi soit qui mal y pense,\" she said; \"that must be my\nprotection.\" So she followed Miss Van Siever downstairs, leaving Mr.\nDalrymple in possession of her boudoir. \"I shall give you just one\nhour,\" she said, \"and then I shall come and turn you out.\" So she\nwent down, and, as Miss Van Siever would not stay to lunch with her,\nshe ate her lunch by herself, sending a glass of sherry and a biscuit\nup to the poor painter at his work.\n\nExactly at the end of the hour she returned to him. \"Now, Conway, you\nmust go,\" she said.\n\n\"But why in such a hurry?\"\n\n\"Because I say that it must be so. When I say so, pray let that be\nsufficient.\" But still Dalrymple went on working. \"Conway,\" she said,\n\"how can you treat me with so much disdain?\"\n\n\"Disdain, Mrs. Broughton!\"\n\n\"Yes, disdain. Have I not begged you to understand that I cannot\nallow you to remain here, and yet you pay no attention to my wishes.\"\n\n\"I have done now;\" and he began to put his brushes and paints\ntogether. \"I suppose all these things may remain here?\"\n\n\"Yes; they may remain. They must do so, of course. There; if you will\nput the easel in the corner, with the canvas behind it, they will not\nbe seen if he should chance to come into the room.\"\n\n\"He would not be angry, I suppose, if he saw them?\"\n\n\"There is no knowing. Men are so unreasonable. All men are, I think.\nAll those are whom I have had the fortune to know. Women generally\nsay that men are selfish. I do not complain so much that they are\nselfish as that they are thoughtless. They are headstrong and do not\nlook forward to results. Now you,--I do not think you would willingly\ndo me an injury?\"\n\n\"I do not think I would.\"\n\n\"I am sure you would not;--but yet you would forget to save me from\none.\"\n\n\"What injury?\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind. I am not thinking of anything in particular. From\nmyself, for instance. But we will not talk about that. That way\nmadness lies. Tell me, Conway;--what do you think of Clara Van\nSiever?\"\n\n\"She is very handsome, certainly.\"\n\n\"And clever?\"\n\n\"Decidedly clever. I should think she has a temper of her own.\"\n\n\"What woman is there worth a straw that has not? If Clara Van Siever\nwere ill-used, she would resent it. I do not doubt that for a moment.\nI should not like to be the man who would do it.\"\n\n\"Nor I, either,\" said Conway.\n\n\"But there is plenty of feminine softness in that character, if she\nwere treated with love and kindness. Conway, if you will take my\nadvice you will ask Clara Van Siever to be your wife. But perhaps you\nhave already.\"\n\n\"Who; I?\"\n\n\"Yes; you.\"\n\n\"I have not done it yet, certainly, Mrs. Broughton.\"\n\n\"And why should you not do it?\"\n\n\"There are two or three reasons;--but perhaps none of any great\nimportance. Do you know of none, Mrs. Broughton?\"\n\n\"I know of none,\" said Mrs. Broughton in a very serious,--in almost a\ntragic tone;--\"of none that should weigh for a moment. As far as I am\nconcerned, nothing would give me more pleasure.\"\n\n\"That is so kind of you!\"\n\n\"I mean to be kind. I do, indeed, Conway. I know it will be better\nfor you that you should be settled,--very much better. And it will be\nbetter for me. I do not mind admitting that;--though in saying so I\ntrust greatly to your generosity to interpret my words properly.\"\n\n\"I shall not flatter myself, if you mean that.\"\n\n\"There is no question of flattery, Conway. The question is simply of\ntruth and prudence. Do you not know that it would be better that you\nshould be married?\"\n\n\"Not unless a certain gentleman were to die first,\" said Conway\nDalrymple, as he deposited the last of his painting paraphernalia in\nthe recess which had been prepared for them by Mrs. Broughton.\n\n\"Conway, how can you speak in that wicked, wicked way!\"\n\n\"I can assure you I do not wish the gentleman in question the\nslightest harm in the world. If his welfare depended on me, he should\nbe as safe as the Bank of England.\"\n\n\"And you will not take my advice?\"\n\n\"What advice?\"\n\n\"About Clara?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Broughton, matrimony is a very important thing.\"\n\n\"Indeed, it is;--oh, who can say how important! There was a time,\nConway, when I thought you had given your heart to Madalina\nDemolines.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\"\n\n\"And I grieved, because I thought that she was not worthy of you.\"\n\n\"There was never anything in that, Mrs. Broughton.\"\n\n\"She thought that there was. At any rate, she said so. I know that\nfor certain. She told me so herself. But let that pass. Clara Van\nSiever is in every respect very different from Madalina. Clara, I\nthink, is worthy of you. And Conway,--of course it is not for me\nto dictate to you; but this I must tell you--\" Then she paused, as\nthough she did not know how to finish her sentence.\n\n\"What must you tell me?\"\n\n\"I will tell you nothing more. If you cannot understand what I have\nsaid, you must be more dull of comprehension than I believe you to\nbe. Now go. Why are you not gone this half-hour?\"\n\n\"How could I go while you were giving me all this good advice?\"\n\n\"I have not asked you to stay. Go now, at any rate. And, remember,\nConway, if this picture is to go on, I will not have you remaining\nhere after the work is done. Will you remember that?\" And she held\nhim by the hand while he declared that he would remember it.\n\nMrs. Dobbs Broughton was no more in love with Conway Dalrymple than\nshe was in love with King Charles on horseback at Charing Cross.\nAnd, over and beyond the protection which came to her in the course\nof nature from unimpassioned feelings in this special phase of her\nlife,--and indeed, I may say, in every phase of her life,--it must be\nacknowledged on her behalf that she did enjoy that protection which\ncomes from what we call principle,--though the principle was not\nperhaps very high of its kind. Madalina Demolines had been right when\nshe talked of her friend Maria's principles. Dobbs Broughton had been\nso far lucky in that jump in the dark which he had made in taking a\nwife to himself, that he had not fallen upon a really vicious woman,\nor upon a woman of strong feeling. If it had come to be the lot of\nMrs. Dobbs Broughton to have six hours' work to do every day of her\nlife, I think that the work would have been done badly, but that it\nwould have kept her free from all danger. As it was she had nothing\nto do. She had no child. She was not given to much reading. She could\nnot sit with a needle in her hand all day. She had no aptitude for\nMay meetings, or the excitement of charitable good works. Life with\nher was very dull, and she found no amusement within her reach so\neasy and so pleasant as the amusement of pretending to be in love. If\nall that she did and all that she said could only have been taken for\nits worth and for nothing more, by the different persons concerned,\nthere was very little in it to flatter Mr. Dalrymple or to give cause\nfor tribulation to Mr. Broughton. She probably cared but little for\neither of them. She was one of those women to whom it is not given by\nnature to care very much for anybody. But, of the two, she certainly\ncared the most for Mr. Dobbs Broughton,--because Mr. Dobbs Broughton\nbelonged to her. As to leaving Mr. Dobbs Broughton's house, and\nputting herself into the hands of another man,--no Imogen of a wife\nwas ever less likely to take a step so wicked, so dangerous, and so\ngenerally disagreeable to all the parties concerned.\n\nBut Conway Dalrymple,--though now and again he had got a side glance\nat her true character with clear-seeing eyes,--did allow himself to\nbe flattered and deceived. He knew that she was foolish and ignorant,\nand that she often talked wonderful nonsense. He knew also that she\nwas continually contradicting herself,--as when she would strenuously\nbeg him to leave her, while she would continue to talk to him\nin a strain that prevented the possibility of his going. But,\nnevertheless, he was flattered, and he did believe that she loved\nhim. As to his love for her,--he knew very well that it amounted to\nnothing. Now and again, perhaps twice a week, if he saw her as often,\nhe would say something which would imply a declaration of affection.\nHe felt that as much as that was expected from him, and that he\nought not to hope to get off cheaper. And now that this little\nplay was going on about Miss Van Siever, he did think that Mrs.\nDobbs Broughton was doing her very best to overcome an unfortunate\nattachment. It is so gratifying to a young man's feelings to suppose\nthat another man's wife has conceived an unfortunate attachment for\nhim! Conway Dalrymple ought not to have been fooled by such a woman;\nbut I fear that he was fooled by her.\n\nAs he returned home to-day from Mrs. Broughton's house to his own\nlodgings he rambled out for a while into Kensington Gardens, and\nthought of his position seriously. \"I don't see why I should not\nmarry her,\" he said to himself, thinking of course of Miss Van\nSiever. \"If Maria is not in earnest it is not my fault. And it would\nbe my wish that she should be in earnest. If I suppose her to be so,\nand take her at her word, she can have no right to quarrel with me.\nPoor Maria! at any rate it will be better for her, for no good can\ncome of this kind of thing. And, by heavens, with a woman like that,\nof strong feelings, one never knows what may happen.\" And then he\nthought of the condition he would be in, if he were to find her some\nfine day in his own rooms, and if she were to tell him that she could\nnot go home again, and that she meant to remain with him!\n\nIn the meantime Mrs. Dobbs Broughton had gone down into her own\ndrawing-room, had tucked herself up on the sofa, and had fallen fast\nasleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nA NEW FLIRTATION.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nJohn Eames sat at his office on the day after his return to London,\nand answered the various letters which he had found waiting for him\nat his lodgings on the previous evening. To Miss Demolines he had\nalready written from his club,--a single line, which he considered to\nbe appropriate to the mysterious necessities of the occasion. \"I will\nbe with you at a quarter to six to-morrow.--J. E. Just returned.\"\nThere was not another word; and as he scrawled it at one of the club\ntables while two or three men were talking to him, he felt rather\nproud of his correspondence. \"It was capital fun,\" he said; \"and\nafter all,\"--the \"all\" on this occasion being Lily Dale, and the\nsadness of his disappointment at Allington,--\"after all, let a fellow\nbe ever so down in the mouth, a little amusement should do him good.\"\nAnd he reflected further that the more a fellow be \"down in the\nmouth,\" the more good the amusement would do him. He sent off his\nnote, therefore, with some little inward rejoicing,--and a word or\ntwo also of spoken rejoicing. \"What fun women are sometimes,\" he\nsaid to one of his friends,--a friend with whom he was very intimate,\ncalling him always Fred, and slapping his back, but whom he never by\nany chance saw out of his club.\n\n\"What's up now, Johnny? Some good fortune?\"\n\n\"Good fortune; no. I never have good fortunes of that kind. But I've\ngot hold of a young woman,--or rather a young woman has got hold of\nme, who insists on having a mystery with me. In the mystery itself\nthere is not the slightest interest. But the mysteriousness of\nit is charming. I have just written to her three words to settle\nan appointment for to-morrow. We don't sign our names lest the\nPostmaster-General should find out all about it.\"\n\n\"Is she pretty?\"\n\n\"Well;--she isn't ugly. She has just enough of good looks to make the\nsort of thing pass off pleasantly. A mystery with a downright ugly\nyoung woman would be unpleasant.\"\n\nAfter this fashion the note from Miss Demolines had been received,\nand answered at once, but the other letters remained in his pocket\ntill he reached his office on the following morning. Sir Raffle had\nbegged him to be there at half-past nine. This he had sworn he would\nnot do; but he did seat himself in his room at ten minutes before\nten, finding of course the whole building untenanted at that early\nhour,--that unearthly hour, as Johnny called it himself. \"I shouldn't\nwonder if he really is here this morning,\" Johnny said, as he entered\nthe building, \"just that he may have an opportunity of jumping on\nme.\" But Sir Raffle was not there, and then Johnny began to abuse Sir\nRaffle. \"If ever I come here early to meet him again, because he says\nhe means to be here himself, I hope I may be ---- blessed.\" On that\nespecial morning it was twelve before Sir Raffle made his appearance,\nand Johnny avenged himself,--I regret to have to tell it,--by a fib.\nThat Sir Raffle fibbed first, was no valid excuse whatever for Eames.\n\n\"I've been at it ever since six o'clock,\" said Sir Raffle.\n\n\"At what?\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Work, to be sure;--and very hard work too. I believe the Chancellor\nof the Exchequer thinks that he can call upon me to any extent that\nhe pleases;--just any extent that he pleases. He doesn't give me\ncredit for a desire to have a single hour to myself.\"\n\n\"What would he do, Sir Raffle, if you were to get ill, or wear\nyourself out?\"\n\n\"He knows I'm not one of the wearing-out sort. You got my note last\nnight?\"\n\n\"Yes; I got your note.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry that I troubled you; but I couldn't help it. I didn't\nexpect to get a box full of papers at eleven o'clock last night.\"\n\n\"You didn't put me out, Sir Raffle; I happened to have business of my\nown which prevented the possibility of my being here early.\"\n\nThis was the way in which John Eames avenged himself. Sir Raffle\nturned his face upon his private secretary, and his face was very\nblack. Johnny bore the gaze without dropping an eyelid. \"I'm not\ngoing to stand it, and he may as well know that at once,\" Johnny said\nto one of his friends in the office afterwards. \"If he ever wants any\nthing really done, I'll do it;--though it should take me twelve hours\nat a stretch. But I'm not going to pretend to believe all the lies\nhe tells me about the Chancellor of the Exchequer. If that is to be\npart of the private secretary's business, he had better get somebody\nelse.\" But now Sir Raffle was very angry, and his countenance was\nfull of wrath as he looked down upon his subordinate minister. \"If\nI had come here, Mr. Eames, and had found you absent, I should\nhave been very much annoyed, very much annoyed indeed, after having\nwritten as I did.\"\n\n\"You would have found me absent at the hour you named. As I wasn't\nhere then, I think it's only fair to say so.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you begrudge your time to the service, Mr. Eames.\"\n\n\"I do begrudge it when the service doesn't want it.\"\n\n\"At your age, Mr. Eames, that's not for you to judge. If I had acted\nin that way when I was young I should never have filled the position\nI now hold. I always remembered in those days that as I was the hand\nand not the head, I was bound to hold myself in readiness whether\nwork might be required from me or not.\"\n\n\"If I'm wanted as hand now, Sir Raffle, I'm ready.\"\n\n\"That's all very well;--but why were you not here at the hour I\nnamed?\"\n\n\"Well, Sir Raffle, I cannot say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer\ndetained me;--but there was business. As I've been here for the last\ntwo hours, I am happy to think that in this instance the public\nservice will not have suffered from my disobedience.\"\n\nSir Raffle was still standing with his hat on, and with his back to\nthe fire, and his countenance was full of wrath. It was on his tongue\nto tell Johnny that he had better return to his former work in the\nouter office. He greatly wanted the comfort of a private secretary\nwho would believe in him--or at least pretend to believe in him.\nThere are men who, though they have not sense enough to be true,\nhave nevertheless sense enough to know that they cannot expect to be\nreally believed in by those who are near enough to them to know them.\nSir Raffle Buffle was such a one. He would have greatly delighted\nin the services of some one who would trust him implicitly,--of\nsome young man who would really believe all that he said of himself\nand of the Chancellor of the Exchequer; but he was wise enough to\nperceive that no such young man was to be had; or that any such young\nman,--could such a one be found,--would be absolutely useless for any\npurposes of work. He knew himself to be a liar whom nobody trusted.\nAnd he knew himself also to be a bully,--though he could not think so\nlow of himself as to believe that he was a bully whom nobody feared.\nA private secretary was at the least bound to pretend to believe in\nhim. There is a decency in such things, and that decency John Eames\ndid not observe. He thought that he must get rid of John Eames, in\nspite of certain attractions which belonged to Johnny's appearance\nand general manners, and social standing, and reputed wealth. But\nit would not be wise to punish a man on the spot for breaking an\nappointment which he himself had not kept, and therefore he would\nwait for another opportunity. \"You had better go to your own room\nnow,\" he said. \"I am engaged on a matter connected with the Treasury,\nin which I will not ask for your assistance.\" He knew that Eames\nwould not believe a word as to what he said about the Treasury,--not\neven some very trifling base of truth which did exist; but the boast\ngave him an opportunity of putting an end to the interview after his\nown fashion. Then John Eames went to his own room and answered the\nletters which he had in his pocket.\n\nTo the club dinner he would not go. \"What's the use of paying two\nguineas for a dinner with fellows you see every day of your life?\"\nhe said. To Lady Glencora's he would go, and he wrote a line to his\nfriend Dalrymple proposing that they should go together. And he would\ndine with his cousin Toogood in Tavistock Square. \"One meets the\nqueerest people in the world there,\" he said; \"but Tommy Toogood is\nsuch a good fellow himself!\" After that he had his lunch. Then he\nread the paper, and before he went away he wrote a dozen or two of\nprivate notes, presenting Sir Raffle's compliments right and left,\nand giving in no one note a single word of information that could be\nof any use to any person. Having thus earned his salary by half-past\nfour o'clock he got into a hansom cab and had himself driven to\nPorchester Terrace. Miss Demolines was at home, of course, and he\nsoon found himself closeted with that interesting young woman.\n\n\"I thought you never would have come.\" These were the first words she\nspoke.\n\n\"My dear Miss Demolines, you must not forget that I have my bread to\nearn.\"\n\n\"Fiddlestick--bread! As if I didn't know that you can get away from\nyour office when you choose.\"\n\n\"But, indeed, I cannot.\"\n\n\"What is there to prevent you, Mr. Eames?\"\n\n\"I'm not tied up like a dog, certainly; but who do you suppose will\ndo my work if I do not do it myself? It is a fact, though the world\ndoes not believe it, that men in public offices have got something to\ndo.\"\n\n\"Now you are laughing at me, I know; but you are welcome, if you like\nit. It's the way of the world just at present that ladies should\nsubmit to that sort of thing from gentlemen.\"\n\n\"What sort of thing, Miss Demolines?\"\n\n\"Chaff,--as you call it. Courtesy is out of fashion, and gallantry\nhas come to signify quite a different kind of thing from what it used\nto do.\"\n\n\"The Sir Charles Grandison business is done and gone. That's what you\nmean, I suppose? Don't you think we should find it very heavy if we\ntried to get it back again?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to ask you to be a Sir Charles Grandison, Mr.\nEames. But never mind all that now. Do you know that that girl has\nabsolutely had her first sitting for the picture?\"\n\n\"Has she, indeed?\"\n\n\"She has. You may take my word for it. I know it as a fact. What a\nfool that young man is!\"\n\n\"Which young man?\"\n\n\"Which young man! Conway Dalrymple to be sure. Artists are always\nweak. Of all men in the world they are the most subject to flattery\nfrom women; and we all know that Conway Dalrymple is very vain.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I didn't know it,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Yes, you do. You must know it. When a man goes about in a purple\nvelvet coat of course he is vain.\"\n\n\"I certainly cannot defend a purple velvet coat.\"\n\n\"That is what he wore when this girl sat to him this morning.\"\n\n\"This morning was it?\"\n\n\"Yes; this morning. They little think that they can do nothing\nwithout my knowing it. He was there for nearly four hours, and she\nwas dressed up in a white robe as Jael, with a turban on her head.\nJael, indeed! I call it very improper, and I am quite astonished that\nMaria Clutterbuck should have lent herself to such a piece of work.\nThat Maria was never very wise, of course we all know; but I thought\nthat she had principle enough to have kept her from this kind of\nthing.\"\n\n\"It's her fevered existence,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"That is just it. She must have excitement. It is like dram-drinking.\nAnd then, you know, they are always living in the crater of a\nvolcano.\"\n\n\"Who are living in the crater of a volcano?\"\n\n\"The Dobbs Broughtons are. Of course they are. There is no saying\nwhat day a smash may come. These City people get so used to it that\nthey enjoy it. The risk is every thing to them.\"\n\n\"They like to have a little certainty behind the risk, I fancy.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid there is very little that's certain with Dobbs Broughton.\nBut about this picture, Mr. Eames. I look to you to assist me there.\nIt must be put a stop to. As to that I am determined. It must be--put\na--stop to.\" And as Miss Demolines repeated these last words with\ntremendous emphasis she leant with both her elbows on a little table\nthat stood between her and her visitor, and looked with all her eyes\ninto his face. \"I do hope that you agree with me in that,\" said she.\n\n\"Upon my word I do not see the harm of the picture,\" said he.\n\n\"You do not?\"\n\n\"Indeed, no. Why should not Dalrymple paint Miss Van Siever as well\nas any other lady? It is his special business to paint ladies.\"\n\n\"Look here, Mr. Eames.--\" And now Miss Demolines, as she spoke, drew\nher own seat closer to that of her companion and pushed away the\nlittle table. \"Do you suppose that Conway Dalrymple, in the usual\nway of his business, paints pictures of young ladies, of which their\nmothers know nothing? Do you suppose that he paints them in ladies'\nrooms without their husbands' knowledge? And in the common way of his\nbusiness does he not expect to be paid for his pictures?\"\n\n\"But what is all that to you and me, Miss Demolines?\"\n\n\"Is the welfare of your friend nothing to you? Would you like to see\nhim become the victim of the artifice of such a girl as Clara Van\nSiever?\"\n\n\"Upon my word I think he is very well able to take care of himself.\"\n\n\"And would you wish to see that poor creature's domestic hearth\nruined and broken up?\"\n\n\"Which poor creature?\"\n\n\"Dobbs Broughton, to be sure.\"\n\n\"I can't pretend that I care very much for Dobbs Broughton,\" said\nJohn Eames; \"and you see I know so little about his domestic hearth.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Eames!\"\n\n\"Besides, her principles will pull her through. You told me yourself\nthat Mrs. Broughton has high principles.\"\n\n\"God forbid that I should say a word against Maria Clutterbuck,\" said\nMiss Demolines, fervently. \"Maria Clutterbuck was my early friend,\nand though words have been spoken which never should have been\nspoken, and though things have been done which never should have been\neven dreamed of, still I will not desert Maria Clutterbuck in her\nhour of need. No, never!\"\n\n\"I'm sure you're what one may call a trump to your friends, Miss\nDemolines.\"\n\n\"I have always endeavoured to be so, and always shall. You will find\nme so;--that is if you and I ever become intimate enough to feel that\nsort of friendship.\"\n\n\"There's nothing on earth I should like better,\" said Johnny. As\nsoon as the words were out of his mouth he felt ashamed of himself.\nHe knew that he did not in truth desire the friendship of Miss\nDemolines, and that any friendship with such a one would mean\nsomething different from friendship,--something that would be an\ninjury to Lily Dale. A week had hardly passed since he had sworn a\nlife's constancy to Lily Dale,--had sworn it, not to her only, but to\nhimself; and now he was giving way to a flirtation with this woman,\nnot because he liked it himself, but because he was too weak to keep\nout of it.\n\n\"If that is true--,\" said Miss Demolines.\n\n\"Oh, yes; it's quite true,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Then you must earn my friendship by doing what I ask of you. That\npicture must not be painted. You must tell Conway Dalrymple as his\nfriend that he must cease to carry on such an intrigue in another\nman's house.\"\n\n\"You would hardly call painting a picture an intrigue; would you?\"\n\n\"Certainly I would when it's kept a secret from the husband by the\nwife,--and from the mother by the daughter. If it cannot be stopped\nin any other way, I must tell Mrs. Van Siever;--I must, indeed. I\nhave such an abhorrence of the old woman, that I could not bring\nmyself to speak to her,--but I should write to her. That's what I\nshould do.\"\n\n\"But what's the reason? You might as well tell me the real reason.\"\nHad Miss Demolines been christened Mary, or Fanny, or Jane, I think\nthat John Eames would now have called her by either of those names;\nbut Madalina was such a mouthful that he could not bring himself to\nuse it at once. He had heard that among her intimates she was called\nMaddy. He had an idea that he had heard Dalrymple in old times talk\nof her as Maddy Mullins, and just at this moment the idea was not\npleasant to him; at any rate he could not call her Maddy as yet. \"How\nam I to help you,\" he said, \"unless I know all about it?\"\n\n\"I hate that girl like poison!\" said Miss Demolines, confidentially,\ndrawing herself very near to Johnny as she spoke.\n\n\"But what has she done?\"\n\n\"What has she done? I can't tell you what she has done. I could not\ndemean myself by repeating it. Of course we all know what she wants.\nShe wants to catch Conway Dalrymple. That's as plain as anything can\nbe. Not that I care about that.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Not in the least. It's nothing to me. I have known Mr. Dalrymple,\nno doubt, for a year or two, and I should be sorry to see a young\nman who has his good points sacrificed in that sort of way. But it\nis mere acquaintance between Mr. Dalrymple and me, and of course I\ncannot interfere.\"\n\n\"She'll have a lot of money, you know.\"\n\n\"He thinks so; does he? I suppose that is what Maria has told him.\nOh, Mr. Eames, you don't know the meanness of women; you don't,\nindeed. Men are so much more noble.\"\n\n\"Are they, do you think?\"\n\n\"Than some women. I see women doing things that really disgust\nme; I do, indeed;--things that I wouldn't do myself, were it ever\nso;--striving to catch men in every possible way, and for such\npurposes! I wouldn't have believed it of Maria Clutterbuck. I\nwouldn't indeed. However, I will never say a word against her,\nbecause she has been my friend. Nothing shall ever induce me.\"\n\nJohn Eames before he left Porchester Terrace, had at last succeeded\nin calling his fair friend Madalina, and had promised that he would\nendeavour to open the artist's eyes to the folly of painting his\npicture in Broughton's house without Broughton's knowledge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nMR. TOOGOOD'S IDEAS ABOUT SOCIETY.\n\n\nA day or two after the interview which was described in the last\nchapter John Eames dined with his uncle Mr. Thomas Toogood, in\nTavistock Square. He was in the habit of doing this about once a\nmonth, and was a great favourite both with his cousins and with their\nmother. Mr. Toogood did not give dinner-parties; always begging\nthose whom he asked to enjoy his hospitality, to take pot luck, and\ntelling young men whom he could treat with familiarity,--such as his\nnephew,--that if they wanted to be regaled \u00c3\u00a0 la Russe they must not\ncome to number 75, Tavistock Square. \"A leg of mutton and trimmings;\nthat will be about the outside of it,\" he would say; but he would add\nin a whisper,--\"and a glass of port such as you don't get every day\nof your life.\" Polly and Lucy Toogood were pretty girls, and merry\nwithal, and certain young men were well contented to accept the\nattorney's invitations,--whether attracted by the promised leg of\nmutton, or the port wine, or the young ladies, I will not attempt to\nsay. But it had so happened that one young man, a clerk from John\nEames' office, had partaken so often of the pot luck and port wine\nthat Polly Toogood had conquered him by her charms, and he was now a\nslave, waiting an appropriate time for matrimonial sacrifice. William\nSummerkin was the young man's name; and as it was known that Mr.\nSummerkin was to inherit a fortune amounting to five thousand pounds\nfrom his maiden aunt, it was considered that Polly Toogood was not\ndoing amiss. \"I'll give you three hundred pounds, my boy, just to put\na few sheets on the beds,\" said Toogood the father, \"and when the old\nbirds are both dead she'll have a thousand pounds out of the nest.\nThat's the extent of Polly's fortune;--so now you know.\" Summerkin\nwas, however, quite contented to have his own money settled on his\ndarling Polly, and the whole thing was looked at with pleasant and\npropitious eyes by the Toogood connection.\n\nWhen John Eames entered the drawing-room Summerkin and Polly were\nalready there. Summerkin blushed up to his eyes, of course, but Polly\nsat as demurely as though she had been accustomed to having lovers\nall her life. \"Mamma will be down almost immediately, John,\" said\nPolly as soon as the first greetings were over, \"and papa has come\nin, I know.\"\n\n\"Summerkin,\" said Johnny, \"I'm afraid you left the office before four\no'clock.\"\n\n\"No, I did not,\" said Summerkin. \"I deny it.\"\n\n\"Polly,\" said her cousin, \"you should keep him in better order. He\nwill certainly come to grief if he goes on like this. I suppose you\ncould do without him for half an hour.\"\n\n\"I don't want him, I can assure you,\" said Polly.\n\n\"I have only been here just five minutes,\" said Summerkin, \"and I\ncame because Mrs. Toogood asked me to do a commission.\"\n\n\"That's civil to you, Polly,\" said John.\n\n\"It's quite as civil as I wish him to be,\" said Polly. \"And as for\nyou, John, everybody knows that you're a goose, and that you always\nwere a goose. Isn't he always doing foolish things at the office,\nWilliam?\" But as John Eames was rather a great man at the Income-tax\nOffice, Summerkin would not fall into his sweetheart's joke on this\nsubject, finding it easier and perhaps safer to twiddle the bodkins\nin Polly's work-basket. Then Toogood and Mrs. Toogood entered the\nroom together, and the lovers were able to be alone again during the\ngeneral greeting with which Johnny was welcomed.\n\n\"You don't know the Silverbridge people,--do you?\" asked Mr. Toogood.\nEames said that he did not. He had been at Silverbridge more than\nonce, but did not know very much of the Silverbridgians. \"Because\nWalker is coming to dine here. Walker is the leading man in\nSilverbridge.\"\n\n\"And what is Walker;--besides being leading man in Silverbridge?\"\n\n\"He's a lawyer. Walker and Winthrop. Everybody knows Walker in\nBarsetshire. I've been down at Barchester since I saw you.\"\n\n\"Have you indeed?\" said Johnny.\n\n\"And I'll tell you what I've been about. You know Mr. Crawley; don't\nyou?\"\n\n\"The Hogglestock clergyman that has come to grief? I don't know him\npersonally. He's a sort of cousin by marriage, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course he is,\" said Mr. Toogood. \"His wife is my first-cousin,\nand your mother's first-cousin. He came here to me the other day;--or\nrather to the shop. I had never seen the man before in my life, and a\nvery queer fellow he is too. He came to me about this trouble of his,\nand of course I must do what I can for him. I got myself introduced\nto Walker, who has the management of the prosecution, and I asked him\nto come here and dine to-day.\"\n\n\"And what sort of fellow did you find Crawley, uncle Tom?\"\n\n\"Such a queer fish;--so unlike anybody else in the world!\"\n\n\"But I suppose he did take the money?\" said Johnny.\n\n\"I don't know what to say about it. I don't indeed. If he took it he\ndidn't mean to steal it. I'm as sure that man didn't mean to steal\ntwenty pounds as I ever could be of anything. Perhaps I shall get\nsomething about it out of Walker after dinner.\" Then Mr. Walker\nentered the room. \"This is very kind of you, Mr. Walker; very indeed.\nI take it quite as a compliment, your coming in in this sort of way.\nIt's just pot luck, you know, and nothing else.\" Mr. Walker of course\nassured his host that he was delighted. \"Just a leg of mutton and a\nbottle of old port, Mr. Walker,\" continued Toogood. \"We never get\nbeyond that in the way of dinner-giving; do we, Maria?\"\n\nBut Maria was at this moment descanting on the good luck of the\nfamily to her nephew,--and on one special piece of good luck which\nhad just occurred. Mr. Summerkin's maiden aunt had declared her\nintention of giving up the fortune to the young people at once. She\nhad enough to live upon, she said, and would therefore make two\nlovers happy. \"And they're to be married on the first of May,\" said\nLucy,--that Lucy of whom her father had boasted to Mr. Crawley that\nshe knew Byron by heart,--\"and won't that be jolly? Mamma is going\nout to look for a house for them to-morrow. Fancy Polly with a house\nof her own! Won't it be stunning? I wish you were going to be married\ntoo, Johnny.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool, Lucy.\"\n\n\"Of course I know that you are in love. I hope you are not going to\ngive over being in love, Johnny, because it is such fun.\"\n\n\"Wait till you're caught yourself, my girl.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to be caught till some great swell comes this way.\nAnd as great swells never do come into Tavistock Square I shan't\nhave a chance. I'll tell you what I would like; I'd like to have a\nCorsair,--or else a Giaour;--I think a Giaour would be nicest. Only\na Giaour wouldn't be a Giaour here, you know. Fancy a lover 'Who\nthundering comes on blackest steed, With slackened bit and hoof of\nspeed.' Were not those the days to live in! But all that is over now,\nyou know, and young people take houses in Woburn Place, instead of\nbeing locked up, or drowned, or married to a hideous monster behind a\nveil. I suppose it's better as it is, for some reasons.\"\n\n\"I think it must be more jolly, as you call it, Lucy.\"\n\n\"I'm not quite sure. I know I'd go back and be Medora, if I could.\nMamma is always telling Polly that she must be careful about\nWilliam's dinner. But Conrad didn't care for his dinner. 'Light toil!\nto cull and dress thy frugal fare! See, I have plucked the fruit that\npromised best.'\"\n\n\"And how often do you think Conrad got drunk?\"\n\n\"I don't think he got drunk at all. There is no reason why he should,\nany more than William. Come along, and take me down to dinner. After\nall, papa's leg of mutton is better than Medora's apples, when one is\nas hungry as I am.\"\n\nThe leg of mutton on this occasion consisted of soup, fish, and a\nbit of roast beef, and a couple of boiled fowls. \"If I had only two\nchildren instead of twelve, Mr. Walker,\" said the host, \"I'd give you\na dinner \u00c3\u00a0 la Russe.\"\n\n\"I don't begrudge Mrs. Toogood a single arrow in her quiver on that\nscore,\" said Mr. Walker.\n\n\"People are getting to be so luxurious that one can't live up to them\nat all,\" said Mrs. Toogood. \"We dined out here with some new comers\nin the square only last week. We had asked them before, and they came\nquite in a quiet way,--just like this; and when we got there we found\nthey'd four kinds of ices after dinner!\"\n\n\"And not a morsel of food on the table fit to eat,\" said Toogood.\n\"I never was so poisoned in my life. As for soup,--it was just the\nwashings of the pastrycook's kettle next door.\"\n\n\"And how is one to live with such people, Mr. Walker?\" continued Mrs.\nToogood. \"Of course we can't ask them back again. We can't give them\nfour kinds of ices.\"\n\n\"But would that be necessary? Perhaps they haven't got twelve\nchildren.\"\n\n\"They haven't got any,\" said Toogood, triumphing; \"not a chick\nbelonging to them. But you see one must do as other people do. I\nhate anything grand. I wouldn't want more than this for myself, if\nbank-notes were as plenty as curl-papers.\"\n\n\"Nobody has any curl-papers now, papa,\" said Lucy.\n\n\"But I can't bear to be outdone,\" said Mr. Toogood. \"I think it's\nvery unpleasant,--people living in that sort of way. It's all very\nwell telling me that I needn't live so too;--and of course I don't.\nI can't afford to have four men in from the confectioner's, dressed a\nsight better than myself, at ten shillings a head. I can't afford it,\nand I don't do it. But the worst of it is that I suffer because other\npeople do it. It stands to reason that I must either be driven along\nwith the crowd, or else be left behind. Now, I don't like either.\nAnd what's the end of it? Why, I'm half carried away and half left\nbehind.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, papa, I don't think you're carried away at all,\" said\nLucy.\n\n\"Yes, I am; and I'm ashamed of myself. Mr. Walker, I don't dare to\nask you to drink a glass of wine with me in my own house,--that's\nwhat I don't,--because it's the proper thing for you to wait till\nsomebody brings it you, and then to drink it by yourself. There is no\nknowing whether I mightn't offend you.\" And Mr. Toogood as he spoke\ngrasped the decanter at his elbow. Mr. Walker grasped another at his\nelbow, and the two attorneys took their glass of wine together.\n\n\"A very queer case this is of my cousin Crawley's,\" said Toogood to\nWalker, when the ladies had left the dining-room.\n\n\"A most distressing case. I never knew anything so much talked of in\nour part of the country.\"\n\n\"He can't have been a popular man, I should say?\"\n\n\"No; not popular,--not in the ordinary way;--anything but that.\nNobody knew him personally before this matter came up.\"\n\n\"But a good clergyman, probably? I'm interested in the case, of\ncourse, as his wife is my first-cousin. You will understand, however,\nthat I know nothing of him. My father tried to be civil to him once,\nbut Crawley wouldn't have it at all. We all thought he was mad then.\nI suppose he has done his duty in his parish?\"\n\n\"He has quarrelled with the bishop, you know,--out and out.\"\n\n\"Has he, indeed? But I'm not sure that I think so very much about\nbishops, Mr. Walker.\"\n\n\"That depends very much on the particular bishop. Some people say\nours isn't all that a bishop ought to be, while others are very fond\nof him.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Crawley belongs to the former set; that's all?\" said Mr.\nToogood.\n\n\"No, Mr. Toogood; that isn't all. The worst of your cousin is that\nhe has an aptitude to quarrel with everybody. He is one of those men\nwho always think themselves to be ill-used. Now our dean, Dr. Arabin,\nhas been his very old friend,--and as far as I can learn, a very good\nfriend; but it seems that Mr. Crawley has done his best to quarrel\nwith him too.\"\n\n\"He spoke of the dean in the highest terms to me.\"\n\n\"He may do that,--and yet quarrel with him. He'd quarrel with his own\nright hand, if he had nothing else to quarrel with. That makes the\ndifficulty, you see. He'll take nobody's advice. He thinks that we're\nall against him.\"\n\n\"I suppose the world has been heavy on him, Mr. Walker?\"\n\n\"The world has been very heavy on him,\" said John Eames, who had now\nbeen left free to join the conversation, Mr. Summerkin having gone\naway to his lady-love. \"You must not judge him as you do other men.\"\n\n\"That is just it,\" said Mr. Walker. \"And to what result will that\nbring us?\"\n\n\"That we ought to stretch a point in his favour,\" said Toogood.\n\n\"But why?\" asked the attorney from Silverbridge. \"What do we mean\nwhen we say that one man isn't to be trusted as another? We simply\nimply that he is not what we call responsible.\"\n\n\"And I don't think Mr. Crawley is responsible,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Then how can he be fit to have charge of a parish?\" said Mr. Walker.\n\"You see where the difficulty is. How it embarrasses one all round.\nThe amount of evidence as to the cheque is, I think, sufficient to\nget a verdict in an ordinary case, and the Crown has no alternative\nbut so to treat it. Then his friends come forward,--and from sympathy\nwith his sufferings, I desire to be ranked among the number,--and\nsay, 'Ah, but you should spare this man, because he is not\nresponsible.' Were he one who filled no position requiring special\nresponsibility, that might be very well. His friends might undertake\nto look after him, and the prosecution might perhaps be smothered.\nBut Mr. Crawley holds a living, and if he escape he will be\ntriumphant,--especially triumphant over the bishop. Now, if he has\nreally taken this money, and if his only excuse be that he did not\nknow when he took it whether he was stealing or whether he was\nnot,--for the sake of justice that ought not to be allowed.\" So spoke\nMr. Walker.\n\n\"You think he certainly did steal the money?\" said Johnny.\n\n\"You have heard the evidence, no doubt?\" said Mr. Walker.\n\n\"I don't feel quite sure about it, yet,\" said Mr. Toogood.\n\n\"Quite sure of what?\" said Mr. Walker.\n\n\"That the cheque was dropped in his house.\"\n\n\"It was at any rate traced to his hands.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt about that,\" said Toogood.\n\n\"And he can't account for it,\" said Walker.\n\n\"A man isn't bound to show where he got his money,\" said Johnny.\n\"Suppose that sovereign is marked,\" and Johnny produced a coin from\nhis pocket, \"and I don't know but what it is; and suppose it is\nproved to have belonged to some one who lost it, and then to be\ntraced to my hands,--how am I to say where I got it? If I were asked,\nI should simply decline to answer.\"\n\n\"But a cheque is not a sovereign, Mr. Eames,\" said Walker. \"It is\npresumed that a man can account for the possession of a cheque. It\nmay be that a man should have a cheque in his possession and not be\nable to account for it, and should yet be open to no grave suspicion.\nIn such a case a jury has to judge. Here is the fact: that Mr.\nCrawley has the cheque, and brings it into use some considerable time\nafter it is drawn; and the additional fact that the drawer of the\ncheque had lost it, as he thought, in Mr. Crawley's house, and had\nlooked for it there, soon after it was drawn, and long before it was\npaid. A jury must judge; but, as a lawyer, I should say that the\nburden of disproof lies with Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"Did you find out anything, Mr. Walker,\" said Toogood, \"about the man\nwho drove Mr. Soames that day?\"\n\n\"No,--nothing.\"\n\n\"The trap was from 'The Dragon' at Barchester, I think?\"\n\n\"Yes,--from 'The Dragon of Wantly.'\"\n\n\"A respectable sort of house?\"\n\n\"Pretty well for that, I believe. I've heard that the people are\npoor,\" said Mr. Walker.\n\n\"Somebody told me that they'd had a queer lot about the house, and\nthat three or four of them left just then. I think I heard that two\nor three men from the place went to New Zealand together. It just\ncame out in conversation while I was in the inn-yard.\"\n\n\"I have never heard anything of it,\" said Mr. Walker.\n\n\"I don't say that it can help us.\"\n\n\"I don't see that it can,\" said Mr. Walker.\n\nAfter that there was a pause, and Mr. Toogood pushed about the old\nport, and made some very stinging remarks as to the claret-drinking\npropensities of the age. \"Gladstone claret the most of it is, I\nfancy,\" said Mr. Toogood. \"I find that port wine which my father\nbought in the wood five-and-twenty years ago is good enough for me.\"\nMr. Walker said that it was quite good enough for him, almost too\ngood, and that he thought that he had had enough of it. The host\nthreatened another bottle, and was up to draw the cork,--rather to\nthe satisfaction of John Eames, who liked his uncle's port,--but Mr.\nWalker stopped him. \"Not a drop more for me,\" he said. \"You are quite\nsure?\" \"Quite sure.\" And Mr. Walker moved towards the door.\n\n\"It's a great pity, Mr. Walker,\" said Toogood, going back to the old\nsubject, \"that this dean and his wife should be away.\"\n\n\"I understand that they will both be home before the trial,\" said Mr.\nWalker.\n\n\"Yes,--but you know how very important it is to learn beforehand\nexactly what your witnesses can prove and what they can't prove. And\nmoreover, though neither the dean nor his wife might perhaps be able\nto tell us anything themselves, they might help to put us on the\nproper scent. I think I'll send somebody after them. I think I will.\"\n\n\"It would be a heavy expense, Mr. Toogood.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Toogood, mournfully, thinking of the twelve children; \"it\nwould be a heavy expense. But I never like to stick at a thing when\nit ought to be done. I think I shall send a fellow after them.\"\n\n\"I'll go,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"How can you go?\"\n\n\"I'll make old Snuffle give me leave.\"\n\n\"But will that lessen the expense?\" said Mr. Walker.\n\n\"Well, yes, I think it will,\" said John, modestly.\n\n\"My nephew is a rich man, Mr. Walker,\" said Toogood.\n\n\"That alters the case,\" said Mr. Walker. And thus, before they left\nthe dining-room, it was settled that John Eames should be taught\nhis lesson and should seek both Mrs. Arabin and Dr. Arabin on their\ntravels.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nGRACE CRAWLEY AT HOME.\n\n\nOn the morning after his return from London Mr. Crawley showed\nsymptoms of great fatigue, and his wife implored him to remain in\nbed. But this he would not do. He would get up, and go out down to\nthe brickfields. He had specially bound himself,--he said, to see\nthat the duties of the parish did not suffer by being left in his\nhands. The bishop had endeavoured to place them in other hands, but\nhe had persisted in retaining them. As he had done so he could allow\nno weariness of his own to interfere,--and especially no weariness\ninduced by labours undertaken on his own behalf. The day in the week\nhad come round on which it was his wont to visit the brickmakers, and\nhe would visit them. So he dragged himself out of his bed and went\nforth amidst the cold storm of a harsh wet March morning. His wife\nwell knew when she heard his first word on that morning that one of\nthose terrible moods had come upon him which made her doubt whether\nshe ought to allow him to go anywhere alone. Latterly there had been\nsome improvement in his mental health. Since the day of his encounter\nwith the bishop and Mrs. Proudie, though he had been as stubborn\nas ever, he had been less apparently unhappy, less depressed in\nspirits. And the journey to London had done him good. His wife had\ncongratulated herself on finding him able to set about his work like\nanother man, and he himself had experienced a renewal, if not of\nhope, at any rate, of courage, which had given him a comfort which he\nhad recognized. His common-sense had not been very striking in his\ninterview with Mr. Toogood, but yet he had talked more rationally\nthen and had given a better account of the matter in hand than could\nhave been expected from him for some weeks previously. But now that\nthe labour was over, a reaction had come upon him, and he went away\nfrom his house having hardly spoken a word to his wife after the\nspeech which he made about his duty to his parish.\n\nI think that at this time nobody saw clearly the working of his\nmind,--not even his wife, who studied it very closely, who gave him\ncredit for all his high qualities, and who had gradually learned to\nacknowledge to herself that she must distrust his judgment in many\nthings. She knew that he was good and yet weak, that he was afflicted\nby false pride and supported by true pride, that his intellect was\nstill very bright, yet so dismally obscured on many sides as almost\nto justify people in saying that he was mad. She knew that he was\nalmost a saint, and yet almost a castaway through vanity and hatred\nof those above him. But she did not know that he knew all this of\nhimself also. She did not comprehend that he should be hourly telling\nhimself that people were calling him mad and were so calling him with\ntruth. It did not occur to her that he could see her insight into\nhim. She doubted as to the way in which he had got the cheque,--never\nimagining, however, that he had wilfully stolen it;--thinking that\nhis mind had been so much astray as to admit of his finding it and\nusing it without wilful guilt,--thinking also, alas, that a man who\ncould so act was hardly fit for such duties as those which were\nentrusted to him. But she did not dream that this was precisely his\nown idea of his own state and of his own position;--that he was\nalways inquiring of himself whether he was not mad; whether, if mad,\nhe was not bound to lay down his office; that he was ever taxing\nhimself with improper hostility to the bishop,--never forgetting\nfor a moment his wrath against the bishop and the bishop's wife,\nstill comforting himself with his triumph over the bishop and the\nbishop's wife,--but, for all that, accusing himself of a heavy sin\nand proposing to himself to go to the palace and there humbly to\nrelinquish his clerical authority. Such a course of action he was\nproposing to himself, but not with any realized idea that he would\nso act. He was as a man who walks along a river's bank thinking of\nsuicide, calculating how best he might kill himself,--whether the\nriver does not offer an opportunity too good to be neglected, telling\nhimself that for many reasons he had better do so, suggesting to\nhimself that the water is pleasant and cool, and that his ears would\nsoon be deaf to the harsh noises of the world,--but yet knowing,\nor thinking that he knows, that he never will kill himself. So it\nwas with Mr. Crawley. Though his imagination pictured to himself\nthe whole scene,--how he would humble himself to the ground as he\nacknowledged his unfitness, how he would endure the small-voiced\ntriumph of the little bishop, how, from the abjectness of his own\nhumility, even from the ground on which he would be crouching, he\nwould rebuke the loud-mouthed triumph of the bishop's wife; though\nthere was no touch wanting to the picture which he thus drew,--he did\nnot really propose to himself to commit this professional suicide.\nHis wife, too, had considered whether it might be in truth becoming\nthat he should give up his clerical duties, at any rate for a while;\nbut she had never thought that the idea was present to his mind also.\n\nMr. Toogood had told him that people would say that he was mad; and\nMr. Toogood had looked at him, when he declared for the second time\nthat he had no knowledge whence the cheque had come to him, as though\nhis words were to be regarded as the words of some sick child. \"Mad!\"\nhe said to himself, as he walked home from the station that night.\n\"Well; yes; and what if I am mad? When I think of all that I have\nendured my wonder is that I should not have been mad sooner.\" And\nthen he prayed,--yes, prayed, that in his madness the Devil might\nnot be too strong for him, and that he might be preserved from some\nterrible sin of murder or violence. What, if the idea should come to\nhim in his madness that it would be well for him to slay his wife and\nhis children? Only that was wanting to make him of all men the most\nunfortunate.\n\nHe went down among the brickmakers on the following morning, leaving\nthe house almost without a morsel of food, and he remained at Hoggle\nEnd for the greater part of the day. There were sick persons there\nwith whom he prayed, and then he sat talking with rough men while\nthey ate their dinners, and he read passages from the Bible to women\nwhile they washed their husbands' clothes. And for a while he sat\nwith a little girl in his lap teaching the child her alphabet. If it\nwere possible for him he would do his duty. He would spare himself\nin nothing, though he might suffer even to fainting. And on this\noccasion he did suffer,--almost to fainting, for as he returned home\nin the afternoon he was forced to lean from time to time against the\nbanks on the road-side, while the cold sweat of weakness trickled\ndown his face, in order that he might recover strength to go on a few\nyards. But he would persevere. If God would but leave to him mind\nenough for his work, he would go on. No personal suffering should\ndeter him. He told himself that there had been men in the world whose\nsufferings were sharper even than his own. Of what sort had been the\nlife of the man who had stood for years on the top of a pillar? But\nthen the man on the pillar had been honoured by all around him. And\nthus, though he had thought of the man on the pillar to encourage\nhimself by remembering how lamentable had been that man's suffering,\nhe came to reflect that after all his own sufferings were perhaps\nkeener than those of the man on the pillar.\n\nWhen he reached home, he was very ill. There was no doubt about it\nthen. He staggered to his arm-chair, and stared at his wife first,\nthen smiled at her with a ghastly smile. He trembled all over, and\nwhen food was brought to him he could not eat it. Early on the next\nmorning the doctor was by his bedside, and before that evening came\nhe was delirious. He had been at intervals in this state for nearly\ntwo days, when Mrs. Crawley wrote to Grace, and though she had\nrestrained herself from telling everything, she had written with\nsufficient strength to bring Grace at once to her father's bedside.\n\nHe was not so ill when Grace arrived but that he knew her, and he\nseemed to receive some comfort from her coming. Before she had been\nin the house an hour she was reading Greek to him, and there was\nno wandering in his mind as to the due emphasis to be given to the\nplaints of the injured heroines, or as to the proper meaning of the\nchoruses. And as he lay with his head half buried in the pillows, he\nshouted out long passages, lines from tragic plays by the score, and\nfor a while seemed to have all the enjoyment of a dear old pleasure\nplaced newly within his reach. But he tired of this after a while,\nand then, having looked round to see that his wife was not in the\nroom, he began to talk of himself.\n\n\"So you have been at Allington, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa.\"\n\n\"Is it a pretty place?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa;--very pretty.\"\n\n\"And they were good to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa;--very good.\"\n\n\"Had they heard anything there about--me; of this trial that is to\ncome on?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa; they had heard of it.\"\n\n\"And what did they say? You need not think that you will shock me\nby telling me. They cannot say worse there than people have said\nhere,--or think worse.\"\n\n\"They don't think at all badly of you at Allington, papa.\"\n\n\"But they must think badly of me if the magistrates were right?\"\n\n\"They suppose that there has been a mistake;--as we all think.\"\n\n\"They do not try men at the assizes for mistakes.\"\n\n\"That you have been mistaken, I mean;--and the magistrates mistaken.\"\n\n\"Both cannot have been mistaken, Grace.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to explain myself, papa; but we all know that it is\nvery sad, and are quite sure that you have never meant for one moment\nto do anything that was wrong.\"\n\n\"But people when they are,--you know what I mean, Grace; when they\nare not themselves,--do things that are wrong without meaning it.\"\nThen he paused, while she remained standing by him with her hand on\nthe back of his. She was looking at his face, which had been turned\ntowards her while they were reading together, but which now was so\nfar moved that she knew that his eyes could not be fixed upon hers.\n\"Of course if the bishop orders it, it shall be so,\" he said. \"It is\nquite enough for me that he is the bishop.\"\n\n\"What has the bishop ordered, papa?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all. It is she who does it. He has given no opinion about\nit. Of course not. He has none to give. It is the woman. You go and\ntell her from me that in such a matter I will not obey the word of\nany woman living. Go at once, when I tell you.\"\n\nThen she knew that her father's mind was wandering, and she knelt\ndown by the bedside, still holding his hand.\n\n\"Grace,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, papa, I am here.\"\n\n\"Why do you not do what I tell you?\" And he sat upright in his bed.\n\"I suppose you are afraid of the woman?\"\n\n\"I should be afraid of her, dear papa.\"\n\n\"I was not afraid of her. When she spoke to me, I would have nothing\nto say to her;--not a word; not a word;--not a word.\" As he said this\nhe waved his hands about. \"But as for him,--if it must be, it must. I\nknow I'm not fit for it. Of course I am not. Who is? But what has he\never done that he should be a dean? I beat him at everything; almost\nat everything. He got the Newdegate, and that was about all. Upon my\nword I think that was all.\"\n\n\"But Dr. Arabin loves you truly, dear papa.\"\n\n\"Love me! psha! Does he ever come here to tea, as he used to do? No!\nI remember buttering toast for him down on my knees before the fire,\nbecause he liked it,--and keeping all the cream for him. He should\nhave had my heart's blood if he wanted it. But now;--look at his\nbooks, Grace. It's the outside of them he cares about. They are all\ngilt, but I doubt if he ever reads. As for her,--I will not allow\nany woman to tell me my duty. No;--by my Maker; not even your mother,\nwho is the best of women. And as for her, with her little husband\ndangling at her apron-strings, as a call-whistle to be blown into\nwhen she pleases,--that she should dare to teach me my duty! No! The\nmen in the jury-box may decide it how they will. If they can believe\na plain story, let them! If not,--let them do as they please. I am\nready to bear it all.\"\n\n\"Dear papa, you are tired. Will you not try to sleep?\"\n\n\"Tell Mrs. Proudie what I say; and as for Arabin's money, I took\nit. I know I took it. What would you have had me do? Shall I--see\nthem--all--starve?\" Then he fell back upon his bed and did sleep.\n\nThe next day he was better, and insisted upon getting out of bed,\nand on sitting in his old arm-chair over the fire. And the Greek\nbooks were again had out; and Grace, not at all unwillingly, was\nput through her facings. \"If you don't take care, my dear,\" he said,\n\"Jane will beat you yet. She understands the force of the verbs\nbetter than you do.\"\n\n\"I am very glad that she is doing so well, papa. I am sure I shall\nnot begrudge her her superiority.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you should begrudge it her!\" Jane was sitting by at the\ntime, and the two sisters were holding each other by the hand.\n\"Always to be best;--always to be in advance of others. That should\nbe your motto.\"\n\n\"But we can't both be best, papa,\" said Jane.\n\n\"You can both strive to be best. But Grace has the better voice. I\nremember when I knew the whole of the Antigone by heart. You girls\nshould see which can learn it first.\"\n\n\"It would take such a long time,\" said Jane.\n\n\"You are young, and what can you do better with your leisure hours?\nFie, Jane! I did not expect that from you. When I was learning it I\nhad eight or nine pupils, and read an hour a day with each of them.\nBut I think that nobody works now as they used to work then. Where is\nyour mamma? Tell her I think I could get out as far as Mrs. Cox's, if\nshe would help me to dress.\" Soon after this he was in bed again, and\nhis head was wandering; but still they knew that he was better than\nhe had been.\n\n\"You are more of a comfort to your papa than I can be,\" said Mrs.\nCrawley to her eldest daughter that night as they sat together, when\neverybody else was in bed.\n\n\"Do not say that, mamma. Papa does not think so.\"\n\n\"I cannot read Greek plays to him as you can do. I can only nurse him\nin his illness and endeavour to do my duty. Do you know, Grace, that\nI am beginning to fear that he half doubts me?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma!\"\n\n\"That he half doubts me, and is half afraid of me. He does not think\nas he used to do, that I am altogether, heart and soul, on his side.\nI can see it in his eye as he watches me. He thinks that I am tired\nof him,--tired of his sufferings, tired of his poverty, tired of the\nevil which men say of him. I am not sure but what he thinks that I\nsuspect him.\"\n\n\"Of what, mamma?\"\n\n\"Of general unfitness for the work he has to do. The feeling is not\nstrong as yet, but I fear that he will teach himself to think that\nhe has an enemy at his hearth,--not a friend. It will be the saddest\nmistake he ever made.\"\n\n\"He told me to-day that you were the best of women. Those were his\nvery words.\"\n\n\"Were they, my dear? I am glad at least that he should say so to you.\nHe has been better since you came;--a great deal better. For one day\nI was frightened; but I am sorry now that I sent for you.\"\n\n\"I am so glad, mamma; so very glad.\"\n\n\"You were happy there,--and comfortable. And if they were glad to\nhave you, why should I have brought you away?\"\n\n\"But I was not happy;--even though they were very good to me. How\ncould I be happy there when I was thinking of you and papa and Jane\nhere at home? Whatever there is here, I would sooner share it with\nyou than be anywhere else,--while this trouble lasts.\"\n\n\"My darling!--it is a great comfort to see you again.\"\n\n\"Only that I knew that one less in the house would be a saving to you\nI should not have gone. When there is unhappiness, people should stay\ntogether;--shouldn't they, mamma?\" They were sitting quite close to\neach other, on an old sofa in a small upstairs room, from which a\ndoor opened into the larger chamber in which Mr. Crawley was lying.\nIt had been arranged between them that on this night Mrs. Crawley\nshould remain with her husband, and that Grace should go to her bed.\nIt was now past one o'clock, but she was still there, clinging to her\nmother's side, with her mother's arm drawn round her. \"Mamma,\" she\nsaid, when they had both been silent for some ten minutes, \"I have\ngot something to tell you.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Mamma, I've got something to tell you.\"]\n\n\"To-night?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma; to-night, if you will let me.\"\n\n\"But you promised that you would go to bed. You were up all last\nnight.\"\n\n\"I am not sleepy, mamma.\"\n\n\"Of course you shall tell me what you please, dearest. Is it a\nsecret? Is it something I am not to repeat?\"\n\n\"You must say how that ought to be, mamma. I shall not tell it to any\none else.\"\n\n\"Well, dear?\"\n\n\"Sit comfortably, mamma;--there; like that, and let me have your\nhand. It's a terrible story to have to tell.\"\n\n\"A terrible story, Grace?\"\n\n\"I mean that you must not draw away from me. I shall want to feel\nthat you are quite close to me. Mamma, while I was at Allington,\nMajor Grantly came there.\"\n\n\"Did he, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\"\n\n\"Did he know them before?\"\n\n\"No, mamma; not at the Small House. But he came there--to see me. He\nasked me--to be his wife. Don't move, mamma.\"\n\n\"My darling child! I won't move, dearest. Well; and what did you\nsay to him? God bless him, at any rate. May God bless him, because\nhe has seen with a true eye, and felt with a noble instinct. It is\nsomething, Grace, to have been wooed by such a man at such a time.\"\n\n\"Mamma, it did make me feel proud; it did.\"\n\n\"You had known him well before,--of course? I knew that you and he\nwere friends, Grace.\"\n\n\"Yes, we were friends. I always liked him. I used not to know what to\nthink about him. Miss Anne Prettyman told me that it would be so; and\nonce before I thought so myself.\"\n\n\"And had you made up your mind what to say to him?\"\n\n\"Yes, I had then. But I did not say it.\"\n\n\"Did not say what you had made up your mind to say?\"\n\n\"That was before all this had happened to papa.\"\n\n\"I understand you, dearest.\"\n\n\"When Miss Anne Prettyman told me that I should be ready with my\nanswer, and when I saw that Miss Prettyman herself used to let him\ncome to the house and seemed to wish that I should see him when he\ncame, and when he once was--so very gentle and kind, and when he said\nthat he wanted me to love Edith,-- Oh, mamma!\"\n\n\"Yes, darling, I know. Of course you loved him.\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma. And I do love him. How could one not love him?\"\n\n\"I love him,--for loving you.\"\n\n\"But, mamma, one is bound not to do a harm to any one that one loves.\nSo when he came to Allington I told him that I could not be his\nwife.\"\n\n\"Did you, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes; I did. Was I not right? Ought I to go to him to bring a\ndisgrace upon all the family, just because he is so good that he asks\nme? Shall I injure him because he wants to do me a service?\"\n\n\"If he loves you, Grace, the service he will require will be your\nlove in return.\"\n\n\"That is all very well, mamma,--in books; but I do not believe it in\nreality. Being in love is very nice, and in poetry they make it out\nto be everything. But I do not think I should make Major Grantly\nhappy if when I became his wife his own father and mother would not\nsee him. I know I should be so wretched, myself, that I could not\nlive.\"\n\n\"But would it be so?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I think it would. And the archdeacon is very rich, and can\nleave all his money away from Major Grantly if he pleases. Think what\nI should feel if I were the cause of Edith losing her fortune!\"\n\n\"But why do you suppose these terrible things?\"\n\n\"I have a reason for supposing them. This must be a secret. Miss Anne\nPrettyman wrote to me.\"\n\n\"I wish Miss Anne Prettyman's hand had been in the fire.\"\n\n\"No, mamma; no; she was right. Would not I have wished, do you think,\nto have learned all the truth about the matter before I answered him?\nBesides, it made no difference. I could have made no other answer\nwhile papa is under such a terrible ban. It is no time for us to\nthink of being in love. We have got to love each other. Isn't it\nso, mamma?\" The mother did not answer in words, but slipping down\non her knees before her child threw her arms round her girl's body\nin a close embrace. \"Dear mamma; dearest mamma; this is what I\nwanted;--that you should love me!\"\n\n\"Love you, my angel!\"\n\n\"And trust me;--and that we should understand each other, and stand\nclose by each other. We can do so much to comfort one another;--but\nwe cannot comfort other people.\"\n\n\"He must know that best himself, Grace;--but what did he say more to\nyou?\"\n\n\"I don't think he said anything more.\"\n\n\"He just left you then?\"\n\n\"He said one thing more.\"\n\n\"And what was that?\"\n\n\"He said;--but he had no right to say it.\"\n\n\"What was it, dear?\"\n\n\"That he knew I loved him, and that therefore-- But, mamma, do not\nthink of that. I will never be his wife,--never, in opposition to his\nfamily.\"\n\n\"But he did not take your answer?\"\n\n\"He must take it, mamma. He shall take it. If he can be stubborn, so\ncan I. If he knows how to think of me more than himself, I can think\nof him and Edith more than of myself. That is not quite all, mamma.\nThen he wrote to me. There is his letter.\"\n\nMrs. Crawley read the letter. \"I suppose you answered it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I answered it. It was very bad, my letter. I should think after\nthat he will never want to have anything more to say to me. I tried\nfor two days, but I could not write a nice letter.\"\n\n\"But what did you say?\"\n\n\"I don't in the least remember. It does not in the least signify now,\nbut it was such a bad letter.\"\n\n\"I daresay it was very nice.\"\n\n\"It was terribly stiff, and all about a gentleman.\"\n\n\"All about a gentleman! What do you mean, my dear?\"\n\n\"Gentleman is such a frightful word to have to use to a gentleman;\nbut I did not know what else to say. Mamma, if you please, we won't\ntalk about it;--not about the letter I mean. As for him, I'll\ntalk about him for ever if you like it. I don't mean to be a bit\nbroken-hearted.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that he is a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma, that he is; and it is that which makes me so proud.\nWhen I think of it, I can hardly hold myself. But now I've told you\neverything, and I'll go away, and go to bed.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nMR. TOOGOOD TRAVELS PROFESSIONALLY.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. Toogood paid another visit to Barsetshire, in order that he might\nget a little further information which he thought would be necessary\nbefore despatching his nephew upon the traces of Dean Arabin and\nhis wife. He went down to Barchester after his work was over by\nan evening train, and put himself up at \"The Dragon of Wantly,\"\nintending to have the whole of the next day for his work. Mr. Walker\nhad asked him to come and take a return pot-luck dinner with Mrs.\nWalker at Silverbridge; and this he had said that he would do. After\nhaving \"rummaged about for tidings\" in Barchester, as he called it,\nhe would take the train for Silverbridge, and would get back to\ntown in time for business on the third day. \"One day won't be much,\nyou know,\" he said to his partner, as he made half an apology for\nabsenting himself on business which was not to be in any degree\nremunerative. \"That sort of thing is very well when one does it\nwithout any expense,\" said Crump. \"So it is,\" said Toogood; \"and the\nexpense won't make it any worse.\" He had made up his mind, and it was\nnot probable that anything Mr. Crump might say would deter him.\n\nHe saw John Eames before he started. \"You'll be ready this day week,\nwill you?\" John Eames promised that he would. \"It will cost you some\nforty pounds, I should say. By George,--if you have to go on to\nJerusalem, it will cost you more.\" In answer to this, Johnny pleaded\nthat it would be as good as any other tour to him. He would see the\nworld. \"I'll tell you what,\" said Toogood; \"I'll pay half. Only you\nmustn't tell Crump. And it will be quite as well not to tell Maria.\"\nBut Johnny would hear nothing of this scheme. He would pay the entire\ncost of his own journey. He had lots of money, he said, and would\nlike nothing better. \"Then I'll run down,\" said Toogood, \"and rummage\nup what tidings I can. As for writing to the dean, what's the good of\nwriting to a man when you don't know where he is? Business letters\nalways lie at hotels for two months, and then come back with double\npostage. From all I can hear, you'll stumble on her before you find\nhim. If we do nothing else but bring him back, it will be a great\nthing to have the support of such a friend in the court. A Barchester\njury won't like to find a man guilty who is hand-and-glove with the\ndean.\"\n\nMr. Toogood reached the \"Dragon\" about eleven o'clock, and allowed\nthe boots to give him a pair of slippers and a candlestick. But\nhe would not go to bed just at that moment. He would go into the\ncoffee-room first, and have a glass of hot brandy-and-water. So the\nhot brandy-and-water was brought to him, and a cigar, and as he\nsmoked and drank he conversed with the waiter. The man was a waiter\nof the ancient class, a gray-haired waiter, with seedy clothes, and\na dirty towel under his arm; not a dapper waiter, with black shiny\nhair, and dressed like a guest for a dinner-party. There are two\ndistinct classes of waiters, and as far as I have been able to\nperceive, the special status of the waiter in question cannot be\ndecided by observation of the class of waiter to which he belongs. In\nsuch a town as Barchester you may find the old waiter with the dirty\ntowel in the head inn, or in the second-class inn, and so you may\nthe dapper waiter. Or you may find both in each, and not know which\nis senior waiter and which junior waiter. But for service I always\nprefer the old waiter with the dirty towel, and I find it more easy\nto satisfy him in the matter of sixpences when my relations with the\ninn come to an end.\n\n\"Have you been here long, John?\" said Mr. Toogood.\n\n\"A goodish many years, sir.\"\n\n\"So I thought, by the look of you. One can see that you belong in a\nway to the place. You do a good deal of business here, I suppose, at\nthis time of the year?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, pretty fair. The house ain't what it used to be, sir.\"\n\n\"Times are bad at Barchester,--are they?\"\n\n\"I don't know much about the times. It's the people is worse than the\ntimes, I think. They used to like to have a little bit of dinner now\nand again at a hotel;--and a drop of something to drink after it.\"\n\n\"And don't they like it now?\"\n\n\"I think they like it well enough, but they don't do it. I suppose\nit's their wives as don't let 'em come out and enjoy theirselves.\nThere used to be the Goose and Glee club;--that was once a month.\nThey've gone and clean done away with themselves,--that club has.\nThere's old Bumpter in the High Street,--he's the last of the old\nGeese. They died off, you see, and when Mr. Biddle died they wouldn't\nchoose another president. A club for having dinner, sir, ain't\nnothing without a president.\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"And there's the Freemasons. They must meet, you know, sir, in\ncourse, because of the dooties. But if you'll believe me, sir, they\ndon't so much as wet their whistles. They don't indeed. It always\nused to be a supper, and that was once a month. Now they pays a\nrent for the use of the room! Who is to get a living out of that,\nsir?--not in the way of a waiter, that is.\"\n\n\"If that's the way things are going on I suppose the servants leave\ntheir places pretty often?\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, sir. A man may do a deal worse than 'The\nDragon of Wantly.' Them as goes away to better themselves, often\nworses themselves, as I call it. I've seen a good deal of that.\"\n\n\"And you stick to the old shop?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I've been here fifteen year, I think it is. There's a many\ngoes away, as doesn't go out of their own heads, you know, sir.\"\n\n\"They get the sack, you mean?\"\n\n\"There's words between them and master,--or more likely, missus.\nThat's where it is. Servants is so foolish. I often tell 'em how\nwrong folks are to say that soft words butter no parsnips, and hard\nwords break no bones.\"\n\n\"I think you've lost some of the old hands here since this time last\nyear, John?\"\n\n\"You knows the house then, sir?\"\n\n\"Well;--I've been here before.\"\n\n\"There was four of them went, I think it's just about twelve months\nback, sir.\"\n\n\"There was a man in the yard I used to know, and last time I was down\nhere, I found that he was gone.\"\n\n\"There was one of 'em out of the yard, and two out of the house.\nMaster and them had got to very high words. There was poor Scuttle,\nwho had been post-boy at 'The Compasses' before he came here.\"\n\n\"He went away to New Zealand, didn't he?\"\n\n\"B'leve he did, sir; or to some foreign parts. And Anne, as was\nunder-chambermaid here; she went with him, fool as she was. They got\ntheirselves married and went off, and he was well nigh as old as me.\nBut seems he'd saved a little money, and that goes a long way with\nany girl.\"\n\n\"Was he the man who drove Mr. Soames that day the cheque was lost?\"\nMr. Toogood asked this question perhaps a little too abruptly. At any\nrate he obtained no answer to it. The waiter said he knew nothing\nabout Mr. Soames, or the cheque, and the lawyer suspecting that the\nwaiter was suspecting him, finished his brandy-and-water and went to\nbed.\n\n[Illustration: Mr. Toogood and the old Waiter.]\n\nEarly on the following morning he observed that he was specially\nregarded by a shabby-looking man, dressed in black, but in a black\nsuit that was very old, with a red nose, whom he had seen in the\nhotel on the preceding day; and he learned that this man was a cousin\nof the landlord,--one Dan Stringer,--who acted as a clerk in the\nhotel bar. He took an opportunity also of saying a word to Mr.\nStringer the landlord,--whom he found to be a somewhat forlorn and\ngouty individual, seated on cushions in a little parlour behind the\nbar. After breakfast he went out, and having twice walked round the\nCathedral close and inspected the front of the palace and looked up\nat the windows of the prebendaries' houses, he knocked at the door of\nthe deanery. The dean and Mrs. Arabin were on the Continent, he was\ntold. Then he asked for Mr. Harding, having learned that Mr. Harding\nwas Mrs. Arabin's father, and that he lived at the deanery. Mr.\nHarding was at home, but was not very well, the servant said. Mr.\nToogood, however, persevered, sending up his card, and saying that he\nwished to have a few minutes' conversation with Mr. Harding on very\nparticular business. He wrote a word upon his card before giving it\nto the servant,--\"about Mr. Crawley.\" In a few minutes he was shown\ninto the library, and had hardly time, while looking at the shelves,\nto remember what Mr. Crawley had said of his anger at the beautiful\nbindings, before an old man, very thin and very pale, shuffled into\nthe room. He stooped a good deal, and his black clothes were very\nloose about his shrunken limbs. He was not decrepit, nor did he seem\nto be one who had advanced to extreme old age; but yet he shuffled\nrather than walked, hardly raising his feet from the ground. Mr.\nToogood, as he came forward to meet him, thought that he had never\nseen a sweeter face. There was very much of melancholy in it, of that\nsoft sadness of age which seems to acknowledge, and in some sort to\nregret, the waning oil of life; but the regret to be read in such\nfaces has in it nothing of the bitterness of grief; there is no\nrepining that the end has come, but simply a touch of sorrow that so\nmuch that is dear must be left behind. Mr. Harding shook hands with\nhis visitor, and invited him to sit down, and then seated himself,\nfolding his hands together over his knees, and he said a few words in\na very low voice as to the absence of his daughter and of the dean.\n\n\"I hope you will excuse my troubling you,\" said Mr. Toogood.\n\n\"It is no trouble at all,--if I could be of any use. I don't know\nwhether it is proper, but may I ask whether you call as,--as,--as a\nfriend of Mr. Crawley's?\"\n\n\"Altogether as a friend, Mr. Harding.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of that; though of course I am well aware that the\ngentlemen engaged on the prosecution must do their duty. Still,--I\ndon't know,--somehow I would rather not hear them speak of this poor\ngentleman before the trial.\"\n\n\"You know Mr. Crawley, then?\"\n\n\"Very slightly,--very slightly indeed. He is a gentleman not much\ngiven to social habits, and has been but seldom here. But he is an\nold friend whom my son-in-law loves dearly.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear you say that, Mr. Harding. Perhaps before I go any\nfurther I ought to tell you that Mrs. Crawley and I are\nfirst-cousins.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed. Then you are a friend.\"\n\n\"I never saw him in my life till a few days ago. He is very queer\nyou know,--very queer indeed. I'm a lawyer, Mr. Harding, practising\nin London;--an attorney, that is.\" At each separate announcement\nMr. Harding bowed, and when Toogood named his special branch of his\nprofession Mr. Harding bowed lower than before, as though desirous of\nshowing that he had great respect for attorneys. \"And of course I'm\nanxious, if only out of respect for the family, that my wife's cousin\nshould pull through this little difficulty, if possible.\"\n\n\"And for the sake of the poor man himself too, and for his wife, and\nhis children;--and for the sake of the cloth.\"\n\n\"Exactly; taking it all together it's such a pity, you know. I think,\nMr. Harding, he can hardly have intended to steal the money.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he did not.\"\n\n\"It's very hard to be sure of anybody, Mr. Harding;--very hard.\"\n\n\"I feel quite sure that he did not. He has been a most pious,\nhard-working clergyman. I cannot bring myself to think that he is\nguilty. What does the Latin proverb say? 'No one of a sudden becomes\nmost base.'\"\n\n\"But the temptation, Mr. Harding, was very strong. He was awfully\nbadgered about his debts. That butcher in Silverbridge was playing\nthe mischief with him.\"\n\n\"All the butchers in Barsetshire could not make an honest man steal\nmoney, and I think that Mr. Crawley is an honest man. You'll excuse\nme for being a little hot about one of my own order.\"\n\n\"Why; he's my cousin,--or rather, my wife's. But the fact is, Mr.\nHarding, we must get hold of the dean as soon as possible; and I'm\ngoing to send a gentleman after him.\"\n\n\"To send a gentleman after him?\" said Mr. Harding, almost in dismay.\n\n\"Yes; I think that will be best.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he'll have to go a long way, Mr. Toogood.\"\n\n\"The dean, I'm told, is in Jerusalem.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he is,--or on his journey there. He's to be there for the\nEaster week, and Sunday week will be Easter Sunday. But why should\nthe gentleman want to go to Jerusalem after the dean?\"\n\nThen Mr. Toogood explained as well as he was able that the dean might\nhave something to say on the subject which would serve Mr. Crawley's\ndefence. \"We shouldn't leave any stone unturned,\" said Mr. Toogood.\n\"As far as I can judge, Crawley still thinks,--or half thinks,--that\nhe got the cheque from your son-in-law.\" Mr. Harding shook his\nhead sorrowfully. \"I'm not saying he did, you know,\" continued Mr.\nToogood. \"I can't see myself how it is possible;--but still, we ought\nnot to leave any stone unturned. And Mrs. Arabin,--can you tell me at\nall where we shall find her?\"\n\n\"Has she anything to do with it, Mr. Toogood?\"\n\n\"I can't quite say that she has, but it's just possible. As I said\nbefore, Mr. Harding, we mustn't leave a stone unturned. They're not\nexpected here till the end of April?\"\n\n\"About the 25th or 26th, I think.\"\n\n\"And the assizes are the 28th. The judges come into the city on that\nday. It will be too late to wait till then. We must have our defence\nready you know. Can you say where my friend will find Mrs. Arabin?\"\n\nMr. Harding began nursing his knee, patting it and being very tender\nto it, as he sat meditating with his head on one side,--meditating\nnot so much as to the nature of his answer as to that of the\nquestion. Could it be necessary that any emissary from a lawyer's\noffice should be sent after his daughter? He did not like the idea of\nhis Eleanor being disturbed by questions as to a theft. Though she\nhad been twice married and had a son who was now nearly a man, still\nshe was his Eleanor. But if it was necessary on Mr. Crawley's behalf,\nof course it must be done. \"Her last address was at Paris, sir; but\nI think she has gone on to Florence. She has friends there, and she\npurposes to meet the dean at Venice on his return.\" Then Mr. Harding\nturned the table and wrote on a card his daughter's address.\n\n\"I suppose Mrs. Arabin must have heard of the affair?\" said Mr.\nToogood.\n\n\"She had not done so when she last wrote. I mentioned it to her the\nother day, before I knew that she had left Paris. If my letters and\nher sister's letters have been sent on to her, she must know it now.\"\n\nThen Mr. Toogood got up to take his leave. \"You will excuse me for\ntroubling you, I hope, Mr. Harding.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, pray do not mention that. It is no trouble, if one could\nonly be of any service.\"\n\n\"One can always try to be of service. In these affairs so much is to\nbe done by rummaging about, as I always call it. There have been many\ntheatrical managers, you know, Mr. Harding, who have usually made up\ntheir pieces according to the dresses they have happened to have in\ntheir wardrobes.\"\n\n\"Have there, indeed, now? I never should have thought of that.\"\n\n\"And we lawyers have to do the same thing.\"\n\n\"Not with your clothes, Mr. Toogood?\"\n\n\"Not exactly with our clothes;--but with our information.\"\n\n\"I do not quite understand you, Mr. Toogood.\"\n\n\"In preparing a defence we have to rummage about and get up what we\ncan. If we can't find anything that suits us exactly, we are obliged\nto use what we do find as well as we can. I remember, when I was a\nyoung man, an ostler was to be tried for stealing some oats in the\nBorough; and he did steal them too, and sold them at a rag-shop\nregularly. The evidence against him was as plain as a pike-staff. All\nI could find out was that on a certain day a horse had trod on the\nfellow's foot. So we put it to the jury whether the man could walk as\nfar as the rag-shop with a bag of oats when he was dead lame;--and we\ngot him off.\"\n\n\"Did you though?\" said Mr. Harding.\n\n\"Yes, we did.\"\n\n\"And he was guilty?\"\n\n\"He had been at it regularly for months.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, dear! Wouldn't it have been better to have had\nhim punished for the fault,--gently; so as to warn him of the\nconsequences of such doings?\"\n\n\"Our business was to get him off,--and we got him off. It's my\nbusiness to get my cousin's husband off, if I can, and we must do it,\nby hook or crook. It's a very difficult piece of work, because he\nwon't let us employ a barrister. However, I shall have one in the\ncourt and say nothing to him about it at all. Good-by, Mr. Harding.\nAs you say, it would be a thousand pities that a clergyman should be\nconvicted of a theft;--and one so well connected too.\"\n\nMr. Harding, when he was left alone, began to turn the matter over\nin his mind and to reflect whether the thousand pities of which Mr.\nToogood had spoken appertained to the conviction of the criminal,\nor the doing of the crime. \"If he did steal the money I suppose he\nought to be punished, let him be ever so much a clergyman,\" said Mr.\nHarding to himself. But yet,--how terrible it would be! Of clergymen\nconvicted of fraud in London he had often heard; but nothing of the\nkind had ever disgraced the diocese to which he belonged since he had\nknown it. He could not teach himself to hope that Mr. Crawley should\nbe acquitted if Mr. Crawley were guilty;--but he could teach himself\nto believe that Mr. Crawley was innocent. Something of a doubt had\ncrept across his mind as he talked to the lawyer. Mr. Toogood, though\nMrs. Crawley was his cousin, seemed to believe that the money had\nbeen stolen; and Mr. Toogood as a lawyer ought to understand such\nmatters better than an old secluded clergyman in Barchester. But,\nnevertheless, Mr. Toogood might be wrong; and Mr. Harding succeeded\nin satisfying himself at last that he could not be doing harm in\nthinking that Mr. Toogood was wrong. When he had made up his mind\non this matter he sat down and wrote the following letter, which he\naddressed to his daughter at the post-office in Florence:--\n\n\n   Deanery, March --, 186--.\n\n   DEAREST NELLY,--\n\n   When I wrote on Tuesday I told you about poor Mr.\n   Crawley, that he was the clergyman in Barsetshire of\n   whose misfortune you read an account in Galignani's\n   Messenger,--and I think Susan must have written about it\n   also, because everybody here is talking of nothing else,\n   and because, of course, we know how strong a regard the\n   dean has for Mr. Crawley. But since that something has\n   occurred which makes me write to you again,--at once. A\n   gentleman has just been here, and has indeed only this\n   moment left me, who tells me that he is an attorney in\n   London, and that he is nearly related to Mrs. Crawley.\n   He seems to be a very good-natured man, and I daresay he\n   understands his business as a lawyer. His name is Toogood,\n   and he has come down as he says to get evidence to help\n   the poor gentleman on his trial. I cannot understand how\n   this should be necessary, because it seems to me that the\n   evidence should all be wanted on the other side. I cannot\n   for a moment suppose that a clergyman and a gentleman such\n   as Mr. Crawley should have stolen money, and if he is\n   innocent I cannot understand why all this trouble should\n   be necessary to prevent a jury finding him guilty.\n\n   Mr. Toogood came here because he wanted to see the\n   dean,--and you also. He did not explain, as far as I\n   can remember, why he wanted to see you; but he said it\n   would be necessary, and that he was going to send off a\n   messenger to find you first, and the dean afterwards. It\n   has something to do with the money which was given to\n   Mr. Crawley last year, and which, if I remember right,\n   was your present. But of course Mr. Toogood could not\n   have known anything about that. However, I gave him the\n   address,--poste restante, Florence,--and I daresay that\n   somebody will make you out before long, if you are still\n   stopping at Florence. I did not like letting him go\n   without telling you about it, as I thought that a lawyer's\n   coming to you would startle you.\n\n   The bairns are quite well, as I told you in my other\n   letter, and Miss Jones says that little Elly is as good\n   as gold. They are with me every morning and evening, and\n   behave like darling angels, as they are. Posy is my own\n   little jewel always. You may be quite sure I do nothing to\n   spoil them.\n\n   God bless you, dearest Nelly,\n   Your most affectionate father,\n\n   SEPTIMUS HARDING.\n\n\nAfter this he wrote another letter to his other daughter, Mrs.\nGrantly, telling her also of Mr. Toogood's visit; and then he spent\nthe remainder of the day thinking over the gravity of the occurrence.\nHow terrible would it be if a beneficed clergyman in the diocese\nshould really be found guilty of theft by a jury from the city! And\nthen he had always heard so high a character of this man from his\nson-in-law. No,--it was impossible to believe that Mr. Crawley had in\ntruth stolen a cheque for twenty pounds!\n\nMr. Toogood could get no other information in Barchester, and went on\nto Silverbridge early in the afternoon. He was half disposed to go\nby Hogglestock and look up his cousin, whom he had never seen, and\nhis cousin's husband, upon whose business he was now intent; but on\nreflection he feared that he might do more harm than good. He had\nquite appreciated the fact that Mr. Crawley was not like other men.\n\"The man's not above half-saved,\" he had said to his wife,--meaning\nthereby to insinuate that the poor clergyman was not in full\npossession of his wits. And, to tell the truth of Mr. Toogood, he\nwas a little afraid of his relative. There was a something in Mr.\nCrawley's manner, in spite of his declared poverty, and in spite also\nof his extreme humility, which seemed to announce that he expected to\nbe obeyed when he spoke on any point with authority. Mr. Toogood had\nnot forgotten the tone in which Mr. Crawley had said to him, \"Sir,\nthis thing you cannot do.\" And he thought that, upon the whole, he\nhad better not go to Hogglestock on this occasion.\n\nWhen at Silverbridge, he began at once to \"rummage about.\" His chief\nrummaging was to be done at Mr. Walker's table; but before dinner he\nhad time to call upon the magistrate's clerk, and ask a few questions\nas to the proceedings at the sitting from which Mr. Crawley was\ncommitted. He found a very taciturn old man, who was nearly as\ndifficult to deal with in any rummaging process as a porcupine. But,\nnevertheless, at last he reached a state of conversation which was\nnot absolutely hostile. Mr. Toogood pleaded that he was the poor\nman's cousin,--pleaded that, as the family lawyer, he was naturally\nthe poor man's protector at such a time as the present,--pleaded also\nthat as the poor man was so very poor, no one else could come forward\non his behalf,--and in this way somewhat softened the hard sharpness\nof the old porcupine's quills. But after all this, there was very\nlittle to be learned from the old porcupine. \"There was not a\nmagistrate on the bench,\" he said, \"who had any doubt that the\nevidence was sufficient to justify them in sending the case to the\nassizes. They had all regretted,\"--the porcupine said in his softest\nmoment,--\"that the gentleman had come there without a legal adviser.\"\n\"Ah, that's been the mischief of it all!\" said Mr. Toogood, dashing\nhis hand against the porcupine's mahogany table. \"But the facts were\nso strong, Mr. Toogood!\" \"Nobody there to soften 'em down, you know,\"\nsaid Mr. Toogood, shaking his head. Very little more than this was\nlearned from the porcupine; and then Mr. Toogood went away, and\nprepared for Mr. Walker's dinner.\n\nMr. Walker had invited Dr. Tempest and Miss Anne Prettyman and Major\nGrantly to meet Mr. Toogood, and had explained, in a manner intended\nto be half earnest and half jocose, that though Mr. Toogood was an\nattorney, like himself, and was at this moment engaged in a noble\nway on behalf of his cousin's husband, without any idea of receiving\nback even the money which he would be out of pocket; still he wasn't\nquite,--not quite, you know--\"not quite so much of a gentleman as\nI am,\"--Mr. Walker would have said, had he spoken out freely that\nwhich he insinuated. But he contented himself with the emphasis he\nput upon the \"not quite,\" which expressed his meaning fully. And Mr.\nWalker was correct in his opinion of Mr. Toogood. As regards the two\nattorneys I will not venture to say that either of them was not a\n\"perfect gentleman.\" A perfect gentleman is a thing which I cannot\ndefine. But undoubtedly Mr. Walker was a bigger man in his way than\nwas Mr. Toogood in his, and did habitually consort in the county\nof Barsetshire with men of higher standing than those with whom Mr.\nToogood associated in London.\n\nIt seemed to be understood that Mr. Crawley was to be the general\nsubject of conversation, and no one attempted to talk about anything\nelse. Indeed, at this time, very little else was talked about in\nthat part of the county;--not only because of the interest naturally\nattaching to the question of the suspected guilt of a parish\nclergyman, but because much had become lately known of Mr. Crawley's\ncharacter, and because it was known also that an internecine feud\nhad arisen between him and the bishop. It had undoubtedly become the\ngeneral opinion that Mr. Crawley had picked up and used a cheque\nwhich was not his own;--that he had, in fact, stolen it; but there\nwas, in spite of that belief, a general wish that he might be\nacquitted and left in his living. And when the tidings of Mr.\nCrawley's victory over the bishop at the palace had become bruited\nabout, popular sympathy went with the victor. The theft was, as\nit were, condoned, and people made excuses which were not always\nrational, but which were founded on the instincts of true humanity.\nAnd now the tidings of another stage in the battle, as fought against\nMr. Crawley by the bishop, had gone forth through the county, and men\nhad heard that the rural dean was to be instructed to make inquiries\nwhich should be preliminary to proceedings against Mr. Crawley in\nan ecclesiastical court. Dr. Tempest, who was now about to meet Mr.\nToogood at Mr. Walker's, was the rural dean to whom Mr. Crawley would\nhave to submit himself in any such inquiry; but Dr. Tempest had not\nas yet received from the bishop any official order on the subject.\n\n\"We are so delighted to think that you have taken up your cousin's\ncase,\" said Mrs. Walker to Mr. Toogood, almost in a whisper.\n\n\"He is not just my cousin, himself,\" said Mr. Toogood, \"but of course\nit's all the same thing. And as to taking up his case, you see, my\ndear madam, he won't let me take it up.\"\n\n\"I thought you had. I thought you were down here about it?\"\n\n\"Only on the sly, Mrs. Walker. He has such queer ideas that he will\nnot allow a lawyer to be properly employed; and you can't conceive\nhow hard that makes it. Do you know him, Mrs. Walker?\"\n\n\"We know his daughter Grace.\" And then Mrs. Walker whispered\nsomething further, which we may presume to have been an intimation\nthat the gentleman opposite,--Major Grantly,--was supposed by some\npeople to be very fond of Miss Grace Crawley.\n\n\"Quite a child, isn't she?\" said Toogood, whose own daughter, now\nabout to be married, was three or four years older than Grace.\n\n\"She's beyond being a child, I think. Of course she is young.\"\n\n\"But I suppose this affair will knock all that on the head,\" said the\nlawyer.\n\n\"I do not know how that may be; but they do say he is very much\nattached to her. The major is a man of family, and of course it would\nbe very disagreeable if Mr. Crawley were found guilty.\"\n\n\"Very disagreeable, indeed; but, upon my word, Mrs. Walker, I don't\nknow what to say about it.\"\n\n\"You think it will go against him, Mr. Toogood?\" Mr. Toogood shook\nhis head, and on seeing this, Mrs. Walker sighed deeply.\n\n\"I can only say that I have heard nothing from the bishop as yet,\"\nsaid Dr. Tempest, after the ladies had left the room. \"Of course, if\nhe thinks well to order it, the inquiry must be made.\"\n\n\"But how long would it take?\" asked Mr. Walker.\n\n\"Three months, I should think,--or perhaps more. Of course Crawley\nwould do all that he could to delay us, and I am not at all sure that\nwe should be in any very great hurry ourselves.\"\n\n\"Who are the 'we,' doctor?\" said Mr. Walker.\n\n\"I cannot make such an inquiry by myself, you know. I suppose the\nbishop would ask me to select two or four other clergymen to act with\nme. That's the usual way of doing it. But you may be quite sure of\nthis, Walker; the assizes will be over, and the jury have found their\nverdict long before we have settled our preliminaries.\"\n\n\"And what will be the good of your going on after that?\"\n\n\"Only this good:--if the unfortunate man be convicted--\"\n\n\"Which he won't,\" said Mr. Toogood, who thought it expedient to put\non a bolder front in talking of the matter to the rural dean, than he\nhad assumed in his whispered conversation with Mrs. Walker.\n\n\"I hope not, with all my heart,\" said the doctor. \"But, perhaps, for\nthe sake of the argument, the supposition may be allowed to pass.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said Mr. Toogood. \"For the sake of the argument, it\nmay pass.\"\n\n\"If he be convicted, then, I suppose, there will be an end of the\nquestion. He would be sentenced for not less, I should say, than\ntwelve months; and after that--\"\n\n\"And would be as good a parson of Hogglestock when he came out of\nprison as when he went in,\" said Mr. Walker. \"The conviction and\njudgment in a civil court would not touch his temporality.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mr. Toogood.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the doctor. \"We all know that; and in the event\nof Mr. Crawley coming back to his parish it would be open to the\nbishop to raise the question as to his fitness for the duties.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't he be as fit as any one else?\" said Mr. Toogood.\n\n\"Simply because he would have been found to be a thief,\" said the\ndoctor. \"You must excuse me, Mr. Toogood, but it's only for the sake\nof the argument.\"\n\n\"I don't see what that has to do with it,\" said Mr. Toogood. \"He\nwould have undergone his penalty.\"\n\n\"It is preferable that a man who preaches from a pulpit should not\nhave undergone such a penalty,\" said the doctor. \"But in practice,\nunder such circumstances,--which we none of us anticipate, Mr.\nToogood,--the living should no doubt be vacated. Mr. Crawley would\nprobably hardly wish to come back. The jury will do their work before\nwe can do ours,--will do it on a much better base than any we can\nhave; and, when they have done it, the thing ought to be finished. If\nthe jury acquit him, the bishop cannot proceed any further. If he be\nfound guilty I think that the resignation of the living must follow.\"\n\n\"It is all spite, then, on the bishop's part?\" said the major.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said the doctor. \"The poor man is weak; that is all. He\nis driven to persecute because he cannot escape persecution himself.\nBut it may really be a question whether his present proceeding is not\nright. If I were bishop I should wait till the trial was over; that\nis all.\"\n\nFrom this and from much more that was said during the evening on the\nsame subject Mr. Toogood gradually learned the position which Mr.\nCrawley and the question of Mr. Crawley's guilt really held in the\ncounty, and he returned to town resolved to go on with the case.\n\n\"I'll have a barrister down express, and I'll defend him in his\nown teeth,\" he said to his wife. \"There'll be a scene in court,\nI daresay, and the man will call upon his own counsel to hold his\ntongue and shut up his brief; and, as far as I can see, counsel\nin such a case would have no alternative. But there would come an\nexplanation,--how Crawley was too honourable to employ a man whom\nhe could not pay, and there would be a romance, and it would all go\ndown with the jury. One wants sympathy in such a case as that--not\nevidence.\"\n\n\"And how much will it cost, Tom?\" said Maria, dolefully.\n\n\"Only a trifle. We won't think of that yet. There's John Eames is\ngoing all the way to Jerusalem, out of his pocket.\"\n\n\"But Johnny hasn't got twelve children, Tom.\"\n\n\"One doesn't have a cousin in trouble every day,\" said Toogood. \"And\nthen you see there's something very pretty in the case. It's quite a\npleasure getting it up.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nMR. CROSBIE GOES INTO THE CITY.\n\n\n\"I've known the City now for more than ten years, Mr. Crosbie, and\nI never knew money to be so tight as it is at this moment. The best\ncommercial bills going can't be done under nine, and any other\nkind of paper can't so much as get itself looked at.\" Thus spoke\nMr. Musselboro. He was seated in Dobbs Broughton's arm-chair in\nDobbs Broughton's room in Hook Court, on the hind legs of which he\nwas balancing himself comfortably; and he was communicating his\nexperience in City matters to our old friend, Adolphus Crosbie,--of\nwhom we may surmise that he would not have been there, at that\nmoment, in Hook Court, if things had been going well with him. It was\nnow past eleven o'clock, and he should have been at his office at\nthe West End. His position in his office was no doubt high enough\nto place him beyond the reach of any special inquiry as to such\nabsences; but it is generally felt that when the Crosbies of the West\nEnd have calls into the City about noon, things in the world are not\ngoing well with them. The man who goes into the City to look for\nmoney is generally one who does not know where to get money when he\nwants it. Mr. Musselboro on this occasion kept his hat on his head,\nand there was something in the way in which he balanced his chair\nwhich was in itself an offence to Mr. Crosbie's personal dignity. It\nwas hardly as yet two months since Mr. Dobbs Broughton had assured\nhim in that very room that there need not be the slightest anxiety\nabout his bill. Of course it could be renewed,--the commission being\nduly paid. As Mr. Dobbs Broughton explained on that occasion, that\nwas his business. There was nothing he liked so much as renewing\nbills for such customers as Mr. Crosbie; and he was very candid at\nthat meeting, explaining how he did this branch of his business,\nraising money on his own credit at four or five per cent., and\nlending it on his own judgment at eight or nine. Mr. Crosbie did not\nfeel himself then called upon to exclaim that what he was called upon\nto pay was about twelve, perfectly understanding the comfort and\ngrace of euphony; but he had turned it over in his mind, considering\nwhether twelve per cent. was not more than he ought to be mulcted\nfor the accommodation he wanted. Now, at the moment, he would have\nbeen glad to get it from Mr. Musselboro, without further words, for\ntwenty.\n\nThings had much changed with Adolphus Crosbie when he was driven to\nmake morning visits to such a one as Mr. Musselboro with the view of\nhaving a bill renewed for two hundred and fifty pounds. In his early\nlife he had always had the merit of being a careful man as to money.\nIn some other respects he had gone astray very foolishly,--as has\nbeen partly explained in our earlier chapters; but up to the date\nof his marriage with Lady Alexandrina De Courcy he had never had\ndealings in Hook Court or in any such locality. Money troubles\nhad then come upon him. Lady Alexandrina, being the daughter of a\ncountess, had high ideas; and when, very shortly after his marriage,\nhe had submitted to a separation from his noble wife, he had found\nhimself and his income to be tied up inextricably in the hands of\none Mr. Mortimer Gazebee, a lawyer who had married one of his wife's\nsisters. It was not that Mr. Gazebee was dishonest; nor did Crosbie\nsuspect him of dishonesty; but the lawyer was so wedded to the\ninterest of the noble family with which he was connected, that he\nworked for them all as an inferior spider might be supposed to\nwork, which, from the infirmity of its nature, was compelled by\nits instincts to be catching flies always for superior spiders. Mr.\nMortimer Gazebee had in this way entangled Mr. Crosbie in his web on\nbehalf of those noble spiders, the De Courcys, and our poor friend,\nin his endeavour to fight his way through the web, had fallen into\nthe hands of the Hook Court firm of Mrs. Van Siever, Dobbs Broughton,\nand Musselboro.\n\n\"Mr. Broughton told me when I was last here,\" said Crosbie, \"that\nthere would be no difficulty about it.\"\n\n\"And it was renewed then; wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Of course it was,--for two months. But he was speaking of a\ncontinuation of renewal.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we can't do it, Mr. Crosbie. I'm afraid we can't, indeed.\nMoney is so awful tight.\"\n\n\"Of course I must pay what you choose to charge me.\"\n\n\"It isn't that, Mr. Crosbie. The bill is out for collection, and must\nbe collected. In times like these we must draw ourselves in a little,\nyou know. Two hundred and fifty pounds isn't a great deal of money,\nyou will say; but every little helps, you know; and, besides, of\ncourse we go upon a system. Business is business, and must not be\nmade pleasure of. I should have had a great deal of pleasure in doing\nthis for you, but it can't be done in the way of business.\"\n\n\"When will Broughton be here?\"\n\n\"He may be in at any time;--I can't say when. I suppose he's down at\nthe court now.\"\n\n\"What court?\"\n\n\"Capel Court.\"\n\n\"I suppose I can see him there?\" said Crosbie.\n\n\"If you catch him you can see him, of course. But what good will\nthat do you, Mr. Crosbie? I tell you that we can't do it for you.\nIf Broughton was here this moment it couldn't make the slightest\ndifference.\"\n\nNow Mr. Crosbie had an idea that Mr. Musselboro, though he sat in\nDobbs Broughton's seat and kept on his hat, and balanced his chair on\ntwo legs, was in truth nothing more than a clerk. He did not quite\nunderstand the manner in which the affairs of the establishment were\nworked, though he had been informed that Mrs. Van Siever was one of\nthe partners. That Dobbs Broughton was the managing man, who really\ndid the business, he was convinced; and he did not therefore like to\nbe answered peremptorily by such a one as Musselboro. \"I should wish\nto see Mr. Broughton,\" he said.\n\n\"You can call again,--or you can go down to the court if you like\nit. But you may take this as an answer from me that the bill can't\nbe renewed by us.\" At this moment the door of the room was opened,\nand Dobbs Broughton himself came into it. His face was not at all\npleasant, and any one might have seen with half an eye that the\nmoney-market was a great deal tighter than he liked it to be. \"Here\nis Mr. Crosbie here,--about that bill,\" said Musselboro.\n\n\"Mr. Crosbie must take up his bill; that's all,\" said Dobbs\nBroughton.\n\n\"But it doesn't suit me to take it up,\" said Crosbie.\n\n\"Then you must take it up without suiting you,\" said Dobbs Broughton.\n\nIt might have been seen, I said, with half an eye, that Mr. Broughton\ndid not like the state of the money-market; and it might also be\nseen with the other half that he had been endeavouring to mitigate\nthe bitterness of his dislike by alcoholic aid. Musselboro at once\nperceived that his patron and partner was half drunk, and Crosbie\nwas aware that he had been drinking. But, nevertheless, it was\nnecessary that something more should be said. The bill would be due\nto-morrow,--was payable at Crosbie's bankers; and, as Mr. Crosbie too\nwell knew, there were no funds there for the purpose. And there were\nother purposes, very needful, for which Mr. Crosbie's funds were at\nthe present moment unfortunately by no means sufficient. He stood\nfor a few moments thinking what he would do;--whether he would leave\nthe drunken man and his office and let the bill take its chance, or\nwhether he would make one more effort for an arrangement. He did\nnot for a moment believe that Broughton himself was subject to any\npecuniary difficulty. Broughton lived in a big house, as rich men\nlive, and had a name for commercial success. It never occurred to\nCrosbie that it was a matter of great moment to Dobbs Broughton\nhimself that the bill should be taken up. Crosbie still thought that\nMusselboro was his special enemy, and that Broughton had joined\nMusselboro in his hostility simply because he was too drunk to know\nbetter. \"You might, at any rate, answer me civilly, Mr. Broughton,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"I know nothing about civility with things as they are at present,\"\nsaid Broughton. \"Civil by ----! There's nothing so civil as paying\nmoney when you owe it. Musselboro, reach me down the decanter and\nsome glasses. Perhaps Mr. Crosbie will wet his whistle.\"\n\n\"He don't want any wine,--nor you either,\" said Musselboro.\n\n\"What's up now?\" said Broughton, staggering across the room towards\na cupboard, in which it was his custom to keep a provision of that\ncomfort which he needed at the present moment. \"I suppose I may stand\na glass of wine to a fellow in my own room, if I like it.\"\n\n\"I will take no wine, thank you,\" said Crosbie.\n\n\"Then you can do the other thing. When I ask a gentleman to take a\nglass of wine, there is no compulsion. But about the bill there is\ncompulsion. Do you understand that? You may drink, or let it alone;\nbut pay you must. Why, Mussy, what d'ye think?--there's Carter,\nRicketts and Carter;--I'm blessed if Carter just now didn't beg for\ntwo months, as though two months would be all the world to him, and\nthat for a trumpery five hundred pounds. I never saw money like it\nis now; never.\" To this appeal, Musselboro made no reply, not caring,\nperhaps, at the present moment to sustain his partner. He still\nbalanced himself in his chair, and still kept his hat on his head.\nEven Mr. Crosbie began to perceive that Mr. Musselboro's genius was\nin the ascendant in Hook Court.\n\n\"I can hardly believe,\" said Crosbie, \"that things can be so bad that\nI cannot have a bill for two hundred and fifty pounds renewed when I\nam willing to pay for the accommodation. I have not done much in the\nway of bills, but I never had one dishonoured yet.\"\n\n\"Don't let this be the first,\" said Dobbs Broughton.\n\n\"Not if I can prevent it,\" said Crosbie. \"But, to tell you the\ntruth, Mr. Broughton, my bill will be dishonoured unless I can have\nit renewed. If it does not suit you to do it, I suppose you can\nrecommend me to some one who can make it convenient.\"\n\n\"Why don't you go to your bankers?\" said Musselboro.\n\n\"I never did ask my bankers for anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Then you should try what your credit with them is worth,\" said\nBroughton. \"It isn't worth much here, as you can perceive. Ha, ha,\nha!\"\n\nCrosbie, when he heard this, became very angry; and Musselboro,\nperceiving this, got out of his chair, so that he might be in\nreadiness to prevent any violence, if violence were attempted.\n\"It really is no good your staying here,\" he said. \"You see that\nBroughton has been drinking. There's no knowing what he may say or\ndo.\"\n\n\"You be blowed,\" said Broughton, who had taken the arm-chair as soon\nas Musselboro had left it.\n\n\"But you may believe me in the way of business,\" continued\nMusselboro, \"when I tell you that it really does not suit us to renew\nthe bill. We're pressed ourselves, and we must press others.\"\n\n\"And who will do it for me?\" said Crosbie, almost in despair.\n\n\"There are Burton and Bangles there, the wine-merchants down in the\nyard; perhaps they may accommodate you. It's all in their line; but\nI'm told they charge uncommon dear.\"\n\n\"I don't know Messrs. Burton and Bangles,\" said Crosbie.\n\n\"That needn't stand in your way. You tell them where you come from,\nand they'll make inquiry. If they think it's about right, they'll\ngive you the money; and if they don't, they won't.\"\n\nMr. Crosbie then left the office without exchanging another word with\nDobbs Broughton, and went down into Hook Court. As he descended the\nstairs he turned over in his mind the propriety of going to Messrs.\nBurton and Bangles with the view of relieving himself from his\npresent difficulty. He knew that it was ruinous. Dealings even with\nsuch men as Dobbs Broughton and Musselboro, whom he presumed to be\nmilder in their greed than Burton and Bangles, were, all of them,\nsteps on the road to ruin. But what was he to do? If his bill were\ndishonoured, the fact would certainly become known at his office, and\nhe might even ultimately be arrested. In the doorway at the bottom\nof the stairs he stood for some moments, looking over at Burton and\nBangles', and he did not at all like the aspect of the establishment.\nInside the office he could see a man standing with a cigar in his\nmouth, very resplendent with a new hat,--with a hat remarkable\nfor the bold upward curve of its rim, and this man was copiously\ndecorated with a chain and seals hanging about widely over his\nwaistcoat. He was leaning with his back against the counter, and was\ntalking to some one on the other side of it. There was something in\nthe man's look and manner that was utterly repulsive to Crosbie. He\nwas more vulgar to the eye even than Musselboro, and his voice, which\nCrosbie could hear as he stood in the other doorway, was almost as\ndetestable as that of Dobbs Broughton in his drunkenness. Crosbie\ndid not doubt that this was either Burton or Bangles, and that the\nman standing inside was either Bangles or Burton. He could not\nbring himself to accost these men and tell them of his necessities,\nand propose to them that they should relieve him. In spite of what\nMusselboro had just said to him, he could not believe it possible\nthat he should succeed, were he to do so without some introduction.\nSo he left Hook Court and went out into the lane, hearing as he went\nthe loud voice of the man with the turned-up hat and the chain.\n\nBut what was he to do? At the outset of his pecuniary troubles, when\nhe first found it necessary to litigate some question with the De\nCourcy people, and withstand the web which Mortimer Gazebee wove so\nassiduously, his own attorney had introduced him to Dobbs Broughton,\nand the assistance which he had needed had come to him, at any rate,\nwithout trouble. He did not especially like Mr. Broughton; and when\nMr. Broughton first invited him to come and eat a little bit of\ndinner, he had told himself with painful remorse that in his early\ndays he had been accustomed to eat his little bits of dinner with\npeople of a different kind. But there had been nothing really painful\nin this. Since his marriage with a daughter of the De Courcys,--by\nwhich marriage he had intended to climb to the highest pinnacle of\nsocial eating and drinking,--he had gradually found himself to be\nfalling in the scale of such matters, and could bring himself to\ndine with a Dobbs Broughton without any violent pain. But now he had\nfallen so low that Dobbs Broughton had insulted him, and he was in\nsuch distress that he did not know where to turn for ten pounds. Mr.\nGazebee had beaten him at litigation, and his own lawyer had advised\nhim that it would be foolish to try the matter further. In his\nmarriage with the noble daughter of the De Courcys he had allowed the\nframers of the De Courcy settlement to tie him up in such a way that\nnow, even when chance had done so much for him in freeing him from\nhis wife, he was still bound to the De Courcy faction. Money had been\npaid away,--on his behalf, as alleged by Mr. Gazebee,--like running\nwater; money for furniture, money for the lease of a house, money\nwhen he had been separated from his wife, money while she was living\nabroad. It had seemed to him that he had been made to pay for the\nentire support of the female moiety of the De Courcy family which had\nsettled itself at Baden-Baden, from the day, and in some respects\nfrom before the day, on which his wife had joined that moiety. He\nhad done all in his power to struggle against these payments, but\nevery such struggle had only cost him more money. Mr. Gazebee had\nwritten to him the civilest notes; but every note seemed to cost him\nmoney,--every word of each note seemed to find its way into some\nbill. His wife had died and her body had been brought back, with all\nthe pomp befitting the body of an earl's daughter, that it might be\nlaid with the old De Courcy dust,--at his expense. The embalming of\nher dear remains had cost a wondrous sum, and was a terrible blow\nupon him. All these items were showered upon him by Mr. Gazebee\nwith the most courteously worded demands for settlement as soon as\nconvenient. And then, when he applied that Lady Alexandrina's small\nfortune should be made over to him,--according to a certain agreement\nunder which he had made over all his possessions to his wife, should\nshe have survived him,--Mr. Gazebee expressed a mild opinion that he\nwas wrong in his law, and blandly recommended an amicable lawsuit.\nThe amicable lawsuit was carried on. His own lawyer seemed to\nthrow him over. Mr. Gazebee was successful in everything. No money\ncame to him. Money was demanded from him on old scores and on new\nscores,--and all that he received to console him for what he had lost\nwas a mourning ring with his wife's hair,--for which, with sundry\nother mourning rings, he had to pay,--and an introduction to Mr.\nDobbs Broughton. To Mr. Dobbs Broughton he owed five hundred pounds;\nand as regarded a bill for the one-half of that sum which was due\nto-morrow, Mr. Dobbs Broughton had refused to grant him renewal for a\nsingle month!\n\nI know no more uncomfortable walking than that which falls to the lot\nof men who go into the City to look for money, and who find none. Of\nall the lost steps trodden by men, surely the steps lost after that\nfashion are the most melancholy. It is not only that they are so\nvain, but that they are accompanied by so killing a sense of shame!\nTo wait about in dingy rooms, which look on to bare walls, and are\napproached through some Hook Court; or to keep appointments at a low\ncoffee-house, to which trystings the money-lender will not trouble\nhimself to come unless it pleases him; to be civil, almost suppliant,\nto a cunning knave whom the borrower loathes; to be refused thrice,\nand then cheated with his eyes open on the fourth attempt; to submit\nhimself to vulgarity of the foulest kind, and to have to seem to like\nit; to be badgered, reviled, and at last accused of want of honesty\nby the most fraudulent of mankind; and at the same time to be clearly\nconscious of the ruin that is coming,--this is the fate of him who\ngoes into the City to find money, not knowing where it is to be\nfound!\n\nCrosbie went along the lane into Lombard Street, and then he stood\nstill for a moment to think. Though he knew a good deal of affairs in\ngeneral, he did not quite know what would happen to him if his bill\nshould be dishonoured. That somebody would bring it to him noted,\nand require him instantly to put his hand into his pocket and bring\nout the amount of the bill, plus the amount of certain expenses, he\nthought that he did know. And he knew that were he in trade he would\nbecome a bankrupt; and he was well aware that such an occurrence\nwould prove him to be insolvent. But he did not know what his\ncreditors would immediately have the power of doing. That the fact of\nthe bill having been dishonoured would reach the Board under which\nhe served,--and, therefore, also the fact that he had had recourse\nto such bill transactions,--this alone was enough to fill him with\ndismay. In early life he had carried his head so high, he had been so\nmuch more than a mere Government clerk, that the idea of the coming\ndisgrace almost killed him. Would it not be well that he should put\nan end to himself, and thus escape? What was there in the world now\nfor which it was worth his while to live? Lily, whom he had once\ngained, and by that gain had placed himself high in all hopes of\nhappiness and riches,--whom he had then thrown away from him, and who\nhad again seemed to be almost within his reach,--Lily had so refused\nhim that he knew not how to approach her with a further prayer. And,\nhad she not refused him, how could he have told her of his load of\ndebt? As he stood at the corner where the lane runs into Lombard\nStreet, he came for a while to think almost more of Lily than of his\nrejected bill. Then, as he thought of both his misfortunes together,\nhe asked himself whether a pistol would not conveniently put an end\nto them together.\n\nAt that moment a loud, harsh voice greeted his ear. \"Hallo, Crosbie,\nwhat brings you so far east? One does not often see you in the City.\"\nIt was the voice of Sir Raffle Buffle, which in former days had been\nvery odious to Crosbie's ears;--for Sir Raffle Buffle had once been\nthe presiding genius of the office to which Crosbie still belonged.\n\n\"No, indeed, not very often,\" said Crosbie, smiling. Who can tell,\nwho has not felt it, the pain that goes to the forcing of such\nsmiles? But Sir Raffle was not an acutely observant person, and did\nnot see that anything was wrong.\n\n\"I suppose you're doing a little business?\" said Sir Raffle. \"If a\nman has kept a trifle of money by him, this certainly is the time for\nturning it. You have always been wide awake about such things.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Crosbie. If he could only make up his mind that he\nwould shoot himself, would it not be a pleasant thing to inflict some\ncondign punishment on this odious man before he left the world? But\nCrosbie knew that he was not going to shoot himself, and he knew also\nthat he had no power of inflicting condign punishment on Sir Raffle\nBuffle. He could only hate the man, and curse him inwardly.\n\n\"Ah, ha!\" said Sir Raffle. \"You wouldn't be here unless you knew\nwhere a good thing is to be picked up. But I must be off. I'm on the\nRocky Mountain Canal Company Directory. I'm not above taking my two\nguineas a day. Good-by, my boy. Remember me to old Optimist.\" And so\nSir Raffle passed on, leaving Crosbie still standing at the corner of\nthe lane.\n\nWhat was he to do? This interruption had at least seemed to drive\nLily from his mind, and to send his ideas back to the consideration\nof his pecuniary difficulties. He thought of his own bank, a West-End\nestablishment at which he was personally known to many of the clerks,\nand where he had been heretofore treated with great consideration.\nBut of late his balances had been very low, and more than once he had\nbeen reminded that he had overdrawn his account. He knew well that\nthe distinguished firm of Bounce, Bounce, and Bounce would not cash a\nbill for him or lend him money without security. He did not even dare\nto ask them to do so.\n\nOn a sudden he jumped into a cab, and was driven back to his office.\nA thought had come upon him. He would throw himself upon the kindness\nof a friend there. Hitherto he had contrived to hold his head so high\nabove the clerks below him, so high before the Commissioners who were\nabove him, that none there suspected him to be a man in difficulty.\nIt not seldom happens that a man's character stands too high for his\ninterest,--so high that it cannot be maintained, and so high that any\nfall will be dangerous. And so it was with Crosbie and his character\nat the General Committee Office. The man to whom he was now thinking\nof applying as his friend, was a certain Mr. Butterwell, who had been\nhis predecessor in the secretary's chair, and who now filled the less\nonerous but more dignified position of a Commissioner. Mr. Crosbie\nhad somewhat despised Mr. Butterwell, and had of late years not been\naverse to showing that he did so. He had snubbed Mr. Butterwell, and\nMr. Butterwell, driven to his wits' ends, had tried a fall or two\nwith him. In all these struggles Crosbie had had the best of it,\nand Butterwell had gone to the wall. Nevertheless, for the sake of\nofficial decency, and from certain wise remembrances of the sources\nof official comfort and official discomfort, Mr. Butterwell had\nalways maintained a show of outward friendship with the secretary.\nThey smiled and were gracious, called each other Butterwell\nand Crosbie, and abstained from all cat-and-dog absurdities.\nNevertheless, it was the frequently expressed opinion of every clerk\nin the office that Mr. Butterwell hated Mr. Crosbie like poison. This\nwas the man to whom Crosbie suddenly made up his mind that he would\nhave recourse.\n\nAs he was driven back to his office he resolved that he would make a\nplunge at once at the difficulty. He knew that Butterwell was fairly\nrich, and he knew also that he was good-natured,--with that sort of\nsleepy good-nature which is not active for philanthropic purposes,\nbut which dislikes to incur the pain of refusing. And then Mr.\nButterwell was nervous, and if the thing was managed well, he might\nbe cheated out of an assent, before time had been given him in which\nto pluck up courage for refusing. But Crosbie doubted his own courage\nalso,--fearing that if he gave himself time for hesitation he would\nhesitate, and that, hesitating, he would feel the terrible disgrace\nof the thing and not do it. So, without going to his own desk, or\nridding himself of his hat, he went at once to Butterwell's room.\nWhen he opened the door, he found Mr. Butterwell alone, reading The\nTimes. \"Butterwell,\" said he, beginning to speak before he had even\nclosed the door, \"I have come to you in great distress. I wonder\nwhether you can help me; I want you to lend me five hundred pounds?\nIt must be for not less than three months.\"\n\nMr. Butterwell dropped the paper from his hands, and stared at the\nsecretary over his spectacles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\n\"I SUPPOSE I MUST LET YOU HAVE IT.\"\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCrosbie had been preparing the exact words with which he assailed Mr.\nButterwell for the last quarter of an hour, before they were uttered.\nThere is always a difficulty in the choice, not only of the words\nwith which money should be borrowed, but of the fashion after which\nthey should be spoken. There is the slow deliberate manner, in using\nwhich the borrower attempts to carry the wished-for lender along with\nhim by force of argument, and to prove that the desire to borrow\nshows no imprudence on his own part, and that a tendency to lend\nwill show none on the part of the intended lender. It may be said\nthat this mode fails oftener than any other. There is the piteous\nmanner,--the plea for commiseration. \"My dear fellow, unless you will\nsee me through now, upon my word I shall be very badly off.\" And this\nmanner may be divided again into two. There is the plea piteous with\na lie, and the plea piteous with a truth. \"You shall have it again\nin two months as sure as the sun rises.\" That is generally the plea\npiteous with a lie. Or it may be as follows: \"It is only fair to\nsay that I don't quite know when I can pay it back.\" This is the\nplea piteous with a truth, and upon the whole I think that this is\ngenerally the most successful mode of borrowing. And there is the\nassured demand,--which betokens a close intimacy. \"Old fellow, can\nyou let me have thirty pounds? No? Just put your name, then, on the\nback of this, and I'll get it done in the City.\" The worst of that\nmanner is, that the bill so often does not get itself done in the\nCity. Then there is the sudden attack,--that being the manner to\nwhich Crosbie had recourse in the present instance. That there are\nother modes of borrowing by means of which youth becomes indebted to\nage, and love to respect, and ignorance to experience, is a matter\nof course. It will be understood that I am here speaking only of\nborrowing and lending between the Butterwells and Crosbies of the\nworld. \"I have come to you in great distress,\" said Crosbie. \"I\nwonder whether you can help me. I want you to lend me five hundred\npounds.\" Mr. Butterwell, when he heard the words, dropped the paper\nwhich he was reading from his hand, and stared at Crosbie over his\nspectacles.\n\n\"Five hundred pounds,\" he said. \"Dear me, Crosbie; that's a large sum\nof money.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is,--a very large sum. Half that is what I want at once; but\nI shall want the other half in a month.\"\n\n\"I thought that you were always so much above the world in money\nmatters. Gracious me;--nothing that I have heard for a long time has\nastonished me more. I don't know why, but I always thought that you\nhad your things so very snug.\"\n\nCrosbie was aware that he had made one very great step towards\nsuccess. The idea had been presented to Mr. Butterwell's mind, and\nhad not been instantly rejected as a scandalously iniquitous idea, as\nan idea to which no reception could be given for a moment. Crosbie\nhad not been treated as was the needy knife-grinder, and had ground\nto stand upon while he urged his request. \"I have been so pressed\nsince my marriage,\" he said, \"that it has been impossible for me to\nkeep things straight.\"\n\n\"But Lady Alexandrina--\"\n\n\"Yes; of course; I know. I do not like to trouble you with my private\naffairs;--there is nothing, I think, so bad as washing one's dirty\nlinen in public;--but the truth is, that I am only now free from the\nrapacity of the De Courcys. You would hardly believe me if I told you\nwhat I've had to pay. What do you think of two hundred and forty-five\npounds for bringing her body over here, and burying it at De Courcy?\"\n\n\"I'd have left it where it was.\"\n\n\"And so would I. You don't suppose I ordered it to be done. Poor dear\nthing. If it could do her any good, God knows I would not begrudge\nit. We had a bad time of it when we were together, but I would have\nspared nothing for her, alive or dead, that was reasonable. But to\nmake me pay for bringing the body over here, when I never had a\nshilling with her! By George, it was too bad. And that oaf John De\nCourcy,--I had to pay his travelling bill too.\"\n\n\"He didn't come to be buried;--did he?\"\n\n\"It's too disgusting to talk of, Butterwell; it is indeed. And when\nI asked for her money that was settled upon me,--it was only two\nthousand pounds,--they made me go to law, and it seems there was no\ntwo thousand pounds to settle. If I like, I can have another lawsuit\nwith the sisters, when the mother is dead. Oh, Butterwell, I have\nmade such a fool of myself. I have come to such shipwreck! Oh,\nButterwell, if you could but know it all.\"\n\n\"Are you free from the De Courcys now?\"\n\n\"I owe Gazebee, the man who married the other woman, over a thousand\npounds. But I pay that off at two hundred a year, and he has a policy\non my life.\"\n\n\"What do you owe that for?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me. Not that I mind telling you;--furniture, and the lease\nof a house, and his bill for the marriage settlement,--d---- him.\"\n\n\"God bless me. They seem to have been very hard upon you.\"\n\n\"A man doesn't marry an earl's daughter for nothing, Butterwell. And\nthen to think what I lost! It can't be helped now, you know. As a man\nmakes his bed he must lie on it. I am sometimes so mad with myself\nwhen I think over it all,--that I should like to blow my brains out.\"\n\n\"You must not talk in that way, Crosbie. I hate to hear a man talk\nlike that.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that I shall. I'm too much of a coward, I fancy.\" A\nman who desires to soften another man's heart, should always abuse\nhimself. In softening a woman's heart, he should abuse her. \"But life\nhas been so bitter with me for the last three years! I haven't had an\nhour of comfort;--not an hour. I don't know why I should trouble you\nwith all this, Butterwell. Oh,--about the money; yes; that's just\nhow I stand. I owed Gazebee something over a thousand pounds, which\nis arranged as I have told you. Then there were debts, due by my\nwife,--at least some of them were, I suppose,--and that horrid,\nghastly funeral,--and debts, I don't doubt, due by the cursed old\ncountess. At any rate, to get myself clear I raised something over\nfour hundred pounds, and now I owe five which must be paid, part\nto-morrow, and the remainder this day month.\"\n\n\"And you've no security?\"\n\n\"Not a rag, not a shred, not a line, not an acre. There's my salary,\nand after paying Gazebee what comes due to him, I can manage to let\nyou have the money within twelve months,--that is, if you can lend it\nme. I can just do that and live; and if you will assist me with the\nmoney, I will do so. That's what I've brought myself to by my own\nfolly.\"\n\n\"Five hundred pounds is such a large sum of money.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is.\"\n\n\"And without any security!\"\n\n\"I know, Butterwell, that I've no right to ask for it. I feel that.\nOf course I should pay you what interest you please.\"\n\n\"Money's about seven now,\" said Butterwell.\n\n\"I've not the slightest objection to seven per cent.,\" said Crosbie.\n\n\"But that's on security,\" said Butterwell.\n\n\"You can name your own terms,\" said Crosbie.\n\nMr. Butterwell got out of his chair, and walked about the room with\nhis hands in his pockets. He was thinking at that moment what Mrs.\nButterwell would say to him. \"Will an answer do to-morrow morning?\"\nhe said. \"I would much rather have it to-day,\" said Crosbie. Then Mr.\nButterwell took another turn about the room. \"I suppose I must let\nyou have it,\" he said.\n\n\"Butterwell,\" said Crosbie, \"I'm eternally obliged to you. It's\nhardly too much to say that you've saved me from ruin.\"\n\n\"Of course I was joking about interest,\" said Butterwell. \"Five\nper cent. is the proper thing. You'd better let me have a little\nacknowledgment. I'll give you the first half to-morrow.\"\n\nThey were genuine tears which filled Crosbie's eyes, as he seized\nhold of the senior's hands. \"Butterwell,\" he said, \"what am I to say\nto you?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all,--nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Your kindness makes me feel that I ought not to have come to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense. By-the-by, would you mind telling Thompson to bring\nthose papers to me which I gave him yesterday? I promised Optimist I\nwould read them before three, and it's past two now.\" So saying he\nsat himself down at his table, and Crosbie felt that he was bound to\nleave the room.\n\nMr. Butterwell, when he was left alone, did not read the papers which\nThompson brought him; but sat, instead, thinking of his five hundred\npounds. \"Just put them down,\" he said to Thompson. So the papers were\nput down, and there they lay all that day and all the next. Then\nThompson took them away again, and it is to be hoped that somebody\nread them. Five hundred pounds! It was a large sum of money, and\nCrosbie was a man for whom Mr. Butterwell in truth felt no very\nstrong affection. \"Of course he must have it now,\" he said to\nhimself. \"But where should I be if anything happened to him?\" And\nthen he remembered that Mrs. Butterwell especially disliked Mr.\nCrosbie,--disliked him because she knew that he snubbed her husband.\n\"But it's hard to refuse, when one man has known another for more\nthan ten years.\" Then he comforted himself somewhat with the\nreflection, that Crosbie would no doubt make himself more pleasant\nfor the future than he had done lately, and with a second reflection,\nthat Crosbie's life was a good life,--and with a third, as to his own\ngreat goodness, in assisting a brother officer. Nevertheless, as he\nsat looking out of the omnibus-window, on his journey home to Putney,\nhe was not altogether comfortable in his mind. Mrs. Butterwell was a\nvery prudent woman.\n\nBut Crosbie was very comfortable in his mind on that afternoon. He\nhad hardly dared to hope for success, but he had been successful. He\nhad not even thought of Butterwell as a possible fountain of supply,\ntill his mind had been brought back to the affairs of his office,\nby the voice of Sir Raffle Buffle at the corner of the street. The\nidea that his bill would be dishonoured, and that tidings of his\ninsolvency would be conveyed to the Commissioners at his Board,\nhad been dreadful to him. The way in which he had been treated by\nMusselboro and Dobbs Broughton had made him hate City men, and what\nhe supposed to be City ways. Now there had come to him a relief which\nsuddenly made everything feel light. He could almost think of Mr.\nMortimer Gazebee without disgust. Perhaps after all there might be\nsome happiness yet in store for him. Might it not be possible that\nLily would yet accept him in spite of the chilling letter,--the\nfreezing letter which he had received from Lily's mother? Of one\nthing he was quite certain. If ever he had an opportunity of pleading\nhis own cause with her, he certainly would tell her everything\nrespecting his own money difficulties.\n\nIn that last resolve I think we may say that he was right. If Lily\nwould ever listen to him again at all, she certainly would not be\ndeterred from marrying him by his own story of his debts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nLILY DALE GOES TO LONDON.\n\n\nOne morning towards the end of March the squire rapped at the window\nof the drawing-room of the Small House, in which Mrs. Dale and her\ndaughter were sitting. He had a letter in his hand, and both Lily and\nher mother knew that he had come down to speak about the contents of\nthe letter. It was always a sign of good-humour on the squire's part,\nthis rapping at the window. When it became necessary to him in his\ngloomy moods to see his sister-in-law, he would write a note to her,\nand she would go across to him at the Great House. At other times,\nif, as Lily would say, he was just then neither sweet nor bitter, he\nwould go round to the front door and knock, and be admitted after the\nmanner of ordinary people; but when he was minded to make himself\nthoroughly pleasant he would come and rap at the drawing-room window,\nas he was doing now.\n\n\"I'll let you in, uncle; wait a moment,\" said Lily, as she unbolted\nthe window which opened out upon the lawn. \"It's dreadfully cold, so\ncome in as fast as you can.\"\n\n\"It's not cold at all,\" said the squire. \"It's more like spring than\nany morning we've had yet. I've been sitting without a fire.\"\n\n\"You won't catch us without one for the next two months; will he,\nmamma? You have got a letter, uncle. Is it for us to see?\"\n\n\"Well,--yes; I've brought it down to show you. Mary, what do you\nthink is going to happen?\"\n\nA terrible idea occurred to Mrs. Dale at that moment, but she was\nmuch too wise to give it expression. Could it be possible that the\nsquire was going to make a fool of himself and get married? \"I am\nvery bad at guessing,\" said Mrs. Dale. \"You had better tell us.\"\n\n\"Bernard is going to be married,\" said Lily.\n\n\"How did you know?\" said the squire.\n\n\"I didn't know. I only guessed.\"\n\n\"Then you've guessed right,\" said the squire, a little annoyed at\nhaving his news thus taken out of his mouth.\n\n\"I am so glad,\" said Mrs. Dale; \"and I know from your manner that you\nlike the match.\"\n\n\"Well,--yes. I don't know the young lady, but I think that upon the\nwhole I do like it. It's quite time, you know, that he got married.\"\n\n\"He's not thirty yet,\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\"He will be, in a month or two.\"\n\n\"And who is it, uncle?\"\n\n\"Well;--as you're so good at guessing, I suppose you can guess that?\"\n\n\"It's not that Miss Partridge he used to talk about?\"\n\n\"No; it's not Miss Partridge,--I'm glad to say. I don't believe that\nthe Partridges have a shilling among them.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose it's an heiress?\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\"No; not an heiress; but she will have some money of her own. And she\nhas connexions in Barsetshire, which makes it pleasant.\"\n\n\"Connexions in Barsetshire! Who can it be?\" said Lily.\n\n\"Her name is Emily Dunstable,\" said the squire, \"and she is the\nniece of that Miss Dunstable who married Dr. Thorne and who lives at\nChaldicotes.\"\n\n\"She was the woman who had millions upon millions,\" said Lily, \"all\ngot by selling ointment.\"\n\n\"Never mind how it was got,\" said the squire, angrily. \"Miss\nDunstable married most respectably, and has always made a most\nexcellent use of her money.\"\n\n\"And will Bernard's wife have all her fortune?\" asked Lily.\n\n\"She will have twenty thousand pounds the day she marries, and I\nsuppose that will be all.\"\n\n\"And quite enough, too,\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\"It seems that old Dr. Dunstable, as he was called, who, as Lily\nsays, sold the ointment, quarrelled with his son or with his son's\nwidow, and left nothing either to her or her child. The mother is\ndead, and the aunt, Dr. Thorne's wife, has always provided for the\nchild. That's how it is, and Bernard is going to marry her. They are\nto be married at Chaldicotes in May.\"\n\n\"I am delighted to hear it,\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\"I've known Dr. Thorne for the last forty years;\" and the squire now\nspoke in a low melancholy tone. \"I've written to him to say that the\nyoung people shall have the old place up there to themselves if they\nlike it.\"\n\n\"What! and turn you out?\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\"That would not matter,\" said the squire.\n\n\"You'd have to come and live with us,\" said Lily, taking him by the\nhand.\n\n\"It doesn't matter much now where I live,\" said the squire.\n\n\"Bernard will never consent to that,\" said Mrs. Dale.\n\n\"I wonder whether she'll ask me to be a bridesmaid?\" said Lily. \"They\nsay that Chaldicotes is such a pretty place, and I should see all\nthe Barsetshire people that I've been hearing about from Grace. Poor\nGrace! I know that the Grantlys and the Thornes are very intimate.\nFancy Bernard having twenty thousand pounds from the making of\nointment!\"\n\n\"What does it matter to you where it comes from?\" said the squire,\nhalf in anger.\n\n\"Not in the least; only it sounds so odd. I do hope she's a nice\ngirl.\"\n\nThen the squire produced a photograph of Emily Dunstable which his\nnephew had sent to him, and they all pronounced her to be very\npretty, to be very much like a lady, and to be very good-humoured.\nThe squire was evidently pleased with the match, and therefore the\nladies were pleased also. Bernard Dale was the heir to the estate,\nand his marriage was of course a matter of moment; and as on such\nproperties as that of Allington money is always wanted, the squire\nmay be forgiven for the great importance which he attached to the\nyoung lady's fortune. \"Bernard could hardly have married prudently\nwithout any money,\" he said,--\"unless he had chosen to wait till I\nam gone.\"\n\n[Illustration: They pronounced her to be very much like a Lady.]\n\n\"And then he would have been too old to marry at all,\" said Lily.\n\nBut the squire's budget of news had not yet been emptied. He told\nthem soon afterwards that he himself had been summoned up to London.\nBernard had written to him, begging him to come and see the young\nlady; and the family lawyer had written also, saying that his\npresence in town would be very desirable. \"It is very troublesome,\nof course; but I shall go,\" said the squire. \"It will do you all the\ngood in the world,\" said Mrs. Dale; \"and of course you ought to know\nher personally before the marriage.\" And then the squire made a clean\nbreast of it and declared his full purpose. \"I was thinking that,\nperhaps, Lily would not object to go up to London with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, uncle Christopher, I should so like it,\" said Lily.\n\n\"If your mamma does not object.\"\n\n\"Mamma never objects to anything. I should like to see her objecting\nto that!\" And Lily shook her head at her mother.\n\n\"Bernard says that Miss Dunstable particularly wants to see you.\"\n\n\"Does she, indeed? And I particularly want to see Miss Dunstable.\nHow nice! Mamma, I don't think I've ever been in London since I wore\nshort frocks. Do you remember taking us to the pantomime? Only think\nhow many years ago that is. I'm quite sure it's time that Bernard\nshould get married. Uncle, I hope you're prepared to take me to the\nplay.\"\n\n\"We must see about that!\"\n\n\"And the opera, and Madame Tussaud, and the Horticultural Gardens,\nand the new conjuror who makes a woman lie upon nothing. The idea\nof my going to London! And then I suppose I shall be one of the\nbridesmaids. I declare a new vista of life is opening out to me!\nMamma, you mustn't be dull while I'm away. It won't be very long,\nI suppose, uncle?\"\n\n\"About a month, probably,\" said the squire.\n\n\"Oh, mamma; what will you do?\"\n\n\"Never mind me, Lily.\"\n\n\"You must get Bell and the children to come. But I cannot imagine\nliving away from home a month. I was never away from home a month in\nmy life.\"\n\nAnd Lily did go up to town with her uncle, two days only having been\nallowed to her for her preparations. There was very much for her to\nthink of in such a journey. It was not only that she would see Emily\nDunstable who was to be her cousin's wife, and that she would go to\nthe play and visit the new conjuror's entertainment, but that she\nwould be in the same city both with Adolphus Crosbie and with John\nEames. Not having personal experience of the wideness of London, and\nof the wilderness which it is;--of the distance which is set there\nbetween persons who are not purposely brought together--it seemed\nto her fancy as though for this month of her absence from home she\nwould be brought into close contiguity with both her lovers. She\nhad hitherto felt herself to be at any rate safe in her fortress at\nAllington. When Crosbie had written to her mother, making a renewed\noffer which had been rejected, Lily had felt that she certainly need\nnot see him unless it pleased her to do so. He could hardly force\nhimself upon her at Allington. And as to John Eames, though he would,\nof course, be welcome at Allington as often as he pleased to show\nhimself, still there was a security in the place. She was so much at\nhome there that she could always be mistress of the occasion. She\nknew that she could talk to him at Allington as though from ground\nhigher than that on which he stood himself; but she felt that this\nwould hardly be the case if she should chance to meet him in London.\nCrosbie probably would not come in her way. Crosbie she thought,--and\nshe blushed for the man she loved, as the idea came across her\nmind,--would be afraid of meeting her uncle. But John Eames would\ncertainly find her; and she was led by the experience of latter days\nto imagine that John would never cross her path without renewing his\nattempts.\n\nBut she said no word of all this, even to her mother. She was\ncontented to confine her outspoken expectations to Emily Dunstable,\nand the play, and the conjuror. \"The chances are ten to one against\nmy liking her, mamma,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't see that, my dear.\"\n\n\"I feel to be too old to think that I shall ever like any more new\npeople. Three years ago I should have been quite sure that I should\nlove a new cousin. It would have been like having a new dress. But\nI've come to think that an old dress is the most comfortable, and an\nold cousin certainly the best.\"\n\nThe squire had had taken for them a gloomy lodging in Sackville\nStreet. Lodgings in London are always gloomy. Gloomy colours wear\nbetter than bright ones for curtains and carpets, and the keepers\nof lodgings in London seem to think that a certain dinginess of\nappearance is respectable. I never saw a London lodging in which\nany attempt at cheerfulness had been made, and I do not think that\nany such attempt, if made, would pay. The lodging-seeker would be\nfrightened and dismayed, and would unconsciously be led to fancy\nthat something was wrong. Ideas of burglars and improper persons\nwould present themselves. This is so certainly the case that I doubt\nwhether any well-conditioned lodging-house matron could be induced to\nshow rooms that were prettily draped or pleasantly coloured. The big\ndrawing-room and two large bedrooms which the squire took, were all\nthat was proper, and were as brown, and as gloomy, and as ill-suited\nfor the comforts of ordinary life as though they had been prepared\nfor two prisoners. But Lily was not so ignorant as to expect cheerful\nlodgings in London, and was satisfied. \"And what are we to do now?\"\nsaid Lily, as soon as they found themselves settled. It was still\nMarch, and whatever may have been the nature of the weather at\nAllington, it was very cold in London. They reached Sackville\nStreet about five in the evening, and an hour was taken up in\nunpacking their trunks and making themselves as comfortable as their\ncircumstances allowed. \"And now what are we to do?\" said Lily.\n\n\"I told them to have dinner for us at half-past six.\"\n\n\"And what after that? Won't Bernard come to us to-night? I expected\nhim to be standing on the door-steps waiting for us with his bride in\nhis hand.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose Bernard will be here to-night,\" said the squire. \"He\ndid not say that he would, and as for Miss Dunstable, I promised to\ntake you to her aunt's house to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But I wanted to see her to-night. Well;--of course bridesmaids\nmust wait upon brides. And ladies with twenty thousand pounds can't\nbe expected to run about like common people. As for Bernard,--but\nBernard never was in a hurry.\" Then they dined, and when the squire\nhad very nearly fallen asleep over a bottle of port wine which had\nbeen sent in for him from some neighbouring public-house, Lily began\nto feel that it was very dull. And she looked round the room, and\nshe thought that it was very ugly. And she calculated that thirty\nevenings so spent would seem to be very long. And she reflected that\nthe hours were probably going much more quickly with Emily Dunstable,\nwho, no doubt, at this moment had Bernard Dale by her side. And then\nshe told herself that the hours were not tedious with her at home,\nwhile sitting with her mother, with all her daily occupations within\nher reach. But in so telling herself she took herself to task,\ninquiring of herself whether such an assurance was altogether true.\nWere not the hours sometimes tedious even at home? And in this way\nher mind wandered off to thoughts upon life in general, and she\nrepeated to herself over and over again the two words which she had\ntold John Eames that she would write in her journal. The reader will\nremember those two words;--Old Maid. And she had written them in her\nbook, making each letter a capital, and round them she had drawn a\nscroll, ornamented after her own fashion, and she had added the date\nin quaintly formed figures,--for in such matters Lily had some little\nskill and a dash of fun to direct it; and she had inscribed below it\nan Italian motto,--\"Who goes softly, goes safely;\" and above her work\nof art she had put a heading--\"As arranged by Fate for L. D.\" Now she\nthought of all this, and reflected whether Emily Dunstable was in\ntruth very happy. Presently the tears came into her eyes, and she got\nup and went to the window, as though she were afraid that her uncle\nmight wake and see them. And as she looked out on the blank street,\nshe muttered a word or two--\"Dear mother! Dearest mother!\" Then the\ndoor was opened, and her cousin Bernard announced himself. She had\nnot heard his knock at the door as she had been thinking of the two\nwords in her book.\n\n\"What; Bernard!--ah, yes, of course,\" said the squire, rubbing his\neyes as he strove to wake himself. \"I wasn't sure you would come, but\nI'm delighted to see you. I wish you joy with all my heart,--with all\nmy heart.\"\n\n\"Of course, I should come,\" said Bernard. \"Dear Lily, this is so good\nof you. Emily is so delighted.\" Then Lily spoke her congratulations\nwarmly, and there was no trace of a tear in her eyes, and she was\nthoroughly happy as she sat by her cousin's side and listened to\nhis raptures about Emily Dunstable. \"And you will be so fond of her\naunt,\" he said.\n\n\"But is she not awfully rich?\" said Lily.\n\n\"Frightfully rich,\" said Bernard; \"but really you would hardly find\nit out if nobody told you. Of course she lives in a big house, and\nhas a heap of servants; but she can't help that.\"\n\n\"I hate a heap of servants,\" said Lily.\n\nThen there came another knock at the door, and who should enter the\nroom but John Eames. Lily for a moment was taken aback, but it was\nonly for a moment. She had been thinking so much of him that his\npresence disturbed her for an instant. \"He probably will not know\nthat I am here,\" she had said to herself; but she had not yet been\nthree hours in London, and he was already with her! At first he\nhardly spoke to her, addressing himself to the squire. \"Lady Julia\ntold me you were to be here, and as I start for the Continent early\nto-morrow morning, I thought you would let me come and see you before\nI went.\"\n\n\"I'm always glad to see you, John,\" said the squire,--\"very glad. And\nso you're going abroad, are you?\"\n\nThen Johnny congratulated his old acquaintance, Bernard Dale, as to\nhis coming marriage, and explained to them how Lady Julia in one\nof her letters had told him all about it, and had even given him\nthe number in Sackville Street. \"I suppose she learned it from you,\nLily,\" said the squire. \"Yes, uncle, she did.\" And then there came\nquestions as to John's projected journey to the Continent, and\nhe explained that he was going on law-business, on behalf of Mr.\nCrawley, to catch the dean and Mrs. Arabin, if it might be possible.\n\"You see, sir, Mr. Toogood, who is Mr. Crawley's cousin, and also his\nlawyer, is my cousin, too; and that's why I'm going.\" And still there\nhad been hardly a word spoken between him and Lily.\n\n\"But you're not a lawyer, John; are you?\" said the squire.\n\n\"No. I'm not a lawyer myself.\"\n\n\"Nor a lawyer's clerk?\"\n\n\"Certainly not a lawyer's clerk,\" said Johnny, laughing.\n\n\"Then why should you go?\" asked Bernard Dale.\n\nThen Johnny had to explain; and in doing so he became very eloquent\nas to the hardships of Mr. Crawley's case. \"You see, sir, nobody can\npossibly believe that such a man as that stole twenty pounds.\"\n\n\"I do not for one,\" said Lily.\n\n\"God forbid that I should say he did,\" said the squire.\n\n\"I'm quite sure he didn't,\" said Johnny, warming to his subject. \"It\ncouldn't be that such a man as that should become a thief all at\nonce. It's not human nature, sir; is it?\"\n\n\"It is very hard to know what is human nature,\" said the squire.\n\n\"It's the general opinion down in Barsetshire that he did steal it,\"\nsaid Bernard. \"Dr. Thorne was one of the magistrates who committed\nhim, and I know he thinks so.\"\n\n\"I don't blame the magistrates in the least,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"That's kind of you,\" said the squire.\n\n\"Of course you'll laugh at me, sir; but you'll see that we shall come\nout right. There's some mystery in it of which we haven't got at the\nbottom as yet; and if there is anybody that can help us it's the\ndean.\"\n\n\"If the dean knows anything, why has he not written and told what he\nknows?\" said the squire.\n\n\"That's what I can't say. The dean has not had an opportunity of\nwriting since he heard,--even if he has yet heard,--that Mr. Crawley\nis to be tried. And then he and Mrs. Arabin are not together. It's\na long story, and I will not trouble you with it all; but at any\nrate I'm going off to-morrow. Lily, can I do anything for you in\nFlorence?\"\n\n\"In Florence?\" said Lily; \"and are you really going to Florence? How\nI envy you.\"\n\n\"And who pays your expenses?\" said the squire.\n\n\"Well;--as to my expenses, they are to be paid by a person who won't\nraise any unpleasant questions about the amount.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said the squire.\n\n\"He means himself,\" said Lily.\n\n\"Is he going to do it out of his own pocket?\"\n\n\"He is,\" said Lily, looking at her lover.\n\n\"I'm going to have a trip for my own fun,\" said Johnny, \"and I shall\npick up evidence on the road, as I'm going;--that's all.\"\n\nThen Lily began to take an active part in the conversation, and a\ngreat deal was said about Mr. Crawley, and about Grace, and Lily\ndeclared that she would be very anxious to hear any news which John\nEames might be able to send. \"You know, John, how fond we are of your\ncousin Grace, at Allington? Are we not, uncle?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said the squire. \"I thought her a very nice girl.\"\n\n\"If you should be able to learn anything that may be of use, John,\nhow happy you will be.\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"And I think it so good of you to go, John. But it is just like you.\nYou were always generous.\" Soon after that he got up and went. It\nwas very clear to him that he would have no moment in which to say\na word alone to Lily; and if he could find such a moment, what good\nwould such a word do him? It was as yet but a few weeks since she had\npositively refused him. And he too remembered very well those two\nwords which she had told him that she would write in her book. As\nhe had been coming to the house he had told himself that his coming\nwould be,--could be of no use. And yet he was disappointed with the\nresult of his visit, although she had spoken to him so sweetly.\n\n\"I suppose you'll be gone when I come back?\" he said.\n\n\"We shall be here a month,\" said the squire.\n\n\"I shall be back long before that, I hope,\" said Johnny. \"Good-by,\nsir. Good-by, Dale. Good-by, Lily.\" And he put out his hand to her.\n\n\"Good-by, John.\" And then she added, almost in a whisper, \"I think\nyou are very, very right to go.\" How could he fail after that to hope\nas he walked home that she might still relent. And she also thought\nmuch of him, but her thoughts of him made her cling more firmly than\never to the two words. She could not bring herself to marry him; but,\nat least, she would not break his heart by becoming the wife of any\none else. Soon after this Bernard Dale went also. I am not sure that\nhe had been well pleased at seeing John Eames become suddenly the\nhero of the hour. When a young man is going to perform so important\nan act as that of marriage, he is apt to think that he ought to be\nthe hero of the hour himself--at any rate among his own family.\n\nEarly on the next morning Lily was taken by her uncle to call upon\nMrs. Thorne, and to see Emily Dunstable. Bernard was to meet them\nthere, but it had been arranged that they should reach the house\nfirst. \"There is nothing so absurd as these introductions,\" Bernard\nhad said. \"You go and look at her, and when you've had time to look\nat her, then I'll come!\" So the squire and Lily went off to look at\nEmily Dunstable.\n\n\"You don't mean to say that she lives in that house?\" said Lily, when\nthe cab was stopped before an enormous mansion in one of the most\nfashionable of the London squares.\n\n\"I believe she does,\" said the squire.\n\n\"I never shall be able to speak to anybody living in such a house as\nthat,\" said Lily. \"A duke couldn't have anything grander.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Thorne is richer than half the dukes,\" said the squire. Then\nthe door was opened by a porter, and Lily found herself within the\nhall. Everything was very great, and very magnificent, and, as she\nthought, very uncomfortable. Presently she heard a loud jovial voice\non the stairs. \"Mr. Dale, I'm delighted to see you. And this is your\nniece Lily. Come up, my dear. There is a young woman upstairs, dying\nto embrace you. Never mind the umbrella. Put it down anywhere. I want\nto have a look at you, because Bernard swears that you're so pretty.\"\nThis was Mrs. Thorne, once Miss Dunstable, the richest woman in\nEngland, and the aunt of Bernard's bride. The reader may perhaps\nremember the advice which she once gave to Major Grantly, and her\nenthusiasm on that occasion. \"There she is, Mr. Dale; what do you\nthink of her?\" said Mrs. Thorne, as she opened the door of a small\nsitting-room wedged in between two large saloons, in which Emily\nDunstable was sitting.\n\n\"Aunt Martha, how can you be so ridiculous?\" said the young lady.\n\n\"I suppose it is ridiculous to ask the question to which one really\nwants to have an answer,\" said Mrs. Thorne. \"But Mr. Dale has, in\ntruth, come to inspect you, and to form an opinion; and, in honest\ntruth, I shall be very anxious to know what he thinks,--though, of\ncourse, he won't tell me.\"\n\nThe old man took the girl in his arms, and kissed her on both cheeks.\n\"I have no doubt you'll find out what I think,\" he said, \"though I\nshould never tell you.\"\n\n\"I generally do find out what people think,\" she said. \"And so you're\nLily Dale?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm Lily Dale.\"\n\n\"I have so often heard of you, particularly of late; for you must\nknow that a certain Major Grantly is a friend of mine. We must take\ncare that that affair comes off all right, must we not?\"\n\n\"I hope it will.\" Then Lily turned to Emily Dunstable, and, taking\nher hand, went up and sat beside her, while Mrs. Thorne and the\nsquire talked of the coming marriage. \"How long have you been\nengaged?\" said Lily.\n\n\"Really engaged, about three weeks. I think it is not more than three\nweeks ago.\"\n\n\"How very discreet Bernard has been. He never told us a word about it\nwhile it was going on.\"\n\n\"Men never do tell, I suppose,\" said Emily Dunstable.\n\n\"Of course you love him very dearly?\" said Lily, not knowing what\nelse to say.\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\n\"So do we. You know he's almost a brother to us; that is, to me and\nmy sister. We never had a brother of our own.\" And so the morning was\npassed till Lily was told by her uncle to come away, and was told\nalso by Mrs. Thorne that she was to dine with them in the square on\nthat day. \"You must not be surprised that my husband is not here,\"\nshe said. \"He is a very odd sort of man, and he never comes to London\nif he can help it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nTHE BAYSWATER ROMANCE.\n\n\nEames had by no means done his work for that evening when he left Mr.\nDale and Lily at their lodgings. He had other business on hand to\nwhich he had promised to give attention, and another person to see\nwho would welcome his coming quite as warmly, though by no means as\npleasantly, as Lily Dale. It was then just nine o'clock, and as he\nhad told Miss Demolines,--Madalina we may as well call her now,--that\nhe would be in Porchester Terrace by nine at the latest, it was\nincumbent on him to make haste. He got into a cab, and bid the cabman\ndrive hard, and lighting a cigar, began to inquire of himself whether\nit was well for him to hurry away from the presence of Lily Dale\nto that of Madalina Demolines. He felt that he was half-ashamed of\nwhat he was doing. Though he declared to himself over and over again\nthat he never had said a word, and never intended to say a word, to\nMadalina, which all the world might not hear, yet he knew that he was\ndoing amiss. He was doing amiss, and half repented it, and yet he\nwas half proud of it. He was most anxious to be able to give himself\ncredit for his constancy to Lily Dale; to be able to feel that he\nwas steadfast in his passion; and yet he liked the idea of amusing\nhimself with his Bayswater romance, as he would call it, and was not\nwithout something of conceit as he thought of the progress he had\nmade in it. \"Love is one thing and amusement is another,\" he said to\nhimself as he puffed the cigar-smoke out of his mouth; and in his\nheart he was proud of his own capacity for enjoyment. He thought it\na fine thing, although at the same moment he knew it to be an evil\nthing--this hurrying away from the young lady whom he really loved\nto another as to whom he thought it very likely that he should be\ncalled upon to pretend to love her. And he sang a little song as he\nwent, \"If she be not fair for me, what care I how fair she be.\" That\nwas intended to apply to Lily, and was used as an excuse for his\nfickleness in going to Miss Demolines. And he was, perhaps, too, a\nlittle conceited as to his mission to the Continent. Lily had told\nhim that she was very glad that he was going; that she thought him\nvery right to go. The words had been pleasant to his ears, and Lily\nhad never looked prettier in his eyes than when she had spoken them.\nJohnny, therefore, was rather proud of himself as he sat in the cab\nsmoking his cigar. He had, moreover, beaten his old enemy Sir Raffle\nBuffle in another contest, and he felt that the world was smiling on\nhim;--that the world was smiling on him in spite of his cruel fate in\nthe matter of his real lovesuit.\n\nThere was a mystery about the Bayswater romance which was not without\nits allurement, and a portion of the mystery was connected with\nMadalina's mother. Lady Demolines was very rarely seen, and John\nEames could not quite understand what was the manner of life of that\nunfortunate lady. Her daughter usually spoke of her with affectionate\nregret as being unable to appear on that particular occasion on\naccount of some passing malady. She was suffering from a nervous\nheadache, or was afflicted with bronchitis, or had been touched with\nrheumatism, so that she was seldom on the scene when Johnny was\npassing his time at Porchester Terrace. And yet he heard of her\ndining out, and going to plays and operas; and when he did chance\nto see her, he found that she was a sprightly old woman enough. I\nwill not venture to say that he much regretted the absence of Lady\nDemolines, or that he was keenly alive to the impropriety of being\nleft alone with the gentle Madalina; but the customary absence of\nthe elder lady was an incident in the romance which did not fail to\nstrike him.\n\nMadalina was alone when he was shown up into the drawing-room on the\nevening of which we are speaking.\n\n\"Mr. Eames,\" she said, \"will you kindly look at that watch which is\nlying on the table.\" She looked full at him with her great eyes wide\nopen, and the tone of her voice was intended to show him that she was\naggrieved.\n\n\"Yes, I see it,\" said John, looking down on Miss Demolines' little\ngold Geneva watch, with which he had already made sufficient\nacquaintance to know that it was worth nothing. \"Shall I give it\nyou?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Eames; let it remain there, that it may remind me, if it\ndoes not remind you, by how long a time you have broken your word.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I couldn't help it;--upon my honour I couldn't.\"\n\n\"Upon your honour, Mr. Eames!\"\n\n\"I was obliged to go and see a friend who has just come to town from\nmy part of the country.\"\n\n\"That is the friend, I suppose, of whom I have heard from Maria.\"\nIt is to be feared that Conway Dalrymple had not been so guarded as\nhe should have been in some of his conversations with Mrs. Dobbs\nBroughton, and that a word or two had escaped from him as to the love\nof John Eames for Lily Dale.\n\n\"I don't know what you may have heard,\" said Johnny, \"but I was\nobliged to see these people before I left town. There is going to be\na marriage and all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Who is going to be married?\"\n\n\"One Captain Dale is going to be married to one Miss Dunstable.\"\n\n\"Oh! And as to one Miss Lily Dale,--is she to be married to anybody?\"\n\n\"Not that I have heard of,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"She is not going to become the wife of one Mr. John Eames?\"\n\nHe did not wish to talk to Miss Demolines about Lily Dale. He did not\nchoose to disown the imputation, or to acknowledge its truth.\n\n\"Silence gives consent,\" she said. \"If it be so, I congratulate you.\nI have no doubt she is a most charming young woman. It is about seven\nyears, I believe, since that little affair with Mr. Crosbie, and\ntherefore that, I suppose, may be considered as forgotten.\"\n\n\"It is only three years,\" said Johnny, angrily. \"Besides, I don't\nknow what that has to do with it.\"\n\n\"You need not be ashamed,\" said Madalina. \"I have heard how well you\nbehaved on that occasion. You were quite the preux chevalier; and\nif any gentleman ever deserved well of a lady you deserved well of\nher. I wonder how Mr. Crosbie felt when he met you the other day at\nMaria's. I had not heard anything about it then, or I should have\nbeen much more interested in watching your meeting.\"\n\n\"I really can't say how he felt.\"\n\n\"I daresay not; but I saw him shake hands with you. And so Lily Dale\nhas come to town?\"\n\n\"Yes,--Miss Dale is here with her uncle.\"\n\n\"And you are going away to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yes,--and I am going away to-morrow.\"\n\nAfter that there was a pause in the conversation. Eames was sick of\nit, and was very anxious to change the conversation. Miss Demolines\nwas sitting in the shadow, away from the light, with her face half\nhidden by her hands. At last she jumped up, and came round and stood\nopposite to him. \"I charge you to tell me truly, John Eames,\" she\nsaid, \"whether Miss Lilian Dale is engaged to you as your future\nwife?\" He looked up into her face, but made no immediate answer. Then\nshe repeated her demand. \"I ask you whether you are engaged to marry\nMiss Lilian Dale, and I expect a reply.\"\n\n\"What makes you ask me such a question as that?\"\n\n\"What makes me ask you? Do you deny my right to feel so much interest\nin you as to desire to know whether you are about to be married? Of\ncourse you can decline to tell me if you choose.\"\n\n\"And if I were to decline?\"\n\n\"I should know then that it was true, and I should think that you\nwere a coward.\"\n\n\"I don't see any cowardice in the matter. One does not talk about\nthat kind of thing to everybody.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Mr. Eames, you are complimentary;--indeed you are. To\neverybody! I am everybody,--am I? That is your idea of--friendship!\nYou may be sure that after that I shall ask no further questions.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean it in the way you've taken it, Madalina.\"\n\n\"In what way did you mean it, sir? Everybody! Mr. Eames, you must\nexcuse me if I say that I am not well enough this evening to bear the\ncompany of--everybody. I think you had better leave me. I think that\nyou had better go.\"\n\n\"Are you angry with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,--very angry. Because I have condescended to feel an\ninterest in your welfare, and have asked you a question which I\nthought that our intimacy justified, you tell me that that is a kind\nof thing that you will not talk about to--everybody. I beg you to\nunderstand that I will not be your everybody. Mr. Eames, there is the\ndoor.\"\n\nThings had now become very serious. Hitherto Johnny had been seated\ncomfortably in the corner of a sofa, and had not found himself bound\nto move, though Miss Demolines was standing before him. But now it\nwas absolutely necessary that he should do something. He must either\ngo, or else he must make entreaty to be allowed to remain. Would it\nnot be expedient that he should take the lady at her word and escape?\nShe was still pointing to the door, and the way was open to him. If\nhe were to walk out now of course he would never return, and there\nwould be the end of the Bayswater romance. If he remained it might\nbe that the romance would become troublesome. He got up from his\nseat, and had almost resolved that he would go. Had she not somewhat\nrelaxed the majesty of her anger as he rose, had the fire of her\neye not been somewhat quenched and the lines of her mouth softened,\nI think that he would have gone. The romance would have been over,\nand he would have felt that it had come to an inglorious end; but it\nwould have been well for him that he should have gone. Though the\nfire was somewhat quenched and the lines were somewhat softened, she\nwas still pointing to the door. \"Do you mean it?\" he said.\n\n\"I do mean it,--certainly.\"\n\n\"And this is to be the end of everything?\"\n\n\"I do not know what you mean by everything. It is a very little\neverything to you, I should say. I do not quite understand your\neverything and your everybody.\"\n\n\"I will go, if you wish me to go, of course.\"\n\n\"I do wish it.\"\n\n\"But before I go, you must permit me to excuse myself. I did not\nintend to offend you. I merely meant--\"\n\n\"You merely meant! Give me an honest answer to a downright question.\nAre you engaged to Miss Lilian Dale?\"\n\n\"No;--I am not.\"\n\n\"Upon your honour?\"\n\n\"Do you think that I would tell you a falsehood about it? What I\nmeant was that it is a kind of thing one doesn't like talking about,\nmerely because stories are bandied about. People are so fond of\nsaying that this man is engaged to that woman, and of making up\ntales; and it seems to be so foolish to contradict such things.\"\n\n\"But you know that you used to be very fond of her?\"\n\nHe had taken up his hat when he had risen from the sofa, and was\nstill standing with it ready in his hand. He was even now half-minded\nto escape; and the name of Lily Dale in Miss Demolines' mouth was so\ndistasteful to him that he would have done so,--he would have gone\nin sheer disgust, had she not stood in his way, so that he could not\nescape without moving her, or going round behind the sofa. She did\nnot stir to make way for him, and it may be that she understood that\nhe was her prisoner, in spite of her late command to him to go. It\nmay be, also, that she understood his vexation and the cause of it,\nand that she saw the expediency of leaving Lily Dale alone for the\npresent. At any rate, she pressed him no more upon the matter. \"Are\nwe to be friends again?\" she said.\n\n\"I hope so,\" replied Johnny.\n\n\"There is my hand, then.\" So Johnny took her hand and pressed it,\nand held it a little while,--just long enough to seem to give a\nmeaning to the action. \"You will get to understand me some day,\" she\nsaid, \"and will learn that I do not like to be reckoned among the\neverybodies by those for whom I really--really--really have a regard.\nWhen I am angry, I am angry.\"\n\n\"You were very angry just now, when you showed me the way to the\ndoor.\"\n\n\"And I meant it too,--for the minute. Only think,--supposing you had\ngone! We should never have seen each other again;--never, never! What\na change one word may make!\"\n\n\"One word often does make a change.\"\n\n\"Does it not? Just a little 'yes,' or 'no.' A 'no' is said when a\n'yes' is meant, and then there comes no second chance, and what a\nchange that may be from bright hopes to desolation! Or, worse again,\na 'yes' is said when a 'no' should be said,--when the speaker knows\nthat it should be 'no.' What a difference that 'no' makes! When one\nthinks of it, one wonders that a woman should ever say anything but\n'no.'\"\n\n\"They never did say anything else to me,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"I don't believe it. I daresay the truth is, you never asked\nanybody.\"\n\n\"Did anybody ever ask you?\"\n\n\"What would you give to know? But I will tell you frankly;--yes. And\nonce,--once I thought that my answer would not have been a 'no.'\"\n\n\"But you changed your mind?\"\n\n\"When the moment came I could not bring myself to say the word that\nshould rob me of my liberty for ever. I had said 'no' to him often\nenough before,--poor fellow; and on this occasion he told me that he\nasked for the last time. 'I shall not give myself another chance,'\nhe said, 'for I shall be on board ship within a week.' I merely bade\nhim good-by. It was the only answer I gave him. He understood me, and\nsince that day his foot has never pressed his native soil.\"\n\n\"And was it all because you are so fond of your liberty?\" said\nJohnny.\n\n\"Perhaps,--I did not--love him,\" said Miss Demolines, thoughtfully.\nShe was now again seated in her chair, and John Eames had gone back\nto his corner of the sofa. \"If I had really loved him I suppose it\nwould have been otherwise. He was a gallant fellow, and had two\nthousand a year of his own, in India stock and other securities.\"\n\n\"Dear me! And he has not married yet?\"\n\n\"He wrote me word to say that he would never marry till I was\nmarried,--but that on the day that he should hear of my wedding, he\nwould go to the first single woman near him and propose. It was a\ndroll thing to say; was it not?\"\n\n\"The single woman ought to feel herself flattered.\"\n\n\"He would find plenty to accept him. Besides being so well off he was\na very handsome fellow, and is connected with people of title. He had\neverything to recommend him.\"\n\n\"And yet you refused him so often?\"\n\n\"Yes. You think I was foolish;--do you not?\"\n\n\"I don't think you were at all foolish if you didn't care for him.\"\n\n\"It was my destiny, I suppose; I daresay I was wrong. Other girls\nmarry without violent love, and do very well afterwards. Look at\nMaria Clutterbuck.\"\n\nThe name of Maria Clutterbuck had become odious to John Eames. As\nlong as Miss Demolines would continue to talk about herself he could\nlisten with some amount of gratification. Conversation on that\nsubject was the natural progress of the Bayswater romance. And if\nMadalina would only call her friend by her present name, he had\nno strong objection to an occasional mention of the lady; but the\ncombined names of Maria Clutterbuck had come to be absolutely\ndistasteful to him. He did not believe in the Maria Clutterbuck\nfriendship,--either in its past or present existence, as described\nby Madalina. Indeed, he did not put strong faith in anything that\nMadalina said to him. In the handsome gentleman with two thousand\na year, he did not believe at all. But the handsome gentleman had\nonly been mentioned once in the course of his acquaintance with Miss\nDemolines, whereas Maria Clutterbuck had come up so often! \"Upon my\nword I must wish you good-by,\" he said. \"It is going on for eleven\no'clock, and I have to start to-morrow at seven.\"\n\n\"What difference does that make?\"\n\n\"A fellow wants to get a little sleep, you know.\"\n\n\"Go then;--go and get your sleep. What a sleepy-headed generation it\nis.\" Johnny longed to ask her whether the last generation was less\nsleepy-headed, and whether the gentleman with two thousand a year\nhad sat up talking all night before he pressed his foot for the last\ntime on his native soil; but he did not dare. As he said to himself\nafterwards, \"It would not do to bring the Bayswater romance too\nsuddenly to its termination!\" \"But before you go,\" she continued,\n\"I must say the word to you about that picture. Did you speak to Mr.\nDalrymple?\"\n\n\"I did not. I have been so busy with different things that I have not\nseen him.\"\n\n\"And now you are going?\"\n\n\"Well,--to tell the truth, I think I shall see him to-night, in spite\nof my being so sleepy-headed. I wrote him a line that I would look in\nand smoke a cigar with him if he chanced to be at home!\"\n\n\"And that is why you want to go. A gentleman cannot live without his\ncigar now.\"\n\n\"It is especially at your bidding that I am going to see him.\"\n\n\"Go, then,--and make your friend understand that if he continues this\npicture of his, he will bring himself to great trouble, and will\nprobably ruin the woman for whom he professes, I presume, to feel\nsomething like friendship. You may tell him that Mrs. Van Siever has\nalready heard of it.\"\n\n\"Who told her?\" demanded Johnny.\n\n\"Never mind. You need not look at me like that. It was not I. Do you\nsuppose that secrets can be kept when so many people know them? Every\nservant in Maria's house knows all about it.\"\n\n\"As for that, I don't suppose Mrs. Broughton makes any great secret\nof it.\"\n\n\"Do you think she has told Mr. Broughton? I am sure she has not. I\nmay say I know she has not. Maria Clutterbuck is infatuated. There is\nno other excuse to be made for her.\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" said Johnny, hurriedly.\n\n\"And you really are going?\"\n\n\"Well,--yes. I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Go then. I have nothing more to say to you.\"\n\n\"I shall come and call directly I return,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"You may do as you please about that, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you won't be glad to see me again?\"\n\n\"I am not going to flatter you, Mr. Eames. Mamma will be well by that\ntime, I hope, and I do not mind telling you that you are a favourite\nwith her.\" Johnny thought that this was particularly kind, as he had\nseen so very little of the old lady. \"If you choose to call upon\nher,\" said Madalina, \"of course she will be glad to see you.\"\n\n\"But I was speaking of yourself, you know?\" and Johnny permitted\nhimself for a moment to look tenderly at her.\n\n\"Then from myself pray understand that I will say nothing to flatter\nyour self-love.\"\n\n\"I thought you would be kinder just when I was going away.\"\n\n\"I think I have been quite kind enough. As you observed yourself just\nnow, it is nearly eleven o'clock, and I must ask you to go away. Bon\nvoyage, and a happy return to you.\"\n\n\"And you will be glad to see me when I am back? Tell me that you will\nbe glad to see me.\"\n\n\"I will tell you nothing of the kind. Mr. Eames, if you do, I will be\nvery angry with you.\" And then he went.\n\nOn his way back to his own lodgings he did call on Conway Dalrymple,\nand in spite of his need for early rising, sat smoking with the\nartist for an hour. \"If you don't take care, young man,\" said his\nfriend, \"you will find yourself in a scrape with your Madalina.\"\n\n\"What sort of a scrape?\"\n\n\"As you walk away from Porchester Terrace some fine day, you will\nhave to congratulate yourself on having made a successful overture\ntowards matrimony.\"\n\n\"You don't think I am such a fool as that comes to?\"\n\n\"Other men as wise as you have done the same sort of thing. Miss\nDemolines is very clever, and I daresay you find it amusing.\"\n\n\"It isn't so much that she's clever, and I can hardly say that it is\namusing. One gets awfully tired of it, you know. But a fellow must\nhave something to do, and that is as good as anything else.\"\n\n\"I suppose you have not heard that one young man levanted last year\nto save himself from a breach of promise case?\"\n\n\"I wonder whether he had any money in Indian securities?\"\n\n\"What makes you ask that?\"\n\n\"Nothing particular.\"\n\n\"Whatever little he had he chose to save, and I think I heard that he\nwent to Canada. His name was Shorter; and they say that, on the eve\nof his going, Madalina sent him word that she had no objection to the\ncolonies, and that, under the pressing emergency of his expatriation,\nshe was willing to become Mrs. Shorter with more expedition than\nusually attends fashionable weddings. Shorter, however, escaped, and\nhas never been seen back again.\"\n\nEames declared that he did not believe a word of it. Nevertheless, as\nhe walked home he came to the conclusion that Mr. Shorter must have\nbeen the handsome gentleman with Indian securities, to whom \"no\" had\nbeen said once too often.\n\nWhile sitting with Conway Dalrymple, he had forgotten to say a word\nabout Jael and Sisera.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nDR. TEMPEST AT THE PALACE.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIntimation had been sent from the palace to Dr. Tempest of\nSilverbridge of the bishop's intention that a commission should\nbe held by him, as rural dean, with other neighbouring clergymen,\nas assessors with him, that inquiry might be made on the part of\nthe Church into the question of Mr. Crawley's guilt. It must be\nunderstood that by this time the opinion had become very general that\nMr. Crawley had been guilty,--that he had found the cheque in his\nhouse, and that he had, after holding it for many months, succumbed\nto temptation, and applied it to his own purposes. But various\nexcuses were made for him by those who so believed. In the first\nplace it was felt by all who really knew anything of the man's\ncharacter, that the very fact of his committing such a crime proved\nhim to be hardly responsible for his actions. He must have known, had\nnot all judgment in such matters been taken from him, that the cheque\nwould certainly be traced back to his hands. No attempt had been made\nin the disposing of it to dispose of it in such a way that the trace\nshould be obliterated. He had simply given it to a neighbour with a\ndirection to have it cashed, and had written his own name on the back\nof it. And therefore, though there could be no doubt as to the theft\nin the mind of those who supposed that he had found the cheque in his\nown house, yet the guilt of the theft seemed to be almost annihilated\nby the folly of the thief. And then his poverty, and his struggles,\nand the sufferings of his wife, were remembered; and stories were\ntold from mouth to mouth of his industry in his profession, of\nhis great zeal among those brickmakers of Hoggle End, of acts of\ncharity done by him which startled the people of the district into\nadmiration;--how he had worked with his own hands for the sick poor\nto whom he could not give relief in money, turning a woman's mangle\nfor a couple of hours, and carrying a boy's load along the lanes. Dr.\nTempest and others declared that he had derogated from the dignity\nof his position as an English parish clergyman by such acts; but,\nnevertheless, the stories of these deeds acted strongly on the minds\nof both men and women, creating an admiration for Mr. Crawley which\nwas much stronger than the condemnation of his guilt.\n\nEven Mrs. Walker and her daughter, and the Miss Prettymans, had so\nfar given way that they had ceased to asseverate their belief in\nMr. Crawley's innocence. They contented themselves now with simply\nexpressing a hope that he would be acquitted by a jury, and that when\nhe should be so acquitted the thing might be allowed to rest. If he\nhad sinned, no doubt he had repented. And then there were serious\ndebates whether he might not have stolen the money without much sin,\nbeing mad or half-mad,--touched with madness when he took it; and\nwhether he might not, in spite of such temporary touch of madness,\nbe well fitted for his parish duties. Sorrow had afflicted him\ngrievously; but that sorrow, though it had incapacitated him for the\nmanagement of his own affairs, had not rendered him unfit for the\nministrations of his parish. Such were the arguments now used in\nhis favour by the women around him; and the men were not keen to\ncontradict them. The wish that he should be acquitted and allowed to\nremain in his parsonage was very general.\n\nWhen therefore it became known that the bishop had decided to put on\nfoot another investigation, with the view of bringing Mr. Crawley's\nconduct under ecclesiastical condemnation, almost everybody accused\nthe bishop of persecution. The world of the diocese declared that\nMrs. Proudie was at work, and that the bishop himself was no better\nthan a puppet. It was in vain that certain clear-headed men among the\nclergy, of whom Dr. Tempest himself was one, pointed out that the\nbishop after all might perhaps be right;--that if Mr. Crawley were\nguilty, and if he should be found to have been so by a jury, it might\nbe absolutely necessary that an ecclesiastical court should take some\ncognizance of the crime beyond that taken by the civil law. \"The\njury,\" said Dr. Tempest, discussing the case with Mr. Robarts and\nother clerical neighbours,--\"the jury may probably find him guilty\nand recommend him to mercy. The judge will have heard his character,\nand will have been made acquainted with his manner of life, and will\ndeal as lightly with the case as the law will allow him. For aught\nI know he may be imprisoned for a month. I wish it might be for\nno more than a day,--or an hour. But when he comes out from his\nmonth's imprisonment,--how then? Surely it should be a case for\necclesiastical inquiry, whether a clergyman who has committed a theft\nshould be allowed to go into his pulpit directly he comes out of\nprison?\" But the answer to this was that Mr. Crawley always had been\na good clergyman, was a good clergyman at this moment, and would be a\ngood clergyman when he did come out of prison.\n\nBut Dr. Tempest, though he had argued in this way, was by no means\neager for the commencement of the commission over which he was to\nbe called upon to preside. In spite of such arguments as the above,\nwhich came from the man's head when his head was brought to bear\nupon the matter, there was a thorough desire within his heart to\noppose the bishop. He had no strong sympathy with Mr. Crawley, as\nhad others. He would have had Mr. Crawley silenced without regret,\npresuming Mr. Crawley to have been guilty. But he had a much stronger\nfeeling with regard to the bishop. Had there been any question of\nsilencing the bishop,--could it have been possible to take any steps\nin that direction,--he would have been very active. It may therefore\nbe understood that in spite of his defence of the bishop's present\nproceedings as to the commission, he was anxious that the bishop\nshould fail, and anxious to put impediments in the bishop's way,\nshould it appear to him that he could do so with justice. Dr. Tempest\nwas well known among his parishioners to be hard and unsympathetic,\nsome said unfeeling also, and cruel; but it was admitted by those who\ndisliked him the most that he was both practical and just, and that\nhe cared for the welfare of many, though he was rarely touched by the\nmisery of one. Such was the man who was rector of Silverbridge and\nrural dean in the district, and who was now called upon by the bishop\nto assist him in making further inquiry as to this wretched cheque\nfor twenty pounds.\n\nOnce at this period Archdeacon Grantly and Dr. Tempest met each other\nand discussed the question of Mr. Crawley's guilt. Both these men\nwere inimical to the present bishop of the diocese, and both had\nperhaps respected the old bishop beyond all other men. But they\nwere different in this, that the archdeacon hated Dr. Proudie as\na partisan,--whereas Dr. Tempest opposed the bishop on certain\nprinciples which he endeavoured to make clear, at any rate to\nhimself. \"Wrong!\" said the archdeacon, speaking of the bishop's\nintention of issuing a commission--\"of course he is wrong. How could\nanything right come from him or from her? I should be sorry to have\nto do his bidding.\"\n\n\"I think you are a little hard upon Bishop Proudie,\" said Dr.\nTempest.\n\n\"One cannot be hard upon him,\" said the archdeacon. \"He is so\nscandalously weak, and she is so radically vicious, that they cannot\nbut be wrong together. The very fact that such a man should be a\nbishop among us is to me terribly strong evidence of evil days\ncoming.\"\n\n\"You are more impulsive than I am,\" said Dr. Tempest. \"In this case I\nam sorry for the poor man, who is, I am sure, honest in the main. But\nI believe that in such a case your father would have done just what\nthe present bishop is doing;--that he could have done nothing else;\nand as I think that Dr. Proudie is right I shall do all that I can to\nassist him in the commission.\"\n\nThe bishop's secretary had written to Dr. Tempest, telling him of\nthe bishop's purpose; and now, in one of the last days of March, the\nbishop himself wrote to Dr. Tempest, asking him to come over to the\npalace. The letter was worded most courteously, and expressed very\nfeelingly the great regret which the writer felt at being obliged to\ntake these proceedings against a clergyman in his diocese. Bishop\nProudie knew how to write such a letter. By the writing of such\nletters, and by the making of speeches in the same strain, he had\nbecome Bishop of Barchester. Now, in this letter, he begged Dr.\nTempest to come over to him, saying how delighted Mrs. Proudie would\nbe to see him at the palace. Then he went on to explain the great\ndifficulty which he felt, and great sorrow also, in dealing with\nthis matter of Mr. Crawley. He looked, therefore, confidently for Dr.\nTempest's assistance. Thinking to do the best for Mr. Crawley, and\nanxious to enable Mr. Crawley to remain in quiet retirement till the\ntrial should be over, he had sent a clergyman over to Hogglestock,\nwho would have relieved Mr. Crawley from the burden of the\nchurch-services;--but Mr. Crawley would have none of this relief.\nMr. Crawley had been obstinate and overbearing, and had persisted\nin claiming his right to his own pulpit. Therefore was the bishop\nobliged to interfere legally, and therefore was he under the\nnecessity of asking Dr. Tempest to assist him. Would Dr. Tempest come\nover on the Monday, and stay till the Wednesday?\n\nThe letter was a very good letter, and Dr. Tempest was obliged to do\nas he was asked. He so far modified the bishop's proposition that he\nreduced the sojourn at the palace by one night. He wrote to say that\nhe would have the pleasure of dining with the bishop and Mrs. Proudie\non the Monday, but would return home on the Tuesday, as soon as the\nbusiness in hand would permit him. \"I shall get on very well with\nhim,\" he said to his wife before he started; \"but I am afraid of the\nwoman. If she interferes, there will be a row.\" \"Then, my dear,\"\nsaid his wife, \"there will be a row, for I am told that she always\ninterferes.\" On reaching the palace about half-an-hour before\ndinner-time, Dr. Tempest found that other guests were expected, and\non descending to the great yellow drawing-room, which was used only\non state occasions, he encountered Mrs. Proudie and two of her\ndaughters arrayed in a full panoply of female armour. She received\nhim with her sweetest smiles, and if there had been any former enmity\nbetween Silverbridge and the palace, it was now all forgotten.\nShe regretted greatly that Mrs. Tempest had not accompanied the\ndoctor;--for Mrs. Tempest also had been invited. But Mrs. Tempest was\nnot quite as well as she might have been, the doctor had said, and\nvery rarely slept away from home. And then the bishop came in and\ngreeted his guest with his pleasantest good-humour. It was quite\na sorrow to him that Silverbridge was so distant, and that he saw\nso little of Dr. Tempest; but he hoped that that might be somewhat\nmended now, and that leisure might be found for social delights;--to\nall which Dr. Tempest said but little, bowing to the bishop at each\nseparate expression of his lordship's kindness.\n\nThere were guests there that evening who did not often sit at the\nbishop's table. The archdeacon and Mrs. Grantly had been summoned\nfrom Plumstead, and had obeyed the summons. Great as was the enmity\nbetween the bishop and the archdeacon, it had never quite taken the\nform of open palpable hostility. Each, therefore, asked the other to\ndinner perhaps once every year; and each went to the other, perhaps,\nonce in two years. And Dr. Thorne from Chaldicotes was there, but\nwithout his wife, who in these days was up in London. Mrs. Proudie\nalways expressed a warm friendship for Mrs. Thorne, and on this\noccasion loudly regretted her absence. \"You must tell her, Dr.\nThorne, how exceedingly much we miss her.\" Dr. Thorne, who was\naccustomed to hear his wife speak of her dear friend Mrs. Proudie\nwith almost unmeasured ridicule, promised that he would do so.\n\"We are so sorry the Luftons couldn't come to us,\" said Mrs.\nProudie,--not alluding to the dowager, of whom it was well known that\nno earthly inducement would have sufficed to make her put her foot\nwithin Mrs. Proudie's room;--\"but one of the children is ill, and she\ncould not leave him.\" But the Greshams were there from Boxall Hill,\nand the Thornes from Ullathorne, and, with the exception of a single\nchaplain, who pretended to carve, Dr. Tempest and the archdeacon\nwere the only clerical guests at the table. From all which Dr.\nTempest knew that the bishop was anxious to treat him with special\nconsideration on the present occasion.\n\nThe dinner was rather long and ponderous, and occasionally almost\ndull. The archdeacon talked a good deal, but a bystander with an\nacute ear might have understood from the tone of his voice that he\nwas not talking as he would have talked among friends. Mrs. Proudie\nfelt this, and understood it, and was angry. She could never find\nherself in the presence of the archdeacon without becoming angry.\nHer accurate ear would always appreciate the defiance of episcopal\nauthority, as now existing in Barchester, which was concealed, or\nonly half concealed, by all the archdeacon's words. But the bishop\nwas not so keen, nor so easily roused to wrath; and though the\npresence of his enemy did to a certain degree cow him, he strove to\nfight against the feeling with renewed good-humour.\n\n\"You have improved so upon the old days,\" said the archdeacon,\nspeaking of some small matter with reference to the cathedral, \"that\none hardly knows the old place.\"\n\n\"I hope we have not fallen off,\" said the bishop, with a smile.\n\n\"We have improved, Dr. Grantly,\" said Mrs. Proudie, with great\nemphasis on her words. \"What you say is true. We have improved.\"\n\n\"Not a doubt about that,\" said the archdeacon. Then Mrs. Grantly\ninterposed, strove to change the subject, and threw oil upon the\nwaters.\n\n\"Talking of improvements,\" said Mrs. Grantly, \"what an excellent row\nof houses they have built at the bottom of High Street. I wonder who\nis to live in them?\"\n\n\"I remember when that was the very worst part of the town,\" said Dr.\nThorne.\n\n\"And now they're asking seventy pounds apiece for houses which\ndid not cost above six hundred each to build,\" said Mr. Thorne of\nUllathorne, with that seeming dislike of modern success which is\nevinced by most of the elders of the world.\n\n\"And who is to live in them?\" asked Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"Two of them have been already taken by clergymen,\" said the bishop,\nin a tone of triumph.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the archdeacon, \"and the houses in the Close which used\nto be the residences of the prebendaries have been leased out to\ntallow-chandlers and retired brewers. That comes of the working of\nthe Ecclesiastical Commission.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" demanded Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"Why not, indeed, if you like to have tallow-chandlers next door to\nyou?\" said the archdeacon. \"In the old days, we would sooner have had\nour brethren near to us.\"\n\n\"There is nothing, Dr. Grantly, so objectionable in a cathedral town\nas a lot of idle clergymen,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"It is beginning to be a question to me,\" said the archdeacon,\n\"whether there is any use in clergymen at all for the present\ngeneration.\"\n\n\"Dr. Grantly, those cannot be your real sentiments,\" said Mrs.\nProudie. Then Mrs. Grantly, working hard in her vocation as a\npeacemaker, changed the conversation again, and began to talk of the\nAmerican war. But even that was made matter of discord on church\nmatters,--the archdeacon professing an opinion that the Southerners\nwere Christian gentlemen, and the Northerners infidel snobs; whereas\nMrs. Proudie had an idea that the Gospel was preached with genuine\nzeal in the Northern States. And at each such outbreak the poor\nbishop would laugh uneasily, and say a word or two to which no\none paid much attention. And so the dinner went on, not always in\nthe most pleasant manner for those who preferred continued social\ngood-humour to the occasional excitement of a half-suppressed battle.\n\nNot a word was said about Mr. Crawley. When Mrs. Proudie and the\nladies had left the dining-room, the bishop strove to get up a little\nlay conversation. He spoke to Mr. Thorne about his game, and to Dr.\nThorne about his timber, and even to Mr. Gresham about his hounds.\n\"It is not so very many years, Mr. Gresham,\" said he, \"since the\nBishop of Barchester was expected to keep hounds himself,\" and the\nbishop laughed at his own joke.\n\n\"Your lordship shall have them back at the palace next season,\" said\nyoung Frank Gresham, \"if you will promise to do the county justice.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed the bishop. \"What do you say, Mr. Tozer?\" Mr.\nTozer was the chaplain on duty.\n\n\"I have not the least objection in the world, my lord,\" said Mr.\nTozer, \"to act as second whip.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you'll find them an expensive adjunct to the episcopate,\"\nsaid the archdeacon. And then the joke was over; for there had been\na rumour, now for some years prevalent in Barchester, that Bishop\nProudie was not liberal in his expenditure. As Mr. Thorne said\nafterwards to his cousin the doctor, the archdeacon might have spared\nthat sneer. \"The archdeacon will never spare the man who sits in his\nfather's seat,\" said the doctor. \"The pity of it is that men who\nare so thoroughly different in all their sympathies should ever be\nbrought into contact.\" \"Dear, dear,\" said the archdeacon, as he stood\nafterwards on the rug before the drawing-room fire, \"how many rubbers\nof whist I have seen played in this room.\" \"I sincerely hope that you\nwill never see another played here,\" said Mrs. Proudie. \"I'm quite\nsure that I shall not,\" said the archdeacon. For this last sally his\nwife scolded him bitterly on their way home. \"You know very well,\"\nshe said, \"that the times are changed, and that if you were Bishop of\nBarchester yourself you would not have whist played in the palace.\"\n\"I only know,\" said he, \"that when we had the whist we had some true\nreligion along with it, and some good sense and good feeling also.\"\n\"You cannot be right to sneer at others for doing what you would do\nyourself,\" said his wife. Then the archdeacon threw himself sulkily\ninto the corner of his carriage, and nothing more was said between\nhim and his wife about the bishop's dinner-party.\n\nNot a word was spoken that night at the palace about Mr. Crawley;\nand when that obnoxious guest from Plumstead was gone, Mrs. Proudie\nresumed her good-humour towards Dr. Tempest. So intent was she on\nconciliating him that she refrained even from abusing the archdeacon,\nwhom she knew to have been intimate for very many years with the\nrector of Silverbridge. In her accustomed moods she would have broken\nforth in loud anger, caring nothing for old friendships; but at\npresent she was thoughtful of the morrow, and desirous that Dr.\nTempest should, if possible, meet her in a friendly humour when the\ngreat discussion as to Hogglestock should be opened between them. But\nDr. Tempest understood her bearing, and as he pulled on his nightcap\nmade certain resolutions of his own as to the morrow's proceedings.\n\"I don't suppose she will dare to interfere,\" he had said to his\nwife; \"but if she does, I shall certainly tell the bishop that I\ncannot speak on the subject in her presence.\"\n\nAt breakfast on the following morning there was no one present but\nthe bishop, Mrs. Proudie, and Dr. Tempest. Very little was said at\nthe meal. Mr. Crawley's name was not mentioned, but there seemed to\nbe a general feeling among them that there was a task hanging over\nthem which prevented any general conversation. The eggs were eaten\nand the coffee was drunk, but the eggs and the coffee disappeared\nalmost in silence. When these ceremonies had been altogether\ncompleted, and it was clearly necessary that something further should\nbe done, the bishop spoke: \"Dr. Tempest,\" he said, \"perhaps you will\njoin me in my study at eleven. We can then say a few words to each\nother about the unfortunate matter on which I shall have to trouble\nyou.\" Dr. Tempest said he would be punctual to his appointment, and\nthen the bishop withdrew, muttering something as to the necessity\nof looking at his letters. Dr. Tempest took a newspaper in his hand,\nwhich had been brought in by a servant, but Mrs. Proudie did not\nallow him to read it. \"Dr. Tempest,\" she said, \"this is a matter of\nmost vital importance. I am quite sure that you feel that it is so.\"\n\n\"What matter, madam?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"This terrible affair of Mr. Crawley's. If something be not done the\nwhole diocese will be disgraced.\" Then she waited for an answer, but\nreceiving none she was obliged to continue. \"Of the poor man's guilt\nthere can, I fear, be no doubt.\" Then there was another pause, but\nstill the doctor made no answer. \"And if he be guilty,\" said Mrs.\nProudie, resolving that she would ask a question that must bring\nforth some reply, \"can any experienced clergyman think that he can be\nfit to preach from the pulpit of a parish church? I am sure that you\nmust agree with me, Dr. Tempest? Consider the souls of the people!\"\n\n\"Mrs. Proudie,\" said he, \"I think that we had better not discuss the\nmatter.\"\n\n\"Not discuss it?\"\n\n\"I think that we had better not do so. If I understand the bishop\naright, he wishes that I should take some step in the matter.\"\n\n\"Of course he does.\"\n\n\"And therefore I must decline to make it a matter of common\nconversation.\"\n\n\"Common conversation, Dr. Tempest! I should be the last person in the\nworld to make it a matter of common conversation. I regard this as by\nno means a common conversation. God forbid that it should be a common\nconversation. I am speaking now very seriously with reference to the\ninterests of the Church, which I think will be endangered by having\namong her active servants a man who has been guilty of so base a\ncrime as theft. Think of it, Dr. Tempest. Theft! Stealing money!\nAppropriating to his own use a cheque for twenty pounds which did\nnot belong to him! And then telling such terrible falsehoods about\nit! Can anything be worse, anything more scandalous, anything more\ndangerous? Indeed, Dr. Tempest, I do not regard this as any common\nconversation.\" The whole of this speech was not made at once,\nfluently, or without a break. From stop to stop Mrs. Proudie paused,\nwaiting for her companion's words; but as he would not speak she was\nobliged to continue. \"I am sure that you cannot but agree with me,\nDr. Tempest?\" she said.\n\n\"I am quite sure that I shall not discuss it with you,\" said the\ndoctor, very brusquely.\n\n\"And why not? Are you not here to discuss it?\"\n\n\"Not with you, Mrs. Proudie. You must excuse me for saying so, but I\nam not here to discuss any such matter with you. Were I to do so, I\nshould be guilty of a very great impropriety.\"\n\n\"All these things are in common between me and the bishop,\" said Mrs.\nProudie, with an air that was intended to be dignified, but which\nnevertheless displayed her rising anger.\n\n\"As to that I know nothing, but they cannot be in common between you\nand me. It grieves me much that I should have to speak to you in\nsuch a strain, but my duty allows me no alternative. I think, if you\nwill permit me, I will take a turn round the garden before I keep my\nappointment with his lordship.\" And so saying he escaped from the\nlady without hearing her further remonstrance.\n\nIt still wanted nearly an hour to the time named by the bishop, and\nDr. Tempest used it in preparing for his withdrawal from the palace\nas soon as his interview with the bishop should be over. After what\nhad passed he thought that he would be justified in taking his\ndeparture without bidding adieu formally to Mrs. Proudie. He would\nsay a word or two, explaining his haste, to the bishop; and then,\nif he could get out of the house at once, it might be that he would\nnever see Mrs. Proudie again. He was rather proud of his success\nin their late battle, but he felt that, having been so completely\nvictorious, it would be foolish in him to risk his laurels in the\nchance of another encounter. He would say not a word of what had\nhappened to the bishop, and he thought it probable that neither\nwould Mrs. Proudie speak of it,--at any rate till after he was gone.\nGenerals who are beaten out of the field are not quick to talk of\ntheir own repulses. He, indeed, had not beaten Mrs. Proudie out of\nthe field. He had, in fact, himself run away. But he had left his\nfoe silenced; and with such a foe, and in such a contest, that was\neverything. He put up his portmanteau, therefore, and prepared for\nhis final retreat. Then he rang his bell and desired the servant\nto show him to the bishop's study. The servant did so, and when he\nentered the room the first thing he saw was Mrs. Proudie sitting\nin an arm-chair near the window. The bishop was also in the room,\nsitting with his arms upon the writing-table, and his head upon his\nhands. It was very evident that Mrs. Proudie did not consider herself\nto have been beaten, and that she was prepared to fight another\nbattle. \"Will you sit down, Dr. Tempest?\" she said, motioning him\nwith her hand to a chair opposite to that occupied by the bishop. Dr.\nTempest sat down. He felt that at the moment he had nothing else to\ndo, and that he must restrain any remonstrance that he might make\ntill Mr. Crawley's name should be mentioned. He was almost lost in\nadmiration of the woman. He had left her, as he thought, utterly\nvanquished and prostrated by his determined but uncourteous usage\nof her; and here she was, present again upon the field of battle as\nthough she had never been even wounded. He could see that there had\nbeen words between her and the bishop, and that she had carried a\npoint on which the bishop had been very anxious to have his own way.\nHe could perceive at once that the bishop had begged her to absent\nherself and was greatly chagrined that he should not have prevailed\nwith her. There she was,--and as Dr. Tempest was resolved that he\nwould neither give advice nor receive instructions respecting Mr.\nCrawley in her presence, he could only draw upon his courage and\nhis strategy for the coming warfare. For a few moments no one said\na word. The bishop felt that if Dr. Tempest would only begin, the\nwork on hand might be got through, even in his wife's presence. Mrs.\nProudie was aware that her husband should begin. If he would do so,\nand if Dr. Tempest would listen and then reply, she might gradually\nmake her way into the conversation; and if her words were once\naccepted then she could say all that she desired to say; then she\ncould play her part and become somebody in the episcopal work. When\nonce she should have been allowed liberty of speech, the enemy would\nbe powerless to stop her. But all this Dr. Tempest understood quite\nas well as she understood it, and had they waited till night he would\nnot have been the first to mention Mr. Crawley's name.\n\nThe bishop sighed aloud. The sigh might be taken as expressing grief\nover the sin of the erring brother whose conduct they were then to\ndiscuss, and was not amiss. But when the sigh with its attendant\nmurmurs had passed away it was necessary that some initiative step\nshould be taken. \"Dr. Tempest,\" said the bishop, \"what are we to do\nabout this poor stiff-necked gentleman?\" Still Dr. Tempest did not\nspeak. \"There is no clergyman in the diocese,\" continued the bishop,\n\"in whose prudence and wisdom I have more confidence than in yours.\nAnd I know, too, that you are by no means disposed to severity where\nsevere measures are not necessary. What ought we to do? If he has\nbeen guilty, he should not surely return to his pulpit after the\nexpiration of such punishment as the law of his country may award to\nhim.\"\n\nDr. Tempest looked at Mrs. Proudie, thinking that she might perhaps\nsay a word now; but Mrs. Proudie knew her part better and was silent.\nAngry as she was, she contrived to hold her peace. Let the debate\nonce begin and she would be able to creep into it, and then to lead\nit,--and so she would hold her own. But she had met a foe as wary\nas herself. \"My lord,\" said the doctor, \"it will perhaps be well\nthat you should communicate your wishes to me in writing. If it be\npossible for me to comply with them I will do so.\"\n\n\"Yes;--exactly; no doubt;--but I thought that perhaps we might better\nunderstand each other if we had a few words of quiet conversation\nupon the subject. I believe you know the steps that I have--\"\n\nBut here the bishop was interrupted. Dr. Tempest rose from his chair,\nand advancing to the table put both his hands upon it. \"My lord,\" he\nsaid, \"I feel myself compelled to say that which I would very much\nrather leave unsaid, were it possible. I feel the difficulty, and\nI may say delicacy, of my position; but I should be untrue to my\nconscience and to my feeling of what is right in such matters, if I\nwere to take any part in a discussion on this matter in the presence\nof--a lady.\"\n\n\"Dr. Tempest, what is your objection?\" said Mrs. Proudie, rising from\nher chair, and coming also to the table, so that from thence she\nmight confront her opponent; and as she stood opposite to Dr. Tempest\nshe also put both her hands upon the table.\n\n\"My dear, perhaps you will leave us for a few moments,\" said the\nbishop. Poor bishop! Poor weak bishop! As the words came from his\nmouth he knew that they would be spoken in vain, and that, if so, it\nwould have been better for him to have left them unspoken.\n\n\"Why should I be dismissed from your room without a reason?\" said\nMrs. Proudie. \"Cannot Dr. Tempest understand that a wife may share\nher husband's counsels,--as she must share his troubles? If he\ncannot, I pity him very much as to his own household.\"\n\n\"Dr. Tempest,\" said the bishop, \"Mrs. Proudie takes the greatest\npossible interest in everything concerning the diocese.\"\n\n\"I am sure, my lord,\" said the doctor, \"that you will see how\nunseemly it would be that I should interfere in any way between you\nand Mrs. Proudie. I certainly will not do so. I can only say again\nthat if you will communicate to me your wishes in writing, I will\nattend to them,--if it be possible.\"\n\n\"You mean to be stubborn,\" said Mrs. Proudie, whose prudence was\nbeginning to give way under the great provocation to which her temper\nwas being subjected.\n\n\"Yes, madam; if it is to be called stubbornness, I must be\nstubborn. My lord, Mrs. Proudie spoke to me on this subject in the\nbreakfast-room after you had left it, and I then ventured to explain\nto her that in accordance with such light as I have on the matter, I\ncould not discuss it in her presence. I greatly grieve that I failed\nto make myself understood by her,--as, otherwise, this unpleasantness\nmight have been spared.\"\n\n\"I understood you very well, Dr. Tempest, and I think you to be a\nmost unreasonable man. Indeed, I might use a much harsher word.\"\n\n\"You may use any word you please, Mrs. Proudie,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"My dear, I really think you had better leave us for a few minutes,\"\nsaid the bishop.\n\n\"No, my lord,--no,\" said Mrs. Proudie, turning round upon her\nhusband. \"Not so. It would be most unbecoming that I should be turned\nout of a room in this palace by an uncourteous word from a parish\nclergyman. It would be unseemly. If Dr. Tempest forgets his duty,\nI will not forget mine. There are other clergymen in the diocese\nbesides Dr. Tempest who can undertake the very easy task of this\ncommission. As for his having been appointed rural dean I don't know\nhow many years ago, it is a matter of no consequence whatever. In\nsuch a preliminary inquiry any three clergymen will suffice. It need\nnot be done by the rural dean at all.\"\n\n\"My dear!\"\n\n\"I will not be turned out of this room by Dr. Tempest;--and that is\nenough.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" said the doctor, \"you had better write to me as I proposed\nto you just now.\"\n\n\"His lordship will not write. His lordship will do nothing of the\nkind,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"My dear!\" said the bishop, driven in his perplexity beyond all\ncarefulness of reticence. \"My dear, I do wish you wouldn't,--I do\nindeed. If you would only go away!\"\n\n\"I will not go away, my lord,\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"But I will,\" said Dr. Tempest, feeling true compassion for the\nunfortunate man whom he saw writhing in agony before him. \"It will\nmanifestly be for the best that I should retire. My lord, I wish you\ngood morning. Mrs. Proudie, good morning.\" And so he left the room.\n\n\"A most stubborn and a most ungentlemanlike man,\" said Mrs. Proudie,\nas soon as the door was closed behind the retreating rural dean.\n\"I do not think that in the whole course of my life I ever met with\nany one so insubordinate and so ill-mannered. He is worse than the\narchdeacon.\" As she uttered these words she paced about the room. The\nbishop said nothing; and when she herself had been silent for a few\nminutes she turned upon him. \"Bishop,\" she said, \"I hope that you\nagree with me. I expect that you will agree with me in a matter that\nis of so much moment to my comfort, and I may say to my position\ngenerally in the diocese. Bishop, why do you not speak?\"\n\n\"You have behaved in such a way that I do not know that I shall ever\nspeak again,\" said the bishop.\n\n\"What is this that you say?\"\n\n\"I say that I do not know how I shall ever speak again. You have\ndisgraced me.\"\n\n\"Disgraced you! I disgrace you! It is you that disgrace yourself by\nsaying such words.\"\n\n\"Very well. Let it be so. Perhaps you will go away now and leave me\nto myself. I have got a bad headache, and I can't talk any more. Oh\ndear, oh dear, what will he think of it!\"\n\n\"And you mean to tell me that I have been wrong!\"\n\n\"Yes, you have been wrong,--very wrong. Why didn't you go away when\nI asked you? You are always being wrong. I wish I had never come to\nBarchester. In any other position I should not have felt it so much.\nAs it is I do not know how I can ever show my face again.\"\n\n\"Not have felt what so much, Mr. Proudie?\" said the wife, going back\nin the excitement of her anger to the nomenclature of old days. \"And\nthis is to be my return for all my care in your behalf! Allow me to\ntell you, sir, that in any position in which you may be placed I know\nwhat is due to you, and that your dignity will never lose anything\nin my hands. I wish that you were as well able to take care of it\nyourself.\" Then she stalked out of the room, and left the poor man\nalone.\n\nBishop Proudie sat alone in his study throughout the whole day. Once\nor twice in the course of the morning his chaplain came to him on\nsome matter of business, and was answered with a smile,--the peculiar\nsoftness of which the chaplain did not fail to attribute to the right\ncause. For it was soon known throughout the household that there had\nbeen a quarrel. Could he quite have made up his mind to do so,--could\nhe have resolved that it would be altogether better to quarrel with\nhis wife,--the bishop would have appealed to the chaplain, and have\nasked at any rate for sympathy. But even yet he could not bring\nhimself to confess his misery, and to own himself to another to be\nthe wretch that he was. Then during the long hours of the day he sat\nthinking of it all. How happy could he be if it were only possible\nfor him to go away, and become even a curate in a parish, without his\nwife! Would there ever come to him a time of freedom? Would she ever\ndie? He was older than she, and of course he would die first. Would\nit not be a fine thing if he could die at once, and thus escape from\nhis misery?\n\nWhat could he do, even supposing himself strong enough to fight the\nbattle? He could not lock her up. He could not even very well lock\nher out of his room. She was his wife, and must have the run of\nhis house. He could not altogether debar her from the society of\nthe diocesan clergymen. He had, on this very morning, taken strong\nmeasures with her. More than once or twice he had desired her to\nleave the room. What was there to be done with a woman who would not\nobey her husband,--who would not even leave him to the performance of\nhis own work? What a blessed thing it would be if a bishop could go\naway from his home to his work every day like a clerk in a public\noffice,--as a stone-mason does! But there was no such escape for him.\nHe could not go away. And how was he to meet her again on this very\nday?\n\nAnd then for hours he thought of Dr. Tempest and Mr. Crawley,\nconsidering what he had better do to repair the shipwreck of the\nmorning. At last he resolved that he would write to the doctor; and\nbefore he had again seen his wife, he did write his letter, and\nhe sent it off. In this letter he made no direct allusion to the\noccurrence of the morning, but wrote as though there had not been any\nfixed intention of a personal discussion between them. \"I think it\nwill be better that there should be a commission,\" he said, \"and I\nwould suggest that you should have four other clergymen with you.\nPerhaps you will select two yourself out of your rural deanery; and,\nif you do not object, I will name as the other two Mr. Thumble and\nMr. Quiverful, who are both resident in the city.\" As he wrote these\ntwo names he felt ashamed of himself, knowing that he had chosen\nthe two men as being special friends of his wife, and feeling that\nhe should have been brave enough to throw aside all considerations\nof his wife's favour,--especially at this moment, in which he was\nputting on his armour to do battle against her. \"It is not probable,\"\nhe continued to say in his letter, \"that you will be able to make\nyour report until after the trial of this unfortunate gentleman shall\nhave taken place, and a verdict shall have been given. Should he be\nacquitted, that, I imagine, should end the matter. There can be no\nreason why we should attempt to go beyond the verdict of a jury.\nBut should he be found guilty, I think we ought to be ready with\nsuch steps as it will be becoming for us to take at the expiration\nof any sentence which may be pronounced. It will be, at any rate,\nexpedient that in such case the matter should be brought before an\necclesiastical court.\" He knew well as he wrote this, that he was\nproposing something much milder than the course intended by his wife\nwhen she had instigated him to take proceedings in the matter; but\nhe did not much regard that now. Though he had been weak enough to\nname certain clergymen as assessors with the rural dean, because he\nthought that by doing so he would to a certain degree conciliate his\nwife,--though he had been so far a coward, yet he was resolved that\nhe would not sacrifice to her his own judgment and his own conscience\nin his manner of proceeding. He kept no copy of his letter, so that\nhe might be unable to show her his very words when she should ask\nto see them. Of course he would tell her what he had done; but in\ntelling her he would keep to himself what he had said as to the\nresult of an acquittal in a civil court. She need not yet be told\nthat he had promised to take such a verdict as sufficing also for an\necclesiastical acquittal. In this spirit his letter was written and\nsent off before he again saw his wife.\n\nHe did not meet her till they came together in the drawing-room\nbefore dinner. In explaining the whole truth as to circumstances as\nthey existed at the palace at that moment, it must be acknowledged\nthat Mrs. Proudie herself, great as was her courage, and wide as\nwere the resources which she possessed within herself, was somewhat\nappalled by the position of affairs. I fear that it may now be too\nlate for me to excite much sympathy in the mind of any reader on\nbehalf of Mrs. Proudie. I shall never be able to make her virtues\npopular. But she had virtues, and their existence now made her\nunhappy. She did regard the dignity of her husband, and she felt at\nthe present moment that she had almost compromised it. She did also\nregard the welfare of the clergymen around her, thinking of course\nin a general way that certain of them who agreed with her were the\nclergymen whose welfare should be studied, and that certain of them\nwho disagreed with her were the clergymen whose welfare should be\npostponed. But now an idea made its way into her bosom that she was\nnot perhaps doing the best for the welfare of the diocese generally.\nWhat if it should come to pass that all the clergymen of the diocese\nshould refuse to open their mouths in her presence on ecclesiastical\nsubjects, as Dr. Tempest had done? This special day was not one on\nwhich she was well contented with herself, though by no means on that\naccount was her anger mitigated against the offending rural dean.\n\nDuring dinner she struggled to say a word or two to her husband, as\nthough there had been no quarrel between them. With him the matter\nhad gone so deep that he could not answer her in the same spirit.\nThere were sundry members of the family present,--daughters, and a\nson-in-law, and a daughter's friend who was staying with them; but\neven in the hope of appearing to be serene before them he could not\nstruggle through his deep despondence. He was very silent, and to his\nwife's words he answered hardly anything. He was courteous and gentle\nwith them all, but he spoke as little as was possible, and during\nthe evening he sat alone, with his head leaning on his hand,--not\npretending even to read. He was aware that it was too late to make\neven an attempt to conceal his misery and his disgrace from his own\nfamily.\n\nHis wife came to him that night in his dressing-room in a spirit of\nfeminine softness that was very unusual with her. \"My dear,\" said\nshe, \"let us forget what occurred this morning. If there has been any\nanger we are bound as Christians to forget it.\" She stood over him as\nshe spoke, and put her hand upon his shoulder almost caressingly.\n\n\"When a man's heart is broken, he cannot forget it,\" was his reply.\nShe still stood by him, and still kept her hand upon him; but she\ncould think of no other words of comfort to say. \"I will go to bed,\"\nhe said. \"It is the best place for me.\" Then she left him, and he\nwent to bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nTHE SOFTNESS OF SIR RAFFLE BUFFLE.\n\n\nWe have seen that John Eames was prepared to start on his journey in\nsearch of the Arabins, and have seen him after he had taken farewell\nof his office and of his master there, previous to his departure; but\nthat matter of his departure had not been arranged altogether with\ncomfort as far as his official interests were concerned. He had been\nperhaps a little abrupt in his mode of informing Sir Raffle Buffle\nthat there was a pressing cause for his official absence, and Sir\nRaffle had replied to him that no private pressure could be allowed\nto interfere with his public duties. \"I must go, Sir Raffle, at any\nrate,\" Johnny had said; \"it is a matter affecting my family, and must\nnot be neglected.\" \"If you intend to go without leave,\" said Sir\nRaffle, \"I presume you will first put your resignation into the hands\nof Mr. Kissing.\" Now, Mr. Kissing was the secretary to the Board.\nThis had been serious undoubtedly. John Eames was not specially\nanxious to keep his present position as private secretary to Sir\nRaffle, but he certainly had no desire to give up his profession\naltogether. He said nothing more to the great man on that occasion,\nbut before he left the office he wrote a private note to the chairman\nexpressing the extreme importance of his business, and begging that\nhe might have leave of absence. On the next morning he received it\nback with a very few words written across it. \"It can't be done,\"\nwere the very few words which Sir Raffle Buffle had written across\nthe note from his private secretary. Here was a difficulty which\nJohnny had not anticipated, and which seemed to be insuperable. Sir\nRaffle would not have answered him in that strain if he had not been\nvery much in earnest.\n\n\"I should send him a medical certificate,\" said Cradell, his friend\nof old.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Eames.\n\n\"I don't see that it's nonsense at all. They can't get over a medical\ncertificate from a respectable man; and everybody has got something\nthe matter with him of some kind.\"\n\n\"I should go and let him do his worst,\" said Fisher, who was another\nclerk. \"It wouldn't be more than putting you down a place or two.\nAs to losing your present berth you don't mind that, and they would\nnever think of dismissing you.\"\n\n\"But I do mind being put down a place or two,\" said Johnny, who could\nnot forget that were he so put down his friend Fisher would gain the\nstep which he would lose.\n\n\"I should give him a barrel of oysters, and talk to him about the\nChancellor of the Exchequer,\" said FitzHoward, who had been private\nsecretary to Sir Raffle before Eames, and might therefore be supposed\nto know the man.\n\n\"That might have done very well if I had not asked him and been\nrefused first,\" said John Eames. \"I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll\nwrite a long letter on a sheet of foolscap paper, with a regular\nmargin, so that it must come before the Board, and perhaps that will\nfrighten him.\"\n\nWhen he mentioned his difficulty on that evening to Mr. Toogood, the\nlawyer begged him to give up the journey. \"It will only be sending a\nclerk, and it won't cost so very much after all,\" said Toogood. But\nJohnny's pride could not allow him to give way. \"I'm not going to be\ndone about it,\" said he. \"I'm not going to resign, but I will go even\nthough they may dismiss me. I don't think it will come to that, but\nif it does it must.\" His uncle begged of him not to think of such\nan alternative; but this discussion took place after dinner, and\naway from the office, and Eames would not submit to bow his neck to\nauthority. \"If it comes to that,\" said he, \"a fellow might as well\nbe a slave at once. And what is the use of a fellow having a little\nmoney if it does not make him independent? You may be sure of one\nthing, I shall go; and that on the day fixed.\"\n\nOn the next morning John Eames was very silent when he went into Sir\nRaffle's room at the office. There was now only this day and another\nbefore that fixed for his departure, and it was of course very\nnecessary that matters should be arranged. But he said nothing to Sir\nRaffle during the morning. The great man himself was condescending\nand endeavoured to be kind. He knew that his stern refusal had\ngreatly irritated his private secretary, and was anxious to show\nthat, though in the cause of public duty he was obliged to be stern,\nhe was quite willing to forget his sternness when the necessity for\nit had passed away. On this morning, therefore, he was very cheery.\nBut to all his cheery good-humour John Eames would make no response.\nLate in the afternoon, when most of the men had left the office,\nJohnny appeared before the chairman for the last time that day with a\nvery long face. He was dressed in black, and had changed his ordinary\nmorning coat for a frock, which gave him an appearance altogether\nunlike that which was customary to him. And he spoke almost in a\nwhisper, very slowly; and when Sir Raffle joked,--and Sir Raffle\noften would joke,--he not only did not laugh, but he absolutely\nsighed. \"Is there anything the matter with you, Eames?\" asked Sir\nRaffle.\n\n\"I am in great trouble,\" said John Eames.\n\n\"And what is your trouble?\"\n\n\"It is essential for the honour of one of my family that I should be\nat Florence by this day week. I cannot make up my mind what I ought\nto do. I do not wish to lose my position in the public service, to\nwhich, as you know, I am warmly attached; but I cannot submit to see\nthe honour of my family sacrificed!\"\n\n\"Eames,\" said Sir Raffle, \"that must be nonsense;--that must be\nnonsense. There can be no reason why you should always expect to have\nyour own way in everything.\"\n\n\"Of course if I go without leave I shall be dismissed.\"\n\n\"Of course you will. It is out of the question that a young man\nshould take the bit between his teeth in that way.\"\n\n\"As for taking the bit between his teeth, Sir Raffle, I do not\nthink that any man was ever more obedient, perhaps I should say\nmore submissive, than I have been. But there must be a limit to\neverything.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, Mr. Eames?\" said Sir Raffle, turning in\nanger upon his private secretary. But Johnny disregarded his anger.\nJohnny, indeed, had made up his mind that Sir Raffle should be very\nangry. \"What do you mean, Mr. Eames, by saying that there must be\na limit? I know nothing about limits. One would suppose that you\nintended to make an accusation against me.\"\n\n\"So I do. I think, Sir Raffle, that you are treating me with great\ncruelty. I have explained to you that family circumstances--\"\n\n\"You have explained nothing, Mr. Eames.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, Sir Raffle. I have explained to you that matters\nrelating to my family, which materially affect the honour of a\ncertain one of its members, demand that I should go at once to\nFlorence. You tell me that if I go I shall be dismissed.\"\n\n\"Of course you must not go without leave. I never heard of such a\nthing in all my life.\" And Sir Raffle lifted up his hands towards\nheaven, almost in dismay.\n\n\"So I have drawn up a short statement of the circumstances, which I\nhope may be read at the Board when the question of my dismissal comes\nbefore it.\"\n\n\"You mean to go, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Raffle; I must go. The honour of a certain branch of my\nfamily demands that I should do so. As I have for some time been so\nespecially under you, I thought it would be proper to show you what\nI have said before I send my letter in, and therefore I have brought\nit with me. Here it is.\" And Johnny handed to Sir Raffle an official\ndocument of large dimensions.\n\nSir Raffle began to be uncomfortable. He had acquired a character\nfor tyranny in the public service of which he was aware, though\nhe thought that he knew well that he had never deserved it. Some\nofficial big-wig,--perhaps that Chancellor of the Exchequer of whom\nhe was so fond,--had on one occasion hinted to him that a little\nsoftness of usage would be compatible with the prejudices of the\nage. Softness was impossible to Sir Raffle; but his temper was\nsufficiently under his control to enable him to encounter the rebuke,\nand to pull himself up from time to time when he found himself\ntempted to speak loud and to take things with a high hand. He knew\nthat a clerk should not be dismissed for leaving his office, who\ncould show that his absence had been caused by some matter really\naffecting the interest of his family; and that were he to drive Eames\nto go on this occasion without leave, Eames would be simply called\nin to state what was this matter of moment which had taken him away.\nProbably he had stated that matter of moment in this very document\nwhich Sir Raffle was holding in his hand. But Sir Raffle was not\nwilling to be conquered by the document. If it was necessary that he\nshould give way, he would much prefer to give way,--out of his own\ngood-nature, let us say,--without looking at the document at all.\n\"I must, under the circumstances, decline to read this,\" said he,\n\"unless it should come before me officially,\" and he handed back the\npaper.\n\n\"I thought it best to let you see it if you pleased,\" said John\nEames. Then he turned round as though he were going to leave the\nroom; but suddenly he turned back again. \"I don't like to leave you,\nSir Raffle, without saying good-by. I do not suppose we shall meet\nagain. Of course you must do your duty, and I do not wish you to\nthink that I have any personal ill-will against you.\" So saying, he\nput out his hand to Sir Raffle as though to take a final farewell.\nSir Raffle looked at him in amazement. He was dressed, as has been\nsaid, in black, and did not look like the John Eames of every day to\nwhom Sir Raffle was accustomed.\n\n\"I don't understand this at all,\" said Sir Raffle.\n\n\"I was afraid that it was only too plain,\" said John Eames.\n\n\"And you must go?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes;--that's certain. I have pledged myself to go.\"\n\n\"Of course I don't know anything of this matter that is so important\nto your family.\"\n\n\"No; you do not,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Can't you explain it to me, then? so that I may have some\nreason,--if there is any reason.\"\n\nThen John told the story of Mr. Crawley,--a considerable portion of\nthe story; and in his telling of it, I think it probable that he\nput more weight upon the necessity of his mission to Italy than it\ncould have fairly been made to bear. In the course of the narration\nSir Raffle did once contrive to suggest that a lawyer by going to\nFlorence might do the business at any rate as well as John Eames.\nBut Johnny denied this. \"No, Sir Raffle, it is impossible; quite\nimpossible,\" he said. \"If you saw the lawyer who is acting in the\nmatter, Mr. Toogood, who is also my uncle, he would tell you the\nsame.\" Sir Raffle had already heard something of the story of Mr.\nCrawley, and was now willing to accept the sad tragedy of that case\nas an excuse for his private secretary's somewhat insubordinate\nconduct. \"Under the circumstances, Eames, I suppose you must go; but\nI think you should have told me all about it before.\"\n\n\"I did not like to trouble you, Sir Raffle, with private business.\"\n\n\"It is always best to tell the whole of a story,\" said Sir Raffle.\nJohnny being quite content with the upshot of the negotiations\naccepted this gentle rebuke in silence, and withdrew. On the next day\nhe appeared again at the office in his ordinary costume, and an idea\ncrossed Sir Raffle's brain that he had been partly \"done\" by the\naffectation of a costume. \"I'll be even with him some day yet,\" said\nSir Raffle to himself.\n\n\"I've got my leave, boys,\" said Eames when he went out into the room\nin which his three friends sat.\n\n\"No!\" said Cradell.\n\n\"But I have,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"You don't mean that old Huffle Scuffle has given it out of his own\nhead?\" said Fisher.\n\n\"Indeed he has,\" said Johnny; \"and bade God bless me into the\nbargain.\"\n\n\"And you didn't give him the oysters?\" said FitzHoward. \"Not a\nshell,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"I'm blessed if you don't beat cock-fighting,\" said Cradell, lost in\nadmiration at his friend's adroitness.\n\nWe know how John passed his evening after that. He went first to see\nLily Dale at her uncle's lodgings in Sackville Street, from thence\nhe was taken to the presence of the charming Madalina in Porchester\nTerrace, and then wound up the night with his friend Conway\nDalrymple. When he got to his bed he felt himself to have been\ntriumphant, but in spite of his triumph he was ashamed of himself.\nWhy had he left Lily to go to Madalina? As he thought of this he\nquoted to himself against himself Hamlet's often-quoted appeal to the\ntwo portraits. How could he not despise himself in that he could find\nany pleasure with Madalina, having a Lily Dale to fill his thoughts?\n\"But she is not fair for me,\" he said to himself,--thinking thus to\ncomfort himself. But he did not comfort himself.\n\nOn the next morning early his uncle, Mr. Toogood, met him at the\nDover Railway Station. \"Upon my word, Johnny, you're a clever\nfellow,\" said he. \"I never thought that you'd make it all right with\nSir Raffle.\"\n\n\"As right as a trivet, uncle. There are some people, if you can only\nget to learn the length of their feet, you can always fit them with\nshoes afterwards.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"As right as a trivet, Uncle.\"]\n\n\"You'll go on direct to Florence, Johnny?\"\n\n\"Yes; I think so. From what we have heard, Mrs. Arabin must be either\nthere or at Venice, and I don't suppose I could learn from any one at\nParis at which town she is staying at this moment.\"\n\n\"Her address is Florence;--poste restante, Florence. You will be sure\nto find out at any of the hotels where she is staying, or where she\nhas been staying.\"\n\n\"But when I have found her, I don't suppose she can tell me\nanything,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Who can tell? She may or she may not. My belief is that the money\nwas her present altogether, and not his. It seems that they don't mix\ntheir moneys. He has always had some scruple about it because of her\nson by a former marriage, and they always have different accounts at\ntheir bankers'. I found that out when I was at Barchester.\"\n\n\"But Crawley was his friend.\"\n\n\"Yes, Crawley was his friend; but I don't know that fifty-pound notes\nhave always been so very plentiful with him. Deans' incomes ain't\nwhat they were, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about that,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Well; they are not. And he has nothing of his own, as far as I can\nlearn. It would be just the thing for her to do,--to give the money\nto his friend. At any rate she will tell you whether it was so or\nnot.\"\n\n\"And then I will go on to Jerusalem, after him.\"\n\n\"Should you find it necessary. He will probably be on his way back,\nand she will know where you can hit him on the road. You must make\nhim understand that it is essential that he should be here some\nlittle time before the trial. You can understand, Johnny,\"--and as he\nspoke Mr. Toogood lowered his voice to a whisper, though they were\nwalking together on the platform of the railway station, and could\nnot possibly have been overheard by any one. \"You can understand that\nit may be necessary to prove that he is not exactly compos mentis,\nand if so it will be essential that he should have some influential\nfriend near him. Otherwise that bishop will trample him into dust.\"\nIf Mr. Toogood could have seen the bishop at this time and have read\nthe troubles of the poor man's heart, he would hardly have spoken of\nhim as being so terrible a tyrant.\n\n\"I understand all that,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"So that, in fact, I shall expect to see you both together,\" said\nToogood.\n\n\"I hope the dean is a good fellow.\"\n\n\"They tell me he is a very good fellow.\"\n\n\"I never did see much of bishops or deans as yet,\" said Johnny, \"and\nI should feel rather awe-struck travelling with one.\"\n\n\"I should fancy that a dean is very much like anybody else.\"\n\n\"But the man's hat would cow me.\"\n\n\"I daresay you'll find him walking about Jerusalem with a wide-awake\non, and a big stick in his hand, probably smoking a cigar. Deans\ncontrive to get out of their armour sometimes, as the knights of old\nused to do. Bishops, I fancy, find it more difficult. Well;--good-by,\nold fellow. I'm very much obliged to you for going,--I am, indeed. I\ndon't doubt but what we shall pull through, somehow.\"\n\nThen Mr. Toogood went home to breakfast, and from his own house he\nproceeded to his office. When he had been there an hour or two, there\ncame to him a messenger from the Income-tax Office, with an official\nnote addressed to himself by Sir Raffle Buffle,--a note which looked\nto be very official. Sir Raffle Buffle presented his compliments to\nMr. Toogood, and could Mr. Toogood favour Sir R. B. with the present\naddress of Mr. John Eames. \"Old fox,\" said Mr. Toogood;--\"but then\nsuch a stupid old fox! As if it was likely that I should have peached\non Johnny if anything was wrong.\" So Mr. Toogood sent his compliments\nto Sir Raffle Buffle, and begged to inform Sir R. B. that Mr. John\nEames was away on very particular family business, which would take\nhim in the first instance to Florence;--but that from Florence he\nwould probably have to go on to Jerusalem without the loss of an\nhour. \"Stupid old fool!\" said Mr. Toogood, as he sent off his reply\nby the messenger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nNEAR THE CLOSE.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nI wonder whether any one will read these pages who has never known\nanything of the bitterness of a family quarrel? If so, I shall have a\nreader very fortunate, or else very cold-blooded. It would be wrong\nto say that love produces quarrels; but love does produce those\nintimate relations of which quarrelling is too often one of the\nconsequences,--one of the consequences which frequently seem to be so\nnatural, and sometimes seem to be unavoidable. One brother rebukes\nthe other,--and what brothers ever lived together between whom there\nwas no such rebuking?--then some warm word is misunderstood and\nhotter words follow and there is a quarrel. The husband tyrannizes,\nknowing that it is his duty to direct, and the wife disobeys, or only\npartially obeys, thinking that a little independence will become\nher,--and so there is a quarrel. The father, anxious only for his\nson's good, looks into that son's future with other eyes than those\nof his son himself,--and so there is a quarrel. They come very\neasily, these quarrels, but the quittance from them is sometimes\nterribly difficult. Much of thought is necessary before the angry man\ncan remember that he too in part may have been wrong; and any attempt\nat such thinking is almost beyond the power of him who is carefully\nnursing his wrath, lest it cool! But the nursing of such quarrelling\nkills all happiness. The very man who is nursing his wrath, lest it\ncool,--his wrath against one whom he loves perhaps the best of all\nwhom it has been given him to love,--is himself wretched as long as\nit lasts. His anger poisons every pleasure of his life. He is sullen\nat his meals, and cannot understand his book as he turns its pages.\nHis work, let it be what it may, is ill done. He is full of his\nquarrel,--nursing it. He is telling himself how much he has loved\nthat wicked one, how many have been his sacrifices for that wicked\none, and that now that wicked one is repaying him simply with\nwickedness! And yet the wicked one is at that very moment dearer to\nhim than ever. If that wicked one could only be forgiven how sweet\nwould the world be again! And yet he nurses his wrath.\n\nSo it was in these days with Archdeacon Grantly. He was very angry\nwith his son. It is hardly too much to say that in every moment of\nhis life, whether waking or sleeping, he was thinking of the injury\nthat his son was doing him. He had almost come to forget the fact\nthat his anger had first been roused by the feeling that his son was\nabout to do himself an injury,--to cut his own throat. Various other\nconsiderations had now added themselves to that, and filled not only\nhis mind but his daily conversation with his wife. How terrible\nwould be the disgrace to Lord Hartletop, how incurable the injury to\nGriselda, the marchioness, should the brother-in-law of the one, and\nthe brother of the other, marry the daughter of a convicted thief!\n\"Of himself he would say nothing.\" So he declared constantly, though\nof himself he did say a great deal. \"Of himself he would say nothing,\nthough of course such a marriage would ruin him in the county.\" \"My\ndear,\" said his wife, \"that is nonsense. That really is nonsense. I\nfeel sure there is not a single person in the county who would think\nof the marriage in such a light.\" Then the archdeacon would have\nquarrelled with his wife too, had she not been too wise to admit\nsuch a quarrel. Mrs. Grantly was very wise and knew that it took two\npersons to make a quarrel. He told her over and over again that she\nwas in league with her son,--that she was encouraging her son to\nmarry Grace Crawley. \"I believe that in your heart you wish it,\" he\nonce said to her. \"No, my dear, I do not wish it. I do not think it a\nbecoming marriage. But if he does marry her, I should wish to receive\nhis wife in my house, and certainly should not quarrel with him.\" \"I\nwill never receive her,\" the archdeacon had replied; \"and as for him,\nI can only say that in such case I will make no provision for his\nfamily.\"\n\nIt will be remembered that the archdeacon had on a former occasion\ninstructed his wife to write to their son and tell him of his\nfather's determination. Mrs. Grantly had so manoeuvred that a little\ntime had been gained, and that those instructions had not been\ninsisted upon in all their bitterness. Since that time Major Grantly\nhad renewed his assurance that he would marry Grace Crawley if Grace\nCrawley would accept him,--writing on this occasion direct to his\nfather,--and had asked his father whether, in such case, he was to\nlook forward to be disinherited. \"It is essential that I should\nknow,\" the major had said, \"because in such case I must take\nimmediate measures for leaving this place.\" His father had sent him\nback his letter, writing a few words at the bottom of it. \"If you do\nas you propose above, you must expect nothing from me.\" The words\nwere written in large round handwriting, very hurriedly, and the son\nwhen he received them perfectly understood the mood of his father's\nmind when he wrote them.\n\nThen there came tidings, addressed on this occasion to Mrs. Grantly,\nthat Cosby Lodge was to be given up. Lady-day had come, and the\nnotice, necessarily to be given at that period, was so given. \"I know\nthis will grieve you,\" Major Grantly had said, \"but my father has\ndriven me to it.\" This, in itself, was a cause of great sorrow, both\nto the archdeacon and to Mrs. Grantly, as there were circumstances\nconnected with Cosby Lodge which made them think that it was a very\ndesirable residence for their son. \"I shall sell everything about the\nplace and go abroad at once,\" he said in a subsequent letter. \"My\npresent idea is that I shall settle myself at Pau, as my income will\nsuffice for me to live there, and education for Edith will be cheap.\nAt any rate I will not continue in England. I could never be happy\nhere in circumstances so altered. Of course I should not have left my\nprofession, unless I had understood from my father that the income\narising from it would not be necessary to me. I do not, however, mean\nto complain, but simply tell you that I shall go.\" There were many\nletters between the mother and son in those days. \"I shall stay till\nafter the trial,\" he said. \"If she will then go with me, well and\ngood; but whether she will or not, I shall not remain here.\" All this\nseemed to Mrs. Grantly to be peculiarly unfortunate, for, had he not\nresolved to go, things might even yet have righted themselves. From\nwhat she could now understand of the character of Miss Crawley, whom\nshe did not know personally, she thought it probable that Grace,\nin the event of her father being found guilty by the jury, would\nabsolutely and persistently refuse the offer made to her. She would\nbe too good, as Mrs. Grantly put it to herself, to bring misery and\ndisgrace into another family. But should Mr. Crawley be acquitted,\nand should the marriage then take place, the archdeacon himself might\nprobably be got to forgive it. In either case there would be no\nnecessity for breaking up the house at Cosby Lodge. But her dear son\nHenry, her best beloved, was obstinate and stiff-necked, and would\ntake no advice. \"He is even worse than his father,\" she said, in her\nshort-lived anger, to her own father, to whom alone at this time she\ncould unburden her griefs, seeking consolation and encouragement.\n\nIt was her habit to go over to the deanery at any rate twice a week\nat this time, and on the occasion of one of the visits so made, she\nexpressed very strongly her distress at the family quarrel which had\ncome among them. The old man took his grandson's part through and\nthrough. \"I do not at all see why he should not marry the young lady\nif he likes her. As for money, there ought to be enough without his\nhaving to look for a wife with a fortune.\"\n\n\"It is not a question of money, papa.\"\n\n\"And as to rank,\" continued Mr. Harding, \"Henry will not at any rate\nbe going lower than his father did when he married you;--not so low\nindeed, for at that time I was only a minor canon, and Mr. Crawley is\nin possession of a benefice.\"\n\n\"Papa, all that is nonsense. It is, indeed.\"\n\n\"Very likely, my dear.\"\n\n\"It is not because Mr. Crawley is only perpetual curate of\nHogglestock, that the archdeacon objects to the marriage. It has\nnothing to do with that at all. At the present moment he is in\ndisgrace.\"\n\n\"Under a cloud, my dear. Let us pray that it may be only a passing\ncloud.\"\n\n\"All the world thinks that he was guilty. And then he is such a\nman:--so singular, so unlike anybody else! You know, papa, that I\ndon't think very much of money, merely as money.\"\n\n\"I hope not, my dear. Money is worth thinking of, but it is not worth\nvery much thought.\"\n\n\"But it does give advantages, and the absence of such advantages must\nbe very much felt in the education of a girl. You would hardly wish\nHenry to marry a young woman who, from want of money, had not been\nbrought up among ladies. It is not Miss Crawley's fault, but such has\nbeen her lot. We cannot ignore these deficiencies, papa.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, my dear.\"\n\n\"You would not, for instance, wish that Henry should marry a\nkitchen-maid.\"\n\n\"But is Miss Crawley a kitchen-maid, Susan?\"\n\n\"I don't quite say that.\"\n\n\"I am told that she has been educated infinitely better than most of\nthe young ladies in the neighbourhood,\" said Mr. Harding.\n\n\"I believe that her father has taught her Greek; and I suppose she\nhas learned something of French at that school at Silverbridge.\"\n\n\"Then the kitchen-maid theory is sufficiently disposed of,\" said Mr.\nHarding, with mild triumph.\n\n\"You know what I mean, papa. But the fact is, that it is impossible\nto deal with men. They will never be reasonable. A marriage such as\nthis would be injurious to Henry; but it will not be ruinous; and as\nto disinheriting him for it, that would be downright wicked.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" said Mr. Harding.\n\n\"But the archdeacon will look at it as though it would destroy Henry\nand Edith altogether, while you speak of it as though it were the\nbest thing in the world.\"\n\n\"If the young people love each other, I think it would be the best\nthing in the world,\" said Mr. Harding.\n\n\"But, papa, you cannot but think that his father's wish should go for\nsomething,\" said Mrs. Grantly, who, desirous as she was on the one\nside to support her son, could not bear that her husband should, on\nthe other side, be declared to be altogether in the wrong.\n\n\"I do not know, my dear,\" said Mr. Harding; \"but I do think, that if\nthe two young people are fond of each other, and if there is anything\nfor them to live upon, it cannot be right to keep them apart. You\nknow, my dear, she is the daughter of a gentleman.\" Mrs. Grantly upon\nthis left her father almost brusquely, without speaking another word\non the subject; for, though she was opposed to the vehement anger of\nher husband, she could not endure the proposition now made by her\nfather.\n\nMr. Harding was at this time living all alone in the deanery. For\nsome few years the deanery had been his home, and as his youngest\ndaughter was the dean's wife, there could be no more comfortable\nresting-place for the evening of his life. During the last month or\ntwo the days had gone tediously with him; for he had had the large\nhouse all to himself, and he was a man who did not love solitude.\nIt is hard to conceive that the old, whose thoughts have been all\nthought out, should ever love to live alone. Solitude is surely for\nthe young, who have time before them for the execution of schemes,\nand who can, therefore, take delight in thinking. In these days the\npoor old man would wander about the rooms, shambling from one chamber\nto another, and would feel ashamed when the servants met him ever on\nthe move. He would make little apologies for his uneasiness, which\nthey would accept graciously, understanding, after a fashion, why\nit was that he was uneasy. \"He ain't got nothing to do,\" said the\nhousemaid to the cook, \"and as for reading, they say that some of\nthe young ones can read all day sometimes, and all night too; but,\nbless you, when you're nigh eighty, reading don't go for much.\" The\nhousemaid was right as to Mr. Harding's reading. He was not one who\nhad read so much in his earlier days as to enable him to make reading\ngo far with him now that he was near eighty. So he wandered about the\nroom, and sat here for a few minutes, and there for a few minutes,\nand though he did not sleep much, he made the hours of the night\nas many as was possible. Every morning he shambled across from the\ndeanery to the cathedral, and attended the morning service, sitting\nin the stall which he had occupied for fifty years. The distance was\nvery short, not exceeding, indeed, a hundred yards from a side-door\nin the deanery to another side-door into the cathedral; but short as\nit was there had come to be a question whether he should be allowed\nto go alone. It had been feared that he might fall on his passage and\nhurt himself; for there was a step here, and a step there, and the\nlight was not very good in the purlieus of the old cathedral. A word\nor two had been said once, and the offer of an arm to help him had\nbeen made; but he had rejected the proffered assistance,--softly,\nindeed, but still firmly,--and every day he tottered off by himself,\nhardly lifting his feet as he went, and aiding himself on his journey\nby a hand upon the wall when he thought that nobody was looking at\nhim. But many did see him, and they who knew him,--ladies generally\nof the city,--would offer him a hand. Nobody was milder in his\ndislikings than Mr. Harding; but there were ladies in Barchester upon\nwhose arm he would always decline to lean, bowing courteously as he\ndid so, and saying a word or two of constrained civility. There were\nothers whom he would allow to accompany him home to the door of the\ndeanery, with whom he delighted to linger and chat if the morning was\nwarm, and to whom he would tell little stories of his own doings in\nthe cathedral services in the old days, when Bishop Grantly had ruled\nin the diocese. Never a word did he say against Bishop Proudie, or\nagainst Bishop Proudie's wife; but the many words which he did say in\npraise of Bishop Grantly,--who, by his showing, was surely one of the\nbest of churchmen who ever walked through this vale of sorrow,--were\nas eloquent in dispraise of the existing prelate as could have been\nany more clearly-pointed phrases. This daily visit to the cathedral,\nwhere he would say his prayers as he had said them for so many years,\nand listen to the organ, of which he knew all the power and every\nblemish as though he himself had made the stops and fixed the pipes,\nwas the chief occupation of his life. It was a pity that it could not\nhave been made to cover a larger portion of the day.\n\nIt was sometimes sad enough to watch him as he sat alone. He would\nhave a book near him, and for a while would keep it in his hands. It\nwould generally be some volume of good old standard theology with\nwhich he had been, or supposed himself to have been, conversant from\nhis youth. But the book would soon be laid aside, and gradually he\nwould move himself away from it, and he would stand about in the\nroom, looking now out of a window from which he would fancy that he\ncould not be seen, or gazing up at some print which he had known for\nyears; and then he would sit down for a while in one chair, and for\na while in another, while his mind was wandering back into old days,\nthinking of old troubles and remembering his old joys. And he had a\nhabit, when he was sure that he was not watched, of creeping up to\na great black wooden case, which always stood in one corner of the\nsitting-room which he occupied in the deanery. Mr. Harding, when he\nwas younger, had been a performer on the violoncello, and in this\ncase there was still the instrument from which he had been wont to\nextract the sounds which he had so dearly loved. Now in these latter\ndays he never made any attempt to play. Soon after he had come to\nthe deanery there had fallen upon him an illness, and after that he\nhad never again asked for his bow. They who were around him,--his\ndaughter chiefly and her husband,--had given the matter much thought,\narguing with themselves whether or no it would be better to invite\nhim to resume the task he had so loved; for of all the works of his\nlife this playing on the violoncello had been the sweetest to him;\nbut even before that illness his hand had greatly failed him, and the\ndean and Mrs. Arabin had agreed that it would be better to let the\nmatter pass without a word. He had never asked to be allowed to play.\nHe had expressed no regrets. When he himself would propose that his\ndaughter should \"give them a little music,\"--and he would make such a\nproposition on every evening that was suitable,--he would never say\na word of those former performances at which he himself had taken a\npart. But it had become known to Mrs. Arabin, through the servants,\nthat he had once dragged the instrument forth from its case when he\nhad thought the house to be nearly deserted; and a wail of sounds had\nbeen heard, very low, very short-lived, recurring now and again at\nfitful intervals. He had at those times attempted to play, as though\nwith a muffled bow,--so that none should know of his vanity and\nfolly. Then there had been further consultations at the deanery, and\nit had been again agreed that it would be best to say nothing to him\nof his music.\n\nIn these latter days of which I am now speaking he would never draw\nthe instrument out of its case. Indeed he was aware that it was too\nheavy for him to handle without assistance. But he would open the\nprison door, and gaze upon the thing that he loved, and he would\npass his fingers among the broad strings, and ever and anon he would\nproduce from one of them a low, melancholy, almost unearthly sound.\nAnd then he would pause, never daring to produce two such notes in\nsuccession,--one close upon the other. And these last sad moans of\nthe old fiddle were now known through the household. They were the\nghosts of the melody of days long past. He imagined that his visits\nto the box were unsuspected,--that none knew of the folly of his old\nfingers which could not keep themselves from touching the wires; but\nthe voice of the violoncello had been recognized by the servants\nand by his daughter, and when that low wail was heard through the\nhouse,--like the last dying note of a dirge,--they would all know\nthat Mr. Harding was visiting his ancient friend.\n\nWhen the dean and Mrs. Arabin had first talked of going abroad for a\nlong visit, it had been understood that Mr. Harding should pass the\nperiod of their absence with his other daughter at Plumstead; but\nwhen the time came he begged of Mrs. Arabin to be allowed to remain\nin his old rooms. \"Of course I shall go backwards and forwards,\" he\nhad said. \"There is nothing I like so much as a change now and then.\"\nThe result had been that he had gone once to Plumstead during the\ndean's absence. When he had thus remonstrated, begging to be allowed\nto remain in Barchester, Mrs. Arabin had declared her intention of\ngiving up her tour. In telling her father of this she had not said\nthat her altered purpose had arisen from her disinclination to\nleave him alone;--but he had perceived that it was so, and had then\nconsented to be taken over to Plumstead. There was nothing, he said,\nwhich he would like so much as going over to Plumstead for four or\nfive months. It had ended in his having his own way altogether. The\nArabins had gone upon their tour, and he was left in possession of\nthe deanery. \"I should not like to die out of Barchester,\" he said to\nhimself in excuse to himself for his disinclination to sojourn long\nunder the archdeacon's roof. But, in truth, the archdeacon, who loved\nhim well and who, after a fashion, had always been good to him,--who\nhad always spoken of the connexion which had bound the two families\ntogether as the great blessing of his life,--was too rough in his\ngreetings for the old man. Mr. Harding had ever mixed something of\nfear with his warm affection for his elder son-in-law, and now in\nthese closing hours of his life he could not avoid a certain amount\nof shrinking from that loud voice,--a certain inaptitude to be quite\nat ease in that commanding presence. The dean, his second son-in-law,\nhad been a modern friend in comparison with the archdeacon; but the\ndean was more gentle with him; and then the dean's wife had ever been\nthe dearest to him of human beings. It may be a doubt whether one\nof the dean's children was not now almost more dear, and whether in\nthese days he did not have more free communication with that little\ngirl than with any other human being. Her name was Susan, but he\nhad always called her Posy, having himself invented for her that\nsoubriquet. When it had been proposed to him to pass the winter and\nspring at Plumstead, the suggestion had been made alluring by a\npromise that Posy also should be taken to Mrs. Grantly's house.\nBut he, as we have seen, had remained at the deanery, and Posy had\nremained with him.\n\nPosy was now five years old, and could talk well, and had her own\nideas of things. Posy's eyes,--hers, and no others besides her\nown,--were allowed to see the inhabitant of the big black case; and\nnow that the deanery was so nearly deserted, Posy's fingers had\ntouched the strings, and had produced an infantine moan. \"Grandpa,\nlet me do it again.\" Twang! It was not, however, in truth, a twang,\nbut a sound as of a prolonged dull, almost deadly, hum-m-m-m-m! On\nthis occasion the moan was not entirely infantine,--Posy's fingers\nhaving been something too strong,--and the case was closed and\nlocked, and grandpapa shook his head.\n\n\"But Mrs. Baxter won't be angry,\" said Posy. Mrs. Baxter was the\nhousekeeper in the deanery, and had Mr. Harding under her especial\ncharge.\n\n\"No, my darling; Mrs. Baxter will not be angry, but we mustn't\ndisturb the house.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Posy, with much of important awe in her tone; \"we\nmustn't disturb the house; must we, grandpapa?\" And so she gave\nin her adhesion to the closing of the case. But Posy could play\ncat's-cradle, and as cat's-cradle did not disturb the house at all,\nthere was a good deal of cat's-cradle played in these days. Posy's\nfingers were so soft and pretty, so small and deft, that the dear old\nman delighted in taking the strings from them, and in having them\ntaken from his own by those tender little digits.\n\n[Illustration: Posy and her Grandpapa.]\n\nOn the afternoon after the conversation respecting Grace Crawley\nwhich is recorded in the early part of this chapter, a messenger\nfrom Barchester went over to Plumstead, and a part of his mission\nconsisted of a note from Mrs. Baxter to Mrs. Grantly, beginning,\n\"Honoured Madam,\" and informing Mrs. Grantly, among other things,\nthat her \"respected papa,\" as Mrs. Baxter called him, was not quite\nso well as usual; not that Mrs. Baxter thought there was much the\nmatter. Mr. Harding had been to the cathedral service, as was usual\nwith him, but had come home leaning on a lady's arm, who had thought\nit well to stay with him at the door till it had been opened for him.\nAfter that \"Miss Posy\" had found him asleep, and had been unable,--or\nif not unable, unwilling, to wake him. \"Miss Posy\" had come down to\nMrs. Baxter somewhat in a fright, and hence this letter had been\nwritten. Mrs. Baxter thought that there was nothing \"to fright\" Mrs.\nGrantly, and she wasn't sure that she should have written at all only\nthat Dick was bound to go over to Plumstead with the wool; but as\nDick was going, Mrs. Baxter thought it proper to send her duty, and\nto say that to her humble way of thinking perhaps it might be best\nthat Mr. Harding shouldn't go alone to the cathedral every morning.\n\"If the dear reverend gentleman was to get a tumble, ma'am,\" said the\nletter, \"it would be awkward.\" Then Mrs. Grantly remembered that she\nhad left her father almost without a greeting on the previous day,\nand she resolved that she would go over very early on the following\nmorning,--so early that she would be at the deanery before her father\nshould have gone to the cathedral.\n\n\"He ought to have come over here, and not stayed there by himself,\"\nsaid the archdeacon, when his wife told him of her intention.\n\n\"It is too late to think of that now, my dear; and one can\nunderstand, I think, that he should not like leaving the cathedral as\nlong as he can attend it. The truth is he does not like being out of\nBarchester.\"\n\n\"He would be much better here,\" said the archdeacon. \"Of course you\ncan have the carriage and go over. We can breakfast at eight; and if\nyou can bring him back with you, do. I should tell him that he ought\nto come.\" Mrs. Grantly made no answer to this, knowing very well that\nshe could not bring herself to go beyond the gentlest persuasion with\nher father, and on the next morning she was at the deanery by ten\no'clock. Half-past ten was the hour at which the service began. Mrs.\nBaxter contrived to meet her before she saw her father, and begged\nher not to let it be known that any special tidings of Mr. Harding's\nfailing strength had been sent from the deanery to Plumstead. \"And\nhow is my father?\" asked Mrs. Grantly. \"Well, then, ma'am,\" said\nBaxter, \"in one sense he's finely. He took a morsel of early lamb\nto his dinner yesterday, and relished it ever so well,--only he\ngave Miss Posy the best part of it. And then he sat with Miss Posy\nquite happy for an hour or so. And then he slept in his chair; and\nyou know, ma'am, we never wakes him. And after that old Skulpit\ntoddled up from the hospital,\"--this was Hiram's Hospital, of which\nestablishment, in the city of Barchester, Mr. Harding had once been\nthe warden and kind master, as has been told in former chronicles\nof the city,--\"and your papa has said, ma'am, you know, that he is\nalways to see any of the old men when they come up. And Skulpit is\nsly, and no better than he should be, and got money from your father,\nma'am, I know. And then he had just a drop of tea, and after that I\ntook him his glass of port wine with my own hands. And it touched me,\nma'am, so it did, when he said, 'Oh, Mrs. Baxter, how good you are;\nyou know well what it is I like.' And then he went to bed. I listened\nhard,--not from idle cur'osity, ma'am, as you, who know me, will\nbelieve, but just because it's becoming to know what he's about, as\nthere might be an accident, you know, ma'am.\" \"You are very good,\nMrs. Baxter, very good.\" \"Thank ye, ma'am, for saying so. And so I\nlistened hard; but he didn't go to his music, poor gentleman; and\nI think he had a quiet night. He doesn't sleep much at nights, poor\ngentleman, but he's very quiet; leastwise he was last night.\" This\nwas the bulletin which Mrs. Baxter gave to Mrs. Grantly on that\nmorning before Mrs. Grantly saw her father.\n\nShe found him preparing himself for his visit to the cathedral. Some\nyear or two,--but no more,--before the date of which we are speaking,\nhe had still taken some small part in the service; and while he had\ndone so he had of course worn his surplice. Living so close to the\ncathedral,--so close that he could almost walk out of the house into\nthe transept,--he had kept his surplice in his own room, and had gone\ndown in his vestment. It had been a bitter day to him when he had\nfirst found himself constrained to abandon the white garment which\nhe loved. He had encountered some failure in the performance of the\nslight clerical task allotted to him, and the dean had tenderly\nadvised him to desist. He did not utter one word of remonstrance.\n\"It will perhaps be better,\" the dean had said. \"Yes,--it will be\nbetter,\" Mr. Harding had replied. \"Few have had accorded to them\nthe high privilege of serving their Master in His house for so many\nyears,--though few more humbly, or with lower gifts.\" But on the\nfollowing morning, and for nearly a week afterwards, he had been\nunable to face the minor canon and the vergers, and the old women\nwho knew him so well, in his ordinary black garments. At last he\nwent down with the dean, and occupied a stall close to the dean's\nseat,--far away from that in which he had sat for so many years,--and\nin this seat he had said his prayers ever since that day. And now his\nsurplices were washed and ironed and folded and put away; but there\nwere moments in which he would stealthily visit them, as he also\nstealthily visited his friend in the black wooden case. This was very\nmelancholy, and the sadness of it was felt by all those who lived\nwith him; but he never alluded himself to any of those bereavements\nwhich age brought upon him. Whatever might be his regrets, he kept\nthem ever within his own breast.\n\nPosy was with him when Mrs. Grantly went up into his room, holding\nfor him his hat and stick while he was engaged in brushing a\nsuspicion of dust from his black gaiters. \"Grandpapa, here is aunt\nSusan,\" said Posy. The old man looked up with something,--with some\nslightest sign of that habitual fear which was always aroused within\nhis bosom by visitations from Plumstead. Had Mrs. Arabin thoroughly\nunderstood the difference in her father's feeling toward herself and\ntoward her sister, I think she would hardly have gone forth upon\nany tour while he remained with her in the deanery. It is very hard\nsometimes to know how intensely we are loved, and of what value our\npresence is to those who love us! Mrs. Grantly saw the look,--did not\nanalyse it, did not quite understand it,--but felt, as she had so\noften felt before, that it was not altogether laden with welcome. But\nall this had nothing to do with the duty on which she had come; nor\ndid it, in the slightest degree, militate against her own affection.\n\"Papa,\" she said, kissing him, \"you are surprised to see me so\nearly?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, yes;--but very glad all the same. I hope everybody is\nwell at Plumstead?\"\n\n\"Everybody, thank you, papa.\"\n\n\"That is well. Posy and I are getting ready for church. Are we not,\nPosy?\"\n\n\"Grandpapa is getting ready. Mrs. Baxter won't let me go.\"\n\n\"No, my dear, no;--not yet, Posy. When Posy is a great girl she can\ngo to cathedral every day. Only then, perhaps, Posy won't want to\ngo.\"\n\n\"I thought that, perhaps, papa, you would sit with me a little while\nthis morning, instead of going to morning prayers.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear,--certainly. Only I do not like not going;--for\nwho can say how often I may be able to go again? There is so little\nleft, Susan,--so very little left.\"\n\nAfter that she had not the heart to ask him to stay, and therefore\nshe went with him. As they passed down the stairs and out of the\ndoors she was astonished to find how weak were his footsteps,--how\npowerless he was against the slightest misadventure. On this very\nday he would have tripped at the upward step at the cathedral door\nhad she not been with him. \"Oh, papa,\" she said, \"indeed, indeed,\nyou should not come here alone.\" Then he apologized for his little\nstumble with many words and much shame, assuring her that anybody\nmight trip on an occasion. It was purely an accident; and though it\nwas a comfort to him to have had her arm, he was sure that he should\nhave recovered himself even had he been alone. He always, he said,\nkept quite close to the wall, so that there might be no mistake,--no\npossibility of an accident. All this he said volubly, but with\nconfused words, in the covered stone passage leading into the\ntransept. And, as he thus spoke, Mrs. Grantly made up her mind that\nher father should never again go to the cathedral alone. He never did\ngo again to the cathedral,--alone.\n\nWhen they returned to the deanery, Mr. Harding was fluttered, weary,\nand unwell. When his daughter left him for a few minutes he told Mrs.\nBaxter, in confidence, the story of his accident, and his great grief\nthat his daughter should have seen it. \"Laws amercy, sir, it was\na blessing she was with you,\" said Mrs. Baxter; \"it was, indeed,\nMr. Harding.\" Then Mr. Harding had been angry, and spoke almost\ncrossly to Mrs. Baxter; but, before she left the room, he found an\nopportunity of begging her pardon,--not in a set speech to that\neffect, but by a little word of gentle kindness, which she had\nunderstood perfectly. \"Papa,\" said Mrs. Grantly to him as soon as\nshe had succeeded in getting both Posy and Mrs. Baxter out of the\nroom,--against the doing of which, Mr. Harding had manoeuvred with\nall his little impotent skill,--\"Papa, you must promise me that you\nwill not go to the cathedral again alone, till Eleanor comes home.\"\nWhen he heard the sentence he looked at her with blank misery in his\neyes. He made no attempt at remonstrance. He begged for no respite.\nThe word had gone forth, and he knew that it must be obeyed. Though\nhe would have hidden the signs of his weakness had he been able, he\nwould not condescend to plead that he was strong. \"If you think it\nwrong, my dear, I will not go alone,\" he said. \"Papa, I do; indeed,\nI do. Dear papa, I would not hurt you by saying it if I did not know\nthat I am right.\" He was sitting with his hand upon the table, and,\nas she spoke to him, she put her hand upon his, caressing it. \"My\ndear,\" he said, \"you are always right.\"\n\nShe then left him again for awhile, having some business out in\nthe city, and he was alone in his room for an hour. What was there\nleft to him now in the world? Old as he was, and in some things\nalmost childish, nevertheless, he thought of this keenly, and some\nhalf-realized remembrance of \"the lean and slippered pantaloon\"\nflitted across his mind, causing him a pang. What was there left to\nhim now in the world? Posy and cat's-cradle! Then, in the midst of\nhis regrets, as he sat with his back bent in his old easy-chair, with\none arm over the shoulder of the chair, and the other hanging loose\nby his side, on a sudden there came across his face a smile as sweet\nas ever brightened the face of man or woman. He had been able to tell\nhimself that he had no ground for complaint,--great ground rather for\nrejoicing and gratitude. Had not the world and all in it been good to\nhim; had he not children who loved him, who had done him honour, who\nhad been to him always a crown of glory, never a mark for reproach;\nhad not his lines fallen to him in very pleasant places; was it not\nhis happy fate to go and leave it all amidst the good words and kind\nloving cares of devoted friends? Whose latter days had ever been more\nblessed than his? And for the future--? It was as he thought of this\nthat that smile came across his face,--as though it were already\nthe face of an angel. And then he muttered to himself a word or\ntwo. \"Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace. Lord, now\nlettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Grantly returned she found him in jocund spirits. And yet\nshe perceived that he was so weak that when he left his chair he\ncould barely get across the room without assistance. Mrs. Baxter,\nindeed, had not sent to her too soon, and it was well that the\nprohibition had come in time to prevent some terrible accident.\n\"Papa,\" she said, \"I think you had better go with me to Plumstead.\nThe carriage is here, and I can take you home so comfortably.\" But he\nwould not allow himself to be taken on this occasion to Plumstead. He\nsmiled and thanked her, and put his hand into hers, and repeated his\npromise that he would not leave the house on any occasion without\nassistance, and declared himself specially thankful to her for\ncoming to him on that special morning;--but he would not be taken to\nPlumstead. \"When the summer comes,\" he said, \"then, if you will have\nme for a few days!\"\n\nHe meant no deceit, and yet he had told himself within the last hour\nthat he should never see another summer. He could not tell even his\ndaughter that after such a life as this, after more than fifty years\nspent in the ministrations of his darling cathedral, it specially\nbehoved him to die,--as he had lived,--at Barchester. He could not\nsay this to his eldest daughter; but had his Eleanor been at home, he\ncould have said it to her. He thought he might yet live to see his\nEleanor once again. If this could be given to him he would ask for\nnothing more.\n\nOn the afternoon of the next day, Mrs. Baxter wrote another letter,\nin which she told Mrs. Grantly that her father had declared, at his\nusual hour of rising that morning, that as he was not going to the\ncathedral he would, he thought, lie in bed a little longer. And then\nhe had lain in bed the whole day. \"And, perhaps, honoured madam,\nlooking at all things, it's best as he should,\" said Mrs. Baxter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nLADY LUFTON'S PROPOSITION.\n\n\nIt was now known throughout Barchester that a commission was to be\nheld by the bishop's orders, at which inquiry would be made,--that\nis, ecclesiastical inquiry,--as to the guilt imputed to Mr. Crawley\nin the matter of Mr. Soames's cheque. Sundry rumours had gone abroad\nas to quarrels which had taken place on the subject among certain\nclergymen high in office; but these were simply rumours, and nothing\nwas in truth known. There was no more discreet clergyman in all the\ndiocese than Dr. Tempest, and not a word had escaped from him as to\nthe stormy nature of that meeting in the bishop's palace, at which he\nhad attended with the bishop,--and at which Mrs. Proudie had attended\nalso. When it is said that the fact of this coming commission was\nknown to all Barsetshire, allusion is of course made to that portion\nof the inhabitants of Barsetshire to which clerical matters were\ndear;--and as such matters were specially dear to the inhabitants of\nthe parish of Framley, the commission was discussed very eagerly in\nthat parish, and was specially discussed by the Dowager Lady Lufton.\n\nAnd there was a double interest attached to the commission in the\nparish of Framley by the fact that Mr. Robarts, the vicar, had\nbeen invited by Dr. Tempest to be one of the clergymen who were to\nassist in making the inquiry. \"I also propose to ask Mr. Oriel of\nGreshamsbury to join us,\" said Dr. Tempest. \"The bishop wishes to\nappoint the other two, and has already named Mr. Thumble and Mr.\nQuiverful, who are both residents in the city. Perhaps his lordship\nmay be right in thinking it better that the matter should not be left\naltogether in the hands of clergymen who hold livings in the diocese.\nYou are no doubt aware that neither Mr. Thumble nor Mr. Quiverful do\nhold any benefice.\" Mr. Robarts felt,--as everybody else did feel\nwho knew anything of the matter,--that Bishop Proudie was singularly\nignorant in his knowledge of men, and that he showed his ignorance on\nthis special occasion. \"If he intended to name two such men he should\nat any rate have named three,\" said Dr. Thorne. \"Mr. Thumble and Mr.\nQuiverful will simply be outvoted on the first day, and after that\nwill give in their adhesion to the majority.\" \"Mr. Thumble, indeed!\"\nLady Lufton had said, with much scorn in her voice. To her thinking,\nit was absurd in the highest degree that such men as Dr. Tempest and\nher Mr. Robarts should be asked to meet Mr. Thumble and Mr. Quiverful\non a matter of ecclesiastical business. Outvoted! Of course they\nwould be outvoted. Of course they would be so paralyzed by fear at\nfinding themselves in the presence of real gentlemen, that they would\nhardly be able to vote at all. Old Lady Lufton did not in fact utter\nwords so harsh as these; but thoughts as harsh passed through her\nmind. The reader therefore will understand that much interest was\nfelt on the subject at Framley Court, where Lady Lufton lived with\nher son and her daughter-in-law.\n\n\"They tell me,\" said Lady Lufton, \"that both the archdeacon and Dr.\nTempest think it right that a commission should be held. If so, I\nhave no doubt that it is right.\"\n\n\"Mark says that the bishop could hardly do anything else,\" rejoined\nMrs. Robarts.\n\n\"I daresay not, my dear. I suppose the bishop has somebody near him\nto tell him what he may do, and what he may not do. It would be\nterrible to think of, if it were not so. But yet, when I hear that\nhe has named such men as Mr. Thumble and Mr. Quiverful, I cannot but\nfeel that the whole diocese is disgraced.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Lufton, that is such a strong word,\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"It may be strong, but it is not the less true,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\nAnd from talking on the subject of the Crawleys, Lady Lufton soon\nadvanced, first to a desire for some action, and then to acting.\n\"I think, my dear, I will go over and see Mrs. Crawley,\" said Lady\nLufton the elder to Lady Lufton the younger. Lady Lufton the younger\nhad nothing to urge against this; but she did not offer to accompany\nthe elder lady. I attempted to explain in the early part of this\nstory that there still existed a certain understanding between Mrs.\nCrawley and Lord Lufton's wife, and that kindnesses occasionally\npassed from Framley Court to Hogglestock Parsonage; but on this\noccasion young Lady Lufton,--the Lucy Robarts who had once passed\ncertain days of her life with the Crawleys at Hogglestock,--did not\nchoose to accompany her mother-in-law; and therefore Mrs. Robarts was\ninvited to do so. \"I think it may comfort her to know that she has\nour sympathy,\" the elder woman said to the younger as they made their\njourney together.\n\nWhen the carriage stopped before the little wicket-gate, from whence\na path led through a ragged garden from the road to Mr. Crawley's\nhouse, Lady Lufton hardly knew how to proceed. The servant came to\nthe door of the carriage, and asked for her orders. \"H--m--m, ha,\nyes; I think I'll send in my card;--and say that I hope Mrs. Crawley\nwill be able to see me. Won't that be best; eh, Fanny?\" Fanny,\notherwise Mrs. Robarts, said that she thought that would be best; and\nthe card and message were carried in.\n\nIt was happily the case that Mr. Crawley was not at home. Mr. Crawley\nwas away at Hoggle End, reading to the brickmakers, or turning the\nmangles of their wives, or teaching them theology, or politics, or\nhistory, after his fashion. In these days he spent, perhaps, the\nhappiest hours of his life down at Hoggle End. I say that his absence\nwas a happy chance, because, had he been at home, he would certainly\nhave said something, or done something, to offend Lady Lufton. He\nwould either have refused to see her, or when seeing her he would\nhave bade her hold her peace and not interfere with matters which did\nnot concern her, or,--more probable still,--he would have sat still\nand sullen, and have spoken not at all. But he was away, and Mrs.\nCrawley sent out word by the servant that she would be most proud to\nsee her ladyship, if her ladyship would be pleased to alight. Her\nladyship did alight, and walked into the parsonage, followed by Mrs.\nRobarts.\n\nGrace was with her mother. Indeed Jane had been there also when the\nmessage was brought in, but she fled into back regions, overcome by\nshame as to her frock. Grace, I think, would have fled too, had she\nnot been bound in honour to support her mother. Lady Lufton, as she\nentered, was very gracious, struggling with all the power of her\nwomanhood so to carry herself that there should be no outwardly\nvisible sign of her rank or her wealth,--but not altogether\nsucceeding. Mrs. Robarts, on her first entrance, said only a word or\ntwo of greeting to Mrs. Crawley, and kissed Grace, whom she had known\nintimately in early years. \"Lady Lufton,\" said Mrs. Crawley, \"I am\nafraid this is a very poor place for you to come to; but you have\nknown that of old, and therefore I need hardly apologize.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I like poor places best,\" said Lady Lufton. Then there was\na pause, after which Lady Lufton addressed herself to Grace, seeking\nsome subject for immediate conversation. \"You have been down at\nAllington, my dear, have you not?\" Grace, in a whisper, said that she\nhad. \"Staying with the Dales, I believe? I know the Dales well by\nname, and I have always heard that they are charming people.\"\n\n\"I like them very much,\" said Grace. And then there was another\npause.\n\n\"I hope your husband is pretty well, Mrs. Crawley?\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"He is pretty well,--not quite strong. I daresay you know, Lady\nLufton, that he has things to vex him?\" Mrs. Crawley felt that it was\nthe need of the moment that the only possible subject of conversation\nin that house should be introduced; and therefore she brought it in\nat once, not loving the subject, but being strongly conscious of the\nnecessity. Lady Lufton meant to be good-natured, and therefore Mrs.\nCrawley would do all in her power to make Lady Lufton's mission easy\nto her.\n\n\"Indeed yes,\" said her ladyship; \"we do know that.\"\n\n\"We feel so much for you and Mr. Crawley,\" said Mrs. Robarts; \"and\nare so sure that your sufferings are unmerited.\" This was not\ndiscreet on the part of Mrs. Robarts, as she was the wife of one\nof the clergymen who had been selected to form the commission of\ninquiry; and so Lady Lufton told her on their way home.\n\n\"You are very kind,\" said Mrs. Crawley. \"We must only bear it with\nsuch fortitude as God will give us. We are told that He tempers the\nwind to the shorn lamb.\"\n\n\"And so He does, my dear,\" said the old lady, very solemnly. \"So He\ndoes. Surely you have felt that it is so?\"\n\n\"I struggle not to complain,\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\n\"I know that you struggle bravely. I hear of you, and I admire you\nfor it, and I love you.\" It was still the old lady who was speaking,\nand now she had at last been roused out of her difficulty as to\nwords, and had risen from her chair, and was standing before Mrs.\nCrawley. \"It is because you do not complain, because you are so great\nand so good, because your character is so high, and your spirit so\nfirm, that I could not resist the temptation of coming to you. Mrs.\nCrawley, if you will let me be your friend, I shall be proud of your\nfriendship.\"\n\n\"Your ladyship is too good,\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\n\"Do not talk to me after that fashion,\" said Lady Lufton. \"If you do\nI shall be disappointed, and feel myself thrown back. You know what\nI mean.\" She paused for an answer; but Mrs. Crawley had no answer to\nmake. She simply shook her head, not knowing why she did so. But we\nmay know. We can understand that she had felt that the friendship\noffered to her by Lady Lufton was an impossibility. She had decided\nwithin her own breast that it was so, though she did not know that\nshe had come to such decision. \"I wish you to take me at my word,\nMrs. Crawley,\" continued Lady Lufton. \"What can we do for you? We\nknow that you are distressed.\"\n\n\"Yes,--we are distressed.\"\n\n\"And we know how cruel circumstances have been to you. Will you not\nforgive me for being plain?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to forgive,\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\n\"Lady Lufton means,\" said Mrs. Robarts, \"that in asking you to talk\nopenly to her of your affairs, she wishes you to remember that-- I\nthink you know what we mean,\" said Mrs. Robarts, knowing very well\nherself what she did mean, but not knowing at all how to express\nherself.\n\n\"Lady Lufton is very kind,\" said Mrs. Crawley, \"and so are you, Mrs.\nRobarts. I know how good you both are, and for how much it behoves\nme to be grateful.\" These words were very cold, and the voice in\nwhich they were spoken was very cold. They made Lady Lufton feel that\nit was beyond her power to proceed with the work of her mission in\nits intended spirit. It is ever so much easier to proffer kindness\ngraciously than to receive it with grace. Lady Lufton had intended\nto say, \"Let us be women together;--women bound by humanity, and not\nseparated by rank, and let us open our hearts freely. Let us see how\nwe may be of comfort to each other.\" And could she have succeeded in\nthis, she would have spread out her little plans of succour with so\nloving a hand that she would have conquered the woman before her. But\nthe suffering spirit cannot descend from its dignity of reticence. It\nhas a nobility of its own, made sacred by many tears, by the flowing\nof streams of blood from unseen wounds, which cannot descend from its\nda\u00c3\u00afs to receive pity and kindness. A consciousness of undeserved woe\nproduces a grandeur of its own, with which the high-souled sufferer\nwill not easily part. Baskets full of eggs, pounds of eleemosynary\nbutter, quarters of given pork, even second-hand clothing from the\nwardrobe of some richer sister,--even money, unsophisticated money,\nshe could accept. She had learned to know that it was a portion\nof her allotted misery to take such things,--for the sake of her\nchildren and her husband,--and to be thankful for them. She did take\nthem, and was thankful; and in the taking she submitted herself to\nthe rod of cruel circumstances; but she could not even yet bring\nherself to accept spoken pity from a stranger, and to kiss the\nspeaker.\n\n\"Can we not do something to help you?\" said Mrs. Robarts. She would\nnot have spoken but that she perceived that Lady Lufton had completed\nher appeal, and that Mrs. Crawley did not seem prepared to answer it.\n\n\"You have done much to help us,\" said Mrs. Crawley. \"The things you\nhave sent to us have been very serviceable.\"\n\n\"But we mean something more than that,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"I do not know what there is more,\" said Mrs. Crawley. \"A bit to eat\nand something to wear;--that seems to be all that we have to care for\nnow.\"\n\n\"But we were afraid that this coming trial must cause you so much\nanxiety.\"\n\n\"Of course it causes anxiety;--but what can we do? It must be so. It\ncannot be put off, or avoided. We have made up our minds to it now,\nand almost wish that it would come quicker. If it were once over I\nthink that he would be better whatever the result might be.\"\n\nThen there was another lull in the conversation, and Lady Lufton\nbegan to be afraid that her visit would be a failure. She thought\nthat perhaps she might get on better if Grace were not in the room,\nand she turned over in her mind various schemes for sending her away.\nAnd perhaps her task would be easier if Mrs. Robarts also could be\nbanished for a time. \"Fanny, my dear,\" she said at last, boldly, \"I\nknow you have a little plan to arrange with Miss Crawley. Perhaps you\nwill be more likely to be successful if you can take a turn with her\nalone.\" There was not much subtlety in her ladyship's scheme; but it\nanswered the proposed purpose, and the two elder ladies were soon\nleft face to face, so that Lady Lufton had a fair pretext for making\nanother attempt. \"Dear Mrs. Crawley,\" she said, \"I do so long to say\na word to you, but I fear that I may be thought to interfere.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Lady Lufton; I have no feeling of that kind.\"\n\n\"I have asked your daughter and Mrs. Robarts to go out because I can\nspeak more easily to you alone. I wish I could teach you to trust\nme.\"\n\n\"I do trust you.\"\n\n\"As a friend, I mean;--as a real friend. If it should be the case,\nMrs. Crawley, that a jury should give a verdict against your\nhusband,--what will you do then? Perhaps I ought not to suppose that\nit is possible.\"\n\n\"Of course we know that is possible,\" said Mrs. Crawley. Her voice\nwas stern, and there was in it a tone almost of offence. As she spoke\nshe did not look at her visitor, but sat with her face averted and\nher arms akimbo on the table.\n\n\"Yes;--it is possible,\" said Lady Lufton. \"I suppose there is not one\nin the county who does not truly wish that it may not be so. But it\nis right to be prepared for all alternatives. In such case have you\nthought what you will do?\"\n\n\"I do not know what they would do to him,\" said she.\n\n\"I suppose that for some time he would be--\"\n\n\"Put in prison,\" said Mrs. Crawley, speaking very quickly, bringing\nout the words with a sharp eagerness that was quite unusual to her.\n\"They will send him to gaol. Is it not so, Lady Lufton?\"\n\n\"I suppose it would be so; not for long I should hope; but I presume\nthat such would be the sentence for some short period.\"\n\n\"And I might not go with him?\"\n\n\"No; that would be impossible.\"\n\n\"And the house, and the living; would they let him have them again\nwhen he came out?\"\n\n\"Ah; that I cannot say. That will depend much, probably, on what\nthese clergymen will report. I hope he will not put himself in\nopposition to them.\"\n\n\"I do not know. I cannot say. It is probable that he may do so. It\nis not easy for a man so injured as he has been, and one at the same\ntime so great in intelligence, to submit himself gently to such\ninquiries. When ill is being done to himself or others he is very\nprone to oppose it.\"\n\n\"But these gentlemen do not wish to do him ill, Mrs. Crawley.\"\n\n\"I cannot say. I do not know. When I think of it I see that there is\nnothing but ruin on every side. What is the use of talking of it? Do\nnot be angry, Lady Lufton, if I say that it is of no use.\"\n\n\"But I desire to be of use,--of real use. If it should be the case,\nMrs. Crawley, that your husband should be--detained at Barchester--\"\n\n\"You mean imprisoned, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"Yes, I mean imprisoned. If it should be so, then do you bring\nyourself and your children,--all of them,--over to Framley, and I\nwill find a home for you while he is lost to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Lufton; I could not do that.\"\n\n\"Yes, you can. You have not heard me yet. It would not be a comfort\nto you in such a home as that to sit at table with people who are\npartly strangers to you. But there is a cottage nearly adjoining to\nthe house, which you shall have all to yourself. The bailiff lived\nin it once, and others have lived in it who belong to the place; but\nit is empty now and it shall be made comfortable.\" The tears were\nnow running down Mrs. Crawley's face, so that she could not answer a\nword. \"Of course it is my son's property, and not mine, but he has\ncommissioned me to say that it is most heartily at your service. He\nbegs that in such case you will occupy it. And I beg the same. And\nyour old friend Lucy has desired me also to ask you in her name.\"\n\n\"Lady Lufton, I could not do that,\" said Mrs. Crawley through her\ntears.\n\n\"You must think better of it, my dear. I do not scruple to advise\nyou, because I am older than you, and have experience of the world.\"\nThis, I think, taken in the ordinary sense of the words, was a boast\non the part of Lady Lufton, for which but little true pretence\nexisted. Lady Lufton's experience of the world at large was not\nperhaps extensive. Nevertheless she knew what one woman might offer\nto another, and what one woman might receive from another. \"You would\nbe better over with me, my dear, than you could be elsewhere. You\nwill not misunderstand me if I say that, under such circumstances, it\nwould do your husband good that you and your children should be under\nour protection during his period of temporary seclusion. We stand\nwell in the county. Perhaps I ought not to say so, but I do not know\nhow otherwise to explain myself; and when it is known, by the bishop\nand others, that you have come to us during that sad time, it will be\nunderstood that we think well of Mr. Crawley, in spite of anything\nthat a jury may say of him. Do you see that, my dear? And we do think\nwell of him. I have known of your husband for many years, though I\nhave not personally had the pleasure of much acquaintance with him.\nHe was over at Framley once at my request, and I had great occasion\nthen to respect him. I do respect him; and I shall feel grateful to\nhim if he will allow you to put yourself and your children under my\nwing, as being an old woman, should this misfortune fall upon him.\nWe hope that it will not fall upon him; but it is always well to be\nprovided for the worst.\"\n\nIn this way Lady Lufton at last made her speech and opened out the\nproposal with which she had come laden to Hogglestock. While she was\nspeaking Mrs. Crawley's shoulder was still turned to her; but the\nspeaker could see that the quick tears were pouring themselves down\nthe cheeks of the woman whom she addressed. There was a downright\nhonesty of thorough-going well-wishing charity about the proposition\nwhich overcame Mrs. Crawley altogether. She did not feel for a\nmoment that it would be possible for her to go to Framley in such\ncircumstances as those which had been suggested. As she thought of it\nall at the present moment, it seemed to her that her only appropriate\nhome during the terrible period which was coming upon her, would\nbe under the walls of the prison in which her husband would be\nincarcerated. But she fully appreciated the kindness which had\nsuggested a measure, which, if carried into execution, would make\nthe outside world feel that her husband was respected in the county,\ndespite the degradation to which he was subjected. She felt all this,\nbut her heart was too full to speak.\n\n\"Say that it shall be so, my dear,\" continued Lady Lufton. \"Just give\nme one nod of assent, and the cottage shall be ready for you should\nit so chance that you should require it.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Crawley did not give the nod of assent. With her face still\naverted, while the tears were still running down her cheeks, she\nmuttered but a word or two. \"I could not do that, Lady Lufton; I\ncould not do that.\"\n\n\"You know at any rate what my wishes are, and as you become calmer\nyou will think of it. There is quite time enough, and I am speaking\nof an alternative which may never happen. My dear friend Mrs.\nRobarts, who is now with your daughter, wishes Miss Crawley to go\nover to Framley Parsonage while this inquiry among the clergymen is\ngoing on. They all say it is the most ridiculous thing in all the\nworld,--this inquiry. But the bishop you know is so silly! We all\nthink that if Miss Crawley would go for a week or so to Framley\nParsonage, that it will show how happy we all are to receive her. It\nshould be while Mr. Robarts is employed in his part of the work. What\ndo you say, Mrs. Crawley? We at Framley are all clearly of opinion\nthat it will be best that it should be known that the people in\nthe county uphold your husband. Miss Crawley would be back, you\nknow, before the trial comes on. I hope you will let her come, Mrs.\nCrawley?\"\n\nBut even to this proposition Mrs. Crawley could give no assent,\nthough she expressed no direct dissent. As regarded her own feelings,\nshe would much have preferred to have been left to live through her\nmisery alone; but she could not but appreciate the kindness which\nendeavoured to throw over her and hers in their trouble the \u00c3\u00a6gis of\nfirst-rate county respectability. She was saved from the necessity\nof giving a direct answer to this suggestion by the return of Mrs.\nRobarts and Grace herself. The door was opened slowly, and they crept\ninto the room as though they were aware that their presence would be\nhardly welcomed.\n\n\"Is the carriage there, Fanny?\" said Lady Lufton. \"It is almost time\nfor us to think of returning home.\"\n\nMrs. Robarts said that the carriage was standing within twenty yards\nof the door.\n\n\"Then I think we will make a start,\" said Lady Lufton. \"Have you\nsucceeded in persuading Miss Crawley to come over to Framley in\nApril?\"\n\nMrs. Robarts made no answer to this, but looked at Grace; and Grace\nlooked down upon the ground.\n\n\"I have spoken to Mrs. Crawley,\" said Lady Lufton, \"and they will\nthink of it.\" Then the two ladies took their leave, and walked out to\ntheir carriage.\n\n\"What does she say about your plan?\" Mrs. Robarts asked.\n\n\"She is too broken-hearted to say anything,\" Lady Lufton answered.\n\"Should it happen that he is convicted, we must come over and take\nher. She will have no power then to resist us in anything.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nMRS. DOBBS BROUGHTON PILES HER FAGOTS.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe picture still progressed up in Mrs. Dobbs Broughton's room, and\nthe secret was still kept, or supposed to be kept. Miss Van Siever\nwas, at any rate, certain that her mother had heard nothing of it,\nand Mrs. Broughton reported from day to day that her husband had not\nas yet interfered. Nevertheless, there was in these days a great\ngloom upon the Dobbs Broughton household, so much so that Conway\nDalrymple had more than once suggested to Mrs. Broughton that the\nwork should be discontinued. But the mistress of the house would not\nconsent to this. In answer to these offers, she was wont to declare\nin somewhat mysterious language, that any misery coming upon herself\nwas matter of moment to nobody,--hardly even to herself, as she was\nquite prepared to encounter moral and social death without delay, if\nnot an absolute physical demise; as to which latter alternative, she\nseemed to think that even that might not be so far distant as some\npeople chose to believe. What was the cause of the gloom over the\nhouse neither Conway Dalrymple nor Miss Van Siever understood, and\nto speak the truth Mrs. Broughton did not quite understand the cause\nherself. She knew well enough, no doubt, that her husband came home\nalways sullen, and sometimes tipsy, and that things were not going\nwell in the City. She had never understood much about the City, being\nsatisfied with an assurance that had come to her in early days from\nher friends, that there was a mine of wealth in Hook Court, from\nwhence would always come for her use, house and furniture, a carriage\nand horses, dresses and jewels, which latter, if not quite real,\nshould be manufactured of the best sham substitute known. Soon after\nher brilliant marriage with Mr. Dobbs Broughton, she had discovered\nthat the carriage and horses, and the sham jewels, did not lift her\nso completely into a terrestrial paradise as she had taught herself\nto expect that they would do. Her brilliant drawing-room, with Dobbs\nBroughton for a companion, was not an elysium. But though she had\nfound out early in her married life that something was still wanting\nto her, she had by no means confessed to herself that the carriage\nand horses and sham jewels were bad, and it can hardly be said that\nshe had repented. She had endeavoured to patch up matters with a\nlittle romance, and then had fallen upon Conway Dalrymple,--meaning\nno harm. Indeed, love with her, as it never could have meant much\ngood, was not likely to mean much harm. That somebody should pretend\nto love her, to which pretence she might reply by a pretence of\nfriendship,--this was the little excitement which she craved, and by\nwhich she had once flattered herself that something of an elysium\nmight yet be created for her. Mr. Dobbs Broughton had unreasonably\nexpressed a dislike to this innocent amusement,--very unreasonably,\nknowing, as he ought to have known, that he himself did so very\nlittle towards providing the necessary elysium by any qualities of\nhis own. For a few weeks this interference from her husband had\nenhanced the amusement, giving an additional excitement to the game.\nShe felt herself to be a woman misunderstood and ill-used; and to\nsome women there is nothing so charming as a little mild ill-usage,\nwhich does not interfere with their creature comforts, with their\nclothes, or their carriage, or their sham jewels; but suffices to\nafford them the indulgence of a grievance. Of late, however, Mr.\nDobbs Broughton had become a little too rough in his language, and\nthings had gone uncomfortably. She suspected that Conway Dalrymple\nwas not the only cause of all this. She had an idea that Mr.\nMusselboro and Mrs. Van Siever had it in their power to make\nthemselves unpleasant, and that they were exercising this power. Of\nhis business in the City her husband never spoke to her, nor she to\nhim. Her own fortune had been very small, some couple of thousand\npounds or so, and she conceived that she had no pretext on which she\ncould, unasked, interrogate him about his money. She had no knowledge\nthat marriage of itself had given her the right to such interference;\nand had such knowledge been hers she would have had no desire to\ninterfere. She hoped that the carriage and sham jewels would be\ncontinued to her; but she did not know how to frame any question on\nthe subject. Touching the other difficulty,--the Conway Dalrymple\ndifficulty,--she had her ideas. The tenderness of her friendship had\nbeen trodden upon and outraged by the rough foot of an overbearing\nhusband, and she was ill-used. She would obey. It was becoming to her\nas a wife that she should submit. She would give up Conway Dalrymple,\nand would induce him,--in spite of his violent attachment to\nherself,--to take a wife. She herself would choose a wife for him.\nShe herself would, with suicidal hands, destroy the romance of her\nown life, since an overbearing, brutal husband demanded that it\nshould be destroyed. She would sacrifice her own feelings, and do all\nin her power to bring Conway Dalrymple and Clara Van Siever together.\nIf, after that, some poet did not immortalize her friendship in\nByronic verse, she certainly would not get her due. Perhaps Conway\nDalrymple would himself become a poet in order that this might be\ndone properly. For it must be understood that, though she expected\nConway Dalrymple to marry, she expected also that he should be\nByronically wretched after his marriage on account of his love for\nherself.\n\nBut there was certainly something wrong over and beyond the Dalrymple\ndifficulty. The servants were not as civil as they used to be, and\nher husband, when she suggested to him a little dinner-party, snubbed\nher most unmercifully. The giving of dinner-parties had been his\nglory, and she had made the suggestion simply with the view of\npleasing him. \"If the world were going round the wrong way, a woman\nwould still want a party,\" he had said, sneering at her. \"It was\nof you I was thinking, Dobbs,\" she replied; \"not of myself. I care\nlittle for such gatherings.\" After that she retired to her own room\nwith a romantic tear in each eye, and told herself that, had chance\nthrown Conway Dalrymple into her way before she had seen Dobbs\nBroughton, she would have been the happiest woman in the world. She\nsat for a while looking into vacancy, and thinking that it would be\nvery nice to break her heart. How should she set about it? Should\nshe take to her bed and grow thin? She would begin by eating no\ndinner for ever so many days together. At lunch her husband was never\npresent, and therefore the broken heart could be displayed at dinner\nwithout much positive suffering. In the meantime she would implore\nConway Dalrymple to get himself married with as little delay as\npossible, and she would lay upon him her positive order to restrain\nhimself from any word of affection addressed to herself. She, at any\nrate, would be pure, high-minded, and self-sacrificing,--although\nromantic and poetic also, as was her nature.\n\nThe picture was progressing, and so also, as it had come about, was\nthe love-affair between the artist and his model. Conway Dalrymple\nhad begun to think that he might, after all, do worse than make Clara\nVan Siever his wife. Clara Van Siever was handsome, and undoubtedly\nclever, and Clara Van Siever's mother was certainly rich. And, in\naddition to this, the young lady herself began to like the man into\nwhose society she was thrown. The affair seemed to flourish, and Mrs.\nDobbs Broughton should have been delighted. She told Clara, with a\nvery serious air, that she was delighted, bidding Clara, at the same\ntime, to be very cautious, as men were so fickle, and as Conway,\nthough the best fellow in the world, was not, perhaps, altogether\nfree from that common vice of men. Indeed, it might have been\nsurmised, from a word or two which Mrs. Broughton allowed to escape,\nthat she considered poor Conway to be more than ordinarily afflicted\nin that way. Miss Van Siever at first only pouted, and said that\nthere was nothing in it. \"There is something in it, my dear,\ncertainly,\" said Mrs. Dobbs Broughton; \"and there can be no earthly\nreason why there should not be a great deal in it.\" \"There is nothing\nin it,\" said Miss Van Siever, impetuously; \"and if you will continue\nto speak of Mr. Dalrymple in that way, I must give up the picture.\"\n\"As for that,\" said Mrs. Broughton, \"I conceive that we are both of\nus bound to the young man now, seeing that he has given so much time\nto the work.\" \"I am not bound to him at all,\" said Miss Van Siever.\n\nMrs. Broughton also told Conway Dalrymple that she was\ndelighted,--oh, so much delighted! He had obtained permission to come\nin one morning before the time of sitting, so that he might work at\nhis canvas independently of his model. As was his custom, he made his\nown way upstairs and commenced his work alone,--having been expressly\ntold by Mrs. Broughton that she would not come to him till she\nbrought Clara with her. But she did go up to the room in which the\nartist was painting, without waiting for Miss Van Siever. Indeed, she\nwas at this time so anxious as to the future welfare of her two young\nfriends that she could not restrain herself from speaking either to\nthe one or to the other, whenever any opportunity for such speech\ncame round. To have left Conway Dalrymple at work upstairs without\ngoing to him was impossible to her. So she went, and then took the\nopportunity of expressing to her friend her ideas as to his past and\nfuture conduct.\n\n\"Yes, it is very good; very good, indeed,\" she said, standing before\nthe easel, and looking at the half-completed work. \"I do not know\nthat you ever did anything better.\"\n\n\"I never can tell myself till a picture is finished whether it is\ngoing to be good or not,\" said Dalrymple, thinking really of his\npicture and of nothing else.\n\n\"I am sure this will be good,\" she said, \"and I suppose it is because\nyou have thrown so much heart into it. It is not mere industry that\nwill produce good work, nor yet skill, nor even genius: more than\nthis is required. The heart of the artist must be thrust with all its\ngushing tides into the performance.\" By this time he knew all the\ntones of her voice and their various meanings, and immediately became\naware that at the present moment she was intent upon something beyond\nthe picture. She was preparing for a little scene, and was going to\ngive him some advice. He understood it all, but as he was really\ndesirous of working at his canvas, and was rather averse to having a\nscene at that moment, he made a little attempt to disconcert her. \"It\nis the heart that gives success,\" she said, while he was considering\nhow he might best put an extinguisher upon her romance for the\noccasion.\n\n\"Not at all, Mrs. Broughton; success depends on elbow-grease.\"\n\n\"On what, Conway?\"\n\n\"On elbow-grease,--hard work, that is,--and I must work hard now if\nI mean to take advantage of to-day's sitting. The truth is, I don't\ngive enough hours of work to it.\" And he leaned upon his stick, and\ndaubed away briskly at the background, and then stood for a moment\nlooking at his canvas with his head a little on one side, as though\nhe could not withdraw his attention for a moment from the thing he\nwas doing.\n\n\"You mean to say, Conway, that you would rather that I should not\nspeak to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Mrs. Broughton, I did not mean that at all.\"\n\n\"I won't interrupt you at your work. What I have to say is perhaps of\nno great moment. Indeed, words between you and me never can have much\nimportance now. Can they, Conway?\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all,\" said he, still working away with his\nbrush.\n\n\"Do you not? I do. They should never amount to more,--they can never\namount to more than the common, ordinary courtesies of life; what I\ncall the greetings and good-byings of conversation.\" She said this in\na low, melancholy tone of voice, not intending to be in any degree\njocose. \"How seldom is it that conversation between ordinary friends\ngoes beyond that.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it does?\" said Conway, stepping back and taking\nanother look at his picture. \"I find myself talking to all manner of\npeople about all manner of things.\"\n\n\"You are different from me. I cannot talk to all manner of people.\"\n\n\"Politics, you know, and art, and a little scandal, and the wars,\nwith a dozen other things, make talking easy enough, I think. I grant\nyou this, that it is very often a great bore. Hardly a day passes\nthat I don't wish to cut out somebody's tongue.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to cut out my tongue, Conway?\"\n\nHe began to perceive that she was determined to talk about herself,\nand that there was no remedy. He dreaded it, not because he did not\nlike the woman, but from a conviction that she was going to make some\ncomparison between herself and Clara Van Siever. In his ordinary\nhumour he liked a little pretence at romance, and was rather good\nat that sort of love-making which in truth means anything but love.\nBut just now he was really thinking of matrimony, and had on this\nvery morning acknowledged to himself that he had become sufficiently\nattached to Clara Van Siever to justify him in asking her to be his\nwife. In his present mood he was not anxious for one of those tilts\nwith blunted swords and half-severed lances in the lists of Cupid\nof which Mrs. Dobbs Broughton was so fond. Nevertheless, if she\ninsisted that he should now descend into the arena and go through\nthe paraphernalia of a mock tournament, he must obey her. It is the\nhardship of men that when called upon by women for romance, they are\nbound to be romantic, whether the opportunity serves them or does\nnot. A man must produce romance, or at least submit to it, when duly\nsummoned, even though he should have a sore-throat or a headache. He\nis a brute if he decline such an encounter,--and feels that, should\nhe so decline persistently, he will ever after be treated as a brute.\nThere are many Potiphar's wives who never dream of any mischief, and\nJosephs who are very anxious to escape, though they are asked to\nreturn only whisper for whisper. Mrs. Dobbs Broughton had asked him\nwhether he wished that her tongue should be cut out, and he had of\ncourse replied that her words had always been a joy to him,--never\na trouble. It occurred to him as he made his little speech that it\nwould only have served her right if he had answered her quite in\nanother strain; but she was a woman, and was young and pretty, and\nwas entitled to flattery. \"They have always been a joy to me,\" he\nsaid, repeating his last words as he strove to continue his work.\n\n\"A deadly joy,\" she replied, not quite knowing what she herself\nmeant. \"A deadly joy, Conway. I wish with all my heart that we had\nnever known each other.\"\n\n\"I do not. I will never wish away the happiness of my life, even\nshould it be followed by misery.\"\n\n\"You are a man, and if trouble comes upon you, you can bear it on\nyour own shoulders. A woman suffers more, just because another's\nshoulders may have to bear the burden.\"\n\n\"When she has got a husband, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes,--when she has a husband.\"\n\n\"It's the same with a man when he has a wife.\" Hitherto the\nconversation had had so much of milk-and-water in its composition,\nthat Dalrymple found himself able to keep it up and go on with his\nbackground at the same time. If she could only be kept in the same\ndim cloud of sentiment, if the hot rays of the sun of romance could\nbe kept from breaking through the mist till Miss Van Siever should\ncome, it might still be well. He had known her to wander about within\nthe clouds for an hour together, without being able to find her way\ninto the light. \"It's all the same with a man when he has got a\nwife,\" he said. \"Of course one has to suffer for two, when one, so to\nsay, is two.\"\n\n\"And what happens when one has to suffer for three?\" she asked.\n\n\"You mean when a woman has children?\"\n\n\"I mean nothing of the kind, Conway; and you must know that I do not,\nunless your feelings are indeed blunted. But worldly success has, I\nsuppose, blunted them.\"\n\n\"I rather fancy not,\" he said. \"I think they are pretty nearly as\nsharp as ever.\"\n\n\"I know mine are. Oh, how I wish I could rid myself of them! But it\ncannot be done. Age will not blunt them,--I am sure of that,\" said\nMrs. Broughton. \"I wish it would.\"\n\nHe had determined not to talk about herself if the subject could be\nin any way avoided; but now he felt that he was driven up into a\ncorner;--now he was forced to speak to her of her own personality.\n\"You have no experience yet as to that. How can you say what age will\ndo?\"\n\n\"Age does not go by years,\" said Mrs. Dobbs Broughton. \"We all know\nthat. 'His hair was grey, but not with years.' Look here, Conway,\"\nand she moved back her tresses from off her temples to show him that\nthere were gray hairs behind. He did not see them; and had they been\nvery visible she might not perhaps have been so ready to exhibit\nthem. \"No one can say that length of years has blanched them. I have\nno secrets from you about my age. One should not be grey before one\nhas reached thirty.\"\n\n\"I did not see a changed hair.\"\n\n\"'Twas the fault of your eyes, then, for there are plenty of them.\nAnd what is it has made them grey?\"\n\n\"They say that hot rooms will do it.\"\n\n\"Hot rooms! No, Conway, it does not come from heated atmosphere. It\ncomes from a cold heart, a chilled heart, a frozen heart, a heart\nthat is all ice.\" She was getting out of the cloud into the heat now,\nand he could only hope that Miss Van Siever would come soon. \"The\nworld is beginning with you, Conway, and yet you are as old as I am.\nIt is ending with me, and yet I am as young as you are. But I do not\nknow why I talk of all this. It is simply folly,--utter folly. I\nhad not meant to speak of myself; but I did wish to say a few words\nto you of your own future. I suppose I may still speak to you as a\nfriend?\"\n\n\"I hope you will always do that.\"\n\n\"Nay,--I will make no such promise. That I will always have a\nfriend's feeling for you, a friend's interest in your welfare, a\nfriend's triumph in your success,--that I will promise. But friendly\nwords, Conway, are sometimes misunderstood.\"\n\n\"Never by me,\" said he.\n\n\"No, not by you,--certainly not by you. I did not mean that. I did\nnot expect that you should misinterpret them.\" Then she laughed\nhysterically,--a little low, gurgling, hysterical laugh; and after\nthat she wiped her eyes, and then she smiled, and then she put her\nhand very gently upon his shoulder. \"Thank God, Conway, we are quite\nsafe there,--are we not?\"\n\nHe had made a blunder, and it was necessary that he should correct\nit. His watch was lying in the trough of his easel, and he looked at\nit and wondered why Miss Van Siever was not there. He had tripped,\nand he must make a little struggle and recover his step. \"As I said\nbefore, it shall never be misunderstood by me. I have never been vain\nenough to suppose for a moment that there was any other feeling,--not\nfor a moment. You women can be so careful, while we men are always\noff our guard! A man loves because he cannot help it; but a woman has\nbeen careful, and answers him--with friendship. Perhaps I am wrong to\nsay that I never thought of winning anything more; but I never think\nof winning more now.\" Why the mischief didn't Miss Van Siever come!\nIn another five minutes, despite himself, he would be on his knees,\nmaking a mock declaration, and she would be pouring forth the vial of\nher mock wrath, or giving him mock counsel as to the restraint of his\npassion. He had gone through it all before, and was tired of it; but\nfor his life he did not know how to help himself.\n\n\"Conway,\" said she, gravely, \"how dare you address me in such\nlanguage?\"\n\n\"Of course it is very wrong; I know that.\"\n\n\"I'm not speaking of myself, now. I have learned to think so little\nof myself, as even to be indifferent to the feeling of the injury you\nare doing me. My life is a blank, and I almost think that nothing\ncan hurt me further. I have not heart left enough to break; no, not\nenough to be broken. It is not of myself that I am thinking, when I\nask you how you dare to address me in such language. Do you not know\nthat it is an injury to another?\"\n\n\"To what other?\" asked Conway Dalrymple, whose mind was becoming\nrather confused, and who was not quite sure whether the other one was\nMr. Dobbs Broughton, or somebody else.\n\n\"To that poor girl who is coming here now, who is devoted to you, and\nto whom, I do not doubt, you have uttered words which ought to have\nmade it impossible for you to speak to me as you spoke not a moment\nsince.\"\n\nThings were becoming very grave and difficult. They would have been\nvery grave, indeed, had not some god saved him by sending Miss Van\nSiever to his rescue at this moment. He was beginning to think what\nhe would say in answer to the accusation now made, when his eager ear\ncaught the sound of her step upon the stairs; and before the pause\nin the conversation which the circumstances admitted had given place\nto the necessity for further speech, Miss Van Siever had knocked at\nthe door and had entered the room. He was rejoiced, and I think that\nMrs. Broughton did not regret the interference. It is always well\nthat these little dangerous scenes should be brought to sudden ends.\nThe last details of such romances, if drawn out to their natural\nconclusions, are apt to be uncomfortable, if not dull. She did not\nwant him to go down on his knees, knowing that the getting up again\nis always awkward.\n\n\"Clara, I began to think you were never coming,\" said Mrs. Broughton,\nwith her sweetest smile.\n\n\"I began to think so myself also,\" said Clara. \"And I believe this\nmust be the last sitting, or, at any rate, the last but one.\"\n\n\"Is anything the matter at home?\" said Mrs. Broughton, clasping her\nhands together.\n\n\"Nothing very much; mamma asked me a question or two this morning,\nand I said I was coming here. Had she asked me why, I should have\ntold her.\"\n\n\"But what did she ask? What did she say?\"\n\n\"She does not always make herself very intelligible. She complains\nwithout telling you what she complains of. But she muttered something\nabout artists which was not complimentary, and I suppose, therefore,\nthat she has a suspicion. She stayed ever so late this morning,\nand we left the house together. She will ask some direct question\nto-night, or before long, and then there will be an end of it.\"\n\n\"Let us make the best of our time then,\" said Dalrymple; and the\nsitting was arranged; Miss Van Siever went down on her knees with her\nhammer in her hand, and the work began. Mrs. Broughton had twisted a\nturban round Clara's head, as she always did on these occasions, and\nassisted to arrange the drapery. She used to tell herself as she did\nso, that she was like Isaac, piling the fagots for her own sacrifice.\nOnly Isaac had piled them in ignorance, and she piled them conscious\nof the sacrificial flames. And Isaac had been saved; whereas it was\nimpossible that the catching of any ram in any thicket could save\nher. But, nevertheless, she arranged the drapery with all her skill,\npiling the fagots ever so high for her own pyre. In the meantime\nConway Dalrymple painted away, thinking more of his picture than he\ndid of one woman or of the other.\n\n[Illustration: Mrs. Dobbs Broughton piles her Fagots.]\n\nAfter a while, when Mrs. Broughton had piled the fagots as high as\nshe could pile them, she got up from her seat and prepared to leave\nthe room. Much of the piling consisted, of course, in her own absence\nduring a portion of these sittings. \"Conway,\" she said, as she went,\n\"if this is to be the last sitting, or the last but one, you should\nmake the most of it.\" Then she threw upon him a very peculiar glance\nover the head of the kneeling Jael, and withdrew. Jael, who in those\nmoments would be thinking more of the fatigue of her position than\nof anything else, did not at all take home to herself the peculiar\nmeaning of her friend's words. Conway Dalrymple understood them\nthoroughly, and thought that he might as well take the advice given\nto him. He had made up his mind to propose to Miss Van Siever, and\nwhy should he not do so now? He went on with his brush for a couple\nof minutes without saying a word, working as well as he could work,\nand then resolved that he would at once begin the other task. \"Miss\nVan Siever,\" he said, \"I'm afraid you are tired?\"\n\n\"Not more than usually tired. It is fatiguing to be slaying Sisera by\nthe hour together. I do get to hate this block.\" The block was the\ndummy by which the form of Sisera was supposed to be typified.\n\n\"Another sitting will about finish it,\" said he, \"so that you need\nnot positively distress yourself now. Will you rest yourself for a\nminute or two?\" He had already perceived that the attitude in which\nClara was posed before him was not one in which an offer of marriage\ncould be received and replied to with advantage.\n\n\"Thank you, I am not tired yet,\" said Clara, not changing the fixed\nglance of national wrath with which she regarded her wooden Sisera as\nshe held her hammer on high.\n\n\"But I am. There; we will rest for a moment.\" Dalrymple was aware\nthat Mrs. Dobbs Broughton, though she was very assiduous in piling\nher fagots, never piled them for long together. If he did not make\nhaste she would be back upon them before he could get his word\nspoken. When he put down his brush, and got up from his chair, and\nstretched out his arm as a man does when he ceases for a moment from\nhis work, Clara of course got up also, and seated herself. She was\nused to her turban and her drapery, and therefore thought not of it\nat all; and he also was used to it, seeing her in it two or three\ntimes a week; but now that he intended to accomplish a special\npurpose, the turban and the drapery seemed to be in the way. \"I do so\nhope you will like the picture,\" he said, as he was thinking of this.\n\n\"I don't think I shall. But you will understand that it is natural\nthat a girl should not like herself in such a portraiture as that.\"\n\n\"I don't know why. I can understand that you specially should not\nlike the picture; but I think that most women in London in your place\nwould at any rate say that they did.\"\n\n\"Are you angry with me?\"\n\n\"What; for telling the truth? No, indeed.\" He was standing opposite\nto his easel, looking at the canvas, shifting his head about so as to\nchange the lights, and observing critically this blemish and that;\nand yet he was all the while thinking how he had best carry out his\npurpose. \"It will have been a prosperous picture to me,\" he said at\nlast, \"if it leads to the success of which I am ambitious.\"\n\n\"I am told that all you do is successful now,--merely because you do\nit. That is the worst of success.\"\n\n\"What is the worst of success?\"\n\n\"That when won by merit it leads to further success, for the gaining\nof which no merit is necessary.\"\n\n\"I hope it may be so in my case. If it is not I shall have a very\npoor chance. Clara, I think you must know that I am not talking about\nmy pictures.\"\n\n\"I thought you were.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am not. As for success in my profession, far as I am from\nthinking I merit it, I feel tolerably certain that I shall obtain\nit.\"\n\n\"You have obtained it.\"\n\n\"I am in the way to do so. Perhaps one out of ten struggling artists\nis successful, and for him the profession is very charming. It is\ncertainly a sad feeling that there is so much of chance in the\ndistribution of the prizes. It is a lottery. But one cannot complain\nof that when one has drawn the prize.\" Dalrymple was not a man\nwithout self-possession, nor was he readily abashed, but he found it\neasier to talk of his possession than to make his offer. The turban\nwas his difficulty. He had told himself over and over again within\nthe last five minutes, that he would have long since said what he\nhad to say had it not been for the turban. He had been painting all\nhis life from living models,--from women dressed up in this or that\ncostume, to suit the necessities of his picture,--but he had never\nmade love to any of them. They had been simply models to him, and now\nhe found that there was a difficulty. \"Of that prize,\" he said, \"I\nhave made myself tolerably sure; but as to the other prize, I do not\nknow. I wonder whether I am to have that.\" Of course Miss Van Siever\nunderstood well what was the prize of which he was speaking; and as\nshe was a young woman with a will and purpose of her own, no doubt\nshe was already prepared with an answer. But it was necessary that\nthe question should be put to her in properly distinct terms. Conway\nDalrymple certainly had not put his question in properly distinct\nterms at present. She did not choose to make any answer to his last\nwords; and therefore simply suggested that as time was pressing he\nhad better go on with his work. \"I am quite ready now,\" said she.\n\n\"Stop half a moment. How much more you are thinking of the picture\nthan I am! I do not care twopence for the picture. I will slit the\ncanvas from top to bottom without a groan,--without a single inner\ngroan,--if you will let me.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake do nothing of the kind! Why should you?\"\n\n\"Just to show you that it is not for the sake of the picture that\nI come here. Clara--\" Then the door was opened, and Isaac appeared,\nvery weary, having been piling fagots with assiduity, till human\nnature could pile no more. Conway Dalrymple, who had made his way\nalmost up to Clara's seat, turned round sharply towards his easel, in\nanger at having been disturbed. He should have been more grateful for\nall that his Isaac had done for him, and have recognized the fact\nthat the fault had been with himself. Mrs. Broughton had been twelve\nminutes out of the room. She had counted them to be fifteen,--having\nno doubt made a mistake as to three,--and had told herself that\nwith such a one as Conway Dalrymple, with so much of the work ready\ndone to his hand for him, fifteen minutes should have been amply\nsufficient. When we reflect what her own thoughts must have been\nduring the interval,--what it is to have to pile up such fagots as\nthose, how she was, as it were, giving away a fresh morsel of her own\nheart during each minute that she allowed Clara and Conway Dalrymple\nto remain together, it cannot surprise us that her eyes should have\nbecome dizzy, and that she should not have counted the minutes with\naccurate correctness. Dalrymple turned to his picture angrily, but\nMiss Van Siever kept her seat and did not show the slightest emotion.\n\n\"My friends,\" said Mrs. Broughton, \"this will not do. This is not\nworking; this is not sitting.\"\n\n\"Mr. Dalrymple has been explaining to me the precarious nature of an\nartist's profession,\" said Clara.\n\n\"It is not precarious with him,\" said Mrs. Dobbs Broughton,\nsententiously.\n\n\"Not in a general way, perhaps; but to prove the truth of his words\nhe was going to treat Jael worse than Jael treats Sisera.\"\n\n\"I was going to slit the picture from the top to the bottom.\"\n\n\"And why?\" said Mrs. Broughton, putting up her hands to heaven in\ntragic horror.\n\n\"Just to show Miss Van Siever how little I care about it.\"\n\n\"And how little you care about her, too,\" said Mrs. Broughton.\n\n\"She might take that as she liked.\" After this there was another\ngenuine sitting, and the real work went on as though there had been\nno episode. Jael fixed her face, and held her hammer as though her\nmind and heart were solely bent on seeming to be slaying Sisera.\nDalrymple turned his eyes from the canvas to the model, and from the\nmodel to the canvas, working with his hand all the while, as though\nthat last pathetic \"Clara\" had never been uttered; and Mrs. Dobbs\nBroughton reclined on a sofa, looking at them and thinking of her own\nsingularly romantic position, till her mind was filled with a poetic\nfrenzy. In one moment she resolved that she would hate Clara as\nwoman was never hated by woman; and then there were daggers, and\npoison-cups, and strangling cords in her eye. In the next she was as\nfirmly determined that she would love Mrs. Conway Dalrymple as woman\nnever was loved by woman; and then she saw herself kneeling by a\ncradle, and tenderly nursing a baby, of which Conway was to be the\nfather and Clara the mother. And so she went to sleep.\n\nFor some time Dalrymple did not observe this; but at last there was\na little sound,--even the ill-nature of Miss Demolines could hardly\nhave called it a snore,--and he became aware that for practical\npurposes he and Miss Van Siever were again alone together. \"Clara,\"\nhe said, in a whisper. Mrs. Broughton instantly aroused herself from\nher slumbers, and rubbed her eyes. \"Dear, dear, dear,\" she said, \"I\ndeclare it's past one. I'm afraid I must turn you both out. One more\nsitting, I suppose, will finish it, Conway?\"\n\n\"Yes, one more,\" said he. It was always understood that he and Clara\nshould not leave the house together, and therefore he remained\npainting when she left the room. \"And now, Conway,\" said Mrs.\nBroughton, \"I suppose that all is over?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by all being over.\"\n\n\"No,--of course not. You look at it in another light, no doubt.\nEverything is beginning for you. But you must pardon me, for my heart\nis distracted,--distracted,--distracted!\" Then she sat down upon the\nfloor, and burst into tears. What was he to do? He thought that the\nwoman should either give him up altogether, or not give him up. All\nthis fuss about it was irrational! He would not have made love to\nClara Van Siever in her room if she had not told him to do so!\n\n\"Maria,\" he said, in a very grave voice, \"any sacrifice that is\nrequired on my part on your behalf I am ready to make.\"\n\n\"No, sir; the sacrifices shall all be made by me. It is the part of\na woman to be ever sacrificial!\" Poor Mrs. Dobbs Broughton! \"You\nshall give up nothing. The world is at your feet, and you shall\nhave everything,--youth, beauty, wealth, station, love,--love; and\nfriendship also, if you will accept it from one so poor, so broken,\nso secluded as I shall be.\" At each of the last words there had been\na desperate sob; and as she was still crouching in the middle of the\nroom, looking up into Dalrymple's face while he stood over her, the\nscene was one which had much in it that transcended the doings of\neveryday life, much that would be ever memorable, and much, I have\nno doubt, that was thoroughly enjoyed by the principal actor. As for\nConway Dalrymple, he was so second-rate a personage in the whole\nthing, that it mattered little whether he enjoyed it or not. I don't\nthink he did enjoy it. \"And now, Conway,\" she said, \"I will give\nyou some advice. And when in after-days you shall remember this\ninterview, and reflect how that advice was given you,--with what\nsolemnity,\"--here she clasped both her hands together,--\"I think that\nyou will follow it. Clara Van Siever will now become your wife.\"\n\n\"I do not know that at all,\" said Dalrymple.\n\n\"Clara Van Siever will now become your wife,\" repeated Mrs. Broughton\nin a louder voice, impatient of opposition. \"Love her. Cleave to her.\nMake her flesh of your flesh and bone of your bone. But rule her!\nYes, rule her! Let her be your second self, but not your first self.\nRule her. Love her. Cleave to her. Do not leave her alone, to feed on\nher own thoughts as I have done,--as I have been forced to do. Now\ngo. No, Conway, not a word; I will not hear a word. You must go, or\nI must.\" Then she rose quickly from her lowly attitude, and prepared\nherself for a dart at the door. It was better by far that he should\ngo, and so he went.\n\nAn American when he has spent a pleasant day will tell you that he\nhas had \"a good time.\" I think that Mrs. Dobbs Broughton, if she\nhad ever spoken the truth of that day's employment, would have\nacknowledged that she had had \"a good time.\" I think that she enjoyed\nher morning's work. But as for Conway Dalrymple, I doubt whether he\ndid enjoy his morning's work. \"A man may have too much of this sort\nof thing, and then he becomes very sick of his cake.\" Such was the\nnature of his thoughts as he returned to his own abode.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nWHY DON'T YOU HAVE AN \"IT\" FOR YOURSELF?\n\n\nOf course it came to pass that Lily Dale and Emily Dunstable were\nsoon very intimate, and that they saw each other every day. Indeed,\nbefore long they would have been living together in the same house\nhad it not been that the squire had felt reluctant to abandon the\nindependence of his own lodgings. When Mrs. Thorne had pressed her\ninvitation for the second, and then for the third time, asking them\nboth to come to her large house, he had begged his niece to go and\nleave him alone. \"You need not regard me,\" he had said, speaking\nnot with the whining voice of complaint, but with that thin tinge\nof melancholy which was usual to him. \"I am so much alone down at\nAllington, that you need not mind leaving me.\" But Lily would not\ngo on those terms, and therefore they still lived together in the\nlodgings. Nevertheless Lily was every day at Mrs. Thorne's house, and\nthus a great intimacy grew up between the girls. Emily Dunstable had\nneither brother nor sister, and Lily's nearest male relative in her\nown degree was now Miss Dunstable's betrothed husband. It was natural\ntherefore that they should at any rate try to like each other. It\nafterwards came to pass that Lily did go to Mrs. Thorne's house, and\nshe stayed there for awhile; but when that occurred the squire had\ngone back to Allington.\n\nAmong other generous kindnesses Mrs. Thorne insisted that Bernard\nshould hire a horse for his cousin Lily. Emily Dunstable rode daily,\nand of course Captain Dale rode with her;--and now Lily joined the\nparty. Almost before she knew what was being done she found herself\nprovided with hat and habit and horse and whip. It was a way with\nMrs. Thorne that they who came within the influence of her immediate\nsphere should be made to feel that the comforts and luxuries arising\nfrom her wealth belonged to a common stock, and were the joint\nproperty of them all. Things were not offered and taken and talked\nabout, but they made their appearance, and were used as a matter of\ncourse. If you go to stay at a gentleman's house you understand that,\nas a matter of course, you will be provided with meat and drink. Some\nhosts furnish you also with cigars. A small number give you stabling\nand forage for your horse; and a very select few mount you on\nhunting days, and send you out with a groom and a second horse.\nMrs. Thorne went beyond all others in this open-handed hospitality.\nShe had enormous wealth at her command, and had but few of those\nall-absorbing drains upon wealth which in this country make so many\nrich men poor. She had no family property,--no place to keep up in\nwhich she did not live. She had no retainers to be maintained because\nthey were retainers. She had neither sons nor daughters. Consequently\nshe was able to be lavish in her generosity; and as her heart was\nvery lavish, she would have given her friends gold to eat had\ngold been good for eating. Indeed there was no measure in her\ngiving,--unless when the idea came upon her that the recipient of\nher favours was trading on them. Then she could hold her hand very\nstoutly.\n\nLily Dale had not liked the idea of being fitted out thus\nexpensively. A box at the opera was all very well, as it was not\nprocured especially for her. And tickets for other theatres did not\nseem to come unnaturally for a night or two. But her spirit had\nmilitated against the hat and the habit and the horse. The whip was a\nlittle present from Emily Dunstable, and that of course was accepted\nwith a good grace. Then there came the horse,--as though from the\nheavens; there seemed to be ten horses, twenty horses, if anybody\nneeded them. All these things seemed to flow naturally into Mrs.\nThorne's establishment, like air through the windows. It was very\npleasant, but Lily hesitated when she was told that a habit was to\nbe given to her. \"My dear old aunt insists,\" said Emily Dunstable.\n\"Nobody ever thinks of refusing anything from her. If you only knew\nwhat some people will take, and some people will even ask, who have\nnothing to do with her at all!\" \"But I have nothing to do with\nher,--in that way I mean,\" said Lily. \"Oh, yes, you have,\" said\nEmily. \"You and Bernard are as good as brother and sister, and\nBernard and I are as good as man and wife, and my aunt and I are as\ngood as mother and daughter. So you see, in a sort of a way you are\na child of the house.\" So Lily accepted the habit; but made a stand\nat the hat, and paid for that out of her own pocket. When the squire\nhad seen Lily on horseback he asked her questions about it. \"It\nwas a hired horse, I suppose?\" he said. \"I think it came direct\nfrom heaven,\" said Lily. \"What do you mean, Lily?\" said the squire,\nangrily. \"I mean that when people are so rich and good-natured as\nMrs. Thorne it is no good inquiring where things come from. All that\nI know is that the horses come out of Potts' livery-stable. They\ntalk of Potts as if he were a good-natured man who provides horses\nfor the world without troubling anybody.\" Then the squire spoke to\nBernard about it, saying that he should insist on defraying his\nniece's expenses. But Bernard swore that he could give his uncle no\nassistance. \"I would not speak to her about such a thing for all the\nworld,\" said Bernard. \"Then I shall,\" said the squire.\n\nIn those days Lily thought much of Johnny Eames,--gave to him perhaps\nmore of that thought which leads to love than she had ever given\nhim before. She still heard the Crawley question discussed every\nday. Mrs. Thorne, as we all know, was at this time a Barsetshire\npersonage, and was of course interested in Barsetshire subjects; and\nshe was specially anxious in the matter, having strong hopes with\nreference to the marriage of Major Grantly and Grace, and strong\nhopes also that Grace's father might escape the fangs of justice. The\nCrawley case was constantly in Lily's ears, and as constantly she\nheard high praise awarded to Johnny for his kindness in going after\nthe Arabins. \"He must be a fine young fellow,\" said Mrs. Thorne, \"and\nwe'll have him down at Chaldicotes some day. Old Lord De Guest found\nhim out and made a friend of him, and old Lord De Guest was no fool.\"\nLily was not altogether free from a suspicion that Mrs. Thorne knew\nthe story of Johnny's love and was trying to serve Johnny,--as other\npeople had tried to do, very ineffectually. When this suspicion came\nupon her she would shut her heart against her lover's praises, and\nswear that she would stand by those two letters which she had written\nin her book at home. But the suspicion would not be always there, and\nthere did come upon her a conviction that her lover was more esteemed\namong men and women than she had been accustomed to believe. Her\ncousin, Bernard Dale, who certainly was regarded in the world as\nsomebody, spoke of him as his equal; whereas in former days Bernard\nhad always regarded Johnny Eames as standing low in the world's\nregard. Then Lily, when alone, would remember a certain comparison\nwhich she once made between Adolphus Crosbie and John Eames, when\nneither of the men had as yet pleaded his cause to her, and which had\nbeen very much in favour of the former. She had then declared that\nJohnny was a \"mere clerk.\" She had a higher opinion of him now,--a\nmuch higher opinion, even though he could never be more to her than a\nfriend.\n\nIn these days Lily's new ally, Emily Dunstable, seemed to Lily to be\nso happy! There was in Emily a complete realization of that idea of\nante-nuptial blessedness of which Lily had often thought so much.\nWhatever Emily did she did for Bernard; and, to give Captain Dale his\ndue, he received all the sweets which were showered upon him with\nbecoming signs of gratitude. I suppose it is always the case at such\ntimes that the girl has the best of it, and on this occasion Emily\nDunstable certainly made the most of her happiness. \"I do envy you,\"\nLily said one day. The acknowledgment seemed to have been extorted\nfrom her involuntarily. She did not laugh as she spoke, or follow up\nwhat she had said with other words intended to take away the joke\nof what she had uttered,--had it been a joke; but she sat silent,\nlooking at the girl who was re-arranging flowers which Bernard had\nbrought to her.\n\n\"I can't give him up to you, you know,\" said Emily.\n\n\"I don't envy you him, but 'it,'\" said Lily.\n\n\"Then go and get an 'it' for yourself. Why don't you have an 'it' for\nyourself? You can have an 'it' to-morrow, if you like,--or two or\nthree, if all that I hear is true.\"\n\n\"No, I can't,\" said Lily. \"Things have gone wrong with me. Don't ask\nme anything more about it. Pray don't. I shan't speak of it if you\ndo.\"\n\n\"Of course I will not if you tell me I must not.\"\n\n\"I do tell you so. I have been a fool to say anything about it.\nHowever, I have got over my envy now, and am ready to go out with\nyour aunt. Here she is.\"\n\n\"Things have gone wrong with me.\" She repeated the same words to\nherself over and over again. With all the efforts which she had made\nshe could not quite reconcile herself to the two letters which she\nhad written in the book. This coming up to London, and riding in the\nPark, and going to the theatres, seemed to unsettle her. At home she\nhad schooled herself down into quiescence, and made herself think\nthat she believed that she was satisfied with the prospects of her\nlife. But now she was all astray again, doubting about herself,\nhankering after something over and beyond that which seemed to be\nallotted to her,--but, nevertheless, assuring herself that she never\nwould accept of anything else.\n\nI must not, if I can help it, let the reader suppose that she was\nsoftening her heart to John Eames because John Eames was spoken well\nof in the world. But with all of us, in the opinion which we form\nof those around us, we take unconsciously the opinion of others. A\nwoman is handsome because the world says so. Music is charming to\nus because it charms others. We drink our wines with other men's\npalates, and look at our pictures with other men's eyes. When Lily\nheard John Eames praised by all around her, it could not be but that\nshe should praise him too,--not out loud, as others did, but in the\nsilence of her heart. And then his constancy to her had been so\nperfect! If that other one had never come! If it could be that she\nmight begin again, and that she might be spared that episode in her\nlife which had brought him and her together!\n\n\"When is Mr. Eames going to be back?\" Mrs. Thorne said at dinner one\nday. On this occasion the squire was dining at Mrs. Thorne's house;\nand there were three or four others there,--among them a Mr. Harold\nSmith, who was in Parliament, and his wife, and John Eames's especial\nfriend, Sir Raffle Buffle. The question was addressed to the squire,\nbut the squire was slow to answer, and it was taken up by Sir Raffle\nBuffle.\n\n\"He'll be back on the 15th,\" said the knight, \"unless he means to\nplay truant. I hope he won't do that, as his absence has been a\nterrible inconvenience to me.\" Then Sir Raffle explained that John\nEames was his private secretary, and that Johnny's journey to the\nContinent had been made with, and could not have been made without,\nhis sanction. \"When I came to hear the story, of course I told him\nthat he must go. 'Eames,' I said, 'take the advice of a man who knows\nthe world. Circumstanced as you are, you are bound to go.' And he\nwent.\"\n\n\"Upon my word that was very good-natured of you,\" said Mrs. Thorne.\n\n\"I never keep a fellow to his desk who has really got important\nbusiness elsewhere,\" said Sir Raffle. \"The country, I say, can afford\nto do as much as that for her servants. But then I like to know that\nthe business is business. One doesn't choose to be humbugged.\"\n\n\"I daresay you are humbugged, as you call it, very often,\" said\nHarold Smith.\n\n\"Perhaps so; perhaps I am; perhaps that is the opinion which they\nhave of me at the Treasury. But you were hardly long enough there,\nSmith, to have learned much about it, I should say.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose I should have known much about it, as you call it,\nif I had stayed till Doomsday.\"\n\n\"I daresay not; I daresay not. Men who begin as late as you did never\nknow what official life really means. Now I've been at it all my\nlife, and I think I do understand it.\"\n\n\"It's not a profession I should like unless where it's joined with\npolitics,\" said Harold Smith.\n\n\"But then it's apt to be so short,\" said Sir Raffle Buffle. Now it\nhad happened once in the life of Mr. Harold Smith that he had been\nin a Ministry, but, unfortunately, that Ministry had gone out almost\nwithin a week of the time of Mr. Smith's adhesion. Sir Raffle and Mr.\nSmith had known each other for many years, and were accustomed to\nmake civil little speeches to each other in society.\n\n\"I'd sooner be a horse in a mill than have to go to an office every\nday,\" said Mrs. Smith, coming to her husband's assistance. \"You, Sir\nRaffle, have kept yourself fresh and pleasant through it all; but who\nbesides you ever did?\"\n\n\"I hope I am fresh,\" said Sir Raffle; \"and as for pleasantness, I\nwill leave that for you to determine.\"\n\n\"There can be but one opinion,\" said Mrs. Thorne.\n\nThe conversation had strayed away from John Eames, and Lily was\ndisappointed. It was a pleasure to her when people talked of him\nin her hearing, and as a question or two had been asked about him,\nmaking him the hero of the moment, it seemed to her that he was\nbeing robbed of his due when the little amenities between Mr. and\nMrs. Harold Smith and Sir Raffle banished his name from the circle.\nNothing more, however, was said of him at dinner, and I fear that he\nwould have been altogether forgotten throughout the evening, had not\nLily herself referred,--not to him, which she could not possibly have\nbeen induced to do,--but to the subject of his journey. \"I wonder\nwhether poor Mr. Crawley will be found guilty?\" she said to Sir\nRaffle up in the drawing-room.\n\n\"I am afraid he will; I am afraid he will,\" said Sir Raffle; \"and I\nfear, my dear Miss Dale, that I must go further than that. I fear I\nmust express an opinion that he is guilty.\"\n\n\"Nothing will ever make me think so,\" said Lily.\n\n\"Ladies are always tender-hearted,\" said Sir Raffle, \"and especially\nyoung ladies,--and especially pretty young ladies. I do not wonder\nthat such should be your opinion. But you see, Miss Dale, a man of\nbusiness has to look at these things in a business light. What I want\nto know is, where did he get the cheque? He is bound to be explicit\nin answering that before anybody can acquit him.\"\n\n\"That is just what Mr. Eames has gone abroad to learn.\"\n\n\"It is very well for Eames to go abroad,--though, upon my word, I\ndon't know whether I should not have given him different advice if\nI had known how much I was to be tormented by his absence. The thing\ncouldn't have happened at a more unfortunate time;--the Ministry\ngoing out, and everything. But, as I was saying, it is all very well\nfor him to do what he can. He is related to them, and is bound to\nsave the honour of his relations if it be possible. I like him for\ngoing. I always liked him. As I said to my friend De Guest, 'That\nyoung man will make his way.' And I rather fancy that the chance word\nwhich I spoke then to my valued old friend was not thrown away in\nEames's favour. But, my dear Miss Dale, where did Mr. Crawley get\nthat cheque? That's what I want to know. If you can tell me that,\nthen I can tell you whether or no he will be acquitted.\"\n\nLily did not feel a strong prepossession in favour of Sir Raffle, in\nspite of his praise of John Eames. The harsh voice of the man annoyed\nher, and his egotism offended her. When, much later in the evening,\nhis character came on for discussion between herself and Mrs. Thorne\nand Emily Dunstable, she had not a word to say in his favour. But\nstill she had been pleased to meet him, because he was the man with\nwhom Johnny's life was most specially concerned. I think that a\nportion of her dislike to him arose from the fact that in continuing\nthe conversation he did not revert to his private secretary, but\npreferred to regale her with stories of his own doings in wonderful\ncases which had partaken of interest similar to that which now\nattached itself to Mr. Crawley's case. He had known a man who had\nstolen a hundred pounds, and had never been found out; and another\nman who had been arrested for stealing two-and-sixpence which was\nfound afterwards sticking to a bit of butter at the bottom of a\nplate. Mrs. Thorne had heard all this, and had answered him, \"Dear\nme, Sir Raffle,\" she had said, \"what a great many thieves you have\nhad among your acquaintance!\" This had rather disconcerted him, and\nthen there had been no more talking about Mr. Crawley.\n\nIt had been arranged on this morning that Mr. Dale should return to\nAllington and leave Lily with Mrs. Thorne. Some special need of his\npresence at home, real or assumed, had arisen, and he had declared\nthat he must shorten his stay in London by about half the intended\nperiod. The need would not have been so pressing, probably, had he\nnot felt that Lily would be more comfortable with Mrs. Thorne than\nin his lodgings in Sackville Street. Lily had at first declared that\nshe would return with him, but everybody had protested against this.\nEmily Dunstable had protested against it very stoutly; Mrs. Dale\nherself had protested against it by letter; and Mrs. Thorne's protest\nhad been quite imperious in its nature. \"Indeed, my dear, you'll do\nnothing of the kind. I'm sure your mother wouldn't wish it. I look\nupon it as quite essential that you and Emily should learn to know\neach other.\" \"But we do know each other; don't we, Emily?\" said Lily.\n\"Not quite well yet,\" said Emily. Then Lily had laughed, and so the\nmatter was settled. And now, on this present occasion, Mr. Dale was\nat Mrs. Thorne's house for the last time. His conscience had been\nperplexed about Lily's horse, and if anything was to be said it must\nbe said now. The subject was very disagreeable to him, and he was\nangry with Bernard because Bernard had declined to manage it for him\nafter his own fashion. But he had told himself so often that anything\nwas better than a pecuniary obligation, that he was determined to\nspeak his mind to Mrs. Thorne, and to beg her to allow him to have\nhis way. So he waited till the Harold Smiths were gone, and Sir\nRaffle Buffle, and then, when Lily was apart with Emily,--for Bernard\nDale had left them,--he found himself at last alone with Mrs. Thorne.\n\n\"I can't be too much obliged to you,\" he said, \"for your kindness to\nmy girl.\"\n\n\"Oh, laws, that's nothing,\" said Mrs. Thorne. \"We look on her as one\nof us now.\"\n\n\"I'm sure she is grateful,--very grateful; and so am I. She and\nBernard have been brought up so much together that it is very\ndesirable that she should be not unknown to Bernard's wife.\"\n\n\"Exactly,--that's just what I mean. Blood's thicker than water; isn't\nit? Emily's child, if she has one, will be Lily's cousin.\"\n\n\"Her first-cousin once removed,\" said the squire, who was accurate\nin these matters. Then he drew himself up in his seat and compressed\nhis lips together, and prepared himself for his task. It was very\ndisagreeable. Nothing, he thought, could be more disagreeable. \"I\nhave a little thing to speak about,\" he said at last, \"which I hope\nwill not offend you.\"\n\n\"About Lily?\"\n\n\"Yes; about Lily.\"\n\n\"I'm not very easily offended, and I don't know how I could possibly\nbe offended about her.\"\n\n\"I'm an old-fashioned man, Mrs. Thorne, and don't know much about the\nways of the world. I have always been down in the country, and maybe\nI have prejudices. You won't refuse to humour one of them, I hope?\"\n\n\"You're beginning to frighten me, Mr. Dale; what is it?\"\n\n\"About Lily's horse.\"\n\n\"Lily's horse! What about her horse? I hope he's not vicious?\"\n\n\"She is riding every day with your niece,\" said the squire, thinking\nit best to stick to his own point.\n\n\"It will do her all the good in the world,\" said Mrs. Thorne.\n\n\"Very likely. I don't doubt it. I do not in the least disapprove her\nriding. But--\"\n\n\"But what, Mr. Dale?\"\n\n\"I should be so much obliged if I might be allowed to pay the\nlivery-stable keeper's bill.\"\n\n\"Oh, laws a' mercy.\"\n\n\"I daresay it may sound odd, but as I have a fancy about it, I'm sure\nyou'll gratify me.\"\n\n\"Of course I will. I'll remember it. I'll make it all right with\nBernard. Bernard and I have no end of accounts,--or shall have before\nlong,--and we'll make an item of it. Then you can arrange with\nBernard afterwards.\"\n\nMr. Dale as he got up to go away felt that he was beaten, but he did\nnot know how to carry the battle any further on that occasion. He\ncould not take out his purse and put down the cost of the horse on\nthe table. \"I will then speak to my nephew about it,\" he said, very\ngravely, as he went away. And he did speak to his nephew about it,\nand even wrote to him more than once. But it was all to no purpose.\nMr. Potts could not be induced to give a separate bill, and,--so said\nBernard,--swore at last that he would furnish no account to anybody\nfor horses that went to Mrs. Thorne's door except to Mrs. Thorne\nherself.\n\nThat night Lily took leave of her uncle and remained at Mrs. Thorne's\nhouse. As things were now arranged she would, no doubt, be in London\nwhen John Eames returned. If he should find her in town--and she told\nherself that if she was in town he certainly would find her,--he\nwould, doubtless, repeat to her the offer he had so often made\nbefore. She never ventured to tell herself that she doubted as to\nthe answer to be made to him. The two letters were written in the\nbook, and must remain there. But she felt that she would have had\nmore courage for persistency down at Allington than she would be able\nto summon to her assistance up in London. She knew she would be weak,\nshould she be found by him alone in Mrs. Thorne's drawing-room. It\nwould be better for her to make some excuse and go home. She was\nresolved that she would not become his wife. She could not extricate\nherself from the dominion of a feeling which she believed to be love\nfor another man. She had given a solemn promise both to her mother\nand to John Eames that she would not marry that other man; but in\ndoing so she had made a solemn promise to herself that she would\nnot marry John Eames. She had sworn it and would keep her oath. And\nyet she regretted it! In writing home to her mother the next day,\nshe told Mrs. Dale that all the world was speaking well of John\nEames,--that John had won for himself a reputation of his own, and\nwas known far and wide to be a noble fellow. She could not keep\nherself from praising John Eames, though she knew that such praise\nmight, and would, be used against her at some future time. \"Though\nI cannot love him I will give him his due,\" she said to herself.\n\n\"I wish you would make up your mind to have an 'it' for yourself,\"\nEmily Dunstable said to her again that night; \"a nice 'it,' so that I\ncould make a friend, perhaps a brother, of him.\"\n\n\"I shall never have an 'it,' if I live to be a hundred,\" said Lily\nDale.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nROTTEN ROW.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nLily had heard nothing as to the difficulty about her horse, and\ncould therefore enjoy her exercise without the drawback of feeling\nthat her uncle was subjected to an annoyance. She was in the habit of\ngoing out every day with Bernard and Emily Dunstable, and their party\nwas generally joined by others who would meet them at Mrs. Thorne's\nhouse. For Mrs. Thorne was a very hospitable woman, and there\nwere many who liked well enough to go to her house. Late in the\nafternoon there would be a great congregation of horses before the\ndoor,--sometimes as many as a dozen; and then the cavalcade would go\noff into the Park, and there it would become scattered. As neither\nBernard nor Miss Dunstable were unconscionable lovers, Lily in these\nscatterings did not often find herself neglected or lost. Her cousin\nwould generally remain with her, and as in those days she had no \"it\"\nof her own she was well pleased that he should do so.\n\nBut it so happened that on a certain afternoon she found herself\nriding in Rotten Row alone with a certain stout gentleman whom she\nconstantly met at Mrs. Thorne's house. His name was Onesiphorus Dunn,\nand he was usually called Siph by his intimate friends. It had seemed\nto Lily that everybody was an intimate friend of Mr. Dunn's, and she\nwas in daily fear lest she should make a mistake and call him Siph\nherself. Had she done so it would not have mattered in the least. Mr.\nDunn, had he observed it at all, would neither have been flattered\nnor angry. A great many young ladies about London did call him Siph,\nand to him it was quite natural that they should do so. He was\nan Irishman, living on the best of everything in the world, with\napparently no fortune of his own, and certainly never earning\nanything. Everybody liked him, and it was admitted on all sides that\nthere was no safer friend in the world, either for young ladies or\nyoung men, than Mr. Onesiphorus Dunn. He did not borrow money, and he\ndid not encroach. He did like being asked out to dinner, and he did\nthink that they to whom he gave the light of his countenance in town\nowed him the return of a week's run in the country. He neither shot,\nnor hunted nor fished, nor read, and yet he was never in the way in\nany house. He did play billiards, and whist, and croquet--very badly.\nHe was a good judge of wine, and would occasionally condescend to\nlook after the bottling of it on behalf of some very intimate friend.\nHe was a great friend of Mrs. Thorne's, with whom he always spent ten\ndays in the autumn at Chaldicotes.\n\nBernard and Emily were not insatiable lovers, but, nevertheless,\nMrs. Thorne had thought it proper to provide a fourth in the\nriding-parties, and had put Mr. Dunn upon this duty. \"Don't bother\nyourself about it, Siph,\" she had said; \"only if those lovers should\ngo off philandering out of sight, our little country lassie might\nfind herself to be nowhere in the Park.\" Siph had promised to make\nhimself useful, and had done so. There had generally been so large a\nnumber in their party that the work imposed on Mr. Dunn had been very\nlight. Lily had never found out that he had been especially consigned\nto her as her own cavalier, but had seen quite enough of him to be\naware that he was a pleasant companion. To her, thinking, as she ever\nwas thinking, about Johnny Eames, Siph was much more agreeable than\nmight have been a younger man who would have endeavoured to make her\nthink about himself.\n\nThus when she found herself riding alone in Rotten Row with Siph\nDunn, she was neither disconcerted nor displeased. He had been\ntalking to her about Lord De Guest, whom he had known,--for Siph knew\neverybody,--and Lily had begun to wonder whether he knew John Eames.\nShe would have liked to hear the opinion of such a man about John\nEames. She was making up her mind that she would say something about\nthe Crawley matter,--not intending of course to mention John Eames's\nname,--when suddenly her tongue was paralyzed and she could not\nspeak. At that moment they were standing near a corner, where a\nturning path made an angle in the iron rails, Mr. Dunn having\nproposed that they should wait there for a few minutes before they\nreturned home, as it was probable that Bernard and Miss Dunstable\nmight come up. They had been there for some five or ten minutes, and\nLily had asked her first question about the Crawleys,--inquiring of\nMr. Dunn whether he had heard of a terrible accusation which had\nbeen made against a clergyman in Barsetshire,--when on a sudden her\ntongue was paralyzed. As they were standing, Lily's horse was turned\ntowards the diverging path, whereas Mr. Dunn was looking the other\nway, towards Achilles and Apsley house. Mr. Dunn was nearer to the\nrailings, but though they were thus looking different ways they\nwere so placed that each could see the face of the other. Then, on\na sudden, coming slowly towards her along the diverging path and\nleaning on the arm of another man, she saw,--Adolphus Crosbie.\n\nShe had never seen him since a day on which she had parted from him\nwith many kisses,--with warm, pressing, eager kisses,--of which\nshe had been nowhat ashamed. He had then been to her almost as her\nhusband. She had trusted him entirely, and had thrown herself into\nhis arms with a full reliance. There is often much of reticence on\nthe part of a woman towards a man to whom she is engaged, something\nalso of shamefacedness occasionally. There exists a shadow of doubt,\nat least of that hesitation which shows that in spite of vows the\nwoman knows that a change may come, and that provision for such\npossible steps backward should always be within her reach. But Lily\nhad cast all such caution to the winds. She had given herself to\nthe man entirely, and had determined that she would sink or swim,\nstand or fall, live or die, by him and by his truth. He had been as\nfalse as hell. She had been in his arms, clinging to him, kissing\nhim, swearing that her only pleasure in the world was to be with\nhim,--with him her treasure, her promised husband; and within a\nmonth, a week, he had been false to her. There had come upon her\ncrushing tidings, and she had for days wondered at herself that they\nhad not killed her. But she had lived, and had forgiven him. She had\nstill loved him, and had received new offers from him, which had been\nanswered as the reader knows. But she had never seen him since the\nday on which she had parted from him at Allington, without a doubt as\nto his faith. Now he was before her, walking on the footpath, almost\nwithin reach of her whip.\n\nHe did not recognize her, but as he passed on he did recognize Mr.\nOnesiphorus Dunn, and stopped to speak to him. Or it might have\nbeen that Crosbie's friend Fowler Pratt stopped with this special\nobject,--for Siph Dunn was an intimate friend of Fowler Pratt's.\nCrosbie and Siph were also acquainted, but in those days Crosbie did\nnot care much for stopping his friends in the Park or elsewhere. He\nhad become moody and discontented, and was generally seen going about\nthe world alone. On this special occasion he was having a little\nspecial conversation about money with his very old friend Fowler\nPratt.\n\n\"What, Siph, is this you? You're always on horseback now,\" said\nFowler Pratt.\n\n\"Well, yes; I have gone in a good deal for cavalry work this last\nmonth. I've been lucky enough to have a young lady to ride with me.\"\nThis he said in a whisper, which the distance of Lily justified. \"How\nd'ye do, Crosbie? One doesn't often see you on horseback, or on foot\neither.\"\n\n\"I've something to do besides going to look or to be looked at,\"\nsaid Crosbie. Then he raised his eyes and saw Lily's side-face, and\nrecognized her. Had he seen her before he had been stopped on his way\nI think he would have passed on, endeavouring to escape observation.\nBut as it was, his feet had been arrested before he knew of her close\nvicinity, and now it would seem that he was afraid of her, and was\nflying from her, were he at once to walk off, leaving his friend\nbehind him. And he knew that she had seen him, and had recognized\nhim, and was now suffering from his presence. He could not but\nperceive that it was so from the fixedness of her face, and from the\nconstrained manner in which she gazed before her. His friend Fowler\nPratt had never seen Miss Dale, though he knew very much of her\nhistory. Siph Dunn knew nothing of the history of Crosbie and his\nlove, and was unaware that he and Lily had ever seen each other.\nThere was thus no help near her to extricate her from her difficulty.\n\n\"When a man has any work to do in the world,\" said Siph, \"he always\nboasts of it to his acquaintance, and curses his luck to himself. I\nhave nothing to do and can go about to see and to be seen;--and I\nmust own that I like it.\"\n\n\"Especially the being seen,--eh, Siph?\" said Fowler Pratt. \"I also\nhave nothing on earth to do, and I come here every day because it is\nas easy to do that as to go anywhere else.\"\n\nCrosbie was still looking at Lily. He could not help himself. He\ncould not take his eyes from off her. He could see that she was as\npretty as ever, that she was but very little altered. She was, in\ntruth, somewhat stouter than in the old days, but of that he took no\nspecial notice. Should he speak to her? Should he try to catch her\neye, and then raise his hat? Should he go up to her horse's head\nboldly, and ask her to let bygones be bygones? He had an idea that of\nall courses which he could pursue that was the one which she would\napprove the best,--which would be most efficacious for him, if with\nher anything from him might have any efficacy. But he could not do\nit. He did not know what words he might best use. Would it become him\nhumbly to sue to her for pardon? Or should he strive to express his\nunaltered love by some tone of his voice? Or should he simply ask\nher after her health? He made one step towards her, and he saw that\nthe face became more rigid and more fixed than before, and then he\ndesisted. He told himself that he was simply hateful to her. He\nthought that he could perceive that there was no tenderness mixed\nwith her unabated anger.\n\nAt this moment Bernard Dale and Emily came close upon him, and\nBernard saw him at once. It was through Bernard that Lily and Crosbie\nhad come to know each other. He and Bernard Dale had been fast\nfriends in old times, and had, of course, been bitter enemies since\nthe day of Crosbie's treachery. They had never spoken since, though\nthey had often seen each other, and Dale was not at all disposed to\nspeak to him now. The moment that he recognized Crosbie he looked\nacross to his cousin. For an instant, an idea had flashed across\nhim that he was there by her permission,--with her assent; but it\nrequired no second glance to show him that this was not the case.\n\"Dunn,\" he said, \"I think we will ride on,\" and he put his horse into\na trot. Siph, whose ear was very accurate, and who knew at once that\nsomething was wrong, trotted on with him, and Lily, of course, was\nnot left behind. \"Is there anything the matter?\" said Emily to her\nlover.\n\n\"Nothing specially the matter,\" he replied; \"but you were standing in\ncompany with the greatest blackguard that ever lived, and I thought\nwe had better change our ground.\"\n\n\"Bernard!\" said Lily, flashing on him with all the fire which her\neyes could command. Then she remembered that she could not reprimand\nhim for the offence of such abuse in such a company; so she reined in\nher horse and fell a-weeping.\n\nSiph Dunn, with his wicked cleverness, knew the whole story at once,\nremembering that he had once heard something of Crosbie having\nbehaved very ill to some one before he married Lady Alexandrina De\nCourcy. He stopped his horse also, falling a little behind Lily,\nso that he might not be supposed to have seen her tears, and began\nto hum a tune. Emily also, though not wickedly clever, understood\nsomething of it. \"If Bernard says anything to make you angry, I will\nscold him,\" she said. Then the two girls rode on together in front,\nwhile Bernard fell back with Siph Dunn.\n\n\"Pratt,\" said Crosbie, putting his hand on his friend's shoulder as\nsoon as the party had ridden out of hearing, \"do you see that girl\nthere in the dark blue habit?\"\n\n\"What, the one nearest to the path?\"\n\n\"Yes; the one nearest to the path. That is Lily Dale.\"\n\n\"Lily Dale!\" said Fowler Pratt.\n\n\"Yes; that is Lily Dale.\"\n\n\"Did you speak to her?\" Pratt asked.\n\n\"No; she gave me no chance. She was there but a moment. But it was\nherself. It seems so odd to me that I should have been thus so near\nher again.\" If there was any man to whom Crosbie could have spoken\nfreely about Lily Dale it was this man, Fowler Pratt. Pratt was the\noldest friend he had in the world, and it had happened that when he\nfirst woke to the misery that he had prepared for himself in throwing\nover Lily and betrothing himself to his late wife, Pratt had been the\nfirst person to whom he had communicated his sorrow. Not that he had\never been really open in his communications. It is not given to such\nmen as Crosbie to speak openly of themselves to their friends. Nor,\nindeed, was Fowler Pratt one who was fond of listening to such tales.\nHe had no such tales to tell of himself, and he thought that men and\nwomen should go through the world quietly, not subjecting themselves\nor their acquaintances to anxieties and emotions from peculiar\nconduct. But he was conscientious, and courageous also as well as\nprudent, and he had dared to tell Crosbie that he was behaving very\nbadly. He had spoken his mind plainly, and had then given all the\nassistance in his power.\n\nHe paused a moment before he replied, weighing, like a prudent man,\nthe force of the words he was about to utter. \"It is much better as\nit is,\" he said. \"It is much better that you should be as strangers\nfor the future.\"\n\n\"I do not see that at all,\" said Crosbie. They were both leaning on\nthe rails, and so they remained for the next twenty minutes. \"I do\nnot see that at all.\"\n\n\"I feel sure of it. What could come of any renewed intercourse,--even\nif she would allow it?\"\n\n\"I might make her my wife.\"\n\n\"And do you think that you would be happy with her, or she with you,\nafter what has passed?\"\n\n\"I do think so.\"\n\n\"I do not. It might be possible that she should bring herself\nto marry you. Women delight to forgive injuries. They like the\nexcitement of generosity. But she could never forget that you had had\na former wife, or the circumstances under which you were married. And\nas for yourself, you would regret it after the first month. How could\nyou ever speak to her of your love without speaking also of your\nshame? If a man does marry he should at least be able to hold up his\nhead before his wife.\"\n\nThis was very severe, but Crosbie showed no anger. \"I think I should\ndo so,\" he said,--\"after a while.\"\n\n\"And then, about money? Of course you would have to tell her\neverything.\"\n\n\"Everything--of course.\"\n\n\"It is like enough that she might not regard that,--except that she\nwould feel that if you could not afford to marry her when you were\nunembarrassed, you can hardly afford to do so when you are over head\nand ears in debt.\"\n\n\"She has money now.\"\n\n\"After all that has come and gone you would hardly seek Lily Dale\nbecause you want to marry a fortune.\"\n\n\"You are too hard on me, Pratt. You know that my only reason for\nseeking her is that I love her.\"\n\n\"I do not mean to be hard. But I have a very strong opinion that the\nquarrels of lovers, when they are of so very serious a nature, are\na bad basis for the renewal of love. Come, let us go and dress for\ndinner. I am going to dine with Mrs. Thorne, the millionaire, who\nmarried a country doctor, and who used to be called Miss Dunstable.\"\n\n\"I never dine out anywhere now,\" said Crosbie. And then they walked\nout of the Park together. Neither of them, of course, knew that Lily\nDale was staying at the house at which Fowler Pratt was going to\ndine.\n\nLily, as she rode home, did not speak a word. She would have given\nworlds to be able to talk, but she could not even make a beginning.\nShe heard Bernard and Siph Dunn chatting behind her, and hoped that\nthey would continue to do so till she was safe within the house. They\nall used her well, for no one tried to draw her into conversation.\nOnce Emily said to her, \"Shall we trot a little, Lily?\" And then they\nhad moved on quickly, and the misery was soon over. As soon as she\nwas upstairs in the house, she got Emily by herself, and explained\nall the mystery in a word or two. \"I fear I have made a fool of\nmyself. That was the man to whom I was once engaged.\" \"What, Mr.\nCrosbie?\" said Emily, who had heard the whole story from Bernard.\n\"Yes, Mr. Crosbie; pray, do not say a word of it to anybody,--not\neven to your aunt. I am better now, but I was such a fool. No, dear;\nI won't go into the drawing-room. I'll go upstairs, and come down\nready for dinner.\"\n\nWhen she was alone she sat down in her habit, and declared to herself\nthat she certainly would never become the wife of Mr. Crosbie. I do\nnot know why she should make such a declaration. She had promised\nher mother and John Eames that she would not do so, and that promise\nwould certainly have bound her without any further resolutions on\nher own part. But, to tell the truth, the vision of the man had\ndisenchanted her. When last she had seen him he had been as it were a\ngod to her; and though, since that day, his conduct to her had been\nas ungodlike as it well might be, still the memory of the outward\nsigns of his divinity had remained with her. It is difficult to\nexplain how it had come to pass that the glimpse which she had had\nof him should have altered so much within her mind;--why she should\nso suddenly have come to regard him in an altered light. It was not\nsimply that he looked to be older, and because his face was careworn.\nIt was not only that he had lost that look of an Apollo which Lily\nhad once in her mirth attributed to him. I think it was chiefly that\nshe herself was older, and could no longer see a god in such a man.\nShe had never regarded John Eames as being gifted with divinity, and\nhad therefore always been making comparisons to his discredit. Any\nsuch comparison now would tend quite the other way. Nevertheless\nshe would adhere to the two letters in her book. Since she had seen\nMr. Crosbie she was altogether out of love with the prospect of\nmatrimony.\n\nShe was in the room when Mr. Pratt was announced, and she at once\nrecognized him as the man who had been with Crosbie. And when, some\nminutes afterwards, Siph Dunn came into the room, she could see that\nin their greeting allusion was made to the scene in the Park. But\nstill it was probable that this man would not recognize her, and, if\nhe did so, what would it matter? There were twenty people to sit down\nto dinner, and the chances were that she would not be called upon to\nexchange a word with Mr. Pratt. She had now recovered herself, and\ncould speak freely to her friend Siph, and when Siph came and stood\nnear her she thanked him graciously for his escort in the Park. \"If\nit wasn't for you, Mr. Dunn, I really think I should not get any\nriding at all. Bernard and Miss Dunstable have only one thing to\nthink about, and certainly I am not that one thing.\" She thought it\nprobable that if she could keep Siph close to her, Mrs. Thorne, who\nalways managed those things herself, might apportion her out to be\nled to dinner by her good-natured friend. But the fates were averse.\nThe time had now come, and Lily was waiting her turn. \"Mr. Fowler\nPratt, let me introduce you to Miss Lily Dale,\" said Mrs. Thorne.\nLily could perceive that Mr. Pratt was startled. The sign he gave was\nthe least possible sign in the world; but still it sufficed for Lily\nto perceive it. She put her hand upon his arm, and walked down with\nhim to the dining-room without giving him the slightest cause to\nsuppose that she knew who he was.\n\n\"I think I saw you in the Park riding?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, I was there; we go nearly every day.\"\n\n\"I never ride; I was walking.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that the people don't go there to walk, but to stand\nstill,\" said Lily. \"I cannot understand how so many people can bear\nto loiter about in that way--leaning on the rails and doing nothing.\"\n\n\"It is about as good as the riding, and costs less money. That is all\nthat can be said for it. Do you live chiefly in town?\"\n\n\"O dear, no; I live altogether in the country. I'm only up here\nbecause a cousin is going to be married.\"\n\n\"Captain Dale you mean--to Miss Dunstable?\" said Fowler Pratt.\n\n\"When they have been joined together in holy matrimony, I shall go\ndown to the country, and never, I suppose, come up to London again.\"\n\n\"You do not like London?\"\n\n\"Not as a residence, I think,\" said Lily. \"But of course one's\nlikings and dislikings on such a matter depend on circumstances. I\nlive with my mother, and all my relatives live near us. Of course I\nlike the country best, because they are there.\"\n\n\"Young ladies so often have a different way of looking at this\nsubject. I shouldn't wonder if Miss Dunstable's views about it were\naltogether of another sort. Young ladies generally expect to be taken\naway from their fathers and mothers, and uncles and aunts.\"\n\n\"But you see I expect to be left with mine,\" said Lily. After that\nshe turned as much away from Mr. Fowler Pratt as she could, having\ntaken an aversion to him. What business had he to talk to her about\nbeing taken away from her uncles and aunts? She had seen him with Mr.\nCrosbie, and it might be possible that they were intimate friends.\nIt might be that Mr. Pratt was asking questions in Mr. Crosbie's\ninterest. Let that be as it might, she would answer no more questions\nfrom him further than ordinary good breeding should require of her.\n\n\"She is a nice girl, certainly,\" said Fowler Pratt to himself, as\nhe walked home, \"and I have no doubt would make a good, ordinary,\neveryday wife. But she is not such a paragon that a man should\ncondescend to grovel in the dirt for her.\"\n\nThat night Lily told Emily Dunstable the whole of Mr. Crosbie's\nhistory as far as she knew it, and also explained her new aversion to\nMr. Fowler Pratt. \"They are very great friends,\" said Emily. \"Bernard\nhas told me so; and you may be sure that Mr. Pratt knew the whole\nhistory before he came here. I am so sorry that my aunt asked him.\"\n\n\"It does not signify in the least,\" said Lily. \"Even if I were to\nmeet Mr. Crosbie I don't think I should make such a fool of myself\nagain. As it is, I can only hope he did not see it.\"\n\n\"I am sure he did not.\"\n\nThen there was a pause, during which Lily sat with her face resting\non both her hands. \"It is wonderful how much he is altered,\" she said\nat last.\n\n\"Think how much he has suffered.\"\n\n\"I suppose I am altered as much, only I do not see it in myself.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you were, but I don't think you can have changed\nmuch. You no doubt have suffered too, but not as he has done.\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that, I have done very well. I think I'll go to bed now.\nThe riding makes me so sleepy.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nTHE CLERICAL COMMISSION.\n\n\nIt was at last arranged that the five clergymen selected should meet\nat Dr. Tempest's house in Silverbridge to make inquiry and report to\nthe bishop whether the circumstances connected with the cheque for\ntwenty pounds were of such a nature as to make it incumbent on him\nto institute proceedings against Mr. Crawley in the Court of Arches.\nDr. Tempest had acted upon the letter which he had received from the\nbishop, exactly as though there had been no meeting at the palace, no\nquarrel to the death between him and Mrs. Proudie. He was a prudent\nman, gifted with the great power of holding his tongue, and had not\nspoken a word, even to his wife, of what had occurred. After such\na victory our old friend the archdeacon would have blown his own\ntrumpet loudly among his friends. Plumstead would have heard of it\ninstantly, and the p\u00c3\u00a6an would have been sung out in the neighbouring\nparishes of Eiderdown, Stogpingum, and St. Ewolds. The high-street of\nBarchester would have known of it, and the very bedesmen in Hiram's\nHospital would have told among themselves the terrible discomfiture\nof the bishop and his lady. But Dr. Tempest spoke no word of it to\nanybody. He wrote letters to the two clergymen named by the bishop,\nand himself selected two others out of his own rural deanery, and\nsuggested to them all a day at which a preliminary meeting should\nbe held at his own house. The two who were invited by him were Mr.\nOriel, the rector of Greshamsbury, and Mr. Robarts, the vicar of\nFramley. They all assented to the proposition, and on the day named\nassembled themselves at Silverbridge.\n\nIt was now April, and the judges were to come into Barchester\nbefore the end of the month. What then could be the use of this\necclesiastical inquiry exactly at the same time? Men and women\ndeclared that it was a double prosecution, and that a double\nprosecution for the same offence was a course of action opposed to\nthe feelings and traditions of the country. Miss Anne Prettyman\nwent so far as to say that it was unconstitutional, and Mary Walker\ndeclared that no human being except Mrs. Proudie would ever have been\nguilty of such cruelty. \"Don't tell me about the bishop, John,\" she\nsaid; \"the bishop is a cypher.\" \"You may be sure Dr. Tempest would\nnot have a hand in it if it were not right,\" said John Walker. \"My\ndear Mr. John,\" said Miss Anne Prettyman, \"Dr. Tempest is as hard as\na bar of iron, and always was. But I am surprised that Mr. Robarts\nshould take a part in it.\"\n\nIn the meantime, at the palace, Mrs. Proudie had been reduced to\nlearn what was going on from Mr. Thumble. The bishop had never spoken\na word to her respecting Mr. Crawley since that terrible day on which\nDr. Tempest had witnessed his imbecility,--having absolutely declined\nto answer when his wife had mentioned the subject. \"You won't speak\nto me about it, my dear?\" she had said to him, when he had thus\ndeclined, remonstrating more in sorrow than in anger. \"No; I won't,\"\nthe bishop had replied; \"there has been a great deal too much talking\nabout it. It has broken my heart already, I know.\" These were very\nbad days in the palace. Mrs. Proudie affected to be satisfied with\nwhat was being done. She talked to Mr. Thumble about Mr. Crawley\nand the cheque, as though everything were arranged quite to her\nsatisfaction,--as though everything, indeed, had been arranged by\nherself. But everybody about the house could see that the manner of\nthe woman was altogether altered. She was milder than usual with the\nservants and was almost too gentle in her usage of her husband. It\nseemed as though something had happened to frighten her and break\nher spirit, and it was whispered about through the palace that she\nwas afraid that the bishop was dying. As for him, he hardly left his\nown sitting-room in these days, except when he joined the family at\nbreakfast and at dinner. And in his study he did little or nothing.\nHe would smile when his chaplain went to him, and give some trifling\nverbal directions; but for days he scarcely ever took a pen in his\nhands, and though he took up many books he read hardly a page. How\noften he told his wife in those days that he was broken-hearted, no\none but his wife ever knew.\n\n\"What has happened that you should speak like that?\" she said to him\nonce. \"What has broken your heart?\"\n\n\"You,\" he replied. \"You; you have done it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tom,\" she said, going back into the memory of very far distant\ndays in her nomenclature, \"how can you speak to me so cruelly as\nthat! That it should come to that between you and me, after all!\"\n\n\"Why did you not go away and leave me that day when I told you?\"\n\n\"Did you ever know a woman who liked to be turned out of a room in\nher own house?\" said Mrs. Proudie. When Mrs. Proudie had condescended\nso far as this, it must be admitted that in those days there was\ngreat trouble in the palace.\n\nMr. Thumble, on the day before he went to Silverbridge, asked for an\naudience with the bishop in order that he might receive instructions.\nHe had been strictly desired to do this by Mrs. Proudie, and had not\ndared to disobey her injunctions,--thinking, however, himself, that\nhis doing so was inexpedient. \"I have got nothing to say to you about\nit; not a word,\" said the bishop crossly. \"I thought that perhaps\nyou might like to see me before I started,\" pleaded Mr. Thumble very\nhumbly. \"I don't want to see you at all,\" said the bishop; \"you are\ngoing there to exercise your own judgment,--if you have got any;\nand you ought not to come to me.\" After that Mr. Thumble began to\nthink that Mrs. Proudie was right, and that the bishop was near his\ndissolution.\n\nMr. Thumble and Mr. Quiverful went over to Silverbridge together in\na gig, hired from the \"Dragon of Wantly\"--as to the cost of which\nthere arose among them a not unnatural apprehension which amounted\nat last almost to dismay. \"I don't mind it so much for once,\" said\nMr. Quiverful, \"but if many such meetings are necessary, I for one\ncan't afford it, and I won't do it. A man with my family can't allow\nhimself to be money out of pocket in that way.\" \"It is hard,\" said\nMr. Thumble. \"She ought to pay it herself, out of her own pocket,\"\nsaid Mr. Quiverful. He had had concerns with the palace when Mrs.\nProudie was in the full swing of her dominion, and had not as yet\nbegun to suspect that there might possibly be a change.\n\nMr. Oriel and Mr. Robarts were already sitting with Dr. Tempest when\nthe other two clergymen were shown into the room. When the first\ngreetings were over luncheon was announced, and while they were\neating not a word was said about Mr. Crawley. The ladies of the\nfamily were not present, and the five clergymen sat round the table\nalone. It would have been difficult to have got together five\ngentlemen less likely to act with one mind and one spirit;--and\nperhaps it was all the better for Mr. Crawley that it should be so.\nDr. Tempest himself was a man peculiarly capable of exercising the\nfunctions of a judge in such a matter, had he sat alone as a judge;\nbut he was one who would be almost sure to differ from others who sat\nas equal assessors with him. Mr. Oriel was a gentleman at all points;\nbut he was very shy, very reticent, and altogether uninstructed in\nthe ordinary daily intercourse of man with man. Any one knowing him\nmight have predicted of him that he would be sure on such an occasion\nas this to be found floundering in a sea of doubts. Mr. Quiverful was\nthe father of a large family, whose whole life had been devoted to\nfighting a cruel world on behalf of his wife and children. That fight\nhe had fought bravely; but it had left him no energy for any other\nbusiness. Mr. Thumble was a poor creature,--so poor a creature that,\nin spite of a small restless ambition to be doing something, he was\nalmost cowed by the hard lines of Dr. Tempest's brow. The Rev. Mark\nRobarts was a man of the world, and a clever fellow, and did not\nstand in awe of anybody,--unless it might be, in a very moderate\ndegree, of his patrons the Luftons, whom he was bound to respect;\nbut his cleverness was not the cleverness needed by a judge. He was\nessentially a partisan, and would be sure to vote against the bishop\nin such a matter as this now before him. There was a palace faction\nin the diocese, and an anti-palace faction. Mr. Thumble and Mr.\nQuiverful belonged to one, and Mr. Oriel and Mr. Robarts to the\nother. Mr. Thumble was too weak to stick to his faction against the\nstrength of such a man as Dr. Tempest. Mr. Quiverful would be too\nindifferent to do so,--unless his interest were concerned. Mr. Oriel\nwould be too conscientious to regard his own side on such an occasion\nas this. But Mark Robarts would be sure to support his friends and\noppose his enemies, let the case be what it might. \"Now, gentlemen,\nif you please, we will go into the other room,\" said Dr. Tempest.\nThey went into the other room, and there they found five chairs\narranged for them round the table. Not a word had as yet been said\nabout Mr. Crawley, and no one of the four strangers knew whether Mr.\nCrawley was to appear before them on that day or not.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Dr. Tempest, seating himself at once in an\narm-chair placed at the middle of the table, \"I think it will be\nwell to explain to you at first what, as I regard the matter, is the\nextent of the work which we are called upon to perform. It is of its\nnature very disagreeable. It cannot but be so, let it be ever so\nlimited. Here is a brother clergyman and a gentleman, living among\nus, and doing his duty, as we are told, in a most exemplary manner;\nand suddenly we hear that he is accused of a theft. The matter is\nbrought before the magistrates, of whom I myself was one, and he was\ncommitted for trial. There is therefore prim\u00c3\u00a2 facie evidence of his\nguilt. But I do not think that we need go into the question of his\nguilt at all.\" When he said this, the other four all looked up at\nhim in astonishment. \"I thought that we had been summoned here for\nthat purpose,\" said Mr. Robarts. \"Not at all, as I take it,\" said\nthe doctor. \"Were we to commence any such inquiry, the jury would\nhave given their verdict before we could come to any conclusion; and\nit would be impossible for us to oppose that verdict, whether it\ndeclares this unfortunate gentleman to be innocent or to be guilty.\nIf the jury shall say that he is innocent, there is an end of the\nmatter altogether. He would go back to his parish amidst the sympathy\nand congratulations of his friends. That is what we should all wish.\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" said Mr. Robarts. They all declared that was their\ndesire, as a matter of course; and Mr. Thumble said it louder than\nany one else.\n\n\"But if he be found guilty, then will come that difficulty to the\nbishop, in which we are bound to give him any assistance within our\npower.\"\n\n\"Of course we are,\" said Mr. Thumble, who, having heard his own voice\nonce, and having liked the sound, thought that he might creep into a\nlittle importance by using it on any occasion that opened itself for\nhim.\n\n\"If you will allow me, sir, I will venture to state my views as\nshortly as I can,\" said Dr. Tempest. \"That may perhaps be the most\nexpeditious course for us all in the end.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said Mr. Thumble. \"I didn't mean to interrupt.\"\n\n\"In the case of his being found guilty,\" continued the doctor, \"there\nwill arise the question whether the punishment awarded to him by\nthe judge should suffice for ecclesiastical purposes. Suppose, for\ninstance, that he should be imprisoned for two months, should he be\nallowed to return to his living at the expiration of that term?\"\n\n\"I think he ought,\" said Mr. Robarts;--\"considering all things.\"\n\n\"I don't see why he shouldn't,\" said Mr. Quiverful.\n\nMr. Oriel sat listening patiently, and Mr. Thumble looked up to the\ndoctor, expecting to hear some opinion expressed by him with which he\nmight coincide.\n\n\"There certainly are reasons why he should not,\" said Dr. Tempest;\n\"though I by no means say that those reasons are conclusive in the\npresent case. In the first place, a man who has stolen money can\nhardly be a fitting person to teach others not to steal.\"\n\n\"You must look to the circumstances,\" said Robarts.\n\n\"Yes, that is true; but just bear with me a moment. It cannot, at any\nrate, be thought that a clergyman should come out of prison and go\nto his living without any notice from his bishop, simply because he\nhas already been punished under the common law. If this were so, a\nclergyman might be fined ten days running for being drunk in the\nstreet,--five shillings each time,--and at the end of that time might\nset his bishop at defiance. When a clergyman has shown himself to\nbe utterly unfit for clerical duties, he must not be held to be\nprotected from ecclesiastical censure or from deprivation by the\naction of the common law.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Crawley has not shown himself to be unfit,\" said Robarts.\n\n\"That is begging the question, Robarts,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Just so,\" said Mr. Thumble. Then Mr. Robarts gave a look at Mr.\nThumble, and Mr. Thumble retired into his shoes.\n\n\"That is the question as to which we are called upon to advise the\nbishop,\" continued Dr. Tempest. \"And I must say that I think the\nbishop is right. If he were to allow the matter to pass by without\nnotice,--that is to say, in the event of Mr. Crawley being pronounced\nto be guilty by a jury,--he would, I think, neglect his duty. Now,\nI have been informed that the bishop has recommended Mr. Crawley to\ndesist from his duties till the trial be over, and that Mr. Crawley\nhas declined to take the bishop's advice.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Mr. Thumble. \"He altogether disregarded the\nbishop.\"\n\n\"I cannot say that I think he was wrong,\" said Dr. Tempest.\n\n\"I think he was quite right,\" said Mr. Robarts.\n\n\"A bishop in almost all cases is entitled to the obedience of his\nclergy,\" said Mr. Oriel.\n\n\"I must say that I agree with you, sir,\" said Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"The income is not large, and I suppose that it would have gone with\nthe duties,\" said Mr. Quiverful. \"It is very hard for a man with a\nfamily to live when his income has been stopped.\"\n\n\"Be that as it may,\" continued the doctor, \"the bishop feels that it\nmay be his duty to oppose the return of Mr. Crawley to his pulpit,\nand that he can oppose it in no other way than by proceeding against\nMr. Crawley under the Clerical Offences Act. I propose, therefore,\nthat we should invite Mr. Crawley to attend here--\"\n\n\"Mr. Crawley is not coming here to-day, then?\" said Mr. Robarts.\n\n\"I thought it useless to ask for his attendance until we had settled\non our course of action,\" said Dr. Tempest. \"If we are all agreed,\nI will beg him to come here on this day week, when we will meet\nagain. And we will then ask him whether he will submit himself to the\nbishop's decision, in the event of the jury finding him guilty. If\nhe should decline to do so, we can only then form our opinion as to\nwhat will be the bishop's duty by reference to the facts as they are\nelicited at the trial. If Mr. Crawley should choose to make to us\nany statement as to his own case, of course we shall be willing to\nreceive it. That is my idea of what had better be done; and now, if\nany gentleman has any other proposition to make, of course we shall\nbe pleased to hear him.\" Dr. Tempest, as he said this, looked round\nupon his companions, as though his pleasure, under the circumstances\nsuggested by himself, would be very doubtful.\n\n\"I don't suppose we can do anything better,\" said Mr. Robarts. \"I\nthink it a pity, however, that any steps should have been taken by\nthe bishop before the trial.\"\n\n\"The bishop has been placed in a very delicate position,\" said Mr.\nThumble, pleading for his patron.\n\n\"I don't know the meaning of the word 'delicate,'\" said Robarts.\n\"I think his duty was very clear, to avoid interference whilst the\nmatter is, so to say, before the judge.\"\n\n\"Nobody has anything else to propose?\" said Dr. Tempest. \"Then I will\nwrite to Mr. Crawley, and you, gentlemen, will perhaps do me the\nhonour of meeting me here at one o'clock on this day week.\" Then the\nmeeting was over, and the four clergymen having shaken hands with Dr.\nTempest in the hall, all promised that they would return on that day\nweek. So far, Dr. Tempest had carried his point exactly as he might\nhave done had the four gentlemen been represented by the chairs on\nwhich they had sat.\n\n\"I shan't come again, all the same, unless I know where I'm to get my\nexpenses,\" said Mr. Quiverful, as he got into the gig.\n\n\"I shall come,\" said Mr. Thumble, \"because I think it a duty. Of\ncourse it is a hardship.\" Mr. Thumble liked the idea of being joined\nwith such men as Dr. Tempest, and Mr. Oriel, and Mr. Robarts, and\nwould any day have paid the expense of a gig from Barchester to\nSilverbridge out of his own pocket, for the sake of sitting with such\nbenchfellows on any clerical inquiry.\n\n\"One's first duty is to one's own wife and family,\" said Mr.\nQuiverful.\n\n\"Well, yes; in a way, of course, that is quite true, Mr. Quiverful;\nand when we know how very inadequate are the incomes of the working\nclergy, we cannot but feel ourselves to be, if I may so say, put\nupon, when we have to defray the expenses incidental to special\nduties out of our own pockets. I think, you know,--I don't mind\nsaying this to you,--that the palace should have provided us with\na chaise and pair.\" This was ungrateful on the part of Mr. Thumble,\nwho had been permitted to ride miles upon miles to various outlying\nclerical duties upon the bishop's worn-out cob. \"You see,\" continued\nMr. Thumble, \"you and I go specially to represent the palace, and the\npalace ought to remember that. I think there ought to have been a\nchaise and pair; I do indeed.\"\n\n\"I don't care much what the conveyance is,\" said Mr. Quiverful; \"but\nI certainly shall pay nothing more out of my own pocket;--certainly I\nshall not.\"\n\n\"The result will be that the palace will be thrown over if they\ndon't take care,\" said Mr. Thumble. \"Tempest, however, seems to be\npretty steady. Tempest, I think, is steady. You see he is getting\ntired of parish work, and would like to go into the close. That's\nwhat he is looking out for. Did you ever see such a fellow as that\nRobarts,--just look at him;--quite indecent, wasn't he? He thinks he\ncan have his own way in everything, just because his sister married a\nlord. I do hate to see all that meanness.\"\n\nMark Robarts and Caleb Oriel left Silverbridge in another gig by the\nsame road, and soon passed their brethren, as Mr. Robarts was in the\nhabit of driving a large, quick-stepping horse. The last remarks were\nbeing made as the dust from the vicar of Framley's wheels saluted the\nfaces of the two slower clergymen. Mr. Oriel had promised to dine and\nsleep at Framley, and therefore returned in Mr. Robarts' gig.\n\n\"Quite unnecessary, all this fuss; don't you think so?\" said Mr.\nRobarts.\n\n\"I am not quite sure,\" said Mr. Oriel. \"I can understand that the\nbishop may have found a difficulty.\"\n\n\"The bishop, indeed! The bishop doesn't care two straws about it.\nIt's Mrs. Proudie! She has put her finger on the poor man's neck\nbecause he has not put his neck beneath her feet; and now she thinks\nshe can crush him,--as she would crush you or me, if it were in\nher power. That's about the long and the short of the bishop's\nsolicitude.\"\n\n\"You are very hard on him,\" said Mr. Oriel.\n\n\"I know him;--and am not at all hard on him. She is hard upon him if\nyou like. Tempest is fair. He is very fair, and as long as no one\nmeddles with him he won't do amiss. I can't hold my tongue always,\nbut I often know that it is better that I should.\"\n\nDr. Tempest said not a word to any one on the subject, not even in\nhis own defence. And yet he was sorely tempted. On the very day of\nthe meeting he dined at Mr. Walker's in Silverbridge, and there\nsubmitted to be talked at by all the ladies and most of the gentlemen\npresent, without saying a word in his own defence. And yet a word or\ntwo would have been so easy and so conclusive.\n\n\"Oh, Dr. Tempest,\" said Mary Walker, \"I am so sorry that you have\njoined the bishop.\"\n\n\"Are you, my dear?\" said he. \"It is generally thought well that a\nparish clergyman should agree with his bishop.\"\n\n\"But you know, Dr. Tempest, that you don't agree with your bishop\ngenerally.\"\n\n\"Then it is the more fortunate that I shall be able to agree with him\non this occasion.\"\n\nMajor Grantly was present at the dinner, and ventured to ask the\ndoctor in the course of the evening what he thought would be done.\n\"I should not venture to ask such a question, Dr. Tempest,\" he said,\n\"unless I had the strongest possible reason to justify my anxiety.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I can tell you anything, Major Grantly,\" said the\ndoctor. \"We did not even see Mr. Crawley to-day. But the real truth\nis that he must stand or fall as the jury shall find him guilty or\nnot guilty. It would be the same in any profession. Could a captain\nin the army hold up his head in his regiment after he had been tried\nand found guilty of stealing twenty pounds?\"\n\n\"I don't think he could,\" said the major.\n\n\"Neither can a clergyman,\" said the doctor. \"The bishop can neither\nmake him nor mar him. It is the jury that must do it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nFRAMLEY PARSONAGE.\n\n\nAt this time Grace Crawley was at Framley Parsonage. Old Lady\nLufton's strategy had been quite intelligible, but some people said\nthat in point of etiquette and judgment and moral conduct, it was\nindefensible. Her vicar, Mr. Robarts, had been selected to be one\nof the clergymen who was to sit in ecclesiastical judgment upon Mr.\nCrawley, and while he was so sitting Mr. Crawley's daughter was\nstaying in Mr. Robarts' house as a visitor with his wife! It might\nbe that there was no harm in this. Lady Lufton, when the apparent\nimpropriety was pointed out to her by no less a person than\nArchdeacon Grantly, ridiculed the idea. \"My dear archdeacon,\" Lady\nLufton had said, \"we all know the bishop to be such a fool and the\nbishop's wife to be such a knave, that we cannot allow ourselves to\nbe governed in this matter by ordinary rules. Do you not think that\nit is expedient to show how utterly we disregard his judgment and\nher malice?\" The archdeacon had hesitated much before he spoke to\nLady Lufton, whether he should address himself to her or to Mr.\nRobarts,--or indeed to Mrs. Robarts. But he had become aware that\nthe proposition as to the visit had originated with Lady Lufton, and\nhe had therefore decided on speaking to her. He had not condescended\nto say a word as to his son, nor would he so condescend. Nor could\nhe go from Lady Lufton to Mr. Robarts, having once failed with her\nladyship. Indeed, in giving him his due, we must acknowledge that\nhis disapprobation of Lady Lufton's strategy arose rather from his\ntrue conviction as to its impropriety, than from any fear lest\nthis attention paid to Miss Crawley should tend to bring about\nher marriage with his son. By this time he hated the very name of\nCrawley. He hated it the more because in hating it he had to put\nhimself for the time on the same side with Mrs. Proudie. But for all\nthat he would not condescend to any unworthy mode of fighting. He\nthought it wrong that the young lady should be invited to Framley\nParsonage at this moment, and he said so to the person who had, as he\nthought, in truth, given the invitation; but he would not allow his\nown personal motives to induce him to carry on the argument with Lady\nLufton. \"The bishop is a fool,\" he said, \"and the bishop's wife is\na knave. Nevertheless I would not have had the young lady over to\nFramley at this moment. If, however, you think it right and Robarts\nthinks it right, there is an end of it.\"\n\n\"Upon my word we do,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\nI am induced to think that Mr. Robarts was not quite confident of the\nexpediency of what he was doing by the way in which he mentioned to\nMr. Oriel the fact of Miss Crawley's presence at the parsonage as he\ndrove that gentleman home in his gig. They had been talking about Mr.\nCrawley when he suddenly turned himself round, so that he could look\nat his companion, and said, \"Miss Crawley is staying with us at the\nparsonage at the present moment.\"\n\n\"What! Mr. Crawley's daughter?\" said Mr. Oriel, showing plainly by\nhis voice that the tidings had much surprised him.\n\n\"Yes; Mr. Crawley's daughter.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed. I did not know that you were on those terms with the\nfamily.\"\n\n\"We have known them for the last seven or eight years,\" said Mark;\n\"and though I should be giving you a false notion if I were to say\nthat I myself have known them intimately,--for Crawley is a man\nwhom it is quite impossible to know intimately,--yet the womankind\nat Framley have known them. My sister stayed with them over at\nHogglestock for some time.\"\n\n\"What; Lady Lufton?\"\n\n\"Yes; my sister Lucy. It was just before her marriage. There was a\nlot of trouble, and the Crawleys were all ill, and she went to nurse\nthem. And then the old lady took them up, and altogether there came\nto be a sort of feeling that they were to be regarded as friends.\nThey are always in trouble, and now in this special trouble the women\nbetween them have thought it best to have the girl over at Framley.\nOf course I had a kind of feeling about this commission; but as I\nknew that it would make no difference with me I did not think it\nnecessary to put my veto upon the visit.\" Mr. Oriel said nothing\nfurther, but Mark Robarts was aware that Mr. Oriel did not quite\napprove of the visit.\n\nThat morning old Lady Lufton herself had come across to the parsonage\nwith the express view of bidding all the parsonage party to come\nacross to the hall to dine. \"You can tell Mr. Oriel, Fanny, with\nLucy's compliments, how delighted she will be to see him.\" Old Lady\nLufton always spoke of her daughter-in-law as the mistress of the\nhouse. \"If you think he is particular, you know, we will send a note\nacross.\" Mrs. Robarts said that she supposed Mr. Oriel would not be\nparticular, but, looking at Grace, made some faint excuse. \"You must\ncome, my dear,\" said Lady Lufton. \"Lucy wishes it particularly.\" Mrs.\nRobarts did not know how to say that she would not come; and so the\nmatter stood,--when Mrs. Robarts was called upon to leave the room\nfor a moment, and Lady Lufton and Grace were left alone.\n\n\"Dear Lady Lufton,\" said Grace, getting up suddenly from her chair;\n\"will you do me a favour,--a great favour?\" She spoke with an energy\nwhich quite surprised the old lady, and caused her almost to start\nfrom her seat.\n\n\"I don't like making promises,\" said Lady Lufton; \"but anything I can\ndo with propriety I will.\"\n\n\"You can do this. Pray let me stay here to-day. You don't understand\nhow I feel about going out while papa is in this way. I know how\nkind and how good you all are; and when dear Mrs. Robarts asked me\nhere, and mamma said that I had better come, I could not refuse. But\nindeed, indeed, I had rather not go out to a dinner-party.\"\n\n\"It is not a party, my dear girl,\" said Lady Lufton, with the kindest\nvoice which she knew how to assume. \"And you must remember that my\ndaughter-in-law regards you as so very old a friend! You remember, of\ncourse, when she was staying over at Hogglestock?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do. I remember it well.\"\n\n\"And therefore you should not regard it as going out. There will be\nnobody there but ourselves and the people from this house.\"\n\n\"But it will be going out, Lady Lufton; and I do hope you will let\nme stay here. You cannot think how I feel it. Of course I cannot go\nwithout something like dressing, and--and--and-- In poor papa's state\nI feel that I ought not to do anything that looks like gaiety. I\nought never to forget it;--not for a moment.\"\n\nThere was a tear in Lady Lufton's eye as she said,--\"My dear, you\nshan't come. You and Fanny shall stop and dine here by yourselves.\nThe gentlemen shall come.\"\n\n\"Do let Mrs. Robarts go, please,\" said Grace.\n\n\"I won't do anything of the kind,\" said Lady Lufton. Then, when Mrs.\nRobarts returned to the room, her ladyship explained it all in two\nwords. \"Whilst you have been away, my dear, Grace has begged off, and\ntherefore we have decided that Mr. Oriel and Mr. Robarts shall come\nwithout you.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry, Mrs. Robarts,\" said Grace.\n\n\"Pooh, pooh,\" said Lady Lufton. \"Fanny and I have known each other\nquite long enough not to stand on any compliments,--haven't we, my\ndear? I must get home now, as all the morning has gone by. Fanny my\ndear, I want to speak to you.\" Then she expressed her opinion of\nGrace Crawley as she walked across the parsonage garden with Mrs.\nRobarts. \"She is a very nice girl, and a very good girl, I am sure;\nand she shows excellent feeling. Whatever happens we must take care\nof her. And, Fanny, have you observed how handsome she is?\"\n\n\"We think her very pretty.\"\n\n\"She is more than pretty when she has a little fire in her eyes. She\nis downright handsome,--or will be when she fills out a little. I\ntell you what, my dear; she'll make havoc with somebody yet; you see\nif she doesn't. By--by. Tell the two gentlemen to be up by seven\npunctually.\" And then Lady Lufton went home.\n\nGrace so contrived that Mr. Oriel came and went without seeing\nher. There was a separate nursery breakfast at the parsonage,\nand by special permission Grace was allowed to have her tea and\nbread-and-butter on the next morning with the children. \"I thought\nyou told me Miss Crawley was here,\" said Mr. Oriel, as the two\nclergymen stood waiting for the gig that was to take the visitor away\nto Barchester.\n\n\"So she is,\" said Robarts; \"but she likes to hide herself, because of\nher father's trouble. You can't blame her.\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Mr. Oriel.\n\n\"Poor girl. If you knew her you would not only pity her, but like\nher.\"\n\n\"Is she,--what you call--?\"\n\n\"You mean, is she a lady?\"\n\n\"Of course she is by birth, and all that,\" said Mr. Oriel,\napologizing for his inquiry.\n\n\"I don't think there is another girl in the county so well educated,\"\nsaid Mr. Robarts.\n\n\"Indeed! I had no idea of that.\"\n\n\"And we think her a great beauty. As for manners, I never saw a girl\nwith a prettier way of her own.\"\n\n\"Dear me,\" said Mr. Oriel. \"I wish she had come down to breakfast.\"\n\nIt will have been perceived that old Lady Lufton had heard nothing\nof Major Grantly's offence; that she had no knowledge that Grace had\nalready made havoc, as she had called it,--had, in truth, made very\nsad havoc, at Plumstead. She did not, therefore, think much about it\nwhen her son told her upon her return home from the parsonage on that\nafternoon that Major Grantly had come over from Cosby Lodge, and that\nhe was going to dine and sleep at Framley Court. Some slight idea of\nthankfulness came across her mind that she had not betrayed Grace\nCrawley into a meeting with a stranger. \"I asked him to come some day\nbefore we went up to town,\" said his lordship; \"and I am glad he has\ncome to-day, as two clergymen to one's self are, at any rate, one too\nmany.\" So Major Grantly dined and slept at the Court.\n\nBut Mrs. Robarts was in a great flurry when she was told of this by\nher husband on his return from the dinner. Mrs. Crawley had found\nan opportunity of telling the story of Major Grantly's love to Mrs.\nRobarts before she had sent her daughter to Framley, knowing that the\nfamilies were intimate, and thinking it right that there should be\nsome precaution.\n\n\"I wonder whether he will come up here,\" Mrs. Robarts had said.\n\n\"Probably not,\" said the vicar. \"He said he was going home early.\"\n\n\"I hope he will not come--for Grace's sake,\" said Mrs. Robarts. She\nhesitated whether she should tell her husband. She always did tell\nhim everything. But on this occasion she thought she had no right to\ndo so, and she kept the secret. \"Don't do anything to bring him up,\ndear.\"\n\n\"You needn't be afraid. He won't come,\" said the vicar. On the\nfollowing morning, as soon as Mr. Oriel was gone, Mr. Robarts went\nout,--about his parish he would probably have called it; but in half\nan hour he might have been seen strolling about the Court stable-yard\nwith Lord Lufton. \"Where is Grantly?\" asked the vicar. \"I don't know\nwhere he is,\" said his lordship. \"He has sloped off somewhere.\" The\nmajor had sloped off to the parsonage, well knowing in what nest his\ndove was lying hid; and he and the vicar had passed each other. The\nmajor had gone out at the front gate, and the vicar had gone in at\nthe stable entrance.\n\nThe two clergymen had hardly taken their departure when Major Grantly\nknocked at the parsonage door. He had come so early that Mrs. Robarts\nhad taken no precautions,--even had there been any precautions which\nshe would have thought it right to take. Grace was in the act of\ncoming down the stairs, not having heard the knock at the door,\nand thus she found her lover in the hall. He had asked, of course,\nfor Mrs. Robarts, and thus they two entered the drawing-room\ntogether. They had not had time to speak when the servant opened the\ndrawing-room door to announce the visitor. There had been no word\nspoken between Mrs. Robarts and Grace about Major Grantly, but the\nmother had told the daughter of what she had said to Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"Grace,\" said the major, \"I am so glad to find you!\" Then he turned\nto Mrs. Robarts with his open hand. \"You won't take it uncivil of me\nif I say that my visit is not entirely to yourself? I think I may\ntake upon myself to say that I and Miss Crawley are old friends. May\nI not?\"\n\nGrace could not answer a word. \"Mrs. Crawley told me that you\nhad known her at Silverbridge,\" said Mrs. Robarts, driven to say\nsomething, but feeling that she was blundering.\n\n\"I came over to Framley yesterday because I heard that she was here.\nAm I wrong to come up here to see her?\"\n\n\"I think she must answer that for herself, Major Grantly.\"\n\n\"Am I wrong, Grace?\" Grace thought that he was the finest gentleman\nand the noblest lover that had ever shown his devotion to a woman,\nand was stirred by a mighty resolve that if it ever should be in her\npower to reward him after any fashion, she would pour out the reward\nwith a very full hand indeed. But what was she to say on the present\nmoment? \"Am I wrong, Grace?\" he said, repeating his question with so\nmuch emphasis, that she was positively driven to answer it.\n\n\"I do not think you are wrong at all. How can I say you are wrong\nwhen you are so good? If I could be your servant I would serve you.\nBut I can be nothing to you, because of papa's disgrace. Dear Mrs.\nRobarts, I cannot stay. You must answer him for me.\" And having thus\nmade her speech she escaped from the room.\n\n[Illustration: \"Because of Papa's disgrace.\"]\n\nIt may suffice to say further now that the major did not see Grace\nagain during that visit at Framley.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nTHE ARCHDEACON GOES TO FRAMLEY.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBy some of those unseen telegraphic wires which carry news about the\ncountry and make no charge for the conveyance, Archdeacon Grantly\nheard that his son the major was at Framley. Now in that itself there\nwould have been nothing singular. There had been for years much\nintimacy between the Lufton family and the Grantly family,--so much\nthat an alliance between the two houses had once been planned, the\nelders having considered it expedient that the young lord should\nmarry that Griselda who had since mounted higher in the world even\nthan the elders had then projected for her. There had come no such\nalliance; but the intimacy had not ceased, and there was nothing in\nitself surprising in the fact that Major Grantly should be staying at\nFramley Court. But the archdeacon, when he heard the news, bethought\nhim at once of Grace Crawley. Could it be possible that his old\nfriend Lady Lufton,--Lady Lufton whom he had known and trusted all\nhis life, whom he had ever regarded as a pillar of the church in\nBarsetshire,--should now be untrue to him in a matter so closely\naffecting his interests? Men when they are worried by fears and\nteased by adverse circumstances become suspicious of those on whom\nsuspicion should never rest. It was hardly possible, the archdeacon\nthought, that Lady Lufton should treat him so unworthily,--but the\ncircumstances were strong against his friend. Lady Lufton had induced\nMiss Crawley to go to Framley, much against his advice, at a time\nwhen such a visit seemed to him to be very improper; and it now\nappeared that his son was to be there at the same time,--a fact of\nwhich Lady Lufton had made no mention to him whatever. Why had not\nLady Lufton told him that Henry Grantly was coming to Framley Court?\nThe reader, whose interest in the matter will be less keen than\nwas the archdeacon's, will know very well why Lady Lufton had said\nnothing about the major's visit. The reader will remember that Lady\nLufton, when she saw the archdeacon, was as ignorant as to the\nintended visit as was the archdeacon himself. But the archdeacon was\nuneasy, troubled, and suspicious;--and he suspected his old friend\nunworthily.\n\nHe spoke to his wife about it within a very few hours of the arrival\nof the tidings by those invisible wires. He had already told her that\nMiss Crawley was to go to Framley parsonage, and that he thought that\nMrs. Robarts was wrong to receive her at such a time. \"It is only\nintended for good-nature,\" Mrs. Grantly had said. \"It is misplaced\ngood-nature at the present moment,\" the archdeacon had replied. Mrs.\nGrantly had not thought it worth her while to undertake at the moment\nany strong defence of the Framley people. She knew well how odious\nwas the name of Crawley in her husband's ears, and she felt that the\nless that was said at present about the Crawleys the better for the\npeace of the rectory at Plumstead. She had therefore allowed the\nexpression of his disapproval to pass unchallenged. But now he came\nupon her with a more bitter grievance, and she was obliged to argue\nthe matter with him.\n\n\"What do you think?\" said he; \"Henry is at Framley.\"\n\n\"He can hardly be staying there,\" said Mrs. Grantly, \"because I know\nthat he is so very busy at home.\" The business at home of which the\nmajor's mother was speaking was his projected moving from Cosby\nLodge, a subject which was also very odious to the archdeacon. He did\nnot wish his son to move from Cosby Lodge. He could not endure the\nidea that his son should be known throughout the county to be giving\nup a residence because he could not afford to keep it. The archdeacon\ncould have afforded to keep up two Cosby Lodges for his son, and\nwould have been well pleased to do so, if only his son would not\nmisbehave against him so shamefully! He could not bear that his\nson should be punished, openly, before the eyes of all Barsetshire.\nIndeed he did not wish that his son should be punished at all. He\nsimply desired that his son should recognize his father's power to\ninflict punishment. It would be henbane to Archdeacon Grantly to have\na poor son,--a son living at Pau,--among Frenchmen!--because he could\nnot afford to live in England. Why had the archdeacon been careful of\nhis money, adding house to house and field to field? He himself was\ncontented,--so he told himself,--to die as he had lived in a country\nparsonage, working with the collar round his neck up to the day of\nhis death, if God would allow him so to do. He was ambitious of\nno grandeur for himself. So he would tell himself,--being partly\noblivious of certain episodes in his own life. All his wealth had\nbeen got together for his children. He desired that his sons should\nbe fitting brothers for their August sister. And now the son who was\nnearest to him, whom he was bent upon making a squire in his own\ncounty, wanted to marry the daughter of a man who had stolen twenty\npounds, and when objection was made to so discreditable a connexion,\nreplied by packing up all his things and saying that he would go and\nlive--at Pau! The archdeacon therefore did not like to hear of his\nson being very busy at home.\n\n\"I don't know whether he's busy or not,\" said the archdeacon, \"but I\ntell you he is staying at Framley.\"\n\n\"From whom have you heard it?\"\n\n\"What matter does that make if it is so? I heard it from Flurry.\"\n\n\"Flurry may have been mistaken,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"It is not at all likely. Those people always know about such things.\nHe heard it from the Framley keeper. I don't doubt but it's true, and\nI think that it's a great shame.\"\n\n\"A great shame that Henry should be at Framley! He has been there two\nor three times every year since he has lived in the county.\"\n\n\"It is a great shame that he should be had over there just at the\ntime when that girl is there also. It is impossible to believe that\nsuch a thing is an accident.\"\n\n\"But, archdeacon, you do not mean to say that you think that Lady\nLufton has arranged it?\"\n\n\"I don't know who has arranged it. Somebody has arranged it. If it is\nRobarts, that is almost worse. One could forgive a woman in such a\nmatter better than one could a man.\"\n\n\"Psha!\" Mrs. Grantly's temper was never bitter, but at this moment it\nwas not sweetened by her husband's very uncivil reference to her sex.\n\"The whole idea is nonsense, and you should get it out of your head.\"\n\n\"Am I to get it out of my head that Henry wants to make this girl his\nwife, and that the two are at this moment at Framley together?\" In\nthis the archdeacon was wrong as to his facts. Major Grantly had left\nFramley on the previous day, having stayed there only one night.\n\"It is coming to that that one can trust no one--no one--literally\nno one.\" Mrs. Grantly perfectly understood that the archdeacon,\nin the agony of the moment, intended to exclude even herself from\nhis confidence by that \"no one;\" but to this she was indifferent,\nunderstanding accurately when his words should be accepted as\nexpressing his thoughts, and when they should be supposed to express\nonly his anger.\n\n\"The probability is that no one at Lufton knew anything about Henry's\npartiality for Miss Crawley,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"I tell you I think they are both at Framley together.\"\n\n\"And I tell you that if they are, which I doubt, they are there\nsimply by an accident. Besides, what does it matter? If they choose\nto marry each other, you and I cannot prevent them. They don't want\nany assistance from Lady Lufton, or anybody else. They have simply\ngot to make up their own minds, and then no one can hinder them.\"\n\n\"And, therefore, you would like to see them brought together?\"\n\n\"I say nothing about that, archdeacon; but I do say that we must take\nthese things as they come. What can we do? Henry may go and stay with\nLady Lufton if he pleases. You and I cannot prevent him.\"\n\nAfter this the archdeacon walked away, and would not argue the matter\nany further with his wife at that moment. He knew very well that he\ncould not get the better of her, and was apt at such moments to think\nthat she took an unfair advantage of him by keeping her temper. But\nhe could not get out of his head the idea that perhaps on this very\nday things were being arranged between his son and Grace Crawley at\nFramley; and he resolved that he himself would go over and see what\nmight be done. He would, at any rate, tell all his trouble to Lady\nLufton, and beg his old friend to assist him. He could not think that\nsuch a one as he had always known Lady Lufton to be would approve of\na marriage between Henry Grantly and Grace Crawley. At any rate, he\nwould learn the truth. He had once been told that Grace Crawley had\nherself refused to marry his son, feeling that she would do wrong to\ninflict so great an injury upon any gentleman. He had not believed\nin so great a virtue. He could not believe in it now,--now, when he\nheard that Miss Crawley and his son were staying together in the\nsame parish. Somebody must be doing him an injury. It could hardly\nbe chance. But his presence at Framley might even yet have a good\neffect, and he would at least learn the truth. So he had himself\ndriven to Barchester, and from Barchester he took post-horses to\nFramley.\n\nAs he came near to the village, he grew to be somewhat ashamed of\nhimself, or, at least, nervous as to the mode in which he would\nproceed. The driver, turning round to him, had suggested that he\nsupposed he was to drive to \"My lady's.\" This injustice to Lord\nLufton, to whom the house belonged, and with whom his mother lived\nas a guest, was very common in the county; for old Lady Lufton had\nlived at Framley Court through her son's long minority, and had kept\nthe house there till his marriage; and even since his marriage she\nhad been recognized as its presiding genius. It certainly was not\nthe fault of old Lady Lufton, as she always spoke of everything as\nbelonging either to her son or to her daughter-in-law. The archdeacon\nhad been in doubt whether he would go to the Court or to the\nparsonage. Could he have done exactly as he wished, he would have\nleft the chaise and walked to the parsonage, so as to reach it\nwithout the noise and fuss incidental to a postilion's arrival. But\nthat was impossible. He could not drop into Framley as though he had\ncome from the clouds, and, therefore, he told the man to do as he\nhad suggested. \"To my lady's?\" said the postilion. The archdeacon\nassented, and the man, with loud cracks of his whip, and with a\nspasmodic gallop along the short avenue, took the archdeacon up to\nthe door of Lord Lufton's house. He asked for Lord Lufton first,\nputting on his pleasantest smile, so that the servant should not\nsuspect the purpose, of which he was somewhat ashamed. Was Lord\nLufton at home? Lord Lufton was not at home. Lord Lufton had gone up\nto London that morning, intending to return the day after to-morrow;\nbut both my ladies were at home. So the archdeacon was shown into the\nroom where both my ladies were sitting,--and with them he found Mrs.\nRobarts. Any one who had become acquainted with the habits of the\nFramley ladies would have known that this might very probably be the\ncase. The archdeacon himself was as well aware as any one of the\nmodes of life at Framley. The lord's wife was the parson's sister,\nand the parson's wife had from her infancy been the petted friend of\nthe old lady. Of course they all lived very much together. Of course\nMrs. Robarts was as much at home in the drawing-room of Framley Court\nas she was in her own drawing-room at the parsonage. Nevertheless,\nthe archdeacon thought himself to be hardly used when he found that\nMrs. Robarts was at the house.\n\n\"My dear archdeacon, who ever expected to see you?\" said old Lady\nLufton. Then the two younger women greeted him. And they all smiled\non him pleasantly, and seemed overjoyed to see him. He was, in truth,\na great favourite at Framley, and each of the three was glad to\nwelcome him. They believed in the archdeacon at Framley, and felt for\nhim that sort of love which ladies in the country do feel for their\nelderly male friends. There was not one of the three who would not\nhave taken much trouble to get anything for the archdeacon which\nthey had thought the archdeacon would like. Even old Lady Lufton\nremembered what was his favourite soup, and always took care that he\nshould have it when he dined at the Court. Young Lady Lufton would\nbring his tea to him as he sat in his chair. He was petted in the\nhouse, was allowed to poke the fire if he pleased, and called the\nservants by their names as though he were at home. He was compelled,\ntherefore, to smile and to seem pleased; and it was not till after\nhe had eaten his lunch, and had declared that he must return home\nto dinner, that the dowager gave him an opportunity of having the\nprivate conversation which he desired.\n\n\"Can I have a few minutes' talk with you?\" he said to her, whispering\ninto her ear as they left the drawing-room together. So she led the\nway into her own sitting-room, telling him, as she asked him to\nbe seated, that she had supposed that something special must have\nbrought him over to Framley. \"I should have asked you to come up\nhere, even if you had not spoken,\" she said.\n\n\"Then perhaps you know what has brought me over?\" said the\narchdeacon.\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said Lady Lufton. \"I have not an idea. But I\ndid not flatter myself that you would come so far on a morning\ncall, merely to see us three ladies. I hope you did not want to see\nLudovic, because he will not be back till to-morrow?\"\n\n\"I wanted to see you, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"That is lucky, as here I am. You may be pretty sure to find me here\nany day in the year.\"\n\nAfter this there was a little pause. The archdeacon hardly knew how\nto begin his story. In the first place he was in doubt whether Lady\nLufton had ever heard of the preposterous match which his son had\nproposed to himself to make. In his anger at Plumstead he had felt\nsure that she knew all about it, and that she was assisting his son.\nBut this belief had dwindled as his anger had dwindled; and as the\nchaise had entered the parish of Framley he had told himself that\nit was quite impossible that she should know anything about it. Her\nmanner had certainly been altogether in her favour since he had been\nin her house. There had been nothing of the consciousness of guilt in\nher demeanour. But, nevertheless, there was the coincidence! How had\nit come to pass that Grace Crawley and his son should be at Framley\ntogether? It might, indeed, be just possible that Flurry might have\nbeen wrong, and that his son had not been there at all.\n\n\"I suppose Miss Crawley is at the parsonage?\" he said at last.\n\n\"Oh, yes; she is still there, and will remain there I should think\nfor the next ten days.\"\n\n\"Oh; I did not know,\" said the archdeacon very coldly.\n\nIt seemed to Lady Lufton, who was as innocent as an unborn babe\nin the matter of the projected marriage, that her old friend the\narchdeacon was in a mind to persecute the Crawleys. He had on a\nformer occasion taken upon himself to advise that Grace Crawley\nshould not be entertained at Framley, and now it seemed that he had\ncome all the way from Plumstead to say something further in the same\nstrain. Lady Lufton, if he had anything further to say of that kind,\nwould listen to him as a matter of course. She would listen to him\nand reply to him without temper. But she did not approve of it. She\ntold herself silently that she could not approve of persecution or of\ninterference. She therefore drew herself up, and pursed her mouth,\nand put on something of that look of severity which she could assume\nvery visibly, if it so pleased her.\n\n\"Yes; she is still there, and I think that her visit will do her a\ngreat deal of good,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"When we talk of doing good to people,\" said the archdeacon, \"we\noften make terrible mistakes. It so often happens that we don't know\nwhen we are doing good and when we are doing harm.\"\n\n\"That is true, of course, Dr. Grantly, and must be so necessarily,\nas our wisdom here below is so very limited. But I should think,--as\nfar as I can see, that is,--that the kindness which my friend Mrs.\nRobarts is showing to this young lady must be beneficial. You know,\narchdeacon, I explained to you before that I could not quite agree\nwith you in what you said as to leaving these people alone till after\nthe trial. I thought that help was necessary to them at once.\"\n\nThe archdeacon sighed deeply. He ought to have been somewhat\nrenovated in spirit by the tone in which Lady Lufton spoke to him,\nas it conveyed to him almost an absolute conviction that his first\nsuspicion was incorrect. But any comfort which might have come to him\nfrom this source was marred by the feeling that he must announce his\nown disgrace. At any rate he must do so, unless he were contented to\ngo back to Plumstead without having learned anything by his journey.\nHe changed the tone of his voice, however, and asked a question,--as\nit might be altogether on a different subject. \"I heard yesterday,\"\nhe said, \"that Henry was over here.\"\n\n\"He was here yesterday. He came the evening before, and dined and\nslept here, and went home yesterday morning.\"\n\n\"Was Miss Crawley with you that evening?\"\n\n\"Miss Crawley? No; she would not come. She thinks it best not to go\nout while her father is in his present unfortunate position; and she\nis right.\"\n\n\"She is quite right in that,\" said the archdeacon; and then he paused\nagain. He thought that it would be best for him to make a clean\nbreast of it, and to trust to Lady Lufton's sympathy. \"Did Henry go\nup to the parsonage?\" he asked.\n\nBut still Lady Lufton did not suspect the truth. \"I think he did,\"\nshe replied, with an air of surprise. \"I think I heard that he went\nup there to call on Mrs. Robarts after breakfast.\"\n\n\"No, Lady Lufton, he did not go up there to call on Mrs. Robarts. He\nwent up there because he is making a fool of himself about that Miss\nCrawley. That is the truth. Now you understand it all. I hope that\nMrs. Robarts does not know it. I do hope for her own sake that Mrs.\nRobarts does not know it.\"\n\nThe archdeacon certainly had no longer any doubt as to Lady Lufton's\ninnocence when he looked at her face as she heard these tidings. She\nhad predicted that Grace Crawley would \"make havoc,\" and could not,\ntherefore, be altogether surprised at the idea that some gentleman\nshould have fallen in love with her; but she had never supposed\nthat the havoc might be made so early in her days, or on so great a\nquarry. \"You don't mean to tell me that Henry Grantly is in love with\nGrace Crawley?\" she replied.\n\n\"I mean to say that he says he is.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, dear! I'm sure, archdeacon, that you will believe me\nwhen I say that I knew nothing about it.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure of that,\" said the archdeacon dolefully.\n\n\"Or I certainly should not have been glad to see him here. But the\nhouse, you know, is not mine, Dr. Grantly. I could have done nothing\nif I had known it. But only to think--; well, to be sure. She has not\nlost time, at any rate.\"\n\nNow this was not at all the light in which the archdeacon wished that\nthe matter should be regarded. He had been desirous that Lady Lufton\nshould be horror-stricken by the tidings, but it seemed to him that\nshe regarded the iniquity almost as a good joke. What did it matter\nhow young or how old the girl might be? She came of poor people,--of\npeople who had no friends,--of disgraced people; and Lady Lufton\nought to feel that such a marriage would be a terrible misfortune and\na terrible crime. \"I need hardly tell you, Lady Lufton,\" said the\narchdeacon, \"that I shall set my face against it as far as it is in\nmy power to do so.\"\n\n\"If they both be resolved I suppose you can hardly prevent it.\"\n\n\"Of course I cannot prevent it. Of course I cannot prevent it. If he\nwill break my heart and his mother's,--and his sister's,--of course\nI cannot prevent it. If he will ruin himself, he must have his own\nway.\"\n\n\"Ruin himself, Dr. Grantly!\"\n\n\"They will have enough to live upon,--somewhere in Spain or France.\"\nThe scorn expressed in the archdeacon's voice as he spoke of Pau as\nbeing \"somewhere in Spain or France,\" should have been heard to be\nunderstood. \"No doubt they will have enough to live upon.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that it will make a difference as to your own\nproperty, Dr. Grantly?\"\n\n\"Certainly it will, Lady Lufton. I told Henry when I first heard\nof the thing,--before he had definitely made any offer to the\ngirl,--that I should withdraw from him altogether the allowance that\nI now make him, if he married her. And I told him also, that if he\npersisted in his folly I should think it my duty to alter my will.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for that, Dr. Grantly.\"\n\n\"Sorry! And am not I sorry? Sorrow is no sufficient word. I am\nbroken-hearted. Lady Lufton, it is killing me. It is indeed. I love\nhim; I love him;--I love him as you have loved your son. But what is\nthe use? What can he be to me when he shall have married the daughter\nof such a man as that?\"\n\nLady Lufton sat for a while silent, thinking of a certain episode\nin her own life. There had been a time when her son was desirous\nof making a marriage which she had thought would break her heart.\nShe had for a time moved heaven and earth,--as far as she knew\nhow to move them,--to prevent the marriage. But at last she had\nyielded,--not from lack of power, for the circumstances had been such\nthat at the moment of yielding she had still the power in her hand of\nstaying the marriage,--but she had yielded because she had perceived\nthat her son was in earnest. She had yielded, and had kissed the\ndust; but from the moment in which her lips had so touched the\nground, she had taken great joy in the new daughter whom her son\nhad brought into the house. Since that she had learned to think\nthat young people might perhaps be right, and that old people might\nperhaps be wrong. This trouble of her friend the archdeacon's was\nvery like her own old trouble. \"And he is engaged to her now?\" she\nsaid, when those thoughts had passed through her mind.\n\n\"Yes;--that is, no. I am not sure. I do not know how to make myself\nsure.\"\n\n\"I am sure Major Grantly will tell you all the truth as it exists.\"\n\n\"Yes; he'll tell me the truth,--as far as he knows it. I do not see\nthat there is much anxiety to spare me in the matter. He is desirous\nrather of making me understand that I have no power of saving him\nfrom his own folly. Of course I have no power of saving him.\"\n\n\"But is he engaged to her?\"\n\n\"He says that she has refused him. But of course that means nothing.\"\n\nAgain the archdeacon's position was very like Lady Lufton's position,\nas it had existed before her son's marriage. In that case also the\nyoung lady, who was now Lady Lufton's own daughter and dearest\nfriend, had refused the lover who proposed to her, although the\nmarriage was so much to her advantage,--loving him, too, the while,\nwith her whole heart, as it was natural to suppose that Grace Crawley\nmight so love her lover. The more she thought of the similarity of\nthe stories, the stronger were her sympathies on the side of poor\nGrace. Nevertheless, she would comfort her old friend if she knew\nhow; and of course she could not but admit to herself that the match\nwas one which must be a cause of real sorrow to him. \"I don't know\nwhy her refusal should mean nothing,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"Of course a girl refuses at first,--a girl, I mean, in such\ncircumstances as hers. She can't but feel that more is offered to\nher than she ought to take, and that she is bound to go through the\nceremony of declining. But my anger is not with her, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"I do not see how it can be.\"\n\n\"No; it is not with her. If she becomes his wife I trust that I may\nnever see her.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dr. Grantly!\"\n\n\"I do; I do. How can it be otherwise with me? But I shall have no\nquarrel with her. With him I must quarrel.\"\n\n\"I do not see why,\" said Lady Lufton.\n\n\"You do not? Does he not set me at defiance?\"\n\n\"At his age surely a son has a right to marry as he pleases.\"\n\n\"If he took her out of the streets, then it would be the same?\" said\nthe archdeacon with bitter anger.\n\n\"No;--for such a one would herself be bad.\"\n\n\"Or if she were the daughter of a huxter out of the city?\"\n\n\"No again;--for in that case her want of education would probably\nunfit her for your society.\"\n\n\"Her father's disgrace, then, should be a matter of indifference to\nme, Lady Lufton?\"\n\n\"I did not say so. In the first place, her father is not\ndisgraced,--not as yet; and we do not know whether he may ever be\ndisgraced. You will hardly be disposed to say that persecution from\nthe palace disgraces a clergyman in Barsetshire.\"\n\n\"All the same, I believe that the man was guilty,\" said the\narchdeacon.\n\n\"Wait and see, my friend, before you condemn him altogether. But, be\nthat as it may, I acknowledge that the marriage is one which must\nnaturally be distasteful to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Lufton! if you only knew! If you only knew!\"\n\n\"I do know; and I feel for you. But I think that your son has a\nright to expect that you should not show the same repugnance to such\na marriage as this as you would have had a right to show had he\nsuggested to himself such a wife as those at which you just now\nhinted. Of course you can advise him, and make him understand your\nfeelings; but I cannot think you will be justified in quarrelling\nwith him, or in changing your views towards him as regards money,\nseeing that Miss Crawley is an educated lady, who has done nothing to\nforfeit your respect.\" A heavy cloud came upon the archdeacon's brow\nas he heard these words, but he did not make any immediate answer.\n\"Of course, my friend,\" continued Lady Lufton, \"I should not have\nventured to say so much to you, had you not come to me, as it were,\nfor my opinion.\"\n\n\"I came here because I thought Henry was here,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"If I have said too much I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"No; you have not said too much. It is not that. You and I are such\nold friends that either may say almost anything to the other.\"\n\n\"Yes;--just so. And therefore I have ventured to speak my mind,\" said\nLady Lufton.\n\n\"Of course;--and I am obliged to you. But, Lady Lufton, you do not\nunderstand yet how this hits me. Everything in life that I have done,\nI have done for my children. I am wealthy, but I have not used my\nwealth for myself, because I have desired that they should be able\nto hold their heads high in the world. All my ambition has been for\nthem, and all the pleasure which I have anticipated for myself in\nmy old age is that which I have hoped to receive from their credit.\nAs for Henry, he might have had anything he wanted from me in the\nway of money. He expressed a wish, a few months since, to go into\nParliament, and I promised to help him as far as ever I could go. I\nhave kept up the game altogether for him. He, the younger son of a\nworking parish parson, has had everything that could be given to the\neldest son of a country gentleman,--more than is given to the eldest\nson of many a peer. I have hoped that he would marry again, but I\nhave never cared that he should marry for money. I have been willing\nto do anything for him myself. But, Lady Lufton, a father does feel\nthat he should have some return for all this. No one can imagine\nthat Henry ever supposed that a bride from that wretched place at\nHogglestock could be welcomed among us. He knew that he would break\nour hearts, and he did not care for it. That is what I feel. Of\ncourse he has the power to do as he likes;--and of course I have the\npower to do as I like also with what is my own.\"\n\nLady Lufton was a very good woman, devoted to her duties,\naffectionate and just to those about her, truly religious, and\ncharitable from her nature; but I doubt whether the thorough\nworldliness of the archdeacon's appeal struck her as it will strike\nthe reader. People are so much more worldly in practice than they\nare in theory, so much keener after their own gratification in\ndetail than they are in the abstract, that the narrative of many an\nadventure would shock us, though the same adventure would not shock\nus in the action. One girl tells another how she has changed her mind\nin love; and the friend sympathizes with the friend, and perhaps\napplauds. Had the story been told in print, the friend who had\nlistened with equanimity would have read of such vacillation with\nindignation. She who vacillated herself would have hated her own\nperformance when brought before her judgment as a matter in which\nshe had no personal interest. Very fine things are written every day\nabout honesty and truth, and men read them with a sort of external\nconviction that a man, if he be anything of a man at all, is of\ncourse honest and true. But when the internal convictions are\nbrought out between two or three who are personally interested\ntogether,--between two or three who feel that their little gathering\nis, so to say, \"tiled,\"--those internal convictions differ very much\nfrom the external convictions. This man, in his confidences, asserts\nbroadly that he does not mean to be thrown over, and that man has a\nproject for throwing over somebody else; and the intention of each is\nthat scruples are not to stand in the way of his success. The \"Ruat\ncoelum, fiat justitia,\" was said, no doubt, from an outside balcony\nto a crowd, and the speaker knew that he was talking buncombe. The\n\"Rem, si possis recte, si non, quocunque modo,\" was whispered into\nthe ear in a club smoking-room, and the whisperer intended that his\nwords should prevail.\n\nLady Lufton had often heard her friend the archdeacon preach, and\nshe knew well the high tone which he could take as to the necessity\nof trusting to our hopes for the future for all our true happiness;\nand yet she sympathized with him when he told her that he was\nbroken-hearted because his son would take a step which might possibly\ninterfere with his worldly prosperity. Had the archdeacon been\npreaching about matrimony, he would have recommended young men, in\ntaking wives to themselves, especially to look for young women who\nfeared the Lord. But in talking about his own son's wife, no word\nas to her eligibility or non-eligibility in this respect escaped\nhis lips. Had he talked on the subject till nightfall no such word\nwould have been spoken. Had any friend of his own, man or woman,\nin discussing such a matter with him and asking his advice upon\nit, alluded to the fear of the Lord, the allusion would have been\ndistasteful to him and would have smacked to his palate of hypocrisy.\nLady Lufton, who understood as well as any woman what it was to be\n\"tiled\" with a friend, took all this in good part. The archdeacon\nhad spoken out of his heart what was in his heart. One of his\nchildren had married a marquis. Another might probably become\na bishop,--perhaps an archbishop. The third might be a county\nsquire,--high among county squires. But he could only so become\nby walking warily;--and now he was bent on marrying the penniless\ndaughter of an impoverished half-mad country curate, who was about to\nbe tried for stealing twenty pounds! Lady Lufton, in spite of all her\narguments, could not refuse her sympathy to her old friend.\n\n\"After all, from what you say, I suppose they are not engaged.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said the archdeacon. \"I cannot tell!\"\n\n\"And what do you wish me to do?\"\n\n\"Oh,--nothing. I came over, as I said before, because I thought\nhe was here. I think it right, before he has absolutely committed\nhimself, to take every means in my power to make him understand that\nI shall withdraw from him all pecuniary assistance,--now and for the\nfuture.\"\n\n\"My friend, that threat seems to me to be so terrible.\"\n\n\"It is the only power I have left to me.\"\n\n\"But you, who are so affectionate by nature, would never adhere to\nit.\"\n\n\"I will try. I will do my best to be firm. I will at once put\neverything beyond my control after my death.\" The archdeacon, as\nhe uttered these terrible words,--words which were awful to Lady\nLufton's ears,--resolved that he would endeavour to nurse his own\nwrath; but, at the same time, almost hated himself for his own\npusillanimity, because he feared that his wrath would die away before\nhe should have availed himself of its heat.\n\n\"I would do nothing rash of that kind,\" said Lady Lufton. \"Your\nobject is to prevent the marriage,--not to punish him for it when\nonce he has made it.\"\n\n\"He is not to have his own way in everything, Lady Lufton.\"\n\n\"But you should first try to prevent it.\"\n\n\"What can I do to prevent it?\"\n\nLady Lufton paused for a couple of minutes before she replied. She\nhad a scheme in her head, but it seemed to her to savour of cruelty.\nAnd yet at present it was her chief duty to assist her old friend,\nif any assistance could be given. There could hardly be a doubt that\nsuch a marriage as this, of which they were speaking, was in itself\nan evil. In her case, the case of her son, there had been no question\nof a trial, of money stolen, of aught that was in truth disgraceful.\n\"I think if I were you, Dr. Grantly,\" she said, \"that I would see the\nyoung lady while I was here.\"\n\n\"See her myself?\" said the archdeacon. The idea of seeing Grace\nCrawley himself had, up to this moment, never entered his head.\n\n\"I think I would do so.\"\n\n\"I think I will,\" said the archdeacon, after a pause. Then he got up\nfrom his chair. \"If I am to do it, I had better do it at once.\"\n\n\"Be gentle with her, my friend.\" The archdeacon paused again. He\ncertainly had entertained the idea of encountering Miss Crawley with\nseverity rather than gentleness. Lady Lufton rose from her seat, and\ncoming up to him, took one of his hands between her own two. \"Be\ngentle to her,\" she said. \"You have owned that she has done nothing\nwrong.\" The archdeacon bowed his head in token of assent and left the\nroom.\n\nPoor Grace Crawley!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nA DOUBLE PLEDGE.\n\n\nThe archdeacon, as he walked across from the Court to the parsonage,\nwas very thoughtful and his steps were very slow. This idea of seeing\nMiss Crawley herself had been suggested to him suddenly, and he had\nto determine how he would bear himself towards her, and what he would\nsay to her. Lady Lufton had beseeched him to be gentle with her. Was\nthe mission one in which gentleness would be possible? Must it not be\nhis object to make this young lady understand that she could not be\nright in desiring to come into his family and share in all his good\nthings when she had got no good things of her own,--nothing but evil\nthings to bring with her? And how could this be properly explained to\nthe young lady in gentle terms? Must he not be round with her, and\ngive her to understand in plain words,--the plainest which he could\nuse,--that she would not get his good things, though she would most\ncertainly impose the burden of all her evil things on the man whom\nshe was proposing to herself as a husband. He remembered very well as\nhe went, that he had been told that Miss Crawley had herself refused\nthe offer, feeling herself to be unfit for the honour tendered to\nher; but he suspected the sincerity of such a refusal. Calculating\nin his own mind the unreasonably great advantages which would be\nconferred on such a young lady as Miss Crawley by a marriage with\nhis son, he declared to himself that any girl must be very wicked\nindeed who should expect, or even accept, so much more than was her\ndue;--but nevertheless he could not bring himself to believe that\nany girl, when so tempted, would, in sincerity, decline to commit\nthis great wickedness. If he was to do any good by seeing Miss\nCrawley, must it not consist in a proper explanation to her of the\nselfishness, abomination, and altogether damnable blackness of such\nwickedness as this on the part of a young woman in her circumstances?\n\"Heaven and earth!\" he must say, \"here are you, without a penny in\nyour pocket, with hardly decent raiment on your back, with a thief\nfor your father, and you think that you are to come and share in\nall the wealth that the Grantlys have amassed, that you are to have\na husband with broad acres, a big house, and game preserves, and\nbecome one of a family whose name has never been touched by a single\naccusation,--no, not by a suspicion? No;--injustice such as that\nshall never be done betwixt you and me. You may wring my heart, and\nyou may ruin my son; but the broad acres and the big house, and the\ngame preserves, and the rest of it, shall never be your reward for\ndoing so.\" How was all that to be told effectively to a young woman\nin gentle words? And then how was a man in the archdeacon's position\nto be desirous of gentle words,--gentle words which would not be\nefficient,--when he knew well in his heart of hearts that he had\nnothing but his threats on which to depend. He had no more power of\ndisinheriting his own son for such an offence as that contemplated\nthan he had of blowing out his own brains, and he knew that it was\nso. He was a man incapable of such persistency of wrath against one\nwhom he loved. He was neither cruel enough nor strong enough to do\nsuch a thing. He could only threaten to do it, and make what best use\nhe might of threats, whilst threats might be of avail. In spite of\nall that he had said to his wife, to Lady Lufton, and to himself, he\nknew very well that if his son did sin in this way he, the father,\nwould forgive the sin of the son.\n\nIn going across from the front gate of the Court to the parsonage\nthere was a place where three roads met, and on this spot there stood\na finger-post. Round this finger-post there was now pasted a placard,\nwhich at once arrested the archdeacon's eye:--\"Cosby Lodge--Sale\nof furniture--Growing crops to be sold on the grounds. Three\nhunters. A brown gelding warranted for saddle or harness!\"--The\narchdeacon himself had given the brown gelding to his son, as a great\ntreasure.--\"Three Alderney cows, two cow-calves, a low phaeton, a\ngig, two ricks of hay.\" In this fashion were proclaimed in odious\ndetails all those comfortable additions to a gentleman's house in the\ncountry, with which the archdeacon was so well acquainted. Only last\nNovember he had recommended his son to buy a certain new-invented\nclod-crusher, and the clod-crusher had of course been bought. The\nbright blue paint upon it had not as yet given way to the stains of\nthe ordinary farmyard muck and mire;--and here was the clod-crusher\nadvertised for sale! The archdeacon did not want his son to leave\nCosby Lodge. He knew well enough that his son need not leave Cosby\nLodge. Why had the foolish fellow been in such a hurry with his\nhideous ill-conditioned advertisements? Gentle! How was he in such\ncircumstances to be gentle? He raised his umbrella and poked angrily\nat the disgusting notice. The iron ferule caught the paper at a chink\nin the post, and tore it from the top to the bottom. But what was the\nuse? A horrid ugly bill lying torn in such a spot would attract only\nmore attention than one fixed to a post. He could not condescend,\nhowever, to give to it further attention, but passed on up to the\nparsonage. Gentle, indeed!\n\nNevertheless Archdeacon Grantly was a gentleman, and never yet had\ndealt more harshly with any woman than we have sometimes seen him do\nwith his wife,--when he would say to her an angry word or two with\na good deal of marital authority. His wife, who knew well what his\nangry words were worth, never even suggested to herself that she had\ncause for complaint on that head. Had she known that the archdeacon\nwas about to undertake such a mission as this which he had now in\nhand, she would not have warned him to be gentle. She, indeed, would\nhave strongly advised him not to undertake the mission, cautioning\nhim that the young lady would probably get the better of him.\n\n\"Grace, my dear,\" said Mrs. Robarts, coming up into the nursery in\nwhich Miss Crawley was sitting with the children, \"come out here a\nmoment, will you?\" Then Grace left the children and went out into the\npassage. \"My dear, there is a gentleman in the drawing-room who asks\nto see you.\"\n\n\"A gentleman, Mrs. Robarts! What gentleman?\" But Grace, though she\nasked the question, conceived that the gentleman must be Henry\nGrantly. Her mind did not suggest to her the possibility of any other\ngentleman coming to see her.\n\n\"You must not be surprised, or allow yourself to be frightened.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Robarts, who is it?\"\n\n\"It is Major Grantly's father.\"\n\n\"The archdeacon?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear; Archdeacon Grantly. He is in the drawing-room.\"\n\n\"Must I see him, Mrs. Robarts?\"\n\n\"Well, Grace,--I think you must. I hardly know how you can refuse. He\nis an intimate friend of everybody here at Framley.\"\n\n\"What will he say to me?\"\n\n\"Nay; that I cannot tell. I suppose you know--\"\n\n\"He has come, no doubt, to bid me have nothing to say to his son. He\nneed not have troubled himself. But he may say what he likes. I am\nnot a coward, and I will go to him.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment, Grace. Come into my room for an instant. The children\nhave pulled your hair about.\" But Grace, though she followed Mrs.\nRobarts into the bedroom, would have nothing done to her hair. She\nwas too proud for that,--and we may say, also, too little confident\nin any good which such resources might effect on her behalf. \"Never\nmind about that,\" she said. \"What am I to say to him?\" Mrs. Robarts\npaused before she replied, feeling that the matter was one which\nrequired some deliberation. \"Tell me what I must say to him?\" said\nGrace, repeating her question.\n\n\"I hardly know what your own feelings are, my dear.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do. You do know. If I had all the world to give, I would\ngive it all to Major Grantly.\"\n\n\"Tell him that, then.\"\n\n\"No, I will not tell him that. Never mind about my frock, Mrs.\nRobarts. I do not care for that. I will tell him that I love his\nson and his granddaughter too well to injure them. I will tell him\nnothing else. I might as well go now.\" Mrs. Robarts, as she looked at\nGrace, was astonished at the serenity of her face. And yet when her\nhand was on the drawing-room door Grace hesitated, looked back, and\ntrembled. Mrs. Robarts blew a kiss to her from the stairs; and then\nthe door was opened, and the girl found herself in the presence of\nthe archdeacon. He was standing on the rug, with his back to the\nfire, and his heavy ecclesiastical hat was placed on the middle of\nthe round table. The hat caught Grace's eye at the moment of her\nentrance, and she felt that all the thunders of the Church were\ncontained within it. And then the archdeacon himself was so big and\nso clerical, and so imposing! Her father's aspect was severe, but the\nseverity of her father's face was essentially different from that\nexpressed by the archdeacon. Whatever impression came from her father\ncame from the man himself. There was no outward adornment there;\nthere was, so to say, no wig about Mr. Crawley. Now the archdeacon\nwas not exactly adorned; but he was so thoroughly imbued with high\nclerical belongings and sacerdotal fitnesses as to appear always as\na walking, sitting, or standing impersonation of parsondom. To poor\nGrace, as she entered the room, he appeared to be an impersonation of\nparsondom in its severest aspect.\n\n\"Miss Crawley, I believe?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said she, curtseying ever so slightly, as she stood\nbefore him at some considerable distance.\n\nHis first idea was that his son must be indeed a fool if he was going\nto give up Cosby Lodge and all Barsetshire, and retire to Pau, for so\nslight and unattractive a creature as he now saw before him. But this\nidea stayed with him only for a moment. As he continued to gaze at\nher during the interview he came to perceive that there was very\nmuch more than he had perceived at the first glance, and that his\nson, after all, had had eyes to see, though perhaps not a heart to\nunderstand.\n\n\"Will you not take a chair?\" he said. Then Grace sat down, still at\na distance from the archdeacon, and he kept his place upon the rug.\nHe felt that there would be a difficulty in making her feel the\nfull force of his eloquence all across the room; and yet he did\nnot know how to bring himself nearer to her. She became suddenly\nvery important in his eyes, and he was to some extent afraid of\nher. She was so slight, so meek, so young; and yet there was about\nher something so beautifully feminine,--and, withal, so like a\nlady,--that he felt instinctively that he could not attack her with\nharsh words. Had her lips been full, and her colour high, and had\nher eyes rolled, had she put forth against him any of that ordinary\nartillery with which youthful feminine batteries are charged, he\nwould have been ready to rush to the combat. But this girl, about\nwhom his son had gone mad, sat there as passively as though she\nwere conscious of the possession of no artillery. There was not a\nsingle gun fired from beneath her eyelids. He knew not why, but he\nrespected his son now more than he had respected him for the last two\nmonths;--more, perhaps, than he had ever respected him before. He was\nas eager as ever against the marriage;--but in thinking of his son in\nwhat he said and did after these few first moments of the interview,\nhe ceased to think of him with contempt. The creature before him was\na woman who grew in his opinion till he began to feel that she was in\ntruth fit to be the wife of his son--if only she were not a pauper,\nand the daughter of a mad curate, and, alas! too probably, of a\nthief. Though his feeling towards the girl was changed, his duty to\nhimself, his family, and his son, was the same as ever, and therefore\nhe began his task.\n\n\"Perhaps you had not expected to see me?\" he said.\n\n\"No, indeed, sir.\"\n\n\"Nor had I intended when I came over here to call on my old friend,\nLady Lufton, to come up to this house. But as I knew that you were\nhere, Miss Crawley, I thought that upon the whole it would be better\nthat I should see you.\" Then he paused as though he expected that\nGrace would say something; but Grace had nothing to say. \"Of course\nyou must understand, Miss Crawley, that I should not venture to speak\nto you on this subject unless I myself were very closely interested\nin it.\" He had not yet said what was the subject, and it was not\nprobable that Grace should give him any assistance by affecting to\nunderstand this without direct explanation from him. She sat quite\nmotionless, and did not even aid him by showing by her altered colour\nthat she understood his purpose. \"My son has told me,\" said he, \"that\nhe has professed an attachment for you, Miss Crawley.\"\n\nThen there was another pause, and Grace felt that she was compelled\nto say something. \"Major Grantly has been very good to me,\" she said,\nand then she hated herself for having uttered words which were so\ntame and unwomanly in their spirit. Of course her lover's father\nwould despise her for having so spoken. After all it did not much\nsignify. If he would only despise her and go away, it would perhaps\nbe for the best.\n\n\"I do not know about being good,\" said the archdeacon. \"I think he is\ngood. I think he means to be good.\"\n\n\"I am sure he is good,\" said Grace, warmly.\n\n\"You know he has a daughter, Miss Crawley?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I know Edith well.\"\n\n\"Of course his first duty is to her. Is it not? And he owes much to\nhis family. Do you not feel that?\"\n\n\"Of course I feel it, sir.\" The poor girl had always heard Dr.\nGrantly spoken of as the archdeacon, but she did not in the least\nknow what she ought to call him.\n\n\"Now, Miss Crawley, pray listen to me; I will speak to you very\nopenly. I must speak to you openly, because it is my duty on my son's\nbehalf--but I will endeavour to speak to you kindly also. Of yourself\nI have heard nothing but what is favourable, and there is no reason\nas yet why I should not respect and esteem you.\" Grace told herself\nthat she would do nothing which ought to forfeit his respect and\nesteem, but that she did not care two straws whether his respect and\nesteem were bestowed on her or not. She was striving after something\nvery different from that. \"If my son were to marry you, he would\ngreatly injure himself, and would very greatly injure his child.\"\nAgain he paused. He had told her to listen, and she was resolved that\nshe would listen,--unless he should say something which might make a\nword from her necessary at the moment. \"I do not know whether there\ndoes at present exist any engagement between you?\"\n\n\"There is no engagement, sir.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that,--very glad of it. I do not know whether you are\naware that my son is dependent upon me for the greater part of his\nincome. It is so, and as I am so circumstanced with my son, of course\nI feel the closest possible concern in his future prospects.\" The\narchdeacon did not know how to explain clearly why the fact of his\nmaking a son an annual allowance should give him a warmer interest\nin his son's affairs than he might have had had the major been\naltogether independent of him; but he trusted that Grace would\nunderstand this by her own natural lights. \"Now, Miss Crawley, of\ncourse I cannot wish to say a word that shall hurt your feelings. But\nthere are reasons--\"\n\n\"I know,\" said she, interrupting him. \"Papa is accused of stealing\nmoney. He did not steal it, but people think he did. And then we are\nso very poor.\"\n\n\"You do understand me then,--and I feel grateful; I do indeed.\"\n\n\"I don't think our being poor ought to signify a bit,\" said Grace.\n\"Papa is a gentleman and a clergyman, and mamma is a lady.\"\n\n\"But, my dear--\"\n\n\"I know I ought not to be your son's wife as long as people think\nthat papa stole the money. If he had stolen it, I ought never to be\nMajor Grantly's wife,--or anybody's wife. I know that very well. And\nas for Edith,--I would sooner die than do anything that would be bad\nto her.\"\n\nThe archdeacon had now left the rug, and advanced till he was\nalmost close to the chair on which Grace was sitting. \"My dear,\" he\nsaid, \"what you say does you very much honour,--very much honour\nindeed.\" Now that he was close to her, he could look into her\neyes, and he could see the exact form of her features, and could\nunderstand,--could not help understanding,--the character of her\ncountenance. It was a noble face, having in it nothing that was poor,\nnothing that was mean, nothing that was shapeless. It was a face that\npromised infinite beauty, with a promise that was on the very verge\nof fulfilment. There was a play about her mouth as she spoke, and a\ncurl in her nostril as the eager words came from her, which almost\nmade the selfish father give way. Why had they not told him that\nshe was such a one as this? Why had not Henry himself spoken of the\nspeciality of her beauty? No man in England knew better than the\narchdeacon the difference between beauty of one kind and beauty\nof another kind in a woman's face,--the one beauty, which comes\nfrom health and youth and animal spirits, and which belongs to the\nmiller's daughter, and the other beauty, which shows itself in fine\nlines and a noble spirit,--the beauty which comes from breeding.\n\"What you say does you very much honour indeed,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"I should not mind at all about being poor,\" said Grace.\n\n\"No; no; no,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"Poor as we are,--and no clergyman, I think, ever was so poor,--I\nshould have done as your son asked me at once, if it had been only\nthat,--because I love him.\"\n\n\"If you love him you will not wish to injure him.\"\n\n\"I will not injure him. Sir, there is my promise.\" And now as she\nspoke she rose from her chair, and standing close to the archdeacon,\nlaid her hand very lightly on the sleeve of his coat. \"There is my\npromise. As long as people say that papa stole the money, I will\nnever marry your son. There.\"\n\nThe archdeacon was still looking down at her, and feeling the slight\ntouch of her fingers, raised his arm a little as though to welcome\nthe pressure. He looked into her eyes, which were turned eagerly\ntowards his, and when doing so was quite sure that the promise would\nbe kept. It would have been sacrilege,--he felt that it would have\nbeen sacrilege,--to doubt such a promise. He almost relented. His\nsoft heart, which was never very well under his own control, gave\nway so far that he was nearly moved to tell her that, on his son's\nbehalf, he acquitted her of the promise. What could any man's son do\nbetter than have such a woman for his wife? It would have been of no\navail had he made her such offer. The pledge she had given had not\nbeen wrung from her by his influence, nor could his influence have\navailed aught with her towards the alteration of her purpose. It was\nnot the archdeacon who had taught her that it would not be her duty\nto take disgrace into the house of the man she loved. As he looked\ndown upon her face two tears formed themselves in his eyes, and\ngradually trickled down his old nose. \"My dear,\" he said, \"if this\ncloud passes away from you, you shall come to us and be my daughter.\"\nAnd thus he also pledged himself. There was a dash of generosity\nabout the man, in spite of his selfishness, which always made him\ndesirous of giving largely to those who gave largely to him. He would\nfain that his gifts should be the bigger, if it were possible. He\nlonged at this moment to tell her that the dirty cheque should go for\nnothing. He would have done it, I think, but that it was impossible\nfor him so to speak in her presence of that which moved her so\ngreatly.\n\nHe had contrived that her hand should fall from his arm into his\ngrasp, and now for a moment he held it. \"You are a good girl,\" he\nsaid--\"a dear, dear, good girl. When this cloud has passed away, you\nshall come to us and be our daughter.\"\n\n\"But it will never pass away,\" said Grace.\n\n[Illustration: \"But it will never pass away,\" said Grace.]\n\n\"Let us hope that it may. Let us hope that it may.\" Then he stooped\nover her and kissed her, and leaving the room, got out into the hall\nand thence into the garden, and so away, without saying a word of\nadieu to Mrs. Robarts.\n\nAs he walked across to the Court, whither he was obliged to go,\nbecause of his chaise, he was lost in surprise at what had occurred.\nHe had gone to the parsonage, hating the girl, and despising his son.\nNow, as he retraced his steps, his feelings were altogether changed.\nHe admired the girl,--and as for his son, even his anger was for the\nmoment altogether gone. He would write to his son at once and implore\nhim to stop the sale. He would tell his son all that had occurred, or\nrather would make Mrs. Grantly do so. In respect to his son he was\nquite safe. He thought at that moment that he was safe. There would\nbe no use in hurling further threats at him. If Crawley were found\nguilty of stealing the money, there was the girl's promise. If he\nwere acquitted, there was his own pledge. He remembered perfectly\nwell that the girl had said more than this,--that she had not\nconfined her assurance to the verdict of a jury, that she had\nprotested that she would not accept Major Grantly's hand as long\nas people thought that her father had stolen the cheque; but the\narchdeacon felt that it would be ignoble to hold her closely to her\nwords. The event, according to his ideas of the compact, was to\ndepend upon the verdict of the jury. If the jury should find Mr.\nCrawley not guilty, all objection on his part to the marriage was to\nbe withdrawn. And he would keep his word! In such case it should be\nwithdrawn.\n\nWhen he came to the rags of the auctioneer's bill, which he had\nbefore torn down with his umbrella, he stopped a moment to consider\nhow he would act at once. In the first place he would tell his son\nthat his threats were withdrawn, and would ask him to remain at Cosby\nLodge. He would write the letter as he passed through Barchester,\non his way home, so that his son might receive it on the following\nmorning; and he would refer the major to his mother for a full\nexplanation of the circumstances. Those odious bills must be removed\nfrom every barn-door and wall in the county. At the present moment\nhis anger against his son was chiefly directed against his ill-judged\nhaste in having put up those ill-omened posters. Then he paused to\nconsider what must be his wish as to the verdict of the jury. He had\npledged himself to abide by the verdict, and he could not but have a\nwish on the subject. Could he desire in his heart that Mr. Crawley\nshould be found guilty? He stood still for a moment thinking of this,\nand then he walked on, shaking his head. If it might be possible he\nwould have no wish on the subject whatsoever.\n\n\"Well!\" said Lady Lufton, stopping him in the passage,--\"have you\nseen her?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have seen her.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"She is a good girl,--a very good girl. I am in a great hurry, and\nhardly know how to tell you more now.\"\n\n\"You say that she is a good girl?\"\n\n\"I say that she is a very good girl. An angel could not have behaved\nbetter. I will tell you all some day, Lady Lufton, but I can hardly\ntell you now.\"\n\nWhen the archdeacon was gone old Lady Lufton confided to young Lady\nLufton her very strong opinion that many months would not be gone by\nbefore Grace Crawley would be the mistress of Cosby Lodge. \"It will\nbe great promotion,\" said the old lady, with a little toss of her\nhead.\n\nWhen Grace was interrogated afterwards by Mrs. Robarts as to what\nhad passed between her and the archdeacon she had very little to\nsay as to the interview. \"No, he did not scold me,\" she replied to\nan inquiry from her friend. \"But he spoke about your engagement?\"\nsaid Mrs. Robarts. \"There is no engagement,\" said Grace. \"But I\nsuppose you acknowledged, my dear, that a future engagement is\nquite possible?\" \"I told him, Mrs. Robarts,\" Grace answered, after\nhesitating for a moment, \"that I would never marry his son as long\nas papa was suspected by any one in the world of being a thief. And\nI will keep my word.\" But she said nothing to Mrs. Robarts of the\npledge which the archdeacon had made to her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nTHE CROSS-GRAINEDNESS OF MEN.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBy the time that the archdeacon reached Plumstead his enthusiasm in\nfavour of Grace Crawley had somewhat cooled itself; and the language\nwhich from time to time he prepared for conveying his impressions to\nhis wife, became less fervid as he approached his home. There was his\npledge, and by that he would abide;--and so much he would make both\nhis wife and his son understand. But any idea which he might have\nentertained for a moment of extending the promise he had given and\nrelaxing that given to him was gone before he saw his own chimneys.\nIndeed, I fear he had by that time begun to feel that the only\nsalvation now open to him must come from the jury's verdict. If the\njury should declare Mr. Crawley to be guilty, then--; he would not\nsay even to himself that in such case all would be right, but he did\nfeel that much as he might regret the fate of the poor Crawleys, and\nof the girl whom in his warmth he had declared to be almost an angel,\nnevertheless to him personally such a verdict would bring consolatory\ncomfort.\n\n\"I have seen Miss Crawley,\" he said to his wife, as soon as he had\nclosed the door of his study, before he had been two minutes out of\nthe chaise. He had determined that he would dash at the subject at\nonce, and he thus carried his resolution into effect.\n\n\"You have seen Grace Crawley?\"\n\n\"Yes; I went up to the parsonage and called upon her. Lady Lufton\nadvised me to do so.\"\n\n\"And Henry?\"\n\n\"Oh, Henry has gone. He was only there one night. I suppose he saw\nher, but I am not sure.\"\n\n\"Would not Miss Crawley tell you?\"\n\n\"I forgot to ask her.\" Mrs. Grantly, at hearing this, expressed her\nsurprise by opening wide her eyes. He had gone all the way over to\nFramley on purpose to look after his son, and learn what were his\ndoings, and when there he had forgotten to ask the person who could\nhave given him better information than any one else! \"But it does not\nsignify,\" continued the archdeacon; \"she said enough to me to make\nthat of no importance.\"\n\n\"And what did she say?\"\n\n\"She said that she would never consent to marry Henry as long as\nthere was any suspicion abroad as to her father's guilt.\"\n\n\"And you believe her promise?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do; I do not doubt it in the least. I put implicit\nconfidence in her. And I have promised her that if her father is\nacquitted,--I will withdraw my opposition.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"But I have. And you would have done the same had you been there.\"\n\n\"I doubt that, my dear. I am not so impulsive as you are.\"\n\n\"You could not have helped yourself. You would have felt yourself\nobliged to be equally generous with her. She came up to me and she\nput her hand upon me--\" \"Psha!\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"But she did, my\ndear; and then she said, 'I promise you that I will not become your\nson's wife while people think that papa stole this money.' What else\ncould I do?\"\n\n\"And is she pretty?\"\n\n\"Very pretty; very beautiful.\"\n\n\"And like a lady?\"\n\n\"Quite like a lady. There is no mistake about that.\"\n\n\"And she behaved well?\"\n\n\"Admirably,\" said the archdeacon, who was in a measure compelled\nto justify the generosity into which he had been betrayed by his\nfeelings.\n\n\"Then she is a paragon,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"I don't know what you may call a paragon, my dear. I say that she is\na lady, and that she is extremely good-looking, and that she behaved\nvery well. I cannot say less in her favour. I am sure you would not\nsay less yourself, if you had been present.\"\n\n\"She must be a wonderful young woman.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about her being wonderful.\"\n\n\"She must be wonderful when she has succeeded both with the son and\nwith the father.\"\n\n\"I wish you had been there instead of me,\" said the archdeacon,\nangrily. Mrs. Grantly very probably wished so also, feeling that in\nthat case a more serene mode of business would have been adopted.\nHow keenly susceptible the archdeacon still was to the influences of\nfeminine charms, no one knew better than Mrs. Grantly, and whenever\nshe became aware that he had been in this way seduced from the wisdom\nof his cooler judgment she always felt something akin to indignation\nagainst the seducer. As for her husband, she probably told herself at\nsuch moments that he was an old goose. \"If you had been there, and\nHenry with you, you would have made a great deal worse job of it than\nI have done,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"I don't say you have made a bad job of it, my dear,\" said Mrs.\nGrantly. \"But it's past eight, and you must be terribly in want of\nyour dinner. Had you not better go up and dress?\"\n\nIn the evening the plan of the future campaign was arranged between\nthem. The archdeacon would not write to his son at all. In passing\nthrough Barchester he had abandoned his idea of despatching a note\nfrom the hotel, feeling that such a note as would be required was\nnot easily written in a hurry. Mrs. Grantly would now write to her\nson, telling him that circumstances had changed, that it would be\naltogether unnecessary for him to sell his furniture, and begging\nhim to come over and see his father without a day's delay. She wrote\nher letter that night, and read to the archdeacon all that she had\nwritten,--with the exception of the postscript:--\"You may be quite\nsure that there will be no unpleasantness with your father.\" That was\nthe postscript which was not communicated to the archdeacon.\n\nOn the third day after that Henry Grantly did come over to Plumstead.\nHis mother in her letter to him had not explained how it had come to\npass that the sale of his furniture would be unnecessary. His father\nhad given him to understand distinctly that his income would be\nwithdrawn from him unless he would express his intention of giving\nup Miss Crawley; and it had been admitted among them all that Cosby\nLodge must be abandoned if this were done. He certainly would not\ngive up Grace Crawley. Sooner than that, he would give up every\nstick in his possession, and go and live in New Zealand if it were\nnecessary. Not only had Grace's conduct to him made him thus firm,\nbut the natural bent of his own disposition had tended that way also.\nHis father had attempted to dictate to him, and sooner than submit to\nthat he would sell the coat off his back. Had his father confined his\nopposition to advice, and had Miss Crawley been less firm in her view\nof her duty, the major might have been less firm also. But things\nhad so gone that he was determined to be fixed as granite. If others\nwould not be moved from their resolves, neither would he. Such being\nthe state of his mind, he could not understand why he was thus\nsummoned to Plumstead. He had already written over to Pau about his\nhouse, and it was well that he should, at any rate, see his mother\nbefore he started. He was willing, therefore, to go to Plumstead, but\nhe took no steps as to the withdrawal of those auctioneer's bills to\nwhich the archdeacon so strongly objected. When he drove into the\nrectory yard, his father was standing there before him. \"Henry,\" he\nsaid, \"I am very glad to see you. I am very much obliged to you for\ncoming.\" Then Henry got out of his cart and shook hands with his\nfather, and the archdeacon began to talk about the weather. \"Your\nmother has gone into Barchester to see your grandfather,\" said the\narchdeacon. \"If you are not tired, we might as well take a walk.\nI want to go up as far as Flurry's cottage.\" The major of course\ndeclared that he was not at all tired, and that he should be\ndelighted of all things to go up and see old Flurry, and thus they\nstarted. Young Grantly had not even been into the house before he\nleft the yard with his father. Of course, he was thinking of the\ncoming sale at Cosby Lodge, and of his future life at Pau, and of his\ninjured position in the world. There would be no longer any occasion\nfor him to be solicitous as to the Plumstead foxes. Of course these\nthings were in his mind; but he could not begin to speak of them till\nhis father did so. \"I'm afraid your grandfather is not very strong,\"\nsaid the archdeacon, shaking his head. \"I fear he won't be with us\nvery long.\"\n\n\"Is it so bad as that, sir?\"\n\n\"Well, you know, he is an old man, Henry; and he was always somewhat\nold for his age. He will be eighty, if he lives two years longer,\nI think. But he'll never reach eighty;--never. You must go and see\nhim before you go back home; you must indeed.\" The major, of course,\npromised that he would see his grandfather, and the archdeacon told\nhis son how nearly the old man had fallen in the passage between the\ncathedral and the deanery. In this way they had nearly made their way\nup to the gamekeeper's cottage without a word of reference to any\nsubject that touched upon the matter of which each of them was of\ncourse thinking. Whether the major intended to remain at home or to\nlive at Pau, the subject of Mr. Harding's health was a natural topic\nfor conversation between him and his father; but when his father\nstopped suddenly, and began to tell him how a fox had been trapped on\nDarvell's farm,--\"and of course it was a Plumstead fox,--there can be\nno doubt that Flurry is right about that;\"--when the archdeacon spoke\nof this iniquity with much warmth, and told his son how he had at\nonce written off to Mr. Thorne of Ullathorne, and how Mr. Thorne\nhad declared that he didn't believe a word of it, and how Flurry\nhad produced the pad of the fox, with the marks of the trap on the\nskin,--then the son began to feel that the ground was becoming very\nwarm, and that he could not go on much longer without rushing into\ndetails about Grace Crawley. \"I've no more doubt that it was one of\nour foxes than that I stand here,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"It doesn't matter where the fox was bred. It shouldn't have been\ntrapped,\" said the major.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the archdeacon, indignantly. I wonder whether\nhe would have been so keen had a Romanist priest come into his\nparish, and turned one of his Protestants into a Papist?\n\nThen Flurry came up, and produced the identical pad out of his\npocket. \"I don't suppose it was intended,\" said the major, looking\nat the interesting relic with scrutinizing eyes. \"I suppose it was\ncaught in a rabbit-trap,--eh, Flurry?\"\n\n\"I don't see what right a man has with traps at all, when gentlemen\nis particular about their foxes,\" said Flurry. \"Of course they'd call\nit rabbits.\"\n\n\"I never liked that man on Darvell's farm,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"Nor I either,\" said Flurry. \"No farmer ought to be on that land\nwho don't have a horse of his own. And if I war Squire Thorne, I\nwouldn't have no farmer there who didn't keep no horse. When a farmer\nhas a horse of his own, and follies the hounds, there ain't no\nrabbit-traps;--never. How does that come about, Mr. Henry? Rabbits! I\nknow very well what rabbits is!\"\n\nMr. Henry shook his head, and turned away, and the archdeacon\nfollowed him. There was an hypocrisy about this pretended care for\nthe foxes which displeased the major. He could not, of course, tell\nhis father that the foxes were no longer anything to him; but yet\nhe must make it understood that such was his conviction. His mother\nhad written to him, saying that the sale of furniture need not take\nplace. It might be all very well for his mother to say that, or for\nhis father; but, after what had taken place, he could consent to\nremain in England on no other understanding than that his income\nshould be made permanent to him. Such permanence must not be any\nlonger dependent on his father's caprice. In these days he had come\nto be somewhat in love with poverty and Pau, and had been feeding on\nthe luxury of his grievance. There is, perhaps, nothing so pleasant\nas the preparation for self-sacrifice. To give up Cosby Lodge and\nthe foxes, to marry a penniless wife, and go and live at Pau on six\nor seven hundred a year, seemed just now to Major Grantly to be a\nfine thing, and he did not intend to abandon this fine thing without\nreceiving a very clear reason for doing so. \"I can't quite understand\nThorne,\" said the archdeacon. \"He used to be so particular about the\nfoxes, and I don't suppose that a country gentleman will change his\nideas because he has given up hunting himself.\"\n\n\"Mr. Thorne never thought much of Flurry,\" said Henry Grantly, with\nhis mind intent upon Pau and his grievance.\n\n\"He might take my word at any rate,\" said the archdeacon.\n\nIt was a known fact that the archdeacon's solicitude about the\nPlumstead covers was wholly on behalf of his son the major. The major\nhimself knew this thoroughly, and felt that his father's present\nspecial anxiety was intended as a corroboration of the tidings\nconveyed in his mother's letter. Every word so uttered was meant\nto have reference to his son's future residence in the country.\n\"Father,\" he said, turning round shortly, and standing before the\narchdeacon in the pathway, \"I think you are quite right about the\ncovers. I feel sure that every gentleman who preserves a fox does\ngood to the country. I am sorry that I shall not have a closer\ninterest in the matter myself.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't you have a closer interest in it?\" said the\narchdeacon.\n\n\"Because I shall be living abroad.\"\n\n\"You got your mother's letter?\"\n\n\"Yes; I got my mother's letter.\"\n\n\"Did she not tell you that you can stay where you are?\"\n\n\"Yes, she said so. But, to tell you the truth, sir, I do not like the\nrisk of living beyond my assured income.\" \"But if I justify it?\"\n\n\"I do not wish to complain, sir, but you have made me understand that\nyou can, and that in certain circumstances you will, at a moment,\nwithdraw what you give me. Since this was said to me, I have felt\nmyself to be unsafe in such a house as Cosby Lodge.\"\n\nThe archdeacon did not know how to explain. He had intended that\nthe real explanation should be given by Mrs. Grantly, and had been\nanxious to return to his old relations with his son without any exact\nterms on his own part. But his son was, as he thought, awkward, and\nwould drive him to some speech that was unnecessary. \"You need not be\nunsafe there at all,\" he said, half angrily.\n\n\"I must be unsafe if I am not sure of my income.\"\n\n\"Your income is not in any danger. But you had better speak to your\nmother about it. For myself, I think I may say that I have never yet\nbehaved to any of you with harshness. A son should, at any rate,\nnot be offended because a father thinks that he is entitled to some\nconsideration for what he does.\"\n\n\"There are some points on which a son cannot give way even to his\nfather, sir.\"\n\n\"You had better speak to your mother, Henry. She will explain to you\nwhat has taken place. Look at that plantation. You don't remember it,\nbut every tree there was planted since you were born. I bought that\nfarm from old Mr. Thorne, when he was purchasing St. Ewold's Downs,\nand it was the first bit of land I ever had of my own.\"\n\n\"That is not in Plumstead, I think?\"\n\n\"No: this is Plumstead, where we stand, but that's in Eiderdown. The\nparishes run in and out here. I never bought any other land as cheap\nas I bought that.\"\n\n\"And did old Thorne make a good purchase at St. Ewold's?\"\n\n\"Yes, I fancy he did. It gave him the whole of the parish, which was\na great thing. It is astonishing how land has risen in value since\nthat, and yet rents are not so very much higher. They who buy land\nnow can't have above two-and-a-half for their money.\"\n\n\"I wonder people are so fond of land,\" said the major.\n\n\"It is a comfortable feeling to know that you stand on your own\nground. Land is about the only thing that can't fly away. And then,\nyou see, land gives so much more than the rent. It gives position and\ninfluence and political power, to say nothing about the game. We'll\ngo back now. I daresay your mother will be at home by this time.\"\n\nThe archdeacon was striving to teach a great lesson to his son when\nhe thus spoke of the pleasure which a man feels when he stands upon\nhis own ground. He was bidding his son to understand how great was\nthe position of an heir to a landed property, and how small the\nposition of a man depending on what Dr. Grantly himself would have\ncalled a scratch income,--an income made up of a few odds and ends,\na share or two in this company and a share or two in that, a slight\nventure in foreign stocks, a small mortgage and such like convenient\nbut uninfluential driblets. A man, no doubt, may live at Pau on\ndriblets; may pay his way and drink his bottle of cheap wine, and\nenjoy life after a fashion while reading Galignani and looking at the\nmountains. But,--as it seemed to the archdeacon,--when there was a\nchoice between this kind of thing, and fox-covers at Plumstead, and a\nseat among the magistrates of Barsetshire, and an establishment full\nof horses, beeves, swine, carriages, and hayricks, a man brought up\nas his son had been brought up ought not to be very long in choosing.\nIt never entered into the archdeacon's mind that he was tempting his\nson; but Henry Grantly felt that he was having the good things of the\nworld shown to him, and that he was being told that they should be\nhis--for a consideration.\n\nThe major, in his present mood, looked at the matter from his own\npoint of view, and determined that the consideration was too high.\nHe was pledged not to give up Grace Crawley, and he would not yield\non that point, though he might be tempted by all the fox-covers in\nBarsetshire. At this moment he did not know how far his father was\nprepared to yield, or how far it was expected that he should yield\nhimself. He was told that he had to speak to his mother. He would\nspeak to his mother, but, in the meantime, he could not bring himself\nto make a comfortable answer to his father's eloquent praise of\nlanded property. He could not allow himself to be enthusiastic on the\nmatter till he knew what was expected of him if he chose to submit to\nbe made a British squire. At present Galignani and the mountains had\ntheir charms for him. There was, therefore, but little conversation\nbetween the father and the son as they walked back to the rectory.\n\nLate that night the major heard the whole story from his mother.\nGradually, and as though unintentionally, Mrs. Grantly told him all\nshe knew of the archdeacon's visit to Framley. Mrs. Grantly was quite\nas anxious as was her husband to keep her son at home, and therefore\nshe omitted in her story those little sneers against Grace which she\nherself had been tempted to make by the archdeacon's fervour in the\ngirl's favour. The major said as little as was possible while he was\nbeing told of his father's adventure, and expressed neither anger\nnor satisfaction till he had been made thoroughly to understand that\nGrace had pledged herself not to marry him as long as any suspicion\nshould rest upon her father's name.\n\n\"Your father is quite satisfied with her,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"He\nthinks that she is behaving very well.\"\n\n\"My father had no right to exact such a pledge.\"\n\n\"But she made it of her own accord. She was the first to speak about\nMr. Crawley's supposed guilt. Your father never mentioned it.\"\n\n\"He must have led to it; and I think he had no right to do so. He had\nno right to go to her at all.\"\n\n\"Now don't be foolish, Henry.\"\n\n\"I don't see that I am foolish.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are. A man is foolish if he won't take what he wants\nwithout asking exactly how he is to come by it. That your father\nshould be anxious is the most natural thing in the world. You know\nhow high he has always held his own head, and how much he thinks\nabout the characters and position of clergymen. It is not surprising\nthat he should dislike the idea of such a marriage.\"\n\n\"Grace Crawley would disgrace no family,\" said the lover.\n\n\"That's all very well for you to say, and I'll take your word that it\nis so;--that is as far as the young lady goes herself. And there's\nyour father almost as much in love with her as you are. I don't know\nwhat you would have?\"\n\n\"I would be left alone.\"\n\n\"But what harm has been done you? From what you yourself have told\nme, I know that Miss Crawley has said the same thing to you that she\nhas said to your father. You can't but admire her for the feeling.\"\n\n\"I admire her for everything.\"\n\n\"Very well. We don't say anything against that.\"\n\n\"And I don't mean to give her up.\"\n\n\"Very well again. Let us hope that Mr. Crawley will be acquitted, and\nthen all will be right. Your father never goes back from his promise.\nHe is always better than his word. You'll find that if Mr. Crawley\nis acquitted, or if he escapes in any way, your father will only be\nhappy of an excuse to make much of the young lady. You should not be\nhard on him, Henry. Don't you see that it is his one great desire to\nkeep you near to him? The sight of those odious bills nearly broke\nhis heart.\"\n\n\"Then why did he threaten me?\"\n\n\"Henry, you are obstinate.\"\n\n\"I am not obstinate, mother.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are. You remember nothing, and you forget nothing. You\nexpect everything to be made smooth for you, and will do nothing\ntowards making things smooth for anybody else. You ought to promise\nto give up the sale. If the worst came to the worst, your father\nwould not let you suffer in pocket for yielding to him in so much.\"\n\n\"If the worst comes to the worst, I wish to take nothing from my\nfather.\"\n\n\"You won't put off the sale, then?\"\n\nThe son paused a moment before he answered his mother, thinking over\nall the circumstances of his position. \"I cannot do so as long as I\nam subject to my father's threat,\" he said at last. \"What took place\nbetween my father and Miss Crawley can go for nothing with me. He has\ntold me that his allowance to me is to be withdrawn. Let him tell me\nthat he has reconsidered the matter.\"\n\n\"But he has not withdrawn it. The last quarter was paid to your\naccount only the other day. He does not mean to withdraw it.\"\n\n\"Let him tell me so; let him tell me that my power of living at\nCosby Lodge does not depend on my marriage,--that my income will be\ncontinued to me whether I marry or no, and I'll arrange matters with\nthe auctioneer to-morrow. You can't suppose that I should prefer to\nlive in France.\"\n\n\"Henry, you are too hard on your father.\"\n\n\"I think, mother, he has been too hard upon me.\"\n\n\"It is you that are to blame now. I tell you plainly that that is my\nopinion. If evil comes of it, it will be your own fault.\"\n\n\"If evil come of it I must bear it.\"\n\n\"A son ought to give up something to his father;--especially to a\nfather so indulgent as yours.\"\n\nBut it was of no use. And Mrs. Grantly when she went to her bed could\nonly lament in her own mind over what, in discussing the matter\nafterwards with her sister, she called the cross-grainedness of men.\n\"They are as like each other as two peas,\" she said, \"and though each\nof them wished to be generous, neither of them would condescend to be\njust.\" Early on the following morning there was, no doubt, much said\non the subject between the archdeacon and his wife before they met\ntheir son at breakfast; but neither at breakfast nor afterwards was\nthere a word said between the father and son that had the slightest\nreference to the subject in dispute between them. The archdeacon made\nno more speeches in favour of land, nor did he revert to the foxes.\nHe was very civil to his son;--too civil by half, as Mrs. Grantly\ncontinued to say to herself. And then the major drove himself away\nin his cart, going through Barchester, so that he might see his\ngrandfather. When he wished his father good-by, the archdeacon shook\nhands with him, and said something about the chance of rain. Had he\nnot better take the big umbrella? The major thanked him courteously,\nand said that he did not think it would rain. Then he was gone. \"Upon\nhis own head be it,\" said the archdeacon when his son's step was\nheard in the passage leading to the back-yard. Then Mrs. Grantly got\nup quietly and followed her son. She found him settling himself in\nhis dog-cart, while the servant who was to accompany him was still\nat the horse's head. She went up close to him, and, standing by the\nwheel of the gig, whispered a word or two into his ear. \"If you love\nme, Henry, you will postpone the sale. Do it for my sake.\" There came\nacross his face a look of great pain, but he answered her not a word.\n\nThe archdeacon was walking about the room striking one hand open\nwith the other closed, clearly in a tumult of anger, when his wife\nreturned to him. \"I have done all that I can,\" he said,--\"all that I\ncan; more, indeed, than was becoming for me. Upon his own head be it.\nUpon his own head be it!\"\n\n\"What is it that you fear?\" she asked.\n\n\"I fear nothing. But if he chooses to sell his things at Cosby Lodge\nhe must abide the consequences. They shall not be replaced with my\nmoney.\"\n\n\"What will it matter if he does sell them?\"\n\n\"Matter! Do you think there is a single person in the county who will\nnot know that his doing so is a sign that he has quarrelled with me?\"\n\n\"But he has not quarrelled with you.\"\n\n\"I can tell you then, that in that case I shall have quarrelled with\nhim! I have not been a hard father, but there are some things which a\nman cannot bear. Of course you will take his part.\"\n\n\"I am taking no part. I only want to see peace between you.\"\n\n\"Peace!--yes; peace indeed. I am to yield in everything. I am to be\nnobody. Look here;--as sure as ever an auctioneer's hammer is raised\nat Cosby Lodge, I will alter the settlement of the property. Every\nacre shall belong to Charles. There is my word for it.\" The poor\nwoman had nothing more to say;--nothing more to say at that moment.\nShe thought that at the present conjuncture her husband was less in\nthe wrong than her son, but she could not tell him so lest she should\nstrengthen him in his wrath.\n\nHenry Grantly found his grandfather in bed, with Posy seated on the\nbed beside him. \"My father told me that you were not quite well, and\nI thought that I would look in,\" said the major.\n\n\"Thank you, my dear;--it is very good of you. There is not much the\nmatter with me, but I am not quite so strong as I was once.\" And the\nold man smiled as he held his grandson's hand.\n\n\"And how is cousin Posy?\" said the major.\n\n\"Posy is quite well;--isn't she, my darling?\" said the old man.\n\n\"Grandpa doesn't go to the cathedral now,\" said Posy; \"so I come in\nto talk to him. Don't I, grandpa?\"\n\n\"And to play cat's-cradle;--only we have not had any cat's-cradle\nthis morning,--have we, Posy?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Baxter told me not to play this morning, because it's cold for\ngrandpa to sit up in bed,\" said Posy.\n\nWhen the major had been there about twenty minutes he was preparing\nto take his leave,--but Mr. Harding, bidding Posy to go out of the\nroom, told his grandson that he had a word to say to him. \"I don't\nlike to interfere, Henry,\" he said, \"but I am afraid that things are\nnot quite smooth at Plumstead.\"\n\n\"There is nothing wrong between me and my mother,\" said the major.\n\n\"God forbid that there should be; but, my dear boy, don't let there\nbe anything wrong between you and your father. He is a good man, and\nthe time will come when you will be proud of his memory.\"\n\n\"I am proud of him now.\"\n\n\"Then be gentle with him,--and submit yourself. I am an old man\nnow,--very fast going away from all those I love here. But I am happy\nin leaving my children because they have ever been gentle to me and\nkind. If I am permitted to remember them whither I am going, my\nthoughts of them will all be pleasant. Should it not be much to them\nthat they have made my death-bed happy?\"\n\nThe major could not but tell himself that Mr. Harding had been a man\neasy to please, easy to satisfy, and, in that respect, very different\nfrom his father. But of course he said nothing of this. \"I will do my\nbest,\" he replied.\n\n\"Do, my boy. Honour thy father,--that thy days may be long in the\nland.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Honour thy Father,--that thy days may be long in the\nLand.\"]\n\nIt seemed to the major as he drove away from Barchester that\neverybody was against him; and yet he was sure that he himself was\nright. He could not give up Grace Crawley; and unless he were to do\nso he could not live at Cosby Lodge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nA LADY PRESENTS HER COMPLIMENTS TO MISS L. D.\n\n\nOne morning, while Lily Dale was staying with Mrs. Thorne in London,\nthere was brought up to her room, as she was dressing for dinner,\na letter which the postman had just left for her. The address was\nwritten with a feminine hand, and Lily was at once aware that she did\nnot know the writing. The angles were very acute, and the lines were\nvery straight, and the vowels looked to be cruel and false, with\ntheir sharp points and their open eyes. Lily at once knew that it was\nthe performance of a woman who had been taught to write at school,\nand not at home, and she became prejudiced against the writer before\nshe opened the letter. When she had opened the letter and read it,\nher feelings towards the writer were not of a kindly nature. It was\nas follows:--\n\n\"A lady presents her compliments to Miss L. D., and earnestly\nimplores Miss L. D. to give her an answer to the following question.\nIs Miss L. D. engaged to marry Mr. J. E.? The lady in question\npledges herself not to interfere with Miss L. D. in any way, should\nthe answer be in the affirmative. The lady earnestly requests that a\nreply to this question may be sent to M. D., Post-office, 455 Edgware\nRoad. In order that L. D. may not doubt that M. D. has an interest in\nJ. E., M. D. encloses the last note she received from him before he\nstarted for the Continent.\" Then there was a scrap, which Lily well\nknew to be in the handwriting of John Eames, and the scrap was as\nfollows:--\"Dearest M.--Punctually at 8.30. Ever and always your\nunalterable J. E.\" Lily, as she read this, did not comprehend that\nJohn's note to M. D. had been in itself a joke.\n\nLily Dale had heard of anonymous letters before, but had never\nreceived one, or even seen one. Now that she had one in her hand, it\nseemed to her that there could be nothing more abominable than the\nwriting of such a letter. She let it drop from her, as though the\nreceiving, and opening, and reading it had been a stain to her. As it\nlay on the ground at her feet, she trod upon it. Of what sort could a\nwoman be who would write such a letter as that? Answer it! Of course\nshe would not answer it. It never occurred to her for a moment that\nit could become her to answer it. Had she been at home or with her\nmother, she would have called her mother to her, and Mrs. Dale would\nhave taken it from the ground, and have read it, and then destroyed\nit. As it was, she must pick it up herself. She did so, and declared\nto herself that there should be an end to it. It might be right that\nsomebody should see it, and therefore she would show it to Emily\nDunstable. After that it should be destroyed.\n\nOf course the letter could have no effect upon her. So she told\nherself. But it did have a very strong effect, and probably the exact\neffect which the writer had intended that it should have. J. E. was,\nof course, John Eames. There was no doubt about that. What a fool\nthe writer must have been to talk of L. D. in the letter, when the\noutside cover was plainly addressed to Miss Lilian Dale! But there\nare some people for whom the pretended mystery of initial letters\nhas a charm, and who love the darkness of anonymous letters. As Lily\nthought of this, she stamped on the letter again. Who was the M. D.\nto whom she was required to send an answer--with whom John Eames\ncorresponded in the most affectionate terms? She had resolved that\nshe would not even ask herself a question about M. D., and yet she\ncould not divert her mind from the inquiry. It was, at any rate, a\nfact that there must be some woman designated by the letters,--some\nwoman who had, at any rate, chosen to call herself M. D. And John\nEames had called her M. There must, at any rate, be such a woman.\nThis female, be she who she might, had thought it worth her while\nto make this inquiry about John Eames, and had manifestly learned\nsomething of Lily's own history. And the woman had pledged herself\nnot to interfere with John Eames, if L. D. would only condescend to\nsay that she was engaged to him! As Lily thought of the proposition,\nshe trod upon the letter for the third time. Then she picked it up,\nand having no place of custody under lock and key ready to her hand,\nshe put it in her pocket.\n\nAt night, before she went to bed, she showed the letter to Emily\nDunstable. \"Is it not surprising that any woman could bring herself\nto write such a letter?\" said Lily.\n\nBut Miss Dunstable hardly saw it in the same light. \"If anybody were\nto write me such a letter about Bernard,\" said she, \"I should show it\nto him as a good joke.\"\n\n\"That would be very different. You and Bernard, of course, understand\neach other.\"\n\n\"And so will you and Mr. Eames--some day, I hope.\"\n\n\"Never more than we do now, dear. The thing that annoys me is that\nsuch a woman as that should have even heard my name at all.\"\n\n\"As long as people have got ears and tongues, people will hear other\npeople's names.\"\n\nLily paused a moment, and then spoke again, asking another question.\n\"I suppose this woman does know him? She must know him, because he\nhas written to her.\"\n\n\"She knows something about him, no doubt, and has some reason for\nwishing that you should quarrel with him. If I were you, I should\ntake care not to gratify her. As for Mr. Eames's note, it is a joke.\"\n\n\"It is nothing to me,\" said Lily.\n\n\"I suppose,\" continued Emily, \"that most gentlemen become acquainted\nwith some people that they would not wish all their friends to know\nthat they knew. They go about so much more than we do, and meet\npeople of all sorts.\"\n\n\"No gentleman should become intimately acquainted with a woman who\ncould write such a letter as that,\" said Lily. And as she spoke she\nremembered a certain episode to John Eames's early life, which had\nreached her from a source which she had not doubted, and which had\ngiven her pain and offended her. She had believed that John Eames had\nin that case behaved cruelly to a young woman, and had thought that\nher offence had come simply from that feeling. \"But of course it is\nnothing to me,\" she said. \"Mr. Eames can choose his friends as he\nlikes. I only wish that my name might not be mentioned to them.\"\n\n\"It is not from him that she has heard it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. As I said before, of course it does not signify; only\nthere is something very disagreeable in the whole thing. The idea\nis so hateful! Of course this woman means me to understand that she\nconsiders herself to have a claim upon Mr. Eames, and that I stand in\nher way.\"\n\n\"And why should you not stand in her way?\"\n\n\"I will stand in nobody's way. Mr. Eames has a right to give his hand\nto any one that he pleases. I, at any rate, can have no cause of\noffence against him. The only thing is that I do wish that my name\ncould be left alone.\" Lily, when she was in her own room again, did\ndestroy the letter; but before she did so she read it again, and it\nbecame so indelibly impressed on her memory that she could not forget\neven the words of it. The lady who wrote had pledged herself, under\ncertain conditions, \"not to interfere with Miss L. D.\" \"Interfere\nwith me!\" Lily said to herself; \"nobody can interfere with me; nobody\nhas power to do so.\" As she turned it over in her mind, her heart\nbecame hard against John Eames. No woman would have troubled herself\nto write such a letter without some cause for the writing. That the\nwriter was vulgar, false, and unfeminine, Lily thought that she could\nperceive from the letter itself; but no doubt the woman knew John\nEames, had some interest in the question of his marriage, and was\nentitled to some answer to her question;--only was not entitled to\nsuch answer from Lily Dale.\n\nFor some weeks past now, up to the hour at which this anonymous\nletter had reached her hands, Lily's heart had been growing soft\nand still softer towards John Eames; and now again it had become\nhardened. I think that the appearance of Adolphus Crosbie in the\npark, that momentary vision of the real man by which the divinity\nof the imaginary Apollo had been dashed to the ground, had done a\nservice to the cause of the other lover; of the lover who had never\nbeen a god, but who of late years had at any rate grown into the full\ndimensions of a man. Unfortunately for the latter, he had commenced\nhis love-making when he was but little more than a boy. Lily, as she\nhad thought of the two together, in the days of her solitude, after\nshe had been deserted by Crosbie, had ever pictured to herself the\nlover whom she had preferred as having something godlike in his\nfavour, as being far the superior in wit, in manner, in acquirement,\nand in personal advantage. There had been good nature and true hearty\nlove on the side of the other man; but circumstances had seemed to\nshow that his good-nature was equal to all, and that he was able\nto share even his hearty love among two or three. A man of such a\ncharacter, known by a girl from his boyhood as John Eames had been\nknown by Lily Dale, was likely to find more favour as a friend than\nas a lover. So it had been between John Eames and Lily. While the\nuntrue memory of what Crosbie was, or ever had been, was present to\nher, she could hardly bring herself to accept in her mind the idea\nof a lover who was less noble in his manhood than the false picture\nwhich that untrue memory was ever painting for her. Then had come\nbefore her eyes the actual man; and though he had been seen but for\na moment, the false image had been broken into shivers. Lily had\ndiscovered that she had been deceived, and that her forgiveness had\nbeen asked, not by a god, but by an ordinary human being. As regarded\nthe ungodlike man himself, this could make no difference. Having\nthought upon the matter deeply, she had resolved that she would not\nmarry Mr. Crosbie, and had pledged herself to that effect to friends\nwho never could have brought themselves to feel affection for him,\neven had she married him. But the shattering of the false image might\nhave done John Eames a good turn. Lily knew that she had at any\nrate full permission from all her friends to throw in her lot with\nhis,--if she could persuade herself to do so. Mother, uncle, sister,\nbrother-in-law, cousin,--and now this new cousin's bride that was\nto be,--together with Lady Julia and a whole crowd of Allington\nand Guestwick friends, were in favour of such a marriage. There\nhad been nothing against it but the fact that the other man had\nbeen dearer to her; and that other fact that poor Johnny lacked\nsomething,--something of earnestness, something of manliness,\nsomething of that Phoebus divinity with which Crosbie had contrived\nto invest his own image. But, as I have said above, John had\ngradually grown, if not into divinity, at least into manliness; and\nthe shattering of the false image had done him yeoman's service. Now\nhad come this accursed letter, and Lily, despite herself, despite her\nbetter judgment, could not sweep it away from her mind and make the\nletter as nothing to her. M. D. had promised not to interfere with\nher! There was no room for such interference, no possibility that\nsuch interference should take place. She hoped earnestly,--so she\ntold herself,--that her old friend John Eames might have nothing to\ndo with a woman so impudent and vulgar as must be this M. D.; but\nexcept as regarded old friendship, M. D. and John Eames, apart or\ntogether, could be as nothing to her. Therefore, I say that the\nletter had had the effect which the writer of it had desired.\n\nAll London was new to Lily Dale, and Mrs. Thorne was very anxious\nto show her everything that could be seen. She was to return to\nAllington before the flowers of May would have come, and the crowd\nand the glare and the fashion and the art of the Academy's great\nexhibition must therefore remain unknown to her; but she was taken to\nsee many pictures, and among others she was taken to see the pictures\nbelonging to a certain nobleman who, with that munificence which is\nso amply enjoyed and so little recognized in England, keeps open\nhouse for the world to see the treasures which the wealth of his\nfamily has collected. The necessary order was procured, and on a\ncertain brilliant April afternoon Mrs. Thorne and her party found\nthemselves in this nobleman's drawing-room. Lily was with her, of\ncourse, and Emily Dunstable was there, and Bernard Dale, and Mrs.\nThorne's dear friend Mrs. Harold Smith, and Mrs. Thorne's constant\nand useful attendant, Siph Dunn. They had nearly completed their\ndelightful but wearying task of gazing at pictures, and Mrs. Harold\nSmith had declared that she would not look at another painting till\nthe exhibition was open; three of the ladies were seated in the\ndrawing-room, and Siph Dunn was standing before them, lecturing\nabout art as though he had been brought up on the ancient masters;\nEmily and Bernard were lingering behind, and the others were simply\ndelaying their departure till the truant lovers should have caught\nthem. At this moment two gentlemen entered the room from the gallery,\nand the two gentlemen were Fowler Pratt and Adolphus Crosbie.\n\nAll the party except Mrs. Thorne knew Crosbie personally, and all of\nthem except Mrs. Harold Smith knew something of the story of what had\noccurred between Crosbie and Lily. Siph Dunn had learned it all since\nthe meeting in the Park, having nearly learned it all from what he\nhad seen there with his eyes. But Mrs. Thorne, who knew Lily's story,\ndid not know Crosbie's appearance. But there was his friend Fowler\nPratt, who, as will be remembered, had dined with her but the other\nday; and she, with that outspoken and somewhat loud impulse which was\nnatural to her, addressed him at once across the room, calling him by\nname. Had she not done so, the two men might probably have escaped\nthrough the room, in which case they would have met Bernard Dale and\nEmily Dunstable in the doorway. Fowler Pratt would have endeavoured\nso to escape, and to carry Crosbie with him, as he was quite alive\nto the expedience of saving Lily from such a meeting. But, as things\nturned out, escape from Mrs. Thorne was impossible.\n\n\"There's Fowler Pratt,\" she had said when they first entered, quite\nloud enough for Fowler Pratt to hear her. \"Mr. Pratt, come here. How\nd'ye do? You dined with me last Tuesday, and you've never been to\ncall.\"\n\n\"I never recognize that obligation till after the middle of May,\"\nsaid Mr. Pratt, shaking hands with Mrs. Thorne and Mrs. Smith, and\nbowing to Miss Dale.\n\n\"I don't see the justice of that at all,\" said Mrs. Thorne. \"It\nseems to me that a good dinner is as much entitled to a morsel of\npasteboard in April as at any other time. You won't have another till\nyou have called,--unless you're specially wanted.\"\n\nCrosbie would have gone on, but that in his attempt to do so he\npassed close by the chair on which Mrs. Harold Smith was sitting, and\nthat he was accosted by her. \"Mr. Crosbie,\" she said, \"I haven't seen\nyou for an age. Has it come to pass that you have buried yourself\nentirely?\" He did not know how to extricate himself so as to move\non at once. He paused, and hesitated, and then stopped, and made an\nattempt to talk to Mrs. Smith as though he were at his ease. The\nattempt was anything but successful; but having once stopped, he did\nnot know how to put himself in motion again, so that he might escape.\nAt this moment Bernard Dale and Emily Dunstable came up and joined\nthe group; but neither of them had discovered who Crosbie was till\nthey were close upon him.\n\nLily was seated between Mrs. Thorne and Mrs. Smith, and Siph Dunn had\nbeen standing immediately opposite to them. Fowler Pratt, who had\nbeen drawn into the circle against his will, was now standing close\nto Dunn, almost between him and Lily,--and Crosbie was standing\nwithin two yards of Lily, on the other side of Dunn. Emily and\nBernard had gone behind Pratt and Crosbie to Mrs. Thorne's side\nbefore they had recognized the two men;--and in this way Lily was\ncompletely surrounded. Mrs. Thorne, who, in spite of her eager,\nimpetuous ways, was as thoughtful of others as any woman could be, as\nsoon as she heard Crosbie's name understood it all, and knew that it\nwould be well that she should withdraw Lily from her plight. Crosbie,\nin his attempt to talk to Mrs. Smith, had smiled and simpered,--and\nhad then felt that to smile and simper before Lily Dale, with a\npretended indifference to her presence, was false on his part, and\nwould seem to be mean. He would have avoided Lily for both their\nsakes, had it been possible; but it was no longer possible, and he\ncould not keep his eyes from her face. Hardly knowing what he did, he\nbowed to her, lifted his hat, and uttered some word of greeting.\n\nLily, from the moment that she had perceived his presence, had looked\nstraight before her, with something almost of fierceness in her eyes.\nBoth Pratt and Siph Dunn had observed her narrowly. It had seemed\nas though Crosbie had been altogether outside the ken of her eyes,\nor the notice of her ears, and yet she had seen every motion of his\nbody, and had heard every word which had fallen from his lips. Now,\nwhen he saluted her, she turned her face full upon him, and bowed to\nhim. Then she rose from her seat, and made her way, between Siph Dunn\nand Pratt, out of the circle. The blood had mounted to her face and\nsuffused it all, and her whole manner was such that it could escape\nthe observation of none who stood there. Even Mrs. Harold Smith had\nseen it, and had read the story. As soon as she was on her feet,\nBernard had dropped Emily's hand, and offered his arm to his cousin.\n\"Lily,\" he had said out loud, \"you had better let me take you away.\nIt is a misfortune that you have been subjected to the insult of\nsuch a greeting.\" Bernard and Crosbie had been early friends, and\nBernard had been the unfortunate means of bringing Crosbie and Lily\ntogether. Up to this day, Bernard had never had his revenge for the\nill-treatment which his cousin had received. Some morsel of that\nrevenge came to him now. Lily almost hated her cousin for what he\nsaid; but she took his arm, and walked with him from the room.\nIt must be acknowledged in excuse for Bernard Dale, and as an\napology for the apparent indiscretion of his words, that all the\ncircumstances of the meeting had become apparent to every one there.\nThe misfortune of the encounter had become too plain to admit of its\nbeing hidden under any of the ordinary veils of society. Crosbie's\nsalutation had been made before the eyes of them all, and in the\nmidst of absolute silence, and Lily had risen with so queen-like\na demeanour, and had moved with so stately a step, that it was\nimpossible that any one concerned should pretend to ignore the facts\nof the scene that had occurred. Crosbie was still standing close to\nMrs. Harold Smith, Mrs. Thorne had risen from her seat, and the words\nwhich Bernard Dale had uttered were still sounding in the ears of\nthem all. \"Shall I see after the carriage?\" said Siph Dunn. \"Do,\"\nsaid Mrs. Thorne; \"or, stay a moment; the carriage will of course be\nthere, and we will go together. Good-morning, Mr. Pratt. I expect\nthat, at any rate, you will send me your card by post.\" Then they all\npassed on, and Crosbie and Fowler Pratt were left among the pictures.\n\n\"I think you will agree with me now that you had better give her up,\"\nsaid Fowler Pratt.\n\n\"I will never give her up,\" said Crosbie, \"till I shall hear that she\nhas married some one else.\"\n\n\"You may take my word for it, that she will never marry you after\nwhat has just now occurred.\"\n\n\"Very likely not; but still the attempt, even the idea of the\nattempt, will be a comfort to me. I shall be endeavouring to do that\nwhich I ought to have done.\"\n\n\"What you have got to think of, I should suppose, is her\ncomfort,--not your own.\"\n\nCrosbie stood for a while silent, looking at a portrait which was\nhung just within the doorway of a smaller room into which they had\npassed, as though his attention were entirely riveted by the picture.\nBut he was thinking of the picture not at all, and did not even know\nwhat kind of painting was on the canvas before him.\n\n\"Pratt,\" he said at last, \"you are always hard to me.\"\n\n\"I will say nothing more to you on the subject, if you wish me to be\nsilent.\"\n\n\"I do wish you to be silent about that.\"\n\n\"That shall be enough,\" said Pratt.\n\n\"You do not quite understand me. You do not know how thoroughly I\nhave repented of the evil that I have done, or how far I would go to\nmake retribution, if retribution were possible!\"\n\nFowler Pratt, having been told to hold his tongue as regarded that\nsubject, made no reply to this, and began to talk about the pictures.\n\nLily, leaning on her cousin's arm, was out in the courtyard in front\nof the house before Mrs. Thorne or Siph Dunn. It was but for a\nminute, but still there was a minute in which Bernard felt that he\nought to say a word to her.\n\n\"I hope you are not angry with me, Lily, for having spoken.\"\n\n\"I wish, of course, that you had not spoken; but I am not angry. I\nhave no right to be angry. I made the misfortune for myself. Do not\nsay anything more about it, dear Bernard;--that is all.\"\n\nThey had walked to the picture-gallery; but, by agreement, two\ncarriages had come to take them away,--Mrs. Thorne's and Mrs. Harold\nSmith's. Mrs. Thorne easily managed to send Emily Dunstable and\nBernard away with her friend, and to tell Siph Dunn that he must\nmanage for himself. In this way it was contrived that no one but Mrs.\nThorne should be with Lily Dale.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Thorne, \"it seemed to me that you were a little\nput out, and so I thought it best to send them all away.\"\n\n\"It was very kind.\"\n\n\"He ought to have passed on and not to have stood an instant when he\nsaw you,\" said Mrs. Thorne, with indignation. \"There are moments when\nit is a man's duty simply to vanish, to melt into the air, or to sink\ninto the ground,--in which he is bound to overcome the difficulties\nof such sudden self-removal, or must ever after be accounted poor and\nmean.\"\n\n\"I did not want him to vanish;--if only he had not spoken to me.\"\n\n\"He should have vanished. A man is sometimes bound in honour to do\nso, even when he himself has done nothing wrong;--when the sin has\nbeen all with the woman. Her femininity has still a right to expect\nthat so much shall be done in its behalf. But when the sin has been\nall his own, as it was in this case,--and such damning sin too,--\"\n\n\"Pray do not go on, Mrs. Thorne.\"\n\n\"He ought to go out and hang himself simply for having allowed\nhimself to be seen. I thought Bernard behaved very well, and I shall\ntell him so.\"\n\n\"I wish you could manage to forget it all, and say no word more about\nit.\"\n\n\"I won't trouble you with it, my dear; I will promise you that. But,\nLily, I can hardly understand you. This man who must have been and\nmust ever be a brute,--\"\n\n\"Mrs. Thorne, you promised me this instant that you would not talk of\nhim.\"\n\n\"After this I will not; but you must let me have my way now for one\nmoment. I have so often longed to speak to you, but have not done so\nfrom fear of offending you. Now the matter has come up by chance,\nand it was impossible that what has occurred should pass by without\na word. I cannot conceive why the memory of that bad man should be\nallowed to destroy your whole life.\"\n\n\"My life is not destroyed. My life is anything but destroyed. It is a\nvery happy life.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, if all that I hear is true, there is a most estimable\nyoung man, whom everybody likes, and particularly all your own\nfamily, and whom you like very much yourself; and you will have\nnothing to say to him, though his constancy is like the constancy of\nan old Paladin,--and all because of this wretch who just now came in\nyour way.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Thorne, it is impossible to explain it all.\"\n\n\"I do not want you to explain it all. Of course I would not ask any\nyoung woman to marry a man whom she did not love. Such marriages are\nabominable to me. But I think that a young woman ought to get married\nif the thing fairly comes in her way, and if her friends approve, and\nif she is fond of the man who is fond of her. It may be that some\nmemory of what has gone before is allowed to stand in your way, and\nthat it should not be so allowed. It sometimes happens that a morbid\nsentiment will destroy a life. Excuse me, then, Lily, if I say too\nmuch to you in my hope that you may not suffer after this fashion.\"\n\n\"I know how kind you are, Mrs. Thorne.\"\n\n\"Here we are at home, and perhaps you would like to go in. I have\nsome calls which I must make.\" Then the conversation was ended, and\nLily was alone.\n\nAs if she had not thought of it all before! As if there was anything\nnew in this counsel which Mrs. Thorne had given her! She had received\nthe same advice from her mother, from her sister, from her uncle, and\nfrom Lady Julia, till she was sick of it. How had it come to pass\nthat matters which with others are so private, should with her have\nbecome the public property of so large a circle? Any other girl would\nreceive advice on such a subject from her mother alone, and there the\nsecret would rest. But her secret had been published, as it were, by\nthe town-crier in the High Street! Everybody knew that she had been\njilted by Adolphus Crosbie, and that it was intended that she should\nbe consoled by John Eames. And people seemed to think that they had\na right to rebuke her if she expressed an unwillingness to carry out\nthis intention which the public had so kindly arranged for her.\n\nMorbid sentiment! Why should she be accused of morbid sentiment\nbecause she was unable to transfer her affections to the man who\nhad been fixed on as her future husband by the large circle of\nacquaintance who had interested themselves in her affairs? There was\nnothing morbid in either her desires or her regrets. So she assured\nherself, with something very like anger at the accusation made\nagainst her. She had been contented, and was contented, to live at\nhome as her mother lived, asking for no excitement beyond that given\nby the daily routine of her duties. There could be nothing morbid in\nthat. She would go back to Allington as soon as might be, and have\ndone with this London life, which only made her wretched. This seeing\nof Crosbie had been terrible to her. She did not tell herself that\nhis image had been shattered. Her idea was that all her misery had\ncome from the untowardness of the meeting. But there was the fact\nthat she had seen the man and heard his voice, and that the seeing\nhim and hearing him had made her miserable. She certainly desired\nthat it might never be her lot either to see him or to hear him\nagain.\n\nAnd as for John Eames,--in those bitter moments of her reflection she\nalmost wished the same in regard to him. If he would only cease to\nbe her lover, he might be very well; but he was not very well to her\nas long as his pretensions were dinned into her ear by everybody who\nknew her. And then she told herself that John would have had a better\nchance if he had been content to plead for himself. In this, I think,\nshe was hard upon her lover. He had pleaded for himself as well as he\nknew how, and as often as the occasion had been given to him. It had\nhardly been his fault that his case had been taken in hand by other\nadvocates. He had given no commission to Mrs. Thorne to plead for\nhim.\n\nPoor Johnny. He had stood in much better favour before the lady had\npresented her compliments to Miss L. D. It was that odious letter,\nand the thoughts which it had forced upon Lily's mind, which were now\nmost inimical to his interests. Whether Lily loved him or not, she\ndid not love him well enough not to be jealous of him. Had any such\nletter reached her respecting Crosbie in the happy days of her young\nlove, she would simply have laughed at it. It would have been nothing\nto her. But now she was sore and unhappy, and any trifle was powerful\nenough to irritate her. \"Is Miss L. D. engaged to marry Mr. J. E.?\"\n\"No,\" said Lily, out loud. \"Lily Dale is not engaged to marry John\nEames, and never will be so engaged.\" She was almost tempted to sit\ndown and write the required answer to Miss M. D. Though the letter\nhad been destroyed, she well remembered the number of the post-office\nin the Edgware Road. Poor John Eames!\n\nThat evening she told Emily Dunstable that she thought she would like\nto return to Allington before the day that had been appointed for\nher. \"But why,\" said Emily, \"should you be worse than your word?\"\n\n\"I daresay it will seem silly, but the fact is I am homesick. I'm not\naccustomed to be away from mamma for so long.\"\n\n\"I hope it is not what occurred to-day at the picture-gallery.\"\n\n\"I won't deny that it is that in part.\"\n\n\"That was a strange accident, you know, that might never occur\nagain.\"\n\n\"It has occurred twice already, Emily.\"\n\n\"I don't call the affair in the Park anything. Anybody may see\nanybody else in the Park, of course. He was not brought so near you\nthat he could annoy you there. You ought certainly to wait till Mr.\nEames has come back from Italy.\"\n\nThen Lily declared that she must and would go back to Allington on\nthe next Monday, and she actually did write a letter to her mother\nthat night to say that such was her intention. But on the morrow her\nheart was less sore, and the letter was not sent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nTHE END OF JAEL AND SISERA.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThere was to be one more sitting for the picture, as the reader will\nremember, and the day for that sitting had arrived. Conway Dalrymple\nhad in the meantime called at Mrs. Van Siever's house, hoping that he\nmight be able to see Clara, and make his offer to her there. But he\nhad failed in his attempt to reach her. He had found it impossible\nto say all that he had to say in the painting-room, during the very\nshort intervals which Mrs. Broughton left to him. A man should be\nallowed to be alone more than fifteen minutes with a young lady on\nthe occasion in which he offers to her his hand and his heart; but\nhitherto he had never had more than fifteen minutes at his command;\nand then there had been the turban! He had also in the meantime\ncalled on Mrs. Broughton, with the intention of explaining to her\nthat if she really intended to favour his views in respect to\nMiss Van Siever, she ought to give him a little more liberty for\nexpressing himself. On this occasion he had seen his friend, but had\nnot been able to go as minutely as he had wished into the matter that\nwas so important to himself. Mrs. Broughton had found it necessary\nduring this meeting to talk almost exclusively about herself and her\nown affairs. \"Conway,\" she had said, directly she saw him, \"I am so\nglad you have come. I think I should have gone mad if I had not seen\nsome one who cares for me.\" This was early in the morning, not much\nafter eleven, and Mrs. Broughton, hearing first his knock at the\ndoor, and then his voice, had met him in the hall and taken him into\nthe dining-room.\n\n\"Is anything the matter?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, Conway!\"\n\n\"What is it? Has anything gone wrong with Dobbs?\"\n\n\"Everything has gone wrong with him. He is ruined.\"\n\n\"Heaven and earth! What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Simply what I say. But you must not speak a word of it. I do not\nknow it from himself.\"\n\n\"How do you know it?\"\n\n\"Wait a moment. Sit down there, will you?--and I will sit by you. No,\nConway; do not take my hand. It is not right. There;--so. Yesterday\nMrs. Van Siever was here. I need not tell you all that she said to\nme, even if I could. She was very harsh and cruel, saying all manner\nof things about Dobbs. How can I help it, if he drinks? I have not\nencouraged him. And as for expensive living, I have been as ignorant\nas a child. I have never asked for anything. When we were married\nsomebody told me how much we should have to spend. It was either two\nthousand, or three thousand, or four thousand, or something like\nthat. You know, Conway, how ignorant I am about money;--that I am\nlike a child. Is it not true?\" She waited for an answer and Dalrymple\nwas obliged to acknowledge that it was true. And yet he had known\nthe times in which his dear friend had been very sharp in her memory\nwith reference to a few pounds. \"And now she says that Dobbs owes her\nmoney which he cannot pay her, and that everything must be sold. She\nsays that Musselboro must have the business, and that Dobbs must\nshift for himself elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that she has the power to decide that things shall go\nthis way or that,--as she pleases?\"\n\n\"How am I to know? She says so, and she says it is because he drinks.\nHe does drink. That at least is true; but how can I help it? Oh,\nConway, what am I to do? Dobbs did not come home at all last night,\nbut sent for his things,--saying that he must stay in the City. What\nam I to do if they come and take the house, and sell the furniture,\nand turn me out into the street?\" Then the poor creature began to cry\nin earnest, and Dalrymple had to console her as best he might. \"How\nI wish I had known you first,\" she said. To this Dalrymple was able\nto make no direct answer. He was wise enough to know that a direct\nanswer might possibly lead him into terrible trouble. He was by no\nmeans anxious to find himself \"protecting\" Mrs. Dobbs Broughton from\nthe ruin which her husband had brought upon her.\n\nBefore he left her she had told him a long story, partly of matters\nof which he had known something before, and partly made up of\nthat which she had heard from the old woman. It was settled, Mrs.\nBroughton said, that Mr. Musselboro was to marry Clara Van Siever.\nBut it appeared, as far as Dalrymple could learn, that this was a\nsettlement made simply between Mrs. Van Siever and Musselboro. Clara,\nas he thought, was not a girl likely to fall into such a settlement\nwithout having an opinion of her own. Musselboro was to have the\nbusiness, and Dobbs Broughton was to be \"sold up,\" and then look for\nemployment in the City. From her husband the wife had not heard a\nword on this matter, and the above story was simply what had been\ntold to Mrs. Broughton by Mrs. Van Siever. \"For myself it seems that\nthere can be but one fate,\" said Mrs. Broughton. Dalrymple, in his\ntenderest voice, asked what that one fate must be. \"Never mind,\" said\nMrs. Broughton. \"There are some things which one cannot tell even\nto such a friend as you.\" He was sitting near her and had all but\ngot his arm behind her waist. He was, however, able to be prudent.\n\"Maria,\" he said, getting up on his feet, \"if it should really come\nabout that you should want anything, you will send to me. You will\npromise me that, at any rate?\" She rubbed a tear from her eye and\nsaid that she did not know. \"There are moments in which a man must\nspeak plainly,\" said Conway Dalrymple;--\"in which it would be unmanly\nnot to do so, however prosaic it may seem. I need hardly tell you\nthat my purse shall be yours if you want it.\" But just at that moment\nshe did not want his purse, nor must it be supposed that she wanted\nto run away with him and to leave her husband to fight the battle\nalone with Mrs. Van Siever. The truth was that she did not know\nwhat she wanted, over and beyond an assurance from Conway Dalrymple\nthat she was the most ill-used, the most interesting, and the most\nbeautiful woman ever heard of, either in history or romance. Had he\nproposed to her to pack up a bundle and go off with him in a cab\nto the London, Chatham, and Dover railway station, en route for\nBoulogne, I do not for a moment think that she would have packed up\nher bundle. She would have received intense gratification from the\noffer,--so much so that she would have been almost consoled for her\nhusband's ruin; but she would have scolded her lover, and would have\nexplained to him the great iniquity of which he was guilty.\n\nIt was clear to him that at this present time he could not make any\nspecial terms with her as to Clara Van Siever. At such a moment as\nthis he could hardly ask her to keep out of the way, in order that\nhe might have his opportunity. But when he suggested that probably\nit might be better, in the present emergency, to give up the idea\nof any further sitting in her room, and proposed to send for his\ncanvas, colour-box, and easel, she told him that, as far as she was\nconcerned, he was welcome to have that one other sitting for which\nthey had all bargained. \"You had better come to-morrow, as we had\nagreed,\" she said; \"and unless I shall have been turned out into the\nstreet by the creditors, you may have the room as you did before. And\nyou must remember, Conway, that though Mrs. Van says that Musselboro\nis to have Clara, it doesn't follow that Clara should give way.\" When\nwe consider everything, we must acknowledge that this was, at any\nrate, good-natured. Then there was a tender parting, with many tears,\nand Conway Dalrymple escaped from the house.\n\nHe did not for a moment doubt the truth of the story which Mrs.\nBroughton had told, as far, at least, as it referred to the ruin of\nDobbs Broughton. He had heard something of this before, and for some\nweeks had expected that a crash was coming. Broughton's rise had been\nvery sudden, and Dalrymple had never regarded his friend as firmly\nplaced in the commercial world. Dobbs was one of those men who seem\nborn to surprise the world by a spurt of prosperity, and might,\nperhaps, have had a second spurt, or even a third, could he have kept\nhimself from drinking in the morning. But Dalrymple, though he was\nhardly astonished by the story, as it regarded Broughton, was put out\nby that part of it which had reference to Musselboro. He had known\nthat Musselboro had been introduced to Broughton by Mrs. Van Siever,\nbut, nevertheless, he had regarded the man as being no more than\nBroughton's clerk. And now he was told that Musselboro was to marry\nClara Van Siever, and have all Mrs. Van Siever's money. He resolved,\nat last, that he would run his risk about the money, and take Clara\neither with or without it, if she would have him. And as for that\ndifficulty in asking her, if Mrs. Broughton would give him no\nopportunity of putting the question behind her back, he would put it\nbefore her face. He had not much leisure for consideration on these\npoints, as the next day was the day for the last sitting.\n\nOn the following morning he found Miss Van Siever already seated in\nMrs. Broughton's room when he reached it. And at the moment Mrs.\nBroughton was not there. As he took Clara's hand, he could not\nprevent himself from asking her whether she had heard anything?\n\"Heard what?\" said Clara. \"Then you have not,\" said he. \"Never mind\nnow, as Mrs. Broughton is here.\" Then Mrs. Broughton had entered\nthe room. She seemed to be quite cheerful, but Dalrymple perfectly\nunderstood, from a special glance which she gave to him, that he was\nto perceive that her cheerfulness was assumed for Clara's benefit.\nMrs. Broughton was showing how great a heroine she could be on behalf\nof her friends. \"Now, my dear,\" she said, \"do remember that this is\nthe last day. It may be all very well, Conway, and, of course, you\nknow best; but as far as I can see, you have not made half as much\nprogress as you ought to have done.\" \"We shall do excellently well,\"\nsaid Dalrymple. \"So much the better,\" said Mrs. Broughton; \"and now,\nClara, I'll place you.\" And so Clara was placed on her knees, with\nthe turban on her head.\n\nDalrymple began his work assiduously, knowing that Mrs. Broughton\nwould not leave the room for some minutes. It was certain that she\nwould remain for a quarter of an hour, and it might be as well that\nhe should really use that time on his picture. The peculiar position\nin which he was placed probably made his work difficult to him. There\nwas something perplexing in the necessity which bound him to look\nupon the young lady before him both as Jael and as the future Mrs.\nConway Dalrymple, knowing as he did that she was at present simply\nClara Van Siever. A double personification was not difficult to him.\nHe had encountered it with every model that had sat to him, and with\nevery young lady he had attempted to win,--if he had ever made such\nan attempt with one before. But the triple character, joined to the\nnecessity of the double work, was distressing to him. \"The hand a\nlittle further back, if you don't mind,\" he said, \"and the wrist\nmore turned towards me. That is just it. Lean a little more over\nhim. There--that will do exactly.\" If Mrs. Broughton did not go very\nquickly, he must begin to address his model on a totally different\nsubject, even while she was in the act of slaying Sisera.\n\n\"Have you made up your mind who is to be Sisera?\" asked Mrs.\nBroughton.\n\n\"I think I shall put in my own face,\" said Dalrymple; \"if Miss Van\nSiever does not object.\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said Clara, speaking without moving her\nface--almost without moving her lips.\n\n\"That will be excellent,\" said Mrs. Broughton. She was still quite\ncheerful, and really laughed as she spoke. \"Shall you like the idea,\nClara, of striking the nail right through his head?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; as well his head as another's. I shall seem to be having my\nrevenge for all the trouble he has given me.\"\n\nThere was a slight pause, and then Dalrymple spoke. \"You have had\nthat already, in striking me right through the heart.\"\n\n\"What a very pretty speech! Was it not, my dear?\" said Mrs.\nBroughton. And then Mrs. Broughton laughed. There was something\nslightly hysterical in her laugh which grated on Dalrymple's\nears,--something which seemed to tell him that at the present moment\nhis dear friend was not going to assist him honestly in his effort.\n\n\"Only that I should put him out, I would get up and make a curtsey,\"\nsaid Clara. No young lady could ever talk of making a curtsey for\nsuch a speech if she supposed it to have been made in earnestness.\nAnd Clara, no doubt, understood that a man might make a hundred such\nspeeches in the presence of a third person without any danger that\nthey would be taken as meaning anything. All this Dalrymple knew, and\nbegan to think that he had better put down his palette and brush,\nand do the work which he had before him in the most prosaic language\nthat he could use. He could, at any rate, succeed in making Clara\nacknowledge his intention in this way. He waited still for a minute\nor two, and it seemed to him that Mrs. Broughton had no intention\nof piling her fagots on the present occasion. It might be that the\nremembrance of her husband's ruin prevented her from sacrificing\nherself in the other direction also.\n\n\"I am not very good at pretty speeches, but I am good at telling the\ntruth,\" said Dalrymple.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Mrs. Broughton, still with a touch of\nhysterical action in her throat. \"Upon my word, Conway, you know how\nto praise yourself.\"\n\n\"He dispraises himself most unnecessarily in denying the prettiness\nof his language,\" said Clara. As she spoke she hardly moved her lips,\nand Dalrymple went on painting from the model. It was clear that Miss\nVan Siever understood that the painting, and not the pretty speeches,\nwas the important business on hand.\n\nMrs. Broughton had now tucked her feet up on the sofa, and was gazing\nat the artist as he stood at his work. Dalrymple, remembering how he\nhad offered her his purse,--an offer which, in the existing crisis of\nher affairs, might mean a great deal,--felt that she was ill-natured.\nHad she intended to do him a good turn, she would have gone now;\nbut there she lay, with her feet tucked up, clearly purposing to\nbe present through the whole of that morning's sitting. His anger\nagainst her added something to his spirit, and made him determine\nthat he would carry out his purpose. Suddenly, therefore, he prepared\nhimself for action.\n\nHe was in the habit of working with a Turkish cap on his head, and\nwith a short apron tied round him. There was something picturesque\nabout the cap, which might not have been incongruous with\nlove-making. It is easy to suppose that Juan wore a Turkish cap when\nhe sat with Haidee in Lambro's island. But we may be quite sure that\nhe did not wear an apron. Now Dalrymple had thought of all this,\nand had made up his mind to work to-day without his apron; but when\narranging his easel and his brushes, he had put it on from force of\nhabit, and was now disgusted with himself as he remembered it. He put\ndown his brush, divested his thumb of his palette, then took off his\ncap, and after that untied the apron.\n\n\"Conway, what are you going to do?\" said Mrs. Broughton.\n\n\"I am going to ask Clara Van Siever to be my wife,\" said Dalrymple.\nAt that moment the door was opened, and Mrs. Van Siever entered the\nroom.\n\nClara had not risen from her kneeling posture when Dalrymple began to\nput off his trappings. She had not seen what he was doing as plainly\nas Mrs. Broughton had done, having her attention naturally drawn\ntowards her Sisera; and, besides this, she understood that she was\nto remain as she was placed till orders to move were given to her.\nDalrymple would occasionally step aside from his easel to look at\nher in some altered light, and on such occasions she would simply\nhold her hammer somewhat more tightly than before. When, therefore,\nMrs. Van Siever entered the room Clara was still slaying Sisera, in\nspite of the artist's speech. The speech, indeed, and her mother both\nseemed to come to her at the same time. The old woman stood for a\nmoment holding the open door in her hand. \"You fool!\" she said, \"what\nare you doing there, dressed up in that way like a guy?\" Then Clara\ngot up from her feet and stood before her mother in Jael's dress and\nJael's turban. Dalrymple thought that the dress and turban did not\nbecome her badly. Mrs. Van Siever apparently thought otherwise. \"Will\nyou have the goodness to tell me, miss, why you are dressed up after\nthat Mad Bess of Bedlam fashion?\"\n\nThe reader will no doubt bear in mind that Clara had other words\nof which to think besides those which were addressed to her by her\nmother. Dalrymple had asked her to be his wife in the plainest\npossible language, and she thought that the very plainness of the\nlanguage became him well. The very taking off of his apron, almost\nas he said the words, though to himself the action had been so\ndistressing as almost to overcome his purpose, had in it something\nto her of direct simple determination which pleased her. When he had\nspoken of having had a nail driven by her right through his heart,\nshe had not been in the least gratified; but the taking off of the\napron, and the putting down of the palette, and the downright way in\nwhich he had called her Clara Van Siever,--attempting to be neither\nsentimental with Clara, nor polite with Miss Van Siever,--did please\nher. She had often said to herself that she would never give a plain\nanswer to a man who did not ask her a plain question;--to a man who,\nin asking this question, did not say plainly to her, \"Clara Van\nSiever, will you become Mrs. Jones?\"--or Mrs. Smith, or Mrs. Tomkins,\nas the case might be. Now Conway Dalrymple had asked her to become\nMrs. Dalrymple very much after this fashion. In spite of the\napparition of her mother, all this had passed through her mind. Not\nthe less, however, was she obliged to answer her mother, before she\ncould give any reply to the other questioner. In the meantime Mrs.\nDobbs Broughton had untucked her feet.\n\n\"Mamma,\" said Clara, \"who ever expected to see you here?\"\n\n\"I daresay nobody did,\" said Mrs. Van Siever; \"but here I am,\nnevertheless.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" said Mrs. Dobbs Broughton, \"you might at any rate have gone\nthrough the ceremony of having yourself announced by the servant.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" said the old woman, attempting to mimic the tone of the\nother, \"I thought that on such a very particular occasion as this I\nmight be allowed to announce myself. You tomfool, you, why don't you\ntake that turban off?\" Then Clara, with slow and graceful motion,\nunwound the turban. If Dalrymple really meant what he had said, and\nwould stick to it, she need not mind being called a tomfool by her\nmother.\n\n\"Conway, I am afraid that our last sitting is disturbed,\" said Mrs.\nBroughton, with her little laugh.\n\n\"Conway's last sitting certainly is disturbed,\" said Mrs. Van Siever,\nand then she mimicked the laugh. \"And you'll all be disturbed,--I can\ntell you that. What an ass you must be to go on with this kind of\nthing, after what I said to you yesterday! Do you know that he got\nbeastly drunk in the City last night, and that he is drunk now, while\nyou are going on with your tomfooleries?\" Upon hearing this, Mrs.\nDobbs Broughton fainted into Dalrymple's arms.\n\nHitherto the artist had not said a word, and had hardly known what\npart it would best become him now to play. If he intended to marry\nClara,--and he certainly did intend to marry her if she would have\nhim,--it might be as well not to quarrel with Mrs. Van Siever. At any\nrate there was nothing in Mrs. Van Siever's intrusion, disagreeable\nas it was, which need make him take up his sword to do battle with\nher. But now, as he held Mrs. Broughton in his arms, and as the\nhorrid words which the old woman had spoken rung in his ears, he\ncould not refrain himself from uttering reproach. \"You ought not to\nhave told her in this way, before other people, even if it be true,\"\nsaid Conway.\n\n\"Leave me to be my own judge of what I ought to do, if you please,\nsir. If she had any feeling at all, what I told her yesterday would\nhave kept her from all this. But some people have no feeling, and\nwill go on being tomfools though the house is on fire.\" As these\nwords were spoken, Mrs. Broughton fainted more persistently than\never,--so that Dalrymple was convinced that whether she felt or not,\nat any rate she heard. He had now dragged her across the room, and\nlaid her upon the sofa, and Clara had come to her assistance. \"I\ndaresay you think me very hard because I speak plainly, but there are\nthings much harder than plain speaking. How much do you expect to be\npaid, sir, for this picture of my girl?\"\n\n\"I do not expect to be paid for it at all,\" said Dalrymple.\n\n\"And who is it to belong to?\"\n\n\"It belongs to me at present.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, it mustn't belong to you any longer. It won't do for you\nto have a picture of my girl to hang up in your painting-room for all\nyour friends to come and make their jokes about, nor yet to make a\nshow of it in any of your exhibitions. My daughter has been a fool,\nand I can't help it. If you'll tell me what's the cost, I'll pay you;\nthen I'll have the picture home, and I'll treat it as it deserves.\"\n\nDalrymple thought for a moment about his picture and about Mrs. Van\nSiever. What had he better do? He wanted to behave well, and he felt\nthat the old woman had something of justice on her side. \"Madam,\" he\nsaid, \"I will not sell this picture; but it shall be destroyed, if\nyou wish it.\"\n\n\"I certainly do wish it, but I won't trust to you. If it's not sent\nto my house at once you'll hear from me through my lawyers.\"\n\nThen Dalrymple deliberately opened his penknife and slit the canvas\nacross, through the middle of the picture each way. Clara, as she\nsaw him do it, felt that in truth she loved him. \"There, Mrs. Van\nSiever,\" he said; \"now you can take the bits home with you in your\nbasket if you wish it.\" At this moment, as the rent canvas fell and\nfluttered upon the stretcher, there came a loud voice of lamentation\nfrom the sofa, a groan of despair and a shriek of wrath. \"Very fine\nindeed,\" said Mrs. Van Siever. \"When ladies faint they always ought\nto have their eyes about them. I see that Mrs. Broughton understands\nthat.\"\n\n\"Take her away, Conway--for God's sake take her away,\" said Mrs.\nBroughton.\n\n\"I shall take myself away very shortly,\" said Mrs. Van Siever, \"so\nyou needn't trouble Mr. Conway about that. Not but what I thought the\ngentleman's name was Mr. something else.\"\n\n\"My name is Conway Dalrymple,\" said the artist.\n\n\"Then I suppose you must be her brother, or her cousin, or something\nof that sort?\" said Mrs. Van Siever.\n\n\"Take her away,\" screamed Mrs. Dobbs Broughton.\n\n\"Wait a moment, madam. As you've chopped up your handiwork there, Mr.\nConway Dalrymple, and as I suppose my daughter has been more to blame\nthan anybody else--\"\n\n\"She has not been to blame at all,\" said Dalrymple.\n\n\"That's my affair, and not yours,\" said Mrs. Van Siever, very\nsharply. \"But as you've been at all this trouble, and have now\nchopped it up, I don't mind paying you for your time and paints; only\nI shall be glad to know how much it will come to?\"\n\n\"There will be nothing to pay, Mrs. Van Siever.\"\n\n\"How long has he been at it, Clara?\"\n\n\"Mamma, indeed you had better not say anything about paying him.\"\n\n\"I shall say whatever I please, miss. Will ten pounds do it, sir?\"\n\n\"If you choose to buy the picture, the price will be seven hundred\nand fifty,\" said Dalrymple, with a smile, pointing to the fragments.\n\n\"Seven hundred and fifty pounds?\" said the old woman.\n\n\"But I strongly advise you not to make the purchase,\" said Dalrymple.\n\n\"Seven hundred and fifty pounds! I certainly shall not give you seven\nhundred and fifty pounds, sir.\"\n\n\"I certainly think you could invest your money better, Mrs. Van\nSiever. But if the thing is to be sold at all, that is my price. I've\nthought that there was some justice in your demand that it should be\ndestroyed,--and therefore I have destroyed it.\"\n\nMrs. Van Siever had been standing on the same spot ever since she had\nentered the room, and now she turned round to leave the room.\n\n\"If you have any demand to make, I beg that you will send in your\naccount for work done to Mr. Musselboro. He is my man of business.\nClara, are you ready to come home? The cab is waiting at the\ndoor,--at sixpence the quarter of an hour, if you will be pleased to\nremember.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Broughton,\" said Clara, thoughtful of her raiment, and\nremembering that it might not be well that she should return home,\neven in a cab, dressed as Jael; \"if you will allow me, I will go into\nyour room for a minute or two.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Clara,\" said Mrs. Broughton, preparing to accompany her.\n\n\"But before you go, Mrs. Broughton,\" said Mrs. Van Siever, \"it may be\nas well that I should tell you that my daughter is going to become\nthe wife of Mr. Musselboro. It may simplify matters that you should\nknow this.\" And Mrs. Van Siever, as she spoke, looked hard at Conway\nDalrymple.\n\n\"Mamma!\" exclaimed Clara.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Van Siever, \"you had better change your dress\nand come away with me.\"\n\n\"Not till I have protested against what you have said, mamma.\"\n\n\"You had better leave your protesting alone, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Broughton,\" continued Clara, \"I must beg you to understand that\nmamma has not the slightest right in the world to tell you what she\njust now said about me. Nothing on earth would induce me to become\nthe wife of Mr. Broughton's partner.\"\n\nThere was something which made Clara unwilling even to name the man\nwhom her mother had publicly proposed as her future husband.\n\n\"He isn't Mr. Broughton's partner,\" said Mrs. Van Siever. \"Mr.\nBroughton has not got a partner. Mr. Musselboro is the head of the\nfirm. And as to your marrying him, of course, I can't make you.\"\n\n\"No, mamma; you cannot.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Broughton understands that, no doubt;--and so, probably, does\nMr. Dalrymple. I only tell them what are my ideas. If you choose to\nmarry the sweep at the crossing, I can't help it. Only I don't see\nwhat good you would do the sweep, when he would have to sweep for\nhimself and you too. At any rate, I suppose you mean to go home with\nme now?\" Then Mrs. Broughton and Clara left the room, and Mrs. Van\nSiever was left with Conway Dalrymple. \"Mr. Dalrymple,\" said Mrs.\nVan Siever, \"do not deceive yourself. What I told you just now will\ncertainly come to pass.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that that must depend on the young lady,\" said\nDalrymple.\n\n\"I'll tell you what certainly will not depend on the young lady,\"\nsaid Mrs. Van Siever, \"and that is whether the man who marries her\nwill have more with her than the clothes she stands up in. You will\nunderstand that argument, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I'm not quite sure that I do,\" said Dalrymple.\n\n\"Then you'd better try to understand it. Good-morning, sir. I'm sorry\nyou've had to slit your picture.\" Then she curtseyed low, and walked\nout on to the landing-place. \"Clara,\" she cried, \"I'm waiting for\nyou--sixpence a quarter of an hour,--remember that.\" In a minute or\ntwo Clara came out to her, and then Mrs. Van Siever and Miss Van\nSiever took their departure.\n\n\"Oh, Conway, what am I to do? what am I to do?\" said Mrs. Dobbs\nBroughton. Dalrymple stood perplexed for a few minutes, and could not\ntell her what she was to do. She was in such a position that it was\nvery hard to tell her what to do. \"Do you believe, Conway, that he is\nreally ruined?\"\n\n\"What am I to say? How am I to know?\"\n\n\"I see that you believe it,\" said the wretched woman.\n\n\"I cannot but believe that there is something of truth in what this\nwoman says. Why else should she come here with such a story?\" Then\nthere was a pause, during which Mrs. Broughton was burying her face\non the arm of the sofa. \"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" continued he.\n\"I'll go into the City, and make inquiry. It can hardly be but what\nI shall learn the truth there.\"\n\nThen there was another pause, at the end of which Mrs. Broughton got\nup from the sofa.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said she;--\"what do you mean to do about that girl?\"\n\n\"You heard me ask her to be my wife?\"\n\n\"I did. I did!\"\n\n\"Is it not what you intended?\"\n\n\"Do not ask me. My mind is bewildered. My brain is on fire! Oh,\nConway!\"\n\n\"Shall I go into the City as I proposed?\" said Dalrymple, who felt\nthat he might at any rate improve the position of circumstances by\nleaving the house.\n\n\"Yes;--yes; go into the City! Go anywhere. Go. But stay! Oh, Conway!\"\nThere was a sudden change in her voice as she spoke. \"Hark,--there he\nis, as sure as life.\" Then Conway listened, and heard a footstep on\nthe stairs, as to which he had then but little doubt that it was the\nfootstep of Dobbs Broughton. \"O heavens! he is tipsy!\" exclaimed Mrs.\nBroughton; \"and what shall we do?\" Then Dalrymple took her hand and\npressed it, and left the room, so that he might meet the husband on\nthe stairs. In the one moment that he had for reflection he thought\nit was better that there should be no concealment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\n\"IT'S DOGGED AS DOES IT.\"\n\n\nIn accordance with the resolution to which the clerical commission\nhad come on the first day of their sitting, Dr. Tempest wrote the\nfollowing letter to Mr. Crawley:--\n\n\n   Rectory, Silverbridge, April 9, 186--.\n\n   DEAR SIR,--\n\n   I have been given to understand that you have been\n   informed that the Bishop of Barchester has appointed a\n   commission of clergymen of the diocese to make inquiry\n   respecting certain accusations which, to the great regret\n   of us all, have been made against you, in respect to a\n   cheque for twenty pounds which was passed by you to a\n   tradesman in this town. The clergymen appointed to form\n   this commission are Mr. Oriel, the rector of Greshamsbury,\n   Mr. Robarts, the vicar of Framley, Mr. Quiverful, the\n   warden of Hiram's Hospital at Barchester, Mr. Thumble, a\n   clergyman established in that city, and myself. We held\n   our first meeting on last Monday, and I now write to you\n   in compliance with a resolution to which we then came.\n   Before taking any other steps we thought it best to ask\n   you to attend us here on next Monday, at two o'clock, and\n   I beg that you will accept this letter as an invitation to\n   that effect.\n\n   We are, of course, aware that you are about to stand your\n   trial at the next assizes for the offence in question. I\n   beg you to understand that I do not express any opinion as\n   to your guilt. But I think it right to point out to you\n   that in the event of a jury finding an adverse verdict,\n   the bishop might be placed in great difficulty unless he\n   were fortified with the opinion of a commission formed\n   from your fellow clerical labourers in the diocese. Should\n   such adverse verdict unfortunately be given, the bishop\n   would hardly be justified in allowing a clergyman placed\n   as you then would be placed, to return to his cure after\n   the expiration of such punishment as the judge might\n   award, without a further decision from an ecclesiastical\n   court. This decision he could only obtain by proceeding\n   against you under the Act in reference to clerical\n   offences, which empowers him as bishop of the diocese to\n   bring you before the Court of Arches,--unless you would\n   think well to submit yourself entirely to his judgment.\n   You will, I think, understand what I mean. The judge at\n   assizes might find it his duty to imprison a clergyman\n   for a month,--regarding that clergyman simply as he would\n   regard any other person found guilty by a jury and thus\n   made subject to his judgment,--and might do this for an\n   offence which the ecclesiastical judge would find himself\n   obliged to visit with the severer sentence of prolonged\n   suspension, or even with deprivation.\n\n   We are, however, clearly of opinion that should the jury\n   find themselves able to acquit you, no further action\n   whatsoever should be taken. In such case we think that the\n   bishop may regard your innocence to be fully established,\n   and in such case we shall recommend his lordship to look\n   upon the matter as altogether at an end. I can assure you\n   that in such case I shall so regard it myself.\n\n   You will perceive that, as a consequence of this\n   resolution, to which we have already come, we are\n   not minded to make any inquiries ourselves into the\n   circumstances of your alleged guilt, till the verdict of\n   the jury shall be given. If you are acquitted, our course\n   will be clear. But should you be convicted, we must in\n   that case advise the bishop to take the proceedings to\n   which I have alluded, or to abstain from taking them. We\n   wish to ask you whether, now that our opinion has been\n   conveyed to you, you will be willing to submit to the\n   bishop's decision, in the event of an adverse verdict\n   being given by the jury; and we think that it will be\n   better for us all that you should meet us here at the hour\n   I have named on Monday next, the 15th instant. It is not\n   our intention to make any report to the bishop until the\n   trial shall be over.\n\n   I have the honour to be,\n   My dear sir,\n   Your very obedient servant,\n\n   MORTIMER TEMPEST.\n\n   The Rev. Josiah Crawley,\n   Hogglestock.\n\n\nIn the same envelope Dr. Tempest sent a short private note, in which\nhe said that he should be very happy to see Mr. Crawley at half-past\none on the Monday named, that luncheon would be ready at that hour,\nand that, as Mr. Crawley's attendance was required on public grounds,\nhe would take care that a carriage was provided for the day.\n\nMr. Crawley received this letter in his wife's presence, and read\nit in silence. Mrs. Crawley saw that he paid close attention to it,\nand was sure,--she felt that she was sure,--that it referred in some\nway to the terrible subject of the cheque for twenty pounds. Indeed,\neverything that came into the house, almost every word spoken there,\nand every thought that came into the breasts of any of the family,\nhad more or less reference to the coming trial. How could it be\notherwise? There was ruin coming on them all,--ruin and complete\ndisgrace coming on father, mother, and children! To have been accused\nitself was very bad; but now it seemed to be the opinion of every one\nthat the verdict must be against the man. Mrs. Crawley herself, who\nwas perfectly sure of her husband's innocence before God, believed\nthat the jury would find him guilty,--and believed also that he had\nbecome possessed of the money in some manner that would have been\ndishonest, had he not been so different from other people as to be\nentitled to be considered innocent where another man would have been\nplainly guilty. She was full of the cheque for twenty pounds, and of\nits results. When, therefore, he had read the letter through a second\ntime, and even then had spoken no word about it, of course she could\nnot refrain from questioning him. \"My love,\" she said, \"what is the\nletter?\"\n\n\"It is on business,\" he answered.\n\nShe was silent for a moment before she spoke again. \"May I not know\nthe business?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he; \"not at present.\"\n\n\"Is it from the bishop?\"\n\n\"Have I not answered you? Have I not given you to understand that,\nfor a while at least, I would prefer to keep the contents of\nthis epistle to myself?\" Then he looked at her very sternly, and\nafterwards turned his eyes upon the fireplace and gazed at the fire,\nas though he were striving to read there something of his future\nfate. She did not much regard the severity of his speech. That, too,\nlike the taking of the cheque itself, was to be forgiven him, because\nhe was different from other men. His black mood had come upon him,\nand everything was to be forgiven him now. He was as a child when\ncutting his teeth. Let the poor wayward sufferer be ever so petulant,\nthe mother simply pities and loves him, and is never angry. \"I beg\nyour pardon, Josiah,\" she said, \"but I thought it would comfort you\nto speak to me about it.\"\n\n\"It will not comfort me,\" he said. \"Nothing comforts me. Nothing can\ncomfort me. Jane, give me my hat and my stick.\" His daughter brought\nto him his hat and stick, and without another word he went out and\nleft them.\n\nAs a matter of course he turned his steps towards Hoggle End. When he\ndesired to be long absent from the house, he always went among the\nbrickmakers. His wife, as she stood at the window and watched the\ndirection in which he went, knew that he might be away for hours. The\nonly friends out of his own family with whom he ever spoke freely\nwere some of these rough parishioners. But he was not thinking of the\nbrickmakers when he started. He was simply desirous of again reading\nDr. Tempest's letter, and of considering it, in some spot where\nno eye could see him. He walked away with long steps, regarding\nnothing,--neither the ruts in the dirty lane, nor the young primroses\nwhich were fast showing themselves on the banks, nor the gathering\nclouds which might have told him of the coming rain. He went on for\na couple of miles, till he had nearly reached the outskirts of the\ncolony of Hoggle End, and then he sat himself down upon a gate. He\nhad not been there a minute before a few slow large drops began to\nfall, but he was altogether too much wrapped up in his thoughts to\nregard the rain. What answer should he make to this letter from the\nman at Silverbridge?\n\nThe position of his own mind in reference to his own guilt or his\nown innocence was very singular. It was simply the truth that he did\nnot know how the cheque had come to him. He did know that he had\nblundered about it most egregiously, especially when he had averred\nthat this cheque for twenty pounds had been identical with a cheque\nfor another sum which had been given to him by Mr. Soames. He had\nblundered since, in saying that the dean had given it to him. There\ncould be no doubt as to this, for the dean had denied that he had\ndone so. And he had come to think it very possible that he had indeed\npicked the cheque up, and had afterwards used it, having deposited\nit by some strange accident,--not knowing then what he was doing, or\nwhat was the nature of the bit of paper in his hand,--with the notes\nwhich he had accepted from the dean with so much reluctance, with\nsuch an agony of spirit. In all these thoughts of his own about his\nown doings, and his own position, he almost admitted to himself his\nown insanity, his inability to manage his own affairs with that\ndegree of rational sequence which is taken for granted as belonging\nto a man when he is made subject to criminal laws. As he puzzled\nhis brain in his efforts to create a memory as to the cheque, and\nsucceeded in bringing to his mind a recollection that he had once\nknown something about the cheque,--that the cheque had at one time\nbeen the subject of a thought and of a resolution,--he admitted to\nhimself that in accordance with all law and all reason he must be\nregarded as a thief. He had taken and used and spent that which he\nought to have known was not his own;--which he would have known\nnot to be his own but for some terrible incapacity with which God\nhad afflicted him. What then must be the result? His mind was\nclear enough about this. If the jury could see everything and know\neverything,--as he would wish that they should do; and if this\nbishop's commission, and the bishop himself, and the Court of\nArches with its judge, could see and know everything; and if so\nseeing and so knowing they could act with clear honesty and perfect\nwisdom,--what would they do? They would declare of him that he was\nnot a thief, only because he was so muddy-minded, so addle-pated as\nnot to know the difference between meum and tuum! There could be no\nother end to it, let all the lawyers and all the clergymen in England\nput their wits to it. Though he knew himself to be muddy-minded and\naddle-pated, he could see that. And could any one say of such a man\nthat he was fit to be the acting clergyman of a parish,--to have a\nfreehold possession in a parish as curer of men's souls! The bishop\nwas in the right of it, let him be ten times as mean a fellow as he\nwas.\n\nAnd yet as he sat there on the gate, while the rain came down heavily\nupon him, even when admitting the justice of the bishop, and the\ntruth of the verdict which the jury would no doubt give, and the\npropriety of the action which that cold, reasonable, prosperous man\nat Silverbridge would take, he pitied himself with a tenderness of\ncommiseration which knew no bounds. As for those belonging to him,\nhis wife and children, his pity for them was of a different kind. He\nwould have suffered any increase of suffering, could he by such agony\nhave released them. Dearly as he loved them, he would have severed\nhimself from them, had it been possible. Terrible thoughts as to\ntheir fate had come into his mind in the worst moments of his\nmoodiness,--thoughts which he had had sufficient strength and\nmanliness to put away from him with a strong hand, lest they should\ndrive him to crime indeed; and these had come from the great pity\nwhich he had felt for them. But the commiseration which he had felt\nfor himself had been different from this, and had mostly visited him\nat times when that other pity was for the moment in abeyance. What\nthough he had taken the cheque, and spent the money though it was not\nhis? He might be guilty before the law, but he was not guilty before\nGod. There had never been a thought of theft in his mind, or a desire\nto steal in his heart. He knew that well enough. No jury could make\nhim guilty of theft before God. And what though this mixture of guilt\nand innocence had come from madness,--from madness which these courts\nmust recognize if they chose to find him innocent of the crime? In\nspite of his aberrations of intellect, if there were any such, his\nministrations in his parish were good. Had he not preached fervently\nand well,--preaching the true gospel? Had he not been very diligent\namong his people, striving with all his might to lessen the ignorance\nof the ignorant, and to gild with godliness the learning of the\ninstructed? Had he not been patient, enduring, instant, and in all\nthings amenable to the laws and regulations laid down by the Church\nfor his guidance in his duties as a parish clergyman? Who could point\nout in what he had been astray, or where he had gone amiss? But for\nthe work which he had done with so much zeal the Church which he\nserved had paid him so miserable a pittance that, though life and\nsoul had been kept together, the reason, or a fragment of the reason,\nhad at moments escaped from his keeping in the scramble. Hence it was\nthat this terrible calamity had fallen upon him! Who had been tried\nas he had been tried, and had gone through such fire with less loss\nof intellectual power than he had done? He was still a scholar,\nthough no brother scholar ever came near him, and would make\nGreek iambics as he walked along the lanes. His memory was stored\nwith poetry, though no book ever came to his hands, except those\nshorn and tattered volumes which lay upon his table. Old problems\nin trigonometry were the pleasing relaxations of his mind, and\ncomplications of figures were a delight to him. There was not one of\nthose prosperous clergymen around him, and who scorned him, whom he\ncould not have instructed in Hebrew. It was always a gratification to\nhim to remember that his old friend the dean was weak in his Hebrew.\nHe, with these acquirements, with these fitnesses, had been thrust\ndown to the ground,--to the very granite,--and because in that harsh\nheartless thrusting his intellect had for moments wavered as to\ncommon things, cleaving still to all its grander, nobler possessions,\nhe was now to be rent in pieces and scattered to the winds, as being\naltogether vile, worthless, and worse than worthless. It was thus\nthat he thought of himself, pitying himself, as he sat upon the gate,\nwhile the rain fell ruthlessly on his shoulders.\n\nHe pitied himself with a commiseration that was sickly in spite\nof its truth. It was the fault of the man that he was imbued too\nstrongly with self-consciousness. He could do a great thing or two.\nHe could keep up his courage in positions which would wash all\ncourage out of most men. He could tell the truth though truth should\nruin him. He could sacrifice all that he had to duty. He could do\njustice though the heaven should fall. But he could not forget to pay\na tribute to himself for the greatness of his own actions; nor, when\naccepting with an effort of meekness the small payment made by the\nworld to him, in return for his great works, could he forget the\ngreat payments made to others for small work. It was not sufficient\nfor him to remember that he knew Hebrew, but he must remember also\nthat the dean did not.\n\nNevertheless, as he sat there under the rain, he made up his mind\nwith a clearness that certainly had in it nothing of that muddiness\nof mind of which he had often accused himself. Indeed, the intellect\nof this man was essentially clear. It was simply his memory that\nwould play him tricks,--his memory as to things which at the moment\nwere not important to him. The fact that the dean had given him money\nwas very important, and he remembered it well. But the amount of the\nmoney, and its form, at a moment in which he had flattered himself\nthat he might have strength to leave it unused, had not been\nimportant to him. Now, he resolved that he would go to Dr. Tempest,\nand that he would tell Dr. Tempest that there was no occasion for\nany further inquiry. He would submit to the bishop, let the bishop's\ndecision be what it might. Things were different since the day on\nwhich he had refused Mr. Thumble admission to his pulpit. At that\ntime people believed him to be innocent, and he so believed of\nhimself. Now, people believed him to be guilty, and it could not\nbe right that a man held in such slight esteem should exercise the\nfunctions of a parish priest, let his own opinion of himself be what\nit might. He would submit himself, and go anywhere,--to the galleys\nor the workhouse, if they wished it. As for his wife and children,\nthey would, he said to himself, be better without him than with him.\nThe world would never be so hard to a woman or to children as it had\nbeen to him.\n\nHe was sitting saturated with rain,--saturated also with\nthinking,--and quite unobservant of anything around him, when he\nwas accosted by an old man from Hoggle End, with whom he was well\nacquainted. \"Thee be wat, Master Crawley,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Wet!\" said Crawley, recalled suddenly back to the realities of life.\n\"Well,--yes. I am wet. That's because it's raining.\"\n\n\"Thee be teeming o' wat. Hadn't thee better go whome?\"\n\n\"And are not you wet also?\" said Mr. Crawley, looking at the old man,\nwho had been at work in the brickfield, and who was soaked with mire,\nand from whom there seemed to come a steam of muddy mist.\n\n\"Is it me, yer reverence? I'm wat in course. The loikes of us is\nalways wat,--that is barring the insides of us. It comes to us\nnatural to have the rheumatics. How is one of us to help hisself\nagainst having on 'em? But there ain't no call for the loikes of you\nto have the rheumatics.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Crawley, who was now standing on the road,--and\nas he spoke he put out his arm and took the brickmaker by the hand,\n\"there is a worse complaint than rheumatism,--there is, indeed.\"\n\n\"There's what they calls the collerer,\" said Giles Hoggett, looking\nup into Mr. Crawley's face. \"That ain't a got a hold of yer?\"\n\n\"Ay, and worse than the cholera. A man is killed all over when he is\nstruck in his pride;--and yet he lives.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's bad enough too,\" said Giles, with his hand still held\nby the other.\n\n\"It is bad enough,\" said Mr. Crawley, striking his breast with his\nleft hand. \"It is bad enough.\"\n\n\"Tell 'ee what, Master Crawley;--and yer reverence mustn't think as\nI means to be preaching; there ain't nowt a man can't bear if he'll\nonly be dogged. You go whome, Master Crawley, and think o' that,\nand maybe it'll do ye a good yet. It's dogged as does it. It ain't\nthinking about it.\" Then Giles Hoggett withdrew his hand from the\nclergyman's, and walked away towards his home at Hoggle End. Mr.\nCrawley also turned homewards, and as he made his way through the\nlanes, he repeated to himself Giles Hoggett's words. \"It's dogged as\ndoes it. It's not thinking about it.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"It's dogged as does it.\"]\n\nHe did not say a word to his wife on that afternoon about Dr.\nTempest; and she was so much taken up with his outward condition\nwhen he returned, as almost to have forgotten the letter. He allowed\nhimself, but barely allowed himself, to be made dry, and then for\nthe remainder of the day applied himself to learn the lesson which\nHoggett had endeavoured to teach him. But the learning of it was not\neasy, and hardly became more easy when he had worked the problem out\nin his own mind, and discovered that the brickmaker's doggedness\nsimply meant self-abnegation;--that a man should force himself to\nendure anything that might be sent upon him, not only without outward\ngrumbling, but also without grumbling inwardly.\n\nEarly on the next morning, he told his wife that he was going into\nSilverbridge. \"It is that letter,--the letter which I got yesterday\nthat calls me,\" he said. And then he handed her the letter as to\nwhich he had refused to speak to her on the preceding day.\n\n\"But this speaks of your going next Monday, Josiah,\" said Mrs.\nCrawley.\n\n\"I find it to be more suitable that I should go to-day,\" said he.\n\"Some duty I do owe in this matter, both to the bishop, and to Dr.\nTempest, who, after a fashion, is, as regards my present business,\nthe bishop's representative. But I do not perceive that I owe it as a\nduty to either to obey implicitly their injunctions, and I will not\nsubmit myself to the cross-questionings of the man Thumble. As I am\npurposed at present I shall express my willingness to give up the\nparish.\"\n\n\"Give up the parish altogether?\"\n\n\"Yes, altogether.\" As he spoke he clasped both his hands together,\nand having held them for a moment on high, allowed them to fall thus\nclasped before him. \"I cannot give it up in part; I cannot abandon\nthe duties and reserve the honorarium. Nor would I if I could.\"\n\n\"I did not mean that, Josiah. But pray think of it before you speak.\"\n\n\"I have thought of it, and I will think of it. Farewell, my dear.\"\nThen he came up to her and kissed her, and started on his journey on\nfoot to Silverbridge.\n\nIt was about noon when he reached Silverbridge, and he was told that\nDoctor Tempest was at home. The servant asked him for a card. \"I have\nno card,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"but I will write my name for your behoof\nif your master's hospitality will allow me paper and pencil.\" The\nname was written, and as Crawley waited in the drawing-room he spent\nhis time in hating Dr. Tempest because the door had been opened by\na man-servant dressed in black. Had the man been in livery he would\nhave hated Dr. Tempest all the same. And he would have hated him a\nlittle had the door been opened even by a smart maid.\n\n\"Your letter came to hand yesterday morning, Dr. Tempest,\" said Mr.\nCrawley, still standing, though the doctor had pointed to a chair for\nhim after shaking hands with him; \"and having given yesterday to the\nconsideration of it, with what judgment I have been able to exercise,\nI have felt it to be incumbent upon me to wait upon you without\nfurther delay, as by doing so I may perhaps assist your views and\nsave labour to those gentlemen who are joined with you in this\ncommission of which you have spoken. To some of them it may possibly\nbe troublesome that they should be brought together here on next\nMonday.\"\n\nDr. Tempest had been looking at him during this speech, and could\nsee by his shoes and trowsers that he had walked from Hogglestock to\nSilverbridge. \"Mr. Crawley, will you not sit down?\" said he, and then\nhe rang his bell. Mr. Crawley sat down, not on the chair indicated,\nbut on one further removed and at the other side of the table. When\nthe servant came,--the objectionable butler in black clothes that\nwere so much smarter than Mr. Crawley's own,--his master's orders\nwere communicated without any audible word, and the man returned with\na decanter and wine-glasses.\n\n\"After your walk, Mr. Crawley,\" said Dr. Tempest, getting up from his\nseat to pour out the wine.\n\n\"None, I thank you.\"\n\n\"Pray let me persuade you. I know the length of the miles so well.\"\n\n\"I will take none, if you please, sir,\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Crawley,\" said Dr. Tempest, \"do let me speak to you as a\nfriend. You have walked eight miles, and are going to talk to me on a\nsubject which is of vital importance to yourself. I won't discuss it\nunless you'll take a glass of wine and a biscuit.\"\n\n\"Dr. Tempest!\"\n\n\"I'm quite in earnest. I won't. If you do as I ask you, you shall\ntalk to me till dinner-time, if you like it. There. Now you may\nbegin.\"\n\nMr. Crawley did eat the biscuit and did drink the wine, and as he did\nso, he acknowledged to himself that Dr. Tempest was right. He felt\nthat the wine made him stronger to speak. \"I hardly know why you have\npreferred to-day to next Monday,\" said Dr. Tempest; \"but if anything\ncan be done by your presence here to-day, your time shall not be\nthrown away.\"\n\n\"I have preferred to-day to Monday,\" said Crawley, \"partly because I\nwould sooner talk to one man than to five.\"\n\n\"There is something in that, certainly,\" said Dr. Tempest.\n\n\"And as I have made up my mind as to the course of action which it\nis my duty to take in the matter to which your letter of the 9th of\nthis month refers, there can be no reason why I should postpone the\ndeclaration of my purpose. Dr. Tempest, I have determined to resign\nmy preferment at Hogglestock, and shall write to-day to the Dean of\nBarchester, who is the patron, acquainting him of my purpose.\"\n\n\"You mean in the event--in the event--\"\n\n\"I mean, sir, to do this without reference to any event that is\nfuture. The bishop, Dr. Tempest, when I shall have been proved to be\na thief, shall have no trouble either in causing my suspension or\nmy deprivation. The name and fame of a parish clergyman should be\nunstained. Mine have become foul with infamy. I will not wait to be\ndeprived by any court, by any bishop, or by any commission. I will\nbow my head to that public opinion which has reached me, and I will\ndeprive myself.\"\n\nHe had got up from his chair, and was standing as he pronounced the\nfinal sentence against himself. Dr. Tempest still remained seated in\nhis chair, looking at him, and for a few moments there was silence.\n\"You must not do that, Mr. Crawley,\" Dr. Tempest said at last.\n\n\"But I shall do it.\"\n\n\"Then the dean must not take your resignation. Speaking to you\nfrankly, I tell you that there is no prevailing opinion as to the\nverdict which the jury may give.\"\n\n\"My decision has nothing to do with the jury's verdict. My\ndecision--\"\n\n\"Stop a moment, Mr. Crawley. It is possible that you might say that\nwhich should not be said.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to be said,--nothing which I could say, which\nI would not say at the town cross if it were possible. As to this\nmoney, I do not know whether I stole it or whether I did not.\"\n\n\"That is just what I have thought.\"\n\n\"It is so.\"\n\n\"Then you did not steal it. There can be no doubt about that.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Dr. Tempest. I thank you heartily for saying so much.\nBut, sir, you are not the jury. Nor, if you were, could you whitewash\nme from the infamy which has been cast on me. Against the opinion\nexpressed at the beginning of these proceedings by the bishop of\nthe diocese,--or rather against that expressed by his wife,--I did\nventure to make a stand. Neither the opinion which came from the\npalace, nor the vehicle by which it was expressed, commanded my\nrespect. Since that, others have spoken to whom I feel myself bound\nto yield;--yourself not the least among them, Dr. Tempest;--and to\nthem I shall yield. You may tell the Bishop of Barchester that I\nshall at once resign the perpetual curacy of Hogglestock into the\nhands of the Dean of Barchester, by whom I was appointed.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Crawley; I shall not do that. I cannot control you, but\nthinking you to be wrong, I shall not make that communication to the\nbishop.\"\n\n\"Then I shall do so myself.\"\n\n\"And your wife, Mr. Crawley, and your children?\"\n\nAt that moment Mr. Crawley called to mind the advice of his friend\nGiles Hoggett. \"It's dogged as does it.\" He certainly wanted\nsomething very strong to sustain him in his difficulty. He found that\nthis reference to his wife and children required him to be dogged in\na very marked manner. \"I can only trust that the wind may be tempered\nto them,\" he said. \"They will, indeed, be shorn lambs.\"\n\nDr. Tempest got up from his chair, and took a couple of turns about\nthe room before he spoke again. \"Man,\" he said, addressing Mr.\nCrawley with all his energy, \"if you do this thing, you will then\nat least be very wicked. If the jury find a verdict in your favour\nyou are safe, and the chances are that the verdict will be in your\nfavour.\"\n\n\"I care nothing now for the verdict,\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"And you will turn your wife into the poorhouse for an idea!\"\n\n\"It's dogged as does it,\" said Mr. Crawley to himself. \"I have\nthought of that,\" he said aloud. \"That my wife is dear to me, and\nthat my children are dear, I will not deny. She was softly nurtured,\nDr. Tempest, and came from a house in which want was never known.\nSince she has shared my board she has had some experience of that\nnature. That I should have brought her to all this is very terrible\nto me,--so terrible, that I often wonder how it is that I live. But,\nsir, you will agree with me, that my duty as a clergyman is above\neverything. I do not dare, even for their sake, to remain in the\nparish. Good morning, Dr. Tempest.\" Dr. Tempest, finding that he\ncould not prevail with him, bade him adieu, feeling that any service\nto the Crawleys within his power might be best done by intercession\nwith the bishop and with the dean.\n\nThen Mr. Crawley walked back to Hogglestock, repeating to himself\nGiles Hoggett's words, \"It's dogged as does it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\nMR. CRAWLEY'S LETTER TO THE DEAN.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. Crawley, when he got home after his walk to Silverbridge, denied\nthat he was at all tired. \"The man at Silverbridge, whom I went to\nsee administered refreshment to me;--nay, he administered it with\nsalutary violence,\" he said, affecting even to laugh. \"And I am\nbound to speak well of him on behalf of mercies over and beyond that\nexhibited by the persistent tender of some wine. That I should find\nhim judicious I had expected. What little I have known of him taught\nme so to think of him. But I found with him also a softness of heart\nfor which I had not looked.\"\n\n\"And you will not give up the living, Josiah?\"\n\n\"Most certainly I will. A duty, when it is clear before a man, should\nnever be made less so by any tenderness in others.\" He was still\nthinking of Giles Hoggett. \"It's dogged as does it.\" The poor woman\ncould not answer him. She knew well that it was vain to argue with\nhim. She could only hope that in the event of his being acquitted\nat the trial, the dean, whose friendship she did not doubt, might\nre-endow him with the small benefice which was their only source of\nbread.\n\nOn the following morning there came by post a short note from Dr.\nTempest. \"My dear Mr. Crawley,\" the note ran,\n\n\n   I implore you, if there be yet time, to do nothing rashly.\n   And even although you should have written to the bishop or\n   to the dean, your letters need have no effect, if you will\n   allow me to make them inoperative. Permit me to say that\n   I am a man much older than you, and one who has mixed much\n   both with clergymen and with the world at large. I tell\n   you with absolute confidence, that it is not your duty in\n   your present position to give up your living. Should your\n   conduct ever be called in question on this matter you will\n   be at perfect liberty to say that you were guided by my\n   advice. You should take no step till after the trial.\n   Then, if the verdict be against you, you should submit to\n   the bishop's judgment. If the verdict be in your favour,\n   the bishop's interference will be over.\n\n   And you must remember that if it is not your duty as a\n   clergyman to give up your living, you can have no right,\n   seeing that you have a wife and family, to throw it away\n   as an indulgence to your pride. Consult any other friend\n   you please;--Mr. Robarts, or the dean himself. I am\n   quite sure that any friend who knows as many of the\n   circumstances as I know will advise you to hold the\n   living, at any rate till after the trial. You can refer\n   any such friend to me.\n\n   Believe me to be, yours very truly,\n\n   MORTIMER TEMPEST.\n\n\nMr. Crawley walked about again with this letter in his pocket, but\non this occasion he did not go in the direction of Hoggle End. From\nHoggle End he could hardly hope to pick up further lessons of wisdom.\nWhat could any Giles Hoggett say to him beyond what he had said to\nhim already? If he were to read the doctor's letter to Hoggett, and\nto succeed in making Hoggett understand it all, Hoggett could only\ncaution him to be dogged. But it seemed to him that Hoggett and his\nnew friend at Silverbridge did not agree in their doctrines, and it\nmight be well that he should endeavour to find out which of them had\nmost of justice on his side. He was quite sure that Hoggett would\nadvise him to adhere to his project of giving up the living,--if only\nHoggett could be made to understand the circumstances.\n\nHe had written, but had not as yet sent away his letter to the dean.\n\nHis letter to the bishop would be but a note, and he had postponed\nthe writing of that till the other should be copied and made\ncomplete.\n\nHe had sat up late into the night composing and altering his letter\nto his old friend, and now that the composition was finished he was\nloth to throw it away. Early in this morning, before the postman had\nbrought to him Dr. Tempest's urgent remonstrance, he had shown to his\nwife the draught of his letter to the dean. \"I cannot say that it is\nnot true,\" she had said.\n\n\"It is certainly true.\"\n\n\"But I wish, dear, you would not send it. Why should you take any\nstep till the trial be over?\"\n\n\"I shall assuredly send it,\" he had replied. \"If you will peruse it\nagain, you will see that the epistle would be futile were it kept\ntill I shall have been proved to be a thief.\"\n\n\"Oh, Josiah, such words kill me.\"\n\n\"They are not pleasant, but it will be well that you should become\nused to them. As for the letter, I have taken some trouble to express\nmyself with perspicuity, and I trust that I may have succeeded.\" At\nthat time Hoggett was altogether in the ascendant; but now, as he\nstarted on his walk, his mind was somewhat perturbed by the contrary\nadvice of one, who after all, might be as wise as Hoggett. There\nwould be nothing dogged in the conduct recommended to him by Dr.\nTempest. Were he to follow the doctor's advice, he would be trimming\nhis sails, so as to catch any slant of a breeze that might be\nfavourable to him. There could be no doggedness in a character that\nwould submit to such trimming.\n\nThe postman came to Hogglestock but once in a day, so that he could\nnot despatch his letter till the next morning,--unless, indeed, he\nchose to send it a distance of four miles to the nearest post-office.\nAs there was nothing to justify this, there was another night for\nthe copying of his letter,--should he at last determine to send\nit. He had declared to Dr. Tempest that he would send it. He had\nsworn to his wife that it should go. He had taken much trouble with\nit. He believed in Hoggett. But, nevertheless, this incumbency of\nHogglestock was his all in the world. It might be that he could still\nhold it, and have bread at least for his wife to eat. Dr. Tempest had\ntold him that he would be probably acquitted. Dr. Tempest knew as\nmuch of all the circumstances as did he himself, and had told him\nthat he was not guilty. After all Dr. Tempest knew more about it than\nHoggett knew.\n\nIf he resigned the living, what would become of him,--of him,--of him\nand of his wife? Whither would they first go when they turned their\nback upon the door inside which there had at any rate been shelter\nfor them for many years? He calculated everything that he had, and\nfound that at the end of April, even when he should have received his\nrent-charge, there would not be five pounds in hand among them. As\nfor his furniture, he still owed enough to make it impossible that he\nshould get anything out of that. And these thoughts all had reference\nto his position if he should be acquitted. What would become of his\nwife if he should be convicted? And as for himself, whither should he\ngo when he came out of prison?\n\nHe had completely realized the idea that Hoggett's counsel was\nopposed to that given to him by Dr. Tempest; but then it might\ncertainly be the case that Hoggett had not known all the facts. A man\nshould, no doubt, be dogged when the evils of life are insuperable;\nbut need he be so when the evils can be overcome? Would not Hoggett\nhimself undergo any treatment which he believed to be specific for\nrheumatism? Yes; Hoggett would undergo any treatment that was not in\nitself opposed to his duty. The best treatment for rheumatism might\nbe to stay away from the brick-field on a rainy day; but if so,\nthere would be no money to keep the pot boiling, and Hoggett would\ncertainly go to the brick-field, rheumatism and all, as long as his\nlimbs would carry him there. Yes; he would send his letter. It was\nhis duty, and he would do it. Men looked askance at him, and pointed\nat him as a thief. He would send the letter, in spite of Dr. Tempest.\nLet justice be done, though the heaven may fall.\n\nHe had heard of Lady Lufton's offer to his wife. The offers of the\nLady Luftons of the world had been sorely distressing to his spirit,\nsince it had first come to pass that such offers had reached him in\nconsequence of his poverty. But now there was something almost of\nrelief to him in the thought that the Lady Luftons would, after some\nfashion, save his wife and children from starvation;--would save his\nwife from the poorhouse, and enable his children to have a start in\nthe world. For one of his children a brilliant marriage might be\nprovided,--if only he himself were out of the way. How could he take\nhimself out of the way? It had been whispered to him that he might be\nimprisoned for two months,--or for two years. Would it not be a grand\nthing if the judge would condemn him to be imprisoned for life? Was\nthere ever a man whose existence was so purposeless, so useless, so\ndeleterious, as his own? And yet he knew Hebrew well, whereas the\ndean knew but very little Hebrew. He could make Greek iambics, and\ndoubted whether the bishop knew the difference between an iambus\nand a trochee. He could disport himself with trigonometry, feeling\nconfident that Dr. Tempest had forgotten his way over the asses'\nbridge. He knew \"Lycidas\" by heart; and as for Thumble, he felt\nquite sure that Thumble was incompetent of understanding a single\nallusion in that divine poem. Nevertheless, though all this wealth of\nacquirement was his, it would be better for himself, better for those\nwho belonged to him, better for the world at large, that he should be\nput an end to. A sentence of penal servitude for life, without any\ntrial, would be of all things the most desirable. Then there would be\nample room for the practice of that virtue which Hoggett had taught\nhim.\n\nWhen he returned home the Hoggethan doctrine prevailed, and he\nprepared to copy his letter. But before he commenced his task, he\nsat down with his youngest daughter, and read,--or made her read\nto him,--a passage out of a Greek poem, in which are described the\ntroubles and agonies of a blind giant. No giant would have been\nmore powerful,--only that he was blind, and could not see to avenge\nhimself on those who had injured him. \"The same story is always\ncoming up,\" he said, stopping the girl in her reading. \"We have it in\nvarious versions, because it is so true to life.\n\n   Ask for this great deliverer now, and find him\n   Eyeless in Gaza, at the mill with slaves.\n\nIt is the same story. Great power reduced to impotence, great glory\nto misery, by the hand of Fate,--Necessity, as the Greeks called\nher; the goddess that will not be shunned! At the mill with slaves!\nPeople, when they read it, do not appreciate the horror of the\npicture. Go on, my dear. It may be a question whether Polyphemus\nhad mind enough to suffer; but, from the description of his power,\nI should think that he had. 'At the mill with slaves!' Can any\npicture be more dreadful than that? Go on, my dear. Of course you\nremember Milton's Samson Agonistes. Agonistes indeed!\" His wife was\nsitting stitching at the other side of the room; but she heard his\nwords,--heard and understood them; and before Jane could again get\nherself into the swing of the Greek verse, she was over at her\nhusband's side, with her arms round his neck. \"My love!\" she said.\n\"My love!\"\n\nHe turned to her, and smiled as he spoke to her. \"These are old\nthoughts with me. Polyphemus and Belisarius, and Samson and Milton,\nhave always been pets of mine. The mind of the strong blind creature\nmust be so sensible of the injury that has been done to him! The\nimpotency, combined with his strength, or rather the impotency\nwith the memory of former strength and former aspirations, is so\nessentially tragic!\"\n\nShe looked into his eyes as he spoke, and there was something of\nthe flash of old days, when the world was young to them, and when\nhe would tell her of his hopes, and repeat to her long passages\nof poetry, and would criticize for her advantage the works of old\nwriters. \"Thank God,\" she said, \"that you are not blind. It may yet\nbe all right with you.\"\n\n\"Yes,--it may be,\" he said.\n\n\"And you shall not be at the mill with slaves.\"\n\n\"Or, at any rate, not eyeless in Gaza, if the Lord is good to me.\nCome, Jane, we will go on.\" Then he took up the passage himself, and\nread it on with clear, sonorous voice, every now and then explaining\nsome passage or expressing his own ideas upon it, as though he were\nreally happy with his poetry.\n\nIt was late in the evening before he got out his small stock of best\nletter-paper, and sat down to work at his letter. He first addressed\nhimself to the bishop; and what he wrote to the bishop was as\nfollows:--\n\n\n   Hogglestock Parsonage, April llth, 186--.\n\n   MY LORD BISHOP,\n\n   I have been in communication with Dr. Tempest, of\n   Silverbridge, from whom I have learned that your lordship\n   has been pleased to appoint a commission of inquiry,--of\n   which commission he is the chairman,--with reference to\n   the proceedings which it may be necessary that you should\n   take, as bishop of this diocese, after my forthcoming\n   trial at the approaching Barchester assizes. My lord, I\n   think it right to inform you, partly with a view to the\n   comfort of the gentlemen named on that commission, and\n   partly with the purport of giving you that information\n   which I think that a bishop should possess in regard to\n   the clerical affairs of his own diocese, that I have by\n   this post resigned my preferment at Hogglestock into the\n   hands of the Dean of Barchester, by whom it was given\n   to me. In these circumstances, it will, I suppose, be\n   unnecessary for you to continue the commission which you\n   have set in force; but as to that, your lordship will, of\n   course, be the only judge.\n\n   I have the honour to be, my Lord Bishop,\n   Your most obedient and very humble servant,\n\n   JOSIAH CRAWLEY,\n   Perpetual Curate of Hogglestock\n\n   The Right Reverend\n   The Bishop of Barchester,\n   &c. &c. &c.\n   The Palace, Barchester.\n\n\nBut the letter which was of real importance,--which was intended to\nsay something,--was that to the dean, and that also shall be given to\nthe reader. Mr. Crawley had been for a while in doubt how he should\naddress his old friend in commencing this letter, understanding that\nits tone throughout must, in a great degree, be made conformable with\nits first words. He would fain, in his pride, have begun \"Sir.\" The\nquestion was between that and \"My dear Arabin.\" It had once between\nthem always been \"Dear Frank\" and \"Dear Joe;\" but the occasions for\n\"Dear Frank\" and \"Dear Joe\" between them had long been past. Crawley\nwould have been very angry had he now been called Joe by the dean,\nand would have bitten his tongue out before he would have called the\ndean Frank. His better nature, however, now prevailed, and he began\nhis letter, and completed it as follows:--\n\n\n   MY DEAR ARABIN,\n\n   Circumstances, of which you have probably heard something,\n   compel me to write to you, as I fear, at some length. I am\n   sorry that the trouble of such a letter should be forced\n   upon you during your holidays;--\n\nMr. Crawley, as he wrote this, did not forget to remind himself that\nhe never had any holidays;\n\n   --but I think you will admit, if you will bear with me to\n   the end, that I have no alternative.\n\n   I have been accused of stealing a cheque for twenty\n   pounds, which cheque was drawn by my Lord Lufton on his\n   London bankers, and was lost out of his pocket by Mr.\n   Soames, his lordship's agent, and was so lost, as Mr.\n   Soames states,--not with an absolute assertion,--during a\n   visit which he made to my parsonage here at Hogglestock.\n   Of the fact that I paid the cheque to a tradesman in\n   Silverbridge there is no doubt. When questioned about it,\n   I first gave an answer which was so manifestly incorrect\n   that it has seemed odd to me that I should not have had\n   credit for a mistake from those who must have seen that\n   detection was so evident. The blunder was undoubtedly\n   stupid, and it now bears heavy on me. I then, as I have\n   learned, made another error,--of which I am aware that you\n   have been informed. I said that the cheque had come to me\n   from you, and in saying so, I thought that it had formed\n   a portion of that alms which your open-handed benevolence\n   bestowed upon me when I attended on you, not long before\n   your departure, in your library. I have striven to\n   remember the facts. It may be,--nay, it probably is the\n   case,--that such struggles to catch some accurate glimpse\n   of bygone things do not trouble you. Your mind is, no\n   doubt, clearer and stronger than mine, having been kept\n   to its proper tune by greater and fitter work. With me,\n   memory is all but gone, and the power of thinking is on\n   the wane! I struggled to remember, and I thought that\n   the cheque had been in the envelope which you handed to\n   me,--and I said so. I have since learned, from tidings\n   received, as I am told, direct from yourself, that I was\n   as wrong in the second statement as I had been in the\n   first. The double blunder has, of course, been very heavy\n   on me.\n\n   I was taken before the magistrates at Silverbridge, and\n   was by them committed to stand my trial at the assizes to\n   be holden in Barchester on the 28th of this month. Without\n   doubt, the magistrates had no alternative but to commit\n   me, and I am indebted to them that they have allowed me my\n   present liberty upon bail. That my sufferings in all this\n   should have been grievous, you will understand. But on\n   that head I should not touch, were it not that I am bound\n   to explain to you that my troubles in reference to this\n   parish of Hogglestock, to which I was appointed by you,\n   have not been the slightest of those sufferings. I felt at\n   first, believing then that the world around me would think\n   it unlikely that such a one as I had wilfully stolen a sum\n   of money, that it was my duty to maintain myself in my\n   church. I did so maintain myself against an attack made\n   upon me by the bishop, who sent over to Hogglestock one\n   Mr. Thumble, a gentleman doubtless in holy orders, though\n   I know nothing and can learn nothing of the place of his\n   cure, to dispossess me of my pulpit and to remove me from\n   my ministrations among my people. To Mr. Thumble I turned\n   a deaf ear, and would not let him so much as open his\n   mouth inside the porch of my church. Up to this time I\n   myself have read the services, and have preached to the\n   people, and have continued, as best I could, my visits to\n   the poor and my labours in the school, though I know,--no\n   one knows as well,--how unfitted I am for such work by the\n   grief which has fallen upon me.\n\n   Then the bishop sent for me, and I thought it becoming on\n   my part to go to him. I presented myself to his lordship\n   at his palace, and was minded to be much governed in my\n   conduct by what he might say to me, remembering that I am\n   bound to respect the office, even though I may not approve\n   the man; and I humbled myself before his lordship, waiting\n   patiently for any directions which he in his discretion\n   might think it proper to bestow on me. But there arose up\n   between us that very pestilent woman, his wife,--to his\n   dismay, seemingly, as much as to mine,--and she would\n   let there be place for no speech but her own. If there\n   be aught clear to me in ecclesiastical matters, it is\n   this,--that no authority can be delegated to a female. The\n   special laws of this and of some other countries do allow\n   that women shall sit upon the temporal thrones of the\n   earth, but on the lowest step of the throne of the Church\n   no woman has been allowed to sit as bearing authority,\n   the romantic tale of the woman Pope notwithstanding.\n   Thereupon, I left the palace in wrath, feeling myself\n   aggrieved that a woman should have attempted to dictate\n   to me, and finding it hopeless to get a clear instruction\n   from his lordship,--the woman taking up the word whenever\n   I put a question to my lord the bishop. Nothing,\n   therefore, came of that interview but fruitless labour to\n   myself, and anger, of which I have since been ashamed.\n\n   Since that time I have continued in my parish,--working,\n   not without zeal, though in truth, almost without\n   hope,--and learning even from day to day that the opinions\n   of men around me have declared me to be guilty of the\n   crime imputed to me. And now the bishop has issued a\n   commission as preparatory to proceeding against me under\n   the Act for the punishment of clerical offences. In doing\n   this, I cannot say that the bishop has been ill-advised,\n   even though the advice may have come from that\n   evil-tongued lady, his wife. And I hold that a woman may\n   be called on for advice, with most salutary effect, in\n   affairs as to which any show of female authority would be\n   equally false and pernicious. With me it has ever been so,\n   and I have had a counsellor by me as wise as she has been\n   devoted.\n\nIt must be noticed that in the draught copy of his letter which Mr.\nCrawley gave to his wife to read this last sentence was not inserted.\nIntending that she should read his letter, he omitted it till he made\nthe fair copy.\n\n   Over this commission his lordship has appointed Dr.\n   Tempest of Silverbridge to preside, and with him I have\n   been in communication. I trust that the labours of the\n   gentlemen of whom it is composed may be brought to a\n   speedy close; and, having regard to their trouble, which\n   in such a matter is, I fear, left without remuneration, I\n   have informed Dr. Tempest that I should write this letter\n   to you with the intent and assured purpose of resigning\n   the perpetual curacy of Hogglestock into your hands.\n\n   You will be good enough, therefore, to understand that\n   I do so resign the living, and that I shall continue to\n   administer the services of the church only till some\n   clergyman, certified to me as coming from you or from\n   the bishop, may present himself in the parish, and shall\n   declare himself prepared to undertake the cure. Should it\n   be so that Mr. Thumble be sent hither again, I will sit\n   under him, endeavouring to catch improvement from his\n   teaching, and striving to overcome the contempt which I\n   felt for him when he before visited this parish. I annex\n   beneath my signature a copy of the letter which I have\n   written to the bishop on this subject.\n\n   And now it behoves me, as the guardianship of the souls of\n   those around me was placed in my hands by you, to explain\n   to you as shortly as may be possible the reasons which\n   have induced me to abandon my work. One or two whose\n   judgment I do not discredit,--and I am allowed to name\n   Dr. Tempest of Silverbridge as one,--have suggested to me\n   that I should take no step myself till after my trial.\n   They think that I should have regard to the chance of the\n   verdict, so that the preferment may still be mine should\n   I be acquitted; and they say, that should I be acquitted,\n   the bishop's action against me must of necessity cease.\n   That they are right in these facts I do not doubt; but\n   in giving such advice they look only to facts, having no\n   regard to the conscience. I do not blame them. I should\n   give such advice myself, knowing that a friend may give\n   counsel as to outer things, but that a man must satisfy\n   his inner conscience by his own perceptions of what is\n   right and what is wrong.\n\n   I find myself to be ill-spoken of, to be regarded with\n   hard eyes by those around me, my people thinking that I\n   have stolen this money. Two farmers in this parish have,\n   as I am aware, expressed opinions that no jury could\n   acquit me honestly, and neither of these men have appeared\n   in my church since the expression of that opinion. I doubt\n   whether they have gone to other churches; and if not they\n   have been deterred from all public worship by my presence.\n   If this be so, how can I with a clear conscience remain\n   among these men? Shall I take from their hands wages for\n   those administrations, which their deliberately formed\n   opinions will not allow them to accept from my hands?\n\nAnd yet, though he thus pleaded against himself, he knew that the two\nmen of whom he was speaking were thick-headed dolts who were always\ntipsy on Saturday nights, and who came to church perhaps once in\nthree weeks.\n\n   Your kind heart will doubtless prompt you to tell me\n   that no clergyman could be safe in his parish if he were\n   to allow the opinion of chance parishioners to prevail\n   against him; and you would probably lay down for my\n   guidance that grand old doctrine, \"Nil conscire sibi,\n   null\u00c3\u00a2 pallescere culp\u00c3\u00a2.\" Presuming that you may do so, I\n   will acknowledge such guidance to be good. If my mind were\n   clear in this matter, I would not budge an inch for any\n   farmer,--no, nor for any bishop, further than he might by\n   law compel me! But my mind is not clear. I do grow pale,\n   and my hair stands on end with horror, as I confess to\n   myself that I do not know whether I stole this money or\n   no! Such is the fact. In all sincerity I tell you that I\n   know not whether I be guilty or innocent. It may be that\n   I picked up the cheque from the floor of my room, and\n   afterwards took it out and used it, not knowing whence it\n   had come to me. If it be so, I stole it, and am guilty\n   before the laws of my country. If it be so, I am not fit\n   to administer the Lord's sacraments to these people. When\n   the cup was last in my hand and I was blessing them,\n   I felt that I was not fit, and I almost dropped the\n   chalice. That God will know my weakness and pardon me\n   the perplexity of my mind,--that is between Him and His\n   creature.\n\n   As I read my letter over to myself I feel how weak are my\n   words, and how inefficient to explain to you the exact\n   position in which I stand; but they will suffice to\n   convince you that I am assuredly purposed to resign this\n   parish of Hogglestock, and that it is therefore incumbent\n   on you, as patron of the living, to nominate my successor\n   to the benefice. I have only further to ask your pardon\n   for this long letter, and to thank you again for the many\n   and great marks of friendship which you have conferred on\n   me. Alas, could you have foreseen in those old days how\n   barren of all good would have been the life of him you\n   then esteemed, you might perhaps have escaped the disgrace\n   of being called the friend of one whom no one now regards\n   with esteem.\n\n   Nevertheless, I may still say that I am,\n   With all affection, yours truly,\n\n   JOSIAH CRAWLEY.\n\n\nThe last paragraph of the letter was also added since his wife had\nread it. When he had first composed his letter, he had been somewhat\nproud of his words, thinking that he had clearly told his story. But\nwhen, sitting alone at his desk, he read it again, filling his mind\nas he went on with ideas which he would fain have expressed to his\nold friend, were it not that he feared to indulge himself with too\nmany words, he began to tell himself that his story was anything but\nwell told. There was no expression there of the Hoggethan doctrine.\nIn answer to such a letter as that the dean might well say, \"Think\nagain of it. Try yet to save yourself. Never mind the two farmers, or\nMr. Thumble, or the bishop. Stick to the ship while there is a plank\nabove the water.\" Whereas it had been his desire to use words that\nshould make the dean clearly understand that the thing was decided.\nHe had failed,--as he had failed in everything throughout his life;\nbut nevertheless the letter must go. Were he to begin again he would\nnot do it better. So he added to what he had written a copy of his\nnote to the bishop, and the letter was fastened and sent.\n\nMrs. Crawley might probably have been more instant in her efforts\nto stop the letter, had she not felt that it would not decide\neverything. In the first place it was not improbable that the letter\nmight not reach the dean till after his return home,--and Mrs.\nCrawley had long since made up her mind that she would see the dean\nas soon as possible after his return. She had heard from Lady Lufton\nthat it was not doubted in Barchester that he would be back at any\nrate before the judges came into the city. And then, in the next\nplace, was it probable that the dean would act upon such a letter by\nfilling up the vacancy, even if he did get it? She trusted in the\ndean, and knew that he would help them, if any help were possible.\nShould the verdict go against her husband, then indeed it might be\nthat no help would be possible. In such case she thought that the\nbishop with his commission might prevail. But she still believed\nthat the verdict would be favourable,--if not with an assured belief,\nstill with a hope that was sufficient to stand in lieu of a belief.\nNo single man, let alone no twelve men, could think that her husband\nhad intended to appropriate that money dishonestly. That he had\ntaken it improperly,--without real possession,--she herself believed;\nbut he had not taken it as a thief, and could not merit a thief's\npunishment.\n\nAfter two days he got a reply from the bishop's chaplain, in which\nthe chaplain expressed the bishop's commendation of Mr. Crawley's\npresent conduct. \"Mr. Thumble shall proceed from hence to Hogglestock\non next Sunday,\" said the chaplain, \"and shall relieve you for the\npresent from the burden of your duties. As to the future status of\nthe parish, it will perhaps be best that nothing shall be done till\nthe dean returns,--or perhaps till the assizes shall be over. This is\nthe bishop's opinion.\" It need hardly be explained that the promised\nvisit of Mr. Thumble to Hogglestock was gall and wormwood to Mr.\nCrawley. He had told the dean that should Mr. Thumble come, he would\nendeavour to learn something even from him. But it may be doubted\nwhether Mr. Crawley in his present mood could learn anything useful\nfrom Mr. Thumble. Giles Hoggett was a much more effective teacher.\n\n\"I will endure even that,\" he said to his wife, as she handed to him\nback the letter from the bishop's chaplain.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\nTWO VISITORS TO HOGGLESTOCK.\n\n\nThe cross-grainedness of men is so great that things will often\nbe forced to go wrong, even when they have the strongest possible\nnatural tendency of their own to go right. It was so now in these\naffairs between the archdeacon and his son. The original difficulty\nwas solved by the good feeling of the young lady,--by that and by\nthe real kindness of the archdeacon's nature. They had come to terms\nwhich were satisfactory to both of them, and those terms admitted of\nperfect reconciliation between the father and his son. Whether the\nmajor did marry the lady or whether he did not, his allowance was to\nbe continued to him, the archdeacon being perfectly willing to trust\nhimself in the matter to the pledge which he had received from Miss\nCrawley. All that he required from his son was simply this,--that he\nshould pull down the bills advertising the sale of his effects. Was\nany desire ever more rational? The sale had been advertised for a day\njust one week in advance of the assizes, and the time must have been\nselected,--so thought the archdeacon,--with a malicious intention.\nWhy, at any rate, should the things be sold before any one knew\nwhether the father of the young lady was or was not to be regarded\nas a thief? And why should the things be sold at all, when the\narchdeacon had tacitly withdrawn his threats,--when he had given his\nson to understand that the allowance would still be paid quarterly\nwith the customary archidiaconal regularity, and that no alteration\nwas intended in those settlements under which the Plumstead foxes\nwould, in the ripeness of time, become the property of the major\nhimself. It was thus that the archdeacon looked at it, and as he did\nso, he thought that his son was the most cross-grained of men.\n\nBut the major had his own way of looking at the matter. He had, he\nflattered himself, dealt very fairly with his father. When he had\nfirst made up his mind to make Miss Crawley his wife, he had told\nhis father of his intention. The archdeacon had declared that, if he\ndid so, such and such results would follow,--results which, as was\napparent to every one, would make it indispensable that the major\nshould leave Cosby Lodge. The major had never complained. So he\ntold himself. He had simply said to his father,--\"I shall do as I\nhave said. You can do as you have said. Therefore, I shall prepare\nto leave Cosby Lodge.\" He had so prepared; and as a part of that\npreparation, the auctioneer's bills had been stuck up on the posts\nand walls. Then the archdeacon had gone to work surreptitiously with\nthe lady,--the reader will understand that we are still following\nthe workings of the major's mind,--and having succeeded in obtaining\na pledge which he had been wrong to demand, came forward very\ngraciously to withdraw his threats. He withdrew his threats because\nhe had succeeded in his object by other means. The major knew nothing\nof the kiss that had been given, of the two tears that had trickled\ndown his father's nose, of the generous epithets which the archdeacon\nhad applied to Grace. He did not guess how nearly his father had\nyielded altogether beneath the pressure of Grace's charms,--how\nwilling he was to yield altogether at the first decent opportunity.\nHis father had obtained a pledge from Grace that she would not marry\nin certain circumstances,--as to which circumstances the major was\nstrongly resolved that they should form no bar to his marriage,--and\nthen came forward with his eager demand that the sale should be\nstopped! The major could not submit to so much indignity. He had\nresolved that his father should have nothing to do with his marriage\none way or the other. He would not accept anything from his father\non the understanding that his father had any such right. His father\nhad asserted such right with threats, and he, the major, taking such\nthreats as meaning something, had seen that he must leave Cosby\nLodge. Let his father come forward, and say that they meant nothing,\nthat he abandoned all right to any interference as to his son's\nmarriage, and then the son--would dutifully consent to accept his\nfather's bounty! They were both cross-grained, as Mrs. Grantly\ndeclared; but I think that the major was the most cross-grained of\nthe two.\n\nSomething of the truth made its way into Henry Grantly's mind as he\ndrove himself home from Barchester after seeing his grandfather. It\nwas not that he began to think that his father was right, but that\nhe almost perceived that it might be becoming in him to forgive some\nfault in his father. He had been implored to honour his father, and\nhe was willing to do so, understanding that such honour must, to a\ncertain degree, imply obedience,--if it could be done at no more than\na moderate expense to his feelings. The threatened auctioneer was the\ncause of offence to his father, and he might see whether it would not\nbe possible to have the sale postponed. There would, of course, be a\npecuniary loss, and that in his diminished circumstances,--he would\nstill talk to himself of his diminished circumstances,--might be\ninconvenient. But so much he thought himself bound to endure on his\nfather's behalf. At any rate, he would consult the auctioneer at\nSilverbridge.\n\nBut he would not make any pause in the measures which he had proposed\nto himself as likely to be conducive to his marriage. As for Grace's\npledge, such pledges from young ladies never went for anything. It\nwas out of the question that she should be sacrificed, even though\nher father had taken the money. And, moreover, the very gist of the\nmajor's generosity was to consist in his marrying her whether the\nfather were guilty or innocent. He understood that perfectly, and\nunderstood also that it was his duty to make his purpose in this\nrespect known to Grace's family. He determined, therefore, that he\nwould go over to Hogglestock, and see Mr. Crawley before he saw the\nauctioneer.\n\nHitherto Major Grantly had never even spoken to Mr. Crawley. It may\nbe remembered that the major was at the present moment one of the\nbailsmen for the due appearance of Mr. Crawley before the judge,\nand that he had been present when the magistrates sat at the inn\nin Silverbridge. He therefore knew the man's presence, but except\non that occasion he had never even seen his intended future\nfather-in-law. From the moment when he had first allowed himself\nto think of Grace, he had desired, yet almost feared, to make\nacquaintance with the father; but had been debarred from doing so by\nthe peculiar position in which Mr. Crawley was placed. He had felt\nthat it would be impossible to speak to the father of his affection\nfor the daughter without any allusion to the coming trial; and he did\nnot know how such allusion could be made. Thinking of this, he had at\ndifferent times almost resolved not to call at Hogglestock till the\ntrial should be over. Then he would go there, let the result of the\ntrial have been what it might. But it had now become necessary for\nhim to go on at once. His father had precipitated matters by his\nappeal to Grace. He would appeal to Grace's father, and reach Grace\nthrough his influence.\n\nHe drove over to Hogglestock, feeling himself to be anything but\ncomfortable as he came near to the house. And when he did reach the\nspot he was somewhat disconcerted to find that another visitor was\nin the house before him. He presumed this to be the case, because\nthere stood a little pony horse,--an animal which did not strongly\nrecommend itself to his instructed eye,--attached by its rein to\nthe palings. It was a poor humble-looking beast, whose knees had\nvery lately become acquainted with the hard and sharp stones of a\nnewly-mended highway. The blood was even now red upon the wounds.\n\n\"He'll never be much good again,\" said the major to his servant.\n\n\"That he won't, sir,\" said the man. \"But I don't think he's been very\nmuch good for some time back.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't like to have to ride him into Silverbridge,\" said the\nmajor, descending from the gig, and instructing his servant to move\nthe horse and gig about as long as he might remain within the house.\nThen he walked across the little garden and knocked at the door.\nThe door was immediately opened, and in the passage he found Mr.\nCrawley, and another clergyman whom the reader will recognize as Mr.\nThumble. Mr. Thumble had come over to make arrangements as to the\nSunday services and the parochial work, and had been very urgent in\nimpressing on Mr. Crawley that the duties were to be left entirely\nto himself. Hence had come some bitter words, in which Mr. Crawley,\nthough no doubt he said the sharper things of the two, had not been\nable to vanquish his enemy so completely as he had done on former\noccasions.\n\n\"There must be no interference, my dear sir,--none whatever, if you\nplease,\" Mr. Thumble had said.\n\n\"There shall be none of which the bishop shall have reason to\ncomplain,\" Mr. Crawley had replied.\n\n\"There must be none at all, Mr. Crawley, if you please. It is only\non that understanding that I have consented to take the parish\ntemporarily into my hands. Mrs. Crawley, I hope that there may be\nno mistake about the schools. It must be exactly as though I were\nresiding on the spot.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Crawley, very irate at this appeal to his wife, and\nspeaking in a loud voice, \"do you misdoubt my word; or do you think\nthat if I were minded to be false to you, that I should be corrected\nin my falsehood by the firmer faith of my wife?\"\n\n\"I meant nothing about falsehood, Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"Having resigned this benefice for certain reasons of my own, with\nwhich I shall not trouble you, and acknowledging as I do,--and have\ndone in writing under my hand to the bishop,--the propriety of his\nlordship's interference in providing for the services of the parish\ntill my successor shall have been instituted, I shall, with what\nfeelings of regret I need not say, leave you to the performance of\nyour temporary duties.\"\n\n\"That is all that I require, Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"But it is wholly unnecessary that you should instruct me in mine.\"\n\n\"The bishop especially desires--\" began Mr. Thumble. But Mr. Crawley\ninterrupted him instantly.--\n\n\"If the bishop has directed you to give me such instruction, the\nbishop has been much in error. I will submit to receive none from him\nthrough you, sir. If you please, sir, let there be an end of it;\" and\nMr. Crawley waved his hand. I hope that the reader will conceive the\ntone of Mr. Crawley's voice, and will appreciate the aspect of his\nface, and will see the motion of his hand, as he spoke these latter\nwords. Mr. Thumble felt the power of the man so sensibly that he was\nunable to carry on the contest. Though Mr. Crawley was now but a\nbroken reed, and was beneath his feet, yet Mr. Thumble acknowledged\nto himself that he could not hold his own in debate with this broken\nreed. But the words had been spoken, and the tone of the voice had\ndied away, and the fire in the eyes had burned itself out before the\nmoment of the major's arrival. Mr. Thumble was now returning to his\nhorse, and having enjoyed,--if he did enjoy,--his little triumph\nabout the parish, was becoming unhappy at the future dangers\nthat awaited him. Perhaps he was the more unhappy because it had\nbeen proposed to him by authorities at the palace that he should\nrepeatedly ride on the same animal from Barchester to Hogglestock\nand back. Mr. Crawley was in the act of replying to lamentations on\nthis subject, with his hand on the latch, when the major arrived--\"I\nregret to say, sir, that I cannot assist you by supplying any other\nsteed.\" Then the major had knocked, and Mr. Crawley had at once\nopened the door.\n\n\"You probably do not remember me, Mr. Crawley?\" said the major. \"I am\nMajor Grantly.\" Mrs. Crawley, who heard these words inside the room,\nsprang up from her chair, and could hardly resist the temptation to\nrush into the passage. She too had barely seen Major Grantly; and\nnow the only bright gleam which appeared on her horizon depended on\nhis constancy under circumstances which would have justified his\ninconstancy. But had he meant to be inconstant, surely he would never\nhave come to Hogglestock!\n\n\"I remember you well, sir,\" said Mr. Crawley. \"I am under no common\nobligation to you. You are at present one of my bailsmen.\"\n\n\"There's nothing in that,\" said the major.\n\nMr. Thumble, who had caught the name of Grantly, took off his hat,\nwhich he had put on his head. He had not been particular in keeping\noff his hat before Mr. Crawley. But he knew very well that Archdeacon\nGrantly was a big man in the diocese; and though the Grantlys and\nthe Proudies were opposed to each other, still it might be well to\ntake off his hat before any one who had to do with the big ones of\nthe diocese. \"I hope your respected father is well, sir?\" said Mr.\nThumble.\n\n\"Pretty well, I thank you.\" The major stood close up against the wall\nof the passage, so as to allow room for Mr. Thumble to pass out. His\nbusiness was one on which he could hardly begin to speak until the\nother visitor should have gone. Mr. Crawley was standing with the\ndoor wide open in his hand. He also was anxious to be rid of Mr.\nThumble,--and was perhaps not so solicitous as a brother clergyman\nshould have been touching the future fate of Mr. Thumble in the\nmatter of the bishop's old cob.\n\n\"Really I don't know what to do as to getting upon him again,\" said\nMr. Thumble.\n\n\"If you will allow him to progress slowly,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"he\nwill probably travel with the greater safety.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you call slow, Mr. Crawley. I was ever so much\nover two hours coming here from Barchester. He stumbled almost at\nevery step.\"\n\n\"Did he fall while you were on him?\" asked the major.\n\n\"Indeed he did, sir. You never saw such a thing, Major Grantly. Look\nhere.\" Then Mr. Thumble, turning round, showed that the rear portion\nof his clothes had not escaped without injury.\n\n\"It was well he was not going fast, or you would have come on to your\nhead,\" said Grantly.\n\n\"It was a mercy,\" said Thumble. \"But, sir, as it was, I came to the\nground with much violence. It was on Spigglewick Hill, where the road\nis covered with loose stones. I see, sir, you have a gig and horse\nhere, with a servant. Perhaps, as the circumstances are so very\npeculiar,--\" Then Mr. Thumble stopped, and looked up into the major's\nface with imploring eyes. But the major had no tenderness for such\nsufferings. \"I'm sorry to say that I am going quite the other way,\"\nhe said. \"I am returning to Silverbridge.\"\n\nMr. Thumble hesitated, and then made a renewed request. \"If you would\nnot mind taking me to Silverbridge, I could get home from thence by\nrailway; and perhaps you would allow your servant to take the horse\nto Barchester.\"\n\nMajor Grantly was for a moment dumfounded. \"The request is most\nunreasonable, sir,\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"That is as Major Grantly pleases to look at it,\" said Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"I am sorry to say that it is quite out of my power,\" said the major.\n\n\"You can surely walk, leading the beast, if you fear to mount him,\"\nsaid Mr. Crawley.\n\n[Illustration: Mrs. Proudie's Emissary.]\n\n\"I shall do as I please about that,\" said Mr. Thumble. \"And, Mr.\nCrawley, if you will have the kindness to leave things in the parish\njust as they are,--just as they are, I will be obliged to you. It is\nthe bishop's wish that you should touch nothing.\" Mr. Thumble was by\nthis time on the step, and Mr. Crawley instantly slammed the door.\n\"The gentleman is a clergyman from Barchester,\" said Mr. Crawley,\nmodestly folding his hands upon his breast, \"whom the bishop has\nsent over here to take upon himself temporarily the services of the\nchurch, and, as it appears, the duties also of the parish. I refrain\nfrom animadverting upon his lordship's choice.\"\n\n\"And are you leaving Hogglestock?\"\n\n\"When I have found a shelter for my wife and children I shall do so;\nnay, peradventure, I must do so before any such shelter can be found.\nI shall proceed in that matter as I am bid. I am one who can regard\nmyself as no longer possessing the privilege of free action in\nanything. But while I have a room at your service, permit me to ask\nyou to enter it.\" Then Mr. Crawley motioned him in with his hand, and\nMajor Grantly found himself in the presence of Mrs. Crawley and her\nyounger daughter.\n\nHe looked at them both for a moment, and could trace much of the\nlines of that face which he loved so well. But the troubles of life\nhad almost robbed the elder lady of her beauty; and with the younger,\nthe awkward thinness of the last years of feminine childhood had not\nyet given place to the fulfilment of feminine grace. But the likeness\nin each was quite enough to make him feel that he ought to be at home\nin that room. He thought that he could love the woman as his mother,\nand the girl as his sister. He found it very difficult to begin any\nconversation in their presence, and yet it seemed to be his duty to\nbegin. Mr. Crawley had marshalled him into the room, and having done\nso, stood aside near the door. Mrs. Crawley had received him very\ngraciously, and having done so, seemed to be ashamed of her own\nhospitality. Poor Jane had shrunk back into a distant corner, near\nthe open standing desk at which she was accustomed to read Greek\nto her father, and, of course, could not be expected to speak. If\nMajor Grantly could have found himself alone with any one of the\nthree,--nay, if he could have been there with any two, he could have\nopened his budget at once; but, before all the family, he felt the\ndifficulty of his situation. \"Mrs. Crawley,\" said he, \"I have been\nmost anxious to make your acquaintance, and I trust you will excuse\nthe liberty I have taken in calling.\"\n\n\"I feel grateful to you, as I am sure does also my husband.\" So much\nshe said, and then felt angry with herself for saying so much. Was\nshe not expressing her strong hope that he might stand fast by her\nchild, whereby the whole Crawley family would gain so much,--and the\nGrantly family lose much, in the same proportion?\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"I owe you thanks, still unexpressed, in\nthat you came forward, together with Mr. Robarts of Framley, to\nsatisfy the not unnatural requisition of the magistrates before whom\nI was called upon to appear in the early winter. I know not why any\none should have ventured into such jeopardy on my account.\"\n\n\"There was no jeopardy, Mr. Crawley. Any one in the county would have\ndone it.\"\n\n\"I know not that; nor can I see that there was no jeopardy. I trust\nthat I may assure you that there is no danger;--none, I mean, to you.\nThe danger to myself and those belonging to me is, alas, very urgent.\nThe facts of my position are pressing close upon me. Methinks I\nsuffer more from the visit of the gentleman who has just departed\nfrom me than from anything that has yet happened to me. And yet he is\nin his right;--he is altogether in his right.\"\n\n\"No, papa; he is not,\" said Jane, from her standing ground near the\nupright desk.\n\n\"My dear,\" said her father, \"you should be silent on such a subject.\nIt is a matter hard to be understood in all its bearings,--even by\nthose who are most conversant with them. But as to this we need not\ntrouble Major Grantly.\"\n\nAfter that there was silence among them, and for a while it seemed as\nthough there could be no approach to the subject on which Grantly had\ncome thither to express himself. Mrs. Crawley, in her despair, said\nsomething about the weather; and the major, trying to draw near the\nspecial subject, became bold enough to remark \"that he had had the\npleasure of seeing Miss Crawley at Framley.\" \"Mrs. Robarts has been\nvery kind,\" said Mrs. Crawley, \"very kind indeed. You can understand,\nMajor Grantly, that this must be a very sad house for any young\nperson.\" \"I don't think it is at all sad,\" said Jane, still standing\nin the corner by the upright desk.\n\nThen Major Grantly rose from his seat and walked across to the girl\nand took her hand. \"You are so like your sister,\" said he. \"Your\nsister is a great friend of mine. She has often spoken to me of you.\nI hope we shall be friends some day.\" But Jane could make no answer\nto this, though she had been able to vindicate the general character\nof the house while she was left in her corner by herself. \"I wonder\nwhether you would be angry with me,\" continued the major, \"if I told\nyou that I wanted to speak a word to your father and mother alone?\"\nTo this Jane made no reply, but was out of the room almost before\nthe words had reached the ears of her father and mother. Though\nshe was only sixteen, and had as yet read nothing but Latin and\nGreek,--unless we are to count the twelve books of Euclid and Wood's\nAlgebra, and sundry smaller exercises of the same description,--she\nunderstood, as well as any one then present, the reason why her\nabsence was required.\n\nAs she closed the door the major paused for a moment, expecting, or\nperhaps hoping, that the father or the mother would say a word. But\nneither of them had a word to say. They sat silent, and as though\nconscience-stricken. Here was a rich man come, of whom they had heard\nthat he might probably wish to wed their daughter. It was manifest\nenough to both of them that no man could marry into their family\nwithout subjecting himself to a heavy portion of that reproach and\ndisgrace which was attached to them. But how was it possible that\nthey should not care more for their daughter,--for their own flesh\nand blood, than for the incidental welfare of this rich man? As\nregarded the man himself they had heard everything that was good.\nSuch a marriage was like the opening of paradise to their child. \"Nil\nconscire sibi,\" said the father to himself, as he buckled on his\narmour for the fight.\n\nWhen he had waited for a moment or two the major began. \"Mrs.\nCrawley,\" he said, addressing himself to the mother, \"I do not quite\nknow how far you may be aware that I,--that I have for some time\nbeen,--been acquainted with your eldest daughter.\"\n\n\"I have heard from her that she is acquainted with you,\" said Mrs.\nCrawley, almost panting with anxiety.\n\n\"I may as well make a clean breast of it at once,\" said the major,\nsmiling, \"and say outright that I have come here to request your\npermission and her father's to ask her to be my wife.\" Then he was\nsilent, and for a few moments neither Mr. nor Mrs. Crawley replied\nto him. She looked at her husband, and he gazed at the fire, and the\nsmile died away from the major's face, as he watched the solemnity\nof them both. There was something almost forbidding in the peculiar\ngravity of Mr. Crawley's countenance when, as at present, something\noperated within him to cause him to express dissent from any\nproposition that was made to him. \"I do not know how far this may be\naltogether new to you, Mrs. Crawley,\" said the major, waiting for a\nreply.\n\n\"It is not new to us,\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\n\"May I hope, then, that you will not disapprove?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"I am so placed by the untoward\ncircumstances of my life that I can hardly claim to exercise over my\nown daughter that authority which should belong to a parent.\"\n\n\"My dear, do not say that,\" exclaimed Mrs. Crawley.\n\n\"But I do say it. Within three weeks of this time I may be a\nprisoner, subject to the criminal laws of my country. At this moment\nI am without the power of earning bread for myself, or for my wife,\nor for my children. Major Grantly, you have even now seen the\ndeparture of the gentleman who has been sent here to take my place in\nthis parish. I am, as it were, an outlaw here, and entitled neither\nto obedience nor respect from those who under other circumstances\nwould be bound to give me both.\"\n\n\"Major Grantly,\" said the poor woman, \"no husband or father in the\ncounty is more closely obeyed or more thoroughly respected and\nloved.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it,\" said the major.\n\n\"All this, however, matters nothing,\" continued Mr. Crawley, \"and all\nspeech on such homely matters would amount to an impertinence before\nyou, sir, were it not that you have hinted at a purpose of connecting\nyourself at some future time with this unfortunate family.\"\n\n\"I meant to be plain-spoken, Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"I did not mean to insinuate, sir, that there was aught of reticence\nin your words, so contrived that you might fall back upon the\nvagueness of your expression for protection, should you hereafter see\nfit to change your purpose. I should have wronged you much by such a\nsuggestion. I rather was minded to make known to you that I,--or, I\nshould rather say, we,\" and Mr. Crawley pointed to his wife,--\"shall\nnot accept your plainness of speech as betokening aught beyond a\nconceived idea in furtherance of which you have thought it expedient\nto make certain inquiries.\"\n\n\"I don't quite follow you,\" said the major. \"But what I want you to\ndo is to give me your consent to visit your daughter; and I want Mrs.\nCrawley to write to Grace and tell her that it's all right.\" Mrs.\nCrawley was quite sure that it was all right, and was ready to sit\ndown and write the letter that moment, if her husband would permit\nher to do so.\n\n\"I am sorry that I have not been explicit,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"but I\nwill endeavour to make myself more plainly intelligible. My daughter,\nsir, is so circumstanced in reference to her father, that I, as her\nfather and as a gentleman, cannot encourage any man to make a tender\nto her of his hand.\"\n\n\"But I have made up my mind about all that.\"\n\n\"And I, sir, have made up mine. I dare not tell my girl that I think\nshe will do well to place her hand in yours. A lady, when she does\nthat, should feel at least that her hand is clean.\"\n\n\"It is the cleanest and the sweetest and the fairest hand in\nBarsetshire,\" said the major. Mrs. Crawley could not restrain\nherself, but running up to him, took his hand in hers and kissed it.\n\n\"There is unfortunately a stain, which is vicarial,\" began\nMr. Crawley, sustaining up to that point his voice with Roman\nfortitude,--with a fortitude which would have been Roman had it not\nat that moment broken down under the pressure of human feeling. He\ncould keep it up no longer, but continued his speech with broken\nsobs, and with a voice altogether changed in its tone,--rapid now,\nwhereas it had before been slow,--natural, whereas it had hitherto\nbeen affected,--human, whereas it had hitherto been Roman. \"Major\nGrantly,\" he said, \"I am sore beset; but what can I say to you? My\ndarling is as pure as the light of day,--only that she is soiled with\nmy impurity. She is fit to grace the house of the best gentleman in\nEngland, had I not made her unfit.\"\n\n\"She shall grace mine,\" said the major. \"By God, she\nshall!--to-morrow, if she'll have me.\" Mrs. Crawley, who was standing\nbeside him, again raised his hand and kissed it.\n\n\"It may not be so. As I began by saying,--or rather strove to say,\nfor I have been overtaken by weakness, and cannot speak my mind,--I\ncannot claim authority over my child as would another man. How can I\nexercise authority from between a prison's bars?\"\n\n\"She would obey your slightest wish,\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\n\"I could express no wish,\" said he. \"But I know my girl, and I am\nsure that she will not consent to take infamy with her into the house\nof the man who loves her.\"\n\n\"There will be no infamy,\" said the major. \"Infamy! I tell you that\nI shall be proud of the connexion.\"\n\n\"You, sir, are generous in your prosperity. We will strive to be\nat least just in our adversity. My wife and children are to be\npitied,--because of the husband and the father.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Mrs. Crawley. \"I will not hear that said without denying\nit.\"\n\n\"But they must take their lot as it has been given to them,\"\ncontinued he. \"Such a position in life as that which you have\nproposed to bestow upon my child would be to her, as regards\nhuman affairs, great elevation. And from what I have heard,--I\nmay be permitted to add also from what I now learn by personal\nexperience,--such a marriage would be laden with fair promise of\nfuture happiness. But if you ask my mind, I think that my child is\nnot free to make it. You, sir, have many relatives, who are not in\nlove, as you are, all of whom would be affected by the stain of my\ndisgrace. You have a daughter, to whom all your solicitude is due.\nNo one should go to your house as your second wife who cannot feel\nthat she will serve your child. My daughter would feel that she was\nbringing an injury upon the babe. I cannot bid her do this,--and I\nwill not. Nor do I believe that she would do so if I bade her.\" Then\nhe turned his chair round, and sat with his face to the wall, wiping\naway the tears with a tattered handkerchief.\n\nMrs. Crawley led the major away to the further window, and there\nstood looking up into his face. It need hardly be said that they also\nwere crying. Whose eyes could have been dry after such a scene,--upon\nhearing such words? \"You had better go,\" said Mrs. Crawley. \"I know\nhim so well. You had better go.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Crawley,\" he said, whispering to her, \"if I ever desert her,\nmay all that I love desert me! But you will help me?\"\n\n\"You would want no help, were it not for this trouble.\"\n\n\"But you will help me?\"\n\nThen she paused a moment. \"I can do nothing,\" she said, \"but what he\nbids me.\"\n\n\"You will trust me, at any rate?\" said the major.\n\n\"I do trust you,\" she replied. Then he went without saying a word\nfurther to Mr. Crawley. As soon as he was gone, the wife went over to\nher husband, and put her arm gently round his neck as he was sitting.\nFor a while the husband took no notice of his wife's caress, but sat\nmotionless, with his face still turned to the wall. Then she spoke\nto him a word or two, telling him that their visitor was gone. \"My\nchild!\" he said. \"My poor child! my darling! She has found grace in\nthis man's sight; but even of that has her father robbed her! The\nLord has visited upon the children the sins of the father, and will\ndo so to the third and fourth generation.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV.\n\nTHE TRAGEDY IN HOOK COURT.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nConway Dalrymple had hurried out of the room in Mrs. Broughton's\nhouse in which he had been painting Jael and Sisera, thinking that\nit would be better to meet an angry and perhaps tipsy husband on\nthe stairs, than it would be either to wait for him till he should\nmake his way into his wife's room, or to hide away from him with\nthe view of escaping altogether from so disagreeable an encounter.\nHe had no fear of the man. He did not think that there would be any\nviolence,--nor, as regarded himself, did he much care if there was\nto be violence. But he felt that he was bound, as far as it might\nbe possible, to screen the poor woman from the ill effects of her\nhusband's temper and condition. He was, therefore, prepared to stop\nBroughton on the stairs, and to use some force in arresting him on\nhis way, should he find the man to be really intoxicated. But he\nhad not descended above a stair or two before he was aware that\nthe man below him, whose step had been heard in the hall, was\nnot intoxicated, and that he was not Dobbs Broughton. It was Mr.\nMusselboro.\n\n\"It is you, is it?\" said Conway. \"I thought it was Broughton.\" Then\nhe looked into the man's face and saw that he was ashy pale. All that\nappearance of low-bred jauntiness which used to belong to him seemed\nto have been washed out of him. His hair had forgotten to curl,\nhis gloves had been thrown aside, and even his trinkets were out\nof sight. \"What has happened?\" said Conway. \"What is the matter?\nSomething is wrong.\" Then it occurred to him that Musselboro had been\nsent to the house to tell the wife of the husband's ruin.\n\n\"The servant told me that I should find you upstairs,\" said\nMusselboro.\n\n\"Yes; I have been painting here. For some time past I have been doing\na picture of Miss Van Siever. Mrs. Van Siever has been here to-day.\"\nConway thought that this information would produce some strong effect\non Clara's proposed husband; but he did not seem to regard the matter\nof the picture nor the mention of Miss Van Siever's name.\n\n\"She knows nothing of it?\" said he. \"She doesn't know yet?\"\n\n\"Know what?\" asked Conway. \"She knows that her husband has lost\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Dobbs has--destroyed himself.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"Blew his brains out this morning just inside the entrance at Hook\nCourt. The horror of drink was on him, and he stood just in the\npathway and shot himself. Bangles was standing at the top of their\nvaults and saw him do it. I don't think Bangles will ever be a man\nagain. O Lord! I shall never get over it myself. The body was there\nwhen I went in.\" Then Musselboro sank back against the wall of the\nstaircase, and stared at Dalrymple as though he still saw before him\nthe terrible sight of which he had just spoken.\n\nDalrymple seated himself on the stairs and strove to bring his mind\nto bear on the tale which he had just heard. What was he to do, and\nhow was that poor woman upstairs to be informed? \"You came here\nintending to tell her,\" he said, in a whisper. He feared every moment\nthat Mrs. Broughton would appear on the stairs, and learn from a word\nor two what had happened without any hint to prepare her for the\ncatastrophe.\n\n\"I thought you would be here. I knew you were doing the picture. He\nknew it. He'd had a letter to say so,--one of those anonymous ones.\"\n\n\"But that didn't influence him?\"\n\n\"I don't think it was that,\" said Musselboro. \"He meant to have had\nit out with her; but it wasn't that as brought this about. Perhaps\nyou didn't know that he was clean ruined?\"\n\n\"She had told me.\"\n\n\"Then she knew it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; she knew that. Mrs. Van Siever had told her. Poor creature!\nHow are we to break this to her?\"\n\n\"You and she are very thick,\" said Musselboro. \"I suppose you'll do\nit best.\" By this time they were in the drawing-room, and the door\nwas closed. Dalrymple had put his hand on the other man's arm, and\nhad led him downstairs, out of reach of hearing from the room above.\n\"You'll tell her,--won't you?\" said Musselboro. Then Dalrymple tried\nto think what loving female friend there was who could break the news\nto the unfortunate woman. He knew of the Van Sievers, and he knew\nof the Demolines, and he almost knew that there was no other woman\nwithin reach whom he was entitled to regard as closely connected with\nMrs. Broughton. He was well aware that the anonymous letter of which\nMusselboro had just spoken had come from Miss Demolines, and he could\nnot go there for sympathy and assistance. Nor could he apply to Mrs.\nVan Siever after what had passed this morning. To Clara Van Siever\nhe would have applied, but that it was impossible he should reach\nClara except through her mother. \"I suppose I had better go to her,\"\nhe said, after a while. And then he went, leaving Musselboro in the\ndrawing-room. \"I'm so bad with it,\" said Musselboro, \"that I really\ndon't know how I shall ever go up that court again.\"\n\nConway Dalrymple made his way up the stairs with very slow steps,\nand as he did so he could not but think seriously of the nature of\nhis friendship with this woman, and could not but condemn himself\nheartily for the folly and iniquity of his own conduct. Scores of\ntimes he had professed his love to her with half-expressed words,\nintended to mean nothing, as he said to himself when he tried to\nexcuse himself, but enough to turn her head, even if they did not\nreach her heart. Now, this woman was a widow, and it came to be his\nduty to tell her that she was so. What if she should claim from\nhim now the love which he had so often proffered to her! It was\nnot that he feared that she would claim anything from him at this\nmoment,--neither now, nor to-morrow, nor the next day,--but the agony\nof the present meeting would produce others in which there would be\nsome tenderness mixed with the agony; and so from one meeting to\nanother the thing would progress. Dalrymple knew well enough how such\nthings might progress. But in this danger before him, it was not of\nhimself that he was thinking, but of her. How could he assist her at\nsuch a time without doing her more injury than benefit? And, if he\ndid not assist her, who would do so? He knew her to be heartless; but\neven heartless people have hearts which can be touched and almost\nbroken by certain sorrows. Her heart would not be broken by her\nhusband's death, but it would become very sore if she were utterly\nneglected. He was now at the door, with his hand on the lock, and was\nwondering why she should remain so long within without making herself\nheard. Then he opened it, and found her seated in a lounging-chair,\nwith her back to the door, and he could see that she had a volume of\na novel in her hand. He understood it all. She was pretending to be\nindifferent to her husband's return. He walked up to her, thinking\nthat she would recognize his step; but she made no sign of turning\ntowards him. He saw the motion of her hair over the back of the chair\nas she affected to make herself luxuriously comfortable. She was\nstriving to let her husband see that she cared nothing for him, or\nfor his condition, or for his jealousy, if he were jealous,--or even\nfor his ruin. \"Mrs. Broughton,\" he said, when he was close to her.\nThen she jumped up quickly, and turned round, facing him. \"Where is\nDobbs?\" she said. \"Where is Broughton?\"\n\n\"He is not here.\"\n\n\"He is in the house, for I heard him. Why have you come back?\"\n\nDalrymple's eye fell on the tattered canvas, and he thought of the\ndoings of the past month. He thought of the picture of three Graces,\nwhich was hanging in the room below, and he thoroughly wished that he\nhad never been introduced to the Broughton establishment. How was he\nto get through his present difficulty? \"No,\" said he, \"Broughton did\nnot come. It was Mr. Musselboro whose steps you heard below.\"\n\n\"What is he here for? What is he doing here? Where is Dobbs? Conway,\nthere is something the matter. He has gone off!\"\n\n\"Yes;--he has gone off.\"\n\n\"The coward!\"\n\n\"No; he was not a coward;--not in that way.\"\n\nThe use of the past tense, unintentional as it had been, told the\nstory to the woman at once. \"He is dead,\" she said. Then he took both\nher hands in his and looked into her face without speaking a word.\nAnd she gazed at him with fixed eyes, and rigid mouth, while the\nquick coming breath just moved the curl of her nostrils. It occurred\nto him at the moment that he had never before seen her so wholly\nunaffected, and had never before observed that she was so totally\ndeficient in all the elements of real beauty. She was the first to\nspeak again. \"Conway,\" she said, \"tell it me all. Why do you not\nspeak to me?\"\n\n\"There is nothing further to tell,\" said he.\n\nThen she dropped his hands and walked away from him to the\nwindow,--and stood there looking out upon the stuccoed turret of\na huge house that stood opposite. As she did so she was employing\nherself in counting the windows. Her mind was paralysed by the blow,\nand she knew not how to make any exertion with it for any purpose.\nEverything was changed with her,--and was changed in such a way\nthat she could make no guess as to her future mode of life. She was\nsuddenly a widow, a pauper, and utterly desolate,--while the only\nperson in the whole world that she really liked was standing close to\nher. But in the midst of it all she counted the windows of the house\nopposite. Had it been possible for her she would have put her mind\naltogether to sleep.\n\nHe let her stand for a few minutes and then joined her at the window.\n\"My friend,\" he said, \"what shall I do for you?\"\n\n\"Do?\" she said. \"What do you mean by--doing?\"\n\n\"Come and sit down and let me talk to you,\" he replied. Then he led\nher to the sofa, and as she seated herself I doubt whether she had\nnot almost forgotten that her husband was dead.\n\n\"What a pity it was to cut it up,\" she said, pointing to the rags of\nJael and Sisera.\n\n\"Never mind the picture now. Dreadful as it is, you must allow\nyourself to think of him for a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Think of what! O God! yes. Conway, you must tell me what to do. Was\neverything gone? It isn't about myself. I don't mind about myself. I\nwish it was me instead of him. I do. I do.\"\n\n\"No wishing is of any avail.\"\n\n\"But, Conway, how did it happen? Do you think it is true? That man\nwould say anything to gain his object. Is he here now?\"\n\n\"I believe he is here still.\"\n\n\"I won't see him. Remember that. Nothing on earth shall make me see\nhim.\"\n\n\"It may be necessary, but I do not think it will be;--at any rate not\nyet.\"\n\n\"I will never see him. I believe that he has murdered my husband. I\ndo. I feel sure of it. Now I think of it I am quite sure of it. And\nhe will murder you too;--about that girl. He will. I tell you I know\nthe man.\" Dalrymple simply shook his head, smiling sadly. \"Very well!\nyou will see. But, Conway, how do you know that it is true? Do you\nbelieve it yourself?\"\n\n\"I do believe it.\"\n\n\"And how did it happen?\"\n\n\"He could not bear the ruin that he had brought upon himself and\nyou.\"\n\n\"Then;--then--\" She went no further in her speech; but Dalrymple\nassented by a slight motion of his head, and she had been informed\nsufficiently that her husband had perished by his own hand. \"What am\nI to do?\" she said. \"Oh, Conway;--you must tell me. Was there ever so\nmiserable a woman! Was it--poison?\"\n\nHe got up and walked quickly across the room and back again to the\nplace where she was sitting. \"Never mind about that now. You shall\nknow all that in time. Do not ask any questions about that. If I were\nyou I think I would go to bed. You will be better there than up, and\nthis shock will make you sleep.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I will not go to bed. How should I know that that\nman would not come to me and kill me? I believe he murdered Dobbs;--I\ndo. You are not going to leave me, Conway?\"\n\n\"I think I had better, for a while. There are things which should be\ndone. Shall I send one of the women to you?\"\n\n\"There is not one of them that cares for me in the least. Oh, Conway,\ndo not go; not yet. I will not be left alone in the house with him.\nYou will be very cruel if you go and leave me now,--when you have so\noften said that you,--that you,--that you were my friend.\" And now,\nat last, she began to weep.\n\n\"I think it will be best,\" he said, \"that I should go to Mrs. Van\nSiever. If I can manage it I will get Clara to come to you.\"\n\n\"I do not want her,\" said Mrs. Broughton. \"She is a heartless cold\ncreature, and I do not want to have her near me. My poor husband was\nruined among them;--yes, ruined among them. It has all been done that\nshe may marry that horrid man and live here in this house. I have\nknown ever so long that he has not been safe among them.\"\n\n\"You need fear nothing from Clara,\" said Dalrymple, with some touch\nof anger in his voice.\n\n\"Of course you will say so. I can understand that very well. And it\nis natural that you should wish to be with her. Pray go.\"\n\nThen he sat beside her, and took her hand, and endeavoured to speak\nto her so seriously, that she herself might become serious, and if\nit might be possible, in some degree contemplative. He told her how\nnecessary it was that she should have some woman near her in her\ntrouble, and explained to her that as far as he knew her female\nfriends, there would be no one who would be so considerate with her\nas Clara Van Siever. She at one time mentioned the name of Miss\nDemolines; but Dalrymple altogether opposed the notion of sending for\nthat lady,--expressing his opinion that the amiable Madalina had done\nall in her power to create quarrels both between Mrs. Broughton and\nher husband and between Dobbs Broughton and Mrs. Van Siever. And he\nspoke his opinion very fully about Miss Demolines. \"And yet you liked\nher once,\" said Mrs. Broughton. \"I never liked her,\" said Dalrymple\nwith energy. \"But all that matters nothing now. Of course you can\nsend for her if you please; but I do not think her trustworthy, and\nI will not willingly come in contact with her.\" Then Mrs. Broughton\ngave him to understand that of course she must give way, but that in\ngiving way she felt herself to be submitting to that ill-usage which\nis the ordinary lot of women, and to which she, among women, had been\nspecially subjected. She did not exactly say as much, fearing that if\nshe did he would leave her altogether; but that was the gist of her\nplaints and wails, and final acquiescence.\n\n\"And you are going?\" she said, catching hold of his arm.\n\n\"I will employ myself altogether and only about your affairs, till I\nsee you again.\"\n\n\"But I want you to stay.\"\n\n\"It would be madness. Look here;--lie down till Clara comes or till I\nreturn. Do not go beyond this room and your own. If she cannot come\nthis evening I will return. Good-by now. I will see the servants as I\ngo out, and tell them what ought to be told.\"\n\n\"Oh, Conway,\" she said, clutching hold of him again, \"I know that you\ndespise me.\"\n\n\"I do not despise you, and I will be as good a friend to you as I\ncan. God bless you.\" Then he went, and as he descended the stairs he\ncould not refrain from telling himself that he did in truth despise\nher.\n\nHis first object was to find Musselboro, and to dismiss that\ngentleman from the house. For though he himself did not attribute\nto Mrs. Van Siever's favourite any of those terrible crimes and\npotentialities for crime, with which Mrs. Dobbs Broughton had\ninvested him, still he thought it reasonable that the poor woman\nupstairs should not be subjected to the necessity of either seeing\nhim or hearing him. But Musselboro had gone, and Dalrymple could not\nlearn from the head woman-servant whom he saw, whether before going\nhe had told to any one in the house the tale of the catastrophe which\nhad happened in the City. Servants are wonderful actors, looking\noften as though they knew nothing when they know everything,--as\nthough they understood nothing, when they understand all. Dalrymple\nmade known all that was necessary, and the discreet upper servant\nlistened to the tale with a proper amount of awe and horror and\ncommiseration. \"Shot hisself in the City;--laws! You'll excuse me,\nsir, but we all know'd as master was coming to no good.\" But she\npromised to do her best with her mistress,--and kept her promise. It\nis seldom that servants are not good in such straits as that.\n\nFrom Mrs. Broughton's house Dalrymple went directly to Mrs. Van\nSiever's, and learned that Musselboro had been there about half an\nhour before, and had then gone off in a cab with Mrs. Van Siever. It\nwas now nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, and no one in the house\nknew when Mrs. Van Siever would be back. Miss Van Siever was out,\nand had been out when Mr. Musselboro had called, but was expected\nin every minute. Conway therefore said that he would call again, and\non returning found Clara alone. She had not then heard a word of\nthe fate of Dobbs Broughton. Of course she would go at once to Mrs.\nBroughton, and if necessary stay with her during the night. She wrote\na line at once to her mother, saying where she was, and went across\nto Mrs. Broughton leaning on Dalrymple's arm. \"Be good to her,\" said\nConway, as he left her at the door. \"I will,\" said Clara. \"I will be\nas kind as my nature will allow me.\" \"And remember,\" said Conway,\nwhispering into her ear as he pressed her hand at leaving her, \"that\nyou are all the world to me.\" It was perhaps not a proper time for an\nexpression of love, but Clara Van Siever forgave the impropriety.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV.\n\nMISS VAN SIEVER MAKES HER CHOICE.\n\n\nClara Van Siever did stay all that night with Mrs. Broughton. In the\ncourse of the evening she received a note from her mother, in which\nshe was told to come home to breakfast. \"You can go back to her\nafterwards,\" said Mrs. Van Siever; \"and I will see her myself in the\ncourse of the day, if she will let me.\" The note was written on a\nscrap of paper, and had neither beginning nor end; but this was after\nthe manner of Mrs. Van Siever, and Clara was not in the least hurt\nor surprised. \"My mother will come to see you after breakfast,\" said\nClara, as she was taking her leave.\n\n\"Oh, goodness! And what shall I say to her?\"\n\n\"You will have to say very little. She will speak to you.\"\n\n\"I suppose everything belongs to her now,\" said Mrs. Broughton.\n\n\"I know nothing about that. I never do know anything of mamma's money\nmatters.\"\n\n\"Of course she'll turn me out. I do not mind a bit about that,--only\nI hope she'll let me have some mourning.\" Then she made Clara promise\nthat she would return as soon as possible, having in Clara's presence\novercome all that feeling of dislike which she had expressed to\nConway Dalrymple. Mrs. Broughton was generally affectionate to\nthose who were near to her. Had Musselboro forced himself into her\npresence, she would have become quite confidential with him before he\nleft her.\n\n\"Mr. Musselboro will be here directly,\" said Mrs. Van Siever, as she\nwas starting for Mrs. Broughton's house. \"You had better tell him to\ncome to me there; or, stop,--perhaps you had better keep him here\ntill I come back. Tell him to be sure and wait for me.\"\n\n\"Very well, mamma. I suppose he can wait below?\"\n\n\"Why should he wait below?\" said Mrs. Van Siever, very angrily.\n\nClara had made the uncourteous proposition to her mother with the\nexpress intention of making it understood that she would have nothing\nto say to him. \"He can come upstairs if he likes it,\" said Clara;\n\"and I will go up to my room.\"\n\n\"If you fight shy of him, miss, you may remember this,--that you will\nfight shy of me at the same time.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for that, mamma, for I shall certainly fight shy of Mr.\nMusselboro.\"\n\n\"You can do as you please. I can't force you, and I shan't try. But\nI can make your life a burden to you,--and I will. What's the matter\nwith the man that he isn't good enough for you? He's as good as any\nof your own people ever was. I hate your new-fangled airs,--with\npictures painted on the sly, and all the rest of it. I hate such\nways. See what they have brought that wretched man to, and the poor\nfool his wife. If you go and marry that painter, some of these days\nyou'll be very much like what she is. Only I doubt whether he has got\ncourage enough to blow his brains out.\" With these comfortable words,\nthe old woman took herself off, leaving Clara to entertain her lover\nas best she might choose.\n\nMr. Musselboro was not long in coming, and, in accordance with Mrs.\nVan Siever's implied directions to her daughter, was shown up into\nthe drawing-room. Clara gave him her mother's message in a very few\nwords. \"I was expressly told, sir, to ask you to stop, if it is not\ninconvenient, as she very much wants to see you.\" Mr. Musselboro\ndeclared that of course he would stop. He was only too happy to have\nan opportunity of remaining in such delightful society. As Clara\nanswered nothing to this, he went on to say that he hoped that the\nmelancholy occasion of Mrs. Van Siever's visit to Mrs. Broughton\nmight make a long absence necessary,--he did not, indeed, care how\nlong it might be. He had recovered now from that paleness, and that\nwant of gloves and jewellery which had befallen him on the previous\nday immediately after the sight he had seen in the City. Clara made\nno answer to the last speech, but, putting some things together in\nher work-basket, prepared to leave the room. \"I hope you are not\ngoing to leave me?\" he said, in a voice that was intended to convey\nmuch of love, and something of melancholy.\n\n\"I am so shocked by what has happened, Mr. Musselboro, that I am\naltogether unfit for conversation. I was with poor Mrs. Broughton\nlast night, and I shall return to her when mamma comes home.\"\n\n\"It is sad, certainly; but what was there to be expected? If you'd\nonly seen how he used to go on.\" To this Clara made no answer. \"Don't\ngo yet,\" said he; \"there is something that I want to say to you.\nThere is, indeed.\"\n\nClara Van Siever was a young woman whose presence of mind rarely\ndeserted her. It occurred to her now that she must undergo on some\noccasion the nuisance of a direct offer from this man, and that she\ncould have no better opportunity of answering him after her own\nfashion than the present. Her mother was absent, and the field was\nher own. And, moreover, it was a point in her favour that the tragedy\nwhich had so lately occurred, and to which she had just now alluded,\nwould give her a fair excuse for additional severity. At such a\nmoment no man could, she told herself, be justified in making an\noffer of his love, and therefore she might rebuke him with the less\nremorse. I wonder whether the last words which Conway Dalrymple had\nspoken to her stung her conscience as she thought of this! She had\nnow reached the door, and was standing close to it. As Mr. Musselboro\ndid not at once begin, she encouraged him. \"If you have anything\nspecial to tell me, of course I will hear you,\" she said.\n\n\"Miss Clara,\" he began, rising from his chair, and coming into the\nmiddle of the room, \"I think you know what my wishes are.\" Then he\nput his hand upon his heart. \"And your respected mother is the same\nway of thinking. It's that that emboldens me to be so sudden. Not but\nwhat my heart has been yours and yours only all along, before the old\nlady so much as mentioned it.\" Clara would give him no assistance,\nnot even the aid of a negative, but stood there quite passive, with\nher hand on the door. \"Since I first had the pleasure of seeing you\nI have always said to myself, 'Augustus Musselboro, that is the woman\nfor you, if you can only win her.' But then there was so much against\nme,--wasn't there?\" She would not even take advantage of this by\nassuring him that there certainly always had been much against him,\nbut allowed him to go on till he should run out all the length of\nhis tether. \"I mean, of course, in the way of money,\" he continued.\n\"I hadn't much that I could call my own when your respected mamma\nfirst allowed me to become acquainted with you. But it's different\nnow; and I think I may say that I'm all right in that respect. Poor\nBroughton's going in this way will make it a deal smoother to me; and\nI may say that I and your mamma will be all in all to each other now\nabout money.\" Then he stopped.\n\n\"I don't quite understand what you mean by all this,\" said Clara.\n\n\"I mean that there isn't a more devoted fellow in all London than\nwhat I am to you.\" Then he was about to go down on one knee, but it\noccurred to him that it would not be convenient to kneel to a lady\nwho would stand quite close to the door. \"One and one, if they're put\ntogether well, will often make more than two, and so they shall with\nus,\" said Musselboro, who began to feel that it might be expedient to\nthrow a little spirit into his words.\n\n\"If you have done,\" said Clara, \"you may as well hear me for a\nminute. And I hope you will have sense to understand that I really\nmean what I say.\"\n\n\"I hope you will remember what are your mamma's wishes.\"\n\n\"Mamma's wishes have no influence whatsoever with me in such matters\nas this. Mamma's arrangements with you are for her own convenience,\nand I am not a party to them. I do not know anything about mamma's\nmoney, and I do not want to know. But under no possible circumstances\nwill I consent to become your wife. Nothing that mamma could say or\ndo would induce me even to think of it. I hope you will be man enough\nto take this for an answer, and say nothing more about it.\"\n\n\"But, Miss Clara--\"\n\n\"It's no good your Miss Claraing me, sir. What I have said you may be\nsure I mean. Good-morning, sir.\" Then she opened the door, and left\nhim.\n\n\"By Jove, she is a Tartar,\" said Musselboro to himself, when he was\nalone. \"They're both Tartars, but the younger is the worse.\" Then he\nbegan to speculate whether Fortune was not doing the best for him in\nso arranging that he might have the use of the Tartar-mother's money\nwithout binding himself to endure for life the Tartar qualities of\nthe daughter.\n\nIt had been understood that Clara was to wait at home till her mother\nshould return before she again went across to Mrs. Broughton. At\nabout eleven Mrs. Van Siever came in, and her daughter intercepted\nher at the dining-room door before she had made her way upstairs to\nMr. Musselboro. \"How is she, mamma?\" said Clara with something of\nhypocrisy in her assumed interest for Mrs. Broughton.\n\n\"She is an idiot,\" said Mrs. Van Siever.\n\n\"She has had a terrible misfortune!\"\n\n\"That is no reason why she should be an idiot; and she is heartless\ntoo. She never cared a bit for him;--not a bit.\"\n\n\"He was a man whom it was impossible to care for much. I will go to\nher now, mamma.\"\n\n\"Where is Musselboro?\"\n\n\"He is upstairs.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Mamma, that is quite out of the question. Quite. I would not marry\nhim to save myself from starving.\"\n\n\"You do not know what starving is yet, my dear. Tell me the truth at\nonce. Are you engaged to that painter?\" Clara paused a moment before\nshe answered, not hesitating as to the expediency of telling her\nmother any truth on the matter in question, but doubting what the\ntruth might really be. Could she say that she was engaged to Mr.\nDalrymple, or could she say that she was not? \"If you tell me a lie,\nmiss, I'll have you put out of the house.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"You do not know what starving is, my dear.\"]\n\n\"I certainly shall not tell you a lie. Mr. Dalrymple has asked me to\nbe his wife, and I have made him no answer. If he asks me again I\nshall accept him.\"\n\n\"Then I order you not to leave this house,\" said Mrs. Van Siever.\n\n\"Surely I may go to Mrs. Broughton?\"\n\n\"I order you not to leave this house,\" said Mrs. Van Siever\nagain,--and thereupon she stalked out of the dining-room and went\nupstairs. Clara had been standing with her bonnet on, ready dressed\nto go out, and the mother made no attempt to send the daughter up to\nher room. That she did not expect to be obeyed in her order may be\ninferred from the first words which she spoke to Mr. Musselboro. \"She\nhas gone off to that man now. You are no good, Musselboro, at this\nkind of work.\"\n\n\"You see, Mrs. Van, he had the start of me so much. And then being at\nthe West End, and all that, gives a man such a standing with a girl!\"\n\n\"Bother!\" said Mrs. Van Siever, as her quick ear caught the sound of\nthe closing hall-door. Clara had stood a minute or two to consider,\nand then had resolved that she would disobey her mother. She tried to\nexcuse her own conduct to her own satisfaction as she went. \"There\nare some things,\" she said, \"which even a daughter cannot hear from\nher mother. If she chooses to close the door against me, she must do\nso.\"\n\nShe found Mrs. Broughton still in bed, and could not but agree with\nher mother that the woman was both silly and heartless.\n\n\"Your mother says that everything must be sold up,\" said Mrs.\nBroughton.\n\n\"At any rate you would hardly choose to remain here,\" said Clara.\n\n\"But I hope she'll let me have my own things. A great many of them\nare altogether my own. I know there's a law that a woman may have her\nown things, even though her husband has,--done what poor Dobbs did.\nAnd I think she was hard upon me about the mourning. They never do\nmind giving credit for such things as that, and though there is a\nbill due to Mrs. Morell now, she has had a deal of Dobbs's money.\"\nClara promised her that she should have mourning to her heart's\ncontent. \"I will see to that myself,\" she said.\n\nPresently there was a knock at the door, and the discreet\nhead-servant beckoned Clara out of the room. \"You are not going\naway,\" said Mrs. Broughton. Clara promised her that she would not\ngo without coming back again. \"He will be here soon, I suppose, and\nperhaps you had better see him; though, for the matter of that,\nperhaps you had better not, because he is so much cut up about poor\nDobbs.\" The servant had come up to tell Clara that the \"he\" in\nquestion was at the present moment waiting for her below stairs.\n\nThe first words which passed between Dalrymple and Clara had\nreference to the widow. He told her what he had learned in the\nCity,--that Broughton's property had never been great, and that\nhis personal liabilities at the time of his death were supposed to\nbe small. But he had fallen lately altogether into the hands of\nMusselboro, who, though penniless himself in the way of capital,\nwas backed by the money of Mrs. Van Siever. There was no doubt that\nBroughton had destroyed himself in the manner told by Musselboro,\nbut the opinion in the City was that he had done so rather through\nthe effects of drink than because of his losses. As to the widow,\nDalrymple thought that Mrs. Van Siever, or nominally, perhaps,\nMusselboro, might be induced to settle an annuity on her, if she\nwould give up everything quietly. \"I doubt whether your mother is\nnot responsible for everything Broughton owed when he died,--for\neverything, that is, in the way of business; and if so, Mrs.\nBroughton will certainly have a claim upon the estate.\" It occurred\nto Dalrymple once or twice that he was talking to Clara about Mrs.\nVan Siever as though he and Clara were more closely bound together\nthan were Clara and her mother; but Clara seemed to take this in good\npart, and was as solicitous as was he himself in the matter of Mrs.\nBroughton's interest.\n\nThen the discreet head-servant knocked and told them that Mrs.\nBroughton was very anxious to see Mr. Dalrymple, but that Miss\nVan Siever was on no account to go away. She was up, and in her\ndressing-gown, and had gone into the sitting-room. \"I will come\ndirectly,\" said Dalrymple, and the discreet head-servant retired.\n\n\"Clara,\" said Conway, \"I do not know when I may have another chance\nof asking for an answer to my question. You heard my question?\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard it.\"\n\n\"And will you answer it?\"\n\n\"If you wish it, I will.\"\n\n\"Of course I wish it. You understood what I said upon the doorstep\nyesterday?\"\n\n\"I don't think much of that; men say those things so often. What you\nsaid before was serious, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Serious! Heavens! do you think that I am joking?\"\n\n\"Mamma wants me to marry Mr. Musselboro.\"\n\n\"He is a vulgar brute. It would be impossible.\"\n\n\"It is impossible; but mamma is very obstinate. I have no fortune of\nmy own,--not a shilling. She told me to-day that she would turn me\ninto the street. She forbade me to come here, thinking I should meet\nyou; but I came, because I had promised Mrs. Broughton. I am sure\nthat she will never give me one shilling.\"\n\nDalrymple paused for a moment. It was certainly true that he had\nregarded Clara Van Siever as an heiress, and had at first been\nattracted to her because he thought it expedient to marry an heiress.\nBut there had since come something beyond that, and there was perhaps\nless of regret than most men would have felt as he gave up his golden\nhopes. He took her into his arms and kissed her, and called her his\nown. \"Now we understand each other,\" he said.\n\n\"If you wish it to be so.\"\n\n\"I do wish it.\"\n\n\"And I shall tell my mother to-day that I am engaged to you,--unless\nshe refuses to see me. Go to Mrs. Broughton now. I feel that we are\nalmost cruel to be thinking of ourselves in this house at such a\ntime.\" Upon this Dalrymple went, and Clara Van Siever was left to\nher reflections. She had never before had a lover. She had never had\neven a friend whom she loved and trusted. Her life had been passed at\nschool till she was nearly twenty, and since then she had been vainly\nendeavouring to accommodate herself and her feelings to her mother.\nNow she was about to throw herself into the absolute power of a man\nwho was nearly a stranger to her! But she did love him, as she had\nnever loved any one else;--and then, on the other side, there was Mr.\nMusselboro!\n\nDalrymple was upstairs for an hour, and Clara did not see him again\nbefore he left the house. It was clear to her, from Mrs. Broughton's\nfirst words, that Conway had told her what had passed. \"Of course\nI shall never see anything more of either of you now?\" said Mrs.\nBroughton.\n\n\"I should say that probably you will see a great deal of us both.\"\n\n\"There are some people,\" said Mrs. Broughton, \"who can do well for\ntheir friends, but can never do well for themselves. I am one of\nthem. I saw at once how great a thing it would be for both of you to\nbring you two together,--especially for you, Clara; and therefore I\ndid it. I may say that I never had it out of my mind for months past.\nPoor Dobbs misunderstood what I was doing. God knows how far that may\nhave brought about what has happened.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Broughton!\"\n\n\"Of course he could not be blind to one thing;--nor was I. I mention\nit now because it is right, but I shall never, never allude to it\nagain. Of course he saw, and I saw, that Conway--was attached to\nme. Poor Conway meant no harm. I was aware of that. But there was\nthe terrible fact. I knew at once that the only cure for him was a\nmarriage with some girl that he could respect. Admiring you as I do,\nI immediately resolved on bringing you two together. My dear, I have\nbeen successful, and I heartily trust that you may be happier than\nMaria Broughton.\"\n\nMiss Van Siever knew the woman, understood all the facts, and pitying\nthe condition of the wretched creature, bore all this without a word\nof rebuke. She scorned to put out her strength against one who was in\ntruth so weak.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI.\n\nREQUIESCAT IN PACE.\n\n\nThings were very gloomy at the palace. It has been already said that\nfor many days after Dr. Tempest's visit to Barchester the intercourse\nbetween the bishop and Mrs. Proudie had not been of a pleasant\nnature. He had become so silent, so sullen, and so solitary in his\nways, that even her courage had been almost cowed, and for a while\nshe had condescended to use gentler measures, with the hope that\nshe might thus bring her lord round to his usual state of active\nsubmission; or perhaps, if we strive to do her full justice, we may\nsay of her that her effort was made conscientiously, with the idea of\ninducing him to do his duty with proper activity. For she was a woman\nnot without a conscience, and by no means indifferent to the real\nservice which her husband, as bishop of the diocese, was bound to\nrender to the affairs of the Church around her. Of her own struggles\nafter personal dominion she was herself unconscious; and no doubt\nthey gave her, when recognized and acknowledged by herself, many\nstabs to her inner self, of which no single being in the world knew\nanything. And now, as after a while she failed in producing any\namelioration in the bishop's mood, her temper also gave way, and\nthings were becoming very gloomy and very unpleasant.\n\nThe bishop and his wife were at present alone in the palace. Their\nmarried daughter and her husband had left them, and their unmarried\ndaughter was also away. How far the bishop's mood may have produced\nthis solitude in the vast house I will not say. Probably Mrs.\nProudie's state of mind may have prevented her from having other\nguests in the place of those who were gone. She felt herself to be\nalmost disgraced in the eyes of all those around her by her husband's\nlong absence from the common rooms of the house and by his dogged\nsilence at meals. It was better, she thought, that they two should be\nalone in the palace.\n\nHer own efforts to bring him back to something like life, to some\nactivity of mind if not of body, were made constantly; and when she\nfailed, as she did fail day after day, she would go slowly to her own\nroom, and lock her door, and look back in her solitude at all the\ndays of her life. She had agonies in these minutes of which no one\nnear her knew anything. She would seize with her arm the part of\nthe bed near which she would stand, and hold by it, grasping it, as\nthough she were afraid to fall; and then, when it was at the worst\nwith her, she would go to her closet,--a closet that no eyes ever saw\nunlocked but her own,--and fill for herself and swallow some draught;\nand then she would sit down with the Bible before her, and read it\nsedulously. She spent hours every day with her Bible before her,\nrepeating to herself whole chapters, which she almost knew by heart.\n\nIt cannot be said that she was a bad woman, though she had in her\ntime done an indescribable amount of evil. She had endeavoured to\ndo good, failing partly by ignorance and partly from the effects of\nan unbridled, ambitious temper. And now, even amidst her keenest\nsufferings, her ambition was by no means dead. She still longed to\nrule the diocese by means of her husband,--but was made to pause and\nhesitate by the unwonted mood that had fallen upon him. Before this,\non more than one occasion, and on one very memorable occasion, he\nhad endeavoured to combat her. He had fought with her, striving to\nput her down. He had failed, and given up the hope of any escape for\nhimself in that direction. On those occasions her courage had never\nquailed for a moment. While he openly struggled to be master, she\ncould openly struggle to be mistress,--and could enjoy the struggle.\nBut nothing like this moodiness had ever come upon him before.\n\nShe had yielded to it for many days, striving to coax him by little\nsoftnesses of which she herself had been ashamed as she practised\nthem. They had served her nothing, and at last she determined that\nsomething else must be done. If only for his sake, to keep some life\nin him, something else must be done. Were he to continue as he was\nnow, he must give up his diocese, or, at any rate, declare himself\ntoo ill to keep the working of it in his own hands. How she hated\nMr. Crawley for all the sorrow that he had brought upon her and her\nhouse!\n\nAnd it was still the affair of Mr. Crawley which urged her on to\nfurther action. When the bishop received Mr. Crawley's letter he said\nnothing of it to her; but he handed it over to his chaplain. The\nchaplain, fearing to act upon it himself, handed it to Mr. Thumble,\nwhom he knew to be one of the bishop's commission, and Mr. Thumble,\nequally fearing responsibility in the present state of affairs at the\npalace, found himself obliged to consult Mrs. Proudie. Mrs. Proudie\nhad no doubt as to what should be done. The man had abdicated his\nliving, and of course some provision must be made for the services.\nShe would again make an attempt upon her husband, and therefore she\nwent into his room holding Mr. Crawley's letter in her hand.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said, \"here is Mr. Crawley's letter. I suppose you\nhave read it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the bishop; \"I have read it.\"\n\n\"And what will you do about it? Something must be done.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said he. He did not even look at her as he spoke. He\nhad not turned his eyes upon her since she had entered the room.\n\n\"But, bishop, it is a letter that requires to be acted upon at once.\nWe cannot doubt that the man is doing right at last. He is submitting\nhimself where his submission is due; but his submission will be of no\navail unless you take some action upon his letter. Do you not think\nthat Mr. Thumble had better go over?\"\n\n\"No, I don't. I think Mr. Thumble had better stay where he is,\" said\nthe irritated bishop.\n\n\"What, then, would you wish to have done?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said he.\n\n\"But, bishop, that is nonsense,\" said Mrs. Proudie, adding something\nof severity to the tone of her voice.\n\n\"No, it isn't nonsense,\" said he. Still he did not look at her, nor\nhad he done so for a moment since she had entered the room. Mrs.\nProudie could not bear this, and as her anger became strong within\nher breast, she told herself that she would be wrong to bear it. She\nhad tried what gentleness would do, and she had failed. It was now\nimperatively necessary that she should resort to sterner measures.\nShe must make him understand that he must give her authority to send\nMr. Thumble to Hogglestock.\n\n\"Why do you not turn round and speak to me properly?\" she said.\n\n\"I do not want to speak to you at all,\" the bishop answered.\n\nThis was very bad;--almost anything would be better than this. He was\nsitting now over the fire, with his elbows on his knees, and his face\nburied in his hands. She had gone round the room so as to face him,\nand was now standing almost over him, but still she could not see his\ncountenance. \"This will not do at all,\" she said. \"My dear, do you\nknow that you are forgetting yourself altogether?\"\n\n\"I wish I could forget myself.\"\n\n\"That might be all very well if you were in a position in which you\nowed no service to any one; or, rather, it would not be well then,\nbut the evil would not be so manifest. You cannot do your duty in the\ndiocese if you continue to sit there doing nothing, with your head\nupon your hands. Why do you not rally, and get to your work like a\nman?\"\n\n\"I wish you would go away and leave me,\" he said.\n\n\"No, bishop, I will not go away and leave you. You have brought\nyourself to such a condition that it is my duty as your wife to stay\nby you; and if you neglect your duty, I will not neglect mine.\"\n\n\"It was you that brought me to it.\"\n\n\"No, sir, that is not true. I did not bring you to it.\"\n\n\"It is the truth.\" And now he got up and looked at her. For a moment\nhe stood upon his legs, and then again he sat down with his face\nturned towards her. \"It is the truth. You have brought on me such\ndisgrace that I cannot hold up my head. You have ruined me. I wish I\nwere dead; and it is all through you that I am driven to wish it.\"\n\nOf all that she had suffered in her life this was the worst. She\nclasped both her hands to her side as she listened to him, and for\na minute or two she made no reply. When he ceased from speaking he\nagain put his elbows on his knees and again buried his face in his\nhands. What had she better do, or how was it expedient that she\nshould treat him? At this crisis the whole thing was so important to\nher that she would have postponed her own ambition and would have\ncurbed her temper had she thought that by doing so she might in any\ndegree have benefited him. But it seemed to her that she could not\nrouse him by conciliation. Neither could she leave him as he was.\nSomething must be done. \"Bishop,\" she said, \"the words that you speak\nare sinful, very sinful.\"\n\n\"You have made them sinful,\" he replied.\n\n\"I will not hear that from you. I will not indeed. I have endeavoured\nto do my duty by you, and I do not deserve it. I am endeavouring to\ndo my duty now, and you must know that it would ill become me to\nremain quiescent while you are in such a state. The world around you\nis observing you, and knows that you are not doing your work. All I\nwant of you is that you should arouse yourself, and go to your work.\"\n\n\"I could do my work very well,\" he said, \"if you were not here.\"\n\n\"I suppose, then, you wish that I were dead?\" said Mrs. Proudie.\nTo this he made no reply, nor did he stir himself. How could flesh\nand blood bear this,--female flesh and blood,--Mrs. Proudie's flesh\nand blood? Now, at last, her temper once more got the better of her\njudgment, probably much to her immediate satisfaction, and she spoke\nout. \"I'll tell you what it is, my lord; if you are imbecile, I\nmust be active. It is very sad that I should have to assume your\nauthority--\"\n\n\"I will not allow you to assume my authority.\"\n\n\"I must do so, or must else obtain a medical certificate as to your\nincapacity, and beg that some neighbouring bishop may administer\nthe diocese. Things shall not go on as they are now. I, at any rate,\nwill do my duty. I shall tell Mr. Thumble that he must go over to\nHogglestock, and arrange for the duties of the parish.\"\n\n\"I desire that you will do no such thing,\" said the bishop, now again\nlooking up at her.\n\n\"You may be sure that I shall,\" said Mrs. Proudie, and then she left\nthe room.\n\nHe did not even yet suppose that she would go about this work at\nonce. The condition of his mind was in truth bad, and was becoming\nworse, probably, from day to day; but still he did make his\ncalculations about things, and now reflected that it would be\nsufficient if he spoke to his chaplain to-morrow about Mr. Crawley's\nletter. Since the terrible scene that Dr. Tempest had witnessed, he\nhad never been able to make up his mind as to what great step he\nwould take, but he had made up his mind that some great step was\nnecessary. There were moments in which he thought that he would\nresign his bishopric. For such resignation, without acknowledged\nincompetence on the score of infirmity, the precedents were very few;\nbut even if there were no precedents, it would be better to do that\nthan to remain where he was. Of course there would be disgrace. But\nthen it would be disgrace from which he could hide himself. Now there\nwas equal disgrace; and he could not hide himself. And then such a\nmeasure as that would bring punishment where punishment was due. It\nwould bring his wife to the ground,--her who had brought him to the\nground. The suffering should not be all his own. When she found that\nher income, and her palace, and her position were all gone, then\nperhaps she might repent the evil that she had done him. Now, when he\nwas left alone, his mind went back to this, and he did not think of\ntaking immediate measures,--measures on that very day,--to prevent\nthe action of Mr. Thumble.\n\nBut Mrs. Proudie did take immediate steps. Mr. Thumble was at this\nmoment in the palace waiting for instructions. It was he who had\nbrought Mr. Crawley's letter to Mrs. Proudie, and she now returned\nto him with that letter in her hand. The reader will know what was\nthe result. Mr. Thumble was sent off to Hogglestock at once on the\nbishop's old cob, and,--as will be remembered,--fell into trouble on\nthe road. Late in the afternoon he entered the palace yard, having\nled the cob by the bridle the whole way home from Hogglestock.\n\nSome hour or two before Mr. Thumble's return Mrs. Proudie returned to\nher husband, thinking it better to let him know what she had done.\nShe resolved to be very firm with him, but at the same time she\ndetermined not to use harsh language if it could be avoided. \"My\ndear,\" she said, \"I have arranged with Mr. Thumble.\" She found him\non this occasion sitting at his desk with papers before him, with\na pen in his hand; and she could see at a glance that nothing had\nbeen written on the paper. What would she have thought had she known\nthat when he placed the sheet before him he was proposing to consult\nthe archbishop as to the propriety of his resignation! He had not,\nhowever, progressed so far as to write even the date of his letter.\n\n\"You have done what?\" said he, throwing down the pen.\n\n\"I have arranged with Mr. Thumble as to going out to Hogglestock,\"\nsaid she firmly. \"Indeed he has gone already.\" Then the bishop jumped\nup from his seat, and rang the bell with violence. \"What are you\ngoing to do?\" said Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\"I am going to depart from here,\" said he. \"I will not stay here\nto be the mark of scorn for all men's fingers. I will resign the\ndiocese.\"\n\n\"You cannot do that,\" said his wife.\n\n\"I can try, at any rate,\" said he. Then the servant entered. \"John,\"\nsaid he, addressing the man, \"let Mr. Thumble know the moment he\nreturns to the palace that I wish to see him here. Perhaps he may not\ncome to the palace. In that case let word be sent to his house.\"\n\nMrs. Proudie allowed the man to go before she addressed her husband\nagain. \"What do you mean to say to Mr. Thumble when you see him?\"\n\n\"That is nothing to you.\"\n\nShe came up to him and put her hand upon his shoulder, and spoke to\nhim very gently. \"Tom,\" she said, \"is that the way in which you speak\nto your wife?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is. You have driven me to it. Why have you taken upon\nyourself to send that man to Hogglestock?\"\n\n\"Because it was right to do so. I came to you for instructions, and\nyou would give none.\"\n\n\"I should have given what instructions I pleased in proper time.\nThumble shall not go to Hogglestock next Sunday.\"\n\n\"Who shall go, then?\"\n\n\"Never mind. Nobody. It does not matter to you. If you will leave me\nnow I shall be obliged to you. There will be an end of all this very\nsoon,--very soon.\"\n\nMrs. Proudie after this stood for a while thinking what she would\nsay; but she left the room without uttering another word. As she\nlooked at him a hundred different thoughts came into her mind. She\nhad loved him dearly, and she loved him still; but she knew now,--at\nthis moment felt absolutely sure,--that by him she was hated! In\nspite of all her roughness and temper, Mrs. Proudie was in this\nlike other women,--that she would fain have been loved had it been\npossible. She had always meant to serve him. She was conscious\nof that; conscious also in a way that, although she had been\nindustrious, although she had been faithful, although she was clever,\nyet she had failed. At the bottom of her heart she knew that she\nhad been a bad wife. And yet she had meant to be a pattern wife!\nShe had meant to be a good Christian; but she had so exercised her\nChristianity that not a soul in the world loved her, or would endure\nher presence if it could be avoided! She had sufficient insight to\nthe minds and feelings of those around her to be aware of this.\nAnd now her husband had told her that her tyranny to him was so\noverbearing that he must throw up his great position, and retire to\nan obscurity that would be exceptionally disgraceful to them both,\nbecause he could no longer endure the public disgrace which her\nconduct brought upon him in his high place before the world! Her\nheart was too full for speech; and she left him, very quietly closing\nthe door behind her.\n\nShe was preparing to go up to her chamber, with her hand on the\nbanisters and with her foot on the stairs, when she saw the servant\nwho had answered the bishop's bell. \"John,\" she said, \"when Mr.\nThumble comes to the palace, let me see him before he goes to my\nlord.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said John, who well understood the nature of these\nquarrels between his master and his mistress. But the commands of the\nmistress were still paramount among the servants, and John proceeded\non his mission with the view of accomplishing Mrs. Proudie's behests.\nThen Mrs. Proudie went upstairs to her chamber, and locked her door.\n\nMr. Thumble returned to Barchester that day, leading the broken-down\ncob; and a dreadful walk he had. He was not good at walking, and\nbefore he came near Barchester had come to entertain a violent hatred\nfor the beast he was leading. The leading of a horse that is tired,\nor in pain, or lame, or even stiff in his limbs, is not pleasant\nwork. The brute will not accommodate his paces to the man, and will\ncontrive to make his head very heavy on the bridle. And he will not\nwalk on the part of the road which the man intends for him, but\nwill lean against the man, and will make himself altogether very\ndisagreeable. It may be understood, therefore, that Mr. Thumble was\nnot in a good humour when he entered the palace yard. Nor was he\naltogether quiet in his mind as to the injury which he had done to\nthe animal. \"It was the brute's fault,\" said Mr. Thumble. \"It comes\ngenerally of not knowing how to ride 'em,\" said the groom. For Mr.\nThumble, though he often had a horse out of the episcopal stables,\nwas not ready with his shillings to the man who waited upon him with\nthe steed.\n\nHe had not, however, come to any satisfactory understanding\nrespecting the broken knees when the footman from the palace told\nhim he was wanted. It was in vain that Mr. Thumble pleaded that\nhe was nearly dead with fatigue, that he had walked all the way\nfrom Hogglestock and must go home to change his clothes. John was\nperemptory with him, insisting that he must wait first upon Mrs.\nProudie and then upon the bishop. Mr. Thumble might perhaps have\nturned a deaf ear to the latter command, but the former was one which\nhe felt himself bound to obey. So he entered the palace, rather\ncross, very much soiled as to his outer man; and in this condition\nwent up a certain small staircase which was familiar to him, to a\nsmall parlour which adjoined Mrs. Proudie's room, and there awaited\nthe arrival of the lady. That he should be required to wait some\nquarter of an hour was not surprising to him; but when half an hour\nwas gone, and he remembered himself of his own wife at home, and of\nthe dinner which he had not yet eaten, he ventured to ring the bell.\nMrs. Proudie's own maid, Mrs. Draper by name, came to him and said\nthat she had knocked twice at Mrs. Proudie's door and would knock\nagain. Two minutes after that she returned, running into the room\nwith her arms extended, and exclaiming, \"Oh, heavens, sir; mistress\nis dead!\" Mr. Thumble, hardly knowing what he was about, followed the\nwoman into the bedroom, and there he found himself standing awestruck\nbefore the corpse of her who had so lately been the presiding spirit\nof the palace.\n\nThe body was still resting on its legs, leaning against the end of\nthe side of the bed, while one of the arms was close clasped round\nthe bed-post. The mouth was rigidly closed, but the eyes were open as\nthough staring at him. Nevertheless there could be no doubt from the\nfirst glance that the woman was dead. He went up close to it, but did\nnot dare to touch it. There was no one as yet there but he and Mrs.\nDraper;--no one else knew what had happened.\n\n\"It's her heart,\" said Mrs. Draper.\n\n\"Did she suffer from heart complaint?\" he asked.\n\n\"We suspected it, sir, though nobody knew it. She was very shy of\ntalking about herself.\"\n\n\"We must send for the doctor at once,\" said Mr. Thumble. \"We had\nbetter touch nothing till he is here.\" Then they retreated and the\ndoor was locked.\n\nIn ten minutes everybody in the house knew it except the bishop; and\nin twenty minutes the nearest apothecary with his assistant were in\nthe room, and the body had been properly laid upon the bed. Even then\nthe husband had not been told,--did not know either his relief or his\nloss. It was now past seven, which was the usual hour for dinner at\nthe palace, and it was probable that he would come out of his room\namong the servants, if he were not summoned. When it was proposed to\nMr. Thumble that he should go in to him and tell him, he positively\ndeclined, saying that the sight which he had just seen and the\nexertions of the day together, had so unnerved him, that he had not\nphysical strength for the task. The apothecary, who had been summoned\nin a hurry, had escaped, probably being equally unwilling to be\nthe bearer of such a communication. The duty therefore fell to Mrs.\nDraper, and under the pressing instance of the other servants she\ndescended to her master's room. Had it not been that the hour of\ndinner had come, so that the bishop could not have been left much\nlonger to himself, the evil time would have been still postponed.\n\nShe went very slowly along the passage, and was just going to pause\nere she reached the room, when the door was opened and the bishop\nstood close before her. It was easy to be seen that he was cross. His\nhands and face were unwashed and his face was haggard. In these days\nhe would not even go through the ceremony of dressing himself before\ndinner. \"Mrs. Draper,\" he said, \"why don't they tell me that dinner\nis ready? Are they going to give me any dinner?\" She stood a moment\nwithout answering him, while the tears streamed down her face. \"What\nis the matter?\" said he. \"Has your mistress sent you here?\"\n\n\"Oh, laws!\" said Mrs. Draper,--and she put out her hands to support\nhim if such support should be necessary.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he demanded angrily.\n\n\"Oh, my lord;--bear it like a Christian. Mistress isn't no more.\" He\nleaned back against the door-post, and she took hold of him by the\narm. \"It was the heart, my lord. Dr. Filgrave hisself has not been\nyet; but that's what it was.\" The bishop did not say a word, but\nwalked back to his chair before the fire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII.\n\nIN MEMORIAM.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe bishop when he had heard the tidings of his wife's death walked\nback to his seat over the fire, and Mrs. Draper, the housekeeper,\ncame and stood over him without speaking. Thus she stood for ten\nminutes looking down at him and listening. But there was no sound;\nnot a word, nor a moan, nor a sob. It was as though he also were\ndead, but that a slight irregular movement of his fingers on the top\nof his bald head, told her that his mind and body were still active.\n\"My lord,\" she said at last, \"would you wish to see the doctor when\nhe comes?\" She spoke very low and he did not answer her. Then, after\nanother minute of silence, she asked the same question again.\n\n\"What doctor?\" he said.\n\n\"Dr. Filgrave. We sent for him. Perhaps he is here now. Shall I go\nand see, my lord?\" Mrs. Draper found that her position there was\nweary and she wished to escape. Anything on his behalf requiring\ntrouble or work she would have done willingly; but she could not\nstand there for ever watching the motion of his fingers.\n\n\"I suppose I must see him,\" said the bishop. Mrs. Draper took this\nas an order for her departure and crept silently out of the room,\nclosing the door behind her with the long protracted elaborate click\nwhich is always produced by an attempt at silence on such occasions.\nHe did not care for noise or for silence. Had she slammed the door\nhe would not have regarded it. A wonderful silence had come upon\nhim which for the time almost crushed him. He would never hear that\nwell-known voice again!\n\nHe was free now. Even in his misery,--for he was very miserable,--he\ncould not refrain from telling himself that. No one could now press\nuncalled-for into his study, contradict him in the presence of those\nbefore whom he was bound to be authoritative, and rob him of all his\ndignity. There was no one else of whom he was afraid. She had at\nleast kept him out of the hands of other tyrants. He was now his own\nmaster, and there was a feeling,--I may not call it of relief, for as\nyet there was more of pain in it than of satisfaction,--a feeling as\nthough he had escaped from an old trouble at a terrible cost of which\nhe could not as yet calculate the amount. He knew that he might now\ngive up all idea of writing to the archbishop.\n\nShe had in some ways, and at certain periods of his life, been very\ngood to him. She had kept his money for him and made things go\nstraight, when they had been poor. His interests had always been\nher interests. Without her he would never have been a bishop. So,\nat least, he told himself now, and so told himself probably with\ntruth. She had been very careful of his children. She had never been\nidle. She had never been fond of pleasure. She had neglected no\nacknowledged duty. He did not doubt that she was now on her way to\nheaven. He took his hands down from his head, and clasping them\ntogether, said a little prayer. It may be doubted whether he quite\nknew for what he was praying. The idea of praying for her soul, now\nthat she was dead, would have scandalized him. He certainly was not\npraying for his own soul. I think he was praying that God might save\nhim from being glad that his wife was dead.\n\nBut she was dead;--and, as it were, in a moment! He had not stirred\nout of that room since she had been there with him. Then there had\nbeen angry words between them,--perhaps more determined enmity on his\npart than ever had before existed; and they had parted for the last\ntime with bitter animosity. But he told himself that he had certainly\nbeen right in what he had done then. He thought he had been right\nthen. And so his mind went back to the Crawley and Thumble question,\nand he tried to alleviate the misery which that last interview with\nhis wife now created by assuring himself that he at least had been\njustified in what he had done.\n\nBut yet his thoughts were very tender to her. Nothing reopens the\nsprings of love so fully as absence, and no absence so thoroughly as\nthat which must needs be endless. We want that which we have not; and\nespecially that which we can never have. She had told him in the very\nlast moments of her presence with him that he was wishing that she\nwere dead, and he had made her no reply. At the moment he had felt,\nwith savage anger, that such was his wish. Her words had now come to\npass, and he was a widower,--and he assured himself that he would\ngive all that he possessed in the world to bring her back again.\n\nYes, he was a widower, and he might do as he pleased. The tyrant\nwas gone, and he was free. The tyrant was gone, and the tyranny had\ndoubtless been very oppressive. Who had suffered as he had done? But\nin thus being left without his tyrant he was wretchedly desolate.\nMight it not be that the tyranny had been good for him?--that the\nLord had known best what wife was fit for him? Then he thought of a\nstory which he had read,--and had well marked as he was reading,--of\nsome man who had been terribly afflicted by his wife, whose wife had\nstarved him and beaten him and reviled him; and yet this man had been\nable to thank his God for having thus mortified him in the flesh.\nMight it not be that the mortification which he himself had doubtless\nsuffered in his flesh had been intended for his welfare, and had\nbeen very good for him? But if this were so, it might be that the\nmortification was now removed because the Lord knew that his servant\nhad been sufficiently mortified. He had not been starved or beaten,\nbut the mortification had been certainly severe. Then there came\nwords--into his mind, not into his mouth--\"The Lord sent the thorn,\nand the Lord has taken it away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.\"\nAfter that he was very angry with himself, and tried to pray that he\nmight be forgiven. While he was so striving there came a low knock at\nthe door, and Mrs. Draper again entered the room.\n\n\"Dr. Filgrave, my lord, was not at home,\" said Mrs. Draper; \"but he\nwill be sent the very moment he arrives.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mrs. Draper.\"\n\n\"But, my lord, will you not come to your dinner? A little soup, or\na morsel of something to eat, and a glass of wine, will enable your\nlordship to bear it better.\" He allowed Mrs. Draper to persuade him,\nand followed her into the dining-room. \"Do not go, Mrs. Draper,\" he\nsaid; \"I would rather that you should stay with me.\" So Mrs. Draper\nstayed with him, and administered to his wants. He was desirous of\nbeing seen by as few eyes as possible in these the first moments of\nhis freedom.\n\nHe saw Dr. Filgrave twice, both before and after the doctor had been\nupstairs. There was no doubt, Dr. Filgrave said, that it was as Mrs.\nDraper had surmised. The poor lady was suffering, and had for years\nbeen suffering, from heart-complaint. To her husband she had never\nsaid a word on the subject. To Mrs. Draper a word had been said now\nand again,--a word when some moment of fear would come, when some\nsharp stroke of agony would tell of danger. But Mrs. Draper had kept\nthe secret of her mistress, and none of the family had known that\nthere was aught to be feared. Dr. Filgrave, indeed, did tell the\nbishop that he had dreaded all along exactly that which had happened.\nHe had said the same to Mr. Rerechild, the surgeon, when they two\nhad had a consultation together at the palace on the occasion of\na somewhat alarming birth of a grandchild. But he mixed up this\ninformation with so much medical Latin, and was so pompous over it,\nand the bishop was so anxious to be rid of him, that his words did\nnot have much effect. What did it all matter? The thorn was gone, and\nthe wife was dead, and the widower must balance his gain and loss as\nbest he might.\n\nHe slept well, but when he woke in the morning the dreariness of his\nloneliness was very strong on him. He must do something, and must see\nsomebody, but he felt that he did not know how to bear himself in his\nnew position. He must send of course for his chaplain, and tell his\nchaplain to open all letters and to answer them for a week. Then he\nremembered how many of his letters in days of yore had been opened\nand been answered by the helpmate who had just gone from him. Since\nDr. Tempest's visit he had insisted that the palace letter-bag should\nalways be brought in the first instance to him;--and this had been\ndone, greatly to the annoyance of his wife. In order that it might\nbe done the bishop had been up every morning an hour before his\nusual time; and everybody in the household had known why it was\nso. He thought of this now as the bag was brought to him on the\nfirst morning of his freedom. He could have it where he pleased\nnow;--either in his bedroom or left for him untouched on the\nbreakfast-table till he should go to it. \"Blessed be the name of\nthe Lord,\" he said as he thought of all this; but he did not stop\nto analyse what he was saying. On this morning he would not enjoy\nhis liberty, but desired that the letter-bag might be taken to Mr.\nSnapper, the chaplain.\n\nThe news of Mrs. Proudie's death had spread all over Barchester\non the evening of its occurrence, and had been received with that\nfeeling of distant awe which is always accompanied by some degree of\npleasurable sensation. There was no one in Barchester to lament a\nmother, or a sister, or a friend who was really loved. There were\nthose, doubtless, who regretted the woman's death,--and even some\nwho regretted it without any feeling of personal damage done to\nthemselves. There had come to be around Mrs. Proudie a party who\nthought as she thought on church matters, and such people had lost\ntheir head, and thereby their strength. And she had been staunch to\nher own party, preferring bad tea from a low-church grocer, to good\ntea from a grocer who went to the ritualistic church or to no church\nat all. And it is due to her to say that she did not forget those who\nwere true to her,--looking after them mindfully where looking after\nmight be profitable, and fighting their battles where fighting might\nbe more serviceable. I do not think that the appetite for breakfast\nof any man or woman in Barchester was disturbed by the news of Mrs.\nProudie's death, but there were some who felt that a trouble had\nfallen on them.\n\nTidings of the catastrophe reached Hiram's Hospital on the evening of\nits occurrence,--Hiram's Hospital, where dwelt Mr. and Mrs. Quiverful\nwith all their children. Now Mrs. Quiverful owed a debt of gratitude\nto Mrs. Proudie, having been placed in her present comfortable home\nby that lady's patronage. Mrs. Quiverful perhaps understood the\ncharacter of the deceased woman, and expressed her opinion respecting\nit, as graphically as did any one in Barchester. There was the\nnatural surprise felt at the Warden's lodge in the Hospital when the\ntidings were first received there, and the Quiverful family was at\nfirst too full of dismay, regrets and surmises, to be able to give\nthemselves impartially to criticism. But on the following morning,\nconversation at the breakfast-table naturally referring to the great\nloss which the bishop had sustained, Mrs. Quiverful thus pronounced\nher opinion of her friend's character: \"You'll find that he'll feel\nit, Q.,\" she said to her husband, in answer to some sarcastic remark\nmade by him as to the removal of the thorn. \"He'll feel it, though\nshe was almost too many for him while she was alive.\"\n\n\"I daresay he'll feel it at first,\" said Quiverful; \"but I think\nhe'll be more comfortable than he has been.\"\n\n\"Of course he'll feel it, and go on feeling it till he dies, if he's\nthe man I take him to be. You're not to think that there has been no\nlove because there used to be some words, that he'll find himself the\nhappier because he can do things more as he pleases. She was a great\nhelp to him, and he must have known that she was, in spite of the\nsharpness of her tongue. No doubt she was sharp. No doubt she was\nupsetting. And she could make herself a fool too in her struggles to\nhave everything her own way. But, Q., there were worse women than\nMrs. Proudie. She was never one of your idle ones, and I'm quite sure\nthat no man or woman ever heard her say a word against her husband\nbehind his back.\"\n\n\"All the same, she gave him a terribly bad life of it, if all is true\nthat we hear.\"\n\n\"There are men who must have what you call a terribly bad life of\nit, whatever way it goes with them. The bishop is weak, and he wants\nsomebody near to him to be strong. She was strong,--perhaps too\nstrong; but he had his advantage out of it. After all I don't know\nthat his life has been so terribly bad. I daresay he's had everything\nvery comfortable about him. And a man ought to be grateful for that,\nthough very few men ever are.\"\n\nMr. Quiverful's predecessor at the Hospital, old Mr. Harding, whose\nhalcyon days in Barchester had been passed before the coming of the\nProudies, was in bed playing cat's-cradle with Posy seated on the\ncounterpane, when the tidings of Mrs. Proudie's death were brought to\nhim by Mrs. Baxter. \"Oh, sir,\" said Mrs. Baxter, seating herself on\na chair by the bed-side. Mr. Harding liked Mrs. Baxter to sit down,\nbecause he was almost sure on such occasions to have the advantage of\na prolonged conversation.\n\n\"What is it, Mrs. Baxter?\"\n\n\"Oh, sir!\"\n\n\"Is anything the matter?\" And the old man attempted to raise himself\nin his bed.\n\n\"You mustn't frighten grandpa,\" said Posy.\n\n\"No, my dear; and there isn't nothing to frighten him. There isn't\nindeed, Mr. Harding. They're all well at Plumstead, and when I heard\nfrom the missus at Venice, everything was going on well.\"\n\n\"But what is it, Mrs. Baxter?\"\n\n\"God forgive her all her sins--Mrs. Proudie ain't no more.\" Now there\nhad been a terrible feud between the palace and the deanery for\nyears, in carrying on which the persons of the opposed households\nwere wont to express themselves with eager animosity. Mrs. Baxter and\nMrs. Draper never spoke to each other. The two coachmen each longed\nfor an opportunity to take the other before a magistrate for some\nbreach of the law of the road in driving. The footmen abused each\nother, and the grooms occasionally fought. The masters and mistresses\ncontented themselves with simple hatred. Therefore it was not\nsurprising that Mrs. Baxter, in speaking of the death of Mrs.\nProudie, should remember first her sins.\n\n\"Mrs. Proudie dead!\" said the old man.\n\n\"Indeed she is, Mr. Harding,\" said Mrs. Baxter, putting both her\nhands together piously. \"We're just grass, ain't we, sir! and dust\nand clay and flowers of the field?\" Whether Mrs. Proudie had most\npartaken of the clayey nature or of the flowery nature, Mrs. Baxter\ndid not stop to consider.\n\n\"Mrs. Proudie dead!\" said Posy, with a solemnity that was all her\nown. \"Then she won't scold the poor bishop any more.\"\n\n\"No, my dear; she won't scold anybody any more; and it will be a\nblessing for some, I must say. Everybody is always so considerate in\nthis house, Miss Posy, that we none of us know nothing about what\nthat is.\"\n\n\"Dead!\" said Mr. Harding again. \"I think, if you please, Mrs. Baxter,\nyou shall leave me for a little time, and take Miss Posy with you.\"\nHe had been in the city of Barchester some fifty years, and here was\none who might have been his daughter, who had come there scarcely ten\nyears since, and who now had gone before him! He had never loved Mrs.\nProudie. Perhaps he had gone as near to disliking Mrs. Proudie as he\nhad ever gone to disliking any person. Mrs. Proudie had wounded him\nin every part that was most sensitive. It would be long to tell,\nnor need it be told now, how she had ridiculed his cathedral work,\nhow she had made nothing of him, how she had despised him, always\nmanifesting her contempt plainly. He had been even driven to rebuke\nher, and it had perhaps been the only personal rebuke which he had\never uttered in Barchester. But now she was gone; and he thought of\nher simply as an active pious woman, who had been taken away from her\nwork before her time. And for the bishop, no idea ever entered Mr.\nHarding's mind as to the removal of a thorn. The man had lost his\nlife's companion at that time of life when such a companion is most\nneeded; and Mr. Harding grieved for him with sincerity.\n\nThe news went out to Plumstead Episcopi by the postman, and happened\nto reach the archdeacon as he was talking to his sexton at the little\ngate leading into the churchyard. \"Mrs. Proudie dead!\" he almost\nshouted, as the postman notified the fact to him. \"Impossible!\"\n\n\"It be so for zartain, yer reverence,\" said the postman, who was\nproud of his news.\n\n\"Heavens!\" ejaculated the archdeacon, and then hurried in to his\nwife. \"My dear,\" he said--and as he spoke he could hardly deliver\nhimself of his words, so eager was he to speak them--\"who do you\nthink is dead? Gracious heavens! Mrs. Proudie is dead!\" Mrs. Grantly\ndropped from her hand the teaspoonful of tea that was just going into\nthe pot, and repeated her husband's words. \"Mrs. Proudie dead?\" There\nwas a pause, during which they looked into each other's faces. \"My\ndear, I don't believe it,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\nBut she did believe it very shortly. There were no prayers at\nPlumstead rectory that morning. The archdeacon immediately went out\ninto the village, and soon obtained sufficient evidence of the truth\nof that which the postman had told him. Then he rushed back to his\nwife. \"It's true,\" he said. \"It's quite true. She's dead. There's no\ndoubt about that. She's dead. It was last night about seven. That was\nwhen they found her, at least, and she may have died about an hour\nbefore. Filgrave says not more than an hour.\"\n\n\"And how did she die?\"\n\n\"Heart-complaint. She was standing up, taking hold of the bedstead,\nand so they found her.\" Then there was a pause, during which the\narchdeacon sat down to his breakfast. \"I wonder how he felt when he\nheard it?\"\n\n\"Of course he was terribly shocked.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt he was shocked. Any man would be shocked. But when you\ncome to think of it, what a relief!\"\n\n\"How can you speak of it in that way?\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"How am I to speak of it in any other way?\" said the archdeacon. \"Of\ncourse I shouldn't go and say it out in the street.\"\n\n\"I don't think you ought to say it anywhere,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"The\npoor man no doubt feels about his wife in the same way that anybody\nelse would.\"\n\n\"And if any other poor man has got such a wife as she was, you may be\nquite sure that he would be glad to be rid of her. I don't say that\nhe wished her to die, or that he would have done anything to contrive\nher death--\"\n\n\"Gracious, archdeacon; do, pray, hold your tongue.\"\n\n\"But it stands to reason that her going will be a great relief to\nhim. What has she done for him? She has made him contemptible to\neverybody in the diocese by her interference, and his life has been a\nburden to him through her violence.\"\n\n\"Is that the way you carry out your proverb of De mortuis?\" said Mrs.\nGrantly.\n\n\"The proverb of De mortuis is founded on humbug. Humbug out of doors\nis necessary. It would not do for you and me to go into the High\nStreet just now and say what we think about Mrs. Proudie; but I don't\nsuppose that kind of thing need be kept up in here, between you and\nme. She was an uncomfortable woman,--so uncomfortable that I cannot\nbelieve that any one will regret her. Dear me! Only to think that she\nhas gone! You may as well give me my tea.\"\n\nI do not think that Mrs. Grantly's opinion differed much from that\nexpressed by her husband, or that she was, in truth, the least\noffended by the archdeacon's plain speech. But it must be remembered\nthat there was probably no house in the diocese in which Mrs. Proudie\nhad been so thoroughly hated as she had been at the Plumstead\nrectory. There had been hatred at the deanery; but the hatred at the\ndeanery had been mild in comparison with the hatred at Plumstead. The\narchdeacon was a sound friend; but he was also a sound enemy. From\nthe very first arrival of the Proudies at Barchester, Mrs. Proudie\nhad thrown down her gauntlet to him, and he had not been slow in\npicking it up. The war had been internecine, and each had given the\nother terrible wounds. It had been understood that there should be\nno quarter, and there had been none. His enemy was now dead, and\nthe archdeacon could not bring himself to adopt before his wife the\nnamby-pamby every-day decency of speaking well of one of whom he\nhad ever thought ill, or of expressing regret when no regret could\nbe felt. \"May all her sins be forgiven her,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\"Amen,\" said the archdeacon. There was something in the tone of\nhis Amen which thoroughly implied that it was uttered only on the\nunderstanding that her departure from the existing world was to be\nregarded as an unmitigated good, and that she should, at any rate,\nnever come back again to Barchester.\n\nWhen Lady Lufton heard the tidings, she was not so bold in speaking\nof it as was her friend the archdeacon. \"Mrs. Proudie dead!\" she\nsaid to her daughter-in-law. This was some hours after the news had\nreached the house, and when the fact of the poor lady's death had\nbeen fully recognized. \"What will he do without her?\"\n\n\"The same as other men do,\" said young Lady Lufton.\n\n\"But, my dear, he is not the same as other men. He is not at all like\nother men. He is so weak that he cannot walk without a stick to lean\nupon. No doubt she was a virago, a woman who could not control her\ntemper for a moment! No doubt she had led him a terrible life! I have\noften pitied him with all my heart. But, nevertheless, she was useful\nto him. I suppose she was useful to him. I can hardly believe that\nMrs. Proudie is dead. Had he gone, it would have seemed so much more\nnatural. Poor woman. I daresay she had her good points.\" The reader\nwill be pleased to remember that the Luftons had ever been strong\npartisans on the side of the Grantlys.\n\nThe news made its way even to Hogglestock on the same day. Mrs.\nCrawley, when she heard it, went out after her husband, who was in\nthe school. \"Dead!\" said he, in answer to her whisper. \"Do you tell\nme that the woman is dead?\" Then Mrs. Crawley explained that the\ntidings were credible. \"May God forgive her all her sins,\" said Mr.\nCrawley. \"She was a violent woman, certainly, and I think that she\nmisunderstood her duties; but I do not say that she was a bad woman.\nI am inclined to think that she was earnest in her endeavours to do\ngood.\" It never occurred to Mr. Crawley that he and his affair had,\nin truth, been the cause of her death.\n\nIt was thus that she was spoken of for a few days; and then men and\nwomen ceased to speak much of her, and began to talk of the bishop\ninstead. A month had not passed before it was surmised that a man so\nlong accustomed to the comforts of married life would marry again;\nand even then one lady connected with low-church clergymen in and\naround the city was named as a probable successor to the great lady\nwho was gone. For myself, I am inclined to think that the bishop will\nfor the future be content to lean upon his chaplain.\n\nThe monument that was put up to our old friend's memory in one of the\nside aisles of the choir of the cathedral was supposed to be designed\nand executed in good taste. There was a broken column, and on the\ncolumn simply the words, \"My beloved wife!\" Then there was a slab by\nthe column, bearing Mrs. Proudie's name, with the date of her life\nand death. Beneath this was the common inscription,--\n\n   \"_Requiescat in pace._\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\n\nTHE OBSTINACY OF MR. CRAWLEY.\n\n\nDr. Tempest, when he heard the news, sent immediately to Mr. Robarts,\nbegging him to come over to Silverbridge. But this message was\nnot occasioned solely by the death of Mrs. Proudie. Dr. Tempest\nhad also heard that Mr. Crawley had submitted himself to the\nbishop, that instant advantage,--and as Dr. Tempest thought, unfair\nadvantage,--had been taken of Mr. Crawley's submission, and that the\npernicious Thumble had been at once sent over to Hogglestock. Had\nthese palace doings with reference to Mr. Crawley been unaccompanied\nby the catastrophe which had happened, the doctor, much as he might\nhave regretted them, would probably have felt that there was nothing\nto be done. He could not in such case have prevented Thumble's\njourney to Hogglestock on the next Sunday, and certainly he could\nnot have softened the heart of the presiding genius at the palace.\nBut things were very different now. The presiding genius was gone.\nEverybody at the palace would for a while be weak and vacillating.\nThumble would be then thoroughly cowed; and it might at any rate be\npossible to make some movement in Mr. Crawley's favour. Dr. Tempest,\ntherefore, sent for Mr. Robarts.\n\n\"I'm giving you a great deal of trouble, Robarts,\" said the doctor;\n\"but then you are so much younger than I am, and I've an idea\nthat you would do more for this poor man than any one else in the\ndiocese.\" Mr. Robarts of course declared that he did not begrudge his\ntrouble, and that he would do anything in his power for the poor man.\n\"I think that you should see him again, and that you should then see\nThumble also. I don't know whether you can condescend to be civil to\nThumble. I could not.\"\n\n\"I am not quite sure that incivility would not be more efficacious,\"\nsaid Mr. Robarts.\n\n\"Very likely. There are men who are deaf as adders to courtesy, but\nwho are compelled to obedience at once by ill-usage. Very likely\nThumble is one of them; but of that you will be the best judge\nyourself. I would see Crawley first, and get his consent.\"\n\n\"That's the difficulty.\"\n\n\"Then I should go on without his consent, and I would see Thumble and\nthe bishop's chaplain, Snapper. I think you might manage just at this\nmoment, when they will all be a little abashed and perplexed by this\nwoman's death, to arrange that simply nothing shall be done. The\ngreat thing will be that Crawley should go on with the duty till the\nassizes. If it should then happen that he goes into Barchester, is\nacquitted, and comes back again, the whole thing will be over, and\nthere will be no further interference in the parish. If I were you,\nI think I would try it.\" Mr. Robarts said that he would try it. \"I\ndaresay Mr. Crawley will be a little stiff-necked with you.\"\n\n\"He will be very stiff-necked with me,\" said Mr. Robarts.\n\n\"But I can hardly think that he will throw away the only means he has\nof supporting his wife and children, when he finds that there can be\nno occasion for his doing so. I do not suppose that any person wishes\nhim to throw up his work now that that poor woman has gone.\"\n\nMr. Crawley had been almost in good spirits since the last visit\nwhich Mr. Thumble had made to him. It seemed as though the loss of\neverything in the world was in some way satisfactory to him. He had\nnow given up his living by his own doing, and had after a fashion\nacknowledged his guilt by this act. He had proclaimed to all around\nhim that he did not think himself to be any longer fit to perform the\nsacred functions of his office. He spoke of his trial as though a\nverdict against him must be the result. He knew that in going into\nprison he would leave his wife and children dependent on the charity\nof their friends,--on charity which they must condescend to accept,\nthough he could not condescend to ask it. And yet he was able to\ncarry himself now with a greater show of fortitude than had been\nwithin his power when the extent of his calamity was more doubtful.\nI must not ask the reader to suppose that he was cheerful. To have\nbeen cheerful under such circumstances would have been inhuman.\nBut he carried his head on high, and walked firmly, and gave his\norders at home with a clear voice. His wife, who was necessarily more\ndespondent than ever, wondered at him,--but wondered in silence. It\ncertainly seemed as though the very extremity of ill-fortune was\ngood for him. And he was very diligent with his school, passing the\ngreater part of the morning with the children. Mr. Thumble had told\nhim that he would come on Sunday, and that he would then take charge\nof the parish. Up to the coming of Mr. Thumble he would do everything\nin the parish that could be done by a clergyman with a clear spirit\nand a free heart. Mr. Thumble should not find that spiritual weeds\nhad grown rank in the parish because of his misfortunes.\n\nMrs. Proudie had died on the Tuesday,--that having been the day of\nMr. Thumble's visit to Hogglestock,--and Mr. Robarts had gone over to\nSilverbridge, in answer to Dr. Tempest's invitation, on the Thursday.\nHe had not, therefore, the command of much time, it being his express\nobject to prevent the appearance of Mr. Thumble at Hogglestock\non the next Sunday. He had gone to Silverbridge by railway, and\nhad, therefore, been obliged to postpone his visit to Mr. Crawley\ntill the next day; but early on the Friday morning he rode over\nto Hogglestock. That he did not arrive there with a broken-knee'd\nhorse, the reader may be quite sure. In all matters of that sort, Mr.\nRobarts was ever above reproach. He rode a good horse, and drove a\nneat gig, and was always well dressed. On this account Mr. Crawley,\nthough he really liked Mr. Robarts, and was thankful to him for many\nkindnesses, could never bear his presence with perfect equanimity.\nRobarts was no scholar, was not a great preacher, had obtained no\ncelebrity as a churchman,--had, in fact, done nothing to merit great\nreward; and yet everything had been given to him with an abundant\nhand. Within the last twelvemonth his wife had inherited Mr. Crawley\ndid not care to know how many thousand pounds. And yet Mr. Robarts\nhad won all that he possessed by being a clergyman. Was it possible\nthat Mr. Crawley should regard such a man with equanimity? Robarts\nrode over with a groom behind him,--really taking the groom because\nhe knew that Mr. Crawley would have no one to hold his horse for\nhim;--and the groom was the source of great offence. He came upon Mr.\nCrawley standing at the school door, and stopping at once, jumped off\nhis nag. There was something in the way in which he sprang out of the\nsaddle and threw the reins to the man, which was not clerical in Mr.\nCrawley's eyes. No man could be so quick in the matter of a horse\nwho spent as many hours with the poor and with the children as\nshould be spent by a parish clergyman. It might be probable that Mr.\nRobarts had never stolen twenty pounds,--might never be accused of\nso disgraceful a crime,--but, nevertheless, Mr. Crawley had his own\nideas, and made his own comparisons.\n\n\"Crawley,\" said Robarts, \"I am so glad to find you at home.\"\n\n\"I am generally to be found in the parish,\" said the perpetual curate\nof Hogglestock.\n\n\"I know you are,\" said Robarts, who knew the man well, and cared\nnothing for his friend's peculiarities when he felt his own withers\nto be unwrung. \"But you might have been down at Hoggle End with the\nbrickmakers, and then I should have had to go after you.\"\n\n\"I should have grieved--,\" began Crawley; but Robarts interrupted him\nat once.\n\n\"Let us go for a walk, and I'll leave the man with the horses. I've\nsomething special to say to you, and I can say it better out here\nthan in the house. Grace is quite well, and sends her love. She is\ngrowing to look so beautiful!\"\n\n\"I hope she may grow in grace with God,\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"She's as good a girl as I ever knew. By-the-by, you had Henry\nGrantly over here the other day?\"\n\n\"Major Grantly, whom I cannot name without expressing my esteem for\nhim, did do us the honour of calling upon us not very long since. If\nit be with reference to him that you have taken this trouble--\"\n\n\"No, no; not at all. I'll allow him and the ladies to fight out that\nbattle. I've not the least doubt in the world how that will go. When\nI'm told that she made a complete conquest of the archdeacon, there\ncannot be a doubt about that.\"\n\n\"A conquest of the archdeacon!\"\n\nBut Mr. Robarts did not wish to have to explain anything further\nabout the archdeacon. \"Were you not terribly shocked, Crawley,\" he\nasked, \"when you heard of the death of Mrs. Proudie?\"\n\n\"It was sudden and very awful,\" said Mr. Crawley. \"Such deaths are\nalways shocking. Not more so, perhaps, as regards the wife of a\nbishop, than with any other woman.\"\n\n\"Only we happened to know her.\"\n\n\"No doubt the finite and meagre nature of our feelings does prevent\nus from extending our sympathies to those whom we have not seen\nin the flesh. It should not be so, and would not with one who had\nnurtured his heart with proper care. And we are prone to permit an\nevil worse than that to canker our regards and to foster and to mar\nour solicitudes. Those who are high in station strike us more by\ntheir joys and sorrows than do the poor and lowly. Were some young\nduke's wife, wedded but the other day, to die, all England would put\non some show of mourning,--nay, would feel some true gleam of pity;\nbut nobody cares for the widowed brickmaker seated with his starving\ninfant on his cold hearth.\"\n\n\"Of course we hear more of the big people,\" said Robarts.\n\n\"Ay; and think more of them. But do not suppose, sir, that I complain\nof this man or that woman because his sympathies, or hers, run out of\nthat course which my reason tells me they should hold. The man with\nwhom it would not be so would simply be a god among men. It is in\nhis perfection as a man that we recognize the divinity of Christ. It\nis in the imperfection of men that we recognize our necessity for a\nChrist. Yes, sir, the death of the poor lady at Barchester was very\nsudden. I hope that my lord the bishop bears with becoming fortitude\nthe heavy misfortune. They say that he was a man much beholden to his\nwife,--prone to lean upon her in his goings out and comings in. For\nsuch a man such a loss is more dreadful perhaps than for another.\"\n\n\"They say she led him a terrible life, you know.\"\n\n\"I am not prone, sir, to believe much of what I hear about the\ndomesticities of other men, knowing how little any other man can know\nof my own. And I have, methinks, observed a proneness in the world to\nridicule that dependence on a woman which every married man should\nacknowledge in regard to the wife of his bosom, if he can trust her\nas well as love her. When I hear jocose proverbs spoken as to men,\nsuch as that in this house the gray mare is the better horse, or that\nin that house the wife wears that garment which is supposed to denote\nvirile command, knowing that the joke is easy, and that meekness in\na man is more truly noble than a habit of stern authority, I do not\nallow them to go far with me in influencing my judgment.\"\n\nSo spoke Mr. Crawley, who never permitted the slightest interference\nwith his own word in his own family, and who had himself been a\nwitness of one of those scenes between the bishop and his wife in\nwhich the poor bishop had been so cruelly misused. But to Mr. Crawley\nthe thing which he himself had seen under such circumstances was as\nsacred as though it had come to him under the seal of confession. In\nspeaking of the bishop and Mrs. Proudie,--nay, as far as was possible\nin thinking of them,--he was bound to speak and to think as though he\nhad not witnessed that scene in the palace study.\n\n\"I don't suppose that there is much doubt about her real character,\"\nsaid Robarts. \"But you and I need not discuss that.\"\n\n\"By no means. Such discussion would be both useless and unseemly.\"\n\n\"And just at present there is something else that I specially want\nto say to you. Indeed, I went to Silverbridge on the same subject\nyesterday, and have come here expressly to have a little conversation\nwith you.\"\n\n\"If it be about affairs of mine, Mr. Robarts, I am indeed troubled in\nspirit that so great labour should have fallen upon you.\"\n\n\"Never mind my labour. Indeed your saying that is a nuisance to me,\nbecause I hoped that by this time you would have understood that I\nregard you as a friend, and that I think nothing any trouble that\nI do for a friend. Your position just now is so peculiar that it\nrequires a great deal of care.\"\n\n\"No care can be of any avail to me.\"\n\n\"There I disagree with you. You must excuse me, but I do; and so does\nDr. Tempest. We think that you have been a little too much in a hurry\nsince he communicated to you the result of our first meeting.\"\n\n\"As how, sir?\"\n\n\"It is, perhaps, hardly worth while for us to go into the whole\nquestion; but that man, Thumble, must not come here on next Sunday.\"\n\n\"I cannot say, Mr. Robarts, that the Reverend Mr. Thumble has\nrecommended himself to me strongly either by his outward symbols of\nmanhood or by such manifestation of his inward mental gifts as I have\nsucceeded in obtaining. But my knowledge of him has been so slight,\nand has been acquired in a manner so likely to bias me prejudicially\nagainst him, that I am inclined to think my opinion should go for\nnothing. It is, however, the fact that the bishop has nominated him\nto this duty; and that, as I have myself simply notified my desire\nto be relieved from the care of the parish, on account of certain\nunfitness of my own, I am the last man who should interfere with the\nbishop in the choice of my temporary successor.\"\n\n\"It was her choice, not his.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Robarts, but I cannot allow that assertion to pass\nunquestioned. I must say that I have adequate cause for believing\nthat he came here by his lordship's authority.\"\n\n\"No doubt he did. Will you just listen to me for a moment? Ever since\nthis unfortunate affair of the cheque became known, Mrs. Proudie has\nbeen anxious to get you out of this parish. She was a violent woman,\nand chose to take this matter up violently. Pray hear me out before\nyou interrupt me. There would have been no commission at all but for\nher.\"\n\n\"The commission is right and proper and just,\" said Mr. Crawley, who\ncould not keep himself silent.\n\n\"Very well. Let it be so. But Mr. Thumble's coming over here is not\nproper or right; and you may be sure the bishop does not wish it.\"\n\n\"Let him send any other clergyman whom he may think more fitting,\"\nsaid Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"But we do not want him to send anybody.\"\n\n\"Somebody must be sent, Mr. Robarts.\"\n\n\"No, not so. Let me go over and see Thumble and Snapper,--Snapper,\nyou know, is the domestic chaplain; and all that you need do is to go\non with your services on Sunday. If necessary, I will see the bishop.\nI think you may be sure that I can manage it. If not, I will come\nback to you.\" Mr. Robarts paused for an answer, but it seemed for\nawhile that all Mr. Crawley's impatient desire to speak was over. He\nwalked on silently along the lane by his visitor's side, and when,\nafter some five or six minutes, Robarts stood still in the road, Mr.\nCrawley even then said nothing. \"It cannot be but that you should be\nanxious to keep the income of the parish for your wife and children,\"\nsaid Mark Robarts.\n\n\"Of course, I am anxious for my wife and children,\" Crawley answered.\n\n\"Then let me do as I say. Why should you throw away a chance, even if\nit be a bad one? But here the chance is all in your favour. Let me\nmanage it for you at Barchester.\"\n\n\"Of course I am anxious for my wife and children,\" said Crawley,\nrepeating his words; \"how anxious, I fancy no man can conceive who\nhas not been near enough to absolute want to know how terrible is its\napproach when it threatens those who are weak and who are very dear!\nBut, Mr. Robarts, you spoke just now of the chance of the thing,--the\nchance of your arranging on my behalf that I should for a while\nlonger be left in the enjoyment of the freehold of my parish. It\nseemeth to me that there should be no chance on such a subject;\nthat in the adjustment of so momentous a matter there should be a\nconsideration of right and wrong, and no consideration of aught\nbeside. I have been growing to feel, for some weeks past, that\ncircumstances,--whether through my own fault or not is an outside\nquestion as to which I will not further delay you by offering even an\nopinion,--that unfortunate circumstances have made me unfit to remain\nhere as guardian of the souls of the people of this parish. Then\nthere came to me the letter from Dr. Tempest,--for which I am greatly\nbeholden to him,--strengthening me altogether in this view. What\ncould I do then, Mr. Robarts? Could I allow myself to think of my\nwife and my children when such a question as that was before me for\nself-discussion?\"\n\n\"I would,--certainly,\" said Robarts.\n\n\"No, sir! Excuse the bluntness of my contradiction, but I feel\nassured that in such emergency you would look solely to duty,--as by\nGod's help, I will endeavour to do. Mr. Robarts, there are many of us\nwho in many things, are much worse than we believe ourselves to be.\nBut in other matters, and perhaps of larger moment, we can rise to\nideas of duty as the need for such ideas comes upon us. I say not\nthis at all as praising myself. I speak of men as I believe that\nthey will be found to be;--of yourself, of myself, and of others who\nstrive to live with clean hands and a clear conscience. I do not for\na moment think that you would retain your benefice at Framley if\nthere had come upon you, after much thought, an assured conviction\nthat you could not retain it without grievous injury to the souls of\nothers and grievous sin to your own. Wife and children, dear as they\nare to you and to me,--as dear to me as to you,--fade from the sight\nwhen the time comes for judgment on such a matter as that!\" They were\nstanding quite still now, facing each other, and Crawley, as he spoke\nwith a low voice, looked straight into his friend's eyes, and kept\nhis hand firmly fixed on his friend's arm.\n\n\"I cannot interfere further,\" said Robarts.\n\n\"No,--you cannot interfere further.\" Robarts, when he told the story\nof the interview to his wife that evening, declared that he had never\nheard a voice so plaintively touching as was the voice of Mr. Crawley\nwhen he uttered those last words.\n\nThey returned back to the servant and the house almost without a\nword, and Robarts mounted without offering to see Mrs. Crawley. Nor\ndid Mr. Crawley ask him to do so. It was better now that Robarts\nshould go. \"May God send you through all your troubles,\" said Mr.\nRobarts.\n\n\"Mr. Robarts, I thank you warmly, for your friendship,\" said Mr.\nCrawley. And then they parted. In about half an hour Mr. Crawley\nreturned to the house. \"Now for Pindar, Jane,\" he said, seating\nhimself at his old desk.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX.\n\nMR. CRAWLEY'S LAST APPEARANCE IN HIS OWN PULPIT.\n\n\nNo word or message from Mr. Crawley reached Barchester throughout\nthe week, and on the Sunday morning Mr. Thumble was under a positive\nengagement to go out to Hogglestock, and perform the services of the\nchurch. Dr. Tempest had been quite right in saying that Mr. Thumble\nwould be awed by the death of his patroness. Such was altogether\nthe case, and he was very anxious to escape from the task he had\nundertaken at her instance, if it were possible. In the first place,\nhe had never been a favourite with the bishop himself, and had now,\ntherefore, nothing to expect in the diocese. The crusts from bits of\nloaves and the morsels of broken fishes which had come in his way\nhad all come from the bounty of Mrs. Proudie. And then, as regarded\nthis special Hogglestock job, how was he to get paid for it? Whence,\nindeed, was he to seek repayment for the actual money which he would\nbe out of pocket in finding his way to Hogglestock and back again?\nBut he could not get to speak to the bishop, nor could he induce any\none who had access to his lordship to touch upon the subject. Mr.\nSnapper avoided him as much as possible; and Mr. Snapper, when he\nwas caught and interrogated, declared that he regarded the matter as\nsettled. Nothing could be in worse taste, Mr. Snapper thought, than\nto undo, immediately after the poor lady's death, work in the diocese\nwhich had been arranged and done by her. Mr. Snapper expressed his\nopinion that Mr. Thumble was bound to go out to Hogglestock; and,\nwhen Mr. Thumble declared petulantly that he would not stir a step\nout of Barchester, Mr. Snapper protested that Mr. Thumble would have\nto answer for it in this world and in the next if there were no\nservices at Hogglestock on that Sunday. On the Saturday evening Mr.\nThumble made a desperate attempt to see the bishop, but was told by\nMrs. Draper that the bishop had positively declined to see him. The\nbishop himself probably felt unwilling to interfere with his wife's\ndoings so soon after her death! So Mr. Thumble, with a heavy heart,\nwent across to \"The Dragon of Wantly,\" and ordered a gig, resolving\nthat the bill should be sent in to the palace. He was not going to\ntrust himself again upon the bishop's cob!\n\nUp to Saturday evening Mr. Crawley did the work of his parish, and\non the Saturday evening he made an address to his parishioners from\nhis pulpit. He had given notice among the brickmakers and labourers\nthat he wished to say a few words to them in the school-room; but the\nfarmers also heard of this and came with their wives and daughters,\nand all the brickmakers came, and most of the labourers were\nthere, so that there was no room for them in the school-house. The\ncongregation was much larger than was customary even in the church.\n\"They will come,\" he said to his wife, \"to hear a ruined man declare\nhis own ruin, but they will not come to hear the word of God.\"\nWhen it was found that the persons assembled were too many for the\nschool-room, the meeting was adjourned to the church, and Mr. Crawley\nwas forced to get into his pulpit. He said a short prayer, and then\nhe began his story.\n\n[Illustration: \"They will come to hear a ruined man\ndeclare his own ruin.\"]\n\nHis story as he told it then shall not be repeated now, as the same\nstory has been told too often already in these pages. Surely it was a\nsingular story for a parish clergyman to tell of himself in so solemn\na manner. That he had applied the cheque to his own purposes, and was\nunable to account for the possession of it, was certain. He did not\nknow when or how he had got it. Speaking to them then in God's house\nhe told them that. He was to be tried by a jury, and all he could\ndo was to tell the jury the same. He would not expect the jury to\nbelieve him. The jury would, of course, believe only that which was\nproved to them. But he did expect his old friends at Hogglestock,\nwho had known him so long, to take his word as true. That there was\nno sufficient excuse for his conduct, even in his own sight, this,\nhis voluntary resignation of his parish, was, he said, sufficient\nevidence. Then he explained to them, as clearly as he was able, what\nthe bishop had done, what the commission had done, and what he had\ndone himself. That he spoke no word of Mrs. Proudie to that audience\nneed hardly be mentioned here. \"And now, dearest friends, I leave\nyou,\" he said, with that weighty solemnity which was so peculiar to\nthe man, and which he was able to make singularly impressive even on\nsuch a congregation as that of Hogglestock, \"and I trust that the\nheavy but pleasing burden of the charge which I have had over you may\nfall into hands better fitted than mine have been for such work. I\nhave always known my own unfitness, by reason of the worldly cares\nwith which I have been laden. Poverty makes the spirit poor, and the\nhands weak, and the heart sore,--and too often makes the conscience\ndull. May the latter never be the case with any of you.\" Then he\nuttered another short prayer, and, stepping down from the pulpit,\nwalked out of the church, with his weeping wife hanging on his arm,\nand his daughter following them, almost dissolved in tears. He never\nagain entered that church as the pastor of the congregation.\n\nThere was an old lame man from Hoggle End leaning on his stick near\nthe door as Mr. Crawley went out, and with him was his old lame wife.\n\"He'll pull through yet,\" said the old man to his wife; \"you'll see\nelse. He'll pull through because he's so dogged. It's dogged as does\nit.\"\n\nOn that night the position of the members of Mr. Crawley's household\nseemed to have been changed. There was something almost of elation\nin his mode of speaking, and he said soft loving words, striving\nto comfort his wife. She, on the other hand, could say nothing to\ncomfort him. She had been averse to the step he was taking, but\nhad been unable to press her objection in opposition to his great\nargument as to duty. Since he had spoken to her in that strain which\nhe had used with Robarts, she also had felt that she must be silent.\nBut she could not even feign to feel the pride which comes from the\nperformance of a duty. \"What will he do when he comes out?\" she said\nto her daughter. The coming out spoken of by her was the coming out\nof prison. It was natural enough that she should feel no elation.\n\nThe breakfast on Sunday morning was to her, perhaps, the saddest\nscene of her life. They sat down, the three together, at the usual\nhour,--nine o'clock,--but the morning had not been passed as was\ncustomary on Sundays. It had been Mr. Crawley's practice to go into\nthe school from eight to nine; but on this Sunday he felt, as he\ntold his wife, that his presence would be an intrusion there. But\nhe requested Jane to go and perform her usual task. \"If Mr. Thumble\nshould come,\" he said to her, \"be submissive to him in all things.\"\nThen he stood at his door, watching to see at what hour Mr. Thumble\nwould reach the school. But Mr. Thumble did not attend the school on\nthat morning. \"And yet he was very express to me in his desire that\nI would not myself meddle with the duties,\" said Mr. Crawley to his\nwife as he stood at the door,--\"unnecessarily urgent, as I must say\nI thought at the time.\" If Mrs. Crawley could have spoken out her\nthoughts about Mr. Thumble at that moment, her words would, I think,\nhave surprised her husband.\n\nAt breakfast there was hardly a word spoken. Mr. Crawley took his\ncrust and eat it mournfully,--almost ostentatiously. Jane tried and\nfailed, and tried to hide her failure, failing in that also. Mrs.\nCrawley made no attempt. She sat behind her old teapot, with her\nhands clasped and her eyes fixed. It was as though some last day had\ncome upon her,--this, the first Sunday of her husband's degradation.\n\"Mary,\" he said to her, \"why do you not eat?\"\n\n\"I cannot,\" she replied, speaking not in a whisper, but in words\nwhich would hardly get themselves articulated. \"I cannot. Do not ask\nme.\"\n\n\"For the honour of the Lord you will want the strength which bread\nalone can give you,\" he said, intimating to her that he wished her to\nattend the service.\n\n\"Do not ask me to be there, Josiah. I cannot. It is too much for me.\"\n\n\"Nay; I will not press it,\" he said. \"I can go alone.\" He uttered no\nword expressive of a wish that his daughter should attend the church;\nbut when the moment came, Jane accompanied him. \"What shall I do,\nmamma,\" she said, \"if I find I cannot bear it?\" \"Try to bear it,\" the\nmother said. \"Try, for his sake. You are stronger now than I am.\"\n\nThe tinkle of the church bell was heard at the usual time, and Mr.\nCrawley, hat in hand, stood ready to go forth. He had heard nothing\nof Mr. Thumble, but had made up his mind that Mr. Thumble would not\ntrouble him. He had taken the precaution to request his churchwarden\nto be early at the church, so that Mr. Thumble might encounter no\ndifficulty. The church was very near to the house, and any vehicle\narriving might have been seen had Mr. Crawley watched closely. But no\none had cared to watch Mr. Thumble's arrival at the church. He did\nnot doubt that Mr. Thumble would be at the church. With reference to\nthe school, he had had some doubt.\n\nBut just as he was about to start he heard the clatter of a gig. Up\ncame Mr. Thumble to the door of the parsonage, and having come down\nfrom his gig was about to enter the house as though it were his own.\nMr. Crawley greeted him in the pathway, raising his hat from his\nhead, and expressing a wish that Mr. Thumble might not feel himself\nfatigued with his drive. \"I will not ask you into my poor house,\" he\nsaid, standing in the middle of the pathway; \"for that my wife is\nill.\"\n\n\"Nothing catching, I hope?\" said Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"Her malady is of the spirit rather than of the flesh,\" said Mr.\nCrawley. \"Shall we go on to the church?\"\n\n\"Certainly,--by all means. How about the surplice?\"\n\n\"You will find, I trust, that the churchwarden has everything in\nreadiness. I have notified to him expressly your coming, with the\npurport that it may be so.\"\n\n\"You'll take a part in the service, I suppose?\" said Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"No part,--no part whatever,\" said Mr. Crawley, standing still for a\nmoment as he spoke, and showing plainly by the tone of his voice how\ndismayed he was, how indignant he had been made, by so indecent a\nproposition. Was he giving up his pulpit to a stranger for any reason\nless cogent than one which made it absolutely imperative on him to be\nsilent in that church which had so long been his own?\n\n\"Just as you please,\" said Mr. Thumble. \"Only it's rather hard lines\nto have to do it all myself after coming all the way from Barchester\nthis morning.\" To this Mr. Crawley condescended to make no reply\nwhatever.\n\nIn the porch of the church, which was the only entrance, Mr. Crawley\nintroduced Mr. Thumble to the churchwarden, simply by a wave of the\nhand, and then passed on with his daughter to a seat which opened\nupon the aisle. Jane was going on to that which she had hitherto\nalways occupied with her mother in the little chancel; but Mr.\nCrawley would not allow this. Neither to him nor to any of his family\nwas there attached any longer the privilege of using the chancel of\nthe church of Hogglestock.\n\nMr. Thumble scrambled into the reading-desk some ten minutes after\nthe proper time, and went through the morning service under, what\nmust be admitted to be, serious difficulties. There were the eyes\nof Mr. Crawley fixed upon him throughout the work, and a feeling\npervaded him that everybody there regarded him as an intruder. At\nfirst this was so strong upon him that Mr. Crawley pitied him, and\nwould have encouraged him had it been possible. But as the work\nprogressed, and as custom and the sound of his own voice emboldened\nhim, there came to the man some touches of the arrogance which so\ngenerally accompanies cowardice, and Mr. Crawley's acute ear detected\nthe moment when it was so. An observer might have seen that the\nmotion of his hands was altered as they were lifted in prayer. Though\nhe was praying, even in prayer he could not forget the man who was\noccupying his desk.\n\nThen came the sermon, preached very often before, lasting exactly\nhalf-an-hour, and then Mr. Thumble's work was done. Itinerant\nclergymen, who preach now here and now there, as it had been the lot\nof Mr. Thumble to do, have at any rate this relief,--that they can\npreach their sermons often. From the communion-table Mr. Thumble had\nstated that, in the present peculiar circumstances of the parish,\nthere would be no second service at Hogglestock for the present; and\nthis was all he said or did peculiar to the occasion. The moment\nthe service was over he got into his gig, and was driven back to\nBarchester.\n\n\"Mamma,\" said Jane, as they sat at their dinner, \"such a sermon I am\nsure was never heard in Hogglestock before. Indeed, you can hardly\ncall it a sermon. It was downright nonsense.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Crawley, energetically, \"keep your criticisms for\nmatters that are profane; then, though they be childish and silly,\nthey may at least be innocent. Be critical on Euripides, if you must\nbe critical.\" But when Jane kissed her father after dinner, she,\nknowing his humour well, felt assured that her remarks had not been\ntaken altogether in ill part.\n\nMr. Thumble was neither seen nor heard of again in the parish during\nthe entire week.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX.\n\nMRS. ARABIN IS CAUGHT.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOne morning about the middle of April Mr. Toogood received a telegram\nfrom Venice which caused him instantly to leave his business in\nBedford Row and take the first train for Silverbridge. \"It seems\nto me that this job will be a deal of time and very little money,\"\nsaid his partner to him, when Toogood on the spur of the moment was\nmaking arrangements for his sudden departure and uncertain period\nof absence. \"That's about it,\" said Toogood. \"A deal of time, some\nexpense, and no returns. It's not the kind of business a man can live\nupon; is it?\" The partner growled, and Toogood went. But as we must\ngo with Mr. Toogood down to Silverbridge, and as we cannot make the\njourney in this chapter, we will just indicate his departure and then\ngo back to John Eames, who, as will be remembered, was just starting\nfor Florence when we last saw him.\n\nOur dear old friend Johnny had been rather proud of himself as he\nstarted from London. He had gotten an absolute victory over Sir\nRaffle Buffle, and that alone was gratifying to his feelings. He\nliked the excitement of a journey, and especially of a journey\nto Italy; and the importance of the cause of his journey was\nsatisfactory to him. But above all things he was delighted at having\nfound that Lily Dale was pleased at his going. He had seen clearly\nthat she was much pleased, and that she made something of a hero\nof him because of his alacrity in the cause of his cousin. He had\npartially understood,--had understood in a dim sort of way,--that\nhis want of favour in Lily's eyes had come from some deficiency of\nhis own in this respect. She had not found him to be a hero. She had\nknown him first as a boy, with boyish belongings around him, and she\nhad seen him from time to time as he became a man, almost with too\nmuch intimacy for the creation of that love with which he wished to\nfill her heart. His rival had come before her eyes for the first time\nwith all the glories of Pall Mall heroism about him, and Lily in her\nweakness had been conquered by them. Since that she had learned how\nweak she had been,--how silly, how childish, she would say to herself\nwhen she allowed her memory to go back to the details of her own\nstory; but not the less on that account did she feel the want of\nsomething heroic in a man before she could teach herself to look\nupon him as more worthy of her regard than other men. She had still\nunconsciously hoped in regard to Crosbie, but now that hope had been\ndispelled as unconsciously, simply by his appearance. There had\nbeen moments in which John Eames had almost risen to the necessary\npoint,--had almost made good his footing on the top of some moderate,\nbut still sufficient mountain. But there had still been a succession\nof little tumbles,--unfortunate slips for which he himself should\nnot always have been held responsible; and he had never quite stood\nupright on his pinnacle, visible to Lily's eyes as being really\nexcelsior. Of all this John Eames himself had an inkling which had\noften made him very uncomfortable. What the mischief was it she\nwanted of him; and what was he to do? The days for plucking glory\nfrom the nettle danger were clean gone by. He was well dressed. He\nknew a good many of the right sort of people. He was not in debt. He\nhad saved an old nobleman's life once upon a time, and had been a\ngood deal talked about on that score. He had even thrashed the man\nwho had ill-treated her. His constancy had been as the constancy of\na Jacob! What was it that she wanted of him? But in a certain way\nhe did know what was wanted; and now, as he started for Florence,\nintending to stop nowhere till he reached that city, he hoped that\nby this chivalrous journey he might even yet achieve the thing\nnecessary.\n\nBut on reaching Paris he heard tidings of Mrs. Arabin which induced\nhim to change his plans and make for Venice instead of for Florence.\nA banker at Paris, to whom he brought a letter, told him that Mrs.\nArabin would now be found at Venice. This did not perplex him at\nall. It would have been delightful to see Florence,--but was more\ndelightful still to see Venice. His journey was the same as far as\nTurin; but from Turin he proceeded through Milan to Venice, instead\nof going by Bologna to Florence. He had fortunately come armed with\nan Austrian passport,--as was necessary in those bygone days of\nVenetia's thraldom. He was almost proud of himself, as though he\nhad done something great, when he tumbled in to his inn at Venice,\nwithout having been in a bed since he left London.\n\nBut he was barely allowed to swim in a gondola, for on reaching\nVenice he found that Mrs. Arabin had gone back to Florence. He had\nbeen directed to the hotel which Mrs. Arabin had used, and was there\ntold that she had started the day before. She had received some\nletter, from her husband as the landlord thought, and had done so.\nThat was all the landlord knew. Johnny was vexed, but became a little\nprouder than before as he felt it to be his duty to go on to Florence\nbefore he went to bed. There would be another night in a railway\ncarriage, but he would live through it. There was just time to have\na tub and a breakfast, to swim in a gondola, to look at the outside\nof the Doge's palace, and to walk up and down the piazza before he\nstarted again. It was hard work, but I think he would have been\npleased had he heard that Mrs. Arabin had retreated from Florence to\nRome. Had such been the case, he would have folded his cloak around\nhim, and have gone on,--regardless of brigands,--thinking of Lily,\nand wondering whether anybody else had ever done so much before\nwithout going to bed. As it was, he found that Mrs. Arabin was at\nthe hotel in Florence,--still in bed, as he had arrived early in the\nmorning. So he had another tub, another breakfast, and sent up his\ncard. \"Mr. John Eames,\"--and across the top of it he wrote, \"has come\nfrom England about Mr. Crawley.\" Then he threw himself on to a sofa\nin the hotel reading-room, and went fast to sleep.\n\nJohn had found an opportunity of talking to a young lady in the\nbreakfast-room, and had told her of his deeds. \"I only left London on\nTuesday night, and I have come here taking Venice on the road.\"\n\n\"Then you have travelled fast,\" said the young lady.\n\n\"I haven't seen a bed, of course,\" said John.\n\nThe young lady immediately afterwards told her father. \"I suppose he\nmust be one of those Foreign Office messengers,\" said the young lady.\n\n\"Anything but that,\" said the gentleman. \"People never talk about\ntheir own trades. He's probably a clerk with a fortnight's leave of\nabsence, seeing how many towns he can do in the time. It's the usual\nway of travelling now-a-days. When I was young and there were no\nrailways, I remember going from Paris to Vienna without sleeping.\"\nLuckily for his present happiness, John did not hear this.\n\nHe was still fast asleep when a servant came to him from Mrs. Arabin\nto say that she would see him at once. \"Yes, yes; I'm quite ready to\ngo on,\" said Johnny, jumping up, and thinking of the journey to Rome.\nBut there was no journey to Rome before him. Mrs. Arabin was almost\nin the next room, and there he found her.\n\nThe reader will understand that they had never met before, and\nhitherto knew nothing of each other. Mrs. Arabin had never heard the\nname of John Eames till John's card was put into her hands, and would\nnot have known his business with her had he not written those few\nwords upon it. \"You have come about Mr. Crawley?\" she said to him,\neagerly. \"I have heard from my father that somebody was coming.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Arabin; as hard as I could travel. I had expected to find\nyou at Venice.\"\n\n\"Have you been at Venice?\"\n\n\"I have just arrived from Venice. They told me at Paris I should find\nyou there. However, that does not matter, as I have found you here. I\nwonder whether you can help us?\"\n\n\"Do you know Mr. Crawley? Are you a friend of his?\"\n\n\"I never saw him in my life; but he married my cousin.\"\n\n\"I gave him the cheque, you know,\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Eames, literally almost knocked backwards by the\neasiness of the words which contained a solution for so terrible a\ndifficulty. The Crawley case had assumed such magnitude, and the\ntroubles of the Crawley family had been so terrible, that it seemed\nto him to be almost sacrilegious that words so simply uttered should\nsuffice to cure everything. He had hardly hoped,--had at least barely\nhoped,--that Mrs. Arabin might be able to suggest something which\nwould put them all on a track towards discovery of the truth. But he\nfound that she had the clue in her hand, and that the clue was one\nwhich required no further delicacy of investigation. There would be\nnothing more to unravel; no journey to Jerusalem would be necessary!\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Arabin, \"I gave it to him. They have been writing\nto my husband about it, and never wrote to me; and till I received a\nletter about it from my father, and another from my sister, at Venice\nthe day before yesterday, I knew nothing of the particulars of Mr.\nCrawley's trouble.\"\n\n\"Had you not heard that he had been taken before the magistrates?\"\n\n\"No; not so much even as that. I had seen in 'Galignani' something\nabout a clergyman, but I did not know what clergyman; and I heard\nthat there was something wrong about Mr. Crawley's money, but there\nhas always been something wrong about money with poor Mr. Crawley;\nand as I knew that my husband had been written to also, I did not\ninterfere, further than to ask the particulars. My letters have\nfollowed me about, and I only learned at Venice, just before I came\nhere, what was the nature of the case.\"\n\n\"And did you do anything?\"\n\n\"I telegraphed at once to Mr. Toogood, who I understand is acting as\nMr. Crawley's solicitor. My sister sent me his address.\"\n\n\"He is my uncle.\"\n\n\"I telegraphed to him, telling him that I had given Mr. Crawley the\ncheque, and then I wrote to Archdeacon Grantly giving him the whole\nhistory. I was obliged to come here before I could return home, but\nI intended to start this evening.\"\n\n\"And what is the whole history?\" asked John Eames.\n\nThe history of the gift of the cheque was very simple. It has been\ntold how Mr. Crawley in his dire distress had called upon his old\nfriend at the deanery asking for pecuniary assistance. This he had\ndone with so much reluctance that his spirit had given way while\nhe was waiting in the dean's library, and he had wished to depart\nwithout accepting what the dean was quite willing to bestow upon\nhim. From this cause it had come to pass there had been no time for\nexplanatory words, even between the dean and his wife,--from whose\nprivate funds had in truth come the money which had been given to\nMr. Crawley. For the private wealth of the family belonged to Mrs.\nArabin, and not to the dean; and was left entirely in Mrs. Arabin's\nhands, to be disposed of as she might please. Previously to Mr.\nCrawley's arrival at the deanery this matter had been discussed\nbetween the dean and his wife, and it had been agreed between them\nthat a sum of fifty pounds should be given. It should be given by\nMrs. Arabin, but it was thought that the gift would come with more\ncomfort to the recipient from the hands of his old friend than from\nthose of his wife. There had been much discussion between them as to\nthe mode in which this might be done with least offence to the man's\nfeelings,--for they knew Mr. Crawley and his peculiarities well. At\nlast it was agreed that the notes should be put into an envelope,\nwhich envelope the dean should have ready with him. But when the\nmoment came the dean did not have the envelope ready, and was obliged\nto leave the room to seek his wife. And Mrs. Arabin explained to\nJohn Eames that even she had not had it ready, and had been forced\nto go to her own desk to fetch it. Then, at the last moment, with\nthe desire of increasing the good to be done to people who were so\nterribly in want, she put the cheque for twenty pounds, which was in\nher possession as money of her own, along with the notes, and in this\nway the cheque had been given by the dean to Mr. Crawley. \"I shall\nnever forgive myself for not telling the dean,\" she said. \"Had I done\nthat all this trouble would have been saved!\"\n\n\"But where did you get the cheque?\" Eames asked with natural\ncuriosity.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Mrs. Arabin. \"I have got to show now that I did not\nsteal it,--have I not? Mr. Soames will indict me now. And, indeed, I\nhave had some trouble to refresh my memory as to all the particulars,\nfor you see it is more than a year past.\" But Mrs. Arabin's mind\nwas clearer on such matters than Mr. Crawley's, and she was able to\nexplain that she had taken the cheque as part of the rent due to\nher from the landlord of \"The Dragon of Wantly,\" which inn was her\nproperty, having been the property of her first husband. For some\nyears past there had been a difficulty about the rent, things not\nhaving gone at \"The Dragon of Wantly\" as smoothly as they had used to\ngo. At one time the money had been paid half-yearly by the landlord's\ncheque on the bank at Barchester. For the last year-and-a-half this\nhad not been done, and the money had come into Mrs. Arabin's hands\nat irregular periods and in irregular sums. There was at this moment\nrent due for twelve months, and Mrs. Arabin expressed her doubt\nwhether she would get it on her return to Barchester. On the occasion\nto which she was now alluding, the money had been paid into her own\nhands, in the deanery breakfast-parlour, by a man she knew very\nwell,--not the landlord himself, but one bearing the landlord's name,\nwhom she believed to be the landlord's brother, or at least his\ncousin. The man in question was named Daniel Stringer, and he had\nbeen employed in \"The Dragon of Wantly,\" as a sort of clerk or\nmanaging man, as long as she had known it. The rent had been paid\nto her by Daniel Stringer quite as often as by Daniel's brother or\ncousin, John Stringer, who was, in truth, the landlord of the hotel.\nWhen questioned by John respecting the persons employed at the\ninn, she said that she did believe that there had been rumours of\nsomething wrong. The house had been in the hands of the Stringers for\nmany years,--before the property had been purchased by her husband's\nfather,--and therefore there had been an unwillingness to move them;\nbut gradually, so she said, there had come upon her and her husband a\nfeeling that the house must be put into other hands. \"But did you say\nnothing about the cheque?\" John asked. \"Yes, I said a good deal about\nit. I asked why a cheque of Mr. Soames's was brought to me, instead\nof being taken to the bank for money; and Stringer explained to me\nthat they were not very fond of going to the bank, as they owed\nmoney there, but that I could pay it into my account. Only I kept my\naccount at the other bank.\"\n\n\"You might have paid it in there?\" said Johnny.\n\n\"I suppose I might, but I didn't. I gave it to poor Mr. Crawley\ninstead,--like a fool, as I know now that I was. And so I have\nbrought all this trouble on him and on her; and now I must rush home,\nwithout waiting for the dean, as fast as the trains will carry me.\"\n\nEames offered to accompany her, and this offer was accepted. \"It is\nhard upon you, though,\" she said; \"you will see nothing of Florence.\nThree hours in Venice, and six in Florence, and no hours at all\nanywhere else, will be a hard fate to you on your first trip to\nItaly.\" But Johnny said \"Excelsior\" to himself once more, and thought\nof Lily Dale, who was still in London, hoping that she might hear of\nhis exertions; and he felt, perhaps, also, that it would be pleasant\nto return with a dean's wife, and never hesitated. Nor would it do,\nhe thought, for him to be absent in the excitement caused by the news\nof Mr. Crawley's innocence and injuries. \"I don't care a bit about\nthat,\" he said. \"Of course, I should like to see Florence, and, of\ncourse, I should like to go to bed; but I will live in hopes that I\nmay do both some day.\" And so there grew to be a friendship between\nhim and Mrs. Arabin even before they had started.\n\nHe was driven once through Florence; he saw the Venus de' Medici, and\nhe saw the Seggiola; he looked up from the side of the Duomo to the\ntop of the Campanile, and he walked round the back of the cathedral\nitself; he tried to inspect the doors of the Baptistery, and declared\nthat the \"David\" was very fine. Then he went back to the hotel, dined\nwith Mrs. Arabin, and started for England.\n\nThe dean was to have joined his wife at Venice, and then they were\nto have returned together, coming round by Florence. Mrs. Arabin had\nnot, therefore, taken her things away from Florence when she left\nit, and had been obliged to return to pick them up on her journey\nhomewards. He,--the dean,--had been delayed in his Eastern travels.\nNeither Syria nor Constantinople had got themselves done as quickly\nas he had expected, and he had, consequently, twice written to his\nwife, begging her to pardon the transgression of his absence for even\nyet a few days longer. \"Everything, therefore,\" as Mrs. Arabin said,\n\"has conspired to perpetuate this mystery, which a word from me would\nhave solved. I owe more to Mr. Crawley than I can ever pay him.\"\n\n\"He will be very well paid, I think,\" said John, \"when he hears the\ntruth. If you could see inside his mind at this moment, I'm sure\nyou'd find that he thinks he stole the cheque.\"\n\n\"He cannot think that, Mr. Eames. Besides, at this moment I hope he\nhas heard the truth.\"\n\n\"That may be, but he did think so. I do believe that he had not the\nslightest notion where he got it; and, which is more, not a single\nperson in the whole county had a notion. People thought that he had\npicked it up, and used it in his despair. And the bishop has been so\nhard upon him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Eames, that is the worst of all.\"\n\n\"So I am told. The bishop has a wife, I believe.\"\n\n\"Yes, he has a wife, certainly,\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"And people say that she is not very good-natured.\"\n\n\"There are some of us at Barchester who do not love her very dearly.\nI cannot say that she is one of my own especial friends.\"\n\n\"I believe she has been hard to Mr. Crawley,\" said John Eames.\n\n\"I should not be in the least surprised,\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\nThen they reached Turin, and there, taking up \"Galignani's Messenger\"\nin the reading-room of Trompetta's Hotel, John Eames saw that Mrs.\nProudie was dead. \"Look at that,\" said he, taking the paragraph\nto Mrs. Arabin; \"Mrs. Proudie is dead!\" \"Mrs. Proudie dead!\" she\nexclaimed. \"Poor woman! Then there will be peace at Barchester!\"\n\"I never knew her very intimately,\" she afterwards said to her\ncompanion, \"and I do not know that I have a right to say that she\never did me an injury. But I remember well her first coming into\nBarchester. My sister's father-in-law, the late bishop, was just\ndead. He was a mild, kind, dear old man, whom my father loved beyond\nall the world, except his own children. You may suppose we were all\na little sad. I was not specially connected with the cathedral then,\nexcept through my father,\"--and Mrs. Arabin, as she told all this,\nremembered that in the days of which she was speaking she was a\nyoung mourning widow,--\"but I think I can never forget the sort of\nharsh-toned p\u00c3\u00a6an of low-church trumpets with which that poor woman\nmade her entry into the city. She might have been more lenient, as\nwe had never sinned by being very high. She might, at any rate, have\nbeen more gentle with us at first. I think we had never attempted\nmuch beyond decency, good-will and comfort. Our comfort she utterly\ndestroyed. Good-will was not to her taste. And as for decency, when I\nremember some things, I must say that when the comfort and good-will\nwent, the decency went along with them. And now she is dead! I wonder\nhow the bishop will get on without her.\"\n\n\"Like a house on fire, I should think,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Fie, Mr. Eames; you shouldn't speak in such a way on such a\nsubject.\"\n\nMrs. Arabin and Johnny became fast friends as they journeyed home.\nThere was a sweetness in his character which endeared him readily\nto women; though, as we have seen, there was a want of something to\nmake one woman cling to him. He could be soft and pleasant-mannered.\nHe was fond of making himself useful, and was a perfect master of\nall those little caressing modes of behaviour in which the caress\nis quite impalpable, and of which most women know the value and\nappreciate the comfort. By the time that they had reached Paris John\nhad told Mrs. Arabin the whole story of Lily Dale and Crosbie, and\nMrs. Arabin had promised to assist him, if any assistance might be in\nher power.\n\n\"Of course I have heard of Miss Dale,\" she said, \"because we know the\nDe Courcys.\" Then she turned away her face, almost blushing, as she\nremembered the first time that she had seen that Lady Alexandrina\nDe Courcy whom Mr. Crosbie had married. It had been at Mr. Thorne's\nhouse at Ullathorne, and on that day she had done a thing which she\nhad never since remembered without blushing. But it was an old story\nnow, and a story of which her companion knew nothing,--of which he\nnever could know anything. That day at Ullathorne Mrs. Arabin, the\nwife of the Dean of Barchester, than whom there was no more discreet\nclerical matron in the diocese, had--boxed a clergyman's ears!\n\n\"Yes,\" said John, speaking of Crosbie, \"he was a wise fellow; he knew\nwhat he was about; he married an earl's daughter.\"\n\n\"And now I remember hearing that somebody gave him a terrible\nbeating. Perhaps it was you?\"\n\n\"It wasn't terrible at all,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Then it was you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; it was I.\"\n\n\"Then it was you who saved poor old Lord De Guest from the bull?\"\n\n\"Go on, Mrs. Arabin. There is no end of the grand things I've done.\"\n\n\"You're quite a hero of romance.\"\n\nHe bit his lip as he told himself that he was not enough of a hero.\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Johnny. \"I think what a man ought to\ndo in these days is to seem not to care what he eats and drinks, and\nto have his linen very well got up. Then he'll be a hero.\" But that\nwas hard upon Lily.\n\n\"Is that what Miss Dale requires?\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"I was not thinking about her particularly,\" said Johnny, lying.\n\nThey slept a night in Paris, as they had done also at Turin,--Mrs.\nArabin not finding herself able to accomplish such marvels in the\nway of travelling as her companion had achieved--and then arrived\nin London in the evening. She was taken to a certain quiet clerical\nhotel at the top of Suffolk Street, much patronized by bishops and\ndeans of the better sort, expecting to find a message there from\nher husband. And there was the message--just arrived. The dean had\nreached Florence three days after her departure; and as he would do\nthe journey home in twenty-four hours less than she had taken, he\nwould be there, at the hotel, on the day after to-morrow. \"I suppose\nI may wait for him, Mr. Eames?\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"I will see Mr. Toogood to-night, and I will call here to-morrow,\nwhether I see him or not. At what hour will you be in?\"\n\n\"Don't trouble yourself to do that. You must take care of Sir Raffle\nBuffle, you know.\"\n\n\"I shan't go near Sir Raffle Buffle to-morrow, nor yet the next day.\nYou mustn't suppose that I am afraid of Sir Raffle Buffle.\"\n\n\"You are only afraid of Lily Dale.\" From all which it may be seen\nthat Mrs. Arabin and John Eames had become very intimate on their way\nhome.\n\nIt was then arranged that he should call on Mr. Toogood that same\nnight or early the next morning, and that he should come to the hotel\nat twelve o'clock on the next day. Going along one of the passages\nhe passed two gentlemen in shovel-hats, with very black new coats,\nand knee-breeches; and Johnny could not but hear a few words which\none clerical gentleman said to the other. \"She was a woman of great\nenergy, of wonderful spirit, but a firebrand, my lord,--a complete\nfirebrand!\" Then Johnny knew that the Dean of A. was talking to the\nBishop of B. about the late Mrs. Proudie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI.\n\nMR. TOOGOOD AT SILVERBRIDGE.\n\n\nWe will now go back to Mr. Toogood as he started for Silverbridge, on\nthe receipt of Mrs. Arabin's telegram from Venice. \"I gave cheque to\nMr. Crawley. It was part of a sum of money. Will write to Archdeacon\nGrantly to-day, and return home at once.\" That was the telegram\nwhich Mr. Toogood received at his office, and on receiving which he\nresolved that he must start to Barchester immediately. \"It isn't\ncertainly what you may call a paying business,\" he said to his\npartner, who continued to grumble; \"but it must be done all the same.\nIf it don't get into the ledger in one way it will in another.\" So\nMr. Toogood started for Silverbridge, having sent to his house in\nTavistock Square for a small bag, a clean shirt, and a toothbrush.\nAnd as he went down in the railway-carriage, before he went to sleep,\nhe turned it all over in his mind. \"Poor devil! I wonder whether any\nman ever suffered so much before. And as for that woman,--it's ten\nthousand pities that she should have died before she heard it. Talk\nof heart-complaint; she'd have had a touch of heart-complaint if she\nhad known this!\" Then, as he was speculating how Mrs. Arabin could\nhave become possessed of the cheque, he went to sleep.\n\nHe made up his mind that the first person to be seen was Mr. Walker,\nand after that he would, if possible, go to Archdeacon Grantly. He\nwas at first minded to go at once out to Hogglestock; but when he\nremembered how very strange Mr. Crawley was in all his ways, and\ntold himself professionally that telegrams were but bad sources of\nevidence on which to depend for details, he thought that it would be\nsafer if he were first to see Mr. Walker. There would be very little\ndelay. In a day or two the archdeacon would receive his letter, and\nin a day or two after that Mrs. Arabin would probably be at home.\n\nIt was late in the evening before Mr. Toogood reached the house of\nthe Silverbridge solicitor, having the telegram carefully folded in\nhis pocket; and he was shown into the dining-room while the servant\ntook his name up to Mr. Walker. The clerks were gone, and the office\nwas closed; and persons coming on business at such times,--as they\noften did come to that house,--were always shown into the parlour. \"I\ndon't know whether master can see you to-night,\" said the girl; \"but\nif he can, he'll come down.\"\n\nWhen the card was brought up to Mr. Walker he was sitting alone with\nhis wife. \"It's Toogood,\" said he; \"poor Crawley's cousin.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether he has found anything out,\" said Mrs. Walker.\n\"May he not come up here?\" Then Mr. Toogood was summoned into the\ndrawing-room, to the maid's astonishment; for Mr. Toogood had made no\ntoilet sacrifices to the goddess or grace who presides over evening\nsociety in provincial towns,--and presented himself with the telegram\nin his hand. \"We have found out all about poor Crawley's cheque,\" he\nsaid, before the maid-servant had closed the door. \"Look at that,\"\nand he handed the telegram to Mr. Walker. The poor girl was obliged\nto go, though she would have given one of her ears to know the exact\ncontents of that bit of paper.\n\n\"Walker, what is it?\" said his wife, before Walker had had time to\nmake the contents of the document his own.\n\n\"He got it from Mrs. Arabin,\" said Toogood.\n\n\"No!\" said Mrs. Walker. \"I thought that was it all along.\"\n\n\"It's a pity you didn't say so before,\" said Mr. Walker.\n\n\"So I did; but a lawyer thinks that nobody can ever see anything but\nhimself;--begging your pardon, Mr. Toogood, but I forgot you were one\nof us. But, Walker, do read it.\" Then the telegram was read. \"I gave\ncheque to Mr. Crawley. It was part of a sum of money,\"--with the rest\nof it. \"I knew it would come out,\" said Mrs. Walker. \"I was quite\nsure of it.\"\n\n\"But why the mischief didn't he say so?\" said Walker.\n\n\"He did say that he got it from the dean,\" said Toogood.\n\n\"But he didn't get it from the dean; and the dean clearly knew\nnothing about it.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is,\" said Mrs. Walker; \"it has been some\nprivate transaction between Mr. Crawley and Mrs. Arabin, which the\ndean was to know nothing about; and so he wouldn't tell. I must say\nI honour him.\"\n\n\"I don't think it has been that,\" said Walker. \"Had he known all\nthrough that it had come from Mrs. Arabin, he would never have said\nthat Mr. Soames gave it to him, and then that the dean gave it him.\"\n\n\"The truth has been that he has known nothing about it,\" said\nToogood; \"and we shall have to tell him.\"\n\nAt that moment Mary Walker came into the room, and Mrs. Walker could\nnot constrain herself. \"Mary, Mr. Crawley is all right. He didn't\nsteal the cheque. Mrs. Arabin gave it to him.\"\n\n\"Who says so? How do you know? Oh, dear; I am so happy, if it's\ntrue.\" Then she saw Mr. Toogood, and curtseyed.\n\n\"It is quite true, my dear,\" said Mr. Walker. \"Mr. Toogood has had a\nmessage by the wires from Mrs. Arabin at Venice. She is coming home\nat once, and no doubt everything will be put right. In the meantime,\nit may be a question whether we should not hold our tongues. Mr.\nCrawley himself, I suppose, knows nothing of it yet?\"\n\n\"Not a word,\" said Toogood.\n\n\"Papa, I must tell Miss Prettyman,\" said Mary.\n\n\"I should think that probably all Silverbridge knows it by this\ntime,\" said Mrs. Walker, \"because Jane was in the room when the\nannouncement was made. You may be sure that every servant in the\nhouse has been told.\" Mary Walker, not waiting for any further\ncommand from her father, hurried out of the room to convey the secret\nto her special circle of friends.\n\nIt was known throughout Silverbridge that night, and indeed it made\nso much commotion that it kept many people for an hour out of their\nbeds. Ladies who were not in the habit of going out late at night\nwithout the fly from the \"George and Vulture,\" tied their heads up in\ntheir handkerchiefs, and hurried up and down the street to tell each\nother that the great secret had been discovered, and that in truth\nMr. Crawley had not stolen the cheque. The solution of the mystery\nwas not known to all,--was known on that night only to the very\nselect portion of the aristocracy of Silverbridge to whom it was\ncommunicated by Mary Walker or Miss Anne Prettyman. For Mary Walker,\nwhen earnestly entreated by Jane, the parlour-maid, to tell her\nsomething more of the great news, had so far respected her father's\ncaution as to say not a word about Mrs. Arabin. \"Is it true, Miss\nMary, that he didn't steal it?\" Jane asked imploringly. \"It is true.\nHe did not steal it.\" \"And who did, Miss Mary? Indeed I won't tell\nanybody.\" \"Nobody. But don't ask any more questions, for I won't\nanswer them. Get me my hat at once, for I want to go up to Miss\nPrettyman's.\" Then Jane got Miss Walker's hat, and immediately\nafterwards scampered into the kitchen with the news. \"Oh, law, cook,\nit's all come out! Mr. Crawley's as innocent as the unborn babe. The\ngentleman upstairs what's just come, and was here once before,--for I\nknow'd him immediate,--I heard him say so. And master said so too.\"\n\n\"Did master say so his own self?\" asked the cook.\n\n\"Indeed he did; and Miss Mary told me the same this moment.\"\n\n\"If master said so, then there ain't a doubt as they'll find him\ninnocent. And who took'd it, Jane?\"\n\n\"Miss Mary says as nobody didn't steal it.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense, Jane. It stands to reason as somebody had it as\nhadn't ought to have had it. But I'm as glad as anything as how that\npoor reverend gent 'll come off;--I am. They tells me it's weeks\nsometimes before a bit of butcher's meat finds its way into his\nhouse.\" Then the groom and the housemaid and the cook, one after\nanother, took occasion to slip out of the back-door, and poor Jane,\nwho had really been the owner of the news, was left alone to answer\nthe bell.\n\nMiss Walker found the two Miss Prettymans sitting together over their\naccounts in the elder Miss Prettyman's private room. And she could\nsee at once by signs which were not unfamiliar to her that Miss\nAnne Prettyman was being scolded. It often happened that Miss Anne\nPrettyman was scolded, especially when the accounts were brought out\nupon the table. \"Sister, they are illegible,\" Mary Walker heard, as\nthe servant opened the door for her.\n\n\"I don't think it's quite so bad as that,\" said Miss Anne, unable to\nrestrain her defence. Then, as Mary entered the room, Miss Prettyman\nthe elder laid her hands down on certain books and papers as though\nto hide them from profane eyes.\n\n\"I am glad to see you, Mary,\" said Miss Prettyman, gravely.\n\n\"I've brought such a piece of news,\" said Mary. \"I knew you'd be glad\nto hear it, so I ventured to disturb you.\"\n\n\"Is it good news?\" said Anne Prettyman.\n\n\"Very good news. Mr. Crawley is innocent.\"\n\nBoth the ladies sprung on to their legs. Even Miss Prettyman\nherself jumped up on to her legs. \"No!\" said Anne. \"Your father has\ndiscovered it?\" said Miss Prettyman.\n\n\"Not exactly that. Mr. Toogood has come down from London to tell him.\nMr. Toogood, you know, is Mr. Crawley's cousin; and he is a lawyer,\nlike papa.\" It may be observed that ladies belonging to the families\nof solicitors always talk about lawyers, and never about attorneys or\nbarristers.\n\n\"And does Mr. Toogood say that Mr. Crawley is innocent?\" asked Miss\nPrettyman.\n\n\"He has heard it by a message from Mrs. Arabin. But you mustn't\nmention this. You won't, please, because papa has asked me not. I\ntold him that I should tell you.\" Then, for the first time, the frown\npassed away entirely from Miss Prettyman's face, and the papers and\naccount-books were pushed aside, as being of no moment. The news had\nbeen momentous enough to satisfy her. Mary continued her story almost\nin a whisper. \"It was Mrs. Arabin who sent the cheque to Mr. Crawley.\nShe says so herself. So that makes Mr. Crawley quite innocent. I am\nso glad.\"\n\n\"But isn't it odd he didn't say so?\" said Miss Prettyman.\n\n\"Nevertheless, it's true,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Perhaps he forgot,\" said Anne Prettyman.\n\n\"Men don't forget such things as that,\" said the elder sister.\n\n\"I really do think Mr. Crawley could forget anything,\" said the\nyounger sister.\n\n\"You may be sure it's true,\" said Mary Walker, \"because papa said\nso.\"\n\n\"If he said so, it must be true,\" said Miss Prettyman; \"and I am\nrejoiced. I really am rejoiced. Poor man! Poor ill-used man! And\nnobody has ever believed that he has really been guilty, even though\nthey may have thought that he spent the money without any proper\nright to it. And now he will get off. But dear me, Mary, Mr. Smithe\ntold me yesterday that he had already given up his living, and that\nMr. Spooner, the minor canon, was trying to get it from the dean. But\nthat was because Mr. Spooner and Mrs. Proudie had quarrelled; and\nas Mrs. Proudie is gone, Mr. Spooner very likely won't want to move\nnow.\"\n\n\"They'll never go and put anybody into Hogglestock, Annabella, over\nMr. Crawley's head,\" said Anne.\n\n\"I didn't say that they would. Surely I may be allowed to repeat what\nI hear, like another person, without being snapped up.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to snap you up, Annabella.\"\n\n\"You're always snapping me up. But if this is true, I cannot say\nhow glad I am. My poor Grace! Now, I suppose, there will be no\ndifficulty, and Grace will become a great lady.\" Then they discussed\nvery minutely the chances of Grace Crawley's promotion.\n\nJohn Walker, Mr. Winthrop, and several others of the chosen spirits\nof Silverbridge, were playing whist at a provincial club, which had\nestablished itself in the town, when the news was brought to them.\nThough Mr. Winthrop was the partner of the great Walker, and though\nJohn Walker was the great man's son, I fear that the news reached\ntheir ears in but an underhand sort of way. As for the great man\nhimself, he never went near the club, preferring his slippers and\ntea at home. The Walkerian groom, rushing up the street to the\n\"George and Vulture,\" paused a moment to tell his tidings to the club\nporter; from the club porter it was whispered respectfully to the\nSilverbridge apothecary, who, by special grace, was a member of the\nclub;--and was by him repeated with much cautious solemnity over the\ncard-table. \"Who told you that, Balsam?\" said John Walker, throwing\ndown his cards.\n\n\"I've just heard it,\" said Balsam.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said John.\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if it's true,\" said Winthrop. \"I always said that\nsomething would turn up.\"\n\n\"Will you bet three to one he is not found guilty?\" said John Walker.\n\n\"Done,\" said Winthrop; \"in pounds.\" That morning the odds in the club\nagainst the event had been only two to one. But as the matter was\ndiscussed, the men in the club began to believe the tidings, and\nbefore he went home, John Walker would have been glad to hedge his\nbet on any terms. After he had spoken to his father, he gave his\nmoney up for lost.\n\nBut Mr. Walker,--the great Walker,--had more to do that night before\nhis son came home from the club. He and Mr. Toogood agreed that it\nwould be right that they should see Dr. Tempest at once, and they\nwent over together to the rectory. It was past ten at this time, and\nthey found the doctor almost in the act of putting out the candles\nfor the night. \"I could not but come to you, doctor,\" said Mr.\nWalker, \"with the news my friend has brought. Mrs. Arabin gave the\ncheque to Crawley. Here is a telegram from her saying so.\" And the\ntelegram was handed to the doctor.\n\nHe stood perfectly silent for a few minutes, reading it over and over\nagain. \"I see it all,\" he said, when he spoke at last. \"I see it all\nnow; and I must own I was never before so much puzzled in my life.\"\n\n\"I own I can't see why she should have given him Mr. Soames's\ncheque,\" said Mr. Walker.\n\n\"I can't say where she got it, and I own I don't much care,\" said Dr.\nTempest. \"But I don't doubt but what she gave it him without telling\nthe dean, and that Crawley thought it came from the dean. I'm very\nglad. I am, indeed, very glad. I do not know that I ever pitied a man\nso much in my life as I have pitied Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"It must have been a hard case when it has moved him,\" said Mr.\nWalker to Mr. Toogood as they left the clergyman's house; and then\nthe Silverbridge attorney saw the attorney from London home to his\ninn.\n\nIt was the general opinion at Silverbridge that the news from Venice\nought to be communicated to the Crawleys by Major Grantly. Mary\nWalker had expressed this opinion very strongly, and her mother had\nagreed with her. Miss Prettyman also felt that poetical justice, or,\nat least, the romance of justice, demanded this; and, as she told her\nsister Anne after Mary Walker left her, she was of opinion that such\nan arrangement might tend to make things safe. \"I do think he is an\nhonest man and a fine fellow,\" said Miss Prettyman; \"but, my dear,\nyou know what the proverb says, 'There's many a slip 'twixt the cup\nand the lip.'\" Miss Prettyman thought that anything which might be\ndone to prevent a slip ought to be done. The idea that the pleasant\ntask of taking the news out to Hogglestock ought to be confided to\nMajor Grantly was very general; but then Mr. Walker was of opinion\nthat the news ought not to be taken to Hogglestock at all till\nsomething more certain than the telegram had reached them. Early on\nthe following morning the two lawyers again met, and it was arranged\nbetween them that the London lawyer should go over at once to\nBarchester, and that the Silverbridge lawyer should see Major\nGrantly. Mr. Toogood was still of opinion that with due diligence\nsomething might yet be learned as to the cheque, by inquiry among the\ndenizens of \"The Dragon of Wantly;\" and his opinion to this effect\nwas stronger than ever when he learned from Mr. Walker that \"The\nDragon of Wantly\" belonged to Mrs. Arabin.\n\nMr. Walker, after breakfast, had himself driven up in his open\ncarriage to Cosby Lodge, and, as he entered the gates, observed that\nthe auctioneer's bills as to the sale had been pulled down. The\nMr. Walkers of the world know everything, and our Mr. Walker had\nquite understood that the major was leaving Cosby Lodge because\nof some misunderstanding with his father. The exact nature of the\nmisunderstanding he did not know, even though he was Mr. Walker, but\nhad little doubt that it referred in some way to Grace Crawley. If\nthe archdeacon's objection to Grace arose from the imputation against\nthe father, that objection would now be removed, but the abolition of\nthe posters could not as yet have been owing to any such cause as\nthat. Mr. Walker found the major at the gate of the farmyard attached\nto Cosby Lodge, and perceived that at that very moment he was engaged\nin superintending the abolition of sundry other auctioneer's bills\nfrom sundry other posts. \"What is all this about?\" said Mr. Walker,\ngreeting the major. \"Is there to be no sale after all?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"No sale after all?\"]\n\n\"It has been postponed,\" said the major.\n\n\"Postponed for good, I hope? Bill to be read again this day six\nmonths!\" said Mr. Walker.\n\n\"I rather think not. But circumstances have induced me to have it put\noff.\"\n\nMr. Walker had got out of the carriage and had taken Major Grantly\naside. \"Just come a little further,\" he said; \"I've something special\nto tell you. News reached me last night which will clear Mr. Crawley\naltogether. We know now where he got the cheque.\"\n\n\"You don't tell me so!\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. And though the news has reached us in such a way that we\ncannot act upon it till it's confirmed, I do not in the least doubt\nit.\"\n\n\"And how did he get it?\"\n\n\"You cannot guess?\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said the major; \"unless, after all, Soames gave\nit to him.\"\n\n\"Soames did not give it to him, but Mrs. Arabin did.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Arabin?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mrs. Arabin.\"\n\n\"Not the dean?\"\n\n\"No, not the dean. What we know is this, that your aunt has\ntelegraphed to Crawley's cousin, Toogood, to say that she gave\nCrawley that cheque, and that she has written to your father about it\nat length. We do not like to tell Crawley till that letter has been\nreceived. It is so easy, you know, to misunderstand a telegram, and\nthe wrong copying of a word may make such a mistake!\"\n\n\"When was it received?\"\n\n\"Toogood received it in London only yesterday morning. Your father\nwill not get his letter, as I calculate, till the day after\nto-morrow. But, perhaps, you had better go over and see him, and\nprepare him for it. Toogood has gone to Barchester this morning.\"\nTo this proposition Grantly made no immediate answer. He could not\nbut remember the terms on which he had left his father; and though\nhe had, most unwillingly, pulled down the auctioneer's bills, in\ncompliance with his mother's last prayer to him,--and, indeed,\nhad angrily told the auctioneer to send him in his bill when the\nauctioneer had demurred to these proceedings,--nevertheless he was\nhardly prepared to discuss the matter of Mr. Crawley with his father\nin pleasant words,--in words which should be full of rejoicing. It\nwas a great thing for him, Henry Grantly, that Mr. Crawley should\nbe innocent, and he did rejoice; but he had intended his father to\nunderstand that he meant to persevere, whether Mr. Crawley were\ninnocent or guilty, and thus he would now lose an opportunity for\nexhibiting his obstinacy,--an opportunity which had not been without\na charm for him. He must console himself as best he might with the\nreturning prospect of assured prosperity, and with his renewed hopes\nas to the Plumstead foxes! \"We think, major, that when the time\ncomes you ought to be the bearer of the news to Hogglestock,\" said\nMr. Walker. Then the major did undertake to convey the news to\nHogglestock, but he made no promise as to going over to Plumstead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII.\n\nMR. TOOGOOD AT \"THE DRAGON OF WANTLY.\"\n\n\nIn accordance with his arrangement with Mr. Walker, Mr. Toogood went\nover to Barchester early in the morning and put himself up at \"The\nDragon of Wantly.\" He now knew the following facts: that Mr. Soames,\nwhen he lost his cheque, had had with him one of the servants from\nthat inn,--that the man who had been with Mr. Soames had gone to New\nZealand,--that the cheque had found its way into the hands of Mrs.\nArabin, and that Mrs. Arabin was the owner of the inn in question.\nSo much he believed to be within his knowledge, and if his knowledge\nshould prove to be correct, his work would be done as far as Mr.\nCrawley was concerned. If Mr. Crawley had not stolen the cheque, and\nif that could be proved, it would be a question of no great moment to\nMr. Toogood who had stolen it. But he was a sportsman in his own line\nwho liked to account for his own fox. As he was down at Barchester,\nhe thought that he might as well learn how the cheque had got into\nMrs. Arabin's hands. No doubt that for her own personal possession of\nit she would be able to account on her return. Probably such account\nwould be given in her first letter home. But it might be well that\nhe should be prepared with any small circumstantial details which he\nmight be able to pick up at the inn.\n\nHe reached Barchester before breakfast, and in ordering his tea and\ntoast, reminded the old waiter with the dirty towel of his former\nacquaintance with him. \"I remember you, sir,\" said the old waiter.\n\"I remember you very well. You was asking questions about the cheque\nwhich Mr. Soames lost afore Christmas.\" Mr. Toogood certainly had\nasked one question on the subject. He had inquired whether a certain\nman who had gone to New Zealand had been the post-boy who accompanied\nMr. Soames when the cheque was lost; and the waiter had professed to\nknow nothing about Mr. Soames or the cheque. He now perceived at once\nthat the gist of the question had remained on the old man's mind, and\nthat he was recognized as being in some way connected with the lost\nmoney.\n\n\"Did I? Ah, yes; I think I did. And I think you told me that he was\nthe man?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I never told you that.\"\n\n\"Then you told me that he wasn't.\"\n\n\"Nor I didn't tell you that neither,\" said the waiter angrily.\n\n\"Then what the devil did you tell me?\" To this further question the\nwaiter sulkily declined to give any answer, and soon afterwards left\nthe room. Toogood, as soon as he had done his breakfast, rang the\nbell, and the same man appeared. \"Will you tell Mr. Stringer that I\nshould be glad to see him if he's disengaged,\" said Mr. Toogood. \"I\nknow he's bad with the gout, and therefore if he'll allow me, I'll go\nto him instead of his coming to me.\" Mr. Stringer was the landlord\nof the inn. The waiter hesitated a moment, and then declared that\nto the best of his belief his master was not down. He would go and\nsee. Toogood, however, would not wait for that; but rising quickly\nand passing the waiter, crossed the hall from the coffee-room, and\nentered what was called the bar. The bar was a small room connected\nwith the hall by a large open window, at which orders for rooms were\ngiven and cash was paid, and glasses of beer were consumed,--and a\ngood deal of miscellaneous conversation was carried on. The barmaid\nwas here at the window, and there was also, in a corner of the room,\na man at a desk with a red nose. Toogood knew that the man at the\ndesk with the red nose was Mr. Stringer's clerk. So much he had\nlearned in his former rummaging about the inn. And he also remembered\nat this moment that he had observed the man with the red nose\nstanding under a narrow archway in the close as he was coming out of\nthe deanery, on the occasion of his visit to Mr. Harding. It had not\noccurred to him then that the man with the red nose was watching him,\nbut it did occur to him now that the man with the red nose had been\nthere, under the arch, with the express purpose of watching him on\nthat occasion. Mr. Toogood passed quickly through the bar into an\ninner parlour, in which was sitting Mr. Stringer, the landlord,\npropped among his cushions. Toogood, as he had entered the hotel, had\nseen Mr. Stringer so placed, through the two doors, which at that\nmoment had both happened to be open. He knew therefore that his old\nfriend the waiter had not been quite true to him in suggesting that\nhis master was not as yet down. As Toogood cast a glance of his eye\non the man with the red nose, he told himself the old story of the\napparition under the archway.\n\n\"Mr. Stringer,\" said Mr. Toogood to the landlord, \"I hope I'm not\nintruding.\"\n\n\"O dear, no, sir,\" said the forlorn man. \"Nobody ever intrudes coming\nin here. I'm always happy to see gentlemen,--only, mostly, I'm so bad\nwith the gout.\"\n\n\"Have you got a sharp touch of it just now, Mr. Stringer?\"\n\n\"Not just to-day, sir. I've been a little easier since Saturday. The\nworst of this burst is over. But Lord bless you, sir, it don't leave\nme,--not for a fortnight at a time, now; it don't. And it ain't what\nI drink, nor it ain't what I eat.\"\n\n\"Constitutional, I suppose?\" said Toogood.\n\n\"Look here, sir;\" and Mr. Stringer shewed his visitor the chalk\nstones in all his knuckles. \"They say I'm all a mass of chalk. I\nsometimes think they'll break me up to mark the scores behind my own\ndoor with.\" And Mr. Stringer laughed at his own wit.\n\nMr. Toogood laughed too. He laughed loud and cheerily. And then he\nasked a sudden question, keeping his eye as he did so upon a little\nsquare open window, which communicated between the landlord's private\nroom and the bar. Through this small aperture he could see as he\nstood a portion of the hat worn by the man with the red nose. Since\nhe had been in the room with the landlord, the man with the red nose\nhad moved his head twice, on each occasion drawing himself closer\ninto his corner; but Mr. Toogood, by moving also, had still contrived\nto keep a morsel of the hat in sight. He laughed cheerily at the\nlandlord's joke, and then he asked a sudden question,--looking well\nat the morsel of the hat as he did so. \"Mr. Stringer,\" said he,\n\"how do you pay your rent, and to whom do you pay it?\" There was\nimmediately a jerk in the hat, and then it disappeared. Toogood,\nstepping to the open door, saw that the red-nosed clerk had taken his\nhat off and was very busy at his accounts.\n\n\"How do I pay my rent?\" said Mr. Stringer, the landlord. \"Well, sir,\nsince this cursed gout has been so bad, it's hard enough to pay it at\nall sometimes. You ain't sent here to look for it, sir, are you?\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said Toogood. \"It was only a chance question.\" He felt\nthat he had nothing more to do with Mr. Stringer, the landlord. Mr.\nStringer, the landlord, knew nothing about Mr. Soames's cheque.\n\"What's the name of your clerk?\" said he.\n\n\"The name of my clerk?\" said Mr. Stringer. \"Why do you want to know\nthe name of my clerk?\"\n\n\"Does he ever pay your rent for you?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; he does, at times. He pays it into the bank for the\nlady as owns the house. Is there any reason for your asking these\nquestions, sir? It isn't usual, you know, for a stranger, sir.\"\n\nToogood during the whole of this time was standing with his eye\nupon the red-nosed man, and the red-nosed man could not move. The\nred-nosed man heard all the questions and the landlord's answers, and\ncould not even pretend that he did not hear them. \"I am my cousin's\nclerk,\" said he, putting on his hat, and coming up to Mr. Toogood\nwith a swagger. \"My name is Dan Stringer, and I'm Mr. John Stringer's\ncousin. I've lived with Mr. John Stringer for twelve year and more,\nand I'm a'most as well known in Barchester as himself. Have you\nanything to say to me, sir?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; I have,\" said Toogood.\n\n\"I believe you're one of them attorneys from London?\" said Mr. Dan\nStringer.\n\n\"That's true. I am an attorney from London.\"\n\n\"I hope there's nothing wrong?\" said the gouty man, trying to get off\nhis chair, but not succeeding. \"If there is anything wronger than\nusual, Dan, do tell me. Is there anything wrong, sir?\" and the\nlandlord appealed piteously to Mr. Toogood.\n\n\"Never you mind, John,\" said Dan. \"You keep yourself quiet, and don't\nanswer none of his questions. He's one of them low sort, he is. I\nknow him. I knowed him for what he is directly I saw him. Ferreting\nabout,--that's his game; to see if there's anything to be got.\"\n\n\"But what is he ferreting here for?\" said Mr. John Stringer.\n\n\"I'm ferreting for Mr. Soames's cheque for twenty pounds,\" said Mr.\nToogood.\n\n\"That's the cheque that the parson stole,\" said Dan Stringer. \"He's\nto be tried for it at the 'sizes.\"\n\n\"You've heard about Mr. Soames and his cheque, and about Mr. Crawley,\nI daresay?\" said Toogood.\n\n\"I've heard a deal about them,\" said the landlord.\n\n\"And so, I daresay, have you?\" said Toogood, turning to Dan Stringer.\nBut Dan Stringer did not seem inclined to carry on the conversation\nany further. When he was hardly pressed, he declared that he just had\nheard that there was some parson in trouble about a sum of money; but\nthat he knew no more about it than that. He didn't know whether it\nwas a cheque or a note that the parson had taken, and had never been\nsufficiently interested in the matter to make any inquiry.\n\n\"But you've just said that Mr. Soames's cheque was the cheque the\nparson stole,\" said the astonished landlord, turning with open eyes\nupon his cousin.\n\n\"You be blowed,\" said Dan Stringer, the clerk, to Mr. John Stringer,\nthe landlord; and then walked out of the room back to the bar.\n\n\"I understand nothing about it,--nothing at all,\" said the gouty man.\n\n\"I understand pretty nearly all about it,\" said Mr. Toogood,\nfollowing the red-nosed clerk. There was no necessity that he should\ntrouble the landlord any further. He left the room, and went through\nthe bar, and as he passed out along the hall, he found Dan Stringer\nwith his hat on talking to the waiter. The waiter immediately pulled\nhimself up, and adjusted his dirty napkin under his arm, after the\nfashion of waiters, and showed that he intended to be civil to the\ncustomers of the house. But he of the red nose cocked his hat, and\nlooked with insolence at Mr. Toogood, and defied him. \"There's\nnothing I do hate so much as them low-bred Old Bailey attorneys,\"\nsaid Mr. Dan Stringer to the waiter, in a voice intended to reach Mr.\nToogood's ears. Then Mr. Toogood told himself that Dan Stringer was\nnot the thief himself, and that it might be very difficult to prove\nthat Dan had even been the receiver of stolen goods. He had, however,\nno doubt in his own mind but that such was the case.\n\nHe first went to the police office, and there explained his business.\nNobody at the police office pretended to forget Mr. Soames's cheque,\nor Mr. Crawley's position. The constable went so far as to swear that\nthere wasn't a man, woman, or child in all Barchester who was not\ntalking of Mr. Crawley at that very moment. Then Mr. Toogood went\nwith the constable to the private house of the mayor, and had a\nlittle conversation with the mayor. \"Not guilty!\" said the mayor,\nwith incredulity, when he first heard the news about Crawley. But\nwhen he heard Mr. Toogood's story, or as much of it as it was\nnecessary that he should hear, he yielded reluctantly. \"Dear, dear!\"\nhe said. \"I'd have bet anything 'twas he who stole it.\" And after\nthat the mayor was quite sad. Only let us think what a comfortable\nexcitement it would create throughout England if it was surmised that\nan archbishop had forged a deed; and how much England would lose when\nit was discovered that the archbishop was innocent! As the archbishop\nand his forgery would be to England, so was Mr. Crawley and the\ncheque for twenty pounds to Barchester and its mayor. Nevertheless,\nthe mayor promised his assistance to Mr. Toogood.\n\nMr. Toogood, still neglecting his red-nosed friend, went next to the\ndeanery, hoping that he might again see Mr. Harding. Mr. Harding\nwas, he was told, too ill to be seen. Mr. Harding, Mrs. Baxter said,\ncould never be seen now by strangers, nor yet by friends, unless they\nwere very old friends. \"There's been a deal of change since you were\nhere last, sir. I remember your coming, sir. You were talking to Mr.\nHarding about the poor clergyman as is to be tried.\" He did not stop\nto tell Mrs. Baxter the whole story of Mr. Crawley's innocence; but\nhaving learned that a message had been received to say that Mrs.\nArabin would be home on the next Tuesday,--this being Friday,--he\ntook his leave of Mrs. Baxter. His next visit was to Mr. Soames, who\nlived three miles out in the country.\n\nHe found it very difficult to convince Mr. Soames. Mr. Soames was\nmore staunch in his belief of Mr. Crawley's guilt than any one whom\nToogood had yet encountered. \"I never took the cheque out of his\nhouse,\" said Mr. Soames. \"But you have not stated that on oath,\" said\nMr. Toogood. \"No,\" rejoined the other; \"and I never will. I can't\nswear to it; but yet I'm sure of it.\" He acknowledged that he had\nbeen driven by a man named Scuttle, and that Scuttle might have\npicked up the cheque, if it had been dropped in the gig. But the\ncheque had not been dropped in the gig. The cheque had been dropped\nin Mr. Crawley's house. \"Why did he say then that I paid it to him?\"\nsaid Mr. Soames, when Mr. Toogood spoke confidently of Crawley's\ninnocence. \"Ah, why indeed?\" answered Toogood. \"If he had not been\nfool enough to do that, we should have been saved all this trouble.\nAll the same, he did not steal your money, Mr. Soames; and Jem\nScuttle did steal it. Unfortunately, Jem Scuttle is in New Zealand by\nthis time.\" \"Of course, it is possible,\" said Mr. Soames, as he bowed\nMr. Toogood out. Mr. Soames did not like Mr. Toogood.\n\nThat evening a gentleman with a red nose asked at the Barchester\nstation for a second-class ticket for London by the up night-mail\ntrain. He was well known at the station, and the station-master made\nsome little inquiry. \"All the way to London to-night, Mr. Stringer?\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Yes,--all the way,\" said the red-nosed man, sulkily.\n\n\"I don't think you'd better go to London to-night, Mr. Stringer,\"\nsaid a tall man, stepping out of the door of the booking-office. \"I\nthink you'd better come back with me to Barchester. I do indeed.\"\nThere was some little argument on the occasion; but the stranger, who\nwas a detective policeman, carried his point, and Mr. Dan Stringer\ndid return to Barchester.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\n\nTHERE IS COMFORT AT PLUMSTEAD.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHenry Grantly had written the following short letter to Mrs. Grantly\nwhen he made up his mind to pull down the auctioneer's bills.\n\n\n   DEAR MOTHER,--\n\n   I have postponed the sale, not liking to refuse you\n   anything. As far as I can see, I shall still be forced to\n   leave Cosby Lodge, as I certainly shall do all I can to\n   make Grace Crawley my wife. I say this that there may be\n   no misunderstanding with my father. The auctioneer has\n   promised to have the bills removed.\n\n   Your affectionate son,\n\n   HENRY GRANTLY.\n\n\nThis had been written by the major on the Friday before Mr. Walker\nhad brought up to him the tidings of Mr. Toogood and Mrs. Arabin's\nsolution of the Crawley difficulty; but it did not reach Plumstead\ntill the following morning. Mrs. Grantly immediately took the good\nnews about the sale to her husband,--not of course showing him the\nletter, being far too wise for that, and giving him credit for being\ntoo wise to ask for it. \"Henry has arranged with the auctioneer,\" she\nsaid joyfully; \"and the bills have been all pulled down.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I've just heard from him. He has told me so. Come, my dear, let me\nhave the pleasure of hearing you say that things shall be pleasant\nagain between you and him. He has yielded.\"\n\n\"I don't see much yielding in it.\"\n\n\"He has done what you wanted. What more can he do?\"\n\n\"I want him to come over here, and take an interest in things, and\nnot treat me as though I were nobody.\" Within an hour of this the\nmajor had arrived at Plumstead, laden with the story of Mrs. Arabin\nand the cheque, and of Mr. Crawley's innocence,--laden not only\nwith such tidings as he had received from Mr. Walker, but also with\nfurther details, which he had received from Mr. Toogood. For he\nhad come through Barchester, and had seen Mr. Toogood on his way.\nThis was on the Saturday morning, and he had breakfasted with Mr.\nToogood at \"The Dragon of Wantly.\" Mr. Toogood had told him of his\nsuspicions,--how the red-nosed man had been stopped, and had been\nsummoned as a witness for Mr. Crawley's trial,--and how he was now\nunder the surveillance of the police. Grantly had not cared very much\nabout the red-nosed man, confining his present solicitude to the\nquestion whether Grace Crawley's father would certainly be shown to\nhave been innocent of the theft. \"There's not a doubt about it,\nmajor,\" said Mr. Toogood; \"not a doubt on earth. But we'd better be a\nlittle quiet till your aunt comes home,--just a little quiet. She'll\nbe here in a day or two, and I won't budge till she comes.\" In spite\nof his desire for quiescence Mr. Toogood consented to a revelation\nbeing at once made to the archdeacon and Mrs. Grantly. \"And I'll tell\nyou what, major; as soon as ever Mrs. Arabin is here, and has given\nus her own word to act on, you and I will go over to Hogglestock and\nastonish them. I should like to go myself, because, you see, Mrs.\nCrawley is my cousin, and we have taken a little trouble about this\nmatter.\" To this the major assented; but he altogether declined to\nassist in Mr. Toogood's speculations respecting the unfortunate Dan\nStringer. It was agreed between them that for the present no visit\nshould be made to the palace, as it was thought that Mr. Thumble had\nbetter be allowed to do the Hogglestock duties on the next Sunday.\nAs matters went, however, Mr. Thumble did not do so. He had paid his\nlast visit to Hogglestock.\n\nIt may be as well to explain here that the unfortunate Mr. Snapper\nwas constrained to go out to Hogglestock on the Sunday which was now\napproaching,--which fell out as follows. It might be all very well\nfor Mr. Toogood to arrange that he would not tell this person or that\nperson of the news which he had brought down from London; but as he\nhad told various people in Silverbridge, as he had told Mr. Soames,\nand as he had told the police at Barchester, of course the tale found\nits way to the palace. Mr. Thumble heard it, and having come by this\ntime thoroughly to hate Hogglestock and all that belonged to it, he\npleaded to Mr. Snapper that this report afforded ample reason why he\nneed not again visit that detestable parish. Mr. Snapper did not see\nit in the same light. \"You may be sure Mr. Crawley will not get into\nthe pulpit after his resignation, Mr. Thumble,\" said he.\n\n\"His resignation means nothing,\" said Thumble.\n\n\"It means a great deal,\" said Snapper; \"and the duties must be\nprovided for.\"\n\n\"I won't provide for them,\" said Thumble; \"and so you may tell the\nbishop.\" In these days Mr. Thumble was very angry with the bishop,\nfor the bishop had not yet seen him since the death of Mrs. Proudie.\n\nMr. Snapper had no alternative but to go to the bishop. The bishop\nin these days was very mild to those whom he saw, given but to few\nwords, and a little astray,--as though he had had one of his limbs\ncut off,--as Mr. Snapper expressed it to Mrs. Snapper. \"I shouldn't\nwonder if he felt as though all his limbs were cut off,\" said Mrs.\nSnapper; \"you must give him time, and he'll come round by-and-by.\"\nI am inclined to think that Mrs. Snapper's opinion of the bishop's\nfeelings and condition was correct. In his difficulty respecting\nHogglestock and Mr. Thumble Mr. Snapper went to the bishop, and spoke\nperhaps a little harshly of Mr. Thumble.\n\n\"I think, upon the whole, Snapper, that you had better go yourself,\"\nsaid the bishop.\n\n\"Do you think so, my lord?\" said Snapper. \"It will be inconvenient.\"\n\n\"Everything is inconvenient; but you'd better go. And look here,\nSnapper, if I were you, I wouldn't say anything out at Hogglestock\nabout the cheque. We don't know what it may come to yet.\" Mr.\nSnapper, with a heavy heart, left his patron, not at all liking the\ntask that was before him. But his wife encouraged him to be obedient.\nHe was the owner of a one-horse carriage, and the work was not,\ntherefore, so hard to him as it would have been and had been to poor\nMr. Thumble. And, moreover, his wife promised to go with him. Mr.\nSnapper and Mrs. Snapper did go over to Hogglestock, and the duty\nwas done. Mrs. Snapper spoke a word or two to Mrs. Crawley, and Mr.\nSnapper spoke a word or two to Mr. Crawley; but not a word was said\nabout the new news as to Mr. Soames's cheque, which were now almost\ncurrent in Barchester. Indeed, no whisper about it had as yet reached\nHogglestock.\n\n\"One word with you, reverend sir,\" said Mr. Crawley to the chaplain,\nas the latter was coming out of the church, \"as to the parish work,\nsir, during the week;--I should be glad if you would favour me with\nyour opinion.\"\n\n\"About what, Mr. Crawley?\"\n\n\"Whether you think that I may be allowed, without scandal, to visit\nthe sick,--and to give instruction in the school.\"\n\n\"Surely;--surely, Mr. Crawley. Why not?\"\n\n\"Mr. Thumble gave me to understand that the bishop was very\nurgent that I should interfere in no way in the ministrations\nof the parish. Twice did he enjoin on me that I should not\ninterfere,--unnecessarily, as it seemed to me.\"\n\n\"Quite unnecessary,\" said Mr. Snapper. \"And the bishop will be\nobliged to you, Mr. Crawley, if you'll just see that the things go on\nall straight.\"\n\n\"I wish it were possible to know with accuracy what his idea of\nstraightness is,\" said Mr. Crawley to his wife. \"It may be that\nthings are straight to him when they are buried as it were out of\nsight, and put away without trouble. I hope it be not so with the\nbishop.\" When he went into his school and remembered,--as he did\nremember through every minute of his teaching--that he was to receive\nno portion of the poor stipend which was allotted for the clerical\nduties of the parish, he told himself that there was gross injustice\nin the way in which things were being made straight at Hogglestock.\n\nBut we must go back to the major and to the archdeacon at\nPlumstead,--in which comfortable parish things were generally made\nstraight more easily than at Hogglestock. Henry Grantly went over\nfrom Barchester to Plumstead in a gig from the \"Dragon,\" and made\nhis way at once into his father's study. The archdeacon was seated\nthere with sundry manuscripts before him, and with one half-finished\nmanuscript,--as was his wont on every Saturday morning. \"Halloo,\nHarry,\" he said. \"I didn't expect you in the least.\" It was barely an\nhour since he had told Mrs. Grantly that his complaint against his\nson was that he wouldn't come and make himself comfortable at the\nrectory.\n\n\"Father,\" said he, giving the archdeacon his hand, \"you have heard\nnothing yet about Mr. Crawley?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the archdeacon jumping up; \"nothing new;--what is it?\"\nMany ideas about Mr. Crawley at that moment flitted across the\narchdeacon's mind. Could it be that the unfortunate man had committed\nsuicide, overcome by his troubles?\n\n\"It has all come out. He got the cheque from my aunt.\"\n\n\"From your aunt Eleanor?\"\n\n\"Yes; from my aunt Eleanor. She has telegraphed over from Venice\nto say that she gave the identical cheque to Crawley. That is all\nwe know at present,--except that she has written an account of the\nmatter to you, and that she will be here herself as quick as she can\ncome.\"\n\n\"Who got the message, Henry?\"\n\n\"Crawley's lawyer,--a fellow named Toogood, a cousin of his\nwife's;--a very decent fellow,\" added the major, remembering how\nnecessary it was that he should reconcile his father to all the\nCrawley belongings. \"He's to be over here on Monday, and then will\narrange what is to be done.\"\n\n\"Done in what way, Henry?\"\n\n\"There's a great deal to be done yet. Crawley does not know himself\nat this moment how the cheque got into his hands. He must be told,\nand something must be settled about the living. They've taken the\nliving away from him among them. And then the indictment must be\nquashed, or something of that kind done. Toogood has got hold of the\nscoundrel at Barchester who really stole the cheque from Soames;--or\nthinks that he has. It's that Dan Stringer.\"\n\n\"He's got hold of a regular scamp then. I never knew any good of Dan\nStringer,\" said the archdeacon.\n\nThen Mrs. Grantly was told, and the whole story was repeated again,\nwith many expressions of commiseration in reference to all the\nCrawleys. The archdeacon did not join in these at first, being rather\nshy on that head. It was very hard for him to have to speak to his\nson about the Crawleys as though they were people in all respects\nestimable and well-conducted, and satisfactory. Mrs. Grantly\nunderstood this so well, that every now and then she said some\nhalf-laughing word respecting Mr. Crawley's peculiarities, feeling\nthat in this way she might ease her husband's difficulties. \"He must\nbe the oddest man that ever lived,\" said Mrs. Grantly, \"not to have\nknown where he got the cheque.\" The archdeacon shook his head, and\nrubbed his hands as he walked about the room. \"I suppose too much\nlearning has upset him,\" said the archdeacon. \"They say he's not very\ngood at talking English, but put him on in Greek and he never stops.\"\n\nThe archdeacon was perfectly aware that he had to admit Mr. Crawley\nto his goodwill, and that as for Grace Crawley,--it was essentially\nnecessary that she should be admitted to his heart of hearts. He had\npromised as much. It must be acknowledged that Archdeacon Grantly\nalways kept his promises, and especially such promises as these. And\nindeed it was the nature of the man that when he had been very angry\nwith those he loved, he should be unhappy until he had found some\nescape from his anger. He could not endure to have to own himself\nto have been in the wrong, but he could be content with a very\nincomplete recognition of his having been in the right. The posters\nhad been pulled down and Mr. Crawley, as he was now told, had not\nstolen the cheque. That was sufficient. If his son would only drink\na glass or two of wine with him comfortably, and talk dutifully\nabout the Plumstead foxes, all should be held to be right, and\nGrace Crawley should be received with lavish paternal embraces. The\narchdeacon had kissed Grace once, and felt that he could do so again\nwithout an unpleasant strain upon his feelings.\n\n\"Say something to your father about the property after dinner,\" said\nMrs. Grantly to her son when they were alone together.\n\n\"About what property?\"\n\n\"About this property, or any property; you know what I\nmean;--something to show that you are interested about his affairs.\nHe is doing the best he can to make things right.\" After dinner, over\nthe claret, Mr. Thorne's terrible sin in reference to the trapping\nof foxes was accordingly again brought up, and the archdeacon became\nbeautifully irate, and expressed his animosity,--which he did not in\nthe least feel,--against an old friend with an energy which would\nhave delighted his wife, if she could have heard him. \"I shall tell\nThorne my mind, certainly. He and I are very old friends; we have\nknown each other all our lives; but I cannot put up with this kind\nof thing,--and I will not. It's all because he's afraid of his own\ngamekeeper.\" And yet the archdeacon had never ridden after a fox in\nhis life, and never meant to do so. Nor had he in truth been always\nso very anxious that foxes should be found in his covers. That fox\nwhich had been so fortunately trapped just outside the Plumstead\nproperty afforded a most pleasant escape for the steam of his anger.\nWhen he began to talk to his wife that evening about Mr. Thorne's\nwicked gamekeeper, she was so sure that all was right, that she said\na word of her extreme desire to see Grace Crawley.\n\n\"If he is to marry her, we might as well have her over here,\" said\nthe archdeacon.\n\n\"That's just what I was thinking,\" said Mrs. Grantly. And thus things\nat the rectory got themselves arranged.\n\nOn the Sunday morning the expected letter from Venice came to\nhand, and was read on that morning very anxiously, not only by Mrs.\nGrantly and the major, but by the archdeacon also, in spite of the\nsanctity of the day. Indeed the archdeacon had been very stoutly\nanti-sabbatarial when the question of stopping the Sunday post to\nPlumstead had been mooted in the village, giving those who on that\noccasion were the special friends of the postman to understand that\nhe considered them to be numskulls, and little better than idiots.\nThe postman, finding the parson to be against him, had seen that\nthere was no chance for him, and had allowed the matter to drop. Mrs.\nArabin's letter was long and eager, and full of repetitions, but it\ndid explain clearly to them the exact manner in which the cheque had\nfound its way into Mr. Crawley's hand. \"Francis came up to me,\" she\nsaid in her letter,--Francis being her husband, the dean,--\"and asked\nme for the money, which I had promised to make up in a packet. The\npacket was not ready, and he would not wait, declaring that Mr.\nCrawley was in such a flurry that he did not like to leave him. I\nwas therefore to bring it down to the door. I went to my desk, and\nthinking that I could spare the twenty pounds as well as the fifty, I\nput the cheque into the envelope, together with the notes, and handed\nthe packet to Francis at the door. I think I told Francis afterwards\nthat I put seventy pounds into the envelope, instead of fifty, but of\nthis I will not be sure. _At any rate, Mr. Crawley got Mr. Soames's\ncheque from me._\" These last words she underscored, and then went on\nto explain how the cheque had been paid to her a short time before by\nDan Stringer.\n\n\"Then Toogood has been right about the fellow,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"I hope they'll hang him,\" said Mrs. Grantly. \"He must have known all\nthe time what dreadful misery he was bringing upon this unfortunate\nfamily.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose Dan Stringer cared much about that,\" said the major.\n\n\"Not a straw,\" said the archdeacon, and then all hurried off to\nchurch; and the archdeacon preached the sermon in the fabrication of\nwhich he had been interrupted by his son, and which therefore barely\nenabled him to turn the quarter of an hour from the giving out of his\ntext. It was his constant practice to preach for full twenty minutes.\n\nAs Barchester lay on the direct road from Plumstead to Hogglestock,\nit was thought well that word should be sent to Mr. Toogood, desiring\nhim not to come out to Plumstead on the Monday morning. Major Grantly\nproposed to call for him at \"The Dragon,\" and to take him on from\nthence to Hogglestock. \"You had better take your mother's horses all\nthrough,\" said the archdeacon. The distance was very nearly twenty\nmiles, and it was felt both by the mother and the son, that the\narchdeacon must be in a good humour when he made such a proposition\nas that. It was not often that the rectory carriage-horses were\nallowed to make long journeys. A run into Barchester and back, which\naltogether was under ten miles, was generally the extent of their\nwork. \"I meant to have posted from Barchester,\" said the major. \"You\nmay as well take the horses through,\" said the archdeacon. \"Your\nmother will not want them. And I suppose you might as well bring your\nfriend Toogood back to dinner. We'll give him a bed.\"\n\n\"He must be a good sort of man,\" said Mrs. Grantly; \"for I suppose he\nhas done all this for love?\"\n\n\"Yes; and spent a lot of money out of his own pocket too!\" said the\nmajor enthusiastically. \"And the joke of it is, that he has been\ndefending Crawley in Crawley's teeth. Mr. Crawley had refused to\nemploy counsel; but Toogood had made up his mind to have a barrister,\non purpose that there might be a fuss about it in court. He thought\nthat it would tell with the jury in Crawley's favour.\"\n\n\"Bring him here, and we'll hear all about that from himself,\" said\nthe archdeacon. The major, before he started, told his mother that he\nshould call at Framley Parsonage on his way back; but he said nothing\non this subject to his father.\n\n\"I'll write to her in a day or two,\" said Mrs. Grantly, \"and we'll\nhave things settled pleasantly.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\n\nTHE CRAWLEYS ARE INFORMED.\n\n\nMajor Grantly made an early start, knowing that he had a long day's\nwork before him. He had written over-night to Mr. Toogood, naming the\nhour at which he would reach \"The Dragon,\" and was there punctual\nto the moment. When the attorney came out and got into the open\ncarriage, while the groom held the steps for him, it was plain\nto be seen that the respect in which he was held at \"The Dragon\"\nwas greatly increased. It was already known that he was going to\nPlumstead that night, and it was partly understood that he was\nengaged with the Grantly and Arabin faction in defending Mr. Crawley\nthe clergyman against the Proudie faction. Dan Stringer, who was\nstill at the inn, as he saw his enemy get into the Plumstead\ncarriage, felt himself to be one of the palace party, and felt that\nif Mrs. Proudie had only lived till after the assizes all this heavy\ntrouble would not have befallen him. The waiter with the dirty napkin\nstood at the door and bowed, thinking perhaps that as the Proudie\nparty was going down in Barchester, it might be as well to be civil\nto Mr. Toogood. The days of the Stringers were probably drawing to a\nclose at \"The Dragon of Wantly,\" and there was no knowing who might\nbe the new landlord.\n\nHenry Grantly and the lawyer found very little to say to each other\non their long way out to Hogglestock. They were thinking, probably,\nmuch of the coming interview, and hardly knew how to express\ntheir thoughts to each other. \"I will not take the carriage up to\nthe house,\" said the major, as they were entering the parish of\nHogglestock; \"particularly as the man must feed the horses.\" So they\ngot out at a farmhouse about half a mile from the church, where the\noffence of the carriage and livery-servant would be well out of\nMr. Crawley's sight, and from thence walked towards the parsonage.\nThe church, and the school close to it, lay on their way, and as\nthey passed by the school door they heard voices within. \"I'll bet\ntwopence he's there,\" said Toogood. \"They tell me he's always either\nin one shop or the other. I'll slip in and bring him out.\" Mr.\nToogood had assumed a comfortable air, as though the day's work was\nto be good pastime, and even made occasional attempts at drollery. He\nhad had his jokes about Dan Stringer, and had attempted to describe\nthe absurdities of Mr. Crawley's visit to Bedford Row. All this would\nhave angered the major, had he not seen that it was assumed to cover\nsomething below of which Mr. Toogood was a little ashamed, but of\nwhich, as the major thought, Mr. Toogood had no cause to be ashamed.\nWhen, therefore, Toogood proposed to go into the school and bring\nMr. Crawley out, as though the telling of their story would be the\neasiest thing in the world, the major did not stop him. Indeed he\nhad no plan of his own ready. His mind was too intent on the tragedy\nwhich had occurred, and which was now to be brought to a close, to\nenable him to form any plan as to the best way of getting up the last\nscene. So Mr. Toogood, with quick and easy steps, entered the school,\nleaving the major still standing in the road. Mr. Crawley was in the\nschool;--as was also Jane Crawley. \"So here you are,\" said Toogood.\n\"That's fortunate. I hope I find you pretty well?\"\n\n\"If I am not mistaken in the identity, my wife's relative, Mr.\nToogood?\" said Mr. Crawley, stepping down from his humble desk.\n\n\"Just so, my friend,\" said Toogood, with his hand extended, \"just so;\nand there's another gentleman outside who wants to have a word with\nyou also. Perhaps you won't mind stepping out. These are the young\nHogglestockians; are they?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"These are the young Hogglestockians, are they?\"]\n\nThe young Hogglestockians stared at him, and so did Jane. Jane, who\nhad before heard of him, did not like him at first sight, seeing\nthat her father was clearly displeased by the tone of the visitor's\naddress. Mr. Crawley was displeased. There was a familiarity about\nMr. Toogood which made him sore, as having been exhibited before his\npupils. \"If you will be pleased to step out, sir, I will follow you,\"\nhe said, waving his hand towards the door. \"Jane, my dear, if you\nwill remain with the children, I will return to you presently. Bobby\nStudge has failed in saying his Belief. You had better set him on\nagain from the beginning. Now, Mr. Toogood.\" And again he waved with\nhis hand towards the door.\n\n\"So that's my young cousin, is it?\" said Toogood, stretching over and\njust managing to touch Jane's fingers,--of which act of touching Jane\nwas very chary. Then he went forth, and Mr. Crawley followed him.\nThere was the major standing in the road, and Toogood was anxious to\nbe the first to communicate the good news. It was the only reward he\nhad proposed to himself for the money he had expended and the time he\nhad lost and the trouble he had taken. \"It's all right, old fellow,\"\nhe said, clapping his hand on Crawley's shoulder. \"We've got the\nright sow by the ear at last. We know all about it.\" Mr. Crawley\ncould hardly remember the time when he had been called an old fellow\nlast, and now he did not like it; nor, in the confusion of his mind,\ncould he understand the allusion to the right sow. He supposed that\nMr. Toogood had come to him about his trial, but it did not occur to\nhim that the lawyer might be bringing him news which might make the\ntrial altogether unnecessary. \"If my eyes are not mistaken, there is\nmy friend, Major Grantly,\" said Mr. Crawley.\n\n\"There he is, as large as life,\" said Toogood. \"But stop a moment\nbefore you go to him, and give me your hand. I must have the first\nshake of it.\" Hereupon Crawley extended his hand. \"That's right. And\nnow let me tell you we know all about the cheque,--Soames's cheque.\nWe know where you got it. We know who stole it. We know how it came\nto the person who gave it to you. It's all very well talking, but\nwhen you're in trouble always go to a lawyer.\"\n\nBy this time Mr. Crawley was looking full into Mr. Toogood's face,\nand seeing that his cousin's eyes were streaming with tears, began\nto get some insight into the man's character, and also some very\ndim insight into the facts which the man intended to communicate to\nhimself. \"I do not as yet fully understand you, sir,\" said he, \"being\nperhaps in such matters somewhat dull of intellect, but it seemeth to\nme that you are a messenger of glad tidings, whose feet are beautiful\nupon the mountains.\"\n\n\"Beautiful!\" said Toogood. \"By George, I should think they are\nbeautiful! Don't you hear me tell you that we have found out all\nabout the cheque, and that you're as right as a trivet?\" They were\nstill on the little causeway leading from the school up to the road,\nand Henry Grantly was waiting for them at the small wicket-gate. \"Mr.\nCrawley,\" said the major, \"I congratulate you with all my heart. I\ncould not but accompany my friend, Mr. Toogood, when he brought you\nthis good news.\"\n\n\"I do not even yet altogether comprehend what has been told to me,\"\nsaid Crawley, now standing out on the road between the other two men.\n\"I am doubtless dull,--very dull. May I beg some clearer word of\nexplanation before I ask you to go with me to my wife?\"\n\n\"The cheque was given to you by my aunt Eleanor.\"\n\n\"Your aunt Eleanor!\" said Crawley, now altogether in the clouds. Who\nwas the major's aunt Eleanor? Though he had, no doubt, at different\ntimes heard all the circumstances of the connection, he had never\nrealized the fact that his daughter's lover was the nephew of his old\nfriend, Arabin.\n\n\"Yes; by my aunt, Mrs. Arabin.\"\n\n\"She put it into the envelope with the notes,\" said\nToogood;--\"slipped it in without saying a word to any one. I never\nheard of a woman doing such a mad thing in my life before. If she had\ndied, or if we hadn't caught her, where should we all have been? Not\nbut what I think I should have run Dan Stringer to ground too, and\nworked it out of him.\"\n\n\"Then, after all, it was given to me by the dean?\" said Crawley,\ndrawing himself up.\n\n\"It was in the envelope, but the dean did not know it,\" said the\nmajor.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"I was sure of it. I knew it. Weak as\nmy mind may be,--and at times it is very weak,--I was certain that\nI could not have erred in such a matter. The more I struggled with\nmy memory, the more fixed with me became the fact,--which I had\nforgotten but for a moment,--that the document had formed a part of\nthat small packet handed to me by the dean. But look you, sirs,--bear\nwith me yet for a moment. I said that it was so, and the dean denied\nit.\"\n\n\"The dean did not know it, man,\" said Toogood, almost in a passion.\n\n\"Bear with me yet awhile. So far have I been from misdoubting the\ndean,--whom I have long known to be in all things a true and honest\ngentleman,--that I postponed the elaborated result of my own memory\nto his word. And I felt myself the more constrained to do this,\nbecause, in a moment of forgetfulness, in the wantonness of\ninconsiderate haste, with wicked thoughtlessness, I had allowed\nmyself to make a false statement,--unwittingly false, indeed,\nnathless very false, unpardonably false. I had declared, without\nthinking, that the money had come to me from the hands of Mr. Soames,\nthereby seeming to cast a reflection upon that gentleman. When I had\nbeen guilty of so great a blunder, of so gross a violation of that\nordinary care which should govern all words between man and man,\nespecially when any question of money may be in doubt,--how could I\nexpect that any one should accept my statement when contravened by\nthat made by the dean? How, in such an embarrassment, could I believe\nmy own memory? Gentlemen, I did not believe my own memory. Though all\nthe little circumstances of that envelope, with its rich but perilous\nfreightage, came back upon me from time to time with an exactness\nthat has appeared to me to be almost marvellous, yet I have told\nmyself that it was not so! Gentlemen, if you please, we will go\ninto the house; my wife is there, and should no longer be left in\nsuspense.\" They passed on in silence for a few steps, till Crawley\nspoke again. \"Perhaps you will allow me the privilege to be alone\nwith her for one minute,--but for a minute. Her thanks shall not be\ndelayed, where thanks are so richly due.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Toogood, wiping his eyes with a large red bandana\nhandkerchief. \"By all means. We'll take a little walk. Come along,\nmajor.\" The major had turned his face away, and he also was weeping.\n\"By George! I never heard such a thing in all my life,\" said Toogood.\n\"I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it. I wouldn't, indeed.\nIf I were to tell that up in London, nobody would believe me.\"\n\n\"I call that man a hero,\" said Grantly.\n\n\"I don't know about being a hero. I never quite knew what makes a\nhero, if it isn't having three or four girls dying in love for you\nat once. But to find a man who was going to let everything in the\nworld go against him, because he believed another fellow better than\nhimself! There's many a chap thinks another man is wool-gathering;\nbut this man has thought he was wool-gathering himself! It's not\nnatural; and the world wouldn't go on if there were many like that.\nHe's beckoning, and we had better go in.\"\n\nMr. Toogood went first, and the major followed him. When they entered\nthe front door they saw the skirt of a woman's dress flitting away\nthrough the door at the end of the passage, and on entering the room\nto the left they found Mr. Crawley alone. \"She has fled, as though\nfrom an enemy,\" he said, with a little attempt at a laugh; \"but I\nwill pursue her, and bring her back.\"\n\n\"No, Crawley, no,\" said the lawyer. \"She's a little upset, and all\nthat kind of thing. We know what women are. Let her alone.\"\n\n\"Nay, Mr. Toogood; but then she would be angered with herself\nafterwards, and would lack the comfort of having spoken a word of\ngratitude. Pardon me, Major Grantly; but I would not have you leave\nus till she has seen you. It is as her cousin says. She is somewhat\nover-excited. But still it will be best that she should see you.\nGentlemen, you will excuse me.\"\n\nThen he went out to fetch his wife, and while he was away not a word\nwas spoken. The major looked out of one window and Mr. Toogood out\nof the other, and they waited patiently till they heard the coming\nsteps of the husband and wife. When the door was opened, Mr. Crawley\nappeared, leading his wife by the hand. \"My dear,\" he said, \"you know\nMajor Grantly. This is your cousin, Mr. Toogood. It is well that\nyou know him too, and remember his great kindness to us.\" But Mrs.\nCrawley could not speak. She could only sink on the sofa, and hide\nher face, while she strove in vain to repress her sobs. She had been\nvery strong through all her husband's troubles,--very strong in\nbearing for him what he could not bear for himself, and in fighting\non his behalf battles in which he was altogether unable to couch\na lance; but the endurance of so many troubles, and the great\noverwhelming sorrow at last, had so nearly overpowered her, that she\ncould not sustain the shock of this turn in their fortunes. \"She was\nnever like this, sirs, when ill news came to us,\" said Mr. Crawley,\nstanding somewhat apart from her.\n\nThe major sat himself by her side, and put his hand upon hers, and\nwhispered some word to her about her daughter. Upon this she threw\nher arms around him, and kissed his face, and then his hands, and\nthen looked up into his face through her tears. She murmured some few\nwords, or attempted to do so. I doubt whether the major understood\ntheir meaning, but he knew very well what was in her heart.\n\n\"And now I think we might as well be moving,\" said Mr. Toogood. \"I'll\nsee about having the indictment quashed. I'll arrange all that with\nWalker. It may be necessary that you should go into Barchester the\nfirst day the judges sit; and if so, I'll come and fetch you. You may\nbe sure I won't leave the place till it's all square.\"\n\nAs they were going, Grantly,--speaking now altogether with\nindifference as to Toogood's presence,--asked Mr. Crawley's leave to\nbe the bearer of these tidings to his daughter.\n\n\"She can hear it in no tones that can be more grateful to her,\" said\nMr. Crawley.\n\n\"I shall ask her for nothing for myself now,\" said Grantly. \"It would\nbe ungenerous. But hereafter,--in a few days,--when she shall be more\nat ease, may I then use your permission--?\"\n\n\"Major Grantly,\" said Mr. Crawley, solemnly, \"I respect you so\nhighly, and esteem you so thoroughly, that I give willingly that\nwhich you ask. If my daughter can bring herself to regard you, as a\nwoman should regard her husband, with the love that can worship and\ncling and be constant, she will, I think, have a fair promise of\nworldly happiness. And for you, sir, in giving to you my girl,--if\nso it be that she is given to you,--I shall bestow upon you a great\ntreasure.\" Had Grace been a king's daughter, with a queen's dowry,\nthe permission to address her could not have been imparted to her\nlover with a more thorough appreciation of the value of the privilege\nconferred.\n\n\"He is a rum 'un,\" said Mr. Toogood, as they got into the carriage\ntogether; \"but they say he's a very good 'un to go.\"\n\nAfter their departure Jane was sent for, that she might hear the\nfamily news; and when she expressed some feeling not altogether in\nfavour of Mr. Toogood, Mr. Crawley thus strove to correct her views.\n\"He is a man, my dear, who conceals a warm heart, and an active\nspirit, and healthy sympathies, under an affected jocularity of\nmanner, and almost with a touch of assumed vulgarity. But when the\njewel itself is good, any fault in the casket may be forgiven.\"\n\n\"Then, papa, the next time I see him I'll like him,--if I can,\" said\nJane.\n\nThe village of Framley lies slightly off the road from Hogglestock\nto Barchester,--so much so as to add perhaps a mile to the journey\nif the traveller goes by the parsonage gate. On their route to\nHogglestock our two travellers had passed Framley without visiting\nthe village, but on the return journey the major asked Mr. Toogood's\npermission to make the deviation. \"I'm not in a hurry,\" said Toogood.\n\"I never was more comfortable in my life. I'll just light a cigar\nwhile you go in and see your friends.\" Toogood lit his cigar, and\nthe major, getting down from the carriage, entered the parsonage. It\nwas his fortune to find Grace alone. Robarts was in Barchester, and\nMrs. Robarts was across the road, at Lufton Court. \"Miss Crawley was\ncertainly in,\" the servant told him, and he soon found himself in\nMiss Crawley's presence.\n\n\"I have only called to tell you the news about your father,\" said he.\n\n\"What news?\"\n\n\"We have just come from Hogglestock,--your cousin, Mr. Toogood, that\nis, and myself. They have found out all about the cheque. My aunt,\nMrs. Arabin, the dean's wife, you know,--she gave it to your father.\"\n\n\"Oh, Major Grantly!\"\n\n\"It seems so easily settled, does it not?\"\n\n\"And is it settled?\"\n\n\"Yes; everything. Everything about that.\" Now he had hold of her hand\nas if he were going. \"Good-by. I told your father that I would just\ncall and tell you.\"\n\n\"It seems almost more than I can believe.\"\n\n\"You may believe it; indeed you may.\" He still held her hand. \"You\nwill write to your mother I daresay to-night. Tell her I was here.\nGood-by now.\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" she said. Her hand was still in his, as she looked up into\nhis face.\n\n\"Dear, dear, dearest Grace! My darling Grace!\" Then he took her\ninto his arms and kissed her, and went his way without another word,\nfeeling that he had kept his word to her father like a gentleman.\nGrace, when she was left alone, thought that she was the happiest\ngirl in Christendom. If she could only get to her mother, and tell\neverything, and be told everything! She had no idea of any promise\nthat her lover might have made to her father, nor did she make\ninquiry of her own thoughts as to his reasons for staying with her so\nshort a time; but looking back at it all she thought his conduct had\nbeen perfect.\n\nIn the meantime the major, with Mr. Toogood, was driven home to\ndinner at Plumstead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV.\n\nMADALINA'S HEART IS BLEEDING.\n\n\nJohn Eames, as soon as he had left Mrs. Arabin at the hotel and had\ntaken his travelling-bag to his own lodgings, started off for his\nuncle Toogood's house. There he found Mrs. Toogood, not in the most\nserene state of mind as to her husband's absence. Mr. Toogood had\nnow been at Barchester for the best part of a week,--spending a good\ndeal of money at the inn. Mrs. Toogood was quite sure that he must\nbe doing that. Indeed, how could he help himself? Johnny remarked\nthat he did not see how in such circumstances his uncle was to help\nhimself. And then Mr. Toogood had only written one short scrap of a\nletter,--just three words, and they were written in triumph. \"Crawley\nis all right, and I think I've got the real Simon Pure by the heels.\"\n\"It's all very well, John,\" Mrs. Toogood said; \"and of course it\nwould be a terrible thing to the family if anybody connected with\nit were made out to be a thief.\" \"It would be quite dreadful,\" said\nJohnny. \"Not that I ever looked upon the Crawleys as connections of\nours. But, however, let that pass. I'm sure I'm very glad that your\nuncle should have been able to be of service to them. But there's\nreason in the roasting of eggs, and I can tell you that money is\nnot so plenty in this house, that your uncle can afford to throw it\ninto the Barchester gutters. Think what twelve children are, John.\nIt might be all very well if Toogood were a bachelor, and if some\nlord had left him a fortune.\" John Eames did not stay very long in\nTavistock Square. His cousins Polly and Lucy were gone to the play\nwith Mr. Summerkin, and his aunt was not in one of her best humours.\nHe took his uncle's part as well as he could, and then left Mrs.\nToogood. The little allusion to Lord De Guest's generosity had not\nbeen pleasant to him. It seemed to rob him of all his own merit. He\nhad been rather proud of his journey to Italy, having contrived to\nspend nearly forty pounds in ten days. He had done everything in the\nmost expensive way, feeling that every napoleon wasted had been laid\nout on behalf of Mr. Crawley. But, as Mrs. Toogood had just told\nhim, all this was nothing to what Toogood was doing. Toogood with\ntwelve children was living at his own charges at Barchester, and\nwas neglecting his business besides. \"There's Mr. Crump,\" said Mrs.\nToogood. \"Of course he doesn't like it, and what can I say to him\nwhen he comes to me?\" This was not quite fair on the part of Mrs.\nToogood, as Mr. Crump had not troubled her even once as yet since her\nhusband's departure.\n\nWhat was Johnny to do, when he left Tavistock Square? His club was\nopen to him. Should he go to his club, play a game of billiards, and\nhave some supper? When he asked himself the question he knew that he\nwould not go to his club, and yet he pretended to doubt about it, as\nhe made his way to a cabstand in Tottenham Court Road. It would be\nslow, he told himself, to go to his club. He would have gone to see\nLily Dale, only that his intimacy with Mrs. Thorne was not sufficient\nto justify his calling at her house between nine and ten o'clock at\nnight. But, as he must go somewhere,--and as his intimacy with Lady\nDemolines was, he thought, sufficient to justify almost anything,--he\nwould go to Bayswater. I regret to say that he had written a\nmysterious note from Paris to Madalina Demolines, saying that he\nshould be in London on this very night, and that it was just on the\ncards that he might make his way up to Porchester Terrace before\nhe went to bed. The note was mysterious, because it had neither\nbeginning nor ending. It did not contain even initials. It was\nwritten like a telegraph message, and was about as long. It was the\nkind of thing Miss Demolines liked, Johnny thought; and there could\nbe no reason why he should not gratify her. It was her favourite\ngame. Some people like whist, some like croquet, and some like\nintrigue. Madalina would probably have called it romance,--because by\nnature she was romantic. John, who was made of sterner stuff, laughed\nat this. He knew that there was no romance in it. He knew that he\nwas only amusing himself, and gratifying her at the same time, by\na little innocent pretence. He told himself that it was his nature\nto prefer the society of women to that of men. He would have liked\nthe society of Lily Dale, no doubt, much better than that of Miss\nDemolines; but as the society of Lily Dale was not to be had at that\nmoment, the society of Miss Demolines was the best substitute within\nhis reach. So he got into a cab and had himself driven to Porchester\nTerrace. \"Is Lady Demolines at home?\" he said to the servant. He\nalways asked for Lady Demolines. But the page who was accustomed to\nopen the door for him was less false, being young, and would now\ntell him, without any further fiction, that Miss Madalina was in\nthe drawing-room. Such was the answer he got from the page on this\nevening. What Madalina did with her mother on these occasions he had\nnever yet discovered. There used to be some little excuses given\nabout Lady Demolines' state of health, but latterly Madalina had\ndiscontinued her references to her mother's headaches. She was\nstanding in the centre of the drawing-room when he entered it, with\nboth her hands raised, and an almost terrible expression of mystery\nin her face. Her hair, however, had been very carefully arranged\nso as to fall with copious carelessness down her shoulders, and\naltogether she was looking her best. \"Oh, John,\" she said. She called\nhim John by accident in the tumult of the moment. \"Have you heard\nwhat has happened? But of course you have heard it.\"\n\n\"Heard what? I have heard nothing,\" said Johnny, arrested almost\nin the doorway by the nature of the question,--and partly also, no\ndoubt, by the tumult of the moment. He had no idea how terrible\na tragedy was in truth in store for him; but he perceived that\nthe moment was to be tumultuous, and that he must carry himself\naccordingly.\n\n\"Come in, and close the door,\" she said. He came in and closed the\ndoor. \"Do you mean to say that you haven't heard what has happened in\nHook Court?\"\n\n\"No;--what has happened in Hook Court?\" Miss Demolines threw herself\nback into an arm-chair, closed her eyes, and clasped both her hands\nupon her forehead. \"What has happened in Hook Court?\" said Johnny,\nwalking up to her.\n\n\"I do not think I can bring myself to tell you,\" she answered.\n\nThen he took one of her hands down from her forehead and held it in\nhis,--which she allowed passively. She was thinking, no doubt, of\nsomething far different from that.\n\n\"I never saw you looking better in my life,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Don't,\" said she. \"How can you talk in that way, when my heart\nis bleeding,--bleeding.\" Then she pulled away her hand, and again\nclasped it with the other upon her forehead.\n\n\"But why is your heart bleeding? What has happened in Hook Court?\"\nStill she answered nothing, but she sobbed violently and the heaving\nof her bosom showed how tumultuous was the tumult within it. \"You\ndon't mean to say that Dobbs Broughton has come to grief;--that he's\nto be sold out?\"\n\n\"Man,\" said Madalina, jumping from her chair, standing at her full\nheight, and stretching out both her arms, \"he has destroyed himself!\"\nThe revelation was at last made with so much tragic propriety, in\nso excellent a tone, and with such an absence of all the customary\nredundances of commonplace relation, that I think that she must have\nrehearsed the scene,--either with her mother or with the page. Then\nthere was a minute's silence, during which she did not move even an\neyelid. She held her outstretched hands without dropping a finger\nhalf an inch. Her face was thrust forward, her chin projecting, with\ntragic horror; but there was no vacillation even in her chin. She did\nnot wink an eye, or alter to the breadth of a hair the aperture of\nher lips. Surely she was a great genius if she did it all without\nprevious rehearsal. Then, before he had thought of words in which to\nanswer her, she let her hands fall by her side, she closed her eyes,\nand shook her head, and fell back again into her chair. \"It is too\nhorrible to be spoken of,--to be thought about,\" she said. \"I could\nnot have brought myself to tell the tale to a living being,--except\nto you.\"\n\nThis would naturally have been flattering to Johnny had it not been\nthat he was in truth absorbed by the story which he had heard.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me,\" he said, \"that Broughton has--committed\nsuicide?\" She could not speak of it again, but nodded her head at him\nthrice, while her eyes were still closed. \"And how was the manner of\nit?\" said he, asking the question in a low voice. He could not even\nas yet quite bring himself to believe it. Madalina was so fond of a\nlittle playful intrigue, that even this story might have something in\nit of the nature of fiction. He was not quite sure of the facts, and\nyet he was shocked by what he had heard.\n\n\"Would you have me repeat to you all the bloody details of that\nterrible scene?\" she said. \"It is impossible. Go to your friend\nDalrymple. He will tell you. He knows it all. He has been with Maria\nall through. I wish,--I wish it had not been so.\" But nevertheless\nshe did bring herself to narrate all the details with something more\nof circumstance than Eames desired. She soon succeeded in making him\nunderstand that the tragedy of Hook Court was a reality, and that\npoor Dobbs Broughton had brought his career to an untimely end. She\nhad heard everything,--having indeed gone to Musselboro in the City,\nand having penetrated even to the sanctum of Mr. Bangles. To Mr.\nBangles she had explained that she was bosom-friend of the widow\nof the unfortunate man, and that it was her miserable duty to make\nherself the mistress of all the circumstances. Mr. Bangles,--the\nreader may remember him, Burton and Bangles, who kept the stores\nfor Himalaya wines at 22_s._ 6_d._ the dozen, in Hook Court,--was a\nbachelor, and rather liked the visit, and told Miss Demolines very\nfreely all he had seen. And when she suggested that it might be\nexpedient for the sake of the family that she should come back to\nMr. Bangles for further information at a subsequent period, he very\npolitely assured her that she would \"do him proud,\" whenever she\nmight please to call in Hook Court. And then he saw her into Lombard\nStreet, and put her into an omnibus. She was therefore well qualified\nto tell Johnny all the particulars of the tragedy,--and she did\nso far overcome her horror as to tell them all. She told her tale\nsomewhat after the manner of \u00c3\u0086neas, not forgetting the \"quorum pars\nmagna fui.\" \"I feel that it almost makes an old woman of me,\" said\nshe, when she had finished.\n\n\"No,\" said Johnny, remonstrating;--\"not that.\"\n\n\"But it does. To have been concerned in so terrible a tragedy takes\nmore of life out of one than years of tranquil existence.\" As she\nhad told him nothing of her intercourse with Bangles,--with Bangles\nwho had literally picked the poor wretch up,--he did not see how\nshe herself had been concerned in the matter; but he said nothing\nabout that, knowing the character of his Madalina. \"I shall\nsee--that--body, floating before my eyes while I live,\" she said,\n\"and the gory wound, and,--and--\" \"Don't,\" said Johnny, recoiling in\ntruth from the picture, by which he was revolted. \"Never again,\" she\nsaid; \"never again! But you forced it from me, and now I shall not\nclose my eyes for a week.\"\n\nShe then became very comfortably confidential, and discussed\nthe affairs of poor Mrs. Dobbs Broughton with a great deal of\nsatisfaction. \"I went to see her, of course, but she sent me down\nword to say that the shock would be too much for her. I do not wonder\nthat she should not see me. Poor Maria! She came to me for advice,\nyou know, when Dobbs Broughton first proposed to her; and I was\nobliged to tell her what I really thought. I knew her character so\nwell! 'Dear Maria,' I said, 'if you think that you can love him, take\nhim!' 'I think I can,' she replied. 'But,' said I, 'make yourself\nquite sure about the business.' And how has it turned out? She\nnever loved him. What heart she has she has given to that wretched\nDalrymple.\"\n\n\"I don't see that he is particularly wretched,\" said Johnny, pleading\nfor his friend.\n\n\"He is wretched, and so you'll find. She gave him her heart after\ngiving her hand to poor Dobbs; and as for the business, there isn't\nas much left as will pay for her mourning. I don't wonder that she\ncould not bring herself to see me.\"\n\n\"And what has become of the business?\"\n\n\"It belongs to Mrs. Van Siever,--to her and Musselboro. Poor\nBroughton had some little money, and it has gone among them.\nMusselboro, who never had a penny, will be a rich man. Of course you\nknow that he is going to marry Clara?\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"I always told you that it would be so. And now you may perhaps\nacknowledge that Conway Dalrymple's prospects are not very brilliant.\nI hope he likes being cut out by Mr. Musselboro! Of course he will\nhave to marry Maria. I do not see how he can escape. Indeed, she is\ntoo good for him;--only after such a marriage as that, there would be\nan end to all his prospects as an artist. The best thing for them\nwould be to go to New Zealand.\"\n\nJohn Eames certainly liked these evenings with Miss Demolines. He sat\nat his ease in a comfortable chair, and amused himself by watching\nher different little plots. And then she had bright eyes, and she\nflattered him, and allowed him to scold her occasionally. And now\nand again there might be some more potent attraction, when she would\nadmit him to take her hand,--or the like. It was better than to sit\nsmoking with men at the club. But he could not sit all night even\nwith Madalina Demolines, and at eleven he got up to take his leave.\n\"When shall you see Miss Dale?\" she asked him suddenly.\n\n\"I do not know,\" he answered, frowning at her. He always frowned at\nher when she spoke to him of Miss Dale.\n\n\"I do not in the least care for your frowns,\" she said playfully,\nputting up her hands to smooth his brows. \"I think I know you\nintimately enough to name your goddess to you.\"\n\n\"She isn't my goddess.\"\n\n\"A very cold goddess, I should think, from what I hear. I wish to ask\nyou for a promise respecting her.\"\n\n\"What promise?\"\n\n\"Will you grant it me?\"\n\n\"How can I tell till I hear?\"\n\n\"You must promise me not to speak of me to her when you see her.\"\n\n\"But why must I promise that?\"\n\n\"Promise me.\"\n\n\"Not unless you tell me why.\" Johnny had already assured himself that\nnothing could be more improbable than that he should mention the name\nof Miss Demolines to Lily Dale.\n\n\"Very well, sir. Then you may go. And I must say that unless you can\ncomply with so slight a request as that, I shall not care to see you\nhere again. Mr. Eames, why should you want to speak evil of me to\nMiss Dale?\"\n\n\"I do not want to speak evil of you.\"\n\n\"I know that you could not speak of me to her without at least\nridicule. Come, promise me. You shall come here on Thursday evening,\nand I will tell you why I have asked you.\"\n\n\"Tell me now.\"\n\nShe hesitated a moment, and then shook her head. \"No. I cannot tell\nyou now. My heart is still bleeding with the memory of that poor\nman's fate. I will not tell you now. And yet it is now that you must\ngive me the promise. Will you not trust me so far as that?\"\n\n\"I will not speak of you to Miss Dale.\"\n\n\"There is my own friend! And now, John, mind you are here at\nhalf-past eight on Thursday. Punctually at half-past eight. There is\na thing I have to tell you, which I will tell you then if you will\ncome. I had thought to have told you to-day.\"\n\n\"And why not now?\"\n\n\"I cannot. My feelings are too many for me. I should never go through\nwith it after all that has passed between us about poor Broughton.\nI should break down; indeed I should. Go now, for I am tired.\" Then,\nhaving probably taken a momentary advantage of that more potent\nattraction to which we have before alluded, he left the room very\nsuddenly.\n\nHe left the room very suddenly because Madalina's movements had been\nso sudden, and her words so full of impulse. He had become aware\nthat in this little game which he was playing in Porchester Terrace\neverything ought to be done after some unaccustomed and special\nfashion. So,--having clasped Madalina for one moment in his arms,--he\nmade a rush at the room door, and was out on the landing in a second.\nHe was a little too quick for old Lady Demolines, the skirt of whose\nnight-dress,--as it seemed to Johnny,--he saw whisking away, in at\nanother door. It was nothing, however, to him if old Lady Demolines,\nwho was always too ill to be seen, chose to roam about her own house\nin her night-dress.\n\nWhen he found himself alone in the street, his mind reverted to Dobbs\nBroughton and the fate of the wretched man, and he sauntered slowly\ndown Palace Gardens, that he might look at the house in which he had\ndined with a man who had destroyed himself by his own hands. He stood\nfor a moment looking up at the windows, in which there was now no\nlight, thinking of the poor woman whom he had seen in the midst of\nluxury, and who was now left a widow in such miserable circumstances!\nAs for the suggestion that his friend Conway would marry her, he did\nnot believe it for a moment. He knew too well what the suggestions of\nhis Madalina were worth, and the motives from which they sprung. But\nhe thought it might be true that Mrs. Van Siever had absorbed all\nthere was of property, and possibly, also, that Musselboro was to\nmarry her daughter. At any rate, he would go to Dalrymple's rooms,\nand if he could find him, would learn the truth. He knew enough of\nDalrymple's ways of life, and of the ways of his friend's chambers\nand studio, to care nothing for the lateness of the hour, and in a\nvery few minutes he was sitting in Dalrymple's arm-chair. He found\nSiph Dunn there, smoking in unperturbed tranquillity, and as long as\nthat lasted he could ask no questions about Mrs. Broughton. He told\nthem, therefore, of his adventures abroad, and of Crawley's escape.\nBut at last, having finished his third pipe, Siph Dunn took his\nleave.\n\n\"Tell me,\" said John, as soon as Dunn had closed the door, \"what is\nthis I hear about Dobbs Broughton?\"\n\n\"He has blown his brains out. That is all.\"\n\n\"How terribly shocking!\"\n\n\"Yes; it shocked us all at first. We are used to it now.\"\n\n\"And the business?\"\n\n\"That had gone to the dogs. They say at least that his share of it\nhad done so.\"\n\n\"And he was ruined?\"\n\n\"They say so. That is, Musselboro says so, and Mrs. Van Siever.\"\n\n\"And what do you say, Conway?\"\n\n\"The less I say the better. I have my hopes,--only you're such a\ntalkative fellow, one can't trust you.\"\n\n\"I never told any secret of yours, old fellow.\"\n\n\"Well;--the fact is, I have an idea that something may be saved for\nthe poor woman. I think that they are wronging her. Of course all\nI can do is to put the matter into a lawyer's hands, and pay the\nlawyer's bill. So I went to your cousin, and he has taken the case\nup. I hope he won't ruin me.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose you are quarrelling with Mrs. Van?\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter. She has quarrelled with me.\"\n\n\"And what about Jael, Conway? They tell me that Jael is going to\nbecome Mrs. Musselboro.\"\n\n\"Who has told you that?\"\n\n\"A bird.\"\n\n\"Yes; I know who the bird is. I don't think that Jael will become\nMrs. Musselboro. I don't think that Jael would become Mrs.\nMusselboro, if Jael were the only woman, and Musselboro the only\nman in London. To tell you a little bit of secret, Johnny, I think\nthat Jael will become the wife of one Conway Dalrymple. That is my\nopinion; and as far as I can judge, it is the opinion of Jael also.\"\n\n\"But not the opinion of Mrs. Van. The bird told me another thing,\nConway.\"\n\n\"What was the other thing?\"\n\n\"The bird hinted that all this would end in your marrying the widow\nof that poor wretch who destroyed himself.\"\n\n\"Johnny, my boy,\" said the artist, after a moment's silence, \"if I\ngive you a bit of advice, will you profit by it?\"\n\n\"I'll try, if it's not disagreeable.\"\n\n\"Whether you profit by it, or whether you do not, keep it to\nyourself. I know the bird better than you do, and I strongly caution\nyou to beware of the bird. The bird is a bird of prey, and altogether\nan unclean bird. The bird wants a mate and doesn't much care how she\nfinds one. And the bird wants money, and doesn't much care how she\ngets it. The bird is a decidedly bad bird, and not at all fit to take\nthe place of domestic hen in a decent farmyard. In plain English,\nJohnny, you'll find some day, if you go over too often to Porchester\nTerrace, either that you are going to marry the bird, or else that\nyou are employing your cousin Toogood for your defence in an action\nfor breach of promise, brought against you by that venerable old\nbird, the bird's mamma.\"\n\n\"If it's to be either, it will be the latter,\" said Johnny as he took\nup his hat to go away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\n\nI THINK HE IS LIGHT OF HEART.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMrs. Arabin remained one day in town. Mr. Toogood, in spite of his\nasseveration that he would not budge from Barchester till he had seen\nMr. Crawley through all his troubles, did run up to London as soon\nas the news reached him that John Eames had returned. He came up and\ntook Mrs. Arabin's deposition, which he sent down to Mr. Walker. It\nmight still be necessary, Mrs. Arabin was told, that she should go\ninto court, and there state on oath that she had given the cheque to\nMr. Crawley; but Mr. Walker was of opinion that the circumstances\nwould enable the judge to call upon the grand jury not to find a true\nbill against Mr. Crawley, and that the whole affair, as far as Mr.\nCrawley was concerned, would thus be brought to an end. Toogood was\nstill very anxious to place Dan Stringer in the dock, but Mr. Walker\ndeclared that they would fail if they made the attempt. Dan had been\nexamined before the magistrates at Barchester, and had persisted\nin his statement that he had heard nothing about Mr. Crawley and\nthe cheque. This he said in the teeth of the words which had fallen\nfrom him unawares in the presence of Mr. Toogood. But they could not\npunish him for a lie,--not even for such a lie as that! He was not\nupon oath, and they could not make him responsible to the law because\nhe had held his tongue upon a matter as to which it was manifest\nto them all that he had known the whole history during the entire\nperiod of Mr. Crawley's persecution. They could only call upon him to\naccount for his possession of the cheque, and this he did by saying\nit had been paid to him by Jem Scuttle, who received all moneys\nappertaining to the hotel stables, and accounted for them once a\nweek. Jem Scuttle had simply told him that he had taken the cheque\nfrom Mr. Soames, and Jem had since gone to New Zealand. It was\nquite true that Jem's departure had followed suspiciously close upon\nthe payment of the rent to Mrs. Arabin, and that Jem had been in\nclose amity with Dan Stringer up to the moment of his departure.\nThat Dan Stringer had not become honestly possessed of the cheque,\neverybody knew; but, nevertheless, the magistrates were of opinion,\nMr. Walker coinciding with them, that there was no evidence against\nhim sufficient to secure a conviction. The story, however, of Mr.\nCrawley's injuries was so well known in Barchester, and the feeling\nagainst the man who had permitted him to be thus injured was\nso strong, that Dan Stringer did not altogether escape without\npunishment. Some rough spirits in Barchester called one night at \"The\nDragon of Wantly,\" and begged that Mr. Dan Stringer would be kind\nenough to come out and take a walk with them that evening; and when\nit was intimated to them that Dan Stringer had not just then any\ndesire for such exercise, they requested to be allowed to go into the\nback parlour and make an evening with Dan Stringer in that recess.\nThere was a terrible row at \"The Dragon of Wantly\" that night, and\nDan with difficulty was rescued by the police. On the following\nmorning he was smuggled out of Barchester by an early train, and has\nnever more been seen in that city. Rumours of him, however, were soon\nheard, from which it appeared that he had made himself acquainted\nwith the casual ward of more than one workhouse in London. His cousin\nJohn left the inn almost immediately,--as, indeed, he must have done\nhad there been no question of Mr. Soames's cheque,--and then there\nwas nothing more heard of the Stringers in Barchester.\n\nMrs. Arabin remained in town one day, and would have remained longer,\nwaiting for her husband, had not a letter from her sister impressed\nupon her that it might be as well that she should be with their\nfather as soon as possible. \"I don't mean to make you think that\nthere is any immediate danger,\" Mrs. Grantly said, \"and, indeed, we\ncannot say that he is ill; but it seems that the extremity of old age\nhas come upon him almost suddenly, and that he is as weak as a child.\nHis only delight is with the children, especially with Posy, whose\ngravity in her management of him is wonderful. He has not left his\nroom now for more than a week, and he eats very little. It may be\nthat he will live yet for years; but I should be deceiving you if I\ndid not let you know that both the archdeacon and I think that the\ntime of his departure from us is near at hand.\" After reading this\nletter, Mrs. Arabin could not wait in town for her husband, even\nthough he was expected in two days, and though she had been told that\nher presence at Barchester was not immediately required on behalf of\nMr. Crawley.\n\nBut during that one day she kept her promise to John Eames by going\nto Lily Dale. Mrs. Arabin had become very fond of Johnny, and felt\nthat he deserved the prize which he had been so long trying to win.\nThe reader, perhaps, may not agree with Mrs. Arabin. The reader, who\nmay have caught a closer insight into Johnny's character than Mrs.\nArabin had obtained, may, perhaps, think that a young man who could\namuse himself with Miss Demolines was unworthy of Lily Dale. If so, I\nmay declare for myself that I and the reader are not in accord about\nJohn Eames. It is hard to measure worth and worthlessness in such\nmatters, as there is no standard for such measurement. My old friend\nJohn was certainly no hero,--was very unheroic in many phases of his\nlife; but then, if all the girls are to wait for heroes, I fear that\nthe difficulties in the way of matrimonial arrangements, great as\nthey are at present, will be very seriously enhanced. Johnny was not\necstatic, nor heroic, nor transcendental, nor very beautiful in his\nmanliness; he was not a man to break his heart for love, or to have\nhis story written in an epic; but he was an affectionate, kindly,\nhonest young man; and I think most girls might have done worse than\ntake him. Whether he was wise to ask assistance in his love-making so\noften as he had done, that may be another question.\n\nMrs. Arabin was intimately acquainted with Mrs. Thorne, and therefore\nthere was nothing odd in her going to Mrs. Thorne's house. Mrs.\nThorne was very glad to see her, and told her all the Barsetshire\nnews,--much more than Mrs. Arabin would have learned in a week at the\ndeanery; for Mrs. Thorne had a marvellous gift of picking up news.\nShe had already heard the whole story of Mr. Soames's cheque, and\nexpressed her conviction that the least that could be done in amends\nto Mr. Crawley was to make him a bishop. \"And you see the palace is\nvacant,\" said Mrs. Thorne.\n\n\"The palace vacant!\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"It is just as good. Now that Mrs. Proudie has gone I don't suppose\nthe poor bishop will count for much. I can assure you, Mrs. Arabin, I\nfelt that poor woman's death so much! She used to regard me as one\nof the staunchest of the Proudieites! She once whispered to me such\na delightfully wicked story about the dean and the archdeacon. When\nI told her that they were my particular friends, she put on a look\nof horror. But I don't think she believed me.\" Then Emily Dunstable\nentered the room, and with her came Lily Dale. Mrs. Arabin had never\nbefore seen Lily, and of course they were introduced. \"I am sorry to\nsay Miss Dale is going home to Allington to-morrow,\" said Emily. \"But\nshe is coming to Chaldicotes in May,\" said Mrs. Thorne. \"Of course,\nMrs. Arabin, you know what gala doings we are going to have in May?\"\nThen there were various civil little speeches made on each side, and\nMrs. Arabin expressed a wish that she might meet Miss Dale again in\nBarsetshire. But all this did not bring her at all nearer to her\nobject.\n\n\"I particularly wish to say a word to Miss Dale,--here to-day, if she\nwill allow me,\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"I'm sure she will,--twenty words; won't you, Lily?\" said Mrs.\nThorne, preparing to leave the room. Then Mrs. Arabin apologized,\nand Mrs. Thorne, bustling up, said that it did not signify, and\nLily, remaining quite still on the sofa, wondered what it was all\nabout,--and in two minutes Lily and Mrs. Arabin were alone together.\nLily had just time to surmise that Mrs. Arabin's visit must have some\nreference to Mr. Crosbie,--remembering that Crosbie had married his\nwife out of Barsetshire, and forgetting altogether that Mrs. Arabin\nhad been just brought home from Italy by John Eames.\n\n\"I am afraid, Miss Dale, you will think me very impertinent,\" said\nMrs. Arabin.\n\n\"I am sure I shall not think that,\" said Lily.\n\n\"I believe you knew, before Mr. Eames started, that he was going to\nItaly to find me and my husband?\" said Mrs. Arabin. Then Lily put Mr.\nCrosbie altogether out of her head, and became aware that he was not\nto be the subject of the coming conversation. She was almost sorry\nthat it was so. There was no doubt in her mind as to what she would\nhave said to any one who might have taken up Crosbie's cause. On\nthat matter she could now have given a very decisive answer in a\nfew words. But on that other matter she was much more in doubt. She\nremembered, however, every word of the note she had received from M.\nD. She remembered also the words of John's note to that young woman.\nAnd her heart was still hard against him. \"Yes,\" she said; \"Mr. Eames\ncame here one night and told us why he was going. I was very glad\nthat he was going, because I thought it was right.\"\n\n\"You know, of course, how successful he has been? It was I who gave\nthe cheque to Mr. Crawley.\"\n\n\"So Mrs. Thorne has heard. Dr. Thorne has written to tell her the\nwhole story.\"\n\n\"And now I've come to look for Mr. Eames's reward.\"\n\n\"His reward, Mrs. Arabin?\"\n\n\"Yes; or rather to plead for him. You will not, I hope, be angry\nwith him because he has told me much of his history while we were\ntravelling home alone together.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Lily, smiling. \"How could he have chosen a better\nfriend in whom to trust?\"\n\n\"He could certainly have chosen none who would take his part more\nsincerely. He is so good and so amiable! He is so pleasant in his\nways, and so fitted to make a woman happy! And then, Miss Dale, he is\nalso so devoted!\"\n\n\"He is an old friend of ours, Mrs. Arabin.\"\n\n\"So he has told me.\"\n\n\"And we all of us love him dearly. Mamma is very much attached to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Unless he flatters himself, there is no one belonging to you who\nwould not wish that he should be nearer and dearer still.\"\n\n\"It may be so. I do not say that it is not so. Mamma and my uncle are\nboth fond of him.\"\n\n\"And does not that go a long way?\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"It ought not to do so,\" said Lily. \"It ought not to go any way at\nall.\"\n\n\"Ought it not? It seems to me that I could never have brought myself\nto marry any one whom my old friends had not liked.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is another thing.\"\n\n\"But is it not a recommendation to a man that he has been so\nsuccessful with your friends as to make them all feel that you might\ntrust yourself to him with perfect safety?\" To this Lily made no\nanswer, and Mrs. Arabin went on to plead her friend's cause with all\nthe eloquence she could use, insisting on all his virtues, his good\ntemper, his kindness, his constancy,--and not forgetting the fact\nthat the world was inclined to use him very well. Still Lily made no\nanswer. She had promised Mrs. Arabin that she would not regard her\ninterference as impertinent, and therefore she refrained from any\nword that might seem to show offence. Nor did she feel offence. It\nwas something gained by John Eames in Lily's estimation that he\nshould have such a friend as Mrs. Arabin to take an interest in his\nwelfare. But there was a self-dependence, perhaps one may call it an\nobstinacy about Lily Dale, which made her determined that she would\nnot be driven hither or thither by any pressure from without. Why\nhad John Eames, at the very moment when he should have been doing\nhis best to drive from her breast the memory of past follies,--when\nhe would have striven to do so had he really been earnest in his\nsuit,--why at such a moment had he allowed himself to correspond in\nterms of affection with such a woman as this M. D.? While Mrs. Arabin\nwas pleading for John Eames, Lily was repeating to herself certain\nwords which John had written to the woman--\"Ever and always yours\nunalterably.\" Such were not the exact words, but such was the form in\nwhich Lily, dishonestly, chose to repeat them to herself. And why was\nit so with her? In the old days she would have forgiven Crosbie any\noffence at a word or a look,--any possible letter to any M. D., let\nher have been ever so abominable! Nay,--had she not even forgiven him\nthe offence of deserting herself altogether on behalf of a woman as\ndetestable as could be any M. D. of Johnny's choosing;--a woman whose\nonly recommendation had been her title? And yet she would not forgive\nJohn Eames, though the evidence against him was of so flimsy a\nnature,--but rather strove to turn the flimsiness of that evidence\ninto strength! Why was it so? Unheroic as he might be, John Eames was\nsurely a better man and a bigger man than Adolphus Crosbie. It was\nsimply this;--she had fallen in love with the one, and had never\nfallen in love with the other! She had fallen in love with the one\nman, though in her simple way she had made a struggle against such\nfeeling; and she had not come to love the other man, though she had\ntold herself that it would be well that she should do so if it were\npossible. Again and again she had half declared to herself that she\nwould take him as her husband and leave the love to come afterwards;\nbut when the moment came for doing so, she could not do it.\n\n\"May I not say a word of comfort to him?\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"He will be very comfortable without any such word,\" said Lily,\nlaughing.\n\n\"But he is not comfortable; of that you may be very sure.\" \"Yours\never and unalterably, J. E.,\" said Lily to herself. \"You do not doubt\nhis affection?\" continued Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"I neither doubt it nor credit it.\"\n\n\"Then I think you wrong him. And the reason why I have ventured to\ncome to you is that you may know the impression which he has made\nupon one who was but the other day a stranger to him. I am sure that\nhe loves you.\"\n\n\"I think he is light of heart.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Miss Dale.\"\n\n\"And how am I to become his wife unless I love him well enough\nmyself? Mrs. Arabin, I have made up my mind about it. I shall never\nbecome any man's wife. Mamma and I are all in all together, and\nwe shall remain together.\" As soon as these words were out of her\nmouth, she hated herself for having spoken them. There was a maudlin,\nmissish, namby-mamby sentimentality about them which disgusted her.\nShe specially desired to be straightforward, resolute of purpose,\nhonest-spoken, and free from all touch of affectation. And yet she\nhad excused herself from marrying John Eames after the fashion of a\nsick schoolgirl. \"It is no good talking about it any more,\" she said,\ngetting up from her chair quickly.\n\n\"You are not angry with me;--or at any rate you will forgive me?\"\n\n\"I'm quite sure you have meant to be very good, and I am not a bit\nangry.\"\n\n\"And you will see him before you go?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; that is if he likes to come to-day, or early to-morrow.\nI go home to-morrow. I cannot refuse him, because he is such an old\nfriend,--almost like a brother. But it is of no use, Mrs. Arabin.\"\nThen Mrs. Arabin kissed her and left her, telling her that Mr. Eames\nwould come to her that afternoon at half-past five. Lily promised\nthat she would be at home to receive him.\n\n\"Won't you ride with us for the last time?\" said Emily Dunstable when\nLily gave notice that she would not want the horse on that afternoon.\n\n\"No; not to-day.\"\n\n\"You'll never have another opportunity of riding with Emily\nDunstable,\" said the bride elect;--\"at least I hope not.\"\n\n\"Even under those circumstances I must refuse, though I would give a\nguinea to be with you. John Eames is coming here to say good-by.\"\n\n\"Oh; then indeed you must not come with us. Lily, what will you say\nto him?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lily, think of it.\"\n\n\"I have thought of it. I have thought of nothing else. I am tired of\nthinking of it. It is not good to think of anything so much. What\ndoes it matter?\"\n\n\"It is very good to have some one to love one better than all the\nworld besides.\"\n\n\"I have some one,\" said Lily, thinking of her mother, but not caring\nto descend again to the mawkish weakness of talking about her.\n\n\"Yes; but some one to be always with you, to do everything for you,\nto be your very own.\"\n\n\"It is all very well for you,\" said Lily, \"and I think that Bernard\nis the luckiest fellow in the world; but it will not do for me. I\nknow in what college I'll take my degree, and I wish they'd let me\nwrite the letters after my name as the men do.\"\n\n\"What letters, Lily?\"\n\n\"O.M., for Old Maid. I don't see why it shouldn't be as good as B.A.\nfor Bachelor of Arts. It would mean a great deal more.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\n\nTHE SHATTERED TREE.\n\n\nWhen Mrs. Arabin saw Johnny in the middle of that day, she could\nhardly give him much encouragement. And yet she felt by no means sure\nthat he might not succeed even yet. Lily had been very positive in\nher answers, and yet there had been something, either in her words\nor in the tone of her voice, which had made Mrs. Arabin feel that\neven Lily was not quite sure of herself. There was still room for\nrelenting. Nothing, however, had been said which could justify her in\nbidding John Eames simply \"to go in and win.\" \"I think he is light of\nheart,\" Lily had said. Those were the words which, of all that had\nbeen spoken, most impressed themselves on Mrs. Arabin's memory. She\nwould not repeat them to her friend, but she would graft upon them\nsuch advice as she had to give him.\n\nAnd this she did, telling him that she thought that perhaps Lily\ndoubted his actual earnestness. \"I would marry her this moment,\" said\nJohnny. But that was not enough, as Mrs. Arabin knew, to prove his\nearnestness. Many men, fickle as weathercocks, are ready to marry\nat the moment,--are ready to marry at the moment, because they are\nfickle, and think so little about it. \"But she hears, perhaps, of\nyour liking other people,\" said Mrs. Arabin. \"I don't care a straw\nfor any other person,\" said Johnny. \"I wonder whether if I was to\nshut myself up in a cage for six months, it would do any good?\" \"If\nshe had the keeping of the cage, perhaps it might,\" said Mrs. Arabin.\nShe had nothing more to say to him on that subject, but to tell him\nthat Miss Dale would expect him that afternoon at half-past five. \"I\ntold her that you would come to wish her good-by, and she promised to\nsee you.\"\n\n\"I wish she'd say she wouldn't see me. Then there would be some\nchance,\" said Johnny.\n\nBetween him and Mrs. Arabin the parting was very affectionate. She\ntold him how thankful she was for his kindness in coming to her,\nand how grateful she would ever be,--and the dean also,--for his\nattention to her. \"Remember, Mr. Eames, that you will always be most\nwelcome at the deanery of Barchester. And I do hope that before long\nyou may be there with your wife.\" And so they parted.\n\nHe left her at about two, and went to Mr. Toogood's office in Bedford\nRow. He found his uncle, and the two went out to lunch together in\nHolborn. Between them there was no word said about Lily Dale, and\nJohn was glad to have some other subject in his mind for half an\nhour. Toogood was full of his triumph about Mr. Crawley and of his\nsuccesses in Barsetshire. He gave John a long account of his visit\nto Plumstead, and expressed his opinion that if all clergymen were\nlike the archdeacon there would not be so much room for Dissenters.\n\"I've seen a good many parsons in my time,\" said Toogood; \"but I\ndon't think I ever saw such a one as him. You know he is a clergyman\nsomehow, and he never lets you forget it; but that's about all. Most\nof 'em are never contented without choking you with their white\ncravats all the time you're with 'em. As for Crawley himself,\" Mr.\nToogood continued, \"he's not like anybody else that ever was born,\nsaint or sinner, parson or layman. I never heard of such a man in all\nmy experience. Though he knew where he got the cheque as well as I\nknow it now, he wouldn't say so, because the dean had said it wasn't\nso. Somebody ought to write a book about it,--indeed they ought.\"\nThen he told the whole story of Dan Stringer, and how he had found\nDan out, looking at the top of Dan's hat through the little aperture\nin the wall of the inn parlour. \"When I saw the twitch in his hat,\nJohn, I knew he had handled the cheque himself. I don't mean to say\nthat I'm sharper than another man, and I don't think so; but I do\nmean to say that when you are in any difficulty of that sort, you\nought to go to a lawyer. It's his business, and a man does what is\nhis business with patience and perseverance. It's a pity, though,\nthat that scoundrel should get off.\" Then Eames gave his uncle an\naccount of his Italian trip, to and fro, and was congratulated also\nupon his success. John's great triumph lay in the fact that he had\nbeen only two nights in bed, and that he would not have so far\ncondescended on those occasions but for the feminine weakness of his\nfellow-traveller. \"We shan't forget it all in a hurry,--shall we,\nJohn?\" said Mr. Toogood, in a pleasant voice, as they parted at the\ndoor of the luncheon-house in Holborn. Toogood was returning to his\noffice, and John Eames was to prepare himself for his last attempt.\n\nHe went home to his lodgings, intending at first to change his\ndress,--to make himself smart for the work before him,--but after\nstanding for a moment or two leaning on the chest of drawers in his\nbed-room, he gave up this idea. \"After all that's come and gone,\" he\nsaid to himself, \"if I cannot win her as I am now, I cannot win her\nat all.\" And then he swore to himself a solemn oath, resolving that\nhe would repeat the purport of it to Lily herself,--that this should\nbe the last attempt. \"What's the use of it? Everybody ridicules me.\nAnd I am ridiculous. I am an ass. It's all very well wanting to be\nprime minister; but if you can't be prime minister, you must do\nwithout being prime minister.\" Then he attempted to sing the old\nsong--\"Shall I, sighing in despair, die because a woman's fair? If\nshe be not fair for me, what care I how fair she be?\" But he did\ncare, and he told himself that the song did him no good. As it was\nnot time for him as yet to go to Lily, he threw himself on the sofa,\nand strove to read a book. Then all the weary nights of his journey\nprevailed over him, and he fell asleep.\n\nWhen he awoke it wanted a quarter to six. He sprang up, and rushing\nout, jumped into a cab. \"Berkeley Square,--as hard as you can go,\" he\nsaid. \"Number --.\" He thought of Rosalind, and her counsels to lovers\nas to the keeping of time, and reflected that in such an emergency as\nhis, he might really have ruined himself by that unfortunate slumber.\nWhen he got to Mrs. Thorne's door he knocked hurriedly, and bustled\nup to the drawing-room as though everything depended on his saving a\nminute. \"I'm afraid I'm ever so much behind my time,\" he said.\n\n\"It does not matter in the least,\" said Lily. \"As Mrs. Arabin said\nthat perhaps you might call, I would not be out of the way. I\nsupposed that Sir Raffle was keeping you and that you wouldn't come.\"\n\n\"Sir Raffle was not keeping me. I fell asleep. That is the truth of\nit.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry that you should have been disturbed!\"\n\n\"Do not laugh at me, Lily,--to-day. I had been travelling a good\ndeal, and I suppose I was tired.\"\n\n\"I won't laugh at you,\" she said, and of a sudden her eyes became\nfull of tears,--she did not know why. But there they were, and she\nwas ashamed to put up her handkerchief, and she could not bring\nherself to turn away her face, and she had no resource but that he\nshould see them.\n\n\"Lily!\" he said.\n\n\"What a paladin you have been, John, rushing all about Europe on your\nfriend's behalf!\"\n\n\"Don't talk about that.\"\n\n\"And such a successful paladin too! Why am I not to talk about it? I\nam going home to-morrow, and I mean to talk about nothing else for a\nweek. I am so very, very, very glad that you have saved your cousin.\"\nThen she did put up her handkerchief, making believe that her tears\nhad been due to Mr. Crawley. But John Eames knew better than that.\n\n\"Lily,\" he said, \"I've come for the last time. It sounds as though I\nmeant to threaten you; but you won't take it in that way. I think you\nwill know what I mean. I have come for the last time--to ask you to\nbe my wife.\" She had got up to greet him when he entered, and they\nwere both still standing. She did not answer him at once, but turning\naway from him walked towards the window. \"You knew why I was coming\nto-day, Lily?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Arabin told me. I could not be away when you were coming, but\nperhaps it would have been better.\"\n\n\"Is it so? Must it be so? Must you say that to me, Lily? Think of it\nfor a moment, dear.\"\n\n\"I have thought of it.\"\n\n\"One word from you, yes or no, spoken now is to be everything to me\nfor always. Lily, cannot you say yes?\" She did not answer him, but\nwalked further away from him to another window. \"Try to say yes. Look\nround at me with one look that may only half mean it;--that may tell\nme that it shall not positively be no for ever.\" I think that she\nalmost tried to turn her face to him; but be that as it may, she kept\nher eyes steadily fixed upon the window-pane. \"Lily,\" he said, \"it is\nnot that you are hard-hearted,--perhaps not altogether that you do\nnot like me. I think that you believe things against me that are not\ntrue.\" As she heard this she moved her foot angrily upon the carpet.\nShe had almost forgotten M. D., but now he had reminded her of the\nnote. She assured herself that she had never believed anything\nagainst him except on evidence that was incontrovertible. But she\nwas not going to speak to him on such a matter as that! It would\nnot become her to accuse him. \"Mrs. Arabin tells me that you doubt\nwhether I am in earnest,\" he said.\n\nUpon hearing this she flashed round upon him almost angrily. \"I never\nsaid that.\"\n\n\"If you will ask me for any token of earnestness, I will give it\nyou.\"\n\n\"I want no token.\"\n\n\"The best sign of earnestness a man can give generally in such a\nmatter, is to show how ready he is to be married.\"\n\n\"I never said anything about earnestness.\"\n\n\"At the risk of making you angry I will go on, Lily. Of course when\nyou tell me that you will have nothing to say to me, I try to amuse\nmyself\"--\"Yes; by writing love-letters to M. D.,\" said Lily to\nherself.--\"What is a poor fellow to do? I tell you fairly that when\nI leave you I swear to myself that I will make love to the first girl\nI can see who will listen to me--to twenty, if twenty will let me.\nI feel I have failed, and it is so I punish myself for my failure.\"\nThere was something in this which softened her brow, though she did\nnot intend that it should be so; and she turned away again, that he\nmight not see that her brow was softened. \"But, Lily, the hope ever\ncomes back again, and then neither the one nor the twenty are of\navail,--even to punish me. When I look forward and see what it might\nbe if you were with me, how green it all looks and how lovely, in\nspite of all the vows I have made, I cannot help coming back again.\"\nShe was now again near the window, and he had not followed her. As\nshe neither turned towards him nor answered him, he moved from the\ntable near which he was standing on to the rug before the fire, and\nleaned with both his elbows on the mantelpiece. He could still watch\nher in the mirror over the fireplace, and could see that she was\nstill seeming to gaze out upon the street. And had he not moved her?\nI think he had so far moved her now, that she had ceased to think of\nthe woman who had written to her,--that she had ceased to reject him\nin her heart on the score of such levities as that! If there were M.\nD.'s, like sunken rocks, in his course, whose fault was it? He was\nready enough to steer his bark into the tranquil blue waters, if only\nshe would aid him. I think that all his sins on that score were at\nthis moment forgiven him. He had told her now what to him would be\ngreen and beautiful, and she did not find herself able to disbelieve\nhim. She had banished M. D. out of her mind, but in doing so she\nadmitted other reminiscences into it. And then,--was she in a moment\nto be talked out of the resolution of years; and was she to give\nup herself, not because she loved, but because the man who talked\nto her talked so well that he deserved a reward? Was she now to be\nas light, as foolish, as easy, as in those former days from which\nshe had learned her wisdom? A picture of green lovely things could\nbe delicious to her eyes as to his; but even for such a picture as\nthat the price might be too dear! Of all living men,--of all men\nliving in their present lives,--she loved best this man who was now\nwaiting for some word of answer to his words, and she did love him\ndearly; she would have tended him if sick, have supplied him if in\nwant, have mourned for him if dead, with the bitter grief of true\naffection;--but she could not say to herself that he should be her\nlord and master, the head of her house, the owner of herself, the\nruler of her life. The shipwreck to which she had once come, and\nthe fierce regrets which had thence arisen, had forced her to think\ntoo much of these things. \"Lily,\" he said, still facing towards the\nmirror, \"will you not come to me and speak to me?\" She turned round,\nand stood a moment looking at him, and then, having again resolved\nthat it could not be as he wished, she drew near to him. \"Certainly I\nwill speak to you, John. Here I am.\" And she came close to him.\n\n[Illustration: The last Denial.]\n\nHe took both her hands, and looked into her eyes. \"Lily, will you be\nmine?\"\n\n\"No, dear; it cannot be so.\"\n\n\"Why not, Lily?\"\n\n\"Because of that other man.\"\n\n\"And is that to be a bar for ever?\"\n\n\"Yes; for ever.\"\n\n\"Do you still love him?\"\n\n\"No; no, no!\"\n\n\"Then why should this be so?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell, dear. It is so. If you take a young tree and split\nit, it still lives, perhaps. But it isn't a tree. It is only a\nfragment.\"\n\n\"Then be my fragment.\"\n\n\"So I will, if it can serve you to give standing ground to such a\nfragment in some corner of your garden. But I will not have myself\nplanted out in the middle, for people to look at. What there is left\nwould die soon.\" He still held her hands, and she did not attempt to\ndraw them away. \"John,\" she said, \"next to mamma, I love you better\nthan all the world. Indeed I do. I can't be your wife, but you need\nnever be afraid that I shall be more to another than I am to you.\"\n\n\"That will not serve me,\" he said, grasping both her hands till he\nalmost hurt them, but not knowing that he did so. \"That is no good.\"\n\n\"It is all the good that I can do you. Indeed I can do you,--can do\nno one any good. The trees that the storms have splintered are never\nof use.\"\n\n\"And is this to be the end of all, Lily?\"\n\n\"Not of our loving friendship.\"\n\n\"Friendship! I hate the word. I hear some one's step, and I had\nbetter leave you. Good-by.\"\n\n\"Good-by, John. Be kinder than that to me as you are going.\" He\nturned back for a moment, took her hand, and held it tight against\nhis heart, and then he left her. In the hall he met Mrs. Thorne, but,\nas she said afterwards, he had been too much knocked about to be able\nto throw a word to a dog.\n\nTo Mrs. Thorne Lily said hardly a word about John Eames, and when her\ncousin Bernard questioned her about him she was dumb. And in these\ndays she could assume a manner, and express herself with her eyes as\nwell as with her voice, after a fashion, which was apt to silence\nunwelcome questioners, even though they were as intimate with her as\nwas her cousin Bernard. She had described her feelings more plainly\nto her lover than she had ever done to any one,--even to her mother;\nand having done so she meant to be silent on that subject for\nevermore. But of her settled purpose she did say some word to Emily\nDunstable that night. \"I do feel,\" she said, \"that I have got the\nthing settled at last.\"\n\n\"And you have settled it, as you call it, in opposition to the wishes\nof all your friends?\"\n\n\"That is true; and yet I have settled it rightly, and I would not for\nworlds have it unsettled again. There are matters on which friends\nshould not have wishes, or at any rate should not express them.\"\n\n\"Is that meant to be severe to me?\"\n\n\"No; not to you. I was thinking about mamma, and Bell, and my uncle,\nand Bernard, who all seem to think that I am to be looked upon as a\nregular castaway because I am not likely to have a husband of my own.\nOf course you, in your position, must think a girl a castaway who\nisn't going to be married?\"\n\n\"I think that a girl who is going to be married has the best of it.\"\n\n\"And I think a girl who isn't going to be married has the best of\nit;--that's all. But I feel that the thing is done now, and I am\ncontented. For the last six or eight months there has come up, I\nknow not how, a state of doubt which has made me so wretched that I\nhave done literally nothing. I haven't been able to finish old Mrs.\nHeard's tippet, literally because people would talk to me about that\ndearest of all dear fellows, John Eames. And yet all along I have\nknown how it would be,--as well as I do now.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand you, Lily; I can't indeed.\"\n\n\"I can understand myself. I love him so well,--with that intimate,\nclose, familiar affection,--that I could wash his clothes for him\nto-morrow, out of pure personal regard, and think it no shame. He\ncould not ask me to do a single thing for him,--except the one\nthing,--that I would refuse. And I'll go further. I would sooner\nmarry him than any man in the world I ever saw, or, as I believe,\nthat I ever shall see. And yet I am very glad that it is settled.\"\n\nOn the next day Lily Dale went down to the Small House of Allington,\nand so she passes out of our sight. I can only ask the reader to\nbelieve that she was in earnest, and express my own opinion, in this\nlast word that I shall ever write respecting her, that she will live\nand die as Lily Dale.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\n\nTHE ARABINS RETURN TO BARCHESTER.\n\n\nIn these days Mr. Harding was keeping his bed at the deanery, and\nmost of those who saw him declared that he would never again leave\nit. The archdeacon had been slow to believe so, because he had\nstill found his father-in-law able to talk to him;--not indeed with\nenergy, but then Mr. Harding had never been energetic on ordinary\nmatters,--but with the same soft cordial interest in things which had\never been customary with him. He had latterly been much interested\nabout Mr. Crawley, and would make both the archdeacon and Mrs.\nGrantly tell him all that they heard, and what they thought of the\ncase. This of course had been before the all-important news had been\nreceived from Mrs. Arabin. Mr. Harding was very anxious, \"Firstly,\"\nas he said, \"for the welfare of the poor man, of whom I cannot\nbring myself to think ill; and then for the honour of the cloth\nin Barchester.\" \"We are as liable to have black sheep here as\nelsewhere,\" the archdeacon replied. \"But, my dear, I do not think\nthat the sheep is black; and we never have had black sheep in\nBarchester.\" \"Haven't we though?\" said the archdeacon, thinking,\nhowever, of sheep who were black with a different kind of blackness\nfrom this which was now attributed to poor Mr. Crawley,--of a\nblackness which was not absolute blackness to Mr. Harding's milder\neyes. The archdeacon, when he heard his father-in-law talk after this\nfashion, expressed his opinion that he might live yet for years. He\nwas just the man to linger on, living in bed,--as indeed he had\nlingered all his life out of bed. But the doctor who attended him\nthought otherwise, as did also Mrs. Grantly, and as did Mrs. Baxter,\nand as also did Posy. \"Grandpa won't get up any more, will he?\"\nPosy said to Mrs. Baxter. \"I hope he will, my dear; and that very\nsoon.\" \"I don't think he will,\" said Posy, \"because he said he would\nnever see the big fiddle again.\" \"That comes of his being a little\nmelancholy like, my dear,\" said Mrs. Baxter.\n\nMrs. Grantly at this time went into Barchester almost every day, and\nthe archdeacon, who was very often in the city, never went there\nwithout passing half-an-hour with the old man. These two clergymen,\nessentially different in their characters and in every detail of\nconduct, had been so much thrown together by circumstances that\nthe life of each had almost become a part of the life of the other.\nAlthough the fact of Mr. Harding's residence at the deanery had of\nlate years thrown him oftener into the society of the dean than that\nof his other son-in-law, yet his intimacy with the archdeacon had\nbeen so much earlier, and his memories of the archdeacon were so much\nclearer, that he depended almost more upon the rector of Plumstead,\nwho was absent, than he did upon the dean, whom he customarily saw\nevery day. It was not so with his daughters. His Nelly, as he had\nused to call her, had ever been his favourite, and the circumstances\nof their joint lives had been such, that they had never been further\nseparated than from one street of Barchester to another,--and that\nonly for the very short period of the married life of Mrs. Arabin's\nfirst husband. For all that was soft and tender therefore,--which\nwith Mr. Harding was all in the world that was charming to him,--he\nlooked to his youngest daughter; but for authority and guidance and\nwisdom, and for information as to what was going on in the world, he\nhad still turned to his son-in-law the archdeacon,--as he had done\nfor nearly forty years. For so long had the archdeacon been potent as\na clergyman in the diocese, and throughout the whole duration of such\npotency his word had been law to Mr. Harding in most of the affairs\nof life,--a law generally to be obeyed, and if sometimes to be\nbroken, still a law. And now, when all was so nearly over, he would\nbecome unhappy if the archdeacon's visits were far between. Dr.\nGrantly, when he found that this was so, would not allow that they\nshould be far between.\n\n\"He puts me so much in mind of my father,\" the archdeacon said to his\nwife one day.\n\n\"He is not so old as your father was when he died, by many years,\"\nsaid Mrs. Grantly, \"and I think one sees that difference.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and therefore I say that he may still live for years. My\nfather, when he took to his bed at last, was manifestly near his\ndeath. The wonder with him was that he continued to live so long.\nDo you not remember how the London doctor was put out because his\nprophecies were not fulfilled?\"\n\n\"I remember it well;--as if it were yesterday.\"\n\n\"And in that way there is a great difference. My father, who was\nphysically a much stronger man, did not succumb so easily. But the\nlikeness is in their characters. There is the same mild sweetness,\nbecoming milder and sweeter as they increased in age;--a sweetness\nthat never could believe much evil, but that could believe less,\nand still less, as the weakness of age came on them. No amount of\nevidence would induce your father to think that Mr. Crawley stole\nthat money.\" This was said of course before the telegram had come\nfrom Venice.\n\n\"As far as that goes I agree with him,\" said Mrs. Grantly, who had\nher own reasons for choosing to believe Mr. Crawley to be innocent.\n\"If your son, my dear, is to marry a man's daughter, it will be as\nwell that you should at least be able to say that you do not believe\nthat man to be a thief.\"\n\n\"That is neither here nor there,\" said the archdeacon. \"A jury must\ndecide it.\"\n\n\"No jury in Barsetshire shall decide it for me,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"I'm sick of Mr. Crawley, and I'm sorry I spoke of him,\" said the\narchdeacon. \"But look at Mrs. Proudie. You'll agree that she was not\nthe most charming woman in the world.\"\n\n\"She certainly was not,\" said Mrs. Grantly, who was anxious to\nencourage her husband, if she could do so without admitting anything\nwhich might injure herself afterwards.\n\n\"And she was at one time violently insolent to your father. And even\nthe bishop thought to trample upon him. Do you remember the bishop's\npreaching against your father's chaunting? If I ever forget it!\" And\nthe archdeacon slapped his closed fist against his open hand.\n\n\"Don't, dear; don't. What is the good of being violent now?\"\n\n\"Paltry little fool! It will be long enough before such a chaunt as\nthat is heard in any English cathedral again.\" Then Mrs. Grantly got\nup and kissed her husband, but he, somewhat negligent of the kiss,\nwent on with his speech. \"But your father remembers nothing of it,\nand if there was a single human being who shed a tear in Barchester\nfor that woman, I believe it was your father. And it was the same\nwith mine. It came to that at last, that I could not bear to speak\nto him of any shortcoming as to one of his own clergymen. I might as\nwell have pricked him with a penknife. And yet they say men become\nheartless and unfeeling as they grow old!\"\n\n\"Some do, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes; the heartless and unfeeling do. As the bodily strength fails\nand the power of control becomes lessened, the natural aptitude of\nthe man pronounces itself more clearly. I take it that that is it.\nHad Mrs. Proudie lived to be a hundred and fifty, she would have\nspoken spiteful lies on her deathbed.\" Then Mrs. Grantly told\nherself that her husband, should he live to be a hundred and fifty,\nwould still be expressing his horror of Mrs. Proudie,--even on his\ndeathbed.\n\nAs soon as the letter from Mrs. Arabin had reached Plumstead, the\narchdeacon and his wife arranged that they would both go together to\nthe deanery. There were the double tidings to be told,--those of Mr.\nCrawley's assured innocence, and those also of Mrs. Arabin's instant\nreturn. And as they went together various ideas were passing through\ntheir minds in reference to the marriage of their son with Grace\nCrawley. They were both now reconciled to it. Mrs. Grantly had long\nceased to feel any opposition to it, even though she had not seen\nGrace; and the archdeacon was prepared to give way. Had he not\npromised that in a certain case he would give way, and had not that\ncase now come to pass? He had no wish to go back from his word. But\nhe had a difficulty in this,--that he liked to make all the affairs\nof his life matter for enjoyment, almost for triumph; but how was\nhe to be triumphant over this marriage, or how even was he to enjoy\nit, seeing that he had opposed it so bitterly? Those posters, though\nthey were now pulled down, had been up on all barn ends and walls,\npatent--alas, too patent--to all the world of Barsetshire! \"What will\nMr. Crawley do now, do you suppose?\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"What will he do?\"\n\n\"Yes; must he go on at Hogglestock?\"\n\n\"What else?\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"It is a pity something could not be done for him after all he has\nundergone. How on earth can he be expected to live there with a\nwife and family, and no private means?\" To this the archdeacon made\nno answer. Mrs. Grantly had spoken almost immediately upon their\nquitting Plumstead, and the silence was continued till the carriage\nhad entered the suburbs of the city. Then Mrs. Grantly spoke again,\nasking a question, with some internal trepidation, which, however,\nshe managed to hide from her husband. \"When poor papa does go, what\nshall you do about St. Ewold's?\" Now, St. Ewold's was a rural parish\nlying about two miles out of Barchester, the living of which was in\nthe gift of the archdeacon, and to which the archdeacon had presented\nhis father-in-law, under certain circumstances, which need not be\nrepeated in this last chronicle of Barsetshire. Have they not been\nwritten in other chronicles? \"When poor papa does go, what will you\ndo about St. Ewold's?\" said Mrs. Grantly, trembling inwardly. A word\ntoo much might, as she well knew, settle the question against Mr.\nCrawley for ever. But were she to postpone the word till too late,\nthe question would be settled as fatally.\n\n\"I haven't thought about it,\" he said sharply. \"I don't like thinking\nof such things while the incumbent is still living.\" Oh, archdeacon,\narchdeacon! unless that other chronicle be a false chronicle, how\nhast thou forgotten thyself and thy past life! \"Particularly not,\nwhen that incumbent is your father,\" said the archdeacon. Mrs.\nGrantly said nothing more about St. Ewold's. She would have said as\nmuch as she had intended to say if she had succeeded in making the\narchdeacon understand that St. Ewold's would be a very nice refuge\nfor Mr. Crawley after all the miseries which he had endured at\nHogglestock.\n\nThey learned as they entered the deanery that Mrs. Baxter had already\nheard of Mrs. Arabin's return. \"O yes, ma'am. Mr. Harding got a\nletter hisself, and I got another,--separate; both from Venice,\nma'am. But when master is to come, nobody seems to know.\" Mrs. Baxter\nknew that the dean had gone to Jerusalem, and was inclined to think\nthat from such distant bournes there was no return for any traveller.\nThe east is always further than the west in the estimation of the\nMrs. Baxters of the world. Had the dean gone to Canada, she would\nhave thought that he might come back to-morrow. But still there was\nthe news to be told of Mr. Crawley, and there was also joy to be\nexpressed at the sudden coming back of the much-wished-for mistress\nof the deanery.\n\n\"It's so good of you to come both together,\" said Mr. Harding.\n\n\"We thought we should be too many for you,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"Too many! O dear, no. I like to have people by me; and as for\nvoices, and noise, and all that, the more the better. But I am weak.\nI'm weak in my legs. I don't think I shall ever stand again.\"\n\n\"Yes, you will,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"We have brought you good news,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"Is it not good news that Nelly will be home this week? You can't\nunderstand what a joy it is to me. I used to think sometimes, at\nnight, that I should never see her again. That she would come back\nin time was all I have had to wish for.\" He was lying on his back,\nand as he spoke he pressed his withered hands together above the\nbedclothes. They could not begin immediately to tell him of Mr.\nCrawley, but as soon as his mind had turned itself away from the\nthoughts of his absent daughter, Mrs. Grantly again reverted to her\nnews.\n\n\"We have come to tell you about Mr. Crawley, papa.\"\n\n\"What about him?\"\n\n\"He is quite innocent.\"\n\n\"I knew it, my dear. I always said so. Did I not always say so,\narchdeacon?\"\n\n\"Indeed you did. I'll give you that credit.\"\n\n\"And is it all found out?\" asked Mr. Harding.\n\n\"As far as he is concerned, everything is found out,\" said Mrs.\nGrantly. \"Eleanor gave him the cheque herself.\"\n\n\"Nelly gave it to him?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa. The dean meant her to give him fifty pounds. But it seems\nshe got to be soft of heart and made it seventy. She had the cheque\nby her, and put it into the envelope with the notes.\"\n\n\"Some of Stringer's people seem to have stolen the cheque from Mr.\nSoames,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"O dear; I hope not.\"\n\n\"Somebody must have stolen it, papa.\"\n\n\"I had hoped not, Susan,\" said Mr. Harding. Both the archdeacon and\nMrs. Grantly knew that it was useless to argue with him on such a\npoint, and so they let that go.\n\nThen they came to discuss Mr. Crawley's present position, and Mr.\nHarding ventured to ask a question or two as to Grace's chance of\nmarriage. He did not often interfere in the family arrangements of\nhis son-in-law,--and never did so when those family arrangements\nwere concerned with high matters. He had hardly opened his mouth\nin reference to the marriage of that August lady who was now the\nMarchioness of Hartletop. And of the Lady Anne, the wife of the Rev.\nCharles Grantly, who was always prodigiously civil to him, speaking\nto him very loud, as though he were deaf because he was old, and\nbringing him cheap presents from London of which he did not take much\nheed,--of her he rarely said a word, or of her children, to either\nof his daughters. But now his grandson, Henry Grantly, was going to\nmarry a girl of whom he felt that he might speak without impropriety.\n\"I suppose it will be a match; won't it, my dears?\"\n\n\"Not a doubt about it,\" said Mrs. Grantly. Mr. Harding looked at his\nson-in-law, but his son-in-law said nothing. The archdeacon did not\neven frown,--but only moved himself a little uneasily in his chair.\n\n\"Dear, dear! What a comfort that must be,\" said the old man.\n\n\"I have not seen her yet,\" said Mrs. Grantly; \"but the archdeacon\ndeclares that she is all the graces rolled into one.\"\n\n\"I never said anything half so absurd,\" replied the archdeacon.\n\n\"But he really is quite in love with her, papa,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\"He confessed to me that he gave her a kiss, and he only saw her once\nfor five minutes.\"\n\n\"I should like to give her a kiss,\" said Mr. Harding.\n\n\"So you shall, papa, and I'll bring her here on purpose. As soon as\never the thing is settled, we mean to ask her to Plumstead.\"\n\n\"Do you though? How nice! How happy Henry will be!\"\n\n\"And if she comes--and of course she will--I'll lose no time in\nbringing her over to you. Nelly must see her of course.\"\n\nAs they were leaving the room Mr. Harding called the archdeacon back,\nand taking him by the hand, spoke one word to him in a whisper. \"I\ndon't like to interfere,\" he said; \"but might not Mr. Crawley have\nSt. Ewold's?\" The archdeacon took up the old man's hand and kissed\nit. Then he followed his wife out of the room, without making any\nanswer to Mr. Harding's question.\n\nThree days after this Mrs. Arabin reached the deanery, and the joy at\nher return was very great. \"My dear, I have been sick for you,\" said\nMr. Harding.\n\n\"Oh, papa, I ought not to have gone.\"\n\n\"Nay, my dear; do not say that. Would it make me happy that you\nshould be a prisoner here for ever? It was only when I seemed to get\nso weak that I thought about it. I felt that it must be near when\nthey bade me not to go to the cathedral any more.\"\n\n\"If I had been here, I could have gone with you, papa.\"\n\n\"It is better as it is. I know now that I was not fit for it. When\nyour sister came to me, I never thought of remonstrating. I knew then\nthat I had seen it for the last time.\"\n\n\"We need not say that yet, papa.\"\n\n\"I did think that when you came home we might crawl there together\nsome warm morning. I did think of that for a time. But it will never\nbe so, dear. I shall never see anything now that I do not see from\nhere,--and not that for long. Do not cry, Nelly. I have nothing to\nregret, nothing to make me unhappy. I know how poor and weak has been\nmy life; but I know how rich and strong is that other life. Do not\ncry, Nelly,--not till I am gone; and then not beyond measure. Why\nshould any one weep for those who go away full of years,--and full of\nhope?\"\n\nOn the day but one following the dean also reached his home. The\nfinal arrangements of his tour, as well as those of his wife, had\nbeen made to depend on Mr. Crawley's trial; for he also had been\nhurried back by John Eames's visit to Florence. \"I should have come\nat once,\" he said to his wife, \"when they wrote to ask me whether\nCrawley had taken the cheque from me, had anybody then told me that\nhe was in actual trouble; but I had no idea then that they were\ncharging him with theft.\"\n\n\"As far as I can learn, they never really suspected him until after\nyour answer had come. They had been quite sure that your answer would\nbe in the affirmative.\"\n\n\"What he must have endured it is impossible to conceive. I shall go\nout to him to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Would he not come to us?\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"I doubt it. I will ask him, of course. I will ask them all here.\nThis about Henry and the girl may make a difference. He has resigned\nthe living, and some of the palace people are doing the duty.\"\n\n\"But he can have it again?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; he can have it again. For the matter of that, I need simply\ngive him back his letter. Only he is so odd,--so unlike other people!\nAnd he has tried to live there, and has failed; and is now in debt. I\nwonder whether Grantly would give him St. Ewold's?\"\n\n\"I wish he would. But you must ask him. I should not dare.\"\n\nAs to the matter of the cheque, the dean acknowledged to his wife at\nlast that he had some recollection of her having told him that she\nhad made the sum of money up to seventy pounds. \"I don't feel certain\nof it now; but I think you may have done so.\" \"I am quite sure I\ncould not have done it without telling you,\" she replied. \"At any\nrate you said nothing of the cheque,\" pleaded the dean. \"I don't\nsuppose I did,\" said Mrs. Arabin. \"I thought that cheques were like\nany other money; but I shall know better for the future.\"\n\nOn the following morning the dean rode over to Hogglestock, and as he\ndrew near to the house of his old friend, his spirits flagged,--for\nto tell the truth, he dreaded the meeting. Since the day on which he\nhad brought Mr. Crawley from a curacy in Cornwall into the diocese of\nBarchester, his friend had been a trouble to him rather than a joy.\nThe trouble had been a trouble of spirit altogether,--not at all of\npocket. He would willingly have picked the Crawleys out from the\npecuniary mud into which they were ever falling, time after time,\nhad it been possible. For, though the dean was hardly to be called a\nrich man, his lines had fallen to him not only in pleasant places,\nbut in easy circumstances;--and Mr. Crawley's embarrassments, though\noverwhelming to him, were not so great as to have been heavy to\nthe dean. But in striving to do this he had always failed, had\nalways suffered, and had generally been rebuked. Crawley would\nattempt to argue with him as to the improper allotment of Church\nendowments,--declaring that he did not do so with any reference\nto his own circumstances, but simply because the subject was one\nnaturally interesting to clergymen. And this he would do, as he was\nwaving off with his hand offers of immediate assistance which were\nindispensable. Then there had been scenes between the dean and Mrs.\nCrawley,--terribly painful,--and which had taken place in direct\ndisobedience to the husband's positive injunctions. \"Sir,\" he had\nonce said to the dean, \"I request that nothing may pass from your\nhands to the hands of my wife.\" \"Tush, tush,\" the dean had answered.\n\"I will have no tushing or pshawing on such a matter. A man's wife is\nhis very own, the breath of his nostril, the blood of his heart, the\nrib from his body. It is for me to rule my wife, and I tell you that\nI will not have it.\" After that the gifts had come from the hands of\nMrs. Arabin;--and then again, after that, in the direst hour of his\nneed, Crawley had himself come and taken money from the dean's hands!\nThe interview had been so painful that Arabin would hardly have been\nable to count the money or to know of what it had consisted, had he\ntaken the notes and cheque out of the envelope in which his wife had\nput them. Since that day the two had not met each other, and since\nthat day these new troubles had come. Arabin as yet knew but little\nof the manner in which they had been borne, except that Crawley had\nfelt himself compelled to resign the living of Hogglestock. He knew\nnothing of Mrs. Proudie's persecution, except what he gathered from\nthe fact of the clerical commission of which he had been informed;\nbut he could imagine that Mrs. Proudie would not lie easy on her\nbed while a clergyman was doing duty almost under her nose, who was\nguilty of the double offence of being accused of a theft, and of\nhaving been put into his living by the dean. The dean, therefore,\nas he rode on, pictured to himself his old friend in a terrible\ncondition. And it might be that even now that condition would hardly\nhave been improved. He was no longer suspected of being a thief; but\nhe could have no money in his pocket; and it might well be that his\nsufferings would have made him almost mad.\n\nThe dean also got down and left his horse at a farm-yard,--as Grantly\nhad done with his carriage; and walked on first to the school. He\nheard voices inside, but could not distinguish from them whether Mr.\nCrawley was there or not. Slowly he opened the door, and looking\nround saw that Jane Crawley was in the ascendant. Jane did not know\nhim at once, but told him when he had introduced himself that her\nfather had gone down to Hoggle End. He had started two hours ago, but\nit was impossible to say when he might be back. \"He sometimes stays\nall day long with the brickmakers,\" said Jane. Her mother was at\nhome, and she would take the dean into the house. As she said this\nshe told him that her father was sometimes better and sometimes\nworse. \"But he has never been so very, very bad, since Henry Grantly\nand mamma's cousin came and told us about the cheque.\" That word\nHenry Grantly made the dean understand that there might yet be a ray\nof sunshine among the Crawleys.\n\n\"There is papa,\" said Jane, as they got to the gate. Then they waited\nfor a few minutes till Mr. Crawley came up, very hot, wiping the\nsweat from his forehead.\n\n\"Crawley,\" said the dean, \"I cannot tell you how glad I am to see\nyou, and how rejoiced I am that this accusation has fallen off from\nyou.\"\n\n\"Verily the news came in time, Arabin,\" said the other; \"but it was a\nnarrow pinch--a narrow pinch. Will you not enter, and see my wife?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\n\nMR. CRAWLEY SPEAKS OF HIS COAT.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt this time Grace had returned home from Framley. As long as the\nterrible tragedy of the forthcoming trial was dragging itself on she\nhad been content to stay away, at her mother's bidding. It has not\nbeen possible in these pages to tell of all the advice that had been\ngiven to the ladies of the Crawley family in their great difficulty,\nand of all the assistance that had been offered. The elder Lady\nLufton and the younger, and Mrs. Robarts had continually been in\nconsultation on the subject; Mrs. Grantly's opinion had been asked\nand given; and even the Miss Prettymans and Mrs. Walker had found\nmeans of expressing themselves. The communications to Mrs. Crawley\nhad been very frequent,--though they had not of course been allowed\nto reach the ears of Mr. Crawley. What was to be done when the living\nshould be gone and Mr. Crawley should be in prison? Some said that he\nmight be there for six weeks, and some for two years. Old Lady Lufton\nmade anxious inquiries about Judge Medlicote, before whom it was\nsaid that the trial would be taken. Judge Medlicote was a Dissenter,\nand old Lady Lufton was in despair. When she was assured by\nsome liberally-disposed friend that this would certainly make no\ndifference, she shook her head woefully. \"I don't know why we are\nto have Dissenters at all,\" she said, \"to try people who belong to\nthe Established Church.\" When she heard that Judge Medlicote would\ncertainly be the judge, she made up her mind that two years would be\nthe least of it. She would not have minded it, she said, if he had\nbeen a Roman Catholic. And whether the punishment might be for six\nweeks or for two years, what should be done with the family? Where\nshould they be housed? how should they be fed? What should be done\nwith the poor man when he came out of prison? It was a case in which\nthe generous, soft-hearted old Lady Lufton was almost beside herself.\n\"As for Grace,\" said young Lady Lufton, \"it will be a great deal\nbetter that we should keep her amongst us. Of course she will become\nMrs. Grantly, and it will be nicer for her that it should be so.\" In\nthose days the posters had been seen, and the flitting to Pau had\nbeen talked of, and the Framley opinion was that Grace had better\nremain at Framley till she should be carried off to Pau. There were\nschemes, too, about Jane. But what was to be done for the wife? And\nwhat was to be done for Mr. Crawley? Then came the news from Mrs.\nArabin, and all interest in Judge Medlicote was at an end.\n\nBut even now, after this great escape, what was to be done? As to\nGrace, she had felt the absolute necessity of being obedient to her\nfriends,--with the consent of course of her mother,--during the\ngreat tribulation of her family. Things were so bad that she had\nnot the heart to make them worse by giving any unnecessary trouble\nas to herself. Having resolved,--and having made her mother so\nunderstand,--that on one point she would guide herself by her own\nfeelings, she was contented to go hither and thither as she was\ntold, and to do as she was bid. Her hope was that Miss Prettyman\nwould allow her to go back to her teaching, but it had come to be\nunderstood among them all that nothing was to be said on that subject\ntill the trial should be over. Till that time she would be passive.\nBut then, as I have said, had come the news from Mrs. Arabin, and\nGrace, with all the others, understood that there would be no trial.\nWhen this was known and acknowledged, she declared her purpose of\ngoing back to Hogglestock. She would go back at once. When asked both\nby Lady Lufton and by Mrs. Robarts why she was in so great a haste,\nshe merely said that it must be so. She was, as it were, absolved\nfrom her passive obedience to Framley authorities by the diminution\nof the family misfortunes.\n\nMrs. Robarts understood the feeling by which Grace was hurried away.\n\"Do you know why she is so obstinate?\" Lady Lufton asked.\n\n\"I think I do,\" said Mrs. Robarts.\n\n\"And what is it?\"\n\n\"Should Major Grantly renew his offer to her she is under a pledge to\naccept him now.\"\n\n\"Of course he will renew it, and of course she will accept him.\"\n\n\"Just so. But she prefers that he should come for her to her own\nhouse,--because of its poverty. If he chooses to seek her there, I\ndon't think she will make much difficulty.\" Lady Lufton demurred to\nthis, not however with anger, and expressed a certain amount of mild\ndispleasure. She did not quite see why Major Grantly should not be\nallowed to come and do his love-making comfortably, where there was\na decent dinner for him to eat, and chairs and tables and sofas and\ncarpets. She said that she thought that something was due to Major\nGrantly. She was in truth a little disappointed that she was not\nallowed to have her own way, and to arrange the marriage at Framley\nunder her own eye. But, through it all, she appreciated Grace; and\nthey who knew her well and heard what she said upon the occasion,\nunderstood that her favour was not to be withdrawn. All young women\nwere divided by old Lady Lufton into sheep and goats,--very white\nsheep and very black goats;--and Grace was to be a sheep. Thus it\ncame to pass that Grace Crawley was at home when the dean visited\nHogglestock. \"Mamma,\" she said, looking out of the window, \"there is\nthe dean with papa at the gate.\"\n\n\"It was a narrow squeak--a very narrow squeak,\" Mr. Crawley had said\nwhen his friend congratulated him on his escape. The dean felt at\nthe moment that not for many years had he heard the incumbent of\nHogglestock speak either of himself or of anything else with so\nmanifest an attempt at jocularity. Arabin had expected to find the\nman broken down by the weight of his sorrows, and lo! at the first\nmoment of their first interview he himself began to ridicule them!\nCrawley having thus alluded to the narrow squeak had asked his\nvisitor to enter the house and see his wife.\n\n\"Of course I will,\" said Arabin, \"but I will speak just a word to you\nfirst.\" Jane, who had accompanied the dean from the school, now left\nthem, and went into the house to her mother. \"My wife cannot forgive\nherself about the cheque,\" continued he.\n\n\"There is nothing to be forgiven,\" said Mr. Crawley; \"nothing.\"\n\n\"She feels that what she did was awkward and foolish. She ought never\nto have paid a cheque away in such a manner. She knows that now.\"\n\n\"It was given,--not paid,\" said Crawley; and as he spoke something\nof the black cloud came back upon his face. \"And I am well aware\nhow hard Mrs. Arabin strove to take away from the alms she bestowed\nthe bitterness of the sting of eleemosynary aid. If you please,\nArabin, we will not talk any more of that. I can never forget that\nI have been a beggar, but I need not make my beggary the matter of\nconversation. I hope the Holy Land has fulfilled your expectation?\"\n\n\"It has more than done so,\" said the dean, bewildered by the sudden\nchange.\n\n\"For myself, it is, of course, impossible that I should ever\nvisit any scenes except those to which my immediate work may call\nme,--never in this world. The new Jerusalem is still within my\nreach,--if it be not forfeited by pride and obstinacy; but the old\nJerusalem I can never behold. Methinks, because it is so, I would\nsooner stand with my foot on Mount Olivet, or drink a cup of water\nin the village of Bethany, than visit any other spot within the\ntraveller's compass. The sources of the Nile, of which men now talk\nso much,--I see it in the papers and reviews which the ladies at\nFramley are so good as to send to my wife,--do not interest me much.\nI have no ambition to climb Mont Blanc or the Matterhorn; Rome makes\nmy mouth water but little, nor even Athens much. I can realize\nwithout seeing all that Athens could show me, and can fancy that the\nexisting truth would destroy more than it would build up. But to have\nstood on Calvary!\"\n\n\"We don't know where Calvary was,\" said the dean.\n\n\"I fancy that I should know,--should know enough,\" said the illogical\nand unreasonable Mr. Crawley. \"Is it true that you can look over\nfrom the spot on which He stood as He came across the brow of the\nhill, and see the huge stones of the Temple placed there by Solomon's\nmen,--as He saw them;--right across the brook Cedron, is it not?\"\n\n\"It is all there, Crawley,--just as your knowledge of it tells you.\"\n\n\"In the privilege of seeing those places I can almost envy a man\nhis--money.\" The last word he uttered after a pause. He had been\nabout to say that under such temptation he could almost envy a man\nhis promotion; but he bethought himself that on such an occasion as\nthis it would be better that he should spare the dean. \"And now, if\nyou wish it, we will go in. I fancy that I see my wife at the window,\nas though she were waiting for us.\" So saying, he strode on along the\nlittle path, and the dean was fain to follow him, even though he had\nsaid so little of all that he had intended to say.\n\nAs soon as he was with Mrs. Crawley he repeated his apology about\nthe cheque, and found himself better able to explain himself than he\ncould do when alone with her husband. \"Of course, it has been our\nfault,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Mrs. Crawley, \"how can you have been in fault when\nyour only object was to do us good?\" But, nevertheless, the dean took\nthe blame upon his own shoulders, or, rather upon those of his wife,\nand declared himself to be responsible for all the trouble about the\ncheque.\n\n\"Let it go,\" said Crawley, after sitting for awhile in silence; \"let\nit pass.\"\n\n\"You cannot wonder, Crawley,\" said the dean, \"that I should have felt\nmyself obliged to speak of it.\"\n\n\"For the future it will be well that it should be forgotten,\" said\nCrawley; \"or, if not forgotten, treated as though forgotten. And now,\ndean, what must I do about the living?\"\n\n\"Just resume it, as though nothing had happened.\"\n\n\"But that may hardly be done without the bishop's authority. I speak,\nof course, with deference to your higher and better information on\nsuch subjects. My experience in the taking up and laying down of\nlivings has not been extended. But it seemeth to me that though it\nmay certainly be in your power to nominate me again to the perpetual\ncuracy of this parish,--presuming your patronage to be unlimited and\nnot to reach you in rotation only,--yet the bishop may demand to\ninstitute again, and must so demand, unless he pleases to permit that\nmy letter to him shall be revoked and cancelled.\"\n\n\"Of course he will do anything of that kind. He must know the\ncircumstances as well as you and I do.\"\n\n\"At present they tell me that he is much afflicted by the death of\nhis wife, and, therefore, can hardly be expected to take immediate\naction. There came here on the last Sunday one Mr. Snapper, his\nlordship's chaplain.\"\n\n\"We all know Snapper,\" said the dean. \"Snapper is not a bad little\nfellow.\"\n\n\"I say nothing of his being bad, my friend, but merely mention the\nfact that on Sunday morning last he performed the service in our\nchurch. On the Sunday previous, one Mr. Thumble was here.\"\n\n\"We all know Thumble, too,\" said the dean; \"or, at least, know\nsomething about him.\"\n\n\"He has been a thorn in our sides,\" said Mrs. Crawley, unable to\nrestrain the expression of her dislike when Mr. Thumble's name was\nmentioned.\n\n\"Nay, my dear, nay;--do not allow yourself the use of language so\nstrong against a brother. Our flesh at that time was somewhat prone\nto fester, and little thorns made us very sore.\"\n\n\"He is a horrible man,\" said Jane, almost in a whisper; but the words\nwere distinctly audible by the dean.\n\n\"They need not come any more,\" said Arabin.\n\n\"That is where I fear we differ. I think they must come,--or some\nothers in their place,--till the bishop shall have expressed his\npleasure to the contrary. I have submitted myself to his lordship,\nand, having done so, feel that I cannot again go up into my pulpit\ntill he shall have authorized me to do so. For a time, Arabin, I\ncombated the bishop, believing,--then and now,--that he put forth his\nhand against me after a fashion which the law had not sanctioned. And\nI made bold to stand in his presence and to tell him that I would not\nobey him, except in things legal. But afterwards, when he proceeded\nformally, through the action of a commission, I submitted myself. And\nI regard myself still as being under submission.\"\n\nIt was impossible to shake him. Arabin remained there for more than\nan hour, trying to pass on to another subject, but being constantly\nbrought back by Mr. Crawley himself to the fact of his own dependent\nposition. Nor would he condescend to supplicate the bishop. It was,\nhe surmised, the duty of Dr. Tempest, together with the other four\nclergymen, to report to the bishop on the question of the alleged\ntheft; and then doubtless the bishop, when he had duly considered\nthe report, and,--as Mr. Crawley seemed to think was essentially\nnecessary,--had sufficiently recovered from the grief at his wife's\ndeath, would, at his leisure, communicate his decision to Mr.\nCrawley. Nothing could be more complete than Mr. Crawley's humility\nin reference to the bishop; and he never seemed to be tired of\ndeclaring that he had submitted himself!\n\nAnd then the dean, finding it to be vain to expect to be left alone\nwith Mr. Crawley for a moment,--in vain also to wait for a proper\nopening for that which he had to say,--rushed violently at his other\nsubject. \"And now, Mrs. Crawley,\" he said, \"Mrs. Arabin wishes you\nall to come over to the deanery for a while and stay with us.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Arabin is too kind,\" said Mrs. Crawley, looking across at her\nhusband.\n\n\"We should like it of all things,\" said the dean, with perhaps more\nof good nature than of truth. \"Of course you must have been knocked\nabout a good deal.\"\n\n\"Indeed we have,\" said Mrs. Crawley.\n\n\"And till you are somewhat settled again, I think that the change of\nscene would be good for all of you. Come, Crawley, I'll talk to you\nevery evening about Jerusalem for as long as you please;--and then\nthere will perhaps come back to us something of the pleasantness\nof old days.\" As she heard this Mrs. Crawley's eyes became full of\ntears, and she could not altogether hide them. What she had endured\nduring the last four months had almost broken her spirit. The burden\nhad at last been too heavy for her strength. \"You cannot fancy,\nCrawley, how often I have thought of the old days and wished that\nthey might return. I have found it very hard to get an opportunity of\nsaying so much to you; but I will say it now.\"\n\n\"It may hardly be as you say,\" said Crawley, grimly.\n\n\"You mean that the old days can never be brought back?\"\n\n\"Assuredly they cannot. But it was not that that I meant. It may not\nbe that I and mine should transfer ourselves to your roof and sojourn\nthere.\"\n\n\"Why should you not?\"\n\n\"The reasons are many, and on the face of things. The reason,\nperhaps, the most on the face is to be found in my wife's gown, and\nin my coat.\" This Mr. Crawley said very gravely, looking neither to\nthe right nor to the left, nor at the face of any of them, nor at his\nown garment, nor at hers, but straight before him; and when he had\nso spoken he said not a word further,--not going on to dilate on his\npoverty as the dean expected that he would do.\n\n\"At such a time such reasons should stand for nothing,\" said the\ndean.\n\n\"And why not now as they always do, and always must till the power\nof tailors shall have waned, and the daughters of Eve shall toil and\nspin no more? Like to like is true, and should be held to be true, of\nall societies and of all compacts for co-operation and mutual living.\nHere, where, if I may venture to say so, you and I are like to\nlike;--for the new gloss of your coat,\"--the dean, as it happened,\nhad on at the moment a very old coat, his oldest coat, selected\nperhaps with some view to this special visit,--\"does not obtrude\nitself in my household, as would the threadbare texture of mine in\nyours;--I can open my mouth to you and converse with you at my ease;\nyou are now to me that Frank Arabin who has so often comforted me\nand so often confuted me; whom I may perhaps on an occasion have\nconfuted--and perhaps have comforted. But were I sitting with you in\nyour library in Barchester, my threadbare coat would be too much for\nme. I should be silent, if not sullen. I should feel the weight of\nall my poverty, and the greater weight of all your wealth. For my\nchildren, let them go. I have come to know that they will be better\naway from me.\"\n\n\"Papa!\" said Jane.\n\n\"Papa does not mean it,\" said Grace, coming up to him and standing\nclose to him.\n\nThere was silence amongst them for a few moments, and then the master\nof the house shook himself,--literally shook himself, till he had\nshaken off the cloud. He had taken Grace by the hand, and thrusting\nout the other arm had got it round Jane's waist. \"When a man has\ngirls, Arabin,\" he said, \"as you have, but not big girls yet like\nGrace here, of course he knows that they will fly away.\"\n\n\"I shall not fly away,\" said Jane.\n\n\"I don't know what papa means,\" said Grace.\n\nUpon the whole the dean thought it the pleasantest visit he had ever\nmade to Hogglestock, and when he got home he told his wife that he\nbelieved that the accusation made against Mr. Crawley had done him\ngood. \"I could not say a word in private to her,\" he said, \"but I\ndid promise that you would go and see her.\" On the very next day Mrs.\nArabin went over, and I think that the visit was a comfort to Mrs.\nCrawley.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXX.\n\nMISS DEMOLINES DESIRES TO BECOME A FINGER-POST.\n\n\nJohn Eames had passed Mrs. Thorne in the hall of her own house almost\nwithout noticing her as he took his departure from Lily Dale. She had\ntold him as plainly as words could speak that she could not bring\nherself to be his wife,--and he had believed her. He had sworn to\nhimself that if he did not succeed now he would never ask her again.\n\"It would be foolish and unmanly to do so,\" he said to himself as he\nrushed along the street towards his club. No! That romance was over.\nAt last there had come an end to it! \"It has taken a good bit out of\nme,\" he said, arresting his steps suddenly that he might stand still\nand think of it all. \"By George, yes! A man doesn't go through that\nkind of thing without losing some of the caloric. I couldn't do it\nagain if an angel came in my way.\" He went to his club, and tried to\nbe jolly. He ordered a good dinner, and got some man to come and dine\nwith him. For an hour or so he held himself up, and did appear to be\njolly. But as he walked home at night, and gave himself time to think\nover what had taken place with deliberation, he stopped in the gloom\nof a deserted street and leaning against the rails burst into tears.\nHe had really loved her and she was never to be his. He had wanted\nher,--and it is so painful a thing to miss what you want when you\nhave done your very best to obtain it! To struggle in vain always\nhurts the pride; but the wound made by the vain struggle for a woman\nis sorer than any other wound so made. He gnashed his teeth, and\nstruck the iron railings with his stick;--and then he hurried home,\nswearing that he would never give another thought to Lily Dale. In\nthe dead of the night, thinking of it still, he asked himself whether\nit would not be a fine thing to wait another ten years, and then go\nto her again. In such a way would he not make himself immortal as a\nlover beyond any Jacob or any Leander?\n\nThe next day he went to his office and was very grave. When Sir\nRaffle complimented him on being back before his time, he simply said\nthat when he had accomplished that for which he had gone, he had, of\ncourse, come back. Sir Raffle could not get a word out from him about\nMr. Crawley. He was very grave, and intent upon his work. Indeed\nhe was so serious that he quite afflicted Sir Raffle,--whose mock\nactivity felt itself to be confounded by the official zeal of his\nprivate secretary. During the whole of that day Johnny was resolving\nthat there could be no cure for his malady but hard work. He would\nnot only work hard at the office if he remained there, but he would\ntake to heavy reading. He rather thought that he would go deep into\nGreek and do a translation, or take up the exact sciences and make\na name for himself that way. But as he had enough for the life of a\nsecluded literary man without his salary, he rather thought that he\nwould give up his office altogether. He had a mutton chop at home\nthat evening, and spent his time in endeavouring to read out loud to\nhimself certain passages from the Iliad;--for he had bought a Homer\nas he returned from his office. At nine o'clock he went, half-price,\nto the Strand Theatre. How he met there his old friend Boulger and\nwent afterwards to \"The Cock\" and had a supper need not here be told\nwith more accurate detail.\n\nOn the evening of the next day he was bound by his appointment to go\nto Porchester Terrace. In the moments of his enthusiasm about Homer\nhe had declared to himself that he would never go near Miss Demolines\nagain. Why should he? All that kind of thing was nothing to him\nnow. He would simply send her his compliments and say that he was\nprevented by business from keeping his engagement. She, of course,\nwould go on writing to him for a time, but he would simply leave\nher letters unanswered, and the thing, of course, would come to an\nend at last. He afterwards said something to Boulger about Miss\nDemolines,--but that was during the jollity of their supper,--and he\nthen declared that he would follow out that little game. \"I don't see\nwhy a fellow isn't to amuse himself, eh, Boulger, old boy?\" Boulger\nwinked and grinned, and said that some amusements were dangerous. \"I\ndon't think that there is any danger there,\" said Johnny. \"I don't\nbelieve she is thinking of that kind of thing herself;--not with me\nat least. What she likes is the pretence of a mystery; and as it is\namusing I don't see why a fellow shouldn't indulge her.\" But that\ndetermination was pronounced after two mutton chops at \"The Cock,\"\nbetween one and two o'clock in the morning. On the next day he was\ncooler and wiser. Greek he thought might be tedious as he discovered\nthat he would have to begin again from the very alphabet. He would\ntherefore abandon that idea. Greek was not the thing for him, but\nhe would take up the sanitary condition of the poor in London. A\nfellow could be of some use in that way. In the meantime he would\nkeep his appointment with Miss Demolines, simply because it was an\nappointment. A gentleman should always keep his word to a lady!\n\nHe did keep his appointment with Miss Demolines, and was with her\nalmost precisely at the hour she had named. She received him with a\nmysterious tranquillity which almost perplexed him. He remembered,\nhowever, that the way to enjoy the society of Miss Demolines was to\ntake her in all her moods with perfect seriousness, and was therefore\nvery tranquil himself. On the present occasion she did not rise as he\nentered the room, and hardly spoke as she tendered to him the tips\nof her fingers to be touched. As she said almost nothing, he said\nnothing at all, but sank into a chair and stretched his legs out\ncomfortably before him. It had been always understood between them\nthat she was to bear the burden of the conversation.\n\n\"You'll have a cup of tea?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes;--if you do.\" Then the page brought the tea, and John Eames\namused himself with swallowing three slices of very thin bread and\nbutter.\n\n\"None for me,--thanks,\" said Madalina. \"I rarely eat after dinner,\nand not often much then. I fancy that I should best like a world in\nwhich there was no eating.\"\n\n\"A good dinner is a very good thing,\" said John. And then there was\nagain silence. He was aware that some great secret was to be told to\nhim during this evening, but he was much too discreet to show any\ncuriosity upon that subject. He sipped his tea to the end, and then,\nhaving got up to put his cup down, stood on the rug with his back to\nthe fire. \"Have you been out to-day?\" he asked.\n\n\"Indeed I have.\"\n\n\"And you are tired?\"\n\n\"Very tired!\"\n\n\"Then perhaps I had better not keep you up.\"\n\n\"Your remaining will make no difference in that respect. I don't\nsuppose that I shall be in bed for the next four hours. But do as you\nlike about going.\"\n\n\"I am in no hurry,\" said Johnny. Then he sat down again, stretched\nout his legs and made himself comfortable.\n\n\"I have been to see that woman,\" said Madalina after a pause.\n\n\"What woman?\"\n\n\"Maria Clutterbuck,--as I must always call her; for I cannot bring\nmyself to pronounce the name of that poor wretch who was done to\ndeath.\"\n\n\"He blew his brains out in delirium tremens,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"And what made him drink?\" said Madalina with emphasis. \"Never mind.\nI decline altogether to speak of it. Such a scene as I have had! I\nwas driven at last to tell her what I thought of her. Anything so\ncallous, so heartless, so selfish, so stone-cold, and so childish,\nI never saw before! That Maria was childish and selfish I always\nknew;--but I thought there was some heart,--a vestige of heart. I\nfound to-day that there was none,--none. If you please we won't speak\nof her any more.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"You need not wonder that I am tired and feverish.\"\n\n\"That sort of thing is fatiguing, I dare say. I don't know whether we\ndo not lose more than we gain by those strong emotions.\"\n\n\"I would rather die and go beneath the sod at once, than live without\nthem,\" said Madalina.\n\n\"It's a matter of taste,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"It is there that that poor wretch is so deficient. She is thinking\nnow, this moment, of nothing but her creature comforts. That tragedy\nhas not even stirred her pulses.\"\n\n\"If her pulses were stirred ever so, that would not make her happy.\"\n\n\"Happy! Who is happy? Are you happy?\"\n\nJohnny thought of Lily Dale and paused before he answered. No;\ncertainly he was not happy. But he was not going to talk about his\nunhappiness to Miss Demolines! \"Of course I am;--as jolly as a\nsandboy,\" he said.\n\n\"Mr. Eames,\" said Madalina raising herself on her sofa, \"if you can\nnot express yourself in language more suitable to the occasion and to\nthe scene than that, I think that you had better--\"\n\n\"Hold my tongue.\"\n\n\"Just so;--though I should not have chosen myself to use words so\nabruptly discourteous.\"\n\n\"What did I say;--jolly as a sandboy? There is nothing wrong in that.\nWhat I meant was, that I think that this world is a very good sort of\nworld, and that a man can get along in it very well, if he minds his\n_p_'s and _q_'s.\"\n\n\"But suppose it's a woman?\"\n\n\"Easier still.\"\n\n\"And suppose she does not mind her _p_'s and _q_'s?\"\n\n\"Women always do.\"\n\n\"Do they? Your knowledge of women goes as far as that, does it? Tell\nme fairly;--do you think you know anything about women?\" Madalina\nas she asked the question, looked full into his face, and shook her\nlocks and smiled. When she shook her locks and smiled, there was a\ncertain attraction about her of which John Eames was fully sensible.\nShe could throw a special brightness into her eyes, which, though it\nprobably betokened nothing truly beyond ill-natured mischief, seemed\nto convey a promise of wit and intellect.\n\n\"I don't mean to make any boast about it,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"I doubt whether you know anything. The pretty simplicity of your\nexcellent Lily Dale has sufficed for you.\"\n\n\"Never mind about her,\" said Johnny impatiently.\n\n\"I do not mind about her in the least. But an insight into that sort\nof simplicity will not teach you the character of a real woman. You\ncannot learn the flavour of wines by sipping sherry and water. For\nmyself I do not think that I am simple. I own it fairly. If you must\nhave simplicity, I cannot be to your taste.\"\n\n\"Nobody likes partridge always,\" said Johnny laughing.\n\n\"I understand you, sir. And though what you say is not complimentary,\nI am willing to forgive that fault for its truth. I don't consider\nmyself to be always partridge, I can assure you. I am as changeable\nas the moon.\"\n\n\"And as fickle?\"\n\n\"I say nothing about that, sir. I leave you to find that out. It is\na man's business to discover that for himself. If you really do know\naught of women--\"\n\n\"I did not say that I did.\"\n\n\"But if you do, you will perhaps have discovered that a woman may be\nas changeable as the moon, and yet as true as the sun;--that she may\nflit from flower to flower, quite unheeding while no passion exists,\nbut that a passion fixes her at once. Do you believe me?\" Now she\nlooked into his eyes again, but did not smile and did not shake her\nlocks.\n\n\"Oh yes;--that's true enough. And when they have a lot of children,\nthen they become steady as milestones.\"\n\n\"Children!\" said Madalina, getting up and walking about the room.\n\n\"They do have them you know,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Do you mean to say, sir, that I should be a milestone?\"\n\n\"A finger-post,\" said Johnny, \"to show a fellow the way he ought to\ngo.\"\n\nShe walked twice across the room without speaking. Then she came and\nstood opposite to him, still without speaking,--and then she walked\nabout again. \"What could a woman better be, than a finger-post, as\nyou call it, with such a purpose?\"\n\n\"Nothing better, of course;--though a milestone to tell a fellow his\ndistances, is very good.\"\n\n\"Psha!\"\n\n\"You don't like the idea of being a milestone.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Then you can make up your mind to be a finger-post.\"\n\n\"John, shall I be a finger-post for you?\" She stood and looked at him\nfor a moment or two, with her eyes full of love, as though she were\ngoing to throw herself into his arms. And she would have done so, no\ndoubt, instantly, had he risen to his legs. As it was, after having\ngazed at him for the moment with her love-laden eyes, she flung\nherself on the sofa, and hid her face among the cushions.\n\nHe had felt that it was coming for the last quarter of an hour,--and\nhe had felt, also, that he was quite unable to help himself. He\ndid not believe that he should ever be reduced to marrying Miss\nDemolines, but he did see plainly enough that he was getting into\ntrouble; and yet, for his life, he could not help himself. The moth\nwho flutters round the light knows that he is being burned, and yet\nhe cannot fly away from it. When Madalina had begun to talk to him\nabout women in general, and then about herself, and had told him that\nsuch a woman as herself,--even one so liable to the disturbance of\nviolent emotions,--might yet be as true and honest as the sun, he\nknew that he ought to get up and make his escape. He did not exactly\nknow how the catastrophe would come, but he was quite sure that if he\nremained there he would be called upon in some way for a declaration\nof his sentiments,--and that the call would be one which all his wit\nwould not enable him to answer with any comfort. It was very well\njesting about milestones, but every jest brought him nearer to the\nprecipice. He perceived that however ludicrous might be the image\nwhich his words produced, she was clever enough in some way to turn\nthat image to her own purpose. He had called a woman a finger-post,\nand forthwith she had offered to come to him and be finger-post to\nhim for life! What was he to say to her? It was clear that he must\nsay something. As at this moment she was sobbing violently, he could\nnot pass the offer by as a joke. Women will say that his answer\nshould have been very simple, and his escape very easy. But men will\nunderstand that it is not easy to reject even a Miss Demolines when\nshe offers herself for matrimony. And, moreover,--as Johnny bethought\nhimself at this crisis of his fate,--Lady Demolines was no doubt at\nthe other side of the drawing-room door, ready to stop him, should\nhe attempt to run away. In the meantime the sobs on the sofa became\nviolent, and still more violent. He had not even yet made up his\nmind what to do, when Madalina, springing to her feet, stood before\nhim, with her curls wildly waving and her arms extended. \"Let it be\nas though it were unsaid,\" she exclaimed. John Eames had not the\nslightest objection; but, nevertheless, there was a difficulty even\nin this. Were he simply to assent to this latter proposition, it\ncould not be but that the feminine nature of Miss Demolines would be\noutraged by so uncomplimentary an acquiescence. He felt that he ought\nat least to hesitate a little,--to make some pretence at closing upon\nthe rich offer that had been made to him; only that were he to show\nany such pretence the rich offer would, no doubt, be repeated. His\nMadalina had twitted him in the earlier part of their interview with\nknowing nothing of the nature of women. He did know enough to feel\nassured that any false step on his part now would lead him into very\nserious difficulties. \"Let it be as though it were unsaid! Why, oh,\nwhy, have I betrayed myself?\" exclaimed Madalina.\n\nJohn now had risen from his chair, and coming up to her took her by\nthe arm and spoke a word. \"Compose yourself,\" he said. He spoke in\nhis most affectionate voice, and he stood very close to her.\n\n\"How easy it is to bid me do that,\" said Madalina. \"Tell the sea to\ncompose itself when it rages!\"\n\n\"Madalina!\" said he.\n\n\"Well,--what of Madalina? Madalina has lost her own respect,--for\never.\"\n\n\"Do not say that.\"\n\n\"Oh, John,--why did you ever come here? Why? Why did we meet at\nthat fatal woman's house? Or, meeting so, why did we not part as\nstrangers? Sir, why have you come here to my mother's house day after\nday, evening after evening, if--. Oh, heavens, what am I saying? I\nwonder whether you will scorn me always?\"\n\n\"I will never scorn you.\"\n\n\"And you will pardon me?\"\n\n\"Madalina, there is nothing to pardon.\"\n\n\"And--you will love me?\" Then, without waiting for any more\nencouraging reply,--unable, probably, to wait a moment longer, she\nsunk upon his bosom. He caught her, of course,--and at that moment\nthe drawing-room door was opened, and Lady Demolines entered the\nchamber. John Eames detected at a glance the skirt of the old white\ndressing gown which he had seen whisking away on the occasion of his\nlast visit at Porchester Terrace. But on the present occasion Lady\nDemolines wore over it a short red opera cloak, and the cap on her\nhead was ornamented with coloured ribbons. \"What is this,\" she said,\n\"and why am I thus disturbed?\" Madalina lay motionless in Johnny's\narms, while the old woman glowered at him from under the coloured\nribbons. \"Mr. Eames, what is it that I behold?\" she said.\n\n[Illustration: \"What is it that I behold?\"]\n\n\"Your daughter, madam, seems to be a little unwell,\" said Johnny.\nMadalina kept her feet firm upon the ground, but did not for a moment\nlose her purchase against Johnny's waistcoat. Her respirations came\nvery strong, but they came a good deal stronger when he mentioned the\nfact that she was not so well as she might be.\n\n\"Unwell!\" said Lady Demolines. And John was stricken at the moment\nwith a conviction that her ladyship must have passed the early years\nof her life upon the stage. \"You would trifle with me, sir. Beware\nthat you do not trifle with her,--with Madalina!\"\n\n\"My mother,\" said Madalina; but still she did not give up her\npurchase, and the voice seemed to come half from her and half from\nJohnny. \"Come to me, my mother.\" Then Lady Demolines hastened to her\ndaughter, and Madalina between them was gradually laid at her length\nupon the sofa. The work of laying her out, however, was left almost\nentirely to the stronger arm of Mr. John Eames. \"Thanks, mother,\"\nsaid Madalina; but she had not as yet opened her eyes, even for an\ninstant. \"Perhaps I had better go now,\" said Johnny. The old woman\nlooked at him with eyes which asked him whether \"he didn't wish he\nmight get it\" as plainly as though the words had been pronounced. \"Of\ncourse I'll wait if I can be of any service,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"I must know more of this, sir, before you leave the house,\" said\nLady Demolines. He saw that between them both there might probably\nbe a very bad quarter of an hour in store for him; but he swore to\nhimself that no union of dragon and tigress should extract from him\na word that could be taken as a promise of marriage.\n\nThe old woman was now kneeling by the head of the sofa, and Johnny\nwas standing close by her side. Suddenly Madalina opened her\neyes,--opened them very wide and gazed around her. Then slowly she\nraised herself on the sofa, and turned her face first upon her mother\nand then upon Johnny. \"You here, mamma!\" she said.\n\n\"Dearest one, I am near you. Be not afraid,\" said her ladyship.\n\n\"Afraid! Why should I be afraid? John! My own John! Mamma, he is my\nown.\" And she put out her arms to him, as though calling to him to\ncome to her. Things were now very bad with John Eames,--so bad that\nhe would have given a considerable lump out of Lord De Guest's legacy\nto be able to escape at once into the street. The power of a woman,\nwhen she chooses to use it recklessly, is, for the moment, almost\nunbounded.\n\n\"I hope you find yourself a little better,\" said John, struggling to\nspeak, as though he were not utterly crushed by the occasion.\n\nLady Demolines slowly raised herself from her knees, helping herself\nwith her hands against the shoulder of the sofa,--for though still\nvery clever, she was old and stiff,--and then offered both her hands\nto Johnny. Johnny cautiously took one of them, finding himself unable\nto decline them both. \"My son!\" she exclaimed; and before he knew\nwhere he was the old woman had succeeded in kissing his nose and his\nwhiskers. \"My son!\" she said again.\n\nNow the time had come for facing the dragon and the tigress in their\nwrath. If they were to be faced at all, the time for facing them had\ncertainly arrived. I fear that John's heart sank low in his bosom\nat that moment. \"I don't quite understand,\" he said, almost in a\nwhisper. Madalina put out one arm towards him, and the fingers\ntrembled. Her lips were opened, and the white row of interior ivory\nmight be seen plainly; but at the present conjuncture of affairs\nshe spoke not a word. She spoke not a word; but her arm remained\nstretched out towards him, and her fingers did not cease to tremble.\n\n\"You do not understand!\" said Lady Demolines, drawing herself back,\nand looking, in her short open cloak, like a knight who has donned\nhis cuirass, but has forgotten to put on his leg-gear. And she shook\nthe bright ribbons of her cap, as a knight in his wrath shakes the\ncrest of his helmet. \"You do not understand, Mr. Eames! What is it,\nsir, that you do not understand?\"\n\n\"There is some misconception, I mean,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Mother!\" said Madalina, turning her eyes from her recreant lover to\nher tender parent; trembling all over, but still keeping her hand\nextended. \"Mother!\"\n\n\"My darling! But leave him to me, dearest. Compose yourself.\"\n\n\"'Twas the word that he said--this moment; before he pressed me to\nhis heart.\"\n\n\"I thought you were fainting,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Sir!\" And Lady Demolines, as she spoke, shook her crest, and glared\nat him, and almost flew at him in her armour.\n\n\"It may be that nature has given way with me, and that I have been in\na dream,\" said Madalina.\n\n\"That which mine eyes saw was no dream,\" said Lady Demolines. \"Mr.\nEames, I have given to you the sweetest name that can fall from an\nold woman's lips. I have called you my son.\"\n\n\"Yes, you did, I know. But, as I said before, there is some mistake.\nI know how proud I ought to be, and how happy, and all that kind of\nthing. But--\" Then there came a screech from Madalina, which would\nhave awakened the dead, had there been any dead in that house. The\npage and the cook, however, took no notice of it, whether they were\nawakened or not. And having screeched, Madalina stood erect upon the\nfloor, and she also glared upon her recreant lover. The dragon and\nthe tiger were there before him now, and he knew that it behoved him\nto look to himself. As he had a battle to fight, might it not be best\nto put a bold face upon it? \"The truth is,\" said he, \"that I don't\nunderstand this kind of thing at all.\"\n\n\"Not understand it, sir?\" said the dragon.\n\n\"Leave him to me, mother,\" said the tigress, shaking her head again,\nbut with a kind of shake differing from that which she had used\nbefore. \"This is my business, and I'll have it out for myself. If he\nthinks I'm going to put up with his nonsense he's mistaken. I've been\nstraightforward and above board with you, Mr. Eames, and I expect to\nbe treated in the same way in return. Do you mean to tell my mother\nthat you deny that we are engaged?\"\n\n\"Well; yes; I do. I'm very sorry, you know, if I seem to be\nuncivil--\"\n\n\"It's because I've no brother,\" said the tigress. \"He thinks that\nI have no man near me to protect me. But he shall find that I can\nprotect myself. John Eames, why are you treating me like this?\"\n\n\"I shall consult my cousin the serjeant to-morrow,\" said the dragon.\n\"In the meantime he must remain in this house. I shall not allow the\nfront door to be unlocked for him.\"\n\nThis, I think, was the bitterest moment of all to Johnny. To be\nconfined all night in Lady Demolines' drawing-room would, of itself,\nbe an intolerable nuisance. And then the absurdity of the thing,\nand the story that would go abroad! And what should he say to the\ndragon's cousin the serjeant, if the serjeant should be brought upon\nthe field before he was able to escape from it? He did not know what\na serjeant might not do to him in such circumstances. There was one\nthing no serjeant should do, and no dragon! Between them all they\nshould never force him to marry the tigress. At this moment Johnny\nheard a tramp along the pavement, and he rushed to the window. Before\nthe dragon or even the tigress could arrest him, he had thrown up\nthe sash, and had appealed in his difficulty to the guardian of\nthe night. \"I say, old fellow,\" said Johnny, \"don't you stir from\nthat till I tell you.\" The policeman turned his bull's-eye upon the\nwindow, and stood perfectly motionless. \"Now, if you please, I'll say\ngood-night,\" said Johnny. But, as he spoke, he still held the open\nwindow in his hand.\n\n\"What means this violence in my house?\" said the dragon.\n\n\"Mamma, you had better let him go,\" said the tigress. \"We shall know\nwhere to find him.\"\n\n\"You will certainly be able to find me,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"Go,\" said the dragon, shaking her crest,--shaking all her armour at\nhim, \"dastard, go!\"\n\n\"Policeman,\" shouted Johnny, while he still held the open window in\nhis hand, \"mind you don't stir till I come out.\" The bull's-eye was\nshifted a little, but the policeman spoke never a word.\n\n\"I wish you good-night, Lady Demolines,\" said Johnny. \"Good-night,\nMiss Demolines.\" Then he left the window and made a run for the door.\nBut the dragon was there before him.\n\n\"Let him go, mamma,\" said the tigress as she closed the window. \"We\nshall only have a rumpus.\"\n\n\"That will be all,\" said Johnny. \"There isn't the slightest use in\nyour trying to keep me here.\"\n\n\"And are we never to see you again?\" said the tigress, almost\nlanguishing again with one eye.\n\n\"Well; no. What would be the use? No man likes to be shut in, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Go then,\" said the tigress; \"but if you think that this is to be the\nend of it, you'll find yourself wonderfully mistaken. You poor false,\ndrivelling creature! Lily Dale won't touch you with a pair of tongs.\nIt's no use your going to her.\"\n\n\"Go away, sir, this moment, and don't contaminate my room an instant\nlonger by your presence,\" said the dragon, who had observed through\nthe window that the bull's-eye was still in full force before the\nhouse. Then John Eames withdrew, and descending into the hall made\nhis way in the dark to the front door. For aught he knew there might\nstill be treachery in regard to the lock; but his heart was comforted\nas he heard the footfall of the policeman on the door-step. With much\nfumbling he succeeded at last in turning the key and drawing the\nbolt, and then he found himself at liberty in the street. Before he\neven spoke a word to the policeman he went out into the road and\nlooked up at the window. He could just see the figure of the dragon's\nhelmet as she was closing the shutters. It was the last he ever saw\nof Lady Demolines or of her daughter.\n\n\"What was it all about?\" said the policeman.\n\n\"I don't know that I can just tell you,\" said Johnny, searching in\nhis pocket-book for half a sovereign which he tendered to the man.\n\"There was a little difficulty, and I'm obliged to you for waiting.\"\n\n\"There ain't nothing wrong?\" said the man suspiciously, hesitating\nfor a moment before he accepted the coin.\n\n\"Nothing on earth. I'll wait with you, while you have the house\nopened and inquire, if you wish it. The truth is somebody inside\nrefused to have the door opened, and I didn't want to stay there all\nnight.\"\n\n\"They're a rummy couple, if what I hear is true.\"\n\n\"They are a rummy couple,\" said Johnny.\n\n\"I suppose it's all right,\" said the policeman, taking the money. And\nthen John walked off home by himself, turning in his mind all the\ncircumstances of his connection with Miss Demolines. Taking his own\nconduct as a whole, he was rather proud of it; but he acknowledged to\nhimself that it would be well that he should keep himself free from\nthe society of Madalinas for the future.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\n\nBARCHESTER CLOISTERS.\n\n\nOn the morning of the Sunday after the dean's return Mr. Harding was\nlying in his bed, and Posy was sitting on the bed beside him. It was\nmanifest to all now that he became feebler and feebler from day to\nday, and that he would never leave his bed again. Even the archdeacon\nhad shaken his head, and had acknowledged to his wife that the last\nday for her father was near at hand. It would very soon be necessary\nthat he should select another vicar for St. Ewolds.\n\n\"Grandpa won't play cat's-cradle,\" said Posy, as Mrs. Arabin entered\nthe room.\n\n\"No, darling,--not this morning,\" said the old man. He himself knew\nwell enough that he would never play cat's-cradle again. Even that\nwas over for him now.\n\n\"She teases you, papa,\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said he. \"Posy never teases me;\" and he slowly moved\nhis withered hand down outside the bed, so as to hold the child by\nher frock. \"Let her stay with me, my dear.\"\n\n\"Dr. Filgrave is downstairs, papa. You will see him, if he comes up?\"\nNow Dr. Filgrave was the leading physician of Barchester, and nobody\nof note in the city,--or for the matter of that in the eastern\ndivision of the county,--was allowed to start upon the last great\njourney without some assistance from him as the hour of going drew\nnigh. I do not know that he had much reputation for prolonging life,\nbut he was supposed to add a grace to the hour of departure. Mr.\nHarding had expressed no wish to see the doctor,--had rather declared\nhis conviction that Dr. Filgrave could be of no possible service to\nhim. But he was not a man to persevere in his objection in opposition\nto the wishes of the friends around him; and as soon as the\narchdeacon had spoken a word on the subject he assented.\n\n\"Of course, my dear, I will see him.\"\n\n\"And Posy shall come back when he has gone,\" said Mrs. Arabin.\n\n\"Posy will do me more good than Dr. Filgrave I am quite sure;--but\nPosy shall go now.\" So Posy scrambled off the bed, and the doctor was\nushered into the room.\n\n\"A day or two will see the end of it, Mr. Archdeacon;--I should say a\nday or two,\" said the doctor, as he met Dr. Grantly in the hall. \"I\nshould say that a day or two would see the end of it. Indeed I will\nnot undertake that twenty-four hours may not see the close of his\nearthly troubles. He has no suffering, no pain, no disturbing cause.\nNature simply retires to rest.\" Dr. Filgrave, as he said this, made a\nslow falling motion with his hands, which alone on various occasions\nhad been thought to be worth all the money paid for his attendance.\n\"Perhaps you would wish that I should step in in the evening, Mr.\nDean? As it happens, I shall be at liberty.\" The dean of course said\nthat he would take it as an additional favour. Neither the dean nor\nthe archdeacon had the slightest belief in Dr. Filgrave, and yet they\nwould hardly have been contented that their father-in-law should have\ndeparted without him.\n\n\"Look at that man, now,\" said the archdeacon, when the doctor had\ngone, \"who talks so glibly about nature going to rest. I've known\nhim all my life. He's an older man by some months than our dear\nold friend upstairs. And he looks as if he were going to attend\ndeath-beds in Barchester for ever.\"\n\n\"I suppose he is right in what he tells us now?\" said the dean.\n\n\"No doubt he is; but my belief doesn't come from his saying it.\" Then\nthere was a pause as the two church dignitaries sat together, doing\nnothing, feeling that the solemnity of the moment was such that it\nwould be hardly becoming that they should even attempt to read. \"His\ngoing will make an old man of me,\" said the archdeacon. \"It will be\ndifferent with you.\"\n\n\"It will make an old woman of Eleanor, I fear.\"\n\n\"I seem to have known him all my life,\" said the archdeacon. \"I have\nknown him ever since I left college; and I have known him as one\nman seldom knows another. There is nothing that he has done,--as I\nbelieve, nothing that he has thought,--with which I have not been\ncognizant. I feel sure that he never had an impure fancy in his mind,\nor a faulty wish in his heart. His tenderness has surpassed the\ntenderness of woman; and yet, when an occasion came for showing it,\nhe had all the spirit of a hero. I shall never forget his resignation\nof the hospital, and all that I did and said to make him keep it.\"\n\n\"But he was right?\"\n\n\"As Septimus Harding he was, I think, right; but it would have been\nwrong in any other man. And he was right, too, about the deanery.\"\nFor promotion had once come in Mr. Harding's way, and he, too, might\nhave been Dean of Barchester. \"The fact is, he never was wrong.\nHe couldn't go wrong. He lacked guile, and he feared God,--and a\nman who does both will never go far astray. I don't think he ever\ncoveted aught in his life,--except a new case for his violoncello and\nsomebody to listen to him when he played it.\" Then the archdeacon got\nup, and walked about the room in his enthusiasm; and, perhaps, as\nhe walked some thoughts as to the sterner ambition of his own life\npassed through his mind. What things had he coveted? Had he lacked\nguile? He told himself that he had feared God,--but he was not sure\nthat he was telling himself true even in that.\n\nDuring the whole of the morning Mrs. Arabin and Mrs. Grantly were\nwith their father, and during the greater part of the day there was\nabsolute silence in the room. He seemed to sleep; and they, though\nthey knew that in truth he was not sleeping, feared to disturb him\nby a word. About two Mrs. Baxter brought him his dinner, and he did\nrouse himself, and swallowed a spoonful or two of soup and half\na glass of wine. At this time Posy came to him, and stood at the\nbedside, looking at him with her great wide eyes. She seemed to be\naware that life had now gone so far with her dear old friend that she\nmust not be allowed to sit upon his bed again. But he put his hand\nout to her, and she held it, standing quite still and silent. When\nMrs. Baxter came to take away the tray, Posy's mother got up, and\nwhispered a word to the child. Then Posy went away, and her eyes\nnever beheld the old man again. That was a day which Posy will\nnever forget,--not though she should live to be much older than her\ngrandfather was when she thus left him.\n\n\"It is so sweet to have you both here,\" he said, when he had been\nlying silent for nearly an hour after the child had gone. Then they\ngot up, and came and stood close to him. \"There is nothing left for\nme to wish, my dears;--nothing.\" Not long after that he expressed a\ndesire that the two husbands,--his two sons-in-law,--should come to\nhim; and Mrs. Arabin went to them, and brought them to the room. As\nhe took their hands he merely repeated the same words again. \"There\nis nothing left for me to wish, my dears;--nothing.\" He never spoke\nagain above his breath; but ever and anon his daughters, who watched\nhim, could see that he was praying. The two men did not stay with him\nlong, but returned to the gloom of the library. The gloom had almost\nbecome the darkness of night, and they were still sitting there\nwithout any light, when Mrs. Baxter entered the room. \"The dear\ngentleman is no more,\" said Mrs. Baxter; and it seemed to the\narchdeacon that the very moment of his father's death had repeated\nitself. When Dr. Filgrave called he was told that his services could\nbe of no further use. \"Dear, dear!\" said the doctor. \"We are all\ndust, Mrs. Baxter; are we not?\" There were people in Barchester who\npretended to know how often the doctor had repeated this little\nformula during the last thirty years.\n\nThere was no violence of sorrow in the house that night; but there\nwere aching hearts, and one heart so sore that it seemed that no cure\nfor its anguish could ever reach it. \"He has always been with me,\"\nMrs. Arabin said to her husband, as he strove to console her. \"It was\nnot that I loved him better than Susan, but I have felt so much more\nof his loving tenderness. The sweetness of his voice has been in my\nears almost daily since I was born.\"\n\nThey buried him in the cathedral which he had loved so well, and\nin which nearly all the work of his life had been done; and all\nBarchester was there to see him laid in his grave within the\ncloisters. There was no procession of coaches, no hearse, nor was\nthere any attempt at funereal pomp. From the dean's side door, across\nthe vaulted passage, and into the transept,--over the little step\nupon which he had so nearly fallen when last he made his way out of\nthe building,--the coffin was carried on men's shoulders. It was\nbut a short journey from his bedroom to his grave. But the bell had\nbeen tolling sadly all the morning, and the nave and the aisles and\nthe transepts, close up to the door leading from the transept into\nthe cloister, were crowded with those who had known the name and\nthe figure and the voice of Mr. Harding as long as they had known\nanything. Up to this day no one would have said specially that Mr.\nHarding was a favourite in the town. He had never been forward enough\nin anything to become the acknowledged possessor of popularity. But,\nnow that he was gone, men and women told each other how good he had\nbeen. They remembered the sweetness of his smile, and talked of\nloving little words which he had spoken to them,--either years ago\nor the other day, for his words had always been loving. The dean and\nthe archdeacon came first, shoulder to shoulder, and after them came\ntheir wives. I do not know that it was the proper order for mourning,\nbut it was a touching sight to be seen, and was long remembered in\nBarchester. Painful as it was for them, the two women would be there,\nand the two sisters would walk together;--nor would they go before\ntheir husbands. Then there were the archdeacon's two sons,--for the\nRev. Charles Grantly had come to Plumstead on the occasion. And in\nthe vaulted passage which runs between the deanery and the end of\nthe transept all the chapter, with the choir, the prebendaries, with\nthe fat old chancellor, the precentor, and the minor canons down\nto the little choristers,--they all were there, and followed in at\nthe transept door, two by two. And in the transept they were joined\nby another clergyman whom no one had expected to see that day. The\nbishop was there, looking old and worn,--almost as though he were\nunconscious of what he was doing. Since his wife's death no one had\nseen him out of the palace or of the palace grounds till that day.\nBut there he was,--and they made way for him into the procession\nbehind the two ladies,--and the archdeacon, when he saw it, resolved\nthat there should be peace in his heart, if peace might be possible.\n\nThey made their way into the cloisters where the grave had been\ndug,--as many as might be allowed to follow. The place indeed was\nopen to all who chose to come; but they who had only slightly known\nthe man, refrained from pressing upon those who had a right to stand\naround his coffin. But there was one other there whom the faithful\nchronicler of Barchester should mention. Before any other one had\nreached the spot, the sexton and the verger between them had led in\nbetween them, among the graves beneath the cloisters, a blind man,\nvery old, with a wondrous stoop, but who must have owned a grand\nstature before extreme old age had bent him, and they placed him\nsitting on a stone in the corner of the archway. But as soon as the\nshuffling of steps reached his ears, he raised himself with the\naid of his stick, and stood during the service leaning against the\npillar. The blind man was so old that he might almost have been\nMr. Harding's father. This was John Bunce, a bedesman from Hiram's\nHospital,--and none perhaps there had known Mr. Harding better than\nhe had known him. When the earth had been thrown on to the coffin,\nand the service was over, and they were about to disperse, Mrs.\nArabin went up to the old man, and taking his hand between hers\nwhispered a word into his ear. \"Oh, Miss Eleanor,\" he said. \"Oh, Miss\nEleanor!\" Within a fortnight he also was lying within the cathedral\nprecincts.\n\nAnd so they buried Mr. Septimus Harding, formerly Warden of Hiram's\nHospital in the city of Barchester, of whom the chronicler may say\nthat that city never knew a sweeter gentleman or a better Christian.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\n\nTHE LAST SCENE AT HOGGLESTOCK.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe fortnight following Mr. Harding's death was passed very quietly\nat Hogglestock, for during that time no visitor made an appearance in\nthe parish except Mr. Snapper on the Sundays. Mr. Snapper, when he\nhad completed the service on the first of these Sundays, intimated to\nMr. Crawley his opinion that probably that gentleman might himself\nwish to resume the duties on the following Sabbath. Mr. Crawley,\nhowever, courteously declined to do anything of the kind. He said\nthat it was quite out of the question that he should do so without a\ndirect communication made to him from the bishop, or by the bishop's\norder. The assizes had, of course, gone by, and all question of the\ntrial was over. Nevertheless,--as Mr. Snapper said,--the bishop had\nnot, as yet, given any order. Mr. Snapper was of opinion that the\nbishop in these days was not quite himself. He had spoken to the\nbishop about it and the bishop had told him peevishly--\"I must say\nquite peevishly,\" Mr. Snapper had said,--that nothing was to be done\nat present. Mr. Snapper was not the less clearly of opinion that Mr.\nCrawley might resume his duties. To this, however, Mr. Crawley would\nnot assent.\n\nBut even during the fortnight Mr. Crawley had not remained altogether\nneglected. Two days after Mr. Harding's death he had received a note\nfrom the dean in which he was advised not to resume the duties at\nHogglestock for the present. \"Of course you can understand that we\nhave a sad house here at present,\" the dean had said. \"But as soon as\never we are able to move in the matter we will arrange things for you\nas comfortably as we can. I will see the bishop myself.\" Mr. Crawley\nhad no ambitious idea of any comfort which might accrue to him beyond\nthat of an honourable return to his humble preferment at Hogglestock;\nbut, nevertheless, he was in this case minded to do as the dean\ncounselled him. He had submitted himself to the bishop, and he would\nwait till the bishop absolved him from his submission.\n\nOn the day after the funeral, the bishop had sent his compliments to\nthe dean with the expression of a wish that the dean would call upon\nhim on any early day that might be convenient with reference to the\nposition of Mr. Crawley of Hogglestock. The note was in the bishop's\nown handwriting and was as mild and civil as a bishop's note could\nbe. Of course the dean named an early day for the interview; but it\nwas necessary before he went to the bishop that he should discuss\nthe matter with the archdeacon. If St. Ewolds might be given to Mr.\nCrawley, the Hogglestock difficulties would all be brought to an\nend. The archdeacon, after the funeral, had returned to Plumstead,\nand thither the dean went to him before he saw the bishop. He did\nsucceed,--he and Mrs. Grantly between them,--but with very great\ndifficulty, in obtaining a conditional promise. They had both thought\nthat when the archdeacon became fully aware that Grace was to be his\ndaughter-in-law, he would at once have been delighted to have an\nopportunity of extricating from his poverty a clergyman with whom it\nwas his fate to be so closely connected. But he fought the matter\non twenty different points. He declared at first that as it was his\nprimary duty to give to the people of St. Ewolds the best clergyman\nhe could select for them he could not give the preferment to Mr.\nCrawley, because Mr. Crawley, in spite of all his zeal and piety, was\na man so quaint in his manners and so eccentric in his mode of speech\nas not to be the best clergyman whom he could select. \"What is my\nold friend Thorne to do with a man in his parish who won't drink\na glass of wine with him?\" For Ullathorne, the seat of that Mr.\nWilfred Thorne who had been so guilty in the matter of the foxes,\nwas situated in the parish of St. Ewolds. When Mrs. Grantly proposed\nthat Mr. Thorne's consent should be asked, the archdeacon became very\nangry. He had never heard so unecclesiastical a proposition in his\nlife. It was his special duty to do the best he could for Mr. Thorne,\nbut it was specially his duty to do so without consulting Mr. Thorne\nabout it. As the archdeacon's objection had been argued simply on the\npoint of the glass of wine, both the dean and Mrs. Grantly thought\nthat he was unreasonable. But they had their point to gain, and\ntherefore they only flattered him. They were sure that Mr. Thorne\nwould like to have a clergyman in the parish who would himself be\nclosely connected with the archdeacon. Then Dr. Grantly alleged that\nhe might find himself in a trap. What if he conferred the living of\nSt. Ewolds on Mr. Crawley and after all there should be no marriage\nbetween his son and Grace? \"Of course they'll be married,\" said Mrs.\nGrantly. \"It's all very well for you to say that, my dear; but the\nwhole family are so queer that there is no knowing what the girl may\ndo. She may take up some other fad now, and refuse him point blank.\"\n\"She has never taken up any fad,\" said Mrs. Grantly, who now mounted\nalmost to wrath in defence of her future daughter-in-law, \"and you\nare wrong to say that she has. She has behaved beautifully;--as\nnobody knows better than you do.\" Then the archdeacon gave way so far\nas to promise that St. Ewolds should be offered to Mr. Crawley as\nsoon as Grace Crawley was in truth engaged to Harry Grantly.\n\nAfter that, the dean went to the palace. There had never been any\nquarrelling between the bishop and the dean, either direct or\nindirect;--nor, indeed, had the dean ever quarrelled even with Mrs.\nProudie. But he had belonged to the anti-Proudie faction. He had\nbeen brought into the diocese by the Grantly interest; and therefore,\nduring Mrs. Proudie's life-time, he had always been accounted among\nthe enemies. There had never been any real intimacy between the\nhouses. Each house had been always asked to dine with the other\nhouse once a year; but it had been understood that such dinings were\necclesiastico-official, and not friendly. There had been the same\noutside diocesan civility between even the palace and Plumstead. But\nnow, when the great chieftain of the palace was no more, and the\nstrength of the palace faction was gone, peace, or perhaps something\nmore than peace,--amity, perhaps, might be more easily arranged\nwith the dean than with the archdeacon. In preparation for such\narrangements the bishop had gone to Mr. Harding's funeral.\n\nAnd now the dean went to the palace at the bishop's behest. He\nfound his lordship alone, and was received with almost reverential\ncourtesy. He thought that the bishop was looking wonderfully aged\nsince he last saw him, but did not perhaps take into account the\nabsence of clerical sleekness which was incidental to the bishop's\nprivate life in his private room, and perhaps in a certain measure\nto his recent great affliction. The dean had been in the habit of\nregarding Dr. Proudie as a man almost young for his age,--having\nbeen in the habit of seeing him at his best, clothed in authority,\nredolent of the throne, conspicuous as regarded his apron and outward\nsigns of episcopality. Much of all this was now absent. The bishop,\nas he rose to greet the dean, shuffled with his old slippers, and his\nhair was not brushed so becomingly as used to be the case when Mrs.\nProudie was always near him.\n\nIt was necessary that a word should be said by each as to the loss\nwhich the other had suffered. \"Mr. Dean,\" said his lordship, \"allow\nme to offer you my condolements in regard to the death of that very\nexcellent clergyman and most worthy gentleman, your father-in-law.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my lord. He was excellent and worthy. I do not suppose\nthat I shall live to see any man who was more so. You also have a\ngreat,--a terrible loss.\"\n\n\"O, Mr. Dean, yes; yes, indeed, Mr. Dean. That was a loss.\"\n\n\"And hardly past the prime of life!\"\n\n\"Ah, yes;--just fifty-six,--and so strong! Was she not? At least\neverybody thought so. And yet she was gone in a minute;--gone in a\nminute. I haven't held up my head since, Mr. Dean.\"\n\n\"It was a great loss, my lord; but you must struggle to bear it.\"\n\n\"I do struggle. I am struggling. But it makes one feel so lonely in\nthis great house. Ah, me! I often wish, Mr. Dean, that it had pleased\nProvidence to have left me in some humble parsonage, where duty would\nhave been easier than it is here. But I will not trouble you with all\nthat. What are we to do, Mr. Dean, about this poor Mr. Crawley?\"\n\n\"Mr. Crawley is a very old friend of mine, and a very dear friend.\"\n\n\"Is he? Ah! A very worthy man, I am sure, and one who has been much\ntried by undeserved adversities.\"\n\n\"Most severely tried, my lord.\"\n\n\"Sitting among the potsherds, like Job; has he not, Mr. Dean? Well;\nlet us hope that all that is over. When this accusation about the\nrobbery was brought against him, I found myself bound to interfere.\"\n\n\"He has no complaint to make on that score.\"\n\n\"I hope not. I have not wished to be harsh, but what could I do, Mr.\nDean? They told me that the civil authorities found the evidence so\nstrong against him that it could not be withstood.\"\n\n\"It was very strong.\"\n\n\"And we thought that he should at least be relieved, and we sent for\nDr. Tempest, who is his rural dean.\" Then the bishop, remembering all\nthe circumstances of that interview with Dr. Tempest,--as to which he\nhad ever felt assured that one of the results of it was the death of\nhis wife, whereby there was no longer any \"we\" left in the palace of\nBarchester,--sighed piteously, looking up at the dean with hopeless\nface.\n\n\"Nobody doubts, my lord, that you acted for the best.\"\n\n\"I hope we did. I think we did. And now what shall we do? He has\nresigned his living, both to you and to me, as I hear,--you being\nthe patron. It will simply be necessary, I think, that he should ask\nto have the letters cancelled. Then, as I take it, there need be no\nreinstitution. You cannot think, Mr. Dean, how much I have thought\nabout it all.\"\n\nThen the dean unfolded his budget, and explained to the bishop\nhow he hoped that the living of St. Ewolds, which was, after some\necclesiastical fashion, attached to the rectory of Plumstead, and\nwhich was now vacant by the demise of Mr. Harding, might be conferred\nby the archdeacon upon Mr. Crawley. It was necessary to explain also\nthat this could not be done quite immediately, and in doing this the\ndean encountered some little difficulty. The archdeacon, he said,\nwished to be allowed another week to think about it; and therefore\nperhaps provision for the duties at Hogglestock might yet be made for\na few Sundays. The bishop, the dean said, might easily understand\nthat, after what had occurred, Mr. Crawley would hardly wish to go\nagain into that pulpit, unless he did so as resuming duties which\nwould necessarily be permanent with him. To all this the bishop\nassented, but he was apparently struck with much wonder at the choice\nmade by the archdeacon. \"I should have thought, Mr. Dean,\" he said,\n\"that Mr. Crawley was the last man to have suited the archdeacon's\nchoice.\"\n\n\"The archdeacon and I married sisters, my lord.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah! yes. And he puts the nomination of St. Ewolds at your\ndisposition. I am sure I shall be delighted to institute so worthy\na gentleman as Mr. Crawley.\" Then the dean took his leave of the\nbishop,--as will we also. Poor dear bishop! I am inclined to think\nthat he was right in his regrets as to the little parsonage. Not that\nhis failure at Barchester, and his present consciousness of lonely\nincompetence, were mainly due to any positive inefficiency on his\nown part. He might have been a sufficiently good bishop, had it not\nbeen that Mrs. Proudie was so much more than a sufficiently good\nbishop's wife. We will now say farewell to him, with a hope that the\nlopped tree may yet become green again, and to some extent fruitful,\nalthough all its beautiful head and richness of waving foliage have\nbeen taken from it.\n\nAbout a week after this Henry Grantly rode over from Cosby Lodge to\nHogglestock. It has been just said that though the assizes had passed\nby and though all question of Mr. Crawley's guilt was now set aside,\nno visitor had of late made his way over to Hogglestock. I fancy\nthat Grace Crawley forgot, in the fulness of her memory as to other\nthings, that Mr. Harding, of whose death she heard, had been her\nlover's grandfather,--and that therefore there might possibly be some\ndelay. Had there been much said between the mother and the daughter\nabout the lover, no doubt all this would have been explained;\nbut Grace was very reticent, and there were other matters in the\nHogglestock household which in those days occupied Mrs. Crawley's\nmind. How were they again to begin life? for, in very truth, life\nas it had existed with them before, had been brought to an end. But\nGrace remembered well the sort of compact which existed between\nher and her lover;--the compact which had been made in very words\nbetween herself and her lover's father. Complete in her estimation\nas had been the heaven opened to her by Henry Grantly's offer, she\nhad refused it all,--lest she should bring disgrace upon him. But the\ndisgrace was not certain; and if her father should be made free from\nit, then,--then,--then Henry Grantly ought to come to her and be\nat her feet with all the expedition possible to him. That was her\nreading of the compact. She had once declared, when speaking of the\npossible disgrace which might attach itself to her family and to her\nname, that her poverty did not \"signify a bit.\" She was not ashamed\nof her father,--only of the accusation against her father. Therefore\nshe had hurried home when that accusation was withdrawn, desirous\nthat her lover should tell her of his love,--if he chose to repeat\nsuch telling,--amidst all the poor things of Hogglestock, and not\namong the chairs and tables and good dinners of luxurious Framley.\nMrs. Robarts had given a true interpretation to Lady Lufton of the\nhaste which Grace had displayed. But she need not have been in so\ngreat a hurry. She had been at home already above a fortnight, and\nas yet he had made no sign. At last she said a word to her mother.\n\"Might I not ask to go back to Miss Prettyman's now, mamma?\" \"I\nthink, dear, you had better wait till things are a little settled.\nPapa is to hear again from the dean very soon. You see they are all\nin a great sorrow at Barchester about poor Mr. Harding's death.\"\n\"Grace!\" said Jane, rushing into the house almost speechless, at that\nmoment, \"here he is!--on horseback.\" I do not know why Jane should\nhave talked about Major Grantly as simply \"he.\" There had been no\nconversation among the sisters to justify her in such a mode of\nspeech. Grace had not a moment to put two and two together, so that\nshe might realize the meaning of what her mother had said; but\nnevertheless, she felt at the moment that the man, coming as he had\ndone now, had come with all commendable speed. How foolish had she\nbeen with her wretched impatience!\n\nThere he was certainly, tying his horse up to the railing. \"Mamma,\nwhat am I to say to him?\"\n\n\"Nay, dear; he is your own friend,--of your own making. You must say\nwhat you think fit.\"\n\n\"You are not going?\"\n\n\"I think we had better, dear.\" Then she went, and Jane with her, and\nJane opened the door for Major Grantly. Mr. Crawley himself was away,\nat Hoggle End, and did not return till after Major Grantly had left\nthe parsonage. Jane, as she greeted the grand gentleman, whom she\nhad seen and no more than seen, hardly knew what to say to him.\nWhen, after a minute's hesitation, she told him that Grace was in\nthere,--pointing to the sitting-room door, she felt that she had been\nvery awkward. Henry Grantly, however, did not, I think, feel her\nawkwardness, being conscious of some small difficulties of his own.\nWhen, however, he found that Grace was alone, the task before him at\nonce lost half its difficulties. \"Grace,\" he said, \"am I right to\ncome to you now?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she said. \"I cannot tell.\"\n\n\"Dearest Grace, there is no reason on earth now why you should not be\nmy wife.\"\n\n\"Is there not?\"\n\n\"I know of none,--if you can love me. You saw my father?\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw him.\"\n\n\"And you heard what he said?\"\n\n\"I hardly remember what he said;--but he kissed me, and I thought he\nwas very kind.\"\n\nWhat little attempt Henry Grantly then made, thinking that he could\nnot do better than follow closely the example of so excellent a\nfather, need not be explained with minuteness. But I think that his\nfirst effort was not successful. Grace was embarrassed and retreated,\nand it was not till she had been compelled to give a direct answer\nto a direct question that she submitted to allow his arm round her\nwaist. But when she had answered that question she was almost more\nhumble than becomes a maiden who has just been wooed and won. A\nmaiden who has been wooed and won, generally thinks that it is she\nwho has conquered, and chooses to be triumphant accordingly. But\nGrace was even mean enough to thank her lover. \"I do not know why you\nshould be so good to me,\" she said.\n\n\"Because I love you,\" said he, \"better than all the world.\"\n\n\"But why should you be so good to me as that? Why should you love me?\nI am such a poor thing for a man like you to love.\"\n\n\"I have had the wit to see that you are not a poor thing, Grace;\nand it is thus that I have earned my treasure. Some girls are poor\nthings, and some are rich treasures.\"\n\n\"If love can make me a treasure, I will be your treasure. And if love\ncan make me rich, I will be rich for you.\" After that I think he had\nno difficulty in following in his father's footsteps.\n\nAfter a while Mrs. Crawley came in, and there was much pleasant\ntalking among them, while Henry Grantly sat happily with his love,\nas though waiting for Mr. Crawley's return. But though he was there\nnearly all the morning Mr. Crawley did not return. \"I think he\nlikes the brickmakers better than anybody in all the world, except\nourselves,\" said Grace. \"I don't know how he will manage to get on\nwithout his friends.\" Before Grace had said this, Major Grantly\nhad told all his story, and had produced a letter from his father,\naddressed to Mr. Crawley, of which the reader shall have a copy,\nalthough at this time the letter had not been opened. The letter was\nas follows:--\n\n\n   Plumstead Rectory, -- May, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR SIR,\n\n   You will no doubt have heard that Mr. Harding, the vicar\n   of St. Ewolds, who was the father of my wife and of Mrs.\n   Arabin, has been taken from us. The loss to us of so\n   excellent and so dear a man has been very great. I have\n   conferred with my friend the Dean of Barchester as to a\n   new nomination, and I venture to request your acceptance\n   of the preferment, if it should suit you to move from\n   Hogglestock to St. Ewolds. It may be as well that I should\n   state plainly my reasons for making this offer to a\n   gentleman with whom I am not personally acquainted. Mr.\n   Harding, on his deathbed, himself suggested it, moved\n   thereto by what he had heard of the cruel and undeserved\n   persecution to which you have lately been subjected;\n   as also,--on which point he was very urgent in what he\n   said,--by the character which you bear in the diocese for\n   zeal and piety. I may also add, that the close connection\n   which, as I understand, is likely to take place between\n   your family and mine has been an additional reason for\n   my taking this step, and the long friendship which has\n   existed between you and my wife's brother-in-law, the Dean\n   of Barchester, is a third.\n\n   St. Ewolds is worth \u00c2\u00a3350 per annum, besides the house,\n   which is sufficiently commodious for a moderate family.\n   The population is about twelve hundred, of which more than\n   a half consists of persons dwelling in an outskirt of the\n   city,--for the parish runs almost into Barchester.\n\n   I shall be glad to have your reply with as little delay\n   as may suit your convenience, and in the event of your\n   accepting the offer,--which I sincerely trust you may be\n   enabled to do,--I shall hope to have an early opportunity\n   of seeing you, with reference to your institution to the\n   parish.\n\n   Allow me also to say to you and to Mrs. Crawley that, if\n   we have been correctly informed as to that other event\n   to which I have alluded, we both hope that we may have\n   an early opportunity of making ourselves personally\n   acquainted with the parents of a young lady who is to\n   be so dear to us. As I have met your daughter, I may\n   perhaps be allowed to send her my kindest love. If, as my\n   daughter-in-law, she comes up to the impression which she\n   gave me at our first meeting, I, at any rate, shall be\n   satisfied.\n\n   I have the honour to be, my dear sir,\n   Your most faithful servant,\n\n   THEOPHILUS GRANTLY.\n\n\nThis letter the archdeacon had shown to his wife, by whom it had not\nbeen very warmly approved. Nothing, Mrs. Grantly had said, could be\nprettier than what the archdeacon had said about Grace. Mrs. Crawley,\nno doubt, would be satisfied with that. But Mr. Crawley was such a\nstrange man! \"He will be stranger than I take him to be if he does\nnot accept St. Ewolds,\" said the archdeacon. \"But in offering it,\"\nsaid Mrs. Grantly, \"you have not said a word of your own high opinion\nof his merits.\" \"I have not a very high opinion of them,\" said the\narchdeacon. \"Your father had, and I have said so. And as I have the\nmost profound respect for your father's opinion in such a matter, I\nhave permitted that to overcome my own hesitation.\" This was pretty\nfrom the husband to the wife as it regarded her father, who had now\ngone from them; and, therefore, Mrs. Grantly accepted it without\nfurther argument. The reader may probably feel assured that the\narchdeacon had never, during their joint lives, acted in any church\nmatter upon the advice given to him by Mr. Harding; and it was\nprobably the case also that the living would have been offered to\nMr. Crawley, if nothing had been said by Mr. Harding on the subject;\nbut it did not become Mrs. Grantly even to think of all this. The\narchdeacon, having made his gracious speech about her father, was not\nagain asked to alter his letter. \"I suppose he will accept it,\" said\nMrs. Grantly. \"I should think that he probably may,\" said the\narchdeacon.\n\nSo Grace, knowing what was the purport of the letter, sat with it\nbetween her fingers, while her lover sat beside her, full of various\nplans for the future. This was his first lover's present to her;--and\nwhat a present it was! Comfort, and happiness, and a pleasant home\nfor all her family. \"St. Ewolds isn't the best house in the world,\"\nsaid the major, \"because it is old, and what I call piecemeal; but\nit is very pretty, and certainly nice.\" \"That is just the sort of\nparsonage that I dream about,\" said Jane. \"And the garden is pleasant\nwith old trees,\" said the major. \"I always dream about old trees,\"\nsaid Jane, \"only I'm afraid I'm too old myself to be let to climb up\nthem now.\" Mrs. Crawley said very little, but sat by with her eyes\nfull of tears. Was it possible that, at last, before the world had\nclosed upon her, she was to enjoy something again of the comforts\nwhich she had known in her early years, and to be again surrounded by\nthose decencies of life which of late had been almost banished from\nher home by poverty!\n\nTheir various plans for the future,--for the immediate future,--were\nvery startling. Grace was to go over at once to Plumstead, whither\nEdith had been already transferred from Cosby Lodge. That was all\nvery well; there was nothing very startling or impracticable in\nthat. The Framley ladies, having none of those doubts as to what\nwas coming which had for a while perplexed Grace herself, had taken\nlittle liberties with her wardrobe, which enabled such a visit to be\nmade without overwhelming difficulties. But the major was equally\neager,--or at any rate equally imperious,--in his requisition for\na visit from Mr. and Mrs. Crawley themselves to Plumstead rectory.\nMrs. Crawley did not dare to put forward the plain unadorned reasons\nagainst it, as Mr. Crawley had done when discussing the subject of\na visit to the deanery. Nor could she quite venture to explain that\nshe feared that the archdeacon and her husband would hardly mix well\ntogether in society. With whom, indeed, was it possible that her\nhusband should mix well, after his long and hardly-tried seclusion?\nShe could only plead that both her husband and herself were so little\nused to going out that she feared,--she feared,--she feared she\nknew not what. \"We'll get over all that,\" said the major, almost\ncontemptuously. \"It is only the first plunge that is disagreeable.\"\nPerhaps the major did not know how very disagreeable a first plunge\nmay be!\n\nAt two o'clock Henry Grantly got up to go. \"I should very much like\nto have seen him, but I fear I cannot wait longer. As it is, the\npatience of my horse has been surprising.\" Then Grace walked out with\nhim to the gate, and put her hand upon his bridle as he mounted, and\nthought how wonderful was the power of Fortune, that the goddess\nshould have sent so gallant a gentleman to be her lord and her lover.\n\"I declare I don't quite believe it even yet,\" she said, in the\nletter which she wrote to Lily Dale that night.\n\nIt was four before Mr. Crawley returned to his house, and then he was\nvery weary. There were many sick in these days at Hoggle End, and he\nhad gone from cottage to cottage through the day. Giles Hoggett was\nalmost unable to work from rheumatism, but still was of opinion that\ndoggedness might carry him on. \"It's been a deal o' service to you,\nMuster Crawley,\" he said. \"We hears about it all. If you hadn't a\nbeen dogged, where'd you a been now?\" With Giles Hoggett and others\nhe had remained all the day, and now he came home weary and beaten.\n\"You'll tell him first,\" Grace had said, \"and then I'll give him the\nletter.\" The wife was the first to tell him of the good fortune that\nwas coming.\n\nHe flung himself into the old chair as soon as he entered, and asked\nfor some bread and tea. \"Jane has already gone for it, dear,\" said\nhis wife. \"We have had a visitor here, Josiah.\"\n\n\"A visitor,--what visitor?\"\n\n\"Grace's own friend,--Henry Grantly.\"\n\n\"Grace, come here, that I may kiss you and bless you,\" he said, very\nsolemnly. \"It would seem that the world is going to be very good to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Papa, you must read this letter first.\"\n\n\"Before I kiss my own darling?\" Then she knelt at his feet. \"I\nsee,\" he said, taking the letter; \"it is from your lover's father.\nPeradventure he signifies his consent, which would be surely needful\nbefore such a marriage would be seemly.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Peradventure he signifies his Consent.\"]\n\n\"It isn't about me, papa, at all.\"\n\n\"Not about you? If so, that would be most unpromising. But, in any\ncase, you are my best darling.\" Then he kissed her and blessed her,\nand slowly opened the letter. His wife had now come close to him, and\nwas standing over him, touching him, so that she also could read the\narchdeacon's letter. Grace, who was still in front of him, could see\nthe working of his face as he read it; but even she could not tell\nwhether he was gratified, or offended, or dismayed. When he had got\nas far as the first offer of the presentation, he ceased reading for\na while, and looked round about the room as though lost in thought.\n\"Let me see what further he writes to me,\" he then said; and after\nthat he continued the letter slowly to the end. \"Nay, my child, you\nwere in error in saying that he wrote not about you. 'Tis in writing\nof you he has put some real heart into his words. He writes as though\nhis home would be welcome to you.\"\n\n\"And does he not make St. Ewolds welcome to you, papa?\"\n\n\"He makes me welcome to accept it,--if I may use the word after the\nordinary and somewhat faulty parlance of mankind.\"\n\n\"And you will accept it,--of course?\"\n\n\"I know not that, my dear. The acceptance of a cure of souls is\na thing not to be decided on in a moment,--as is the colour of a\ngarment or the shape of a toy. Nor would I condescend to take this\nthing from the archdeacon's hands, if I thought that he bestowed it\nsimply that the father of his daughter-in-law might no longer be\naccounted poor.\"\n\n\"Does he say that, papa?\"\n\n\"He gives it as a collateral reason, basing his offer first on the\nkindly expressed judgment of one who is now no more. Then he refers\nto the friendship of the dean. If he believed that the judgment of\nhis late father-in-law in so weighty a matter were the best to be\nrelied upon of all that were at his command, then he would have\ndone well to trust to it. But in such case he should have bolstered\nup a good ground for action with no collateral supports which\nare weak,--and worse than weak. However, it shall have my best\nconsideration, whereunto I hope that wisdom will be given me where\nonly such wisdom can be had.\"\n\n\"Josiah,\" said his wife to him, when they were alone, \"you will not\nrefuse it?\"\n\n\"Not willingly,--not if it may be accepted. Alas! you need not urge\nme, when the temptation is so strong!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIII.\n\nMR. CRAWLEY IS CONQUERED.\n\n\nIt was more than a week before the archdeacon received a reply from\nMr. Crawley, during which time the dean had been over at Hogglestock\nmore than once, as had also Mrs. Arabin and Lady Lufton the\nyounger,--and there had been letters written without end, and the\narchdeacon had been nearly beside himself. \"A man who pretends to\nconscientious scruples of that kind is not fit to have a parish,\" he\nhad said to his wife. His wife understood what he meant, and I trust\nthat the reader may also understand it. In the ordinary cutting\nof blocks a very fine razor is not an appropriate instrument. The\narchdeacon, moreover, loved the temporalities of the Church as\ntemporalities. The Church was beautiful to him because one man by\ninterest might have a thousand a year, while another man equally\ngood, but without interest, could only have a hundred. And he liked\nthe men who had the interest a great deal better than the men who\nhad it not. He had been willing to admit this poor perpetual curate,\nwho had so long been kept out in the cold, within the pleasant\ncircle which was warm with ecclesiastical good things, and the man\nhesitated,--because of scruples, as the dean told him! \"I always\nbutton up my pocket when I hear of scruples,\" the archdeacon said.\n\nBut at last Mr. Crawley condescended to accept St. Ewolds. \"Reverend\nand dear Sir,\" he said in his letter.\n\n\n   For the personal benevolence of the offer made to me in\n   your letter of the ---- instant, I beg to tender you my\n   most grateful thanks; as also for your generous kindness\n   to me, in telling me of the high praise bestowed upon me\n   by a gentleman who is now no more,--whose character I\n   have esteemed and whose good opinion I value. There is,\n   methinks, something inexpressibly dear to me in the\n   recorded praise of the dead. For the further instance\n   of the friendship of the Dean of Barchester, I am also\n   thankful.\n\n   Since the receipt of your letter I have doubted much as to\n   my fitness for the work you have proposed to entrust to\n   me,--not from any feeling that the parish of St. Ewolds\n   may be beyond my intellectual power, but because the\n   latter circumstances of my life have been of a nature so\n   strange and perplexing, that they have left me somewhat\n   in doubt as to my own aptitude for going about among men\n   without giving offence and becoming a stumbling-block.\n\n   Nevertheless, reverend and dear sir, if after this\n   confession on my part of a certain faulty demeanour with\n   which I know well that I am afflicted, you are still\n   willing to put the parish into my hands, I will accept the\n   charge,--instigated to do so by the advice of all whom I\n   have consulted on the subject; and in thus accepting it,\n   I hereby pledge myself to vacate it at a month's warning,\n   should I be called upon by you to do so at any period\n   within the next two years. Should I be so far successful\n   during those twenty-four months as to have satisfied both\n   yourself and myself, I may then perhaps venture to regard\n   the preferment as my own in perpetuity for life.\n\n   I have the honour to be, reverend and dear sir,\n   Your most humble and faithful servant,\n\n   JOSIAH CRAWLEY.\n\n\n\"Psha!\" said the archdeacon, who professed that he did not at all\nlike the letter. \"I wonder what he would say if I sent him a month's\nnotice at next Michaelmas?\"\n\n\"I'm sure he would go,\" said Mrs. Grantly.\n\n\"The more fool he,\" said the archdeacon.\n\nAt this time Grace was at the parsonage in a seventh heaven of\nhappiness. The archdeacon was never rough to her, nor did he make any\nof his harsh remarks about her father in her presence. Before her St.\nEwolds was spoken of as the home that was to belong to the Crawleys\nfor the next twenty years. Mrs. Grantly was very loving with her,\nlavishing upon her pretty presents, and words that were prettier than\nthe presents. Grace's life had hitherto been so destitute of those\nprettinesses and softnesses, which can hardly be had without money\nthough money alone will not purchase them, that it seemed to her now\nthat the heavens rained graciousness upon her. It was not that the\narchdeacon's watch, or her lover's chain, or Mrs. Grantly's locket,\nor the little toy from Italy which Mrs. Arabin brought to her from\nthe treasures of the deanery, filled her heart with undue exultation.\nIt was not that she revelled in her new delights of silver and gold\nand shining gems: but that the silver and gold and shining gems were\nconstant indications to her that things had changed, not only for\nher, but for her father and mother, and brother and sister. She felt\nnow more sure than ever that she could not have enjoyed her love had\nshe accepted her lover while the disgrace of the accusation against\nher father remained. But now,--having waited till that had passed\naway, everything was a new happiness to her.\n\nAt last it was settled that Mr. and Mrs. Crawley were to come to\nPlumstead,--and they came. It would be too long to tell now how\ngradually had come about that changed state of things which made such\na visit possible. Mr. Crawley had at first declared that such a thing\nwas quite out of the question. If St. Ewolds was to depend upon it\nSt. Ewolds must be given up. And I think that it would have been\nimpossible for him to go direct from Hogglestock to Plumstead. But it\nfell out after this wise.\n\nMr. Harding's curate at St. Ewolds was nominated to Hogglestock, and\nthe dean urged upon his friend Crawley the expediency of giving up\nthe house as quickly as he could do so. Gradually at this time Mr.\nCrawley had been forced into a certain amount of intimacy with the\nhaunts of men. He had been twice or thrice at Barchester, and had\nlunched with the dean. He had been at Framley for an hour or two,\nand had been forced into some communication with old Mr. Thorne,\nthe squire of his new parish. The end of this had been that he had\nat last consented to transfer himself and wife and daughter to the\ndeanery for a fortnight. He had preached one farewell sermon at\nHogglestock,--not, as he told his audience, as their pastor, which\nhe had ceased to be now for some two or three months,--but as their\nold and loving friend, to whom the use of his former pulpit had been\nlent, that he might express himself thus among them for the last\ntime. His sermon was very short, and was preached without book or\nnotes,--but he never once paused for a word or halted in the string\nor rhythm of his discourse. The dean was there and declared to him\nafterwards that he had not given him credit for such powers of\nutterance. \"Any man can utter out of a full heart,\" Crawley had\nanswered. \"In this trumpery affair about myself, my heart is full! If\nwe could only have our hearts full in other matters, our utterances\nthereanent would receive more attention.\" To all of which the dean\nmade no reply.\n\nOn the day after this the Crawleys took their final departure from\nHogglestock, all the brickmakers from Hoggle End having assembled\non the occasion, with a purse containing seventeen pounds seven\nshillings and sixpence, which they insisted on presenting to Mr.\nCrawley, and as to which there was a little difficulty. And at the\ndeanery they remained for a fortnight. How Mrs. Crawley, under the\nguidance of Mrs. Arabin, had there so far trenched upon the revenues\nof St. Ewolds as to provide for her husband and herself raiment\nfitting for the worldly splendour of Plumstead, need not here be\ntold in detail. Suffice to say, the raiment was forthcoming, and Mr.\nCrawley found himself to be the perplexed possessor of a black dress\ncoat, in addition to the long frock, coming nearly to his feet, which\nwas provided for his daily wear. Touching this garment, there had\nbeen some discussion between the dean and the new vicar. The dean\nhad desired that it should be curtailed in length. The vicar had\nremonstrated,--but still with something of the weakness of compliance\nin his eye. Then the dean had persisted. \"Surely the price of\nthe cloth wanted to perfect the comeliness of the garment cannot\nbe much,\" said the vicar, almost woefully. After that, the dean\nrelented, and the comeliness of the coat was made perfect. The new\nblack long frock, I think Mr. Crawley liked; but the dress coat, with\nthe suit complete, perplexed him sorely.\n\nWith his new coats, and something, also, of new manners, he and his\nwife went over to Plumstead, leaving Jane at the deanery with Mrs.\nArabin. The dean also went to Plumstead. They arrived there not much\nbefore dinner, and as Grace was there before them the first moments\nwere not so bad. Before Mr. Crawley had had time to feel himself lost\nin the drawing-room, he was summoned away to prepare himself for\ndinner,--for dinner, and for the coat, which at the deanery he had\nbeen allowed to leave unworn. \"I would with all my heart that I might\nretire to rest,\" he said to his wife, when the ceremony had been\nperfected.\n\n\"Do not say so. Go down and take your place with them, and speak your\nmind with them,--as you so well know how. Who among them can do it so\nwell?\"\n\n\"I have been told,\" said Mr. Crawley, \"that you shall take a cock\nwhich is lord of the farmyard,--the cock of all that walk,--and when\nyou have daubed his feathers with mud, he shall be thrashed by every\ndunghill coward. I say not that I was ever the cock of the walk, but\nI know that they have daubed my feathers.\" Then he went down among\nthe other poultry into the farmyard.\n\nAt dinner he was very silent, answering, however, with a sort of\ngraceful stateliness any word that Mrs. Grantly addressed to him. Mr.\nThorne, from Ullathorne, was there also to meet his new vicar, as was\nalso Mr. Thorne's very old sister, Miss Monica Thorne. And Lady Anne\nGrantly was there,--she having come with the expressed intention that\nthe wives of the two brothers should know each other,--but with a\nwarmer desire, I think, of seeing Mr. Crawley, of whom the clerical\nworld had been talking much since some notice of the accusation\nagainst him had become general. There were, therefore, ten or twelve\nat the dinner-table, and Mr. Crawley had not made one at such a board\ncertainly since his marriage. All went fairly smooth with him till\nthe ladies left the room; for though Lady Anne, who sat at his left\nhand, had perplexed him somewhat with clerical questions, he had\nfound that he was not called upon for much more than monosyllabic\nresponses. But in his heart he feared the archdeacon, and he felt\nthat when the ladies were gone the archdeacon would not leave him\nalone in his silence.\n\nAs soon as the door was closed, the first subject mooted was that of\nthe Plumstead fox, which had been so basely murdered on Mr. Thorne's\nground. Mr. Thorne had confessed the iniquity, had dismissed the\nmurderous keeper, and all was serene. But the greater on that account\nwas the feasibility of discussing the question, and the archdeacon\nhad a good deal to say about it. Then Mr. Thorne turned to the new\nvicar, and asked him whether foxes abounded in Hogglestock. Had he\nbeen asked as to the rats or the moles, he would have known more\nabout it.\n\n\"Indeed, sir, I know not whether or no there be any foxes in the\nparish of Hogglestock. I do not remember me that I ever saw one. It\nis an animal whose habits I have not watched.\"\n\n\"There is an earth at Hoggle Bushes,\" said the major; \"and I never\nknew it without a litter.\"\n\n\"I think I know the domestic whereabouts of every fox in Plumstead,\"\nsaid the archdeacon, with an ill-natured intention of astonishing Mr.\nCrawley.\n\n\"Of foxes with two legs our friend is speaking, without doubt,\" said\nthe vicar of St. Ewolds, with an attempt at grim pleasantry.\n\n\"Of them we have none at Plumstead. No,--I was speaking of the dear\nold fellow with the brush. Pass the bottle, Mr. Crawley. Won't you\nfill your glass?\" Mr. Crawley passed the bottle, but would not fill\nhis glass. Then the dean, looking up slily, saw the vexation written\nin the archdeacon's face. The parson whom the archdeacon feared most\nof all parsons was the parson who wouldn't fill his glass.\n\nThen the subject was changed. \"I'm told that the bishop has at last\nmade his reappearance on his throne,\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"He was in the cathedral last Sunday,\" said the dean.\n\n\"Does he ever mean to preach again?\"\n\n\"He never did preach very often,\" said the dean.\n\n\"A great deal too often, from all that people say,\" said the\narchdeacon. \"I never heard him myself, and never shall, I dare say.\nYou have heard him, Mr. Crawley?\"\n\n\"I have never had that good fortune, Mr. Archdeacon. But living as I\nshall now do, so near to the city, I may perhaps be enabled to attend\nthe cathedral service on some holyday of the Church, which may not\nrequire prayers in my own rural parish. I think that the clergy of\nthe diocese should be acquainted with the opinions, and with the\nvoice, and with the very manner and words of their bishop. As things\nare now done, this is not possible. I could wish that there were\noccasions on which a bishop might assemble his clergy, and preach to\nthem sermons adapted to their use.\"\n\n\"What do you call a bishop's charge, then?\"\n\n\"It is usually in the printed form that I have received it,\" said Mr.\nCrawley.\n\n\"I think we have quite enough of that kind of thing,\" said the\narchdeacon.\n\n\n\n\"He is a man whose conversation is not pleasing to me,\" Mr. Crawley\nsaid to his wife that night.\n\n\"Do not judge of him too quickly, Josiah,\" his wife said. \"There\nis so much of good in him! He is kind, and generous, and I think\naffectionate.\"\n\n\"But he is of the earth, earthy. When you and the other ladies had\nretired, the conversation at first fell on the habits and value\nof--foxes. I have been informed that in these parts the fox is\ngreatly prized, as without a fox to run before the dogs, that\nscampering over the country which is called hunting, and which\ndelights by the quickness and perhaps by the peril of the exercise,\nis not relished by the riders. Of the wisdom or taste herein\ndisplayed by the hunters of the day I say nothing. But it seemed to\nme that in talking of foxes Dr. Grantly was master of his subject.\nThence the topic glided to the duties of a bishop and to questions\nof preaching, as to which Dr. Grantly was not slow in offering his\nopinion. But I thought that I would rather have heard him talk about\nthe foxes for a week together.\" She said nothing more to him, knowing\nwell how useless it was to attempt to turn him by any argument.\nTo her thinking the kindness of the archdeacon to them personally\ndemanded some indulgence in the expression, and even in the\nformation, of an opinion, respecting his clerical peculiarities.\n\nOn the next day, however, Mr. Crawley, having been summoned by the\narchdeacon into the library for a little private conversation, found\nthat he got on better with him. How the archdeacon conquered him may\nperhaps be best described by a further narration of what Mr. Crawley\nsaid to his wife. \"I told him that in regard to money matters, as he\ncalled them, I had nothing to say. I only trusted that his son was\naware that my daughter had no money, and never would have any. 'My\ndear Crawley,' the archdeacon said,--for of late there seems to have\ngrown up in the world a habit of greater familiarity than that which\nI think did prevail when last I moved much among men;--'my dear\nCrawley, I have enough for both.' 'I would we stood on more equal\ngrounds,' I said. Then as he answered me, he rose from his chair. 'We\nstand,' said he, 'on the only perfect level on which such men can\nmeet each other. We are both gentlemen.' 'Sir,' I said, rising also,\n'from the bottom of my heart I agree with you. I could not have\nspoken such words; but coming from you who are rich to me who am\npoor, they are honourable to the one and comfortable to the other.'\"\n\n\"And after that?\"\n\n\"He took down from the shelves a volume of sermons which his father\npublished many years ago, and presented it to me. I have it now under\nmy arm. It hath the old bishop's manuscript notes, which I will study\ncarefully.\" And thus the archdeacon had hit his bird on both wings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n\nIt now only remains for me to gather together a few loose strings,\nand tie them together in a knot, so that my work may not become\nuntwisted. Early in July, Henry Grantly and Grace Crawley were\nmarried in the parish church of Plumstead,--a great impropriety, as\nto which neither Archdeacon Grantly nor Mr. Crawley could be got to\nassent for a long time, but which was at last carried, not simply by\na union of Mrs. Grantly and Mrs. Crawley, nor even by the assistance\nof Mrs. Arabin, but by the strong intervention of old Lady Lufton\nherself. \"Of course Miss Crawley ought to be married from St. Ewolds\nvicarage; but when the furniture has only half been got in, how is\nit possible?\" When Lady Lufton thus spoke, the archdeacon gave way,\nand Mr. Crawley hadn't a leg to stand upon. Henry Grantly had not an\nopinion upon the matter. He told his father that he expected that\nthey would marry him among them, and that that would be enough for\nhim. As for Grace, nobody even thought of asking her; and I doubt\nwhether she would have heard anything about the contest, had not\nsome tidings of it reached her from her lover. Married they were at\nPlumstead,--and the breakfast was given with all that luxuriance of\nplenty which was so dear to the archdeacon's mind. Mr. Crawley was\nthe officiating priest. With his hands dropping before him, folded\nhumbly, he told the archdeacon,--when that Plumstead question had\nbeen finally settled in opposition to his wishes,--that he would fain\nhimself perform the ceremony by which his dearest daughter would\nbe bound to her marriage duties. \"And who else should?\" said the\narchdeacon. Mr. Crawley muttered that he had not known how far his\nreverend brother might have been willing to waive his rights. But\nthe archdeacon, who was in high good humour,--having just bestowed\na little pony carriage on his new daughter-in-law,--only laughed\nat him; and, if the rumour which was handed about the families be\ntrue, the archdeacon, before the interview was over, had poked Mr.\nCrawley in the ribs. Mr. Crawley married them; but the archdeacon\nassisted,--and the dean gave away the bride. The Rev. Charles Grantly\nwas there also; and as there was, as a matter of course, a cloud of\ncurates floating in the distance, Henry Grantly was perhaps to be\nexcused for declaring to his wife, when the pair had escaped, that\nsurely no couple had ever been so tightly buckled since marriage had\nfirst become a Church ceremony.\n\nSoon after that, Mr. and Mrs. Crawley became quiet at St. Ewolds,\nand, as I think, contented. Her happiness began very quickly. Though\nshe had been greatly broken by her troubles, the first sight she had\nof her husband in his new long frock-coat went far to restore her,\nand while he was declaring himself to be a cock so daubed with mud as\nto be incapable of crowing, she was congratulating herself on seeing\nher husband once more clothed as became his position. And they were\nlucky, too, as regarded the squire's house; for Mr. Thorne was old,\nand quiet, and old-fashioned; and Miss Thorne was older, and though\nshe was not exactly quiet, she was very old-fashioned indeed. So that\nthere grew to be a pleasant friendship between Miss Thorne and Mrs.\nCrawley.\n\nJohnny Eames, when last I heard of him, was still a bachelor, and, as\nI think, likely to remain so. At last he had utterly thrown over Sir\nRaffle Buffle, declaring to his friends that the special duties of\nprivate secretaryship were not exactly to his taste. \"You get so sick\nat the thirteenth private note,\" he said, \"that you find yourself\nunable to carry on the humbug any farther.\" But he did not leave his\noffice. \"I'm the head of a room, you know,\" he told Lady Julia De\nGuest; \"and there's nothing to trouble me,--and a fellow, you know,\nought to have something to do.\" Lady Julia told him, with a great\ndeal of energy, that she would never forgive him if he gave up his\noffice. After that eventful night when he escaped ignominiously from\nthe house of Lady Demolines under the protection of the policeman's\nlantern, he did hear more than once from Porchester Terrace, and\nfrom allies employed by the enemy who was there resident. \"My cousin,\nthe serjeant,\" proved to be a myth. Johnny found out all about that\nSerjeant Runter, who was distantly connected, indeed, with the late\nhusband of Lady Demolines, but had always persistently declined to\nhave any intercourse whatever with her ladyship. For the serjeant was\na rising man, and Lady Demolines was not exactly progressing in the\nworld. Johnny heard nothing from the serjeant; but from Madalina he\ngot letter after letter. In the first she asked him not to think\ntoo much of the little joke that had occurred. In her second she\ndescribed the vehemence of her love. In her third the bitterness\nof her wrath. Her fourth she simply invited him to come and\ndine in Porchester Terrace. Her fifth was the outpouring of\ninjured innocence. And then came letters from an attorney. Johnny\nanswered not a word to any of them, and gradually the letters were\ndiscontinued. Within six months of the receipt of the last, he was\ndelighted by reading among the marriages in the newspapers a notice\nthat Peter Bangles, Esq., of the firm of Burton and Bangles, wine\nmerchants, of Hook Court, had been united to Madalina, daughter of\nthe late Sir Confucius Demolines, at the church of Peter the Martyr.\n\"Most appropriate,\" said Johnny, as he read the notice to Conway\nDalrymple, who was then back from his wedding tour; \"for most\nassuredly there will be now another Peter the Martyr.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" said Conway, who had heard something of\nMr. Peter Bangles. \"There are men who have strong wills of their own,\nand strong hands of their own.\"\n\n\"Poor Madalina!\" said Johnny. \"If he does beat her, I hope he will\ndo it tenderly. It may be that a little of it will suit her fevered\ntemperament.\"\n\nBefore the summer was over Conway Dalrymple had been married to\nClara Van Siever, and by a singular arrangement of circumstances\nhad married her with the full approval of old Mrs. Van. Mr.\nMusselboro,--whose name I hope has not been altogether forgotten,\nthough the part played by him has been subordinate,--had opposed\nDalrymple in the efforts made by the artist to get something out of\nBroughton's estate for the benefit of the widow. From circumstances\nof which Dalrymple learned the particulars with the aid of an\nattorney, it seemed to him that certain facts were wilfully kept in\nthe dark by Musselboro, and he went with his complaint to Mrs. Van\nSiever, declaring that he would bring the whole affair into court,\nunless all the workings of the firm were made clear to him. Mrs. Van\nwas very insolent to him,--and even turned him out of the house. But,\nnevertheless, she did not allow Mr. Musselboro to escape. Whoever was\nto be left in the dark she did not wish to be there herself;--and\nit began to dawn upon her that her dear Musselboro was deceiving\nher. Then she sent for Dalrymple, and without a word of apology for\nher former conduct, put him upon the right track. As he was pushing\nhis inquiries, and working heaven and earth for the unfortunate\nwidow,--as to whom he swore daily that when this matter was settled\nhe would never see her again, so terrible was she to him with her\nmock affection and pretended hysterics, and false moralities,--he\nwas told one day that she had gone off with Mr. Musselboro! Mr.\nMusselboro, finding that this was the surest plan of obtaining for\nhimself the little business in Hook Court, married the widow of his\nlate partner, and is at this moment probably carrying on a law-suit\nwith Mrs. Van. For the law-suit Conway Dalrymple cared nothing. When\nthe quarrel had become hot between Mrs. Van and her late myrmidon,\nClara fell into Conway's hands without opposition; and, let the\nlaw-suit go as it may, there will be enough left of Mrs. Van's money\nto make the house of Mr. and Mrs. Conway Dalrymple very comfortable.\nThe picture of Jael and Sisera was stitched up without any\ndifficulty, and I daresay most of my readers will remember it hanging\non the walls of the exhibition.\n\nBefore I take my leave of the diocese of Barchester for ever, which\nI purpose to do in the succeeding paragraph, I desire to be allowed\nto say one word of apology for myself, in answer to those who\nhave accused me,--always without bitterness, and generally with\ntenderness,--of having forgotten, in writing of clergymen, the first\nand most prominent characteristic of the ordinary English clergyman's\nlife. I have described many clergymen, they say, but have spoken of\nthem all as though their professional duties, their high calling,\ntheir daily workings for the good of those around them, were matters\nof no moment, either to me, or, in my opinion, to themselves. I would\nplead, in answer to this, that my object has been to paint the social\nand not the professional lives of clergymen; and that I have been led\nto do so, firstly, by a feeling that as no men affect more strongly,\nby their own character, the society of those around than do country\nclergymen, so, therefore, their social habits have been worth the\nlabour necessary for painting them; and secondly, by a feeling\nthat though I, as a novelist, may feel myself entitled to write of\nclergymen out of their pulpits, as I may also write of lawyers and\ndoctors, I have no such liberty to write of them in their pulpits.\nWhen I have done so, if I have done so, I have so far transgressed.\nThere are those who have told me that I have made all my clergymen\nbad, and none good. I must venture to hint to such judges that\nthey have taught their eyes to love a colouring higher than nature\njustifies. We are, most of us, apt to love Raphael's madonnas\nbetter than Rembrandt's matrons. But, though we do so, we know that\nRembrandt's matrons existed; but we have a strong belief that no\nsuch woman as Raphael painted ever did exist. In that he painted,\nas he may be surmised to have done, for pious purposes,--at least\nfor Church purposes,--Raphael was justified; but had he painted so\nfor family portraiture he would have been false. Had I written an\nepic about clergymen, I would have taken St. Paul for my model; but\ndescribing, as I have endeavoured to do, such clergymen as I see\naround me, I could not venture to be transcendental. For myself I can\nonly say that I shall always be happy to sit, when allowed to do so,\nat the table of Archdeacon Grantly, to walk through the High Street\nof Barchester arm in arm with Mr. Robarts of Framley, and to stand\nalone and shed a tear beneath the modest black stone in the north\ntransept of the cathedral on which is inscribed the name of Septimus\nHarding.\n\nAnd now, if the reader will allow me to seize him affectionately by\nthe arm, we will together take our last farewell of Barset and of the\ntowers of Barchester. I may not venture to say to him that, in this\ncountry, he and I together have wandered often through the country\nlanes, and have ridden together over the too-well wooded fields, or\nhave stood together in the cathedral nave listening to the peals\nof the organ, or have together sat at good men's tables, or have\nconfronted together the angry pride of men who were not good. I may\nnot boast that any beside myself have so realized the place, and\nthe people, and the facts, as to make such reminiscences possible\nas those which I should attempt to evoke by an appeal to perfect\nfellowship. But to me Barset has been a real county, and its city a\nreal city, and the spires and towers have been before my eyes, and\nthe voices of the people are known to my ears, and the pavement of\nthe city ways are familiar to my footsteps. To them all I now say\nfarewell. That I have been induced to wander among them too long by\nmy love of old friendships, and by the sweetness of old faces, is\na fault for which I may perhaps be more readily forgiven, when I\nrepeat, with some solemnity of assurance, the promise made in my\ntitle, that this shall be the last chronicle of Barset.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LAST CHRONICLE OF BARSET***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 3045-8.txt or 3045-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/3\/0\/4\/3045\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/about\/contact\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1242,"split":"test"}
