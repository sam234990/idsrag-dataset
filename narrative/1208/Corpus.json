{"ori_id":"3f596a5be9de38b6f63b6c4b92021fe78d403e80","title":"Savrola","context":"Savrola\n Events take place in a fictional country called Laurania, located somewhere on the Mediterranean sea, which is similar to Italy or Spain, but with an overlay of Victorian England. Laurania has an African colony which can be reached via the Suez Canal. It has been a republic for many years, and has a well established constitution. Five years previously (stated to be in 1883) the country was split by a civil war, as a result of which General Antonio Molara became President and Dictator. Unrest has arisen because of Molara's refusal to restore parliamentary rule, and the final events of his dictatorship are described in the book.\nThe story opens with a description of the capital and fast-moving political events there. Molara has bowed to popular pressure for elections, but intends to do so on the basis of a grossly amended electoral register. Savrola is seen as the leader of the revolutionaries, deciding what they are to do, and presiding over conflicting factions with differing aims. Despite the unrest, society still proceeds on the surface in a genteel course, with state balls and society events. Molara decides to ask his young and beautiful wife, Lucile, to attempt to seduce Savrola and discover anything she can about his plans. Unfortunately for him, Lucile finds herself attracted to Savrola and her loyalties become confused.\nEvents move from political manoeuvring to street fighting when a rebel army invades Laurania. While Savrola knows about the army and intended invasion, he has poor control over it, so the invasion has started without his knowledge or proper preparations. Both sides scramble for a fight, as Molara finds the country's regular troops refuse to obey his orders. He is obliged to despatch most of the loyal Republican Guard from the capital to oppose the invaders, leaving him with a much reduced force to hold the capital. Fierce street fighting takes place in the capital between the revolutionaries of the Popular Party and the Republican Guard. The revolution culminates in the storming of the Presidential Palace and the death on the steps of his palace of General Molara. The revolutionary allies start to break apart in the face of a threat by the Lauranian navy (which remains loyal to the president), to bombard the city unless Savrola is handed over to them. The council of public safety decides the most expedient position would be to agree to this, but Savrola escapes attempts to arrest him and flees with Lucile. The city is subsequently bombarded when Savrola is not produced, and the last scene is of Savrola watching the destruction from outside the city.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Savrola, by Winston Spencer Churchill\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

It was the first rain\nafter the summer heats, and it marked the beginning of that delightful\nautumn climate which has made the Lauranian capital the home of the\nartist, the invalid, and the sybarite.\n\nThe shower had been heavy, but it had not dispersed the crowds that\nwere gathered in the great square in front of the Parliament House.  It\nwas welcome, but it had not altered their anxious and angry looks; it\nhad drenched them without cooling their excitement.  Evidently an event\nof consequence was taking place.  The fine building, where the\nrepresentatives of the people were wont to meet, wore an aspect of\nsombre importance that the trophies and statues, with which an ancient\nand an art-loving people had decorated its fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, did not dispel.  A\nsquadron of Lancers of the Republican Guard was drawn up at the foot of\nthe great steps, and a considerable body of infantry kept a broad space\nclear in front of the entrance.  Behind the soldiers the people filled\nin the rest of the picture.  They swarmed in the square and the streets\nleading to it; they had scrambled on to the numerous monuments, which\nthe taste and pride of the Republic had raised to the memory of her\nancient heroes, covering them so completely that they looked like\nmounds of human beings; even the trees contained their occupants, while\nthe windows and often the roofs, of the houses and offices which\noverlooked the scene were crowded with spectators.  It was a great\nmultitude and it vibrated with excitement.  Wild passions surged across\nthe throng, as squalls sweep across a stormy sea.  Here and there a\nman, mounting above his fellows, would harangue those whom his voice\ncould reach, and a cheer or a shout was caught up by thousands who had\nnever heard the words but were searching for something to give\nexpression to their feelings.\n\nIt was a great day in the history of Laurania.  For five long years\nsince the Civil War the people had endured the insult of autocratic\nrule.  The fact that the Government was strong, and the memory of the\ndisorders of the past, had operated powerfully on the minds of the more\nsober citizens.  But from the first there had been murmurs.  There were\nmany who had borne arms on the losing side in the long struggle that\nhad ended in the victory of President Antonio Molara.  Some had\nsuffered wounds or confiscation; others had undergone imprisonment;\nmany had lost friends and relations, who with their latest breath had\nenjoined the uncompromising prosecution of the war.  The Government had\nstarted with implacable enemies, and their rule had been harsh and\ntyrannical.  The ancient constitution to which the citizens were so\nstrongly attached and of which they were so proud, had been subverted.\nThe President, alleging the prevalence of sedition, had declined to\ninvite the people to send their representatives to that chamber which\nhad for many centuries been regarded as the surest bulwark of popular\nliberties.  Thus the discontents increased day by day and year by year:\nthe National party, which had at first consisted only of a few\nsurvivors of the beaten side, had swelled into the most numerous and\npowerful faction in the State; and at last they had found a leader.\nThe agitation proceeded on all sides.  The large and turbulent\npopulation of the capital were thoroughly devoted to the rising cause.\nDemonstration had followed demonstration; riot had succeeded riot; even\nthe army showed signs of unrest.  At length the President had decided\nto make concessions.  It was announced that on the first of September\nthe electoral writs should be issued and the people should be accorded\nan opportunity of expressing their wishes and opinions.\n\nThis pledge had contented the more peaceable citizens.  The extremists,\nfinding themselves in a minority, had altered their tone.  The\nGovernment, taking advantage of the favourable moment, had arrested\nseveral of the more violent leaders.  Others, who had fought in the war\nand had returned from exile to take part in the revolt, fled for their\nlives across the border.  A rigorous search for arms had resulted in\nimportant captures.  European nations, watching with interested and\nanxious eyes the political barometer, were convinced that the\nGovernment cause was in the ascendant.  But meanwhile the people\nwaited, silent and expectant, for the fulfilment of the promise.\n\nAt length the day had come.  The necessary preparations for summoning\nthe seventy thousand male electors to record their votes had been\ncarried out by the public officials.  The President, as the custom\nprescribed, was in person to sign the necessary writ of summons to the\nfaithful citizens.  Warrants for election would be forwarded to the\nvarious electoral divisions in the city and the provinces, and those\nwho were by the ancient law entitled to the franchise would give their\nverdict on the conduct of him whom the Populists in bitter hatred had\ncalled the Dictator.\n\nIt was for this moment that the crowd was waiting.  Though cheers from\ntime to time arose, they waited for the most part in silence.  Even\nwhen the President had passed on his way to the Senate, they had\nforeborne to hoot; in their eyes he was virtually abdicating, and that\nmade amends for all.  The time-honoured observances, the long-loved\nrights would be restored, and once more democratic government would be\ntriumphant in Laurania.\n\nSuddenly, at the top of the steps in the full view of the people, a\nyoung man appeared, his dress disordered and his face crimson with\nexcitement.  It was Moret, one of the Civic Council.  He was\nimmediately recognised by the populace, and a great cheer arose.  Many\nwho could not see him took up the shout, which re-echoed through the\nsquare, the expression of a nation's satisfaction.  He gesticulated\nvehemently, but his words, if he spoke at all, were lost in the tumult.\nAnother man, an usher, followed him out hurriedly, put his hand on his\nshoulder, appeared to speak with earnestness, and drew him back into\nthe shadow of the entrance.  The crowd still cheered.\n\nA third figure issued from the door, an old man in the robes of\nmunicipal office.  He walked, or rather tottered feebly down the steps\nto a carriage, which had drawn up to meet him.  Again there were\ncheers.  \"Godoy!  Godoy!  Bravo, Godoy!  Champion of the People!\nHurrah, hurrah!\"\n\nIt was the Mayor, one of the strongest and most reputable members of\nthe party of Reform.  He entered his carriage and drove through the\nopen space, maintained by the soldiery, into the crowd, which, still\ncheering, gave way with respect.\n\nThe carriage was open and it was evident that the old man was painfully\nmoved.  His face was pale, his mouth puckered into an expression of\ngrief and anger, his whole frame shaken with suppressed emotion.  The\ncrowd had greeted him with applause, but, quick to notice, were struck\nby his altered appearance and woeful looks.  They crowded round the\ncarriage crying: \"What has happened?  Is all well?  Speak, Godoy,\nspeak!\"  But he would have none of them, and quivering with agitation\nbade his coachman drive the faster.  The people gave way slowly,\nsullenly, thoughtfully, as men who make momentous resolutions.\nSomething had happened, untoward, unforeseen, unwelcome; what this was,\nthey were anxious to know.\n\nAnd then began a period of wild rumour.  The President had refused to\nsign the writs; he had committed suicide; the troops had been ordered\nto fire; the elections would not take place, after all; Savrola had\nbeen arrested,--seized in the very Senate, said one, murdered added\nanother.  The noise of the multitude changed into a dull dissonant hum\nof rising anger.\n\nAt last the answer came.  There was a house, overlooking the square,\nwhich was separated from the Chamber of Representatives only by a\nnarrow street, and this street had been kept clear for traffic by the\ntroops.  On the balcony of this house the young man, Moret, the Civic\nCouncillor, now reappeared, and his coming was the signal for a storm\nof wild, anxious cries from the vast concourse.  He held up his hand\nfor silence and after some moments his words became audible to those\nnearest.  \"You are betrayed--a cruel fraud--the hopes we had cherished\nare dashed to the ground--all has been done in vain--  Cheated!\ncheated! cheated!\"  The broken fragments of his oratory reached far\ninto the mass of excited humanity, and then he shouted a sentence,\nwhich was heard by thousands and repeated by thousands more.  \"The\nregister of citizenship has been mutilated, and the names of more than\nhalf the electors have been erased.  To your tents, oh people of\nLaurania!\"\n\nFor an instant there was silence, and then a great sob of fury, of\ndisappointment, and of resolve arose from the multitude.\n\nAt this moment the presidential carriage, with its four horses, its\npostilions in the Republican livery, and an escort of Lancers, moved\nforward to the foot of the steps, as there emerged from the Parliament\nHouse a remarkable figure.  He wore the splendid blue and white uniform\nof a general of the Lauranian Army; his breast glittered with medals\nand orders; his keen strong features were composed.  He paused for a\nmoment before descending to his carriage, as if to give the mob an\nopportunity to hiss and hoot to their content, and appeared to talk\nunconcernedly with his companion, Se\u00c3\u00b1or Louvet, the Minister of the\nInterior.  He pointed once or twice towards the surging masses, and\nthen walked slowly down the steps.  Louvet had intended to accompany\nhim, but he heard the roar of the crowd and remembered that he had some\nbusiness to attend to in the Senate that could not be delayed; the\nother went on alone.  The soldiers presented arms.  A howl of fury\narose from the people.  A mounted officer, who sat his horse unmoved,\nan inexorable machine, turned to a subordinate with an order.  Several\ncompanies of foot-soldiers began defiling from the side street on the\nright of the Chamber, and drawing up in line in the open space which\nwas now partly invaded by the mob.\n\nThe President entered his carriage which, preceded by an entire troop\nof Lancers, immediately started at a trot.  So soon as the carriage\nreached the edge of the open space, a rush was made by the crowd.  The\nescort closed up; \"Fall back there!\" shouted an officer, but he was\nunheeded.  \"Will you move, or must we move you?\" said a gruffer voice.\nYet the mob gave not an inch.  The danger was imminent.  \"Cheat!\nTraitor!  Liar!  Tyrant!\" they shouted, with many other expressions too\ncoarse to be recorded.  \"Give us back our rights--you, who have stolen\nthem!\"\n\nAnd then some one at the back of the crowd fired a revolver into the\nair.  The effect was electrical.  The Lancers dropped their points and\nsprang forward.  Shouts of terror and fury arose on all sides.  The\npopulace fled before the cavalry; some fell on the ground and were\ntrampled to death; some were knocked down and injured by the horses; a\nfew were speared by the soldiers.  It was a horrible scene.  Those\nbehind threw stones, and some fired random pistol shots.  The President\nremained unmoved.  Erect and unflinching he gazed on the tumult as men\ngaze at a race about which they have not betted.  His hat was knocked\noff, and a trickle of blood down his cheek showed where a stone had\nstruck.  For some moments the issue seemed doubtful.  The crowd might\nstorm the carriage and then,--to be torn to pieces by a rabble!  There\nwere other and more pleasant deaths.  But the discipline of the troops\novercame all obstacles, the bearing of the man appeared to cow his\nenemies, and the crowd fell back, still hooting and shouting.\n\nMeanwhile the officer commanding the infantry by the Parliament House\nhad been alarmed by the rushes of the mob, which he could see were\ndirected at the President's carriage.  He determined to create a\ndiversion.  \"We shall have to fire on them,\" he said to the Major who\nwas beside him.\n\n\"Excellent,\" replied that officer; \"it will enable us to conclude those\nexperiments in penetration, which we have been trying with the\nsoft-nosed bullet.  A very valuable experiment, Sir,\" and then turning\nto the soldiers he issued several orders.  \"A very valuable\nexperiment,\" he repeated.\n\n\"Somewhat expensive,\" said the Colonel dryly; \"and half a company will\nbe enough, Major.\"\n\nThere was a rattle of breech-blocks as the rifles were loaded.  The\npeople immediately in front of the troops struggled madly to escape the\nimpending volley.  One man, a man in a straw hat, kept his head.  He\nrushed forward.  \"For God's sake don't fire!\" he cried.  \"Have mercy!\nWe will disperse.\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause, a sharp order and a loud explosion,\nfollowed by screams.  The man in the straw hat bent backwards and fell\non the ground; other figures also subsided and lay still in curiously\ntwisted postures.  Every one else except the soldiers fled; fortunately\nthere were many exits to the square, and in a few minutes it was almost\ndeserted.  The President's carriage made its way through the flying\ncrowd to the gates of the palace, which were guarded by more soldiers,\nand passed through in safety.\n\nAll was now over.  The spirit of the mob was broken and the wide\nexpanse of Constitution Square was soon nearly empty.  Forty bodies and\nsome expended cartridges lay on the ground.  Both had played their part\nin the history of human developement and passed out of the\nconsiderations of living men.  Nevertheless the soldiers picked up the\nempty cases, and presently some police came with carts and took the\nother things away, and all was quiet again in Laurania.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE HEAD OF THE STATE.\n\nThe carriage and its escort passed the ancient gateway and driving\nthrough a wide courtyard drew up at the entrance of the palace.  The\nPresident alighted.  He fully appreciated the importance of retaining\nthe good will and support of the army, and immediately walked up to the\nofficer who commanded the Lancers.  \"None of your men hurt, I trust,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Nothing serious, General,\" replied the subaltern.\n\n\"You handled your troop with great judgment and courage.  It shall be\nremembered.  But it is easy to lead brave men; they shall not be\nforgotten.  Ah, Colonel, you are quite right to come to me.  I\nanticipated some trouble with the disaffected classes, so soon as it\nbecame known that we were still determined to maintain law and order in\nthe State.\"  These last words were spoken to a dark, bronzed man who\nhad hurriedly entered the courtyard by a side gate.  Colonel Sorrento,\nfor such was the newcomer's name, was the military chief of the Police.\nBesides filling this important office, he discharged the duties of\nWar-Minister to the Republic.  The combination enabled the civil power\nto be supplemented by the military with great and convenient\npromptitude, whenever it was necessary or desirable to take strong\nmeasures.  The arrangement was well suited to the times.  Usually\nSorrento was calm and serene.  He had seen many engagements and much\nwar of the type which knows no quarter, had been several times wounded,\nand was regarded as a brave and callous man.  But there is something\nappalling in the concentrated fury of a mob, and the Colonel's manner\nbetrayed the fact that he was not quite proof against it.\n\n\"Are you wounded, Sir?\" he asked, catching sight of the President's\nface.\n\n\"It is nothing,--a stone; but they were very violent.  Some one had\nroused them; I had hoped to get away before the news was known.  Who\nwas it spoke to them?\"\n\n\"Moret, the Civic Councillor, from the balcony of the hotel.  A very\ndangerous man!  He told them they were betrayed.\"\n\n\"Betrayed?  What audacity!  Surely such language would come within the\n20th Section of the Constitution: _Inciting to violence against the\nperson of the Head of the State by misrepresentation or otherwise_.\"\nThe President was well versed in those clauses of the public law which\nwere intended to strengthen the hands of the Executive.  \"Have him\narrested, Sorrento.  We cannot allow the majesty of Government to be\ninsulted with impunity,--or stay, perhaps it would be wiser to be\nmagnanimous now that the matter is settled.  I do not want a State\nprosecution just at present.\"  Then he added in a louder voice: \"This\nyoung officer, Colonel, discharged his duty with great\ndetermination,--a most excellent soldier.  Please see that a note is\nmade of it.  Promotion should always go by merit, not by age, for\nservices and not for service.  We will not forget your behaviour, young\nman.\"\n\nHe ascended the steps and entered the hall of the palace, leaving the\nsubaltern, a boy of twenty-two, flushed with pleasure and excitement,\nto build high hopes of future command and success.\n\nThe hall was spacious and well-proportioned.  It was decorated in the\npurest style of the Lauranian Republic, the arms of which were\neverywhere displayed.  The pillars were of ancient marble and by their\nsize and colour attested the wealth and magnificence of former days.\nThe tessellated pavement presented a pleasing pattern.  Elaborate\nmosaics on the walls depicted scenes from the national history: the\nfoundation of the city; the peace of 1370; the reception of the envoys\nof the Great Mogul: the victory of Brota; the death of Saldanho, that\naustere patriot, who died rather than submit to a technical violation\nof the Constitution.  And then coming down to later years, the walls\nshowed the building of the Parliament House: the naval victory of Cape\nCheronta, and finally the conclusion of the Civil War in 1883.  On\neither side of the hall, in a deep alcove, a bronze fountain, playing\namid surrounding palms and ferns, imparted a feeling of refreshing\ncoolness to the eye and ear.  Facing the entrance was a broad\nstaircase, leading to the state rooms whose doors were concealed by\ncrimson curtains.\n\nA woman stood at the top of the stairs.  Her hands rested on the marble\nbalustrade; her white dress contrasted with the bright-coloured\ncurtains behind her.  She was very beautiful, but her face wore an\nexpression of alarm and anxiety.  Woman-like she asked three questions\nat once.  \"What has happened, Antonio?  Have the people risen?  Why\nhave they been firing?\"  She paused timidly at the head of the stairs,\nas if fearing to descend.\n\n\"All is well,\" replied the President in his official manner.  \"Some of\nthe disaffected have rioted, but the Colonel here has taken every\nprecaution and order reigns once more, dearest.\"  Then turning to\nSorrento, he went on: \"It is possible that the disturbances may be\nrenewed.  The troops should be confined to barracks and you may give\nthem an extra day's pay to drink the health of the Republic.  Double\nthe Guards and you had better have the streets patrolled to-night.  In\ncase anything happens, you will find me here.  Good-night, Colonel.\"\nHe walked up a few steps, and the War-Minister, bowing gravely, turned\nand departed.\n\nThe woman came down the stairs and they met midway.  He took both her\nhands in his and smiled affectionately; she, standing one step above\nhim, bent forward and kissed him.  It was an amiable, though formal,\nsalutation.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"we have got through to-day all right, my dear; but\nhow long it can go on, I do not know; the revolutionaries seem to get\nstronger every day.  It was a very dangerous moment just now in the\nsquare; but is over for the present.\"\n\n\"I have passed an anxious hour,\" she said, and then, catching sight for\nthe first time of his bruised forehead, she started.  \"But you are\nwounded.\"\n\n\"It is nothing,\" said the President.  \"They threw stones; now, we used\nbullets; they are better arguments.\"\n\n\"What happened at the Senate?\"\n\n\"I had expected trouble, you know.  I told them in my speech that, in\nspite of the unsettled state of affairs, we had decided to restore the\nancient Constitution of the Republic, but that it had been necessary to\npurge the register of the disaffected and rebellious.  The Mayor took\nit out of the box and they scrambled over each other to look at the\ntotal electorates for the divisions.  When they saw how much they were\nreduced they were very angry.  Godoy was speechless; he is a fool, that\nman.  Louvet told them that it must be taken as an instalment, and that\nas things got more settled the franchise would be extended; but they\nhowled with fury.  Indeed, had it not been for the ushers and for a few\nmen of the Guard, I believe they would have assaulted me there and then\nin the very Chamber itself.  Moret shook his fist at me,--ridiculous\nyoung ass--and rushed out to harangue the mob.\"\n\n\"And Savrola?\"\n\n\"Oh, Savrola,--he was quite calm; he laughed when he saw the register.\n'It is only a question of a few months,' he said; 'I wonder you think\nit worth while.'  I told him that I did not understand him, but he\nspoke the truth for all that;\" and then, taking his wife's hand in his,\nhe climbed the stairs slowly and thoughtfully.\n\nBut there is little rest for a public man in times of civil\ndisturbance.  No sooner had Molara reached the top of the stairs and\nentered the reception-room, than a man advanced to meet him from a door\nat the far end.  He was small, dark, and very ugly, with a face\nwrinkled with age and an indoor life.  Its pallor showed all the more\nby contrast with his hair and short moustache, both of which were of\nthat purple blackness to which Nature is unable to attain.  In his hand\nhe carried a large bundle of papers, carefully disposed into\ndepartments by his long and delicate fingers.  It was the Private\nSecretary.\n\n\"What is it, Miguel?\" asked the President; \"you have some papers for\nme?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir; a few minutes will suffice.  You have had an exciting day; I\nrejoice it has terminated successfully.\"\n\n\"It has not been devoid of interest,\" said Molara, wearily.  \"What have\nyou got for me?\"\n\n\"Several foreign despatches.  Great Britain has sent a note about the\nSphere of Influence to the south of the African Colony, to which the\nForeign Minister has drafted a reply.\"\n\n\"Ah! these English,--how grasping, how domineering!  But we must be\nfirm.  I will maintain the territories of the Republic against all\nenemies, internal or external.  We cannot send armies, but, thank God,\nwe can write despatches.  Is it strong enough?\"\n\n\"Your Excellency need have no fears.  We have vindicated our rights\nmost emphatically; it will be a great moral victory.\"\n\n\"I hope we shall get material as well as moral good out of it.  The\ncountry is rich; there is paying gold; that explains the note.  Of\ncourse we must reply severely.  What else?\"\n\n\"There are some papers relating to the army, commissions and\npromotions, Sir,\" said Miguel, fingering one particular bundle of his\npapers, the bundle that lay between his first and second fingers.\n\"Those sentences for confirmation, a draft of Morgon's Budget for\ninformation and opinion, and one or two minor matters.\"\n\n\"H'm, a long business!  Very well, I will come and see to it.  Dearest,\nyou know how pressed I am.  We shall meet to-night at the dinner.  Have\nall the Ministers accepted?\"\n\n\"All but Louvet, Antonio.  He is detained by business.\"\n\n\"Business, pooh!  He is afraid of the streets at night.  What a thing\nit is to be a coward!  Thus he misses a good dinner.  At eight then,\nLucile.\"  And with a quick and decided step he passed through the small\ndoor of the private office followed by the Secretary.\n\nMadame Antonio Molara remained standing for a moment in the great\nreception-room.  Then she walked to the window and stepped out on to\nthe balcony.  The scene which stretched before her was one of\nsurpassing beauty.  The palace stood upon high ground commanding a wide\nview of the city and the harbour.  The sun was low on the horizon, but\nthe walls of the houses still stood out in glaring white.  The red and\nblue tiled roofs were relieved by frequent gardens and squares whose\ngreen and graceful palms soothed and gratified the eye.  To the north\nthe great pile of the Senate House and Parliament buildings loomed up\nmajestic and imposing.  Westward lay the harbour with its shipping and\nprotecting forts.  A few warships floated in the roads, and many\nwhite-sailed smacks dotted the waters of the Mediterranean Sea, which\nhad already begun to change their blue for the more gorgeous colours of\nsunset.\n\nAs she stood there in the clear light of the autumn evening, she looked\ndivinely beautiful.  She had arrived at that age of life, when to the\nattractions of a maiden's beauty are added those of a woman's wit.  Her\nperfect features were the mirror of her mind, and displayed with every\nemotion and every mood that vivacity of expression which is the\ngreatest of woman's charms.  Her tall figure was instinct with grace,\nand the almost classic dress she wore enhanced her beauty and\nharmonised with her surroundings.\n\nSomething in her face suggested a wistful aspiration.  Lucile had\nmarried Antonio Molara nearly five years before, when he was in the\nheight and vigour of his power.  Her family had been among the stoutest\nsupporters of his cause, and her father and brother had lost their\nlives on the battlefield of Sorato.  Her mother, broken down by\ncalamity and sorrow, lived only to commend her daughter to the care of\ntheir most powerful friend, the general who had saved the State and\nwould now rule it.  He had accepted the task at first from a feeling of\nobligation to those who had followed his star so faithfully, but\nafterwards from other motives.  Before a month had passed he fell in\nlove with the beautiful girl whom Fortune had led to him.  She admired\nhis courage, his energy, and his resource; the splendours of the office\nthat he filled were not without their influence; he offered her wealth\nand position,--almost a throne; and besides he was a fine figure of a\nman.  She was twenty-three when they married.  For many months her life\nhad been a busy one.  Receptions, balls, and parties had filled the\nwinter season with the unremitting labour of entertaining.  Foreign\nprinces had paid her homage, not only as the loveliest woman in Europe,\nbut also as a great political figure.  Her _salon_ was crowded with the\nmost famous men from every country.  Statesmen, soldiers, poets, and\nmen of science had worshipped at the shrine.  She had mixed in matters\nof State.  Suave and courtly ambassadors had thrown out delicate hints,\nand she had replied with unofficial answers.  Plenipotentiaries had\nexplained the details of treaties and protocols, with remarkable\nelaboration, for her benefit.  Philanthropists had argued, urged, and\nexpounded their views or whims.  Every one talked to her of public\nbusiness.  Even her maid had approached her with an application for the\nadvancement of her brother, a clerk in the Post Office; and every one\nhad admired her until admiration itself, the most delicious drink that\na woman tastes, became insipid.\n\nBut even during the first few years there had been something wanting.\nWhat it was Lucile had never been able to guess.  Her husband was\naffectionate and such time as he could spare from public matters was at\nher service.  Of late things had been less bright.  The agitation of\nthe country, the rising forces of Democracy, added to the already heavy\nbusiness of the Republic, had taxed the President's time and energies\nto the full.  Hard lines had come into his face, lines of work and\nanxiety, and sometimes she had caught a look of awful weariness, as of\none who toils and yet foresees that his labour will be vain.  He saw\nher less frequently, and in those short intervals talked more and more\nof business and politics.\n\nA feeling of unrest seemed to pervade the capital.  The season, which\nhad just begun, had opened badly.  Many of the great families had\nremained in their summer residences on the slopes of the mountains,\nthough the plains were already cool and green; others had kept to their\nown houses in the city, and only the most formal entertainments at the\npalace had been attended.  As the outlook became more threatening it\nseemed that she was able to help him less.  Passions were being roused\nthat blinded the eyes to beauty and dulled the mind to charm.  She was\nstill a queen, but her subjects were sullen and inattentive.  What\ncould she do to help him, now that he was so hard pressed?  The thought\nof abdication was odious to her, as to every woman.  Must she remain\ndirecting the ceremonies of the Court after the brilliancy had died\nout, while enemies were working night and day to overturn all that she\nwas attached to?\n\n\"Can I do nothing, nothing?\" she murmured.  \"Have I played my part?  Is\nthe best of life over?\" and then, with a hot wave of petulant resolve,\n\"I will do it,--but what?\"\n\nThe question remained unanswered; the edge of the sun dipped beneath\nthe horizon and at the end of the military mole, from the shapeless\nmound of earth that marked the protecting battery of the harbour,\nsprang a puff of smoke.  It was the evening gun, and the sound of the\nreport, floating faintly up to her, interrupted the unpleasing\nreflections which had filled her thoughts; but they left a memory\nbehind.  She turned with a sigh and re-entered the palace; gradually\nthe daylight died away and it became night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE MAN OF THE MULTITUDE.\n\nDismay and bitter anger filled the city.  The news of the fusilade\nspread fast and far, and, as is usual on such occasions, its effects\nwere greatly exaggerated.  But the police precautions were well\nconceived and ably carried out.  Nothing like a crowd was allowed to\ngather, and the constant patrolling of the streets prevented the\nbuilding of barricades.  The aspect of the Republican Guard was\nmoreover so formidable that, whatever the citizens might feel, they\nfound it discreet to display an acquiescent, and in some cases even a\ncontented demeanour.\n\nWith the leaders of the Popular party it was however different.  They\nimmediately assembled at the official residence of the Mayor, and a\nfurious discussion ensued.  In the hall of the Mayoralty an emergency\nmeeting was held, at which all the power of the party was represented.\nMoret, the Civic Councillor and former editor of the suppressed TRUMPET\nCALL, was much cheered as he entered the room.  His speech had appealed\nto many, and the Lauranians were always ready to applaud a daring act.\nBesides, every one was agitated by the recent riot and was eager to do\nsomething.  The Labour delegates were particularly angry.  Working-men,\nassembled in constitutional manner to express their grievances, had\nbeen shot down by a hireling soldiery,--_massacred_ was the word most\ngenerally used.  Vengeance must be taken; but how?  The wildest schemes\nwere suggested.  Moret, always for bold counsels, was for sallying into\nthe streets and rousing the people to arms; they would burn the palace,\nexecute the tyrant, and restore the liberties of the land.  Godoy, old\nand cautious, strongly opposed the suggestion, though indeed no\nparticular eagerness was shown to adopt it.  He advocated a calm and\ndignified attitude of reproach and censure, which would appeal to the\ncomity of nations and vindicate the justice of their cause.  Others\ntook up the argument.  Renos, the barrister, was for what he called\nconstitutional methods.  They should form themselves into a Committee\nof Public Safety; they should appoint the proper officers of State\n(including of course an Attorney-General), and decree the deposition of\nthe President for violation of the fundamental principles contained in\nthe preamble of the Declaration of National Rights.  He proceeded to\ndilate upon the legal points involved, until interrupted by several\nmembers who were anxious to offer their own remarks.\n\nSeveral resolutions were passed.  It was agreed that the President had\nforfeited the confidence of the citizens, and he was forthwith called\nupon to resign his office and submit himself to the Courts of Law.  It\nwas also agreed that the army had deserved ill of the Republic.  It was\nresolved to prosecute at civil law the soldiers who had fired on the\npeople, and a vote of sympathy was carried in favour of the relations\nof the killed and wounded, or _martyrs_ as they were called.\n\nThis scene of impotence and futility was ended by the entrance of the\nremarkable man who had raised a party from the dust, and had led them\nfrom one success to another until it had seemed that the victory was\nwon.  Silence fell upon the assemblage; some stood up in respect;\neveryone wondered what he would say.  How would he bear the crushing\ndefeat that had fallen upon them?  Would he despair of the movement?\nWould he be angry or sad or cynical?  Above all, what course would he\npropose?\n\nHe walked to the end of the long table around which the members were\ngrouped, and sat down deliberately.  Then he looked round the room,\nwith a face as calm and serene as ever.  In that scene of confusion and\nindecision he looked magnificent.  His very presence imparted a feeling\nof confidence to his followers.  His high and ample forehead might have\ncontained the answer to every question; his determined composure seemed\nequal to the utmost stroke of Fate.\n\nAfter a moment's pause, invited by the silence, he rose.  His words\nwere studiously moderate.  It had been a disappointment to him, he\nsaid, to find that the registers had been mutilated.  The ultimate\nsuccess was deferred, but it was only deferred.  He had waited before\ncoming to the Mayoralty to make a few calculations.  They were\nnecessarily rough and hurried, but he thought they were approximately\ncorrect.  The President, it was true, would have a majority in the\nforthcoming Parliament, and a substantial majority; but they would win\ncertain seats, in spite of the restricted electorate; about fifty, he\nthought, in a house of three hundred.  Smaller minorities than that had\noverthrown more powerful Governments.  Every day added to their\nstrength; every day increased the hatred of the Dictator.  Besides,\nthere were other alternatives than constitutional procedure,--and at\nthese words some set their teeth and looked at each other in deep\nsignificance--but for the present they must wait; and they could afford\nto wait, for the prize was worth winning.  It was the most precious\npossession in the world,--liberty.  He sat down amid brighter faces and\ncalmer minds.  The deliberations were resumed.  It was decided to\nrelieve, out of the general funds of the party, those who were in\npoverty through the massacre of their relations; that would increase\ntheir popularity with the working classes, and might win the sympathy\nof foreign nations.  A deputation should wait on the President to\nexpress the grief of the citizens at the mutilation of their ancient\nregister, and to beg that he would restore their franchises.  It should\nalso demand the punishment of the officers who had fired on the people,\nand should acquaint the President with the alarm and indignation of the\ncity.  Savrola, Godoy, and Renos were named as the members of the\ndeputation, and the Reform Committee then dispersed quietly.\n\nMoret lingered till the end and approached Savrola.  He was surprised\nthat he had not been suggested as a member of the deputation.  He knew\nhis leader much better than Renos, a pedantic lawyer who made few\nfriends: he had followed Savrola from the beginning with blind\nenthusiasm and devotion; and he now felt hurt that he should be passed\nover like this.\n\n\"It has been a bad day for us,\" he said tentatively; and then as\nSavrola did not reply, he continued, \"Who would have thought they would\nhave dared to trick us?\"\n\n\"It has been a very bad day,--for you,\" replied Savrola thoughtfully.\n\n\"For me?  Why, what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Have you reflected that you have forty human lives to answer for?\nYour speech was useless,--what good could it do?  Their blood is on\nyour head.  The people too are cowed.  Much harm has been done; it is\nyour fault.\"\n\n\"My fault!  I was furious,--he cheated us,--I thought only of revolt.\nI never dreamed you would sit down tamely like this.  That devil should\nbe killed now, at once,--before more mischief happens.\"\n\n\"Look here, Moret: I am as young as you; I feel as acutely; I am full\nof enthusiasm.  I, too, hate Molara more than is wise or philosophic;\nbut I contain myself, when nothing is to be gained by giving way.  Now\nmark my words.  Either you learn to do so, or you can go your ways, for\nI will have none of you,--politically, that is,--as a friend, it is\ndifferent.\"\n\nHe sat down and began to write a letter, while Moret, pale with that\nmortification which is made up of anger and self-reproach, and\nquivering under his rebuke, left the room in haste.\n\nSavrola remained.  There was much business to do that evening; letters\nhad to be written and read, the tone of the leading-articles in the\nDemocratic Press explained, and many other matters decided.  The\nmachinery of a great party, and still more of a great conspiracy,\nneeded careful and constant attention.  It was nine o'clock before he\nfinished.\n\n\"Well, good-night, Godoy,\" he said to the Major; \"we shall have another\nbusy day to-morrow.  We must contrive to frighten the Dictator.  Let me\nknow at what time he will give audience.\"\n\nAt the door of the Mayoralty he called a hackney-coach, a conveyance\nwhich neither the dulness of the social season nor the excitement of\npolitical affairs could restrain from its customary occupation.  After\na short drive he arrived at a small though not inelegant house, for he\nwas a man of means, in the most fashionable quarter of the town.  An\nold woman opened the door to his knock.  She looked rejoiced to see him.\n\n\"La,\" she said, \"I have had a fearful time with you away, and all this\nshooting and noise.  But the afternoons are chilly now and you should\nhave had your coat; I fear you will have a cold to-morrow.\"\n\n\"It is all right, Bettine,\" he answered kindly; \"I have a good chest,\nthanks to your care; but I am very tired.  Send me some soup to my\nroom; I will not dine to-night.\"\n\nHe went upstairs, while she bustled off to get him the best dinner she\ncould improvise.  The apartments he lived in were on the second\nstorey--a bedroom, a bathroom, and a study.  They were small, but full\nof all that taste and luxury could devise and affection and industry\npreserve.  A broad writing-table occupied the place of honour.  It was\narranged so that the light fell conveniently to the hand and head.  A\nlarge bronze inkstand formed the centrepiece, with a voluminous\nblotting-book of simple manufacture spread open before it.  The rest of\nthe table was occupied by papers on files.  The floor, in spite of the\nample waste-paper basket, was littered with scraps.  It was the\nwriting-table of a public man.\n\nThe room was lit by electric light in portable shaded lamps.  The walls\nwere covered with shelves, filled with well-used volumes.  To that\nPantheon of Literature none were admitted till they had been read and\nvalued.  It was a various library: the philosophy of Schopenhauer\ndivided Kant from Hegel, who jostled the Memoirs of St. Simon and the\nlatest French novel; RASSELAS and LA CUR\u00c3\u0089E lay side by side; eight\nsubstantial volumes of Gibbon's famous History were not perhaps\ninappropriately prolonged by a fine edition of the DECAMERON; the\nORIGIN OF SPECIES rested by the side of a black-letter Bible; THE\nREPUBLIC maintained an equilibrium with VANITY FAIR and the HISTORY OF\nEUROPEAN MORALS.  A volume of Macaulay's Essays lay on the\nwriting-table itself; it was open, and that sublime passage whereby the\ngenius of one man has immortalised the genius of another was marked in\npencil.  _And history, while for the warning of vehement, high, and\ndaring natures, she notes his many errors, will yet deliberately\npronounce that among the eminent men whose bones lie near his, scarcely\none has left a more stainless, and none a more splendid name_.\n\nA half-empty box of cigarettes stood on a small table near a low\nleathern armchair, and by its side lay a heavy army-revolver, against\nthe barrel of which the ashes of many cigarettes had been removed.  In\nthe corner of the room stood a small but exquisite Capitoline Venus,\nthe cold chastity of its colour reproaching the allurements of its\nform.  It was the chamber of a philosopher, but of no frigid, academic\nrecluse; it was the chamber of a man, a human man, who appreciated all\nearthly pleasures, appraised them at their proper worth, enjoyed, and\ndespised them.\n\nThere were still some papers and telegrams lying unopened on the table,\nbut Savrola was tired; they could, or at any rate should wait till the\nmorning.  He dropped into his chair.  Yes, it had been a long day, and\na gloomy day.  He was a young man, only thirty-two, but already he felt\nthe effects of work and worry.  His nervous temperament could not fail\nto be excited by the vivid scenes through which he had lately passed,\nand the repression of his emotion only heated the inward fire.  Was it\nworth it?  The struggle, the labour, the constant rush of affairs, the\nsacrifice of so many things that make life easy, or pleasant--for what?\nA people's good!  That, he could not disguise from himself, was rather\nthe direction than the cause of his efforts.  Ambition was the motive\nforce, and he was powerless to resist it.  He could appreciate the\ndelights of an artist, a life devoted to the search for beauty, or of\nsport, the keenest pleasure that leaves no sting behind.  To live in\ndreamy quiet and philosophic calm in some beautiful garden, far from\nthe noise of men and with every diversion that art and intellect could\nsuggest, was, he felt, a more agreeable picture.  And yet he knew that\nhe could not endure it.  'Vehement, high, and daring' was his cast of\nmind.  The life he lived was the only one he could ever live; he must\ngo on to the end.  The end comes often early to such men, whose spirits\nare so wrought that they know rest only in action, contentment in\ndanger, and in confusion find their only peace.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the entrance of the old woman with a\ntray.  He was tired, but the decencies of life had to be observed; he\nrose, and passed into the inner room to change his clothes and make his\ntoilet.  When he returned, the table was laid; the soup he had asked\nfor had been expanded by the care of his house-keeper into a more\nelaborate meal.  She waited on him, plying him the while with questions\nand watching his appetite with anxious pleasure.  She had nursed him\nfrom his birth up with a devotion and care which knew no break.  It is\na strange thing, the love of these women.  Perhaps it is the only\ndisinterested affection in the world.  The mother loves her child; that\nis material nature.  The youth loves his sweetheart; that too may be\nexplained.  The dog loves his master; he feeds him; a man loves his\nfriend; he has stood by him perhaps at doubtful moments.  In all there\nare reasons; but the love of a foster-mother for her charge appears\nabsolutely irrational.  It is one of the few proofs, not to be\nexplained even by the association of ideas, that the nature of mankind\nis superior to mere utilitarianism, and that his destinies are high.\n\nThe light and frugal supper finished, the old woman departed with the\nplates, and he fell to his musings again.  Several difficult affairs\nimpended in the future, about the conduct of which he was doubtful.  He\ndismissed them from his mind; why should he be always oppressed with\nmatters of fact?  What of the night?  He rose, walked to the window,\nand drawing the curtains looked out.  The street was very quiet, but in\nthe distance he thought he heard the tramp of a patrol.  All the houses\nwere dark and sullen; overhead the stars shone brightly; it was a\nperfect night to watch them.\n\nHe closed the window and taking a candle walked to a curtained door on\none side of the room; it opened on a narrow, spiral stair which led to\nthe flat roof.  Most of the houses in Laurania were low, and Savrola\nwhen he reached the leads overlooked the sleeping city.  Lines of\ngas-lamps marked the streets and squares, and brighter dots indicated\nthe positions of the shipping in the harbour.  But he did not long look\nat these; he was for the moment weary of men and their works.  A small\nglass observatory stood in one corner of this aerial platform, the nose\nof the telescope showing through the aperture.  He unlocked the door\nand entered.  This was a side of his life that the world never saw; he\nwas no mathematician intent on discovery or fame, but he loved to watch\nthe stars for the sake of their mysteries.  By a few manipulations the\ntelescope was directed at the beautiful planet of Jupiter, at this time\nhigh in the northern sky.  The glass was a powerful one, and the great\nplanet, surrounded by his attendant moons, glowed with splendour.  The\nclock-work gear enabled him to keep it under continual observation as\nthe earth rolled over with the hours.  Long he watched it, becoming\neach moment more under the power of the spell that star-gazing\nexercises on curious, inquiring humanity.\n\nAt last he rose, his mind still far away from earth.  Molara, Moret,\nthe Party, the exciting scenes of the day, all seemed misty and unreal;\nanother world, a world more beautiful, a world of boundless\npossibilities, enthralled his imagination.  He thought of the future of\nJupiter, of the incomprehensible periods of time that would elapse\nbefore the cooling process would render life possible on its surface,\nof the slow steady march of evolution, merciless, inexorable.  How far\nwould it carry them, the unborn inhabitants of an embryo world?\nPerhaps only to some vague distortion of the vital essence; perhaps\nfurther than he could dream of.  All the problems would be solved, all\nthe obstacles overcome; life would attain perfect developement.  And\nthen fancy, overleaping space and time, carried the story to periods\nstill more remote.  The cooling process would continue; the perfect\ndevelopement of life would end in death; the whole solar system, the\nwhole universe itself, would one day be cold and lifeless as a\nburned-out firework.\n\nIt was a mournful conclusion.  He locked up the observatory and\ndescended the stairs, hoping that his dreams would contradict his\nthoughts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE DEPUTATION.\n\nIt was the President's custom to rise early, but before doing so he\ninvariably received the newspapers and read such remarks as dealt with\nthe policy of the Government or criticised its actions.  This morning\nhis literature was exceptionally plentiful.  All the papers had leading\narticles on the restriction of the franchise and the great riot which\nhad followed its announcement.  He first opened THE HOUR, the organ of\northodox mediocrity, which usually cautiously supported the Government\nin consideration of occasional pieces of news with which it was from\ntime to time favoured.  In a column and a half of print THE HOUR gently\nregretted that the President had been unable to restore the franchises\nunimpaired; it thus gratified the bulk of its readers.  In a second\ncolumn it expressed its severe disapproval--(_unqualified condemnation_\nwas the actual term)--of the disgraceful riot which had led to such\n_deplorable consequences_; it thus repaid the President for sending\nround the text of the English note, which had arrived the night before,\nand which it printed _verbatim_ with pomp and circumstance as coming\nfrom Our Special Correspondent in London.\n\nTHE COURTIER, the respectable morning journal of the upper classes,\nregretted that so unseemly a riot should have taken place at the\nbeginning of the season, and expressed a hope that it would not in any\nway impair the brilliancy of the State Ball which was to take place on\nthe 7th.  It gave an excellent account of the President's first\nministerial dinner, with the _menu_ duly appended, and it was concerned\nto notice that Se\u00c3\u00b1or Louvet, Minister of the Interior, had been\nsuffering from an indisposition which prevented his attending the\nfunction.  THE DIURNAL GUSHER, a paper with an enormous circulation,\nrefrained from actual comments but published an excellent account of\nthe _massacre_, to the harrowing details of which it devoted much\nfruity sentiment and morbid imagination.\n\nThese were practically the organs on which the Government relied for\nsupport, and the President always read them first to fortify himself\nagainst the columns of abuse with which the Radical, Popular, and\nDemocratic Press saluted him, his Government, and all his works.  The\nworst result of an habitual use of strong language is that when a\nspecial occasion really does arise, there is no way of marking it.  THE\nFABIAN, THE SUNSPOT, and THE RISING TIDE had already exhausted every\nepithet in their extensive vocabularies on other and less important\nincidents.  Now that a severe fusilade had been made upon the citizens\nand an ancient privilege attacked, they were reduced to comparative\nmoderation as the only outlet for their feelings.  They had compared\nthe Head of the State so often and so vividly to Nero and Iscariot,\nvery much to the advantage of those worthies, that it was difficult to\nknow how they could deal with him now.  They nevertheless managed to\nfind a few unused expressions, and made a great point of the\nMinisterial dinner as being an instance of his \"brutal disregard of the\ncommonest instincts of humanity.\"  THE SUNSPOT was thought by its\nreaders to have been particularly happy in alluding to the ministers\nas, \"Indulging in a foul orgie of gluttony and dipping their\nblood-stained fingers in choice dishes, while the bodies of their\nvictims lay unburied and unavenged.\"\n\nHaving finished his perusal the President pushed the last paper off the\nbed and frowned.  He cared nothing for criticism, but he knew the power\nof the Press and he knew that it reflected as well as influenced public\nopinion.  There could be no doubt that the balance was rising against\nhim.\n\nAt breakfast he was moody and silent, and Lucile tactfully refrained\nfrom irritating him by the laboured commonplaces of matutinal\nconversation.  By nine o'clock he was always at work and this morning\nhe began earlier than usual.  The Secretary was already at his table\nbusily writing when Molara entered.  He rose and bowed, a formal bow,\nwhich seemed an assertion of equality rather than a tribute of respect.\nThe President nodded and walked to his table on which such parts of\ncorrespondence as needed his personal attention were neatly arranged.\nHe sat down and began to read.  Occasionally he uttered an exclamation\nof assent or disapproval, and his pencil was often employed to express\nhis decisions and opinions.  From time to time Miguel collected the\npapers he had thus dealt with and carried them to the inferior\nsecretaries in the adjoining room, whose duty it was to elaborate into\nthe stately pomposity of official language such phrases as \"Curt\nRefusal\" \"Certainly not\" \"Apply to War Office\" \"Gushing Reply\" \"I do\nnot agree\" \"See last year's Report.\"\n\nLucile also had letters to read and write.  Having finished these she\ndetermined to take a drive in the park.  For the last few weeks, since,\nin fact, they had returned from their summer residence, she had\ndiscontinued what had been in former years her usual practice; but\nafter the scenes and riots of the day before she felt it her duty to\ndisplay a courage which she did not feel.  It might help her husband,\nfor her beauty was such that an artistic people invariably showed her\nrespect.  It could at least do no harm, and besides she was weary of\nthe palace and its gardens.  With this intention her carriage was\nordered and she was about to enter it, when a young man arrived at the\ndoor.  He saluted her gravely.\n\nIt was the boast of the citizens of the Republic of Laurania that they\nnever brought politics into private life or private life into politics.\nHow far they justified it will appear later.  The present situation had\nundoubtedly strained the principle to the full, but civilities were\nstill exchanged between political antagonists.  Lucile, who had known\nthe great Democrat as a frequent visitor at her father's house before\nthe Civil War, and who had always kept up a formal acquaintance with\nhim, smiled and bowed in return and asked whether he came to see the\nPresident.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied.  \"I have an appointment.\"\n\n\"Public matters I suppose?\" she inquired with the suspicion of a smile.\n\n\"Yes,\" he repeated somewhat abruptly.\n\n\"How tiresome you all are,\" she said daringly, \"with your public\nbusinesses and solemn looks.  I hear nothing but matters of State from\nmorning till night, and now, when I fly the palace for an hour's\nrelaxation, they meet me at the very door.\"\n\nSavrola smiled.  It was impossible to resist her charm.  The admiration\nhe had always felt for her beauty and her wit asserted itself in spite\nof the watchful and determined state of mind into which he had thrown\nhimself as a preparation for his interview with the President.  He was\na young man, and Jupiter was not the only planet he admired.  \"Your\nExcellency,\" he said, \"must acquit me of all intention.\"\n\n\"I do,\" she answered laughing, \"and release you from all further\npunishment.\"\n\nShe signed to the coachman and bowing, drove off.\n\nHe entered the palace and was ushered by a footman resplendent in the\nblue and buff liveries of the Republic, into an ante-room.  A young\nofficer of the Guard, the Lieutenant who had commanded the escort on\nthe previous day, received him.  The President would be disengaged in a\nfew minutes.  The other members of the deputation had not yet arrived;\nin the meantime would he take a chair?  The Lieutenant regarded him\ndubiously, as one might view some strange animal, harmless enough to\nlook at, but about whose strength, when roused, there were\nextraordinary stories.  He had been brought up in the most correct\nregimental ideas: the people (by which he meant the mob) were \"swine\";\ntheir leaders were the same, with an adjective prefixed; democratic\ninstitutions, Parliament, and such like, were all \"rot.\"  It therefore\nappeared that he and Savrola would find few topics in common.  But\nbesides his good looks and good manners, the young soldier had other\nattainments; his men knew him as \"all right\" and \"all there,\" while the\nLancers of the Guard polo team regarded him as a most promising player.\n\nSavrola, whose business it was to know everything, inquired respecting\nthe project lately mooted by the Lauranian Cavalry of sending a polo\nteam to England to compete in the great annual tournament at\nHurlingham.  Lieutenant Tiro (for that was his name) addressed himself\nto the subject with delight.  They disputed as to who should be taken\nas \"back.\"  The discussion was only interrupted by the entrance of the\nMayor and Renos, and the Subaltern went off to inform the President\nthat the deputation waited.\n\n\"I will see them at once,\" said Molara; \"show them up here.\"\n\nThe deputation were accordingly conducted up the stairs to the\nPresident's private room.  He rose and received them with courtesy.\nGodoy stated the grievances of the citizens.  He recalled the protests\nthey had made against the unconstitutional government of the last five\nyears, and their delight at the President's promise to call the Estates\ntogether.  He described their bitter disappointment at the restriction\nof the franchise, and their keen desire that it should be fully\nrestored.  He dilated on their indignation at the cruelty with which\nthe soldiers had shot down unarmed men, and finally declared that, as\nMayor, he could not vouch for their continued loyalty to the President\nor their respect for his person.  Renos spoke in the same strain,\ndwelling particularly on the legal aspect of the President's late\naction, and on the gravity of its effects as a precedent to posterity.\n\nMolara replied at some length.  He pointed out the disturbed state of\nthe country, and particularly of the capital; he alluded to the\ndisorders of the late war and the sufferings it had caused to the mass\nof the people.  What the State wanted was strong stable government.  As\nthings became more settled the franchise should be extended until it\nwould ultimately be completely restored.  In the meanwhile, what was\nthere to complain about?  Law and order were maintained; the public\nservice was well administered; the people enjoyed peace and security.\nMore than that, a vigorous foreign policy held the honour of the\ncountry high.  They should have an instance.\n\nHe turned and requested Miguel to read the reply to the English note on\nthe African Dispute.  The Secretary stood up and read the paper in\nquestion, his soft, purring voice, proving well suited to emphasising\nthe insults it contained.\n\n\"And that, Gentlemen,\" said the President, when it was finished, \"is\naddressed to one of the greatest military and naval powers in the\nworld.\"\n\nGodoy and Renos were silent.  Their patriotism was roused; their pride\nwas gratified; but Savrola smiled provokingly.  \"It will take more than\ndespatches,\" he said, \"to keep the English out of the African sphere,\nor to reconcile the people of Laurania to your rule.\"\n\n\"And if stronger measures should be necessary,\" said the President,\n\"rest assured they will be taken.\"\n\n\"After the events of yesterday we need no such assurance.\"\n\nThe President ignored the taunt.  \"I know the English Government,\" he\ncontinued; \"they will not appeal to arms.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Savrola, \"know the Lauranian people.  I am not so\nconfident.\"\n\nThere was a long pause.  Both men faced each other, and their eyes met.\nIt was the look of two swordsmen who engage, and it was the look of two\nbitter enemies; they appeared to measure distances and calculate\nchances.  Then Savrola turned away, the ghost of a smile still\nlingering on his lips; but he had read the President's heart and he\nfelt as if he had looked into hell.\n\n\"It is a matter of opinion, Sir,\" said Molara at last.\n\n\"It will soon be a matter of history.\"\n\n\"Other tales will have to be told before,\" said the President, and then\nwith great formality, \"I am obliged to you, Mr. Mayor and Gentlemen,\nfor representing the dangerous elements of disorder which exist among\ncertain classes of the people.  You may rely on every precaution being\ntaken to prevent an outbreak.  I beg you will keep me further informed.\nGood morning.\"\n\nThe only course open appeared to be the door, and the deputation\nwithdrew, after Savrola had thanked the President for his audience and\nhad assured him that he would lose no opportunity of bringing home to\nhim the hostile attitude of the citizens.  On the way down-stairs they\nwere met by Lucile, who had returned unexpectedly early from her drive.\nShe saw by the expression of their faces that a heated discussion had\ntaken place.  Godoy and Renos she passed unnoticed, but she smiled\nmerrily at Savrola, as if to convey to him that she was uninterested by\npolitics and could not understand how people ever managed to get\nexcited about them.  The smile did not deceive him; he knew too much of\nher tastes and talents, but he admired her all the more for her acting.\n\nHe walked home.  The interview had not been altogether unsatisfactory.\nHe had never hoped to convince the President; that indeed was hardly\nlikely; but they had expressed the views of the people, and Godoy and\nRenos had already sent copies of their remarks to the newspapers, so\nthat the party could not complain of their leaders' inaction at such a\ncrisis.  He thought he had frightened Molara, if indeed it were\npossible to frighten such a man; at any rate he had made him angry.\nWhen he thought of this he was glad.  Why?  He had always hitherto\nrepressed such unphilosophic and futile emotions so far as possible,\nbut somehow to-day he felt his dislike of the President was invested\nwith a darker tinge.  And then his mind reverted to Lucile.  What a\nbeautiful woman she was!  How full of that instinctive knowledge of\nhuman feelings which is the source of all true wit!  Molara was a lucky\nman to have such a wife.  Decidedly he hated him personally, but that,\nof course, was on account of his unconstitutional conduct.\n\nWhen he reached his rooms, Moret was awaiting him, much excited and\nevidently angry.  He had written several long letters to his leader,\nacquainting him with his unalterable decision to sever all connection\nwith him and his party; but he had torn them all up, and was now\nresolved to tell him in plain words.\n\nSavrola saw his look.  \"Ah, Louis,\" he cried, \"I am glad you are here.\nHow good of you to come!  I have just left the President; he is\nrecalcitrant; he will not budge an inch.  I need your advice.  What\ncourse shall we adopt?\"\n\n\"What has happened?\" asked the young man, sulkily but curiously.\n\nSavrola related the interview with graphic terseness.  Moret listened\nattentively and then said, still with great ill humour, \"Physical force\nis the only argument he understands.  I am for raising the people.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" said Savrola reflectively, \"I am half inclined\nto agree with you.\"\n\nMoret argued his proposition with vigour and earnestness, and never had\nhis leader seemed so agreeable to the violent measures he proposed.\nFor half an hour they discussed the point.  Savrola still appeared\nunconvinced; he looked at his watch.  \"It is past two o'clock,\" he\nsaid.  \"Let us lunch here and thrash the matter out.\"\n\nThey did so.  The luncheon was excellent, and the host's arguments\nbecame more and more convincing.  At last, with the coffee, Moret\nadmitted that perhaps it was better to wait, and they parted with great\ncordiality.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nA PRIVATE CONVERSATION.\n\n\"That,\" said the President to his confidential secretary, so soon as\nthe door had closed on the retiring deputation, \"is over, but we shall\nhave plenty more in the future.  Savrola will most certainly be elected\nfor the Central Division, and we shall then have the pleasure of\nlistening to him in the Senate.\"\n\n\"Unless,\" added Miguel, \"anything should happen.\"\n\nThe President, who knew his man well, understood the implication.  \"No,\nit is no good; we cannot do that.  Fifty years ago it might have been\npossible.  People won't stand that sort of thing now-a-days; even the\narmy might have scruples.  So long as he keeps within the law, I don't\nsee how we can touch him constitutionally.\"\n\n\"He is a great force, a great force; sometimes, I think, the greatest\nin Laurania.  Every day he grows stronger.  Presently the end will\ncome,\" said the Secretary slowly and thoughtfully, who, as the partner\nof Molara's dangers, no less than of his actions, had a claim to be\nheard.  \"I think the end is coming,\" he continued; \"perhaps quite\nsoon--unless----?\" he paused.\n\n\"I tell you it can't be done.  Any accident that happened would be\nattributed to me.  It would mean a revolution here, and close every\nasylum abroad.\"\n\n\"There are other ways besides force, physical force.\"\n\n\"None that I can see, and he is a strong man.\"\n\n\"So was Samson, nevertheless the Philistines spoiled him.\"\n\n\"Through a woman.  I don't believe he has ever been in love.\"\n\n\"That is no reason against the future.\"\n\n\"Wanted a Delilah,\" said the President dryly.  \"Perhaps you will find\none for him.\"\n\nThe Secretary's eyes wandered round the room artlessly, and paused for\na moment on a photograph of Lucile.\n\n\"How dare you, Sir!  You are a scoundrel!  You have not an ounce of\nvirtue in you!\"\n\n\"We have been associated for some time, General.\"  He always called him\n_General_ on these occasions, it reminded the President of various\nlittle incidents which had taken place when they had worked together\nduring the war.  \"Perhaps that is the cause.\"\n\n\"You are impertinent.\"\n\n\"My interests are concerned.  I too have enemies.  You know very well\nhow much my life would be worth without the protection of the Secret\nPolice.  I only remember with whom and for whom these things were done.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am hasty, Miguel, but there is a limit, even between----\"\nHe was going to say _friends_ but Miguel interposed _accomplices_.\n\"Well,\" said Molara, \"I do not care what you call it.  What is your\nproposition?\"\n\n\"The Philistines,\" replied Miguel, \"spoiled Samson, but Delilah had to\ncut his hair first.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that she should implore him to hold his hand?\"\n\n\"No, I think that would be useless, but if he were compromised----\"\n\n\"But she, she would not consent.  It would involve her.\"\n\n\"She need not necessarily know.  Another object for making his\nacquaintance might be suggested.  It would come as a surprise to her.\"\n\n\"You are a scoundrel--an infernal scoundrel,\" said the President\nquietly.\n\nMiguel smiled, as one who receives a compliment.  \"The matter,\" he\nsaid, \"is too serious for the ordinary rules of decency and honour.\nSpecial cases demand special remedies.\"\n\n\"She would never forgive me.\"\n\n\"The forgiveness would rest with you.  Your charity would enable you to\npardon an uncommitted crime.  You have only to play the jealous husband\nand own your mistake later on.\"\n\n\"And he?\"\n\n\"Fancy the great popular leader.  Patriot, Democrat, what not,\ndiscovered fawning to the tyrant's wife!  Why, the impropriety alone\nwould disgust many.  And more than that,--observe him begging for\nmercy, grovelling at the President's feet,--a pretty picture!  It would\nruin him; ridicule alone would kill him.\"\n\n\"It might,\" said Molara.  The picture pleased him.\n\n\"It must.  It is the only chance that I can see, and it need cost you\nnothing.  Every woman is secretly flattered by the jealousy of the man\nshe loves, even if he be her husband.\"\n\n\"How do you know these things?\" asked Molara, looking at the ugly\npinched figure and glistening hair of his companion.\n\n\"_I_ know,\" said Miguel with a grin of odious pride.  The suggestion of\nhis appetites was repulsive.  The President was conscious of disgust.\n\"Mr. Secretary Miguel,\" he said with the air of one who has made up his\nmind, \"I must request you not to speak to me of this matter again.  I\nconsider it shows less to the advantage of your heart than of your\nhead.\"\n\n\"I see by Your Excellency's manner that further allusion is\nunnecessary.\"\n\n\"Have you the report of the Agricultural Committee for last year?\nGood,--please have a _pr\u00c3\u00a9cis_ made of it; I want some facts.  The\ncountry may be kept, even if we lose the capital; that means a good\npart of the army.\"\n\nThus the subject dropped.  Each understood the other, and behind lay\nthe spur of danger.\n\nAfter the President had finished the morning's business, he rose to\nleave the room, but before he did so he turned to Miguel and said\nabruptly: \"It would be a great convenience for us to know what course\nthe Opposition intends to pursue on the opening of the Senate, would it\nnot?\"\n\n\"Assuredly.\"\n\n\"How can we induce Savrola to speak?  He is incorruptible.\"\n\n\"There is another method.\"\n\n\"I tell you physical force is not to be thought of.\"\n\n\"There is another method.\"\n\n\"And that,\" said the President, \"I directed you not to speak of again.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said the Secretary, and resumed his writing.\n\nThe garden into which Molara walked was one of the most beautiful and\nfamous in a country where all vegetation attained luxuriant forms.  The\nsoil was fertile, the sun hot, and the rains plentiful.  It displayed\nan attractive disorder.  The Lauranians were no admirers of that\npeculiar taste which finds beauty in the exact arrangement of an equal\nnumber of small trees of symmetrical shape in mathematical designs, or\nin the creation of geometrical figures by means of narrow paths with\nbox-hedges.  They were an unenlightened people, and their gardens\ndisplayed a singular contempt for geometry and precision.  Great blazes\nof colour arranged in pleasing contrasts were the lights, and cool\ngreen arbours the shades of their rural pictures.  Their ideal of\ngardening was to make every plant grow as freely as if directed by\nnature, and to as high perfection as if cultivated by art.  If the\nresult was not artistic, it was at least beautiful.\n\nThe President, however, cared very little for flowers or their\narrangement; he was, he said, too busy a man to have anything to do\nwith the beauties of colour, harmony, or line.  Neither the tints of\nthe rose nor the smell of the jasmine awakened in him more than the\nrudimentary physical pleasures which are natural and involuntary.  He\nliked to have a good flower garden, because it was the right thing to\nhave, because it enabled him to take people there and talk to them\npersonally on political matters, and because it was convenient for\nafternoon receptions.  But he himself took no interest in it.  The\nkitchen garden appealed to him more; his practical soul rejoiced more\nin an onion than an orchid.\n\nHe was full of thought after his conversation with Miguel, and turned\ndown the shady path which led to the fountains with long, hasty\nstrides.  Things were looking desperate.  It was, as Miguel had said, a\nquestion of time, unless,--unless Savrola were removed or discredited.\nHe refrained from precisely formulating the idea that had taken\npossession of his mind.  He had done many things in the rough days of\nthe war when he was a struggling man, the memory of which was not\npleasant.  He remembered a brother officer, a rising man, the colonel\nof a regiment, who had been a formidable rival; at a critical moment he\nhad withheld the supports, and left it to the enemy to remove one\nobstacle from his path.  Then another tale came into his mind which\nalso was not a pretty one, a tale of a destroyed treaty, and a broken\ntruce; of men, who had surrendered to terms, shot against the wall of\nthe fort they had held so long.  He also recalled with annoyance the\nmethods he had adopted to extract information from the captured spy;\nfive years of busy life, of success and fortune, had not obscured the\nmemory of the man's face as it writhed in suffering.  But this new idea\nseemed the most odious of all.  He was unscrupulous, but like many men\nin history or modern life, he had tried to put away a discreditable\npast.  Henceforth, he had said when he obtained power, he would abandon\nsuch methods: they would no longer be necessary; and yet, here was the\nneed already.  Besides, Lucile was so beautiful; he loved her in his\nhard way for that alone; and she was such a consort, so tactful, so\nbrilliant, that he admired and valued her from a purely official\nstandpoint.  If she ever knew, she would never forgive him.  She never\nshould know, but still he hated the idea.\n\nBut what other course remained?  He thought of the faces of the crowd\nthe day before; of Savrola; of the stories which reached him from the\narmy; of other tales of a darker and more mysterious kind,--tales of\nstrange federations and secret societies, which suggested murder, as\nwell as revolution.  The tide was rising; it was dangerous to tarry.\n\nAnd then the alternative presented itself; flight, abdication, a\nsqualid existence in some foreign country, despised, insulted,\nsuspected; and exiles always lived to a great age he had heard.  He\nwould not think of it; he would die first; nothing but death should\ndrag him from the palace, and he would fight to the last.  His mind\nreturned to the starting point of his reflections.  Here was a chance,\nthe one solution which seemed possible; it was not an agreeable one,\nbut it was that or none.  He had reached the end of the path and\nturning the corner saw Lucile seated by the fountain.  It was a\nbeautiful picture.\n\nShe saw his preoccupied look and rose to meet him.  \"What is the\nmatter, Antonio?  You look worried.\"\n\n\"Things are going wrong with us, my dear.  Savrola, the deputation, the\nnewspapers, and, above all, the reports I receive of the people, are\nominous and alarming.\"\n\n\"I noticed black looks this morning when I drove.  Do you think there\nis danger?\"\n\n\"I do,\" he answered in his precise official manner, \"grave danger.\"\n\n\"I wish I could help you,\" she said, \"but I am only a woman.  What can\nI do?\"  He did not answer and she continued: \"Se\u00c3\u00b1or Savrola is a kind\nman.  I used to know him quite well before the war.\"\n\n\"He will ruin us.\"\n\n\"Surely not.\"\n\n\"We shall have to fly the country, if indeed they allow us to do that.\"\n\nShe turned paler.  \"But I know what men look like; there is a sympathy\nbetween us; he is no fanatic.\"\n\n\"There are powers behind and beneath him of which he knows little,\nwhich he cannot control, but which he has invoked.\"\n\n\"Can you do nothing?\"\n\n\"I cannot arrest him; he is too popular, and besides he has broken no\nlaw.  He will go on.  In a fortnight are the elections; he will be\nreturned in spite of my precautions; then the trouble will begin.\"  He\npaused, and then speaking as if to himself continued: \"If we could\nlearn what he means to do, perhaps we might defeat it.\"\n\n\"Can I not help you?\" she asked quickly.  \"I know him; I think he likes\nme.  He might whisper to me what he would not tell to others.\"  She\nthought of many victories in the past.\n\n\"My darling,\" said Molara, \"why should you spoil your life by mixing in\nthe darker side of politics?  I would not ask you.\"\n\n\"But I want to.  I will try if it would help you.\"\n\n\"It might do much more.\"\n\n\"Very well, I will find out for you; in a fortnight you shall know.  He\nmust come to the State Ball; I will meet him there.\"\n\n\"I am loth to let you talk to such a man, but I know your wit, and the\nneed is great.  But will he come?\"\n\n\"I will write him a note with the invitation,\" she said, \"laugh at\npolitics and advise him to keep his private life at least free from\nthem.  I think he will come; if not, I will find some other way of\nseeing him.\"\n\nMolara looked at her with admiration.  At no time did he love her more\nthan when he realised of what use she was to him.  \"I leave it to you,\nthen.  I fear you will fail, but if you can do it, you may have saved\nthe State.  If not, no harm will have been done.\"\n\n\"I shall succeed,\" she answered confidently, and rising from her seat\nbegan to walk towards the house.  She saw from her husband's manner\nthat he would like to be alone.\n\nHe remained seated there for a long time, staring into the water in\nwhich the fat, lazy, gold fish swam placidly.  His face wore the\nexpression of one who has swallowed some nasty thing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nON CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS.\n\nThe sagacious founders of the Lauranian Republic had recognised the\nimportance of preserving and promoting the practice of social\ncivilities between the public men of the State, irrespective of party.\nIt had therefore long been the custom for the President to give several\nofficial entertainments during the autumn season, to which all the\ndistinguished characters of either side were invited, and which it was\nconsidered _etiquette_ to attend.  This year feeling ran so high and\nrelations were so strained that Savrola had decided not to accept, and\nhad already formally declined the invitation; he was therefore not a\nlittle surprised when he received a second card, and still more when he\nread Lucile's note which accompanied it.\n\nHe saw she had exposed herself to a rebuff with her eyes open, and\nwondered why she had done so.  Of course she counted on her charms.  It\nis hard, if not impossible, to snub a beautiful woman; they remain\nbeautiful and the rebuke recoils.  He might indeed have made political\ncapital out of so pressing an invitation sent at such a critical time;\nbut he felt she had judged him well, and knew she was safe at least\nfrom that.  This pleased him.  He was sorry he could not go; but he had\nmade up his mind, and sat down to write and decline.  Half way through\nthe letter, he paused; the thought occurred to him, that perhaps she\nmight stand in need of his help.  He read the letter again and fancied,\nthough the words did not warrant it, that he detected a note of appeal.\nAnd then he began to look for reasons for changing his mind: the old\nestablished custom; the necessity of showing his followers that for the\npresent he was in favour of constitutional agitation only; the\nopportunity of displaying his confidence in the success of his plans;\nin fact, every argument, but the true one, was arrayed against his\ndetermination.\n\nYes, he would go: the party might object, but he did not care; it was\nnone of their business, and he was strong enough to face their\ndispleasure.  These reflections were interrupted by the entrance of\nMoret, his face glowing with enthusiasm.\n\n\"The Central Division Committee have nominated you unanimously as their\ncandidate at the elections.  The Dictator's puppet, Tranta, was howled\ndown.  I have arranged for a public meeting on Thursday night for you\nto address.  We are on the crest of the wave!\"\n\n\"Capital!\" said Savrola.  \"I had expected to be nominated; our\ninfluence in the capital is supreme.  I am glad of an opportunity of\nspeaking; I have not had a meeting for some time, and there is a good\ndeal to talk about just now.  What day did you say you had arranged it\nfor?\"\n\n\"Thursday in the City-Hall at eight in the evening,\" said Moret, who,\nthough sanguine, was not unbusiness-like.\n\n\"Thursday?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are not engaged anywhere.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Savrola speaking slowly and appearing to weigh his words,\n\"Thursday is the night of the State Ball.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Moret, \"that was why I arranged it so.  They will feel\nthey are dancing on a volcano; only a mile from the palace will be the\npeople, massed, agreed, determined.  Molara will not enjoy his evening;\nLouvet will not go; Sorrento will be making arrangements to massacre,\nif necessary.  It will spoil the festivities; they will all see the\nwriting on the wall.\"\n\n\"Thursday will not do, Moret.\"\n\n\"Not do!  Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I am going to the ball that night,\" said Savrola deliberately.\n\nMoret gasped.  \"What,\" he cried, \"you!\"\n\n\"Most certainly I shall go.  The ancient customs of the State cannot be\nset aside like this.  It is my duty to go; we are fighting for the\nConstitution, and we are bound to show our respect for its principles.\"\n\n\"You will accept Molara's hospitality,--enter his house,--eat his food?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Savrola; \"I shall eat the food provided by the State.  As\nyou well know, the expenses of these official functions are chargeable\nto the public.\"\n\n\"You will talk to him?\"\n\n\"Certainly, but he will not enjoy it.\"\n\n\"You will insult him, then?\"\n\n\"My dear Moret, what should make you think that?  I shall be very\ncivil.  That will frighten him most of all; he will not know what is\nimpending.\"\n\n\"You cannot go,\" said Moret decidedly.\n\n\"Indeed I am going.\"\n\n\"Think what the Trade-Unions will say.\"\n\n\"I have thought about all these things and have made up my mind,\" said\nSavrola.  \"They may say what they like.  It will show them that I do\nnot intend to discard Constitutional methods for a long time yet.\nThese people want their enthusiasm cooling from time to time; they take\nlife too seriously.\"\n\n\"They will accuse you of betraying the cause.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt stupid people will make characteristic remarks, but I\ntrust none of my friends will bore me by repeating them to me.\"\n\n\"What will Strelitz say?  It will very likely make him cross the\nfrontier with his followers.  He thinks we are lukewarm, and has been\ngrowing more impatient every week.\"\n\n\"If he comes before we are ready to help, the troops will make short\nwork of him and his rabble.  But he has definite orders from me and\nwill, I hope, obey them.\"\n\n\"You are doing wrong, and you know it,\" said Moret harshly and\nsavagely; \"to say nothing of the contemptible humiliation of cringing\nto your enemy.\"\n\nSavrola smiled at his follower's anger.  \"Oh,\" he said, \"I shall not\ncringe.  Come, you have not yet seen me do that,\" and he put his hand\non his companion's arm.  \"It is strange, Louis,\" he continued, \"that we\ndiffer in so many things, and yet, if I were in difficulty and doubt,\nthere is no one to whom I would go sooner than to you.  We squabble\nabout trifles, but if it were a great matter, your judgment should rule\nme, and you know it well.\"\n\nMoret yielded.  He always yielded to Savrola when he talked like that.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"when will you speak?\"\n\n\"Whenever you like.\"\n\n\"Friday, then, the sooner the better.\"\n\n\"Very well; do you make the arrangements; I will find something to say.\"\n\n\"I wish you were not going,\" said Moret, reverting to his former\nobjection; \"nothing on earth would induce me to go.\"\n\n\"Moret,\" said Savrola with strange earnestness, \"we have settled that;\nthere are other things to talk about.  I am troubled in my mind.  There\nis an undercurrent of agitation, the force of which I cannot gauge.  I\nam the acknowledged leader of the party, but sometimes I realise that\nthere are agencies at work, which I do not control.  That secret\nsociety they call the League is an unknown factor.  I hate that fellow,\nthat German fellow, Kreutze, Number One as he styles himself.  He is\nthe source of all the opposition I encounter in the party itself; the\nLabour Delegates all seem to be under his influence.  Indeed there are\nmoments when I think that you and I and Godoy and all who are striving\nfor the old Constitution, are but the political waves of a social tide\nthat is flowing we know not whither.  Perhaps I am wrong, but I keep my\neyes open and their evidence makes me thoughtful.  The future is\ninscrutable but appalling; you must stand by me.  When I can no longer\nrestrain and control, I will no longer lead.\"\n\n\"The League is nothing,\" said Moret, \"but a small anarchist group, who\nhave thrown in their lot, for the present, with us.  You are the\nindispensable leader of the party; you have created the agitation, and\nit is in your hands to stimulate or allay it.  There are no unknown\nforces; you are the motive power.\"\n\nSavrola walked to the window.  \"Look out over the city,\" he said.  \"It\nis a great mass of buildings; three hundred thousand people live there.\nConsider its size; think of the latent potentialities it contains, and\nthen look at this small room.  Do you think I am what I am, because I\nhave changed all those minds, or because I best express their views?\nAm I their master or their slave?  Believe me, I have no illusions, nor\nneed you.\"\n\nHis manner impressed his follower.  It almost seemed to him, as he\nwatched the city and listened to Savrola's earnest words, that he heard\nthe roar of a multitude, distant, subdued, but intense as the thunder\nof the surf upon a rocky coast when the wind is off the sea.  He did\nnot reply.  His highly wrought temperament exaggerated every mood and\npassion; he always lived in the superlative.  He had no counterpoise of\nhealthy cynicism.  Now he was very solemn, and bidding Savrola\ngood-morning, walked slowly down the stairs, swayed by the vibrations\nof a powerful imagination which had been stimulated to an extreme.\n\nSavrola lay back in his chair.  His first inclination was to laugh, but\nhe realised that his mirth would not be entirely at Moret's expense.\nHe had tried to trick himself as well, but the parts of that subtle\nbrain were too intimately connected to have secrets from one another.\nStill he would not allow them to formulate the true reason of his\nchange of mind.  It was not so, he said to himself several times, and\neven if it were it was of no importance and signified nothing.  He took\na cigarette from his case, and lighting it, watched the coiling rings\nof smoke.\n\nHow much of what he had said had he believed?  He thought of Moret's\nserious face; that was not entirely produced by his influence.  The\nyoung revolutionist had noticed something too, but had feared, or\nfailed, to reduce his impressions to words.  There was an undercurrent\nthen; there were many dangers ahead.  Well, he did not care; he was\nconfident in his own powers.  As the difficulties arose, he would meet\nthem; when dangers threatened he would overcome them.  Horse, foot, and\nartillery, he was a man, a complete entity.  Under any circumstances,\nin any situation he knew himself a factor to be reckoned with; whatever\nthe game, he would play it to his amusement, if not to his advantage.\n\nThe smoke of his cigarette curled round his head.  Life,--how unreal,\nhow barren, and yet, how fascinating!  Fools, calling themselves\nphilosophers, had tried to bring home the bitter fact to men.  His\nphilosophy lent itself to a pious fraud--taught him to minimise the\nimportance of his pains, and to magnify that of his pleasures; made\nlife delightful and death incidental.  Zeno had shown him how to face\nadversity, and Epicurus how to enjoy pleasure.  He basked in the smiles\nof fortune, and shrugged his shoulders at the frowns of fate.  His\nexistence, or series of existences, had been agreeable.  All that he\nremembered had been worth living.  If there was a future state, if the\ngame was to begin again elsewhere, he would take a hand.  He hoped for\nimmortality, but he contemplated annihilation with composure.\nMeanwhile the business of living was an interesting problem.  His\nspeech,--he had made many and knew that nothing good can be obtained\nwithout effort.  These impromptu feats of oratory existed only in the\nminds of the listeners; the flowers of rhetoric were hothouse plants.\n\nWhat was there to say?  Successive cigarettes had been mechanically\nconsumed.  Amid the smoke he saw a peroration, which would cut deep\ninto the hearts of a crowd; a high thought, a fine simile, expressed in\nthat correct diction which is comprehensible even to the most\nilliterate, and appeals to the most simple; something to lift their\nminds from the material cares of life and to awake sentiment.  His\nideas began to take the form of words, to group themselves into\nsentences; he murmured to himself; the rhythm of his own language\nswayed him; instinctively he alliterated.  Ideas succeeded one another,\nas a stream flows swiftly by and the light changes on its waters.  He\nseized a piece of paper and began hurriedly to pencil notes.  That was\na point; could not tautology accentuate it?  He scribbled down a rough\nsentence, scratched it out, polished it, and wrote it in again.  The\nsound would please their ears, the sense improve and stimulate their\nminds.  What a game it was!  His brain contained the cards he had to\nplay, the world the stakes he played for.\n\nAs he worked, the hours passed away.  The housekeeper entering with his\nluncheon found him silent and busy; she had seen him thus before and\ndid not venture to interrupt him.  The untasted food grew cold upon the\ntable, as the hands of the clock moved slowly round marking the\nmeasured tread of time.  Presently he rose, and, completely under the\ninfluence of his own thoughts and language, began to pace the room with\nshort rapid strides, speaking to himself in a low voice and with great\nemphasis.  Suddenly he stopped, and with a strange violence his hand\ndescended on the table.  It was the end of the speech.\n\nThe noise recalled him to the commonplaces of life.  He was hungry and\ntired, and with a laugh at his own enthusiasm sat down at the table and\nbegan his neglected luncheon.\n\nA dozen sheets of note paper, covered with phrases, facts, and figures,\nwere the result of the morning's work.  They lay pinned together on the\ntable, harmless insignificant pieces of paper; and yet Antonio Molara,\nPresident of the Republic of Laurania, would have feared a bombshell\nless.  Nor would he have been either a fool or a coward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE STATE BALL.\n\nThe palace of Laurania was admirably suited to the discharge of the\nsocial ceremonies of the State.  The lavish expenditure on public\nentertainments, which the constitutional practice encouraged, allowed\nthe hospitalities of the Republic to be extended upon the most\nmagnificent scale.  The opening State Ball of the season was in many\nways the most important of these affairs.  It was at this function that\nthe great men of both parties met, for the first time after the summer\nheats, before the autumn session, and the brilliant society of the\ncapital reunited after their absence in their country and mountain\nvillas.  Taste, elegance, and magnificence were equally displayed.  The\nfinest music, the best champagne, the most diverse, yet select, company\nwere among the attractions of the evening.  The spacious courtyard of\nthe palace was completely covered by a gigantic awning.  Rows of the\nInfantry of the Guard lined the approaches, and with their bright steel\nbayonets increased the splendour and the security of the occasion.  The\nwell-lit streets were crowded with the curious populace.  The great\nhall of the palace, at all times imposing and magnificent, displayed a\ngreater pomp when filled with a gaily dressed company.\n\nAt the head of the stairs stood the President and his wife, he\nresplendent in his orders and medals, she in her matchless beauty.  As\nthe guests ascended, an aide-de-camp, a gorgeous thing in crimson and\ngold, inquired their names and styles and announced them.  Many and\nvarious was the company; every capital in Europe, every country in the\nworld, was represented.\n\nThe guest of the evening was the King of Ethiopia, a mass of silk and\njewels framing a black but vivacious face.  He came early,--unwisely\nas, had he come later, there would have been a better audience to watch\nhis arrival; however, to his untutored mind perhaps this was a matter\nof little importance.\n\nThe Diplomatic Corps followed in a long succession.  Coach after coach\ndrew up at the entrance and discharged its burden of polite astuteness,\nclothed in every conceivable combination of gold and colour.  Arrived\nat the top of the stairs, the Russian Ambassador, grey but gallant,\npaused and, bowing with a stately courtesy, kissed the hand Lucile\nextended.\n\n\"The scene is an appropriate setting to a peerless diamond,\" he\nmurmured.\n\n\"Would it sparkle as brightly in the Winter Palace?\" inquired Lucile\nlightly.\n\n\"Assuredly the frosty nights of Russia would intensify its brilliancy.\"\n\n\"Among so many others it would be lost.\"\n\n\"Among all others it would be unrivalled and alone.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" she said, \"I hate publicity, and as for solitude, frosty\nsolitude, the thought of it alone makes me shiver.\"\n\nShe laughed.  The diplomatist threw her a look of admiration, and\nstepping into the crowd, that already blocked the head of the stairs,\nreceived and returned the congratulations of his numerous friends.\n\n\"Madame Tranta,\" said the aide-de-camp.\n\n\"I am so glad to see you,\" said Lucile.  \"What a pity your daughter\ncould not come; it has been a great disappointment to many.\"\n\nThe ugly old woman thus addressed beamed with delight, and moving up\nthe stairs pushed her way to the marble balustrade of the balcony.  She\nwatched the later arrivals, and commented freely to her acquaintance on\ntheir dresses and deportments; she also gave a little information about\neach one, which would have been ill-natured even had it not been\nuntrue; but though she told her friends many things, she did not\nmention that she had had to make Tranta write and threaten to desert\nthe President's party unless she was asked to the ball, and that even\nthis had failed to procure an invitation for her daughter, an\nunfortunate girl who added a bad complexion to the family features.\n\nLouvet came next, looking anxiously at the crowd of faces which gazed\nfrom the landing, and imagining bombs and daggers at every step.  He\nregarded Lucile with apprehension, but her smile seemed to give him\ncourage and he mingled with the throng.\n\nThen Sir Richard Shalgrove, the British Ambassador, whose genial and\ncheery face displayed an innocence which contrasted with his\nreputation, advanced to make his bow.  The strained relations between\nLaurania and Great Britain seemed to disappear in that comprehensive\nsalutation.  Lucile engaged him for a moment in conversation; she\npretended to know little or nothing.  \"And when,\" she asked merrily,\n\"do we declare war?\"\n\n\"Not until after I have had the pleasure of the third waltz, I hope,\"\nsaid the Ambassador.\n\n\"How annoying!  I wanted so much to dance it with you.\"\n\n\"And you will not?\" he asked in great concern.\n\n\"Dare I plunge two nations into war for the sake of a waltz?\"\n\n\"Had you my inducement you would not hesitate,\" he replied gallantly.\n\n\"What, to precipitate hostilities!  What have we done?  What is your\ngreat inducement to fight?\"\n\n\"Not to fight,--to dance,\" said Sir Richard with a little less than his\nusual assurance.\n\n\"For a diplomatist you are indeed explicit.  While you are in so good a\nmood, tell me what has happened; is there danger?\"\n\n\"Danger?  No--how could there be?\"  He selected a formula: \"Between\ntraditionally friendly powers arbitration settles all disputes.\"\n\n\"You realise,\" she said earnestly and with an entire change of manner,\n\"that we have to consider the political situation here?  A strong\ndespatch improves the position of the Government.\"\n\n\"I have felt all through,\" said the Ambassador uncompromisingly, \"that\nthere was no danger.\"  He did not however mention that H.M. battleship\n_Aggressor_ (12,000 tons displacement and 14,000 horse power, armed\nwith four 11-inch guns) was steaming eighteen knots an hour towards the\nAfrican port of the Lauranian Republic, or that he himself had been\nbusy all the afternoon with cipher telegrams relating to ships, stores,\nand military movements.  He thought that would be only boring her with\npurely technical details.\n\nWhile this conversation had been taking place, the stream of people had\npassed continuously up the stairs, and the throng on the wide balcony\nthat ran round the entire hall had become dense.  The wonderful band\nwas almost drowned by the hum of conversation; the perfect floor of the\nball-room was only occupied by a few young couples whose own affairs\nabsorbed their minds and excluded all other interests.  A feeling of\nexpectancy pervaded the hall; the rumour that Savrola would come had\nspread far and wide throughout Laurania.\n\nSuddenly everyone became hushed, and above the strains of the band the\ndistant sound of shouting was heard.  Louder and louder it swelled,\nswiftly approaching until it was at the very gate; then it died away,\nand there was a silence through the hall filled only by the music.  Had\nhe been hooted or cheered?  The sound had seemed strangely ambiguous;\nmen were prepared to wager about it; his face would tell them the\nanswer.\n\nThe swing-doors opened and Savrola entered.  All eyes were turned on\nhim, but his face showed them nothing, and the bets remained undecided.\nAs he leisurely ascended the stairs, his eye travelled with interest\nround the crowded galleries and the brilliant throng who lined them.\nNo decorations, no orders, no star relieved the plain evening dress he\nwore.  Amid that blaze of colour, that multitude of gorgeous uniforms,\nhe appeared a sombre figure; but, like the Iron Duke in Paris, he\nlooked the leader of them all, calm, confident, and composed.\n\nThe President walked down a few steps to meet his distinguished guest.\nBoth bowed with grave dignity.\n\n\"I am glad you have come, Sir,\" said Molara; \"it is in harmony with the\ntraditions of the State.\"\n\n\"Duty and inclination combined to point the way,\" answered Savrola with\na smile marked by a suggestion of irony.\n\n\"You had no difficulty with the crowd?\" suggested the President acidly.\n\n\"Oh, no difficulty, but they take politics a little seriously; they\ndisapproved of my coming to your palace.\"\n\n\"You are right to come,\" said Molara.  \"Now we who are engaged in\nmatters of State know what these things are worth; men of the world do\nnot get excited over public affairs, nor do gentlemen fight with\nbludgeons.\"\n\n\"I prefer swords,\" said Savrola reflectively.  He had reached the head\nof the stairs and Lucile stood before him.  What a queen she looked,\nhow peerless and incomparable among all women!  The fine tiara she wore\nsuggested sovereignty, and democrat as he was, he bowed to that alone.\nShe held out her hand; he took it with reverence and courtesy, but the\ncontact thrilled him.\n\nThe President selected a fat but famous woman from the aristocracy of\nLaurania, and led the way into the ball-room.  Savrola did not dance;\nthere were some amusements which his philosophy taught him to despise.\nLucile was captured by the Russian Ambassador, and he remained a\nspectator.\n\nLieutenant Tiro saw him thus alone and approached him, wishing to\nfinish their discussion about the \"back\" of the polo team, which had\nbeen interrupted the week before.  Savrola received him with a smile;\nhe liked the young soldier, as indeed did everyone.  Tiro was full of\narguments; he was in favour of a strong heavy player who should lie\nback in the game and take no chances.  Savrola, having remarked on the\nimportance of the Lauranian Army being properly represented in an\ninternational contest, favoured a light weight, playing right up to his\nforwards and ready to take the ball on himself at any moment.  It was\nan animated discussion.\n\n\"Where have you played?\" asked the Subaltern, surprised at his\nknowledge.\n\n\"I have never played the game,\" answered Savrola; \"but I have always\nthought it a good training for military officers.\"\n\nThe subject was changed.\n\n\"Explain to me,\" said the great Democrat, \"what all these different\norders are.  What is that blue one that Sir Richard, the British\nAmbassador, is wearing?\"\n\n\"That is the Garter,\" replied the Subaltern; \"the most honourable order\nin England.\"\n\n\"Really, and what is this that you are wearing?\"\n\n\"I!  Oh, that's the African medal.  I was out there in '86 and '87, you\nknow.\"  As Savrola had anticipated, he was intensely pleased at being\nasked.\n\n\"It must have been a strange experience for you, who are so young.\"\n\n\"It was damned good fun,\" said the Subaltern with decision.  \"I was at\nLangi Tal.  My squadron had a five-mile pursuit.  The lance is a\nbeautiful weapon.  The English in India have a sport called\npig-sticking; I have never tried it, but I know a better.\"\n\n\"Well, you may have another chance soon.  We seem to be getting into\ndifficulties with the British Government.\"\n\n\"Do you think there is any chance of war?\" asked the boy eagerly.\n\n\"Well, of course,\" said Savrola, \"a war would distract the attention of\nthe people from internal agitation and the Reform movement.  The\nPresident is a clever man.  There might be war.  I should not care to\nprophesy; but do you wish for it?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do; it is my profession.  I am sick of being a lap-dog in\nthis palace; I long for the camp and the saddle again.  Besides, these\nEnglish will be worth fighting; they will give us a gallop all right.\nThere was one of their officers with me at Langi Tal, a subaltern; he\ncame as a spectator searching for adventure.\"\n\n\"What happened to him?\"\n\n\"Well, you know, we pursued the enemy all the way to the hills and\nplayed the devil with them.  As we were galloping along, he saw a lot\nmaking off towards a wood, and wanted to cut them off.  I said there\nwasn't time; he laid me six to four there was, so I sent a troop,--I\nwas in command of the squadron that day--you know.  He went with them\nand showed them the way straight enough,--but I bore you?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I am greatly interested; what then?\"\n\n\"He was wrong; the enemy got to the wood first and picked him off in\nthe open.  Our fellows brought him back, shot through the big artery of\nthe leg; that doesn't take long, you know.  All he said was: 'Well,\nyou've won, but how the deuce you'll get paid, I can't think.  Ask my\nbrother,--Royal Lancers.'\"\n\n\"And then?\" asked Savrola.\n\n\"Well, I couldn't find the artery to compress it, and none of the\ndoctors were about.  He died,--a gallant fellow!\"\n\nThe Subaltern paused, rather ashamed at having talked so much about his\nmilitary adventures.  Savrola felt as if he had looked into a new\nworld, a world of ardent, reckless, warlike youth.  He was himself\nyoung enough to feel a certain jealousy.  This boy had seen what he had\nnot; he possessed an experience which taught him lessons Savrola had\nnever learned.  Their lives had been different; but one day perhaps he\nwould open this strange book of war, and by the vivid light of personal\ndanger read the lessons it contained.\n\nMeanwhile the dances had succeeded each other and the night was\npassing.  The King of Ethiopia, horrified at the low dresses of the\nunveiled women and dreading the prospect of eating with odious white\npeople, had taken his departure.  The President, approaching Savrola,\ninvited him to take his wife down to supper; a procession was formed;\nhe offered Lucile his arm and they descended the stairs.  The supper\nwas excellent: the champagne was dry and the quails fat.  A profusion\nof rare and beautiful orchids covered the table; Savrola's surroundings\nwere agreeable, and he sat next the most beautiful woman in Laurania,\nwho, though he did not know it, was exerting herself to captivate him.\nAt first they talked amusing frivolities.  The President, whose manners\nwere refined, showed himself a pleasant companion and an accomplished\ntalker.  Savrola, who delighted in sparkling conversation, found it\ndifficult to keep to the part of a purely official visitor which he had\ndetermined to observe.  The influence of wit, wine, and beauty were\ncombined to break his reserve; before he knew it, he had joined in a\ndiscussion, one of those half cynical, half serious discussions which\nare characteristic of an age which inquires because it doubts, and\ndoubts the more because it has inquired.\n\nThe Russian Ambassador had said that he worshipped beauty, and had told\nhis partner, the youthful Countess of Ferrol, that he regarded taking\nher into dinner as a religious observance.\n\n\"I suppose that means you are bored,\" she replied.\n\n\"By no means; in my religion the ceremonies are never dull; that is one\nof the principal advantages I claim for it.\"\n\n\"There are few others,\" said Molara; \"you devote yourself to an idol of\nyour own creation.  If you worship beauty, your goddess stands on no\nsurer pedestal than human caprice.  Is it not so, Princess?\"\n\nThe Princess of Tarentum, who was on the President's right, replied\nthat even that foundation was more secure than that on which many\nbeliefs repose.\n\n\"You mean that in your own case human caprice has been sufficiently\nconstant?  I can well believe it.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said; \"I only mean that the love of beauty is common to all\nhuman beings.\"\n\n\"To all living things,\" corrected Savrola.  \"It is the love of the\nplant that produces the flower.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the President, \"but, though the love of beauty may be\nconstant, beauty itself may change.  Look how everything changes: the\nbeauty of one age is not the beauty of the next; what is admired in\nAfrica is hideous in Europe.  It is all a matter of opinion, local\nopinion.  Your goddess, Monsieur, has as many shapes as Proteus.\"\n\n\"I like change,\" said the Ambassador.  \"I regard variability of form as\na decided advantage in a goddess.  I do not care how many shapes I look\nat, so long as all are beautiful.\"\n\n\"But,\" interposed Lucile, \"you make no distinction between what is\nbeautiful and what we think is beautiful.\"\n\n\"There is none,\" said the President.\n\n\"In Her Excellency's case there would be none,\" interposed the\nAmbassador politely.\n\n\"What is beauty,\" said Molara, \"but what we choose to admire?\"\n\n\"Do we choose?  Have we the power?\" asked Savrola.\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered the President; \"and every year we alter our\ndecisions; every year the fashion changes.  Ask the ladies.  Look at\nthe fashions of thirty years ago; they were thought becoming then.\nObserve the different styles of painting that have succeeded each\nother, or of poetry, or of music.  Besides, Monsieur de Stranoff's\ngoddess, though beautiful to him, might not be so to another.\"\n\n\"I regard that also as a real advantage; you make me more enamoured\nwith my religion each moment.  I do not worship my ideals for the\n_reclam\u00c3\u00a9_,\" said the Ambassador with a smile.\n\n\"You look at the question from a material point of view.\"\n\n\"Material rather than moral,\" said Lady Ferrol.\n\n\"But in the spirit-worship of my goddess the immorality is immaterial.\nBesides, if you say that our tastes are always changing, it seems to me\nthat constancy is the essence of my religion.\"\n\n\"That is a paradox which we shall make you explain,\" said Molara.\n\n\"Well, you say I change each day, and my goddess changes too.  To-day I\nadmire one standard of beauty, to-morrow another, but when to-morrow\ncomes I am no longer the same person.  The molecular structure of my\nbrain is altered; my ideas have changed; my old self has perished,\nloving its own ideal; the renovated _ego_ starts life with a new one.\nIt is all a case of wedded till death.\"\n\n\"You are not going to declare that constancy is a series of changes?\nYou may as well assert that motion is a succession of halts.\"\n\n\"I am true to the fancy of the hour.\"\n\n\"You express my views in other words.  Beauty depends on human caprice,\nand changes with the times.\"\n\n\"Look at that statue,\" said Savrola suddenly, indicating a magnificent\nmarble figure of Diana which stood in the middle of the room surrounded\nby ferns.  \"More than two thousand years have passed since men called\nthat beautiful.  Do we deny it now?\"  There was no answer and he\ncontinued: \"That is true beauty of line and form, which is eternal.\nThe other things you have mentioned, fashions, styles, fancies, are but\nthe unsuccessful efforts we make to attain to it.  Men call such\nefforts art.  Art is to beauty what honour is to honesty, an unnatural\nallotropic form.  Art and honour belong to gentlemen; beauty and\nhonesty are good enough for men.\"\n\nThere was a pause.  It was impossible to mistake the democratic tone;\nhis earnestness impressed them.  Molara looked uneasy.  The Ambassador\ncame to the rescue.\n\n\"Well, I shall continue to worship the goddess of beauty, whether she\nbe constant or variable\"--he looked at the Countess; \"and to show my\ndevotion I shall offer up a waltz in that sacred fane, the ball-room.\"\n\nHe pushed his chair back, and, stooping, picked up his partner's glove,\nwhich had fallen to the floor.  Everyone rose, and the party separated.\nAs Savrola walked back to the hall with Lucile, they passed an open\ndoorway leading to the garden.  A multitude of fairy lights marked out\nthe flower-beds or hung in festoons from the trees.  The paths were\ncarpeted with red cloth; a cool breeze fanned their faces.  Lucile\npaused.\n\n\"It is a lovely night.\"\n\nThe invitation was plain.  She had wanted to speak to him, then, after\nall.  How right he was to come,--on constitutional grounds.\n\n\"Shall we go out?\" he said.\n\nShe consented, and they stepped on to the terrace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n\"IN THE STARLIGHT.\"\n\nThe night was very still.  The soft breeze was not strong enough to\nstir even the slender palms which rose on all sides, and whose\noutlines, above the surrounding foliage, framed the starlit sky.  The\npalace stood on high ground, and the garden sloped on the western side\ntowards the sea.  At the end of the terrace was a stone seat.\n\n\"Let us sit here,\" said Lucile.\n\nThey sat down.  The dreamy music of a waltz floated down as a distant\naccompaniment to their thoughts.  The windows of the palace blazed with\nlight and suggested glitter, glare, and heat; in the garden all was\nquiet and cool.\n\n\"Why do you sneer at honour?\" asked Lucile, thinking of the interrupted\nconversation.\n\n\"Because it has no true foundation, no ultra-human sanction.  Its codes\nare constantly changing with times and places.  At one time it is\nthought more honourable to kill the man you have wronged than to make\namends; at another it is more important to pay a bookmaker than a\nbutcher.  Like art it changes with human caprice, and like art it comes\nfrom opulence and luxury.\"\n\n\"But why do you claim a higher origin for beauty and honesty?\"\n\n\"Because, wherever I have looked, I see that all things are perpetually\nreferred to an eternal standard of fitness, and that right triumphs\nover wrong, truth over falsehood, beauty over ugliness.  _Fitness_ is\nthe general expression!  Judged by this standard art and honour have\nlittle value.\"\n\n\"But are these things so?\" she asked wonderingly.  \"Surely there are\nmany exceptions?\"\n\n\"Nature never considers the individual; she only looks at the average\nfitness of the species.  Consider the statistics of mortality.  How\nexact they are: they give to a month the expectation of life to men;\nand yet they tell a man nothing.  We cannot say that a good man will\nalways overcome a knave; but the evolutionist will not hesitate to\naffirm that the nation with the highest ideals would succeed.\"\n\n\"Unless,\" said Lucile, \"some other nation with lower ideals, but\nstronger arms, intervenes.\"\n\n\"Well, even then might is a form of fitness; I think a low form, but\nstill physical force contains the elements of human progress.  This is\nonly the instance; we must enlarge our view.  Nature does not consider\nthe individual species.  All we will now assert is that organisms\nimbued with moral fitness would ultimately rise above those whose\nvirtue is physical.  How many times has civilisation, by which I mean a\nstate of society where moral force begins to escape from the tyranny of\nphysical forces, climbed the ladder of Progress and been dragged down?\nPerhaps many hundred times in this world alone.  But the motive power,\nthe upward tendency, was constant.  Evolution does not say 'always,'\nbut 'ultimately.'  Well, ultimately civilisation has climbed up beyond\nthe reach of barbarism.  The higher ideals have reached the surface by\nsuperior buoyancy.\"\n\n\"Why do you assume that this triumph is permanent?  How do you know\nthat it will not be reversed, as all others have been?\"\n\n\"Because we have got might on our side, as well as moral ascendancy.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the Romans in the summit of their power thought that too?\"\n\n\"Very likely, but without reason.  They had only their swords to fall\nback upon as an ultimate appeal; and when they became effete they could\nno longer wield them.\"\n\n\"And modern civilisation?\"\n\n\"Ah, we have other weapons.  When we have degenerated, as we must\neventually degenerate, when we have lost our intrinsic superiority, and\nother races, according to the natural law, advance to take our place,\nwe shall fall back upon these weapons.  Our morals will be gone, but\nour Maxims will remain.  The effete and trembling European will sweep\nfrom the earth by scientific machinery the valiant savages who assail\nhim.\"\n\n\"Is that the triumph of moral superiority?\"\n\n\"At first it would be, for the virtues of civilisation are of a higher\ntype than those of barbarism.  Kindness is better than courage, and\ncharity more than strength.  But ultimately the dominant race will\ndegenerate, and as there will be none to take its place, the\ndegeneration must continue.  It is the old struggle between vitality\nand decay, between energy and indolence; a struggle that always ends in\nsilence.  After all, we could not expect human developement to be\nconstant.  It is only a question of time before the planet becomes\nunfitted to support life on its surface.\"\n\n\"But you said that fitness must ultimately triumph.\"\n\n\"Over relative unfitness, yes.  But decay will involve all, victors and\nvanquished.  The fire of life will die out, the spirit of vitality\nbecome extinct.\"\n\n\"In this world perhaps.\"\n\n\"In every world.  All the universe is cooling--dying, that is,--and as\nit cools, life for a spell becomes possible on the surface of its\nspheres, and plays strange antics.  And then the end comes; the\nuniverse dies and is sepulchred in the cold darkness of ultimate\nnegation.\"\n\n\"To what purpose then are all our efforts?\"\n\n\"God knows,\" said Savrola cynically; \"but I can imagine that the drama\nwould not be an uninteresting one to watch.\"\n\n\"And yet you believe in an ultra-human foundation, an eternal ideal for\nsuch things as beauty and virtue.\"\n\n\"I believe that the superiority of fitness over relative unfitness is\none of the great laws of matter.  I include all kinds of\nfitness,--moral, physical, mathematical.\"\n\n\"Mathematical!\"\n\n\"Certainly; words only exist by conforming to correct mathematical\nprinciples.  That is one of the great proofs we have that mathematics\nhave been discovered, not invented.  The planets observe a regular\nprogression in their distances from the sun.  Evolution suggests that\nthose that did not observe such principles were destroyed by collisions\nand amalgamated with others.  It is a universal survival of the\nfittest.\"  She was silent.  He continued: \"Now let us say that in the\nbeginning there existed two factors, matter animated by the will to\nlive, and the eternal ideal; the great author and the great critic.  It\nis to the interplay and counter-action of these two that all\ndevelopement, that all forms of life are due.  The more the expression\nof the will to live approximates to the eternal standard of fitness,\nthe better it succeeds.\"\n\n\"I would add a third,\" she said; \"a great Being to instil into all\nforms of life the desire to attain to the ideal; to teach them in what\nways they may succeed.\"\n\n\"It is pleasant,\" he replied, \"to think that such a Being exists to\napprove our victories, to cheer our struggles, and to light our way;\nbut it is not scientifically or logically necessary to assume one after\nthe two factors I have spoken of are once at work.\"\n\n\"Surely the knowledge that such an ultra-human ideal existed must have\nbeen given from without.\"\n\n\"No; that instinct which we call conscience was derived as all other\nknowledge from experience.\"\n\n\"How could it be?\"\n\n\"I think of it in this way.  When the human race was emerging from the\ndarkness of its origin and half animal, half human creatures trod the\nearth, there was no idea of justice, honesty, or virtue, only the\nmotive power which we may call the 'will to live.'  Then perhaps it was\na minor peculiarity of some of these early ancestors of man to combine\nin twos and threes for their mutual protection.  The first alliance was\nmade; the combinations prospered where the isolated individuals failed.\nThe faculty of combination appeared to be an element of fitness.  By\nnatural selection only the combinations survived.  Thus man became a\nsocial animal.  Gradually the little societies became larger ones.\nFrom families to tribes, and from tribes to nations the species\nadvanced, always finding that the better they combined, the better they\nsucceeded.  Now on what did this system of alliance depend?  It\ndepended on the members keeping faith with each other, on the practice\nof honesty, justice, and the rest of the virtues.  Only those beings in\nwhom such faculties were present were able to combine, and thus only\nthe relatively honest men were preserved.  The process repeated itself\ncountless times during untold ages.  At every step the race advanced,\nand at every step the realisation of the cause increased.  Honesty and\njustice are bound up in our compositions and form an inseparable part\nof our natures.  It is only with difficulty that we repress such\nawkward inclinations.\"\n\n\"You do not then believe in God?\"\n\n\"I never said that,\" said Savrola.  \"I am only discussing the question\nof our existence from one standpoint, that of reason.  There are many\nwho think that reason and faith, science and religion, must be\neverlastingly separated, and that if one be admitted the other must be\ndenied.  Perhaps it is because we see so short a span, that we think\nthat their lines are parallel and never touch each other.  I always\ncherish the hope that somewhere in the perspective of the future there\nmay be a vanishing point where all lines of human aspiration will\nultimately meet.\"\n\n\"And you believe all this that you have said?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered, \"there is no faith in disbelief, whatever the poets\nhave said.  Before we can solve the problems of existence we must\nestablish the fact that we exist at all.  It is a strange riddle, is it\nnot?\"\n\n\"We shall learn the answer when we die.\"\n\n\"If I thought that,\" said Savrola, \"I should kill myself to-night out\nof irresistible curiosity.\"\n\nHe paused, and looked up at the stars, which shone so brightly\noverhead.  She followed his gaze.  \"You like the stars?\" she asked.\n\n\"I love them,\" he replied; \"they are very beautiful.\"\n\n\"Perhaps your fate is written there.\"\n\n\"I have always admired the audacity of man in thinking that a Supreme\nPower should placard the skies with the details of his squalid future,\nand that his marriage, his misfortunes, and his crimes should be\nwritten in letters of suns on the background of limitless space.  We\nare consequential atoms.\"\n\n\"You think we are of no importance?\"\n\n\"Life is very cheap.  Nature has no exaggerated idea of its value.  I\nrealise my own insignificance, but I am a philosophic microbe, and it\nrather adds to my amusement than otherwise.  Insignificant or not, I\nlike living, it is good to think of the future.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Lucile impetuously, \"whither are you hurrying us in the\nfuture,--to revolution?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Savrola calmly.\n\n\"You are prepared to plunge the country in a civil war?\"\n\n\"Well, I hope it will not come to that extreme.  Probably there will be\nsome street-fighting and some people will be killed, but----\"\n\n\"But why should you drive them like this?\"\n\n\"I discharge a duty to the human species in breaking down a military\ndespotism.  I do not like to see a Government supported only by\nbayonets; it is an anachronism.\"\n\n\"The Government is just and firm; it maintains law and order.  Why\nshould you assail it merely because it does not harmonise with your\ntheories?\"\n\n\"My theories!\" said Savrola.  \"Is that the name you give to the lines\nof soldiers with loaded rifles that guard this palace, or to the\nLancers I saw spearing the people in the square a week ago?\"\n\nHis voice had grown strangely vehement and his manner thrilled her.\n\"You will ruin us,\" she said weakly.\n\n\"No,\" he replied with his grand air, \"you can never be ruined.  Your\nbrilliancy and beauty will always make you the luckiest of women, and\nyour husband the luckiest of men.\"\n\nHis great soul was above the suspicion of presumption.  She looked up\nat him, smiled quickly, and impulsively held out her hand.  \"We are on\nopposite sides, but we will fight under the rules of war.  I hope we\nshall remain friends even though----\"\n\n\"We are officially enemies,\" said Savrola, completing the sentence, and\ntaking her hand in his he bowed and kissed it.  After that they were\nboth very silent, and walking along the terrace re-entered the palace.\nMost of the guests had already gone, and Savrola did not ascend the\nstairs, but passing through the swing-doors took his departure.  Lucile\nwalked up to the ball-room in which a few youthful and indefatigable\ncouples were still circling.  Molara met her.  \"My dear,\" he said,\n\"where have you been all this time?\"\n\n\"In the garden,\" she replied.\n\n\"With Savrola?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe President repressed a feeling of satisfaction.  \"Did he tell you\nanything?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she answered, remembering for the first time the object with\nwhich she had sought the interview; \"I must see him again.\"\n\n\"You will continue to try and find out his political intentions?\"\ninquired Molara anxiously.\n\n\"I shall see him again,\" she replied.\n\n\"I trust to your wit,\" said the President; \"you can do it, if anyone\ncan, my dearest.\"\n\nThe last dance came to an end and the last guest departed.  Very weary\nand thoughtful Lucile retired to her room.  Her conversation with\nSavrola filled her mind; his earnestness, his enthusiasm, his hopes,\nhis beliefs, or, rather, his disbeliefs, all passed again in review\nbefore her.  What a great man he was!  Was it wonderful the people\nfollowed him?  She would like to hear him speak to-morrow.\n\nHer maid came in to assist her to undress.  She had looked from an\nupper balcony and had seen Savrola.  \"Was that,\" she asked her mistress\ncuriously, \"the great Agitator?\"  Her brother was going to hear him\nmake his speech to-morrow.\n\n\"Is he going to make a speech to-morrow?\" asked Lucile.\n\n\"So my brother says,\" said the maid; \"he says that he is going to give\nthem such a dressing down they will never forget it.\"  The maid paid\ngreat attention to her brother's words.  There was much sympathy\nbetween them; in fact she only called him her brother because it\nsounded better.\n\nLucile took up the evening paper which lay on the bed.  There on the\nfirst page was the announcement, the great meeting would take place at\nthe City-Hall at eight the next evening.  She dismissed the maid and\nwalked to the window.  The silent city lay before her; to-morrow the\nman she had talked with would convulse that city with excitement.  She\nwould go and hear him; women went to these meetings; why should she not\ngo, closely veiled?  After all it would enable her to learn something\nof his character and she could thus better assist her husband.  With\nthis reflection, which was extremely comforting, she went to bed.\n\nThe President was going up-stairs, when Miguel met him.  \"More\nbusiness?\" he asked wearily.\n\n\"No,\" said the Secretary; \"things are going on very well.\"\n\nMolara looked at him with quick annoyance; but Miguel's face remained\nimpassive, so he simply replied, \"I am glad of that,\" and passed on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE ADMIRAL.\n\nThe disapproval which Moret had expressed at Savrola's determination to\ngo to the State Ball was amply justified by the result.  Every paper,\nexcept those actually controlled by the party organisation, commented\nseverely or contemptuously on his action.  THE HOUR alluded to the\ngroans with which the crowd had received him, as marking the decline of\nhis influence with the masses and the break-up of the Revolutionary\nparty.  It also reminded its readers that social distinction was always\nthe highest ambition of the Demagogue, and declared that, by accepting\nthe President's invitation, Savrola had revealed \"his sordid personal\naims.\"  The other Government organs expressed a similar opinion in an\neven more offensive manner.  \"These agitators,\" said THE COURTIER,\n\"have at all times in the history of the world hankered after titles\nand honours, and the prospect of mixing with persons of rank and\nfashion has once again proved irresistible to an austere and unbending\nson of the people.\"  This superior vulgarity, though more unpleasant,\nwas less dangerous than the grave and serious warnings and protests\nwhich the Democratic journals contained.  THE RISING TIDE said plainly\nthat, if this sort of thing continued, the Popular party would have to\nfind another leader, \"One who did not cringe to power nor seek to\ningratiate himself with fashion.\"\n\nSavrola read these criticisms with disdain.  He had recognised the fact\nthat such things would be said, and had deliberately exposed himself to\nthem.  He knew he had been unwise to go: he had known that from the\nfirst; and yet somehow he did not regret his mistake.  After all, why\nshould his party dictate to him how he should rule his private life?\nHe would never resign his right to go where he pleased.  In this case\nhe had followed his own inclination, and the odium which had been cast\nupon him was the price he was prepared to pay.  When he thought of his\nconversation in the garden, he did not feel that he had made a bad\nbargain.  The damage however must be repaired.  He looked over the\nnotes of his speech again, polished his sentences, considered his\npoints, collected his arguments, and made some additions which he\nthought appropriate to the altered state of public feeling.\n\nIn this occupation the morning passed.  Moret came in to luncheon.  He\nrefrained from actually saying \"I told you so,\" but his looks showed\nthat he felt his judgment was for the future established on unshakable\nfoundations.  His was a character easily elated or depressed.  Now he\nwas gloomy and despondent, regarding the cause as already lost.  Only a\nforlorn hope remained; Savrola might express his regret at the meeting,\nand appeal to the people to remember his former services.  He suggested\nthis to his leader, who laughed merrily at the idea.  \"My dear Louis,\"\nhe said, \"I shall do nothing of the sort.  I will never resign my own\nindependence; I shall always go where I like and do what I like, and if\nthey are not pleased, they can find someone else to discharge their\npublic business.\"  Moret shuddered.  Savrola continued: \"I shall not\nactually tell them so, but my manner will show them that I fear their\nreproaches as little as Molara's enmity.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they will not listen; I hear reports that there will be some\nhostility.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall make them listen.  There may be some howling at first, but\nthey will change their note before I have gone very far.\"\n\nHis confidence was contagious.  Moret's spirits revived under its\ninfluence and that of a bottle of excellent claret.  Like Napoleon the\nThird, he felt that all might yet be regained.\n\nMeanwhile the President was extremely well satisfied with the first\nresult of his schemes.  He had not foreseen that Savrola's acceptance\nof the invitation to the ball would involve him in so much\nunpopularity, and, although it was a poor compliment to himself, it was\nan unexpected advantage.  Besides, as Miguel had remarked, everything\nwas going on very well in other directions.  He had hardened his heart\nand dismissed his scruples; stern, bitter necessity had thrust him on\nan unpleasant course, but now that he had started he was determined to\ngo on.  In the meantime affairs pressed on all sides.  The British\nGovernment were displaying an attitude of resolution on the African\nQuestion.  His violent despatch had not settled the matter, as he had\nhoped and even anticipated; it had become necessary to supplement his\nwords by actions.  The African port must not be left undefended; the\nfleet must go there at once.  It was not a moment when he could well\nafford to be without the five ships of war whose presence in the\nharbour overawed many of the discontented; but he felt that a vigorous\nforeign policy would be popular, or at least sufficiently interesting\nto keep the public mind from domestic agitation.  He also knew that a\ndisaster abroad would precipitate a revolution at home.  It was\nnecessary to be very careful.  He recognised the power and resources of\nGreat Britain; he had no illusions on the subject of the comparative\nweakness of Laurania.  In that indeed lay their only strength.  The\nBritish Government would do all in their power to avoid fighting\n(bullying, polite Europe would call it) so small a State.  It was a\ngame of bluff; the further he could go, the better for the situation at\nhome, but one step too far meant ruin.  It was a delicate game to play,\nand it taxed to the utmost the energies and talents of a strong, able\nman.\n\n\"The Admiral is here, Your Excellency,\" said Miguel entering the room,\nfollowed immediately by a short, red-faced man in naval uniform.\n\n\"Good-morning, my dear de Mello,\" cried the President, rising and\nshaking the newcomer's hand with great cordiality.  \"I have got some\nsailing-orders for you at last.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said de Mello bluntly, \"I am sick of lying up waiting for your\nagitators to rise.\"\n\n\"There is work of a difficult and exciting nature before you.  Where's\nthat translation of the cipher telegram, Miguel?  Ah, thank you,--look\nhere, Admiral.\"\n\nThe sailor read the paper, and whistled significantly.  \"It may go\nfurther than you wish, Molara, this time,\" he said unceremoniously.\n\n\"I shall place the matter in your hands; you will be able to save this\nsituation, as you have saved so many others.\"\n\n\"Where did this come from?\" asked de Mello.\n\n\"From French sources.\"\n\n\"She is a powerful ship, the _Aggressor_,--latest design, newest guns,\nin fact all the modern improvements; I have nothing that she could not\nsink in ten minutes; besides, there are some gunboats there as well.\"\n\n\"I know the situation is difficult,\" said the President; \"that is why I\nam entrusting it to you!  Now listen; whatever happens I don't want\nfighting; that would only end in disaster; and you know what disaster\nwould mean here.  You must argue and parley and protest on every point,\nand cause as much delay as possible.  Consult me by telegraph on every\noccasion, and try to make friends with the English admiral; that is\nhalf the battle.  If it ever comes to a question of bombardment, we\nshall give in and protest again.  I will have your instructions\nforwarded to you in writing this evening.  You had better steam\nto-night.  You understand the game?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said de Mello, \"I have played it before.\"  He shook hands and\nwalked to the door.\n\nThe President accompanied him.  \"It is possible,\" he said earnestly,\n\"that I shall want you back here before you have gone very far; there\nare many signs of trouble in the city, and after all Strelitz is still\non the frontier waiting for a chance.  If I send for you, you will\ncome?\"  There was almost an appealing note in his tone.\n\n\"Come?\" said the Admiral.  \"Of course I will come,--full steam ahead.\nI have had my big gun trained on the Parliament House for the last\nmonth, and I mean to let it off one day.  Oh, you can trust the fleet.\"\n\n\"Thank God I never doubted that,\" said the President with some emotion,\nand shaking de Mello's hand warmly, he returned to his writing-table.\nHe felt that the Admiral was thoroughly loyal to the Government.\n\nThese men who live their lives in great machines, become involved in\nthe mechanism themselves.  De Mello had lived on warships all his days,\nand neither knew nor cared for anything else.  Landsmen and civilians\nhe despised with a supreme professional contempt.  Such parts of the\nworld as bordered on the sea, he regarded as possible targets of\ndifferent types; for the rest he cared nothing.  With equal interest he\nwould burst his shells on patriots struggling to be free or foreign\nenemies, on a hostile fort or on his native town.  As long as the\nauthority to fire reached him through the proper channel, he was\ncontent; after that he regarded the question from a purely technical\nstandpoint.\n\nThe afternoon was far advanced before the President finished the varied\nlabours of his office.  \"There is a great meeting to-night, is there\nnot?\" he asked Miguel.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Secretary, \"in the City-Hall; Savrola is going to\nspeak.\"\n\n\"Have you arranged about an opposition?\"\n\n\"Some of the secret police are going to make a little, I believe;\nColonel Sorrento has arranged that.  But I fancy Se\u00c3\u00b1or Savrola's party\nare rather displeased with him, as it is.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Molara, \"I know his powers; he will tear their very hearts\nout with his words.  He is a terrible force; we must take every\nprecaution.  I suppose the troops have been ordered to be under arms?\nThere is nothing he cannot do with a crowd,--curse him!\"\n\n\"The Colonel was here this morning; he told me he was making\narrangements.\"\n\n\"It is good,\" said the President; \"he knows his own safety is involved.\nWhere do I dine to-night?\"\n\n\"With Se\u00c3\u00b1or Louvet, at the Home Office, an official dinner.\"\n\n\"How detestable!  Still he has a plain cook and he will be worth\nwatching to-night.  He gets in such a state of terror when Savrola\nholds forth that he is ridiculous.  I hate cowards, but they make the\nworld the merrier.\"\n\nHe bade the Secretary good-night and left the room.  Outside he met\nLucile.  \"Dearest,\" he said, \"I am dining out to-night, an official\ndinner at Louvet's.  It is a nuisance, but I must go.  Perhaps I shall\nnot be back till late.  I am sorry to leave you like this, but in these\nbusy days I can hardly call my soul my own.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Antonio,\" she replied; \"I know how you are pressed with\nwork.  What has happened about the English affair?\"\n\n\"I don't like the situation at all,\" said Molara.  \"They have a Jingo\nGovernment in power and have sent ships as an answer to our note.  It\nis most unfortunate.  Now I have to send the fleet away,--at such a\nmoment.\"  He groaned moodily.\n\n\"I told Sir Richard that we had to think of the situation here, and\nthat the despatch was meant for domestic purposes,\" said Lucile.\n\n\"I think,\" said the President, \"that the English Government also have\nto keep the electorate amused.  It is a Conservative ministry; they\nmust keep things going abroad to divert the public mind from advanced\nlegislation.  What, more still, Miguel?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir; this bag has just arrived, with several important despatches\nwhich require your immediate attention.\"\n\nThe President looked for a moment as if he would like to tell Miguel to\ntake himself and his despatches to the infernal regions; but he\nrepressed the inclination.  \"Good, I will come.  I shall see you at\nbreakfast to-morrow, my dear, till then, farewell,\" and giving her a\nweary smile he walked off.\n\nThus it is that great men enjoy the power they risk their lives to gain\nand often meet their deaths to hold.\n\nLucile was left alone, not for the first time when she had wanted\ncompanionship and sympathy.  She was conscious of an unsatisfactory\nsensation with regard to existence generally.  It was one of those\nmoments when the prizes and penalties of life seem equally stale and\nfutile.  She sought refuge in excitement.  The project she had\nconceived the night before began to take actual shape in her mind; yes,\nshe would hear him speak.  Going to her room she rang the bell.  The\nmaid came quickly.  \"What time is the meeting to-night?\"\n\n\"At eight, Your Excellency,\" said the girl.\n\n\"You have a ticket for it?\"\n\n\"Yes, my brother----\"\n\n\"Well, give it to me; I want to hear this man speak.  He will attack\nthe Government; I must be there to report to the President.\"\n\nThe maid looked astonished, but gave up the ticket meekly.  For six\nyears she had been Lucile's maid, and was devoted to her young and\nbeautiful mistress.  \"What will Your Excellency wear?\" was her only\nremark.\n\n\"Something dark, with a thick veil,\" said Lucile.  \"Don't speak of this\nto anyone.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Your Ex----\"\n\n\"Not even to your brother.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Your Excellency.\"\n\n\"Say I have a headache and have gone to bed.  You must go to your room\nyourself.\"\n\nThe maid hurried off to get the dress and bonnet.  Lucile felt full of\nthe nervous excitement her resolve had raised.  It was an adventure, it\nwould be an experience, more than that, she would see him.  The\ncrowd,--when she thought of them she felt a little frightened, but then\nshe remembered that women frequently went to these demonstrations, and\nthere would be plenty of police to keep order.  She dressed herself\nhastily in the clothes that the maid brought, and descending the\nstairs, entered the garden.  It was already dusk, but Lucile had no\ndifficulty in finding her way to a small private gate in the wall,\nwhich her key unlocked.\n\nShe stepped into the street.  All was very quiet.  The gas lamps flared\nin a long double row till they almost met in the distant perspective.\nA few people were hurrying in the direction of the City-Hall.  She\nfollowed them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nTHE WAND OF THE MAGICIAN.\n\nThe City-Hall was a gigantic meeting-house in which for many years all\nthe public discussions of the Lauranian people had taken place.  Its\nstone fa\u00c3\u00a7ade was showy and pretentious, but the building itself\nconsisted merely of the great hall and of a few smaller rooms and\noffices.  The hall was capable of holding nearly seven thousand people;\nwith its white-washed roof sustained by iron girders, and well lit with\ngas, it served its purpose well without any affectation of display.\n\nLucile was caught in the stream of those who were entering and carried\ninside.  She had expected to find a seat, but, in view of a great\ncrowd, all the chairs had been removed from the body of the hall, and\nonly standing room remained.  In this solid mass of humanity she found\nherself an atom.  To move was difficult; to go back almost impossible.\n\nIt was a striking scene.  The hall, which was hung with flags, was\ncrowded to overflowing; a long gallery, which ran round three sides,\nwas densely packed to the very ceiling; the flaring gas-jets threw\ntheir yellow light on thousands of faces.  The large majority of the\naudience were men, but Lucile noticed with relief that there were\nseveral women present.  A platform at the far end of the hall displayed\nthe customary table and the inevitable glass of water.  In front of the\nplatform were two long rows of reporters, getting their pads and\npencils ready,--a kind of orchestra.  Behind and above were again rows\nand rows of chairs filled by the numerous delegates, officials, and\nsecretaries of the various political clubs and organisations, each\ndistinguished by the badge and sash of his society.  Moret had exerted\nhimself to whip up the utmost power of the Party, and had certainly\nsucceeded in organising the greatest demonstration Laurania had ever\nseen.  All the political forces arrayed against the Government were\nrepresented.\n\nThere was a loud hum of conversation, broken at intervals by cheers and\nthe choruses of patriotic songs.  Suddenly the clock in the tower of\nthe building chimed the hour.  At the same instant, from a doorway on\nthe right of the platform, Savrola entered, followed by Godoy, Moret,\nRenos, and several other prominent leaders of the movement.  He made\nhis way along the row of chairs, until he reached that on the right of\nthe table, sat down and looked quietly about him.  There was a storm of\ndiscordant shouting, no two men seeming to hold the same opinion.  At\none moment it sounded as if all were cheering; at another hoots and\ngroans obtained the supremacy.  The meeting in fact was about equally\ndivided.  The extreme sections of the Reform' Party, regarding\nSavrola's attendance at the ball as an action of the grossest\ntreachery, howled with fury at him; the more moderate cheered him as\nthe safest man to cling to in times of civil disturbance.  The\ndelegates and regular officials, who occupied the chairs on the\nplatform, were silent and sullen, like men who await an explanation\nwithout belief in its sufficiency.\n\nAt length the shouting ceased.  Godoy, who was in the chair, rose and\nmade a short speech, in which he studiously avoided any contentious\nallusion to Savrola, confining himself only to the progress of the\nmovement.  He spoke well and clearly, but nobody wanted to hear him,\nand all were relieved when he concluded by calling upon \"our leader,\"\nSavrola, to address the meeting.  Savrola, who had been talking\nunconcernedly with one of the delegates on his right, turned round\nquickly towards the audience, and rose.  As he did so, a man in a blue\nsuit, one of a little group similarly clad, shouted out, \"Traitor and\ntoady!\"  Hundreds of voices took up the cry; there was an outburst of\nhooting and groaning; others cheered half-heartedly.  It was an\nunpromising reception.  Moret looked around him in blank despair.\n\nIn spite of the heat and the pressure, Lucile could not take her eyes\noff Savrola.  She could see that he was quivering with suppressed\nexcitement.  His composure had merely been assumed; crowds stirred his\nblood, and when he rose he could wear his mask no longer.  He looked\nalmost terrible, as he waited there, facing the outburst with defiance\nwritten in every line of his pale, earnest face and resolute figure.\nThen he began to speak, but his words could not at first be\ndistinguished through the persistent shouts of the man in blue and his\nfriends.  At length, after five minutes of intense disorder, the\ncuriosity of the audience triumphed over all other emotions, and they\ngenerally sank into silence, to hear what their leader had to say.\n\nAgain Savrola began.  Though he spoke very quietly and slowly, his\nwords reached the furthest ends of the hall.  He showed, or perhaps he\nfeigned, some nervousness at first, and here and there in his sentences\nhe paused as if searching for a word.  He was surprised, he said, at\nhis reception.  He had not expected, now when the final result was so\nnearly attained, that the people of Laurania would change their minds.\nThe man in blue began to howl his odious cry.  There was another\noutbreak of hooting; but the majority of the audience were now anxious\nto listen, and silence was soon restored.  Savrola continued.  He\nbriefly reviewed the events of the last year: the struggle they had had\nto form a party at all; the fierce opposition they had encountered and\nsustained; the success that had attended their threat of taking arms;\nthe President's promise of a free Parliament; the trick that had been\nplayed on them; the firing of the soldiery on the crowd.  His earnest,\nthoughtful words evoked a hum of approval.  These were events in which\nthe audience had participated, and they liked having them recalled to\ntheir memories.\n\nThen he went on to speak of the Deputation and of the contempt with\nwhich the President had thought fit to treat the accredited\nrepresentatives of the citizens.  \"Traitor and toady!\" shouted the man\nin blue loudly; but there was no response.  \"And,\" said Savrola, \"I\nwill invite your attention to this further matter.  It has not been\nsufficient to strangle the Press, to shoot down the people, and to\nsubvert the Constitution, but even when we are assembled here in\naccordance with our unquestioned right to discuss matters of State and\ndecide upon our public policies, our deliberations are to be\ninterrupted by the paid agents of the Government,\"--he looked towards\nthe man in blue, and there was an angry hum--\"who insult by their\nabusive cries not only myself, a free Lauranian, but you also, the\nassembled citizens who have invited me to place my views before you.\"\nHere the audience broke out into indignant applause and agreement;\ncries of \"Shame!\" were heard, and fierce looks turned in the direction\nof the interrupters, who had, however, dispersed themselves\nunobtrusively among the crowd.  \"In spite of such tactics,\" Savrola\ncontinued, \"and in the face of all opposition, whether by bribes or\nbullets, whether by hired bravos or a merciless and mercenary soldiery,\nthe great cause we are here to support has gone on, is going on, and is\ngoing to go on, until at length our ancient liberties are regained, and\nthose who have robbed us of them punished.\"  Loud cheers rose from all\nparts of the hall.  His voice was even and not loud, but his words\nconveyed an impression of dauntless resolution.\n\nAnd then, having got his audience in hand, he turned his powers of\nridicule upon the President and his colleagues.  Every point he made\nwas received with cheers and laughter.  He spoke of Louvet, of his\ncourage, and of his trust in the people.  Perhaps, he said, it was not\ninappropriate that the Ministry of the Interior should be filled by \"a\nglutton,\" the Home Office by a \"stay-at-home\" who was afraid to go out\namong his countrymen at night.  Louvet was indeed a good object for\nabuse; he was hated by the people, who despised his cowardice and had\nalways jeered at him.  Savrola continued.  He described the President\nas clinging to office at whatever cost to himself or others.  In order\nto draw the attention of the people from his tyrannical actions and\ndespotic government at home, he had tried to involve them in\ncomplications abroad, and he had succeeded, more completely than he had\nbargained for.  They were embroiled now in a dispute with a great\nPower, a dispute from which they had nothing to gain and everything to\nlose.  Their fleets and armies must be despatched, to the cost of the\nState; their possessions were endangered; perhaps the lives of their\nsoldiers and sailors would be sacrificed.  And all for what?  In order\nthat Antonio Molara might do as he had declared he would, and die at\nthe head of the State.  It was a bad joke.  But he should be warned;\nmany a true word was spoken in jest.  Again there was a fierce hum.\n\nLucile listened spell-bound.  When he had risen, amid the groans and\nhisses of that great crowd, she had sympathised with him, had feared\neven for his life, had wondered at the strange courage which made him\nattempt the seemingly impossible task of convincing such an audience.\nAs he had progressed and had begun to gain power and approval, she had\nrejoiced; every cheer had given her pleasure.  She had silently joined\nin the indignation which the crowd had expressed against Sorrento's\npolice-agents.  Now he was attacking her husband; and yet she hardly\nseemed to feel an emotion of antagonism.\n\nHe left the subject of the Ministers with contemptuous scorn, amid the\nearnest assent of the audience and on the full tide of public opinion.\nThey must now, he said, treat of higher matters.  He invited them to\nconsider the ideals at which they aimed.  Having roused their tempers,\nhe withheld from them the outburst of fury and enthusiasm they desired.\nAs he spoke of the hopes of happiness to which even the most miserable\nof human beings had a right, silence reigned throughout the hall,\nbroken only by that grave melodious voice which appealed to everyone.\nFor more than three quarters of an hour he discussed social and\nfinancial reforms.  Sound practical common sense was expressed with\nmany a happy instance, many a witty analogy, many a lofty and luminous\nthought.\n\n\"When I look at this beautiful country that is ours and was our fathers\nbefore us, at its blue seas and snow-capped mountains, at its\ncomfortable hamlets and wealthy cities, at its silver streams and\ngolden corn-fields, I marvel at the irony of fate which has struck\nacross so fair a prospect the dark shadow of a military despotism.\"\n\nThe sound of momentous resolution rose again from the crowded hall.  He\nhad held their enthusiasm back for an hour by the clock.  The steam had\nbeen rising all this time.  All were searching in their minds for\nsomething to relieve their feelings, to give expression to the\nindividual determination each man had made.  There was only one mind\nthroughout the hall.  His passions, his emotions, his very soul\nappeared to be communicated to the seven thousand people who heard his\nwords; and they mutually inspired each other.\n\nThen at last he let them go.  For the first time he raised his voice,\nand in a resonant, powerful, penetrating tone which thrilled the\nlisteners, began the peroration of his speech.  The effect of his\nchange of manner was electrical.  Each short sentence was followed by\nwild cheering.  The excitement of the audience became indescribable.\nEveryone was carried away by it.  Lucile was borne along, unresisting,\nby that strong torrent of enthusiasm; her interests, her objects, her\nambitions, her husband, all were forgotten.  His sentences grew longer,\nmore rolling and sonorous.  At length he reached the last of those\ncumulative periods which pile argument on argument as Pelion on Ossa.\nAll pointed to an inevitable conclusion.  The people saw it coming and\nwhen the last words fell, they were greeted with thunders of assent.\n\nThen he sat down, drank some water, and pressed his hands to his head.\nThe strain had been terrific.  He was convulsed by his own emotions;\nevery pulse in his body was throbbing, every nerve quivering; he\nstreamed with perspiration and almost gasped for breath.  For five\nminutes everyone shouted wildly; the delegates on the platform mounted\ntheir chairs and waved their arms.  At his suggestion the great crowd\nwould have sallied into the streets and marched on the palace; and it\nwould have taken many bullets from the soldiers that Sorrento had so\ncarefully posted to bring them back to the realisation of the squalid\nmaterialities of life.\n\nThe resolutions which Moret and Godoy proposed were carried by\nacclamation.  Savrola turned to the former.  \"Well, Louis, I was right.\nHow did it sound?  I liked the last words.  It is the best speech I\nhave ever made.\"\n\nMoret looked at him as at a god.  \"Splendid!\" he said.  \"You have saved\neverything.\"\n\nAnd now the meeting began to break up.  Savrola walked to a side-door,\nand in a small waiting-room received the congratulations of all his\nprincipal supporters and friends.  Lucile was hurried along in the\npress.  Presently there was a block.  Two men, of foreign aspect, stood\nin front of her, speaking in low tones.\n\n\"Brave words, Karl,\" said one.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the other, \"we must have deeds.  He is a good tool to work\nwith at present; the time will come when we shall need something\nsharper.\"\n\n\"He has great power.\"\n\n\"Yes, but he is not of us.  He has no sympathy with the cause.  What\ndoes he care about a community of goods?\"\n\n\"For my part,\" said the first man with an ugly laugh, \"I have always\nbeen more attracted by the idea of a community of wives.\"\n\n\"Well, that too is part of the great scheme of society.\"\n\n\"When you deal them out, Karl, put me down as part proprietor of the\nPresident's.\"\n\nHe chuckled coarsely.  Lucile shuddered.  Here were the influences\nbehind and beneath the great Democrat of which her husband had spoken.\n\nThe human stream began to flow on again.  Lucile was carried by a\ncurrent down a side street which led to the doorway by which Savrola\nwould leave the hall.  A bright gas-lamp made everything plainly\nvisible.  At length he appeared at the top of the steps, at the foot of\nwhich his carriage had already drawn up to receive him.  The narrow\nstreet was filled with the crowd; the pressure was severe.\n\n\"Louis, come with me,\" said Savrola to Moret; \"you can drop me and take\nthe carriage on.\"  Like many highly-wrought minds he yearned for\nsympathy and praise at such a moment; and he knew he would get them\nfrom Moret.\n\nThe throng, on seeing him, surged forward.  Lucile, carried off her\nfeet, was pushed into a dark burly man in front of her.  Chivalrous\ngallantry is not among the peculiar characteristics of excited\ndemocracy.  Without looking round the man jobbed backwards with his\nelbow and struck her in the breast.  The pain was intense;\ninvoluntarily she screamed.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" cried Savrola, \"a woman has been hurt; I heard her voice.\nGive room there!\"  He ran down the steps.  The crowd opened out.  A\ndozen eager and officious hands were extended to assist Lucile, who was\nparalysed with terror.  She would be recognised; the consequences were\ntoo awful to be thought of.\n\n\"Bring her in here,\" said Savrola.  \"Moret, help me.\"  He half carried,\nhalf supported her up the steps into the small waiting-room.  Godoy,\nRenos, and half a dozen of the Democratic leaders, who had been\ndiscussing the speech, grouped themselves around her curiously.  He\nplaced her in a chair.  \"A glass of water,\" he said quickly.  Somebody\nhanded him one, and he turned to offer it to her.  Lucile, incapable of\nspeech or motion, saw no way of escape.  He must recognise her.  The\nridicule, the taunts, the danger, all were plain to her.  As she made a\nfeeble effort with her hand to decline the water, Savrola looked hard\nat her through her thick veil.  Suddenly he started, spilling the water\nhe was holding out to her.  He knew her then!  Now it would come--a\nterrible exposure!\n\n\"Why, Mirette,\" he cried, \"my little niece!  How could you come alone\nto such a crowded place at night?  To hear my speech?  Godoy, Renos,\nthis is indeed a tribute!  This means more to me than all the cheers of\nthe people.  Here is my sister's daughter who has risked the crowd to\ncome and hear me speak.  But your mother,\" he turned to Lucile, \"should\nnever have allowed you; this is no place for a girl alone.  I must take\nyou home.  You are not hurt?  If you had asked me, I could have ensured\na seat for you out of the crowd.  Is my carriage there?  Good, we had\nbetter get home at once; your mother will be very anxious.  Good-night,\ngentlemen.  Come, my dear.\"  He offered her his arm and led her down\nthe steps.  The people who filled the street, their upturned faces pale\nin the gas-light, cheered wildly.  He put her into his carriage.\n\"Drive on, coachman,\" he said, getting in himself.\n\n\"Where to, Sir?\" asked the man.\n\nMoret advanced to the carriage.  \"I will go on the box,\" he said.  \"I\ncan take the carriage on after dropping you,\" and before Savrola could\nsay a word he had climbed on to the seat beside the driver.\n\n\"Where to, Sir?\" repeated the coachman.\n\n\"Home,\" said Savrola desperately.\n\nThe carriage started, passed through the cheering crowds, and out into\nthe less frequented parts of the city.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nIN THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.\n\nLucile lay back in the cushions of the brougham with a feeling of\nintense relief.  He had saved her.  An emotion of gratitude filled her\nmind, and on the impulse of the moment she took his hand and pressed\nit.  It was the third time in their renewed acquaintance that their\nhands had met, and each time the significance had been different.\n\nSavrola smiled.  \"It was most imprudent of your Excellency to venture\ninto a crowd like that.  Luckily I thought of an expedient in time.  I\ntrust you were not hurt in the throng?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Lucile; \"a man struck me with his elbow and I screamed.  I\nshould never have come.\"\n\n\"It was dangerous.\"\n\n\"I wanted to----\"  She paused.\n\n\"To hear me speak,\" he added, finishing her sentence for her.\n\n\"Yes; to see you use your power.\"\n\n\"I am flattered by the interest you take in me.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was on purely political grounds.\"\n\nThere was the suspicion of a smile on her face.  He looked at her\nquickly.  What did she mean?  Why should it be necessary to say so?\nHer mind had contemplated another reason, then.\n\n\"I hope you were not bored,\" he said.\n\n\"It is terrible to have power like that,\" she replied earnestly; and\nthen after a pause, \"Where are we going to?\"\n\n\"I would have driven you to the palace,\" said Savrola, \"but our\ningenuous young friend on the box has made it necessary that we should\nkeep up this farce for a little longer.  It will be necessary to get\nrid of him.  For the present you had best remain my niece.\"\n\nShe looked up at him with an amused smile, and then said seriously: \"It\nwas brilliant of you to have thought of it, and noble of you to have\ncarried it out.  I shall never forget it; you have done me a great\nservice.\"\n\n\"Here we are,\" said Savrola at length, as the brougham drew up at the\nentrance of his house.  He opened the carriage-door; Moret jumped off\nthe box and rang the bell.  After a pause the old housekeeper opened\nthe door.  Savrola called to her.  \"Ah, Bettine, I am glad you are up.\nHere is my niece, who has been to the meeting to hear me speak and has\nbeen jostled by the crowd.  I shall not let her go home alone to-night.\nHave you a bedroom ready?\"\n\n\"There is the spare room on the first floor,\" answered the old woman;\n\"but I fear that would never do.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Savrola quickly.\n\n\"Because the sheets for the big bed are not aired, and since the\nchimney was swept there has been no fire there.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, you must try and do what you can.  Good-night, Moret.  Will\nyou send the carriage back as soon as you have done with it?  I have\nsome notes to send to THE RISING TIDE office about the articles for\nto-morrow morning.  Don't forget,--as quickly as you can, for I am\ntired out.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" said Moret.  \"You have made the finest speech of your\nlife.  Nothing can stop us while we have you to lead the way.\"\n\nHe got into the carriage and drove off.  Savrola and Lucile ascended\nthe stairs to the sitting-room, while the housekeeper bustled off to\nmake preparations for the airing of sheets and pillow-cases.  Lucile\nlooked round the room with interest and curiosity.  \"I am in the heart\nof the enemy's camp now,\" she said.\n\n\"You will be in many hearts during your life,\" said Savrola, \"whether\nyou remain a queen or not.\"\n\n\"You are still determined to drive us out?\"\n\n\"You heard what I said to-night.\"\n\n\"I ought to hate you,\" said Lucile; \"and yet I don't feel that we are\nenemies.\"\n\n\"We are on opposite sides,\" he replied.\n\n\"Only politics come between us.\"\n\n\"Politics and persons,\" he added significantly, using a hackneyed\nphrase.\n\nShe looked at him with a startled glance.  What did he mean?  Had he\nread deeper into her heart than she herself had dared to look?  \"Where\ndoes that door lead to?\" she asked irrelevantly.\n\n\"That?  It leads to the roof,--to my observatory.\"\n\n\"Oh show it me,\" she cried.  \"Is it there you watch the stars?\"\n\n\"I often look at them.  I love them; they are full of suggestions and\nideas.\"\n\nHe unlocked the door and led the way up the narrow winding stairs on to\nthe platform.  It was, as is usual in Laurania, a delicious night.\nLucile walked to the parapet and looked over; all the lamps of the town\ntwinkled beneath, and above were the stars.\n\nSuddenly, far out in the harbour, a broad white beam of light shot out;\nit was the search-light of a warship.  For a moment it swept along the\nmilitary mole and rested on the battery at the mouth of the channel.\nThe fleet was leaving the port, and picking its way through the\ndifficult passage.\n\nSavrola had been informed of the approaching departure of the admiral,\nand realised at once the meaning of what he saw.  \"That,\" he said, \"may\nprecipitate matters.\"\n\n\"You mean that when the ships are gone you will no longer fear to rise?\"\n\n\"I do not fear; but it is better to await a good moment.\"\n\n\"And that moment?\"\n\n\"Is perhaps imminent.  I should like you to leave the capital.  It will\nbe no place for women in a few days.  Your husband knows it; why has he\nnot sent you away to the country?\"\n\n\"Because,\" she replied, \"we shall suppress this revolt, and punish\nthose who have caused it.\"\n\n\"Have no illusions,\" said Savrola.  \"I do not miscalculate.  The army\ncannot be trusted; the fleet is gone; the people are determined.  It\nwill not be safe for you to stay here.\"\n\n\"I will not be driven out,\" she answered with energy; \"nothing shall\nmake me fly.  I will perish with my husband.\"\n\n\"Oh, we shall try to be much more prosaic than that,\" he said.  \"We\nshall offer a very handsome pension to the President, and he will\nretire with his beautiful wife to some gay and peaceful city, where he\ncan enjoy life without depriving others of liberty.\"\n\n\"You think you can do all this?\" she cried.  \"Your power can rouse the\nmultitude; but can you restrain them?\"  And she told him of the words\nshe had heard in the crowd that night.  \"Are you not playing with\nmighty forces?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" he said; \"and that is why I have asked you to go away to\nthe country for a few days, until things become settled one way or the\nother.  It is possible that either I or your husband will go down.  I\nshall of course try to save him, if we are successful; but, as you say,\nthere are other forces which may be beyond control; and if he gets the\nupper hand----\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I suppose I should be shot.\"\n\n\"Fearful!\" she said.  \"Why will you persist?\"\n\n\"Oh, it is only now, when the play is growing high, that I begin to\nappreciate the game.  Besides, death is not very terrible.\"\n\n\"Afterwards may be.\"\n\n\"I do not think so.  Life, to continue, must show a balance of\nhappiness.  Of one thing I feel sure; we may say of a future\nstate,--'If any, then better.'\"\n\n\"You apply your knowledge of this world to all others.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" he said.  \"Why should not the same laws hold good all over\nthe universe, and, if possible, beyond it?  Other suns show by their\nspectra that they contain the same elements as ours.\"\n\n\"You put your faith in the stars,\" she said doubtingly, \"and think,\nthough you will not admit it, they can tell you everything.\"\n\n\"I never accused them of being interested in our concerns; but if they\nwere, they might tell strange tales.  Supposing they could read our\nhearts for instance?\"\n\nShe glanced up and met his eye.  They looked at each other hard.  She\ngasped; whatever the stars might know, they had read each other's\nsecret.\n\nThere was a noise of someone running up-stairs.  It was the housekeeper.\n\n\"The carriage has returned,\" said Savrola in a quiet voice.  \"It can\nnow take you back to the palace.\"\n\nThe old woman stepped out on to the roof, breathing hard from her\nclimb.  \"I have aired the sheets,\" she said with exultation in her\nvoice, \"and the fire is burning brightly.  There is some soup ready for\nthe young lady, if she will come and take it, before it gets cold.\"\n\nThe interruption was so commonplace that both Lucile and Savrola\nlaughed.  It was a happy escape from an awkward moment.  \"You always\nmanage, Bettine,\" he said, \"to make everyone comfortable; but after all\nthe bedroom will not be needed.  My niece is afraid lest her mother be\nalarmed at her absence, and I am going to send her back in the carriage\nso soon as it returns.\"\n\nThe poor old soul looked terribly disappointed; the warm sheets, the\ncosy fire, the hot soup were comforts she loved to prepare for others,\nenjoying them, as it were, by proxy.  She turned away and descended the\nnarrow staircase mournfully, leaving them again alone.\n\nSo they sat and talked, not as before, but with full knowledge of their\nsympathy, while the moon climbed higher in the sky and the soft breezes\nstirred the foliage of the palm-trees in the garden below.  Neither\nthought much of the future, nor did they blame the coachman's delay.\n\nAt length the silence of the night, and the train of their conversation\nwere broken by the noise of wheels on the stony street.\n\n\"At last,\" said Savrola without enthusiasm.  Lucile rose and looked\nover the parapet.  A carriage approached almost at a gallop.  It\nstopped suddenly at the door, and a man jumped out in a hurry.  The\ndoor-bell rang loudly.\n\nSavrola took both her hands.  \"We must part,\" he said; \"when shall we\nmeet again,--Lucile?\"\n\nShe made no answer, nor did the moonlight betray the expression of her\nfeatures.  Savrola led the way down the stairs.  As he entered the\nsitting-room, the further door was opened hastily by a man who, seeing\nSavrola, stopped short, and respectfully took off his hat.  It was\nMoret's servant.\n\nWith considerable presence of mind Savrola shut the door behind him,\nleaving Lucile in the darkness of the staircase.  She waited in\nastonishment; the door was thin.  \"My master, Sir,\" said a stranger's\nvoice, \"bade me bring you this with all speed and give it direct into\nyour hand.\"  There followed the tearing of paper, a pause, an\nexclamation, and then Savrola, in a voice steady with the steadiness\nwhich betrays intense emotion under control, replied: \"Thank you very\nmuch; say I shall await them here.  Don't take the carriage; go on\nfoot,--stay, I will let you out myself.\"\n\nShe heard the other door open and the sound of their footsteps going\ndown-stairs; then she turned the handle and entered.  Something had\nhappened, something sudden, unexpected, momentous.  His voice,--strange\nhow well she was beginning to know it!--had told her that.  An envelope\nlay on the floor; on the table,--the table where the cigarette-box and\nthe revolver lay side by side,--was a paper, half curled up as if\nanxious to preserve its secret.\n\nSubtle, various, and complex are the springs of human action.  She felt\nthe paper touched her nearly; she knew it concerned him.  Their\ninterests were antagonistic; yet she did not know whether it was for\nhis sake or her own that she was impelled to indulge a wild curiosity.\nShe smoothed the paper out.  It was brief and in a hurried hand, but to\nthe point: _Code wire just received says, Strelitz crossed frontier\nthis morning with two thousand men and is marching hither via Turga and\nLorenzo.  The hour has come.  I have sent to Godoy and Renos and will\nbring them round at once.  Yours through hell_, MORET.\n\nLucile felt the blood run to her heart; already she imagined the sound\nof musketry.  It was true the hour had come.  The fatal paper\nfascinated her; she could not take her eyes from it.  Suddenly the door\nopened and Savrola came in.  The noise, her agitation, and above all\nthe sense of detection wrung from her a low, short, startled scream.\nHe grasped the situation immediately.  \"Bluebeard,\" he said ironically.\n\n\"Treason,\" she retorted taking refuge in furious anger.  \"So you will\nrise and murder us in the night,--conspirator!\"\n\nSavrola smiled suavely; his composure was again perfect.  \"I have sent\nthe messenger away on foot, and the carriage is at your disposal.  We\nhave talked long; it is now three o'clock; your Excellency should not\nfurther delay your return to the palace.  It would be most imprudent;\nbesides, as you will realise, I expect visitors.\"\n\nHis calmness maddened her.  \"Yes,\" she retorted; \"the President will\nsend you some,--police.\"\n\n\"He will not know about the invasion yet.\"\n\n\"I shall tell him,\" she replied.\n\nSavrola laughed softly.  \"Oh no,\" he said, \"that would not be fair.\"\n\n\"All's fair in love and war.\"\n\n\"And this----?\"\n\n\"Is both,\" she said, and then burst into tears.\n\nAfter that they went down-stairs.  Savrola helped her into the\ncarriage.  \"Good-night,\" he said, though it was already morning, \"and\ngood-bye.\"\n\nBut Lucile, not knowing what to say or think or do, continued to cry\ninconsolably and the carriage drove away.  Savrola closed the door and\nreturned to his room.  He did not feel his secret was in any danger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nA COUNCIL OF WAR.\n\nSavrola had scarcely time to smoke a cigarette before the Revolutionary\nleaders began to arrive.  Moret was the first; he rang the bell\nviolently, stamping about on the doorstep till it was answered, ran\nupstairs three steps at a time, and burst impetuously into the room,\naquiver with excitement.  \"Ah,\" he cried, \"the hour has come,--not\nwords but deeds now!  We draw the sword in a good cause; for my part I\nshall fling away the scabbard; Fortune is on our side.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Savrola; \"have some whisky and soda-water,--on the\nsideboard there.  It is a good drink to draw the sword on,--the best in\nfact.\"\n\nMoret somewhat abashed turned and walking to the table began opening a\nsoda-water bottle.  As he poured out the spirit the clinking of glass\nand bottle betrayed his agitation.  Savrola laughed softly.  Turning\nswiftly, his impetuous follower sought to hide his agitation by a fresh\noutburst.  \"I have told you throughout,\" he said, holding his glass on\nhigh, \"that force was the only solution.  It has come, as I predicted.\nI drink to it,--war, civil war, battle, murder, and sudden death,--by\nthese means liberty will be regained!\"\n\n\"Wonderful soothing effect these cigarettes have.  There's no opium in\nthem either,--soft, fresh Egyptians.  I get them every week from Cairo.\nA little, old man I met there three years ago makes them,--Abdullah\nRachouan.\"\n\nHe held out the box.  Moret took one; the business of lighting it\nsteadied him; he sat down and began to smoke furiously.  Savrola\nwatched him in dreamy calmness, looking often at the smoke-wreathes\nthat rose about him.  Presently he spoke.  \"So you are glad there is to\nbe war and that people are to be killed?\"\n\n\"I am glad that this tyranny is to be ended.\"\n\n\"Remember that we pay for every pleasure and every triumph we have in\nthis world.\"\n\n\"I will take my chance.\"\n\n\"I trust, I would be glad if I could say with conviction, I pray, that\nthe lot may not fall on you.  But it is true nevertheless that we must\npay, and for all the good things in life men pay in advance.  The\nprinciples of sound finance apply.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" asked Moret.\n\n\"Would you rise in the world?  You must work while others amuse\nthemselves.  Are you desirous of a reputation for courage?  You must\nrisk your life.  Would you be strong morally or physically?  You must\nresist temptations.  All this is paying in advance; that is prospective\nfinance.  Observe the other side of the picture; the bad things are\npaid for afterwards.\"\n\n\"Not always.\"\n\n\"Yes, as surely as the headache of Sunday morning follows the debauch\nof Saturday night, as an idle youth is requited by a barren age, as a\ngluttonous appetite promotes an ungainly paunch.\"\n\n\"And you think I shall have to pay for this excitement and enthusiasm?\nYou think I have paid nothing so far?\"\n\n\"You will have to take risks, that is paying.  Fate will often throw\ndouble or quits.  But on these hazards men should not embark with\nlevity; the gentleman will always think of settling-day.\"\n\nMoret was silent.  Brave and impetuous as he was, the conversation\nchilled him.  His was not the courage of the Stoic; he had not schooled\nhimself to contemplate the shock of dissolution.  He fixed his thoughts\non the struggles and hopes of the world, as one might look at the\nflowers and grasses that were growing on the edge of a precipice\ntowards which he was being impelled.\n\nThey remained for a few moments without speaking, till Godoy and Renos\nentered, having arrived simultaneously.\n\nEach man of the four had taken the news, which meant so much to them,\naccording to their natures.  Savrola had put on the armour of his\nphilosophy, and gazed on the world as from a distance.  Moret had been\nconvulsed with excitement.  The other two, neither composed nor elated\nby the proximity and the approach of danger, showed that they were not\nthe men for stirring times.\n\nSavrola greeted them amiably, and all sat down.  Renos was crushed.\nThe heavy hammer of action had fallen on the delicate structures of\nprecedent and technicality in which he had always trusted, and smashed\nthem flat.  Now that the crisis had arrived, the law, his shield and\nbuckler, was first of all to be thrown away.  \"Why has he done this?\"\nhe asked.  \"What right had he to come without authorisation?  He has\ncommitted us all.  What can we do?\"\n\nGodoy too was shocked and frightened.  He was one of those men who fear\ndanger, who shrink from it, but yet embark deliberately on courses\nwhich they know must lead to it.  He had long foreseen the moment of\nrevolt, but had persisted in going on.  Now it was upon him, and he\ntrembled; still, his dignity strengthened him.\n\n\"What is to be done, Savrola?\" he asked, turning instinctively to the\ngreater soul and stronger mind.\n\n\"Well,\" said the leader, \"they had no business to come without my\norders; they have, as Renos has observed, committed us, while our plans\nare in some respects incomplete.  Strelitz has disobeyed me flatly; I\nwill settle with him later.  For the present, recriminations are\nfutile; we have to deal with the situation.  The President will know of\nthe invasion in the morning; some of the troops here will, I take it,\nbe ordered to strengthen the Government forces in the field.  Perhaps\nthe Guard will be sent.  I think the others would refuse to march; they\nare thoroughly in sympathy with the Cause.  If so we must strike, much\nas we have arranged.  You, Moret, will call the people to arms.  The\nProclamation must be printed, the rifles served out, the Revolution\nproclaimed.  All the Delegates must be notified.  If the soldiers\nfraternise, all will be well; if not, you will have to fight--I don't\nthink there will be much opposition--storm the palace and make Molara\nprisoner.\"\n\n\"It shall be done,\" said Moret.\n\n\"Meanwhile,\" continued Savrola, \"we will proclaim the Provisional\nGovernment at the Mayoralty.  Thence I shall send you orders; thither\nyou must send me reports.  All this will happen the day after\nto-morrow.\"\n\nGodoy shivered, but assented.  \"Yes,\" he said; \"it is the only course,\nexcept flight and ruin.\"\n\n\"Very well; now we will go into details.  First of all, the\nProclamation.  I will write that to-night.  Moret, you must get it\nprinted; you shall have it at six o'clock to-morrow morning.  Then\nprepare the arrangements we had devised for assembling and arming the\npeople; wait till you get a written order from me to put them into\naction.  You, Renos, must see the members of the Provisional\nGovernment.  Have the constitution of the Council of Public Safety\nprinted, and be ready to circulate it to-morrow night; yet again, wait\ntill I give the word.  Much depends on the attitude of the troops; but\neverything is really ready.  I do not think we need fear the result.\"\n\nThe intricate details of the plot, for plot it was, were well known to\nthe leaders of the revolt.  For several months they had looked to force\nas the only means of ending the government they detested.  Savrola was\nnot the man to commit himself to such an enterprise without taking\nevery precaution.  Nothing had been forgotten; the machinery of\nrevolution only needed setting in motion.  Yet in spite of the\nelaborate nature of the conspiracy and its great scale, the President\nand his police had been able to learn nothing definite.  They feared\nthat a rising was imminent; they had realised the danger for some\nmonths; but it was impossible to know where the political agitation\nended, and the open sedition began.  The great social position and\nalmost European reputation of the principal leaders had rendered their\narrest without certain proof a matter of extreme difficulty.  The\nPresident, believing that the people would not rise unless spurred\nthereto by some act of power on the part of the Executive, feared to\nrouse them.  But for this Savrola, Moret, and the others would have\nalready filled cells in the State Prison; indeed, they would have had\nmuch to be thankful for had their lives been spared.\n\nBut Savrola understood his position, and had played his game with\nconsummate tact and skill.  The great parade he made of the political\nagitation had prevented the President from observing the conspiracy to\ndeliberate violence which lay beneath.  At length the preparations were\napproaching completion.  It had become only a matter of days;\nStrelitz's impetuous act had but precipitated the course of events.\nOne corner of the great firework had caught light too soon; it was\nnecessary to fire the rest lest the effect should be spoiled.\n\nHe continued to go over the details of the scheme for nearly an hour,\nto make sure that there should be no mistakes.  At last all was\nfinished, and the members of the embryo Council of Public Safety took\ntheir departure.  Savrola let them out himself, not wishing to wake the\nold nurse.  Poor soul, why should she feel the force of the struggles\nof ambitious men?\n\nMoret went off full of enthusiasm; the others were gloomy and\npreoccupied.  Their great leader shut the door, and once more that\nnight climbed the stairs to his chamber.\n\nAs he reached it, the first streaks of morning came in through the\nparted curtains of the windows.  The room, in the grey light with its\nhalf-empty glasses and full ashtrays, looked like a woman, no longer\nyoung, surprised by an unsympathetic dawn in the meretricious paints\nand pomps of the previous night.  It was too late to go to bed; yet he\nwas tired, weary with that dry kind of fatigue which a man feels when\nall desire of sleep has passed away.  He experienced a sensation of\nannoyance and depression.  Life seemed unsatisfactory; something was\nlacking.  When all deductions had been made on the scores of ambition,\nduty, excitement, or fame, there remained an unabsorbed residuum of\npure emptiness.  What was the good of it all?  He thought of the silent\nstreets; in a few hours they would echo with the crackle of musketry.\nPoor broken creatures would be carried bleeding to the houses, whose\ndoors terrified women would close in the uncharitable haste of fear.\nOthers, flicked out of human ken from solid concrete earth to unknown,\nunformulated abstractions, would lie limp and reproachful on the\npaving-stones.  And for what?  He could not find an answer to the\nquestion.  The apology for his own actions was merged in the much\ngreater apology nature would have to make for the existence of the\nhuman species.  Well, he might be killed himself; and as the thought\noccurred to him he looked forward with a strange curiosity to that\nsudden change, with perhaps its great revelation.  The reflection made\nhim less dissatisfied with the shallow ends of human ambition.  When\nthe notes of life ring false, men should correct them by referring to\nthe tuning-fork of death.  It is when that clear menacing tone is heard\nthat the love of life grows keenest in the human heart.\n\nAll men, from such moods and reflections, are recalled to earth by hard\nmatters of fact.  He remembered the proclamation he had to write, and\nrising plunged into the numerous details of the business of living, and\nthus forgot the barrenness of life.  So he sat and wrote, while the\npale glimmer of the dawn glowed into the clear light of sunrise and the\nwarm tints of broad day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nTHE ACTION OF THE EXECUTIVE.\n\nThe private breakfast-room of the Presidential palace was a small but\nlofty apartment.  The walls were hung with tapestries; over the doors\nweapons of ancient type and history were arranged in elaborate\npatterns.  The great French windows were deeply set in the wall, and\nthe bright light of the morning was softened by heavy crimson curtains.\nLike the rest of the house it wore an official aspect.  The windows\nopened on to the stone terrace, and those who passed through them\nexperienced a feeling of relief in exchanging the severe splendours of\nthe palace for the beautiful confusion of the garden, where between the\nspreading trees and slender palms the sparkling waters of the harbour\nwere displayed.\n\nThe table, which was set for two, was comfortably small and well\narranged.  The generous revenue which it had long been the principle of\nthe Lauranian Republic to bestow on her First Magistrate enabled the\nPresident to live in a style of elegance and luxury, and to enjoy the\nattractions of good silver, fresh-cut flowers, and an excellent cook.\nBut it was with a clouded brow that Molara met his wife at breakfast on\nthe morning after the events which have just been chronicled.\n\n\"Bad news,--tiresome news again, dear,\" he said as, sitting down and\ndepositing a handful of papers on the table, he signed to the servants\nto leave the room.\n\nLucile experienced a feeling of intense relief.  After all she would\nnot have to tell him the secret she had learned.  \"Has he started?\" she\nasked incautiously.\n\n\"Yes, last night; but he will be stopped.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven for that!\"\n\nMolara looked at her in amazement.\n\n\"What do you mean?  Why are you glad that the Admiral and the fleet are\nprevented from carrying out my orders?\"\n\n\"The fleet!\"\n\n\"Good gracious!  What did you think I meant?\" he asked impatiently.\n\nA loophole of escape presented itself.  She ignored his question.  \"I\nam glad the fleet is stopped because I think they will be wanted here,\nnow that the city is so unsettled.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the President shortly,--suspiciously, she thought.  To cover\nher retreat she asked a question.  \"Why are they stopped?\"\n\nMolara pulled out a Press telegram slip from among his papers.\n\n\"_Port Said, September 9th, 6.0 a.m._,\" he said, reading; \"_British\nsteam-collier Maude, 1,400 tons, grounded this morning in canal, which\nis in consequence blocked for traffic.  Every effort is being made to\nclear the fairway.  Accident is believed to be due to the silting up of\nchannel caused by extreme draught of H.B.M.S. Aggressor which passed\nthrough last night._\"  He added: \"They know their business, these\nEnglish pigs.\"\n\n\"You think they have done it on purpose?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"But the fleet is not there yet.\"\n\n\"It will be there to-morrow night.\"\n\n\"But why should they block the channel now,--why not wait?\"\n\n\"Characteristic dislike of _coups de th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre_, I suppose.  Now the\nFrench would have waited till we were at the entrance of the channel,\nand then shut the door in our faces neatly.  But British Diplomacy does\nnot aim at effects; besides, this looks more natural.\"\n\n\"How abominable!\"\n\n\"And listen to this,\" said the President, as giving way to keen\nirritation he snatched another paper from his bundle and began to read.\n\"From the Ambassador,\" he said: \"_Her Majesty's Government have\ninstructed the officers commanding the various British coaling-stations\nsouth of the Red Sea, to render every assistance to the Lauranian fleet\nand to supply them with coal at the local market-rate_.\"\n\n\"It is an insult,\" she said.\n\n\"It is a cat playing with a mouse,\" he rejoined bitterly.\n\n\"What will you do?\"\n\n\"Do?  Sulk, protest,--but give in.  What else can we do?  Their ships\nare on the spot; ours are cut off.\"\n\nThere was a pause.  Molara read his papers and continued his breakfast.\nLucile came back to her resolution.  She would tell him; but she would\nmake terms.  Savrola must be protected at all costs.  \"Antonio,\" she\nsaid nervously.\n\nThe President, who was in a thoroughly bad temper, went on reading for\na moment and then looked up abruptly.  \"Yes?\"\n\n\"I must tell you something.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"A great danger is threatening us.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" he said shortly.\n\n\"Savrola----\"  She paused uncertain and undecided.\n\n\"What of him?\" said Molara, suddenly becoming interested.\n\n\"If you were to find him guilty of conspiracy, of plotting revolution,\nwhat would you do?\"\n\n\"I should shoot him with the greatest pleasure in the world.\"\n\n\"What, without a trial?\"\n\n\"Oh no!  He should have a trial under martial law and welcome.  What of\nhim?\"\n\nIt was a bad moment.  She looked round for another loophole.\n\n\"He--he made a speech last night,\" she said.\n\n\"He did,\" said the President impatiently.\n\n\"Well, I think it must have been very inflammatory, because I heard the\ncrowds cheering in the streets all night.\"\n\nMolara looked at her in deep disgust.  \"My dear, how silly you are this\nmorning,\" he said and returned to his paper.\n\nThe long silence that followed was broken by the hurried entrance of\nMiguel with an opened telegram.  He walked straight up to the President\nand handed it to him without speaking; but Lucile could see that he was\ntrembling with haste, excitement, or terror.\n\nMolara opened the folded paper leisurely, smoothed it on the table and\nthen jumped out of his chair as he read it.  \"Good God! when did this\ncome?\"\n\n\"This moment.\"\n\n\"The fleet,\" he cried, \"the fleet, Miguel,--not an instant must be\nlost!  Recall the Admiral!  They must return at once.  I will write the\ntelegram myself.\"  Crumpling the message in his hand he hurried out of\nthe room, Miguel at his heels.  At the door he found a waiting servant.\n\"Send for Colonel Sorrento,--to come here immediately.  Go! be off!\nRun!\" he cried as the man departed with ceremonious slowness.\n\nLucile heard them bustle down the corridor and the slam of a distant\ndoor; then all was silent again.  She knew what that telegram\ncontained.  The tragedy had burst upon them all, that tragedy whose\nclimax must strike her so nearly; but she felt glad she had meant to\ntell her husband,--and yet more glad that she had not told him.  A\ncynic might have observed that Savrola's confidence, in the safety of\nhis secret, was well founded.\n\nShe returned to her sitting-room.  The uncertainty of the immediate\nfuture terrified her.  If the revolt succeeded, she and her husband\nwould have to fly for their lives; if it were suppressed the\nconsequences seemed more appalling.  One thing was clear: the President\nwould send her out of the capital at once to some place of safety.\nWhither?  Amid all these doubts and conflicting emotions one desire\npredominated,--to see Savrola again, to bid him good-bye, to tell him\nshe had not betrayed him.  It was impossible.  A prey to many\napprehensions she walked aimlessly about the room, awaiting the\ndevelopements she feared.\n\nMeanwhile the President and his secretary had reached the private\noffice.  Miguel shut the door.  Both looked at each other.\n\n\"It has come,\" said Molara with a long breath.\n\n\"In an evil hour,\" replied the Secretary.\n\n\"I shall win, Miguel.  Trust to my star, my luck,--I will see this\nthing through.  We shall crush them; but much is to be done.  Now write\nthis telegram to our agent at Port Said; send it in cipher and clear\nthe line: _Charter at once fast despatch-boat and go personally to meet\nAdmiral de Mello, who with fleet left Laurania midnight 8th instant for\nPort Said.  Stop.  Order him in my name return here urgent.  Stop.\nSpare no expense_.  Now send that off.  With good luck the ships should\nbe here to-morrow night.\"\n\nMiguel sat down and began to put the message into code.  The President\npaced the room excitedly; then he rang the bell; a servant entered.\n\n\"Has Colonel Sorrento come yet?\"\n\n\"No, Your Excellency.\"\n\n\"Send and tell him to come at once.\"\n\n\"He has been sent for, Your Excellency.\"\n\n\"Send again.\"\n\nThe man disappeared.\n\nMolara rang the bell once more.  He met the servant in the doorway.\n\n\"Is there a mounted orderly?\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Excellency.\"\n\n\"Finished, Miguel?\"\n\n\"Here,\" said the Secretary, getting up and handing the message to the\nstartled attendant,--\"at speed.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" shouted the President, striking the table with his open hand,\nand the man fled from the room.  The sound of the galloping horse\nsomewhat allayed Molara's impatience.\n\n\"He crossed the frontier last night at nine o'clock, Miguel; he should\nhave been at Turga at daybreak.  We have a garrison there, a small one,\nbut enough to delay the advance.  Why is there no news?  This telegram\ncomes from Paris, from the Foreign Minister.  We should have heard\nfrom--who is it commands the post?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Your Excellency.  The Colonel will be here directly; but\nthe silence is ugly.\"\n\nThe President set his teeth.  \"I cannot trust the army; they are all\ndisaffected.  It is a terrible game; but I shall win, I shall win!\"  He\nrepeated the sentence to himself several times with more energy than\nconviction, as if to fortify his heart.\n\nThe door opened.  \"Colonel Sorrento,\" announced the usher.\n\n\"Look here, old man,\" said Molara familiarly,--he felt he wanted a\nfriend rather than a subordinate--\"Strelitz has invaded us.  He crossed\nthe frontier last night with two thousand men and several Maxim guns,\nmarching here by Turga and Lorenzo.  We have no news from the\nCommandant at Turga; who is he?\"\n\nSorrento was one of those soldiers, not an uncommon type, who fear\nlittle but independent responsibility.  He had served under the\nPresident for many years in the field and in the Government.  Had he\nbeen alone when the news arrived, he would have been thunderstruck; now\nthat he had a leader he followed and obeyed with military precision.\nWithout any appearance of surprise he thought for a moment and then\nreplied: \"Major de Roc.  He has four companies,--a good officer,--you\ncan trust him, Sir.\"\n\n\"But the troops?\"\n\n\"That's another matter altogether.  The whole army, as I have several\ntimes informed you, Sir, is disturbed.  Only the Guard can be relied\non, and, of course, the officers.\"\n\n\"Well, we shall see,\" said the President stoutly.  \"Miguel, get the\nmap.  You know the country, Sorrento.  Between Turga and Lorenzo, the\nBlack Gorge must be held.  Here,\" he pointed on the map, which the\nSecretary unrolled, \"here they must be stopped or at any rate delayed,\ntill the fleet comes back.  What is there at Lorenzo?\"\n\n\"A battalion and two machine-guns,\" replied the War-Minister.\n\nThe President took a turn up and down the room.  He was used to\ndeciding quickly.  \"A brigade would do it for certain,\" he said.  He\ntook another turn.  \"Rail two battalions of the Guard at once to\nLorenzo.\"  Sorrento, who had produced his note-book, began to write.\n\"Two field-batteries,\" said the President.  \"Which two are fit,\nColonel?\"\n\n\"The first and second will do,\" answered Sorrento.\n\n\"And the Lancers of the Guard.\"\n\n\"All?\"\n\n\"Yes, all, except details for orderly-work.\"\n\n\"That leaves you only one trustworthy battalion.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said the President.  \"It is a bold course, but the only one.\nNow what about the Line regiments in the city?  Which are the worst?\"\n\n\"The third, fifth, and eleventh have caused us most uneasiness.\"\n\n\"Very well; we will get them out of the way.  Let them march to-day\ntowards Lorenzo and halt anywhere ten miles out of the city as a\nsupporting brigade.  Now, who is to command?\"\n\n\"Rollo is senior, Sir.\"\n\n\"A fool, a fossil, and out of date,\" cried the President.\n\n\"Stupid, but steady,\" said Sorrento.  \"You can rely upon his attempting\nnothing brilliant; he will do what he is told, and nothing more.\"\n\nMolara reflected on this tremendous military virtue.  \"Very well; give\nhim the supporting brigade; they will have no fighting.  But the other\nbusiness; that is different.  Brienz should have it.\"\n\n\"Why not Drogan?\" suggested the War-Minister.\n\n\"I can't stand his wife,\" said the President.\n\n\"He is a good musician, Sir,\" interposed Miguel.\n\n\"Guitar,--very melodious.\"  He shook his head appreciatively.\n\n\"And has a capital cook,\" added Sorrento.\n\n\"No,\" said Molara; \"this is a matter of life and death.  I cannot\nindulge my prejudices, nor yours; he is not a good man.\"\n\n\"A good Staff would run him all right, Sir; he is very placid and\neasily led.  And he is a great friend of mine; many's the good\ndinner----\"\n\n\"No, Colonel, it's no good; I cannot.  Is it likely that when so much\nis at stake, when my reputation, my chances in life, indeed life\nitself, are on the hazard, that I or any one would give a great command\non such grounds?  If claims were equally balanced, I would oblige you;\nbut Brienz is a better man and must have it.  Besides,\" he added, \"he\nhas not got a horrid wife.\"  Sorrento looked terribly disappointed but\nsaid no more.  \"Well, that is all settled.  I leave all details to you.\nThe Staff, everything, you may appoint; but the troops must start by\nnoon.  I will speak to them myself at the station.\"\n\nThe War-Minister bowed and departed, solaced by the minor appointments\nwhich the President had left to his decision.\n\nMolara looked at his secretary dubiously.  \"Is there anything else to\ndo?  None of the revolutionaries in the city have moved, have they?\"\n\n\"They have given no sign, Sir; there is nothing to incriminate them.\"\n\n\"It is possible this has surprised them; their plans are not ready.  At\nthe first overt act of violence or sedition, I will arrest them.  But I\nmust have proofs, not for my own satisfaction, but for the country.\"\n\n\"This is a critical moment,\" said the Secretary.  \"If the leaders of\nthe sedition could be discredited, if they could be made to appear\nridiculous or insincere, it would have a great effect on public\nopinion.\"\n\n\"I had thought,\" replied Molara, \"that we might hope to learn something\nof their plans.\"\n\n\"You have informed me that Her Excellency has consented to ask Se\u00c3\u00b1or\nSavrola for information on this point?\"\n\n\"I dislike the idea of any intimacy between them; it might be\ndangerous.\"\n\n\"It might be made most dangerous for him.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"In the way I have already indicated to you, General.\"\n\n\"Do you mean in the way I forbade you to suggest, Sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And this is the moment?\"\n\n\"Now or never.\"\n\nThere was a silence, after which they resumed the morning's business.\nFor an hour and a half both worked busily.  Then Molara spoke.  \"I hate\ndoing it; it's a dirty job.\"\n\n\"What is necessary, is necessary,\" said the Secretary sententiously.\nThe President was about to make a reply when a clerk entered the room\nwith a deciphered telegram.  Miguel took it from him, read it, and\npassed it to his chief, saying grimly as he did so: \"Perhaps this will\ndecide you.\"\n\nThe President read the message, and as he read his face grew hard and\ncruel.  It was from the Police Commissary at Turga, brief but terrible;\nthe soldiers had deserted to the invaders, having first shot their\nofficers.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Molara at last, \"I shall require you to accompany me\nto-night on a mission of importance.  I will take an aide-de-camp as\nwell.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Secretary; \"witnesses are necessary.\"\n\n\"I shall be armed.\"\n\n\"That is desirable, but only as a threat, only as a threat,\" said the\nSecretary earnestly.  \"He is too strong for violence; the people would\nbe up in a moment.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" curtly replied the President, and then with savage\nbitterness he added: \"but for that there would be no difficulty.\"\n\n\"None whatever,\" said Miguel, and went on writing.\n\nMolara rose and went in search of Lucile, choking down the disgust and\nrepugnance he felt.  He was determined now; it might just make the\ndifference to him in the struggle for power, and besides, it contained\nthe element of revenge.  He would like to see the proud Savrola grovel\nand beg for mercy at his feet.  All mere politicians, he said to\nhimself, were physical cowards; the fear of death would paralyse his\nrival.\n\nLucile was still in her sitting-room when her husband entered.  She met\nhim with an anxious look.  \"What has happened, Antonio?\"\n\n\"We have been invaded, dearest, by a large force of revolutionaries.\nThe garrison of Turga have deserted to the enemy, and killed their\nofficers.  The end is now in sight.\"\n\n\"It is terrible,\" she said.\n\n\"Lucile,\" he said with unwonted tenderness, \"one chance remains.  If\nyou could find out what the leaders of the agitation in this city\nintend to do, if you can get Savrola to show his hand, we might\nmaintain our position and overcome our enemies.  Can you,--will you do\nthis?\"\n\nLucile's heart bounded.  It was, as he said, a chance.  She might\ndefeat the plot, and at the same time make terms for Savrola; she might\nstill rule in Laurania, and, though this thought she repressed, save\nthe man she loved.  Her course was clear; to obtain the information and\nsell it to her husband for Savrola's life and liberty.  \"I will try,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"I knew you would not fail me, dearest,\" said Molara.  \"But the time is\nshort; go and see him to-night at his rooms.  He will surely tell you.\nYou have power over men and will succeed.\"\n\nLucile reflected.  To herself she said, \"I shall save the State and\nserve my husband;\" and herself rejoined, \"You will see him again.\"\nThen she spoke aloud.  \"I will go to-night.\"\n\n\"My dear, I always trusted you,\" said the President; \"I will never\nforget your devotion.\"\n\nThen he hurried away, convulsed with remorse,--and shame.  He had\nindeed stooped to conquer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nTHE LOYALTY OF THE ARMY.\n\nThe military force of the Lauranian Republic was proportioned to the\nduties of protecting its territories from invasion and of maintaining\nlaw and order within them, but was by the wisdom of former days\nrestricted to limits which did not encourage great schemes of foreign\nconquest nor any aggressive meddling in the affairs of the neighbouring\nprincipalities.  Four regiments of cavalry, twenty battalions of foot,\nand eight field-batteries comprised the Army of the Line.  Besides\nthese there was the Republican Guard, which consisted of a regiment of\nLancers and three strong battalions of veteran infantry and supported\nby their discipline the authority, and by their magnificence the\ndignity, of the State.\n\nThe great capital city, which exceeded in wealth, population, and\nturbulence the aggregate of the provincial towns, had for its garrison\nthe Guard and half of the entire army.  The remaining troops were\nscattered in small country stations and on the frontiers.\n\nAll the pains that the President had taken to maintain the good will of\nthe soldiery had proved vain.  The revolutionary movement had grown\napace in the ranks of the army, till they were now thoroughly\ndisaffected, and the officers felt that their orders would be obeyed\nonly so far as they were agreeable.  With the Guard it was different.\nAll, or nearly all, had borne their part in the late war and had\nmarched to victory under the generalship of the President.  They\nhonoured and trusted their former commander, and were in turn honoured\nand trusted by him; indeed the favour he had shewn them may have been\namong the causes which had alienated the rest.\n\nIt was the greater part of this Guard that Molara, in his heavy need,\nwas about to send against the invaders.  He well knew the danger of\ndepriving himself of the only troops he could rely on, should the city\nitself rise; but the advancing forces must be stopped at all hazards,\nand the Guard alone were able and willing to do the work.  He would be\nleft almost alone amid the populace who detested him, in the city he\nhad ruled so sternly, with mutinous soldiers as his only defenders.  It\nwas not an inviting prospect, yet it presented some chances of success.\nIt displayed a confidence which, though assumed, might decide the\nwaverers and disgust his foes; and it dealt with the most pressing\nemergency, which was after all the first duty of the Executive.  He did\nnot doubt the ability of the troops he had despatched to disperse, if\nnot to destroy, the rabble that had crossed the frontier.  That danger\nat least was removed by his action.  In two days the fleet would\nreturn, and under its guns his Government might still continue, feared\nand respected.  The intervening period was the crisis, a crisis which\nhe hoped to pass safely through, partly by the force of his\npersonality, and partly by the ridicule and contempt in which he\nintended to plunge his terrible rival.\n\nPunctually at eleven o'clock he left his private office to attire\nhimself in his full uniform as a general of the army, in order that at\nthe parade the troops might be reminded that he too was a soldier and\none who had seen much war.\n\nAt the door Lieutenant Tiro presented himself, in a great state of\nperturbation.  \"Sir,\" he said, \"you will allow me to go with my\nsquadron to the front?  There will be nothing for me to do here.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" replied the President, \"there will be a great deal\nfor you to do here.  You must stay.\"\n\nTiro turned pale.  \"I do beg you, Sir, to allow me to go,\" he said\nearnestly.\n\n\"Impossible,--I want you here.\"\n\n\"But, Sir----\"\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" said Molara impatiently; \"you want to get shot at.  Stay\nhere, and I promise you shall hear bullets in plenty before you have\ndone.\"  He turned away, but the look of bitter disappointment on the\nyoung officer's face induced him to pause.  \"Besides,\" he added,\nassuming that charm of manner of which few great men are destitute, \"I\nrequire you for a service of difficulty and extreme danger.  You have\nbeen specially selected.\"\n\nThe Subaltern said no more, but he was only half consoled.  He thought\nruefully of the green country, the glinting lances, the crack of the\nrifles, and all the interest and joy of war.  He would miss everything;\nhis friends would be there, but he would not share their perils.  They\nwould talk of their adventures in after days and he would have no part\nin their discussions; they would even laugh at him as a \"tame cat\" of\nthe palace, an aide-de-camp for ornamental purposes only.  And as he\nmourned, a distant trumpet-call stung him like the cut of a whip.  It\nwas Boots and Saddles,--the Lancers of the Guard were turning out.  The\nPresident hurried off to array himself, and Tiro descended the stairs\nto order the horses.\n\nMolara was soon ready, and joined his aide-de-camp on the steps of the\npalace.  Attended by a small escort they rode to the railway-station,\npassing, on the way, through groups of sullen citizens who stared\ninsolently, and even spat on the ground in hatred and anger.\n\nThe artillery had already been despatched, but the entraining of the\nrest of the troops had not commenced when the President arrived, and\nthey were drawn up (the cavalry in mass, the infantry in line of\nquarter-columns) in the open space in front of the terminus.  Colonel\nBrienz, who commanded the force, was mounted at their head.  He\nadvanced and saluted; the band struck up the Republican Hymn, and the\ninfantry presented arms with a clash of precision.  The President\nacknowledged these compliments with punctilious care; and then, as the\nrifles were shouldered, he rode towards the ranks.\n\n\"You have a splendid force, Colonel Brienz,\" he said addressing the\nColonel, but speaking loud enough to be heard by the troops.  \"To your\nskill and to their courage the Republic entrusts its safety, and\nentrusts it with confidence.\"  He then turned to the troops: \"Soldiers,\nsome of you will remember the day I asked you to make a great effort\nfor your country and your honour; Sorato is the name that history has\ngiven to the victory which was your answer to my appeal.  Since then we\nhave rested in peace and security, protected by the laurels that have\ncrowned your bayonets.  Now, as the years have passed, those trophies\nare challenged, challenged by the rabble whose backs you have seen so\noften.  Take off the old laurels, soldiers of the Guard, and with the\nbare steel win new ones.  Once again I ask you to do great things, and\nwhen I look along your ranks, I cannot doubt that you will do them.\nFarewell, my heart goes with you; would to God I were your leader!\"\n\nHe shook hands with Brienz and with the senior officers amid loud\ncheers from the troops, some of whom broke from the ranks to press\naround him, while others raised their helmets on their bayonets in\nwarlike enthusiasm.  But as the shouting ceased, a long, discordant\nhowl of derision, till then drowned by the noise, was heard from the\nwatching crowds,--a sinister comment!\n\nMeanwhile at the other end of the town the mobilisation of the Reserve\nBrigade revealed the extreme contrast between the loyalty and\ndiscipline of the Guard and the disaffection of the regiments of the\nLine.\n\nAn ominous silence reigned throughout the barracks.  The soldiers\nwalked about moodily and sullenly, making little attempt to pack their\nkits for the impending march.  Some loitered in groups about the\nparade-ground and under the colonnade which ran round their quarters;\nothers sat sulking on their cots.  The habit of discipline is hard to\nbreak, but here were men steeling themselves to break it.\n\nThese signs did not pass unnoticed by the officers who awaited in\nanxious suspense the hour of parade.\n\n\"Don't push them,\" Sorrento had said to the colonels, \"take them very\ngently;\" and the colonels had severally replied that they would answer\nwith their lives for the loyalty of their men.  It was nevertheless\nthought advisable to try the effect of the order upon a single\nbattalion, and the 11th Regiment was the first to receive the command\nto turn out.\n\nThe bugles blew briskly and cheerily, and the officers, hitching up\ntheir swords and pulling on their gloves, hurried to their respective\ncompanies.  Would the men obey the summons?  It was touch and go.\nAnxiously they waited.  Then by twos and threes the soldiers shuffled\nout and began to form up in their ranks.  At length the companies were\ncomplete, sufficiently complete, that is to say, for there were many\nabsentees.  The officers inspected their units.  It was a dirty parade;\nthe accoutrements were uncleaned, the uniforms carelessly put on, and\nthe general appearance of the men was slovenly to a degree.  But of\nthese things no notice was taken, and as they walked along the ranks\nthe subalterns found something to say in friendly chaff to many of\ntheir soldiers.  They were greeted however with a forbidding silence, a\nsilence not produced by discipline or by respect.  Presently _Markers_\nsounded, the companies moved to the general parade-ground, and soon the\nwhole battalion was drawn up in the middle of the barrack-square.\n\nThe Colonel was on his horse, faultlessly attired, and attended by his\nAdjutant.  He looked calmly at the solid ranks before him, and nothing\nin his bearing revealed the terrible suspense which filled his mind and\ngripped his nerve.  The Adjutant cantered along the column collecting\nthe reports.  \"All present, Sir,\" said the company commanders, but\nthere were several whose voices quavered.  Then he returned to the\nColonel, and fell into his place.  The Colonel looked at his regiment,\nand the regiment at their Colonel.\n\n\"Battalion,--attention!\" he cried, and the soldiers sprang up with a\nclatter and a click.  \"Form,--fours.\"\n\nThe word of command was loud and clear.  About a dozen soldiers moved\nat the call of instinct--moved a little--looked about them, and\nshuffled back to their places again.  The rest budged not an inch.  A\nlong and horrid silence followed.  The Colonel's face turned grey.\n\n\"Soldiers,\" he said, \"I have given you an order; remember the honour of\nthe regiment.  Form,--fours.\"  This time not a man moved.  \"As you\nwere,\" he shouted desperately, though it was an unnecessary command.\n\"The battalion will advance in quarter-column.  Quick march!\"\n\nThe battalion remained motionless.\n\n\"Captain Lecomte,\" said the Colonel, \"what is the name of the\nright-hand man of your company?\"\n\n\"Sergeant Balfe, Sir,\" replied the officer.\n\n\"Sergeant Balfe, I order you to advance.  Quick--march!\"\n\nThe sergeant quivered with excitement; but he held his ground.\n\nThe Colonel opened his pouch and produced his revolver with much\ndeliberation.  He looked carefully at it, as if to see that it was well\ncleaned; then he raised the hammer and rode up close to the mutineer.\nAt ten yards he stopped and took aim.  \"Quick--march!\" he said in a low\nmenacing voice.\n\nIt was evident that a climax had been reached, but at this instant\nSorrento, who, concealed in the archway of the barrack-gate, had\nwatched the proceedings, rode into the square and trotted towards the\nsoldiers.  The Colonel lowered his pistol.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" said the War-Minister.\n\nThe officer replaced his weapon and saluted.\n\n\"Is the regiment ready to move off?\" and then before a reply could be\ngiven he added: \"A very smart parade, but after all it will not be\nnecessary to march to-day.  The President is anxious that the men\nshould have a good night's rest before starting, and,\" raising his\nvoice, \"that they should drink a bumper to the Republic and confusion\nto her enemies.  You may dismiss them, Colonel.\"\n\n\"Fall out,\" said the Colonel, not even caring to risk going through the\ncorrect procedure for dismissing.\n\nThe parade broke up.  The ordered ranks dissolved in a crowd, and the\nsoldiers streamed off towards their barracks.  The officers alone\nremained.\n\n\"I should have shot him, Sir, in another instant,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"No good,\" said Sorrento, \"to shoot one man; it would only infuriate\nthem.  I will have a couple of machine-guns down here to-morrow\nmorning, and we shall see then what will happen.\"\n\nHe turned suddenly, interrupted by a storm of broken and confused\ncheering.  The soldiers had almost reached their barracks; one man was\nraised on the shoulders of others, and surrounded by the rest of the\nregiment, waving their helmets, brandishing their rifles, and cheering\nwildly.\n\n\"It is the sergeant,\" said the Colonel.\n\n\"So I perceive,\" replied Sorrento bitterly.  \"A popular man, I suppose.\nHave you many non-commissioned officers like that?\"  The Colonel made\nno reply.  \"Gentlemen,\" said the War-Minister to the officers who\nloitered on the square, \"I would recommend you to go to your quarters.\nYou are rather tempting targets here, and I believe your regiment is a\nparticularly good shooting regiment.  Is it not, Colonel?\"\n\nWith which taunt he turned and rode away, sick at heart with anger and\nanxiety, while the officers of the 11th Regiment of Lauranian Infantry\nretired to their quarters to hide their shame and face their danger.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nSURPRISES.\n\nIt had been a busy and exciting day for Savrola.  He had seen his\nfollowers, had issued orders, restrained the impetuous, stimulated the\nweak, encouraged the timid.  All day long messages and reports had\nreached him about the behaviour of the soldiers.  The departure of the\nGuard, and the refusal of the supporting brigade to march, were equally\npleasing events.  The conspiracy had now been made known to so many\npersons that he doubted the possibility of keeping it much longer\nsecret from the Government agents.  From every consideration he felt\nthat the hour had come.  The whole of the elaborate plan that he had\ndevised had been put into execution.  The strain had been severe, but\nat length all the preparations were completed, and the whole strength\nof the Revolutionary party was concentrated for the final struggle.\nGodoy, Renos, and the others were collected at the Mayoralty, whence at\ndawn the Provisional Government was to be proclaimed.  Moret, to whom\nthe actual duty of calling the people to arms had been assigned,\ninstructed his agents at his own house and made arrangements for the\nposting of the proclamation.  All was ready.  The leader on whom\neverything depended, whose brain had conceived, whose heart had\ninspired, the great conspiracy, lay back in his chair.  He needed and\ndesired a few moments' rest and quiet reflection to review his schemes,\nto look for omissions, to brace his nerves.\n\nA small bright fire burned in the grate, and all around were the ashes\nof burnt papers.  For an hour he had been feeding the flames.  One\nphase of his life was over; there might be another, but it was well to\nhave done with this one first.  Letters from friends, dead now or\nalienated; letters of congratulation, of praise that had inspired his\nyounger ambitions; letters from brilliant men and some from beautiful\nwomen,--all had met a common fate.  Why should these records, be\npreserved for the curious eye of unsympathetic posterity?  If he\nperished, the world might forget him, and welcome; if he lived, his\nlife would henceforth be within the province of the historian.  A\nsingle note, preserved from the general destruction, lay on the table\nbeside him.  It was the one with which Lucile had accompanied her\ninvitation to the State Ball, the only one he had ever received from\nher.\n\nAs he balanced it in his fingers, his thoughts drifted away from the\nbusy hard realities of life to that kindred soul and lovely face.  That\nepisode too was over.  A barrier stood between them.  Whatever the\nresult of the revolt, she was lost to him, unless--and that terrible\nunless was pregnant with suggestions of such awful wickedness that his\nmind recoiled from it as a man's hand starts from some filthy thing he\nhas by inadvertence touched.  There were sins, sins against the\ncommonwealth of mankind, against the phenomenon of life itself, the\nstigma of which would cling through death, and for which there was\npardon only in annihilation.  Yet he hated Molara with a fierce hatred;\nnor did he care to longer hide from himself the reason.  And with the\nrecollection of the reason his mind reverted to a softer mood.  Would\nhe ever see her again?  Even the sound of her name pleased him;\n\"Lucile,\" he whispered sadly.\n\nThere was a quick step outside; the door opened, and she stood before\nhim.  He sprang up in mute astonishment.\n\nLucile looked greatly embarrassed.  Her mission was a delicate one.\nIndeed she did not know her own mind, or did not care to know it.  It\nwas for her husband's sake, she said to herself; but the words she\nspoke belied her.  \"I have come to tell you that I did not betray your\nsecret.\"\n\n\"I know,--I never feared,\" replied Savrola.\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I have not yet been arrested.\"\n\n\"No, but he suspects.\"\n\n\"Suspects what?\"\n\n\"That you are conspiring against the Republic.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Savrola, greatly relieved; \"he has no proofs.\"\n\n\"To-morrow he may have.\"\n\n\"To-morrow will be too late.\"\n\n\"Too late?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Savrola; \"the game begins to-night.\"  He took out his\nwatch; it was a quarter to eleven.\n\n\"At twelve o'clock you will hear the alarm-bells.  Sit down, and let us\ntalk.\"\n\nLucile sat down mechanically.\n\n\"You love me,\" he said in an even voice, looking at her\ndispassionately, and as if the whole subject of their relations was but\na psychological problem, \"and I love you.\"  There was no answer; he\ncontinued: \"But we must part.  In this world we are divided, nor do I\nsee how the barrier can be removed.  All my life I shall think of you;\nno other woman can ever fill the empty space.  Ambitions I still have:\nI always had them; but love I am not to know, or to know it only to my\nvexation and despair.  I will put it away from me, and henceforth my\naffections will be as lifeless as those burnt papers.  And you,--will\nyou forget?  In the next few hours I may be killed; if so, do not allow\nyourself to mourn.  I do not care to be remembered for what I was.  If\nI have done anything that may make the world more happy, more cheerful,\nmore comfortable, let them recall the action.  If I have spoken a\nthought which, rising above the vicissitudes of our existence, may make\nlife brighter or death less gloomy, then let them say, 'He said this or\nhe did that.'  Forget the man; remember, perhaps, his work.  Remember\ntoo that you have known a soul, somewhere amid the puzzles of the\nuniverse, the complement of your own; and then forget.  Summon your\nreligion to your aid; anticipate the moment of forgetting; live, and\nleave the past alone.  Can you do this?\"\n\n\"Never!\" she answered passionately.  \"I will never forget you!\"\n\n\"We are but poor philosophers,\" he said.  \"Pain and love make sport of\nus and all our theories.  We cannot conquer ourselves or rise above our\nstate.\"\n\n\"Why should we try?\" she whispered, looking at him with wild eyes.\n\nHe saw and trembled.  Then, with the surge of impulse, he cried, \"My\nGod, how I love you!\" and before she could frame a resolution or even\nchoose her mind, they had kissed each other.\n\nThe handle of the door turned quickly.  Both started back.  The door\nswung open and the President appeared.  He was in plain clothes, his\nright hand concealed behind his back.  Miguel followed from out of the\ndarkness of the passage.\n\nFor a moment there was silence.  Then Molara in a furious voice broke\nout: \"So, Sir, you attack me in this way also,--coward and scoundrel!\"\nHe raised his hand and pointed the revolver it held full at his enemy.\n\nLucile, feeling that the world had broken up, fell back against the\nsofa, stunned with terror.  Savrola rose and faced the President.  Then\nshe saw what a brave man he was, for as he did so he contrived to stand\nbetween the weapon and herself.  \"Put down your pistol,\" he said in a\nfirm voice; \"and you shall have an explanation.\"\n\n\"I will put it down,\" said Molara, \"when I have killed you.\"\n\nSavrola measured the distance between them with his eye.  Could he\nspring in under the shot?  Again he looked at the table where his own\nrevolver lay.  He shielded her, and he decided to stand still.\n\n\"Down on your knees and beg for mercy, you hound; down, or I will blow\nyour face in!\"\n\n\"I have always tried to despise death, and have always succeeded in\ndespising you.  I shall bow to neither.\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said Molara, grinding his teeth.  \"I shall count\nfive,--one!\"\n\nThere was a pause.  Savrola looked at the pistol barrel, a black spot\nencircled by a ring of bright steel; all the rest of the picture was a\nblank.\n\n\"Two!\" counted the President.\n\nSo he was to die,--flash off this earth when that black spot burst into\nflame.  He anticipated the blow full in his face; and beyond he saw\nnothing,--annihilation,--black, black night.\n\n\"Three!\"\n\nHe could just see the rifling of the barrel; the lands showed faintly.\nThat was a wonderful invention--to make the bullet spin as it\ntravelled.  He imagined it churning his brain with hideous energy.  He\ntried to think, to take one grip of his philosophy or faith before the\nplunge; but his physical sensations were too violent.  To the tips of\nhis fingers he tingled, as the blood surged through his veins; the\npalms of his hands felt hot.\n\n\"Four!\"\n\nLucile sprang up, and with a cry threw herself in front of the\nPresident \"Wait, wait!\" she cried.  \"Have mercy!\"\n\nMolara met her look, and in those eyes read more than terror.  Then at\nlast he understood; he started as though he had caught hold of red-hot\niron.  \"My God! it's true!\" he gasped.  \"Strumpet!\" he cried, as he\npushed her from him, striking her with the back of his left hand in the\nmouth.  She shrank into the far corner of the room.  He saw it all now.\nHoist with his own petard he had lost everything.  Wild fury took hold\nof him and shook him till his throat rattled and ached.  She had\ndeserted him; power was slipping from his grasp; his rival, his enemy,\nthe man he hated with all his soul was everywhere triumphant.  He had\nwalked into the trap only to steal the bait; but he should not escape.\nThere was a limit to prudence and to the love of life.  His plans, his\nhopes, the roar of an avenging crowd, all faded from his mind.  Death\nshould wipe out the long score that stood between them, death which\nsettled all,--now on the instant.  But he had been a soldier, and was\never a practical man in the detail of life.  He lowered the pistol and\ndeliberately cocked it; single action would make certainty more sure;\nthen he took good aim.\n\nSavrola, seeing that the moment was upon him, lowered his head and\nsprang forward.\n\nThe President fired.\n\nBut Miguel's quick intelligence had appreciated the changed situation,\nand he remembered that there were consequences.  He saw that the trick\nhad become deadly earnest, and he did not forget the mob.  He struck\nthe pistol up, and the bullet, by a very little, flew high.\n\nIn the smoke and the flash Savrola closed with his adversary and bore\nhim to the ground.  Molara fell underneath and with the concussion\ndropped the revolver.  The other seized it, wrenched himself clear, and\nsprang back and away from the prostrate figure.  For a moment he stood\nthere and watched, while the hungry lust of killing rose in his heart\nand made his trigger-finger itch.  Then very slowly the President rose.\nThe fall had dazed him; he leaned against the book-case and groaned.\n\nBelow there was a beating at the front door.  Molara turned towards\nLucile, who still cowered in the corner of the room, and began to\nrevile her.  The common, ugly material of his character showed through\nthe veneer and polish that varied intercourse and the conduct of great\naffairs had superimposed.  His words were not fit to hear, nor worth\nremembering; but they stung her to the quick and she rejoined\ndefiantly: \"You knew I was here; you told me to come!  You have laid a\ntrap; the fault is yours!\"  Molara replied by a filthy taunt.  \"I am\ninnocent,\" she cried; \"though I love him, I am innocent!  Why did you\ntell me to come here?\"\n\nSavrola began to perceive dimly.  \"I do not know,\" he said, \"what\nvillainy you have contrived.  I have wronged you too much to care to\nhave your blood on my head; but go, and go quickly; I will not endure\nyour foulness.  Go!\"\n\nThe President was now recovering his calmness.  \"I should have shot you\nmyself,\" he said, \"but I will have it done by a platoon of\nsoldiers,--five soldiers and a corporal.\"\n\n\"The murder will be avenged in either case.\"\n\n\"Why did you stop me, Miguel?\"\n\n\"It is as he says, Your Excellency,\" replied the Secretary.  \"It would\nhave been a tactical error.\"\n\nThe official manner, the style of address, the man's composure,\nrestored the President to his senses.  He walked towards the door and\nstopping at the sideboard helped himself to a glass of brandy with\nostentation.  \"Confiscated,\" he said, and held it up to the light, \"by\norder of the Government.\"  He swallowed it.  \"I will see you shot\nto-morrow,\" he added, heedless that the other held the pistol.\n\n\"I shall be at the Mayoralty,\" said Savrola; \"you may come and fetch me\nif you dare.\"\n\n\"Revolt!\" said the President.  \"Pooh!  I will stamp it out, and you\ntoo, before the sun has gone down.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there may be another ending to the tale.\"\n\n\"One or the other,\" said the President.  \"You have robbed me of my\nhonour; you are plotting to rob me of my power.  There is not room for\nboth of us in the world.  You may take your mistress with you to hell.\"\n\nThere was a noise of hasty footsteps on the stairs; Lieutenant Tiro\nflung open the door, but stopped abruptly in astonishment at the\noccupants of the room.  \"I heard a shot,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the President; \"there has been an accident, but luckily\nno harm was done.  Will you please accompany me to the palace?  Miguel,\ncome!\"\n\n\"You had better be quick, Sir,\" said the Subaltern.  \"There are many\nstrange folk about to-night, and they are building a barricade at the\nend of the street.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said the President.  \"It is time we took steps to stop them.\nGood-night, Sir,\" he added, turning to Savrola; \"we shall meet\nto-morrow and finish our discussion.\"\n\nBut Savrola, revolver in hand, looked at him steadily and let him go in\nsilence, a silence that for a space Lucile's sobs alone disturbed.  At\nlength, when the retreating footsteps had died away and the street door\nhad closed, she spoke.  \"I cannot stop here.\"\n\n\"You cannot go back to the palace.\"\n\n\"What am I to do, then?\"\n\nSavrola reflected.  \"You had better stay here for the present.  The\nhouse is at your disposal, and you will be alone.  I must go at once to\nthe Mayoralty; already I am late,--it is close on twelve,--the moment\napproaches.  Besides, Molara will send policemen, and I have duties to\ndischarge which I cannot avoid.  To-night the streets are too\ndangerous.  Perhaps I shall return in the morning.\"\n\nThe tragedy had stunned them both.  A bitter remorse filled Savrola's\nheart.  Her life was ruined,--was he the cause?  He could not say how\nfar he was guilty or innocent; but the sadness of it all was unaltered,\nno matter who might be at fault.  \"Good-bye,\" he said rising.  \"I must\ngo, though I leave my heart behind.  Much depends on me,--the lives of\nfriends, the liberties of a nation.\"\n\nAnd so he departed to play a great game in the face of all the world,\nto struggle for those ambitions which form the greater part of man's\ninterest in life; while she, a woman, miserable and now alone, had no\nresource but to wait.\n\nAnd then suddenly the bells began to ring all over the city with quick\nimpatient strokes.  There was the sound of a far-off bugle-call and a\ndull report,--the boom of an alarm-gun.  The tumult grew; the roll of a\ndrum beating the _assembly_ was heard at the end of the street;\nconfused shoutings and cries rose from many quarters.  At length one\nsound was heard which put an end to all doubts,--_tap_, _tap_, _tap_,\nlike the subdued slamming of many wooden boxes--the noise of distant\nmusketry.\n\nThe revolution had begun.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTHE PROGRESS OF THE REVOLT.\n\nMeanwhile the President and his two followers pursued their way through\nthe city.  Many people were moving about the streets, and here and\nthere dark figures gathered in groups.  The impression that great\nevents were impending grew; the very air was sultry and surcharged with\nwhisperings.  The barricade, which was being built outside Savrola's\nhouse, had convinced Molara that a rising was imminent; half a mile\nfrom the palace the way was blocked by another.  Three carts had been\nstopped and drawn across the street, and about fifty men were working\nsilently to strengthen the obstruction: some pulled up the flat\npaving-stones; others were carrying mattresses and boxes filled with\nearth from the adjacent houses; but they paid little attention to the\nPresident's party.  He turned up his collar and pressing his felt hat\nwell down on his face clambered over the barrier,--the significance of\nwhat he saw filling his mind; the Subaltern indeed in his undress\nuniform drew some curious looks, but no attempt was made to stop his\nprogress.  These men waited for the signal.\n\nAll this time Molara said not a word.  With the approach of danger he\nmade great efforts to regain his calmness, that he might have a clear\nhead to meet it; but for all his strength of will, his hatred of\nSavrola filled his mind to the exclusion of everything else.  As he\nreached the palace the revolt broke out all over the city.  Messenger\nafter messenger hurried up with evil news.  Some of the regiments had\nrefused to fire on the people; others were fraternising with them;\neverywhere barricades grew and the approaches to the palace were on all\nsides being closed.  The Revolutionary leaders had gathered at the\nMayoralty.  The streets were placarded with the Proclamation of the\nProvisional Government.  Officers from various parts of the town\nhastened to the palace; some were wounded, many agitated.  Among them\nwas Sorrento, who brought the terrible news that an entire battery of\nartillery had surrendered their guns to the rebels.  By half-past three\nit was evident, from the reports which were received by telegram and\nmessenger, that the greater part of the city had passed into the hands\nof the Revolutionaries with very little actual fighting.\n\nThe President bore all with a calmness which revealed the full strength\nof his hard, stern character.  He had, in truth, a terrible stimulant.\nBeyond the barricades and the rebels who lined them was the Mayoralty\nand Savrola.  The face and figure of his enemy was before his eyes;\neverything else seemed of little importance.  Yet he found in the\nblinding emergency an outlet for his fury, a counter-irritant for his\ngrief; to crush the revolt, but above all to kill Savrola, was his\nheart's desire.\n\n\"We must wait for daylight,\" he said.\n\n\"And what then, Sir?\" asked the War-Minister.\n\n\"We will then proceed to the Mayoralty and arrest the leaders of this\ndisturbance.\"\n\nThe rest of the night was spent in organising a force with which to\nmove at dawn.  A few hundred faithful soldiers (men who had served with\nMolara in the former war), seventy officers of the regular army, whose\nloyalty was unquestionable, and the remaining battalion of the Guard\nwith a detachment of armed police, were alone available.  This band of\ndevoted men, under fourteen hundred in number, collected in the open\nspace in front of the palace-gates, and guarded the approaches while\nthey waited for sunrise.\n\nThey were not attacked.  \"Secure the city,\" had been Savrola's order,\nand the rebels were busily at work on the barricades, which in a\nregular system rose on all sides.  Messages of varied import continued\nto reach the President.  Louvet, in a hurried note, expressed his\nhorror at the revolt, and explained how much he regretted being unable\nto join the President at the palace.  He had to leave the city in great\nhaste, he said; a relative was dangerously ill.  He adjured Molara to\ntrust in Providence; for his part he was confident that the\nRevolutionaries would be suppressed.\n\nThe President in his room read this with a dry, hard laugh.  He had\nnever put the slightest faith in Louvet's courage, having always\nrealised that in a crisis he would be useless and a coward.  He did not\nblame him; the man had his good points, and as a public official in the\nHome-Office he was admirable; but war was not his province.\n\nHe passed the letter to Miguel.  The Secretary read it and reflected.\nHe also was no soldier.  It was evident that the game was up, and there\nwas no need for him to throw his life away, merely out of sentiment as\nhe said to himself.  He thought of the part he had played in the drama\nof the night.  That surely gave him some claims; it would be possible\nat least to hedge.  He took a fresh piece of paper and began to write.\nMolara paced the room.  \"What are you writing?\" he asked.\n\n\"An order to the Commandant of the harbour-forts,\" replied Miguel\npromptly, \"to acquaint him with the situation and tell him to hold his\nposts in your name at all hazards.\"\n\n\"It is needless,\" said Molara; \"either his men are traitors or they are\nnot.\"\n\n\"I have told him,\" said Miguel quickly, \"to make a demonstration\ntowards the palace at dawn, if he can trust his men.  It will create a\ndiversion.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Molara wearily; \"but I doubt it ever reaching him,\nand he has so few men that could be spared after the forts are held\nadequately.\"\n\nAn orderly entered with a telegram.  The clerk at the office, a\nloyalist, an unknown man of honour, had brought it himself, passing the\nline of barricades with extraordinary good-fortune and courage.  While\nthe President tore the envelope open, Miguel rose and left the room.\nOutside in the brilliantly lighted passage he found a servant,\nterrified but not incapable.  He spoke to the man quickly and in a low\nvoice; _twenty pounds, the Mayoralty, at all costs_, were the\nessentials of his instructions.  Then he re-entered the office.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Molara; \"it is not all over yet.\"  The telegram was\nfrom Brienz, near Lorenzo: _Clear the line.  Strelitz and force two\nthousand rebels advanced on the Black Gorge this afternoon.  I have\nrepulsed them with heavy loss.  Strelitz is prisoner.  Am pursuing\nremainder.  I await instructions at Turga_.  \"This must be published at\nonce,\" he said.  \"Get a thousand copies printed, and have them\ncirculated among the loyalists and as far as possible in the city.\"\n\nThe news of the victory was received with cheers by the troops gathered\nin the palace-square, and they waited with impatience for morning.  At\nlength the light of day began to grow in the sky, and other lights, the\nglow of distant conflagrations, paled.  The President, followed by\nSorrento, a few officers of high rank, and his aide-de-camp Tiro,\ndescended the steps, traversed the courtyard and passing through the\ngreat gates of the palace, entered the square where the last reserves\nof his power were assembled.  He walked about and shook hands right and\nleft with these faithful friends and supporters.  Presently his eye\ncaught sight of the rebel proclamation which some daring hand had\nplaced on the wall under cover of the darkness.  He walked up and read\nit by the light of a lantern.  Savrola's style was not easy to mistake.\nThe short crisp sentences of the appeal to the people to take up arms\nrang like a trumpet-call.  Across the placard a small red slip, such as\nare used on theatrical advertisements to show the time of the\nperformance, had been posted at a later hour.  It purported to be the\n_facsimile_ of a telegram and ran thus: _Forced Black Gorge this\nmorning.  Dictator's troops in full retreat.  Am marching on Lorenzo.\nStrelitz._\n\nMolara quivered with fury.  Savrola did not neglect details, and threw\nfew chances away.  \"Infamous liar!\" was the President's comment; but he\nrealised the power of the man he sought to crush, and for a moment\ndespair welled in his heart and seemed to chill his veins.  He shook\nthe sensation off with a great effort.\n\nThe officers were already in possession of the details of the plan,\nwhose boldness was its main recommendation.  The rebels had succeeded\nin launching their enterprise; the Government would reply by a _coup\nd'\u00c3\u00a9tat_.  In any case the stroke was aimed at the heart of the revolt,\nand if it went home the results would be decisive.  \"The octopus of\nRebellion, Gentlemen,\" said the President to those around him, and\npointing to the Revolutionary proclamation, \"has long arms.  It will be\nnecessary to cut off his head.\"  And though all felt the venture to be\ndesperate, they were brave men and knew their minds.\n\nThe distance from the palace to the Mayoralty was nearly a mile and a\nhalf along a broad but winding avenue; by this avenue, and by the\nnarrower streets on either side, the force advanced silently in three\ndivisions.  The President marched on foot with the centre column;\nSorrento took command of the left, which was the threatened flank.\nSlowly, and with frequent halts to keep up communication with each\nother, the troops marched along the silent streets.  Not a soul was to\nbe seen: all the shutters of the houses were closed, all the doors\nfastened; and though the sky grew gradually brighter in the East, the\ncity was still plunged in gloom.  The advanced files pressed forward up\nthe avenue, running from tree to tree, and pausing cautiously at each\nto peer through the darkness.  Suddenly as they rounded a bend, a shot\nrang out in front.  \"Forward!\" cried the President.  The bugles sounded\nthe charge and the drums beat.  In the dim light the outline of a\nbarricade was visible two hundred yards off, a dark obstruction across\nthe roadway.  The soldiers shouted and broke into a run.  The defenders\nof the barricade, surprised, opened an ineffective fire and then,\nseeing that the attack was in earnest and doubtful of its strength,\nbeat a retreat while time remained.  The barricade was captured in a\nmoment, and the assailants pressed on elated by success.  Behind the\nbarricade was a cross street, right and left.  Firing broke out\neverywhere, and the loud noise of the rifles echoed from the walls of\nthe houses.  The flanking columns had been sharply checked at their\nbarricades, but the capture of the centre position turned both of\nthese, and their defenders, fearing to be cut off, fled in disorder.\n\nIt was now daylight, and the scene in the streets was a strange one.\nThe skirmishers darted between the trees, and the little blue-white\npuffs of smoke spotted the whole picture.  The retiring rebels left\ntheir wounded on the ground, and these the soldiers bayoneted savagely.\nShots were fired from the windows of the houses and from any shelter\nthat offered,--a lamp-post, a pillar-box, a wounded man, an overturned\ncab.  The rifle-fire was searching, and the streets were very bare.  In\ntheir desire to get cover, to get behind something, both sides broke\ninto the houses and dragged out chairs, tables, and piles of bedding;\nand though these were but little protection from the bullets, men felt\nless naked behind them.\n\nAll this time the troops were steadily advancing, though suffering\ncontinual loss; but gradually the fire of the rebels grew hotter.  More\nmen were hurried to the scene each moment; the pressure on the flanks\nbecame severe; the enveloping enemy pressed in down the side streets,\nto hold which the scanty force at the President's disposal had to be\nfurther weakened.  At length the rebels ceased to retreat; they had\nreached their guns, four of which were arranged in a row across the\navenue.\n\nThe Mayoralty was now but a quarter of a mile away, and Molara called\non his soldiers for a supreme effort.  A dashing attempt to carry the\nguns with the bayonet was defeated with a loss of thirty killed and\nwounded, and the Government troops took shelter in a side street at\nright angles to the main avenue.  This in turn was enfiladed by the\nenemy, who swept round the columns and began to cut in on their line of\nretreat.\n\nFiring was now general along a wide half-circle.  In the hope of\ndriving the improvised artillery-men from their places, the troops\nforced their way into the houses on either side of the avenue, and\nclimbing along the roofs began to fire down on their adversaries.  But\nthe rebels, repeating the manoeuvre, met them and the attempt dwindled\ninto desperate but purposeless fighting among the chimney-pots and the\nskylights.\n\nThe President exposed himself manfully.  Moving from one part of the\nforce to another, he animated his followers by his example.  Tiro, who\nkept close to him, had seen enough war to realise that the check was\nfatal to their chances.  Every moment was precious; time was slipping\naway, and the little force was already almost completely encircled.  He\nhad taken a rifle and was assisting to burst in the door of a house,\nwhen to his astonishment he saw Miguel.  The Secretary was armed.  He\nhad hitherto remained carefully in the rear, and had avoided the danger\nin the air by hiding behind the trees of the avenue; but now he\nadvanced boldly to the doorway and began to help in battering it down.\nNo sooner was this done than he darted in and ran up the stairs crying\nout, \"We are all soldiers to-day!\"  Several infantrymen followed him to\nfire from the lowest windows, but Tiro could not leave the President;\nhe felt, however, surprised and pleased by Miguel's gallantry.\n\nIt soon became evident to all that the attempt had failed.  The numbers\nagainst them were too great.  A third of the force had been killed or\nwounded, when the order to cut their way back to the palace was given.\nOn all sides the exulting enemy pressed fiercely.  Isolated parties of\nsoldiers, cut off from the retiring column, defended themselves\ndesperately in the houses and on the roofs.  They were nearly all\nkilled eventually, for everyone's blood was up, and it was a waste of\ntime to ask for quarter.  Others set fire to the houses and tried to\nescape under cover of the smoke; but very few succeeded.  Others again,\nand among them Miguel, lay hid in closets and cellars, from which they\nemerged when men's tempers were again human and _surrender_ was not an\nunknown word.  The right column, which consisted of five companies of\nthe Guard battalion, were completely surrounded, and laid down their\narms on the promise of a rebel general that their lives should be\nspared.  The promise was kept, and it appeared that the superior\nofficers among the Revolutionists were making great efforts to restrain\nthe fury of their followers.\n\nThe main body of the Government troops, massed in a single column,\nstruggled on towards the palace losing men at every step.  But in spite\nof their losses, they were dangerous people to stop.  One party of\nrebels, who intercepted their line of retreat, was swept away in a\nsavage charge, and some attempt was made to reform; but the rifle-fire\nwas pitiless and incessant, and eventually the retreat became a rout.\nA bloody pursuit followed in which only some eighty men escaped capture\nor death, and with the President and Sorrento regained the palace\nalive.  The great gates were closed, and the slender garrison prepared\nto defend themselves to the last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nTHE DEFENCE OF THE PALACE.\n\n\"That,\" said Lieutenant Tiro to a Captain of Artillery, as they got\ninside the gate, \"is about the best I've seen so far.\"\n\n\"I thought it was a bad business all through,\" replied the other; \"and\nwhen they brought the guns up it was a certainty.\"\n\n\"It wasn't the guns that did us,\" said the Lancer Subaltern, who had no\nexaggerated idea of the value of artillery; \"we wanted some cavalry.\"\n\n\"We wanted more men,\" answered the Gunner, not anxious at that moment\nto argue the relative values of the different arms.  \"These rear-guard\nactions are the devil.\"\n\n\"There was a damned sight more action than there was rear-guard about\nthat last bit,\" said Tiro.  \"Do you suppose they cut up the wounded?\"\n\n\"Every one of them, I should think; they were like wolves at the end.\"\n\n\"What's going to happen now?\"\n\n\"They're going to come in here and finish us off.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that,\" said Tiro.  His cheery courage could stand a\nprolonged test.  \"The fleet will be back soon; we shall hold this place\ntill then.\"\n\nThe palace was indeed not unsuited to defence.  It was solidly built of\nstone.  The windows were at some distance from the ground and the lower\nstrongly barred, except on the garden-side, where the terrace and its\nsteps gave access to the long French windows.  But it was evident that\na few good rifles could forbid the bare and narrow approaches in that\nquarter.  Indeed it seemed as though the architect must have\ncontemplated the occasion that had now arrived, for he had almost built\na stronghold disguised as a palace.  The side which faced the square\nseemed to afford the best prospects to an assault; yet the great gate\nwas protected by two small towers containing guard-rooms, and the wall\nof the courtyard was high and thick.  As it seemed, however, that on\nthis front the enemy would be able to use their numbers to the greatest\neffect, the majority of the little garrison were concentrated there.\n\nThe rebels were wisely and cautiously led.  They did not at once push\non to the attack of the palace; sure of their prey they could afford to\nwait.  Meanwhile the surviving adherents of the Government endeavoured\nto make their last foothold secure.  Rough-hewn cobblestones from the\npavements of the courtyard were prized up, and the windows were with\nthese converted into loopholes through which the garrison might fire\nwithout much exposure.  The gates were closed and barred, and\npreparations made to strut them with baulks of timber.  Ammunition was\ndistributed.  The duty and responsibility of each section of the\ndefence was apportioned to the various officers.  The defenders\nrecognised that they had entered on a quarrel which must be carried to\na definite conclusion.\n\nBut Molara's mood had changed.  The fury of the night had cooled into\nthe hard, savage courage of the morning.  He had led the desperate\nattempt to capture the Mayoralty, and had exposed himself freely and\neven recklessly in the tumult of the fight that followed; but now that\nhe had come through unhurt, had regained the palace, and realised that\nhis last chance of killing Savrola had passed, death appeared very\nugly.  All the excitement which had supported him had died away; he had\nhad enough.  His mind searched for some way of escape, and searched\nvainly.  The torture of the moment was keen.  A few hours might bring\nhelp: the fleet would surely come; but it would be too late.  The great\nguns might take vengeance for his death; they could not save his life.\nA feeling of vexation shook him, and behind it grew the realisation of\nthe approaching darkness.  Terror began to touch his heart; his nerve\nflickered; he had more to fear than the others.  The hatred of the\nmultitude was centred in him; after all it was his blood they\nwanted,--his above all others.  It was a dreadful distinction.  He\nretired in deep despondency to his own room, and took no part in the\ndefence.\n\nAt about eleven o'clock the sharpshooters of the enemy began to make\ntheir way into the houses which surrounded the front of the palace.\nPresently from an upper window a shot was fired; others followed, and\nsoon a regular fusilade began.  The defenders, sheltered by their\nwalls, replied carefully.  Lieutenant Tiro and a sergeant of the\nGuards, an old war-time comrade of Molara's, were holding the window of\nthe guard-room on the left of the great gate.  Both were good shots.\nThe Subaltern had filled his pockets with cartridges; the Sergeant\narranged his on the sill in neat little rows of five.  From their\nposition they could shoot right down the street which led into the\nsquare and towards the gate.  Outside the guard-room a dozen officers\nand men were still engaged in making the entrance more secure.  They\ntried to wedge a great plank between the ground and the second\ncross-piece; should the rebels try to rush the gate-way, it would thus\nbe strong enough to resist them.\n\nThe fire from the surrounding houses was annoying rather than\ndangerous, but several bullets struck the stones of the improvised\nloopholes.  The garrison fired carefully and slowly, anxious not to\nexpend their ammunition, or to expose themselves without a result.\nSuddenly, about three hundred yards away, a number of men turned into\nthe street which led to the gate, and began rapidly pushing and pulling\nsomething forward.\n\n\"Look out,\" cried Tiro to the working-party; \"they're bringing up a\ngun;\" and taking good aim he fired at the approaching enemy.  The\nSergeant, and all the other defenders of this side of the palace, fired\ntoo with strange energy.  The advancing crowd slackened speed.  Among\nthem men began to drop.  Several in front threw up their hands; others\nbegan carrying these away.  The attack dwindled.  Then two or three men\nran back alone.  At that all the rest turned tail and scurried for the\ncover of the side street, leaving the gun (one of the captured\ntwelve-pounders) standing deserted in the middle of the roadway, with\nabout a dozen shapeless black objects lying round it.\n\nThe garrison raised a cheer, which was answered from the surrounding\nhouses by an increase of musketry.\n\nA quarter of an hour passed and then the rebels debouched from the side\nstreets into the main approach and began pushing up four carts filled\nwith sacks of flour.  Again the defenders fired rapidly.  Their\nbullets, striking the sacks, raised strange creamy white clouds; but\nthe assailants, sheltered by their movable cover, continued to advance\nsteadily.  They reached the gun, and began emptying the carts by\npushing the sacks out from behind, until a regular breastwork was\nformed, behind which they knelt down.  Some began firing; others\ndevoted their efforts to discharging the gun, on which the aim of the\ngarrison was now directed.  With a loss of two men they succeeded in\nloading it and pointing it at the gate.  A third man advanced to fix\nthe friction-tube by which it was fired.\n\nTiro took steady aim and the distant figure collapsed to the shot.\n\n\"Bull's eye,\" said the Sergeant appreciatively, and leaned forward to\nfire at another, who had advanced with desperate bravery to discharge\nthe piece.  He paused long on his aim, wishing to make certain; holding\nhis breath he began gently to squeeze the trigger, as the\nmusketry-books enjoin.  Suddenly there was a very strange sound, half\nthud, half smash.  Tiro, shrinking swiftly to the left, just avoided\nbeing splashed with blood and other physical details.  The Sergeant had\nbeen killed by a bullet which had come to meet him as he looked through\nhis loophole.  The distant man had fixed his tube, and, catching up the\nlanyard, stood back and aside to fire.\n\n\"Stand from the gate,\" shouted Tiro to the working-party; \"I can't hold\n'em!\"  He raised his rifle and fired on the chance.  At the same\ninstant a great cloud of smoke burst from the gun and another sprang up\nat the palace gate.  The woodwork was smashed to pieces and, with the\nsplinters of the shell, flew on, overtaking with death and wounds the\nworking-party as they scampered to cover.\n\nA long loud burst of cheering arose on all sides from the surrounding\nhouses and streets, and was taken up by the thousands who were waiting\nbehind and heard the explosion of the gun.  At first the rebel fire\nincreased, but very soon a bugler began to sound perseveringly, and\nafter about twenty minutes the musketry ceased altogether.  Then from\nover the barricade a man with a white flag advanced, followed by two\nothers.  The truce was acknowledged from the palace by the waving of a\nhandkerchief.  The deputation walked straight up to the shattered\ngateway, and their leader, stepping through, entered the courtyard.\nMany of the defenders left their stations to look at him and hear what\nterms were offered.  It was Moret.\n\n\"I call upon you all to surrender,\" he said.  \"Your lives will be\nspared until you have been fairly tried.\"\n\n\"Address yourself to me, Sir,\" said Sorrento stepping forward; \"I am in\ncommand here.\"\n\n\"I call upon you all to surrender in the name of the Republic,\"\nrepeated Moret loudly.\n\n\"I forbid you to address these soldiers,\" said Sorrento.  \"If you do so\nagain, your flag shall not protect you.\"\n\nMoret turned to him.  \"Resistance is useless,\" he said.  \"Why will you\ncause further loss of life?  Surrender, and your lives shall be safe.\"\n\nSorrento reflected.  Perhaps the rebels knew that the fleet was\napproaching; otherwise, he thought they would not offer terms.  It was\nnecessary to gain time.  \"We shall require two hours fro consider the\nterms,\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" answered Moret decidedly.  \"You must surrender at once, here and\nnow.\"\n\n\"We shall do no such thing,\" replied the War-Minister.  \"The palace is\ndefensible.  We shall hold it until the return of the fleet and of the\nvictorious field-army.\"\n\n\"You refuse all terms?\"\n\n\"We refuse all you have offered.\"\n\n\"Soldiers,\" said Moret turning again to the men, \"I implore you not to\nthrow away your lives.  I offer fair terms; do not reject them.\"\n\n\"Young man,\" said Sorrento with rising anger, \"I have a somewhat\nlengthy score to settle with you already.  You are a civilian and are\nignorant of the customs of war.  It is my duty to warn you that, if you\ncontinue to attempt to seduce the loyalty of the Government troops, I\nshall fire at you.\"  He drew his revolver.\n\nMoret should have heeded; but tactless, brave, and impulsive as he was,\nhe recked little.  His warm heart generously hoped to save further loss\nof life.  Besides, he did not believe that Sorrento would shoot him in\ncold blood; it would be too merciless.  \"I offer you all life,\" he\ncried; \"do not choose death.\"\n\nSorrento raised his pistol and fired.  Moret fell to the ground, and\nhis blood began to trickle over the white flag.  For a moment he\ntwisted and quivered, and then lay still.  There were horrified murmurs\nfrom the bystanders, who had not expected to see the threat carried\nout.  But it is not well to count on the mercy of such men as this\nWar-Minister; they live their lives too much by rule and regulation.\n\nThe two men outside the gate, hearing the shot, looked in, saw, and ran\nswiftly back to their comrades, while the garrison, feeling that they\nmust now abandon all hope, returned to their posts slowly and sullenly.\nThe report of a truce had drawn the President from his room, with a\nfresh prospect of life, and perhaps of vengeance, opening on his\nimagination.  As he came down the steps into the courtyard, the shot,\nin such close proximity, startled him; when he saw the condition of the\nbearer of terms, he staggered.  \"Good God!\" he said to Sorrento, \"what\nhave you done?\"\n\n\"I have shot a rebel, Sir,\" replied the War-Minister, his heart full of\nmisgivings, but trying to brazen it out, \"for inciting the troops to\nmutiny and desertion, after due warning that his flag would no longer\nprotect him.\"\n\nMolara quivered from head to foot; he felt the last retreat cut off.\n\"You have condemned us all to death,\" he said.  Then he stooped and\ndrew a paper which protruded from the dead man's coat.  It ran as\nfollows: _I authorise you to accept the surrender of Antonio Molara,\nex-President of the Republic, and of such officers, soldiers, and\nadherents as may be holding the Presidential Palace.  Their lives are\nto be spared, and they shall be protected pending the decision of the\nGovernment.  For the Council of Public Safety_,--SAVROLA.  And Sorrento\nhad killed him,--the only man who could save them from the fury of the\ncrowd.  Too sick at heart to speak Molara turned away, and as he did so\nthe firing from the houses of the square recommenced with savage\nvigour.  The besiegers knew now how their messenger had fared.\n\nAnd all the while Moret lay very still out there in the courtyard.  All\nhis ambitions, his enthusiasms, his hopes had come to a full stop; his\nshare in the world's affairs was over; he had sunk into the ocean of\nthe past, and left scarcely a bubble behind.  In all the contriving of\nthe plot against the Lauranian Government Savrola's personality had\ndwarfed his.  Yet this was a man of heart and brain and nerve, one who\nmight have accomplished much; and he had a mother and two young sisters\nwho loved the soil he trod on, and thought him the finest fellow in the\nworld.\n\nSorrento stood viewing his handiwork for a long time, with a growing\nsense of dissatisfaction at his deed.  His sour, hard nature was\nincapable of genuine remorse, but he had known Molara for many years\nand was shocked to see his pain, and annoyed to think that he was the\ncause.  He had not realised that the President wished to surrender;\notherwise, he said to himself, he might have been more lenient.  Was\nthere no possible way of repairing the harm?  The man who had\nauthorised Moret to accept their surrender had power with the crowd; he\nwould be at the Mayoralty,--he must be sent for,--but how?\n\nLieutenant Tiro approached with a coat in his hands.  Disgusted at his\nsuperior's brutality, he was determined to express his feelings,\nclearly if not verbally.  He bent over the body and composed the limbs;\nthen he laid the coat over the white expressionless face, and rising\nsaid insolently to the Colonel: \"I wonder if they'll do that for you in\na couple of hours' time, Sir.\"\n\nSorrento looked at him, and laughed harshly.  \"Pooh!  What do I care?\nWhen you have seen as much fighting as I have, you will not be so\nsqueamish.\"\n\n\"I am not likely to see much more, now that you have killed the only\nman who could accept our surrender.\"\n\n\"There is another,\" said the War-Minister, \"Savrola.  If you want to\nlive, go and bring him to call off his hounds.\"\n\nSorrento spoke bitterly, but his words set the Subaltern's mind\nworking.  Savrola,--he knew him, liked him, and felt they had something\nin common.  Such a one would come if he were summoned; but to leave the\npalace seemed impossible.  Although the attacks of the rebels had been\ndirected against the side of the main entrance only, a close investment\nand a dropping musketry were maintained throughout the complete circle.\nTo pass the line of besiegers by the roads was out of the question.\nTiro thought of the remaining alternatives: a tunnel, that did not\nexist; a balloon, there was not one.  Shaking his head at the hopeless\nproblem he gazed contemplatively into the clear air, thinking to\nhimself: \"It would take a bird to do it.\"\n\nThe palace was connected with the Senate-House and with the principal\nPublic Offices by telephone, and it happened that the main line of\nwires from the eastern end of the great city passed across its roof.\nTiro, looking up, saw the slender threads overhead; there seemed to be\nnearly twenty of them.  The War-Minister followed his gaze.  \"Could you\nget along the wires?\" he asked eagerly.\n\n\"I will try,\" answered the Subaltern, thrilled with the idea.\n\nSorrento would have shaken his hand, but the boy stepped backward and\nsaluting turned away.  He entered the palace, and ascended the stairs\nwhich led to the flat roof.  The attempt was daring and dangerous.\nWhat if the rebels should see him in mid air?  He had often shot with a\npea-rifle at rooks, black spots against the sky and among the branches.\nThe thought seemed strangely disagreeable; but he consoled himself with\nthe reflection that men who look through loopholes at the peril of\ntheir lives have little leisure for aught but aiming, and rarely let\ntheir eyes wander idly.  He stepped out on to the roof and walked to\nthe telegraph-post.  There was no doubt as to its strength;\nnevertheless he paused, for the chances against him were great, and\ndeath seemed near and terrible.  His religion, like that of many\nsoldiers, was of little help; it was merely a jumble of formulas,\nseldom repeated, hardly understood, never investigated, and a hopeful,\nbut unauthorised, belief that it would be well with him if he did his\nduty like a gentleman.  He had no philosophy; he felt only that he was\nrisking all that he had, and for what he was uncertain.  Still, though\nthere were gaps in his reasoning, he thought it might be done and he\nwould have a dash for it.  He said to himself, \"It will score off those\nswine,\" and with this inspiring reflection he dismissed his fears.\n\nHe swarmed up the pole to the lowest wire; then he pulled himself\nhigher until he could get his foot on the insulators.  The wires ran on\nboth sides of the pole in two sets.  He stood on the two lowest, took\nthe top ones under his arms, and, reaching down over, caught one more\nin each hand.  Then he started, shuffling awkwardly along.  The span\nwas about seventy yards.  As he cleared the parapet he saw the street\nbeneath him,--very far beneath him, it seemed.  Shots were continually\nexchanged from the windows of the houses and the palace.  Sixty feet\nbelow a dead man lay staring up through the wires undazzled by the\nbright sun.  He had been _under_ fire before, but this was a novel\nexperience.  As he approached the middle of the span the wires began to\nswing, and he had to hold on tightly.  At first the slope had been on\nhis side, but after the centre was passed it rose against him; his feet\nslipped often backwards, and the wires commenced to cut into his\narmpits.\n\nTwo-thirds of the distance was safely accomplished, when the wires\nunder his left foot parted with a snap and dropped like a whip-lash\nagainst the wall of the opposite house.  His weight fell on his\nshoulders; the pain was sharp; he twisted,--slipped,--clutched wildly,\nand recovered himself by a tremendous effort.\n\nA man at a lower window pulled back the mattress behind which he was\nfiring and thrust his head and shoulders out.  Tiro looked down and\ntheir eyes met.  The man shouted in mad excitement, and fired his rifle\npoint-blank at the Subaltern.  The noise of the report prevented him\nfrom knowing how near the bullet had passed; but he felt he was not\nshot, and struggled on till he had passed the street.\n\nIt was all up; yet to turn back was equally fatal.  \"I'll see it out,\"\nhe said to himself, and dropped from the wires on to the roof of the\nhouse.  The door from the leads was open.  Running down the attic\nstairs and emerging on the landing, he peered over the bannisters; no\none was to be seen.  He descended the narrow staircase cautiously,\nwondering where his enemy could be.  Presently he was opposite the\nfront room on the second floor.  Keeping close to the wall he peered\nin.  The room was half-darkened.  The windows were blocked by boxes,\nportmanteaus, mattresses, and pillow-cases filled with earth; broken\nglass, mingled with bits of plaster from the walls, littered the floor.\nBy the light which filtered in through the chinks and loopholes, he saw\na strange scene.  There were four men in the room; one on his back on\nthe ground, and the others bending over him.  Their rifles were leaned\nagainst the wall.  They seemed to have eyes only for their comrade who\nlay on the floor in an ever-widening pool of blood, gurgling, choking,\nand apparently making tremendous efforts to speak.\n\nThe Subaltern had seen enough.  Opposite the front room was a doorway\ncovered by a curtain, behind which he glided.  Nothing was to be seen,\nbut he listened intently.\n\n\"Poor chap,\" said a voice, \"he's got it real bad.\"\n\n\"How did it happen?\" asked another.\n\n\"Oh, he leaned out of the window to have a shot,--bullet hit\nhim,--right through the lungs, I think,--fired in the air, and\nshouted.\"  Then in a lower but still audible tone he added, \"Done for!\"\n\nThe wounded man began making extraordinary noises.\n\n\"Su'thin' he wants to tell 'is pore wife before he goes,\" said one of\nthe Revolutionaries, who seemed by his speech a workman.  \"What is it,\nmate?\"\n\n\"Give him a pencil and paper; he can't speak.\"\n\nTiro's heart stood still, and his hand stole back for his revolver.\n\nFor nearly a minute nothing audible happened; then there was a shout.\n\n\"By God, we'll cop him!\" said the workman, and all three of them\nstamped past the curtained door and ran up-stairs.  One man paused just\nopposite; he was loading his rifle and the cartridge stuck; he banged\nit on the ground, apparently with success, for the Subaltern heard the\nbolt click, and the swift footsteps followed the others towards the\nroof.\n\nThen he emerged from his hiding-place and stole downwards.  But as he\npassed the open room he could not resist looking in.  The wounded man\nsaw him in an instant.  He half raised himself from the ground and made\nterrible efforts to shout; but no articulate sound came forth.  Tiro\nlooked for a moment at this stranger whom chance had made his\nimplacable enemy, and then, at the prompting of that cruel devil that\nlurks in the hearts of men and is awakened by bloodshed and danger, he\nkissed his hand to him in savage, bitter mockery.  The other sank\nbackwards in a paroxysm of pain and fury and lay gasping on the floor.\nThe Subaltern hurried away.  Reaching the lowest storey he turned into\nthe kitchen, where the window was but six feet from the ground.\nVaulting on to the sill he dropped into the backyard, and then, with a\nsudden feeling of wild panic, began to run at top speed,--the terror\nthat springs from returning hope hard on his track.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nFROM A WINDOW.\n\nWhile the swift succession of great events in the Lauranian capital had\noccupied with immediate emergency the minds of the men, it had been\ndifferent with the women.  Out in the streets there had been vivid\nscenes, hot blood, and excitement.  The dangers of war, and the\noccasion of close and involved fighting, had given many opportunities\nfor acts of devotion and brutality.  The brave man had displayed his\ncourage; the cruel had indulged his savagery; all the intermediate\ntypes had been thrilled with the business of the moment, and there had\nscarce been time for any but involuntary terror.  Within the houses it\nwas different.\n\nLucile started up at the first sound of firing.  There was not much to\nhear, a distant and confused popping with an occasional ragged crash;\nbut she knew what all this meant and shuddered.  The street below\nseemed from the noise to be full of people.  She rose and going to the\nwindow looked down.  By the sickly, uncertain light of the gas-lamps\nmen were working busily at a barricade, which ran across the street\nabout twenty yards from the door and on the side towards the palace.\nShe watched the bustling figures with strange interest.  They\ndistracted her thoughts and she felt that if she had nothing to look at\nshe would go mad with the dreadful suspense.  Not a detail escaped her.\n\nHow hard they worked!  Men with crowbars and pickaxes were prizing up\nthe paving-stones; others carried them along, staggering under their\nweight; others again piled them into a strong wall across the road.\nThere were two or three boys working away as hard as any of them.  One\nlittle fellow dropped the stone he was carrying on his foot, and\nforthwith sat down to cry bitterly.  His companion came up and kicked\nhim to stimulate his efforts, but he only cried the more.  Presently a\nwater-cart arrived, and the thirsty builders went by threes and fours\nto drink, dipping two tin mugs and a gallipot in the water.\n\nThe people in the houses round were made to open their doors, and the\nrebels unceremoniously dragged out all sorts of things to put on their\nbarricade.  One party discovered several barrels which they appeared to\nconsider a valuable prize.  Knocking in the end of one cask they began\nfilling it, spadeful by spadeful, with the earth which the removal of\nthe pavement had laid bare.  It was a long business, but at last they\nfinished and tried to lift the barrel on to the wall; but it was too\nheavy, and falling with a crash to the ground it broke all in pieces.\nAt this they were furious and disputed angrily, till an officer with a\nred sash came up and silenced them.  They did not attempt to fill the\nother casks, but re-entering the house brought out a comfortable sofa\nand sat down on it sullenly, lighting their pipes.  One by one,\nhowever, they got to work again, coming out of their sulky fit by\ndegrees, and careful of their dignity.  And all this time the barricade\ngrew steadily.\n\nLucile wondered why no one had entered Savrola's house.  Presently she\nperceived the reason; there was a picket of four men with rifles on the\ndoorstep.  Nothing had been forgotten by that comprehensive mind.  So\nthe hours passed.  From time to time her thoughts reverted to the\ntragedy which had swept upon her life, and she would sink back on to\nthe sofa in despair.  Once, from sheer weariness, she dozed for an\nhour.  The distant firing had died away and, though single shots were\noccasionally heard, the city was generally silent.  Waking with a\nstrange feeling of uneasy trouble she ran again to the window.  The\nbarricade was completed now, and the builders were lying down behind\nit.  Their weapons leaned against the wall on which two or three\nwatchers stood, looking constantly up the street.\n\nPresently there was a hammering at the street-door, which made her\nheart beat with fear.  She leaned cautiously out of the window.  The\npicket was still at its post, but another man had joined them.  Finding\nthat he could not obtain an answer to his knocking, he stooped down,\npushed something under the door, and went his way.  After a time she\nsummoned up courage to creep down, through the darkness of the\nstaircase, to see what this might be.  By the light of a match she saw\nthat it was a note addressed simply _Lucile_ with the number of the\nhouse and street,--for the streets were all numbered in Laurania as in\nAmerican cities.  It was from Savrola, in pencil and to this effect:\n_The city and forts have passed into our hands, but there will be\nfighting at daylight.  On no account leave the house or expose\nyourself_.\n\nFighting at daylight!  She looked at the clock,--a quarter to five, and\nalready the sky was growing brighter; the time was at hand then!  Fear,\ngrief, anxiety, and, not the least painful, resentment at her husband\nconflicted in her mind.  But the sleeping figures behind the barricade\nseemed to be troubled by none of these feelings; they lay silent and\nstill, weary men who had no cares.  But she knew it was coming,\nsomething loud and terrible that would wake them with a start.  She\nfelt as though she was watching a play at the theatre, the window\nsuggesting a box.  She had turned from it for a moment, when suddenly a\nrifle-shot rang out, apparently about three hundred yards down the\nstreet towards the palace.  Then there was a splutter of firing, a\nbugle-call, and the sound of shouting.  The defenders of the barricade\nsprang up in mad haste and seized their weapons.  There was more\nfiring, but still they did not reply, and she dared not put her head\nout of the window to see what prevented them.  They were all greatly\nexcited, holding their rifles over the barricade, and many talking in\nquick short sentences.  In a moment a crowd of men, nearly a hundred it\nseemed, ran up to the wall and began scrambling over, helped by the\nothers.  They were friends, then; it occurred to her that there must be\nanother barricade, and that the one under the window was in the second\nline.  This was actually the case, and the first had been captured.\nAll the time firing from the direction of the palace continued.\n\nAs soon as the fugitives were all across the wall, the defenders of the\nsecond line began to fire.  The rifles close by sounded so much louder\nthan the others, and gave forth such bright flashes.  But the light was\ngrowing every minute, and soon she could see the darting puffs of\nsmoke.  The rebels were armed with many kinds of firearms.  Some, with\nold, muzzle-loading muskets, had to stand up and descend from the\nbarricade to use their ramrods; others, armed with more modern weapons,\nremained crouching behind their cover and fired continually.\n\nThe scene, filled with little foreshortened figures, still suggested\nthe stage of a theatre viewed from the gallery.  She did not as yet\nfeel frightened; no harm had been done, and no one seemed to be any the\nworse.\n\nShe had scarcely completed this thought when she noticed a figure being\nlifted off the barricade to the ground.  In the growing daylight the\npale face showed distinctly, and a deadly feeling of sickness came over\nher in a moment; but she stood spell-bound by the sight.  Four men went\noff with the wounded one, carrying him by the shoulders and feet, so\nthat he drooped in the middle.  When they had passed out of her view,\nshe looked back to the wall.  There were five more men wounded; four\nhad to be carried, the other leaned on a comrade's arm.  Two more\nfigures had also been pulled off the barricade, and laid carelessly on\nthe pavement out of the way.  Nobody seemed to take any notice of\nthese, but just let them lie close to the area-railings.\n\nThen from the far end of the street came the sound of drums and the\nshrill call of a bugle, repeated again and again.  The rebels began to\nshoot in mad excitement as fast as they could; several fell, and above\nthe noise of the firing rose a strange sound, a sort of hoarse,\nscreaming whoop, coming momentarily nearer.\n\nA man on the barricade jumped off and began to run down the street;\nfive, six others followed at once; then all the defenders but three\nhurried away from that strange approaching cry.  Several tried to drag\nwith them the wounded, of which there already were a few more; these\ncried out in pain and begged to be left alone.  One man, she saw,\ndragging another by the ankle, bumping him along the rough roadway in\nspite of his entreaties.  The three men who had stayed fired\nmethodically from behind their breastwork.  All this took several\nseconds; and the menacing shout came nearer and louder all the time.\n\nThen in an instant a wave of men,--soldiers in blue uniforms faced with\nbuff--surged up to the barricade and over it.  An officer, quite a boy,\nin front of them all, jumped down the other side, shouting, \"Make a\nclear sweep of the cowardly devils,--come on!\"\n\nThe three steadfast men had disappeared as rocks beneath the incoming\ntide.  Crowds of soldiers climbed over the barricade; she could see\ngroups of them swarming round each of the wounded rebels, jobbing\ndownwards with their bayonets savagely.  And then the spell broke, the\npicture swam, and she rushed screaming from the window to plunge her\nface among the sofa-cushions.\n\nThe uproar was now terrific.  The musketry-fire was loud and\ncontinuous, especially from the direction of the main avenue which ran\nparallel to the street in which Savrola lived, and the shouting and\ntrampling of men added to the din.  Gradually the wave of fighting\nrolled past the house and on towards the Mayoralty.  As she realised\nthis, all her own troubles returned to her mind.  The fight was going\nagainst the rebels; she thought of Savrola.  And then she\nprayed,--prayed convulsively, sending her entreaties into space in the\nhope that they would not fall on unheeding ears.  She spoke no name;\nbut the gods, who are omniscient, may have guessed, with sardonic\nsmiles, that she prayed for the victory of the rebel she loved over her\nhusband, the President.\n\nPresently there was a tremendous noise from the direction of the\nMayoralty.  \"Cannons,\" she thought, but she dared not look out of the\nwindow; the horrid sights had sickened curiosity itself.  But she could\nhear the fire coming nearer, coming back again; and at that she felt a\nstrange joy; something of the joy of success in war, amid all her\nterrors.  There was a noise of people streaming past the house; shots\nwere fired under the windows; then came a great hammering and battering\nat the street-door.  They were breaking into the house!  She rushed to\nthe door of the room and locked it.  Down-stairs there were several\nshots, and the noise of splintering wood.  The firing of the retreating\ntroops drifted back past the house and towards the palace; but she did\nnot heed it; another sound paralysed her attention, the sound of\napproaching footsteps.  Someone was coming up-stairs.  She held her\nbreath.  The handle turned, and then the unknown, finding the door\nlocked, kicked it savagely.  Lucile screamed.\n\nThe kicking ceased, and she heard the stranger give a dreadful groan.\n\"For the mercy of Heaven, let me in!  I am wounded and have no arms.\"\nHe began to wail pitifully.\n\nLucile listened.  It seemed that there was but one, and if he were\nwounded, he would not harm her.  There was another groan outside.\nHuman sympathy rose in her heart; she unlocked the door and opened it\ncautiously.\n\nA man walked quickly into the room: it was Miguel.  \"I beg Your\nExcellency's pardon,\" he said suavely, with that composure which always\nstrengthened his mean soul; \"I am in need of a hiding-place.\"\n\n\"But your wound?\" she said.\n\n\"A _ruse-de-guerre_; I wanted you to let me in.  Where can I hide?\nThey may be here soon.\"\n\n\"There on the roof, or in the observatory,\" she said pointing to the\nother door.\n\n\"Do not tell them.\"\n\n\"Why should I?\" she replied.  Calm though the man undoubtedly was, she\ndespised him; there was no dirt, she knew well, that he would not eat\nif it suited his purpose to do so.\n\nHe went up and concealed himself on the roof under the big telescope.\nMeanwhile she waited.  Emotions had succeeded each other so rapidly\nthat day in her heart that she felt incapable of further stress; a dull\nfeeling of pain remained, like the numbness and sense of injury after a\nsevere wound.  The firing receded towards the palace, and presently all\nwas comparatively silent in the city again.\n\nAt about nine o'clock the bell of the front-entrance rang; but she did\nnot dare to leave the room now that the door was broken down.  Then\nafter a while came the sound of people coming up-stairs.\n\n\"There is no lady here; the young lady went back the night before last\nto her aunt's,\" said a voice.  It was the old woman's; with a bound of\njoy and a passionate craving for the sympathy of her own sex, Lucile\nrushed to the door and opened it.  Bettine was there, and with her an\nofficer of the rebel army, who handed a letter to her with these words:\n\"The President sends this to you, Madam.\"\n\n\"The President!\"\n\n\"Of the Council of Public Safety.\"\n\nThe note merely informed her that the Government troops had been\nrepulsed and ended with the words: _Only one result is now possible,\nand that will be attained in a few hours_.\n\nThe officer, saying that he would wait down-stairs in case she might\nwish to send an answer, left the room.  Lucile pulled the old nurse\ninside the door and embraced her, weeping.  Where had she been all that\nterrible night?  Bettine had been in the cellar.  It seemed that\nSavrola had thought of her as of everything; he had told her to take\nher bed down there, and had even had the place carpeted and furnished\non the preceding afternoon.  There she had remained as he had told her.\nHer perfect trust in her idol had banished all fears on her own\naccount, but she had \"fidgeted terribly\" about him.  He was all she had\nin the world; others dissipate their affections on a husband, children,\nbrothers, and sisters; all the love of her kind old heart was centred\nin the man she had fostered since he was a helpless baby.  And he did\nnot forget.  She displayed with pride a slip of paper, bearing the\nwords, _Safe and well_.\n\nThere was now a subdued sound of firing, from the direction of the\npalace, which continued throughout the morning; but Miguel, seeing that\nthe streets were again quiet, emerged from his concealment and\nre-entered the room.  \"I want to see the President,\" he said.\n\n\"My husband?\" asked Lucile.\n\n\"No, Your Excellency, Se\u00c3\u00b1or Savrola.\"  Miguel was quick in adapting\nhimself to circumstances.\n\nLucile thought of the officer; she mentioned him to Miguel.  \"He will\ntake you to the Mayoralty.\"\n\nThe Secretary was delighted; he ran down-stairs and they saw him no\nmore.\n\nThe old nurse, with a practical soul, busied herself about getting\nbreakfast.  Lucile, to divert her thoughts, aided her, and soon--such\nis our composition--found comfort in eggs and bacon.  They were\nrelieved to find that a picket had again been posted at the\nstreet-door.  Bettine discovered this, for Lucile, her mood unchanged,\nwould not look into the street where she had seen such grim spectacles.\nAnd she did right, for though the barricade was now deserted, nearly\ntwenty objects that had a few hours before been men, lay around or upon\nit.  But about eleven some labourers arrived with two scavengers'\ncarts; and soon only the bloodstains on the pavement showed that there\nhad been any destruction other than that of property.\n\nThe morning wore slowly and anxiously away.  The firing near the palace\nwas continual, but distant.  Sometimes it swelled into a dull roar, at\nothers the individual shots sounded in a sort of quick rattle.  At\nlast, at about half-past two, it stopped abruptly.  Lucile trembled.\nThe quarrel had been decided, one way or the other.  Her mind refused\nto face all the possibilities.  At times she clung in passionate fear\nto the old nurse, who tried in vain to soothe her; at others she joined\nher in the household tasks, or submitted to tasting the various meals\nwhich the poor old soul prepared for her in the hopes of killing care\nwith comfort.\n\nThe ominous silence that followed the cessation of the firing did not\nlast long.  It was while Lucile was being coaxed by Bettine to eat some\ncustard-pudding that she had made on purpose for her, that the report\nof the first great gun reached them.  The tremendous explosion, though\na long way off, made the windows rattle.  She shuddered.  What was\nthis?  She had hoped that all was over; but one explosion succeeded\nanother, until the thunder of a cannonade from the harbour almost\ndrowned their voices.  It was a weary waiting for the two women.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nAN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE.\n\nLieutenant Tiro reached the Mayoralty in safety, for though the streets\nwere full of excited people, they were peaceful citizens, and on his\nproclaiming that he had been sent to see Savrola they allowed him to\npass.  The Municipal building was a magnificent structure of white\nstone, elaborately decorated with statuary and sculpture.  In front of\nit, surrounded by iron railings and accessible by three gateways,\nstretched a wide courtyard, in which a great fountain, encircled by the\nmarble figures of departed civic magnates, played continually with\nagreeable effect.  The whole edifice was worthy of the riches and\nsplendour of the Lauranian capital.\n\nTwo sentries of the rebel forces stood on guard with fixed bayonets at\nthe central gateway, and allowed none to enter without due authority.\nMessengers were hurrying across the courtyard incessantly, and\norderlies coming or going at a gallop.  Without the gates a large\ncrowd, for the most part quiet, though greatly agitated, filled the\nbroad thoroughfare.  Wild rumours circulated at random in the mass and\nthe excitement was intense.  The sound of distant firing was distinct\nand continuous.\n\nTiro made his way through the crowd without much difficulty, but found\nhis path blocked by the sentries at the gateway.  They refused to allow\nhim to proceed, and for a moment he feared that he had run his risks in\nvain.  Luckily, however, he was recognised as Molara's aide-de-camp by\none of the Municipal attendants who were loitering in the courtyard.\nHe wrote his name on a piece of paper and requested the man to take it\nto Savrola or, as he was now styled, the President of the Council of\nPublic Safety.  The servant departed, and after ten minutes returned\nwith an officer, resplendent with the red sash of the Revolutionary\nparty, who bade the Subaltern follow him forthwith.\n\nThe hall of the Mayoralty was full of excited and voluble patriots who\nwere eager to serve the cause of Liberty, if it could be done without\nrisking their lives.  They all wore red sashes and talked loudly,\ndiscussing the despatches from the fight which arrived by frequent\nmessengers and were posted on the walls.  Tiro and his guide passed\nthrough the hall and hurrying along a passage arrived at the entrance\nof a small committee-room.  Several ushers and messengers stood around\nit; an officer was on duty outside.  He opened the door and announced\nthe Subaltern.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said a well-known voice, and Tiro entered.  It was a\nsmall, wainscotted apartment with two tall and deeply set glazed\nwindows shaded by heavy, faded curtains of reddish hue.  Savrola was\nwriting at a table in the middle of the room; Godoy and Renos were\ntalking near one of the windows; another man, whom for the moment he\ndid not recognise, was busily scribbling in the corner.  The great\nDemocrat looked up.\n\n\"Good-morning, Tiro,\" he said cheerily, then, seeing the serious and\nimpatient look on the boy's face, he asked him what had happened.  Tiro\ntold him quickly of the President's wish to surrender the palace.\n\"Well,\" said Savrola, \"Moret is there, and he has full powers.\"\n\n\"He is dead.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Savrola, in a low pained voice.\n\n\"Shot in the throat,\" replied the Subaltern laconically.\n\nSavrola had turned very white; he was fond of Moret and they had long\nbeen friends.  A feeling of disgust at the whole struggle came over\nhim; he repressed it; this was no time for regrets.  \"You mean that the\ncrowd will accept no surrender?\"\n\n\"I mean they have probably massacred them all by now.\"\n\n\"What time was Moret killed?\"\n\n\"A quarter-past twelve.\"\n\nSavrola took up a paper that lay beside him on the table.  \"This was\nsent off at half-past twelve.\"\n\nTiro looked at it.  It was signed _Moret_ and ran as follows: _Am\npreparing for final assault.  All well_.\n\n\"It is a forgery,\" said the Subaltern simply.  \"I started myself before\nthe half-hour, and Se\u00c3\u00b1or Moret had been dead ten minutes then.\nSomebody has assumed the command.\"\n\n\"By Jove,\" said Savrola getting up from the table.  \"Kreutze!\"  He\ncaught up his hat and cane.  \"Come on; he will most certainly murder\nMolara, and probably the others, if he is not stopped.  I must go there\nmyself.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Renos.  \"Most irregular; your place is here.\"\n\n\"Send an officer,\" suggested Godoy.\n\n\"I have none to send of sufficient power with the people, unless you\nwill go yourself.\"\n\n\"I!  No, certainly not!  I would not think of it,\" said Godoy quickly.\n\"It would be useless; I have no authority over the mob.\"\n\n\"That is not quite the tone you have adopted all the morning,\" replied\nSavrola quietly, \"or at least since the Government attack was\nrepulsed.\"  Then turning to Tiro, he said, \"Let us start.\"\n\nThey were leaving the room when the Subaltern saw that the man who had\nbeen writing in the corner was looking at him.  To his astonishment he\nrecognised Miguel.\n\nThe Secretary bowed satirically.  \"Here we are again,\" he said; \"you\nwere wise to follow.\"\n\n\"You insult me,\" said Tiro with profound contempt.  \"Rats leave a\nsinking ship.\"\n\n\"The wiser they,\" rejoined the Secretary; \"they could do no good by\nstaying.  I have always heard that aides-de-camp are the first to leave\na fight.\"\n\n\"You are a damned dirty dog,\" said the Subaltern falling back on a\nrudimentary form of repartee with which he was more familiar.\n\n\"I can wait no longer,\" said Savrola in a voice that was a plain\ncommand.  Tiro obeyed, and they left the room.\n\nWalking down the passage and through the hall, where Savrola was loudly\ncheered, they reached the entrance, where a carriage was waiting.  A\ndozen mounted men, with red sashes and rifles, ranged themselves about\nit as an escort.  The crowd outside the gates, seeing the great leader\nand hearing the applause within, raised a shout.  Savrola turned to the\ncommander of the escort.  \"I need no guard,\" he said; \"that is\nnecessary only for tyrants.  I will go alone.\"  The escort fell back.\nThe two men entered the carriage and, drawn by strong horses, passed\nout into the streets.\n\n\"You dislike Miguel?\" asked Savrola after a while.\n\n\"He is a traitor.\"\n\n\"There are plenty about the city.  Now I suppose you would call me a\ntraitor.\"\n\n\"Ah! but you have always been one,\" replied Tiro bluntly.  Savrola gave\na short laugh.  \"I mean,\" continued the other, \"that you have always\nbeen trying to upset things.\"\n\n\"I have been loyal to my treachery,\" suggested Savrola.\n\n\"Yes,--we have always been at war with you; but this viper----\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Savrola, \"you must take men as you find them; few are\ndisinterested.  The viper, as you call him, is a poor creature; but he\nsaved my life, and asked me to save his in return.  What could I do?\nBesides he is of use.  He knows the exact state of the public finances\nand is acquainted with the details of the foreign policy.  What are we\nstopping for?\"\n\nTiro looked out.  The street was closed by a barricade which made it a\n_cul-de-sac_.  \"Try the next turning,\" he said to the coachman; \"go on\nquickly.\"  The noise of the firing could now be distinctly heard.  \"We\nvery nearly pulled it off this morning,\" said Tiro.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Savrola; \"they told me the attack was repulsed with\ndifficulty.\"\n\n\"Where were you?\" asked the boy in great astonishment.\n\n\"At the Mayoralty, asleep; I was very tired.\"\n\nTiro was conscious of an irresistible feeling of disgust.  So he was a\ncoward, this great man.  He had always heard that politicians took care\nof their skins, and sent others to fight their battles.  Somehow he had\nthought that Savrola was different: he knew such a lot about polo; but\nhe was the same as all the rest.\n\nSavrola, ever quick to notice, saw his look and again laughed dryly.\n\"You think I ought to have been in the streets?  Believe me, I did more\ngood where I was.  If you had seen the panic and terror at the\nMayoralty during the fighting, you would have recognised that there\nwere worse things to do than to go to sleep in confidence.  Besides,\neverything in human power had been done; and we had not miscalculated.\"\n\nTiro remained unconvinced.  His good opinion of Savrola was destroyed.\nHe had heard much of this man's political courage.  The physical always\noutweighed the moral in his mind.  He felt reluctantly convinced that\nhe was a mere word-spinner, brave enough where speeches were concerned,\nbut careful when sterner work was to be done.\n\nThe carriage stopped again.  \"All these streets are barricaded, Sir,\"\nsaid the coach-man.\n\nSavrola looked out of the window.  \"We are close there, let us walk; it\nis only half a mile across Constitution Square.\"  He jumped out.  The\nbarricade was deserted, as were the streets in this part of the town.\nMost of the violent rebels were attacking the palace, and the peaceable\ncitizens were in their houses or outside the Mayoralty.\n\nThey scrambled over the rough wail, which was made of paving-stones and\nsacks of earth piled under and upon two waggons, and hurried down the\nstreet beyond.  It led to the great square of the city.  At the further\nend was the Parliament House, with the red flag of revolt flying from\nits tower.  An entrenchment had been dug in front of the entrance, and\nthe figures of some of the rebel soldiery were visible on it.\n\nThey had gone about a quarter of the distance across the square, when\nsuddenly, from the entrenchment or barricade three hundred yards away,\nthere darted a puff of smoke; five or six more followed in quick\nsuccession.  Savrola paused, astonished, but the Subaltern understood\nat once.  \"Run for it!\" he cried.  \"The statue,--there is cover behind\nit.\"\n\nSavrola began to run as fast as he could.  The firing from the\nbarricade continued.  He heard two sucking kisses in the air; something\nstruck the pavement in front of him so that the splinters flew, and\nwhile he passed a grey smudge appeared; there was a loud _tang_ on the\narea-railings beside him; the dust of the roadway sprang up in several\nstrange spurts.  As he ran, the realisation of what these things meant\ngrew stronger; but the distance was short and he reached the statue\nalive.  Behind its massive pedestal there was ample shelter for both.\n\n\"They fired at us.\"\n\n\"They did,\" replied Tiro.  \"Damn them!\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"My uniform--devilry--running man--good fun, you know--for them.\"\n\n\"We must go on,\" said Savrola.\n\n\"We can't go on across the square.\"\n\n\"Which way, then?\"\n\n\"We must work down the street away from them, keeping the statue\nbetween us and their fire, and get up one of the streets to the left.\"\n\nA main street ran through the centre of the great square, and led out\nof it at right angles to the direction in which they were proceeding.\nIt was possible to retire down this under cover of the statue, and to\ntake a parallel street further along.  This would enable them to avoid\nthe fire from the entrenchment, or would at least reduce the dangerous\nspace to a few yards.  Savrola looked in the direction Tiro indicated.\n\"Surely this is shorter,\" he said pointing across the square.\n\n\"Much shorter,\" answered the Subaltern; \"in about three seconds it will\ntake you to another world.\"\n\nSavrola rose.  \"Come on,\" he said; \"I do not allow such considerations\nto affect my judgment.  The lives of men are at stake; the time is\nshort.  Besides, this is an educational experience.\"\n\nThe blood was in his cheeks and his eyes sparkled; all that was\nreckless in him, all his love of excitement, stirred in his veins.\nTiro looked at him amazed.  Brave as he was, he saw no pleasure in\nrushing to his death at the heels of a mad politician; but he allowed\nno man to show him the way.  He said no more, but drew back to the far\nend of the pedestal, so as to gain pace, and then bounded into the open\nand ran as fast as he could run.\n\nHow he got across he never knew.  One bullet cut the peak of his cap,\nanother tore his trousers.  He had seen many men killed in action, and\nanticipated the fearful blow that would bring him down with a smash on\nthe pavement.  Instinctively he raised his left arm as if to shield his\nface.  At length he reached safety, breathless and incredulous.  Then\nhe looked back.  Half way across was Savrola, walking steadily and\ndrawn up to his full height.  Thirty yards away he stopped and, taking\noff his felt hat, waved it in defiance at the distant barricade.  Tiro\nsaw him start as he lifted his arm, and his hat fell to the ground.  He\ndid not pick it up, and in a moment was beside him, his face pale, his\nteeth set, every muscle rigid.  \"Now tell me,\" he said, \"do you call\nthat a hot fire?\"\n\n\"You are mad,\" replied the Subaltern.\n\n\"Why, may I ask?\"\n\n\"What is the use of throwing away your life, of waiting to taunt them?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" he answered, much excited, \"I waved my hat in the face of Fate,\nnot at those wretched irresponsible animals.  Now to the palace;\nperhaps we are already too late.\"\n\nThey hurried on through the deserted streets with the sound of musketry\ngrowing ever louder, and mingling with it now the shouts and yells of a\ncrowd.  As they approached the scene they passed through groups of\npeople, peaceful citizens for the most part, anxiously looking towards\nthe tumult.  Several glanced fiercely at the soldier whose uniform made\nhim conspicuous; but many took off their hats to Savrola.  A long\nstring of stretchers, each with a pale, shattered figure on it, passed\nby, filing slowly away from the fight.  The press became thicker, and\narms were now to be seen on all sides.  Mutinous soldiers still in\ntheir uniforms, workmen in blouses, others in the dress of the National\nMilitia, and all wearing the red sash of the revolt, filled the street.\nBut Savrola's name had spread before him and the crowd divided, with\ncheers, to give him passage.\n\nSuddenly the firing in front ceased, and for a space there was silence,\nfollowed by a ragged spluttering volley and a low roar from many\nthroats.\n\n\"It's all over,\" said the Subaltern.\n\n\"Faster!\" cried Savrola.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nTHE END OF THE QUARREL.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour after Lieutenant Tiro had escaped along the\ntelegraph-wires, the attack on the palace was renewed with vigour.  It\nseemed, moreover, that the rebels had found a new leader, for they\ndisplayed considerable combination in their tactics.  The firing\nincreased on all sides.  Then, under cover of their musketry, the enemy\ndebouched simultaneously from several streets, and, rushing down the\ngreat avenue, delivered a general assault.  The garrison fired steadily\nand with effect, but there were not enough bullets to stop the\nadvancing crowds.  Many fell, but the rest pressed on impetuously and\nfound shelter under the wall of the courtyard.  The defenders,\nrealising they could no longer hold this outer line of defence, fell\nback to the building itself, where they maintained themselves among the\ngreat pillars of the entrance, and for some time held the enemy's fire\nin check by shooting accurately at all those who put their heads over\nthe wall or exposed themselves.  Gradually, however, the rebels, by\ntheir great numbers, gained the supremacy in the fire-fight, and the\ndefenders in their turn found it dangerous to show themselves to shoot.\n\nThe musketry of the attack grew heavier, while that of the defence\ndwindled.  The assailants now occupied the whole of the outer wall, and\nat length completely silenced the fire of the surviving adherents of\nthe Government.  Twenty rifles were discharged at any head that showed;\nyet they showed a prudent respect for these determined men, and gave no\nchances away.  Under cover of their fire, and of the courtyard wall,\nthey brought up the field-gun with which the gate had been broken in,\nand from a range of a hundred yards discharged it at the palace.  The\nshell smashed through the masonry, and burst in the great hall.\nAnother followed, passing almost completely through the building and\nexploding in the breakfast-room on the further side.  The curtains,\ncarpets, and chairs caught fire and began to burn briskly; it was\nevident that the defence of the palace was drawing to a close.\n\nSorrento, who had long schooled himself to look upon all events of war\nfrom a purely professional standpoint, and who boasted that the\nmilitary operation he preferred above all others was the organising of\na rearguard from a defeated army, felt that nothing further could be\ndone.  He approached the President.\n\nMolara stood in the great hall where he had lived and ruled for five\nyears with a bitter look of despair upon his face.  The mosaic of the\npavement was ripped and scored by the iron splinters of the shells;\ngreat fragments of the painted roof had fallen to the ground; the\ncrimson curtains were smouldering; the broken glass of the windows lay\non the floor, and heavy clouds of smoke were curling in from the\nfurther side of the palace.  The President's figure and expression\naccorded well with the scene of ruin and destruction.\n\nSorrento saluted with much ceremony.  He had only his military code to\nbelieve in, and he took firm hold of that.  \"Owing, Sir,\" he began\nofficially, \"to the rebels having brought a gun into action at close\nrange, it is my duty to inform you that this place has now become\nuntenable.  It will be necessary to capture the gun by a charge, and\nexpel the enemy from the courtyard.\"\n\nThe President knew what he meant; they should rush out and die\nfighting.  The agony of the moment was intense; the actual dread of\ndeath was increased by the sting of unsatisfied revenge; he groaned\naloud.\n\nSuddenly a loud shout arose from the crowd.  They had seen the smoke of\nthe fire and knew that the end was at hand.  \"Molara, Molara, come out!\nDictator,\" they cried, \"come out or burn!\"\n\nIt often happens that, when men are convinced that they have to die, a\ndesire to bear themselves well and to leave life's stage with dignity\nconquers all other sensations.  Molara remembered that, after all, he\nhad lived famous among men.  He had been almost a king.  All the eyes\nof the world would be turned to the scene about to be enacted; distant\ncountries would know, distant ages would reflect.  It was worth while\ndying bravely, since die he must.\n\nHe called his last defenders around him.  There were but thirty left,\nand of these some were wounded.  \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"you have been\nfaithful to the end; I will demand no more sacrifices of you.  My death\nmay appease those wild beasts.  I give you back your allegiance, and\nauthorise you to surrender.\"\n\n\"Never!\" said Sorrento.\n\n\"It is a military order, Sir,\" answered the President, and walked\ntowards the door.  He stepped through the shattered woodwork and out on\nthe broad flight of steps.  The courtyard was filled with the crowd.\nMolara advanced until he had descended half way; then he paused.  \"Here\nI am,\" he said.  The crowd stared.  For a moment he stood there in the\nbright sunlight.  His dark blue uniform-coat, on which the star of\nLaurania and many orders and decorations of foreign countries\nglittered, was open, showing his white shirt beneath it.  He was\nbare-headed and drew himself up to his full height.  For a while there\nwas silence.\n\nThen from all parts of the courtyard, from the wall that overlooked it\nand even from the windows of the opposite houses, a ragged fusilade\nbroke out.  The President's head jerked forward, his legs shot from\nunder him and he fell to the ground, quite limp.  The body rolled down\ntwo or three steps and lay twitching feebly.  A man in a dark suit of\nclothes, and who apparently exercised authority over the crowd,\nadvanced towards it.  Presently there was a single shot.\n\nAt the same moment Savrola and his companion, stepping through the\nbroken gateway, entered the courtyard.  The mob gave passage readily,\nbut in a sullen and guilty silence.\n\n\"Keep close to me,\" said Savrola to the Subaltern.  He walked straight\ntowards the steps which were not as yet invaded by the rebel soldiery.\nThe officers among the pillars had, with the cessation of the firing,\nbegun to show themselves; someone waved a handkerchief.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" cried Savrola in a loud voice, \"I call upon you to\nsurrender.  Your lives shall be spared.\"\n\nSorrento stepped forward.  \"By the orders of His Excellency I surrender\nthe palace and the Government troops who have defended it.  I do so on\na promise that their lives shall be safe.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Savrola.  \"Where is the President?\"  Sorrento pointed\nto the other side of the steps.  Savrola turned and walked towards the\nspot.\n\nAntonio Molara, sometime President of the Republic of Laurania, lay on\nthe three lowest steps of the entrance of his palace, head downwards; a\nfew yards away in a ring stood the people he had ruled.  A man in a\nblack suit was reloading his revolver; it was Karl Kreutze, the Number\nOne of the Secret Society.  The President had bled profusely from\nseveral bullet-wounds in the body, but it was evident that the _coup de\ngr\u00c3\u00a2ce_ had been administered by a shot in the head.  The back and left\nside of the skull behind the ear was blown away, and the force of the\nexplosion, probably at close quarters, had cracked all the bones of the\nface so that as the skin was whole, it looked like broken china in a\nsponge bag.\n\nSavrola stopped aghast.  He looked at the crowd, and they shrank from\nhis eye; gradually they shuffled back, leaving the sombre-clad man\nalone face to face with the great Democrat.  A profound hush overspread\nthe whole mass of men.  \"Who has committed this murder?\" he asked in\nlow hoarse tones, fixing his glance on the head of the Secret Society.\n\n\"It is not a murder,\" replied the man doggedly; \"it is an execution.\"\n\n\"By whose authority?\"\n\n\"In the name of the Society.\"\n\nWhen Savrola had seen the body of his enemy, he was stricken with\nhorror, but at the same time a dreadful joy convulsed his heart; the\nbarrier was now removed.  He struggled to repress the feeling, and of\nthe struggle anger was born.  Kreutze's words infuriated him.  A sense\nof maddening irritation shook his whole system.  All this must fall on\nhis name; what would Europe think, what would the world say?  Remorse,\nshame, pity, and the wicked joy he tried to crush, all fused into\nreckless ungovernable passion.  \"Vile scum!\" he cried, and stepping\ndown he slashed the other across the face with his cane.\n\nThe man sprang at his throat on the sudden impulse of intense pain.\nBut Lieutenant Tiro had drawn his sword; with a strong arm and a hearty\ngood will he met him with all the sweep of a downward cut, and rolled\nhim on the ground.\n\nThe spring was released, and the fury of the populace broke out.  A\nloud shout arose.  Great as was Savrola's reputation among the\nRevolutionaries, these men had known other and inferior leaders more\nintimately.  Karl Kreutze was a man of the people.  His socialistic\nwritings had been widely read; as the head of the Secret Society he had\ncertain assured influences to support him, and he had conducted the\nlatter part of the attack on the palace.  Now he had been destroyed\nbefore their eyes by one of the hated officers.  The crowd surged\nforward shouting in savage anger.\n\nSavrola sprang backwards up the steps.  \"Citizens, listen to me!\" he\ncried.  \"You have won a victory; do not disgrace it.  Your valour and\npatriotism have triumphed; do not forget that it is for our ancient\nConstitution that you have fought.\"  He was interrupted by shouts and\njeers.\n\n\"What have I done?\" he rejoined.  \"As much as any here.  I too have\nrisked my life in the great cause.  Is there a man here that has a\nwound?  Let him stand forth, for we are comrades.\"  And for the first\ntime, with a proud gesture, he lifted his left arm.  Tiro perceived the\nreason of the start he had given when running the gauntlet in\nConstitution Square.  The sleeve of his coat was torn and soaked with\nblood; the linen of his shirt protruded crimson; his fingers were stiff\nand smeared all over.\n\nThe impression produced was tremendous.  The mob, to whom the dramatic\nalways appeals with peculiar force, were also swayed by that sympathy\nwhich all men feel for those injured in a common danger.  A revulsion\ntook place.  A cheer, faint, at first, but growing louder, rose; others\noutside the courtyard, ignorant of the reason, took it up.  Savrola\ncontinued.\n\n\"Our State, freed from tyranny, must start fair and unsullied.  Those\nwho have usurped undue authority, not derived from the people, shall be\npunished, whether they be presidents or citizens.  These military\nofficers must come before the judges of the Republic and answer for\ntheir actions.  A free trial is the right of all Lauranians.  Comrades,\nmuch has been done, but we have not finished yet.  We have exalted\nLiberty; it remains to preserve her.  These officers shall be lodged in\nprison; for you there is other work.  The ships are coming back; it is\nnot yet time to put away the rifles.  Who is there will see the matter\nthrough,--to the end?\"\n\nA man, with a bloodstained bandage round his head, stepped forward.\n\"We are comrades,\" he cried; \"shake hands.\"\n\nSavrola gripped him.  He was one of the subordinate officers in the\nrebel army, a simple honest man whom Savrola had known slightly for\nseveral months.  \"I entrust a high duty to you.  Conduct these officers\nand soldiers to the State Prison; I will send full instructions by a\nmounted messenger.  Where can you find an escort?\"  There was no lack\nof volunteers.  \"To the Prison then, and remember that the faith of the\nRepublic depends on their safety.  Forward, Gentlemen,\" he added,\nturning to the surviving defenders of the palace; \"your lives are safe,\nupon my honour.\"\n\n\"The honour of a conspirator,\" sneered Sorrento.\n\n\"As you like, Sir, but obey.\"\n\nThe party, Tiro alone remaining with Savrola, moved off, surrounded and\nfollowed by many of the crowd.  While they did so a dull heavy boom\ncame up from the sea-front; another and another followed in quick\nsuccession.  The fleet had returned at last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nTHE RETURN OF THE FLEET.\n\nAdmiral de Mello had been true to his word, and had obeyed the order\nwhich had reached him through the proper channel.  He was within a\nhundred miles of Port Said when the despatch-boat, with the Agent of\nthe Republic, had been met.  He at once changed his course, and steamed\ntowards the city he had so lately left.  His fleet consisted of two\nbattleships, which, though slow and out of date, were yet formidable\nmachines, two cruisers, and a gunboat.  The inopportune bursting of a\nsteam-pipe on board the flagship, the _Fortuna_, caused a delay of\nseveral hours, and it was not till two o'clock in the afternoon of the\nsecond day that he rounded the point and saw the harbour and city of\nLaurania rise fair and white on the starboard bow.  His officers\nscanned the capital, which was their home and of whose glories they\nwere proud, with anxious eyes; nor were their fears unfounded.  The\nsmoke of half a dozen conflagrations rose from among the streets and\ngardens; the foreign shipping had moved out of the basin and lay off in\nthe roads, for the most part under steam; a strange red flag flew from\nthe fort at the end of the mole.\n\nThe Admiral, signalling for half-speed, picked his way towards the\nmouth of the channel cautiously.  It was so contrived that a vessel in\npassing must be exposed to a cross-fire from the heavy guns in the\nbatteries.  The actual passage was nearly a mile wide, but the\nnavigable channel itself was dangerously narrow and extremely\ndifficult.  De Mello, who knew every foot of it, led the way in the\n_Fortuna_; the two cruisers, _Sorato_ and _Petrarch_, followed; the\ngunboat _Rienzi_ was next, and the other battleship, _Saldanho_,\nbrought up the rear.  The signal was made to clear for action; the men\nwere beat to quarters; the officers went to their posts, and the fleet,\nassisted by a favourable tide, steamed slowly towards the entrance.\n\nThe rebel gunners wasted no time in formalities.  As the _Fortuna_ came\ninto the line of fire, two great bulges of smoke sprang from the\nembrasures; the nine-inch guns of the seaward battery were discharged.\nBoth shells flew high and roared through the masts of the warship, who\nincreased her speed to seven knots and stood on her course followed by\nher consorts.  As each gun of the forts came to bear, it was fired, but\nthe aim was bad, and the projectiles ricochetted merrily over the\nwater, raising great fountains of spray, and it was not until the\nleading ship had arrived at the entrance of the channel, that she was\nstruck.\n\nA heavy shell, charged with a high explosive, crashed into the\nport-battery of the _Fortuna_, killing and wounding nearly sixty men,\nas well as dismounting two out of the four guns.  This roused the huge\nmachine; the forward turret revolved and, turning swiftly towards the\nfort, brought its great twin guns to bear.  Their discharge was almost\nsimultaneous, and the whole ship staggered with the violence of the\nrecoil.  Both shells struck the fort and exploded on impact, smashing\nthe masonry to splinters and throwing heaps of earth into the air; but\nthe harm done was slight.  Safe in their bomb-proofs, the rebel gunners\nwere exposed only to the danger of missiles entering the embrasures;\nwhile such guns as fired from _barbette_ mountings were visible only at\nthe moment of discharge.\n\nNevertheless the great ship began literally to spout flame in all\ndirections, and her numerous quick-firing guns searched for the\nembrasures, sprinkling their small shells with prodigal rapidity.\nSeveral of these penetrated, and the rebels began to lose men.  As the\nships advanced, the cross-fire grew hotter, and each in succession\nreplied furiously.  The cannonade became tremendous, the loud\nexplosions of the heavy guns being almost drowned by the incessant\nrattle of the quick firers; the waters of the harbour were spotted all\nover with great spouts of foam, while the clear air showed the white\nsmoke-puffs of the bursting shells.  The main battery of the _Fortuna_\nwas completely silenced.  A second shell had exploded with a horrid\nslaughter, and the surviving sailors had fled from the scene to the\narmoured parts of the vessel; nor could their officers induce them to\nreturn to that fearful shambles, where the fragments of their comrades\nlay crushed between masses of senseless iron.  The sides of the ships\nwere scored and torn all over, and the copious streams of water from\nthe scuppers attested the energy of the pumps.  The funnel of the\n_Fortuna_ had been shot off almost level with the deck, and the clouds\nof black smoke floating across her quarters drove the gunners from the\nstern-turret and from the after-guns.  Broken, dismantled, crowded with\ndead and dying, her vitals were still uninjured, and her captain, in\nthe conning tower, feeling that she still answered the helm, rejoiced\nin his good fortune and held on his course.\n\nThe cruiser _Petrarch_ had her steam steering-gear twisted and jammed\nby a shell, and becoming unmanageable grounded on a sand-bank.  The\nforts, redoubling their fire, began to smash her to pieces.  She\ndisplayed a white flag and stopped firing: but of this no notice was\ntaken, and as the other ships dared not risk going ashore in helping\nher, she became a wreck and blew up at three o'clock with a prodigious\nreport.\n\nThe _Saldanho_, who suffered least and was very heavily armoured,\ncontrived to shelter the gunboat a good deal, and the whole fleet\npassed the batteries after forty minutes' fighting and with a loss of\ntwo hundred and twenty men killed and wounded, exclusive of the entire\ncrew of the _Petrarch_, who were all destroyed.  The rebel loss was\nabout seventy, and the damage done to the forts was slight.  But it was\nnow the turn of the sailors.  The city of Laurania was at their mercy.\n\nThe Admiral brought his ships to anchor five hundred yards from the\nshore.  He hoisted a flag of truce, and as all his boats had been\nsmashed in running the gauntlet, he signalled to the Custom-House that\nhe was anxious for a parley, and desired that an officer should be sent.\n\nAfter about an hour's delay, a launch put out from the jetty and ran\nalongside the _Fortuna_.  Two rebel officers in the uniform of the\nRepublican Militia, and with red sashes round their waists, came on\nboard.  De Mello received them on his battered quarter-deck, with\nextreme politeness.  Rough sailor as he was, he had mixed with men of\nmany lands, and his manners were invariably improved by the proximity\nof danger or the consciousness of power.  \"May I ask,\" he said, \"to\nwhat we are indebted for this welcome to our native city?\"\n\nThe senior of the two officers replied that the forts had not fired\ntill they were fired upon.  The Admiral did not argue the point, but\nasked what had happened in the city.  On hearing of the Revolution and\nof the death of the President, he was deeply moved.  Like Sorrento, he\nhad known Molara for many years, and he was an honest, open-hearted\nman.  The officers continued that the Provisional Government would\naccept his surrender and that of his ships, and would admit him and his\nofficers to honourable terms as prisoners of war.  He produced the\nauthorisation of the Committee of Public Safety, signed by Savrola.\n\nDe Mello somewhat scornfully requested him to be serious.\n\nThe officer pointed out that the fleet in its battered condition could\nnot again run the gauntlet of the batteries and would be starved out.\n\nTo this De Mello replied that the forts at the head of the harbour were\nin like condition, as his guns now commanded both the approaches by the\nmilitary mole and the promontory.  He also stated that he had six\nweeks' provisions on board and added that he thought he had sufficient\nammunition.\n\nHis advantage was not denied.  \"Undoubtedly, Sir,\" said the officer,\n\"it is in your power to render great services to the Provisional\nGovernment and to the cause of Liberty and Justice.\"\n\n\"At present,\" replied the Admiral dryly, \"it is the cause of Justice\nthat appears to need my support.\"\n\nTo that the officers could find no more to say than that they had\nfought for a free Parliament and meant to have their way.\n\nThe Admiral took a turn or two before replying.  \"My terms are these,\"\nhe said at last.  \"The leader of the conspiracy--this man,\nSavrola--must be surrendered at once and stand his trial for murder and\nrebellion.  Until this has been done, I will not treat.  Unless this is\ndone by six o'clock to-morrow morning, I shall bombard the town and\nshall continue to do so until my terms are complied with.\"\n\nBoth officers protested that this would be a barbarity, and hinted that\nhe would be made to answer for his shells.  The Admiral declined to\ndiscuss the matter or to consider other terms.  As it was impossible to\nmove him, the officers returned to the shore in their launch.  It was\nnow four o'clock.\n\nAs soon as this _ultimatum_ was reported to the Committee of Public\nSafety at the Mayoralty, something very like consternation ensued.  The\nidea of a bombardment was repugnant to the fat burgesses who had joined\nthe party of revolt so soon as it had become obvious that it was the\nwinning side.  It was also distasteful to the Socialists who, however\nmuch they might approve of the application of dynamite to others, did\nnot themselves relish the idea of a personal acquaintance with high\nexplosives.\n\nThe officers related their interview and the Admiral's demands.\n\n\"And if we refuse to comply?\" inquired Savrola.\n\n\"Then he will open fire at six o'clock to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Well, Gentlemen, we shall have to grin and bear it.  They will not\ndare to shoot away all their ammunition, and so soon as they see that\nwe are determined, they will give in.  Women and children will be safe\nin the cellars, and it may be possible to bring some of the guns of the\nforts to bear on the harbour.\"  There was no enthusiasm.  \"It will be\nan expensive game of bluff,\" he added.\n\n\"There is a cheaper way,\" said a Socialist delegate from the end of the\ntable, significantly.\n\n\"What do you propose?\" asked Savrola looking hard at him; the man had\nbeen a close ally of Kreutze.\n\n\"I say that it would be cheaper if the leader of the revolt were to\nsacrifice himself for the sake of Society.\"\n\n\"That is your opinion; I will take the sense of the Committee on it.\"\nThere were cries of \"No!  No!\" and \"Shame!\" from many present.  Some\nwere silent; but it was evident that Savrola had the majority.  \"Very\nwell,\" he said acidly; \"the Committee of Public Safety do not propose\nto adopt the honourable member's suggestion.  He is overruled,\"--here\nhe looked hard at the man, who blenched,--\"as he will frequently be\namong people of civilised habits.\"\n\nAnother man got up from the end of the long table.  \"Look here,\" he\nsaid roughly; \"if our city is at their mercy, we have hostages.  We\nhave thirty of these popinjays who fought us this morning; let us send\nand tell the Admiral that we shall shoot one for every shell he fires.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of assent.  Many approved of the proposal, because\nthey thought that it need never be carried into execution, and all\nwanted to prevent the shells.  Savrola's plan, however wise, was\npainful.  It was evident that the new suggestion was a popular one.\n\n\"It is out of the question,\" said Savrola.\n\n\"Why?\" asked several voices.\n\n\"Because, Sirs, these officers surrendered to terms, and because the\nRepublic does not butcher innocent men.\"\n\n\"Let us divide upon it,\" said the man.\n\n\"I protest against a division.  This is not a matter of debate or of\nopinion; it is a matter of right and wrong.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless I am for voting.\"\n\n\"And I,\" \"And I,\" \"And I,\" shouted many voices.\n\nThe voting went forward.  Renos supported Savrola on legal grounds; the\ncase of the officers was now _sub judice_, so he said.  Godoy\nabstained.  The majority in favour of the proposal was twenty-one to\nseventeen.\n\nThe count of hands was received with cheering.  Savrola shrugged his\nshoulders.  \"It is impossible that this can go on.  Are we become\nbarbarians in a morning?\"\n\n\"There is an alternative,\" said Kreutze's friend.\n\n\"There is, Sir; an alternative that I should gladly embrace before this\nnew plan was carried out.  But,\" in a low menacing tone, \"the people\nwill be invited to pronounce an opinion first, and I may have an\nopportunity of showing them their real enemies and mine.\"\n\nThe man made no reply to the obvious threat; like all the others he\nstood in considerable awe of Savrola's power with the mob and of his\nstrong dominating character.  The silence was broken by Godoy, who said\nthat the matter had been settled by the Committee.  A note was\ntherefore drafted and despatched to the Admiral, informing him that the\nmilitary prisoners would be shot should he bombard the city.  After\nfurther discussion the Committee broke up.\n\nSavrola remained behind, watching the members move slowly away talking\nas they went.  Then he rose and entered the small room he had used as\nhis office.  His spirits were low.  Slight as it was, his wound hurt\nhim; but worse than that, he was conscious that there were hostile\ninfluences at work; he was losing his hold over the Party.  While\nvictory was still in the balance he had been indispensable; now they\nwere prepared to go on alone.  He thought of all he had gone through\nthat day; the terrible scene of the night, the excitement and anxiety\nwhile the fighting was going on, the strange experience in the square,\nand, last of all, this grave matter.  His mind, however, was made up.\nHe knew enough of De Mello to guess what his answer would be.  \"They\nare soldiers,\" he would say; \"they must give their lives if necessary.\nNo prisoner should allow his friends to be compromised on his account.\nThey should not have surrendered.\"  When the bombardment began he could\nimagine fear turning to cruelty, and the crowd carrying out the threat\nthat their leaders had made.  Whatever happened, the affair could not\nbe allowed to continue.\n\nHe rang the bell.  \"Ask the Secretary to come here,\" he said to the\nattendant.  The man departed, and in a few moments returned with\nMiguel.  \"What officer has charge of the prison?\"\n\n\"I don't think the officials have been altered; they have taken no part\nin the Revolution.\"\n\n\"Well, write an order to the Governor to send the prisoners of war, the\nmilitary officers taken this afternoon, in closed carriages to the\nrailway station.  They must be there at ten o'clock to-night.\"\n\n\"Are you going to release them?\" asked Miguel opening his eyes.\n\n\"I am going to send them to a place of security,\" answered Savrola\nambiguously.\n\nMiguel began to write the order without further comment.  Savrola took\nthe telephone off the table and rang up the railway-station.  \"Tell the\ntraffic-manager to come and speak to me.  Are you there?--The President\nof the Executive Committee of the Council of Public Safety--do you\nhear?  Have a special train,--accommodation for thirty--ready to start\nat ten p.m.  Clear the line to the frontier,--yes,--right to the\nfrontier.\"\n\nMiguel looked up from his writing quickly, but said nothing.  Although\nhe had deserted the President when he saw that he was ruined and his\ncause lost, he hated Savrola with a genuine hatred.  An idea came into\nhis head.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nLIFE'S COMPENSATIONS.\n\nMuch had happened, though but a few hours had passed since Savrola left\nhis house to hurry to the Mayoralty.  The deep and intricate\nconspiracy, which had been growing silently and in secret for so many\nmonths, had burst on the world's stage and electrified the nations.\nAll Europe had learned with amazement of the sudden and terrible\nconvulsion that in a few hours had overthrown the Government which had\nexisted for five years in Laurania.  In the fighting that had raged\nthroughout the ninth of September upwards of fourteen hundred persons\nhad been killed and wounded.  The damage done to property had been\nenormous.  The Senate-House was in flames; the palace had been\ndestroyed; both, together with many shops and private houses, had been\nlooted by the mob and the mutineers.  Fires were still smouldering in\nseveral parts of the city; in many homes there were empty places and\nweeping women; in the streets the ambulances and municipal carts were\ncollecting the corpses.  It had been a momentous day in the annals of\nthe State.\n\nAnd all through the terrible hours Lucile had waited, listening to the\nsound of the musketry, which, sometimes distant and fitful, sometimes\nnear and sustained, suggested the voice of a wrathful giant, now sunk\nin sulky grumblings, now raised in loud invective.  She had listened in\nsorrow and suspense, till it was lost in the appalling din of the\ncannonade.  At intervals, between the bathos of the material\nconsolations of the old nurse,--soup, custards, and the like--she had\nprayed.  Until four o'clock, when she had received a message from\nSavrola acquainting her with the tragedy at the palace, she had not\ndared to add a name to her appeals; but thenceforward she implored a\nmerciful Providence to save the life of the man she loved.  Molara she\ndid not mourn: terrible and cruel as was his death, she could not feel\nshe had suffered loss; but the idea that he had been killed on her\naccount filled her heart with a dreadful fear of guilt.  If that were\nso, she said to herself, one barrier was removed only to be replaced by\nanother.  But the psychologist might cynically aver that force and\ndeath were the only obstacles that would restrain her affection for\nSavrola, for above all she prayed for his return, that she might not be\nleft alone in the world.\n\nHer love seemed all that was left to her now, but with it life was more\nreal and strongly coloured than in the cold days at the palace amid\nsplendour, power, and admiration.  She had found what she had lacked,\nand so had he.  With her it was as if the rising sunbeam had struck the\nrainbow from the crystal prism, or flushed the snow peak with rose,\norange, and violet.  With Savrola, in the fierce glow of love the\nsteady blue-white fires of ambition had become invisible.  The human\nsoul is subjected to many refining agents in the world's crucible.  He\nwas sensible of a change of mood and thought; no longer would he wave\nhis hat at Fate; to his courage he had now added caution.  From the\nmoment when he had seen that poor, hideous figure lying on the steps of\nthe palace, he had felt the influence of other forces in his life.\nOther interests, other hopes, other aspirations had entered his mind.\nHe searched for different ideals and a new standard of happiness.\n\nVery worn and very weary he made his way to his rooms.  The strain of\nthe preceding twenty-four hours had been tremendous, and the anxieties\nwhich he felt for the future were keen.  The step he had taken in\noverruling the Council and sending the prisoners into foreign territory\nwas one the results of which he could not quite estimate.  It was, he\nwas convinced, the only course; and for the consequences he did not\ngreatly care, so far as he himself was concerned.  He thought of\nMoret,--poor, brave, impetuous Moret, who would have set the world\nright in a day.  The loss of such a friend had been a severe one to\nhim, privately and politically.  Death had removed the only\ndisinterested man, the only one on whom he could lean in the hour of\nneed.  A sense of weariness, of disgust with struggling, of desire for\npeace filled his soul.  The object for which he had toiled so long was\nnow nearly attained and it seemed of little worth, of little\ncomparative worth, that is to say, beside Lucile.\n\nAs a Revolutionist he had long made such arrangements with his property\nas to make sure of a competence in another land, if he had to fly\nLaurania; and a strong wish to leave that scene of strife and carnage\nand to live with the beautiful woman who loved him took possession of\nhis mind.  It was, however, his first duty to establish a government in\nthe place of that he had overthrown.  Yet when he reflected on the\ncross-grained delegates, the mean pandering crowd of office-seekers,\nthe weak, distrustful, timid colleagues, he hardly felt that he cared\nto try; so great was the change that a few hours had worked in this\ndetermined and aspiring man.\n\nLucile rose to meet him as he entered.  Fate had indeed driven them\ntogether, for she had no other hope in life, nor was there anyone to\nwhom she could turn for help.  Yet she looked at him with terror.\n\nHis quick mind guessed her doubt.  \"I tried to save him,\" he said; \"but\nI was too late, though I was wounded in taking a short cut there.\"\n\nShe saw his bandaged arm, and looked at him with love.  \"Do you despise\nme very much?\" she asked.\n\n\"No,\" he replied; \"I would not marry a goddess.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" she said, \"a philosopher.\"\n\nThen they kissed each other, and thenceforward their relationship was\nsimple.\n\nBut in spite of the labours of the day Savrola had no time for rest.\nThere was much to do, and, like all men who have to work at a terrible\npressure for a short period, he fell back on the resources of medicine.\nHe went to a little cabinet in the corner of the room and poured\nhimself out a potent drug, something that would dispense with sleep and\ngive him fresh energy and endurance.  Then he sat down and began to\nwrite orders and instructions and to sign the pile of papers he had\nbrought with him from the Mayoralty.  Lucile, seeing him thus employed,\nbetook herself to her room.\n\nIt was about one o'clock in the morning when there came a ringing at\nthe bell.  Savrola, mindful of the old nurse, ran down and opened the\ndoor himself.  Tiro, in plain clothes, entered.  \"I have come to warn\nyou,\" he said.\n\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Someone has informed the Council that you have released the prisoners.\nThey have summoned an urgency meeting.  Do you think you can hold them?\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said Savrola pensively.  Then after a pause he added, \"I\nwill go and join them.\"\n\n\"There are stages laid by road to the frontier,\" said the Subaltern.\n\"The President made me arrange them in case he should wish to send Her\nExcellency away.  If you decide to give up the game you can escape by\nthese; they will hold them to my warrant.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Savrola.  \"It is good of you to think of it; but I have\nsaved this people from tyranny and must now try to save them from\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"You have saved the lives of my brother-officers,\" said the boy; \"you\ncan count on me.\"\n\nSavrola looked at him and an idea struck him.  \"These relays were\nordered to convey Her Excellency to neutral territory; they had better\nbe so used.  Will you conduct her?\"\n\n\"Is she in this house?\" inquired the Subaltern.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Savrola bluntly.\n\nTiro laughed; he was not in the least scandalised.  \"I am beginning to\nlearn more politics every day,\" he said.\n\n\"You wrong me,\" said Savrola; \"but will you do as I ask?\"\n\n\"Certainly, when shall I start?\"\n\n\"When can you?\"\n\n\"I will bring the travelling-coach round in half-an-hour.\"\n\n\"Do,\" said Savrola.  \"I am grateful to you.  We have been through\nseveral experiences together.\"\n\nThey shook hands warmly, and the Subaltern departed to get the carriage.\n\nSavrola went up-stairs and, knocking at Lucile's door, informed her of\nthe plan.  She implored him to come with her.\n\n\"Indeed I wish I could,\" he said; \"I am sick of this; but I owe it to\nthem to see it out.  Power has little more attraction for me.  I will\ncome as soon as things are settled, and we can then be married and live\nhappily ever afterwards.\"\n\nBut neither his cynical chaff nor arguments prevailed.  She threw her\narms round his neck and begged him not to desert her.  It was a sore\ntrial.  At last with an aching heart he tore himself away, put on his\nhat and coat, and started for the Mayoralty.\n\nThe distance was about three quarters of a mile.  He had accomplished\nabout half of this when he met a patrol of the rebel forces under an\nofficer.  They called on him to halt.  He pulled his hat down over his\neyes, not wishing for the moment to be recognised.  The officer stepped\nforward.  It was the wounded man to whom Savrola had entrusted the\nescorting of the prisoners after the surrender of the palace.\n\n\"How far are we away from the Plaza San Marco?\" he asked in a loud\nvoice.\n\n\"It is there,\" said Savrola pointing.  \"Twenty-third Street is the\nnumber.\"\n\nThe rebel knew him at once.  \"March on,\" he said to his men, and the\npatrol moved off.  \"Sir,\" he added to Savrola, in the low, quick voice\nof a man in moments of resolve, \"I have a warrant from the Council for\nyour arrest.  They will deliver you to the Admiral.  Fly, while there\nis time.  I will take my men by a roundabout way, which will give you\ntwenty minutes.  Fly; it may cost me dear, but we are comrades; you\nsaid so.\"  He touched Savrola's wounded arm.  Then louder to the\npatrol: \"Turn down that street to the right: we had better get out of\nthe main thoroughfare; he may sneak off by some lane or other.\"  Then\nagain to Savrola: \"There are others coming, do not delay;\" and with\nthat he hurried after his men.  Savrola paused for a moment.  To go on\nwas imprisonment, perhaps death; to return, meant safety and Lucile.\nHad it been the preceding day, he would have seen the matter out; but\nhis nerves had been strained for many hours,--and nothing stood between\nthem now.  He turned and hurried back to his house.\n\nThe travelling-coach stood at the door.  The Subaltern had helped\nLucile, weeping, into it.  Savrola called to him.  \"I have decided to\ngo,\" he said.\n\n\"Capital!\" replied Tiro.  \"Leave these pigs to cut each other's\nthroats; they will come to their senses presently.\"\n\nSo they started, and as they toiled up the long ascent of the hills\nbehind the city, it became daylight.\n\n\"Miguel denounced you,\" said the Subaltern; \"I heard it at the\nMayoralty.  I told you he would let you in.  You must try and get quits\nwith him some day.\"\n\n\"I never waste revenge on such creatures,\" replied Savrola; \"they are\ntheir own damnation.\"\n\nAt the top of the hill the carriage stopped, to let the panting horses\nget their wind.  Savrola opened the door and stepped out.  Four miles\noff, and it seemed far below him, lay the city he had left.  Great\ncolumns of smoke rose from the conflagrations and hung, a huge black\ncloud in the still clear air of the dawn.  Beneath the long rows of\nwhite houses could be seen the ruins of the Senate, the gardens, and\nthe waters of the harbour.  The warships lay in the basin, their guns\ntrained upon the town.  The picture was a terrible one; to this pass\nhad the once beautiful city been reduced.\n\nA puff of white smoke sprang from a distant ironclad, and after a while\nthe dull boom of a heavy gun was heard.  Savrola took out his watch; it\nwas six o'clock; the Admiral had kept his appointment with scrupulous\npunctuality.  The forts, many of whose guns had been moved during the\nnight to the landward side, began to reply to the fire of the ships,\nand the cannonade became general.  The smoke of other burning houses\nrose slowly to join the black, overhanging cloud against which the\nbursting shells showed white with yellow flashes.\n\n\"And that,\" said Savrola after prolonged contemplation, \"is my life's\nwork.\"\n\nA gentle hand touched his arm.  He turned and saw Lucile standing by\nhim.  He looked at her in all her beauty, and felt that after all he\nhad not lived in vain.\n\n\nThose who care to further follow the annals of the Republic of Laurania\nmay read how, after the tumults had subsided, the hearts of the people\nturned again to the illustrious exile who had won them freedom, and\nwhom they had deserted in the hour of victory.  They may, scoffing at\nthe fickleness of men, read of the return of Savrola and his beautiful\nconsort, to the ancient city he had loved so well.  They may learn how\nLieutenant Tiro was decorated for his valour in the war with the little\nbronze Lauranian Cross which is respected all over the world; of how he\nled the Lancers' polo team to England according to his desire, and\ndefeated the Amalgamated Millionaires in the final match for the Open\nCup; of how he served the Republic faithfully with honour and success\nand rose at last to the command of the army.  Of the old nurse, indeed,\nthey will read no more, for history does not concern itself with such.\nBut they may observe that Godoy and Renos both filled offices in the\nState suited to their talents, and that Savrola bore no malice to\nMiguel, who continued to enjoy good-fortune as a compensation for his\nmean and odious character.\n\nBut the chronicler, finding few great events, other than the opening of\ncolleges, railways, and canals, to recount, will remember the splendid\nsentence of Gibbon, that history is \"little more than the register of\nthe crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind\"; and he will rejoice\nthat, after many troubles, peace and prosperity came back to the\nRepublic of Laurania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Savrola, by Winston Spencer Churchill\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SAVROLA ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50906-8.txt or 50906-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/5\/0\/9\/0\/50906\/\n\nProduced by Al Haines\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1208,"split":"test"}
