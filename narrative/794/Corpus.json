Knowing the peoples they encounter may label their teachings as blasphemous, the fieldworkers attribute them to El Hassan, an imaginary leader who has incorporated the wisdom of all the sages and prophets of the world. On their way back from working at a Tuareg encampment, the fieldworkers are attacked by an Arab Union convoy trespassing on Reunited Nations territory and, in defending themselves, kill all the Arab troopers. The team then proceeds to a council of nomad tribes with the intention of arresting one of its leaders, Adb-el-Kader, for ordering raids on Reunited Nations projects, and find that Adb-el-Kader is now inciting the rest of the clans to bloody rebellion. Homer Crawford challenges Adb-el-Kader to a sword duel, disables him with a judo move, and arrests him.\nNext, Crawford's team travels to Timbuktu to attend a conference with other all-black teams providing foreign aid in North Africa. There, Crawford makes a case for cooperation across teams regardless of political or national background based on the fact that all the fieldworkers are of African descent and so are deeply invested in helping to advance Africa. Some fieldworkers, including Isobel Cunningham, Jake Armstrong, and Cliff Jackson of the Africa for Africans Association (AFAA) and the British agent Rex Donaldson are in favor of such coordination. Others, including a C.I.A. operative Fred Ostrander, object strongly to it. After the meeting is adjourned, Isobel and Homer discuss the points presented at the meeting with Homer admitting that their dissemination of Western ideology will ultimately destroy the present North African cultures, but that their work must continue so that Africa does not become a liability to the world. As they take a stroll, a sniper on a minaret attempts to assassinate Homer and seemingly gets away.\nCrawford's team is sent to Mopti to defuse a demonstration for El Hassan. The AFAA fieldworkers tag along to observe their tactics. On the way, Homer and Isobel are perturbed by the realization that what the fieldwork of foreign aid organizations is equivalent to the white man's destruction of indigenous cultures in North America. After the job at Mopti, Homer leaves with his second-in-command, Abe Baker, for Dakar, where Homer thwarts a second assassination attempt: this time, his brandy has been laced with cyanide. At headquarters, his team is given a new assignment: to locate the mysterious subversive El Hassan so the Reunited Nations can back him as a figure under which North Africans can unite. Unsure about how to proceed, Homer requests some time to consider the mission and confers with Abe and Isobel. Abe attempts to convince Homer that he is the natural choice to become El Hassan; he then announces he is a Party member of the Soviet Complex and that he would like Homer to secretly become one, causing Homer to realize that Abe is his would-be assassin. Once exposed, Abe attempts to kill Homer. Isobel is revealed to be a Party member of the Soviet Complex also, but she refuses to help Abe kill Homer. Homer, unwillingly, kills Abe with a karate blow to the windpipe. Isobel pledges herself to Homer as the first follower of El Hassan and is given the mission to convert Jake and Cliff to the cause.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Black Man's Burden, by Dallas McCord Reynolds\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Not until the people of Africa know they are\n     Africans--not warring tribesmen--will there be peace....\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe two-vehicle caravan emerged from the sandy wastes of the _erg_ and\napproached the small encampment of Taitoq Tuareg which consisted of\nseven goat leather tents. They were not unanticipated, the camp's scouts\nhad noted the strange pillars of high-flung dust which were set up by\nthe air rotors an hour earlier and for the past fifteen minutes they had\nbeen visible to all.\n\nMoussa-ag-Amastan, headman of the clan, awaited the newcomers at first\nwith a certain trepidation in spite of his warrior blood. Although he\nhadn't expressed himself thus to his followers, his first opinion had\nbeen that the unprecedented pillars were djinn come out of the erg for\nno good purpose. It wasn't until they were quite close that it could be\nseen the vehicles bore resemblance to those of the Rouma which were of\nrecent years spreading endlessly through the lands of the Ahaggar Tuareg\nand beggaring those who formerly had conducted the commerce of the\nSahara.\n\nBut the vehicles traveling through the sand dunes! That had been the\nlast advantage of the camel. No wheeled vehicle could cross the vast\nstretches of the ergs, they must stick to the hard ground, to the\ntire-destroying gravel.\n\nThey came to a halt and Moussa-ag-Amastan drew up his teguelmoust\nturban-veil even closer about his eyes. He had no desire to let the\nnewcomers witness his shocked surprise at the fact that the desert\nlorries had no wheels, floated instead without support, and now that\nthey were at a standstill settled gently to earth.\n\nThere was further surprise when the five who issued forth from the two\nseemingly clumsy vehicles failed to be Rouma. They looked more like the\nTeda to the south, and the Targui's eyes thinned beneath his\nteguelmoust. Since the French had pulled out their once dreaded Camel\nCorps there had been somewhat of a renaissance of violence between\ntraditional foes.\n\nHowever, the newcomers, though dark as Negro Bela slaves, wore Tuareg\ndress, loose baggy trousers of dark indigo-blue cotton cloth, a loose,\nnightgownlike white cotton shirt, and over this a _gandoura_ outer\ngarment. Above all, they wore the teguelmoust though they were\nshockingly lax in keeping it properly up about the mouth.\n\nMoussa-ag-Amastan knew that he was backed by ten or more of his\nclansmen, half of whom bore rifles, the rest Tuareg broadswords,\nCrusader-like with their two edges, round points and flat rectangular\ncross-members. Only two of the strangers seemed armed and they\nnegligently bore their smallish guns in the crooks of their arms. The\nclan leader spoke at strength, then, but he said the traditional \"_La\nbas_.\"\n\n\"There is no evil,\" repeated the foremost of the newcomers. His Tamabeq,\nthe Berber language of the Tuareg confederations, seemed perfect.\n\nMoussa-ag-Amastan said, \"What do you do in the lands of the Taitoq\nTuareg?\"\n\nThe stranger, a tall, handsome man with a dominating though pleasant\npersonality, indicated the vehicles with a sweep of his hand. \"We are\nEnaden, itinerant smiths. As has ever been our wont, we travel from\nencampment to encampment to sell our products and to make repair upon\nyour metal possessions.\"\n\nEnaden! The traveling smiths of the Ahaggar, and indeed of the whole\nSahara, were a despised and ragged lot at best. Few there were that ever\npossessed more than a small number of camels, a sprinkling of goats,\nperhaps a sheep or two. But these seemed as rich as Roumas, as Europeans\nor Americans.\n\nMoussa-ag-Amastan muttered, \"You jest with us at your peril, stranger.\"\nHe pointed an aged but still strong hand at the vehicles. \"Enaden do not\nown such as these.\"\n\nThe newcomer shrugged. \"I am Omar ben Crawf and these are my followers,\nAbrahim el Bakr Ma el Ainin, Keni Ballalou and Bey-ag-Akhamouk. We come\ntoday from Tamanrasset and we are smiths, as we can prove. As is known,\nthere is high pay to be earned by working in the oil fields, at the dams\non the Niger, in the afforestation projects, in the sinking of the new\nwells whose pumps utilize the rays of the sun, in the developing of the\ngreat new oases. There is much Rouma money to be made in such work and\nmy men and I have brought these vehicles specially built in the new\nfactories in Dakar for desert use.\"\n\n\"Slave work!\" one of Moussa-ag-Amastan's kinsmen sneered.\n\nOmar ben Crawf shrugged in obvious amusement, but there was a warmth and\nvitality in the man that quickly affected even strangers. \"Perhaps,\" he\nsaid. \"But times change, as every man knows and today there no longer\nneed be hunger, nor illness, nor any want--if a man will but work a\nfraction of each day.\"\n\n\"Work is for slaves,\" Moussa-ag-Amastan barked.\n\nThe newcomer refused to argue. \"But all slaves have been freed, and\nwhere in the past this meant nothing since the Bela had no place to go,\nno way to live save with his owner, today it is different and any man\ncan go and find work on the many projects that grow everywhere. So the\nslaves slip away from the Tuareg, and the Teda and Chaamba. Soon there\nwill be no more slaves to do the work about your encampments. And then\nwhat, man of the desert?\"\n\n\"We'll fight!\" Moussa-ag-Amastan growled. \"We Tuareg are warriors,\nbedouin, free men. We will never be slaves.\"\n\n\"_Inshallah._ If God wills it,\" the smith agreed politely.\n\n\"Show us your wares,\" the old chieftain snapped. \"We chatter like women.\nTalk can wait until the evening meal and in the men's quarters of my\ntent.\" He approached the now parked vehicles and his followers crowded\nafter him. From the tents debouched women and children. The children\nwere completely nude, and the Tuareg women were unveiled for such are\nthe customs of the Ahaggar Tuareg that the men go veiled but women do\nnot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the lorries was so constructed that a side could be raised in\nsuch fashion to display a wide variety of tools, weapons, household\nutensils, and textiles. Ohs and ahs punctuated the air, women being the\nsame in every land. Two of the smiths brought forth metal-working\nequipment of strange design and set up shop to one side. A broken bolt\non an aged Lebel rifle was quickly repaired, a copper cooking pot\nbrazed, some harness tinkered with.\n\nOf a sudden, Moussa-ag-Amastan said, \"But your women, your families,\nwhere are they?\"\n\nThe one who had been introduced as Abrahim el Bakr, an open-faced man\nwhose constant smiling seemed to take a full ten years off what must\nhave been his age, explained. \"On the big projects, one can find\nemployment only if he allows his children to attend the new schools. So\nour wives and children remain near Tamanrasset while the children learn\nthe lore of books.\"\n\n\"Rouma schools!\" one of the warriors sneered.\n\n\"Oh, no. There are few Roumas remaining in all the land now,\" the smith\nsaid easily. \"Those that are left serve us in positions our people as\nyet cannot hold, in construction of the dams, in the bringing of trees\nto the desert, but soon, even they will be unneeded.\"\n\n\"_Our_ people?\" Moussa-ag-Amastan rumbled ungraciously. \"You are smiths.\nThe smiths have no people. You are neither Kel Rela, T\u00c3\u00a9geh\u00c3\u00a9 Mellet,\nTaitoq, nor even Teda, Chaambra, or Ouled Tidrarin.\"\n\nOne of the smiths said easily, \"In the great new construction camps, in\nthe new towns, with their many ways to work and become rich, the tribes\nare breaking up. Tuareg works next to Teda and a Moor next to a former\nHaratin serf.\" He added, as though unthinkingly, even as he displayed an\naluminum pan to a wide-eyed Tuareg matron, \"Indeed, even the clans break\nup and often Tuareg marries Arab or Sudanese or Rifs down from the\nnorth ... or even we Enaden.\"\n\nThe clansmen were suddenly silent, in shocked surprise.\n\n\"That cannot be true!\" the elderly chief snapped.\n\nOmar ben Crawf looked at him mildly. \"Why should my follower lie?\"\n\n\"I do not know, but we will talk of it later, away from the women and\nchildren who should not hear such abominations.\" The chief switched\nsubjects. \"But you have no flocks with you. How are we to pay for these\nthings, these services?\"\n\n\"With money.\"\n\nThe old man's face, what little could be seen through his teguelmoust,\ndarkened. \"We have little money in the Ahaggar.\"\n\nThe one named Omar nodded. \"But we are short of meat and will buy\nseveral goats and perhaps a lamb, a chicken, eggs. Then, too, as you\nhave noted, we have left our women at home. We will need the services of\ncooks, some one to bring water. We will hire servants.\"\n\nThe other said gruffly, \"There are some Bela who will serve you.\"\n\nThe smith seemed taken aback. \"Verily, El Hassan has stated that the\nproduct of the labor of the slave is accursed.\"\n\n\"El Hassan! Who is El Hassan and why should the work of a slave be\naccursed?\"\n\nOne of the tribesmen said, \"I have heard of this El Hassan. Rumors of\nhis teachings spread through the land. He is to lead us all, Tuareg,\nArab and Sudanese, until we are all as rich as Roumas.\"\n\nOmar said, \"It is well known that the Roumas and especially the\nAmericans are all rich as Emirs but none of them ever possess slaves.\nThe bedouin have slaves but fail to prosper. Verily, the product of the\nlabor of the slave is accursed.\"\n\n\"Madness,\" Moussa-ag-Amastan muttered. \"If you do not let our slave\nwomen do your tasks, then they will remain undone. No Tuareg woman will\nwork.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the headman of his clan was wrong.\n\nThe smiths remained four days in all, and the abundance of their\nproducts was too much. What verbal battles might have taken place in the\ntent of Moussa-ag-Amastan, and in those of his followers, the smiths\ncouldn't know, but Tuareg women are not dominated by their men. On the\nsecond day, three Tuareg women applied for the position of servants, at\nsurprisingly high pay. Envy ran roughshod when they later displayed the\ntextiles and utensils they purchased with their wages.\n\nNor could the aged Tuareg chief prevent in the evening discussions\nbetween the men, a thorough pursuing of the new ideas sweeping through\nthe Ahaggar. Though these strangers proclaimed themselves lowly\nEnaden--itinerant desert smiths--they were obviously not to be dismissed\nas a caste little higher than Haratin serfs. Even the first night they\nwere invited to the tent of Moussa-ag-Amastan to share the dinner of\nshorba soup, cous cous and the edible paste _kaboosh_, made of cheese,\nbutter and spices. It was an adequate desert meal, meat being eaten not\nmore than a few times a year by such as the Taitoq Tuareg who couldn't\nafford to consume the animals upon which they lived.\n\nAfter mint tea, one of the younger Tarqui leaned forward. He said, \"You\nhave brought strange news, oh Enaden of wealth, and we would know more.\nWe of the Ahaggar hear little from outside.\"\n\nMoussa-ag-Amastan scowled at his clansman, for his presumption, but Omar\nanswered, his voice sincere and carrying conviction. \"The world moves\nfast, men of the desert, and the things that were verily true even\nyesterday, have changed today.\"\n\n\"To the sorrow of the Tuareg!\" snapped Moussa-ag-Amastan.\n\nThe other looked at him. \"Not always, old one. Surely in your youth you\nremember when such diseases as the one the Roumas once called the\ndisease of Venus, ran rampant through the tribes. When trachoma, the\nsickness of the eyes, was known as the scourge of the Sahara. When half\nthe children, not only of Bela slaves and Haratin serfs, but also of the\nSurgu noble clans, died before the age of ten.\"\n\n\"Admittedly, the magic of the Roumas cured many such ills,\" an older\nwarrior growled.\n\n\"Not their magic, their learning,\" the smith named El Ma el Ainin put\nin. \"And, verily, now the schools are open to all the people.\"\n\n\"Schools are not for such as the Bela and Haratin,\" the clan chief\nprotested. \"The Koran should not be taught to slaves.\"\n\nEl Ma el Ainin said gently, \"The Koran is not taught at all in the new\nschools, old one. The teachings of the Prophet are still made known to\nthose interested, in the schools connected with the mosques, but only\nthe teachings of science are made in the new schools.\"\n\n\"The teachings of the Rouma!\" a Tuareg protested, carefully slipping his\nglass of tea beneath his teguelmoust so that he could drink without his\nmouth being obscenely revealed.\n\nOmar ben Crawf laughed. \"That is what we have allowed the Roumas to have\nus believe for much too long,\" he stated. \"El Hassan has proven\notherwise. Much of the wisdom of science has its roots in the lands of\nAsia and of Africa. The Roumas were savages in skins while the earliest\ncivilizations were being developed in Africa and Asia Minor. Hardly a\nscience now developed by the Roumas of Europe and America but had its\nbeginning with us.\" He turned to the elderly chief.\n\n\"You Tuareg are of Berber background. But a few centuries ago, the\nBerbers of Morocco, known as the Moors to the Rouma, leavened only with\na handful of Jews and Arabs, built up in Spain the highest civilization\nin all the world of that time. We would be foolish, we of Africa, to\ngive credit to the Rouma for so much of what our ancestors presented to\nthe world.\"\n\nThe Tuareg were astonished. They had never heard such words.\n\nMoussa-ag-Amastan was not appeased. \"You sound like a Rouma, yourself,\"\nhe said. \"Where have you learned of all this?\"\n\nThe smiths chuckled their amusement.\n\nAbrahim el Bakr said, \"Verily, old one, have you ever seen a black\nRouma?\"\n\nOmar ben Crawf, the headman of the smiths, went on. \"El Hassan has\nproclaimed great new beliefs that spread through all North Africa, and\neventually, _Inshallah_, throughout the continent. Through his great\nlearning he has assimilated the wisdom of all the prophets, all the\nwisemen of all the world, and proclaims their truths.\"\n\nThe Tuareg chief was becoming increasingly irritated. Such talk as this\nwas little short of blasphemy to his ears, but the fascination of the\ndiscussion was beyond him to ignore. And he knew that even if he did his\nyoung men, in particular, would only seek out the strangers on their own\nand then he would not be present to mitigate their interest. In spite of\nhimself, now he growled, \"What beliefs? What truths? I know not of this\nEl Hassan of whom you speak.\"\n\nOmar said slowly, \"Among them, the teachings of a great wise man from a\nfar land. That all men should be considered equal in the eyes of society\nand should have equal right to life, liberty and the pursuit of\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"Equal!\" one of the warriors ejaculated. \"This is not wisdom, but\nnonsense. No two men are equal.\"\n\nOmar waggled a finger negatively. \"Like so many, you fail to explore the\nteaching. Obviously, no man of wisdom would contend that all men are\nequally tall, or strong, or wise, or cunning, nor even fortunate. _No_\ntwo men are equal in such regards. But all men should have equal right\nto life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, whatever that might mean\nto him as an individual.\"\n\nOne of the Tuareg said slyly, \"And the murderer of one of your kinsmen,\nshould he, too, have life and liberty, in the belief of El Hassan?\"\n\n\"Obviously, the community must protect itself against those who would\ndestroy the life or liberty of others. The murderer of a kinsman of\nmine, as well as any other man, myself included, should be subject\nequally to the same law.\"\n\nIt was a new conception to members of a tribal society such as that of\nthe Ahaggar Tuareg. They stirred under both its appeal and its negation\nof all they knew. A man owed alliance to his immediate family, to his\nclan, his tribe, then to the Tuareg confederation--in decreasing degree.\nBeyond that, all were enemies, as all men knew.\n\nOne protested slowly, seeking out his words, \"Your El Hassan preaches\nthis equality, but surely the wiser man and the stronger man will soon\nfind his way to the top in any land, in any tribe, even in the nations\nof the Rouma.\"\n\nOmar shrugged. \"Who could contend otherwise? But each man should be free\nto develop his own possibilities, be they strength of arm or of brain.\nLet no man exploit another, nor suppress another's abilities. If a Bela\nslave has more ability than a Surgu Tuareg noble, let him profit to the\nfull by his gifts.\"\n\nThere was a cold silence.\n\nOmar finished gently by saying, \"Or so El Hassan teaches, and so they\nteach in the new schools in Tamanrasset and Gao, in Timbuktu and Reggan,\nin the big universities at Kano, Dakar, Bamako, Accra and Abidian. And\nthroughout North Africa the wave of the future flows over the land.\"\n\n\"It is a flood of evil,\" Moussa-ag-Amastan said definitely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut in spite of the antagonism of the clan headman and of the older\nTuareg warriors, the stories of the smiths continued to spread. It was\nnot even beyond them to discuss, long and quietly, with the Bela slaves\nthe ideas of the mysterious El Hassan, and to talk of the plentiful\njobs, the high wages, at the dams, the new oases, and in the\nafforestation projects.\n\nSomehow the news of their presence spread, and another clan of nomad\nTuareg arrived and pitched their tents, to handle the wares of the\nsmiths and to bring their metal work for repair. And to listen to their\ndisturbing words.\n\nAs amazing as any of the new products was the solar powered, portable\ntelevision set which charged its batteries during the daylight hours and\nthen flashed on its screen the images and the voices and music of\nentertainers and lecturers, teachers and storytellers, for all to see.\nIn the beginning it had been difficult, for the eye of the desert man is\nnot trained to pick up a picture. He has never seen one, and would not\nrecognize his own photograph. But in time, it came to them.\n\nThe programs originated in Tamanrasset and in Salah, in Zinder and Fort\nLamy and one of the smiths revealed that the mysterious waves, that fed\nthe device its programs, were bounced off tiny moons which the Rouma had\nrocketed up into the sky for that purpose. A magic understandable only\nto marabouts and such, without doubt.\n\nAt the end of their period of stay, the smiths, to the universal\nsurprise of all, gave the mystery device to two sisters, kinswomen of\nMoussa-ag-Amastan, who were particularly interested in the teachers and\nlecturers who told of the new world aborning. The gift was made in the\nfull understanding that all should be allowed to listen and watch, and\nit was clear that if ever the set needed repair it was to be left\nuntinkered with and taken to Tamanrasset or the nearest larger\nsettlement where it would be fixed free of charge.\n\nThere were many strange features about the smiths, as each man could\nsee. Among others, were their strange weapons. There had been some soft\nwhispered discussion among the warriors in the first two days of their\nstay about relieving the strangers of their obviously desirable\npossessions--after all, they weren't kinsmen, not even Tuareg. But on\nthe second day, the always smiling one named Abrahim el Bakr had been on\nthe outskirts of the _erg_ when a small group of gazelle were flushed.\nThe graceful animals took off at a prohibitive rifle range, as usual,\nbut Abrahim el Bakr had thrown his small, all but tiny weapon to his\nshoulder and _flic flic flic_, with a sound no greater than the cracking\nof a ground nut, had knocked over three of them before the others had\ndisappeared around a dune.\n\nObviously, the weapons of the smiths were as great as their learning and\ntheir new instruments. It was discouraging to a raider by instinct.\n\nThen, too, there was the strangeness of the night talks their leader was\nknown to have with his secret _Kambu_ fetish which was able to answer\nhim in a squeaky but distinct voice in some unknown tongue, obviously a\nlanguage of the djinn. The _Kambu_ was worn on a strap on Omar's wrist,\nand each night at a given hour he was wont to withdraw to his tent and\nthere confer.\n\nOn the fourth night, obviously, he was given instruction by the _Kambu_\nfor in the morning, at first light, the smiths hurriedly packed, broke\ncamp, made their good-byes to Moussa-ag-Amastan and the others and were\noff.\n\nMoussa-ag-Amastan was glad to see them go. They were quite the most\ndisturbing element to upset his people in many seasons. He wondered at\nthe advisability of making their usual summer journey to the Tuareg\nsedentary centers. He had a feeling that if the clan got near enough to\nsuch centers as Zinder to the south, or Touggourt to the north, there\nwould be wholesale desertion of the Bela, and, for that matter, even of\nsome of his younger warriors and their wives.\n\nHowever, there was no putting off indefinitely exposure to this danger.\nEven in such former desert centers as Tessalit and In Salah, the\nirrigation projects were of such magnitude that there was a great labor\nshortage. But always, of course, as the smiths had said, if you worked\nat the projects your children must needs attend the schools. And that\nway lay disaster!\n\nThe five smiths took out overland in the direction of Djanet on the\nborder of what had once been known as Libya and famed for its cliffs\nwhich tower over twenty-five hundred feet above the town. Their solar\npowered, air cushion, hover-lorries, threw up their clouds of dust and\nsand to right and left, but they made good time over the _erg_. A good\nhovercraft driver could do much to even out a rolling landscape,\nchanging his altitude from a few inches here to as much as twenty-five\nfeet there, given, of course, enough power in his solar batteries,\nalthough that was little problem in this area where clouds were\nsometimes not seen for years on end.\n\nThis was back of the beyond, the wasteland of earth. Only the interior\nof the Arabian peninsula and the Gobi could compete and, of course, even\nthe Gobi was beginning to be tamed under the afforestation efforts of\nthe teeming multitudes of China who had suffered its disastrous storms\ndown through the millennia.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOmar checked and checked again with the instrument on his wrist, asking\nand answering, his voice worried.\n\nFinally they pulled up beside a larger than usual wadi and Omar ben\nCrawf stared thoughtfully out over it. The one they had named Abrahim el\nBakr stood beside him and the others slightly to the rear.\n\nAbrahim el Bakr nodded, for once his face unsmiling. \"Those cats'll come\ndown here,\" he said. \"Nothing else would make sense, not even to an\nEgyptian.\"\n\n\"I think you're right,\" Omar growled. He said over his shoulder, \"Bey,\nget the trucks out of sight, over that dune. Elmer, you and Kenny set\nthe gun up over there. Solid slugs, and try to avoid their cargo. We\ndon't want to set off a Fourth of July here. Bey, when you're finished\nwith the trucks, take that Tommy-Noiseless of yours and flank them from\nover behind those rocks. Take a couple of clips extra, for good\nluck--you won't need them, though.\"\n\n\"How many are there supposed to be?\" Abrahim el Bakr asked, his voice\nempty of humor now.\n\n\"Eight half-trucks, two armed jeeps, or land-rovers, one or the other.\nProbably about forty men, Abe.\"\n\n\"All armed,\" Abe said flatly.\n\n\"Um-m-m. Listen, that's them coming. Right down the _wadi_. Get going\nmen. Abe, you cover me.\"\n\nAbe Bakr looked at him. \"Wha'd'ya mean, cover you, man? You slipped all\nthe way round the bend? Listen, let me plant a couple quick land mines\nto stop 'em and we'll get ourselves behind these rocks and blast those\ncats half way back to Cairo.\"\n\n\"We'll warn them as per orders.\"\n\n\"Crazy man, like you're the boss, Homer,\" Abe growled. \"But why'd I ever\nleave New Jersey?\" He made his way to the right, to the top of the\nwadi's bank and behind a clump of thorny bush. He made himself\ncomfortable, the light Tommy-Noiseless with its clip of two hundred .10\ncaliber, ultra-high velocity shells resting before him on a flat rock\noutcropping. He thoughtfully flicked the selector to the explosive side\nof the clip. Let Homer Crawford say what he would about not setting off\na Fourth of July, but if he needed covering in the moments to come, he'd\nneed it bad.\n\nThe chips were down now.\n\nThe convoy, the motors growling their protests of the hard going even\nhere at the gravel bottomed wadi river bed, made its way toward them at\na pace of approximately twenty kilometers per hour.\n\nThe lead jeep--Skoda manufacture, Homer Crawford noted cynically--was\nsome thirty meters in advance. It drew to a halt upon seeing him and a\nturbaned Arab Union trooper swung a Brenn gun in his direction.\n\nAn officer stood up in the jeep and yelled at Crawford in Arabic.\n\nThe American took a deep breath and said in the same language, \"You're\nout of your own territory.\"\n\nThe officer's face went poker-expressionless. He looked at the lone\nfigure, dressed in the garb of the Tuareg, even to the turban-veil which\ncovers all but the eyes of these notorious Apaches of the Sahara.\n\n\"This is no affair of yours,\" the lieutenant said. \"Who are you?\"\n\nHomer Crawford said very clearly, \"Sahara Division, African Development\nProject, Reunited Nations. You're far out of your own territory,\nlieutenant. I'll have to report you, and also to demand that you turn\nand go back to your origin.\"\n\nThe lieutenant flicked his hand, and the trooper behind the Brenn gun\nsighted the weapon and tightened his trigger finger.\n\nCrawford dropped to the ground and rolled desperately for a slight\ndepression that would provide cover. He could have saved himself the\nresultant bruises and scratches. Before the Brenn gun spoke even once,\nthere was a _G\u00c3\u00b6tterdammerung_ of sound and the three occupants of the\njeep, driver, lieutenant and gunner were swept from the vehicle in a\nnauseating obscenity of exploding flesh, uniform cloth, blood and bone.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTo the side, Abe Bakr behind his thorn bush and rock vantage point\nturned the barrel of his Tommy-Noiseless to the first of the half\ntracks. Already Arab Union troopers were debouching from them, some\nfiring at random and at unseen targets. However, the so-called Enaden\nsmiths were well concealed, their weapons silenced except for the\nexplosion of the tiny shells upon reaching their target.\n\nIt wasn't much of a fight. The recoilless automatic rifle manned by\nElmer Allen and Kenny Ballalou swept the wadi, swept it of life, at\nleast, but hardly swept it clean. What few individuals were left, in\nwhat little shelter was to be found in the dry river's bottom, were\npicked off easily, if not neatly by the high velocity automatics in the\nhands of Abe Bakr and Bey-ag-Akhamouk.\n\nAfterwards, the five of them, standing at the side of the wadi, stared\ndown at their work.\n\nElmer Allen muttered a bitter four-letter obscenity. He had once headed\na pacifist group at the University in Kingston, Jamaica. Now his teeth\nwere bared, as they always were when he went into action. He hated it.\n\nOf them all, Bey-ag-Ahkamouk was the least moved by the slaughter. He\ngrumbled, \"Guns, explosives, mortar, flame throwers. If there is\nanything in the world my people don't need in the way of _aid_, it's\nweapons.\"\n\n\"Our people,\" Homer Crawford said absently, his eyes--taking in the\nscene beneath them--empty, as though unseeing. He hated the need for\nkilling, almost as badly as did Elmer Allen.\n\nBey looked at him, scowling slightly, but said nothing. There had been\nmild rebuke in his leader's voice.\n\n\"Well,\" Abe Bakr said with a tone of mock finality in his voice, as\nthough he was personally wiping his hands of the whole affair, \"how are\nyou going to explain all this jazz to headquarters, man?\"\n\nHomer said flatly, \"We were attacked by this unidentified group of, ah,\ngun runners, from some unknown origin. We defended ourselves, to the\nbest of our ability.\"\n\nElmer Allen looked at the once human mess below them. \"We certainly\ndid,\" he muttered, scowling.\n\n\"Crazy man,\" Abe said, nodding his agreement to the alibi.\n\nThe others didn't bother to speak. Homer Crawford's unit was well knit.\n\nHe said after a moment. \"Abe, you and Kenny get some dynamite and plant\nit in this wadi wall in a few spots. We'll want to bury this whole mess.\nIt wouldn't do for someone to come along and blow himself up on some of\nthese scattered land mines, or find himself a bazooka or something to\nuse on his nearest blood-feud neighbor.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe young woman known as Izubahil was washing clothes in the Niger with\nthe rest but slightly on the outskirts of the chattering group of women,\nwhich was fitting since she was both a comparative stranger and as yet\nunselected by any man to grace his household. Which, in a way, was\npassingly strange since she was comely enough. Clad as the rest with\nnaught but a wrap of colored cloth about her hips, her face and figure\nwere openly to be seen. Her complexion was not quite so dark as most.\nShe came from up-river, so she said, the area of the Songhoi, but by the\nlooks of her there was more than average Arab or Berber blood in her\nveins. Her lips and nose were thinner than those of her neighbors.\n\nYes, it was strange that no man had taken her, though it was said that\nin her shyness she repulsed any advances made by either the young men,\nor their wealthier elders who could afford more than one wife. She was a\nnothing-woman, really, come out of the desert alone, and without\nrelatives to protect her interests, but still she repulsed the advances\nof those who would honor her with a place in their house, or tent.\n\nShe had come out of the desert, it was known, with her handful of\npossessions done up in a packet, and had quietly and unobtrusively taken\nher place in the Negro community of Gao. Little better than a slave or\nGabibi serf, she made her meager living doing small tasks for the\nbetter-off members of the community.\n\nBut she knew her place, was dutifully shy and quiet spoken, and in the\ntown or in the presence of men, wore her haik and veil. Yes, it was\npassing strange that she found no man. On the face of it, she was\ngetting no younger, surely she must be into her twenties.\n\nUp to their knees in the waters of the Niger, out beyond the point where\nthe dugout canoes were pulled up to the bank, their ends resting on the\nshore, they pounded their laundry. Laughing, chattering, gossiping. Life\nwas perhaps poor, but still life was good.\n\nSomeone pretended to see a crocodile and there was a wild scampering for\nthe shore. And then high laughter when the jest was revealed. Actually,\nall the time they had known it a jest, since it was their most popular\none--there were seldom crocodiles this far north in the Niger bend.\n\nThere was a stir as two men dressed in the clothes of the Rouma\napproached the river bank. It was not forbidden, but good manners called\nfor males to refrain from this area while the woman bathed and washed\ntheir laundry, without veil or upper garments. These mean were obviously\nshameless, and probably had come to stare. From their dress, their faces\nand their bearing, they were strangers. Possibly Senegalese, up from the\narea near Dakar, products of the new schools and the new industries\nmushrooming there. Strange things were told of the folk who gave up the\nold ways, worked on the dams and the other new projects, sent their\nlittle ones to the schools, and submitted to the needle pricks which\nseemed to compose so much of the magic medicine being taught in the\nmedical schools by the Rouma witchmen.\n\nOne of them spoke now in Songhoi, the _lingua franca_ of the vicinity.\nShamelessly he spoke to them, although none were his women, nor even his\ntribal kin. None looked at him.\n\n\"We seek a single woman, an unwed woman, who would work for pay and\nlearn the new ways.\"\n\nThey continued their laundry, not looking up, but their chatter dribbled\naway.\n\n\"She must drop the veil,\" the man continued clearly, \"and give up the\nhaik and wear the new clothes. But she will be well paid, and taught to\nread and be kept in the best of comfort and health.\"\n\nThere was a low gasp from several of the younger women, but one of the\neldest looked up in distaste. \"Wear the clothes of the Rouma!\" she said\nindignantly. \"Shameless ones!\"\n\nThe man's voice was testy. He himself was dressed in the clothing worn\nalways by the Rouma, when the Rouma had controlled the Niger bend. He\nsaid, \"These are not the clothes of the Rouma, but the clothes of\ncivilized people everywhere.\"\n\nThe women's attention went back to their washing. Two or three of them\ngiggled.\n\nThe elderly woman said, \"There are none here who will go with you, for\nwhatever shameless purpose you have in your mind.\"\n\nBut Izubahil, the strange girl come out of the desert from the north,\nspoke suddenly. \"I will,\" she said.\n\nThere was a gasp, and all looked at her in wide-eyed alarm. She began\nmaking her way to the shore, her unfinished washing still in hand.\n\nThe stranger said clearly, \"And drop the veil, discard the haik for the\nnew clothing, and attend the schools?\"\n\nThere was another gasp as Izubahil said definitely, \"Yes, all these\nthings.\" She looked back at the women. \"So that I may learn all these\nnew ways.\"\n\nThe more elderly sniffed and turned their backs in scorn, but the\nyounger stared after her in some amazement and until she disappeared\nwith the two strangers into one of the buildings which had formerly\nhoused the French Administration officers back in the days when the area\nwas known as the French Sudan.\n\nInside, the boy strangers turned to her and the one who had spoken at\nthe river bank said in English, \"How goes it?\"\n\n\"Heavens to Betsy,\" Isobel Cunningham said with a grin, \"get me a drink.\nIf I'd known majoring in anthropology was going to wind up with my doing\na strip tease with a bunch of natives in the Niger River, I would have\ntaken up Home Economics, like my dear old mother wanted!\"\n\nThey laughed with her and Jacob Armstrong, the older of the two, went\nover to a sideboard and mixed her a cognac and soda. \"Ice?\" he said.\n\n\"Brother, you said it,\" she told him. \"Where can I change out of these\nrags?\"\n\n\"On you they look good,\" Clifford Jackson told her. He looked\nsurprisingly like the Joe Louis of several decades earlier.\n\n\"That's enough out of you, wise guy,\" Isobel told him. \"Why doesn't\nsomebody dream up a role for me where I can be a rich paramount chief's\nfavorite wife, or something? Be loaded down with gold and jewelry, that\nsort of thing.\"\n\nJake brought her the drink. \"Your clothes are in there,\" he told her,\nmotioning with his head to an inner room. \"It wouldn't do the job,\" he\nadded. \"What we're giving them is the old Cinderella story.\" He looked\nat his watch. \"If we get under way, we can take the jet to Kabara and go\ninto your act there. It's been nearly six months since Kabara and\nthey'll be all set for the second act.\"\n\nShe knocked back the brandy and made her way to the other room, saying\nover her shoulder, \"Be with you in a minute.\"\n\n\"Not that much of a hurry,\" Cliff called. \"Take your time, gal, there's\na bath in there. You'll probably want one after a week of living the way\nyou've been.\"\n\n\"Brother!\" she agreed.\n\nJake was making himself a drink. He said easily to Cliff Jackson,\n\"That's a fine girl. I'd hate her job. We get the easy deal on this\nassignment.\"\n\nCliff said, \"You said it, Nigger. How about mixing me a drink, too?\"\n\n\"Nigger!\" Jake said in mock indignation. \"Look who's talking.\" His voice\ntook on a burlesque of a Southern drawl. \"Man when the Good Lawd was\nhandin' out _cullahs_, you musta thought he said _umbrellahs_, and said\ngive me a nice black one.\"\n\nCliff laughed with him and said, \"Where do we plant poor Isobel next?\"\n\nJake thought about it. \"I don't know. The kid's been putting in a lot of\ntime. I think after about a week in Kabara we ought to go on down to\nDakar and suggest she be given another assignment for a while. Some of\nthe girls, working out of our AFAA office don't do anything except drive\naround in recent model cars, showing off the advantages of emancipation,\ntossing money around like tourists, and living it up in general.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the flight up-river to Kabara, Isobel Cunningham went through the\nnotes she'd taken on that town. It was also on the Niger, and the\nassignment had been almost identical to the Gao one. In fact, she'd gone\nthrough the same routine in S\u00c3\u00a9gou, K\u00c3\u00a9-Macina, Mopti, G\u00c3\u00b4undam and Bourem,\nabove Gao, and Ansongo, Tillab\u00c3\u00a9ri and Niamey below. She was stretching\nher luck, if you asked her. Sooner or later she was going to run into\nsomeone who knew her from a past performance.\n\nWell, let the future take care of the future. She looked over at Cliff\nJackson who was piloting the jet and said, \"What're the latest\ndevelopments? Obviously, I haven't seen a paper or heard a broadcast for\nover a week.\"\n\nCliff shrugged his huge shoulders. \"Not much. More trouble with the\nPortuguese down in the south.\"\n\nJake rumbled, \"There's going to be a bloodbath there before it's over.\"\n\nIsobel said thoughtfully, \"There's been some hope that fundamental\nchanges might take place in Lisbon.\"\n\nJake grunted his skepticism. \"In that case the bloodbath would take\nplace there instead of in Africa.\" He added, \"Which is all right with\nme.\"\n\n\"What else?\" Isobel said.\n\n\"Continued complications in the Congo.\"\n\n\"That's hardly news.\"\n\n\"But things are going like clockwork in the west. Kenya, Uganda,\nTanganyika.\" Cliff took his right hand away from the controls long\nenough to make a circle with its thumb and index finger. \"Like\nclockwork. Fifty new fellows from the University of Chicago came in last\nweek to help with the rural education development and twenty or so men\nfrom Johns Hopkins in Baltimore have wrangled a special grant for a new\nmedical school.\"\n\n\"All ... Negroes?\"\n\n\"What else?\"\n\nJake said suddenly, \"Tell her about the Cubans.\"\n\nIsobel frowned. \"Cubans?\"\n\n\"Over in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan area. They were supposedly helping\nintroduce modern sugar refining methods--\"\n\n\"Why supposedly?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"All right, go on,\" Isobel said.\n\nCliff Jackson said slowly, \"Somebody shot them up. Killed several,\nwounded most of the others.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes went round. \"Who ... and why?\"\n\nThe pilot shifted his heavy shoulders again.\n\nJake said, \"Nobody seems to know, but the weapons were modern. Plenty\nmodern.\" He twisted in his bucket seat, uncomfortably. \"Listen, have you\nheard anything about some character named El Hassan?\"\n\nIsobel turned to face him. \"Why, yes. The people there in Gao mentioned\nhim. Who is he?\"\n\n\"That's what I'd like to know,\" Jake said. \"What did they say?\"\n\n\"Oh, mostly supposed words of wisdom that El Hassan was alleged to have\nmade with. I get it that he's some, well you wouldn't call him a\nnationalist since he's international in his appeal, but he's evidently\npreaching union of all Africans. I get an undercurrent of\nanti-Europeanism in general, but not overdone.\" Isobel's expressive face\nwent thoughtful. \"As a matter of fact, his program seems to coincide\nlargely with our own, so much so that from time to time when I had\noccasion to drop a few words of propaganda into a conversation, I'd\nsometimes credit it to him.\"\n\nCliff looked over at her and chuckled. \"That's a coincidence,\" he said.\n\"I've been doing the same thing. An idea often carries more weight with\nthese people if it's attributed to somebody with a reputation.\"\n\nJake, the older of the three said: \"Well, I can't find out anything\nabout him. Nobody seems to know if he's an Egyptian, a Nigerian, a\nMOR ... or an Eskimo, for that matter.\"\n\n\"Did you check with headquarters?\"\n\n\"So far they have nothing on him, except for some other inquiries from\nfield workers.\"\n\nBelow them, the river was widening out to the point where it resembled\nswampland more than a waterway. There were large numbers of waterbirds,\nand occasional herds of hippopotami. Isobel didn't express her thoughts,\nbut a moment of doubt hit her. What would all this be like when the dams\nwere finished, the waters of this third largest of Africa's rivers,\nninth largest of the world's, under control?\n\nShe pointed. \"There's Kabara.\" The age-old river port lay below them.\nCliff slapped one of his controls with the heel of his hand and the\ncraft began to sink earthward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey took up quarters in the new hotel which adjoined the new elementary\nschool, and Isobel immediately went into her routine.\n\nDressed and shod immaculately, her head held high in confidence, she\nspent considerable time mingling with the more backward of the natives\nand especially the women. Six months ago, she had given a performance\nsimilar to that she had just finished in Gao, several hundred miles down\nriver.\n\nNow she renewed old acquaintances, calling them by name--after checking\nher notes. Invariably, their eyes bugged. Their questions came thick,\ncame fast in the slurring Songhoi and she answered them in detail. They\ncame quickly under her intellectual domination. Her poise, her obvious\nwell being, flabbergasted them.\n\nIn all, they spent a week in the little river town, but even the first\nnight Isobel slumped wearily in the most comfortable chair of their\nsmall suite's living room.\n\nShe kicked off her shoes, and wiggled weary toes.\n\n\"If my mother could see me now,\" she complained. \"After giving her all\nto get the apple of her eye through school, her wayward daughter winds\nup living with two men in the wilds of deepest Africa.\" She twisted her\nmouth puckishly.\n\nCliff grunted, poking around in a bag for the bottle of cognac he\ncouldn't remember where he had packed. \"Huh!\" he said. \"The next time\nyou write her you might mention the fact that both of them are\ncontinually proposing to you and you brush it all off as a big joke.\"\n\n\"Huh, indeed!\" Isobel answered him. \"Proposing, or propositioning? If\neither of you two Romeos ever rattle the doorknob of my room at night\nagain, you're apt to get a bullet through it.\"\n\nJake winced. \"Wasn't me. Look at my gray hair, Isobel. I'm old enough to\nbe your daddy.\"\n\n\"Sugar daddy, I suppose,\" she said mockingly.\n\n\"Wasn't me either,\" Cliff said, criss-crossing his heart and pointing\nupward.\n\n\"Huh!\" said Isobel again, but she was really in no mood for their usual\nbanter. \"Listen,\" she said, \"what're we accomplishing with all this\nmasquerade?\"\n\nCliff had found the French brandy. He poured three stiff ones and handed\ndrinks to Isobel and Jake.\n\nHe knew he wasn't telling her anything, but he said, \"We're a king-size\nrumor campaign, that's what we are. We're breaking down institutions the\nsneaky way.\" He added reflectively. \"A kinder way, though, than some.\"\n\n\"But this ... what did you call it earlier, Jake?... this Cinderella act\nI go through perpetually. What good does it do, really? I contact only a\nfew hundreds of people at most. And there are millions here in Mali\nalone.\"\n\n\"There are other teams, too,\" Jake said mildly. \"Several hundreds of us\ndoing one thing or another.\"\n\n\"A drop in the bucket,\" Isobel said, her piquant sepian face registering\nweariness.\n\nCliff sipped his brandy, shaking his big head even as he did so. \"No,\"\nhe said. \"It's a king-size rumor campaign and it's amazing how effective\nthey can be. Remember the original dirty-rumor campaigns back in the\nStates? Suppose two laundry firms were competing. One of them, with a\nmanager on the conscience-less side, would hire two or three\nprofessional rumor spreaders. They'd go around dropping into bars,\nbarber shops, pool rooms. Sooner or later, they'd get a chance to drop\nsome line such as _did you hear about them discovering that two lepers\nworked at the Royal Laundry_? You can imagine the barbers, the\nbartenders, and such professional gossips, passing on the good word.\"\n\nIsobel laughed, but unhappily. \"I don't recognize myself in the\ndescription.\"\n\nCliff said earnestly, \"Sure, only few score women in each town you put\non your act, really witness the whole thing. But think how they pass it\non. Each one of them tells the story of the miracle. A waif comes out of\nthe desert. Without property, without a husband or family, without\nkinsfolk. Shy, dirty, unwanted. Then she's offered a good position if\nshe'll drop the veil, discard the haik, and attend the new schools. So\noff she goes--everyone thinking to her disaster. Hocus-pocus, six months\nlater she returns, obviously prosperous, obviously healthy, obviously\nwell adjusted. Fine. The story spreads for miles around. Nothing is so\npopular as the Cinderella story, and that's the story you're putting\nover. It's a natural.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" Isobel said. \"Sometimes I think I'm helping put over a\ngigantic hoax on these people. Promising something that won't be\ndelivered.\"\n\nJake looked at her unhappily. \"I've thought the same thing, sometimes,\nbut what are you going to be with people at this stage of\ndevelopment--_subtle_?\"\n\nIsobel dropped it. She held out her glass for more cognac. \"I hope\nthere's something decent to eat in this place. Do you realize what I've\nbeen putting into my tummy this past week?\"\n\nCliff shuddered.\n\nIsobel patted her abdomen. \"At least it keeps my figure in trim.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m,\" Jake pretended to leer heavily.\n\nIsobel chuckled at him in a return to good humor. \"Hyena,\" she accused.\n\n\"Hyena?\" Jake said.\n\n\"Sure, there aren't any wolves in these parts,\" she explained. \"How long\nare we going to be here?\"\n\nThe two men looked at each other. Cliff said, \"Well, we'd like to finish\nout the week. Guy named Homer Crawford has been passing around the word\nto hold a meeting in Timbuktu the end of this week.\"\n\n\"Crawford?\"\n\n\"Homer Crawford, some kind of sociologist from the University of\nMichigan, I understand. He's connected with the Reunited Nations African\nDevelopment Project, heads one of their cloak and dagger teams.\"\n\nJake grunted. \"Sociologist? I also understand that he put in a hitch\nwith the Marines and spent kind of a shady period of two years fighting\nwith the FLN in Algeria.\"\n\n\"On what side?\" Cliff said interestedly.\n\n\"Darn if I know.\"\n\nIsobel said, \"Well, we have nothing to do with the Reunited Nations.\"\n\nCliff shook his large head negatively. \"Of course not, but Crawford\nseems to think it'd be a good idea if some of us in the field would get\ntogether and ... well, have sort of a bull session.\"\n\nJake growled, \"We don't have much in the way of co-operation on the\nhigher levels. Everybody seems to head out in all directions on their\nown. It can get chaotic. Maybe in the field we could give each other a\nfew pointers. For one, I'd like to find out if any of the rest of these\njokers know anything about that affair with the Cubans over in the\nSudan.\"\n\n\"I suppose it can't hurt,\" Isobel admitted. \"In fact, it might be fun\nswapping experiences with some of these characters. Frankly, though, the\nstories I've heard about the African Development teams aren't any too\npalatable. They seem to be a ruthless bunch.\"\n\nJake looked down into his glass. \"It's a ruthless country,\" he murmured.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDolo Anah, as he approached the ten Dogon villages of the Canton de\nSangha, was first thought to be a small bird in the sky. As he drew\nnearer, it was decided, instead, that he was a larger creature of the\nair, perhaps a vulture, though who had ever seen such a vulture? As he\ndrew nearer still, it was plain that in size he was more nearly an\nostrich than vulture, but who had ever heard of a flying ostrich, and\nbesides--\n\nNo! It was a man! But who in all the Dogon had ever witnessed such a\n_juju_ man? One whose flailing limbs enabled him to fly!\n\nThe ten villages of the Dogon are perched on the rim of the Falaise de\nBandiagara. The cliffs are over three hundred feet high and the villages\nare similar to Mesa Verde of Colorado, and as unaccessible, as\nimpregnable to attack.\n\nBut hardly impregnable to arrival by helio-hopper.\n\nWhen Dolo Anah landed in the tiny square of the village of Ir\u00c3\u00a8li, the\nfirst instinct of Amadiju\u00c3\u00a8 the village witchman was to send post haste\nto summon the Kanaga dancers, but then despair overwhelmed him. Against\npowers such as this, what could prevail? Besides, Amadiju\u00c3\u00a8 had not\narrived at his position of influence and affluence through other than\nhis own true abilities. Secretly, he rather doubted the efficacy of even\nthe supposedly most potent witchcraft.\n\nBut this!\n\nDolo Anah unstrapped himself from the one man helio-hopper's small\nbicyclelike seat, folded the two rotors back over the rest of the craft,\nand then deposited the seventy-five pound vehicle in a corner, between\ntwo adobe houses. He knew perfectly well that the local inhabitants\nwould die a thousand deaths of torture rather than approach, not to\nspeak of touching it.\n\nLooking to neither right nor left, walking arrogantly and carrying only\na small bag--undoubtedly housing his _gris gris_, as Amadiju\u00c3\u00a8 could well\nimagine--Dolo Anah headed for the largest house. Since the whole village\nwas packed, bug-eyed, into the square watching him there were no\ninhabitants within.\n\nHe snapped back over his shoulder, \"Summon all the headmen of all the\nvillages, and all of their eldest sons; summon all the Hogons and all\nthe witchmen. Immediately! I would speak with them and issue orders.\"\n\nHe was a small man, clad only in a loincloth, and could well have been a\nDogon himself. Surely he was black as a Dogon, clad as a Dogon, and he\nspoke the native language which is a tongue little known outside the\nsemi-desert land of Dogon covered with its sand, rocks, scrub bush and\nbaobab trees. It is not a land which sees many strangers.\n\nThe headmen gathered with trepidation. All had seen the juju man descend\nfrom the skies. It had been with considerable relief that most had noted\nthat he finally sank to earth in the village of Ir\u00c3\u00a8li instead of their\nown. But now all were summoned. Those among them who were Kanaga dancers\nwore their masks and costumes, and above all their gris gris charms, but\nit was a feeble gesture. Such magic as this was unknown. To fly through\nthe air _personally_!\n\nDolo Anah was seated to one end of the largest room of the largest house\nof Ir\u00c3\u00a8li when they crowded in to answer his blunt summons. He was seated\ncross-legged on the floor and staring at the ground before him.\n\nThe others seemed tongue-tied, both headmen and Hogons, the highly\nhonored elders of the Dogon people. So Amadiju\u00c3\u00a8 as senior witchman took\nover the responsibility of addressing this mystery juju come out of the\nskies.\n\n\"Oh, powerful stranger, how is your health?\"\n\n\"Good,\" Dolo Anah said.\n\n\"How is the health of thy wife?\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"How is the health of thy children?\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"How is the health of thy mother?\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"How is the health of thy father?\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"How is the health of thy kinswomen?\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"How is the health of thy kinsmen?\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nTo the traditional greeting of the Dogon, Amadiju\u00c3\u00a8 added hopefully,\n\"Welcome to the villages of Sangha.\"\n\nHis voice registering nothing beyond the impatience which had marked it\nfrom the beginning, Dolo Anah repeated the routine.\n\n\"Men of Sangha,\" he snapped, \"how is your health?\"\n\n\"Good,\" they chorused.\n\n\"How is the health of thy wives?\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\n\"How is the health of thy children?\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\n\"How is the health of thy mothers?\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\n\"How is the health of thy fathers?\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\n\"How is the health of thy kinswomen?\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\n\"How is the health of thy kinsmen?\"\n\n\"Good!\"\n\n\"I accept thy welcome,\" Dolo Anah bit out. \"And now heed me well for I\nam known as Dolo Anah and I have instructions from above for the people\nof the Dogon.\"\n\nSweat glistened on the faces and bodies of the assembled Dogon headmen,\ntheir uncharacteristically silent witchmen, the Hogons and the sons of\nthe headmen.\n\n\"Speak, oh juju come out of the sky,\" Amadiju\u00c3\u00a8 fluttered, but proud of\nhis ability to find speech at all when all the others were stricken dumb\nwith fear.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDolo Anah stared down at the ground before him. The others, their eyes\nfascinated as though by a cobra preparing to strike its death, focused\non the spot as well.\n\nDolo Anah raised a hand very slowly and very gently and a sigh went\nthrough his audience. The dirt on the hut floor had stirred. It stirred\nagain and slowly, ever so slowly, up through the floor emerged a milky,\ntranslucent ball. When it had fully emerged, Dolo Anah took it up in his\nhands and stared at it for a long moment.\n\nIt came to sudden light and a startled gasp flushed over the room, a\ngasp shared by even the witchmen, Amadiju\u00c3\u00a8 included.\n\nDolo Anah looked up at them. \"Each of you must come in turn and look\ninto the ball,\" he said.\n\nFaltering, though all eyes were turned to him, Amadiju\u00c3\u00a8 led the way. His\neyes rounded, he stared, and they widened still further. For within,\nmystery upon mystery, men danced in seeming celebration. It was as\nthough it was a funeral party but of dimensions never known before, for\nthere were scores of Kanaga dancers, and, yes, above all other wonders,\nsome of the dancers were Dogon, without doubt, but others were Mosse and\nothers were even Tellum!\n\nAmadiju\u00c3\u00a8 turned away, shaken, and Dolo Anah spoke sharply, \"The rest,\none by one.\"\n\nThey came. The headmen, the Hogons, the witchmen and finally the sons of\nthe headmen, and each in turn stared into the ball and saw the tiny men\nwithin, doing their dance of celebration, Dogon, Mosse and Tellum\ntogether.\n\nWhen all had seen, Dolo Anah placed the ball back on the ground and\nstared at it and slowly it returned to from whence it came, and Dolo\nAnah gently spread dust over the spot. When the floor was as it had\nbeen, he looked up at them, his eyes striking.\n\n\"What did you see?\" he spoke sharply to Amadiju\u00c3\u00a8.\n\nThere was a tremor in the village witchman's voice. \"Oh juju, come out\nof the sky, I saw a great festival and Dogon danced with their enemies\nthe Mosse and the Tellum--and, all seemed happy beyond belief.\"\n\nThe stranger looked piercingly at the rest. \"And what did you see?\"\n\nSome mumbled, \"The same. The same,\" and others, terrified still, could\nonly nod.\n\n\"That is the message I have come to give you. You will hold a great\nconference with the people of the Tellum and the people of the Mosse and\nthere will be a great celebration and no longer will there be Dogon,\nMosse and Tellum, but all will be one. And there will be trade, and\nthere will be marriage between the tribes, and no longer will there be\nthree tribes, but only one people and no longer will the headmen and\nwitchmen of the tribes resist the coming of the new schools, and all the\nyoung people will attend.\"\n\nAmadiju\u00c3\u00a8 muttered, \"But, great juju come out of the sky, these are our\nblood enemies. For longer than the memory of the grandfathers of our\neldest Hogon we have carried the blood feud with Tellum and Mosse.\"\n\n\"No longer,\" Dolo Anah said flatly.\n\nAmadiju\u00c3\u00a8 held shaking hands out in supplication, to this dominating juju\ncome out of the skies. \"But they will not heed us. Tellum and Mosse have\nhated the Dogon for all time. They will wreak their vengeance on any\ndelegation come to make such suggestions to them.\"\n\n\"I fly to see their headmen and witchmen immediately,\" Dolo Anah bit out\ndecisively. \"They will heed my message.\" His tone turned dangerous. \"As\nwill the headmen and witchmen of the Dogon. If any fail to obey the\nmessage from above, their eyes will lose sight, their tongues become\ndumb, and their bellies will crawl with worms.\"\n\nAmadiju\u00c3\u00a8's face went ashen.\n\nAt long last the headman of all the Sangha villages spoke up, his voice\ntrembling its fear. \"But the schools, oh great juju--as all the Dogon\nhave decided, in tribal conference--the schools are evil for our youth.\nThey teach not the old ways--\"\n\nDolo Anah cut him short with the chop of a commanding hand. \"The old\nways are fated to die. Already they die. The new ways are the ways of\nthe schools.\"\n\nAmazed at his own temerity, the head chief spoke once more. \"But, since\nthe coming of the French, we have rejected the schools.\"\n\nDolo Anah looked at him in scorn. \"These will not be schools of the\nFrench. They will be the schools of Bantu, Berber, Sudanese and all the\nother peoples of the land. And when your young people have attended the\nschools and learned their wisdom they in turn will teach in the schools\nand in all the land there will be wisdom and good life. Now I have\nspoken and all of you will withdraw save only the sons of the headmen.\"\n\nThey withdrew, making a point each and every one not to turn their backs\nto this bringer of disastrous news and leaving only the terror-stricken\nyoung men behind them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen all were gone save the dozen youngsters, Dolo Anah looked at them\ncontemplatively. He shrugged finally and said, pointing with his finger,\n\"You, you and you may leave. The others will remain.\" The three darted\nout, glad of the reprieve.\n\nHe looked at the remainder. \"Be unafraid,\" he snapped. \"There is no\nreason to fear me. Your fathers and the Hogons and the so-called\nwitchmen, are fools, nothing-men. Fools and cowards, because they are\nimpressed by foolish tricks.\"\n\nHe pointed suddenly. \"You, there, what is your name?\"\n\nThe youth stuttered, \"Hinnan.\"\n\n\"Very well, Hinnan. Did you see me approach by the air?\"\n\n\"Yes ... yes ... juju man.\"\n\n\"Don't call me a juju man. There is no such thing as juju. It is\nnonsense made by the cunning to fool the stupid, as you will learn when\nyou attend the schools.\"\n\nHinnan took courage. \"But I saw you fly.\"\n\n\"Have you never seen the great aircraft of the white men of Europe and\nAmerica go flying over? Or have none of you witnessed these craft\nsitting on the ground at Mopti or Niamey. Surely some of you have\njourneyed to Mopti.\"\n\n\"Yes, but they are great craft. And you flew alone and without the great\nwings and propellers of the white-man's aircraft.\"\n\nDolo Anah chuckled. \"My son, I flew in a helio-hopper as they are\ncalled. They are the smallest of all aircraft, but they are not magic.\nThey are made in the factories of the lands of Europe and America and\nafter you have finished school and have found a position for yourself in\nthe new industries that spread through Africa, then you will be able to\npurchase one quite cheaply, if you so desire. Others among you might\neven learn to build them, themselves.\"\n\nHinnan and the others gasped.\n\nDolo Anah went on. \"And observe this.\" He dug into the ground before him\nand revealed the crystal ball that had magically appeared before. He\nshowed to them the little elevator device beneath it which he\nmanipulated with a small rubber bulb which pumped air underneath.\n\nOne or two of them ventured a scornful laugh, at the obviousness of the\ntrick.\n\nDolo Anah took up the ball and unscrewed the base. Inside were a\ndelicate arrangement of film on a continuous spool so that the scene\nplayed over and over again, and a combination of batteries and bulbs to\nproject the scene on the ball's surface. He explained, in patient\ndetail, the workings of the supposed magic ball. Two of the boys had\nseen movies on trips to Mopti, the others had heard of them.\n\nFinally one, highly encouraged now, as were the others, said, \"But why\ndo you show us this and shame us for our foolishness?\"\n\nDolo Anah nodded encouragement at the teen-ager. \"I do not shame you, my\nson, but your fathers and the Hogons and the so-called witchmen. For\nlong ages the Dogon have been led by the oldest members of the tribe,\nthe Hogons. This can be nonsense because in spite of your traditions age\ndoes not necessarily bring wisdom. In fact, senility as it is called can\nbring childish nonsense. A people should be governed by the wisest and\nbest among them, not by tradition, by often silly beliefs handed down\nfrom one generation to another.\"\n\nHinnan, who was eldest son of the head chief, said, \"But why do you tell\nus this, after shaming our fathers and the old men of the Dogon?\"\n\nFor the first time since the elders had left, Dolo Anah's eyes gleamed\nas before. \"Because you will be the leaders of the Dogon tomorrow, most\nlike. And it is necessary to learn these great truths. That you attend\nthe schools and bring to the Dogon tomorrow what they did not have\nyesterday, and do not have today.\"\n\n\"But suppose we tell them of how you have deceived them?\" the other\narticulate Dogon lad said.\n\nDolo Anah chuckled and shook his head. \"They will not believe you, boy.\nThey will be afraid to believe you. And besides, men are almost\neverywhere the same. It is difficult for an older man to learn from a\nyounger one, especially his own son. It is vanity, but it is true.\" His\nmouth twisted in memory. \"When I was a lad myself, on the beaches of an\nisland far from here in the Bahamas, my father beat me on more than one\noccasion, indignant that I should wish to attend the white man's\nschools, while he and his father before him had been fishermen. Beneath\nhis indignation was the fear that one day I would excel him.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" Hinnan said uncomfortably, \"they would not believe us.\"\nInstinctively, the son of the head chief assumed leadership of the\nothers. \"We will keep this secret between us,\" he said to them.\n\nDolo Anah came to his feet, yawned, stretched his legs and began to pack\nhis gadgets into the small valise he carried. \"Good luck, boys,\" he said\nunthinkingly in English.\n\nAs he left the hut, he emerged into a respectfully cleared area around\nthe hut. Without looking left or right he approached his folded\nhelio-hopper, made the few adjustments that were needed to make it\nair-borne, strapped himself into the tiny saddle, flicked the start\ncontrol and to the accompaniment of a gasp from the entire village of\nIr\u00c3\u00a8li, took off in a swoop.\n\nIn a matter of moments, he had disappeared to the north in the direction\nof the Mosse villages.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe Emir Alhaji Mohammadu, the Galadima Dawakin, Kudo of Kano, boiled\nfuriously within as his gold plated Rolls Royce progressed through the\nSaba N'Gari section of town, the quarter outside the dirt walls of the\nmillennium old city. He rode seated alone in the middle of the rear seat\nand his single counselor sat beside the chauffeur. Before them, a jeep\nload of his bodyguard, dressed in their uniforms of red and green,\ncleared the way. Another jeep followed similarly laden.\n\nThey entered through one of the ancient gates and swept up the principal\nstreet. They stopped before the recently constructed luxury hotel in the\ncenter of town and the bodyguard leapt from the jeeps and took positions\nto each side of the entry. The counselor popped out from his side of the\ncar and beat the chauffeur to the task of opening the Emir's door.\n\nEmir Alhaji Mohammadu was a tall man and a heavy one, his white robed\nfigure towered some six and a half feet and his scales put him over the\nthree hundred mark. He was in his mid fifties and almost a quarter\ncentury of autocratic position had marked his face with permanent scowl.\nHe stomped now into the western style hotel.\n\nHis counselor, Ahmadu Abdullah, had already procured the information\nnecessary to locate the source of the Emir's ire and now scurried before\nhis chief, leading the way to the suite occupied by the mysterious\nstrangers. He banged heavily on the door, then stepped behind his master\nas it opened.\n\nOne of the strangers, clad western style, opened the door and stepped\naside courteously motioning to the large inner room. The Emir strutted\narrogantly inside and stared in high irritation at the second and elder\nstranger who sat there at a heavy table. This one came to his feet, but\nthere was no sign of acknowledgment of the Emir's rank. It was not too\nlong a time before that men prostrated themselves in Alhaji Mohammadu's\npresence.\n\nHe looked at them. Though both were of dark complexion, there seemed no\nmanner of typing them. Certainly they were neither Hausa nor Fulani,\nthere being no signs of Hamitic features, but neither were they Ibo or\nYoruba from farther south. The Emir's eyes narrowed and he wondered if\nthese two were Nigerians at all!\n\nHe barked at them in Hausa and the older answered him in the same\nlanguage, though there seemed a certain awkwardness in its use.\n\nEmir Alhaji Mohammadu blared, \"You dare summon me, Kudo of this city?\nYou presume--\"\n\nThey had resumed seats behind the table and the two of them looked at\nhim questioningly. The older one interrupted with a gently raised hand.\n\"Why did you come?\"\n\nStill glaring, the Emir turned to the cringing Ahmadu Abdullah and\nmotioned curtly for the counselor to speak. Meanwhile, the ruler's eyes\nwent around the room, decided that the couch was the only seat that\nwould accommodate his bulk, and descended upon it.\n\nAhmadu Abdullah brought a paper from the folds of his robes. \"This lying\nletter. This shameless attack upon the Galadima Dawakin!\"\n\nThe younger stranger said mildly, \"If the charges contained there are\nincorrect, then why did you come?\"\n\nThe Emir rumbled dangerously, ignoring the question. \"What is your\npurpose? I am not a patient man. There has never been need for my\npatience.\"\n\nThe spokesman of the two, the older, leaned back in his chair and said\ncarefully, \"We have come to demand your resignation and self-exile.\"\n\nA vein beat suddenly and wildly at the gigantic Emir's temple and for a\nfull minute the potentate was speechless with outrage.\n\nAhmadu Abdullah said quickly, \"Fantastic! Ridiculous! The Galadima\nDawakin is lawful ruler and religious potentate of three million devoted\nfollowers. You are lying strangers come to cause dissention among the\npeople of Kano and--\"\n\nThe spokesman for the newcomers took up a sheaf of papers from the table\nand said, his voice emotionless, \"The reason you came here at our\nrequest is because the charges made in that letter you bear are valid\nones. For a quarter century, you, Alhaji Mohammadu, have milked your\npeople to your own profit. You have lived like a god on the wealth you\nhave extracted from them. You have gone far, far beyond the legal and\neven traditional demands you have on the local population. Funds\nsupposedly to be devoted to education, sanitation, roads, hospitals and\na multitude of other developments that would improve this whole\nbenighted area, have gone into your private pocket. In short, you have\nbeen a cancer on your people for the better part of your life.\"\n\n\"All lies!\" roared the Kudo.\n\nThe other shook his head. \"No. We have carefully gathered proof. We can\nsubmit evidence to back every charge we have made. Above all, we can\nprove the existence of large sums of money you have smuggled out of the\ncountry to Switzerland, London and New York to create a reserve for\nyourself in case of emergency. Needless to say, these funds, too, were\noriginally meant for the betterment of the area.\"\n\nThe Emir's eyes were narrow with hate. \"Who are you? Whom do you\nrepresent?\"\n\n\"What difference does it make? This is of no importance.\"\n\n\"You represent my son, Alhaji Fodio! This is what comes of his studies\nin England and America. This is what comes of his leaving Kano and\nspending long years in Lagos among those unbeliever communists in the\nsouth!\"\n\nThe younger stranger chuckled easily. \"That is about the last tag I\nwould hang on your son's associates,\" he said in English.\n\nBut the older stranger was nodding. \"It is true that we hope your son\nwill take over the Emirate. He represents progress. Frankly, his plans\nare to end the office as soon as the people are educated to the point\nwhere they can accept such change.\"\n\n\"End the office!\" the Emir snarled. \"For a thousand years my\nancestors--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe spokesman of the strangers shook his head wearily. \"Your ancestors\nconquered this area less than two centuries ago in a jehad led by Othman\nDan. Since then, you Fulani have feudalistically dominated the Hausa,\nbut that is coming to an end.\"\n\nThe Emir had come to his feet again, in his rage, and now he towered\nover the table behind which the two sat as though about to physically\nattack them. \"You speak as fools,\" he raged.\n\n\"Are you so stupid as to believe that these matters you have brought up\nare understandable to my people? Have you ever seen my people?\" He\nsneered in a caricature of humor. \"My people in their grass and bush\nhuts? With not one man in a whole village who can add sums higher than\nthose he can work out on his fingers? With not one man who can read the\nEnglish tongue, nor any other? Would you explain to these the matters of\ntransferring gold to the Z\u00c3\u00bcrich banks? Would you explain to these what\nis involved in accepting dash from road contractors and from politicians\nin Lagos?\"\n\nHe sneered at them again. \"And do you realize that I am church as well\nas state? That I represent their God to my people? Do you think they\nwould take your word against _mine_, their Kudo?\"\n\nIn talking, he had brought a certain calm back to himself. Now he felt\nreassured at his own words. He wound it up. \"You are fools to believe my\npeople could understand such matters.\"\n\n\"Then actually, you don't deny them?\"\n\n\"Why should I bother?\" the Emir chuckled heavily.\n\n\"That you have taken for personal use the large sums granted this area\nfrom a score of sources for roads, hospitals, schools, sanitation,\nagricultural modernization?\"\n\n\"Of course I don't deny it. This is my land. I am the Kudo, the Emir,\nthe Galadima Dawakin. Whatever I choose to do in Kano and to all my\npeople is right because I wish it. Schools? I don't want them corrupting\nmy people. Hospitals for these Hausa serfs? Nonsense! Roads? They are\nbad for they allow the people to get about too easily and that leads to\ntheir exchanging ideas and schemes and leads to their corruption. Have I\nappropriated all such sums for my own use? Yes! I admit it. Yes! But you\ncannot prove it to such as my people, you who represent my son. So\nbe-gone from Kano. If you are here tomorrow, you will be arrested by the\nsame men of my bodyguard who even now seek my son, Alhaji Fodio. When he\nis captured, it will be of interest to revive some of the methods of\nexecution of my ancestors.\"\n\nThe Emir turned on his heel to stalk from the room but the older of the\ntwo murmured, \"One moment, please.\"\n\nAlhaji Mohammadu paused, his face dark in scowl again.\n\nThe spokesman said agreeably, \"It is true that your people, and\nparticularly your Hausa serfs, have no understanding of international\nfinance nor of national corruption methods such as the taking of _dash_.\nHowever, they are susceptible to other proof.\" The other man raised his\nvoice. \"John!\"\n\nFrom an inner room came another stranger, making their total number\nthree. He was grinning and in one hand held a contraption which boasted\na conglomeration of lenses, switches, microphones, wires and triggers.\n\"Got it perfectly,\" he said. You'd think it had all been rehearsed.\n\nWhile the Emir and his counselor stared in amazement, the spokesman of\nthe strangers said, \"How long before you can project?\"\n\n\"Almost immediately.\"\n\nThe other young man left the room and returned with what was obviously a\nmovie projector. He set it up at one end of the table, pointed at a\nwhite wall, and plugged it in to a convenient outlet.\n\nBefore the Emir had managed to control himself beyond the point of\nsaying any more than, \"What is all this?\" the cameraman had brought a\nmagazine of film from his instrument and inserted it in the projector.\n\nThe photographer said conversationally, to the hulking potentate, \"You'd\nbe amazed at the advances in cinema these past few years. Film speed,\nimmediate development, portable sound equipment. You'd be amazed.\"\n\nSomeone flicked out the greater part of the room's light. The projector\nbuzzed and on the wall was thrown a re-enactment of everything that had\nbeen said and done in the room for the past ten minutes.\n\nWhen it was over, the lights went on again.\n\nThe spokesman said conversationally, \"I assume that if this film were\nshown throughout the villages, even your Hausa serfs would be convinced\nthat throughout your reign you have systematically robbed them.\"\n\nEmir Alhaji Mohammadu, the Galadima Dawakin, Kudo of Kano, his face in\nshock, turned and stumbled from the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gymkhana, or fantasia as it is called in nearby Morocco, was under\nfull swing before Abd-el-Kader and the camel- and horse-mounted warriors\nof his Ouled Touameur clan came dashing in, rifles held high and with\ngreat firing into the air. The Ouled Touameur were the noblest clan of\nthe Ouled Allouch tribe of the Berazga division of the Chaambra nomad\nconfederation--the noblest and the least disciplined. There were\nwhispered rumors going about the conference as to the identity of the\nmysterious raiders who were preying upon the new oases, the oil and road\nbuilding camps and the endless other new projects springing up, all but\nmagically, throughout the northwestern Sahara.\n\nThe gymkhana was in full swing with racing and feasting, and\nstorytellers and conjurers, jugglers and marabouts. And in the air was\nthe acrid distinctive odor of _kif_, for though Mohammed forbade alcohol\nto the faithful he had naught to say about the uses of _cannabis sativa_\nand what is a great festival without the smoking of _kif_ and the eating\nof _majoun_?\n\nThe tribes of the Chaambra were widely represented, Berazga and Mouadhi,\nBou Rouba and Ouled Fredj, and there was even a heavy sprinkling of the\nsedentary Zenatas come down from the towns of Metlili, El Oued and El\nGol\u00c3\u00a9o. Then, of course, were the Haratin serfs, of mixed Arab-Negro\nblood, and the Negroes themselves, until recently openly called slaves,\nbut now--amusingly--named servants.\n\nThe Chaambra were meeting for a great ceremonial gymkhanas, but also, as\nwas widely known, for a _djemaa el kebar_ council of elders and chiefs,\nfor there were many problems throughout the Western Erg and the areas of\nMzab and Bourara. Nor was it secret only to the inner councils that the\nmeeting had been called by Abd-el-Kader, of Shorfu blood, direct\ndescendent of the Prophet through his daughter Fatima, and symbol to the\nyoung warriors of Chaambra spirit.\n\nOf all the Ouled Touameur clan Abd-el-Kader alone refrained from\ndischarging his gun into the air as they dashed into the inner circle of\nkhaima tents which centered the gymkhana and provided council chambers,\ndining hall and sleeping quarters for the tribal and clan heads.\nInstead, and with head arrogantly high, he slipped from his stallion\ntossing the reins to a nearby Zenata and strode briskly to the largest\nof the tents and disappeared inside.\n\n_Bismillah!_ but Adb-el-Kader was a figure of a man! From his turban,\nwhite as the snows of the Atlas, to his yellow leather boots, he wore\nthe traditional clothing of the Chaambra and wore them with pride. Not\nfor Abd-el-Kader the new clothing from the Rouma cities to the north,\nnor even the new manufactures from Dakar, Accra, Lagos and the other\nmushrooming centers to the south.\n\nHis weapons alone paid homage to the new ways. And each fighting man\nwithin eyesight noted that it was not a rifle slung over the shoulder of\nAbd-el-Kader but a sub-machine gun. Bismillah! This could not have been\nso back in the days when the French Camel Corps ruled the land with its\nhand of iron.\n\nThe djemaa el kebar was already in session, seated in a great circle on\nthe rug and provided with glasses of mint tea and some with water pipes.\nThey looked up at the entrance of the warrior clan chieftain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEl Aicha, who was of Maraboutic ancestry and hence a holy man as well as\nelder of the Ouled Fredj, spoke first as senior member of the\nconference. \"We have heard reports that are disturbing of recent months,\nAbd-el-Kader. Reports of activities amongst the Ouled Touameur. We would\nknow more of the truth of these. But also we have high interest in your\nreason for summoning the djemaa el kebar at such a time of year.\"\n\nAbd-el-Kader made a brief gesture of obeisance to the Chaambra leader, a\ngesture so brief as to verge on disrespect. He said, his voice clear and\nconfident, as befits a warrior chief, \"Disturbing only to the old and\nunvaliant, O El Aicha.\"\n\nThe old man looked at him for a long, unblinking moment. As a youth, he\nhad fought at the Battle of Tit when the French Camel Corps had broken\nforever the military power of the Ahaggar Tuareg. El Aicha was no\ncoward. There were murmurings about the circle of elders.\n\nBut when El Aicha spoke again, his voice was level. \"Then speak to us,\nAbd-el-Kader. It is well known that your voice is heard ever more by the\nyoung men, particularly by the bolder of the young men.\"\n\nThe fighting man remained standing, his legs slightly spread. The Arab,\nlike the Amerind, likes to make speech in conference, and eloquence is\nwell held by the Chaambra.\n\n\"Long years ago, and only shortly after the death of the Prophet, the\nChaambra resided, so tell the scribes, in the hills of far away Syria.\nBut when the word of Islam was heard and the true believers began to\nrace their strength throughout all the world, the Chaambra came here to\nthe deserts of Africa and here we have remained. Long centuries it took\nus to gain control of the wide areas of the northern and western desert\nand many were the battles we fought with our traditional enemies the\nTuareg and the Moors before we controlled all the land between the Atlas\nand the Niger and from what is now known as Tunisia to Mauritania.\"\n\nAll nodded. This was tribal history.\n\nAbd-el-Kader held up four fingers on which to enumerate. \"The Chaambra\nwere ever men. Warriors, bedouin; not for us the cities and villages of\nthe Zenatas, and the miserable Haratin serfs. We Chaambra have ever been\nmen of the tent, warriors, conquerors!\"\n\nEl Aicha still nodded. \"That was before,\" he murmured.\n\n\"That will always be!\" Abd-el-Kader insisted. His four fingers were\nspread and he touched the first one. \"Our life was based upon, one, war\nand the spoils of war.\" He touched the second finger. \"Two, the toll we\nextracted from the caravans that passed from Timbuktu to the north and\nback again. Three, from our own caravans which covered the desert trails\nfrom Tripoli to Dakar and from Marrakech to Kano. And fourth\"--he\ntouched his last finger--\"from our flocks which fed us in the\nwilderness.\" He paused to let this sink in.\n\n\"All this is verily true,\" muttered one of the elders, a _so-what_\nquality in his voice.\n\nAbd-el-Kader's tone soured. \"Then came the French with their weapons and\ntheir multitudes of soldiers and their great wealth with which to pursue\nthe expenses of war. And one by one the Tuareg and the Teda to the south\nand the Moors and Nemadi, yes, and even the Chaambra fell before the\nonslaughts of the Camel Corps and their wild-dog Foreign Legion.\" He\nheld up his four fingers again and counted them off. \"The four legs upon\nwhich our life was based were broken. War and its spoils was prevented\nus. The tolls we charged caravans to cross our land were forbidden. And\nthen, shortly after, came the motor trucks which crossed the desert in a\nweek, where formerly the journey took as much as a year. Our camel\ncaravans became meaningless.\"\n\nAgain all nodded. \"Verily, the world changes,\" someone muttered.\n\nThe warrior leader's voice went dramatic. \"We were left with naught but\nour flocks, and now even they are fated to end.\"\n\nThe elderly nomads stirred and some scowled.\n\n\"At every water hole in the desert teams of the new irrigation\ndevelopment dig their wells, install their pumps which bring power from\nthe sun, plant trees, bring in Haratin and former slaves--_our_\nslaves--to cultivate the new oases. And we are forbidden the water for\nthe use of our goats and sheep and camels.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" one of the clan chiefs injected, \"they tell us that the goat\nis the curse of North Africa, nibbling as it does the bark of small\ntrees, and they attempt to purchase all goats until soon there will be\nfew, if any, in all the land.\"\n\n\"So our young people,\" Abd-el-Kader pressed on, \"stripped of our former\nway of life, go to the new projects, enroll in the schools, take work in\nthe new oases or on the roads, and disappear from the sight of their\nkinsmen.\" He came to a sudden halt and all but glared at them,\nmaintaining his silence until El Aicha stirred.\n\n\"And--?\" El Aicha said. This was all obviously but preliminary.\n\nAbd-el-Kader spoke softly now, and there was a different drama in his\nvoice. \"And now,\" he said, \"the French are gone. All the Rouma, save a\nhandful, are gone. In the south the English are gone from the lands of\nthe blacks, such as Nigeria and Ghana, Sierra Leone and Gambia. The\nItalians are gone from Libya and Somaliland and the Spanish from Rio de\nOro. Nor will they ever return for in the greatest council of all the\nRouma they have decided to leave Africa to the African.\"\n\nThey all stirred again and some muttered and Abd-el-Kader pushed his\npoint. \"The Chaambra are warriors born. Never serfs! Never slaves! Never\nhave we worked for any man. Our ancestors carved great empires by the\nsword.\" His voice lowered again. \"And now, once more, it is possible to\ncarve such an empire.\"\n\nHe swept his eyes about their circle. \"Chiefs of the Chaambra, there is\nno force in all the Sahara to restrain us. Let others work on the roads,\nplanting the new trees in the new oases, damming the great Niger, and\nall the rest of it. We will sweep over them, and dominate all. We, the\nChaambra, will rule, while those whom Allah intended to drudge, do so.\nWe, the Chosen of Allah, will fulfill our destiny!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbd-el-Kader left it there and crossed his arms on his chest, staring at\nthem challengingly.\n\nFinally El Aicha directed his eyes across the circle of listeners at two\nwho had sat silently through it all, their burnooses covering their\nheads and well down over their eyes. He said, \"And what do you say to\nall this?\"\n\n\"Time to go into your act, man,\" Abe Bakr muttered, under his breath.\n\nHomer Crawford came to his feet and pushed back the hood of the\nburnoose. He looked over at the headman of the Ouled Touameur warrior\nclan, whose face was darkening.\n\nIn Arabic, Crawford said, \"I have sought you for some time,\nAbd-el-Kader. You are an illusive man.\"\n\n\"Who are you, Negro?\" the fighting man snapped.\n\nCrawford grinned at the other. \"You look as though you have a bit of\nNegro blood in your own veins. In fact, I doubt if there's a so-called\nArab in all North Africa, unless he's just recently arrived, whose\nfamily hasn't down through the centuries mixed its blood with the local\npeople they conquered.\"\n\n\"You lie!\"\n\nAbe chuckled from the background. The Chaambra leader was at least as\ndark of complexion as the American Negro. Not that it made any\ndifference one way or the other.\n\n\"We shall see who is the liar here,\" Homer Crawford said flatly. \"You\nasked who I am. I am known as Omar ben Crawf and I am headman of a team\nof the African Development Project of the Reunited Nations. As you have\nsaid, Abd-el-Kader, this great council of the headmen of all the nations\nof the world--not just the Rouma--has decided that Africa must be left\nto the Africans. But that does not mean it has lost all interest in\nthese lands. It has no intention, warrior of the Chaambra, to allow such\nas you to disrupt the necessary progress Africa must make if it is not\nto become a danger to the shaky peace of the world.\"\n\nAbd-el-Kader's eyes darted about the tent. So far as he could see, the\nother was backed only by his single henchman. The warrior chief gained\nconfidence. \"Power is for those who can assert it. Some will rule. It\nhas always been so. Here in the Western Erg, the Chaambra will rule, and\nI, Abd-el-Kader will lead them!\"\n\nHomer Crawford was shaking his head, almost sadly it seemed. \"No,\" he\nsaid. \"The day of rule by the gun is over. It must be over because at\nlong last man's weapons have become so great that he must not trust\nhimself with them. In the new world which is still aborning so that half\nthe nations of earth are in the pains of labor, government must be by\nthe most wise and most capable.\"\n\nIn a deft move the sub-machine gun's sling slipped from the desert man's\nshoulder and the short, vicious gun was in hand. \"The strong will always\nrule!\" the Arab shouted. \"Time was when the French conquered the\nChaambra, but the French have allowed their strength to ebb away, and\nnow, armed with such weapons as these, we of the Sahara will again\nassert our birthright as the Chosen of Allah!\"\n\nAbe Baker chuckled. \"That cat sure can lay on a speech, man.\" As though\nmagically, a snub-nosed hand weapon of unique design appeared in his\ndark hand.\n\nEl Aicha's voice was suddenly strong and harsh. \"There shall be no\nviolence at a djemaa el kebar.\"\n\nHomer ignored the automatic weapon in the hands of the excited Arab. He\nsaid, and there was still a sad quality in his voice. \"The gun you carry\nis a nothing-weapon, desert man. When the French conquered this land\nmore than a century ago they were armed with single-shot rifles which\nwere still far in advance of your own long barrelled flintlocks. Today,\nyou are proud of that tommy gun you carry, and, indeed, it has the fire\npower of a company of the Foreign Legion of a century past. However,\nbelieve me, Abd-el-Kader, it is a nothing-weapon compared to those that\nwill be brought against the Chaambra if they heed your words.\"\n\nThe desert leader put back his head and laughed his scorn.\n\nHe chopped his laughter short and snapped, more to the council of chiefs\nthan to the stranger. \"Then we will seize such weapons and use them\nagainst those who would oppose us. In the end it is the strong who win\nin war, and the Rouma have gone soft, as all men know. I, Abd-el-Kader\nwill have these two killed and then I shall announce to the assembled\ntribes the new jedah, a Holy War to bring the Chosen of Allah once again\nto their rightful position in the Sahara.\"\n\n\"Man,\" Abe Baker murmured pleasantly, \"you're going to be one awful\ndisappointed cat before long.\"\n\nEl Aicha said mildly, \"Such decisions are for the djemaa el kebar to\nmake, O Abd-el-Kader, not for a single chief of the Ouled Touameur.\"\n\nThe desert warrior chief sneered openly at the old man. \"Decisions are\nmade by those with the strength to enforce them. The young men of the\nChaambra support me, and my men surround this tent.\"\n\n\"So do mine,\" Homer Crawford said decisively. \"And I have come to arrest\nyou and take you to Columb-B\u00c3\u00a9char where you will be tried for your\nparticipation in recent raids on various development projects.\"\n\nEl Aicha repeated his earlier words. \"There shall be no violence at a\ndjemaa el kebar.\"\n\nThe Ouled Touameur chief's eyes had narrowed. \"You are not strong enough\nto take me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn English, Abe Baker said, \"Like maybe these young followers of this\ncat need an example laid on them, man.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're right,\" Crawford growled disgustedly.\n\nThe younger American came to his feet. \"I'll take him on,\" Abe said.\n\n\"No, he's nearer to my size,\" Crawford grunted. He turned to El Aicha,\nand said in Arabic, \"I demand the right of a stranger in your camp to a\ntrial by combat.\"\n\n\"On what grounds?\" the old man scowled.\n\n\"That my manhood has been spat upon by this warrior who does his\nfighting with his loud mouth.\"\n\nThe assembled chiefs looked to Abd-el-Kader, and a rustling sigh went\nthrough them. A hundred times the wiry desert chieftain had proven\nhimself the most capable fighter in the tribes. A hundred times he had\nproven it and there were dead and wounded in the path he had cut for\nhimself.\n\nAbd-el-Kader laughed aloud again. \"Swords, in the open before the\nascan.\"\n\nHomer Crawford shrugged. \"Swords, in the open before the assembled\nChaambra so that they may see how truly weak is the one who calls\nhimself so strong.\"\n\nAbe said worriedly, in English, \"Listen, man, you been checked out on\nswords?\"\n\n\"They're the traditional weapon in the Arab _code duello_,\" Homer said,\nwith a wry grin. \"Nothing else would do.\"\n\n\"Man, you sound like you've been blasting pot and got yourself as high\nas those cats out there with their _kif_. This Abd-el-Kader was probably\nraised with a sword in his hand.\"\n\nAbd-el-Kader smiling triumphantly, had spun on his heel and made his way\nthrough the tent's entrance. Now they could hear him shouting orders.\n\nEl Aicha looked up at Homer Crawford from where he sat. His voice\nwithout inflection, he said, \"Hast thou a sword, Omar ben Crawf?\"\n\n\"No,\" Crawford said.\n\nThe elderly tribal leader said, \"Then I shall loan you mine.\" He\nhesitated momentarily, before adding, \"Never before has hand other than\nmine wielded it.\" And finally, simply, \"Never has it been drawn to\ncommit dishonor.\"\n\n\"I am honored.\"\n\nOutside, the rumors had spread fast and already a great arena was\nforming by the packed lines of Chaambra nomads. At the tent entrance,\nElmer Allen, his face worried, said, his English in characteristic\nJamaican accent, \"What did you chaps do?\"\n\n\"Duel,\" Abe growled apprehensively. \"This joker here has challenged\ntheir top swordsman to a fight.\"\n\nElmer said hurriedly, \"See here, gentlemen, the hovercraft are parked\nover behind that tent. We can be there in two minutes and away from--\"\n\nCrawford's eyes went from Elmer Allen to Abe Baker and then back again.\nHe chuckled, \"I don't think you two think I'm going to win this fight,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"What do you know about swordsmanship?\" Elmer Allen said accusingly.\n\n\"Practically nothing. A little bayonet practice quite a few years ago.\"\n\n\"Oh, great,\" Abe muttered.\n\nElmer said hurriedly, \"See here, Homer, I was on the college fencing\nteam and--\"\n\nCrawford grinned at him. \"Too late, friend.\"\n\nAs they talked, they made their way to the large circle of men. In its\ncenter, Abd-el-Kader was stripping to his waist, meanwhile laughingly\nshouting his confidence to his Ouled Touameur tribesmen and to the other\nChaambra of fighting age. No one seemed to doubt the final issue.\nBeneath his white burnoose he wore a gandoura of lightweight woolen\ncloth and beneath that a longish undershirt of white cotton, similar to\nthat of the Tuareg but with shorter and less voluminous sleeves. This\nthe desert fighter retained.\n\nCrawford stripped down too, nude to the waist. His body was in excellent\ntrim, muscles bunching under the ebony skin. A Haratin servant came up\nbearing El Aicha's sword.\n\nHomer Crawford pulled it from the scabbard. It was of scimitar type, the\nweapon which had once conquered half the known world.\n\nFrom within the huge circle of men, Abd-el-Kader swung his own blade in\nflashing arcs and called out something undoubtedly insulting, but which\nwas lost in the babble of the multitude.\n\n\"Well, here we go,\" Crawford grunted. \"You fellows better station\nyourselves around just on the off chance that those Ouled Touameur\nbully-boys don't like the decision.\"\n\n\"We'll worry about that,\" Abe said unhappily. \"You just see you get out\nof this in one piece. Anything happens to you and the head office'll\nmake me head of this team--and frankly, man I don't want the job.\"\n\nHomer grinned at him, and began pushing his way through to the center.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Arab cut a last switch in the air, with his whistling blade and\nstarted forward, in practiced posture. Homer awaited him, legs spread\nslightly, his hands extended slightly, the sword held at the ready but\nwith point low.\n\nAbe Baker growled, unhappily, \"He said he didn't know anything about the\nswords, and the way he holds it bears him out. That Arab'll cut Homer to\nribbons. Maybe we ought to do something about it.\" As usual, under\nstress, he'd dropped his beatnik patter.\n\nElmer Allen looked at him. \"Such as what? There are at least three\nthousand of these tribesmen chaps here watching their favorite sport.\nWhat did you have in mind doing?\"\n\nAbd-el-Kader hadn't remained the victor of a score of similar duels\nthrough making such mistakes as underestimating his foe. In spite of the\nblack stranger's seeming ignorance of his weapon, the Arab had no\nintention of being sucked into a trap. He advanced with care.\n\nHis sword darted forward, quickly, experimentally, and Homer Crawford\nbarely caught its razor edge on his own.\n\nSave for his own four companions, the crowd laughed aloud. None among\nthem were so clumsy as this.\n\nThe Ouled Touameur chief was convinced. He stepped in fast, the blade\nflicked in and out in a quick feint, then flicked in again. Homer\nCrawford countered clumsily.\n\nAnd then there was a roar as the American's blade left his hand and flew\nhigh in the air to come to the ground again a score of feet behind the\ndesert swordsman.\n\nFor a brief moment Abd-el-Kader stepped back to observe his foe, and\nthere was mockery in his face. \"So thy manhood has been spat upon by one\nwho fights only with his mouth! Almost, braggart, I am inclined to give\nyou your life so that you may spend the rest of it in shame. Now die,\nunbeliever!\"\n\nCrawford stood hopelessly, in a semicrouch, his hands still slightly\nforward. The Arab came in fast, his sword at the ready for the death\nstroke.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSuddenly, the American moved forward and then jumped a full yard into\nthe air, feet forward and into the belly of the advancing Arab. The\nheavily shod right foot struck at the point in the abdomen immediately\nbelow the sternum, the solar plexus, and the left was as low as the\ngroin. In a motion that was almost a bounce off the other's body,\nCrawford came lithely back to his feet, jumped back two steps, crouched\nagain.\n\nBut Abd-el-Kader was through, his eyes popping agony, his body writhing\non the ground. The whole thing, from the time the Arab had advanced on\nthe disarmed man for the kill, hadn't taken five seconds.\n\nHis groans were the only sounds which broke the unbelieving silence of\nthe Chaambra tribesmen. Homer Crawford picked up the fallen leader's\nsword and then strolled over and retrieved that of El Aicha. Ignoring\nAbd-el-Kader, he crossed to where the tribal elders had assembled to\nwatch the fight and held out the borrowed sword to its owner.\n\nEl Aicha sheathed it while looking into Homer Crawford's face. \"It has\nstill never been drawn to commit dishonor.\"\n\n\"My thanks,\" Crawford said.\n\nOver the noise of the crowd which now was beginning to murmur its\nincredulity at their champion's fantastic defeat, came the voice of Abe\nBaker swearing in Arabic and yelling for a way to be cleared for him. He\nwas driving one of the hovercraft.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe drew it up next to the still agonized Abd-el-Kader and got out\naccompanied by Bey-ag-Akhamouk. Silently and without undue roughness\nthey picked up the fallen clan chief and put him into the back of the\nhover-lorry, ignoring the crowd.\n\nHomer Crawford came up and said in English, \"All right, let's get out of\nhere. Don't hurry, but on the other hand don't let's prolong it. One of\nthose Ouled Touameur might collect himself to the point of deciding he\nought to rescue his leader.\"\n\nAbe looked at him disgustedly. \"Like, where'd you learn that little\nparty trick, man?\"\n\nCrawford yawned. \"I said I didn't know anything about swords. You didn't\nask me about judo. I once taught judo in the Marines.\"\n\n\"Well, why didn't you take him sooner? He like to cut your head off with\nthat cheese knife before you landed on him.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do it sooner. Not until he knocked the sword out of my hand.\nUntil then it was a sword fight. But as soon as I had no sword then in\nthe eyes of every Chaambra present, I had the right to use any method\npossible to save myself.\"\n\nBey-ag-Akhamouk looked up at the sun to check the time. \"We better speed\nit up if we want to get this man to Columb-B\u00c3\u00a9char and then get on down\nover the desert to Timbuktu and that meeting.\"\n\n\"Let's go,\" Homer said. The second hovercraft joined them, driven by\nElmer Allen, and they made their way through the staring, but\nmotionless, crowds of Chaambra.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nOnce the city of Timbuktu was more important in population, in commerce,\nin learning than the London, the Paris or the Rome of the time. It was\nthe crossroads where African traffic, east and west, met African\ntraffic, north and south; Timbuktu dominated all. In its commercial\nhouses accumulated the wealth of Africa; in its universities and mosques\nthe wisdom of Greece, Rome, Byzantium and the Near East--at a time when\nsuch learning was being destroyed in Dark Ages beset Europe.\n\nTimbuktu's day lasted but two or three hundred years at most. By the\nmiddle of the Twentieth Century it had deteriorated into what looked\nnothing so much as a New Mexico ghost town, built largely of adobe. Its\npalaces and markets has melted away to caricatures of their former\nselves, its universities were a memory of yesteryear, its population\nfallen off to a few thousands. Not until the Niger Projects, the dams\nand irrigation projects, of the latter part of the Twentieth Century did\nthe city begin to regain a semblance of its old importance.\n\nHomer Crawford's team had come down over the Tanezrouft route, Reggan,\nBidon Cinq and Tessalit; that of Isobel Cunningham, Jacob Armstrong and\nClifford Jackson, up from Timbuktu's Niger River port of Kabara. They\nmet in the former great market square, bordered on two sides by the one\ntime French Administration buildings.\n\nIsobel reacted first. \"Abe!\" she yelled, pointing accusingly at him.\n\nAbe Baker pretended to cringe, then reacted. \"Isobel! Somebody _told_ me\nyou were over here!\"\n\nShe ran over the heavy sand, which drifted through the streets, to the\nhovercraft in which he had just pulled up. He popped out to meet her,\ngrinning widely.\n\n\"Why didn't you look me up?\" she said accusingly, presenting a cheek to\nbe kissed.\n\n\"In Africa, man?\" he laughed. \"Kinda big, Africa. Like, I didn't know if\nyou were in the Sahara, or maybe down in Angola, or wherever.\"\n\nShe frowned. \"Heaven forbid.\"\n\nAbe turned to the others of his team who had crowded up behind him. It\nhad been a long time since any of them had seen other than native women.\n\n\"Isobel,\" he said, \"I hate to do this, but let me introduce you to Homer\nCrawford, my immediate boss and slave driver, late of the University of\nMichigan where he must've found out where the body was--they gave him a\ndoctorate. Then here's Elmer Allen, late of Jamaica--British West\nIndies, not Long Island--all he's got is a master's, also in sociology.\nAnd this is Kenneth Ballalou, hails from San Francisco, I don't think\nKenny ever went to school, but he seems to speak every language ever.\"\nAbe turned to his final companion. \"And this is our sole _real_ African,\nBey-ag-Akhamouk, of Tuareg blood, so beware, they don't call the Tuareg\nthe Apaches of the Sahara for nothing.\"\n\nBey pretended to wince as he held out his hand. \"Since Abe seems to be\nan education snob, I might as well mention the University of Minnesota\nand my Political Science.\"\n\nJake Armstrong and Cliff Jackson had come up behind Isobel, and were now\nintroduced in turn. The older man said, \"A Tuareg in a Reunited Nations\nteam? Not that it makes any difference to me, but I thought there was\nsome sort of policy.\"\n\n\"I was taken to the States when I was three,\" Bey said. \"I'm an American\ncitizen.\"\n\nIsobel was chattering, in animation, with Abe Baker. It developed they'd\nboth been reporters on the school paper at Columbia. At least, they'd\nboth started as reporters, Isobel had wound up editor.\n\nSince their introduction, Homer Crawford had been vaguely frowning at\nher. Now he said, \"I've been trying to place where I'd seen you before.\nNow I know. Some photographs of Lena Horne, she was--\"\n\nIsobel dropped a mock curtsy. \"Thank you, kind sir, you don't have to\ntell me about Lena Horne, she's a favorite. I have scads of tapes of\nher.\"\n\n\"Brother,\" Elmer Allen said dourly, \"how's anybody going to top that?\nHomer's got the inside track now. Let's get over to this meeting. By the\ncars, helio-copters and hovercraft around here, you got more of a\nturnout than I expected, Homer.\"\n\nThe meeting was held in what had once been an assembly chamber of the\nofficials of the former _Cercle de Tombouctou_, when this had all been\npart of French Sudan. It was the only room in the vicinity which would\ncomfortably hold all of them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nElmer Allen had been right, there was something like a hundred persons\npresent, almost all men but with a sprinkling of women, such as Isobel.\nMore than half were in native costume running the gamut from Nigeria to\nMorocco and from Mauritania to Ethiopia. They were a competent looking,\nconfident voiced gathering.\n\nHomer Crawford knocked with a knuckle on the table that stood at the\nhead of the hall and called for silence. \"Sorry we're late,\" he said,\n\"Particularly in view of the fact that the idea of this meeting\noriginated with my team. We had some difficulty with a nomad raider, up\nin Chaambra country.\"\n\nSomeone from halfway back in the hall said bitterly, \"I suppose in\ntypical African Development Project style, you killed the poor man.\"\n\nCrawford said dryly, \"_Poor man_ isn't too accurate a description of the\ngentleman involved. However, he is at present in jail awaiting trial.\"\nHe got back to the meeting. \"I had originally thought of this being an\ninformal get-together of a score or so of us, but in view of the numbers\nI suggest we appoint a temporary chairman.\"\n\n\"You're doing all right,\" Jake Armstrong said from the second row of\nchairs.\n\n\"I second that,\" an unknown called from further back.\n\nCrawford shrugged. His manner had a cool competence. \"All right. If\nthere is no objection, I'll carry on until the meeting decides, if it\never does, that there is need of elected officers.\"\n\n\"I object.\" In the third row a white haired, but Prussian-erect man had\ncome to his feet. \"I wish to know the meaning of this meeting. I object\nto it being held at all.\"\n\nAbe Baker called to him, \"Dad, how can you object to it being held if\nyou don't know what it's for?\"\n\nHomer Crawford said, \"Suppose I briefly sum up our mutual situation and\nif there are any motions to be made--including calling the meeting\nquits--or decisions to come to, we can start from there.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of assent. The objector sat down in a huff.\n\nCrawford looked out over them. \"I don't know most of you. The word of\nthis meeting must have spread from one group or team to another. So what\nI'll do is start from the beginning, saying little at first with which\nyou aren't already familiar, but we'll lay a foundation.\"\n\nHe went on. \"This situation which we find in Africa is only a part of a\nworld-wide condition. Perhaps to some, particularly in the Western World\nas they call it, Africa isn't of primary importance. But, needless to\nsay, it is to we here in the field. Not too many years ago, at the same\nperiod the African colonies were bursting their bonds and achieving\nindependence, an international situation was developing that threatened\nfuture peace. The rich nations were getting richer, the poor were\ngetting poorer, and the rate of this change was accelerating. The\nreasons were various. The population growth in the backward countries,\nunhampered by birth control and rocketing upward due to new sanitation,\nnew health measures, and the conquest of a score of diseases that have\nbedeviled man down through the centuries, was fantastic. Try as they\nwould to increase per capita income in the have-not nations, population\ngrew faster than new industry and new agricultural methods could keep\nup. On top of that handicap was another; the have-not nations were so\nfar behind economically that they couldn't get going. Why build a\nbicycle factory in Morocco which might be able to turn out bikes for,\nsay, fifty dollars apiece, when you could buy them from automated\nfactories in Europe, Japan or the United States for twenty-five\ndollars?\"\n\nMost of his audience were nodding agreement, some of them impatiently,\nas though wanting him to get on with it.\n\nCrawford continued. \"For a time aid to these backward nations was left\nin the hands of the individual nations--especially to the United States\nand Russia. However, in spite of speeches of politicians to the\ncontrary, governments are not motivated by humanitarian purposes. The\ngovernment of a country does what it does for the benefit of the ruling\nclass of that country. That was the reason it was appointed the\ngovernment. Any government that doesn't live up to this dictum soon\nstops being the government.\"\n\n\"That isn't always so,\" somebody called.\n\nHomer Crawford grinned. \"Bear with me a while,\" he said. \"We can debate\ntill the Niger freezes over--later on.\"\n\nHe went on. \"For instance, the United States would _aid_ Country X with\na billion dollars at, say four per cent interest, stipulating that the\nmoney be spent in America. This is aid? It certainly is for American\nbusiness. But then our friends the Russians come along and loan the same\ncountry a billion rubles at a very low interest rate and with supposedly\nno strings attached, to build, say, a railroad. Very fine indeed, but\nfirst of all the railroad, built Russian style and with Russian\nequipment, soon needs replacements, new locomotives, more rolling stock.\nWhere must it come from? Russia, of course. Besides that, in order to\nbuild and run the railroad it became necessary to send Russian\ntechnicians to Country X and also to send students from Country X to\nMoscow to study Russian technology so that they could operate the\nrailroad.\" Crawford's voice went wry. \"Few countries, other than commie\nones, much desire to have their students study in Moscow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a slight stirring in his audience and Homer Crawford grinned\nslightly. \"You'll pardon me if in this little summation, I step on a few\nideological toes--of both East and West.\n\n\"Needless to say, under these conditions of _aid_ in short order the\neconomies of various countries fell under the domination of the two\ngreat collossi. At the same time the other have nations including Great\nBritain, France, Germany and the newly awakening China, began to realize\nthat unless they got into the _aid_ act that they would disappear as\ncompetitors for the tremendous markets in the newly freed former\ncolonial lands. Also along in here it became obvious that philanthropy\nwith a mercenary basis doesn't always work out to the benefit of the\nreceiver and the world began to take measures to administer aid more\nefficiently and through world bodies rather than national ones.\n\n\"But there was still another problem, particularly here in Africa. The\nnewly freed former colonies were wary of the nations that had formerly\nowned them and often for good reasons, always remembering that\ngovernments are not motivated by humanitarian reasons. England did not\nfree India because her heart bled for the Indian people, nor did France\nfinally free Algeria because the French conscience was stirred with\nthoughts of Freedom, Equality and Fraternity.\"\n\nA voice broke in from halfway down the hall, a voice heavy with British\naccent. \"I say, why did you Yanks free the Philippines?\"\n\nHomer Crawford laughed, as did several other Americans present. \"That's\nthe first time I've ever been called a Yankee,\" he said. \"But the point\nis well taken. By freeing the islands we washed our hands of the\nresponsibility of such expensive matters as their health and education,\nand at the same time we granted freedom we made military and economic\ntreaties which perpetuated our fundamental control of the Philippines.\n\n\"The point is made. The distrust of the European and the white man as a\nwhole was prevalent, especially here in Africa. However, and\nparticularly in Africa, the citizens of the new countries were almost\nunbelievably uneducated, untrained, incapable of engineering their own\ndestiny. In whole nations there was not a single lawyer or--\"\n\n\"That's no handicap,\" somebody called.\n\nThere was laughter through the hall.\n\nHomer Crawford laughed, too, and nodded as though in solemn agreement.\n\"However, there were also no doctors, engineers, scientists. There were\nwhole nations without a single college graduate.\"\n\nHe paused and his eyes swept the hall. \"That's where we came in. Most of\nus here this afternoon are from the States, however, also represented to\nmy knowledge are British West Indians, a Canadian or two, at least one\nPanamanian, and possibly some Cubans. Down in the southern part of the\ncontinent I know of teams working in the Portuguese areas who are\nBrazilian in background. All of us, of course, are Africans racially,\nbut few if any of us know from what part of Africa his forebears came.\nMy own grandfather was born a slave in Mississippi and didn't know his\nfather; my grandmother was already a hopeless mixture of a score of\nAfrican tribes.\n\n\"That, I assume, is the story of most if not all of us. Our ancestors\nwere wrenched from the lands of their birth and shipped under conditions\nworse than cattle to the New World.\" He added simply, \"Now we return.\"\n\nThere was a murmur throughout his listeners, but no one interrupted.\n\n\"When the great powers of Europe arbitrarily split up Africa in the\nNineteenth Century they didn't bother with race, tribe, not even\ngeographic boundaries. Largely they seemed to draw their boundary lines\nwith ruler and pencil on a Mercator projection. Often, not only were\nnative nations split in twain but even tribes and clans, and sometimes\nsplit not only one way but two or three. It was chaotic to the old\ntribal system. Of course, when the white man left various efforts were\nmade from the very start to join that which had been torn apart a\ncentury earlier. Right here in this area, Senegal and what was then\nFrench Sudan merged to form the short-lived Mali Federation. Ghana and\nFrench Guinea formed a shaky alliance. More successful was the\nfederation of Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda and Zanzibar, which of course,\nhas since grown.\n\n\"But there were fantastic difficulties. Many of the old tribal\ninstitutions had been torn down, but new political institutions had been\nintroduced only in a half-baked way. African politicians, supposedly\n'democratically' elected, had no intention of facing the possibility of\ngiving up their individual powers by uniting with their neighbors. Not\nonly had the Africans been divided tribally but now politically as well.\nBut obviously, so long as they continued to be Balkanized the chances of\nrapid progress were minimized.\n\n\"Other difficulties were manifold. So far as socio-economics were\nconcerned, African society ran the scale from bottom to top. The Bushmen\nof the Ermelo district of the Transvaal and the Kalahari are stone age\npeople still--savages. Throughout the continent we find tribes at an\nethnic level which American Anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan called\nbarbarism. In some places we find socio-economic systems based on\nchattle slavery, elsewhere feudalism. In comparatively few areas,\nCasablanca, Algiers, Dakar, Cairo and possibly the Union we find a\nrapidly expanding capitalism.\n\n\"Needless to say, if Africa was to progress, to increase rapidly her per\ncapita income, to depart the ranks of the have-nots and become have\nnations, these obstacles had to be overcome. That is why we are here.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself, Mr. Crawford,\" the white haired objector of ten\nminutes earlier, bit out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHomer Crawford nodded. \"You are correct, sir. I should have said that is\nthe reason the teams of the Reunited Nations African Development Project\nare here. I note among us various members of this project besides those\nbelonging to my own team, by the way. However, most of you are under\nother auspices. We of the Reunited Nations teams are here because as\nAfricans racially but not nationally, we have no affiliation with clan,\ntribe or African nation. We are free to work for Africa's progress\nwithout prejudice. Our job is to remove obstacles wherever we find them.\nTo break up log jams. To eliminate prejudices against the steps that\nmust be taken if Africa is to run down the path of progress, rather than\nto crawl. We usually operate in teams of about half a dozen. There are\nhundreds of such teams in North Africa alone.\"\n\nHe rapped his knuckle against the small table behind which he stood.\n\"Which brings us to the present and to the purpose of suggesting this\nmeeting. Most of you are operating under other auspices than the\nReunited Nations. Many of you duplicate some of our work. It occurred to\nme, and my team mates, that it might be a good idea for us to get\ntogether and see if there is ground for co-operation.\"\n\nJake Armstrong called out, \"What kind of co-operation?\"\n\nCrawford shrugged. \"How would I know? Largely, I don't even know who you\nrepresent, or the exact nature of the tasks you are trying to perform. I\nsuggest that each group of us represented here, stand up and announce\ntheir position. Possibly, it will lead to something of value.\"\n\n\"I make that a motion,\" Cliff Jackson said.\n\n\"Second,\" Elmer Allen called out.\n\nThe majority were in favor.\n\nHomer Crawford sat down behind the table, saying, \"Who'll start off?\"\n\nArmstrong said, \"Isobel, you're better looking than I am. They'd rather\nlook at you. You present our story.\"\n\nIsobel came to her feet and shot him a scornful glance. \"Lazy,\" she\nsaid.\n\nJake Armstrong grinned at her. \"Make it good.\"\n\nIsobel took her place next to the table at which Crawford sat and faced\nthe others.\n\nShe looked at the chairman from the side of her eyes and said, \"After\nthat allegedly _brief_ summation Mr. Crawford made, I have a sneaking\nsuspicion that we'll be here until next week unless I set a new\nprecedent and cut the position of the Africa for Africans Association\nshorter.\"\n\nIsobel got her laugh, including one from Homer Crawford, and went on.\n\n\"Anyway, I suppose most of you know of the AFAA and possibly many of you\nbelong to it, or at least contribute. We've been called the African\nZionist organization and perhaps that's not too far off. We are largely,\nbut not entirely an American association. We send out our teams, such as\nthe one my colleagues and I belong to, in order to speed up progress\nand, as our chairman put it, eliminate prejudices against the steps that\nmust be taken if Africa is to run down the path of progress instead of\ncrawl. We also advocate that Americans and other non-African-born\nNegroes, educated in Europe and the Americas, return to Africa to help\nin its struggles. We find positions for any such who are competent,\npreferably doctors, educators, scientists and technicians, but also\ncompetent mechanics, construction workers and so forth. We operate a\nschool in New York where we teach native languages and lingua franca\nsuch as Swahili and Songhai, in preparation for going to Africa. We\nraise our money largely from voluntary contributions, and largely from\nAmerican Negroes although we have also had government grants, donations\nfrom foundations, and from individuals of other racial backgrounds. I\nsuppose that sums it up.\"\n\nIsobel smiled at them, returned to her chair to applause, probably due\nas much to her attractive appearance as her words.\n\nCrawford said, \"When we began this meeting we had an objection that it\nbe held at all. I wonder if we might hear from that gentleman next?\"\n\nThe white haired, ramrod erect, man stood next to his chair, not\nbothering to come to the head of the room. \"You may indeed,\" he snapped.\n\"I am Bishop Manning of the United Negro Missionaries, an organization\nattempting to accomplish the only truly important task that cries for\ncompletion on this largely godless continent. Accomplish this, and all\nelse will fall into place.\"\n\nHomer Crawford said, \"I assume you refer to the conversion of the\npopulace.\"\n\n\"I do indeed. And the work others do is meaningless until that has been\naccomplished. We are bringing religion to Africa, but not through white\nmissionaries who in the past lived _off_ the natives, but through Negro\nmissionaries who live _with_ them. I call upon all of you to give up\nyour present occupations and come to our assistance.\"\n\nElmer Allan's voice was sarcastic. \"These people need less superstition,\nnot more.\"\n\nThe bishop spun on him. \"I am not speaking of superstition, young man!\"\n\nElmer Allen said. \"All religions are superstitions, except one's own.\"\n\n\"And yours?\" the Bishop barked.\n\n\"I'm an agnostic.\"\n\nThe bishop snorted his disgust and made his way to the door. There he\nturned and had his last word. \"All you do is meaningless. I pray you,\nagain, give it up and join in the Lord's work.\"\n\nHomer Crawford nodded to him. \"Thank you, Bishop Manning. I'm sure we\nwill all consider your words.\" When the older man was gone, he looked\nout over the hall again. \"Well, who is next?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA thus far speechless member of the audience, seated in the first row,\ncame to his feet. His face was serious and strained, the face of a man\nwho pushes himself beyond the point of efficiency in the vain effort to\naccomplish more by expenditure of added hours.\n\nHe came to the front and said, \"Since I'm possibly the only one here who\nalso has objections to the reason for calling this meeting, I might as\nwell have my say now.\" He half turned to Crawford, and continued. \"Mr.\nChairman, my name is Ralph Sandell and I'm an officer in the Sahara\nAfforestation Project, which, as you know, is also under the auspices of\nthe Reunited Nations, though not having any other connection with your\nown organization.\"\n\nHomer Crawford nodded. \"We know of your efforts, but why do you object\nto calling this meeting?\" He seemed mystified.\n\n\"Because, like Bishop Manning, I think your efforts misdirected. I think\nyou are expending tremendous sums of money and the work of tens of\nthousands of good men and women, in directions which in the long run\nwill hardly count.\"\n\nCrawford leaned back in surprise, waiting for the other's reasoning.\n\nRalph Sandell obliged. \"As the chairman pointed out, the problem of\npopulation explosion is a desperate one. Even today, with all the\nefforts of the Reunited Nations and of the individual countries involved\nin African aid, the population of this continent is growing at a pace\nthat will soon outstrip the arable portion of the land. Save only\nAntarctica, Africa has the smallest arable percentage of land of any of\nthe continents.\n\n\"The task of the Afforestation Project is to return the Sahara to the\nfertile land it once was. The job is a gargantuan one, but ultimately\nquite possible. Here in the south we are daming the Niger, running our\nirrigation projects farther and farther north. From the Mauritania area\non the Atlantic we are pressing inland, using water purification and\nsolar pumps to utilize the ocean. In the mountains of Morocco, the water\navailable is being utilized more efficiently than ever before, and the\nsands being pushed back. We are all familiar with Egypt's ever\nincreasingly successful efforts to exploit the Nile. In the Sahara\nitself, the new solar pumps are utilizing wells to an extent never\ndreamed of before. The oases are increasing in a geometric progression\nboth in number and in size.\" He was caught up in his own enthusiasm.\n\nCrawford said, interestedly, \"It's a fascinating project. How long do\nyou estimate it will be before the job is done?\"\n\n\"Perhaps a century. As the trees go in by the tens of millions, there\nwill be a change in climate. Forest begets moisture which in turn allows\nfor more forest.\" He turned back to the audience as a whole. \"In time we\nwill be able to farm these million upon million of acres of fertile\nland. First it must go into forest, then we can return to field\nagriculture when climate and soil have been restored. This is our prime\ntask! This is our basic need. I call upon all of you for your support\nand that of your organizations if you can bring their attention to the\ngreat need. The tasks you have set yourselves are meaningless in the\nface of this greater one. Let us be practical.\"\n\n\"Crazy man,\" Abe Baker said aloud. \"Let's be practical and cut out all\nthis jazz.\" The youthful New Yorker came to his feet. \"First of all you\njust mentioned it was going to take a century, even though it's going\nlike a geometric progression. Geometric progressions get going kind of\nslow, so I imagine that your scheme for making the Sahara fertile again,\nwon't really be under full steam until more than halfway through that\ncentury of yours, and not really ripping ahead until, maybe two thirds\nof the way. Meanwhile, what's going to happen?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon!\" Ralph Sandell said stiffly.\n\n\"That's all right,\" Abe Baker grinned at him. \"The way they figure,\npopulation doubles every thirty years, under the present rate of\nincrease. They figure there'll be three billion in the world by 1990,\nthen by 2020 there would be six billions, and in 2050, twelve billions\nand twenty-four by the time your century was up. Old boy, I suggest the\naddition of a Sahara of rich agricultural land a century from now\nwouldn't be of much importance.\"\n\n\"Ridiculous!\"\n\n\"You mean me, or you?\" Abe grinned. \"I once read an article by Donald\nKingsbury. It's reprinted these days because it finished off the subject\nonce and for all. He showed with mathematical rigor that given the\npresent rate of human population increase, and an absolutely unlimited\ntechnology that allowed instantaneous intergalactical transportation and\nthe ability to convert anything and everything into food, including\ninterstellar dust, stars, planets, everything, it would take only seven\nthousand years to turn the total mass of the total universe into human\nflesh!\"\n\nThe Sahara Afforestation official gaped at him.\n\nThe room rocked with laughter.\n\nIrritated, Sandell snapped again, \"Ridiculous!\"\n\n\"It sure is, man,\" Abe grinned. \"And the point is that the job is\neducating the people and freeing them to the point where they can\ndevelop their potentialities. Educate the African and he will see the\nsame need that does the intelligent European, American, or Russian for\nthat matter, to limit our population growth.\" He sat down again, and\nthere was a scattering of applause and more laughter.\n\nSandell, still glowering, took his seat, too.\n\nHomer Crawford, who'd been hard put not to join in the amusement, said,\n\"Thanks to both of you for some interesting points. Now, who's next? Who\nelse do we have here?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen no one else answered, a smallish man, dressed in the costume of the\nDogon, to the south, came to his feet and to the head of the room.\n\nIn a clipped British accent, he said, \"Rex Donaldson, of Nassau, the\nBahamas, in the service of Her Majesty's Government and the British\nCommonwealth. I have no team. Although our tasks are largely similar to\nthose of the African Development Project, we field men of the African\nDepartment usually work as individuals. My native pseudonym is usually\nDolo Anah.\"\n\nHe looked out over the rest. \"I have no objection to such meetings as\nthis. If nothing else, it gives chaps a bit of an opportunity to air\ngrievances. I personally have several and may as well state them now.\nAmong other things, it becomes increasingly clear that though some of\nthe organizations represented here are supposedly of the Reunited\nNations, actually they are dominated by Yankees. The Yankees are seeping\nin everywhere.\" He looked at Isobel. \"Yes, such groups as your Africa\nfor Africans Association has high flown slogans, but wherever you go,\nthere go Yankee ideas, Yankee products, Yankee schools.\"\n\nHomer Crawford's eyebrows went up. \"What is your solution? The fact is\nthat the United States has a hundred or more times the educated Negroes\nthan any other country.\"\n\nDonaldson said, doggedly, \"The British Commonwealth has done more than\nany other element in bringing progress to Africa. She should be given\nthe lead in developing the continent. A good first step would be to make\nthe pound sterling legal tender throughout the continent. And, as things\nare now, there are some _seven hundred_ different languages, not\ncounting dialects. I suggest that English be made the lingua franca\nof--\"\n\nAn excitable type, who had been first to join in the laughter at\nSandell, now jumped to his feet. \"_Un moment, Monsieur!_ The French\nCommunity long dominated a far greater portion of Africa than the\nBritish flag flew over. Not to mention that it was the most advanced\nportion. If any language was to become the lingua franca of all Africa,\nFrench would be more suitable. Your ultimate purpose, Mr. Donaldson, is\nobvious. You and your Commonwealth African Department wish to dominate\nfor political and economic reasons!\"\n\nHe turned to the others and spread his hands in a Gallic gesture. \"I\nintroduce myself, Pierre Dupaine, operative of the African Affairs\nsector of the French Community.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" Donaldson snorted. \"Getting the French out of Africa was like\npulling teeth. It took donkey's years. And now look. This chap wants to\nbring them back again.\"\n\nCrawford was knuckling the table. \"Gentlemen, Gentlemen,\" he yelled. He\nfinally had them quieted.\n\nWryly he said, \"May I ask if we have a representative from the\ngovernment of the United States?\"\n\nA lithe, inordinately well dressed young man rose from his seat in the\nrear of the hall. \"Frederic Ostrander, C.I.A.,\" he said. \"I might as\nwell tell you now, Crawford, and you other American citizens here, this\nmeeting will not meet with the approval of the State Department.\"\n\nCrawford's eyes went up. \"How do you know?\"\n\nThe C.I.A. man said evenly, \"We've already had reports that this\nconference was going to be held. I might as well inform you that a\nprotest is being made to the Sahara Division of the African Development\nProject.\"\n\nCrawford said, \"I suppose that is your privilege, sir. Now, in accord\nwith the reason for this meeting, can you tell us why your organization\nis present in Africa and what it hopes to achieve?\"\n\nOstrander looked at him testily. \"Why not? There has been considerable\ninfiltration of all of these African development organizations by\nsubversive elements....\"\n\n\"Oh, Brother,\" Cliff Jackson said.\n\n\"... And it is not the policy of the State Department to stand idly by\nwhile the Soviet Complex attempts to draw Africa from the ranks of the\nfree world.\"\n\nElmer Allen said disgustedly, \"Just what part of Africa would you really\nconsider part of the Free World?\"\n\nThe C.I.A. man stared at him coldly. \"You know what I mean,\" he rapped.\n\"And I might add, we are familiar with your record, Mr. Allen.\"\n\nHomer Crawford said, \"You've made a charge which is undoubtedly as\nunpalatable to many of those present as it is to me. Can you\nsubstantiate it? In my experience in the Sahara there is little, if any,\nfollowing of the Soviet Complex.\"\n\nAn agreeing murmur went through the room.\n\nOstrander bit out, \"Then who is subsidizing this El Hassan?\"\n\nRex Donaldson, the British Commonwealth man, came to his feet. \"That was\na matter I was going to bring up before this meeting.\"\n\nHomer Crawford, fully accompanied by Abe Baker and the rest of their\nteam, even Elmer Allen, burst into uncontrolled laughter.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nWhen Homer Crawford, Abe Baker, Kenny Ballalou, Elmer Allen and\nBey-ag-Akhamouk had laughed themselves out, Frederic Ostrander, the\nC.I.A. operative stared at them in anger. \"What's so funny?\" he snapped.\n\nFrom his seat in the middle of the hall, Pierre Dupaine, operative for\nthe French Community, said worriedly, \"_Messieurs_, this El Hassan is\nnot amusing. I, too, have heard of him. His followers are evidently\nsweeping through the Sahara. Everywhere I hear of him.\"\n\nThere was confirming murmur throughout the rest of the gathering.\n\nStill chuckling, Homer Crawford said, a hand held up for quiet, \"Please,\neveryone. Pardon the amusement of my teammates and myself. You see,\nthere is no such person as El Hassan.\"\n\n\"To the contrary!\" Ostrander snapped.\n\n\"No, please,\" Crawford said, grinning ruefully. \"You see, my team\n_invented_ him, some time ago.\"\n\nOstrander could only stare, and for once his position was backed by\neveryone in the hall, Crawford's team excepted.\n\nCrawford said doggedly, \"It came about like this. These people need a\nhero. It's in their nomad tradition. They need a leader to follow. Given\na leader, as history has often demonstrated, and the nomad will perform\nmiracles. We wished to spread the program of the African Development\nProject. Such items as the need to unite, to break down the old\nboundaries of clan and tribe and even nation, the freeing of the slave\nand serf, the upgrading of women's position, the dropping of the veil\nand haik, the need to educate the youth, the desirability of taking jobs\non the projects and to take up land on the new oases. But since we\nusually go about disguised as Enaden itinerant smiths, a poorly thought\nof caste, our ideas weren't worth much. So we invented El Hassan and\neverything we said we ascribed to him, this mysterious hero who was\ngoing to lead all North Africa to Utopia.\"\n\nJake Armstrong stood up and said, sheepishly, \"I suppose that my team\nunknowingly added to this. We heard about this mysterious El Hassan and\nhe seemed largely to be going in the same direction, and for the same\nreason--to give the rumors we were spreading weight--we ascribed the\nthings we said to him.\"\n\nSomebody farther back in the hall laughed and said, \"So did I!\"\n\nHomer Crawford extended his hands in the direction of Ostrander, palms\nupward. \"I'm sorry, sir. But there seems to be your mysterious\nsubversive.\"\n\nAngered, Ostrander snapped, \"Then you admit that it was you, yourself,\nwho have been spreading these subversive ideas?\"\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" Crawford snapped in return. \"I admit only to those\nslogans and ideas promulgated by the African Development Project. If any\nso-called subversive ideas have been ascribed to El Hassan, it has not\nbeen through my team. Frankly, I rather doubt that they have. These\npeople aren't at any ethnic period where the program of the Soviet\nComplex would appeal. They're largely in a ritual-taboo tribal society\nand no one alleging any alliance whatsoever to Marx would contend that\nyou can go from that primitive a culture to what the Soviets call\ncommunism.\"\n\n\"I'll take this up with my department chief,\" Ostrander said angrily.\n\"You haven't heard the last of it, Crawford.\" He sat down abruptly.\n\nCrawford looked out over the room. \"Anybody else we haven't heard from?\"\n\nA middle-aged, heavy-set, Western dressed man came to his feet and\ncleared his throat. \"Dr. Warren Harding Smythe, American Medical Relief.\nI assume that most of you have heard of us. An organization supported\npartially by government grant, partially by contributions by private\ncitizens and institutions, as is that of Miss Isobel Cunningham's Africa\nfor Africans Association.\" He added grimly, \"But there the resemblance\nends.\"\n\nHe looked at Homer Crawford. \"I am to be added to the number not in\nfavor of this conference. In fact, I am opposed to the presence of most\nof you here in Africa.\"\n\nCrawford nodded. \"You certainly have a right to your opinion, doctor.\nWill you elucidate?\"\n\nDr. Smythe had worked his way to the front of the room, now he looked\nout over the assemblage defiantly. \"I am not at all sure that the task\nmost of you work at is a desirable one. As you know, my own organization\nis at work bringing medical care to Africa. We build hospitals, clinics,\nabove all medical schools. Not a single one of our hospitals but is a\nschool at the same time.\"\n\nAbe Baker growled, \"Everybody knows and values your work, Doc, but\nwhat's this bit about being opposed to ours?\"\n\nSmythe looked at him distastefully. \"You people are seeking to destroy\nthe culture of these people, and, overnight thrust them into the\npressures of Twentieth Century existence. As a medical doctor, I do not\nthink them capable of assimilating such rapid change and I fear for\ntheir mental health.\"\n\nThere was a prolonged silence.\n\nCrawford said finally, \"What is the alternative to the problems I\npresented in my summation of the situation that confronts the world due\nto the backward conditions of such areas as Africa?\"\n\n\"I don't know, it isn't my field.\"\n\nThere was another silence.\n\nElmer Allen said finally, uncomfortably, \"It _is_ our field, Dr.\nSmythe.\"\n\nSmythe turned to him, his face still holding its distaste. \"I understand\nthat the greater part of you are sociologists, political scientists and\nsuch. Frankly, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think of the social\nsciences as exact ones.\"\n\nHe looked around the room and added, deliberately, \"In view of the\ncondition of the world, I do not have a great deal of respect for the\nproduct of your efforts.\"\n\nThere was an uncomfortable stirring throughout the audience.\n\nClifford Jackson said unhappily, \"We do what we must do, doctor. We do\nwhat we can.\"\n\nSmythe eyed him. He said, \"Some years ago I was impressed by a paragraph\nby a British writer named Huxley. So impressed that I copied it and have\ncarried it with me. I'll read it now.\"\n\nThe heavy-set doctor took out his wallet, fumbled in it for a moment and\nfinally brought forth an aged, many times folded, piece of yellowed\npaper.\n\nHe cleared his throat, then read:\n\n\"_To the question_ quis custodiet custodes?--_who will mount guard over\nour guardians, who will engineer the engineers?--the answer is a bland\ndenial that they need any supervision. There seems to be a touching\nbelief among certain Ph.Ds in sociology that Ph.Ds in sociology will\nnever be corrupted by power. Like Sir Galahad's, their strength is the\nstrength of ten because their heart is pure--and their heart is pure\nbecause they are scientists and have taken six thousand hours of social\nstudies. Alas, high education is not necessarily a guarantee of higher\nvirtue, or higher political wisdom._\"\n\nThe doctor finished and returned to his seat, his face still\nuncompromising.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHomer Crawford chuckled ruefully. \"The point is well taken, I suppose.\nHowever, so was the one expressed by Mr. Jackson. We do what we must,\nand what we can.\" His eyes went over the assembly. \"Is there any other\ngroup from which we haven't heard?\"\n\nWhen there was silence, he added, \"No group from the Soviet Complex?\"\n\nOstrander, the C.I.A. operative, snorted. \"Do you think they would admit\nit?\"\n\n\"Or from the Arab Union?\" Crawford pursued. \"Whether or not the Soviet\nComplex has agents in this part of Africa, we know that the Arab Union,\nbacked by Islam everywhere, has. Frankly, we of the African Development\nProject seldom see eye to eye with them which results in considerable\ndiscussion at Reunited Nations meetings.\"\n\nThere was continued silence.\n\nElmer Allen came to his feet and looked at Ostrander, his face surly. \"I\nam not an advocate of what the Soviets are currently calling communism,\nhowever, I think a point should be made here.\"\n\nOstrander stared back at him unblinkingly.\n\nAllen snorted, \"I know what you're thinking. When I was a student I\nsigned a few peace petitions, that sort of thing. How--or why they\nbothered--the C.I.A. got hold of that information, I don't know, but as\na Jamaican I am a bit ashamed of Her Majesty's Government. But all this\nis beside the point.\"\n\n\"What is your point, Elmer?\" Crawford said. \"You speak, of course, as an\nindividual not as an employee of the Reunited Nations nor even as a\nmember of my team.\"\n\n\"Our team,\" Elmer Allen reminded him. He frowned at his chief, as though\nsurprised at Crawford's stand. But then he looked back at the rest. \"I\ndon't like the fact that the C.I.A. is present at all. I grow\nincreasingly weary of the righteousness of the prying for what it calls\nsubversion. The latest definition of subversive seems to be any chap who\ndoesn't vote either Republican or Democrat in the States, or\nConservative in England.\"\n\nOstrander grunted scorn.\n\nAllen looked at him again. \"So far as this job is concerned--and by the\nlooks of things, most of us will be kept busy at it for the rest of our\nlives--I am not particularly favorable to the position of either side in\nthis never-warming cold war between you and the Soviet Complex. I have\nsuspected for some time that neither of you actually want an ending of\nit. For different reasons, possibly. So far as the States are concerned,\nI suspect an end of your fantastic military budgets would mean a\ncollapse of your economy. So far as the Soviets are concerned, I suspect\nthey use the continual _threat_ of attack by the West to keep up their\nmilitary and police powers and suppress the freedom of their people.\nWasn't it an old adage of the Romans that if you feared trouble at home,\nstir up war abroad? At any rate, I'd like to have it on the record that\nI protest the Cold War being dragged into our work in Africa--by either\nside.\"\n\n\"All right, Elmer,\" Crawford said, \"you're on record. Is that all?\"\n\n\"That's all,\" Elmer Allen said. He sat down abruptly.\n\n\"Any comment, Mr. Ostrander?\" Crawford said.\n\nOstrander grunted, \"Fuzzy thinking.\" Didn't bother with anything more.\n\nThe chairman looked out over the hall. \"Any further discussion, any\nmotions?\" He smiled and added, \"Anything--period?\"\n\nFinally Jake Armstrong came to his feet. He said, \"I don't agree with\neverything Mr. Allen just said; however, there was one item where I'll\nfollow along. The fact that most of us will be busy at this job for the\nrest of our lives--if we stick. With this in mind, the fact that we have\nlots of time, I make the following proposal. This meeting was called to\nsee if there was any prospect of we field workers co-operating on a\nfield worker's level, if we could in any way help each other, avoid\nduplication of effort, that sort of thing. I suggest now that this\nmeeting be adjourned and that all of us think it over and discuss it\nwith the other teams, the other field workers in our respective\norganizations. I propose further that another meeting be held within the\nyear and that meanwhile Mr. Crawford be elected chairman of the group\nuntil the next gathering, and that Miss Cunningham be elected secretary.\nWe can all correspond with Mr. Crawford, until the time of the next\nmeeting, giving him such suggestions as might come to us. When he sees\nfit to call the next meeting, undoubtedly he will have some concrete\nproposals to put before us.\"\n\nIsobel said, _sotto voce_, \"Secretaries invariably do all the work, why\nis it that men always nominate a woman for the job?\"\n\nJake grinned at her, \"I'll never tell.\" He sat down.\n\n\"I'll make that a motion,\" Rex Donaldson clipped out.\n\n\"Second,\" someone else called.\n\nHomer Crawford said, \"All in favor?\"\n\nThose in favor predominated considerably.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey broke up into small groups for a time, debating it out, and then\nmost left for various places for lunch.\n\nHomer Crawford, separated from the other members of his team, in the\nanimated discussions that went on about him, finally left the\nfascinating subject of what had happened to the Cuban group in Sudan,\nand who had done it, and went looking for his own lunch.\n\nHe strolled down the sand-blown street in the general direction of the\nsmaller market, in the center of Timbuktu, passing the aged, wind\ncorroded house which had once sheltered Major Alexander Gordon Laing,\nfirst white man to reach the forbidden city in the year 1826. Laing\nremained only three days before being murdered by the Tuareg who\ncontrolled the town at that time. There was a plaque on the door\nrevealing those basic facts. Crawford had read elsewhere that the city\nwas not captured until 1893 by a Major Joffre, later to become a Marshal\nof France and a prominent Allied leader in the First World War.\n\nBy chance he met Isobel in front of the large community butcher shop,\nstill operated in the old tradition by the local Gabibi and Fulbe,\nformerly Songhoi serfs. He knew of a Syrian operated restaurant nearby,\nand since she hadn't eaten either they made their way there.\n\nThe menu was limited largely to local products. Timbuktu was still\nremote enough to make transportation of frozen foodstuffs exorbitant.\nWhile they looked at the bill of fare he told her a story about his\nfirst trip to the city some years ago while he was still a student.\n\nHe had visited the local American missionary and had dinner with the\nfamily in their home. They had canned plums for desert and Homer had\npolitely commented upon their quality. The missionary had said that they\nshould be good, he estimated the quart jar to be worth something like\none hundred dollars. It seems that some kindly old lady in Iowa,\nfiguring that missionaries in such places as Timbuktu must be in dire\nneed of her State Fair prize winning canned plums, shipped off a box of\ntwelve quarts to missionary headquarters in New York. At that time,\nFrance still owned French Sudan, so it was necessary for the plums to be\nsent to Paris, and thence, eventually to Dakar. At Dakar they were\nshipped through Senegal to Bamako by narrow gauge railroad which ran\nperiodically. In Bamako they had to wait for an end to the rainy season\nso roads would be passable. By this time, a few of the jars had\nfermented and blown up, and a few others had been pilfered. When the\nroads were dry enough, a desert freight truck took the plums to Mopti,\non the Niger River where they waited again until the river was high\nenough that a tug pulling barges could navigate, by slow stages, down to\nKabara. By this time, one or two jars had been broken by inexpert\nhandling and more pilfered. In Kabara they were packed onto a camel and\ntaken to Timbuktu and delivered to the missionary. Total time elapsed\nsince leaving Iowa? Two years. Total number of jars that got through?\nOne.\n\nIsobel looked at Homer Crawford when he finished the story, and laughed.\n\"Why in the world didn't that missionary society refuse the old lady's\ngift?\"\n\nHe laughed in return and shrugged. \"They couldn't. She might get into a\nhuff and not mention them in her will. Missionary societies can't afford\nto discourage gifts.\"\n\nShe made her selection from the menu, and told the waiter in French, and\nthen settled back. She resumed the conversation. \"The cost of\nmaintaining a missionary in this sort of country must have been\nfantastic.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m,\" Crawford growled. \"I sometimes wonder how many millions upon\nmillions of dollars, pounds and francs have been plowed into this\ncontinent on such projects. This particular missionary wasn't a medical\nman and didn't even run a school and in the six years he was here didn't\nmake a single convert.\"\n\nIsobel said, \"Which brings us to our own pet projects. Homer--I can call\nyou Homer, I suppose, being your brand new secretary....\"\n\nHe grinned at her. \"I'll make that concession.\"\n\n\"... What's your own dream?\"\n\nHe broke some bread, automatically doing it with his left hand, as\nprescribed in the Koran. They both noticed it, and both laughed.\n\n\"I'm conditioned,\" he said.\n\n\"Me, too,\" Isobel admitted. \"It's all I can do to use a knife and fork.\"\n\nHe went back to her question, scowling. \"My dream? I don't know. Right\nnow I feel a little depressed about it all. When Elmer Allen spoke about\nspending the rest of our lives on this job, I suddenly realized that was\nabout it. And, you know\"--he looked up at her--\"I don't particularly\nlike Africa. I'm an American.\"\n\nShe looked at him oddly. \"Then why stay here?\"\n\n\"Because there's so much that needs to be done.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're right and what Cliff Jackson said to the doctor was\ncorrect, too. We all do what we must do and what we can do.\"\n\n\"Well, that brings us back to your question. What is my own dream? I'm\nafraid I'm too far along in life to acquire new ones, and my basic dream\nis an American one.\"\n\n\"And that is--?\" Isobel prompted.\n\nHe shrugged again, slightly uncomfortable under the scrutiny of this\npretty girl. \"I'm a sociologist, Isobel. I suppose I seek Utopia.\"\n\nShe frowned at him as though disappointed. \"Is Utopia possible?\"\n\n\"No, but there is always the search for it. It's a goal that recedes as\nyou approach, which is as it should be. Heaven help mankind if we ever\nachieve it; we'll be through because there will be no place to go, and\nman needs to strive.\"\n\nThey had finished their soup and the entree had arrived. Isobel picked\nat it, her ordinarily smooth forehead wrinkled. \"The way I see it,\nUtopia is not heaven. Heaven is perfect, but Utopia is an engineering\noptimum, the best-possible-human-techniques. Therefore we will not have\n_perfect_ justice in Utopia, nor will _everyone_ get the exactly proper\ntreatment. We design for optimum--not perfection. But granting this,\nthen attainment is possible.\"\n\nShe took a bite of the food before going on thoughtfully. \"In fact, I\nwonder if, during man's history, he hasn't obtained his Utopias from\ntime to time. Have you ever heard the adage that any form of government\nworks fine and produces a Utopia provided it is managed by wise,\nbenevolent and competent rulers?\" She laughed and said mischievously,\n\"Both Heaven and Hell are traditionally absolute monarchies--despotisms.\nThe form of government evidently makes no difference, it's who runs it\nthat determines.\"\n\nCrawford was shaking his head. \"I've heard the adage but I don't accept\nit. Under certain socio-economic conditions the best of men, and the\nwisest, could do little if they had the wrong form of government.\nSuppose, for instance, you had a government which was a\nmilitary-theocracy which is more or less what existed in Mexico at the\ntime of the Cortez conquest. Can you imagine such a government working\nefficiently if the socio-economic system had progressed to the point\nwhere there were no longer wars and where practically everyone were\natheists, or, at least, agnostics?\"\n\nShe had to laugh at his ludicrous example. \"That's a rather silly\nsituation, isn't it? Such wise, benevolent men, would change the\ngovernmental system.\"\n\nCrawford pushed his point. \"Not necessarily. Here's a better example.\nImmediately following the American Revolution, some of the best, wisest\nand most competent men the political world has ever seen were at the\nhead of the government of Virginia. Such men as Jefferson, Madison,\nMonroe, Washington. Their society was based on chattel slavery and they\nbuilt a Utopia _for themselves_ but certainly not for the slaves who\nout-numbered them. Not that they weren't kindly and good men. A man of\nJefferson's caliber, I am sure, would have done anything in the world\nfor those darkies of his--except get off their backs. Except to grant\nthem the liberty and the right to pursue happiness that he demanded for\nhimself. He was blinded by self interest, and the interests of his\nclass.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they didn't want liberty,\" Isobel mused. \"Slavery isn't\nnecessarily an unhappy life.\"\n\n\"I never thought it was. And I'm the first to admit that at a certain\nstage in the evolution of society, it was absolutely necessary. If\nsociety was to progress, then there had to be a class that was freed\nfrom daily drudgery of the type forced on primitive man if he was to\nsurvive. They needed the leisure time to study, to develop, to invent.\nWith the products of their studies, they were able to advance all\nsociety. However, so long as slavery is maintained, be it necessary or\nnot, you have no Utopia. There is no Utopia so long as one man denies\nanother his liberty be it under chattel slavery, feudalism, or\nwhatever.\"\n\nIsobel said dryly, \"I see why you say your Utopia will never be reached,\nthat it continually recedes.\"\n\nHe laughed, ruefully. \"Don't misunderstand. I think that particular goal\ncan and will be reached. My point was that by the time we reach it,\nthere will be a new goal.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl, finished with her main dish, sat back in her chair, and looked\nat him from the side of her eyes, as though wondering whether or not he\ncould take what she was about to say in the right way. She said, slowly,\n\"You know, with possibly a few exceptions, you can't enslave a man if he\ndoesn't want to be a slave. For instance, the white man was never able\nto enslave the Amerind; he died before he would become a slave. The\nmajority of Jefferson's slaves _wanted to be slaves_. If there were\nthose among them that had the ability to revolt against slave\npsychology, a Jefferson would quickly promote such. A valuable human\nbeing will be treated in a manner proportionate to his value. A wise,\ncompetent, trustworthy slave became the major domo of the master's\nestate--with privileges and authority actually greater than that of free\nemployees of the master.\"\n\nCrawford thought about that for a moment. \"I'll take that,\" he said.\n\"What's the point you're trying to make?\"\n\n\"I, too, was set a-thinking by some of the things said at the meeting,\nHomer. In particular, what Dr. Smythe had to say. Homer, are we sure\nthese people _want_ the things we are trying to give them?\"\n\nHe looked at her uncomfortably. \"No they don't,\" he said bluntly.\n\"Otherwise we wouldn't be here, either your AFAA or my African\nDevelopment Project. We utilize persuasion, skullduggery, and even force\nto subvert their institutions, to destroy their present culture. Yes.\nI've known this a long time.\"\n\n\"Then how do you justify your being here?\"\n\nHe grinned sourly. \"Let's put it this way. Take the new government in\nEgypt. They send the army into some of the small back-country towns with\nbayoneted rifles, and orders to use them if necessary. The villagers are\nforced to poison their ancient village wells--one of the highest of\nimaginable crimes in such country, imposed on them ruthlessly. Then they\nare forced to dig new ones in new places that are not intimately\nentangled with their own sewage drainage. Naturally they hate the\ngovernment. In other towns, the army has gone in and, at gun point,\nforced the parents to give up their children, taken the children away\nin trucks and 'imprisoned' them in schools. Look, back in the States\nwe have trouble with the Amish, who don't want their children to\nbe taught modern ways. What sort of reaction do you think the\ntradition-ritual-tabu-tribesmen of the six thousand year old Egyptian\nculture have to having modern education imposed on their children?\"\n\nIsobel was frowning at him.\n\nCrawford wound it up. \"That's the position we're in. That's what we're\ndoing. Giving them things they need, in spite of the fact they don't\nwant them.\"\n\n\"But _why_?\"\n\nHe said, \"You know the answer to that as well as I do. It's like giving\nmedical care to Typhoid Mary, in spite of the fact that she didn't want\nit and didn't believe such things as typhoid microbes existed. We had to\nprotect the community against her. In the world today, such backward\nareas as Africa are potential volcanoes. We've got to deal with them\nbefore they erupt.\"\n\nThe waiter came with the bill and Homer took it.\n\nIsobel said, \"Let's go Dutch on that.\"\n\nHe grinned at her. \"Consider it a donation to the AFAA.\"\n\nOut on the street again, they walked slowly in the direction of the old\nadministration buildings where both had left their means of\ntransportation.\n\nIsobel, who was frowning thoughtfully, evidently over the things that\nhad been said, said, \"Let's go this way. I'd like to see the old Great\nMosque, in the Dyingerey Ber section of town. It's always fascinated\nme.\"\n\nCrawford said, looking at her and appreciating her attractiveness, all\nover again, \"You know Timbuktu quite well, don't you?\"\n\n\"I've just finished a job down in Kabara, and it's only a few miles\naway.\"\n\n\"Just what sort of thing do you do?\"\n\nShe shrugged and made a moue. \"Our little team concentrates on breaking\ndown the traditional position of women in these cultures. To get them to\ndrop the veil, go to school. That sort of thing. It's a long story\nand--\"\n\nHomer Crawford suddenly and violently pushed her to the side and to the\nground and at the same time dropped himself and rolled frantically to\nthe shelter of an adobe wall which had once been part of a house but now\nwas little more than waist high.\n\n\"Down!\" he yelled at her.\n\nShe bug-eyed him as though he had gone suddenly mad.\n\nThere was a heavy, stub-nosed gun suddenly in his hand. He squirmed\nforward on elbows and belly, until he reached the corner.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she blurted.\n\nHe said grimly, \"See those three holes in the wall above you?\"\n\nShe looked up, startled.\n\nHe said, grimly, \"They weren't there a moment ago.\"\n\nWhat he was saying, dawned upon her. \"But ... but I heard no shots.\"\n\nHe cautiously peered around the wall, and was rewarded with a puff of\nsand inches from his face. He pulled his head back and his lips thinned\nover his teeth. He said to her, \"Efficiently silenced guns have been\naround for quite a spell. Whoever that is, is up there in the mosque.\nListen, beat your way around by the back streets and see if you can find\nthe members of my team, especially Abe Baker or Bey-ag-Akhamouk. Tell\nthem what happened and that I think I've got the guy pinned down. That\nmosque is too much out in the open for him to get away without my seeing\nhim.\"\n\n\"But ... but who in the world would want to shoot you, Homer?\"\n\n\"Search me,\" he growled. \"My team has never operated in this immediate\narea.\"\n\n\"But then, it must be someone who was at the meeting.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\n\"That is was,\" Homer said grimly. \"Now, go see if you can find my lads,\nwill you? This joker is going to fall right into our laps. It's going to\nbe interesting to find out who hates the idea of African development so\nmuch that they're willing to commit assassination.\"\n\nBut it didn't work out that way.\n\nIsobel found the other teammates one by one, and they came hurrying up\nfrom different directions to the support of their chief. They had been a\nteam for years and operating as they did and where they did, each man\nsurvived only by selfless co-operation with all the others. In action,\nthey operated like a single unit, their ability to co-operate almost as\nthough they had telepathic communication.\n\nFrom where he lay, Homer Crawford could see Bey-ag-Akhamouk,\nTommy-Noiseless in hands, snake in from the left, running low and\nreaching a vantage point from which he could cover one flank of the\nancient adobe mosque. Homer waved to him and Bey made motions to\nindicate that one of the others was coming in from the other side.\n\nHomer waited for a few more minutes, then waved to Bey to cover him. The\nstreets were empty at this time of midday when the Sahara sun drove the\ntown's occupants into the coolness of dark two-foot-thick walled houses.\nIt was as though they were operating in a ghost town. Homer came to his\nfeet and handgun in fist made a dash for the front entrance.\n\nBey's light automatic _flic flic flicked_ its excitement and dust and\ndirt enveloped the wall facing Crawford. Homer reached the doorway,\nstood there for a full two minutes while he caught his breath. From the\nside of his eye he could see Elmer Allen, his excellent teeth bared as\nalways when the Jamaican went into action, come running up to the right\nin that half crouch men automatically go into in combat, instinctively\npresenting as small a target as possible. He was evidently heading for a\nside door or window.\n\nThe object now was to refrain from killing the sniper. The important\nthing was to be able to question him. Perhaps here was the answer to the\nmassacre of the Cubans. Homer took another deep breath, smashed the door\nopen with a heavy shoulder and dashed inward and immediately to one\nside. At the same moment, Abe Baker, Tommy-Noiseless in hand, came in\nfrom the rear door, his eyes darting around trying to pierce the gloom\nof the unlighted building.\n\nElmer Allen erupted through a window, rolled over on the floor and came\nto rest, his gun trained.\n\n\"Where is he?\" Abe snapped.\n\nHomer motioned with his head. \"Must be up in the remains of the\nminaret.\"\n\nAbe got to the creaking, age-old stairway first. In cleaning out a\nhostile building, the idea is to move fast and keep on the move. Stop,\nand you present a target.\n\nBut there was no one in the minaret.\n\n\"Got away,\" Homer growled. His face was puzzled. \"I felt sure we'd have\nhim.\"\n\nBey-ag-Akhamouk entered. He grunted his disappointment. \"What happened,\nanyway? That girl Isobel said a sniper took some shots at you and you\nfigure it must've been somebody at the meeting.\"\n\n\"Somebody at the meeting?\" Abe said blankly. \"What kind of jazz is that?\nYou flipping, man?\"\n\nHomer looked at him strangely.\n\n\"Who else could it be, Abe? We've never operated this far south. None of\nthe inhabitants in this area even know us, and it certainly couldn't\nhave been an attempt at robbery.\"\n\n\"There were some cats at that meeting didn't appreciate our ideas, man,\nbut I can't see that old preacher or Doc Smythe trying to put the slug\non you.\"\n\nKenny Ballalou came in on the double, gun in hand, his face anxious.\n\nAbe said sarcastically, \"Man, we'd all be dead if we had to wait on\nyou.\"\n\n\"That girl Isobel. She said somebody took a shot at the chief.\"\n\nHomer explained it, sourly. A sniper had taken a few shots at him, then\nmanaged to get away.\n\nIsobel entered, breathless, followed by Jake Armstrong.\n\nAbe grunted, \"Let's hold another convention. This is like old home town\nweek.\"\n\nHer eyes went from one of them to the other. \"You're not hurt?\"\n\n\"Nobody hurt, but the cat did all the shooting got away,\" Abe said\nunhappily.\n\nJake said, and his voice was worried, \"Isobel told me what happened. It\nsounds insane.\"\n\nThey discussed it for a while and got exactly nowhere. Their\nconversation was interrupted by a clicking at Homer Crawford's wrist. He\nlooked down at the tiny portable radio.\n\n\"Excuse me for a moment,\" he said to the others and went off a dozen\nsteps or so to the side.\n\nThey looked after him.\n\nElmer Allen said sourly, \"Another assignment. What we need is a union.\"\n\nAbe adopted the idea. \"Man! Time and a half for overtime.\"\n\n\"With a special cost of living clause--\" Kenny Ballalou added.\n\n\"And housing and dependents allotment!\" Abe crowed.\n\nThey all looked at him.\n\nBey tried to imitate the other's beatnik patter. \"Like, you got any\ndependents, man?\"\n\nAbe made a mark in the sand on the mosque's floor with the toe of his\nshoe, like a schoolboy up before the principal for an infraction of\nrules, and registered embarrassment. \"Well, there's that cute little\nTuareg girl up north.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" Isobel said. \"And all these years you've been leading me on.\"\n\nHomer Crawford returned and his face was serious. \"That does it,\" he\nmuttered disgustedly. \"The fat's in the fire.\"\n\n\"Like, what's up, man?\"\n\nCrawford looked at his right-hand man. \"There are demonstrations in\nMopti. Riots.\"\n\n\"Mopti?\" Jake Armstrong said, surprised. \"Our team was working there\njust a couple of months ago. I thought everything was going fine in\nMopti.\"\n\n\"They're going fine, all right,\" Crawford growled. \"So well, that the\nlocal populace wants to speed up even faster.\"\n\nThey were all looking their puzzlement at him.\n\n\"The demonstrations are in favor of El Hassan.\"\n\nTheir faces turned blank. Crawford's eyes swept his teammates. \"Our\ninstructions are to get down there and do what we can to restore order.\nCome on, let's go. I'm going to have to see if I can arrange some\ntransportation. It'd take us two days to get there in our outfits.\"\n\nJake Armstrong said, \"Wait a minute, Homer. My team was heading back for\nDakar for a rest and new assignments. We'd be passing Mopti anyway. How\nmany of you are there, five? If you don't haul too much luggage with\nyou; we could give you a lift.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Homer told him. \"We'll take you up on that. Abe, Elmer, let's\nget going. We'll have to repack. Bey, Kenny, see about finding some\nplace we can leave the lorries until we come back. This job shouldn't\ntake more than a few days at most.\"\n\n\"Huh,\" Abe said. \"I hope you got plans, man. How do you go about\nstopping demonstrations in favor of a legend you created yourself?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMopti, also on the Niger, lies approximately three hundred kilometers to\nthe south and slightly west of Timbuktu, as the bird flies. However, one\ndoes not travel as the bird flies in the Niger bend. Not even when one\ngoes by aircraft. A forced landing in the endless swamps, bogs, shallow\nlakes and river tributaries which make up the Niger at this point, would\nbe suicidal. The whole area is more like the Florida Everglades than a\nriver, and a rescue team would be hard put to find your wreckage. There\nare no roads, no railroads. Traffic follows the well marked navigational\nroute of the main channel.\n\nHomer Crawford had been sitting quietly next to Cliff Jackson who was\npiloting. Isobel and Jake Armstrong were immediately behind them and Abe\nand the rest of Crawford's team took up the remainder of the aircraft's\neight seats. Abe was regaling the others with his customary chaff.\n\nOut of a clear sky, Crawford said bitterly, \"Has it occurred to any of\nyou that what we're doing here in North Africa is committing genocide?\"\n\nThe others stared at him, taken aback. Isobel said, \"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"Genocide,\" Crawford said bitterly. \"We're doing here much what the\nwhite men did when they cleared the Amerinds from the plains, the\nmountains and forests of North America.\"\n\nIsobel, Cliff and Jake frowned their puzzlement. Abe said, \"Man, you\njust don't make sense. And, among other things, there're more Indians in\nthe United States than there was when Columbus landed.\"\n\nCrawford shook his head. \"No. They're a different people. Those cultures\nthat inhabited the United States when the first white men came, are\ngone.\" He shook his head as though soured by his thoughts. \"Take the\nSioux. They had a way of life based on the buffalo. So the whites\ndeliberately exterminated the buffalo. It made the plains Indians'\nculture impossible. A culture based on buffalo herds cannot exist if\nthere are no buffalo.\"\n\n\"I keep telling you, man, there's more Sioux now than there were then.\"\n\nCrawford still shook his head. \"But they're a different people, a\ndifferent race, a different culture. A mere fraction, say ten per cent,\nof the original Sioux, might have adapted to the new life. The others\nbeat their heads out against the new ways. They fought--the Sitting Bull\nwars took place after the buffalo were already gone--they drank\nthemselves to death on the white man's firewater, they committed\nsuicide; in a dozen different ways they called it quits. Those that\nsurvived, the ten per cent, were the exceptions. They were able to\nadapt. They had a built-in genetically-conferred self discipline enough\nto face the new problems. Possibly eighty per cent of their children\ncouldn't face the new problems either and they in turn went under. But\nby now, a hundred years later, the majority of the Sioux nation have\nprobably adapted. But, you see, the point I'm trying to make? They're\nnot the _real_ Sioux, the original Sioux; they're a new breed. The\nplains living, buffalo based culture, Sioux are all dead. The white men\nkilled them.\"\n\nJake Armstrong was scowling. \"I get your point, but what has it to do\nwith our work here in North Africa?\"\n\n\"We're doing the same thing to the Tuareg, the Teda and the Chaambra,\nand most of the others in the area in which we operate. The type of\nhuman psychology that's based on the nomad life can't endure settled\ncommunity living. Wipe out the nomad way of life and these human beings\nmust die.\"\n\nAbe said, unusually thoughtful, \"I see what you mean, man. _Fish gotta\nswim, bird gotta fly_--and nomad gotta roam. He flips if he doesn't.\"\n\nHomer Crawford pursued it. \"Sure, there'll be Tuareg afterward ... but\nall descended from the fraction of deviant Tuareg who were so\nabnormal--speaking from the Tuareg viewpoint--that they liked settled\ncommunity life.\" He rubbed a hand along his jawbone, unhappily. \"Put it\nthis way. Think of them as a tribe of genetic claustrophobes. No matter\nwhat a claustrophobe promises, he can't work in a mine. He has no choice\nbut to break his promise and escape ... or kill himself trying.\"\n\nIsobel was staring at him. \"What you say, is disturbing, Homer. I didn't\ncome to Africa to destroy a people.\"\n\nHe looked back at her, oddly. \"None of us did.\"\n\nCliff said from behind the aircraft's controls, \"If you believe what\nyou're saying, how do you justify being here yourself?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Crawford said unhappily. \"I don't know what started me\non this kick, but I seem to have been doing more inner searching this\npast week or so than I have in the past couple of decades. And I don't\nseem to come up with much in the way of answers.\"\n\n\"Well, man,\" Abe said. \"If you find any, let us know.\"\n\nJake said, his voice warm, \"Look Homer, don't beat yourself about this.\nWhat you say figures, but you've got to take it from this angle. The\nplains Indians had to go. The world is developing too fast for a few\nthousand people to tie up millions of acres of some of the most fertile\nfarm land anywhere, because they needed it for their game--the\nbuffalo--to run on.\"\n\n\"Um-m-m,\" Homer said, his voice lacking conviction.\n\n\"Maybe it's unfortunate the _way_ it was done. The story of the\nAmerican's dealing with the Amerind isn't a pretty one, and usually\ncomfortably ignored when we pat ourselves on the back these days and\ntell ourselves what a noble, honest, generous and peace loving people we\nare. But it did have to be done, and the job we're doing in North Africa\nhas to be done, too.\"\n\nCrawford said softly, \"And sometimes it isn't very pretty either.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMopti as a town had grown. Once a small river port city of about five\nthousand population, it had been a river and caravan crossroads somewhat\nsimilar to Timbuktu, and noted in particular for its spice market and\nits Great Mosque, probably the largest building of worship ever made of\nmud. Plastered newly at least twice a year with fresh adobe, at a\ndistance of only a few hundred feet the Great Mosque, in the middle of\nthe day and in the glare of the Sudanese sun, looks as though made of\ngold. From the air it is more attractive than the grandest Gothic\ncathedrals of Europe.\n\nIsobel pointed. \"There, the Great Mosque.\"\n\nElmer Allen said, \"Yes, and there. See those mobs?\" He looked at Homer\nCrawford and said sourly, \"Let's try and remember who it was who first\nthought of the El Hassan idea. Then we can blame it on him.\"\n\nKenny Ballalou grumbled, \"We all thought about it. Remember, we pulled\ninto Tessalit and found that prehistoric refrigerator that worked on\nkerosene and there were a couple of dozen quarts of Norwegian beer, of\nall things, in it.\"\n\n\"And we bought them all,\" Abe recalled happily. \"Man, we hung one on.\"\n\nHomer Crawford said to Cliff, \"The Mopti airport is about twelve miles\nover to the east of the town.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. Been here before,\" Cliff said. He called back to\nBallalou, \"And then what happened?\"\n\n\"We took the beer out into the desert and sat on a big dune. You can\njust begin to see the Southern Cross from there. Hangs right on the\nhorizon. Beautiful.\"\n\nBey said, \"I've never heard Kenny wax poetic before. I don't know which\nsounds more lyrical, though, that cold beer or the Southern Cross.\"\n\nKenny said, \"Anyway, that's when El Hassan was dreamed up. We kicked the\nidea around until the beer was all gone. And when we awoke in the\nmorning, complete with hangover, we had the gimmick which we hung all\nour propaganda on.\"\n\n\"El Hassan is turning out to be a hangover all right,\" Elmer Allen\ngrunted, choosing to misinterpret his teammate's words. He peered down\nbelow. \"And there the poor blokes are, rioting in favor of the product\nof those beer bottles.\"\n\n\"It was crazy beer, man,\" Abe protested. \"Real crazy.\"\n\nHomer Crawford said, \"I wish headquarters had more information to give\nus on this. All they said was there were demonstrations in favor of El\nHassan and they were afraid if things went too far that some of the hard\nwork that's been done here the past ten years might dissolve in the\nexcitement; Dogon, Mosse, Tellum, Sonrai start fighting among each\nother.\"\n\nJake Armstrong said, \"That's not my big worry. I'm afraid some ambitious\nlad will come along and supply what these people evidently want.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" Cliff said.\n\n\"They want a leader. Someone to come out of the wilderness and lead them\nto the promised land.\" The older man grumbled sourly. \"All your life you\nfigure you're in favor of democracy. You devote your career to expanding\nit. Then you come to a place like North Africa. You're just kidding\nyourself. Democracy is meaningless here. They haven't got to the point\nwhere they can conceive of it.\"\n\n\"And--\" Elmer Allen prodded.\n\nJake Armstrong shrugged. \"When it comes to governments and social\ninstitutions people usually come up with what they want, sooner or\nlater. If those mobs down there want a leader, they'll probably wind up\nwith one.\" He grunted deprecation. \"And then probably we'll be able to\nsay, Heaven help them.\"\n\nIsobel puckered her lips. \"A leader isn't necessarily a misleader,\nJake.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not necessarily,\" he said. \"However, it's an indication of how\nfar back these people are, how much work we've still got to do, when\nthat's what they're seeking.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm landing,\" Cliff said. \"The airport looks free of any kind of\nmanifestations.\"\n\n\"That's a good word,\" Abe said. \"Manifestations. Like, I'll have to\nremember that one. Man's been to school and all that jazz.\"\n\nCliff grinned at him. \"Where'd you like to get socked, beatnik?\"\n\n\"About two feet above my head,\" Abe said earnestly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe aircraft had hardly come to a halt before Homer Crawford clipped\nout, \"All right, boys, time's a wasting. Bey, you and Kenny get over to\nthose administration buildings and scare us up some transportation. Use\nno more pressure than you have to. Abe, you and Elmer start getting our\nequipment out of the luggage--\"\n\nJake Armstrong said suddenly, \"Look here, Homer, do you need any help?\"\n\nCrawford looked at him questioningly.\n\nJake said, \"Isobel, Cliff, what do you think?\"\n\nIsobel said quickly, \"I'm game. I don't know what they'll say back at\nAFAA headquarters, though. Our co-operating with a Sahara Development\nProject team.\"\n\nCliff scowled. \"I don't know. Frankly, I took this job purely for the\ndough, and as outlined it didn't include getting roughed up in some riot\nthat doesn't actually concern the job.\"\n\n\"Oh, come along, Cliff,\" Isobel urged. \"It'll give you some experience\nyou don't know when you'll be able to use.\"\n\nHe shrugged his acceptance, grudgingly.\n\nJake Armstrong looked back at Homer Crawford. \"If you need us, we're\navailable.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Crawford said briefly, and turned off the unhappy stare he'd\nbeen giving Cliff. \"We can use all the manpower we can get. You people\never worked with mobs before?\"\n\nBey and Kenny climbed from the plane and made their way at a trot toward\nthe airport's administration buildings. Abe and Elmer climbed out, too,\nand opened the baggage compartment in the rear of the aircraft.\n\n\"Well, no,\" Jake Armstrong said.\n\n\"It's quite a technique. Mostly you have to play it by ear, because\nnothing is so changeable as the temper of a mob. Always keep in mind\nthat to begin with, at least, only a small fraction of the crowd is\nreally involved in what's going on. Possibly only one out of ten is\ninterested in the issue. The rest start off, at least, as idle\nobservers, watching the fun. That's one of the first things you've got\nto control. Don't let the innocent bystanders become excited and get\ninto the spirit of it all. Once they do, then you've got a mess on your\nhands.\"\n\nIsobel, Jake and Cliff listened to him in fascination.\n\nCliff said uncomfortably, \"Well, what do we do to get the whole thing\nback to tranquillity? What I mean is, how do we end these\ndemonstrations?\"\n\n\"We bore them to tears,\" Homer growled.\n\nThey looked at him blankly.\n\n\"We assume leadership of the whole thing and put up speakers.\"\n\nJake protested, \"You sound as though you're sustaining not placating\nit.\"\n\n\"We put up speakers and they speak and speak, and speak. It's almost\nlike a fillibuster. You don't say anything particularly interesting, and\ncertainly nothing exciting. You agree with the basic feeling of the\ndemonstrating mob, certainly you say nothing to antagonize them. In this\ncase we speak in favor of El Hassan and his great, and noble, and\ninspiring, and so on and so forth, teachings. We speak in not too loud a\nvoice, so that those in the rear have a hard time hearing, if they can\nhear at all.\"\n\nCliff said worriedly, \"Suppose some of the hotheads get tired of this\nand try to take over?\"\n\nHomer said evenly, \"We have a couple of bully boys in the crowd to take\ncare of them.\"\n\nJake twisted his mouth, in objection. \"Might that not strike the spark\nthat would start up violence?\"\n\nHomer Crawford grinned and began climbing out of the plane. \"Not with\nthe weapons we use.\"\n\n\"Weapons!\" Isobel snapped. \"Do you intend to use weapons on those poor\npeople? Why, it was you yourself, you and your team, who started this\nwhole El Hassan movement. I'm shocked. I've heard about your reputation,\nyou and the Sahara Development Project teams. Your ruthlessness--\"\n\nCrawford chuckled ruefully and held up a hand to stem the tide. \"Hold\nit, hold it,\" he said. \"These are special weapons, and, after all, we've\ngot to keep those crowds together long enough to bore them to the point\nwhere they go home.\"\n\nAbe came up with an armful of what looked something like tent-poles.\n\"The quarterstaffs, eh, Homer?\"\n\n\"Um-m-m,\" Crawford said. \"Under the circumstances.\"\n\n\"Quarterstaffs?\" Cliff Jackson ejaculated.\n\nAbe grinned at him. \"Man, just call them pilgrim's staffs. The least\nobnoxious looking weapon in the world.\" He looked at Cliff and Jake.\n\"You two cats been checked out on quarterstaffs?\"\n\nJake said, \"The more I talk to you people, the less I seem to understand\nwhat's going on. Aren't quarterstaffs what, well, Robin Hood and his\nMerry Men used to fight with?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Homer said. He took one from Abe and grasping it\nexpertly with two hands whirled it about, getting its balance. Then\nsuddenly, he drooped, leaning on it as a staff. His face expressed\nweariness. His youth and virility seemed to drop away and suddenly he\nwas an aged religious pilgrim as seen throughout the Moslem world.\n\n\"I'll be damned,\" Cliff blurted. \"Oop, sorry Isobel.\"\n\n\"I'll be damned, too,\" Isobel said. \"What in the world can you do with\nthat, Homer? I was thinking in terms of you mowing those people down\nwith machine guns or something.\"\n\nCrawford stood erect again laughingly, and demonstrated. \"It's probably\nthe most efficient handweapon ever devised. The weapon of the British\nyeoman. With one of these you can disarm a swordsman in a matter of\nseconds. A good man with a quarterstaff can unhorse a knight in armor\nand batter him to death, in a minute or so. The only other handweapon\ncapable of countering it is another quarterstaff. Watch this, with the\nfavorable two-hand leverage the ends of the staff can be made to move at\ninvisibly high speeds.\"\n\nBey and Kenny drove up in an aged wheeled truck and Abe and Elmer began\nloading equipment.\n\nCrawford looked at Bey who said apologetically, \"I had to liberate it.\nDidn't have time for all the dickering the guy wanted to go through.\"\n\nCrawford grunted and looked at Isobel. \"Those European clothes won't do.\nWe've got some spare things along. You can improvise. Men and women's\nclothes don't differ that much around here.\"\n\n\"I'll make out all right,\" Isobel said. \"I can change in the plane.\"\n\n\"Hey, Isobel,\" Abe called out. \"Why not dress up like one of these Dogon\nbabes?\"\n\n\"Some chance,\" Isobel hissed menacingly at him. \"A strip tease you want,\nyet. You'll see me in a haik and like it, wise guy.\"\n\n\"Shucks,\" Abe grinned.\n\nCrawford looked critically at the clothing of Jake and Cliff. \"I suppose\nyou'll do in western stuff,\" he said. \"After all, this El Hassan is\nsupposed to be the voice of the future. A lot of his potential followers\nwill already be wearing shirts and pants. Don't look _too_ civilized,\nthough.\"\n\nWhen Isobel returned, Crawford briefed his seven followers. They were to\noperate in teams of two. One of his men, complete with quarterstaff\nwould accompany each of the others. Abe with Jake, Bey with Cliff, and\nhe'd be with Isobel. Elmer and Kenny would be the other twosome, and,\nboth armed with quarterstaffs would be troubleshooters.\n\n\"We're playing it off the cuff,\" he said. \"Do what comes naturally to\nget this thing under control. If you run into each other, co-operate, of\ncourse. If there's trouble, use your wrist radios.\" He looked at Abe and\nBey. \"I know you two are packing guns underneath those _gandouras_. I\nhope you know enough not to use them.\"\n\nAbe and Bey looked innocent.\n\nHomer turned and led the way into the truck. \"O.K., let's get going.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nDriving into town over the dusty, pocked road, Homer gave the newcomers\nto his group more background on the care and control of the genus _mob_.\nHe was obviously speaking through considerable experience.\n\n\"Using these quarterstaffs brings to mind some of the other supposedly\ninnoxious devices used by police authorities in controlling unruly\ndemonstrations,\" he said. \"Some of them are beauties. For instance, I\nwas in Tangier when the Moroccans put on their revolution against the\nFrench and for the return of the Sultan. The rumor went through town\nthat the mob was going to storm the French Consulate the next day.\nDuring the night, the French brought in elements of the Foreign Legion\nand entrenched the consulate grounds. But their commander had another\nproblem. Journalists were all over town and so were tourists. Tangier\nwas still supposedly an international zone and the French were in no\nposition to slaughter the citizens. So they brought in some special\nequipment. One item was a vehicle that looked quite a bit like a\ngasoline truck, but was filled with water and armored against thrown\ncobblestones and such. On the roof of the cabin was what looked\nsomething like a fifty caliber but which was actually a hose which shot\nwater at terrific pressure. When the mob came, the French unlimbered\nthis vehicle and all the journalists could say was that the mob was\ndispersed by squirting water on it, which doesn't sound too bad after\nall.\"\n\nIsobel said, \"Well, certainly that's preferable to firing on them.\"\n\nHomer looked at her oddly. \"Possibly. However, I was standing next to\nthe Moorish boy who was cut entirely in half by the pressure spray of\nwater.\"\n\nThe expression on the girl's face sickened.\n\nHomer said, \"They had another interesting device for dispersing mobs. It\nwas a noise bomb. The French set off several.\"\n\n\"A noise bomb?\" Cliff said. \"I don't get it.\"\n\n\"They make a tremendous noise, but do nothing else. However, members of\nthe mob who aren't really too interested in the whole thing--just sort\nof along for the fun--figure that things are getting earnest and that\nthe troops are shelling them. So they remember some business they had\nelsewhere and take off.\"\n\nIsobel said suddenly, \"You like this sort of work, don't you?\"\n\nElmer Allen grunted bitterly.\n\n\"No,\" Homer Crawford said flatly. \"I don't. But I like the goal.\"\n\n\"And the end justifies the means?\"\n\nHomer Crawford said slowly, \"I've never answered that to my own\nsatisfaction. But I'll say this. I've never met a person, no matter how\nidealistic, no matter how much he played lip service to the contention\nthat the ends do not justify the means, who did not himself use the\nmeans he found available to reach the ends he believed correct. It seems\nto be a matter of each man feeling the teaching applies to everyone\nelse, but that he is free to utilize any means to achieve his own noble\nends.\"\n\n\"Man, all that jazz is too much for me,\" Abe said.\n\nThey were entering the outskirts of Mopti. Small groups of obviously\nexcited Africans of various tribal groups, were heading for the center\nof town.\n\n\"Abe, Jake,\" Crawford said. \"We'll drop you here. Mingle around. We'll\nhold the big meeting in front of the Great Mosque in an hour or so.\"\n\n\"Crazy,\" Abe said, dropping off the back of the truck which Kenny\nBallalou, who was driving, brought almost to a complete stop. The older\nJake followed him.\n\nThe rest went on a quarter of a mile and dropped Bey and Cliff.\n\nHomer said to Kenny, \"Park the truck somewhere near the spice market.\nPreferably inside some building, if you can. For all we know, they're\nalready turning over vehicles and burning them.\"\n\nCrawford and Isobel dropped off near the pottery market, on the banks of\nthe Niger. The milling throngs here were largely women. Elements of half\na dozen tribes and races were represented.\n\nHomer Crawford stood a moment. He ran a hand back over his short hair\nand looked at her. \"I don't know,\" he muttered. \"Now I'm sorry we\nbrought you along.\" He leaned on his staff and looked at her worriedly.\n\"You're not very ... ah, husky, are you?\"\n\nShe laughed at him. \"Get about your business, sir knight. I spent nearly\ntwo weeks living with these people once. I know dozens of them by name.\nWatch this cat operate, as Abe would say.\"\n\nShe darted to one of the over-turned pirogues which had been dragged up\non the bank from the river, and climbed atop it. She held her hands high\nand began a stream of what was gibberish to Crawford who didn't\nunderstand Wolof, the Senegalese lingua franca. Some elements of the\ncrowd began drifting in her direction. She spoke for a few moments, the\nonly words the surprised Homer Crawford could make out were _El Hassan_.\nAnd she used them often.\n\nShe switched suddenly to Arabic, and he could follow her now. The drift\nof her talk was that word had come through that El Hassan was to make a\ngreat announcement in the near future and that meanwhile all his people\nwere to await his word. But that there was to be a great meeting before\nthe Mosque within the hour.\n\nShe switched again to Songhoi and repeated substantially what she'd said\nbefore. By now she had every woman hanging on her words.\n\nA man on the outskirts of the gathering called out in high irritation,\n\"But what of the storming of the administration buildings? Our leaders\nhave proclaimed the storming of the reactionaries!\"\n\nCrawford, leaning heavily on the pilgrim staff, drifted over to the\nother. \"Quiet, O young one,\" he said. \"I wish to listen to the words of\nthe girl who tells of the teachings of the great El Hassan.\"\n\nThe other turned angrily on him. \"Be silent thyself, old man!\" He raised\na hand as though to cuff the American.\n\nHomer Crawford neatly rapped him on the right shin bone with his\nquarterstaff to the other's intense agony. The women who witnessed the\nbrief spat dissolved in laughter at the plight of the younger man. Homer\nCrawford drifted away again before the heckler recovered.\n\nHe let Isobel handle the bulk of the reverse-rabble rousing. His bit was\nto come later, and as yet he didn't want to reveal himself to the\nthrongs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went from one gathering place of women to another. To the spice\nmarket, to the fish and meat market, to the bathing and laundering\nlocations along the river. And everywhere they found animated groups of\nwomen, Isobel went into her speech.\n\nAt one point, while Homer stood idly in the crowd, feeling its temper\nand the extent to which the girl was dominating them, he felt someone\npress next to him.\n\nA voice said, \"What is the plan of operation, Yank?\"\n\nHomer Crawford's eyebrows went up and he shot a quick glance at the\nother. It was Rex Donaldson of the Commonwealth African Department. The\noperative who worked as the witchman, Dolo Anah. Crawford was glad to\nsee him. This was Donaldson's area of operations, the man must have got\nhere almost as soon as Crawford's team, when he had heard of the\ntrouble.\n\nCrawford said in English, \"They've been gathering for an outbreak of\nviolence, evidently directed at the Reunited Nations projects\nadministration buildings. I've seen a few banners calling for El Hassan\nto come to power, Africa for the Africans, that sort of thing.\"\n\nThe small Bahamian snorted. \"You chaps certainly started something with\nthis El Hassan farce. What are your immediate plans? How can I\nco-operate with you?\"\n\nA teenage boy who had been heckling Isobel, stooped now to pick up some\ndried cow dung. Almost absently, Crawford put his staff between the\nother's legs and tripped him up, when the lad sprawled on his face the\nAmerican rapped him smartly on the head.\n\nCrawford said, \"Thanks a lot, we can use you, especially since you speak\nDogon, I don't think any of my group does. We're going to hold a big\nmeeting in front of the square and give them a long monotonous talk,\nsaying little but sounding as though we're promising a great deal. When\nwe've taken most of the steam out of them, we'll locate the ringleaders\nand have a big indoor meeting. My boys will be spotted throughout the\ngang. They'll nominate me to be spokesman, and nominate each other to be\nmy committee and we'll be sent to find El Hassan and urge him to take\npower. That should keep them quiet for a while. At least long enough for\nheadquarters in Dakar to decide what to do.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens,\" Donaldson said in admiration. \"You Yanks are certainly\ngood at this sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Takes practice,\" Homer Crawford said. \"If you want to help, ferret out\nthe groups who speak Dogon and give them the word.\"\n\nOut of a sidestreet came running Abe Baker at the head of possibly two\nor three hundred arm waving, shouting, stick brandishing Africans. A few\nof them had banners which were being waved in such confusion that nobody\ncould read the words inscribed. Most of them seemed to be younger men,\neven teen-agers.\n\n\"Good Heavens,\" Donaldson said again.\n\nAt first snap opinion, Crawford thought his assistant was being pursued\nand started forward to the hopeless rescue, but then he realized that\nAbe was heading the mob. Waving his staff, the New Yorker was shouting\nslogans, most of which had something to do with \"El Hassan\" but\notherwise were difficult to make out.\n\nThe small mob charged out of the street and through the square, still\nshouting. Abe began to drop back into the ranks, and then to the edge of\nthe charging, gesticulating crowd. Already, though, some of them seemed\nto be slowing up, even stopping and drifting away, puzzlement or\nfrustration on their faces.\n\nThose who were still at excitement's peak, charged up another street at\nthe other side of the square.\n\nIn a few moments, Abe Baker came up to them, breathing hard and wiping\nsweat from his forehead. He grinned wryly. \"Man, those cats are way out.\nThis is really Endsville.\" He looked up at where Isobel was haranguing\nher own crowd, which hadn't been fazed by the men who'd charged through\nthe square going nowhere. \"Look at old Isobel up there. Man, this whole\ntown's like a combination of Hyde Park and Union Square. You oughta hear\nold Jake making with a speech.\"\n\n\"What just happened?\" Homer asked, motioning with his head to where the\nlast elements of the mob Abe'd been leading were disappearing down a\ndead-end street.\n\n\"Ah, nothing,\" Abe said, still watching Isobel and grinning at her.\n\"Those cats were the nucleus of a bunch wanted to start some action.\nBurn a few cars, raid the library, that sort of jazz. So I took over for\na while, led them up one street and down the other. I feel like I just\nbeen star at a track meet.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens,\" Donaldson said still again.\n\n\"They're all scattered around now,\" Abe explained to him. \"Either that\nor their tongues are hanging out to the point they'll have to take five\nto have a beer. They're finished for a while.\"\n\nIsobel finished her little talk and joined them. \"What gives now?\" she\nasked.\n\nRex Donaldson said, \"I'd like to stay around and watch you chaps\noperate. It's fascinating. However, I'd better get over to the park.\nThat's probably where the greater number of the Dogon will be.\" He\ngrumbled sourly, \"I'll roast those blokes with a half dozen bits of\nmagic and send them all back to Sangha. It'll be donkey's years before\nthey ever show face around here again.\" He left them.\n\nHomer Crawford looked after him. \"Good man,\" he said.\n\nAbe had about caught his breath. \"What gives now, man?\" he said. \"I\nought to get back to Jake. He's all alone up near the mosque.\"\n\n\"It's about time all of us got over there,\" Crawford said. He looked at\nIsobel as they walked. \"How does it feel being a sort of reverse agent\nprovocateur?\"\n\nHer forehead was wrinkled, characteristically. \"I suppose it has to be\ndone, but frankly, I'm not too sure just what we are doing. Here we go\nabout pushing these supposed teachings of El Hassan and when we're taken\nup by the people and they actually attempt to accomplish what we taught\nthem, we draw in on the reins.\"\n\n\"Man, you're right,\" Abe said unhappily. He looked at his chief. \"What'd\nyou say, Homer?\"\n\n\"Of course she's right,\" Crawford growled. \"It's just premature, is all.\nThere's no program, no plan of action. If there was one, this thing here\nin Mopti might be the spark that united all North Africa. As it is, we\nhave to put the damper on it until there is a definite program.\" He\nadded sourly, \"I'm just wondering if the Reunited Nations is the\norganization that can come up with one. And, if it isn't, where is there\none?\"\n\nThe mosque loomed up before them. The square before it was jam packed\nwith milling Africans.\n\n\"Great guns,\" Isobel snorted, \"there're more people here than the whole\npopulation of Mopti. Where'd they all come from?\"\n\n\"They've been filtering in from the country,\" Crawford said.\n\n\"Well, we'll filter 'em back,\" Abe promised.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey spotted a ruckus and could see Elmer Allen in the middle of it, his\nquarterstaff flailing.\n\n\"On the double,\" Homer bit out, and he and Abe broke into a trot for the\npoint of conflict. The idea was to get this sort of thing over as\nquickly as possible before it had a chance to spread.\n\nThey arrived too late. Elmer was leaning on his staff, as though needing\nit for support, and explaining mildly to two men who evidently were\nfriends of a third who was stretched out on the ground, dead to the\nworld and with a nasty lump on his shaven head.\n\nHomer came up and said to Elmer, in Songhai, \"What has transpired, O\nHoly One?\" He made a sign of obeisance to the Jamaican.\n\nThe two Africans were taken aback by the term of address. They were\nunprepared to continue further debate, not to speak of physical action,\nagainst a holy man.\n\nElmer said with dignity, \"He spoke against El Hassan, our great leader.\"\n\nFor a moment the two Africans seemed to be willing to deny that, but Abe\nBaker took up the cue and turned to the crowd that was beginning to\ngather. He held his hands out, palms upward questioningly, \"And why\nshould these young men beset a Holy One whose only crime is to love El\nHassan?\"\n\nThe crowd began to murmur and the two hurriedly picked up their fallen\ncompanion and took off with him.\n\nHomer said in English, \"What really happened?\"\n\n\"Oh, this chap was one of the hot heads,\" Elmer explained. \"Wanted some\nimmediate action. I gave it to him.\"\n\nAbe chuckled, \"Holy One, yet.\"\n\nSpotted through the square, holding forth to various gatherings of the\nmob were Jake Armstrong, Kenny Ballalou and Cliff Jackson. Even as Homer\nCrawford sized up the situation and the temper of the throngs of\ntribesmen, Bey entered the square from the far side at the head of two\nor three thousand more, most of whom were already beginning to look\nbored to death from talk, talk, talk.\n\nIsobel came up and looked questioningly at Homer Crawford.\n\nHe said, \"Abe, get the truck and drive it up before the entrance to the\nmosque. We'll speak from that. Isobel can open the hoe down, get the\ncrowd over and then introduce me.\"\n\nAbe left and Crawford said to Isobel, \"Introduce me as Omar ben Crawf,\nthe great friend and assistant of El Hassan. Build it up.\"\n\n\"Right,\" she said.\n\nCrawford said, \"Elmer first round up the boys and get them spotted\nthrough the audience. You're the cheerleaders and also the sergeants at\narms, of course. Nail the hecklers quickly, before they can get\norganized among themselves. In short, the standard deal.\" He thought a\nmoment. \"And see about getting a hall where we can hold a meeting of the\nringleaders, those are the ones we're going to have to cool out.\"\n\n\"Wizard,\" Elmer said and was gone on his mission.\n\nIsobel and Homer stood for a moment, waiting for Abe and the truck.\n\nShe said, \"You seem to have this all down pat.\"\n\n\"It's routine,\" he said absently. \"The brain of a mob is no larger than\nthat of its minimum member. Any disciplined group, almost no matter how\nsmall can model it to order.\"\n\n\"Just in case we don't have the opportunity to get together again, what\nhappens at the hall meeting of ringleaders? What do Jake, Cliff and I\ndo?\"\n\n\"What comes naturally,\" Homer said. \"We'll elect each other to the most\nimportant positions. But everybody else that seems to have anything at\nall on the ball will be elected to some committee or other. Give them\njobs compiling reports to El Hassan or something. Keep them busy. Give\nReunited Nations headquarters in Dakar time to come up with something.\"\n\nShe said worriedly, \"Suppose some of these ringleaders are capable,\naggressive types and won't stand for us getting all the important\npositions?\"\n\nCrawford grunted. \"We're _more_ aggressive and more capable. Let my team\nhandle that. One of the boys will jump up and accuse the guy of being a\nspy and an enemy of El Hassan, and one of the other boys will bear him\nout, and a couple of others will hustle him out of the hall.\" Homer\nyawned. \"It's all routine, Isobel.\"\n\nAbe was driving up the truck.\n\nCrawford said, \"O.K., let's go, gal.\"\n\n\"Roger,\" she said, climbing first into the back of the vehicle and then\nup onto the roof of the cab.\n\nIsobel held her hands high above her head and in the cab Abe bore down\non the horn for a long moment.\n\nIsobel shrilled, \"Hear what the messenger from El Hassan has come to\ntell us! Hear the friend and devoted follower of El Hassan!\"\n\nAt the same time, Jake, Kenny, and Cliff discontinued their own\nharangues and themselves headed for the new speaker.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey stayed for three days and had it well wrapped up in that time. The\ntribesmen, bored when the excitement fell away and it became obvious\nthat there were to be no further riots, and certainly no violence,\ndrifted back to their villages. The city dwellers returned to the\nroutine of daily existence. And the police, who had mysteriously\ndisappeared from the streets at the height of the demonstrations, now\nmagically reappeared and began asserting their authority somewhat\ntruculently.\n\nAt the hall meetings, mighty slogans were drafted and endless committees\nformed. The more articulate, the more educated and able of the\ndemonstrators were marked out for future reference, but for the moment\ngiven meaningless tasks to keep them busy and out of trouble.\n\nOn the fourth day, Homer Crawford received orders to proceed to Dakar,\nleaving the rest of the team behind to keep an eye on the situation.\n\nAbe groaned, \"There's luck for you. Dakar, nearest thing to a good old\nsin city in a thousand miles. And who gets to go? Old sour puss, here.\nGot no more interest in the hot spots--\"\n\nHomer said, \"You can come along, Abe.\"\n\nKenny Ballalou said, \"Orders were only you, Homer.\"\n\nCrawford growled, \"Yes, but I have a suspicion I'm being called on the\ncarpet for one of our recent escapades and I want backing if I need it.\"\nHe added, \"Besides, nothing is going to happen here.\"\n\n\"Crazy man,\" Abe said appreciatively.\n\nJake said, \"We three were planning to head for Dakar today ourselves.\nIsobel, in particular, is exhausted and needs a prolonged rest before\ngoing out among the natives any more. You might as well continue to let\nus supply your transportation.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Homer told him. \"Come on Abe, let's get our things together.\"\n\n\"What do we do while you chaps are gone?\" Elmer Allen said sourly. \"I\nwouldn't mind a period in a city myself.\"\n\n\"Read a book, man,\" Abe told him. \"Improve your mind.\"\n\n\"I've read a book,\" Elmer said glumly. \"Any other ideas?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDakar is a big, bustling, prosperous and modern city shockingly set down\nin the middle of the poverty that is Africa. It should be, by its\nappearance, on the French Riviera, on the California coast, or possibly\nthat of Florida, but it isn't. It's in Senegal, in the area once known\nas French West Africa.\n\nTheir aircraft swept in and landed at the busy airport.\n\nThey were assigned an African Development Project air-cushion car and\ndrove into the city proper.\n\nDakar boasts some of the few skyscrapers in all Africa. The Reunited\nNations occupied one of these in its entirety. Dakar was the center of\nactivities for the whole Western Sahara and down into the Sudan. Across\nthe street from its offices, a street still named Rue des R\u00c3\u00a9sistance in\nspite of the fact that the French were long gone, was the Hotel\nJuan-les-Pins.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCrawford and Abe Baker had radioed ahead and accommodations were ready\nfor them. Their western clothing and other gear had been brought up from\nstorage in the cellar.\n\nAt the desk, the clerk didn't blink at the Tuareg costume the two still\nwore. This was commonplace. He probably wouldn't have blinked had Isobel\narrived in the costume of the Dogon. \"Your suite is ready, Dr.\nCrawford,\" he said.\n\nThe manager came up and shook hands with an old customer and Homer\nCrawford introduced him to Isobel, Jake and Cliff, requesting he do his\nbest for them. He and Abe then made their excuses and headed for the\nparadise of hot water, towels, western drink and the other amenities of\ncivilization.\n\nOn the way up in the elevator, Abe said happily, \"Man, I can just\n_taste_ that bath I'm going to take. Crazy!\"\n\n\"Personally,\" Crawford said, trying to reflect some of the other's\ntypically lighthearted enthusiasm, \"I have in mind a few belts out of a\nbottle of stone-age cognac, then a steak yea big and a flock of French\nfries, followed by vanilla ice cream.\"\n\nAbe's eyes went round. \"Man, you mean we can't get a good dish of cous\ncous in this town?\"\n\n\"Cous cous,\" Crawford said in agony.\n\nAbe made his voice so soulful. \"With a good dollop of rancid camel\nbutter right on top.\"\n\nHomer laughed as they reached their floor and started for the suite.\n\"You make it sound so good, I almost believe you.\" Inside he said,\n\"Dibbers on the first bath. How about phoning down for a bottle of\nNapoleon and some soda and ice? When it comes, just mix me one and bring\nit in, that hand you see emerging from the soap bubbles in that tub,\nwill be mine.\"\n\n\"I hear and obey, O Bwana!\" Abe said in a servile tone.\n\nBy the time they'd cleaned up and had eaten an enormous western style\nmeal in the dining room of the Juan-les-Pins, it was well past the hour\nwhen they could have made contact with their Reunited Nations superiors.\nThey had a couple of cognacs in the bar, then, whistling happily, Abe\nBaker went out on the town.\n\nHomer Crawford looked up Isobel, Jake and Cliff who had, sure enough,\nfound accommodations in the same hotel.\n\nIsobel stepped back in mock surprise when she saw Crawford in western\ngarb. \"Heavens to Betsy,\" she said. \"The man is absolutely extinguished\nin a double-breasted charcoal gray.\"\n\nHe tried a scowl and couldn't manage it. \"The word is _distinguished_,\nnot extinguished,\" he said. He looked down at the suit, critically. \"You\nknow, I feel uncomfortable. I wonder if I'll be able to sit down in a\nchair instead of squatting.\" He looked at her own evening frock. \"Wow,\"\nhe said.\n\nCliff Jackson said menacingly, \"None of that stuff, Crawford. Isobel has\nalready been asked for, let's have no wolfing around.\"\n\nIsobel said tartly, \"Asked for but she didn't answer the summons.\" She\ntook Homer by the arm. \"And I just adore extinguish--oops, I mean\ndistinguished looking men.\"\n\nThey trooped laughingly into the hotel cocktail lounge.\n\nThe time passed pleasantly. Jake and Cliff were good men in a field\nclose to Homer Crawford's heart. Isobel was possibly the most attractive\nwoman he'd ever met. They discussed in detail each other's work and all\nhad stories of wonder to describe.\n\nCrawford wondered vaguely if there was ever going to be a time,\nin this life of his, for a woman and all that one usually connects\nwith womanhood. What was it Elmer Allen had said at the Timbuktu\nmeeting? \"... _most of us will be kept busy the rest of our lives at\nthis._\"\n\nIn his present state of mind, it didn't seem too desirable a prospect.\nBut there was no way out for such as Homer Crawford. What had Cliff\nJackson said at the same meeting? \"_We do what we must do._\" Which, come\nto think of it, didn't jibe too well with Cliff's claim at Mopti to be\nin it solely for the job. Probably the man disguised his basic idealism\nunder a cloak of cynicism; if so, he wouldn't be the first.\n\nThey said their goodnights early. All of them were used to Sahara hours.\nUp at dawn, to bed shortly after sunset; the desert has little fuel to\nwaste on illumination.\n\nIn the suite again, Homer Crawford noted that Abe hadn't returned as\nyet. He snorted deprecation. The younger man would probably be out until\ndawn. Dakar had much to offer in the way of civilization's fleshpots.\n\nHe took up the bottle of cognac and poured himself a healthy shot,\nwishing that he'd remembered to pick up a paperback at the hotel's\nnewsstand before coming to bed.\n\nHe swirled the expensive brandy in the glass and brought it to his nose\nto savor the bouquet.\n\nBut fifteen-year-old brandy from the cognac district of France should\nnot boast a bouquet involving elements of bitter almonds. With an\nautomatic startled gesture, Crawford jerked his face away from the\nglass.\n\nHe scowled down at it for a long moment, then took up the bottle and\nsniffed it. He wondered how a would-be murderer went about getting hold\nof cyanide in Dakar.\n\nHomer Crawford phoned the desk and got the manager. Somebody had been in\nthe suite during his absence. Was there any way of checking?\n\nHe didn't expect satisfaction and didn't receive any. The manager, after\nfinding that nothing seemed to be missing, seemed to think that perhaps\nDr. Crawford had made a mistake. Homer didn't bother to tell him about\nthe poisoned brandy. He hung up, took the bottle into the bathroom and\npoured it away.\n\nIn the way of precautions, he checked the windows to see if there were\nany possibilities of entrance by an intruder, locked the door securely,\nput his handgun beneath his pillow and fell off to sleep. When and if\nAbe returned, he could bang on the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the morning, clad in American business suits and frankly feeling a\ntrifle uncomfortable in them, Homer Crawford and Abraham Baker presented\nthemselves at the offices of the African Development Project, Sahara\nDivision, of the Reunited Nations. Uncharacteristically, there was no\nwaiting in anterooms, no dealing with subordinates. Dr. Crawford and his\nlieutenant were ushered directly to the office of Sven Zetterberg.\n\nUpon their entrance the Swede came to his feet, shook hands abruptly\nwith both of them and sat down again. He scowled at Abe and said to\nHomer in excellent English, \"It was requested that your team remain in\nMopti.\" Then he added, \"Sit down, gentlemen.\"\n\nThey took chairs. Crawford said mildly, \"Mr. Baker is my right-hand man.\nI assume he'd take over the team if anything happened to me.\" He added\ndryly, \"Besides, there were a few things he felt he had to do about\ntown.\"\n\nAbe cleared his throat but remained silent.\n\nZetterberg continued to frown but evidently for a different reason now.\nHe said, \"There have been more complaints about your ... ah ... cavalier\ntactics.\"\n\nHomer looked at him but said nothing.\n\nZetterberg said in irritation, \"It becomes necessary to warn you almost\nevery time you come in contact with this office, Dr. Crawford.\"\n\nHomer said evenly, \"My team and I work in the field Dr. Zetterberg. We\nhave to think on our feet and usually come to decisions in split\nseconds. Sometimes our lives are at stake. We do what we think best\nunder the conditions. At any time your office feels my efforts are\nmisdirected, my resignation is available.\"\n\nThe Swede cleared his throat. \"The Arab Union has made a full complaint\nin the Reunited Nations of a group of our men massacring thirty-five of\ntheir troopers.\"\n\nHomer said, \"They were well into the Ahaggar with a convoy of modern\nweapons, obviously meant for adherents of theirs. Given the opportunity,\nthe Arab Union would take over North Africa.\"\n\n\"This is no reason to butcher thirty-five men.\"\n\n\"We were fired upon first,\" Crawford said.\n\n\"That is not the way they tell it. They claim you ambushed them.\"\n\nAbe put in innocently, \"How would the Arab Union know? We didn't leave\nany survivors.\"\n\nZetterberg glared at him. \"It is not easy, Mr. Baker, for we who do the\npaper work involved in this operation, to account for the activities of\nyou hair-trigger men in the field.\"\n\n\"We appreciate your difficulties,\" Homer said evenly. \"But we can only\ncontinue to do what we think best on being confronted with an\nemergency.\"\n\nThe Swede drummed his fingers on the desk top. \"Perhaps I should remind\nyou that the policy of this project is to encourage amalgamation of the\npeoples of the area. Possibly, the Arab Union will prove to be the best\nforce to accomplish such a union.\"\n\nAbe grunted.\n\nHomer Crawford was shaking his head. \"You don't believe that Dr.\nZetterberg, and I doubt if there are many non-Moslems who do. Mohammed\nsprung out of the deserts and his religion is one based on the\nsurroundings, both physical and socio-economic.\"\n\nZetterberg grumbled, argumentatively, though his voice lacked\nconviction, \"So did its two sister religions, Judaism and Christianity.\"\n\nCrawford waggled a finger negatively. \"Both of them adapted to changing\ntimes, with considerable success. Islam has remained the same and in all\nthe world there is not one example of a highly developed socio-economic\nsystem in a Moslem country. The reason is that in your country, and\nmine, and in the other advanced countries of the West, we pay lip\nservice to our religions, but we don't let them interfere with our day\nby day life. But the Moslem, like the rapidly disappearing\nultra-orthodox Jews, lives his religion every day and by the rules set\ndown by the Prophet fifteen centuries ago. Everything a Moslem does from\nthe moment he gets up in the morning is all mapped out in the Koran.\nWhat fingers of the hand to eat with, what hand to break bread with--and\nso on and so forth. It can get ludicrous. You should see the bathroom of\na wealthy Moslem in some modern city such as Tangier. Mohammed never\ndreamed of such institutions as toilet paper. His followers still obey\nthe rules he set down as an alternative.\"\n\n\"What's your point?\"\n\n\"That North Africa cannot be united under the banner of Islam if she is\ngoing to progress rapidly. If it ever unites, it will be in spite of\nlocal religions--Islam and pagan as well; they hold up the wheels of\nprogress.\"\n\nZetterberg stared at him. The truth of the matter was that he agreed\nwith the American and they both knew it.\n\nHe said, \"This matter of physically assaulting and then arresting the\nchieftain\"--he looked down at a paper on his desk--\"of the Ouled\nTouameur clan of the Chaambra confederation, Abd-el-Kader. From your\nreport, the man was evidently attempting to unify the tribes.\"\n\nCrawford was shaking his head impatiently. \"No. He didn't have\nthe ... dream. He was a raider, a racketeer, not a leader of purposeful\nmen. Perhaps it's true that these people need a hero to act as a symbol\nfor them, but he can't be such as Abd-el-Kader.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right,\" the Swede said grudgingly. \"See here, have you\nheard reports of a group of Cubans, in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan to help\nwith the new sugar refining there, being attacked?\"\n\nThe eyes of both Crawford and Baker narrowed. There'd been talk about\nthis at Timbuktu. \"Only a few rumors,\" Crawford said.\n\nThe Swede drummed his desk with his nervous fingers. \"The rumors are\ncorrect. The whole group was either killed or wounded.\" He said\nsuddenly, \"You had nothing to do with this, I suppose?\"\n\nCrawford held his palms up, in surprise, \"My team has never been within\na thousand miles of Khartoum.\"\n\nZetterberg said, \"See here, we suspect the Cubans might have supported\nSoviet Complex viewpoints.\"\n\nCrawford shrugged, \"I know nothing about them at all.\"\n\nZetterberg said, \"Do you think this might be the work of El Hassan and\nhis followers?\"\n\nAbe started to chuckle something, but Homer shook his head slightly in\nwarning and said, \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"How did that affair in Mopti turn out, these riots in favor of El\nHassan?\"\n\nHomer Crawford shrugged. \"Routine. Must have been as many as ten\nthousand of them at one point. We used standard tactics in gaining\ncontrol and then dispersing them. I'll have a complete written report to\nyou before the day is out.\"\n\nZetterberg said, \"You've heard about this El Hassan before?\"\n\n\"Quite a bit.\"\n\n\"From the rumors that have come into this office, he backs neither East\nnor West in international politics. He also seems to agree with your\nsummation of the Islamic problem. He teaches separation of Church and\nState.\"\n\n\"They're the same thing in Moslem countries,\" Abe muttered.\n\nZetterberg tossed his bombshell out of a clear sky. \"Dr. Crawford,\" he\nsnapped, \"in spite of the warnings we've had to issue to you repeatedly,\nyou are admittedly our best man in the field. We're giving you a new\nassignment. Find this El Hassan and bring him here!\"\n\nZetterberg leaned forward, an expression of somewhat anxious sincerity\nin his whole demeanor.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nAbe Baker choked, and then suddenly laughed.\n\nSven Zetterberg stared at him. \"What's so funny?\"\n\n\"Well, nothing,\" Abe admitted. He looked to Homer Crawford.\n\nCrawford said to the Swede carefully, \"Why?\"\n\nZetterberg said impatiently, \"Isn't it obvious, after the conversation\nwe've had here? Possibly this El Hassan is the man we're looking for.\nPerhaps this is the force that will bind North Africa together. Thus\nfar, all we've heard about him has been rumor. We don't seem to be able\nto find anyone who has seen him, nor is the exact strength of his\nfollowing known. We'd like to confer with him, before he gets any\nlarger.\"\n\nCrawford said carefully, \"It's hard to track down a rumor.\"\n\n\"That's why we give the assignment to our best team in the field,\" the\nSwede told him. \"You've got a roving commission. Find El Hassan and\nbring him here to Dakar.\"\n\nAbe grinned and said, \"Suppose he doesn't want to come?\"\n\n\"Use any methods you find necessary. If you need more manpower, let us\nknow. But we must talk to El Hassan.\"\n\nHomer said, still watching his words, \"Why the urgency?\"\n\nThe Reunited Nations official looked at him for a long moment, as though\ndebating whether to let him in on higher policy. \"Because, frankly, Dr.\nCrawford, the elements which first went together to produce the African\nDevelopment Project, are, shall we say, becoming somewhat unstuck.\"\n\n\"The glue was never too strong,\" Abe muttered.\n\nZetterberg nodded. \"The attempt to find competent, intelligent men to\nwork for the project, who were at the same time altruistic and\nunaffected by personal or national interests, has always been a\ndifficult one. If you don't mind my saying so, we Scandinavians,\nparticularly those not affiliated with NATO come closest to filling the\nbill. We have no designs on Africa. It is unfortunate that we have\npractically no Negro citizens who could do field work.\"\n\n\"Are you suggesting other countries have designs on Africa?\" Homer said.\n\nFor the first time the Swede laughed. A short, choppy laugh. \"Are you\nsuggesting they haven't? What was that convoy of the Arab Union bringing\ninto the Sahara? Guns, with which to forward their cause of taking over\nall North Africa. What were those Cubans doing in Sudan, that someone\nelse felt it necessary to assassinate them? What is the program of the\nSoviet Complex as it applies to this area, and how does it differ from\nthat of the United States? And how do the ultimate programs of the\nBritish Commonwealth and the French Community differ from each other and\nfrom both the United States and Russia?\"\n\n\"That's why we have a Reunited Nations,\" Crawford said calmly.\n\n\"Theoretically, yes. But it is coming apart at the seams. I sometimes\nwonder if an organization composed of a membership each with its own\nselfish needs can ever really unite in an altruistic task. Remember the\nearly days when the Congo was first given her freedom? Supposedly the\nUnited Nations went in to help. Actually, each element in the United\nNations had its own irons in the fire, and usually their desires\ndiffered.\"\n\nThe Swede shrugged hugely. \"I don't know, but I am about convinced, and\nso are a good many other officers of this project, that unless we soon\nfind a competent leader to act as a symbol around which all North\nAfricans can unite, find such a man and back him, that all our work will\ncrumble in this area under pressure from outside. That's why we want El\nHassan.\"\n\nHomer Crawford came to his feet, his face in a scowl. \"I'll let you know\nby tomorrow, if I can take the assignment,\" he said.\n\n\"Why tomorrow?\" the Swede demanded.\n\n\"There are some ramifications I have to consider.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" the Swede said stiffly. He came to his own feet and shook\nhands with them again. \"Oh, there's just one other thing. This\nspontaneous meeting you held in Timbuktu with elements from various\nother organizations. How did it come out?\"\n\nCrawford was wary. \"Very little result, actually.\"\n\nZetterberg chuckled. \"As I expected. However, we would appreciate it,\ndoctor, if you and your team would refrain from such activities in the\nfuture. You are, after all, hired by the Reunited Nations and owe it all\nyour time and allegiance. We have no desire to see you fritter away this\ntime with religious fanatics and other crackpot groups.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Crawford said.\n\nThe other laughed cheerfully. \"I'm sure you do, Dr. Crawford. A word to\nthe wise.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey remained silent on the way back to the hotel.\n\nIn the lobby they ran into Isobel Cunningham.\n\nHomer Crawford looked at her thoughtfully. He said, \"We've got some\nthinking to do and some ideas to bat back and forth. I value your\nopinion and experience, Isobel, could you come up to the suite and sit\nin?\"\n\nShe tilted her head, looked at him from the side of her eyes. \"Something\nbig has happened, hasn't it?\"\n\n\"I suppose so. I don't know. We've got to make some decisions.\"\n\n\"Come on Isobel,\" Abe said. \"You can give us the feminine viewpoint and\nall that jazz.\"\n\nThey started for the elevator and Isobel said to Abe, \"If you'd just be\nconsistent with that pseudo-beatnik chatter of yours, I wouldn't mind.\nBut half the time you talk like an English lit major when you forget to\nput on your act.\"\n\n\"Man,\" Abe said to her, \"maybe I was wrong inviting you to sit in on\nthis bull session. I can see you're in a bad mood.\"\n\nIn the living room of the suite, Isobel took an easy-chair and Abe threw\nhimself full length on his back on a couch. Homer Crawford paced the\nfloor.\n\n\"Well?\" Isobel said.\n\nCrawford said abruptly, \"Somebody tried to poison me last night. Got\ninto this room somehow and put cyanide in a bottle of cognac Abe and I\nwere drinking out of earlier in the evening.\"\n\nIsobel stared at him. Her eyes went from him to Abe and back.\n\"But ... but, why?\"\n\nCrawford ran his hand back over his wiry hair in puzzlement. \"I ... I\ndon't know. That's what's driving me batty. I can't figure out why\nanybody would want to kill me.\"\n\n\"I can,\" Abe said bluntly. \"And that interview we just had with Sven\nZetterberg just bears me out.\"\n\n\"Zetterberg,\" Isobel said, surprised. \"Is he in Africa?\"\n\nCrawford nodded to her question but his eyes were on Abe.\n\nAbe put his hands behind his head and said to the ceiling, \"Zetterberg\njust gave Homer's team the assignment of bringing in El Hassan.\"\n\n\"El Hassan? But you boys told us all in Timbuktu that there was no El\nHassan. You invented him and then the rest of us, more or less\nspontaneously, though unknowingly, took up the falsification and spread\nyour work.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Crawford said, still looking at Abe.\n\n\"But didn't you tell Sven Zetterberg?\" Isobel demanded. \"He's too big a\nman to play jokes upon.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't and I'm not sure I know why.\"\n\n\"I know why,\" Abe said. He sat up suddenly and swung his feet around and\nto the floor.\n\nThe other two watched him, both frowning.\n\nAbe said slowly, \"Homer, you _are_ El Hassan.\"\n\nHis chief scowled at him. \"What is that supposed to mean?\"\n\nThe younger man gestured impatiently. \"Figure it out. Somebody else\nalready has, the somebody who took a shot at you from that mosque. Look,\nput it all together and it makes sense.\n\n\"These North Africans aren't going to make it, not in the short period\nof time that we want them to, unless a leader appears on the scene.\nThese people are just beginning to emerge from tribal society. In the\ntribes, people live by rituals and taboos, by traditions. But at the\nnext step in the evolution of society they follow a Hero--and the\ntraditions are thrown overboard. It's one step up the ladder of cultural\nevolution. Just for the record, the Heroes almost invariably get\nclobbered in the end, since a Hero must be perfect. Once he is found\nwanting in any respect, he's a false prophet, a cheat, and a new,\nperfect and faultless Hero must be found.\n\n\"O.K. At this stage we need a Hero to unite North Africa, but this time\nwe need a real super-Hero. In this modern age, the old style one won't\ndo. We need one with education, and altruism, one with the dream, as you\ncall it. We need a man who has no affiliations, no preferences for\nTuareg, Teda, Chaambra, Dogon, Moor or whatever. He's got to be truly\nneutral. O.K., you're it. You're an American Negro, educated, competent,\nwidely experienced. You're a natural for the job. You speak Arabic,\nFrench, Tamabeq, Songhai and even Swahili.\"\n\nAbe stopped momentarily and twisted his face in a grimace. \"But there's\none other thing that's possibly the most important of all. Homer, you're\na born leader.\"\n\n\"Who _me_?\" Crawford snorted. \"I hate to be put in a position where I\nhave to lead men, make decisions, that sort of thing.\n\n\"That's beside the point. There in Timbuktu you had them in the palm of\nyour hand. All except one or two, like Doc Smythe and that missionary.\nAnd I have an idea even they'd come around. Everybody there felt it.\nThey were in favor of anything you suggested. Isobel?\"\n\nShe nodded, very seriously. \"Yes. You have a personality that goes over,\nHomer. I think it would be a rare person who could conceive of you\ncheating, or misleading. You're so obviously sincere, competent and\nintelligent that it, well, _projects_ itself. I noticed it even more in\nMopti than Timbuktu. You had that city in your palm in a matter of a few\nhours.\"\n\nHomer Crawford shifted his shoulders, uncomfortably.\n\nAbe said, \"You might dislike the job, but it's a job that needs doing.\"\n\nCrawford ran his hand around the back of his neck, uncomfortably. \"You\nthink such a project would get the support of the various teams and\norganizations working North Africa, eh?\"\n\n\"Practically a hundred per cent. And even if some organizations or even\ncountries, with their own row to hoe, tried to buck you, their\nindividual members and teams would come over. Why? Because it makes\nsense.\"\n\nHomer Crawford said worriedly, \"Actually, I've realized this, partially\nsubconsciously, for some time. But I didn't put myself in the role.\nI ... I wish there really was an El Hassan. I'd throw my efforts behind\nhim.\"\n\n\"There will be an El Hassan,\" Abe said definitely. \"And you can be him.\"\n\nCrawford stared at Abe, undecided.\n\nIsobel said, suddenly, \"I think Abe's right, Homer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbe seemed to switch the tempo of his talk. He said, \"There's just one\nthing, Homer. It's a long range question, but it's an important one.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"What're your politics?\"\n\n\"My politics? I haven't any politics here in North Africa.\"\n\n\"I mean back home. I've never discussed politics with you, Homer, partly\nbecause I haven't wanted to reveal my own. But now the question comes\nup. What is your position, ultimately, speaking on a world-wide basis?\"\n\nHomer looked at him quizzically, trying to get at what was behind the\nother's words. \"I don't belong to any political party,\" he said slowly.\n\nAbe said evenly, \"I do, Homer. I'm a Party member.\"\n\nCrawford was beginning to get it. \"If you mean do I ultimately support\nthe program of the Soviet Complex, the answer is definitely no. Whether\nor not it's desirable for Russia or for China, is up to the Russians and\nChinese to decide. But I don't believe it's desirable for such advanced\ncountries as the United States and most of Western Europe. We've got\nlarge problems that need answering, but the commies don't supply the\nanswers so far as I'm concerned.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Abe said. He was far, far different than the laughing, beatnik\njabbering, youngster he had always seemed. \"That's not so good.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Homer demanded. His eyes went to where Isobel sat, her face\nstrained at all this, but he could read nothing in her expression, and\nshe said nothing.\n\nAbe said, \"Because, admittedly, North Africa isn't ready for a communist\nprogram as yet. It's in too primitive a condition. However, it's\nprogressing fast, fantastically fast, and the coming of El Hassan is\ngoing to speed things up still more.\"\n\nAbe said deliberately, \"Possibly twenty years from now the area _will_\nbe ready for a communist program. And at that time we don't want\nsomebody with El Hassan's power and prestige against us. We take the\nlong view, Homer, and it dictates that El Hassan has to be secretly on\nthe Party's side.\"\n\nHomer was nodding. \"I see. So that's why you shot at me in Timbuktu.\"\n\nAbe's eyes went wary. He said, \"I didn't know you knew.\"\n\nCrawford nodded. \"It just came to me. It had to be you. Supposedly, you\nbroke into the mosque from the back at the same moment I came in the\nfront. Actually, you were already inside.\" Homer grunted. \"Besides, it\nwould have been awfully difficult for anyone else to have doped that\nbottle of cognac on me. What I couldn't understand, and still can't, was\nmotive. We've been in the clutch together more than once, Abe.\"\n\n\"That's right, Homer, but there are some things so important that\nfriendship goes by the board. I could see as far back as that meeting\nsomething that hadn't occurred to either you or the others. You were a\nborn El Hassan. I figured it was necessary to get you out of the way and\nput one of our own--perhaps me, even--in your place. No ill feelings,\nHomer. In fact, now I've just given you your chance. You could come in\nwith us--\"\n\nEven as he was speaking, his eyes moved in a way Homer Crawford\nrecognized. He'd seen Abe Baker in action often enough. A gun flicked\nout of an under-the-arm holster, but Crawford moved in anticipation. The\nflat of his hand darted forward, chopped and the hand weapon was on the\nfloor.\n\nAs Isobel screamed, Abe countered the attack. He reached forward in a\njujitsu maneuver, grabbed a coat sleeve and a handful of suit coat. He\ntwisted quickly, threw the other man over one hip and to the floor.\n\nBut Homer Crawford was already expertly rolling with the fall, rolling\nout to get a fresh start.\n\nAbe Baker knew that in the long go, in spite of his somewhat greater\nheft, he wouldn't be able to take his former chief in the other man's\nown field. Now he threw himself on the other, on the floor. Legs and\narms tangled in half realized, quickly defeated holds and maneuvers.\n\nAbe called, \"Quick, Isobel, the gun. Get the gun and cover him.\"\n\nShe shook her head, desperately. \"Oh no. No!\"\n\nAbe bit out, his teeth grinding under the punishment he was taking,\n\"That's an order, _Comrade Cunningham_! Get the gun!\"\n\n\"No. No, I can't!\" She turned and fled the room.\n\nAbe muttered an obscenity, bridged and crabbed out of the desperate\nposition he was in. And now his fingers were but a few inches from the\nweapon. He stretched.\n\nHomer Crawford, heavy veins in his own forehead from his exertions,\npanted, \"Abe, I can't let you get that gun. Call it quits.\"\n\n\"Can't, Homer,\" Abe gritted. His fingers were a few fractions of an inch\nfrom the weapon.\n\nCrawford panted, \"Abe, there's just one thing I can do. A karate blow.\n_I_ can chop your windpipe with the side of my hand. Abe, if I do, only\nimmediate surgery could save your--\"\n\nAbe's fingers closed about the gun and Crawford, calling on his last\nresources, lashed out. He could feel the cartilage collapse, a sound of\nair, for a moment, almost like a shriek filled the room.\n\nThe gun was meaningless now. Homer Crawford, his face agonized, was on\nhis knees beside the other who was threshing on the floor. \"Abe,\" he\ngroaned. \"You made me.\"\n\nAbe Baker's face was quickly going ashen in his impossible quest for\noxygen. For a last second there was a gleam in his eyes and his lips\nmoved. Crawford bent down. He wasn't sure, but he thought that somehow\nthe other found enough air to get out a last, \"Crazy man.\"\n\nWhen it was over, Homer Crawford stood again, and looked down at the\nbody, his face expressionless.\n\nFrom behind him a voice said, \"So I got here too late.\"\n\nCrawford turned. It was Elmer Allen, gun in hand.\n\nHomer Crawford said dully, \"What are you doing here?\"\n\nElmer looked at the body, then back at his chief. \"Bey figured out what\nmust have happened at the mosque there in Timbuktu. We didn't know what\nmight be motivating Abe, but we got here as quick as we could.\"\n\n\"He was a commie,\" Crawford said dully. \"Evidently, the Party decided I\nstood in its way. Where are the others?\"\n\n\"Scouring the town to find you.\"\n\nCrawford said wearily, \"Find the others and bring them here. We've got\nto get rid of poor Abe, there, and then I've got something to tell you.\"\n\n\"Very well, chief,\" Elmer said, holstering his gun. \"Oh, just one thing\nbefore I go. You know that chap Rex Donaldson? Well, we had some\ndiscussion after you left. This'll probably surprise you Homer,\nbut--hold onto your hat, as you Americans say--Donaldson thinks you\nought to _become_ El Hassan. And Bey, Kenny and I agree.\"\n\nCrawford said, \"We'll talk about it later, Elmer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe knocked at her door and a moment later she came. She saw who it was,\nopened for him and returned to the room beyond. She had obviously been\ncrying.\n\nHomer Crawford said, but with no reproach in his voice, \"You should have\nhelped me, to be consistent.\"\n\n\"I knew you'd win.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, once you'd switched sides, you should have attempted to\nhelp me. If you had, maybe Abe would still be alive.\"\n\nShe took a quick agonized breath, and sat down in one of the two chairs,\nher hands clasped tightly in her lap. She said, \"I ... I've known Abe\nsince my early teens.\"\n\nHe said nothing.\n\n\"In college, he was the cell leader. He enlisted me into the Party.\"\n\nCrawford still didn't speak.\n\nShe said defiantly, \"He was an idealist, Homer.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" Crawford said. \"And along with it, he's saved my life, on\nat least three different occasions in the past few years. He was a good\nman.\"\n\nIt was her turn to hold silence.\n\nHomer hit the palm of his left hand with the fist of his right. \"That's\nwhat so many don't realize. They think this is all a kind of cowboys and\nIndians affair. The good guys and the bad guys fighting it out. And, of\ncourse, all the good guys are on our side and their side is composed of\nbad guys. They don't realize that many, even most, of the enemy are\nfighting for an ideal, too--and are willing to die for it, or do things\nsometimes even harder than dying.\"\n\nHe paced the floor for an agonized moment, before adding. \"The fact that\nthe ideal is a false one--or so, at least, is my opinion--is beside the\npoint.\"\n\nHe suddenly dropped it and switched subjects. \"This isn't as much a\nsurprise to me as you possibly think, Isobel. There was only one way\nthat episode in Timbuktu could have taken place. Abe was waiting for me\nto pass that mosque. But I had to pass. I had to be _fingered_ as the\nold gangster expression had it. And you led me into the ambush.\"\n\nHe looked down at her. \"But what changed his mind? Why did he offer,\ntonight, to let me take over the El Hassan leadership?\"\n\nIsobel said, her voice low. \"In Timbuktu, when Abe saw the way things\nwere going, he realized you'd have to be liquidated, otherwise El Hassan\nwould be a leader the Party couldn't control. He tried to eliminate you,\nand then tried again with the cognac. Last night, however, he checked\nwith local party leaders and they decided that he'd acted too\nprecipitately. They suggested you be given the opportunity to line up\nwith the Party.\"\n\n\"And if I didn't?\" Homer said.\n\n\"Then you were to be liquidated.\"\n\n\"So the finger is still on me, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, you'll have to be careful.\"\n\nHe looked full into her face. \"How do you stand now?\"\n\nShe returned his frank look. \"I'm the first follower to dedicate her\nservices to El Hassan.\"\n\n\"So you want to come along?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said simply.\n\n\"And you remember what Abe said? That in the end the Hero invariably\ngets clobbered? Sooner or later, North Africa will outgrow the need for\na Hero to follow and then ... then El Hassan and his closest followers\nhave a good chance of winding up before a firing squad.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that.\"\n\nHomer Crawford ran his hand back over his short hair, wearily. \"O.K.,\nIsobel. Your first instructions are to contact those two friends of\nyours, Jake Armstrong and Cliff Jackson. Try to convert them.\"\n\n\"What are you going to be doing ... El Hassan?\"\n\n\"I'm going over to the Reunited Nations to resign from the African\nDevelopment Project. I have a sneaking suspicion that in the future they\nwill not always be seeing eye to eye with El Hassan. Nor will the other\norganizations currently helping to advance Africa--whilst still at the\nsame time keeping their own irons in the fire. Possibly the commies\nwon't be the only ones in favor of liquidating El Hassan's assets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Black Man's Burden, by Dallas McCord Reynolds\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BLACK MAN'S BURDEN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32390-8.txt or 32390-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/2\/3\/9\/32390\/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http:\/\/www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":794,"split":"train"}
