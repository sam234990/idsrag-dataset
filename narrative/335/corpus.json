The task of carrying an army hundreds of miles across a\nwaterless desert; conveying it up a great river, bristling with\nobstacles; defeating an enormously superior force, unsurpassed in the\nworld for courage; and, finally, killing the leader of the enemy and\ncrushing out the last spark of opposition; was a stupendous one.\n\nAfter the death of Gordon, and the retirement of the British troops,\nthere was no force in existence that could have barred the advance of\nthe fanatical hordes of the Mahdi, had they poured down into Egypt. The\nnative Egyptian army was, as yet, in the earliest stage of\norganization; and could not be relied upon to stand firm against the\nwild rush of the Dervishes. Fortunately, time was given for that\norganization to be completed; and when, at last, the Dervish forces\nmarched north, they were repulsed. Assouan was saved, and Wady Halfa\nbecame the Egyptian outpost.\n\nGradually, preparations were made for taking the offensive. A railway\nwas constructed along the banks of the Nile, and a mixed force of\nBritish and Egyptians drove the enemy beyond Dongola; then, by\nsplendidly organized labour, a railroad was made from Wady Halfa,\nacross the desert, towards the elbow of the great bend from Dongola to\nAbu Hamed. The latter place was captured, by an Egyptian brigade moving\nup from the former place; and from that moment, the movement was\ncarried on with irresistible energy.\n\nThe railway was pushed forward to Abu Hamed; and then southward, past\nBerber, up to the Atbara river. An army of twenty thousand men, under\none of the Khalifa's sons, was attacked in a strong position and\ndefeated with immense loss. Fresh British troops were then brought up;\nand, escorted by gunboats and steamers carrying provisions, the army\nmarched up the Nile, crushed the Khalifa's great host before Omdurman,\nand recovered possession of Khartoum.\n\nThen, the moving spirit of this enterprise, the man whose marvellous\npower of organization had secured its success, was called to other\nwork. Fortunately, he had a worthy successor in Colonel Wingate; who,\nwith a native force, encountered that which the Khalifa had again\ngathered, near El Obeid, the scene of the total destruction of the army\nunder Hicks Pasha; routed it with ease, killing the Khalifa and all his\nprincipal emirs. Thus a land that had been turned into a desert, by the\nterrible tyranny of the Mahdi and his successor, was wrested from\nbarbarism and restored to civilization; and the stain upon British\nhonour, caused by the desertion of Gordon by the British ministry of\nthe day, was wiped out.\n\nIt was a marvellous campaign--marvellous in the perfection of its\norganization, marvellous in the completeness of its success.\n\nG. A. Henty.\n\n\n\nChapter 1: Disinherited.\n\n\n\"Wanted, an active and intelligent young man, for general work, in a\ncommercial house having a branch at Alexandria. It is desirable that he\nshould be able to write a good hand; and, if necessary, to assist in\noffice work. Wages, 2 pounds per week. Personal application to be made\nat Messieurs Partridge and Company, 453 Leadenhall Street.\"\n\nThis advertisement was read by a man of five or six and twenty, in a\nsmall room in the upper story of a house in Lupus Street, Pimlico. He\nwas not the only inmate of the room, for a young woman, apparently not\nmore than eighteen, was sitting there sewing; her work interrupted,\noccasionally, by a short, hacking cough. Her husband, for this was the\nrelation in which he stood to her, put down the paper carelessly, and\nthen got up.\n\n\"I am going out, dear, on my usual search. You know, we have agreed\nthat it is of no use my trying to live by my pen. I get an article\naccepted, occasionally, but it's not enough to provide more than bread\nand cheese. I must look for something else.\"\n\n\"But you must succeed, presently, Gregory.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear; but while the grass grows, the horse starves. At any rate,\nI will try for something else. If I get anything, it won't prevent my\nwriting; and when my genius is recognized, I can drop the other thing,\nand take to literature regularly, again.\n\n\"Well, I won't be away longer than I can help. Anyhow, I will be back\nto our midday banquet. I will bring a couple of rashers of bacon in\nwith me. We have potatoes enough, I think.\"\n\nSo saying, he kissed his wife tenderly, and went out.\n\nGregory Hartley belonged to a good family. He was the second son of the\nHonorable James Hartley, brother of the Marquis of Langdale. He had\nbeen educated at Harrow and Cambridge; and, after leaving the\nuniversity, had gone out to Egypt with a friend of his father's, who\nwas an enthusiast in the exploration of the antiquities of that\ncountry. Gregory had originally intended to stay there a few months, at\nmost, but he was infected by the enthusiasm of his companion, and\nremained in Egypt for two years; when the professor was taken ill and\ndied, and he returned home.\n\nA year later, he fell in love with the governess in a neighbouring\nfamily. His feeling was reciprocated, and they became engaged. His\nfather was furious, when his son told him what had taken place.\n\n\"It is monstrous,\" he said, \"after the education that you have had, and\nthe place that I, if I survive him; or, if not, your brother, will take\nat the death of your uncle; that you should dream of throwing yourself\naway, in this manner. I have looked to your making a good marriage;\nfor, as you know, I am not what may be called a rich man. Your\nbrother's tastes are expensive; and what with his education, and yours,\nand the allowances I have made you both, it is as much as I have been\nable to do to keep up our position. And there are your sisters to be\nprovided for. The idea of your falling in love with this young woman is\nmonstrous.\"\n\n\"Young lady, Father. She is a clergyman's daughter.\"\n\n\"I won't hear of such a thing--I will not hear of it for a moment; and\nif you persist in this mad folly, I tell you, fairly, that from this\nmoment I shall have nothing more to say to you! You have to choose\nbetween me, and this penniless beggar.\"\n\n\"I am sorry you put it in that way, sir. My choice is made. I am\nengaged to this young lady, and shall certainly marry her. I trust\nthat, when your present anger has subsided, you will recognize that my\nhonour was involved in the matter; and that even if I wished it, I\ncould not, without showing myself to be a downright cad, draw back.\"\n\nAnd so, Gregory Hartley married the girl of his choice. She had, for\nsome time, refused to allow him to sacrifice himself; but when she\nfound that he was as determined as his father, and absolutely refused\nto release her from the engagement, she had given way; and had, after a\nquiet marriage, accompanied him to London.\n\nThere he had endeavoured to get literary work, but had found it much\nharder than he had expected. The market was overcrowded, and they had\nmoved from comfortable lodgings into small rooms; and so, step by step,\nhad come to the attic in Lupus Street. He was doing a little better\nnow, and had hopes that, ere long, he would begin to make his way\nsteadily up.\n\nBut the anxiety had told on his wife. Never very strong, she had\ndeveloped a short, hard cough; and he had drawn upon his scanty\nreserves, to consult a specialist.\n\n\"There is undoubtedly lung trouble,\" the latter said. \"If you can\nmanage it, I should say that she ought certainly to be taken to a warm\nclimate. The damage is not extensive, as yet; and it is probable that,\nunder favourable circumstances, she might shake it off; but I fear\nthat, if she continues to live in London, her chances are not great.\"\n\nThis, Gregory felt, was almost equivalent to a death sentence; and he\nhad begun to consult the advertisements in the papers, for some post\nabroad. He had, unknown to her, applied for several situations, but\nwithout success.\n\nWhen he first read the advertisement that morning, he had hardly\nthought of applying for the situation. His pride revolted at the idea\nof becoming a mere messenger; but his wife's cough had decided him.\nWhat did it matter, so that he could save her life?\n\n\"I may not get it,\" he said to himself, as he went out; \"but my\nknowledge of Arabic, and the native dialect, is all in my favour. And\nat least, in a year or two, she may have thoroughly shaken off the\ncough, and that is everything.\n\n\"At any rate, I have a better chance of getting this than I had of the\nother places that I applied for. There can hardly be a rush of\napplicants. When I am out there, I may hear of something better.\n\n\"However, I will take another name. Fortunately I have a second one,\nwhich will do very well. Hilliard will do as well as Hartley; and as I\nnever write it in full as my signature, no one would recognize it as my\nname. There is nothing to be ashamed of, in accepting such a post.\n\n\"As for the marquis, as he has never been friendly with us, it does not\nmatter. He is, I have heard, a very tough sort of man; and my father is\nnot likely to survive him. But I do not think it would be fair to\nGeoffrey, when he comes into his peerage, that anyone should be able to\nsay that he has a brother who is porter, in a mercantile house at\nAlexandria. We have never got on very well together. The fact that he\nwas heir to a title spoilt him. I think he would have been a very good\nfellow, if it hadn't been for that.\"\n\nOn arriving at the office in Leadenhall Street, he was, on saying he\nwished to speak to Mr. Partridge, at once shown in. A good many of his\npersonal belongings had been long since pledged; but he had retained\none or two suits, so that he could make as good an appearance as\npossible, when he went out. The clerk had merely said, \"A gentleman\nwishes to speak to you, sir,\" and the merchant looked up enquiringly at\nhim, as he entered.\n\n\"I have come to see you, sir, with reference to that advertisement, for\na man at your establishment at Alexandria.\"\n\nA look of surprise came over the merchant's face, and he said:\n\n\"Have you called on your own account?\"\n\n\"Yes; I am anxious to go abroad, for the sake of my wife's health, and\nI am not particular as to what I do, so that I can take her to a warm\nclimate. I may say that I have been two years in Egypt, and speak\nArabic and Koptic fluently. I am strong and active, and am ready to\nmake myself useful, in any way.\"\n\nMr. Partridge did not answer, for a minute. Certainly this applicant\nwas not at all the sort of man he had expected to apply for the place,\nin answer to his advertisement. That he was evidently a gentleman was\nfar from an advantage, but the fact that he could speak the languages\nwould add much to his value.\n\n\"Can you give me references?\" he said, at last.\n\n\"I cannot, sir. I should not like to apply to any of my friends, in\nsuch a matter. I must ask you to take me on trust. Frankly, I have\nquarrelled with my family, and have to strike out for myself. Were it\nnot for my wife's health, I could earn my living; but I am told it is\nessential that she should go to a warm climate, and as I see no other\nway of accomplishing this, I have applied for this situation, hoping\nthat my knowledge of the language, and my readiness to perform whatever\nduties I may be required to do, might induce you to give me a trial.\"\n\n\"And you would, if necessary--say, in the case of illness of one of my\nclerks--be ready to help in the office?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\n\"Will you call again, in half an hour? I will give you an answer,\nthen.\"\n\nBy the time Gregory returned, the merchant's mind was made up. He had\ncome to the conclusion that the story he had heard was a true one. The\nway it had been told was convincing. The man was undoubtedly a\ngentleman. There was no mistake in his manner and talk. He had\nquarrelled with his family, probably over his marriage; and, as so many\nhad done, found it difficult to keep his head above water. His wife had\nbeen ordered to a warm climate, and he was ready to do anything that\nwould enable him to keep her there.\n\nIt would assuredly be a great advantage to have one who could act, in\nan emergency, as a clerk; of course, his knowledge of language would\ngreatly add to his utility. It certainly was not business to take a man\nwithout a reference, but the advantages more than counterbalanced the\ndisadvantages. It was not likely that he would stay with him long; but\nat any rate, the fact that he was taking his wife with him would ensure\nhis staying, until he saw something a great deal better elsewhere.\n\nWhen Gregory returned, therefore, he said:\n\n\"I have been thinking this matter over. What is your name?\"\n\n\"Gregory Hilliard, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, I have been thinking it over, and I have decided to engage you.\nI quite believe the story that you have told me, and your appearance\nfully carries it out. You may consider the matter settled. I am willing\nto pay for a second-class passage for your wife, as well as yourself;\nand will give such instructions, to my agents there, as will render\nyour position as easy for you as possible. In the natural course of\nthings, your duties would have included the sweeping out of the\noffices, and work of that description; but I will instruct him to\nengage a native to do this, under your supervision. You will be in\ncharge of the warehouse, under the chief storekeeper; and, as you say,\nyou will, in case of pressure of work in the office, take a desk there.\n\n\"In consideration of your knowledge of the language, which will render\nyou, at once, more useful than a green hand would be, I shall add ten\nshillings a week to the wages named in the advertisement, which will\nenable you to obtain comfortable lodgings.\"\n\n\"I am heartily obliged to you, sir,\" Gregory said, \"and will do my best\nto show that your confidence in me has not been misplaced. When do you\nwish me to sail? I shall only require a few hours to make my\npreparations.\"\n\n\"Then in that case I will take a passage, for you and your wife, in the\nP. and O. that sails, next Thursday, from Southampton. I may say that it\nis our custom to allow fifteen pounds, for outfit. If you will call\nagain in half an hour, I will hand you the ticket and a cheque for that\namount; and you can call, the day before you go, for a letter to our\nagents there.\"\n\nGregory ascended the stairs to his lodging with a far more elastic step\nthan usual. His wife saw at once, as he entered, that he had good news\nof some sort.\n\n\"What is it, Gregory?\"\n\n\"Thank God, darling, that I have good news to give you, at last! I have\nobtained a situation, at about a hundred and thirty pounds a year, in\nAlexandria.\"\n\n\"Alexandria?\" she repeated, in surprise.\n\n\"Yes. It is the place of all others that I wanted to go to. You see, I\nunderstand the language. That is one thing; and what is of infinitely\nmore consequence, it is a place that will suit your health; and you\nwill, I hope, very soon get rid of that nasty cough. I did not tell you\nat the time, but the doctor I took you to said that this London air did\nnot suit you, but that a warm climate would soon set you up again.\"\n\n\"You are going out there for my sake, Gregory! As if I hadn't brought\ntrouble enough on you, already!\"\n\n\"I would bear a good deal more trouble for your sake, dear. You need\nnot worry about that.\"\n\n\"And what are you going to do?\" she asked.\n\n\"I am going to be a sort of useful man--extra clerk, assistant\nstorekeeper, et cetera, et cetera. I like Egypt very much. It will suit\nme to a T. At any rate, it will be a vast improvement upon this.\n\n\"Talking of that, I have forgotten the rashers. I will go and get them,\nat once. We sha'n't have to depend upon them as our main staple, in\nfuture; for fruit is dirt cheap, out there, and one does not want much\nmeat. We shall be able to live like princes, on two pounds ten a week;\nand besides, this appointment may lead to something better, and we may\nconsider that there is a future before us.\n\n\"We are to sail on Thursday. Look! Here are fifteen golden sovereigns.\nThat is for my outfit, and we can begin with luxuries, at once. We\nshall not want much outfit: half a dozen suits of white drill for\nmyself, and some gowns for you.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Gregory! I sha'n't want anything. You would not let me sell\nany of my dresses, and I have half a dozen light ones. I shall not want\na penny spent on me.\"\n\n\"Very well; then I will begin to be extravagant, at once. In the first\nplace, I will go down to that confectioner's, round the corner; and we\nwill celebrate my appointment with a cold chicken, and a bottle of\nport. I shall be back in five minutes.\"\n\n\"Will it be very hot, Gregory?\" she asked, as they ate their meal. \"Not\nthat I am afraid of heat, you know. I always like summer.\"\n\n\"No. At any rate, not at present. We are going out at the best time of\nthe year, and it will be a comfort, indeed, to change these November\nfogs for the sunshine of Egypt. You will have four or five months to\nget strong again, before it begins to be hot. Even in summer, there are\ncool breezes morning and evening; and of course, no one thinks of going\nout in the middle of the day. I feel as happy as a schoolboy, at the\nthought of getting out of this den and this miserable climate, and of\nbasking in the sunshine. We have had a bad beginning, dear, but we have\nbetter days before us.\"\n\n\"Thank God, Gregory! I have not cared about myself. But it has been a\ntrial, when your manuscripts have come back, to see you sitting here\nslaving away; and to know that it is I who have brought you to this.\"\n\n\"I brought myself to it, you obstinate girl! I have pleased myself,\nhaven't I? If a man chooses a path for himself, he must not grumble\nbecause he finds it rather rougher than he expected. I have never, for\na single moment, regretted what I have done; at any rate, as far as I,\nmyself, am concerned.\"\n\n\"Nor I, for my own sake, dear. The life of a governess is not so\ncheerful as to cause one regret, at leaving it.\"\n\nAnd so, Gregory Hartley and his wife went out to Alexandria, and\nestablished themselves in three bright rooms, in the upper part of a\nhouse that commanded a view of the port, and the sea beyond it. The\noutlay required for furniture was small, indeed: some matting for the\nfloors, a few cushions for the divans which ran round the rooms, a bed,\na few simple cooking utensils, and a small stock of crockery sufficed.\n\nMr. Ferguson, the manager of the branch, had at first read the letter\nthat Gregory had brought him with some doubt in his mind, as to the\nwisdom of his principal, in sending out a man who was evidently a\ngentleman. This feeling, however, soon wore away; and he found him\nperfectly ready to undertake any work to which he was set.\n\nThere was, indeed, nothing absolutely unpleasant about this. He was at\nthe office early, and saw that the native swept and dusted the offices.\nThe rest of the day he was either in the warehouse, or carried\nmessages, and generally did such odd jobs as were required. A fortnight\nafter his arrival, one of the clerks was kept away by a sharp attack of\nfever; and as work was pressing, the agent asked Gregory to take his\nplace.\n\n\"I will do my best, sir, but I know nothing of mercantile accounts.\"\n\n\"The work will be in no way difficult. Mr. Hardman will take Mr.\nParrot's ledgers; and, as you will only have to copy the storekeeper's\nissues into the books, five minutes will show you the form in which\nthey are entered.\"\n\nGregory gave such satisfaction that he was afterwards employed at\noffice work, whenever there was any pressure.\n\nA year and a half passed comfortably. At the end of twelve months, his\npay was raised another ten shillings a week.\n\nHe had, before leaving England, signed a contract to remain with the\nfirm for two years. He regretted having to do this, as it prevented his\naccepting any better position, should an opening occur; but he\nrecognized that the condition was a fair one, after the firm paying for\nhis outfit and for two passages. At the end of eighteen months, Gregory\nbegan to look about for something better.\n\n\"I don't mind my work a bit,\" he said to his wife, \"but, if only for\nthe sake of the boy\" (a son had been born, a few months after their\narrival), \"I must try to raise myself in the scale, a bit. I have\nnothing to complain about at the office; far from it. From what the\nmanager said to me the other day, if a vacancy occurred in the office,\nI should have the offer of the berth. Of course, it would be a step;\nfor I know, from the books, that Hardman gets two hundred a year, which\nis forty more than I do.\"\n\n\"I should like you to get something else, Gregory. It troubles me, to\nthink that half your time is spent packing up goods in the warehouse,\nand work of that sort; and even if we got less I would much rather,\neven if we had to stint ourselves, that your work was more suitable to\nyour past; and such that you could associate again with gentlemen, on\neven terms.\"\n\n\"That does not trouble me, dear, except that I wish you had some\nsociety among ladies. However, both for your sake and the boy's, and I\nown I should like it myself, I will certainly keep on the lookout for\nsome better position. I have often regretted, now, that I did not go in\nfor a commission in the army. I did want to, but my father would not\nhear of it. By this time, with luck, I might have got my company; and\nthough the pay would not have been more than I get here, it would, with\nquarters and so on, have been as much, and we should be in a very\ndifferent social position.\n\n\"However, it is of no use talking about that now; and indeed, it is\ndifficult to make plans at all. Things are in such an unsettled\ncondition, here, that there is no saying what will happen.\n\n\"You see, Arabi and the military party are practically masters here.\nTewfik has been obliged to make concession after concession to them, to\ndismiss ministers at their orders, and to submit to a series of\nhumiliations. At any moment, Arabi could dethrone him, as he has the\nwhole army at his back, and certainly the larger portion of the\npopulation. The revolution could be completed without trouble or\nbloodshed; but you see, it is complicated by the fact that Tewfik has\nthe support of the English and French governments; and there can be\nlittle doubt that the populace regard the movement as a national one,\nand directed as much against foreign control and interference as\nagainst Tewfik, against whom they have no ground of complaint,\nwhatever. On the part of the army and its generals, the trouble has\narisen solely on account of the favouritism shown to Circassian\nofficers.\n\n\"But once a revolution has commenced, it is certain to widen out. The\npeasantry are, everywhere, fanatically hostile to foreigners. Attacks\nhave been made upon these in various country districts; and, should\nArabi be triumphant, the position of Christians will become very\nprecarious. Matters are evidently seen in that light in England; for I\nheard today, at the office, that the British and French squadrons are\nexpected here, in a day or two.\n\n\"If there should be a row, our position here will be very unpleasant.\nBut I should hardly think that Arabi would venture to try his strength\nagainst that of the fleets, and I fancy that trouble will, in the first\nplace, begin in Cairo; both as being the capital of the country, and\nbeyond the reach of armed interference by the Powers. Arabi's natural\ncourse would be to consolidate his power throughout the whole of Egypt,\nleaving Alexandria severely alone, until he had obtained absolute\nauthority elsewhere.\n\n\"Anyhow, it will be a satisfaction to have the fleet up; as, at the\nfirst rumour of an outbreak, I can get you and baby on board one of the\nships lying in harbour. As a simple measure of precaution, I would\nsuggest that you should go out with me, this evening, and buy one of\nthe costumes worn by the native women. It is only a long blue robe,\nenveloping you from head to foot; and one of those hideous white cotton\nveils, falling from below the eyes. I will get a bottle of iodine, and\nyou will then only have to darken your forehead and eyelids, and you\ncould pass, unsuspected, through any crowd.\"\n\n\"But what are you going to do, Gregory?\"\n\n\"I will get a native dress, too; but you must remember that though, if\npossible, I will come to you, I may not be able to do so; and in case\nyou hear of any tumult going on, you must take Baby, and go down at\nonce to the port. You know enough of the language, now, to be able to\ntell a boatman to take you off to one of the steamers in the port. As\nsoon as I get away I shall go round the port, and shall find you\nwithout difficulty. Still, I do not anticipate any trouble arising\nwithout our having sufficient warning to allow me to come and see you\nsettled on board ship; and I can then keep on in the office until it\ncloses, when I can join you again.\n\n\"Of course, all this is very remote, and I trust that the occasion will\nnever arise. Still, there is no doubt that the situation is critical,\nand there is no harm in making our preparations for the worst.\n\n\"At any rate, dear, I beg that you will not go out alone, till matters\nhave settled down. We will do the shopping together, when I come back\nfrom the office.\n\n\"There is one thing that I have reason to be grateful for. Even if the\nworst comes to the worst, and all Christians have to leave the country,\nthe object for which I came out here has been attained. I have not\nheard you cough, for months; we have laid by fifty pounds; and I have\nwritten some forty stories, long and short, and if we go back I have a\nfair hope of making my way, for I am sure that I write better than I\nused to do; and as a good many of the stories are laid in Egypt, the\nlocal colouring will give them a distinctive character, and they are\nmore likely to be accepted than those I wrote before. Editors of\nmagazines like a succession of tales of that kind.\n\n\"For the present, there is no doubt that the arrival of the fleet will\nrender our position here more comfortable than it is, at present. The\nmere mob of the town would hesitate to attack Europeans, when they know\nthat three or four thousand sailors could land in half an hour. But on\nthe other hand, Arabi and his generals might see that Alexandria was,\nafter all, the most important position, and that it was here foreign\ninterference must be arrested.\n\n\"I should not be surprised if, on the arrival of the ships, Tewfik,\nArabi, and all the leaders of the movement come here at once. Tewfik\nwill come to get the support of the fleet. Arabi will come to oppose a\nlanding of troops. The war in the beginning of the century was decided\nat Alexandria, and it may be so, again. If I were sure that you would\ncome to no harm, and I think the chances of that are very small, I own\nthat all this would be immensely interesting, and a break to the\nmonotony of one's life here.\n\n\"One thing is fairly certain. If there is anything like a regular row,\nall commercial work will come to an end until matters are settled; in\nwhich case, even if the offices are not altogether closed, and the\nwhole staff recalled to England, they would be glad enough to allow me\nto leave, instead of keeping me to the two years' agreement that I\nsigned, before starting.\"\n\n\"I should hardly think that there would be a tumult here, Gregory. The\nnatives all seem very gentle and peaceable, and the army is composed of\nthe same sort of men.\"\n\n\"They have been kept down for centuries, Annie; but there is a deep,\nfanatical feeling in every Mussulman's nature; and, at any rate, the\ngreat proportion of the officers of the army are Mussulmans. As for the\nKopts, there would be no danger of trouble from them; but the cry of\n'death to the Christians' would excite every Mahomedan in the land,\nalmost to madness.\n\n\"Unfortunately, too, there is a general belief, whether truly founded\nor not, that although the French representative here is apparently\nacting in concert with ours, he and all the French officials are\nsecretly encouraging Arabi, and will take no active steps, whatever. In\nthat case, it is doubtful whether England would act alone. The jealousy\nbetween the two peoples here is intense. For years, the French have\nbeen thwarting us at every turn; and they may very well think that,\nhowever matters might finally go, our interference would make us so\nunpopular, in Egypt, that their influence would become completely\nparamount.\n\n\"Supremacy in Egypt has always been the dream of the French. Had it not\nbeen for our command of the sea, they would have obtained possession of\nthe country in Napoleon's time. Their intrigues here have, for years,\nbeen incessant. Their newspapers in Egypt have continually maligned us,\nand they believe that the time has come when they will be the real, if\nnot the nominal, rulers of Egypt. The making of the Suez Canal was\nquite as much a political as a commercial move, and it has certainly\nadded largely to their influence here; though, in this respect, a check\nwas given to them by the purchase of the Khedive's shares in the canal\nby Lord Beaconsfield; a stroke which, however, greatly increased the\nenmity of the French here, and heightened their efforts to excite the\nanimosity of the people against us.\n\n\"Well, I hope that whatever comes of all this, the question as to whose\ninfluence is to be paramount in Egypt will be finally settled. Even\nFrench domination would be better than the constant intrigues and\ntrouble, that keep the land in a state of agitation. However, I fancy\nthat it will be the other way, if an English fleet comes here and there\nis trouble. I don't think we shall back down; and if we begin in\nearnest, we are sure to win in the long run. France must see that, and\nif she refuses to act, at the last moment, it can only be because Arabi\nhas it in his power to produce documents showing that he was, all\nalong, acting in accordance with her secret advice.\"\n\nA week later, on the 20th of May, the squadrons of England and France\nanchored off Alexandria. The British fleet consisted of eight ironclads\nand five gunboats, carrying three thousand five hundred and thirty-nine\nmen and one hundred and two guns, commanded by Sir Frederick Seymour.\nTwo days before the approach of the fleet was known at Cairo, the\nFrench and English consuls proposed that the Khedive should issue a\ndecree, declaring a general amnesty, and that the president of the\ncouncil, the minister of war, and the three military pashas should quit\nthe country for a year. This request was complied with.\n\nThe ministry resigned, in a body, on the day the fleet arrived; on the\nground that the Khedive acquiesced in foreign interference. A great\nmeeting was held of the chief personages of state, and the officers and\nthe representatives of the army at once told the Khedive that they\nrefused to obey his orders, and only recognized the authority of the\nPorte.\n\nAt Alexandria all trade ceased at once, when it became known that the\ntroops were busy strengthening the forts, mounting cannon, and\npreparing for a resistance. That this was done by the orders of Arabi,\nwho was now practically dictator, there could be no question. The\nnative population became more and more excited, being firmly of belief\nthat no vessels could resist the fire of the heavy guns; and that any\nattempt on the part of the men-of-war to reduce the place would end in\ntheir being sunk, as soon as fighting began.\n\nThe office and stores were still kept open, but Gregory's duties were\nalmost nominal; and he and Mr. Parrot, who was also married, were told\nby the manager that they could spend the greater portion of their time\nat their homes. Part of Gregory's duties consisted in going off to\nvessels that came into the port with goods for the firm, and seeing to\ntheir being brought on shore; and he had no difficulty in making\narrangements, with the captain of one of these ships, for his wife and\nchild to go on board at once, should there be any trouble in the town.\n\n\"If you hear any sounds of tumult, Annie, you must disguise yourself at\nonce, and go down to the wharf. I have arranged with our boatman,\nAllen, whom you know well, as we have often gone out with him for a\nsail in the evening, that if he hears of an outbreak, he shall bring\nthe boat to the steps at the end of this street, and take you off to\nthe Simoon. Of course, I shall come if I can, but our house is one of\nthose which have been marked off as being most suitable for defence.\nThe men from half a dozen other establishments are to gather there and,\nas belonging to the house, I must aid in the defence. Of course, if I\nget sufficient warning, I shall slip on my disguise, and hurry here,\nand see you down to the boat; and then make my way back to our place.\nBut do not wait for me. If I come here and find that you have gone, I\nshall know that you have taken the alarm in time, and shall return at\nonce to the office.\n\n\"Of course, if the outbreak commences near here, and you find that your\nway down to the water is blocked, you will simply put on your disguise,\nstain your face, and wait till I come to you, or till you see that the\nway to the water is clear. Do not attempt to go out into a mob. There\nare not likely to be any women among them. However, I do not anticipate\na serious riot. They may attack Europeans in the street, but with some\nfourteen or fifteen men-of-war in the port, they are not likely to make\nany organized assault. Arabi's agents will hardly precipitate matters\nin that way. Hard as they may work, it will take a month to get the\ndefences into proper order, and any rising will be merely a spasmodic\noutbreak of fanaticism. I don't think the danger is likely to be\npressing until, finding that all remonstrances are vain, the admiral\nbegins to bombard the port.\"\n\n\"I will do exactly as you tell me, Gregory. If I were alone, I could\nnot bring myself to leave without you, but I must think of the child.\"\n\n\"Quite so, dear. That is the first consideration. Certainly, if it\ncomes to a fight, I should be much more comfortable with the knowledge\nthat you and Baby were in safety.\"\n\nThe Egyptian soldiers were quartered, for the most part, outside the\ntown; and for some days there was danger that they would enter, and\nattack the European inhabitants; but Arabi's orders were strict that,\nuntil he gave the command, they were to remain quiet.\n\nThe British admiral sent messages to Tewfik, insisting that the work\nupon the fortifications should cease, and the latter again issued\norders to that effect, but these were wholly disobeyed. He had, indeed,\nno shadow of authority remaining; and the work continued, night and\nday. It was, however, as much as possible concealed from observation;\nbut, search lights being suddenly turned upon the forts, at night,\nshowed them to be swarming with men.\n\nThings went on with comparative quiet till the 10th of June, although\nthe attitude of the natives was so threatening that no Europeans left\ntheir houses, except on urgent business. On that day, a sudden uproar\nwas heard. Pistols were fired, and the merchants closed their stores\nand barricaded their doors.\n\nGregory was in the harbour at the time and, jumping into his boat,\nrowed to the stairs and hurried home. He found that his wife had\nalready disguised herself, and was in readiness to leave.\n\nThe street was full of excited people. He slipped on his own disguise,\ndarkened his face, and then, seizing a moment when the crowd had rushed\nup the street at the sound of firearms at the other end, hurried down\nto the boat, and rowed off to the Simoon.\n\n\"I must return now, dear,\" he said. \"I can get in at the back gate--I\nhave the key, as the stores are brought in through that way. I do not\nthink that you need feel any uneasiness. The row is evidently still\ngoing on, but only a few guns are being fired now. Certainly the\nrascals cannot be attacking the stores, or you would hear a steady\nmusketry fire. By the sound, the riot is principally in the foreign\nquarter, where the Maltese, Greeks, and Italians congregate. No doubt\nthe police will soon put it down.\"\n\nThe police, however, made no attempt to do so, and permitted the work\nof massacre to take place under their eyes. Nearly two hundred\nEuropeans were killed. The majority of these dwelt in the foreign\nquarter, but several merchants and others were set upon, while making\ntheir way to their offices, and some seamen from the fleet were also\namong the victims. The British consul was dragged out of his carriage,\nand severely injured. The consulate was attacked, and several Frenchmen\nwere killed in the streets.\n\nThe Khedive hurried from Cairo, on hearing the news. Arabi was now\nsending some of his best regiments to Alexandria, while pretending to\nbe preparing for a raid upon the Suez Canal. He was receiving the\nassistance of Dervish Pasha, the Sultan's representative; and had been\nrecognized by the Sultan, who conferred upon him the highest order of\nMedjidie.\n\nIn the meantime a conference had been held by the Powers, and it was\ndecided that the Sultan should be entrusted with the work of putting\ndown the insurrection, he being nominally lord paramount of Egypt. But\nconditions were laid down, as to his army leaving the country\nafterwards.\n\nThe Sultan sent an evasive reply. The Khedive was too overwhelmed at\nthe situation to take any decisive course. France hesitated, and\nEngland determined that, with or without allies, she would take the\nmatter in hand.\n\n\n\nChapter 2: The Rising In Alexandria.\n\n\nThe harbour was full of merchant ships, as there were, at present, no\nmeans of getting their cargoes unloaded. The native boatmen had, for\nthe most part, struck work; and had they been willing to man their\nboats, they must have remained idle as, in view of the situation, the\nmerchants felt that their goods were much safer on board ship than they\nwould be in their magazines. It was settled, therefore that, for the\npresent, Annie and the child should remain on board the Simoon, while\nGregory should take up his residence at the office.\n\nThe fleet in the harbour was now an imposing one. Not only were the\nEnglish and French squadrons there, but some Italian ships of war had\narrived, and a United States cruiser; and on the 7th of July, Sir\nBeauchamp Seymour sent in a decisive message, that he should commence a\nbombardment of the fort unless the strengthening of the fortifications\nwas, at once, abandoned. No heed was taken of the intimation and, three\ndays later, he sent an ultimatum demanding the cessation of work, and\nthe immediate surrender of the forts nearest to the entrance to the\nharbour; stating that, if these terms were not complied with in\ntwenty-four hours, the bombardment would commence.\n\nAlready the greater part of the European inhabitants had left the town,\nand taken up their quarters in the merchant ships that had been engaged\nfor the purpose. A few, however, of the bankers and merchants\ndetermined to remain. These gathered in the bank, and in Mr. Ferguson's\nhouse, to which the most valuable goods in other establishments were\nremoved. They had an ample supply of firearms, and believed that they\ncould hold out for a considerable time. They were convinced that the\nEgyptian troops would not, for an hour, resist the fire that would be\nopened upon them, but would speedily evacuate the town; and that,\ntherefore, there would only be the mob to be encountered, and this but\nfor a short time, as the sailors would land as soon as the Egyptian\ntroops fled.\n\nThe Egyptians, on the other hand, believed absolutely in their ability\nto destroy the fleet.\n\nBoth parties were wrong. The Europeans greatly undervalued the fighting\npowers of the Egyptians, animated as they were by confidence in the\nstrength of the defences, by their number, and by their fanaticism;\nwhile the Egyptians similarly undervalued the tremendous power of our\nships.\n\nThat evening, and the next morning, the port presented an animated\nappearance. Boats were putting off with those inhabitants who had\nwaited on, hoping that the Egyptians would at the last moment give in.\nMany of the merchantmen had already cleared out. Others were getting up\nsail. Smoke was rising from the funnels of all the men of war.\n\nAn express boat had brought, from France, orders that the French fleet\nwere to take no part in the proceedings, but were to proceed at once to\nPort Said. This order excited the bitterest feeling of anger and\nhumiliation among the French officers and sailors, who had relied\nconfidently in taking their part in the bombardment; and silently their\nships, one by one, left the port. The Italian and American vessels\nremained for a time; and as the British ships followed, in stately\norder, their crews manned the rigging and vociferously cheered our\nsailors, who replied as heartily.\n\nAll, save the British men of war, took up their stations well out at\nsea, in a direction where they would be out of the fire of the Egyptian\nbatteries. It was not until nine o'clock in the evening that the two\nlast British ships, the Invincible and Monarch, steamed out of port. At\nhalf-past four in the morning the ships got under weigh again, and\nmoved to the positions marked out for them.\n\nFort Mex, and the batteries on the sand hills were faced by the\nPenelope, the Monarch, and the Invincible; the Alexandra, the Superb,\nand the Sultan faced the harbour forts, Ada, Pharos, and Ras-el-Teen;\nthe Temeraire and Inflexible prepared to aid the Invincible in her\nattack on Fort Mex, or to support the three battleships engaged off the\nport, as might be required; and the five gunboats moved away towards\nFort Marabout, which lay some distance to the west of the town.\n\nAt seven o'clock, the Alexandra began the engagement by firing a single\ngun. Then the whole fleet opened fire, the Egyptian artillerymen\nreplying with great steadiness and resolution. There was scarcely a\nbreath of wind, and the ships were, in a few instants, shrouded in\ntheir own smoke; and were frequently obliged to cease firing until this\ndrifted slowly away, to enable them to aim their guns. The rattle of\nthe machine guns added to the din. Midshipmen were sent aloft, and\nthese signalled down to the deck the result of each shot, so that the\ngunners were enabled to direct their fire, even when they could not see\nten yards beyond the muzzle of the guns.\n\nIn a short time, the forts and batteries showed how terrible was the\neffect of the great shells. The embrasures were torn and widened, there\nwere great gaps in the masonry of the buildings, and the hail of\nmissiles from the machine guns swept every spot near the Egyptian guns;\nand yet, Arabi's soldiers did not flinch but, in spite of the number\nthat fell, worked their guns as fast as ever.\n\nHad they been accustomed to the huge Krupp guns in their batteries, the\ncombat would have been more equal; and although the end would have been\nthe same, the ships must have suffered terribly. Fortunately, the\nEgyptian artillerymen had little experience in the working of these\nheavy pieces, and their shot in almost every case flew high--sometimes\nabove the masts, sometimes between them, but in only a few instances\nstriking the hull. With their smaller guns they made good practice, but\nthough the shot from these pieces frequently struck, they dropped\nharmlessly from the iron sides, and only those that entered through the\nportholes effected any damage.\n\nThe Condor, under Lord Charles Beresford, was the first to engage Fort\nMarabout; and, for a time, the little gunboat was the mark of all the\nguns of the fort. But the other four gunboats speedily came to her\nassistance, and effectually diverted the fire of the fort from the\nships that were engaging Fort Mex.\n\nAt eight o'clock the Monarch, having silenced the fort opposite to her,\nand dismounted the guns, joined the Inflexible and Penelope in their\nduel with Fort Mex; and by nine o'clock all the guns were silenced\nexcept four, two of which were heavy rifled guns, well sheltered. In\nspite of the heavy fire from the three great ships, the Egyptian\nsoldiers maintained their fire, the officers frequently exposing\nthemselves to the bullets of the machine guns by leaping upon the\nparapet, to ascertain the effect of their own shot.\n\nThe harbour forts were, by this time, crumbling under the shot of four\nwarships opposed to them. The Pharos suffered most heavily, and its\nguns were absolutely silenced; while the fire from the other two forts\nslackened, considerably. At half-past ten, it was seen that the\nRas-el-Teen Palace, which lay behind the fort, was on fire; and, half\nan hour later, the fire from that fort and Fort Ada almost died out.\n\nThe British Admiral now gave the signal to cease firing, and as the\nsmoke cleared away, the effects of the five hours' bombardment were\nvisible. The forts and batteries were mere heaps of ruins. The guns\ncould be made out, lying dismounted, or standing with their muzzles\npointing upwards.\n\nThe ships had not come out scatheless, but their injuries were, for the\nmost part, immaterial; although rigging had been cut away, bulwarks\nsmashed, and sides dinted. One gun of the Penelope had been disabled,\nand two of the Alexandra. Only five men had been killed, altogether,\nand twenty-seven wounded.\n\nNo sign was made of surrender, and an occasional fire was kept up on\nthe forts, to prevent the Egyptians from repairing damages. At one\no'clock, twelve volunteers from the Invincible started to destroy the\nguns of Fort Mex. Their fire had ceased, and no men were to be seen in\nthe fort; but they might have been lying in wait to attack any landing\nparty.\n\nOn nearing the shore, the surf was found to be too heavy for the boat\nto pass through it, and Major Tulloch and six men swam ashore and\nentered the fort. It was found to be deserted, and all the guns but two\nten-inch pieces dismounted. The charges of gun cotton, that the\nswimmers brought ashore with them, were placed in the cannon; and their\nmuzzles blown off. After performing this very gallant service, the\nlittle party swam back to their boat.\n\nThe British admiral's position was now a difficult one. There were no\nsigns of surrender; for aught he could tell, fifteen thousand Egyptian\ntroops might be lying round the ruined forts, or in the town hard by,\nin readiness to oppose a landing. That these troops were not to be\ndespised was evident, by the gallantry with which they had fought their\nguns. This force would be aided by the mass of the population; and it\nwould be hazardous, indeed, to risk the loss of fifteen hundred men,\nand the reversal of the success already gained.\n\nAt the same time, it was painful to think that the Europeans on shore\nmight be massacred, and the whole city destroyed, by the exasperated\ntroops and fanatical population. It was known that the number of\nEnglishmen there was not large, two or three hundred at most; but there\nwas a much larger number of the lower class of Europeans--port\nlabourers, fishermen, petty shopkeepers, and others--who had preferred\ntaking their chance to the certainty of losing all their little\npossessions, if they left them.\n\nAnxiously the glasses of those on board the ships were directed towards\nthe shore, in hopes of seeing the white flag hoisted, or a boat come\nout with it flying; but there were no signs of the intentions of the\ndefenders, and the fleet prepared to resume the action in the morning.\nFort Marabout, and several of the batteries on the shore, were still\nunsilenced; and two heavy guns, mounted on the Moncrieff system (by\nwhich the gun rose to a level of the parapet, fired, and instantly sank\nagain), had continued to fire all day, in spite of the efforts of the\nfleet to silence them.\n\nNext morning, however, there was a long heavy swell, and the ironclads\nwere rolling too heavily for anything like accuracy of aim; but as\nparties of men could be seen, at work in the Moncrieff battery, fire\nwas opened upon them, and they speedily evacuated it.\n\nAll night, the Palace of Ras-el-Teen burned fiercely. Another great\nfire was raging in the heart of the town, and anxiety for those on\nshore, for the time, overpowered the feeling of exultation at the\nvictory that had been gained.\n\nAt half-past ten a white flag was hoisted at the Pharos battery, and\nall on board watched, with deep anxiety, what was to follow. Lieutenant\nLambton at once steamed into the fort, in the Bittern, to enquire if\nthe government were ready to surrender. It was three o'clock before he\nsteamed out again, with the news that his mission was fruitless; and\nthat the white flag had only been hoisted, by the officer in command of\nthe fort, to enable himself and his men to get away unmolested.\nLieutenant Lambton had obtained an interview with the military\ngovernor, on behalf of the government, and told him that we were not at\nwar with Egypt, and had simply destroyed the forts because they\nthreatened the fleet; that we had no conditions to impose upon the\ngovernment, but were ready to discuss any proposal; and that the troops\nwould be allowed to evacuate the forts, with the honour of war.\n\nIt was most unfortunate that the fleet had not brought with them two or\nthree thousand troops. Had they done so they could have landed at once,\nand saved a great portion of the town from destruction; but as he had\nno soldiers, the admiral could not land a portion of the sailors, as\nthe large Egyptian force in the town, which was still protected by a\nnumber of land batteries, might fall upon them.\n\nAt five o'clock the Helicon was sent in to say that white flags would\nnot be noticed, unless hoisted by authority; and if they were again\nshown, the British admiral would consider them the signs of a general\nsurrender. It was a long time before the Helicon returned, with news\nthat no communication had been received from the enemy, that the\nbarracks and arsenals seemed to be deserted and, as far as could be\nseen, the whole town was evacuated.\n\nAs evening wore on, fresh fires broke out in all parts of the town, and\na steam pinnace was sent ashore to ascertain, if possible, the state of\naffairs. Mr. Ross, a contractor for the supply of meat to the fleet,\nvolunteered to accompany it.\n\nThe harbour was dark and deserted. Not a light was to be seen in the\nhouses near the water. The crackling of the flames could be heard, with\nan occasional crash of falling walls and roofs. On nearing the landing\nplace the pinnace paused, for two or three minutes, for those on board\nto listen; and as all was quiet, steamed alongside. Mr. Ross jumped\nashore, and the boat backed off a few yards.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, he returned. That quarter of the town was\nentirely deserted, and he had pushed on until arrested by a barrier of\nflames. The great square was on fire, from end to end; the European\nquarter generally was in flames; and he could see, by the litter that\nstrewed the streets, that the houses had been plundered before being\nfired.\n\nWhen daylight broke, a number of Europeans could be seen, at the edge\nof the water, in the harbour. Boats were at once lowered; and the\ncrews, armed to the teeth, rowed ashore. Here they found about a\nhundred Europeans, many of them wounded. When rioting had broken out\nthey had, as arranged, assembled at the Anglo-Egyptian Bank. They were\ntaken off to the merchant steamers, lying behind the fleet, and their\ninformation confirmed the worst forebodings of the fugitives there.\n\nWhen the first gun of the bombardment was fired, Gregory had gone up,\nwith the other employees, to the top of the house; where they commanded\na view over the whole scene of action. After the first few minutes'\nfiring they could see but little, for batteries and ships were, alike,\nshrouded in smoke. At first, there had been some feeling of insecurity,\nand a doubt whether a shot too highly aimed might not come into the\ntown; but the orders to abstain carefully from injuring the city had\nbeen well observed, and, except to the Palace and a few houses close to\nthe water's edge, no damage was done.\n\nTowards evening, all those who had resolved to remain behind gathered\nat the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, or at Mr. Ferguson's. But a consultation\nwas held later, and it was agreed that next morning all should go to\nthe bank, which was a far more massive building, with fewer entrances,\nand greater facilities for defence. When the town was quiet, therefore,\nall were employed in transferring valuable goods there, and the house\nwas then locked up and left to its fate. Against a mere rising of the\nrabble the latter might have been successfully defended; but there was\nlittle doubt that, before leaving the town, the troops would join the\nfanatics; and in that case, a house not built with a special eye for\ndefence could hardly hope to hold out, against persistent attack.\n\nThe bank, however, might hope to make a stout defence. It was built of\nmassive stone, the lower windows were barred, and a strong barricade\nwas built against the massive doors. A hundred and twenty resolute men,\nall well armed, could hold it against even a persistent attack, if\nunsupported by artillery.\n\nEarly in the afternoon, all felt that the critical moment had\napproached. Throughout the night a fire had raged, from the opposite\nside of the great square; where several deserted houses had been broken\ninto, and plundered, by the mob; but the soldiers stationed in the\nsquare had prevented any further disorder.\n\nNow, however, parties of troops from the forts began to pour in. It was\nalready known that their losses had been very heavy, and that many of\nthe forts had been destroyed. Soon they broke up and, joining the mob,\ncommenced the work of pillage. Doors were blown in, shutters torn off\nand, with wild yells and shouts, the native population poured in. The\nwork of destruction had begun.\n\nThe garrison of the bank saw many Europeans, hurrying, too late, to\nreach that shelter, murdered before their eyes. In the Levantine\nquarter, the cracking of pistols and the shouts of men showed that the\nwork of massacre was proceeding there. Soon every door of the houses in\nthe great square was forced in, and ere long great numbers of men,\nloaded with spoil of all kinds, staggered out.\n\nSo far the bank had been left alone; but it was now its turn, and the\nmob poured down upon it. As they came up, a sharp fire broke out from\nevery window, answered by a discharge of muskets and pistols from the\ncrowd. Here men fell fast, but they had been worked up to such a pitch\nof excitement, and fanaticism, that the gaps were more than filled by\nfresh comers.\n\nAll the afternoon and evening the fight continued. In vain the mob\nendeavoured to break down the massive iron bars of the windows, and\nbatter in the doors. Although many of the defenders were wounded, and\nseveral killed; by the fire from the windows of the neighbouring\nhouses, and from the road; their steady fire, at the points most hotly\nattacked, drove their assailants back again and again.\n\nAt twelve o'clock the assault slackened. The soldiers had long left\nand, so far as could be seen from the roof of the house, had entirely\nevacuated the town; and as this fact became known to the mob, the\nthought of the consequences of their action cooled their fury; for they\nknew that, probably, the troops would land from the British ships next\nday. Each man had his plunder to secure, and gradually the crowd melted\naway.\n\nBy two o'clock all was quiet; and although, occasionally, fresh fires\nburst out in various quarters of the town, there could be little doubt\nthat the great bulk of the population had followed the example of the\narmy, and had left the city.\n\nThen the besieged gathered in the great office on the ground floor;\nand, as it was agreed that there would be probably no renewal of the\nattack, they quietly left the house, locking the doors after them, and\nmade their way down to the shore. They believed that they were the only\nsurvivors, but when they reached the end of the town, they found that\nthe building of the Credit Lyonnais had also been successfully\ndefended, though the Ottoman Bank had been overpowered, and all within\nit, upwards of a hundred in number, killed.\n\nGregory had done his full share in the defence, and received a musket\nball in the shoulder. His wife had passed a terrible time, while the\nconflagration was raging, and it was evident that the populace had\nrisen, and were undoubtedly murdering as well as burning and\nplundering; and her delight was indeed great when she saw her husband,\nwith others, approaching in a man-of-war's boat. The fact that one arm\nwas in a sling was scarcely noticed, in her joy at his return, alive.\n\n\"Thank God, you are safe!\" she said, as he came up the gangway. \"It has\nbeen an awful time, and I had almost given up hope of ever seeing you\nalive, again.\"\n\n\"I told you, dear, that I felt confident we could beat off the scum of\nthe town. Of course it was a sharp fight, but there was never any real\ndanger of their breaking in. We only lost about half a dozen, out of\nnearly a hundred and twenty, and some twenty of us were wounded. My\ninjury is not at all serious, and I shall soon be all right again. It\nis only a broken collarbone.\n\n\"However, it has been a terrible time. The great square, and almost all\nthe European quarter, have been entirely destroyed. The destruction of\nproperty is something frightful, and most of the merchants will be\nabsolutely ruined. Fortunately, our firm were insured, pretty well up\nto the full value.\"\n\n\"But I thought that they could not break in there?\"\n\n\"We all moved out, the evening before, to the Anglo-Egyptian Bank. The\ntown was full of troops, and we doubted whether we could hold the\nplace. As the bank was much stronger, we agreed that it was better to\njoin the two garrisons and fight it out there; and I am very glad we\ndid so, for I doubt whether we could have defended our place,\nsuccessfully.\"\n\nMr. Ferguson and the clerks had all come off with Gregory to the\nSimoon, on board which there was plenty of accommodation for them, as\nit was not one of the ships that had been taken up for the\naccommodation of the fugitives. Among the party who came on board was a\ndoctor, who had taken part in the defence of the bank, and had attended\nto the wounded as the fight went on. He did so again that evening, and\ntold Gregory that in a month he would, if he took care of himself, be\nable to use his arm again.\n\nThe next morning there was a consultation in the cabin. Mr. Ferguson\nhad gone on shore, late the previous afternoon; as five hundred sailors\nhad been landed, and had returned in the evening.\n\n\"It is certain,\" he said, \"that nothing can be done until the place is\nrebuilt. The sailors are busy at work, fighting the fire, but there are\ncontinued fresh outbreaks. The bulk of the natives have left; but\nArabi, before marching out, opened the prisons and released the\nconvicts; and these and the scum of the town are still there, and\ncontinue the destruction whenever they get a chance. A score or two\nhave been caught red handed and shot down, and a number of others have\nbeen flogged.\n\n\"Another batch of sailors will land this morning, and order will soon\nbe restored; unless Arabi, who is encamped, with some ten thousand men,\ntwo miles outside the town, makes an effort to recover the place. I\ndon't think he is likely to do so, for now that the European houses\nhave all been destroyed, there would be no longer any reluctance to\nbombard the town itself; and even if Arabi did recover it, he would\nvery soon be shelled out.\n\n\"By the way, a larger number of people have been saved than was\nimagined. Several of the streets in the poor European quarters have\nescaped. The people barricaded the ends, and fought so desperately that\ntheir assailants drew off, finding it easier to plunder the better\nquarters. Even if the mob had overcome the resistance of the defenders\nof the lanes, they would have found little worth taking there; so some\nfive hundred Europeans have escaped, and these will be very useful.\n\n\"Charley Beresford has charge of the police arrangements on shore, and\nhe has gangs of them at work fighting the fire, and all the natives are\nforced to assist. The wires will be restored in a day or two, when I\nshall, of course, telegraph for instructions; and have no doubt that\nMr. Partridge will send out orders to rebuild as soon as order is\ncompletely restored.\n\n\"I imagine that most of us will be recalled home, until that is done.\nEven if the place were intact, no business would be done, as our goods\nwould be of little use to the navy or army; for no doubt an army will\nbe sent. Arabi is as powerful as ever, but now that we have taken the\nmatter in hand, it must be carried through.\n\n\"At any rate, there will be no clerks' work to be done here. The plans\nfor a new building will naturally be prepared at home, and a foreman of\nworks sent out. It is a bad job for us all, but as it is we must not\ncomplain; for we have escaped with our lives, and I hope that, in six\nmonths, we may open again. However, we can form no plans, until I\nreceive instructions from home.\"\n\nGregory did not go ashore for the next week, by which time order had\nbeen completely restored, the fires extinguished, and the streets made,\nat least, passable. The sailors had been aided by a battalion of\nmarines, which had been telegraphed for from Malta by the admiral,\nbefore the bombardment began. The Khedive had returned to Has-el-Teen,\nwhich had only been partly destroyed, as soon as the blue-jackets\nentered. His arrival put an end to all difficulties, as henceforward\nour operations were carried on, nominally, by his orders.\n\nThe American ships entered the harbour the next day and the naval\nofficer in command landed one hundred and twenty-five men, to assist\nour blue-jackets; and, two days later, the 38th Regiment and a\nbattalion of the 60th Rifles arrived.\n\nThe shops in the streets that escaped destruction gradually reopened,\nand country people began to bring in supplies. Many of the refugees on\nboard the ships sailed for home, while those who found their houses\nstill standing, although everything in them was smashed and destroyed,\nset to work to make them habitable. Soon temporary sheds were erected,\nand such portions of the cargoes on board the merchantmen as would be\nlikely to find a sale, were landed.\n\nBefore the end of the week, Mr. Ferguson had received an answer to his\ntelegram. Three days previously he had received a wire: \"Have written\nfully.\" The letter came via Marseilles. After congratulations at the\nescape of himself and the staff, Mr. Partridge wrote:\n\n\"As you say that the house and warehouse are entirely destroyed, with\nall contents, there can be nothing for you and the clerks to do; and\nyou had best return, at once, to England. I will make the best\narrangements that I can for you all.\n\n\"As I have a plan of the ground, I have already instructed an architect\nto prepare a sketch for rebuilding, on a larger scale than before. The\ninsurance companies are sending out agents to verify claims. Looking at\nyour last report, it seems to me that the loss of goods, as well as\nthat of buildings, will be fully covered. Should any of the staff\ndetermine to remain in Alexandria, and to take their chance of finding\nsomething to do, you are authorized to pay them three months' salary,\nand to promise to reinstate them, as soon as we reopen.\n\n\"I anticipate no further disturbances, whatever. A strong force is\nbeing sent out, and there can be no doubt that Arabi will be crushed,\nas soon as it is ready to take the field.\"\n\nOther directions followed, but these were only amplifications of those\nmentioned.\n\n\"What do you think, Annie?\" Gregory said, when Ferguson had read to his\nstaff that portion of the letter that concerned them. \"Shall we take\nthe three months' pay and remain here, or shall we go back to England?\"\n\n\"What do you think, yourself?\"\n\n\"There are two lights in which to look at it, Annie. First, which would\nbe best for us? And secondly, which shall we like best? Of course, the\nfirst is the more difficult point to decide. You see, Partridge doesn't\nsay that we shall be kept on; he only says that he will do his best for\nus. I don't think that there is any chance of his keeping us on at full\npay. If he intended to do so, it would have been cheaper for him to\ngive us our pay here, in which case he would save our passages back to\nEngland and out again. I think we could not reckon on getting anything\nlike full pay, while we were in England, and you know I have lost faith\nin my literary powers. I think I have improved, but I certainly should\nnot like, after our last experience, to trust to that for keeping us,\nin England.\n\n\"The question is, what should I do here? There will be plenty of\nopenings, for men who can speak the native language, as labour\noverseers. The contractors for food for the army will want men of that\nsort; and as I know several of them, through my work in the port and\nbeing in Partridge's house, I have no doubt I could get employment that\nway, and carry on very well till trade is open again, and obtain then a\ngood deal better berth than they would offer me. No doubt, one could\nget employment in the transport or commissariat of the army, when it\ncomes out. That will be a thing to think seriously of.\n\n\"My objections to that are personal ones. In the first place, it would\nlead to nothing when the affair is over. In the second place, I should\nbe certain to meet men I knew at Harrow, or at the University, or since\nthen; and I own that I should shrink from that. As Gregory Hilliard, I\ndon't mind carrying a parcel or helping to load a dray; but I should\nnot like, as Gregory Hartley, to be known to be doing that sort of\nthing. Personally I feel not the smallest humiliation in doing so, but\nI don't think it would be fair to Geoffrey. I should not like it\nmyself, if I were an earl, for fellows who knew him to be able to say\nthat my brother was knocking about in Egypt as an interpreter, or mule\ndriver, or something of that sort. That certainly has to be taken into\nconsideration.\n\n\"It is not likely that I should get any sort of berth that an officer\nwould be appointed to, for every officer in the army, whose regiment is\nnot coming out here, will be rushing to the War Office to apply for any\nsort of appointment that would enable him to come out to the war.\n\n\"Again, it is almost certain that, when this business is over--and I\ndon't suppose it will last long, after we get an army out here--a fresh\nEgyptian force will be raised. You may be sure that the greater portion\nof our troops will be hurried back, as soon as it is over; and that, as\nthe present Egyptian army will be altogether smashed up, it will be\nabsolutely necessary that there should be a force, of some kind or\nother, that can put a stop to this Mahdi fellow's doings. He has\noverrun half the Soudan, and inflicted serious defeats on the Egyptian\ntroops there. He has captured a considerable portion of Kordofan; and,\nof course, it is owing to his insurrection that those rows have\noccurred down at the Red Sea, where our men have been fighting.\n\n\"It is likely enough that they may appoint some British officers to the\nnew force, and I might get a fair position on it. They will want\ninterpreters there. Promotion will be sure to be rapid, and I might\nhave opportunities of distinguishing myself, and get an appointment\nwhere I could, without discrediting it, take my own name again.\n\n\"These are only among the things that might be; but at the worst, I am\ncertain to get some sort of post, at Alexandria, which would enable us\nto live without trenching upon the three months' pay that is offered\nme; and then, if I could see nothing better, I could return to\nPartridge's employment when they reopen here, and I have no doubt that\nthey would improve my position.\n\n\"I don't think that Parrott is likely to come back again. The climate\ndid not suit him, and he is always having attacks of fever. Ferguson\nhas, I know, for he told me so, reported very favourably about my work\nto headquarters; and, as I have been wounded in defence of the house, I\nhave an additional claim. The others will, of course, be moved up, and\nI should get the junior clerkship--no advance in the way of\nremuneration, but a great improvement in position.\n\n\"So I think we had better accept the three months' pay, and take our\nchances. At any rate, there will be no fear of another disturbance at\nAlexandria. The mob have had a lesson here that they are not likely to\nforget, and I should fancy that, although we may withdraw the army, two\nor three regiments will be left here, and at Cairo, for a long time to\ncome. We should be fools, indeed, if we threw away the money that this\nbusiness will cost, before it is over, and let Egypt slip altogether\nout of our fingers again. France has forfeited her right to have\nanything to say in the matter. In our hands it will be a very valuable\npossession, and certainly our stay here would be of inestimable\nadvantage to the natives, as we should govern Egypt as we govern India,\nand do away with the tyranny, oppression, and extortion of the native\nofficials.\"\n\nMrs. Hilliard quite agreed with her husband; and accordingly, the next\nday, Gregory informed Mr. Ferguson that he would accept the three\nmonths' pay, and his discharge; and should, at any rate for a time,\nremain in Alexandria.\n\n\"I think you are right, Hilliard. There will be lots of opportunities\nhere for a man who knows the language as you do. If you like, I will\nspeak to Mr. Ross. I saw him yesterday, in the town, and he said that\ntwo of his assistants had been killed. He has already obtained a fresh\ncontract, and a very heavy one, for the supply of meat for the troops\nas they arrive; and I have no doubt he would be very glad to engage\nyou, on good terms, though the engagement could only be made during the\nstay of the army here.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. I shall be much obliged to you if you will do so; and\nI would rather that the engagement should be a temporary one, on both\nsides, so that I should be free to leave, at a few days' notice.\"\n\nThe contractor, after a chat with Gregory Hilliard, was glad to secure\nhis services. He saw the advantage that it would be to have a gentleman\nto represent him, with the army, instead of an agent of a very\ndifferent kind. Other men would do to purchase animals from the Arabs,\nor to receive them at the ports when they were brought over from Spain\nand Italy; but it required a variety of qualities, difficult to obtain\nin the same person, to act as agent with the army. Gregory was exactly\nthe man required, and he was soon on excellent terms, both with the\nofficers of the quartermaster's department, and the contractors who\nbrought in the cargoes of cattle.\n\nAs soon as the bulk of the army sailed from Alexandria to Ismailia, he\nmade the latter town his headquarters; and by his power of work, his\ntact and good temper, he smoothed away all the difficulties that so\noften arise between contractors and army officials, and won the\ngoodwill of all with whom he came in contact. When the army removed to\nCairo, after the defeat and dispersal of Arabi's force at Tel-el-Kebir,\nGregory established himself there, and was joined by his wife and\nchild.\n\nAs soon as matters settled down, and a considerable portion of the\ntroops had left Egypt, Mr. Ross said to him:\n\n\"Of course, our operations in the future will be comparatively small,\nMr. Hilliard, and I must reduce my staff.\"\n\n\"I quite understand that,\" Gregory replied, \"and I knew that I should\nhave to look out for something else.\"\n\n\"I shall be very sorry to lose your services, which have indeed been\ninvaluable, and I am sure have been appreciated, by the army men as\nmuch as by myself. I certainly should not think of your leaving me,\nuntil you get another berth; and it is only because I see an opening,\nif you like to take it, that might lead to something better, in the\nfuture, than anything I can offer you.\n\n\"You know that Colonel Hicks arrived here, a fortnight since, and is to\ntake command of the Egyptian army, and to have the rank of pasha.\nSeveral officers have received appointments on his staff. He will\nshortly be going up to Khartoum. I was speaking to him yesterday, and\nas I was doing so, two of the officers of Wolseley's staff came in. A\nquestion of supplies came up, and I mentioned your name, and said that\nI thought that you were the very man for him, that you were master of\nArabic, and an excellent organizer; and, a very important matter where\nthere were so few English officers together, a gentleman.\n\n\"One of the officers, who knew the work that you had done, at once\nconfirmed what I had said, and declared that Wolseley's quartermaster\ngeneral would speak as warmly in your favour. Hicks told me that, until\nhe got up to Khartoum, he could not say what arrangements would be made\nfor the supplies; but that he would, at any rate, be very glad to have\nyou with him, in the capacity of a first-class interpreter, and for\ngeneral service with the staff, with the temporary rank of captain;\nwith the special view of your services in organizing a supply train,\nwhen he moved forward. I said that I should speak to you, and ascertain\nyour views.\"\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you, indeed. I must take twenty-four hours\nto think it over. Of course I shall be guided, to some extent, by the\nquestion whether the appointment would be likely to be a permanent\none.\"\n\n\"That I have no doubt. Indeed, Hicks said as much. I asked him the\nquestion, and he replied, 'I can hardly make a permanent appointment\nnow, as I am not quite in the saddle; but I have no doubt, from what\nyou say, that Mr. Hilliard will make a valuable officer; and after our\nfirst campaign I shall, without difficulty, be able to obtain him a\npermanent appointment in the Egyptian army.'\"\n\n\"I thank you, most heartily, Mr. Ross. It seems to me a grand opening.\nThere is no doubt that, as our troops leave, the Egyptian army will be\nthoroughly reorganized; and there will be many openings for a man who\nknows the language, and is ready to work hard; and, no doubt, the\nregiments will be largely officered by Englishmen.\"\n\nThat evening, Gregory had a long talk with his wife.\n\n\"I don't like the thought of leaving you, even for a time; but no\ndoubt, when the Mahdi is settled with, you will be able to join me at\nKhartoum; which, I believe, is by no means an unpleasant place to live\nin. Of course, I shall come down and take you up. It is a splendid\nchance, and will really be my reinstatement. Once holding a commission\nin the Egyptian army, I should resume my own name, and have the future\nto look forward to. Entering the service as the army is being\nreorganized, I should have a great pull, and should be sure to get on,\nand be able to write to my father and brother, without its appearing\nthat I wanted help of any kind.\"\n\nThere were tears in Mrs. Hilliard's eyes, but she said bravely:\n\n\"I quite agree with you, Gregory. Of course, I shall be sorry that you\nshould leave me, even for a time; but it seems to me, too, that it is a\ngrand opportunity. You know what a pain it was to me, all the time that\nwe were at Alexandria, that you should be working in such a subordinate\nposition. Now there is an opening by which you will be in a position,\nere long, more worthy of your birth and education. I have no doubt I\nshall get on very well, here. I believe that Hicks Pasha has brought\nhis wife out with him here; and some of his officers will, no doubt, be\nmarried men also; and as the wife of one of his officers I shall, of\ncourse, get to know them. I should be selfish, indeed, to say a word to\nkeep you back, and shall be delighted to think of you associating with\nother English gentlemen, as one of themselves.\"\n\nAnd so it was settled. The next day, Gregory called on Hicks Pasha. The\nlatter had made some more enquiries respecting him, and was well\npleased with his appearance.\n\n\"I have already a gentleman named as staff interpreter, Mr. Hilliard,\nbut I can appoint you, at once, interpreter to the quartermaster's\ndepartment, attached to my personal staff for the present. I can tell\nyou that the Egyptian army will be largely increased, and I shall be\nable, after a time, to procure you a better appointment. When we have\nonce defeated the Mahdi, and restored order, there will be many\nappointments open for the reorganization of the Soudan. There are a\ngood many preparations to be made, before I leave, which I expect to do\nin the course of three or four weeks; and I shall be glad of your\nassistance, as soon as you can join us.\"\n\n\"I shall be glad to do so, at once. Mr. Ross has kindly told me that I\nam at liberty to resign my post, under him, as soon as I like.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. You may consider yourself appointed, today. My\nintention is to go first to Suakim, and thence up to Berber, and so by\nwater to Khartoum.\"\n\nThe next three weeks passed rapidly. Gregory was, on the following day,\nintroduced to the various officers of Hicks Pasha's staff; and, on\nlearning that he was married, the general asked him and his wife to\ndinner, to make the acquaintance of Lady Hicks, and the wives of three\nof his fellow officers.\n\nAt last, the time came for parting. Annie bore up well; and although,\nwhen alone, she had many a cry, she was always cheerful, and went with\nher husband and saw him off, at the station of the railway for\nIsmailia, without breaking down badly.\n\n\n\nChapter 3: A Terrible Disaster.\n\n\nIt was an anxious time for his wife, after Gregory started. He, and\nthose with him, had left with a feeling of confidence that the\ninsurrection would speedily be put down. The garrison of Khartoum had\ninflicted several severe defeats upon the Mahdi, but had also suffered\nsome reverses. This, however, was only to be expected, when the troops\nunder him were scarcely more disciplined than those of the Dervishes,\nwho had always been greatly superior in numbers, and inspired with a\nfanatical belief in their prophet. But with British officers to\ncommand, and British officers to drill and discipline the troops, there\ncould be no fear of a recurrence of these disasters.\n\nBefore they started, Mrs. Hilliard had become intimate with the wife of\nHicks Pasha, and those of the other married officers, and had paid\nvisits with them to the harems of high Turkish officials. Visits were\nfrequently exchanged, and what with these, and the care of the boy, her\ntime was constantly occupied. She received letters from Gregory, as\nfrequently as possible, after his arrival at Omdurman, and until he set\nout with the main body, under the general, on the way to El Obeid.\n\nBefore starting, he said he hoped that, in another two months, the\ncampaign would be over, El Obeid recovered, and the Mahdi smashed up;\nand that, as soon as they returned to Khartoum, Hicks Pasha would send\nfor his wife and daughters, and the other married officers for their\nwives; and, of course, she would accompany them.\n\n\"I cannot say much for Omdurman,\" he wrote; \"but Khartoum is a nice\nplace. Many of the houses there have shady gardens. Hicks has promised\nto recommend me for a majority, in one of the Turkish regiments. In the\nintervals of my own work, I have got up drill. I shall, of course, tell\nhim then what my real name is, so that I can be gazetted in it. It is\nlikely enough that, even after we defeat the Mahdi, this war may go on\nfor some time before it is stamped out; and in another year I may be a\nfull-blown colonel, if only an Egyptian one; and as the pay of the\nEnglish officers is good, I shall be able to have a very comfortable\nhome for you.\n\n\"I need not repeat my instructions, darling, as to what you must do in\nthe event, improbable as it is, of disaster. When absolutely assured of\nmy death, but not until then, you will go back to England with the boy,\nand see my father. He is not a man to change his mind, unless I were to\nhumble myself before him; but I think he would do the right thing for\nyou. If he will not, there is the letter for Geoffrey. He has no\nsettled income at present, but when he comes into the title he will, I\nfeel quite certain, make you an allowance. I know that you would, for\nyourself, shrink from doing this; but, for the boy's sake, you will not\nhesitate to carry out my instructions. I should say you had better\nwrite to my father, for the interview might be an unpleasant one; but\nif you have to appeal to Geoffrey, you had better call upon him and\nshow him this letter. I feel sure that he will do what he can.\n\n\"Gregory.\"\n\nA month later, a messenger came up from Suakim with a despatch, dated\nOctober 3rd. The force was then within a few days' march of El Obeid.\nThe news was not altogether cheering. Hordes of the enemy hovered about\ntheir rear. Communication was already difficult, and they had to depend\nupon the stores they carried, and cut themselves off altogether from\nthe base. He brought some private letters from the officers, and among\nthem one for Mrs. Hilliard. It was short, and written in pencil:\n\n\"In a few days, Dear, the decisive battle will take place; and although\nit will be a tough fight, none of us have any fear of the result. In\nthe very improbable event of a defeat, I shall, if I have time, slip on\nthe Arab dress I have with me, and may hope to escape. However, I have\nlittle fear that it will come to that. God bless and protect you, and\nthe boy!\n\n\"Gregory.\"\n\nA month passed away. No news came from Hicks Pasha, or any of his\nofficers. Then there were rumours current in the bazaars, of disaster;\nand one morning, when Annie called upon Lady Hicks, she found several\nof the ladies there with pale and anxious faces. She paused at the\ndoor.\n\n\"Do not be alarmed, Mrs. Hilliard,\" Lady Hicks said. \"Nizim Pasha has\nbeen here this morning. He thought that I might have heard the rumours\nthat are current in the bazaar, that there has been a disaster, but he\nsays there is no confirmation whatever of these reports. He does not\ndeny, however, that they have caused anxiety among the authorities; for\nsometimes these rumours, whose origin no one knows, do turn out to be\ncorrect. He said that enquiries have been made, but no foundation for\nthe stories can be got at. I questioned him closely, and he says that\nhe can only account for them on the ground that, if a victory had been\nwon, an official account from government should have been here before\nthis; and that it is solely on this account that these rumours have got\nabout. He said there was no reason for supposing that this silence\nmeant disaster. A complete victory might have been won; and yet the\nmessenger with the despatches might have been captured, and killed, by\nthe parties of tribesmen hanging behind the army, or wandering about\nthe country between the army and Khartoum. Still, of course, this is\nmaking us all very anxious.\"\n\nThe party soon broke up, none having any reassuring suggestions to\noffer; and Annie returned to her lodging, to weep over her boy, and\npray for the safety of his father. Days and weeks passed, and still no\nword came to Cairo. At Khartoum there was a ferment among the native\npopulation. No secret was made of the fact that the tribesmen who came\nand went all declared that Hicks Pasha's army was utterly destroyed. At\nlength, the Egyptian government announced to the wives of the officers\nthat pensions would be given to them, according to the rank of their\nhusbands. As captain and interpreter, Gregory's wife had but a small\none, but it was sufficient for her to live upon.\n\nOne by one, the other ladies gave up hope and returned to England, but\nAnnie stayed on. Misfortune might have befallen the army, but Gregory\nmight have escaped in disguise. She had, like the other ladies, put on\nmourning for him; for had she declared her belief that he might still\nbe alive, she could not have applied for the pension, and this was\nnecessary for the child's sake. Of one thing she was determined. She\nwould not go with him, as beggars, to the father who had cast Gregory\noff; until, as he had said, she received absolute news of his death.\nShe was not in want; but as her pension was a small one, and she felt\nthat it would be well for her to be employed, she asked Lady Hicks,\nbefore she left, to mention at the houses of the Egyptian ladies to\nwhom she went to say goodbye, that Mrs. Hilliard would be glad to give\nlessons in English, French, or music.\n\nThe idea pleased them, and she obtained several pupils. Some of these\nwere the ladies themselves, and the lessons generally consisted in\nsitting for an hour with them, two or three times a week, and talking\nto them; the conversation being in short sentences, of which she gave\nthem the English translation, which they repeated over and over again,\nuntil they knew them by heart. This caused great amusement, and was\naccompanied by much laughter, on the part of the ladies and their\nattendants.\n\nSeveral of her pupils, however, were young boys and girls, and the\nteaching here was of a more serious kind. The lessons to the boys were\ngiven the first thing in the morning, and the pupils were brought to\nher house by attendants. At eleven o'clock she taught the girls, and\nreturned at one, and had two hours more teaching in the afternoon. She\ncould have obtained more pupils, had she wished to; but the pay she\nreceived, added to her income, enabled her to live very comfortably,\nand to save up money. She had a Negro servant, who was very fond of the\nboy, and she could leave him in her charge with perfect confidence,\nwhile she was teaching.\n\nIn the latter part of 1884, she ventured to hope that some news might\nyet come to her, for a British expedition had started for the relief of\nGeneral Gordon, who had gone up early in the year to Khartoum; where it\nwas hoped that the influence he had gained among the natives, at the\ntime he was in command of the Egyptian forces in the Soudan, would\nenable him to make head against the insurrection. His arrival had been\nhailed by the population, but it was soon evident to him that, unless\naided by England with something more than words, Khartoum must finally\nfall.\n\nBut his requests for aid were slighted. He had asked that two regiments\nshould be sent from Suakim, to keep open the route to Berber, but Mr.\nGladstone's government refused even this slight assistance to the man\nthey had sent out, and it was not until May that public indignation, at\nthis base desertion of one of the noblest spirits that Britain ever\nproduced, caused preparations for his rescue to be made; and it was\nDecember before the leading regiment arrived at Korti, far up the Nile.\n\nAfter fighting two hard battles, a force that had marched across the\nloop of the Nile came down upon it above Metemmeh. A party started up\nthe river at once, in two steamers which Gordon had sent down to meet\nthem, but only arrived near the town to hear that they were too late,\nthat Khartoum had fallen, and that Gordon had been murdered. The army\nwas at once hurried back to the coast, leaving it to the Mahdists--more\ntriumphant than ever--to occupy Dongola; and to push down, and\npossibly, as they were confident they should do, to capture Egypt\nitself.\n\nThe news of the failure was a terrible blow to Mrs. Hilliard. She had\nhoped that, when Khartoum was relieved, some information at least might\nbe obtained, from prisoners, as to the fate of the British officers at\nEl Obeid. That most of them had been killed was certain, but she still\nclung to the hope that her husband might have escaped from the general\nmassacre, thanks to his knowledge of the language, and the disguise he\nhad with him; and even that if captured later on he might be a\nprisoner; or that he might have escaped detection altogether, and be\nstill living among friendly tribesmen. It was a heavy blow to her,\ntherefore, when she heard that the troops were being hurried down to\nthe coast, and that the Mahdi would be uncontested master of Egypt, as\nfar as Assouan.\n\nShe did, however, receive news when the force returned to Cairo, which,\nalthough depressing, did not extinguish all hope. Lieutenant Colonel\nColborne, by good luck, had ascertained that a native boy in the\nservice of General Buller claimed to have been at El Obeid. Upon\nquestioning him closely, he found out that he had unquestionably been\nthere, for he described accurately the position Colonel Colborne--who\nhad started with Hicks Pasha, but had been forced by illness to\nreturn--had occupied in one of the engagements. The boy was then the\nslave of an Egyptian officer of the expedition.\n\nThe army had suffered much from want of water, but they had obtained\nplenty from a lake within three days' march from El Obeid. From this\npoint they were incessantly fired at, by the enemy. On the second day\nthey were attacked, but beat off the enemy, though with heavy loss to\nthemselves. The next day they pressed forward, as it was necessary to\nget to water; but they were misled by their guide, and at noon the\nArabs burst down upon them, the square in which the force was marching\nwas broken, and a terrible slaughter took place. Then Hicks Pasha, with\nhis officers, seeing that all was lost, gathered together and kept the\nenemy at bay with their revolvers, till their ammunition was exhausted.\nAfter that they fought with their swords till all were killed, Hicks\nPasha being the last to fall. The lad himself hid among the dead and\nwas not discovered until the next morning, when he was made a slave by\nthe man who found him.\n\nThis was terrible! But there was still hope. If this boy had concealed\nhimself among the dead, her husband might have done the same. Not being\na combatant officer, he might not have been near the others when the\naffair took place; and moreover, the lad had said that the black\nregiment in the rear of the square had kept together and marched away;\nhe believed all had been afterwards killed, but this he did not know.\nIf Gregory had been there when the square was broken, he might well\nhave kept with them, and at nightfall slipped on his disguise and made\nhis escape. It was at least possible--she would not give up all hope.\n\nSo years went on. Things were quiet in Egypt. A native army had been\nraised there, under the command of British officers, and these had\nchecked the northern progress of the Mahdists and restored confidence\nin Egypt. Gregory--for the boy had been named after his father--grew up\nstrong and hearty. His mother devoted her evenings to his education.\nFrom the Negress, who was his nurse and the general servant of the\nhouse, he had learnt to talk her native language. She had been carried\noff, when ten years old, by a slave-raiding party, and sold to an\nEgyptian trader at Khartoum; been given by him to an Atbara chief, with\nwhom he had dealings; and, five years later, had been captured in a\ntribal war by the Jaalin. Two or three times she had changed masters,\nand finally had been purchased by an Egyptian officer, and brought down\nby him to Cairo. At his death, four years afterwards, she had been\ngiven her freedom, being now past fifty, and had taken service with\nGregory Hilliard and his wife. Her vocabulary was a large one, and she\nwas acquainted with most of the dialects of the Soudan tribes.\n\nFrom the time when her husband was first missing, Mrs. Hilliard\ncherished the idea that, some day, the child might grow up and search\nfor his father; and, perhaps, ascertain his fate beyond all doubt. She\nwas a very conscientious woman, and was resolved that, at whatever pain\nto herself, she would, when once certain of her husband's death, go to\nEngland and obtain recognition of his boy by his family. But it was\npleasant to think that the day was far distant when she could give up\nhope. She saw, too, that if the Soudan was ever reconquered, the\nknowledge of the tribal languages must be of immense benefit to her\nson; and she therefore insisted, from the first, that the woman should\nalways talk to him in one or other of the languages that she knew.\n\nThus Gregory, almost unconsciously, acquired several of the dialects\nused in the Soudan. Arabic formed the basis of them all, except the\nNegro tongue. At first he mixed them up, but as he grew, Mrs. Hilliard\ninsisted that his nurse should speak one for a month, and then use\nanother; so that, by the time he was twelve years old, the boy could\nspeak in the Negro tongue, and half a dozen dialects, with equal\nfacility.\n\nHis mother had, years before, engaged a teacher of Arabic for him. This\nhe learned readily, as it was the root of the Egyptian and the other\nlanguages he had picked up. Of a morning, he sat in the school and\nlearned pure Arabic and Turkish, while the boys learned English; and\ntherefore, without an effort, when he was twelve years old he talked\nthese languages as well as English; and had, moreover, a smattering of\nItalian and French, picked up from boys of his own age, for his mother\nhad now many acquaintances among the European community.\n\nWhile she was occupied in the afternoon, with her pupils, the boy had\nliberty to go about as he pleased; and indeed she encouraged him to\ntake long walks, to swim, and to join in all games and exercises.\n\n\"English boys at home,\" she said, \"have many games, and it is owing to\nthese that they grow up so strong and active. They have more\nopportunities than you, but you must make the most of those that you\nhave. We may go back to England some day, and I should not at all like\nyou to be less strong than others.\"\n\nAs, however, such opportunities were very small, she had an apparatus\nof poles, horizontal bars, and ropes set up, such as those she had\nseen, in England, in use by the boys of one of the families where she\nhad taught, before her marriage; and insisted upon Gregory's exercising\nhimself upon it for an hour every morning, soon after sunrise. As she\nhad heard her husband once say that fencing was a splendid exercise,\nnot only for developing the figure, but for giving a good carriage as\nwell as activity and alertness, she arranged with a Frenchman who had\nserved in the army, and had gained a prize as a swordsman in the\nregiment, to give the boy lessons two mornings in the week.\n\nThus, at fifteen, Gregory was well grown and athletic, and had much of\nthe bearing and appearance of an English public-school boy. His mother\nhad been very particular in seeing that his manners were those of an\nEnglishman.\n\n\"I hope the time will come when you will associate with English\ngentlemen, and I should wish you, in all respects, to be like them. You\nbelong to a good family; and should you, by any chance, some day go\nhome, you must do credit to your dear father.\"\n\nThe boy had, for some years, been acquainted with the family story,\nexcept that he did not know the name he bore was his father's Christian\nname, and not that of his family.\n\n\"My grandfather must have been a very bad man, Mother, to have\nquarreled with my father for marrying you.\"\n\n\"Well, my boy, you hardly understand the extent of the exclusiveness of\nsome Englishmen. Of course, it is not always so, but to some people,\nthe idea of their sons or daughters marrying into a family of less rank\nthan themselves appears to be an almost terrible thing. As I have told\nyou, although the daughter of a clergyman, I was, when I became an\norphan, obliged to go out as a governess.\"\n\n\"But there was no harm in that, Mother?\"\n\n\"No harm, dear; but a certain loss of position. Had my father been\nalive, and had I been living with him in a country rectory, your\ngrandfather might not have been pleased at your father's falling in\nlove with me, because he would probably have considered that, being, as\nyou know by his photograph, a fine, tall, handsome man, and having the\nbest education money could give him, he might have married very much\nbetter; that is to say, the heiress of a property, or into a family of\ninfluence, through which he might have been pushed on; but he would not\nhave thought of opposing the marriage on the ground of my family. But a\ngoverness is a different thing. She is, in many cases, a lady in every\nrespect, but her position is a doubtful one.\n\n\"In some families she is treated as one of themselves. In others, her\nposition is very little different from that of an upper servant. Your\ngrandfather was a passionate man, and a very proud man. Your father's\nelder brother was well provided for, but there were two sisters, and\nthese and your father he hoped would make good marriages. He lived in\nvery good style, but your uncle was extravagant, and your grandfather\nwas over indulgent, and crippled himself a good deal in paying the\ndebts that he incurred. It was natural, therefore, that he should have\nobjected to your father's engagement to what he called a penniless\ngoverness. It was only what was to be expected. If he had stated his\nobjections to the marriage calmly, there need have been no quarrel.\nYour father would assuredly have married me, in any case; and your\ngrandfather might have refused to assist him, if he did so, but there\nneed have been no breakup in the family, such as took place.\n\n\"However, as it was, your father resented his tone, and what had been\nmerely a difference of opinion became a serious quarrel, and they never\nsaw each other, afterwards. It was a great grief to me, and it was\nowing to that, and his being unable to earn his living in England, that\nyour father brought me out here. I believe he would have done well at\nhome, though it would have been a hard struggle. At that time I was\nvery delicate, and was ordered by the doctors to go to a warm climate,\nand therefore your father accepted a position of a kind which, at\nleast, enabled us to live, and obtained for me the benefit of a warm\nclimate.\n\n\"Then the chance came of his going up to the Soudan, and there was a\ncertainty that, if the expedition succeeded, as everyone believed it\nwould, he would have obtained permanent rank in the Egyptian army, and\nso recovered the position in life that he had voluntarily given up, for\nmy sake.\"\n\n\"And what was the illness you had, Mother?\"\n\n\"It was an affection of the lungs, dear. It was a constant cough, that\nthreatened to turn to consumption, which is one of the most fatal\ndiseases we have in England.\"\n\n\"But it hasn't cured you, Mother, for I often hear you coughing, at\nnight.\"\n\n\"Yes, my cough has been a little troublesome of late, Gregory.\"\n\nIndeed, from the time of the disaster to the expedition of Hicks Pasha,\nAnnie Hilliard had lost ground. She herself was conscious of it; but,\nexcept for the sake of the boy, she had not troubled over it. She had\nnot altogether given up hope, but the hope grew fainter and fainter, as\nthe years went on. Had it not been for the promise to her husband, not\nto mention his real name or to make any application to his father\nunless absolutely assured of his death, she would, for Gregory's sake,\nhave written to Mr. Hartley, and asked for help that would have enabled\nher to take the boy home to England, and have him properly educated\nthere. But she had an implicit faith in the binding of a promise so\nmade, and as long as she was not driven, by absolute want, to apply to\nMr. Hartley, was determined to keep to it.\n\nA year after this conversation, Gregory was sixteen. Now tall and\nstrong, he had, for some time past, been anxious to obtain some\nemployment that would enable his mother to give up her teaching. Some\nof this, indeed, she had been obliged to relinquish. During the past\nfew months her cheeks had become hollow, and her cough was now frequent\nby day, as well as by night. She had consulted an English doctor, who,\nshe saw by the paper, was staying at Shepherd's Hotel. He had hesitated\nbefore giving a direct opinion, but on her imploring him to tell her\nthe exact state of her health, said gently:\n\n\"I am afraid, madam, that I can give you no hope of recovery. One lung\nhas already gone, the other is very seriously diseased. Were you living\nin England, I should say that your life might be prolonged by taking\nyou to a warm climate; but as it is, no change could be made for the\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Doctor. I wanted to know the exact truth, and be able to\nmake my arrangements accordingly. I was quite convinced that my\ncondition was hopeless, but I thought it right to consult a physician,\nand to know how much time I could reckon on. Can you tell me that?\"\n\n\"That is always difficult, Mrs. Hilliard. It may be three months hence.\nIt might be more speedily--a vessel might give way in the lungs,\nsuddenly. On the other hand, you might live six months. Of course, I\ncannot say how rapid the progress of the disease has been.\"\n\n\"It may not be a week, doctor. I am not at all afraid of hearing your\nsentence--indeed, I can see it in your eyes.\"\n\n\"It may be within a week\"--the doctor bowed his head gravely--\"it may\nbe at any time.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" she said, quietly. \"I was sure it could not be long. I\nhave been teaching, but three weeks ago I had to give up my last pupil.\nMy breath is so short that the slightest exertion brings on a fit of\ncoughing.\"\n\nOn her return home she said to Gregory:\n\n\"My dear boy, you must have seen--you cannot have helped seeing--that\nmy time is not long here. I have seen an English doctor today, and he\nsays the end may come at any moment.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mother, Mother!\" the lad cried, throwing himself on his knees, and\nburying his face in her lap, \"don't say so!\"\n\nThe news, indeed, did not come as a surprise to him. He had, for\nmonths, noticed the steady change in her: how her face had fallen away,\nhow her hands seemed nerveless, her flesh transparent, and her eyes\ngrew larger and larger. Many times he had walked far up among the hills\nand, when beyond the reach of human eye, thrown himself down and cried\nunrestrainedly, until his strength seemed utterly exhausted, and yet\nthe verdict now given seemed to come as a sudden blow.\n\n\"You must not break down, dear,\" she said quietly. \"For months I have\nfelt that it was so; and, but for your sake, I did not care to live. I\nthank God that I have been spared to see you growing up all that I\ncould wish; and though I should have liked to see you fairly started in\nlife, I feel that you may now make your way, unaided.\n\n\"Now I want, before it is too late, to give you instructions. In my\ndesk you will find a sealed envelope. It contains a copy of the\nregisters of my marriage, and of your birth. These will prove that your\nfather married, and had a son. You can get plenty of witnesses who can\nprove that you were the child mentioned. I promised your father that I\nwould not mention our real name to anyone, until it was necessary for\nme to write to your grandfather. I have kept that promise. His name was\nGregory Hilliard, so we have not taken false names. They were his\nChristian names. The third name, his family name, you will find when\nyou open that envelope.\n\n\"I have been thinking, for months past, what you had best do; and this\nis my advice, but do not look upon it as an order. You are old enough\nto think for yourself. You know that Sir Herbert Kitchener, the Sirdar,\nis pushing his way up the Nile. I have no doubt that, with your\nknowledge of Arabic, and of the language used by the black race in the\nSoudan, you will be able to obtain some sort of post in the army,\nperhaps as an interpreter to one of the officers commanding a\nbrigade--the same position, in fact, as your father had, except that\nthe army is now virtually British, whereas that he went with was\nEgyptian.\n\n\"I have two reasons for desiring this. I do not wish you to go home,\nuntil you are in a position to dispense with all aid from your family.\nI have done without it, and I trust that you will be able to do the\nsame. I should like you to be able to go home at one-and-twenty, and to\nsay to your grandfather, 'I have not come home to ask for money or\nassistance of any kind. I am earning my living honourably. I only ask\nrecognition, by my family, as my father's son.'\n\n\"It is probable that this expedition will last fully two years. It must\nbe a gradual advance, and even then, if the Khalifa is beaten, it must\nbe a considerable time before matters are thoroughly settled. There\nwill be many civil posts open to those who, like yourself, are well\nacquainted with the language of the country; and if you can obtain one\nof these, you may well remain there until you come of age. You can then\nobtain a few months' leave of absence and go to England.\n\n\"My second reason is that, although my hope that your father is still\nalive has almost died out, it is just possible that he is, like Neufeld\nand some others, a prisoner in the Khalifa's hands; or possibly living\nas an Arab cultivator near El Obeid. Many prisoners will be taken, and\nfrom some of these we may learn such details, of the battle, as may\nclear us of the darkness that hangs over your father's fate.\n\n\"When you do go home, Gregory, you had best go first to your father's\nbrother. His address is on a paper in the envelope. He was heir to a\npeerage, and has, perhaps, now come into it. I have no reasons for\nsupposing that he sided with his father against yours. The brothers\nwere not bad friends, although they saw little of each other; for your\nfather, after he left Oxford, was for the most part away from England,\nuntil a year before his marriage; and at that time your uncle was in\nAmerica, having gone out with two or three others on a hunting\nexpedition among the Rocky Mountains. There is, therefore, no reason\nfor supposing that he will receive you otherwise than kindly, when once\nhe is sure that you are his nephew. He may, indeed, for aught I know,\nhave made efforts to discover your father, after he returned from\nabroad.\"\n\n\"I would rather leave them alone altogether, Mother,\" Gregory said\npassionately.\n\n\"That you cannot do, my boy. Your father was anxious that you should be\nat least recognized, and afterwards bear your proper name. You will not\nbe going as a beggar, and there will be nothing humiliating. As to your\ngrandfather, he may not even be alive. It is seldom that I see an\nEnglish newspaper, and even had his death been advertised in one of the\npapers, I should hardly have noticed it, as I never did more than just\nglance at the principal items of news.\n\n\"In my desk you will also see my bank book. It is in your name. I have\nthought it better that it should stand so, as it will save a great deal\nof trouble, should anything happen to me. Happily, I have never had any\nreasons to draw upon it, and there are now about five hundred and fifty\npounds standing to your credit. Of late you have generally paid in the\nmoney, and you are personally known to the manager. Should there be any\ndifficulty, I have made a will leaving everything to you. That sum will\nkeep you, if you cannot obtain the employment we speak of, until you\ncome of age; and will, at any rate, facilitate your getting employment\nwith the army, as you will not be obliged to demand much pay, and can\ntake anything that offers.\n\n\"Another reason for your going to England is that your grandfather may,\nif he is dead, have relented at last towards your father, and may have\nleft him some share in his fortune; and although you might well refuse\nto accept any help from him, if he is alive, you can have no hesitation\nin taking that which should be yours by right. I think sometimes now,\nmy boy, that I have been wrong in not accepting the fact of your\nfather's death as proved, and taking you home to England; but you will\nbelieve that I acted for the best, and I shrank from the thought of\ngoing home as a beggar, while I could maintain you and myself\ncomfortably, here.\"\n\n\"You were quite right, Mother dear. We have been very happy, and I have\nbeen looking forward to the time when I might work for you, as you have\nworked for me. It has been a thousand times better, so, than living on\nthe charity of a man who looked down upon you, and who cast off my\nfather.\"\n\n\"Well, you will believe at least that I acted for the best, dear, and I\nam not sure that it has not been for the best. At any rate I, too, have\nbeen far happier than I could have been, if living in England on an\nallowance begrudged to me.\"\n\nA week later, Gregory was awakened by the cries of the Negro servant;\nand, running to Mrs. Hilliard's bedroom, found that his mother had\npassed away during the night. Burial speedily follows death in Egypt;\nand on the following day Gregory returned, heartbroken, to his lonely\nhouse, after seeing her laid in her grave.\n\nFor a week, he did nothing but wander about the house, listlessly.\nThen, with a great effort, he roused himself. He had his work before\nhim--had his mother's wishes to carry out. His first step was to go to\nthe bank, and ask to see the manager.\n\n\"You may have heard of my mother's death, Mr. Murray?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, my lad, and sorry, indeed, I was to hear of it. She was greatly\nliked and respected, by all who knew her.\"\n\n\"She told me,\" Gregory went on, trying to steady his voice, \"a week\nbefore her death, that she had money here deposited in my name.\"\n\n\"That is so.\"\n\n\"Is there anything to be done about it, sir?\"\n\n\"Not unless you wish to draw it out. She told me, some time ago, why\nshe placed it in your name; and I told her that there would be no\ndifficulty.\"\n\n\"I do not want to draw any of it out, sir, as there were fifty pounds\nin the house. She was aware that she had not long to live, and no doubt\nkept it by her, on purpose.\"\n\n\"Then all you have to do is to write your signature on this piece of\npaper. I will hand you a cheque book, and you will only have to fill up\na cheque and sign it, and draw out any amount you please.\"\n\n\"I have never seen a cheque book, sir. Will you kindly tell me what I\nshould have to do?\"\n\nMr. Murray took out a cheque book, and explained its use. Then he asked\nwhat Gregory thought of doing.\n\n\"I wish to go up with the Nile expedition, sir. It was my mother's\nwish, also, that I should do so. My main object is to endeavour to\nobtain particulars of my father's death, and to assure myself that he\nwas one of those who fell at El Obeid. I do not care in what capacity I\ngo up; but as I speak Arabic and Soudanese, as well as English, my\nmother thought that I might get employment as interpreter, either under\nan officer engaged on making the railway, or in some capacity under an\nofficer in one of the Egyptian regiments.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that I can help you there, lad. I know the Sirdar, and\na good many of the British officers, for whom I act as agent. Of\ncourse, I don't know in what capacity they could employ you, but surely\nsome post or other could be found for you, where your knowledge of the\nlanguage would render you very useful. Naturally, the officers in the\nEgyptian service all understand enough of the language to get on with,\nbut few of the officers in the British regiments do.\n\n\"It is fortunate that you came today. I have an appointment with Lord\nCromer tomorrow morning, so I will take the opportunity of speaking to\nhim. As it is an army affair, and as your father was in the Egyptian\nservice, and your mother had a pension from it, I may get him to\ninterest himself in the matter. Kitchener is down here at present, and\nif Cromer would speak to him, I should think you would certainly be\nable to get up, though I cannot say in what position. The fact that you\nare familiar with the Negro language, which differs very widely from\nthat of the Arab Soudan tribes, who all speak Arabic, is strongly in\nyour favour; and may give you an advantage over applicants who can only\nspeak Arabic.\n\n\"I shall see Lord Cromer at ten, and shall probably be with him for an\nhour. You may as well be outside his house, at half-past ten; possibly\nhe may like to see you. At any rate, when I come down, I can tell you\nwhat he says.\"\n\nWith grateful thanks, Gregory returned home.\n\n\n\nChapter 4: An Appointment.\n\n\nSoon after ten, next morning, Gregory took up his place near the\nentrance to Lord Cromer's house. It was just eleven when Mr. Murray\ncame down.\n\n\"Come in with me,\" he said. \"Lord Cromer will see you. He acknowledged\nat once, when I told him your story, that you had a strong claim for\nemployment. The only point was as to your age. I told him that you were\npast sixteen, and a strong, active fellow, and that you had had a good\nphysical training.\"\n\nThey had now entered the house.\n\n\"Don't be nervous, Hilliard; just talk to him as you would to me. Many\na good man has lost an appointment, from being nervous and embarrassed\nwhen he applied for it.\"\n\n\"You want to go up to the Soudan?\" Lord Cromer said. \"Mr. Murray has\ntold me your reasons for wanting to go. Though I fear it is hardly\nlikely that any new light can be thrown upon the fate of Hicks Pasha,\nand his officers, I feel that it is a natural desire on your part.\"\n\n\"It was my mother's last wish, sir, and she took particular pains in my\ntraining, and education, to fit me for the work.\"\n\n\"You speak Arabic, and the tongue of the Negro blacks, almost as well\nas English?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Arabic quite as well, and the other nearly as well, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"What sort of post did you hope to get, Mr. Hilliard?\"\n\n\"Any post for which I may be thought fit, sir. I do not care at all\nabout pay. My mother saved sufficient to keep me for two or three\nyears. I would rather enlist than not go up at all, though I fear I am\ntoo young to be accepted; but I am quite ready to turn my hand to\nanything.\"\n\n\"If it concerned the Egyptian government, or a civil appointment, I\nwould certainly exert my influence in your favour; but this expedition\nis in the hands of the military. However, if you will take a seat in\nthe anteroom, and do not mind waiting there for an hour or two, I will\nsee what can be done.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much indeed, sir.\"\n\nMr. Murray, as they went out together, said:\n\n\"I think that you have made a good impression. He told me, before, that\nit was a matter for Sir Herbert Kitchener, and that he was expecting\nhim in a quarter of an hour. Come and tell me the result, when you\nleave.\"\n\nTen minutes later, a tall man, whom Gregory recognized at once as Sir\nHerbert Kitchener, whose figure was well known in Cairo, passed through\nthe room; all who were sitting there rising to their feet, as he did\nso. He acknowledged the salute mechanically, as if scarcely conscious\nof it. An hour later a bell was rung, and an attendant went into the\nroom. He returned directly.\n\n\"Mr. Hilliard,\" he said.\n\nGregory rose, and passed through the door held open. Kitchener was\nsitting at the table with Lord Cromer. His keen glance seemed, to\nGregory, to take him in from head to foot, and then to look at\nsomething far beyond him.\n\n\"This is Mr. Hilliard,\" Lord Cromer said, \"the young gentleman I have\nspoken of.\"\n\n\"You want to go up?\" the general said shortly, in Arabic.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You do not mind in what capacity you go?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I am ready to do anything.\"\n\n\"To work on the railway, or in the transport?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Though I would rather not be on the railway, for the railway\ncannot get on as fast as the troops; but I would enlist in one of the\nEnglish regiments, if they would take me.\"\n\n\"And you speak the language of the Nubian blacks?\"\n\nThe question was put in that language.\n\n\"Yes; I do not think I speak it quite as well as Arabic, but I speak it\nfairly.\"\n\n\"Do you think that you could stand the fatigue?--no child's play, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"I can only say that I hope I can, sir. I have been accustomed to take\nlong walks, and spend an hour a day in gymnastic exercises, and I have\nhad lessons in fencing.\"\n\n\"Can you use a pistol?\"\n\n\"Yes, fairly; I have practised a good deal with it.\"\n\n\"You are most fitted for an interpreter,\" the general said, speaking\nthis time in English. \"Now the North Staffordshire have come down,\nthere are no British regiments up there, and of course the British\nofficers in the Egyptian army all speak Arabic, to some extent.\nHowever, I will send you up to Dongola. Either General Hunter, or\nColonel Wingate, of the Intelligence Department, may be able to find\nsome use for you; and when the British troops go up, you can be\nattached to one of their regiments as their interpreter. You will have\ntemporary rank of lieutenant, with, of course, the pay of that rank.\n\n\"Captain Ewart came with me, Lord Cromer. I left him in the anteroom.\nIf you will allow me, I will call him in.\n\n\"Captain Ewart,\" he said, as that officer entered, \"Mr. Hilliard here\nhas just received the temporary rank of lieutenant, in the Egyptian\narmy, and is going up to join General Hunter, at Dongola. You are\nstarting in three days, are you not?\n\n\"I shall be glad if you will take him under your wing, as far as you\ngo. He speaks the languages, Negro as well as Arabic. You can tell him\nwhat kit he had better take, and generally mother him.\n\n\"That is all, Mr. Hilliard. Call at my quarters, the day after\ntomorrow, for the letters for General Hunter and Colonel Wingate.\"\n\n\"I thank you most deeply, sir,\" Gregory began, but the Sirdar gave a\nlittle impatient wave with his hand.\n\n\"Thank you most deeply also, Lord Cromer!\" Gregory said with a bow, and\nthen left the room.\n\nCaptain Ewart remained there for another ten minutes. When he came out,\nhe nodded to Gregory.\n\n\"Will you come with me?\" he said. \"I am going to the bank. I shall not\nbe there many minutes, and we can then have a talk together.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir! I am going to the bank too. It was Mr. Murray who\nfirst spoke to Lord Cromer about me.\"\n\n\"You could not have had a better introduction. Well, you won't have\nvery long to get ready for the start--that is, if you have not begun to\nprepare for it. However, there is no rush at present, therefore I have\nno doubt you will be able to get your khaki uniforms in time. As for\nother things, there will be no difficulty about them.\"\n\n\"You have been up at the front before, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, my work is on the railway. I had a touch of fever, and got leave\nto come down and recruit, before the hot weather came in. I dare say\nyou think it hot here, sometimes, but this is an ice house in\ncomparison with the desert.\"\n\nThey talked until they arrived at the bank.\n\n\"You may as well go in first, and see Murray. I suppose you won't be\nabove two or three minutes. I shall be longer, perhaps a quarter of an\nhour; so if you wait for me, we will go to Shepherd's, and talk your\nbusiness over in some sort of comfort.\"\n\n\"I am pleased, indeed,\" Mr. Murray said, when Gregory told him of his\nappointment. \"It is better than I even hoped. It is bad enough there,\nin the position of an officer, but it would be infinitely worse in any\nother capacity. Do you want to draw any money?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I have fifty pounds by me, and that will be enough, I should\nthink, for everything.\"\n\n\"More than ample. Of course, you have plenty of light underclothing of\nall sorts, and a couple of suits of khaki will not cost you anything\nlike so much as they would, if you got them at a military tailor's in\nLondon. However, if you want more, you will be able to draw it.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir! I will not detain you any longer, now; but\nwill, if you will allow me, come in to say goodbye before I start.\nCaptain Ewart is waiting to speak to you. He came with me from Lord\nCromer's.\"\n\nCaptain Ewart then went in, and after settling the business on which he\nhad come, asked Mr. Murray questions about Gregory, and received a\nsketch of his story.\n\n\"He seems to be a fine young fellow,\" he said, \"well grown and active,\nnot at all what one would expect from a product of Cairo.\"\n\n\"No, indeed. Of course, you have not seen him to advantage, in that\nblack suit, but in his ordinary clothes I should certainly take him, if\nI had not seen him before, to be a young lieutenant freshly come out to\njoin.\"\n\n\"Did you know the father?\"\n\n\"No, I was not here at that time; but the mother was a lady, every\ninch. It is strange that neither of them should have friends in\nEngland. It may be that she preferred to earn her living here, and be\naltogether independent.\"\n\n\"She had a pension, hadn't she?\"\n\n\"A small one, but she really earned her living by teaching. She gave\nlessons to the ladies in English, French, and music, and had classes\nfor young boys and girls. I once asked her if she did not intend to go\nback and settle in England, and she said 'Possibly, some day.'\n\n\"I fancy that there must have been some mystery about the affair--what,\nI can't say; but at any rate, we may take it that such a woman would\nnot have married a man who was not a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Certainly the boy looks a well-bred one,\" Captain Ewart said, \"and I\nam sure that the Sirdar must have been taken with him. You don't know\nany more about his father than you have told me?\"\n\n\"Very little. Once, in talking with his wife, she told me that her\nhusband had been in a commercial house, in Alexandria, for a year; but\nthe place was burned down at the time of the bombardment. Being thus\nout of harness, he became an assistant to one of the army contractors\nand, when things settled down at Cairo, obtained a berth as\ninterpreter, with the temporary rank of captain, on Hicks Pasha's\nstaff, as he also spoke Arabic fluently. I can tell you no more about\nhim than that, as I never saw him; though no doubt he came here with\nhis wife, when her account was opened.\n\n\"I was interested in her. I looked up the old books, and found that two\nhundred pounds was paid into her account, before he left. I may say\nthat she steadily increased that amount, ever since; but a few years\nago she had the sum then standing transferred to the boy's name,\ntelling me frankly, at the time, that she did so to save trouble, in\ncase anything happened to her. I fancy, from what she said, that for\nthe last year or two she had been going downhill. I had a chat with\nher, the last time she came in. She told me that she had been\nconsumptive, and that it was for the sake of her health they came out\nhere.\"\n\n\"That accounts for it, Murray. By the date, they were probably only\nmarried a year or so before they came out; and a man who loved a young\nwife, and saw no other way of saving her, would throw up any berth at\nhome, in order to give her the benefit of a warm climate. Still, it is\na little curious that, if he had only been out here a year or so before\nHicks started, he should have learned Arabic sufficiently well to get a\npost as interpreter. I have been in the country about three years, and\ncan get on fairly well with the natives, in matters concerning my own\nwork; but I certainly could not act as general interpreter.\n\n\"Well, I am glad to have heard this, for you know the sort of men\ninterpreters generally are. From the lad's appearance and manner, there\nis no shadow of doubt that his mother was a lady. I thought it more\nthan probable that she had married beneath her, and that her husband\nwas of the ordinary interpreter class. Now, from what you have said, I\nsee that it is probable he came of a much better family. Well, you may\nbe sure that I shall do what I can for the lad.\"\n\nGregory joined him, as he left the bank.\n\n\"I think, Hilliard, we had best go to the tailor, first. His shop is\nnot far from here. As you want to get your things in three days, it is\nas well to have that matter settled, at once.\"\n\nThe two suits, each consisting of khaki tunic, breeches, and putties,\nwere ordered.\n\n\"You had better have breeches,\" he said. \"It is likely you will have to\nride, and knickerbockers look baggy.\"\n\nThis done, they went to Shepherd's Hotel.\n\n\"Sit down in the verandah,\" Captain Ewart said, \"until I get rid of my\nregimentals. Even a khaki tunic is not an admirable garment, when one\nwants to be cool and comfortable.\"\n\nIn a few minutes he came down again, in a light tweed suit; and,\nseating himself in another lounging chair, two cooling drinks were\nbrought in; then he said:\n\n\"Now we will talk about your outfit, and what you had best take up. Of\ncourse, you have got light underclothing, so you need not bother about\nthat. You want ankle boots--and high ones--to keep out the sand. You\nhad better take a couple of pairs of slippers, they are of immense\ncomfort at the end of the day; also a light cap, to slip on when you\nare going from one tent to another, after dark. A helmet is a good\nthing in many ways, but it is cumbrous; and if there are four or five\nmen in a tent, and they all take off their helmets, it is difficult to\nknow where to stow them away.\n\n\"Most likely you will get a tent at Dongola, but you can't always\nreckon upon that, and you may find it very useful to have a light tente\nd'abri made. It should have a fly, which is useful in two ways. In the\nfirst place, it adds to the height and so enlarges the space inside;\nand in the next place, you can tie it up in the daytime, and allow\nwhatever air there is to pass through. Then, with a blanket thrown over\nthe top, you will find it cooler than a regimental tent.\n\n\"Of course, you will want a sword and a revolver, with a case and belt.\nGet the regulation size, and a hundred rounds of cartridges; you are\nnot likely ever to use a quarter of that number, but they will come in\nfor practice.\n\n\"Now, as to food. Of course you get beef, biscuit, or bread, and there\nis a certain amount of tea, but nothing like enough for a thirsty\nclimate, especially when--which is sometimes the case--the water is so\nbad that it is not safe to drink, unless it has been boiled; so you had\nbetter take up four or five pounds of tea.\"\n\n\"I don't take sugar, sir.\"\n\n\"All the better. There is no better drink than tea, poured out and left\nto cool, and drunk without sugar. You might take a dozen tins of\npreserved milk, as many of condensed cocoa and milk, and a couple of\ndozen pots of jam. Of course, you could not take all these things on if\nyou were likely to move, but you may be at Dongola some time, before\nthere is another advance, and you may as well make yourself as\ncomfortable as you can; and if, as is probable, you cannot take the\npots up with you, you can hand them over to those who are left behind.\nYou will have no trouble in getting a fair-sized case taken up, as\nthere will be water carriage nearly all the way.\n\n\"A good many fellows have aerated waters sent up, but hot soda water is\nby no means a desirable drink--not to be compared with tea kept in\nporous jars; so I should not advise you to bother about it. You will\nwant a water bottle. Get the largest you can find. It is astonishing\nhow much water a fellow can get down, in a long day's march.\n\n\"Oh! As to your boots, get the uppers as light as you can--the lighter\nthe better; but you must have strong soles--there are rocks in some\nplaces, and they cut the soles to pieces, in no time. The sand is bad\nenough. Your foot sinks in it, and it seems to have a sort of sucking\naction, and very often takes the sole right off in a very short time.\n\n\"I suppose you smoke?\"\n\n\"Cigarettes, sir.\"\n\n\"I should advise you to get a pipe, in addition, or rather two or three\nof them. If they get broken, or lost in the sand, there is no replacing\nthem; and if you don't take to them, yourself, you will find them the\nmost welcome present you can give, to a man who has lost his.\n\n\"I should advise you to get a lens. You don't want a valuable one, but\nthe larger the better, and the cheapest that you can buy; it will be\nquite as good as the best, to use as a burning glass. Matches are\nprecious things out there and, with a burning glass, you will only have\nto draw upon your stock in the evening.\n\n\"Now, do you ride? Because all the white officers with the Egyptian\ntroops do so.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say that I don't, sir. I have ridden donkeys, but anyone\ncan sit upon a donkey.\"\n\n\"Yes; that won't help you much. Then I should advise you to use all the\ntime that you can spare, after ordering your outfit, in riding. No\ndoubt you could hire a horse.\"\n\n\"Yes; there is no difficulty about that.\"\n\n\"Well, if you will hire one, and come round here at six o'clock\ntomorrow morning, I will ride out for a couple of hours with you, and\ngive you your first lesson. I can borrow a horse from one of the staff.\nIf you once get to sit your horse, in a workman-like fashion, and to\ncarry yourself well, you will soon pick up the rest; and if you go out,\nmorning and evening, for three hours each time, you won't be quite\nabroad, when you start to keep up with a column of men on foot.\n\n\"As to a horse, it would be hardly worth your while to bother about\ntaking one with you. You will be able to pick one up at Dongola. I hear\nthat fugitives are constantly coming in there, and some of them are\nsure to be mounted. However, you had better take up a saddle and bridle\nwith you. You might as well get an Egyptian one; in the first place\nbecause it is a good deal cheaper, and in the second because our\nEnglish saddles are made for bigger horses. You need not mind much\nabout the appearance of your animal. Anything will do for riding about\nat Dongola, and learning to keep your seat. In the first fight you have\nwith Dervish horsemen, there are sure to be some riderless horses, and\nyou may then get a good one, for a pound or two, from some Tommy who\nhas captured one.\"\n\n\"I am sure I am immensely obliged to you, Captain Ewart. That will\nindeed be an advantage to me.\"\n\nOn leaving the hotel Gregory at once made all his purchases, so as to\nget them off his mind; and then arranged for the horse in the morning.\nThen he went home, and told the old servant the change that had taken\nplace in his position.\n\n\"And now, what about yourself, what would you like to do?\"\n\n\"I am too old to go up with you, and cook for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" he laughed; \"we shall be doing long marches. But it is\nnot your age, so much. As an officer, it would be impossible for me to\nhave a female servant. Besides, you want quiet and rest. I have been\nround to the landlord, to tell him that I am going away, and to pay him\na month's rent, instead of notice. I should think the best way would be\nfor you to take a large room for yourself, or two rooms not so\nlarge--one of them for you to live in, and the other to store\neverything there is here. I know that you will look after them, and\nkeep them well. Of course, you will pick out all the things that you\ncan use in your room. It will be very lonely for you, living all by\nyourself, but you know numbers of people here; and you might engage a\ngirl to stay with you, for some small wages and her food. Now, you must\nthink over what your food and hers will cost, and the rent. Of course,\nI want you to live comfortably; you have always been a friend rather\nthan a servant, and my mother had the greatest trust in you.\"\n\n\"You are very good, Master Gregory. While you have been away, today, I\nhave been thinking over what I should do, when you went away. I have a\nfriend who comes in, once a week, with fruit and vegetables. Last year,\nyou know, I went out with her and stayed a day. She has two boys who\nwork in the garden, and a girl. She came in today, and I said to her:\n\n\"'My young master is going away to the Soudan. What do you say to my\ncoming and living with you, when he has gone? I can cook, and do all\nabout the house, and help a little in the garden; and I have saved\nenough money to pay for my share of food.'\n\n\"She said, 'I should like that, very well. You could help the boys, in\nthe field.'\n\n\"So we agreed that, if you were willing, I should go. I thought of the\nfurniture; but if you do not come back here to live, it would be no use\nto keep the chairs, and tables, and beds, and things. We can put all\nMissy's things, and everything you like to keep, into a great box, and\nI could take them with me; or you could have them placed with some\nhonest man, who would only charge very little, for storage.\"\n\n\"Well, I do think that would be a good plan, if you like these people.\nIt would be far better than living by yourself. However, of course I\nshall pay for your board, and I shall leave money with you; so that, if\nyou are not comfortable there, you can do as I said, take a room here.\n\n\"I think you are right about the furniture. How would you sell it?\"\n\n\"There are plenty of Greek shops. They would buy it all. They would not\ngive as much as you gave for it. Most of them are great rascals.\"\n\n\"We cannot help that,\" he said. \"I should have to sell them when I come\nback and, at any rate, we save the rent for housing them. They are not\nworth much. You may take anything you like, a comfortable chair and a\nbed, some cooking things, and so on, and sell the rest for anything you\ncan get, after I have gone. I will pack my dear mother's things, this\nevening.\"\n\nFor the next two days, Gregory almost lived on horseback; arranging,\nwith the man from whom he hired the animals, that he should change them\nthree times a day. He laid aside his black clothes, and took to a white\nflannel suit, with a black ribbon round his straw hat; as deep mourning\nwould be terribly hot, and altogether unsuited for riding.\n\n\"You will do, lad,\" Captain Ewart said to him, after giving him his\nfirst lesson. \"Your fencing has done much for you, and has given you an\neasy poise of body and head. Always remember that it is upon balancing\nthe body that you should depend for your seat; although, of course, the\ngrip of the knees does a good deal. Also remember, always, to keep your\nfeet straight; nothing is so awkward as turned-out toes. Besides, in\nthat position, if the horse starts you are very likely to dig your\nspurs into him.\n\n\"Hold the reins firmly, but don't pull at his head. Give him enough\nscope to toss his head if he wants to, but be in readiness to tighten\nthe reins in an instant, if necessary.\"\n\nEach day, Gregory returned home so stiff, and tired, that he could\nscarcely crawl along. Still, he felt that he had made a good deal of\nprogress; and that, when he got up to Dongola, he would be able to\nmount and ride out without exciting derision. On the morning of the day\non which he was to start, he went to say goodbye to Mr. Murray.\n\n\"Have you everything ready, Hilliard?\" the banker asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir. The uniform and the tent are both ready. I have a cork bed,\nand waterproof sheet to lay under it; and, I think, everything that I\ncan possibly require. I am to meet Captain Ewart at the railway, this\nafternoon at five o'clock. The train starts at half past.\n\n\"I will draw another twenty-five pounds, sir. I have not spent more\nthan half what I had, but I must leave some money with our old servant.\nI shall have to buy a horse, too, when I get up to Dongola, and I may\nhave other expenses, that I cannot foresee.\"\n\n\"I think that is a wise plan,\" the banker said. \"It is always well to\nhave money with you, for no one can say what may happen. Your horse may\nget shot or founder, and you may have to buy another. Well, I wish you\nevery luck, lad, and a safe return.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, Mr. Murray! All this good fortune has come to me,\nentirely through your kindness. I cannot say how grateful I feel to\nyou.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Southward.\n\n\nAt the hour named, Gregory met Captain Ewart at the station. He was now\ndressed in uniform, and carried a revolver in his waist belt, and a\nsword in its case. His luggage was not extensive. He had one large\nbundle; it contained a roll-up cork bed, in a waterproof casing. At one\nend was a loose bag; which contained a spare suit of clothes, three\nflannel shirts, and his underclothing. This formed the pillow. A\nblanket and a waterproof sheet were rolled up with it. In a small sack\nwas the tente d'abri, made of waterproof sheeting, with its two little\npoles. It only weighed some fifteen pounds. His only other luggage\nconsisted of a large case, with six bottles of brandy, and the\nprovisions he had been recommended to take.\n\n\"Is that all your kit?\" Captain Ewart said, as he joined him.\n\n\"Yes, sir. I hope you don't think it is too much.\"\n\n\"No; I think it is very moderate, though if you move forward, you will\nnot be able to take the case with you, The others are light enough, and\nyou can always get a native boy to carry them. Of course, you have your\npass?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I received it yesterday, when I went to headquarters for the\nletter to General Hunter.\"\n\n\"Then we may as well take our places, at once. We have nearly an hour\nbefore the train starts; but it is worth waiting, in order to get two\nseats next the window, on the river side. We need not sit there till\nthe train starts, if we put our traps in to keep our places. I know\nfour or five other officers coming up, so we will spread our things\nabout, and keep the whole carriage to ourselves, if we can.\"\n\nIn an hour, the train started. Every place was occupied. Ewart had\nspoken to his friends, as they arrived, and they had all taken places\nin the same compartment. The journey lasted forty hours, and Gregory\nadmitted that the description Captain Ewart had given him, of the dust,\nwas by no means exaggerated. He had brought, as had been suggested, a\nwater skin and a porous earthenware bottle; together with a roll of\ncotton-wool to serve as a stopper to the latter, to keep out the dust.\nIn a tightly fitting handbag he had an ample supply of food for three\ndays. Along the opening of this he had pasted a strip of paper.\n\n\"That will do very well for your first meal, Hilliard, but it will be\nof no good afterwards.\"\n\n\"I have prepared for that,\" Gregory said. \"I have bought a gum bottle,\nand as I have a newspaper in my pocket, I can seal it up after each\nmeal.\"\n\n\"By Jove, that is a good idea, one I never thought of!\"\n\n\"The gum will be quite sufficient for us all, up to Assouan. I have two\nmore bottles in my box. That should be sufficient to last me for a long\ntime, when I am in the desert; and as it won't take half a minute to\nput a fresh paper on, after each meal, I shall have the satisfaction of\neating my food without its being mixed with the dust.\"\n\nThere was a general chorus of approval, and all declared that they\nwould search every shop in Assouan, and endeavour to find gum.\n\n\"Paste will do as well,\" Ewart said, \"and as we can always get flour,\nwe shall be able to defy the dust fiend as far as our food goes.\n\n\"I certainly did not expect that old campaigners would learn a lesson\nfrom you, Hilliard, as soon as you started.\"\n\n\"It was just an idea that occurred to me,\" Gregory said.\n\nThe gum bottle was handed round, and although nothing could be done for\nthose who had brought their provisions in hampers, three of them who\nhad, like Gregory, put their food in bags, were able to seal them up\ntightly.\n\nIt was now May, and the heat was becoming intolerable, especially as\nthe windows were closed to keep out the dust. In spite of this,\nhowever, it found its way in. It settled everywhere. Clothes and hair\nbecame white with it. It worked its way down the neck, where the\nperspiration changed it into mud. It covered the face, as if with a\ncake of flour.\n\nAt first Gregory attempted to brush it off his clothes, as it settled\nupon them, but he soon found that there was no advantage in this. So he\nsat quietly in his corner and, like the rest, looked like a dirty white\nstatue. There were occasional stops, when they all got out, shook\nthemselves, and took a few mouthfuls of fresh air.\n\nGregory's plan, for keeping out the dust from the food, turned out a\ngreat success; and the meals were eaten in the open air, during the\nstoppages.\n\nOn arriving at Assouan, they all went to the transport department, to\nget their passes for the journey up the Nile, as far as Wady Halfa. The\nnext step was to go down to the river for a swim and, by dint of\nshaking and beating, to get rid of the accumulated dust.\n\nAssouan was not a pleasant place to linger in and, as soon as they had\ncompleted their purchases, Captain Ewart and Gregory climbed on to the\nloaded railway train, and were carried by the short line to the spot\nwhere, above the cataract, the steamer that was to carry them was\nlying. She was to tow up a large barge, and two native craft. They took\ntheir places in the steamer, with a number of other officers--some\nnewcomers from England, others men who had been down to Cairo, to\nrecruit. They belonged to all branches of the service, and included\nhalf a dozen of the medical staff, three of the transport corps,\ngunners, engineers, cavalry, and infantry. The barges were deep in the\nwater, with their cargoes of stores of all kinds, and rails and\nsleepers for the railway, and the steamer was also deeply loaded.\n\nThe passage was a delightful one, to Gregory. Everything was new to\nhim. The cheery talk and jokes of the officers, the graver discussion\nof the work before them, the calculations as to time and distance, the\nstories told of what had taken place during the previous campaign, by\nthose who shared in it, were all so different from anything he had ever\nbefore experienced, that the hours passed almost unnoticed. It was\nglorious to think that, in whatever humble capacity, he was yet one of\nthe band who were on their way up to meet the hordes of the Khalifa, to\nrescue the Soudan from the tyranny under which it had groaned, to\navenge Gordon and Hicks and the gallant men who had died with them!\n\nOccasionally, Captain Ewart came up and talked to him, but he was well\ncontent to sit on one of the bales, and listen to the conversation\nwithout joining in it. In another couple of years he, too, would have\nhad his experiences, and would be able to take his part. At present, he\npreferred to be a listener.\n\nThe distance to Wady Halfa was some three hundred miles; but the\ncurrent was strong, and the steamer could not tow the boats more than\nfive miles an hour, against it. It was sixty hours, from the start,\nbefore they arrived.\n\nGregory was astonished at the stir and life in the place. Great numbers\nof native labourers were at work, unloading barges and native craft;\nand a line of railway ran down to the wharves, where the work of\nloading the trucks went on briskly. Smoke pouring out from many\nchimneys, and the clang of hammers, told that the railway engineering\nwork was in full swing. Vast piles of boxes, cases, and bales were\naccumulated on the wharf, and showed that there would be no loss of\ntime in pushing forward supplies to Abu Hamed, as soon as the railway\nwas completed to that point.\n\nWady Halfa had been the starting point of a railway, commenced years\nbefore. A few miles have been constructed, and several buildings\nerected for the functionaries, military and civil; but Gordon, when\nGovernor of the Soudan, had refused to allow the province to be saddled\nwith the expenses of the construction, or to undertake the\nresponsibility of carrying it out.\n\nIn 1884 there was some renewal of work and, had Gordon been rescued,\nand Khartoum permanently occupied, the line would no doubt have been\ncarried on; but with the retirement of the British troops, work ceased,\nand the great stores of material that had been gathered there remained,\nfor years, half covered with the sand. In any other climate this would\nhave been destructive, but in the dry air of Upper Egypt they remained\nalmost uninjured, and proved very useful, when the work was again taken\nup.\n\nIt was a wonderful undertaking, for along the two hundred and\nthirty-four miles of desert, food, water, and every necessary had to be\ncarried, together with all materials for its construction. Not only had\nan army of workmen to be fed, but a body of troops to guard them; for\nAbu Hamed, at the other end of the line, for which they were making,\nwas occupied by a large body of Dervishes; who might, at any moment,\nswoop down across the plain.\n\nHad the Sirdar had the resources of England at his back, the work would\nhave been easier, for he could have ordered from home new engines, and\nplant of every description; but it was an Egyptian work, and had to be\ndone in the cheapest possible way. Old engines had to be patched up,\nand makeshifts of all kinds employed. Fortunately he had, in the chief\nengineer of the line, a man whose energy, determination, and resource\nwere equal to his own. Major Girouard was a young officer of the Royal\nEngineers and, like all white officers in the Egyptian service, held\nthe rank of major. He was a Canadian by birth, and proved, in every\nrespect, equal to the onerous and responsible work to which he was\nappointed.\n\nHowever, labour was cheap, and railway battalions were raised among the\nEgyptian peasants, their pay being the same as that of the soldiers.\nStrong, hearty, and accustomed to labour and a scanty diet, no men\ncould have been more fitted for the work. They preferred it to\nsoldiering; for although, as they had already shown, and were still\nfurther to prove, the Egyptian can fight, and fight bravely; he is, by\nnature, peaceable, and prefers work, however hard. In addition to these\nbattalions, natives of the country and of the Soudan, fugitives from\nruined villages and desolated plains, were largely employed.\n\nThe line had now been carried three-quarters of the distance to Abu\nHamed, which was still in the hands of the Dervishes. It had been\nconstructed with extraordinary rapidity, for the ground was so level\nthat only occasional cuttings were needed. The organization of labour\nwas perfect. The men were divided into gangs, each under a head man,\nand each having its own special work to do. There were the men who\nunloaded the trucks, the labourers who did the earth work, and the more\nskilled hands who levelled it. As fast as the trucks were emptied,\ngangs of men carried the sleepers forward, and laid them down roughly\nin position; others followed, and corrected the distance between each.\nThe rails were then brought along and laid down, with the fish plates,\nin the proper places; men put these on, and boys screwed up the nuts.\nThen plate layers followed and lined the rails accurately; and, when\nthis was done, sand was thrown in and packed down between the sleepers.\n\nBy this division of labour, the line was pushed on from one to two\nmiles a day, the camp moving forward with the line. Six tank trucks\nbrought up the water for the use of the labourers, daily, and\neverything worked with as much regularity as in a great factory at\nhome. Troops of friendly tribesmen, in our pay, scoured the country and\nwatched the wells along the road, farther to the east, so as to prevent\nany bands of Dervishes from dashing suddenly down upon the workers.\n\nAt Wady Halfa, Captain Ewart and two or three other officers left the\nsteamer, to proceed up the line. Gregory was very sorry to lose him.\n\n\"I cannot tell you, Captain Ewart,\" he said, \"how deeply grateful I\nfeel to you, for the immense kindness you have shown me. I don't know\nwhat I should have done, had I been left without your advice and\nassistance in getting my outfit, and making my arrangements to come up\nhere.\"\n\n\"My dear lad,\" the latter said, \"don't say anything more. In any case,\nI should naturally be glad to do what I could, for the son of a man who\ndied fighting in the same cause as we are now engaged in. But in your\ncase it has been a pleasure, for I am sure you will do credit to\nyourself, and to the mother who has taken such pains in preparing you\nfor the work you are going to do, and in fitting you for the position\nthat you now occupy.\"\n\nAs the officers who had come up with them in the train from Cairo were\nall going on, and had been told by Ewart something of Gregory's story,\nthey had aided that officer in making Gregory feel at home in his new\ncircumstances; and in the two days they had been on board the boat, he\nhad made the acquaintance of several others.\n\nThe river railway had now been carried from Wady Halfa to Kerma, above\nthe third cataract. The heavy stores were towed up by steamers and\nnative craft. Most of the engines and trucks had been transferred to\nthe desert line; but a few were still retained, to carry up troops if\nnecessary, and aid the craft in accumulating stores.\n\nOne of these trains started a few hours after the arrival of the\nsteamer at Wady Halfa. Gregory, with the officers going up, occupied\ntwo horse boxes. Several of them had been engaged in the last campaign,\nand pointed out the places of interest.\n\nAt Sarras, some thirty miles up the road, there had been a fight on the\n29th of April, 1887; when the Dervish host, advancing strong in the\nbelief that they could carry all before them down to the sea, were\ndefeated by the Egyptian force under the Sirdar and General Chermside.\n\nThe next stop of the train was at Akasheh. This had been a very\nimportant station, before the last advance, as all the stores had been\naccumulated here when the army advanced. Here had been a strongly\nentrenched camp, for the Dervishes were in force, fifteen miles away,\nat Ferket.\n\n\"It was a busy time we had here,\" said one of the officers, who had\ntaken a part in the expedition. \"A fortnight before, we had no idea\nthat an early move was contemplated; and indeed, it was only on the\n14th of March that the excitement began. That day, Kitchener received a\ntelegram ordering an immediate advance on Dongola. We had expected it\nwould take place soon; but there is no doubt that the sudden order was\nthe result of an arrangement, on the part of our government with Italy,\nthat we should relieve her from the pressure of the Dervishes round\nKassala by effecting a diversion, and obliging the enemy to send a\nlarge force down to Dongola to resist our advance.\n\n\"It was a busy time. The Sirdar came up to Wady Halfa, and the Egyptian\ntroops were divided between that place, Sarras, and Akasheh. The 9th\nSoudanese were marched up from Suakim, and they did the distance to the\nNile (one hundred and twenty miles) in four days. That was something\nlike marching.\n\n\"Well, you saw Wady Halfa. For a month, this place was quite as busy.\nNow, its glories are gone. Two or three huts for the railway men, and\nthe shelters for a company of Egyptians, represent the whole camp.\"\n\nAs they neared Ferket the officer said:\n\n\"There was a sharp fight out there on the desert. A large body of\nDervishes advanced, from Ferket. They were seen to leave by a cavalry\npatrol. As soon as the patrol reached camp, all the available horse,\ntwo hundred and forty in number, started under Major Murdoch. Four\nmiles out, they came in sight of three hundred mounted Dervishes, with\na thousand spearmen on foot.\n\n\"The ground was rough, and unfavourable for a cavalry charge; so the\ncavalry retired to a valley, between two hills, in order to get better\nground. While they were doing so, however, the Dervishes charged down\nupon them. Murdoch rode at them at once, and there was a hand-to-hand\nfight that lasted for twenty minutes. Then the enemy turned, and\ngalloped off to the shelter of the spearmen. The troopers dismounted\nand opened fire; and, on a regiment of Soudanese coming up, the enemy\ndrew off.\n\n\"Eighteen of the Dervishes were killed, and eighty wounded. Our loss\nwas very slight; but the fight was a most satisfactory one, for it\nshowed that the Egyptian cavalry had, now, sufficient confidence in\nthemselves to face the Baggara.\n\n\"Headquarters came up to Akasheh on the 1st of June. The spies had kept\nthe Intelligence Department well informed as to the state of things at\nFerket. It was known that three thousand troops were there, led by\nfifty-seven Emirs. The ground was carefully reconnoitred, and all\npreparation made for an attack. It was certain that the Dervishes also\nhad spies, among the camel drivers and camp followers, but the Sirdar\nkept his intentions secret, and on the evening of June 5th it was not\nknown to any, save three or four of the principal officers, that he\nintended to attack on the following morning. It was because he was\nanxious to effect a complete surprise that he did not even bring up the\nNorth Staffordshires.\n\n\"There were two roads to Ferket--one by the river, the other through\nthe desert. The river column was the strongest, and consisted of an\ninfantry division, with two field batteries and two Maxims. The total\nstrength of the desert column, consisting of the cavalry brigade, camel\ncorps, a regiment of infantry, a battery of horse artillery, and two\nMaxims--in all, two thousand one hundred men--were to make a detour,\nand come down upon the Nile to the south of Ferket, thereby cutting off\nthe retreat of the enemy.\n\n\"Carrying two days' rations, the troops started late in the afternoon\nof the 6th, and halted at nine in the evening, three miles from Ferket.\nAt half-past two they moved forward again, marching quietly and\nsilently; and, at half-past four, deployed into line close to the\nenemy's position. A few minutes later the alarm was given; and the\nDervishes, leaping to arms, discovered this formidable force in front\nof them; and at the same time found that their retreat was cut off, by\nanother large body of troops in their rear; while, on the opposite bank\nof the river, was a force of our Arab allies.\n\n\"Though they must have seen that their position was hopeless, the\nDervishes showed no signs of fear. They fought with the desperation of\nrats in a trap. The Egyptians advanced with steady volleys. The Baggara\nhorsemen attacked them furiously, but were repulsed with heavy loss.\nThere was hand-to-hand fighting among their huts; and the second\nbrigade carried, with the bayonet, that rough hill that you see over\nthere.\n\n\"It was all over, by seven o'clock. Our loss was only twenty killed,\nand eighty wounded. About one thousand of the Dervishes were killed,\nincluding their chief Emir and some forty of the others, while five\nhundred were taken prisoners. It was a great victory, and a very\nimportant one; but it can hardly be said that it was glorious, as we\noutnumbered them by three to one. Still, it was a heavy blow to the\nDervishes, and the fact that the Khalifa was obliged to send troops\ndown to the Nile, to check an advance that had proved so formidable,\nmust have greatly relieved the pressure on the Italians at Kassala.\n\n\"There was a pause, here. It was certain that we should have to meet a\nmuch stronger force before we got to Dongola. Well as the Egyptian\ntroops had fought, it was thought advisable to give them a stronger\nbacking.\n\n\"The heat was now tremendous, and cholera had broken out. We moved to\nKoshyeh, and there encamped. The only change we had was a terrific\nstorm, which almost washed us away. In the middle of August, we managed\nto get the gunboats up through the cataract, and were in hopes of\nadvancing, when another storm carried away twenty miles of the railway,\nwhich by this time had come up as far as the cataract.\"\n\nAt Ginnis, twenty miles from Ferket, they passed the ground where, on\nthe 31st of December, 1885, on the retirement of General Wolseley's\nexpedition, Generals Grenfel and Stevenson, with a force of Egyptian\ntroops and three British regiments, encountered the Dervish army which\nthe Khalifa had despatched under the Emir Nejumi, and defeated it. It\nwas notable as being the first battle in which the newly raised\nEgyptian army met the Mahdists, and showed that, trained and\ndisciplined by British officers, the Egyptian fellah was capable of\nstanding against the Dervish of the desert.\n\nFrom this point the railway left the Nile and, for thirty miles,\ncrossed the desert. Another twenty miles, and they reached Fareeg.\n\n\"It was here,\" the officer said, \"that the North Staffordshires came up\nand joined the Egyptians. The Dervishes had fallen back before we\nadvanced, after a halt at Sadeah, which we sha'n't see, as the railway\ncuts across, to Abu Fetmeh. We bivouacked five miles from their camp,\nand turned out at three next morning. The orders were passed by mouth,\nand we got off as silently as an army of ghosts.\n\n\"I shall never forget our disgust when a small cavalry force, sent on\nahead to reconnoitre, reported that the Dervishes had abandoned the\nplace during the night, and had crossed the river in native boats. It\nwas a very clever move, at any rate, on the part of fellows who did not\nwant to fight. There were we facing them, with our whole infantry and\ncavalry useless, and we had nothing available to damage the enemy\nexcept our artillery and the gunboats.\n\n\"These opened fire, and the Dervishes replied heavily. They had\nearthworks, but the boats kept on, pluckily, till they got to a narrow\npoint in the stream; when a couple of guns, which had hitherto been\nhidden, opened upon them at close range; while a strong force of\nDervish infantry poured in such a hot fire that the boats had to fall\nback.\n\n\"After our field guns had peppered the enemy for a bit, the gunboats\ntried again, but the fire was too hot for them, and the leading boat\nhad to retire.\n\n\"Things did not look very bright, till nine o'clock; when we found\nthat, at one point, the river was fordable to a small island, opposite\nthe enemy's lines. Four batteries, and the Maxims, at once moved over,\nwith two companies of Soudanese, and opened fire. The distance across\nwas but six hundred yards, and the fire was tremendous--shell,\nshrapnel, and rockets--while the Soudanese fired volleys, and the\nMaxims maintained a shower of bullets.\n\n\"It seemed that nothing could stand against it, but the Dervishes stuck\nto their guns with great pluck. However, their fire was so far kept\ndown, that the three gunboats succeeded in forcing their way up; and,\npassing the Dervish works, sank a steamer and a number of native boats.\n\n\"The Dervishes now began to give way, and the gunboats steamed up the\nriver, making for Dongola. The Dervishes, as soon as they had gone,\nreopened fire, and the duel continued all day; but the great mass of\nthe enemy soon left, and also made their way towards Dongola.\n\n\"It was awfully annoying being obliged to remain inactive, on our side,\nand it was especially hard for the cavalry; who, if they could have got\nover, would have been able to cut up and disperse the enemy.\n\n\"The next morning the Dervishes were all gone, and that was practically\nthe end of the fighting. The gunboats went up and shelled Dongola; and\nwhen we got there, two days later, the Dervishes had had enough of it.\nOf course, there was a little fighting, but it was the effort of a\nparty of fanatics, rather than of an enemy who considered resistance\npossible.\n\n\"We were greeted with enthusiasm by the unfortunate inhabitants, who\nhad been subject to the Dervish tyranny. As a whole, however, they had\nnot been badly treated here, and had been allowed to continue to\ncultivate their land, subject only to about the same taxation as they\nhad paid to Egypt. Of course, from what they have done elsewhere, the\ncomparative mildness of the conduct of the Dervishes was not due to any\nfeeling of mercy, but to policy. As the most advanced position, with\nthe exception of scattered and temporary posts lower down the river, it\nwas necessary that there should be food for the considerable body of\ntribesmen encamped at Dongola; especially as an army invading Egypt\nwould provide itself, there, with stores for the journey. It was\ntherefore good policy to encourage the cultivators of land to stay\nthere.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much!\" Gregory said, when the officer had concluded his\nsketch of the previous campaign. \"Of course, I heard that we had beaten\nthe Khalifa's men, and had taken Dongola, but the papers at Cairo gave\nno details. The Staffordshire regiment went down, directly the place\nwas taken, did they not?\"\n\n\"Yes. They had suffered heavily from cholera; and as there was now no\nfear that the Egyptians and Soudanese would prove unequal to\nwithstanding a Dervish rush, there was no necessity for keeping them\nhere.\"\n\nAt Abu Fetmeh they left the train, and embarked in a steamer. Of the\nparty that had left Assouan, only four or five remained. The rest had\nbeen dropped at other stations on the road.\n\nThe boat stopped but a few hours at Dongola, which had for a time been\nthe headquarters of the advanced force. Great changes had been made,\nsince the place was captured from the Dervishes. At that time the\npopulation had been reduced to a handful, and the natives who remained\ntilled but enough ground for their own necessities; for they knew that,\nat any time, a Dervish force might come along and sweep everything\nclear. But with the advent of the British, the fugitives who had\nscattered among the villages along the river soon poured in.\n\nNumbers of Greek traders arrived, with camels and goods, and the town\nassumed an aspect of life and business. The General established a court\nof justice, and appointed authorities for the proper regulation of\naffairs; and by the time Gregory came up, the town was showing signs of\nrenewed prosperity.\n\nBut the steamer stopped at Dongola only to land stores needed for the\nregiment stationed there. The headquarters had, months before, been\nmoved to Merawi, some eighty miles higher up, situated at the foot of\nthe fourth cataract.\n\nAlthough he had enjoyed the journey, Gregory was glad when the steamer\ndrew up against a newly constructed wharf at Merawi. Now he was to\nbegin his duties, whatever they might be.\n\nAt the wharf were a large number of Soudanese soldiers. A telegram,\nfrom the last station they touched at, had given notice of the hour at\nwhich the boat would arrive; and a battalion of native troops had\nmarched down, to assist in unloading the stores. A white officer had\ncome down with them, to superintend the operation, and the other\nofficers at once went on shore to speak to him.\n\nGregory had got all his traps together and, as the Soudanese poured on\nboard, he thought it better to remain with them; as, if his belongings\nonce got scattered, there would be little chance of his being able to\ncollect them again. After a short time, he went up to one of the native\nofficers.\n\n\"This is my first visit here,\" he said in Arabic, \"and as I have not\nbrought up a servant with me, I do not like to leave my baggage here,\nwhile I go and report myself to General Hunter. Will you kindly tell me\nwhat I had better do?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I will place one of my corporals in charge of your things.\nIt would be as well to get them ashore at once, as we shall want the\ndecks clear, in order that the men may work freely in getting the\nstores up from below. The corporal will see that your baggage is\ncarried to the bank, to a spot where it will be out of the way, and\nwill remain with it until you know where it is to be taken.\"\n\nThanking him for his civility, Gregory went on shore. The officer who\nhad told him the story of the campaign was still talking, to the Major\nwho had come down with the blacks. As Gregory came up, he said:\n\n\"I wondered what had become of you, Hilliard. I have been telling Major\nSidney that a young lieutenant had come up, to report himself to the\nGeneral for service.\"\n\n\"I am glad to see you, sir,\" the Major said, holding out his hand.\n\"Every additional white officer is a material gain, and I have no doubt\nthat General Hunter will find plenty for you to do. I hear you can\nspeak the Negro language, as well as Arabic. That will be specially\nuseful here, for the natives are principally Negro, and speak very\nlittle Arabic.\n\n\"How about your baggage?\"\n\n\"One of the native officers has undertaken to get it ashore, and to put\na corporal in charge of it, until I know where it is to go.\"\n\n\"Well, Fladgate, as you are going to the General's, perhaps you will\ntake Mr. Hilliard with you, and introduce him.\"\n\n\"With pleasure.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Hilliard, let us be off, at once. The sun is getting hot, and\nthe sooner we are under shelter, the better.\"\n\nTen minutes' walk took them to the house formerly occupied by the\nEgyptian Governor of the town, where General Hunter now had his\nheadquarters. The General, who was a brevet colonel in the British\nArmy, had joined the Egyptian Army in 1888. He had, as a captain in the\nLancashire regiment, taken part in the Nile Expedition, 1884-85; had\nbeen severely wounded at the battle of Ginnis; and again at Toski,\nwhere he commanded a brigade. He was still a comparatively young man.\nHe had a broad forehead, and an intellectual face, that might have\nbetokened a student rather than a soldier; but he was celebrated, in\nthe army, for his personal courage and disregard of danger, and was\nadored by his black soldiers.\n\nHe rose from the table at which he was sitting, as Captain Fladgate\ncame in.\n\n\"I am glad to see you back again,\" he said. \"I hope you have quite\nshaken off the fever?\"\n\n\"Quite, General. I feel thoroughly fit for work again. Allow me to\npresent to you Mr. Hilliard, who has just received a commission as\nlieutenant in the Egyptian Army. He has a letter from the Sirdar, to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well, I will not detain you now, Captain Fladgate. You will find your\nformer quarters in readiness for you. Dinner at the usual time; then\nyou shall tell me the news of Cairo.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Hilliard,\" and he turned to Gregory, \"pray take a seat. This\nis your first experience in soldiering, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I think you are the first white officer who has been appointed, who\nhas not had experience in our own army first. You have not been\nappointed to any particular battalion, have you?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I think I have come out to make myself generally useful.\nThese are the letters that I was to hand to you--one is from the Sirdar\nhimself, the other is from his chief of the staff, and this letter is\nfrom Captain Ewart.\"\n\nThe General read the Sirdar's letter first. He then opened that from\nthe chief of the staff. This was the more bulky of the two, and\ncontained several enclosures.\n\n\"Ah! this relates to you,\" the General said as, after glancing over the\ntwo official despatches, he read through the letter of Captain Ewart,\nwho was a personal friend of his.\n\nThe latter had given a full account of Gregory's history, and said that\nthe Sirdar had especially asked him to put him in the way of things;\nthat he had seen a great deal of him on the journey up, and was very\ngreatly pleased with him.\n\n\"The lad is a perfect gentleman,\" he said, \"which is certainly\nastonishing, he being a product of Cairo. I consider him in all\nrespects--except, of course, a classical education--fully equal to the\naverage young officer, on first joining. He is very modest and\nunassuming; and will, I feel sure, perform with credit any work that\nyou may give him to do.\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said, laying it down, \"you have only joined the army\ntemporarily, and with a special purpose, and I am told to utilize your\nservices as I think best. You have a perfect knowledge of Arabic, and\nof the Negro dialect. That will be very useful, for though we all speak\nArabic, few speak the Negro language, which is more commonly used here.\n\n\"Your father fell with Hicks Pasha, I am told, and you have joined us\nwith the object of obtaining news as to the manner in which he met his\ndeath?\"\n\n\"That is so, sir. It was always my mother's wish that I should, when I\nwas old enough, come up to the Soudan to make enquiries. As my father\nwas a good Arabic scholar, my mother always entertained a faint hope\nthat he might have escaped; especially as we know that a good many of\nthe Egyptian soldiers were not killed, but were taken prisoners, and\nmade to serve in the Mahdi's army.\"\n\n\"Yes, there are several of them among the Khalifa's artillerymen, but I\nam very much afraid that none of the officers were spared. You see,\nthey kept together in a body, and died fighting to the last.\"\n\n\"I have hardly any hopes myself, sir. Still, as my father was\ninterpreter, he might not have been with the others, but in some other\npart of the square that was attacked.\"\n\n\"That is possible; but he was a white man, and in the heat of the\nbattle I don't think that the Dervishes would have made any exception.\nYou see, there were two correspondents with Hicks, and neither of them\nhas ever been heard of; and they must, I should think, have joined in\nthat last desperate charge of his.\n\n\"Well, for the present I must make you a sort of extra aide-de-camp,\nand what with one thing and another, I have no doubt that I shall find\nplenty for you to do. As such, you will of course be a member of\nheadquarters mess, and therefore escape the trouble of providing for\nyourself. You have not brought a servant up with you, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Captain Ewart, who most kindly advised me as to my outfit,\nsaid that, if I could find an intelligent native here, it would be\nbetter than taking a man from Cairo.\"\n\n\"Quite right; and the fellows one picks up at Cairo are generally lazy,\nand almost always dishonest. The men you get here may not know much,\nbut are ready enough to learn; and, if well treated, will go through\nfire and water for their master.\n\n\"Go down to the stores, and tell the officer in charge there that I\nshall be glad if he will pick out two or three fellows, from whom you\nmay choose a servant.\"\n\nWhen Gregory had given his message, the officer said:\n\n\"You had better pick out one for yourself, Mr. Hilliard. Strength and\nwillingness to work are the points I keep my eye upon; and, except for\nthe foremen of the gangs, their intelligence does not interest me. You\nhad better take a turn among the parties at work, and pick out a man\nfor yourself.\"\n\nGregory was not long in making his choice. He selected a young fellow\nwho, although evidently exerting himself to the utmost, was clearly\nincapable of doing his share in carrying the heavy bales and boxes,\nthat were easily handled by older men. He had a pleasant face, and\nlooked more intelligent than most of the others.\n\n\"To what tribe do you belong?\" Gregory asked him.\n\n\"The Jaalin. I come from near Metemmeh.\"\n\n\"I want a servant. You do not seem to be strong enough for this work,\nbut if you will be faithful, and do what I tell you, I will try you.\"\n\nThe young fellow's face lit up.\n\n\"I will be faithful, bey. It would be kind of you to take me. I am not\nat my full strength yet and, although I try my hardest, I cannot do as\nmuch as strong men, and then I am abused. I will be very faithful, and\nif you do not find me willing to do all that you tell me, you can send\nme back to work here.\"\n\n\"Well, come along with me, then.\"\n\nHe took him to the officer.\n\n\"I have chosen this man, sir. Can I take him away at once?\"\n\n\"Certainly. He has been paid up to last night.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much! I will settle with him for today.\"\n\nAnd, followed by the young tribesman, he went to the headquarters camp,\nnear which an empty hut was assigned to him.\n\n\n\nChapter 6: Gregory Volunteers.\n\n\nThe hut of which Gregory took possession was constructed of dry mud.\nThe roof was of poles, on which were thickly laid boughs and palm\nleaves; and on these a layer of clay, a foot thick. An opening in the\nwall, eighteen inches square, served as a window. Near the door the\nfloor was littered with rubbish of all kinds.\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Zaki.\"\n\n\"Well, Zaki, the first thing is to clear out all this rubbish, and\nsweep the floor as clean as you can. I am going down to the river to\nget my baggage up. Can you borrow a shovel, or something of that sort,\nfrom one of the natives here? Or, if he will sell it, buy one. I will\npay when I return. It will always come in useful. If you cannot get a\nshovel, a hoe will do. Ah! I had better give you a dollar, the man\nmight not trust you.\"\n\nHe then walked down to the river, and found the black corporal sitting\ntranquilly by the side of his baggage. The man stood up and saluted,\nand on Gregory saying that he had now a house, at once told off two\nsoldiers to carry the things.\n\nArriving at the hut, he found Zaki hard at work, shovelling the rubbish\nthrough the doorway. Just as he came up, the boy brought down his tool,\nwith a crash, upon a little brown creature that was scuttling away.\n\n\"What is that, Zaki?\"\n\n\"That is a scorpion, bey; I have killed four of them.\"\n\n\"That is not at all pleasant,\" Gregory said. \"There may be plenty of\nthem, up among the boughs overhead.\"\n\nZaki nodded.\n\n\"Plenty of creatures,\" he said, \"some snakes.\"\n\n\"Then we will smoke them out, before I go in. When you have got the\nrubbish out, make a fire in the middle, wet some leaves and things and\nput them on, and we will hang a blanket over the window and shut the\ndoor. I will moisten some powder and scatter it among the leaves, and\nthe sulphur will help the smoke to bring them down.\"\n\nThis was done, the door closed and, as it did not fit at all tightly,\nthe cracks were filled with some damp earth from the watercourse.\n\n\"What did you pay for the shovel, Zaki?\"\n\n\"Half a dollar, bey. Here is the other half.\"\n\n\"Well, you had better go and buy some things for yourself. Tomorrow I\nwill make other arrangements. Get a fire going out here. There is a\nsauce pan and a kettle, so you can boil some rice or fry some meat.\"\n\nGregory then went again to the officer who was acting as quartermaster.\n\n\"I have been speaking to the General,\" the latter said. \"You will mess\nwith the staff. The dinner hour is seven o'clock. I am sure you will\nsoon feel at home.\"\n\nGregory now strolled through the camp. The troops were in little mud\nhuts, of their own construction; as these, in the heat of the day, were\nmuch cooler than tents. The sun was getting low, and the Soudanese\ntroops were all occupied in cooking, mending their clothes, sweeping\nthe streets between the rows of huts, and other light duties. They\nseemed, to Gregory, as full of fun and life as a party of\nschoolboys--laughing, joking, and playing practical tricks on each\nother.\n\nThe physique of some of the regiments was splendid, the men averaging\nover six feet in height, and being splendidly built. Other regiments,\nrecruited among different tribes, were not so tall, but their sturdy\nfigures showed them to be capable of any effort they might be called\nupon to make.\n\nOne of the officers came out of his tent, as he passed.\n\n\"You are a new arrival, I think, sir?\" he said. \"We have so few white\nofficers, here, that one spots a fresh face at once.\"\n\n\"Yes, I only arrived two or three hours ago. My name is Hilliard. I am\nnot attached to any regiment; but, as I speak the languages well,\nGeneral Hunter is going, so he said, to make me generally useful. I\nonly received my commission a few days before leaving Cairo.\"\n\n\"Well, come in and have a soda and whisky. The heat out here is\nfrightful. You can tell me the last news from Cairo, and when we are\ngoing to move.\"\n\n\"I shall be happy to come in and have a chat,\" Gregory said, \"but I do\nnot drink anything. I have been brought up in Cairo, and am accustomed\nto heat, and I find that drinking only makes one more thirsty.\"\n\n\"I believe it does,\" the other said, \"especially when the liquid is\nalmost as hot as one is, one's self. Will you sit down on that box?\nChairs are luxuries that we do not indulge in here. Well, have you\nheard anything about a move?\"\n\n\"Nothing; but the officers I have spoken to all seem to think that it\nwill soon begin. A good many came up with me, to Wady Halfa and the\nstations on the river; and I heard that all who had sufficiently\nrecovered were under orders to rejoin, very shortly.\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose it won't be long. Of course we know nothing here, and I\ndon't expect we shall, till the order comes for us to start. This is\nnot the time of year when one expects to be on the move; and if we do\ngo, it is pretty certain that it is because Kitchener has made up his\nmind for a dash forward. You see, if we take Abu Hamed and drive the\nDervishes away, we can, at once, push the railway on to that place;\nand, as soon as it is done, the troops can be brought up and an advance\nmade to Berber, if not farther, during the cool season--if you can ever\ncall it a cool season, here.\"\n\n\"Is there any great force at Abu Hamed?\"\n\n\"No; nothing that could stand against this for a moment. Their chief\nforce, outside Omdurman, is at Metemmeh under Mahmud, the Khalifa's\nfavourite son. You see, the Jaalin made fools of themselves. Instead of\nwaiting until we could lend them a hand, they revolted as soon as we\ntook Dongola, and the result was that Mahmud came down and pretty well\nwiped them out. They defended themselves stoutly, at Metemmeh, but had\nno chance against such a host as he brought with him. The town was\ntaken, and its defenders, between two and three thousand fighting men,\nwere all massacred, together with most of the women and children.\n\n\"By the accounts brought down to us, by men who got away, it must have\nbeen an even more horrible business than usual; and the Dervishes are\npast masters in the art of massacre. However, I think that their course\nis nearly up. Of late, a good many fugitives from Kordofan have arrived\nhere, and they say that there will be a general revolt there, when they\nhear that we have given the Dervishes a heavy thrashing.\"\n\n\"And where do you think the great fight is likely to take place?\"\nGregory asked.\n\n\"Not this side of Metemmeh. Except at Abu Hamed, we hear of no other\nstrong Dervish force between this and Omdurman. If Mahmud thinks\nhimself strong enough, no doubt he will fight; but if he and the\nKhalifa know their business, he will fall back and, with the forces at\nOmdurman, fight one big battle. The two armies together will, from what\nwe hear, amount to sixty or seventy thousand; and there is no doubt\nwhatever that, with all their faults, the beggars can fight. It will be\na tough affair, but I believe we shall have some British troops here to\nhelp, before the final advance. We can depend now on both the Soudanese\nand the Egyptians to fight hard, but there are not enough of them. The\nodds would be too heavy, and the Sirdar is not a man to risk failure.\nBut with a couple of brigades of British infantry, there can be no\ndoubt what the result will be; and I fancy that, if we beat them in one\nbig fight, it will be all up with Mahdism.\n\n\"It is only because the poor beggars of tribesmen regard the Dervishes\nas invincible, that they have put up so long with their tyranny. But\nthe rising of the Jaalin, and the news we get from Kordofan, show that\nthe moment they hear the Dervishes are beaten, and Khartoum is in our\nhands, there will be a general rising, and the Dervishes will be pretty\nwell exterminated. We all hope that Mahmud won't fight, for if he does,\nand we beat him, the Khalifa and his lot may lose heart and retire\nbefore we get to Omdurman; and, once away, the tremendous business of\ntrying to follow him will confront us. Here we have got the river and\nthe railway, but we have no land carriage for an army, and he might\nkeep on falling back to the great lakes, for anything that we could do\nto overtake him. So we all hope that Mahmud will retire to Omdurman\nwithout fighting, and with such a host as the Khalifa would then have,\nhe would be certain to give battle before abandoning his capital.\"\n\n\"They are fine-looking fellows, these blacks,\" Gregory said.\n\n\"They are splendid fellows--they love fighting for fighting's sake. It\nis, in their opinion, the only worthy occupation for a man, and they\nhave shown themselves worthy to fight by the side of our men. They have\na perfect confidence in us, and would, I believe, go anywhere we led\nthem. They say themselves, 'We are never afraid--just like English.'\"\n\n\"There seem to be a good many women about the camps.\"\n\n\"Yes, their women follow them wherever they go. They cook for them, and\ngenerally look after them. They are as warlike as their husbands, and\nencourage them, when they go out to battle, with their applause and\ncurious quavering cries. The men get very little pay; but as they are\nprovided with rations, and draw a certain amount for the women, it\ncosts next to nothing, and I fancy that having the wives with them pays\nwell. I believe they would rather be killed than come back and face\ntheir reproaches.\n\n\"I could not wish to have more cheery or better fellows with me. They\nnever grumble, they are always merry, and really they seem to be\ntireless. They practically give no trouble whatever, and it is good to\nsee how they brighten up, when there is a chance of a fight.\"\n\n\"I hope I shall see them at it, before long,\" Gregory said. \"Now I must\nbe going, for I have to change, and put on my mess uniform before\ndinner. I am rather nervous about that, for I am not accustomed to dine\nwith generals.\"\n\n\"You will find it all very pleasant,\" the other said. \"Hunter is a\nsplendid fellow, and is adored by his men. His staff are all\ncomparatively young men, with none of the stiffness of the British\nstaff officer about them. We are all young--there is scarcely a man\nwith the rank of captain in the British Army out here. We are all\nmajors or colonels in the Egyptian Army, but most of us are subalterns\nin our own regiments. It is good training for us. At home a subaltern\nis merely a machine to carry out orders; he is told to do this, and he\ndoes it; for him to think for himself would be a heinous offence. He is\naltogether without responsibility, and without initiative and, by the\ntime he becomes a field officer, he is hidebound. He has never thought\nfor himself, and he can't be expected to begin to do so, after working\nfor twenty years like a machine.\n\n\"You will see, if we ever have a big war, that will be our weak point.\nIf it wasn't for wars like this, and our little wars in India, where\nmen do learn to think and take responsibility, I don't know where our\ngeneral officers would get their training.\n\n\"Well, you must be going. Goodbye! We shall often meet. There are so\nfew of us here, that we are always running against each other. I won't\nask you to dine with us, for a few days. No doubt you would like to get\naccustomed to headquarters mess first. Of course, Hunter and the\nbrigade staff dine together; while we have little regimental messes\namong ourselves, which I prefer. When there are only three or four of\nus, one can sit down in one's shirt sleeves, whereas at the brigade\nmess one must, of course, turn up in uniform, which in this climate is\nstifling.\"\n\nThe meal was a more pleasant one than Gregory had anticipated. On board\nthe steamer he had, of course, dined with the other officers; and he\nfound little difference here. Ten sat down, including the principal\nmedical officer and a captain--the head of the station intelligence\ndepartment, Major Wingate, being at present at Wady Halfa. Except for\nthe roughness of the surroundings, it was like a regimental mess, and\nthe presence of the General commanding in no way acted as a damper to\nthe conversation.\n\nGeneral Hunter had, before sitting down, introduced him to all the\nmembers with a few pleasant words, which had put him at his ease.\nGregory had, on his way up, learned a good deal as to the officers who\nwere down at Cairo for their health; and he was able to say who were\nconvalescent, and who had sailed, or were on the point of sailing, for\nEngland.\n\nThe table was formed of two long benches, and had been constructed by\nthe engineers. It was laid under a large tent, of which the walls had\nbeen removed to give a free passage of air.\n\nAlthough scarcely up to the standard of a mess dinner at home, it was\nby no means a bad one; consisting of soup, fish from the river, a joint\nof beef at one end and of mutton at the other, curried kidneys, sweet\nomelettes and cheese, whisky with water or soda to drink at dinner;\nand, after the meal, four bottles of claret were placed on the table,\nand cigars or pipes lit. Half an hour later four of the party sat down\nto whist, and the rest, going outside the tent, sat or threw themselves\ndown on the sand, and smoked or chatted till it was time to turn in.\n\nGregory's first step, next morning, was to buy a horse. This he\npurchased from some fugitives, who had come down from Kordofan. It was\na good animal, though in poor condition, and would soon pick up flesh,\nwhen well attended and fed. To accustom himself to riding, Gregory went\nout on it for a couple of hours every morning; getting up before\ndaybreak, so as to take exercise before the work of the day began. He\nalso followed the example of the officers of the Egyptian regiments,\nand purchased a camel for the conveyance of his own baggage.\n\n\"You will find it a great advantage,\" one of them said to him. \"Of\ncourse, times may arrive when you will have to leave it behind; but, as\na rule, there is no trouble about it at all. You hire a native driver,\nwho costs practically nothing, and he keeps with the baggage. No one\nasks any questions, and when you halt for a day or two, you have\ncomforts. Of course, with a British regiment you are cut down to the\nlast ounce, but with us it is altogether different. There being only\nthree or four white officers to each regiment, the few extra camels in\nthe train make no appreciable difference. Besides, these black fellows\nconsider it quite natural and proper that their white officers should\nfare in a very different way from themselves; whereas a British Tommy\nwould be inclined to grumble if he saw his officers enjoying luxuries,\nwhile he himself had to rough it.\"\n\nAs the horse only cost three pounds, and the camel only five, Gregory's\nstore of money was not seriously affected by the purchases. For both\nanimals, although in poor condition from their journey from Kordofan, a\nfortnight's rest and good feeding did wonders.\n\nZaki had not much to do, but Gregory was well satisfied with the\nselection he had made. He looked after and groomed the horse, saw that\nthe native with the camel took care of it, and went down regularly to\nthe river to water it every evening, while he himself did the same with\nthe horse. He always had a jug of cold tea ready for Gregory, whenever\nhe came in, and the floor of the tent was kept scrupulously clean.\nZaki's only regret was that he could not do more for his master, but he\nwas consoled by being told that the time would soon come when he would\nbe more actively engaged.\n\nFrom the first day of his arrival, Gregory was kept fully employed.\nSometimes he assisted the officer of the Intelligence Department, in\ninterviewing fugitives who had arrived from Berber and other points on\nthe river, from Kordofan, or from villages on the White Nile. Sometimes\nhe carried messages from the General to the officers in command of the\ntwo Egyptian brigades. He had to listen to disputes between natives\nreturning to their homes, from which they had been driven by the\nDervishes, and those they found in possession of their land. He took\nnotes of the arguments on both sides, and submitted them to the General\nfor his decision.\n\nThe work would have been trifling in any other climate, but was\nexhausting in the sweltering heat of the day, and he was not sorry when\nthe sun sank, and he could take off his khaki tunic and go down to the\nriver for a swim.\n\nOne evening, as they were sitting after dinner, General Hunter said:\n\n\"It is very annoying that, while these natives making their way down\nthe country are able to tell us a good deal of what is taking place on\nthe Nile, from Omdurman down to Metemmeh; and while we also get news of\nthe state of things at Berber and Abu Hamed; we know nothing whatever\nof Mahmud's intentions, nor indeed anything of what is doing at\nMetemmeh, itself, since it was captured by the Dervishes and, as we\nheard, the whole population destroyed.\n\n\"Of course, Mahmud has the choice of three courses. He can stay where\nhe is, he can march his whole force to Berber, or he can advance\nagainst us here. I don't suppose that he has any idea of the progress\nthe railway is making from Wady Halfa. He may have heard, and no doubt\nhe has heard, that we are making a road of some sort across the desert\nin the direction of Abu Hamed; but of the capabilities of the railway\nhe can form no idea, and may well believe that the march of an army,\nacross what is practically a waterless desert, is a matter of\nimpossibility.\n\n\"On the other hand, he knows that we are gathering a considerable force\nhere; and, with his limited knowledge, doubtless supposes that we are\ngoing to cross the Bayuda desert, to Metemmeh, as the Gordon relief\ncolumn did; or that, if we are not coming that way, we intend to follow\nthe river bank up to Berber. Unquestionably his best course, if he\nconsiders, as we may be sure he does, that the force under his command\nis strong enough to crush us here, would be to push across the desert,\nand fall upon us before reinforcements arrive. But it is reported, and\nI believe truly, that the Khalifa, his father, has positively refused\nto let him do so; still, sons have disobeyed their fathers before now.\n\n\"There is, it is true, the difficulty of water; but that is not so\nserious, in the case of a Dervish force, as it is with us. In the first\nplace, they can march twice as far as we can. In the second place, they\nare accustomed to go a long time without water, and are but little\naffected by the heat. Lastly, they have nothing to carry except their\nweapons, a few handfuls of dates, and their water gourds. Still, we\nknow that the forces that have, one after another, arrived here have\nbeen greatly weakened by the journey. However, Mahmud may attempt it,\nfor he must know, from his spies here, that we have at present no such\nland transport as would be required, were we intending to advance\nacross the desert. He may, therefore, move at least a portion of his\nforce to Berber; trusting to the fact that, even did we make an advance\nsouth from here, with the intention of cutting off his retreat to\nKhartoum, he would be able to reach Metemmeh before we could get there.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, a British general, if commanding a force constituted as\nMahmud's is, would make a dash across the desert and fall upon us;\nunless, indeed, he felt certain that, after the difficulties we\nencountered last time we attempted to take the desert route, we should\nbe certain to advance by the river, step by step, continuing the policy\nthat we have followed since we began to push forward from Assouan.\n\n\"Mahmud is in a very difficult position. He is controlled by his father\nat Khartoum. Among those with him are many important Emirs, men of\nalmost equal rank with himself; and he could hardly hope that whatever\ndecision he might personally arrive at would be generally accepted by\nall; and those who opposed him would do so with all the more force, as\nthey could declare that, in making any movement, he was acting in\nopposition to his father's orders.\n\n\"However, our total ignorance as to Mahmud's plans and intentions is\nmost unfortunate; but it can hardly be helped, for naturally the\nnatives coming down from Kordofan give Metemmeh a very wide berth. As\nto sending up any of the natives here, to find out what is going on, it\nis out of the question, for they would be detected at once, as their\nlanguage is so different from that of the Baggara.\"\n\nLater on, the General retired to his quarters. Gregory went there.\n\n\"Can I speak to you for a few minutes, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Hilliard. What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"I have been thinking over what you were saying, regarding information\nas to Mahmud's intentions. With your permission, I am ready to\nundertake to go into his camp, and to find out what the general opinion\nis as to his plans.\"\n\n\"Impossible, Mr. Hilliard! I admire your courage in making the offer,\nbut it would be going to certain death.\"\n\n\"I do not think so, sir. I talk Baggara better than the Negro dialect\nthat passes here. It is among the Baggara that I am likely to learn\nsomething of my father's fate; and, as the old nurse from whom I learnt\nthese languages had been for a long time among that tribe, she devoted,\nat my mother's request, more time to teaching me their Arab dialect\nthan any other, and I am convinced that I could pass unsuspected among\nthem, as far as language is concerned. There is no great difference\nbetween Arab features and European, and I think that, when I am stained\nbrown and have my head partly shaved, according to their fashion, there\nwill be little fear of my being detected.\n\n\"As to costume, that is easy enough. I have not seen any of the\nDervishes yet, but the natives who have come in from El Obeid, or any\nother neighbourhood where they are masters, could give me an account of\ntheir dress, and the way in which they wear the patches on their\nclothes, which are the distinguishing mark of the Mahdists.\"\n\n\"I could tell you that. So could any of the officers. Their dress\ndiffers very little from the ordinary Arab costume. Nearly all wear\nloose white trousers, coming down to the ankles. In some cases these\nare the usual baggy Eastern articles, in others the legs are separate.\nThey almost all wear the white garment coming down to the knee, with of\ncourse a sash round the waist, and sleeves reaching down to the elbow\nor an inch or two below it. Some wear turbans, but the majority simply\nskullcaps. I could get the dress made up in three or four hours. But\nthe risk is altogether too great, and I do not think that I should be\njustified in allowing you to undertake it.\"\n\n\"I really do not think that there will be any great danger, sir. If\nthere were no great object to be gained, it would be different; but in\nview of the great importance, as you said this evening, of learning\nMahmud's intentions, the risk of one life being lost, even were it\ngreat, is nothing. As you say, the Sirdar's plans might be greatly\naffected by the course Mahmud adopts; and in such a case, the life of a\nsubaltern like myself is a matter scarcely to be considered.\n\n\"From childhood I have been preparing to go among the Dervishes, and\nthis is what I propose doing, as soon as Khartoum is recaptured.\nTherefore sir if, by anticipating my work by a few months, or possibly\na year, I can render a service to the army, I would gladly undertake\nit, if you will give me permission to do so.\"\n\nThe General was, for a minute or two, silent.\n\n\"Well, Hilliard,\" he said at last, \"on thinking it over as you put it,\nI do not know that I should be justified in refusing your offer. It is\na very gallant one, and may possibly meet with success.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir! I shall be really glad to enter upon the work I have\nlooked forward to. Although it may have no direct bearing upon the\ndiscovery of my father's fate, it will be a start in that direction. Do\nyou think that I had better go mounted, or on foot?\"\n\n\"I should say certainly on horseback, but there is no occasion for any\nhasty determination. Every step should be carefully considered, and we\nshould, as far as possible, foresee and provide for every emergency\nthat may arise. Think it over well, yourself. Some time tomorrow I will\ndiscuss it again with you.\"\n\nGregory went straight back to his hut.\n\n\"Come in, Zaki, I want to speak to you.\n\n\"Light the lamp, and shut the door. Now sit down there. Do you know the\ncountry between this and Metemmeh?\"\n\n\"Yes, master; I travelled there with my father, six years ago.\"\n\n\"Is it difficult to find the way?\"\n\n\"It is not difficult. There are many signs of the passage of caravans.\nThere are skeletons of the camels of the English expedition; there are\nvery many of them. It would not be difficult, even for one who has\nnever passed them, to find the way.\"\n\n\"And there are wells?\"\n\n\"There are wells at Howeyat and Abu Halfa, at Gakdul and Abu Klea, also\nat Gubat.\"\n\n\"That is to say, water will be found nearly every day?\"\n\n\"Quite every day, to one on horseback. The longest distance is from\nGakdul to Abu Klea, but that would not be too long for mounted men, and\ncould even be done by a native on foot, in a long day's march.\"\n\n\"Do you know whether Mahmud's army is in Metemmeh, or outside the\ntown?\"\n\n\"From what I have heard, most of the Dervish force is on the hills\nbehind the town. They say Metemmeh is full of dead, and that even the\nDervishes do not care to live there.\"\n\n\"The Baggara are mostly mounted, are they not?\"\n\n\"Most of them are so, though there are some on foot. The leaders of the\ntribesmen who fight for the Khalifa are all on horseback, but most of\nthe army are on foot.\"\n\n\"You do not speak the Baggara language, I suppose?\"\n\nZaki shook his head.\n\n\"I know a little Arabic, but not much.\"\n\n\"I suppose most of the Arab tribes in the Soudan speak a dialect very\nmuch like the Baggara?\"\n\n\"Yes; it is everywhere Arabic, and there is but little difference. They\ncan all understand each other, and talk together. May your servant ask\nwhy you put these questions?\"\n\n\"Yes, Zaki, but you must not mention what I tell you to a soul.\"\n\n\"Zaki will be as silent as the grave.\"\n\n\"Well, I am going up dressed as a Mahdist. I can speak the Baggara\ntongue well. I am going to try and find out what they are going to do:\nwhether they will march to Berber, or come here, or remain at\nMetemmeh.\"\n\nZaki stared at his master, in speechless amazement. Gregory could not\nhelp smiling at the expression of his face.\n\n\"There does not seem much difficulty in it,\" he said. \"I can speak with\nyou in the dialect of Dongola, but the Baggara language is much easier\nto me, because I have been accustomed to speak Arabic since I was a\nchild. Of course my skin will be dyed, and I shall wear the Dervish\ndress. There is no difficulty in this matter.\"\n\n\"But they would cut you in pieces, my lord, if they found out that you\nwere a white.\"\n\n\"No doubt they would, but there is no reason why they should find that\nout. It would be much more dangerous for you to go into their camp than\nit would be for me. In the first place, you can scarcely speak any\nArabic; and in the second, they would see by your features that you are\none of the Jaalin. Whereas my features, when stained, would be much\nmore like those of the Arabs than yours would.\n\n\"Where should I be most likely to meet the Dervishes first?\"\n\n\"I do not think any of them are much this side of Metemmeh, at present.\nSometimes parties ride down to Gakdul, and they have even passed on\ntill they are within sight of this camp; but when they have found out\nthat the wells are still unoccupied, and the army here quiet, they go\nback again.\"\n\n\"If I go on horseback, Zaki, I shall want someone with me who will act\nas a guide; and who will look after his horse and mine at some place\nnear the river, where he can find a hiding place while I am away in the\nDervish camp.\"\n\n\"Would you take me, my lord?\" Zaki said quickly.\n\n\"I would much rather take you than anyone else, if you are willing to\ngo, Zaki.\"\n\n\"Surely I will go with my lord,\" the native said. \"No one has ever been\nso good to me as he has. If my lord is killed, I am ready to die with\nhim. He may count on me to do anything that he requires, even to go\nwith him into the Dervish camp. I might go as a slave, my lord.\"\n\n\"That would not do, Zaki. I do not wish to travel as a person who could\nride attended by a slave. People might say, 'Who is this man? Where\ndoes he come from? How is it that no one knows a man who rides with a\nslave?'\n\n\"My great object will be to enter the camp quietly, as one who has but\nleft half an hour before. When I have once entered it, and they ask\nwhence I came, I must tell them some likely story that I have made up:\nas, for example, that I have come from El Obeid, and that I am an\nofficer of the governor there; that, finding he could not get away\nhimself, he yielded to my request that I might come, and help to drive\nthe infidels into the sea.\"\n\nZaki nodded.\n\n\"That would be a good tale, my lord, for men who have escaped from El\nObeid, and have come here, have said that the Khalifa's troops there\nhave not been called to join him at Omdurman; for it is necessary to\nkeep a strong force there, as many of the tribes of the province would\nrise in rebellion, if they had the chance. Therefore you would not be\nlikely to meet anyone from El Obeid in Mahmud's camp.\"\n\n\"How is it, Zaki, that when so many in the Soudan have suffered at the\nhands of the Dervishes, they not only remain quiet, but supply the\nlargest part of the Khalifa's army?\"\n\n\"Because, my lord, none of them can trust the others. It is madness for\none tribe to rise, as the Jaalin did at Metemmeh. The Dervishes wiped\nthem out from the face of the earth. Many follow him because they see\nthat Allah has always given victory to the Mahdists; therefore the\nMahdi must be his prophet. Others join his army because their villages\nhave been destroyed, and their fields wasted, and they see no other way\nof saving themselves from starvation.\n\n\"There are many who fight because they are fond of fighting. You see\nhow gladly they take service with you, and fight against their own\ncountrymen, although you are Christians. Suppose you were to conquer\nthe Khalifa tomorrow, half his army would enlist in your service, if\nyou would take them. A man who would be contented to till his fields,\nif he could do so in peace and quiet, fears that he may see his produce\neaten by others and his house set on fire; and would rather leave his\nhome and fight--he cares not against whom.\n\n\"The Mahdist army are badly fed and badly paid. They can scarce keep\nlife together. But in the Egyptian Army the men are well taken care of.\nThey have their rations, and their pay. They say that if they are\nwounded, or lose a limb, and are no more able to fight, they receive a\npension. Is it wonderful that they should come to you and be faithful?\"\n\n\"Well, Zaki, we won't talk any longer, now. It is agreed, then, that if\nI go on this expedition, you will accompany me?\"\n\n\"Certainly, master. Wherever you go I am ready to go. Whatever happens\nto you will, I hope, happen to me.\"\n\nOn the following afternoon, Gregory was sent for.\n\n\"I have given the matter a good deal of thought, Mr. Hilliard,\" the\nGeneral said, \"and have decided to accept your offer. I suppose that\nyou have been thinking the matter over. Do you decide to go on foot, or\nmounted?\"\n\n\"On horseback, sir. My boy is perfectly willing to go with me. He knows\nthe way, and the position of the wells on the road. My plan is that,\nwhen we get near Metemmeh, he shall remain with the horses somewhere\nnear the river; and I shall enter the camp on foot. I am less likely to\nbe noticed that way. If questioned, my story will be that my father was\nat El Obeid, and that the Governor there is, by the Khalifa's orders,\nholding his force in hand to put down any outbreaks there may be in the\nprovince; and that, wishing to fight against the infidel, I have come\non my own account. If I am asked why I had not come on horseback, I\nshall say that I had ridden to within the last two or three miles, and\nthat the horse had then died.\n\n\"But I do not expect to be questioned at all, as one man on foot is as\nnothing, in an army of twenty or thirty thousand, gathered from all\nover the Soudan.\"\n\n\"You quite understand, Mr. Hilliard, that you are taking your life in\nyour hands? And that there is no possibility, whatever, of our doing\nanything for you, if you get into trouble?\"\n\n\"Quite, sir. If I am detected, I shall probably be killed at once. I do\nnot think that there is more risk in it than in going into battle. As I\nhave told you, I have, so far as I know, no relatives in the world; and\nthere will be no one to grieve, if I never come back again.\n\n\"As to the clothes, I can easily buy them from one of the natives here.\nMany of them are dressed in the garments of the Dervishes who were\nkilled when we came up here; except, of course, that the patches were\ntaken off. I will get my man to buy a suit for himself, and one for me.\nIt would be better than having new clothes made; for, even if these\nwere dirtied, they would not look old. When he has bought the clothes,\nhe can give them a good washing, and then get a piece of stuff to sew\non as patches.\n\n\"I am afraid, sir, that there will be little chance of my being able to\nobtain any absolute news of Mahmud's intentions; but only to glean\ngeneral opinion, in the camp. It is not likely that the news of any\nintended departure would be kept a secret up till the last moment,\namong the Dervishes, as it would be here.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" the General agreed. \"We may take it as certain that the\nmatter would be one of common talk. Of course, Mahmud and his principal\nadvisers might change their minds, at any moment. Still I think that,\nwere it intended to make a move against us, or to Berber, it would be\ngenerally known.\n\n\"I may tell you that we do not intend to cross the Bayuda desert. We\nshall go up the river, but this is a secret that will be kept till the\nlast moment. And before we start, we shall do all in our power to\nspread a belief that we are going to advance to Metemmeh. We know that\nthey are well informed, by their spies here, of our movements. We shall\nsend a strong force to make a reconnaissance, as far as Gakdul. This\nwill appear to be a preliminary step to our advance, and should keep\nMahmud inactive, till too late. He will not dare advance to Berber,\nbecause he will be afraid of our cutting him off from Omdurman.\n\n\"You are satisfied with your horse? It is advisable that you should\nhave a good one, and yet not so good as to attract attention.\"\n\n\"Yes; I could not want a better horse, General. He is not handsome, but\nI have ridden him a great deal, and he is certainly fast; and, being\ndesert bred, I have no doubt has plenty of endurance. I shall, of\ncourse, get one for my boy.\"\n\n\"There are plenty in the transport yard. They have been bought up from\nfugitives who have come in here. I will write you an order to select\nany one you choose; and if you see one you think better than your own,\nyou can take it also; and hand yours over to the transport, to keep\nuntil you return.\n\n\"You should take a Martini-Henri with you. I will give you an order for\none, on one of the native regiments. They are, as you know, armed with\nthem; and have, of course, a few cases of spare rifles. A good many\nhave fallen into the hands of the Dervishes, at one time or another, so\nthat your carrying such a weapon will not excite any remark. It would\nnot do to take a revolver, but no doubt you will be able to buy pistols\nthat have been brought down by the fugitives. You will certainly be\nable to get them at some of those Greek shops. They buy up all that\nkind of thing. Of course, you will carry one of the Dervish long\nknives.\n\n\"Is there anything else that you can think of?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir.\"\n\n\"When will you be ready, do you suppose?\"\n\n\"By the day after tomorrow, sir. I shall start after dark, so that no\none will notice my going. With your permission, I will come round\nbefore I set off, so that you can see whether the disguise is good\nenough to pass.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 7: To Metemmeh.\n\n\nZaki at once set to work to collect the articles needed for the\njourney; and Gregory obtained, from the transport, another horse and\ntwo native saddles. He was well satisfied with his own animal; and,\neven had he found in the transport yard a better horse, he would still\nhave preferred his own, as they were accustomed to each other. He\nbought pistols for himself and Zaki, and a matchlock for the latter.\n\nEverything was ready by the time Gregory went to the mess to lunch, on\nthe day fixed for his departure. Nothing whatever had been said as to\nhis leaving, as it was possible that some of the native servants, who\nwaited upon them, might have picked up sufficient English to gather\nthat something important was about to take place. When, however, the\nmeal was over and he said carelessly, \"I shall not be at mess this\nevening;\" he saw, by the expression of the officers' faces, that they\nall were aware of the reason for his absence. One after another they\neither shook hands with him, or gave him a quiet pat on the shoulder,\nwith the words \"Take care of yourself, lad,\" or \"A safe journey and a\nspeedy return,\" or some other kind wish.\n\nGoing to his hut, he was shaved by Zaki at the back of the neck, up to\nhis ears; so that the white, closely-fitting cap would completely cover\nthe hair. Outside the tent a sauce pan was boiling with herbs and\nberries, which the lad had procured from an old woman who was\nconsidered to have a great knowledge of simples. At four in the\nafternoon, Gregory was stained from head to foot, two coats of the dye\nbeing applied. This used but a small quantity of the liquor, and the\nrest was poured into a gourd, for future use. The dresses were ready,\nwith the exception of the Mahdi patches, which were to be sewn on at\ntheir first halting place.\n\nBefore it was dark, Gregory went across to the General's quarters. The\nblack sentry stopped him.\n\n\"The General wants to speak to me,\" Gregory said, in Arabic.\n\nThe man called up the native sergeant from the guard tent, who asked\nwhat he wanted.\n\n\"I am here by the orders of the General.\"\n\nThe sergeant looked doubtful, but went in. He returned in a minute, and\nmotioned to Gregory to follow him in. The General looked at him, from\nhead to foot.\n\n\"I suppose it is you, Hilliard,\" he said, \"but I certainly should not\nhave recognized you. With that yellowish-brown skin, you could pass\nanywhere as a Soudan Arab. Will the colour last?\"\n\n\"I am assured that it will last for some days, but I am taking enough\nwith me to renew it, four or five times.\"\n\n\"Well, unless some unexpected obstacle occurs, I think you are safe\nfrom detection. Mind you avoid men from El Obeid; if you do not fall in\nwith them, you should be safe. Of course, when you have sewn on those\npatches, your disguise will be complete.\n\n\"I suppose you have no idea how long you will be away?\"\n\n\"It will take me five days to go there, and five days to come back. I\nshould think that if I am three days in the camp, I ought to get all\nthe information required. In a fortnight I should be here; though, of\ncourse, I may be longer. If I am not back within a few days of that\ntime, you will know that it is because I have stayed there, in the\nhopes of getting more certain news. If I don't return in three weeks,\nit will be because something has gone wrong.\"\n\n\"I hope it will not be so, lad. As regards appearance and language, I\nhave no fear of your being detected; but you must always bear in mind\nthat there are other points. You have had the advantage of seeing the\ncamps of the native regiments, when the men are out of uniform--how\nthey walk, laugh uproariously, play tricks with each other, and\ngenerally behave. These are all natives of the Soudan, and no small\nproportion of them have been followers of the Mahdi, and have fought\nagainst us, so they may be taken as typical of the men you are going\namong. It is in all these little matters that you will have to be\ncareful.\n\n\"Now, I will not detain you longer. I suppose your horses are on\nboard?\"\n\nIt had been arranged that Gregory should be taken down to Korti, in a\nnative craft that was carrying some stores required at that camp.\n\n\"Yes, sir. My boy put them on board, two hours ago.\"\n\n\"Here is the pass by which you can enter or leave the British lines, at\nany time. The boat will be there before daylight, but the landing of\nthe stores will not, of course, take place until later. Show this pass\nto the first officer who comes down. It contains an order for you to be\nallowed to start on your journey, at once.\n\n\"This other pass is for your return. You had better, at your first\nhalt, sew it under one of your patches. It is, as you see, written on a\npiece of linen, so that however closely you may be examined, there will\nbe no stiffness or crackling, as would be the case with paper.\n\n\"Now goodbye, Hilliard! It is a satisfaction to me that you have\nundertaken this journey on your own initiative, and on your own\nrequest. I believe that you have a fair chance of carrying it\nthrough--more so than men with wider shoulders and bigger limbs would\nhave. If you come to grief, I shall blame myself for having accepted\nyour offer; but I shall at least know that I thought it over seriously,\nand that, seeing the importance of the object in view, I did not feel\nmyself justified in refusing.\"\n\nWith a cordial shake of the hand, he said goodbye to Gregory. The\nlatter went off to his hut. He did not leave it until dusk, and then\nwent down to the boat, where Zaki had remained with the horses.\n\nAs soon as it started they lay down alongside some bales, on the deck\nof the native craft, and were soon asleep. They did not wake until a\nslight bump told them they were alongside the wharf, at Korti.\n\nDay was just breaking, so no move was made until an hour later. An\nofficer came down, with the fatigue party, to unload the stores that\nshe had brought down. When the horses were ashore, Gregory handed the\npass to the officer, who was standing on the bank. He looked at it,\nwith some surprise.\n\n\"Going to do some scouting,\" he muttered, and then called to a native\nofficer, \"Pass these two men beyond the outposts. They have an order\nfrom General Hunter.\"\n\n\"Will you be away long?\" he asked Gregory, in Arabic.\n\n\"A week or more, my lord,\" the latter replied.\n\n\"Ah! I suppose you are going to Gakdul. As far as we have heard, there\nare no Dervishes there. Well, you must keep a sharp lookout. They may\nbe in hiding anywhere about there, and your heads won't be worth much,\nif they lay hands on you.\"\n\n\"We intend to do so, sir;\" and then, mounting, they rode on, the native\nofficer walking beside them.\n\n\"You know the country, I suppose?\" he said. \"The Dervishes are bad, but\nI would rather fall into their hands than lose my way in the desert.\nThe one is a musket ball or a quick chop with a knife, the other an\nagony for two or three days.\"\n\n\"I have been along the road before,\" Zaki said. \"There is no fear of my\nlosing my way; and, even if I did so, I could travel by the stars.\"\n\n\"I wish we were all moving,\" the native said. \"It is dull work staying\nhere, month after month.\"\n\nAs soon as they were beyond the lines, they thanked the officer and\nwent off, at a pace native horses are capable of keeping up for hours.\n\n\"Korti is a much pleasanter camp to stay in than Merawi,\" Gregory said.\n\"It really looks a delightful place. It is quite evident that the\nMahdists have never made a raid here.\"\n\nThe camp stood on a high bank above the river. There were spreading\ngroves of trees, and the broad avenues, that had been constructed when\nthe Gordon relief expedition was encamped there, could still be seen.\nBeyond it was a stretch of land which had been partly cultivated. Sevas\ngrass grew plentifully, and acacia and mimosa shrubs in patches.\n\nThey rode to the wells of Hambok, a distance of some five-and-thirty\nmiles, which they covered in five hours. There they halted, watered\ntheir horses and, after giving them a good feed, turned them out to\nmunch the shrubs or graze on the grass, as they chose. They then had a\nmeal from the food they had brought with them, made a shelter of\nbushes, for the heat was intense, and afterwards sewed the Mahdi\npatches upon their clothes.\n\nWhen the sun went down they fetched the horses in, gave them a small\nfeed, and then fastened them to some bushes near. As there was plenty\nof water in the wells, they took an empty gourd down and, stripping,\npoured water over their heads and bodies; then, feeling greatly\nrefreshed, dressed and lay down to sleep.\n\nThe moon rose between twelve and one; and, after giving the horses a\ndrink, they mounted and rode to Gakdul, which they reached soon after\ndaybreak. They had stopped a mile away, and Zaki went forward on foot,\nhiding himself as much as possible from observation. On his return he\nreported that no one was at the wells, and they therefore rode on,\ntaking every precaution against surprise.\n\nThe character of the scenery had completely changed; and they had, for\nsome miles, been winding along at the foot of the Jebel-el-Jilif hills.\nThese were steep and precipitous, with spurs and intermediate valleys.\nThe wells differed entirely from those at Hambok, which were merely\nholes dug in the sand, the water being brought up in one of the skin\nbags they had brought with them, and poured into shallow cisterns made\nin the surface. At Gakdul the wells were large pools in the rock, at\nthe foot of one of the spurs of the hill, two miles from the line of\nthe caravan route. Here the water was beautifully clear, and abundant\nenough for the wants of a large force.\n\n\"It is lucky I had you with me, Zaki, for I should certainly have gone\nstraight on past the wells, without knowing where they were; and as\nthere are no others this side of Abu Klea, I should have had rather a\nbad day.\"\n\nThe three forts which the Guards had built, when they came on in\nadvance of General Stewart's column, were still standing; as well as a\nnumber of smaller ones, which had been afterwards added.\n\n\"It is rather a bad place for being caught, Zaki, for the ground is so\nbroken, and rocky, that the Dervishes might creep up without being\nseen.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, it is a bad place,\" Zaki agreed. \"I am glad that none of the\nDervishes were here, for we should not have seen them, until we were\nquite close.\"\n\nZaki had, on the road, cut a large faggot of dried sticks, and a fire\nwas soon lighted.\n\n\"You must give the horses a good allowance of grain,\" Gregory said,\n\"for they will be able to pick up nothing here, and it is a long ride\nto Abu Klea.\"\n\n\"We shall have to be very careful there, my lord. It is not so very far\nfrom Metemmeh, and we are very likely to find Baggaras at the wells. It\nwas there they met the English force that went through to Metemmeh.\n\n\"I think it would be better for us to halt early, this evening, and\ncamp at the foot of Jebel Sergain. The English halted there, before\nadvancing to Abu Klea. We can take plenty of water in the two skins, to\ngive the horses a drink and leave enough for tomorrow. There is grass\nin abundance there.\n\n\"When the moon rises, we can make our way round to avoid Abu Klea, and\nhalt in the middle of the day for some hours. We could then ride on as\nsoon as the sun is low, halt when it becomes too dark to ride, and then\nstart again when the moon rises. In that way we shall reach the river,\nbefore it is light.\"\n\n\"I think that would be a very good plan, Zaki. We should find it very\ndifficult to explain who we were, if we met any Dervishes at Abu Klea.\nI will have a look at my sketch map; we have found it very good and\naccurate, so far; and with that, and the compass the General gave me\nbefore starting, we ought to have no difficulty in striking the river,\nas the direction is only a little to the east of south.\"\n\nHe opened a tin of preserved meat, of which he had four with him, and\nplaced it to warm near the fire.\n\n\"We should have had to throw the other tins away, if we had gone on to\nAbu Klea,\" he said. \"It would never have done for them to be found upon\nus, if we were searched.\"\n\nWhen the meat was hot they ate it, using some biscuits as plates.\nAfterwards they feasted on a melon they had brought with them, and were\nglad to hear their horses munching the leaves of some shrubs near.\n\nWhen the moon rose, they started. It was slow work at first, as they\nhad some difficulty in passing the rough country lying behind the hill.\nOnce past it, they came upon a level plain, and rode fast for some\nhours. At ten o'clock they halted, and lay down under the shelter of\nthe shrubs; mounting again at four, and riding for another three hours.\n\n\"How far do you think we are from the river now? By the map, I should\nthink we cannot be much more than twenty miles from it.\"\n\n\"I don't know, my lord. I have never been along here before; but it\ncertainly ought not to be farther than that.\"\n\n\"We have ridden nine hours. We travelled slowly for the first four or\nfive, but we have come fast, since then. We must give the horses a good\nrest, so we will not move on till the moon rises, which will be about a\nquarter to two. It does not give a great deal of light, now, and we\nshall have to make our way through the scrub; but, at any rate, we\nought to be close to the river, before morning.\"\n\nWhen the sun was low they again lit a fire, and had another good meal,\ngiving the greater portion of their stock of biscuits to the horses,\nand a good drink of water.\n\n\"We must use up all we can eat before tomorrow, Zaki, and betake\nourselves to a diet of dried dates. There is enough water left to give\nthe horses a drink before we start, then we shall start as genuine\nDervishes.\"\n\nThey found that the calculation they had made as to distance was\ncorrect and, before daybreak, arrived on the bank of the Nile, and at\nonce encamped in a grove. In the morning they could see the houses of\nMetemmeh, rising from the line of sandy soil, some five miles away.\n\n\"There seems to be plenty of bush and cover, all along the bank, Zaki.\nWe will stay here till the evening, and then move three miles farther\ndown; so that you may be handy, if I have to leave the Dervishes in a\nhurry.\"\n\n\"Could we not go into the camp, my lord?\"\n\n\"It would be much better, in some respects, if we could; but, you see,\nyou do not speak Arabic.\"\n\n\"No, master; but you could say I was carried off as a slave, when I was\na boy. You see, I do speak a little Arabic, and could understand simple\norders; just as any slave boy would, if he had been eight or ten years\namong the Arabs.\"\n\n\"It would certainly be a great advantage to have you and the horses\nhandy. However, at first I will go in and join the Dervishes, and see\nhow they encamp. They are, no doubt, a good deal scattered; and if we\ncould find a quiet spot, where a few mounted men have taken up their\nstation, we would join them. But before we did that, it would be\nnecessary to find out whether they came from Kordofan, or from some of\nthe villages on the White Nile. It would never do to stumble into a\nparty from El Obeid.\"\n\nThey remained quiet all day. The wood extended a hundred and fifty\nyards back from the river, and there was little fear that anyone coming\ndown from Omdurman would enter it, when within sight of Metemmeh. At\ndusk they rode on again, until they judged that they were within two\nmiles of the town; and then, entering a clump of high bushes by the\nriver, halted for the night.\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Among The Dervishes.\n\n\nIn the morning Gregory started alone, as soon as it was light. As he\nneared the town, he saw that there were several native craft on the\nriver; and that boats were passing to and fro between the town and\nShendy, on the opposite bank. From the water side a number of men were\ncarrying what appeared to be bags of grain towards the hills behind the\ntown, while others were straggling down towards the river.\n\nWithout being questioned, Gregory entered Metemmeh, but stopped there\nfor a very few minutes. Everywhere were the bodies of men, women, and\nchildren, of donkeys and other animals. All were now shrivelled and\ndried by the sun, but the stench was almost unbearable, and he was glad\nto hurry away.\n\nOnce beyond the walls he made for the hill. Many tents could be seen\nthere, and great numbers of men moving about. He felt sure that, among\nso many, no one would notice that he was a newcomer; and after moving\namong the throng, he soon sat down among a number of Dervishes who were\neating their morning meal. Taking some dates out of his bag, he munched\nthem quietly.\n\nFrom the talk going on, he soon perceived that there was a considerable\namount of discontent at the long delay. Some of the men were in favour\nof moving to Berber, on the ground that they would at least fare better\nthere; but the majority were eager to march north, to drive the\ninfidels from Merawi and Dongola.\n\n\"Mahmud would do that, I am sure,\" one of them said, \"if he had but his\nwill; but how could we march without provisions? It is said that Mahmud\nhas asked for a sufficient supply to cross the Bayuda, and has promised\nto drive the infidels before him to Assouan; but the Khalifa says no,\nit would be better to wait till they come in a strong body, and then to\nexterminate them. If we are not to fight, why were we sent here? It\nwould have been better to stay at Omdurman, because there we had plenty\nof food; or, if it ran short, could march to the villages and take what\nwe wanted. Of course the Khalifa knows best, but to us it seems\nstrange, indeed.\"\n\nThere was a general chorus of assent. After listening for some time\nGregory rose and, passing over the ridge, came upon the main camp. Here\nwere a number of emirs and sheiks, with their banners flying before the\nentrance of their tents. The whole ground was thickly dotted with\nlittle shelters, formed of bushes, over which dark blankets were thrown\nto keep out the rays of the sun. Everywhere women were seated or\nstanding--some talking to each other, others engaged in cooking.\nChildren played about; boys came in loaded with faggots, which they had\ngone long distances to cut. In some places numbers of horses were\npicketed, showing where the Baggara cavalry were stationed.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of the emirs' tents there was some sort of attempt\nat order, in the arrangement of the little shelters, showing where the\nmen of their tribes were encamped. Beyond, straggling out for some\ndistance, were small encampments, in some of which the men were still\nerecting shelters, with the bushes the women and boys brought in. Most\nof these were evidently fresh arrivals, who had squatted down as soon\nas they came up; either from ignorance as to where their friends had\nencamped, or from a preference for a quiet situation. This fringe of\nnew arrivals extended along the whole semicircle of the camp; and as\nseveral small parties came up while Gregory wandered about, and he saw\nthat no notice was taken of them by those already established, he\nthought that he could bring Zaki, and the horses up without any fear of\nclose questioning. He therefore walked down again to the spot where he\nhad left them; and, mounting, they rode to the camp, making a wide\nsweep so as to avoid the front facing Metemmeh.\n\n\"We could camp equally well, anywhere here, Zaki, but we may as well go\nround to the extreme left; as, if we have to ride off suddenly, we\nshall at least start from the nearest point to the line by which we\ncame.\"\n\nThere was a small clump of bushes, a hundred yards or so from the\nnearest of the little shelters. Here they dismounted, and at once\nbegan, with their knives, to cut down some of the bushes to form a\nscreen from the sun. They had watered the horses before they left the\nriver, and had also filled their water skins.\n\n\"I don't think we could find a better place, Zaki,\" Gregory said, when,\nhaving completed their shelter and thrown their blankets over it, they\nlay down in the shade. \"No doubt we shall soon be joined by others; but\nas we are the first comers on this spot, it will be for us to ask\nquestions of them, and, after, for them to make enquiries of us.\n\n\"I shall go into the camp as soon as the heat abates, and people begin\nto move about again. Remember our story--You were carried off from a\nJaalin village, in a raid. Your master was a small sheik, and is now\nwith the force at El Obeid. You had been the companion of his son, and\nwhen the latter made up his mind to come and fight here your master\ngave you your freedom, so that you might fight by his son's side. You\nmight say that I have not yet settled under whose banner I shall fight.\nAll I wish is to be in the front of the battle, when we meet the\ninfidels. That will be quite sufficient. There are men here from almost\nevery village in the Soudan, and no one will care much where his\nneighbours come from.\n\n\"Mention that we intend to fight as matchlock men, not on horseback, as\nthe animals are greatly fatigued from their long journey, and will\nrequire rest for some time; and, being so far from home, I fear that we\nmight lose them if we went into the fight with them; and in that case\nmight have to journey on foot, for a long time, before we could get\nothers.\n\n\"I don't at all suppose that it will be necessary for you to say all\nthis. People will be too much occupied with their own affairs to care\nmuch about others; still, it is well not to hesitate, if questioned.\"\n\nTalk and laughter in the great camp ceased now, and it was not until\nthe sun lost its power that it again began. Gregory did not move, till\nit began to get dusk.\n\n\"I shall be away some time,\" he said, \"so don't be at all uneasy about\nme. I shall take my black blanket, so that I can cover myself with it\nand lie down, as if asleep, close to any of the emirs' tents where I\nhear talk going on; and so may be able to gather some idea as to their\nviews. I have already learned that the tribesmen have not heard of any\nimmediate move, and are discontented at being kept inactive so long.\nThe leaders, however, may have their plans, but will not make them\nknown to the men, until it is time for action.\"\n\nThe camp was thoroughly alive when he entered it. Men were sitting\nabout in groups; the women, as before, keeping near their little\nshelters, laughing and chatting together, and sometimes quarrelling.\nFrom the manner of the men, who either sat or walked about, it was not\ndifficult for Gregory to distinguish between the villagers, who had\nbeen dragged away from their homes and forced to enter the service of\nthe Khalifa, and the Baggara and kindred tribes, who had so long held\nthe Soudan in subjection. The former were quiet in their demeanour, and\nsometimes sullen in their looks. He had no doubt that, when the\nfighting came, these would face death at the hands of the infidels as\nbravely as their oppressors, for the belief in Mahdism was now\nuniversal. His followers had proved themselves invincible; they had no\ndoubt that they would destroy the armies of Egypt, but they resented\nbeing dragged away from their quiet homes, their families, and their\nfields.\n\nAmong these the Baggara strode haughtily. Splendid men, for the most\npart, tall, lithe, and muscular; men with the supreme belief in\nthemselves, and in their cause, carrying themselves as the Norman\nbarons might have done among a crowd of Saxons; the conquerors of the\nland, the most trusted followers of the successor of the Mahdi, men who\nfelt themselves invincible. It was true that they had, so far, failed\nto overrun Egypt, and had even suffered reverses, but these the Khalifa\nhad taught them to consider were due to disobedience of his orders, or\nthe result of their fighting upon unlucky days. All this was soon to be\nreversed. The prophecies had told that the infidels were about to be\nannihilated, and that then they would sweep down without opposition,\nand possess themselves of the plunder of Egypt.\n\nGregory passed wholly unnoticed among the crowd. There was nothing to\ndistinguish him from others, and the thought that an Egyptian spy,\nstill less one of the infidels, should venture into their camp had\nnever occurred to one of that multitude. Occasionally, he sat down near\na group of the Baggara, listening to their talk. They were impatient,\ntoo, but they were convinced that all was for the best; and that, when\nit was the will of Allah, they would destroy their enemy. Still, there\nwere expressions of impatience that Mahmud was not allowed to advance.\n\n\"We know,\" one said, \"that it is at Kirkeban that the last great\ndestruction of the infidel is to take place, and that these madmen are\ncoming to their fate; still, we might move down and destroy those at\nDongola and along the river, and possess ourselves of their arms and\nstores. Why should we come thus far from Omdurman, if we are to go no\nfarther?\"\n\n\"Why ask questions?\" another said contemptuously. \"Enough that it is\nthe command of the Khalifa, to whom power and knowledge has been given\nby the Mahdi, until he himself returns to earth. To the Khalifa will be\nrevealed the day and the hour on which we are to smite the infidel. If\nMahmud and the great emirs are all content to wait, why should we be\nimpatient?\"\n\nEverywhere Gregory went, he heard the same feelings expressed. The men\nwere impatient to be up and doing, but they must wait the appointed\nhour.\n\nIt was late before he ventured to approach the tents of the leaders. He\nknew that it was impossible to get near Mahmud himself, for he had his\nown bodyguard of picked men. The night, however, was dark and,\nenveloping himself from head to foot in his black blanket, he crawled\nout until well beyond the line of tents, and then very cautiously made\nhis way towards them again. He knew that he should see the white\nfigures of the Dervishes before they could make him out; and he\nmanaged, unnoticed, to crawl up to one of the largest tents, and lie\ndown against it. He heard the chatter of the women in an adjoining\ntent, but there was no sound in that against which he lay.\n\nFor an hour all was quiet. Then he saw two white figures coming from\nMahmud's camp, which lay some fifty yards away. To his delight, they\nstopped at the entrance of the tent by which he was concealed, and one\nsaid:\n\n\"I can well understand, Ibrahim Khalim, that your brother Mahmud is\nsorely vexed that your father will not let him advance against the\nEgyptians, at Merawi. I fully share his feelings; for could I not, with\nmy cavalry, sweep them before me into the river, even though no footmen\ncame with me? According to accounts they are but two or three thousand\nstrong, and I have as many horsemen under my command.\"\n\n\"That is so, Osman Azrakyet. But methinks my father is right. If we\nwere to march across the desert, we would lose very many men and great\nnumbers of animals, and we should arrive weakened and dispirited. If we\nremain here, it is the Egyptians who will have to bear the hardships of\nthe march across the desert. Great numbers of the animals that carry\nthe baggage and food, without which the poor infidels are unable to\nmarch, would die, and the weakened force would be an easy prey for us.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" the other said, \"but they may come now, as they came to\nDongola, in their boats.\"\n\n\"They have the cataracts to ascend, and the rapid currents of the Nile\nat its full to struggle against. There is a strong force at Abu Hamed,\nand our Governor at Berber will move down there, with all his force,\nwhen he hears that the Egyptians are coming up the cataracts. Should it\nbe the will of Allah that they should pass them, and reach Berber, we\nshall know how to meet them. Mahmud has settled this evening that many\nstrong forts are to be built on the river bank here, and if the\ninfidels try to advance farther by water, they will be all sunk.\n\n\"I agree with you and Mahmud, and wish that it had been otherwise, and\nthat we could hurl ourselves at once upon the Egyptians and prevent\ntheir coming farther--but that would be but a partial success. If we\nwait, they will gather all their forces before they come, and we shall\ndestroy them at one blow. Then we shall seize all their stores and\nanimals, cross the desert to Dongola, march forward to Assouan, and\nthere wait till the Khalifa brings his own army; and then who is to\noppose us? We will conquer the land of the infidel. I am as eager for\nthe day of battle as you are, but it seems to me that it is best to\nwait here, until the infidels come; and I feel that it is wise of the\nKhalifa thus to order. Now I will to my tent.\"\n\nAs soon as Ibrahim Khalim had entered his tent, Gregory crawled away,\nwell satisfied that he had gained exactly the information he had come\nto gather. He had gone but a few paces when he saw a white figure\nstriding along, in front of the tents. He stopped, and threw himself\ndown.\n\nUnfortunately, the path taken by the sheik was directly towards him. He\nheard the footsteps advancing, in hopes that the man would pass either\nin front or behind him. Then he felt a sudden kick, an exclamation, and\na heavy fall. He leapt to his feet, but the Arab sheik was as quick\nand, springing up, also seized him, at the same time drawing his knife\nand uttering a loud shout.\n\nGregory grasped the Arab's wrist, and without hesitation snatched his\nown knife from the sash, and drove it deep into his assailant's body.\nThe latter uttered another loud cry for help, and a score of men rushed\nfrom behind the tents.\n\nGregory set off at the top of his speed, dashed over the brow of the\nbridge, and then, without entering the camp there, he kept along close\nto the crest, running at the top of his speed and wrapping his blanket\nas much as possible round him. He heard an outburst of yells behind,\nand felt sure that the sheik he had wounded had told those who had\nrushed up which way he had fled. With loud shouts they poured over the\ncrest, and there were joined by others running up from the camp.\n\nWhen Gregory paused for a moment, after running for three or four\nhundred yards, he could hear no sound of footsteps behind him. Glancing\nround, he could not see white dresses in the darkness. Turning sharply\noff, he recrossed the crest of the hill and, keeping close to it,\ncontinued his flight until well past the end of the camp.\n\nThe alarm had by this time spread everywhere, and a wild medley of\nshouts rose throughout the whole area of the encampment. He turned now,\nand made for the spot where he had left Zaki and the horses. In five\nminutes he reached it.\n\n\"Is that you, my lord?\" Zaki asked, as he came up.\n\n\"Yes, we must fly at once! I was discovered, and had to kill--or at\nleast badly wound--a sheik, and they are searching for me everywhere.\"\n\n\"I have saddled the horses, and put the water skins on them.\"\n\n\"That is well done, Zaki. Let us mount and be off, at once. We will\nlead the horses. It is too dark to gallop among these bushes, and the\nsound of the hoofs might be heard. We will go quietly, till we are well\naway.\"\n\nNot another word was spoken, till they had gone half a mile.\n\n\"We will mount now, Zaki. The horses can see better than we. We will go\nat a walk. I dare not strike a light to look at the compass, but there\nare the stars. I do not see the north star, it must be hidden by the\nmist, lower down; but the others give us the direction, quite near\nenough to go by.\n\n\"It is most unfortunate that the fellow who rushed against me was a\nsheik. I could see that, by the outline of his robe. If it had been a\ncommon man, there would not have been any fuss over it. As it is, they\nwill search for us high and low. I know he wasn't killed on the spot,\nfor he shouted after I had left him; and they are likely to guess, from\nhis account, that I had been down at one of the emirs' tents, and was\nprobably a spy.\n\n\"I know that I ought to have paused a moment, and given him another\nstab, but I could not bring myself to do it. It is one thing to stab a\nman who is trying to take one's life, but it is quite another when he\nhas fallen, and is helpless.\"\n\nZaki had made no reply. He could scarcely understand his master's\nrepugnance to making matters safe, when another blow would have done\nso, but it was not for him to blame.\n\nThey travelled all night and, when the moon rose, were able to get\nalong somewhat faster; but its light was now feeble and uncertain. As\nsoon as day broke, they rode fast, and at ten o'clock had left behind\nthe range of hills, stretching between the wells of Abu Klea and Jebel\nSergain.\n\n\"We ought to be safe now,\" Gregory said, as they dismounted. \"At any\nrate, the horses must have a rest. We have done over forty miles.\"\n\n\"We are safe for the present, my lord. It all depends whether or not\nthey think you are a spy. If they come to that conclusion, they will\nsend at once to Abu Klea; and if a strong body is stationed there, they\nmay have sent a party on to Gakdul, or even to El Howeyat, for they\nwill feel sure that we shall make for one of the wells.\"\n\n\"How much water have you got in the bags?\"\n\nZaki examined them.\n\n\"Enough for ourselves for five or six days; but only enough for two\ndrinks each, for the horses and for ourselves, for a couple of days.\"\n\n\"That is bad. If we had had any idea of coming away so soon, we would\nhave filled the large bags yesterday. I had intended to send down the\nhorses in the morning, therefore left them only half full, and they\nmust have leaked a good deal to get so low. See if one leaks more than\nthe other.\"\n\nIt was found that one held the water well, but from the other there was\na steady drip. They transferred the water from this to the sound bag.\n\n\"We must drink as little as we can, Zaki, and give the horses only a\nmouthful, now and then, and let them munch the shrubs and get a little\nmoisture from them. Do you think there is any fear of the Dervishes\nfollowing our tracks?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. In the first place, they do not know that there are two\nof us, or that we are mounted. When those who camped near us notice,\nwhen they get up this morning, that we have moved; they will only think\nthat we have shifted our camp, as there was no talk of horsemen being\nconcerned in this affair. No, I do not think they will attempt to\nfollow us, except along the caravan road, but I feel sure they will\npursue us on that line.\"\n\nThey rested for some hours, in the shade of a high rock, leaving the\nhorses to pick what herbage they could find. At four o'clock they\nstarted again. They had ridden two hours, when Zaki said:\n\n\"See, my lord, there are two men on the top of Jebel Sergain!\"\n\nGregory gazed in that direction.\n\n\"Yes, I can notice them now, but I should not have done so, if you had\nnot seen them.\"\n\n\"They are on watch, my lord.\"\n\n\"Well, they can hardly see us, at this distance.\"\n\n\"You may be sure that they see us,\" Zaki said; \"the eyes of an Arab are\nvery keen, and could not fail to catch two moving objects--especially\nhorsemen.\"\n\n\"If they are looking for us, and have seen us, Zaki, they would not be\nstanding stationary there.\"\n\n\"Not if they were alone. But others may have been with them. When they\nfirst caught sight of us, which may have been half an hour ago, the\nothers may have gone down to Abu Klea, while those two remained to\nwatch which course we took. The Arabs can signal with their lances, or\nwith their horses, and from there they would be able to direct any\nparty in pursuit of us.\"\n\n\"Well, we must keep on as hard as we can, till dark; after that, we can\ntake it quietly. You see, the difficulty with us will be water. Now\nthat they have once made out two horsemen riding north, they must know\nthat we have some special object in avoiding them; and will, no doubt,\nsend a party to Gakdul, if not farther.\"\n\nThey crossed the rough country as quickly as they could, and then again\nbroke into a canter. An hour later, as they crossed a slight rise, Zaki\nlooked back.\n\n\"There are some horsemen in pursuit, my lord. They have evidently come\nfrom Abu Klea.\"\n\nGregory looked round.\n\n\"There are about fifteen of them,\" he said. \"However, they are a good\nthree miles behind, and it will be dark in another half hour. As soon\nas it is so, we will turn off to the right or left, and so throw them\noff our track. Don't hurry your horse. The animals have made a very\nlong journey, since we started, and we shall want them badly tomorrow.\"\n\nIn another half hour the sun went down. Darkness comes on quickly in\nthe Soudan, and in another quarter of an hour they had lost sight of\ntheir pursuers, who had gained about a mile upon them.\n\n\"Another five minutes, Zaki, to allow for their eyes being better than\nours. Which way do you think we had better turn?\"\n\n\"I should say to the left, my lord. There is another caravan route from\nMetemmeh to Ambukol. It cannot be more than fifteen miles to the west.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything about it?\"\n\n\"I have never been along there. It is a shorter route than the one to\nKorti, but not so much used, I believe, because the wells cannot be\nrelied upon.\"\n\n\"Well, I feel sure we shall not be able to get at the wells on the\nother line, so we had better take that. As we shall be fairly safe from\npursuit, we may as well bear towards the northwest. By doing so we\nshall be longer in striking the track, but the journey will be a good\nbit shorter than if we were to ride due west.\n\n\"Now we can safely dismount. It is getting pitch dark, and we will lead\nour horses. I can feel that mine is nearly dead beat. In a few minutes\nwe will halt, and give them half a gourd full of water, each. After\nthat, we had better go on for another six or seven miles, so as to be\nwell out of sight of anyone on the hills.\"\n\nTen minutes later they heard the dull sound of horses' hoofs on the\nsand. They waited five minutes, until it died away in the distance, and\nthen continued their course. It was slow work, as they had to avoid\nevery bush carefully; lest, if their pursuers halted, they should hear\nthe crackling of a dry stick in the still air. Zaki, who could see much\nbetter in the dark than his master, went on ahead; while Gregory led\nthe two horses.\n\nA good hour passed before they stopped. They gave the horses a scanty\ndrink, and took a mouthful or two each; and then, throwing themselves\ndown, allowed the horses to crop the scanty herbage.\n\nAfter four hours' halt they pursued their way on foot for three hours,\nlaying their course by the stars. They calculated that they must have\ngone a good fifteen miles from the point where they turned off, and\nfeared that they might miss the caravan track, if they went on before\ndaybreak.\n\n\n\nChapter 9: Safely Back.\n\n\nAs soon as the sun was up they pursued their journey, Gregory's compass\nbeing now available.\n\nIn half an hour, Zaki said, \"There is a sign of the track, my lord,\"\nand he pointed to the skeleton of a camel.\n\n\"How many more miles do you think we have to go, Zaki?\"\n\n\"We must be a good half way, my lord.\"\n\n\"Yes, quite that, I should think. Looking at the map, I should say that\nwe must be about abreast of the line of Gakdul. This route is only just\nindicated, and there are no halting places marked upon it. Still, there\nmust be water, otherwise caravans could not use it. We have about sixty\nmiles farther to go, so that if the horses were fresh we might be there\nthis evening; but as it is, we have still two, if not three days'\njourney before us.\n\n\"Well, we must hope that we shall find some water. Just let the horses\nwet their mouths; we can keep on for a bit, before we have a drink.\n\n\"How much more is there left?\" he asked, after the lad had given a\nlittle water to each horse.\n\n\"Not above two gourdfuls.\"\n\n\"Well, we must ride as far as we can and, at any rate, must keep one\ngourdful for tomorrow. If we cover twenty-five miles today--and I don't\nthink the horses can do more--we can manage, if they are entirely done\nup, to walk the other thirty-five miles. However, as I said, there must\nbe wells, and even if they are dry, we may be able to scratch the sand\nout and find a little water. What food have we got?\"\n\n\"Only about two pounds of dates.\"\n\n\"That is a poor supply for two days, Zaki, but we must make the best of\nthem. We will only eat a few today, so as to have a fair meal in the\nmorning. We shall want it, if we have to walk thirty-five miles over\nthe sand.\"\n\n\"It will not be all sand,\" Zaki said; \"there is grass for the last\nfifteen miles, near the river; and there were cultivated fields about\nten miles out, before the Dervishes came.\"\n\n\"That is better. Now we will be moving.\"\n\nThe herbage the horses had cropped during the halt had served, to a\ncertain degree, to supply the place of water; and they proceeded at a\nbrisker pace than Gregory had expected.\n\n\"Keep a sharp lookout for water. Even if the wells are dry, you will\nsee a difference in the growth of the bushes round them; and as it is\ncertain that this route has not been used for some time, there may even\nbe grass.\"\n\nThey rode on at an easy canter, and avoided pressing the horses in the\nslightest degree, allowing them to walk whenever they chose. The heat\nwas very great, and after four hours' riding Gregory called a halt.\n\n\"We must have done twenty miles,\" he said. \"The bushes look green about\nhere, and the horses have got something of a feed.\"\n\n\"I think this must be one of the old halting places,\" Zaki said,\nlooking round as they dismounted. \"See, my lord, there are some broken\ngourds, and some rags scattered about.\"\n\n\"So there are,\" Gregory said. \"We will take the bridles out of the\nhorses' mouths, so that they can chew the leaves up better; and then we\nwill see if we can find where the wells were.\"\n\nTwenty yards farther away they found a deep hole.\n\n\"This was one of them,\" the lad said, \"but it is quite dry. See, there\nis an old bucket lying at the bottom. I will look about; there may be\nsome more of them.\"\n\nTwo others were discovered, and the sand at the bottom of one of them\nlooked a somewhat darker colour than the others.\n\n\"Well, we will dig here,\" Gregory said. \"Bring down those two half\ngourds; they will help us to shovel the sand aside.\"\n\nThe bottom of the hole was some six feet across, and they set to work\nin the middle of it. By the time they had got down two feet, the sand\nwas soft and clammy.\n\n\"We will get to water, Zaki, if we have to stay here all day!\" said\nGregory.\n\nIt was hard work, and it was not until after four hours' toil that, to\ntheir delight, they found the sand wet under their feet. They had taken\nit by turns to use the scoop, for the labour of making the hole large\nenough for them both to work at once would have been excessive.\n\nIn another hour there was half an inch of water in the hole. Gregory\ntook a gourd, and buried it in the soft soil until the water flowed in\nover the brim.\n\n\"Give me the other one down, Zaki. I will fill that, too, and then we\nwill both start drinking together.\"\n\nFive minutes later, the two took a long draught. The scoops were then\nrefilled and carried to the horses, who drank with an eagerness that\nshowed how great was their thirst. Three times the gourds were filled,\nand emptied.\n\n\"Now hand me down that water bag.\"\n\nThis was half filled, and then, exhausted with their work, they threw\nthemselves down and slept for some hours. When they awoke, the sun was\nsetting.\n\n\"Bring up the horses, Zaki. Let them drink as much as they like.\"\n\nThe gourds had each to be filled six times, before the animals were\nsatisfied. The riders then took another deep drink, ate a handful of\ndates, and mounted.\n\n\"We are safe now, and only have to fear a band of marauding Arabs; and\nit would be hard luck, were we to fall in with them. We had better ride\nslowly for the first hour or so. We must not press the horses, after\nthey have had such a drink.\"\n\n\"Very well, master.\"\n\n\"There is no particular reason for hurry, and even if we miss the trail\nwe know that, by keeping straight on, we shall strike the river\nsomewhere near Korti or Ambukol.\"\n\nFor an hour they went at a walk, and then the horses broke into their\nusual pace, of their own accord. It was getting dark, now, and soon\neven Zaki could not make out the track.\n\n\"The horses will keep to it, my lord,\" he said; \"their sight is a great\ndeal better than ours, and I dare say their smell may have something to\ndo with it. Besides, the track is clear of bushes, so we should know at\nonce, if they strayed from it.\"\n\nThey rode for five hours, and then felt that the horses were beginning\nto fag.\n\n\"We will halt here,\" Gregory said. \"We certainly cannot be more than\nfive-and-twenty miles from the river; and, if we start at dawn, shall\nbe there before the heat of the day begins. We can have another handful\nof dates, and give the horses a handful each, and that will leave us a\nfew for the morning.\"\n\nThe horses, after being given the dates, were again turned loose; and\nit was not long before they were heard pulling the leaves off bushes.\n\n\"Our case is a good deal better this evening than it was yesterday,\"\nGregory said. \"Then it looked as if it would be rather a close thing,\nfor I am sure the horses could not have gone much farther, if we had\nnot found the water. I wish we had a good feed to give them.\"\n\n\"They will do very well on the bushes, my lord. They get little else,\nwhen they are with the Arabs; a handful of durra, occasionally, when\nthey are at work; but at other times they only get what they can pick\nup. If their master is a good one, they may get a few dates. They will\ncarry us briskly enough to the river, tomorrow.\"\n\nThey did not talk long, and were soon sound asleep. Zaki was the first\nto wake.\n\n\"Day is just breaking, master.\"\n\n\"You don't say so!\" Gregory grumbled, sleepily. \"It seems to me that we\nhave only just lain down.\"\n\nThey ate the remainder of their dates, took a drink of water, and gave\ntwo gourdfuls to the horses; and, in a quarter of an hour, were on\ntheir way again. They had ridden but two or three miles, when Zaki\nexclaimed:\n\n\"There are some horsemen!\"\n\n\"Eight of them, Zaki, and they are evidently riding to cut us off! As\nfar as I can see, only four of them have guns; the others have spears.\n\n\"I think we can manage them. With my breech-loader I can fire two shots\nto their one, and we have pistols, as well.\"\n\nThe Arabs drew up ahead of them, and remained quiet there until the\nothers came to within fifty yards, and checked their horses. A man who\nappeared to be the leader of the party shouted the usual salutation, to\nwhich Gregory replied.\n\nThe leader said, \"Where are my friends going and why do they halt?\"\n\n\"We are on a mission. We wish to see if the infidels are still at\nAmbukol.\"\n\n\"For that you will not want guns,\" the man said, \"and we need them\nbadly. I beg of you to give them to us.\"\n\n\"They may be of use to us. We may come upon infidel scouts.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, my friends, you must hand them over to us. We are, as\nyou see, eight, and you are only two. The law of the desert is that the\nstronger take, and the weaker lose.\"\n\n\"It may be so, sometimes,\" Gregory said quietly, \"but not in this case.\nI advise you to ride your way, and we will ride ours.\"\n\nThen he said to Zaki, \"Dismount and stand behind your horse, and fire\nover the saddle; but don't fire the first shot now.\"\n\nHe threw himself from his saddle. Scarcely had he done so when four\nshots were fired, and Gregory took a steady aim at the chief. The\nlatter threw up his arms, and fell. With a yell of fury, the others\ndashed forward. Zaki did not fire until they were within twenty yards,\nand directly afterwards Gregory fired again. There were now but five\nassailants.\n\n\"Now for your pistols, Zaki!\" he cried, glancing round for the first\ntime.\n\nHe then saw why Zaki had not fired when he first did so--his horse was\nlying dead in front of him, shot through the head.\n\n\"Stand by me! Don't throw away a shot! You take the man on the other\nside of the horse. I will take the others.\"\n\nSteadily the four pistols were fired. As the Arabs rode up, two of them\nfell, and another was wounded. Dismayed at the loss of so many of their\nnumber, the three survivors rode off at full speed.\n\n\"Are you hurt, Zaki?\"\n\n\"A spear grazed my cheek, my lord; that is all. It was my own fault. I\nkept my last barrel too long. However, it tumbled him over.\n\n\"Are you hurt, master?\"\n\n\"I have got a ball in the shoulder. That fellow without a spear has got\npistols, and fired just as I did; or rather, an instant before. That\nshook my aim, but he has a ball in him, somewhere.\n\n\"Just see if they have got some dates on their saddles,\" for the horses\nof the fallen men had remained by the side of their masters' bodies.\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Zaki said, examining them. \"Two bags, nearly full.\"\n\n\"That is satisfactory. Pick out the best horse for yourself, and then\nwe will ride on. But before we go, we will break the stocks of these\nfour guns, and carry the barrels off, and throw them into the bushes, a\nmile or two away.\"\n\nAs soon as this was done, they mounted and rode on. They halted in a\nquarter of an hour and, after Gregory's arm had been bound tightly to\nhis side with his sash, both they and their horses had a good meal of\ndates. Then they rode on again, and in three hours saw some white tents\nahead.\n\nThere was a slight stir as they were seen coming, and a dozen black\nsoldiers sprang up and ran forward, fixing bayonets as they did so.\n\n\"We are friends!\" Gregory shouted, in Arabic; and Zaki repeated the\nshout in his own language.\n\nThe soldiers looked doubtful, and stood together in a group. They knew\nthat the Dervishes were sometimes ready to throw away their own lives,\nif they could but kill some of their enemy.\n\nOne of them shouted back, \"Stay where you are until I call an officer!\"\n\nHe went back to the tents, and returned with a white officer, whom\nGregory at once recognized as one of those who had come up with him\nfrom Wady Halfa.\n\n\"Leslie,\" he shouted in English, \"will you kindly call off your\nsoldiers? One of their muskets might go off, accidentally. I suppose\nyou don't remember me. I am Hilliard, who came up with you in the\nsteamer.\"\n\nThe officer had stopped in astonishment, at hearing this seeming\nDervish address him, by name, in English. He then advanced, giving an\norder to his men to fall back.\n\n\"Is it really you, Hilliard?\" he said, as he approached the horsemen,\nwho were coming forward at a walk. \"Which of you is it? For I don't see\nany resemblance, in either of you.\"\n\n\"It is I, Leslie. I am not surprised that you don't know me.\"\n\n\"But what are you masquerading for, in this dress; and where have you\ncome from?\"\n\n\"Perhaps I had better not say, Leslie. I have been doing some scouting\nacross the desert, with my boy here. We have had a long ride. In the\nfirst place, my arm wants attending to. I have a bullet in the\nshoulder. The next thing we need is something to eat; for the last\nthree days we have had nothing but dates, and not too many of them.\n\n\"Is there any chance of getting taken up to Merawi? We came down from\nthere to Korti, in a native vessel.\"\n\n\"Yes; a gunboat with some native craft will be going up this afternoon.\nI will give orders, at once, that your horses shall be put on board.\"\n\nWhen the ball had been extracted from his shoulder, and the wound\ndressed and bandaged by the surgeon in charge, Gregory went up to the\ntents again, where he was warmly received by the three white officers\nof the Negro regiment. Breakfast already had been prepared, Zaki being\nhanded over to the native officers. After having made a hearty meal,\nGregory related the adventure with the Arabs in the desert, merely\nsaying that they had found there were no Dervishes at Gakdul.\n\n\"But why didn't you go straight back, instead of coming down here?\"\n\n\"I wanted to see whether this line was open, and whether there were any\nwells on it. We only found one, and it took us four or five hours' hard\nwork to get at the water. It is lucky, indeed, that we did so; for our\nhorses were getting very done up, and I had begun to think that they\nwould not reach our destination alive.\"\n\nIn the afternoon, the adventurers started with the boats going up to\nMerawi and, the next morning, arrived at the camp. The Dervish patches\nhad been removed from their clothes, as soon as they arrived at\nAmbukol. Gregory could have borrowed a white suit there; but as the\nstain on his skin, although somewhat lighter than when first put on,\nwas too dark, he declined the offer.\n\n\"No one may notice me as I land, now,\" he said, \"but everyone would\nstare at a man with a brown face and white uniform.\"\n\nLeaving Zaki to get the horses on shore, Gregory went straight to the\nGeneral's quarters. He told the sentry that he wished to see the\nGeneral, on business.\n\n\"You cannot go in,\" the man said. \"The General is engaged.\"\n\n\"If you send in word to him that his messenger has returned, I am sure\nhe will see me.\"\n\n\"You can sit down here, then,\" the sentry said. \"When the officer with\nhim comes out, I will give your message to his orderly.\"\n\nGregory, however, was in no humour to be stopped; and in an\nauthoritative voice called, \"Orderly!\"\n\nA soldier came down directly from the guard room.\n\n\"Tell the General, at once, that Mr. Hilliard has returned.\"\n\nWith a look of wonder, the orderly went into the tent. Half a minute\nlater, he returned.\n\n\"You are to come in,\" he said.\n\nAs the General had seen Gregory in his disguise, before starting, he of\ncourse recognized him.\n\n\"My dear Hilliard,\" he said, getting up and shaking him cordially by\nthe hand, \"I am heartily glad to see you back. You have been frequently\nin my thoughts; and though I had every confidence in your sharpness, I\nhave regretted, more than once, that I allowed you to go.\n\n\"I suppose you failed to get there. It is hardly possible that you\nshould have done so, in the time. I suppose, when you got to Gakdul,\nyou learned that the Dervishes were at Abu Klea.\"\n\n\"They were at Abu Klea, General; but I made a detour, and got into\ntheir camp at Metemmeh.\"\n\n\"You did, and have returned safely! I congratulate you, most warmly.\n\n\"I told you, Macdonald,\" he said, turning to the officer with whom he\nhad been engaged, \"that I had the greatest hope that Mr. Hilliard would\nget through. He felt so confident in himself that I could scarce help\nfeeling confidence in him, too.\"\n\n\"He has done well, indeed!\" Colonel Macdonald said. \"I should not have\nliked to send any of my officers on such an adventure, though they have\nbeen here for years.\"\n\n\"Well, will you sit down, Mr. Hilliard,\" the General said, \"and give us\na full account? In the first place, what you have learned? And in the\nsecond, how you have learned it?\"\n\nGregory related the conversations he had heard among the soldiers; and\nthen that of Mahmud's brother and the commander of the Dervish cavalry.\nThen he described the events of his journey there, his narrow escape\nfrom capture, and the pursuit by the Dervishes at Abu Klea; how he gave\nthem the slip, struck the Ambukol caravan road, had a fight with a band\nof robber Arabs, and finally reached the Egyptian camp.\n\n\"An excellently managed business!\" the General said, warmly. \"You have\ncertainly had some narrow escapes, and seem to have adopted the only\ncourse by which you could have got off safely. The information you have\nbrought is of the highest importance. I shall telegraph, at once, to\nthe Sirdar that there will assuredly be no advance on the part of\nMahmud from Metemmeh; which will leave him free to carry out the plans\nhe has formed. I shall of course, in my written despatch, give him full\nparticulars of the manner in which I have obtained that information.\"\n\n\"It was a very fine action,\" Macdonald agreed. \"The lad has shown that\nhe has a good head, as well as great courage.\n\n\"You will make your way, Mr. Hilliard--that is, if you don't try this\nsort of thing again. A man may get through it once, but it would be\njust tempting providence to try it a second time.\"\n\n\"Now, Mr. Hilliard,\" the General said, \"you had best go to your\nquarters. I will ask the surgeon to attend to you, at once. You must\nkeep quiet, and do no more duty until you are discharged from the sick\nlist.\"\n\nTen days later, orders were issued that the brigade under Macdonald;\nconsisting of the 3rd Egyptians, and the 9th, 10th, and 11th Soudanese,\ntogether with a mule battery; were to move forward the next day to\nKassinger, the advanced post some ten miles higher up the river. This\nseemed only a preliminary step, and the general opinion was that\nanother fortnight would elapse before there would be a general\nmovement.\n\nA reconnaissance with friendly Arabs had, however, been made ahead\ntowards Abu Hamed, and had obtained certain information that the\ngarrison at that place was by no means a strong one. The information\nGregory had gathered had shown that Mahmud had no intention of\nadvancing against Merawi; and that no reinforcements had, as yet,\nstarted to join the force at Abu Hamed; the Dervish leader being\nconvinced that the Nile was not yet high enough to admit of boats going\nup the cataract.\n\nThus, everything favoured the Sirdar's plan to capture Abu Hamed, and\nenable the railway to be constructed to that place before Mahmud could\nreceive the news that the troops were in motion. He therefore directed\nGeneral Hunter to push forward, with only one brigade, leaving the rest\nto hold Merawi; and ordered the camel corps, and the friendly Arabs, to\nadvance across the desert as far as the Gakdul wells, where their\nappearance would lead Mahmud to believe that they were the advance\nguard of the coming army.\n\nTwo days later Gregory, on going to the headquarters tent, was told\nthat General Hunter and his staff would start, in an hour's time, to\ninspect the camp at Kassinger.\n\n\"Do you think you are fit to ride?\" the chief of the staff asked him.\n\n\"Perfectly, sir. The doctor discharged me yesterday as fit for duty,\nbut advised me to keep my arm in a sling, for a time.\"\n\n\"In that case, you may accompany us.\n\n\"It is a little uncertain when we shall return,\" the officer said, with\na smile; \"therefore I advise you to take all your belongings with you.\nHave them packed up quietly. We do not wish any suspicions to arise\nthat we are not returning this evening.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir!\" Gregory said, gratefully. \"I shall be ready to start\nin an hour.\"\n\nHe returned in high glee to his hut, for he felt certain that an\nimmediate advance was about to take place.\n\n\"Zaki,\" he said, \"I am going to ride with the General; and, as it is\npossible I may be stationed at Kassinger for a short time, you had\nbetter get the camel brought up, and start as soon as you have packed\nthe things on it. I am going to ride over with the staff, in an hour,\nand shall overtake you by the way. How long will you be?\"\n\n\"Half an hour, bey.\"\n\n\"I will be there by that time, and will take my horse; then you can go\non with the camel.\"\n\nBehind the headquarter camp the work of packing up was also going on;\nthe camels being sent off in threes and fours, as they were laden, so\nas to attract no attention. Half an hour later the General came out,\nand without delay started with the staff, Captain Fitton remaining\nbehind to see that the rest of the stores were sent off, and a small\ntent for the use of the General. All heavy packages were to be taken up\nby water.\n\nThe arrival of the General at Kassinger excited no surprise, as he had\nridden over the day before; but when, in the afternoon, orders were\nissued that the camels should all be laden, in preparation for a march\nthat evening; the Soudanese could with difficulty be restrained from\ngiving vent to their exuberant joy that, at length, their long halt was\nat an end, and they were to have another chance of getting at the\nenemy.\n\nA large train of camels had been quietly collected at Kassinger,\nsufficient to carry the necessary supplies for the use of the column,\nfor some three weeks' time; and it was hoped that, before long, the\ngunboats and many of the native craft, with stores, would join them at\nAbu Hamed.\n\nThe force started at sunset. The distance to be travelled was a hundred\nand eighteen miles, and the road was a very difficult one. The ground\nrose steeply, almost from the edge of the river; and at times had to be\ntraversed in single file.\n\nAs night came on, the scene was a weird one. On one side the rocky\nascent rose, black and threatening. On the other, the river rushed\nfoaming, only broken by the rocks and little islands of the cataract.\n\nGregory had been ordered to remain with the camel train; to keep them,\nas much as possible, together, and prevent wide gaps from occurring in\nthe ranks. It was tedious work; and the end of the train did not\narrive, until broad daylight, at the spot where the infantry halted. He\nat once told Zaki to pitch his little tent, which he had already shown\nhim how to do, while he went to see if there were any orders at\nheadquarters.\n\nHe found the staff were just sitting down to a rough breakfast. Being\ntold, after the meal, that he would not be wanted during the day; but\nthat at night he was to continue his work with the camels; he went back\nto his tent, and threw himself on his bed. But, in spite of the fly\nbeing fastened up, and a blanket thrown over the tent, the heat was so\ngreat that he was only able to doze off occasionally.\n\nHe observed that even the black troops suffered from the heat. They had\nerected screens, with their blankets placed end to end, supported by\ntheir guns; and lay there, getting what air there was, and sheltered\nfrom the direct rays of the sun. Few slept. Most of them talked, or\nsmoked.\n\nThere was some argument, among the officers, as to the relative\nadvantages of night and day marches. All agreed that, if only one march\nhad to be done, it was better to do it at night; but when, as in the\npresent case, it would last for seven or eight days, many thought that,\nterrible as would be the heat, it would be better to march in the day,\nand permit the troops to sleep at night. This opinion certainly seemed\nto be justified; for, at the end of the third day, the men were so\ncompletely worn out from want of sleep that they stumbled as they\nmarched; and were with difficulty restrained from throwing themselves\ndown, to get the much-needed rest.\n\nGregory always went down, as soon as the column arrived at its halting\nplace, as he did before starting in the evening, to bathe in some quiet\npool or backwater; and, much as he had set himself against taking\nspirits, he found that he was unable to eat his meals, unless he took a\nspoonful or two with his water, or cold tea.\n\nOn the evening of the third day, they passed the battlefield of\nKirkeban, where General Earle fell when the River Expedition was\nattacked by the Dervishes. Next day they halted at Hebbeh, where\nColonel Stewart, on his way down with a number of refugees from\nKhartoum, was treacherously murdered. A portion of the steamer was\nstill visible in the river.\n\nDay after day the column plodded on, for the most part strung out in\nsingle file, the line extending over many miles; and, late on the\nevening of the 6th of August, they reached a spot within a mile and a\nhalf of Abu Hamed, the hundred and eighteen miles having been\naccomplished in seven days and a half.\n\nSo far as they knew, the enemy had, as yet, received no news of their\napproach. Three hours' rest was given the troops, and then they marched\nout, in order of battle.\n\nA fair idea of the position had been obtained from the friendly\nnatives. Abu Hamed lay on the river. The desert sloped gradually down\nto it, on all sides; with a sharp, deep descent within two hundred\nyards of the town. The houses were all loopholed, for defence.\n\nWhen within a mile of the town, they must have been sighted by the\nDervish sentries on a lofty watchtower. No movement, however, was\nvisible, and there was a general feeling of disappointment, as the\nimpression gained ground that the enemy had retreated. The 9th and 10th\nSoudanese made a sweep round, to attack from the desert side. The 11th,\nand half of the Egyptian battalion--the other half having been left to\nguard the baggage--followed the course of the river.\n\nMajor Kincaid rode forward, to the edge of the steep slope that looked\ndown to the town. He could see no one moving about. The Dervish\ntrenches, about eighty yards away, appeared empty; and he was about to\nwrite a message to the General, saying that the place was deserted,\nwhen a sharp fire suddenly opened upon him. He turned to ride back to\nwarn the General, but he was too late; for, at the same moment, Hunter\nwith his staff galloped up to the edge of the slope, and was\nimmediately saluted by a heavy volley; which, however, was fired so\nwildly that none of the party was hit.\n\nThe artillery were now ordered to bombard the place. At first, they\ncould only fire at the tops of the houses; but, changing their\nposition, they found a spot where they could command the town. For half\nan hour this continued. The infantry were drawn up just beyond the\nbrow, where they could not be seen by the defenders. The Dervishes gave\nno signs of life, and as the artillery could not depress their guns\nsufficiently to enable them to rake the trenches, the infantry were\nordered to charge.\n\nAs soon as they reached the edge of the dip, a storm of musketry broke\nout from the Dervish trenches, but, fortunately, the greater portion of\nthe bullets flew overhead. Macdonald had intended to carry the place at\nthe point of the bayonet, without firing; but the troops, suddenly\nexposed to such a storm of musketry, halted and opened fire without\norders; the result being that they suffered a great deal more than they\nwould have done, had they crossed the eighty yards, which divided them\nfrom the trench, by a rush. Standing, as they did, against the skyline,\nthe Dervishes were able to pick them off; they themselves showing only\ntheir heads above the trenches. Two of the mounted officers of the 10th\nwere killed, and two had their horses shot under them.\n\nMacdonald and his officers rushed along in front of the line, knocking\nup the men's muskets; and abusing them, in the strongest terms, for\ntheir disobedience to orders. The moment the fire ceased, the troops\nrushed forward; and the Dervishes at once abandoned their trenches, and\nran back to the line of houses. These were crowded together, divided by\nnarrow winding lanes, and here a desperate struggle took place.\n\nThe Dervishes defended themselves with the greatest tenacity, sometimes\nrushing out and hurling themselves upon their assailants, and defending\nthe houses to the last, making a stand when the doors were burst open,\nuntil the last of the inmates were either shot or bayoneted. So\ndetermined was the defense of some of the larger houses, that it was\nnecessary to bring up the guns and batter an entrance. Many of the\nhouses were found, when the troops burst in, to be tenanted only by\ndead; for the Soudanese always heralded their attack by firing several\nvolleys, and the bullets made their way through and through the mud\nwalls, as if they had been paper.\n\nAbout seventy or eighty horsemen and a hundred Dervish infantry\nescaped, but the rest were either killed or made prisoners, together\nwith Mahomed Zein, the governor. A quantity of arms, camels, and horses\nwere also captured. The loss on our side was two British officers\nkilled, and twenty-one of the black troops; and three Egyptian\nofficers, and sixty-one men wounded.\n\nWhen the convoy halted, previous to the troops marching to the attack,\nGregory, whose duties with the baggage had now ended, joined the\nGeneral's staff and rode forward with them. Hunter had glanced round,\nas he rode up, and answered with a nod when he saluted, and asked if he\ncould come.\n\nHe felt rather scared on the Dervishes opening fire so suddenly, when\nthe General's impatience had led him to ride forward, without waiting\nfor Major Kincaid's report. After the troops rushed into the town, the\nGeneral maintained his position at the edge of the dip, for the narrow\nstreets were so crowded with men that a group of horsemen could hardly\nhave forced their way in, and it would be impossible to see what was\ngoing on, and to issue orders.\n\nMahomed Zein had not followed the example of some of his followers, and\ndied fighting to the last. He was found hiding under a bed, and was\nbrought before General Hunter; who asked him why he fought, when he\nmust have known that it was useless; to which he replied:\n\n\"I knew that you had only three times as many as I had, and every one\nof my men is worth four of yours. You could not fire till you were\nquite close up, and at that range our rifles are as good as yours.\"\n\nThe General asked what he thought Mahmud would do, to which he replied:\n\n\"He will be down here in five days, and wipe you out!\"\n\nIt was necessary to halt at Abu Hamed, until stores came up. Captain\nKeppel, Royal Navy, and the officers commanding the gunboats were\ntoiling at the cataracts to bring them up. Nevertheless one of these\nwas capsized, and only three got through safely. Major Pink, with a\nlarge number of troops from Merawi, succeeded in hauling the sailing\nboats through.\n\nA large column of laden camels was, at the same time, being pushed\nforward by the caravan route from Korosko. It was a time of much\nanxiety, till stores began to arrive; for, had Mahmud advanced at once,\nthe passage up the river would have been arrested, and the land column\ncut off; in which case the little force would have been reduced to sore\nstraits, as they must have stood on the defensive until reinforcements\nreached them.\n\nThere was, too, some anxiety as to the safety of the forces at Ambukol\nand Korti; for Mahmud, on learning that the garrisons had been weakened\nby the despatch of troops to Abu Hamed, might have crossed the desert\nwith all his force and fallen upon them. Mahmud had indeed, as it\nturned out, believed that the expedition to Abu Hamed was only\nundertaken to cover the flank of the Egyptian army from attack, from\nthat quarter; and still believed that it was from Merawi that the main\nBritish force would advance against him.\n\nBefore the supplies had all arrived, the position changed; as news came\nthat Berber was being evacuated by the Dervishes. The information was\ntelegraphed to the Sirdar, who at once ordered that a force of the\nfriendly Arabs, escorted by a gunboat, should go up to Berber to find\nif the news was true. One gunboat had already arrived, and General\nHunter decided on going up in her himself. Two hundred of the Arabs,\nunder Ahmed Bey, were to ride along the bank. They were to be mounted\non the fastest camels that could be picked out; so that, if they\nencountered the Dervishes, they would have a fair chance of escaping,\nand getting under cover of the gunboat's fire.\n\n\"Mr. Hilliard,\" the General said, \"I shall be obliged if you will\naccompany Ahmed Bey. The Arabs are always more steady, if they have an\nEnglish officer with them. They will be ready to start in an hour. A\nsignaller from the 11th Soudanese shall go with you; and you can\nnotify, to us, the approach of any strong party of the enemy, and their\ndirection; so that the gunboat can send a shell or two among them, as a\nhint that they had better keep out of range.\"\n\nAs his baggage camel was by no means a fast one, Gregory at first\ndecided to leave it behind in charge of Zaki; but on going across to\nthe Arab camp, Ahmed Bey at once offered to place a fast one at his\ndisposal. He accordingly sent his own animal into the transport yard,\ncommitted the heavy wooden case, with the greater portion of his\nremaining stores, to the charge of the sergeant of the mess, retaining\nonly three or four tins of preserved milk, some tea, four or five tins\nof meat, a bottle of brandy, and a few other necessaries. To these were\nadded half a sheep and a few pounds of rice. These, with his tent and\nother belongings, were packed on the Arab camel; and Zaki rode beside\nit with great satisfaction, for he had been greatly cast down when his\nmaster first told him that he would have to remain behind. All the\npreparations were made in great haste, but they were completed just as\nAhmed Bey moved out of his camp, with his two hundred picked men and\ncamels.\n\nFive minutes later, a whistle from the steamer told them that General\nHunter, and the party with him, were also on the point of starting. The\ndistance to be traversed to Berber was a hundred and thirty miles, and\nthe expedition was undoubtedly a hazardous one. Even if the news was\ntrue, that the five thousand Dervishes who had been holding Berber had\nevacuated the town, it was quite possible that a part of the force had\nbeen sent down the river, to oppose any advance that might be made; or,\nif unable to do this, to carry the news of the advance to Mahmud. The\nArabs were to keep abreast of the gunboat; and would, where the shores\nwere flat, be covered by its guns. But at spots where the ground was\nhigh and precipitous, this assistance could scarcely avail them in case\nof an attack, unless the hundred soldiers on board the steamer could be\nlanded.\n\nAs they rode along, Ahmed Bey explained to Gregory the plan that he\nshould adopt, if they were attacked in such a position, and found their\nretreat cut off.\n\n\"The camels will all be made to lie down, and we shall fight behind\nthem, as in an entrenchment. My men are all armed with rifles the\ngovernment has given them, and we could beat off an attack by a great\nnumber; while, if we were on our camels and pursued, we should soon\nlose all order, and our shooting would be bad.\"\n\n\"I think that would be by far the best plan, sheik. Your two hundred\nmen, and the hundred the gunboat could land, ought to be able to make a\ntough fight of it, against any number of the enemy.\n\n\"How long do you think we shall be, on the way?\"\n\n\"About four days. The camels can easily travel thirty-five miles a day.\nWe have six days' provisions with us, in case the gunboat cannot make\nits way up. Fortunately we have not to carry water, so that each camel\nonly takes twenty pounds of food, for its rider; and forty pounds of\ngrain, for itself. If we were pursued, we could throw that away, as we\nshould only have to ride to some point where the gunboat could protect\nus. We could not hope to escape by speed, for the Dervishes could ride\nand run quite as fast as the camels could go.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 10: Afloat.\n\n\nThe first three days' journey passed without any adventure. From the\nnatives who still remained in the little villages they passed, they\nlearned that the report that the Dervishes had left Berber was\ngenerally believed; but whether they had marched for Metemmeh, or for\nsome other point, was unknown. The people were delighted to see the\ngunboat; as, until its arrival, they had been in hourly fear of raiding\nparties. They had heard of the capture of Abu Hamed, by the British,\nfrom horsemen who had escaped; but all these had said, confidently,\nthat Mahmud would speedily drive them out again; and they had been in\nhourly fear that the Dervishes would swoop down upon them, and carry\noff the few possessions still remaining to them.\n\nWhen within thirty miles of Berber the Arabs had halted on the bank,\nwatching the gunboat as, with great difficulty, it made its way up a\ncataract. Suddenly it was seen to stop, and a great bustle was observed\non board. An exclamation of grief burst from the Arabs.\n\n\"She has struck on a rock!\" Ahmed Bey exclaimed.\n\n\"I am afraid she has,\" said Gregory; who had, all along, ridden by his\nside at the head of the party. \"I am afraid so. I hope she is not\ninjured.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the damage was serious. A hole had been knocked through\nher side, under water, and the water poured in, in volumes. A rush was\nmade by those on board; and beds, pillows, and blankets were stuffed\ninto the hole. This succeeded, to some extent, and she was brought\nalongside the bank.\n\nThe sheik and Gregory went down to meet her. General Hunter came to the\nside.\n\n\"A large hole has been knocked in her,\" he said, to the sheik. \"We\nshall have to get the guns and stores on shore, to lighten her; and\nthen heel her over, to get at the hole. It will certainly take two or\nthree days; by that time, I hope, the other gunboat will be up.\n\n\"In the meantime, you must go on to Berber. I think there can be no\ndoubt that the Dervishes have all left, but it is most important that\nwe should know it, for certain. You must push straight on, and as soon\nas you arrive there, send word on to me by the fastest camel you have.\nIf you are attacked, you will, of course, defend yourselves. Take up a\nposition close to the river, and hold it until you are relieved. If you\ncan send off news to me by a camel, do so; if not, seize a boat--there\nare some at every village--and send the news down by water. I will come\non at once, with everyone here, to assist you.\"\n\n\"I will do as you order,\" the sheik said; \"and if you see us no more,\nyou will know that we died as brave men.\"\n\n\"I hope there is no fear of that,\" the General said, cheerfully. \"You\nwill defend yourselves as brave men if you are attacked, I am sure; but\nas I am convinced that the Dervishes have left Berber, I think there is\nlittle fear of your falling in with them.\"\n\nThen he went on, in English, to Gregory.\n\n\"Keep them moving, Mr. Hilliard. Let them go as fast as they can. They\nare less likely to get nervous, if they are riding hard, than they\nwould be if they dawdled along. If they press their camels, they will\nbe in Berber this afternoon. See that a man starts at once, to bring me\nthe news.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir. I will keep them at it, if I can.\"\n\nThe sheik rejoined his band, which gathered round to hear the result of\nhis interview with the white general.\n\n\"The steamer is injured,\" he said, \"but she will soon be made right,\nand will follow us. We are to have the honour of going on and occupying\nBerber, and will show ourselves worthy of it. There is little chance of\nour meeting the Dervishes. Had they been in Berber, we should have\nheard of them before this. If we meet them we will fight; and you, Abu,\nwho have the fastest camel among us, will ride back here at all speed,\nand the General and his soldiers will come up to help us.\n\n\"Now, let us not waste a moment, but push forward. In five hours we\nshall be at Berber; and throughout your lives, you will be proud to say\nthat you were the first to enter the town that the Dervishes have so\nlong held.\"\n\nA few of the men waved their guns, and shouted. The rest looked grave.\nHowever, they obeyed their chief's orders, and the cavalcade at once\nstarted. As they did so, Gregory drew his horse up alongside Zaki.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, \"if we see the Dervishes coming in force, I shall\ncome to you, at once. You shall take my horse, it is faster than yours.\nI shall give you a note for the General, and you will ride back at full\ngallop, and give it to him. The horse is fast, and there will be no\nfear of their catching you, even if they chase; which they will not be\nlikely to do, as they will be thinking of attacking us.\"\n\n\"Very well, master. I will do as you order me, but I would rather stop\nand fight, by your side.\"\n\n\"That you may be able to do some other time, Zaki. This time, you have\ngot to fetch aid.\"\n\nThen he rode on to join the chief. There was no talking along the line,\nevery man had his rifle unslung and in his hand, every eye scanned the\ncountry. Hitherto, they had had unlimited faith in the power of the\ngunboat to protect them; now that they might have to face the Dervishes\nunaided, they felt the danger a serious one. They had come to fight the\nDervishes, and were ready to do so, in anything like equal numbers; but\nthe force they might meet would possibly be greatly stronger than their\nown--so strong that, although they might sell their lives dearly; they\nwould, in the end, be overpowered.\n\nFor the first three hours, the camels were kept going at the top of\ntheir speed; but as they neared Berber, there was a perceptible\nslackness. Ahmed Bey and Gregory rode backwards and forwards along the\nline, keeping them together, and encouraging them.\n\n\"We shall get in without fighting,\" the Bey said. \"We should have heard\nbefore this, had they been there. Do you think that they would have\nremained so long in the town, if they had learned that there are but\ntwo hundred of us, and one steamer? Mahmud would never have forgiven\nthem, had they not fallen upon us and annihilated us. I only hope that\ntwo hundred will have been left there. It will add to our glory, to\nhave won a battle, as well as taken the town. Your children will talk\nof it in their tents. Your women will be proud of you, and the men of\nthe black regiments will say that we have shown ourselves to be as\nbrave as they are.\n\n\"We will halt for half an hour, rest the camels, and then push on at\nfull speed again; but mind, you have my orders: if you should see the\nenemy coming in force, you are to ride at once to the river bank,\ndismount, and make the camels lie down in a semicircle; then we have\nbut to keep calm, and shoot straight, and we need not fear the\nDervishes, however many of them there may be.\"\n\nAfter the halt they again pushed forward. Gregory saw, with pleasure,\nthat the Arabs were now thoroughly wound up to fighting point. The same\nvigilant watch was kept up as before; but the air of gloom that had\nhung over them, when they first started, had now disappeared; each man\nwas ready to fight to the last. As the town was seen, the tension was\nat its highest; but the pace quickened, rather than relaxed.\n\n\"Now is the moment!\" the Bey shouted. \"If they are there, they will\ncome out to fight us. If, in five minutes, they do not appear; it will\nbe because they have all gone.\"\n\nBut there were no signs of the enemy, no clouds of dust rising in the\ntown, that would tell of a hasty gathering. At last, they entered a\nstraggling street. The women looked timidly from the windows; and then,\non seeing that their robes did not bear the black patches worn by the\nDervishes, they broke into loud cries of welcome.\n\n\"Are the Dervishes all gone?\" Ahmed Bey asked, reining in his camel.\n\n\"They are all gone. The last left four days ago.\"\n\nThe sheik waved his rifle over his head; and his followers burst into\nloud shouts of triumph, and pressed on, firing their muskets in the\nair. As they proceeded, the natives poured out from their houses in\nwild delight. The Arabs kept on, till they reached the house formerly\noccupied by the Egyptian governor.\n\n\"I should say that you had better take possession of this, Bey. There\nseems to be a large courtyard, where you can put your camels. It is not\nlikely that the Dervishes will return, but it is as well to be\nprepared. The house is strong, and we could hold out here against a\nhost, unless they were provided with cannon.\n\n\"I have money, and you had better buy up as much food as possible, so\nthat we could stand a siege for some time. I shall give my horse a good\nfeed and an hour's rest, and then send my man down to the General,\ntelling him that the Dervishes have deserted the town, and that we have\ntaken possession of the place, and can defend it for a long time should\nthey return.\"\n\nAn hour later, Zaki started with Gregory's report. The inhabitants,\nfinding that they would be paid, brought out their hidden stores; and\nby evening, enough was collected to last the garrison ten days.\n\nZaki returned at noon next day, with a letter from General Hunter to\nthe sheik, praising him highly for the energy and courage of his men\nand himself. He also brought a note for Gregory, saying that he hoped\nto get the repairs finished the next day; and that he expected, by that\ntime, the other two steamers would be up, when he should at once\nadvance to Berber.\n\nOn the third day the smoke of the steamers was seen in the distance;\nand an hour later the gunboats arrived, and were greeted with cries of\nwelcome by the natives, who thronged the bank. The three boats carried\nbetween three and four hundred men. These were disembarked on an\nisland, opposite the town, and the gunboats moored alongside.\n\nGeneral Hunter at once landed, with those of his staff who had\naccompanied him. He shook hands, very cordially, with the sheik.\n\n\"You have done well, indeed!\" he said. \"It was a dangerous enterprise\nand, had I not known your courage, and that of your men, I should not\nhave ventured to send you forward. You have fully justified my\nconfidence in you.\n\n\"In the first place, I will go and see the house you have occupied. I\nshall leave you still in possession of it, but I do not intend that you\nshould hold it. In case Mahmud comes down upon you, at once embark in\nboats, and cross to the islands. It will be some time before I can\ngather, here, a force strong enough to hold the town against attack.\nIndeed, it will probably be some weeks; for, until the railway is\nfinished to Abu Hamed, I can only get up stores sufficient for the men\nhere; certainly we have no transport that could keep up the supply for\nthe whole force. However, all this will be settled by the Sirdar, who\nwill very shortly be with us.\"\n\nIt was now the 6th of September and, the same afternoon, two gunboats\nwere sent up to Ed Damer, an important position lying a mile or two\nbeyond the junction of Atbara river with the Nile. On the opposite bank\nof the Nile, they found encamped the Dervishes who had retired from\nBerber. The guns opened fire upon them, and they retired inland;\nleaving behind them fourteen large boats, laden with grain. These were\nat once sent down to Berber, where they were most welcome; and a\nportion of the grain was distributed among the almost starving\npopulation, nearly five thousand in number, principally women and\nchildren.\n\nSupplies soon began to arrive from below, being brought up in native\ncraft, from Abu Hamed, as far as the cataract; then unloaded and\ncarried up past the rapids on camels; then again placed in boats, and\nso brought to Berber. Macdonald's brigade started a fortnight after the\noccupation, their place at Abu Hamed having been taken by a brigade\nfrom Kassinger, each battalion having towed up boats carrying two\nmonths' supply of provisions.\n\nA fort was now erected at the junction of the two rivers, and occupied\nby a small force, under an English officer. Two small steamers were\nemployed in towing the native craft from Abu Hamed to Berber. Still, it\nwas evident that it would be impossible to accumulate the necessary\nstores for the whole force that would take the field; accordingly, as\nsoon as the railway reached Abu Hamed, the Sirdar ordered it to be\ncarried on as far as Berber. He himself came up with Colonel Wingate,\nthe head of the Intelligence Department; and, diligently as all had\nworked before, their exertions were now redoubled.\n\nOn the morning after the Sirdar's arrival, an orderly came across to\nGeneral Hunter's quarters, with a request that Mr. Hilliard should at\nonce be sent to headquarters. Gregory had to wait nearly half an hour,\nuntil the officers who had been there before him had had their\naudience, and received their orders. He was then shown in.\n\n\"You have done very valuable service, Mr. Hilliard,\" the Sirdar said.\n\"Exceptionally valuable, and obtained at extraordinary risk. I\ncertainly did not expect, when I saw you a few months ago in Cairo,\nthat you would so speedily distinguish yourself. I was then struck with\nyour manner, and thought that you would do well, and you have much more\nthan fulfilled my expectations. I shall keep my eye upon you, and shall\nsee that you have every opportunity of continuing as you have begun.\"\n\nThat evening, General Hunter suggested to Colonel Wingate that Gregory\nshould be handed over to him.\n\n\"There will be nothing for him to do with me, at present,\" he said;\n\"and I am sure that you will find him very useful. Putting aside the\nexpedition he undertook to Metemmeh, he is a most zealous young\nofficer. Although his wound was scarcely healed, he took charge of the\nbaggage animals on the way up from Merawi to Abu Hamed, and came\nforward here with Ahmed Bey and his followers, and in both cases he was\nmost useful. But at the present, I cannot find any employment for him.\"\n\n\"I will have a talk with him,\" Colonel Wingate said. \"I think I can\nmake good use of him. Captain Keppel asked me, this morning, if I could\nfurnish him with a good interpreter. He is going up the river in a day\nor two, and as neither he nor the other naval officers know much\nArabic, Mr. Hilliard would be of considerable service to them, in\nquestioning any prisoners who may be captured as to hidden guns, or\nother matters. I should think, from what you tell me, Mr. Hilliard will\nbe very suitable for the post.\"\n\n\"The very man for it. He is a very pleasant lad--for he is not more\nthan that--quiet and gentlemanly, and yet full of life and go, and will\nbe certain to get on well with a naval man.\"\n\nOn returning to his quarters, General Hunter sent for Gregory.\n\n\"You will please go to Colonel Wingate, Mr. Hilliard. I have been\nspeaking to him about you; and, as it may be months before things are\nready for the final advance, and I am sure you would prefer to be\nactively employed, I proposed to him that he should utilize your\nservices; and it happens, fortunately, that he is able to do so. The\ngunboats will be running up and down the river, stirring up the\nDervishes at Metemmeh and other places; and as neither Keppel, nor the\ncommanders of the other two boats can speak Arabic with anything like\nfluency, it is important that he should have an interpreter.\n\n\"I think you will find the berth a pleasant one. Of course, I don't\nknow what arrangements will be made, or whether you would permanently\nlive on board one of the boats. If so, I think you would be envied by\nall of us, as you would get away from the dust, and all the discomforts\nof the encampment.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir! It would indeed be pleasant, and I was\nbeginning to feel that I was very useless here.\"\n\n\"You have not been useless at all, Mr. Hilliard. The Sirdar asked me\nabout you, and I was able to give him a very favourable report of your\nreadiness to be of service, for whatever work I have found for you to\ndo. I have told him that I had great doubts whether Ahmed Bey would\nhave pushed forward to this place, after he had lost the protection of\nthe gunboats, if you had not been with him.\"\n\nGregory at once went to the quarters of Colonel Wingate, and sent in\nhis name. In two or three minutes he was shown in. A naval officer was\nin the room with the colonel.\n\n\"You have come at the right time, Mr. Hilliard. I was just speaking of\nyou to Captain Keppel. I suppose General Hunter has told you how I\nproposed utilizing your services?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, he was good enough to tell me.\"\n\n\"You speak both Arabic and the Negro dialect perfectly, I am told?\"\n\n\"I speak them very fluently, almost as well as English.\"\n\n\"Just at present, you could not be of much use to me, Mr. Hilliard. Of\ncourse, I get all my intelligence from natives, and have no occasion to\nsend white officers out as scouts. Otherwise, from the very favourable\nreport that I have received from General Hunter, I should have been\nglad to have you with me; but I have no doubt that you would prefer to\nbe in one of the gunboats. They are certain to have a more stirring\ntime of it, for the next few weeks, than we shall have here.\"\n\n\"I should like it greatly, sir, if Captain Keppel thinks I shall do.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt about that,\" the officer said, with a smile. \"I shall\nrate you as a first lieutenant and midshipman, all in one; and I may\nsay that I shall be very glad to have a white officer with me. There\nare one or two spare cabins, aft, and you had better have your traps\nmoved in, at once. I may be starting tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Shall I take my servant with me, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, you may take him if you like. I suppose you have a horse?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, a horse and a camel; but I shall have no difficulty in\nmanaging about them. Excuse my asking, sir, but I have a few stores.\nShall I bring them on board?\"\n\n\"No, there is no occasion for that. You will mess with me. Thank\ngoodness, we left naval etiquette behind us when we came up the Nile,\nand it is not imperative that I should dine in solitary state. Besides,\nyou have been on Hunter's staff, have you not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I know his staff all mess together. I shall be very glad to have you\nwith me. It is lonely work, always messing alone.\n\n\"My boat is the Zafir, you know. You had better come on board before\neight o'clock, tomorrow morning. That is my breakfast hour.\"\n\nGregory needed but little time to make his arrangements. The transport\ndepartment took over Zaki's horse and camel, and gave him a receipt for\nthem; so that, when he returned, those or others could be handed over\nto him. One of the staff, who wanted a second horse, was glad to take\ncharge of his mount. The tent, and the big case, and his other\nbelongings were handed over to the stores.\n\nZaki was delighted, when he heard that he was going up in a gunboat\nthat would probably shell Metemmeh, and knock some of the Dervish\nfortifications to pieces.\n\n\"What shall I have to do, master?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not much, Zaki. You will brush my clothes, and make my bed, and do\nanything that I want done; but beyond that I cannot tell you. I am\nreally taking you, not because I think you will be of much use, but\nbecause I like to have you with me. Besides, I sha'n't have much to do,\nand the English officer who commands will have plenty to look after, so\nthat I shall be glad to talk, occasionally, with you.\n\n\"However, as I know the gunboats carry Maxim guns, and each have two\nsergeants of the marine artillery, I will hand you over to them, and\nask them to put you in the Maxim crew. Then you will have the\nsatisfaction of helping to fire at your old enemies.\"\n\nZaki's eyes glistened at the prospect.\n\n\"They killed my mother,\" he said, \"and carried off my sisters, and\nburned our house. It will be good to fire at them. Much better this,\nbey, than to load stores at Merawi.\"\n\nGregory was much gratified, that evening after mess, at the kindly\nmanner in which the members of the staff all shook hands with him, and\nsaid that they were sorry that he was going to leave them. General\nHunter was dining with the Sirdar. The next morning, when Gregory went\nto say \"Goodbye\" to him, he said:\n\n\"I was telling Sir Herbert Kitchener, yesterday evening, that you were\ntransferred to the naval branch. He said:\n\n\"'The gunboats will all take up troops, and there will be native\nofficers on board. It is a rule in our army, you know, that all white\nofficers have the honorary rank of major, so as to make them senior to\nall Egyptian officers. Will you tell Mr. Hilliard that I authorize him\nto call himself Bimbashi? There is no occasion to put it in orders. My\nauthorization is sufficient. As long as he was on your staff it did not\nmatter; but as, presently, he may be attached to an Egyptian regiment,\nit is as well that he should bear the usual rank, and it may save\nmisunderstanding in communicating with the natives. He will be much\nmore respected, as Bimbashi, than he would be as lieutenant, a title\nthat they would not understand.'\n\n\"A good many lieutenants in the British Army are Bimbashis, here, so\nthat there is nothing unusual in your holding that honorary rank.\"\n\n\"I would just as soon be lieutenant, sir, so far as I am concerned\nmyself; but of course, I feel honoured at receiving the title. No doubt\nit would be much more pleasant, if I were attached to an Egyptian\nregiment. I do not know whether it is the proper thing to thank the\nSirdar. If it is, I shall be greatly obliged if you will convey my\nthanks to him.\"\n\n\"I will tell him that you are greatly gratified, Hilliard. I have no\ndoubt you owe it, not only to your ride to Metemmeh, but to my report\nthat I did not think Ahmed Bey would have ventured to ride on into\nBerber, had you not been with him; and that you advised him as to the\ndefensive position he took up here, and prepared for a stout defence,\nuntil the boats could come up to his assistance. He said as much to\nme.\"\n\nAt the hour named, Gregory went on board the Zafir; Zaki accompanying\nhim, with his small portmanteau and blanket.\n\n\"I see you are punctual, Mr. Hilliard,\" the commander said, cheerily;\n\"a great virtue everywhere, but especially on board ship, where\neverything goes by clockwork. Eight bells will sound in two minutes,\nand as they do so, my black fellow will come up and announce the meal.\nIt is your breakfast, as much as mine; for I have shipped you on the\nbooks this morning, and of course you will be rationed. Happily, we are\nnot confined to that fare. I knew what it was going to be, and laid in\na good stock of stores. Fortunately, we have the advantage over the\nmilitary, that we are not limited as to baggage.\"\n\nThe breakfast was an excellent one. After it was over, Commander Keppel\nasked Gregory how it was that he had--while still so young--obtained a\ncommission, and expressed much interest when he had heard his story.\n\n\"Then you do not intend to remain in the Egyptian Army?\" he said. \"If\nyou have not any fixed career before you, I should have thought that\nyou could not do better. The Sirdar and General Hunter have both taken\na great interest in you. It might be necessary, perhaps, for you to\nenter the British Army and serve for two or three years, so as to get a\nknowledge of drill and discipline; then, from your acquaintance with\nthe languages here you could, of course, get transferred to the\nEgyptian Army, where you would rank as a major, at once.\"\n\n\"I have hardly thought of the future yet, sir; but of course, I shall\nhave to do so, as soon as I am absolutely convinced of my father's\ndeath. Really, I have no hope now; but I promised my mother to do\neverything in my power to ascertain it, for a certainty. She placed a\npacket in my hands, which was not to be opened until I had so satisfied\nmyself. I do not know what it contains, but I believe it relates to my\nfather's family.\n\n\"I do not see that that can make any difference to me, for I certainly\nshould not care to go home to see relations to whom my coming might be\nunwelcome. I should greatly prefer to stay out here, for a few years,\nuntil I had obtained such a position as would make me absolutely\nindependent of them.\"\n\n\"I can quite understand that,\" Captain Keppel said. \"Poor relations\nseldom get a warm welcome, and as you were born in Alexandria, they may\nbe altogether unaware of your existence. You have certainly been\nextremely fortunate, so far; and if you preferred a civil appointment,\nyou would be pretty certain of getting one when the war is over.\n\n\"There will be a big job in organizing this country, after the\nDervishes are smashed up; and a biggish staff of officials will be\nwanted. No doubt most of these will be Egyptians, but Egyptian\nofficials want looking after, so that a good many berths must be filled\nby Englishmen; and Englishmen with a knowledge of Arabic and the Negro\ndialect are not very easily found. I should say that there will be\nexcellent openings, for young men of capacity.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt there will,\" Gregory said. \"I have really never\nthought much about the future. My attention, from childhood, has been\nfixed upon this journey to the Soudan; and I never looked beyond it,\nnor did my mother discuss the future with me. Doubtless she would have\ndone so, had she lived; and these papers I have may give me her advice\nand opinion about it.\"\n\n\"Well, I must be going on deck,\" Captain Keppel said. \"We shall start\nin half an hour.\"\n\nThe three gunboats were all of the same design. They were flat\nbottomed, so as to draw as little water as possible; and had been built\nand sent out, in sections, from England. They were constructed entirely\nof steel, and had three decks, the lower one having loophole shutters\nfor infantry fire. On the upper deck, which was extended over the whole\nlength of the boat, was a conning tower. In the after portion of the\nboat, and beneath the upper deck, were cabins for officers. Each boat\ncarried a twelve-pounder quick-firing gun forward, a howitzer, and four\nMaxims. The craft were a hundred and thirty-five feet long, with a beam\nof twenty-four feet, and drew only three feet and a half of water. They\nwere propelled by a stern wheel.\n\nAt half-past nine the Zafir's whistle gave the signal, and she and her\nconsorts--the Nazie and Fatteh--cast off their warps, and steamed out\ninto the river. Each boat had on board two European engineers, fifty\nmen of the 9th Soudanese, two sergeants of royal marine artillery, and\na small native crew.\n\n\"I expect that we shall not make many more trips down to Berber,\" the\nCommander said, when they were once fairly off. \"The camp at Atbara\nwill be our headquarters, unless indeed Mahmud advances; in which case,\nof course, we shall be recalled. Until then we shall be patrolling the\nriver up to Metemmeh; and making, I hope, an occasional rush as far as\nthe next cataract.\"\n\nWhen evening came on, the steamer tied up to an island, a few miles\nnorth of Shendy. So far they had seen no hostile parties--indeed, the\ncountry was wholly deserted.\n\nNext morning they started before daybreak. Shendy seemed to be in\nruins. Two Arabs, only, were seen on the bank. A few shots were fired\ninto the town, but there was no reply.\n\nHalf an hour later, Metemmeh was seen. It stood half a mile from the\nriver. Along the bank were seven mud forts, with extremely thick and\nsolid walls. Keeping near the opposite bank, the gunboats, led by the\nZafir, made their way up the river. Dervish horsemen could be seen,\nriding from fort to fort, doubtless carrying orders.\n\nThe river was some four thousand yards wide and, at this distance, the\ngunboats opened fire at the two nearest forts. The range was soon\nobtained to a nicety, and the white sergeants and native gunners made\nsplendid practice, every shell bursting upon the forts, while the\nMaxims speedily sent the Dervish horsemen galloping off to the distant\nhills, on which could be made out a large camp.\n\nThe Dervish gunners replied promptly, but the range was too great for\ntheir old brass guns. Most of the shot fell short, though a few, fired\nat a great elevation, fell beyond the boats. One shell, however, struck\nthe Zafir, passing through the deck and killing a Soudanese; and a\nshrapnel shell burst over the Fatteh.\n\nAfter an hour's fire, at this range, the gunboats moved up opposite the\nposition; and again opened fire with shell and shrapnel, committing\nterrible havoc on the forts, whose fire presently slackened suddenly.\nThis was explained by the fact that, as the gunboats passed up, they\nsaw that the embrasures of the forts only commanded the approach from\nthe north; and that, once past them, the enemy were unable to bring a\ngun to bear upon the boats. Doubtless the Dervishes had considered it\nwas impossible for any steamer to pass up, under their fire; and that\nit was therefore unnecessary to widen the embrasures, so that the guns\ncould fire upon them when facing the forts, or going beyond them.\n\nSuddenly, as all on board were watching the effect of their fire, an\noutburst of musketry broke out from the bushes that lined the eastern\nbank, a hundred yards away. Fortunately, the greater part of the\nbullets flew overhead, but many rattled against the side. The Maxims\nwere instantly turned upon the unseen enemy, the Soudanese fired\nvolleys, and their rash assailants went at once into the thicker bush,\nmany dropping before they gained it.\n\nThe gunboats now steamed slowly up the river; and then, turning,\nretired downstream again, shelling the enemy's position as they passed.\nAs they were going down they came upon a number of Dervishes, who were\nbusy unloading half a dozen native craft. The Maxim soon sent them\nflying; and the boats, which contained horses, donkeys, grain, and\nother goods, were taken in tow by the gunboats, which anchored at the\nsame island as on the previous night.\n\n\"Well, Bimbashi,\" Captain Keppel said, when the work for the day was\nover, \"so you have had your first brush with the enemy. What do you\nthink of it?\"\n\n\"I would rather that you did not call me Bimbashi, Captain Keppel. The\ntitle is ridiculous for me, and it was only given me that it might be\nuseful when with Egyptian or Soudanese soldiers. I should feel really\nobliged, if you would simply call me Hilliard.\n\n\"I felt all right, sir, during the fight; except that I envied the\ngunners, who were doing something, while I had nothing to do but look\non. It certainly made me jump, when that shell struck the boat, because\nI had quite made up my mind that their guns would not carry so far, and\nso it was a complete surprise to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was a very harmless affair. Still, it was good as a\npreparation for something more severe. You have got accustomed to the\nnoise, now, and that is always as great a trial to the nerves as actual\ndanger.\"\n\n\"I wish I could be doing something, sir. Everyone else had some duty,\nfrom yourself down to the black firemen--even my servant made himself\nuseful, in carrying up shot.\"\n\n\"I tell you what I will do, Mr. Hilliard. I will get those marine\nsergeants to instruct you in the working of the Maxim, and in the\nduties of the men attending on it. Then next time we come up, I will\nput you in command of one of them. Your duties will not be severe, as\nyou would simply direct the men as to the object at which they are to\naim, watch the effect and direction of the bullets, and see that they\nchange their aim, as circumstances may direct. The black gunners are\nwell trained, and know their work; still, if by any chance the gun\njams, it will be useful for you to be able to show them what to do;\neven though they know it as well as, or better than, you do yourself.\nThe blacks like being commanded by a white officer, and will feel\npleased, rather than otherwise, at your being appointed to command\ntheir gun. Your lessons cannot begin for a day or two, for I have not\ndone with Metemmeh, yet.\"\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you, indeed,\" Gregory said warmly. \"I will\ntake care not to interfere with the men's working of the gun.\"\n\n\"No, you will not have to do that; but a word or two of commendation,\nwhen they make good practice, pleases them immensely; and they will\nwork all the better, and faster, for your standing by them.\"\n\nAt daybreak next morning the gunboats went up again, and engaged the\nforts, as before. The Dervishes had placed more guns in position, but\nagain the shells fell short, while those of the boats played havoc with\nthe enemy's defences. Some ten thousand of the Dervish horse and foot\ncame down near the town, in readiness to repel any attempt at a\nlanding.\n\nAfter some hours' bombardment, the gunboats retired. As they steamed\naway, the Dervish host were shouting and waving their banners,\nevidently considering that they had won a great victory.\n\nHaving fulfilled their object, which was to retain Mahmud at Metemmeh\nby showing him that, if he advanced against Merawi and Dongola, we had\nit in our power to occupy the town; and so cut off his retreat, and\nprevent reinforcements or stores from reaching him from Omdurman, the\ngunboats returned to Berber.\n\nSo far, Gregory had had no duties to perform in his capacity of\ninterpreter, for no prisoners had been taken. On the way down the\nriver, one of the artillery sergeants explained the working of the\nMaxim to him, taking the weapon to pieces, and explaining to him how\neach part acted, and then showing him how to put it together again. The\nsergeant having done this several times, Gregory was then told to\nperform the operation himself, and the lessons continued after their\narrival at Berber.\n\nIn the course of a week he was able to do this smartly; and had\nlearned, in case of a breakdown, which parts of the mechanism would\nmost probably have given way, and how to replace broken parts by spare\nones, carried up for the purpose.\n\nThere was no long rest at Berber, and on the 1st of November the\ngunboats again went up the river, reinforced by the Metemmeh, which had\nnow arrived. Each boat, as before, carried fifty soldiers; and Major\nStuart-Wortley went up, as staff officer. The evening before starting,\nthey received the welcome news that the railway line had, that day,\nreached Abu Hamed.\n\nThis time there was but a short pause made opposite Metemmeh, and after\nshelling the forts, which had been added to since the last visit, they\nproceeded up the river. Shortly after passing the town, a large Dervish\ncamp was seen in a valley, and this, they afterwards found, was\noccupied by the force that had returned from Berber. A heavy fire of\nshell and shrapnel was opened upon it, and it was speedily destroyed.\n\nThe gunboats then went up as high as the sixth cataract. The country\nwas found to be absolutely deserted, neither a peasant nor a Dervish\nbeing visible. Having thus accomplished the object of their\nreconnaissance, the flotilla returned, exchanged fire with the Metemmeh\nbatteries, and then kept on their way down to Berber.\n\n\n\nChapter 11: A Prisoner.\n\n\nRather than remain unoccupied on board the gunboat, Gregory went to\nColonel Wingate's headquarters and said that he should be very glad if\nhe would allow him, while the flotilla remained at Berber, to assist in\ninterrogating the fugitives who arrived from the south, and the spies\nemployed to gain early information of the intentions and movements of\nthe enemy. The position of the Dervishes at Metemmeh was becoming\ncritical. The Khalifa was desirous that Mahmud should return with his\nforce to Omdurman, there to take part in the battle in which, as he was\nconvinced, the invaders would be annihilated. Mahmud, who was of an\neager and impetuous disposition, was anxious to take the offensive at\nonce, and either to march upon Merawi and Dongola, or to drive the\nBritish out of Berber.\n\nThere could be no doubt that his view was a more sagacious one than\nthat of his father; and that the best tactics to be adopted were to\nharass the British advance, fall upon their convoys, cut their\ncommunications, and so oblige them to fall back for want of supplies.\nThe Khalifa's mistake was similar to that made by Theodore in\nAbyssinia, and Koffee Kalkalli in Ashanti. Had either of these leaders\nadopted the system of harassing the invaders, from the moment they left\nthe coast, it would have been next to impossible for the latter to\narrive at their destination. But each allowed them to march on,\nunmolested, until within striking distance; then hazarded everything on\nthe fortune of a single battle, and lost.\n\nMahmud made no movement in obedience to the Khalifa's orders to retire\nto Omdurman, and the latter thereupon refused to send any further\nsupplies to him, and Mahmud's army was therefore obliged to rely upon\nraids and plunder for subsistence. These raids were carried out with\ngreat boldness, and villages situated within a few miles of Berber were\nattacked. The Dervishes, however, met with a much warmer reception than\nthey had expected, for rifles and ammunition had been served out freely\nto the villagers; and these, knowing the fate that awaited them were\nthe Dervishes victorious, offered so obstinate a resistance that the\nlatter fell back, discomfited.\n\nEarly in January, the Sirdar learned that the Khalifa had changed his\nmind, and had sent peremptory orders to Mahmud to advance and drive the\nBritish out of Berber, and destroy the railway. Mahmud had now been\njoined by Osman Digna, with five thousand men; and as the Egyptian\ntroops, well as they had fought, had never yet been opposed to so\nformidable a force as that which Mahmud commanded, the Sirdar\ntelegraphed to England for white troops.\n\nHis request was at once complied with. The Warwickshires,\nLincolnshires, and Cameron Highlanders were ordered to proceed from\nCairo and Alexandria to the front; and the Seaforth Highlanders at\nMalta, and the Northumberland Fusiliers at Gibraltar were also\ndespatched, without delay. Major General Gatacre was appointed to the\ncommand of the brigade.\n\nAt the end of the third week in January, the three regiments from Lower\nEgypt had arrived at Wady Halfa, and the Seaforths at Assouan. At the\nbeginning of February the British brigade was carried, by railway, to\nAbu Dis. Here they remained until the 26th, when they marched to\nBerber, and then to a camp ten miles north of the Atbara, where they\narrived on the 4th of March, having covered a hundred and forty-four\nmiles in six days and a half, a great feat in such a climate.\n\nMahmud had made no movement until the 10th of February, when he began\nto cross the Nile to Shendy. This movement had not been expected by the\nSirdar, and was hailed by him with satisfaction. Had Mahmud remained at\nMetemmeh he could, aided by the forts, his artillery, and the walled\ntown, have offered a very formidable resistance. Had he marched along\nthe banks of the Nile, he would have been exposed to the fire of the\ngunboats, but these could not have arrested his course. The country\nround Berber was favourable to the action of his cavalry, and if\ndefeated he could have fallen back, unmolested, through Metemmeh on\nOmdurman; but by crossing the river he practically cut himself off from\nthe Dervish base, and now had only a desert behind him; for we had\ntaken over Kassala from the Italians, and the Egyptian battalion there,\nand a large force of friendly Arabs, would prevent him from retiring up\nthe banks of the Atbara.\n\nMahmud's plan was to march along the Nile to Ahab, then to cross the\ndesert to Hudi, at an angle of the river; whence a direct march, of\ntwenty-five miles, would take him to Berber, and in this way he would\navoid our strong position at the junction of the Atbara and the Nile.\nIt would have been easy for the gunboats to prevent Mahmud from\ncrossing the Nile, but the Sirdar was glad to allow him to do so. The\nmovement afforded him time to concentrate his force, and to get up\nlarge supplies. For, each day, the distance that these could be\ntransported by the railway had increased; and he saw that, when the\ntime for fighting came, the victory would be a decisive one; and that\nfew, indeed, of Mahmud's men would ever be able to make their way to\nOmdurman, and swell the Khalifa's force there.\n\nOn one occasion, however, the gunboats went up to watch what was going\non, and take advantage of any opportunity that might offer to destroy\nsome of Mahmud's boats, and thus render the work of his getting his\nforce over slower and more difficult. An entrenchment had been thrown\nup at the point where the Dervishes crossed, and this had been manned\nby two hundred and fifty riflemen. The Zafir steamed up close to the\nbank and opened fire with her Maxims. Another gunboat sank one large\ncraft and captured two others, and the troops landed and, covered by\nthe fire of the guns, captured a fourth which had grounded in shallow\nwater.\n\nA smaller boat was halfway across the river when the gunboats arrived.\nIt was seen that there were several women on board, and as the capture\nwould have been of no value, no regard was paid to it. As it would have\nbeen as dangerous to return as to keep on, the boatmen plied their\nhardest to get across, but the stream carried them down near the Zafir.\nThe boat was quite unnoticed, all eyes being intent upon the shore. She\nwas passing about thirty yards astern of the gunboat, when a badly\naimed shell from a Dervish battery struck her, and she sank almost\ninstantly.\n\nGregory, who was superintending the working of the Maxim nearest the\nstern, looked round at the sound of the explosion. Several of the\noccupants had evidently been killed, but two or three of the boatmen\nstarted to swim to shore. Only two of the women came to the surface,\nstruggling wildly and screaming for help. With scarcely a thought of\nwhat he was doing, Gregory unclasped his sword belt, dropped his\npistol, and sprang overboard.\n\nOne of the women had sunk before he reached them, the other was on the\npoint of doing so, when he caught her by the arm. She at once clung to\nhim, and he had hard work to disengage her arm from his neck; then,\nafter turning her so that her face was above water, he looked round.\nThe gunboat was already a hundred yards away. Her wheel was revolving,\nso as to keep her in her place facing the redoubt, and the stream was\ndriving him fast away from her.\n\nWithin ten yards of him was a black head, and a moment later Zaki was\nbeside him. He had been working at Gregory's Maxim, and had suddenly\nmissed his master. Looking round, he had seen him struggling with the\nwoman in the stream, and without hesitation had leapt overboard.\n\n\"I am sorry you came,\" Gregory said, \"for it is only throwing away your\nlife. It is of no use shouting, for they could not hear us in that din;\nand if they happened to catch sight of us, would take us for two of the\nblack boatmen. I see the stream is taking us nearer to the bank.\"\n\nZaki had taken hold of the woman while he was speaking.\n\n\"We might swim a long way down, master, if we let go of her.\"\n\n\"I won't do that, Zaki. I know now that I was a fool to jump overboard;\nbut now that I have done so, I will save her life. Besides, I could not\nswim very far even without her. I am feeling the weight of my boots and\nclothes.\n\n\"Will you swim with us till I can touch the ground, and then leave us?\nStrike right into the river again--I know that you are a good\nswimmer--and drop down the stream until you reach one of the islands,\nand then you can land and hail the gunboats as they come down. Tell\nCaptain Keppel why I jumped over.\"\n\n\"I am not going to leave you, master. No doubt the Dervishes will shoot\nme, but my life is of no consequence, and I shall be glad to die by the\nside of so good a master.\"\n\nThe woman, who had ceased to struggle when Gregory shook off her grasp,\nwas now conscious; as, with one of them supporting her on each side,\nher head was above water.\n\n\"They will not kill you,\" she said. \"You have saved me, and they will\nbe grateful.\"\n\nGregory had no faith whatever in Dervish gratitude.\n\n\"Well, Zaki,\" he said, \"if you will not leave us, we will strike at\nonce for the shore. The gunboats are nearly half a mile away now. There\nis just a chance that we may not have been noticed by the Dervishes,\nand may be able to hide in the bushes till the gunboats return. When\nthey see me, they will at once send a boat ashore, under cover of their\nfire, and take us off.\"\n\n\"There is a good chance of that, master,\" Zaki said cheerfully, \"and\nthe Dervishes are busy up there fighting, and will not think much of a\nlittle boat.\"\n\nThree or four minutes later they were in shallow water. As soon as they\nlanded, Gregory threw himself down, utterly exhausted; and the woman\nsank down beside him, but not before hastily rearranging her veil. In a\ncouple of minutes, Gregory roused himself.\n\n\"I can climb the bank, now,\" he said, \"and the sooner we are hidden\namong the bushes, the better.\"\n\nBut as he spoke he heard the sound of galloping horsemen, and almost\nimmediately an Emir, on a magnificent animal, followed by a dozen\nDervishes, dashed up.\n\n\"Mahmud!\" the woman cried, as she rose to her feet; \"it is I, Fatma!\"\n\nMahmud gave a cry of joy, and waved his hand to his followers, who had\nalready pointed their rifles at Gregory.\n\n\"These have saved me, my lord,\" the woman went on. \"They jumped from\ntheir boat, and reached me just as I was sinking, and have borne me up.\nFor my sake you must spare their lives.\"\n\nMahmud frowned. He dismounted and went up to his wife.\n\n\"Have I not sworn, Fatma,\" he said, \"that I would slay every unbeliever\nwho falls into my hands? How, then, can I spare even one who has saved\nyour life?\"\n\n\"Others have been spared who have been of service, my lord,\" she said.\n\"There are Greeks and Egyptians who work your guns, and they were\nspared because they were useful. There is Neufeld, who lives under the\nprotection of the Khalifa. Surely these men have done far more to\ndeserve, not only life, but honour at your hands. They risked their\nlives to save mine. What follower of the Prophet could do more? They\ncould not have known who I was, a woman they saw drowning. Are there\nany among the bravest of the tribes who would have done the same?\"\n\n\"I have sworn an oath,\" Mahmud said, gloomily.\n\n\"But you have not sworn to slay instantly. You can keep them, at least,\nuntil you can take them before the Khalifa, and say to him:\n\n\"'Father, I have sworn to kill unbelievers, but these men have saved\nFatma's life; and I pray you to absolve me from the oath, or order them\nto be taken from me, and then do you yourself pardon them and set them\nfree for the service that they have rendered me.'\n\n\"If he refuses, if these men are killed, I also swear that, as my life\nis due to them, I myself will perish by my own hands, if they die for\nsaving it!\"\n\n\"It needs not that, Fatma. You think that I am ungrateful, that I do\nnot feel that these men have acted nobly, thus to risk their lives to\nsave a strange woman whose face they have never seen. It is my oath\nthat lies heavily upon me. I have never been false to an oath.\"\n\n\"Nor need you be now,\" Fatma said earnestly. \"You swore to slay any\nunbeliever that fell into your hands. This man has not fallen into your\nhands. I have a previous claim to him. He is under my protection. I\ncover him with my robe\"--and she swept a portion of her garment round\nGregory--\"and as long as he is under it he is, according to tribal\nlaws, safe even from the vengeance of my husband!\n\n\"As to the other, he is not an unbeliever. Your oath concerns him not.\nHim you can honour and reward, according to the value you place upon my\nlife.\"\n\nThe Arab's face cleared.\n\n\"Truly you have discovered a way out of it, Fatma, at any rate for the\npresent.\"\n\nHe turned to Gregory for the first time.\n\n\"Do you speak our tongue?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, Emir, as well as my own.\"\n\n\"Then you understand what we have said. Had I not been bound by my\noath, I would have embraced you as a brother. We Arabs can appreciate a\nbrave deed, even when it is done by an enemy. When one of the boatmen\nran into the battery where I was directing the guns against your boat,\nand said that the boat in which my wife, with other women, were\ncrossing had been sunk, by a shell from our batteries on the other\nside, I felt that my blood was turned to water. He said he believed\nthat all had been killed or drowned, but that he looked back as he\nswam, and saw a white man jump overboard, and a short time after\nanother followed him; and that, when he reached the shore, they were\nsupporting a woman in the water.\n\n\"I rode hither, having but small hope indeed that it was my wife, but\nmarvelling much that a white officer should thus risk his life to save\na drowning woman. My oath pressed heavily upon me, as I rode. Even had\nit been but a slave girl whom you rescued, I should no less have\nadmired your courage. I myself am said to be brave, but it would never\nhave entered my mind thus to risk my life for a stranger. When I found\nthat it was my wife who was saved, I still more bitterly regretted the\noath that stood between me and her preserver, and truly glad am I that\nshe has herself shown me how I can escape from its consequences.\n\n\"Now I see you, I wonder even more than before at what you have done;\nfor indeed, in years, you are little more than a boy.\"\n\n\"What I did, Emir, I believe any white officer who was a good swimmer\nwould have done. No Englishman would see a woman drowning without\nmaking an effort to save her, if he had it in his power. As to the fact\nthat she was not of the same race or religion, he would never give it a\nthought. It would be quite enough for him that she was a woman.\"\n\n\"And you,\" Mahmud said, turning to Zaki, \"you are a Jaalin, are you\nnot?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Jaalin or Baggara, you are my friend,\" Mahmud said, placing his hand\non Zaki's shoulders. \"And so you, too, leapt overboard to save a\nwoman?\"\n\n\"No, Emir,\" he replied, \"I jumped over because my master jumped over. I\nhad not thought about the woman. I jumped over to aid him, and it was\nto give him my help that I took my share in supporting the woman. The\nBimbashi is a good master, and I would die for him.\"\n\nMahmud smiled at this frank answer.\n\n\"Nevertheless, whatever may have been your motive, you were enabled to\nsave the life of my wife, and henceforth you are my friend.\"\n\nThen he turned to the horsemen, who were still grouped on the bank\nabove.\n\n\"You have heard what has been said? The white man is under the\nprotection of my harem; the Jaalin is henceforth my friend.\"\n\nMahmud was a fine specimen of the tribesmen of the Soudan--tall, well\nbuilt, and with pure Arab features. He was the Khalifa's favourite son;\nand was generous, with kindly impulses, but impatient of control. Of\nlate, he had given way to outbursts of passion, feeling acutely the\nposition in which he was placed. He had advanced from Omdurman\nconfident that he should be able to drive the infidels before him, and\ncarry his arms far into Egypt. His aspirations had been thwarted by the\nKhalifa. His requests for stores and camels that would have enabled him\nto advance had been refused, and he had been ordered to fall back. His\ntroops had been rendered almost mutinous, from the want of supplies.\n\nHe had seen the invaders growing stronger and stronger, and\naccomplishing what had seemed an impossibility--the bringing up of\nstores sufficient for their sustenance--by pushing the railroad forward\ntowards Berber. Now that their forces had been very greatly increased,\nand the issue of the struggle had become doubtful, he had received the\norder for which he had been craving for months; and had been directed\nto march down and attack the Egyptian army, drive them across the Nile,\nand destroy the railway.\n\nBy means of spies he had heard that, ere long, a large force of British\nsoldiers would come up to reinforce the Egyptians; so that what might\nhave been easy work, two months before, had now become a difficult and\ndangerous enterprise. The manner in which the Dervishes had been\ndefeated in their attacks upon Wolseley's desert column, and in the\nengagements that had since taken place, showed how formidable was the\nfighting power, not only of the British troops, but of the native army\nthey had organized; and his confidence in the power of the tribesmen to\nsweep all before them had been shaken.\n\nThe Dervishes scowled, when they heard that they were not to have the\nsatisfaction of massacring this Englishman, whose countrymen were still\nkeeping up a terrible fire on their redoubt. It was not one of their\nwives who had been rescued, and Gregory's act of jumping overboard\nseemed to them to savour of madness; and if that plea had been\nadvanced, they would have recognized it as rendering the person of the\nman who had performed it inviolable. However, as he was under the\nprotection of their leader's harem, there was nothing more to be said;\nand at an order from Mahmud all but four of them rode off, while the\nothers fell in behind him.\n\nMahmud did not mount again, but walked with his wife to a deserted mud\nhut, two hundred yards away. There he left her, telling Gregory and\nZaki to sit down outside, and placing the four men on guard.\n\n\"I must rejoin my men,\" he said, as he mounted. \"When your vessels have\ngone, I will return.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, the fire ceased. Soon afterwards Mahmud rode up\nwith a score of men, followed by some dozen women, and a slave leading\na donkey. On this Fatma took her seat, and the women surrounded her.\nGregory and Zaki walked close behind them. Mahmud, with his horsemen,\nrode in front.\n\nAfter proceeding for a mile, they came upon a group of tents. Mahmud's\nbanner was flying on a pole in front of the largest of these. Behind,\nand touching it, was another almost as large. This was the abode of the\nladies of Mahmud's harem. The other tents were occupied by his\nprincipal Emirs. A hundred yards away was the encampment of the army,\nwhich was sheltered in hastily constructed huts, or arbours, made of\nbushes.\n\nBy Mahmud's order, a small tent was erected, with blankets, close to\nthe after entrance into the harem tent, for Gregory's use; so that,\nshould he be attacked by fanatics, he could at once take refuge in the\nharem, whose sanctity not even the most daring would dare to violate.\n\nA handsome robe was brought for Zaki; and as Mahmud presented it to\nhim, he said:\n\n\"You are my friend, but you must now go back to your vessels, or to\nBerber. My orders were to kill all the Jaalin, and we have spared none\nwho fell into our hands, at Metemmeh or since. I cannot keep you here.\nAs long as you stay by my side, you will be safe; but you could not\nleave me for a moment. It is as much as I can do to save the life of\nthis infidel officer, and it is to him that I owe most, for it was he\nwho first leapt into the river.\n\n\"The white men's boats have already fastened up, behind the island\nwhere they before stationed themselves. Make your way down there, at\ndaybreak, and wave a white cloth. Doubtless they will send a boat\nashore, thinking that you bear a message from me; or if you see they do\nnot do this, you can swim out to them.\"\n\n\"I would rather stay with my master. Cannot you let him go, too?\"\n\n\"That is impossible,\" Mahmud said shortly. \"It is known throughout the\ncamp that I have a white man here. The news will travel fast to the\nKhalifa. My actions have already been misrepresented to him, and were I\nto let this officer go, my father might recall me to Omdurman and send\nanother to command here.\n\n\"He must stay, but you may go without harm. You can scarcely have been\nnoticed yet, and I can well declare, should the Khalifa hear of you,\nthat you have escaped.\"\n\n\"May I speak with my master?\" Zaki said. \"If he says stay, I shall\nstay, though it might cost me my life. If he says go, I must go.\"\n\n\"You may speak to him,\" Mahmud said.\n\nZaki went round to Gregory's tent, and told him what Mahmud had said.\n\n\"Go, certainly, Zaki. You can do me no good by remaining here, and\nmight even do me harm; for if you were killed I also might be murdered.\nMoreover, I wish to send the news of my capture, and how it occurred. I\ndo not think any, save yourself, noticed that I was missing; and when\nthe fight was over, and they found that I was absent, they might\nsuppose that I had been shot and had fallen overboard.\n\n\"I will write a note for you to carry. It is, in all respects, better\nthat you should go. Were we to be seen talking together, it might be\nsupposed that we were planning some way of escape, and I should be more\nclosely watched. As it is, I see that Mahmud will have difficulty in\nprotecting me. Were you to ride about with him, as he says, your\npresence would remind his followers that he has a white man a captive\nhere; whereas, if I remain almost in concealment near the harem, the\nfact that there is a white man here will pass out of the minds of those\nwho know it, and will not become the common talk of the camp.\n\n\"Mahmud is running some risk in having spared my life, and I do not\nwish to make it harder for him. Go, therefore, and tell him that you\nwill leave tonight. I cannot write now; my pocketbook is soaked\nthrough. But I will tear out some leaves and dry them in the sun; and\nwrite what I have to say, before you start. I shall speak highly of you\nin my letter, and recommend you to Colonel Wingate; who will, I have no\ndoubt, give you employment.\n\n\"I hope I shall see you again, before long. I am very sorry that we\nmust part, but it is best for us both.\"\n\nVery reluctantly, Zaki returned to Mahmud.\n\n\"My master says I must go, Emir; and I must obey his orders, though I\nwould rather stay with him. Tonight, I will leave.\"\n\n\"It is well. I would that I could let him go, also, but my oath\nprevents me from giving him his freedom. I trust, however, that when\nthe Khalifa hears of his noble action, and how he has made me his\ndebtor, he will say that Allah himself would not blame me for that.\nGratitude is even more binding than an oath.\n\n\"Still, until I hear from him, I can do nothing. We have not seen\nmatters in the same light, for some time. When I wanted to strike, he\nwas unwilling that I should do so. Now, when it seems to me that the\ntime for that has passed, and that I had best retire on Omdurman, he\nsays go forward and fight. It is not for me to question his commands,\nor his wisdom. But I may not give him cause for anger.\n\n\"My advice to you is, when you get to Berber, do not stay there. We\nshall assuredly be there before long, and as none would know that you\nwere under my protection, you would be slain. Go straight to Abu Hamed;\nand when you hear that we have defeated the infidels, and have entered\nBerber, leave by this road they have made, upon which, as they tell me,\ncarriages run without horses, and stay not until you reach Cairo.\n\n\"There you can live quietly, until you hear that the Khalifa's army is\napproaching. After that, fly. I cannot say whither, but seek a shelter\nuntil the black flag waves over the whole of the land. When there is no\nmore fighting, then come to me and I will give you a post of honour.\"\n\n\"I will do so, Emir. When the time comes, I will remind you of your\npromise.\"\n\n\"I have neither silver nor gold with which I can reward you, now; but\nwe shall gather these things in Egypt, and I will make you wealthy.\"\n\nZaki thought that it would be unwise to wander from Mahmud's\nencampment, and he accordingly sat down by his tent. Presently, one of\nthe slaves came out, with a large dish of food that Mahmud had sent\nhim. As evening approached, he went round to Gregory's little tent,\nwith the intention of trying to persuade him to attempt to escape with\nhim; but two of the tribesmen, with rifles in their hands, were\nstationed there. They offered no opposition to his entry, but their\npresence showed that Mahmud was determined that his master should\nappear to be a close prisoner; as, indeed, his escape might well\njeopardize the Emir's position, even among his followers.\n\nGregory had a letter ready for him to carry to Captain Keppel. It ran\nas follows:\n\n\"Dear Captain Keppel,\n\n\"I am a prisoner in Mahmud's hands. This is the result of my own\nimpetuosity--I will not say folly, for I cannot regret that I yielded\nto the sudden impulse that seized me. A boat containing some women was\nsunk by a shell, when but a few yards astern of the gunboat. Most of\nits occupants were killed, but I saw a woman struggling in the water\nand, without thinking of the consequences, jumped overboard to save\nher, my servant following me. When we reached her, we found that the\ncurrent was too strong to regain the gunboat, and so landed about half\na mile down, hoping to find shelter in the bushes until the boat came\ndown the stream. What I did, however, had been observed by the\nDervishes; and as soon as I landed a party rode up, headed by Mahmud\nhimself, who was aware that his favourite wife was in the boat that had\nsunk.\n\n\"Most fortunately, it turned out that she was the woman I had saved.\nUpon her appeal Mahmud spared our lives. He has released my man, who\nwill carry this to you; but, having sworn that he would spare no white\nman, he retains me in his hands as a prisoner, until he can lay the\nfacts before the Khalifa and obtain his permission to let me go. I\ntrust that all will be well, and that some day I may rejoin the army.\nHowever, there is no saying how matters may turn out.\n\n\"I am happy in knowing that there is no one who, if the worst comes to\nthe worst, will grieve over my loss. I recommend my faithful servant to\nyou. I should wish the balance of pay coming to me to be handed to him,\nas well as my camel and horse, and all other belongings. By the sale of\nthese he would be able, at the end of the war, to buy a piece of land\nand settle down among his own people.\n\n\"Will you kindly report my capture to Colonel Wingate or General\nHunter? Thanking you for your kindness to me, I remain,\n\n\"Yours faithfully,\n\n\"Gregory Hilliard.\n\n\"P. S. In my cabin is a tin box containing documents of importance to\nme. I shall be greatly obliged if you will take charge of these,\nuntil--as I hope will be the case--I rejoin you.\"\n\nHe handed the paper to Zaki, who took his hand and raised it to his\nforehead, with tears in his eyes.\n\n\"I go because you order me, master,\" he said, in a broken voice; \"but I\nwould a thousand times rather remain, and share your fate, whatever it\nmight be.\"\n\nThen he turned, and abruptly left the tent.\n\nTwice that day, Gregory had received food from a female slave of the\nharem. Although he knew that he should miss Zaki greatly, he was very\nglad that he had been sent away; for he felt that, although for the\ntime he had been reprieved, his position was very precarious, and that\nhis servant's would have been still more so. A white prisoner was a\npersonage of some consequence, but the death of a Jaalin was a matter\nthat would disturb no one. Thousands of them had been massacred; and\none, more or less, could not matter at all. But, however much the\nDervishes might hate a white infidel, it would be a serious matter for\neven the most powerful Emir to harm a prisoner under the protection of\nthe harem of the Khalifa's son.\n\nMahmud had been very popular among them, but his position had been\ngravely shaken by the events of the last six months. Having unlimited\nconfidence in themselves; the Baggara had seen, with increasing fury,\nthe unopposed advance of the Egyptians. They could not understand why\nthey should not have been allowed, after the capture of Metemmeh, to\nmarch across the desert to Merawi, and annihilate the infidels\nassembled there. It was true that these had repulsed the force\ndefending Dongola, but this was a comparatively small body; and it was\nthe gunboats, and not the Egyptian troops, who had forced them to\nevacuate the town.\n\nThe fall of Abu Hamed had added to their discontent, and they were\neager to march with all speed to Berber, to join the five thousand men\ncomprising its garrison, and to drive the invaders back across the\nNile.\n\nBut they had been kept inactive, by the orders of the Khalifa and by\nthe want of stores. They had, for months, been suffering great\nprivations; and while remaining in enforced inactivity, they had known\nthat their enemy's strength was daily increasing; and that what could\nhave been accomplished with the greatest of ease, in August, had now\nbecome a very serious business.\n\nMahmud had chafed at the situation in which he found himself placed, by\nhis father's refusal to support him or to allow him to take any action.\nThis had soured his temper, and he had taken to drinking heavily. He\nhad become more harsh with his men, more severe in the punishment\ninflicted for any trifling disobedience of orders. Although no thought\nthat the rule of the Khalifa could be seriously threatened entered\ntheir minds, fanatical as they were, they could not but feel some\nuneasiness at the prospect.\n\nA great army was gathering at Berber. Kassala was in the hands of the\nBritish, and the forces that had been beleaguering it had been\ndefeated, with heavy loss. Abyssinia had leagued itself against them.\nThe insurrection of the Jaalin had been crushed, but there were signs\nof unrest in Kordofan, and other parts.\n\nOf course, all this would be put right. An army of sixty thousand men\nwas at Omdurman; and this, with Mahmud's command, would suffice to\nsweep away all their enemies. Their enthusiasm would never have\nwavered, had they been called upon for action; but these months of\nweary waiting, and of semi-starvation, without the acquisition of any\nbooty or plunder--for little, indeed, had been obtained at the capture\nof Metemmeh--sapped their energy; and the force that crossed the Nile\nfor an advance upon Berber was far less formidable than it would have\nbeen, had it been led forward against Merawi and Dongola directly after\nthe capture of Metemmeh. Still, it needed only the prospect of a battle\nto restore its spirits.\n\nA fortnight after Gregory's capture, the Dervish army was set in\nmotion. A few thousand men had already been sent forward, along the\nbanks of the river, to check any advance that might be made from Fort\nAtbara. Had it not been for this, Gregory might have attempted to\nescape. It would not have been very difficult for him to creep out at\nthe back of his little tent, unperceived by his guards; but the dangers\nto be encountered in making his way to the British fort would have been\nimmense.\n\nIt would have been necessary for him to keep by the river, for from\nthis source alone could water be obtained. The country had been\nstripped of its crops, of all kinds, by the Dervishes; the villages had\nbeen razed to the ground; and the last head of maize, and other grain,\ngleaned by the starving people who had taken refuge in the bush and\njungle.\n\nTherefore, although by keeping near the river he could quench his\nthirst at will, he would assuredly have to face starvation. Moreover,\nhe would have no chance of searching for any ears of corn which might\nhave escaped the eyes of the searchers, for he must travel only by\nnight and lie up by day, to avoid capture by one or other of the bands\nthat had gone on; in which case he would at once be killed, being\nbeyond the influence of Mahmud, and the protection of the harem.\n\nOn the other hand, he had nothing to complain of, except the monotony\nand uncertainty of his position. Fatma kept him well supplied with\nfood; and, from the gossip of the slaves who brought this to him, he\nlearnt how matters were progressing. He was longing for the Dervish\narmy to make a move, for he felt that when they neared the British\nposition, the greater would be the chance of escape; and none among the\nfollowers of Mahmud rejoiced more than he did, when he knew that the\nlong-expected advance was about to take place.\n\nOnce in motion, the spirits of the Dervishes revived. At last they were\ngoing to meet these insolent invaders, and none doubted that they would\neasily defeat them. The greater portion of the harem and attendants\nwere left behind, at Shendy, for but few camels were available. Fatma\nand another of Mahmud's wives rode on one. A tent was carried by\nanother. Half a dozen slaves followed, and Gregory walked with these.\n\nHe could not help admiring the attitude of the tribesmen--tall,\npowerful men, inured to hardship, and walking or riding with an air of\nfierce independence, which showed their pride in themselves, and their\nconfidence in their prowess.\n\nThe party always started early in the morning, so as to get the tents\nerected at the halting place before the main body of the Dervishes came\nup. On the march, they kept some distance from the river and, being but\na small group, the gunboats did not waste their shot upon them; but\neach day there was a sharp exchange of fire between them and Mahmud's\nforce.\n\nGregory supposed that Mahmud's plan was to cross the Atbara, which was\nfordable at several points, and to attack the fort there; in which\ncase, he had no doubt the Arabs would be driven off, with much loss.\nThe Sirdar was of the same opinion, and in order to tempt them to do\nso, he maintained only one Egyptian brigade in the fort, the remainder\nof the force being concentrated at Kennur, four miles away. From this\npoint they would be able to advance and take the Dervishes in flank,\nwhile they were engaged in the attack of the fort.\n\nMahmud, however, was kept well informed of the movements of the troops,\nand instead of continuing his course down the river bank when he\nreached Gabati, he struck across the desert; and, after two days'\nmarch, crossed the Atbara at Nakheila. From this point, owing to the\nbend in the river, he would be able to march direct to Berber, avoiding\nthe Atbara fort and the force gathered round it.\n\nAltogether the desert march, although only lasting two days, was a\ntrying one. The heat was overpowering, and even the ladies of the harem\nhad the scantiest supply of water. They had, at starting, given Gregory\na gourd of water for his own use. This he had taken sparingly, and it\nlasted him until they reached the Atbara.\n\nIt was now dead low water, and the river offered no obstacle to\ncrossing, as the bed was for the most part dry, with pools here and\nthere. The Arab encampment was formed in a thick grove of trees, which\nafforded some shelter from the sun.\n\nDay after day passed. Mahmud was now informed as to the strength of the\nforce he should have to encounter, and for the first time felt some\ndoubt as to the issue of the fight. He determined, therefore, to stand\non the defensive. This decision, however, he kept to himself. The\nDervishes were burning to be led to the assault, and became almost\nmutinous, on account of the delay. Mahmud was obliged to take the\nstrongest measures, and several of those who were loudest in their\ndissatisfaction were summarily executed. The rest were pacified with\nthe assurance that he was only waiting for a fortunate day.\n\nIn the meantime, the men were employed in fortifying the position. Deep\nholes were dug along the edge of the wood, and behind these were\ntrenches and pitfalls. Mahmud's own temper grew daily more sullen and\nfierce. His own fighting instinct was in favour of the attack his\nfollowers longed to deliver, but in his heart he was afraid that the\nresult might be fatal. It was not the rifles of the infantry that he\nfeared--of these he had no experience--but the artillery, which he had\nlearned, already, could be used with terrible effect.\n\nAs Mahmud was drinking heavily, and as the fact that the white soldiers\nwere near at hand added to the fanatical hatred of the emirs and\ntribesmen, Fatma sent a message by a slave to Gregory, warning him not\nto show himself outside the little shelter tent, composed of a single\nblanket, in which he now lived.\n\nAt length it became known that the English host was approaching. As\nsoon as the gunboats brought down news that the Dervishes were no\nlonger following the river bank, but were disappearing into the desert,\nthe Sirdar guessed their intentions. Nothing could have suited him\nbetter. A battle now must be a decisive one. There was no way of\nretreat open to the Dervishes, except to cross the waterless desert; or\nto fly south, keeping to the course of the Atbara, which would take\nthem farther and farther from the Nile with every mile they marched.\n\nBringing up all his force, therefore, from Kennur and the Atbara fort,\nwhich one battalion was left to guard, the Sirdar took up his post at\nHudi. The position was well chosen. It lay halfway between Mahmud's\ncamp at Nakheila and the Atbara fort, and left Mahmud only the option\nof attacking him; or of making a long detour, through the desert to the\neast, in order to reach Berber. The British, on the other hand, could\nreceive their supplies by camels from the Atbara fort.\n\nThe cavalry went out to reconnoitre, and had constant skirmishes with\nthe enemy's horse; but when day after day passed, and Mahmud did not\ncome, as the Sirdar had expected, to attack him, it was determined to\ntake the offensive. General Hunter was ordered to move forward, with\nthe whole of the cavalry and a Maxim-gun battery, to discover the exact\nposition of the enemy.\n\nThe camp had been well chosen; for, like Abu Hamed, it lay in a\ndepression, and could not be seen until an enemy came within six\nhundred yards of it. Thus the superiority of range of the British\nrifles was neutralized, and their guns could not be brought into play\nuntil within reach of the Dervish muskets. The wood was surrounded by a\nhigh zareba, behind which a crowd of Dervishes were assembled. They had\nanticipated an attack, and held their fire until the cavalry should\ncome nearer. This, however, General Hunter had no intention of doing,\nand he retired with the information he had gained. His account of the\nstrength of the position showed the difficulty of taking it by assault.\n\nNext day he again went out with the same force, but this time the\nDervishes were prepared. Their mounted men dashed out from the wood,\nand galloped round to cut off the cavalry; while the footmen crowded\nout to attack them in front. The cavalry fell back in perfect order,\nand one squadron charged forty of the Dervish cavalry, who barred the\nline of retreat. These they drove off, but the main body still pressed\nforward, and the Maxims opened upon them. The hail of bullets was too\nmuch for the horsemen, and they drew off. Several times they gathered\nagain for a charge, but on each occasion the Maxims dispersed them. The\nunmounted Dervishes were soon left behind, but the horsemen, in spite\nof the lesson they had received, followed almost to the camp.\n\nOn the afternoon of the 7th of April, the Anglo-Egyptian force marched\nout. They started at five in the afternoon, and halted at seven. The\nhorses were first taken down to water, the infantry by half battalions;\nall then lay down to sleep. At one o'clock the word to advance was\npassed round quietly. The moon was full and high overhead, so there was\nno difficulty in avoiding obstacles. Each brigade marched in square,\naccompanied by the guns and the Maxims, and the camels with provisions\nand spare ammunition.\n\nAt four o'clock they halted again. They had been well guided, and were\nnow but a short distance from the enemy's position. At sunrise the men\nwere again on their feet, and advanced to within two hundred yards of\nthe position from which they were to deliver their attack. The British\nbrigade--the Camerons, Warwicks, Seaforths, and Lincolns--were on the\nleft. Next to them came Macdonald's brigade--the three Soudanese\nregiments in front, the 2nd Egyptian in support. Farther still to the\nright, and touching the river, was Maxwell's brigade, comprising also\nthree Soudanese regiments and an Egyptian one. Two of the three\nEgyptian battalions of Lewis's brigade were placed on the left rear of\nthe British brigade, the third battalion was in square round the\ncamels. Two field batteries were in front of the infantry, and two to\nthe right of Maxwell's brigade.\n\nHalf a mile from the zareba the infantry halted, and the artillery and\nMaxims opened fire. For an hour a tremendous fire was poured into the\nenemy's position, but not a shot was fired in reply, although the\nDervishes could be seen moving among the trees, apparently unconcerned\nat the storm of shell and bullets.\n\nGregory's position had been growing more critical every day. Food was\nextremely short; the scanty supplies that the force had brought with\nthem had been long since exhausted, and they were now subsisting upon\npalm nuts. Of these, two were served out daily to each man, a quantity\nbarely sufficient to keep life together. In spite of the vigilant watch\nkept by the more fanatical of Mahmud's followers, desertions had become\nfrequent, notwithstanding the certain death that awaited those who were\novertaken.\n\nThe evening after the cavalry made their first reconnaissance, the\nslave who brought Gregory's food told him that Fatma wished to speak to\nhim. It was but three paces to the entrance of the tent, and his guards\nmade no objection. The entrance was closed as the slave entered, but\nhalf a minute later it was opened an inch or two, and, without showing\nherself, Fatma said:\n\n\"Listen to me.\"\n\n\"I am listening,\" Gregory replied.\n\n\"I am in great fear for you. You are in much danger. The Emirs say to\nMahmud that you ought to be killed; their followers are well-nigh\nstarving--why should an infidel prisoner be eating? His friends are now\nclose to us, and there will be a battle. None will be spared on either\nside--why should this man be spared?\n\n\"Mahmud has many cares. The men are furious because he will not lead\nthem out to fight. Even the emirs are sullen; and Osman Digna, who was\non bad terms with him a short time ago, and who, Mahmud suspects, is\nintriguing with them against him, is foremost in urging that an attack\nshould take place; though everyone knows he is a coward, and never\nshows himself in battle, always running away directly he sees that\nthings are going against him. Still, he has five thousand followers of\nhis own.\n\n\"Mahmud told me today that he had done all in his power but, placed as\nhe was, he could not withstand the words of the emirs, and the\ncomplaints of the tribesmen. When the battle comes--as it must come in\na day or two--it will need all his influence and the faith of the men\nwith him to win; and with so much at stake, how can he risk everything\nfor the sake of a single life, and that the life of an infidel? If you\nwould agree to aid in working his guns, as the Greeks and Egyptians do,\nit would content the emirs.\"\n\n\"That I cannot do,\" Gregory said. \"If I am to be killed, it is the will\nof God; but better that, a thousand times, than turn traitor!\"\n\n\"I knew that it would be so,\" Fatma said sorrowfully. \"What can we do?\nAt other times, the protection of the harem would cover even one who\nhad slain a chief; but now that the Baggara are half starving, and mad\nwith anger and disappointment, even that no longer avails. If they\nwould brave the anger of the son of the Khalifa, they would not regard\nthe sanctity of the harem. I wish now that I had advised you to try and\nescape when we left Shendy, or even when we first came here. It would\nhave been difficult, but not impossible; but now I can see no chance.\nThere is the thorn hedge round the wood, with few openings, and with\nmen on watch all round to prevent desertion. Several tried to escape\nlast night--all were caught and killed this morning. Even if it were\npossible to pass through, there are bands of horsemen everywhere out on\nthe plain, keeping watch alike against the approach of the enemy and\nthe desertion of cowards.\n\n\"I have been in despair, all day, that I cannot save the life of one\nwho saved mine. I have told Mahmud that my honour is concerned, and\nthat I would give my life for yours. Months ago, he would have braved\nthe anger of all his army for me, but he has changed much of late. It\nis not that he loves me less, but that he has been worried beyond\nbearing, and in his troubles he drinks until he forgets them.\n\n\"My only hope is that your people will attack tomorrow. Mahmud says\nthat they will assuredly be beaten; they will be shot down as they\napproach, and none will ever be able to get through the hedge. Then,\nwhen they fall back, the Baggara will pour out, horse and foot, and\ndestroy them. They will then see how right he has been in not letting\nthem go out into the plain to fight. His influence will be restored,\nand your life will be safe.\n\n\"We are to be removed to the farther side of the wood, when the\nfighting begins; and there all the women are to be gathered, and wait,\ntill the infidels are utterly destroyed.\n\n\"If your people come tomorrow morning, you may be saved. Otherwise I\nfear the worst.\"\n\n\"I thank you for what you have done for me,\" replied Gregory, \"and\nwhatever comes of it, be sure that I shall feel grateful to you, and\nshall not blame you for not having been able to do what was impossible.\nI hope my friends may come tomorrow, for, whatever my fate may be,\nanything is better than uncertainty.\"\n\n\"May Allah protect you!\" the woman said, with a sob; \"and go now. I\nhear Mahmud calling me.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 12: The Battle Of Atbara.\n\n\nGregory had little sleep that night. It was clear to him that there was\nabsolutely no chance of making his escape. Even were his two guards\nwithdrawn, it would not improve his position. He had no means of\ndisguise, and even if he had an Arab dress and could stain his face, he\ncould not hope to make his way through the crowds of sleeping men, the\npitfalls and trenches, and pass out through the jealously guarded\nzareba. There was nothing, for him, but to wait till the end.\n\nHe could not blame Mahmud. A leader on the eve of a great battle could\nnot, for the sake of a single captive, risk his influence and oppose\nthe wishes of his followers. It was much that he had, for his wife's\nsake, postponed the fulfilment of his oath; and had so long withstood\nthe wishes of his most influential emirs. More could not be expected.\nAt any rate, he was better off than others who had been in the same\nposition. He had not, so far as he knew, a relation in the world--no\none who would be anywise affected by his death; and at least he would\nhave the satisfaction of knowing that it was a kind action which had\nbrought him to his end. He prayed earnestly, not that his life might be\nspared, but that his death might be a painless one; and that he might\nmeet it as an English officer should, without showing signs of fear.\n\nThe next day he heard orders given, and a great stir in camp; and he\ngathered, from those who passed near the tent, that the enemy's cavalry\nwere again approaching; and that the mounted men were to ride out and\ncut them off from retreating, while the dismounted men were to pour out\nand annihilate them. Then, for a time, all was silence in the camp.\n\nSuddenly an outburst of shouts and cries broke out and, almost\nsimultaneously, he heard the rattle of Maxim guns--the fight had begun.\nWould the Egyptian horsemen stand firm, or would they give way to\npanic? If they broke and fled, none whatever would return to their camp\nthrough the host of Baggara horsemen.\n\nFor a time, the roll of the fire from the machine guns was incessant.\nThen there was a pause. Two or three minutes later it broke out again,\nbut it was evidently somewhat farther off; and so it went on, with\nintervals of silence, but ever getting farther away. It was clear that\nthe horsemen had not been able to bring the cavalry to a standstill,\nand that these were steadily falling back, covered by the fire of the\nMaxims. At last the sound grew faint in the distance and, soon\nafterwards, the noise in the camp showed that the infantry were\nreturning.\n\nIt was not till two hours later that he heard the mounted men ride in;\nand gathered, from the talk outside, that they had lost nearly two\nhundred men, and had been unable to prevent the Egyptian cavalry from\nreturning to camp. Towards evening he heard angry talking, and could\ndistinguish Mahmud's voice. Then the blanket was pulled off its\nsupports, and two men ordered him to follow them.\n\nThis was doubtless the end, and he nerved himself for what was to come;\nand, with head erect and a steady face, he accompanied the men to the\nfront of Mahmud's tent. The chief was standing, with frowning face; and\nseveral Emirs were gathered in front of him, while a number of\ntribesmen stood a short distance away.\n\n\"Now,\" Mahmud said, \"let one of you speak.\"\n\nOne of the Emirs stepped forward.\n\n\"I, Osman Digna, demand that this infidel be put to death. His\ncountrymen have slain many of my men, and yours.\"\n\nFeeling now that Mahmud, after doing his best, had ceased to struggle\nfor him, and that his death was certain, Gregory took a step forward\ntowards the speaker, and said scornfully:\n\n\"So you are Osman Digna! I am one of the first of my countrymen to see\nyour face, though many have seen your back, at a distance.\"\n\nInstead of provoking a pistol shot, as he had intended, his remark was\nfollowed by a roar of laughter from the emirs; for Osman's cowardice\nwas a byword among them, and his nickname was \"One who always runs.\"\n\nOsman, indeed, had put his hand on the stock of one of the pistols in\nhis belt, but Mahmud said imperiously:\n\n\"The man's life is mine, not yours, Osman Digna. If you shoot him, I\nshoot you!\"\n\nThe fearlessness of the lad had pleased the other emirs; for,\nrecklessly brave themselves, the Baggara appreciated and esteemed\ncourage and honour. One of the others said:\n\n\"This is a brave young fellow and, infidels as his people are, we admit\nthat they are brave. Were it for ourselves only, we would say let him\nlive, until we see what comes of it. But our people complain. They say\nhis folk, with whom we had no quarrel, come here and aid the Egyptians\nagainst us. They slew many yesterday. It is not right that this man\nshould be living among us, when his countrymen are fighting against\nus.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of assent among the others, then Mahmud spoke.\n\n\"I have promised that he should not be killed, unless by order of the\nKhalifa. But this I will do: he shall be placed in the front rank. If\nAllah wills it, he will be killed by the bullets of his countrymen. If,\nwhen the fight is over, he is unharmed, you shall all agree that the\nmatter be left for the Khalifa to decide. But, mind, I wash my hands of\nhis death. On the eve of a battle, it is not for me to set my wishes\nabove those of my emirs and my tribesmen; and I yield to your demands,\nbecause it is necessary that all be of one mind. If he is killed, which\nsurely he will be, unless Allah protects him, his blood be upon your\nheads!\"\n\nHe waved his hand, and the men came forward and again took Gregory to\nhis tent.\n\nThe latter was well contented with the decision that he should be\nkilled. He had no doubt that, at least, his death would be swift and\nsudden; he would not be speared, or cut to pieces with knives. He would\nsee his countrymen advancing. He would know that he would be speedily\navenged.\n\nTwo days passed, when the news came that the Egyptians had advanced to\nUmdabieh, seven miles nearer; and, on the following morning, the\nDervish camp was disturbed early. There was joy in every face, and\nrenewed vigour in the bearing of the men. Scouting Dervishes had\nbrought in word that the infidels had marched, during the night, and\nwere now halting but a mile and a half away.\n\nThe hour had come, at last. They were confident in themselves, and\ntheir trust in their leader was renewed. The fight, two days before,\nhad shown them that the guns of the white men were terrible on the\nplain; and that it was, after all, wise to await them in the position\nwhich had been made impregnable, and against which the foe would hurl\nthemselves in vain; then they were to pour out, and annihilate them.\n\nThe slave came to Gregory's tent, at daybreak.\n\n\"Fatma is praying to Allah for your safety,\" he said.\n\nThere was no time for more, for already the tents were being pulled\ndown, and soon the women were hurried away to the rear. Four men\nsurrounded Gregory, and led him to the edge of the camp, and there\nfastened him to the stump of a tree that had been cut off six feet from\nthe ground, the upper portion being used in the construction of the\nzareba. Ten or twelve men were similarly fastened, in a line with him.\nThese had been detected in trying to sneak away.\n\nGregory had not seen anything of the camp before and, as he was taken\nalong, he was astounded at the amount of work that had been done.\nEverywhere the ground was pitted with deep holes, capable of sheltering\nfrom fifteen to twenty men. The hedge was a high one, and was formed\nfor the most part of prickly bushes. The position was, indeed, a\nformidable one; manned, as it was, by nearly twenty thousand desperate\nfighters.\n\nAt six o'clock the first gun was fired; and, for an hour and a half,\nthe camp was swept with shell, shrapnel, and Maxim bullets. Most of the\nBaggara were lying in the pits. Many, however, walked about calmly, as\nif in contempt of the fire. More than half of the wretched men bound to\nthe trees were killed.\n\nAt last the fire of the guns slackened and, on the crest of the\nposition, in a semicircle round the wood, a long line of steadily\nmarching men appeared. The assault was about to begin.\n\nThe Dervishes sprang from their hiding places, and lined the trenches\nbehind the zareba. The troops halted, and waited. The Maxims moved in\nfront of the British brigade, and then opened fire. A bugle sounded,\nand the whole line, black and white, advanced like a wall. When within\nthree hundred yards, the men knelt down and opened fire, in volleys of\nsections. At the same instant the Dervishes, with difficulty restrained\nuntil now, opened fire in return.\n\nThe Maxims, and the storm of British bullets swept the wood, filling\nthe air with a shower of falling leaves. Gregory murmured a prayer,\nshut his eyes, and awaited death.\n\nSuddenly he felt his ropes slacken and fall from him, and a voice said,\n\"Drop on your face, master!\"\n\nAlmost mechanically he obeyed, too astonished even to think what was\nhappening; then a body fell across him.\n\n\"Lie still and don't move, master. They must think you are dead.\"\n\n\"Is it you, Zaki?\" Gregory said, scarcely able, even now, to believe\nthat it was his faithful follower.\n\n\"It is I, master. I have been in the camp three days, and have never\nhad a chance of getting near you, before.\"\n\n\"Brave fellow! good friend!\" Gregory said, and then was silent.\n\nSpeech was almost inaudible, amid the roar of battle. The pipes of the\nCamerons could, however, be heard above the din. The men advanced\nsteadily, in line, maintaining their excellent volley firing. The three\nother regiments, in close order, followed; bearing away farther to the\nright, so as to be able to open fire and advance. On that side the\nblack regiments were advancing no less steadily, and the half brigade\nof Egyptians were as eager as any. Steadily and well under control, all\npushed forward at a run; firing occasionally, but thirsting to get hand\nto hand with those who had desolated their land, destroyed their\nvillages, and slain their friends.\n\nThe British were suffering, but the blacks suffered more; for the\nvolleys of the Camerons kept down the fire of those opposed to them,\nbetter than the irregular fire of the Soudanese. The latter, however,\nfirst reached the zareba; and, regardless of thorns or of fire, dashed\nthrough it with triumphant shouts, and fell upon the defenders.\n\nIt was but a minute or two later that the Camerons reached the hedge.\nFormidable as it looked, it took them but a short time to tear down\ngaps, through which they rushed; while close behind them the Seaforths,\nthe Lincolns, and the Warwicks were all in, bursting through the low\nstockade and trenches behind it, and cheering madly.\n\nNow, from their holes and shelters, the Dervishes started up. Brave\nthough they were, the storm that had burst upon them with such\nsuddenness scared them, and none attempted to arrest the course of the\nHighlanders and red coats. Firing as they ran, the Dervishes made for\nthe river. Many remained in their pits till the last, firing at the\nsoldiers as they rushed past, and meeting their death at the point of\nthe bayonet.\n\nHotly the troops pursued, often falling into the pits, which were half\nhidden by thorns and long grass. There was no attempt at regularity in\nthese holes--nothing to show where they were. It was a wild and\nconfused combat. The officers kept their men as well together as it was\npossible, on such ground; but it was sharp work, for from flank and\nrear, as well as in front, the shots rang out from their hidden foes,\nand these had to be despatched as they pushed forward.\n\nAs the troops burst through, Gregory sprang to his feet, seized a rifle\nthat had dropped from the hands of a Dervish who had fallen close by\nand--shouting to Zaki \"Lie still as if dead!\"--joined the first line of\ntroops. No questions were asked. Every man's attention was fixed on the\nwork before him, and no thought was given to this white officer, who\nsprang from they knew not where. He had no cartridges, and the\nDervishes did not carry bayonets; but, holding the rifle club-wise, he\nkept in the front line, falling into pits and climbing out again,\nengaged more than once with desperate foemen.\n\nStriking and shouting, he fought on until the troops reached the river\nbank; and, having cleared all before them, poured volleys into the mass\nof fugitives crossing its dry bed. Other hordes were seen away to the\nleft, similarly driven out by Lewis's Egyptians, by whom a terrible\nfire was kept up until the last of the fugitives disappeared in the\nscrub on the opposite bank, leaving the river bed thickly dotted with\ndead bodies; while, on the right, Macdonald's and Maxwell's blacks\nsimilarly cleared the wood.\n\nThen the Soudanese and whites alike burst into cheers. Men shook each\nother by the hand, while they waved their helmets over their heads. The\nSoudanese leapt and danced like delighted children. Presently an\nofficer left a group of others, who had been congratulating each other\non their glorious victory, and came up to Gregory.\n\n\"May I ask who you are, sir?\" he said, courteously but coldly.\n\n\"Certainly, sir. My name is Hilliard. I have been a captive in the\nhands of the Dervishes; who, when you attacked, tied me to the stump of\na tree as a target for your bullets; and I should certainly have been\nkilled, had not a faithful servant of mine, a black, taken the\nopportunity, when the Dervishes rushed into the trenches and opened\nfire upon you, to cut my ropes.\n\n\"I have no doubt, sir,\" he went on, as he saw the officer look somewhat\ndoubtful, \"that General Hunter is here. I am known personally to him,\nand served for a time on his staff.\"\n\n\"That is quite sufficient,\" the officer said, more cordially. \"I\ncongratulate you on your escape. I confess it astonished us all, when a\nstrange white officer, whom none of us knew, suddenly joined us. You\nwill find General Hunter somewhere over on the left. He is certain to\nhave led the charge of the Soudanese.\"\n\n\"Thank you! I will go and find him; but first, I must return to where I\nleft my man. He had, of course, the Mahdist's patch on his clothes; and\nI told him to lie still, as if dead, till I came for him; as, in the\nmelee, it would have been impossible for me to have protected him.\"\n\nGregory found Zaki still lying where he left him, head downward and\narms thrown forward; in so good an imitation of death that he feared,\nfor a moment, the lad had been shot after he left him. At the sound of\nhis master's voice, however, the native sprang to his feet.\n\n\"You have saved my life, Zaki,\" Gregory said, taking his hand. \"I must\nhave fallen--every man tied to a tree is, as you see, dead; but before\nwe say anything else, cut that patch off your clothes, or you might be\nshot as a Dervish by the first man you come across.\n\n\"Keep close to me. I am going to General Hunter. At present, I know\nnone of the officers of the white regiments. When I get among the\nSoudanese, I shall be more at home.\"\n\nIn ten minutes, he came to where General Hunter was speaking to the\nSirdar. Gregory stopped at a short distance, before the general's eyes\nfell upon him, and he gave an exclamation of pleasure.\n\n\"That is Hilliard, General; the young fellow who jumped from one of the\ngunboats, off Metemmeh, to rescue the woman. The act was unnoticed at\nthe time, but a black he had with him was released, and brought word\nthat his master was a prisoner in their camp.\"\n\n\"I heard of it, at the time,\" the Sirdar said, and motioned to Gregory\nto come up. \"I am glad to find that you have escaped the fate we feared\nhad befallen you, but your action was altogether wrong. An officer's\nlife is no longer his own, but belongs to the country he serves; and\nyou had no right whatever to risk it when on duty, even in an action\nwhich, at any other time, would do you great credit.\"\n\nHe spoke sharply and sternly. Gregory again saluted.\n\n\"I knew afterwards that I had done wrong, sir; but I did not stop to\nthink, and acted on the impulse of the moment.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" the Sirdar said; \"but officers should think, and not act\non the impulse of the moment.\"\n\nGregory again saluted, and fell back. Three or four minutes later, the\ntwo generals separated. General Hunter came up to him, and shook him\nwarmly by the hand.\n\n\"You must not mind what the Sirdar said, Hilliard. It was a very noble\naction, and did you credit, and I can assure you that that was the\nopinion of all who knew you; but to the Sirdar, you know, duty is\neverything, and I think you are lucky in not being sent down, at once,\nto the base. However, he said to me, after you had left him:\n\n\"'I shall be too busy this evening, but bring the young fellow with\nyou, tomorrow evening. I must hear how it was that Mahmud spared him.'\n\n\"I told him that I understood, from your black, that the woman was\nMahmud's favourite wife, and that she took you under her care.\n\n\"By the way, have you heard that Mahmud is captured? Yes, he is caught,\nwhich is a great satisfaction to us; for his being sent down, a\nprisoner, will convince the tribesmen that we have gained a victory, as\nto which they would otherwise be incredulous. I hear that the Egyptian\nbrigade, which was to the extreme left, has captured Mahmud's wife, and\na great number of women.\"\n\n\"With your permission, sir, I will go over there at once, and ask\nColonel Lewis that she may receive specially good treatment. She has\nbeen extremely kind to me, and it is to her influence over Mahmud that\nI owe my life. Up to this morning Mahmud would have spared me, but\nOsman Digna insisted that I should be killed, and he was obliged to\ngive way. They fastened me to a tree behind the trench, just inside the\nzareba, and I should certainly have been killed by our own musketry\nfire, had not my boy, who had come into the camp in disguise, cut my\ncords. I fell as if shot, and he threw himself down on me; until the\nCamerons burst in, when I at once joined them, and did what little I\ncould in the fight.\"\n\n\"I will give you a line to Colonel Lewis, to tell him that Mahmud's\nwife, whom you will point out, is to be treated with respect; and that\nher people may be allowed to make her an arbour of some sort, until the\nSirdar decides what is to be done with her. Probably she will be sent\ndown to Berber. No doubt we shall all fall back.\"\n\n\"Then you will not pursue, sir?\"\n\n\"No. The cavalry have already gone off in pursuit of their horsemen,\nbut they are not likely to catch them; for we hear that Osman Digna is\nwith them, and he seems to enjoy a special immunity from capture. As\nfor the other poor beggars, we could not do it if we wanted to. I\nexpect the campaign is over, for the present. Certainly, nothing can be\ndone till the railway is completed; then the gunboats can tow the\nnative craft, abreast of us, as we march along the river bank.\n\n\"Shendy has been captured, and we found twelve thousand Jaalin\nprisoners there, women and children, and a large quantity of stores.\nThat is what makes the position of the Dervish fugitives so hopeless.\nThere is nothing before them but to find their way across the desert to\nOmdurman, and I fancy that few of them will get there alive.\n\n\"No doubt some will keep along by the Atbara, and others by the Nile.\nThe latter will have the best chance, for the friendlies at Kassala\nwill be on the lookout for fugitives. I am sorry for the poor wretches,\nthough they richly deserve the worst that can befall them. They have\nnever shown mercy. For twenty years they have murdered, plundered, and\ndesolated the whole land, and have shown themselves more ferocious and\nmerciless than wild beasts.\"\n\nHe took out his pocketbook, wrote the order to Colonel Lewis; and then,\ntearing the leaf out, handed it to Gregory, who at once made his way,\nfollowed closely by Zaki, to the spot where two Egyptian battalions had\nhalted. They had no difficulty in finding Colonel Lewis, who was\nreceiving a report, from the officers of the two battalions, of the\ncasualties they had sustained. Gregory had met the Colonel several\ntimes, at Berber, and the latter recognized him at once.\n\n\"Ah! Major Hilliard,\" that officer said, as he came up; \"I am glad to\nsee you. I heard that you had been captured by the Dervishes, and\nkilled; but I suppose, as I see you here, that it was only the usual\ncanard.\"\n\n\"No, sir. I was captured; but, as you see, not killed, though it has\nbeen a pretty close thing. This is a note, sir, that General Hunter\nrequested me to give you.\"\n\nColonel Lewis read the order.\n\n\"The women are down over there, a couple of hundred yards away,\" he\nsaid. \"I will send a sergeant and four men with you. If you will point\nout Mahmud's wife, I will see that she is made as comfortable as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir! It is to her I owe my life, and I am most anxious to\ndo all I can to repay the debt.\"\n\n\"You came along through the other brigades. Do you know what their\nlosses have been?\"\n\n\"The British losses are not heavy, sir, considering the fire they have\nbeen exposed to. Macdonald's brigade suffered most, I believe.\"\n\n\"Yes; I saw one of the officers just now. It seems they came down upon\nMahmud's picked bodyguard, and these fought desperately. They found\nMahmud in the usual attitude in which the Dervish emirs await death,\nwhen they are conquered. He was sitting quietly on his mat, with his\narms laid down beside him; and was, I should imagine, somewhat\nsurprised at finding that he was not cut to pieces, at once.\"\n\n\"I am glad he was not, sir, for he certainly behaved well to me. It was\nthrough the influence of his wife, I admit; but in sparing me he really\nrisked serious disaffection among his followers, and at last gave way\nonly to coercion.\"\n\nThe sergeant and men had now come up, and Gregory went off with them.\nThree or four hundred women were seated on the ground together, with\nhalf a dozen Egyptian soldiers standing as sentry over them. More or\nless closely veiled as they were, Gregory could not distinguish Fatma\namong them; and indeed, except when he first reached her in the water,\nhe had not got a glimpse of her features. The question, however, was\nspeedily settled when a woman rose, in the middle of the group, with a\ncry of gladness.\n\n\"So you are saved!\" she exclaimed, \"I have feared so that you were\nkilled. Have you news of Mahmud?\"\n\n\"Yes, lady. He is a prisoner, but well and unharmed. I have obtained an\norder, from the General, that you are to be treated with honours, as\nhis wife. We cannot do much for you, at present, but all that is\npossible will be done. I have represented your kindness to me, and\nthese soldiers will at once erect an arbour for you, and food will be\nbrought for you all, as soon as matters have settled down a little.\"\n\nThe Egyptian soldiers had already begun to cut down saplings.\nAccustomed as they were to the work, in half an hour they had erected\nan arbour. Fatma was then assisted into it, with the other women of the\nharem. The sergeant gave orders, to the sentries, that no one was to be\nallowed to interfere in any way with them; and then Gregory took his\nleave, saying that he would return, later on.\n\nHe again joined General Hunter, who seemed to be his natural chief, now\nthat his service in the gunboat was over.\n\nThe list of casualties was now being brought in. The Camerons, who had\nled the attack in line, had lost most heavily. They had fifteen killed\nand forty-six wounded, among them being two officers killed, and one\nmortally wounded. The Seaforths had one officer killed and one mortally\nwounded, and four others less severely; in all, six killed and\ntwenty-seven wounded. The Lincolns had one killed and eighteen wounded;\nthe Warwicks two killed and eighteen wounded. Many of the wounded\nafterwards died.\n\nThe Egyptians had lost more heavily. The casualties among them were\nfifty-seven killed; and four British and sixteen native officers, and\nthree hundred and sixty-seven non-commissioned officers and men,\nwounded.\n\nThe Dervish loss was terrible. Three thousand men were killed, among\nwhom were nearly all the emirs; and two thousand were taken prisoners.\nThe rest were hopeless fugitives, and a vast number of these must have\nbeen wounded.\n\nThere was but a short rest for the troops. When the wounded had been\ncollected, and carried to a neighbouring palm grove, where the surgeons\ndid all that could then be done for them; and the trophies of the\nfight--banners and spears, guns of all sorts, swords and knives--had\nbeen gathered, principally by the exultant Soudanese and Egyptians, the\nforce prepared for a start.\n\n\"May I ask, General, what is to be done with the women?\" Gregory said.\n\n\"I have been speaking to the Sirdar about them, and I was just going to\nask you to go with me to them. They are, of course, not to be\nconsidered as prisoners. They cannot stay here, for they would die of\nhunger. Therefore they had best follow the troops, at any rate as far\nas the Atbara camp. They will have food given them, and must then\ndecide for themselves what they are to do. It is a difficult question,\naltogether. The only thing that can, at present, be settled is that\nthey mustn't be allowed to die of hunger, and they must be protected\nagainst molestation.\n\n\"The troops will march at four o'clock. The Egyptian brigade have\nvolunteered to carry the wounded. They will start later. The women had\nbetter follow them. No doubt, some of them will find their husbands\namong the prisoners, so that there will be no trouble about them.\"\n\n\"What will be done with the men, sir?\"\n\nThe General smiled.\n\n\"Tomorrow they will probably enlist in our service, to a man, and will\nfight just as sturdily as the other Soudanese battalions, against their\nbrethren in Khartoum. All the prisoners we have hitherto taken who are\nfit for the work have done so; and, as has been shown today, are just\nas ready to fight on our side as they were against us. They are a\nfighting people, and it is curious how they become attached to their\nwhite officers, whom formerly they hated as infidels.\"\n\nWhen the matter was explained to them, the women accepted the situation\nwith the resignation that is natural to the Mahometan woman. Gregory\nwas able to assure Fatma that, in a short time, she would undoubtedly\nbe allowed to join Mahmud, and accompany him wherever he was sent.\n\n\"But will they not kill him?\" she said.\n\n\"We never kill prisoners. Even the bitterest enemy that may fall into\nour hands is well treated. Mahmud will doubtless be sent down to Cairo,\nand it will then be settled where he is to be taken to; but you may be\nsure that, wherever it may be, he will be well treated and cared for.\"\n\n\"In that case, I shall be happy,\" she said. \"When you saved me, I saw\nthat the ways of you Christians were better than our ways. Now I see it\nstill more. To be always raiding, and plundering, and killing cannot be\ngood. It used to seem to me natural and right, but I have come to think\ndifferently.\"\n\nAt four o'clock the troops marched. At Gregory's request, he was\nallowed to remain behind and accompany the Egyptians. He had bought for\na few shillings, from the soldiers, a dozen donkeys that had been found\nalive in some of the pits. These he handed over to Fatma, for her\nconveyance and that of the wives of some of the emirs, who were of the\nparty.\n\nThe Egyptians started at half-past eight, carrying their own wounded\nand those of the British. By the route by which the army had marched,\nthe night before, the distance was but nine miles; but there had been\nsome rough places to pass, and to avoid these, where the wounded might\nhave suffered from jolting, they made a circuit, thereby adding three\nmiles to the length of the march; and did not reach Umdabieh camp until\ntwo o'clock in the morning. General Hunter, who never spared himself,\nrode with them and acted as guide.\n\nDuring the fight he, Colonel Macdonald, and Colonel Maxwell had ridden\nat the head of their brigades, the white regimental officers being on\nfoot with the men, as was their custom; and it was surprising that the\nthree conspicuous figures had all come through the storm of fire\nunscathed.\n\nThe next morning was a quiet one, and in the afternoon all marched off\nto the old camp, at Abadar. On Sunday they rested, and on Monday the\nBritish brigade marched to Hudi, and then across the desert to Hermali,\nwhere they were to spend the summer. The Sirdar rode, with the Egyptian\nbrigades, to Fort Atbara. Macdonald's brigade was to go on to garrison\nBerber, Maxwell's to Assillem, and that of Lewis to remain at Atbara.\n\nThe question of the prisoners was already half solved. Almost all of\nthem willingly embraced the offer to enlist in the Egyptian army. Many\nof the women found their husbands among the prisoners. Others agreed,\nat once, to marry men of the Soudanese battalion. The rest, pending\nsuch offers as they might receive in the future, decided to remain at\nAtbara. At Berber their lot would have been a hard one, for they would\nhave been exposed to the hatred and spite of the Jaalin women there,\nwhose husbands had been massacred at Metemmeh.\n\nFatma, with two attendants only, accompanied Macdonald's brigade to\nBerber. On arriving outside the town, the force encamped. Next day the\nSirdar, with his staff and General Hunter, came up; and, on the\nfollowing morning, made a triumphant entry into the town, followed by\nthe Soudanese brigade.\n\nBerber was prepared to do honour to the occasion. Flags waved, coloured\ncloths and women's garments hung from the windows, and the whole\npopulation lined the streets, and received the conquerors with cries of\nwelcome and triumph. They had anticipated a very different result, and\nhad fully expected that the army would have been well-nigh annihilated;\nand that, again, the triumphant Dervishes would become their masters.\nBut the sight of Mahmud walking, a prisoner, with two guards on each\nside of him, convinced them that the reports that had reached them were\ntrue, that the Dervishes had been signally defeated, and that there was\nno fear of their ever again becoming lords of Berber.\n\nThe Sirdar, by whose side General Hunter rode, headed the procession,\nfollowed by his staff. Then, leading his brigade, came Macdonald--stern\nand hard of face, burnt almost black with years of campaigning in the\ndesert--and his staff, followed by the black battalions, erect and\nproud, maintaining their soldierly bearing amid the loud quavering\ncries of welcome from the women.\n\nGregory had, on his arrival with the brigade the day before, gone into\nthe town; and engaged a small house, in its outskirts, as the abode of\nFatma and her two attendants, purchased suitable provisions, and made\nwhat arrangements he could for her comfort. Late in the evening he had\nescorted her there, and left Zaki to sleep in an outhouse attached to\nit, to secure them from all intrusion.\n\nThen he went down to the river and, finding the Zafir lying there, went\non board. He was received as one returned from the dead by Captain\nKeppel, Lieutenant Beatty, and Lieutenant Hood--the commanders of the\nother gunboats--who had been dining on board. He had become a general\nfavourite, during the time he had spent with them, and their\ncongratulations on his safe return were warm and hearty.\n\n\"You may imagine our surprise when, after the fight was over,\" said\nCaptain Keppel, \"it was discovered that you were missing. No one could\nimagine what had become of you. One of the blacks who had been working\nyour Maxim said they had not noticed your leaving them; and that, when\nthey found you were not there, they supposed you had come to confer\nwith me. Then I sent for your man; but he, too, was missing. We\nsearched everywhere, but no signs of you, dead or alive, and no marks\nof blood were to be found. So it seemed that the matter must remain a\nmystery. Early the next morning, however, we saw a white rag waving on\nthe bank, and then a black entered the water and swam out towards us. I\nsent the boat to meet him, and when he came on board I found that he\nwas your man, and the mystery was explained. I fancy I used some strong\nlanguage; for I never before heard of a man being so hare-brained as to\nspring overboard, in the middle of a battle, and pick up a woman,\nwithout saying a word to anyone of what he was doing, and that with the\nboat still steaming ahead. Of course, your man told us that it was\nMahmud's wife you had saved, and that she had taken you under her\nprotection; but I did not expect that, among those fanatics, your life\nwould be spared.\n\n\"Now, tell us all about your adventures, and how you got down here just\nin time to see our fellows enter, in triumph. I suppose you managed to\ngive them the slip, somehow?\"\n\nGregory then told his story. When he had concluded, Captain Keppel\nsaid:\n\n\"Well, you have the luck of the old one! First, you have got hold of as\nfaithful a fellow as is to be found in all Egypt, or anywhere else;\nand, in the second place, you have been in the battle of Atbara, while\nwe have been kicking our heels here, and fuming at being out of it\naltogether, except for our bloodless capture of Shendy.\n\n\"So you say the Sirdar blew you up? I am not surprised at that. You\nknow the story of the man who fell overboard, in the old flogging days,\nand the captain sentenced him to two dozen lashes, for leaving the ship\nwithout orders.\"\n\n\"I don't think he was really angry; for when I went to him, the next\nevening, he was a good deal milder. Of course, he did say again that I\nhad done wrong, but not in the same tone as before; and he seemed a\ngood deal interested in what I told him about Mahmud, and how my boy\nhad risked his life to rescue me, and had succeeded almost by a\nmiracle. He said there is a lot of good in these black fellows, if one\ncould but get at it. They have never had a chance yet; but, given good\nadministration, and the suppression of all tribal feuds with a stern\nhand, they might be moulded into anything.\"\n\n\"And are you coming back to us now, Mr. Hilliard?\"\n\n\"I have no idea. I don't suppose anything will be settled, for a time.\nThere is not likely to be much doing, anyway, except on the railway;\nand even your gunboats will have an easy time of it, as there is not an\nenemy left on this side of the sixth cataract.\n\n\"The Dervishes who escaped are pretty sure to cross the Atbara. There\nare enough of them still, when they rally, to beat off any attacks that\nmight be made by our tribesmen from Kassala.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 13: The Final Advance.\n\n\nA few days after the return of headquarters to Berber, Mahmud was sent\ndown country, and Fatma was permitted to accompany him. She expressed\nto Gregory, in touching terms, her gratitude for what he had done for\nher.\n\n\"We have been of mutual assistance,\" said Gregory. \"I have the same\nreason to be grateful to you, as you have to thank me. I saved your\nlife, and you saved mine. You were very kind to me, when I was a\ncaptive--I have done as much as I could for you, since you have been\nwith us. So we are quits. I hope you will be happy with Mahmud. We do\nnot treat our prisoners badly, and except that he will be away from the\nSoudan, he will probably be more comfortable than he has ever been in\nhis life.\"\n\nGregory was now employed in the transport department, and journeyed\nbackwards and forwards, with large convoys of camels, to the head of\nthe railway. The line was completed to Berber, but the officers charged\nwith its construction were indefatigable; and, as fast as the materials\ncame up, it was pushed on towards the Atbara. Complete as had been the\nvictory on that river, the Sirdar saw that the force which had been\nsufficient to defeat the twenty thousand men, under Mahmud, was not\nsufficiently strong for the more onerous task of coping with three\ntimes that number, fighting under the eye of the Khalifa, and certain\nto consist of his best and bravest troops. He therefore telegraphed\nhome for another British brigade, and additional artillery, with at\nleast one regiment of cavalry--an arm in which the Egyptian Army was\nweak.\n\nPreparations were at once made for complying with the request. The 21st\nLancers, 1st battalion of Grenadier Guards, 2nd battalion of the Rifle\nBrigade, 2nd battalion of the 5th Lancashire Fusiliers, a field\nbattery, a howitzer battery, and two forty-pounders, to batter the\ndefences of Omdurman, should the Khalifa take his stand, were sent. A\nstrong detachment of the Army Service Corps and the Royal Army Medical\nCorps was to accompany them, but they had yet some months to wait, for\nthe advance would not be made until the Nile was full, and the gunboats\ncould ascend the cataract.\n\nHowever, there was much to be done, and the troops did not pass the\ntime in idleness. Atbara Fort was to be the base, and here the Egyptian\nbattalions built huts and storehouses. The Soudanese brigades returned\nto Berber, and the transport of provisions and stores for them was thus\nsaved. The British at Darmali were made as comfortable as possible, and\nno effort was spared to keep them in good health, during the ensuing\nhot weather. A small theatre was constructed, and here smoking concerts\nwere held. There was also a race meeting, and one of the steamers took\nparties, of the men who were most affected by the heat, for a trip down\nthe Nile. They were practised in long marches early in the morning, and\nalthough, of course, there was some illness, the troops on the whole\nbore the heat well.\n\nHad there been a prospect of an indefinitely long stay, the result\nmight have been otherwise; but they knew that, in a few months, they\nwould be engaged in even sterner work than the last battle, that\nKhartoum was their goal, and with its capture the power of the Khalifa\nwould be broken for ever, and Gordon avenged.\n\nEarly in April the railway reached Abadia, a few miles from Berber, and\nin a short time a wonderful transformation took place here. From a\nsandy desert, with scarce a human being in sight, it became the scene\nof a busy industry. Stores were sorted and piled as they came up by\nrail.\n\nThree gunboats arrived in sections, and these were put together. They\nwere stronger, and much better defended by steel plates than the first\ngunboats; and each of them carried two six-pounder quick-firing guns, a\nsmall howitzer, four Maxims, and a searchlight. They were, however,\nmuch slower than the old boats, and could do very little in the way of\ntowing.\n\nBesides these, eight steel double-deck troop barges were brought up, in\nsections, and put together. Three Egyptian battalions came up from\nMerawi to aid in the work, which not only included building the\ngunboats and barges, but executing the repairs to all the native craft,\nand putting them in a thoroughly serviceable state.\n\nIn June the railway reached the Atbara, and for the first time for two\nyears and a half, the officers who had superintended its construction\nhad a temporary rest. The stores were now transferred from Abadia to\nthe Atbara, and two trains ran every day, each bringing up something\nlike two hundred tons of stores.\n\nIn the middle of July two Egyptian battalions left Atbara and proceeded\nup the Nile, one on each bank, cutting down trees and piling them for\nfuel for the steamers. As the river rose, four steamers came up from\nDongola, together with a number of sailing boats; and in the beginning\nof August the whole flotilla, consisting of ten gunboats, five unarmed\nsteamers, eight troop barges, and three or four hundred sailing boats,\nwere all assembled.\n\nBy this time the reinforcements from home were all at Cairo, and their\nstores had already been sent up. It was arranged that they were to come\nby half battalions, by squadrons, and by batteries, each one day behind\nthe other. To make room for them, two Egyptian battalions were sent up\nto the foot of the Shabluka cataract.\n\nThe six black battalions left Berber on July 30th, and arrived at\nAtbara the next day. There were now four brigades in the infantry\ndivisions instead of three, two battalions having been raised from the\nDervishes taken at the battle of Atbara. These were as eager as any to\njoin in the fight against their late comrades.\n\nThis was scarcely surprising. The Baggara, the tyrants of the desert,\nare horsemen. The infantry were, for the most part, drawn from the\nconquered tribes. They had enlisted in the Khalifa's force partly\nbecause they had no other means of subsistence, partly from their\ninnate love of fighting. They had, in fact, been little better than\nslaves; and their condition, as soldiers in the Egyptian Army, was\nimmeasurably superior to that which they had before occupied.\n\nBroadwood, with nine squadrons of Egyptian cavalry, was already on the\nwestern bank of the river opposite Atbara; and was to be joined at\nMetemmeh by the camel corps, and another squadron of horse from Merawi.\n\nOn the 3rd of August the six Soudanese battalions left Fort Atbara for\nthe point of concentration, a few miles below the cataract. To the\nsides of each gunboat were attached two of the steel barges; behind\neach were two native craft. All were filled as tightly as they could be\ncrammed with troops. They were packed as in slavers, squatting by the\nside of each other as closely as sardines in a box. The seven steamers\nand the craft they took with them contained six thousand men, so\ncrowded that a spectator remarked that planks might have been laid on\ntheir heads, and that you could have walked about on them; while\nanother testified that he could not have shoved a walking stick between\nthem anywhere. White men could not have supported it for an hour, but\nthese blacks and Egyptians had a hundred miles to go, and the steamers\ncould not make more than a knot an hour against the rapid stream, now\nswollen to its fullest.\n\nWhile they were leaving, the first four companies of the Rifle Brigade\narrived. Every day boats laden with stores went forward, every day\nwhite troops came up. Vast as was the quantity of stores sent off, the\npiles at Atbara did not seem to diminish. Ninety days' provisions,\nforage, and necessaries for the whole force had been accumulated there,\nand as fast as these were taken away they were replaced by others from\nBerber.\n\nLike everyone connected with the transport or store department, Gregory\nhad to work from daybreak till dark. Accustomed to a warm climate,\nlight in figure, without an ounce of spare flesh, he was able to\nsupport the heat, dust, and fatigue better than most; and, as he\nhimself said, it was less trying to be at work, even in the blazing\nsun, than to lie listless and sweating under the shade of a blanket.\nThere was no necessity, now, to go down the line to make enquiries as\nto the progress of the stores, or of the laden craft on their way up.\nthe telegraph was established, and the Sirdar, at Atbara, knew the\nexact position of every one of the units between Cairo and himself; and\nfrom every station he received messages constantly, and despatched his\norders as frequently.\n\nThere was no hitch, whatever. The arrangements were all so perfect that\nthe vast machine, with its numerous parts, moved with the precision of\nclockwork. Everything was up to time. For a train or steamer, or even a\nnative boat, to arrive half an hour after the time calculated for it,\nwas almost unheard of.\n\nThe Sirdar's force of will seemed to communicate itself to every\nofficer under him, and it is safe to say that never before was an\nexpedition so perfectly organized, and so marvellously carried out. At\nAtbara the Sirdar saw to everything himself. A brief word of\ncommendation, to those working under him, cheered them through long\ndays of toil--an equally curt reproof depressed them to the depths.\n\nTwice, when Gregory was directing some of the blacks piling large\ncases, as they were emptied from the train; anathematizing the stupid,\nurging on the willing, and himself occasionally lending a hand in order\nto show how it should be done; the Sirdar, who, unknown to him, had\nbeen looking on, rode up and said shortly, \"You are doing well, Mr.\nHilliard!\"--and he felt that his offence of jumping overboard had been\ncondoned.\n\nGeneral Hunter, himself indefatigable, had more occasion to notice\nGregory's work; and his commendations were frequent, and warm.\n\nThe lad had not forgotten the object with which he had come to the\nfront. After Atbara, he had questioned many of the prisoners who, from\ntheir age, might have fought at El Obeid; but none of these had done\nso. The forces of the Khalifa came and went, as there was occasion for\nthem. The Baggara were always under arms, but only when danger\nthreatened were the great levies of foot assembled; for it would have\nbeen impossible, in the now desolate state of the Soudan, to find food\nfor an army of a hundred thousand men.\n\nAll agreed, however, that, with the exception of the Egyptian\nartillerymen, they heard that no single white man had escaped. Numbers\nof the black soldiers had been made slaves. The whites had\nperished--all save one had fallen on the field. That one had\naccompanied a black battalion, who had held together and, repulsing all\nattacks, had marched away. They had been followed, however, and after\nrepeated attacks had dwindled away, until they had finally been broken\nand massacred.\n\nWith the Khalifa's army were several emirs who had fought at El Obeid;\nand these would, no doubt, be able to tell him more; but none of those\nwho were taken prisoners, at the Atbara, had heard of any white man\nhaving escaped the slaughter of Hicks's army.\n\nJust as the general movement began, the force was joined by three\ncompanies of Soudanese. These had marched from Suakim to Berber, two\nhundred and eighty-eight miles, in fifteen days, an average of nineteen\nmiles a day--a record for such a march, and one that no European force\ncould have performed. One day, after marching thirty miles, they came\nto a well and found it dry, and had to march thirty miles farther to\nanother water hole, a feat probably altogether without precedent.\n\n\"You had better fall back upon your old work, Hilliard,\" the General\nsaid, the day before they started. \"As my aide I shall find plenty for\nyou to do, now that I command the whole division.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir! I don't think that I shall find any work\nhard, after what I have been doing for the past four months.\"\n\n\"You have got your horse?\"\n\n\"Yes; he is in good condition, for I have had no riding to do, for some\ntime.\"\n\n\"Well, you had better get him on board one of the gyasses we shall tow\nup, tomorrow. All our horses will embark this evening. We shall be on\nboard at daybreak. Our private camels are going with the marching\ncolumn; you had better put yours with them. No doubt they will join us\nsomewhere. Of course, your kit will be carried with us.\"\n\nIt was a delight to Gregory to be on the water again. There was\ngenerally a cool breeze on the river, and always an absence of dust. He\nwas now halfway between seventeen and eighteen, but the sun had tanned\nhim to a deep brown, and had parched his face; thus adding some years\nto his appearance, so that the subalterns of the newly-arrived\nregiments looked boyish beside him. The responsibilities of his work\nhad steadied him, and though he retained his good spirits, his laugh\nhad lost the old boyish ring. The title of Bimbashi, which had seemed\nabsurd to him seven months before, was now nothing out of the way, for\nhe looked as old as many of the British subalterns serving with that\nrank in the Egyptian army.\n\nReturning to the little hut that Zaki, with the aid of some of the\nblacks, had built for him; he gave his orders, and in a short time the\ncamel--a very good one, which he had obtained in exchange for that\nwhich he had handed over to the transport--started, with its driver, to\njoin those that were to carry up the baggage and stores of General\nHunter, and his staff. These were in charge of a sergeant and three\nprivates, of one of the Soudanese battalions. Gregory had got up a case\nof whisky, one of bottled fruit, and a stock of tea and sugar from\nBerber. No tents could be carried, and he left his tente d'abri at the\nstores with his canteen; taking on board, in his own luggage, a plate,\nknife, fork, and spoon, and a couple of tumblers. When the camels had\nstarted, he saw his horse put on board, and then took a final stroll\nround the encampment.\n\nThe change that had occurred there, during the past fortnight, was\nstriking. Then none but black faces could be seen. Now it was the\nencampment of a British force, with its white tents and all their\nbelongings.\n\nThe contrast between the newly-arrived brigade, and the hardy veterans\nwho had fought at the Atbara, was striking. Bronzed and hearty, inured\nto heat and fatigue, the latter looked fit to go anywhere and do\nanything, and there was hardly a sick man in the four regiments. On the\nother hand, the newcomers looked white and exhausted with the heat.\nNumbers had already broken down, and the doctors at the hospital had\ntheir hands full of fever patients. They had scarcely marched a mile\nsince they landed in Egypt, and were so palpably unfit for hard work\nthat they were, if possible, to proceed the whole way in boats, in\norder to be in fighting condition when the hour of battle arrived.\n\nThe voyage up the river was an uneventful one. It seemed all too short\nto Gregory, who enjoyed immensely the rest, quiet, and comparative\ncoolness. The Sirdar had gone up a week before they landed at Wady\nHamed. Here the whole Egyptian portion of the army, with the exception\nof the brigade that was to arrive the next day, was assembled. The\nblacks had constructed straw huts; the Egyptians erected shelters,\nextemporized from their blankets; while the British were to be\ninstalled in tents, which had been brought up in sailing boats. The\ncamp was two miles in length and half a mile wide, surrounded by a\nstrong zareba.\n\nThe Egyptian cavalry and the camel corps had arrived. On the opposite\nside of the river was a strong body of friendly Arabs, nominally under\nthe Abadar sheik, but in reality commanded by Major Montague\nStuart-Wortley. By the 23rd of August the whole force had arrived; and\nthe Sirdar reviewed them, drawn up in battle array, and put them\nthrough a few manoeuvres, as if in action. General Gatacre commanded\nthe British division--Colonel Wauchope the first brigade, and Lyttleton\nthe second. As before, Macdonald, Maxwell, and Lewis commanded the\nfirst three Egyptian brigades, and Collinson that newly raised, General\nHunter being in command of the division.\n\nThe force numbered, in all, about twenty thousand; and although\ndestitute of the glitter and colour of a British army, under ordinary\ncircumstances, were as fine a body of men as a British general could\nwish to command; and all, alike, eager to meet the foe. The British\ndivision had with them two batteries and ten Maxims, and the Egyptian\ndivision five batteries and ten Maxims.\n\nAs Gregory was strolling through the camp, he passed where the officers\nof one of the British regiments were seated on boxes, round a rough\ntable, over which a sort of awning had been erected.\n\n\"Come and join us, Hilliard. We are having our last feast on our last\nstores, which we got smuggled up in one of the gunboats,\" the Major\ncalled out.\n\n\"With pleasure, sir.\"\n\nThe officer who was sitting at the head of the table made room beside\nhim.\n\n\"You men of the Egyptian Army fare a good deal better than we do, I\nthink,\" the Major went on. \"That institution of private camels is an\nexcellent one. We did not know that they would be allowed. But, after\nall, it is not a bad thing that we did not have them, for there is no\ndoubt it is as well that the soldiers should not see us faring better\nthan they. There is bother enough with the baggage, as it is. Of\ncourse, it is different in your case. There are only two or three white\nofficers with each battalion, and it would not strike your black troops\nas a hardship that you should have different food from themselves. They\nare living as well as, or better than, they ever did in their lives.\nThree camels make no material addition to your baggage train, while, as\nthere are thirty or forty of us, it would make a serious item in ours,\nand the General's keen eyes would spot them at once.\"\n\n\"Our camels are no burden to the army,\" Gregory said. \"They only have a\nfew pounds of grain a day, and get their living principally on what\nthey can pick up. When they go on now, they will each carry fifty\npounds of private grain. They get five pounds when there are no bushes\nor grass, so that the grain will last them for a fortnight.\"\n\n\"I suppose you think that the Dervishes mean fighting?\"\n\n\"I think there is no doubt about it. All the fugitives that come in say\nthat the Khalifa will fight, but whether it will be in the defence of\nOmdurman, or whether he will come out and attack us at Kerreri, none\ncan say. The Khalifa keeps his intentions to himself.\"\n\n\"By the bye, Hilliard, I don't think you know my right-hand neighbour;\nhe only joined us an hour before we started, having been left behind at\nCairo, sick.\n\n\"Mr. Hartley, let me introduce you to Mr. Hilliard--I should say\nBimbashi Hilliard. He is on General Hunter's staff.\"\n\nThe young lieutenant placed an eyeglass in his eye, and bowed to\nGregory.\n\n\"Have you been in this beastly country long?\" he asked.\n\n\"If you include Lower Egypt, I have been here eighteen years.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" the other drawled; \"the climate seems to have agreed with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Fairly well,\" Gregory replied. \"I don't mind the heat much, and one\ndoesn't feel it, while one is at work.\"\n\n\"Hartley has not tried that, yet,\" one of the others laughed. \"Work is\nnot in his line. This most unfortunate illness of his kept him back at\nCairo, and he brought such a supply of ice with him, when he came up,\nthat he was able to hand over a hundredweight of it to us when he\narrived. I don't think, Major, that in introducing him you should have\nomitted to mention that, but for a temporary misfortune, he would be\nthe Marquis of Langdale; but in another two years he will blossom out\ninto his full title, and then I suppose we shall lose him.\"\n\nGregory, whose knowledge of the English peerage was extremely limited,\nlooked puzzled.\n\n\"May I ask how that is?\" he said. \"I always thought that the next heir\nto a title succeeded to it, as soon as his father died.\"\n\n\"As a rule that is the case,\" the Major said, \"but the present is an\nexceptional one. At the death of the late marquis, the heir to the\ntitle was missing. I may say that the late marquis only enjoyed the\ntitle for two years. The next of kin, a brother of his, had\ndisappeared, and up to the present no news has been obtained of him. Of\ncourse he has been advertised for, and so on, but without success. It\nis known that he married, but as he did so against the wish of his\nfather, he broke off all communication with his family; and it is\ngenerally supposed that he emigrated. Pending any news of him, the\ntitle is held in abeyance.\n\n\"He may have died. It is probable that he has done so, for he could\nhardly have escaped seeing the advertisements that were inserted in\nevery paper. Of course, if he has left children, they inherit the\ntitle.\n\n\"After a lapse of five years Mr. Hartley's father, who was the next\nheir, and who died five years ago, applied to be declared the inheritor\nof the title; but the peers, or judges, or someone decided that\ntwenty-one years must elapse before such an application could be even\nconsidered. The income has been accumulating ever since, so that at the\nend of that time, it is probable that Mr. Hartley will be allowed to\nassume the title.\n\n\"Will the estates go with the title, Hartley?\"\n\n\"Oh, I should say so, of course!\" the other drawled. \"The title would\nnot be of much use, without them.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear fellow!\" another said. \"Why, a fellow with your\npersonal advantage, and a title, would be able to command the American\nmarket, and to pick up an heiress with millions.\"\n\nThe general laugh that followed showed that Hartley was, by no means, a\npopular character in the regiment.\n\n\"The fellow is a consummate ass,\" the man on Gregory's left whispered.\n\"He only got into the service as a Queen's cadet. He could no more have\ngot in, by marks, than he could have flown. No one believes that he had\nanything the matter with him, at Cairo; but he preferred stopping\nbehind and coming up by himself, without any duties, to taking any\nshare in the work. He is always talking about his earldom--that is why\nthe Major mentioned it, so as to draw him out.\"\n\n\"But I suppose he is really heir to it?\"\n\n\"Yes, if no one else claims it. For aught that is known, there may be\nhalf a dozen children of the man that is missing, knocking about\nsomewhere in Canada or Australia. If so, they are safe to turn up,\nsooner or later. You see, as the man had an elder brother, he would not\nhave counted at all upon coming to the title. He may be in some\nout-of-the-way place, where even a colonial newspaper would never reach\nhim; but, sooner or later, he or some of his sons will be coming home,\nand will hear of the last earl's death, and then this fellow's nose\nwill be put out of joint.\n\n\"I am sure everyone in the regiment would be glad, for he is an\ninsufferable ass. I suppose, when he comes into the title, he will\neither cut the army altogether, or exchange into the Guards.\"\n\nThe party presently broke up, having finished the last bottle of wine\nthey had brought up. Gregory remained seated by the Major, discussing\nthe chances of the campaign, and the points where resistance might be\nexpected. The other officers stood talking, a short distance off.\nPresently Gregory caught the words:\n\n\"How is it that this young fellow calls himself Bimbashi, which, I\nbelieve, means major?\"\n\n\"He does not call himself that, although that is his rank. All the\nwhite officers in the Egyptian Army have that rank, though they may\nonly be lieutenants, in ours.\"\n\n\"I call it a monstrous thing,\" the drawling voice then said, \"that a\nyoung fellow like this, who seems to be an Egyptian by birth, should\nhave a higher rank than men here, who have served fifteen or twenty\nyears.\"\n\nThe Major got up, and walked across to the group.\n\n\"I will tell you why, Mr. Hartley,\" he said, in a loud voice. \"It is\nbecause, for the purpose of the war in this country, they know\ninfinitely more than the officers of our army. They talk the languages,\nthey know the men. These blacks will follow them anywhere, to the\ndeath. As for Mr. Hilliard, he has performed feats that any officer in\nthe army, whatever his rank, would be proud to have done. He went in\ndisguise into the Dervish camp at Metemmeh, before Hunter's advance\nbegan, and obtained invaluable information. He jumped overboard from a\ngunboat to save a drowning Dervish woman, although to do so involved\nalmost certain capture and death at the hands of the Dervishes. In\npoint of fact, his escape was a remarkable one, for he was tied to a\ntree in the first line of the Dervish defences at Atbara, and was only\nsaved by what was almost a miracle. He may not be heir to an earldom,\nMr. Hartley, but he would do more credit to the title than many I could\nname. I hear him well spoken of, by everyone, as an indefatigable\nworker, and as having performed the most valuable services. Captain\nKeppel, on whose gunboat he served for two or three months, spoke to me\nof him in the highest terms; and General Hunter has done the same.\n\n\"I fancy, sir, that it will be some years before you are likely to\ndistinguish yourself so highly. His father was an officer, who fell in\nbattle; and if he happened to be born in Egypt, as you sneeringly said\njust now, all I can say is that, in my opinion, had you been born in\nEgypt, you would not occupy the position which he now does.\"\n\nGregory had walked away when the Major rose, and he did not return to\nthe party. It was the first time that he had run across a bad specimen\nof the British officer, and his words had stung him. But, as he said to\nhimself, he need not mind them, as the fellow's own comrades regarded\nhim, as one of them said, as \"an insufferable ass.\" Still, he could not\nhelp wishing, to himself, that the missing heir might turn up in time\nto disappoint him.\n\nGeneral Hunter started next day, at noon, with two of his brigades and\nthe mounted troops; the other two brigades following, at nightfall. The\nprevious night had been one of the most unpleasant Gregory had ever\nspent. The long-expected rain had come at last. It began suddenly;\nthere was a flash of lightning, and then came a violent burst of wind,\nwhich tore down the tents and the flimsy shelters of the Egyptians and\nSoudanese. Before this had ceased, the rain poured down in a torrent;\nlightning, wind, and rain kept on till morning, and when the start was\nmade, everyone was soaked to the skin. The Egyptian baggage left at the\nsame time, in native craft.\n\nThat evening they arrived at the mouth of the Shabluka Cataract. Here\nit had been expected that the advance would be opposed, as strong forts\nhad been erected by the enemy, the river narrowed greatly, and\nprecipitous rocks rose on either side. Through these the course was\nwinding, and the current ran with great strength, the eddies and sharp\nbends making it extremely difficult for the gunboats to keep their\ncourse. Indeed, it would have been impossible for them to get up, had\nthe forts been manned; as they would have had to pass within two\nhundred yards of the guns. But although the forts could hardly have\nbeen attacked by the gunboats, they were commanded by a lofty hill\nbehind them; and the scouts had discovered, some weeks before, that the\nDervishes had retired from the position, and that the passage would be\nunopposed.\n\nMaxwell's and Colville's brigades started at four that afternoon, and\nthe next day the whole division was established at El Hejir, above the\ncataracts.\n\nLyttleton's brigade started, at five o'clock A.M. on the 25th, the\ngunboats and other steamers moving parallel with them along the river.\nAt five in the afternoon the first brigade followed and, two days\nafterwards, the camp was entirely evacuated, and the whole of the\nstores well on their way towards El Hejir. On the previous day, two\nregiments of Wortley's column of friendly natives also marched south.\nThe Sirdar and headquarters, after having seen everything off, went up\nin a gunboat, starting at nine in the morning.\n\nAs usual, the Soudanese troops had been accompanied by a considerable\nnumber of their wives, who were heavily laden with their little\nhousehold goods, and in many cases babies. They trudged patiently along\nin the rear of the columns, and formed an encampment of their own, half\na mile away from the men's, generally selecting a piece of ground\nsurrounded by thick bush, into which they could escape, should Dervish\nraiders come down upon them.\n\nThe stores arrived in due course. One of the gunboats, however, was\nmissing--the Zafir, with three gyasses in tow, having suddenly sunk,\nten miles north of Shendy, owing to being so deeply loaded that the\nwater got into the hold. Those on board had just time to scramble into\nthe boats, or swim to shore. No lives were lost, though there were many\nnarrow escapes. Among these were Commander Keppel and Prince Christian\nVictor, who were on board. Fortunately, another steamer soon came along\nand took the gyasses, with the ship-wrecked officers and crew on board,\nand towed them up to El Hejir.\n\nIt had been intended to stay here some little time, but the Nile\ncontinued to rise to an altogether exceptional height, and part of the\ncamp was flooded. At five o'clock, therefore, the Egyptian brigades\nstarted, with the guns on their right and the steamers covering their\nleft, while the cavalry and camel corps were spread widely out, in\nadvance to give notice of any approaching Dervish force. As usual the\nsoldiers' wives turned out, and as the battalions marched past, shouted\nencouragement to their husbands; calling upon them to behave like men,\nand not to turn back in battle. The presence of the women had an\nexcellent effect on the soldiers, and in addition to their assistance\nin carrying their effects, they cooked their rations, and looked after\nthem generally. The Sirdar, therefore, did not discourage their\npresence in the field, and even supplied them with rations, when it was\nimpossible for them to obtain them elsewhere.\n\nIn the afternoon the two white brigades also moved forward. At nine\no'clock they arrived at their camping ground, and the whole army was\nagain collected together. Next morning the four squadrons of Egyptian\nhorse, with a portion of the cavalry, went forward to reconnoitre, and\none of the gunboats proceeded a few miles up the river. Neither saw\nanything of the enemy.\n\nThere had been heavy rain during the night. This had ceased at\ndaybreak, and a strong wind speedily dried the sands, raising such\nclouds of dust that it was difficult to see above a few yards. The\nstorm had also the effect of hindering the flotilla.\n\nOn the other side of the river, Stuart-Wortley's friendlies had a sharp\nbrush with some Dervishes, whom they had come upon raiding a village,\nwhose inhabitants had not obeyed the Khalifa's orders to move into\nOmdurman.\n\nAs the rainstorms continued, it was decided, by a council of war, that\nthe health of the troops would suffer by a longer stay. On the 29th,\ntherefore, the army set out in order of battle, ready to encounter the\nKhalifa's attack, but arrived without molestation at Um Teref, a short\ndistance from Kerreri, where it was expected the enemy would give\nbattle.\n\nThe camp was smaller than those hitherto made, and was protected by a\nstrong zareba. The sentries were doubled, and patrols thrown out. Heavy\nrain set in after sunset, and almost a deluge poured down. The tents\nhad been left behind, and as the little blanket shelters were soon\nsoaked through, their occupants were speedily wet to the skin.\n\nIt was still raining when, at half-past five, the force again started.\nAs before, the army was marching in fighting order. The day was cool\nand cloudy, and at one o'clock they halted at a village called Merreh,\nor Seg. The cavalry had come into touch with the Dervish patrols, but\nthe latter, although numerous, avoided combat.\n\nIn one of the deserted villages was found one of Wingate's spies, in\nDervish attire. He had left Omdurman thirty hours before, and brought\nthe news that the Khalifa intended to attack at Kerreri. This place had\nbeen chosen because there was current an old prophecy, by a Persian\nsheik, to the effect that English soldiers would one day fight at\nKerreri, and be destroyed there. It had, therefore, become an almost\nholy place to the Mahdists, and was called the death place of all the\ninfidels; and, once a year, the Khalifa and his followers made a\npilgrimage to it.\n\nA few shots were fired during the night, and fires blazed on the hills\nto notify, to Omdurman, our precise position. The troops started again\nsoon after daylight, facing now to the right and marching westward, to\nleave the bush and broken ground, and get out in the open desert,\nstretching away to Omdurman. The cavalry were widely spread out, and\nthe Lancers ascended to the top of the hill of El Teb, from which a\nview of the Dervish camp was obtained.\n\nIt lay some ten miles due south. The Dervishes were disposed in three\nlong lines, stretching from within two thousand yards of the Nile out\ninto the desert, being careful to get, as they believed, beyond the\nrange of the four gunboats that steamed quietly up.\n\nAfter a short march the force halted near the river, two miles north of\nKerreri. The place was convenient for camping, but the banks of the\nriver were steep, and there was much difficulty in watering the horses\nand transport animals.\n\n\"We are in for another bad night,\" one of the General's staff said to\nGregory, as the evening approached.\n\n\"It looks like it. Clouds are banking up fast. If the rain would but\ncome in the daytime, instead of at night, one would not object to it\nmuch. It would lay the dust and cool the air. Besides, on the march we\nhave other things to think of; and though, of course, we should be\ndrenched to the skin, we should not mind it. But it is very unpleasant\nlying in a pool of water, with streams running in at one's neck.\"\n\n\"As to one's blanket, it is like a sponge, five minutes after the rain\nbegins,\" the officer said.\n\n\"I am better off in that respect,\" Gregory remarked; \"for, when I left\nmy little tent behind, I kept a waterproof sheet instead of my second\nblanket. I had intended to use it tent fashion, but it was blown down\nin a minute, after the first storm burst. Now I stand up, wrap my\nblanket tightly round me, while my boy does the same with the\nwaterproof sheet; and I keep moderately dry, except that the water will\ntrickle in at the end, near my neck. But, on the other hand, the\nwrapping keeps me so hot that I might almost as well lie uncovered in\nthe rain.\"\n\nThe staff had intended taking a few tents with them, but these were\npractically of no use at all, as all canvas had to be lowered by the\ntime that \"lights out\" sounded, and after that hour no loud talking was\npermitted in the camp. This might have been a privation, had the\nweather been fine, but even the most joyous spirit had little desire\nfor conversation, when the rain was falling in bucketfuls over him.\n\nThe officers of the white division lay down by their men, in the\nposition they would occupy if an attack by the enemy took place. The\nofficers of the Egyptian regiments lay together, just in rear of their\nmen. As soon as the \"last post\" sounded, absolute silence reigned. The\nsentries, placed a very short distance out, kept their senses of sight\nand hearing on the alert; and with eye and ear strove to detect the\napproach of a lurking foe. Jaalin scouts were stationed outside the\nzareba, so as to give an early warning of the approach of the enemy;\nbut no reliance could be placed upon them; for, altogether without\ndiscipline, they would probably creep under bushes, and endeavour to\nfind some shelter from the pitiless downpour.\n\nHad the Khalifa known his business, he would have taken advantage of\nthe tempestuous night, and launched his warriors at the camp. Confident\nas the officers of the expedition were, in the ability of their men to\nrepulse any assault that might be made in the daylight, it was felt\nthat such an attack would cause terrible loss, and possibly grave\ndisaster, if delivered at night. The enemy might not be discovered\nuntil within a few yards of the camp. The swish of the rain, and the\nalmost incessant crash of thunder, would deaden the sound of their\napproach; and, long before the troops could leap to their feet and\nprepare to receive them calmly, the Dervishes would be upon them. As\nthe latter were enormously stronger in numbers, the advantage of\nsuperior weapons would be lost in a hand-to-hand fight, and in the\ninevitable confusion, as the troops in reserve would be unable to open\nfire, while ignorant of the precise position of friends and foes.\n\nThe Khalifa, however, was relying upon prophecy. It was at Kerreri that\nthe infidel army was to be utterly destroyed, and he may have thought\nthat it would be tempting fate, were he to precipitate an action before\nthe invaders reached the spot where their doom had been pronounced.\n\nEven more miserable than night was the hour before dawn. Lying still,\ndrenched to the skin as they were, Nature prevailed, and the men\nobtained some sleep; but when they rose to their feet, and threw off\nthe sodden blankets, they felt the full misery of eight hours'\ndrenching. They were cold now, as well as wet, and as they endeavoured\nto squeeze the water from their clothes, and to restore circulation by\nswinging their arms, but few words were spoken; and the rising of the\nsun, which was regarded as a terrible infliction during the day, was\neagerly looked for. No sooner did it appear above the horizon than the\nspirits of the men rose rapidly, and they laughed, joked, and made\nlight of the inconveniences of the situation.\n\nAn hour later, their clothes were nearly dry. By that time they were\nall well on their way, the brigades, as before, marching in\nechelon--Wauchope's brigade on the left, Lyttleton's farther to the\nright but more to the rear, the three Egyptian brigades farther out on\nthe plain, the 21st Lancers scouting the ground in front of the British\ndivision, and the native cavalry and camel corps out beyond the right\nof the Egyptians.\n\nAll expected that, at least, they should have a skirmish before they\nreached Kerreri, where they were to encamp; but, as they advanced, it\nwas found that the Dervishes had fallen back from that line, and had\njoined the Khalifa's main force near Omdurman.\n\nBy ten in the morning the army had arrived at its camping place, which\nwas in the southern part of the ground occupied by the straggling\nvillage. As usual, both extremities of the line rested on the Nile,\nforming a semicircle, in which the baggage animals and stores were\nplaced, in charge of Collinson's brigade. The gunboats took up their\nposition, to cover the ground over which an enemy must approach to the\nattack.\n\nWhile the infantry were settling down, the cavalry and camel corps went\nout scouting. Signallers soon mounted a rugged hill, named Surgham, and\nfrom here a fine view was obtained of Omdurman, and the Khalifa's army.\nOmdurman was six miles away, covering a wide tract of ground, with but\nfew buildings rising above the general level, the one conspicuous\nobject being the great tomb of the Mahdi, with its white dome.\n\nIn the outskirts of the town were the white tents of the Dervish army.\nFor the present these were unoccupied, the whole force being drawn up,\nin regular line, out on the plain; about halfway between the town and\nSurgham Hill. It was formed in five divisions, each of which was bright\nwith banners of all colours, sizes, and shapes. The Khalifa's own\ndivision was in the centre, where his great black banner, waving from a\nlofty flagstaff, could be plainly made out.\n\nThe Lancers, Egyptian cavalry, and camel corps continued to advance,\ncapturing several parties of footmen, principally Jaalins, who probably\nlagged purposely behind the retiring Dervishes, in order to be taken.\nAt times the cavalry attempted to charge the Dervish horsemen, when\nthese approached, but in no case did the latter await the attack.\n\nPresently, above the occasional musketry fire, came the boom of a heavy\ngun. There was a thrill of excitement in the camp. The gunboats had\narrived opposite Omdurman, and had opened fire upon the Dervish\nriverside forts. These were strongly constructed; but, as in the forts\nat Metemmeh and Shabluka, the embrasures were so faultily constructed\nthat the guns could only be brought to bear upon the portion of the\nriver directly facing them, and the four gunboats passed them without\nreceiving any material damage, and were so able to maintain the\nbombardment without receiving any fire in return. At the same time,\nthey landed the forty-pounder guns on an island but a short distance\nfrom the town, and thence opened fire with lyddite shells upon it. The\nhowitzers were trained upon the Mahdi's tomb, and soon great holes were\nknocked in the dome.\n\nIt could be seen, from the top of the hill, that this caused great\nexcitement in the Dervish lines, and a number of their horsemen rode\nout against the Lancers, and drove in their advance scouts; but, on the\nmain body of the regiment moving forward, they fell back to their line;\nand almost immediately a heavy body of infantry moved out, their\nintention evidently being to surround and cut off the regiment, while\nat the same time a general advance took place. The Colonel of the\nLancers dismounted a portion of his men, and these checked the advance\nof the enemy, until the rest fell back.\n\nThe news of the advance was signalled to General Kitchener, and the\nwhole force at once took their position, in fighting order. Believing\nthat a general attack on the camp would now be made, the cavalry fell\nback on either flank, so as to clear the way for the fire of the\nartillery and infantry.\n\nThe Dervishes had a good view of our camp from the top of Surgham, but\nthe Khalifa apparently considered that it was too late in the day for a\ngeneral attack, and drew off his men to their former position, and the\nrest of the afternoon and evening passed quietly. As the men ate their\nmeal, of tinned meat and biscuit, they were in higher spirits than they\nhad been since the advance began. Hitherto, they had been in constant\napprehension lest the Dervishes should shun a battle, and would retire\nacross the desert to El Obeid, or elsewhere; and that they would have\nto perform interminable desert marches, only to find, on arriving at\nthe goal, that the enemy had again moved off. The events of the day,\nhowever, seemed to show that this fear was groundless, and that the\nKhalifa had determined to fight a decisive battle for the defence of\nhis capital.\n\nThe British soldier is ready to support any fatigue, and any hardship,\nwith a prospect of a fight at the end; and, during the advance, he is\nalways haunted by the fear that the enemy will retire, or give in on\nhis approach. This fear was stronger than usual on this expedition, for\nthere was no question as to the greatly superior mobility of the\nDervishes; and it was evident that, if they chose to avoid fighting,\nthey had it in their power to do so.\n\n\n\nChapter 14: Omdurman.\n\n\nThe night passed quietly, except that shots were occasionally fired by\nDervishes who crept up within range; and that, once, a mounted man, who\nhad apparently lost his way, rode fearlessly into camp; and then,\nfinding himself close to the troops, turned his horse and galloped off\nagain. No shot followed him, as the orders were strict that the camp\nwas not to be alarmed, unless in the case of a serious attack.\n\nAt half past three the bugle sounded, and the troops were soon astir.\nThe animals were watered and fed, and the men had a breakfast of cocoa\nor tea, with biscuits and tinned meat. At half past four Colonel\nBroadwood, commanding the Egyptian cavalry, sent out a squadron to the\nhills on the west, and another to Surgham Hill.\n\nThe latter arrived at their destination at two minutes past five, when\ndaylight had just broken. The officer in command saw at once that the\nDervish army had been reinforced in the night, and were marching to\nattack us. News was at once sent back to the camp, where all was in\nreadiness for an advance.\n\nNo news could have been more welcome. It was one thing to attack the\nDervishes in their chosen position, and to carry the narrow streets of\nOmdurman at the point of the bayonet--the Dervishes had shown, at Abu\nHamed, how desperately they could fight under such circumstances--and\nanother to meet them while attacking our position, in the open. This\nwas protected, along the line occupied by the white troops, by a hedge;\nwhile the three Egyptian brigades had constructed shelter trenches.\nThese afforded a vastly better defence against a foe advancing by\ndaylight, although they would not be so effective in checking a sudden\nand determined rush, in the darkness.\n\nPreparations were at once made to oppose the enemy. The Sirdar and his\nstaff were already mounting, when the news arrived. The horses were now\ntaken to the rear, the reserve ammunition boxes lifted from the mules'\nbacks, and the animals led to a sheltered position, behind some huts.\n\nThe guns were wheeled up into positions between the infantry brigades.\nThe troops were disposed in line, two deep; two companies of each\nbattalion, with the stretchers and bearers, taking post at a short\ndistance farther back, to reinforce the front line if hardly pressed,\nand to supply it from the reserve store of ammunition.\n\nAlready the gunboats had recommenced the bombardment of Omdurman, and\nthe mosque of the Mahdi, but as soon as news came that the Dervishes\nwere advancing to the attack, they were signalled to return to cover\nthe flank of the zareba. On their arrival, they took up a position\nwhence they could shell the line by which the Dervishes were advancing,\nand which would bring them apparently five or six hundred yards west of\nSurgham Hill.\n\nThe Lancers at once started forward to cover the left flank of the\nposition. In a few minutes they reached Surgham Hill, and joined the\nEgyptian squadron there.\n\nThe sight from the crest of Surgham Hill was grand. The enemy's front\nextended over three miles. The lines were deep and compact, and the\nbanners floated above them. They were advancing steadily and in good\norder, and their battle cries rose and fell in measured cadence. Their\nnumbers were variously estimated at from fifty to seventy thousand--a\nsuperb force, consisting of men as brave as any in the world, and\nanimated by religious fanaticism, and an intense hatred of those they\nwere marching to assail.\n\nIn the centre were the Khalifa's own corps, twenty thousand strong. On\ntheir right was the banner of Yacoub, his brother, and beyond, two\ndivisions led by well-known emirs; while on his left was the division\nled by his son, Osman, known as Sheik Ed Din, the nominal\ncommander-in-chief of the whole force.\n\nThe 21st Lancers, out in skirmishing order, were speedily driven back\nby the Dervishes, and retired into the zareba. When the latter came\nnear enough to see the small British force, a shout of exultation rose\nfrom their ranks, for they felt certain now of surrounding and\nannihilating the infidels, according to the prophecy.\n\nOn our side the satisfaction was no less marked. The front line moved\nforward to the thorny hedge, and prepared to open fire above it. The\nblack troops uttered a joyful shout of defiance, as they took their\nplaces in their trenches.\n\nWhen the enemy were two thousand eight hundred yards away, the three\nbatteries on the left of the zareba opened fire; and two batteries on\nthe right, and a number of Maxims, joined in pouring shell and bullets\ninto the thickest of the Dervish mass round the Khalifa's banner. The\neffect was terrible. For a moment the Dervish lines halted, astonished\nat the storm to which they were exposed. But it was only for a moment.\nThe wide gaps were filled up, and at a quicker pace than before, the\ngreat line swept on; the banner bearers and Baggara horsemen pushing\nforward to the front, to encourage the infantry.\n\nSeeing how persistently they were coming on, the Sirdar ordered the men\nof Lyttleton's brigade to open fire at long range. The Grenadiers were\nthe first to begin, firing volleys in sections. The other regiments of\nthe brigade were soon hard at it, but neither they nor the Maxims\nappeared to be doing serious execution, while the terrible effect of\nthe shell fire could really be seen. But, although great numbers of the\nenemy were killed or wounded by the bursting shells, there was no halt\nin the forward movement.\n\nSuddenly, over the crest and sides of the Surgham Hill, the division of\nthe Dervish right, reinforced by a portion of Yacoub's division,\nappeared; and over fifteen thousand men came streaming down the hill,\nwaving banners and shouting their war cries. They were led by their\nemirs, on horseback; but the infantry kept pace with these,\noccasionally discharging their rifles at random.\n\nThe guns of the three batteries, and one of the Maxims, were swung\nround and opened upon them. They were less than a mile away, and the\nwhole of Gatacre's division opened a terrific fire. Still the Dervishes\nheld on, leaving the ground they passed over white with fallen men.\nFrom seventeen hundred yards the sights had to be lowered rapidly, but\nat a thousand yards they held their foe. No man could cross the ground\nswept by the hail of balls. So rapid and sustained was the fire, that\nmen had to retire to refill their pouches from the reserve ammunition,\nand the rifles were so heated that they could no longer be held. In\nsome cases the men changed their weapons for those of the companies in\nreserve, in others these companies closed up and took the places of the\nfront line. Not for a moment was there any cessation in the fire.\n\nUnable to do more, Yacoub's men moved towards the front and joined the\nmain body, whose advance had been checked by the fire of Maxwell's\nEgyptian brigade. A few rounds had been fired by the three cannon that\nthe Khalifa had brought out with him, but they all fell short.\n\nOn our side the casualties had been few. In their desperate attempt to\nget at close quarters, the Dervish riflemen had not stopped to reload\nthe weapons they had discharged, and there was practically no return to\nthe awful fire to which they had been exposed.\n\nBut while Yacoub's force had been terribly punished, and the main body,\nbrought to a standstill at a distance of fourteen hundred yards, had\nsuffered almost as heavily, the battle had not gone so well to the\nright of our position, towards which the Khalifa was now moving.\nBroadwood's horse, and the camel corps, had been driven off the hill\nthey occupied; and so fierce was the attack that three of the guns of\nthe horse battery had to be left behind. The camel corps were ordered\nto retire rapidly, and make for shelter to the right rear of the camp.\nThe force made two or three stands, and the Egyptian cavalry more than\nonce charged the pursuing horsemen. The gunboats opened fire, and\ncovered the final retirement of the camel corps, which had lost eighty\nmen.\n\nThe cavalry did not retire to the zareba, but continued to fall back,\noccasionally turning and facing the enemy, until they were five miles\naway; when the Dervishes gave up the pursuit, and sat down to rest\nafter their tremendous exertions. Although forced to retire, the\ncavalry had done good service, for they had drawn off a great body of\nthe enemy at a critical moment, and these were unable to return and\ntake part in the battle still raging.\n\nAt length, the Khalifa moved off with all his force behind the western\nhills, and for a short time there was a lull in the battle. Many of the\nwounded tribesmen crawled up to within seven or eight hundred yards of\nthe zareba, and there opened fire. Their aim was good, and men began to\ndrop fast, in spite of the volleys fired to clear off the troublesome\nfoe. But their fire was soon disregarded for, from the ravines in the\nrange of low hills, behind which the Khalifa's force had disappeared, a\nmass of men burst out at a hard run. From their shelter behind Surgham\nHill, a portion of the force who were there also swept down to join the\nKhalifa, while Yacoub advanced from the southwest, and another body\nfrom the west.\n\nInstantly the infantry and artillery fire broke out again. On the\nprevious day, the distance had been measured and marked on several\nconspicuous objects; and the storm of shells tore the ranks of the\nenemy, and the rifles swept them with a rain of bullets. But, in face\nof all this, the Dervishes continued to advance at a run, their numbers\nthinning every minute.\n\nTwo or three hundred horsemen, with their emirs, dashed at the zareba\nat full gallop. Shrapnel, Maxim and rifle bullets swept their ranks,\nbut nearer and nearer they came, with lessening numbers every yard,\nuntil the last of them fell within about two hundred yards of Maxwell's\nline. Animated by the example, the infantry rushed forward. The black\nflag was planted within nine hundred yards of Maxwell's left; but, in\naddition to the Egyptian fire, the crossfire of the British divisions\npoured upon those around it.\n\nThe main body began to waver, but the Khalifa and his emirs did their\nbest to encourage and rally them. The flag was riddled with balls, and\nthe men who held it were shot down; but others seized the post of\nhonour, until a pile of bodies accumulated round it.\n\nAt last, but one man remained standing there. For a minute he stood\nquietly immovable, then fell forward dead. Then the Dervishes lost\nheart, and began to fall back in ones and twos, then in dozens, until\nthe last had disappeared behind the hills.\n\nThe troops then turned their attention to the men who, lying in\nshelter, were still maintaining their fire. There were fully a thousand\nof these, and the greater portion of our casualties took place from\ntheir fire, while the troops were occupied in repelling the main\nattack. It was not long, however, before bullets and shell proved too\nmuch for them; and those who survived crawled away, to join their\nkinsmen behind the hills.\n\nIt was eight o'clock now, and the victory had apparently been won. Some\nten thousand of the Khalifa's best troops had been killed or wounded.\nIn the British division, one officer and one man had been killed, and\nthree officers and sixty-five men wounded. The latter were at once\nplaced on board the hospital barges. Fresh ammunition was served out\nand, half an hour after the last shot was fired, the army prepared to\nmarch on Omdurman.\n\nIt was most important that they should arrive at the town before Ed\nDin's Dervishes should reach it; for unless they could do so, the loss\nthat would be incurred in capturing it would be vastly greater than\nthat which had been suffered in the battle. At nine o'clock the start\nwas made. The troops advanced in brigades. Lyttleton led on the left,\nWauchope was on his right, Maxwell somewhat in the rear, while still\nmore to the right came Lewis, and farther out on the plain Macdonald.\nThey formed roughly half a semicircle. Lyttleton, followed by Wauchope,\nwas to march between the river and Surgham Hill. Maxwell was to cross\nover the hill, while Lewis and Macdonald were to keep farther out to\nthe right. Collinson's Egyptian brigade was to guard the stores and\nmaterials left behind.\n\nThe 21st Lancers scouted ahead of the British brigades, to discover if\nany foe were lurking behind Surgham Hill. When about half a mile south\nof the hill, they saw a small party of Dervish cavalry and some\ninfantry, who were hiding in what looked like a shallow water course.\nThe four squadrons rode forward at a gallop. A sharp musketry fire\nopened upon them, but without hesitation they dashed headlong at the\nDervishes, when they found that, instead of a hundred and fifty foemen\nas they had supposed, some fifteen hundred Dervishes were lying\nconcealed in the water course.\n\nIt was too late to draw rein, and with a cheer the cavalry rode down\ninto the midst of the foe. There was a wild, fierce fight, lance\nagainst spear, sabre against sword, the butt-end of a rifle or the\ndeadly knife. Some cut their way through unscathed. Others were\nsurrounded and cut off. Splendid feats of heroism were performed. Many\nof those who got over returned to rescue officers or comrades, until at\nlast all the survivors climbed the bank.\n\nThe brunt of the fighting fell upon the two central squadrons. Not only\nwere the enemy thickest where they charged, but the opposite bank of\nthe deep nullah was composed of rough boulders, almost impassable by\nhorses. These squadrons lost sixteen killed and nineteen wounded.\nAltogether, twenty-two officers and men were killed, and fifty wounded;\nand there were one hundred and nineteen casualties among the horses.\n\nOnce across, the survivors gathered at a point where their fire\ncommanded the water course; and, dismounting, speedily drove the\nDervishes from it. On examining it afterwards, it was found that sixty\ndead Dervishes lay where the central squadrons had cut their way\nthrough.\n\nThe charge, in its daring and heroism, resembled that of the 23rd Light\nDragoons at Talavera. The fall into the ravine, on that occasion, was\nmuch deeper than that into which the Lancers dashed; but it was not\noccupied by a desperate force, and although many were injured by the\nfall, it was in their subsequent charge, against a whole French\ndivision, that they were almost annihilated.\n\nBoth incidents were, like the Balaclava charge, magnificent; but they\nwere not war. A desperate charge, to cover the retreat of a defeated\narmy, is legitimate and worthy of all praise, even if the gallant men\nwho make it are annihilated; but this was not the case at Talavera, nor\nat Omdurman. It was a brilliant but a costly mistake. The bravery shown\nwas superb, and the manner in which officers and men rode back into the\nstruggling mass, to rescue comrades, beyond all praise; but the charge\nshould never have been made, and the lives were uselessly sacrificed.\n\nAs yet, all was quiet at other points. Bodies of the enemy could be\nseen, making their way towards Omdurman. The battery opposite the town\nhad, from early morning, been keeping up a fire from its heavy guns\nupon it; but, save for the occasional shot of a lurking Dervish, all\nwas quiet elsewhere.\n\nWhile the cavalry charge was in progress, Gregory had moved along the\nline of the Egyptian brigades with General Hunter. Suddenly, from\nbehind the hills where the Khalifa had fallen back with his defeated\narmy, a column of fully twelve thousand men, led by the banner bearers\nand emirs, poured out again. A strong body sprang forward from another\nvalley, and made for the southeastern corner of Macdonald's brigade,\nwhich had moved almost due west from the position it had occupied in\nthe zareba; while the large force that had chased away the Egyptian\ncavalry were seen, returning to attack him in the rear.\n\nGeneral Hunter, who was riding between Macdonald's and Lewis's\nbrigades, which were now a good mile apart, exclaimed to Gregory, who\nhappened to be the nearest officer to him:\n\n\"Ride to Macdonald, and tell him to fall back, if possible!\"\n\nThen he turned, and galloped off to fetch up reinforcements. But the\nneed was already seen. The sudden uproar had attracted the attention of\nthe whole army, and the Sirdar instantly grasped the situation. The\nmoment was indeed critical. If Macdonald's brigade were overwhelmed, it\nmight have meant a general disaster; and the Sirdar at once sent orders\nto Wauchope's brigade, to go, at the double, to Macdonald's aid.\n\nFortunately Colonel Long, who commanded the artillery, had sent three\nbatteries with Macdonald's brigade. Collinson's brigade were far away\nnear the river, Lewis's were themselves threatened. It was evident, at\nonce, that no assistance could reach Macdonald in time. When Gregory\nreached him, the Dervishes were already approaching.\n\n\"It cannot be done,\" Macdonald said sternly, when Gregory delivered the\nmessage. \"We must fight!\"\n\nIndeed, to retreat would have meant destruction. The fire would have\nbeen ineffective, and the thirty thousand fierce foes would have been\namong them. There was nothing to do but to fight.\n\nMacdonald had marched out with the 11th Soudanese on his left, the 2nd\nEgyptians in the centre, and the 10th Soudanese on the right--all in\nline. Behind, in column, were the 9th Soudanese. The last were at once\nbrought up into line, to face the advancing enemy.\n\nFortunately, the Sheik Ed Din's force was still some little distance\naway. The batteries took their place in the openings between the\nbattalions, and the Maxim-Nordenfeldts were soon carrying death into\nthe advancing foe; while the Martini-Henry, with which the black and\nEgyptian troops were armed, mowed them down as by a scythe. The\nSoudanese battalions fired, as was their custom, individually, as fast\nas they could load; the Egyptian battalion by steady volleys.\n\nStill the enemy pressed on, until they were within two hundred yards of\nthe line. The emirs and other leaders, Baggara horse and many spearmen,\nstill held on; until they fell, a few feet only from the steady\ninfantry. The rear ranks of the Dervishes now began to fall back, and\nthe desperate charges of their leaders grew feebler; but Ed Din's\ndivision was now within a thousand yards. Macdonald, confident that the\nmain attack was broken, threw back the 9th Soudanese to face it, and\nwheeled a couple of his batteries to support them.\n\nThe already retreating Dervishes, encouraged by the arrival of Ed Din's\ndivision, returned to the attack. The 11th Soudanese swung round, to\naid the 9th in their struggle with Ed Din's troops. The charges of the\nDervishes were impetuous in the extreme. Regardless of the storm of\nshell and bullets they rushed on, and would have thrust themselves\nbetween the 9th and 11th, had not the 2nd Egyptians, wheeling at the\ndouble, thrown themselves into the gap.\n\nThe Dervishes pressed right up to them, and bayonet and spear\nfrequently crossed; but in a fight of this kind, discipline tells its\ntale. The blacks and Egyptians maintained their lines, steadily and\nfirmly; and against these, individual effort and courage, even of the\nhighest quality, were in vain.\n\nThe ground being now cleared, the gunboats opened with Maxim and cannon\nupon the rear of the Dervishes. The camel corps coming up, each man\ndismounted and added his fire to the turmoil; and, finally, three of\nWauchope's battalions arrived, and the Lincolns, doubling to the right,\nopened a terrible flank fire. The Dervishes broke and fled; not, as\nusual, sullenly and reluctantly, but at full speed, stooping low to\nescape the storm of bullets that pursued them.\n\nZaki had, throughout the day, kept close to Gregory, ready to hold his\nhorse when he dismounted; but, quick-footed as he was, he was left\nbehind when his master galloped across to Macdonald. He was up,\nhowever, in the course of a minute or two, and Gregory was glad to see\nhim, for the horse was kicking and plunging at the roar of the\napproaching enemy; and was almost maddened when to this was added the\ncrash of the batteries and musketry.\n\n\"Put my blanket round his head, Zaki,\" Gregory said, when the black ran\nup. \"Wrap it round so that he cannot see. Hold the bridle with one\nhand, and stroke him with the other, and keep on talking to him; he\nknows your voice. I don't want to dismount if I can help it, for with\nmy field glasses I see everything that is taking place, and I will tell\nyou how matters are going.\"\n\nFor the moment, it seemed as if the surging crowd streaming down must\ncarry all before it; but the steadiness with which the 9th Soudanese\nmoved into their place on the flank of the line, and the other\nregiments remained, as if on parade, soon reassured him. The terrible\nslaughter that was taking place in the ranks of the Dervishes soon\nshowed that, in that quarter at least, there was no fear of things\ngoing wrong; but he could not but look anxiously towards the great mass\nof men approaching from the north.\n\nIt was a matter of minutes. Would the present attack be repulsed in\ntime for the position to be changed, to meet the coming storm?\nOccasionally, Gregory looked back to see if reinforcements were coming.\nWauchope's brigade was visible over the tops of the scattered bushes.\nThe movements of the line showed that they were coming on at the\ndouble, but they were farther away than Ed Din's host, and the latter\nwere running like deer.\n\nHe felt a deep sense of relief when the 9th Soudanese were thrown back,\nperforming the movement as quietly and steadily as if on a drill\nground; and two batteries of artillery galloped across to their\nsupport. He had hardly expected such calm courage from the black\nbattalion. As to the bravery of the Soudanese troops, there was no\nquestion. They were of the same blood and race as their foes, and had\nshown how bravely they could fight in many a previous battle; but he\nwas not prepared for the steady way in which they worked, under such\nnovel circumstances; and although they, too, must have known that every\nmoment was of consequence, they moved without haste or hurry into the\nnew position, scarcely glancing at the torrent which was rushing on\ntowards them.\n\nNot less steadily and quietly did the 11th, considered to be the crack\nregiment of the brigade, swing round; and as calmly and firmly did the\nEgyptian battalion--composed of the peasants who, but twenty years\nbefore, had been considered among the most cowardly of people, a host\nof whom would have fled before a dozen of the dreaded Dervishes--march\ninto the gap between the two black regiments, and manfully hold their\nown.\n\nAnd yet, he could not but feel sorry for the valiant savages who, under\nso awful a fire, still pressed forward to certain death; their numbers\nwithering away at every step, until they dwindled to nothing, only to\nbe replaced by a fresh band, which darted forward to meet a similar\nfate; and yet, when he remembered the wholesale slaughter at Metemmeh,\nthe annihilation of countless villages and of their inhabitants, and,\nabove all, the absolute destruction of the army of Hicks Pasha, the\ncapture of Khartoum, the murder of Gordon, and the reduction to a state\nof slavery of all the peaceful tribes of the Soudan, he could not but\nfeel that the annihilation of these human tigers, and the wiping out of\ntheir false creed, was a necessity.\n\nWhen the last shot was fired, he dismounted and leant against his\nhorse, completely unnerved by the tremendous excitement that had been\ncompressed into the space of half an hour. Zaki was in ecstasy at the\nvictory. The ruthless massacre of so many of his tribesmen, the ruin of\nhis native village, and the murder of his relations was avenged, at\nlast. The reign of the Dervishes was over. Henceforth men could till\ntheir fields in peace. It was possible that, even yet, he might find\nhis mother and sisters still alive, in the city but a few miles away,\nliving in wretched existence as slaves of their captors.\n\nTears of joy streamed down his cheeks. He would have liked to help to\nrevenge the wrongs of his tribe, but his master needed him; and\nmoreover, there was no place for an untrained man in the ranks of the\nSoudanese regiments. They were doing their work better than he could.\nStill, it was the one bitter drop in his intense joy, that he had not\nbeen able to aid in the conflict.\n\nHe expressed this to Gregory.\n\n\"You have had your share in the fight, Zaki, just as I have had. I have\nnot fired a shot, but I have been in the battle, and run its risks, and\nso have you. Each of us has done his duty, and we can say, for the rest\nof our lives, that we have borne our share in the great battle that has\nsmashed up the power of the Khalifa, and the rule of the Dervishes.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 15: Khartoum.\n\n\nThere was no pause or rest for the troops who had been fighting, for so\nmany hours, in the heat of the African sun. It was all important to\noccupy Omdurman before the remnants of the Khalifa's army reached it;\nand as it was known that the Khalifa himself had returned there, it was\nhoped that he might be captured.\n\nIt was ten o'clock when Macdonald's brigade fired their last shot. In\nhalf an hour, the troops went forward again. The field presented a\nterrible appearance, being thickly dotted with dead, from the Surgham\nHill across the plain; and round, by the Kerreri Hills, to the spot\nwhere Macdonald's brigade had made their stand. There were\ncomparatively few wounded; for, wiry and hardy as they were, the\nwounded Dervishes, unless mortally hit, were for the most part able to\ncrawl or walk away; which they had done unmolested, for on each\noccasion after the bugle sounded cease firing, not a shot was fired at\nthem. But of dead there were fully ten thousand, scattered more or less\nthickly over the plain.\n\nFrom the position in which they were placed, the Egyptian troops, as\nthey marched south, passed the spot where the Khalifa's flag was still\nflying, as it had been left after its last defenders had fallen.\nSlatin, who was with the army, rode over the plain at the Sirdar's\nrequest, to ascertain if any of the Dervish leaders were among the\nfallen. He recognized many, but the Khalifa, his son Ed Din, and Osman\nDigna were not among them. The last-named had ever been chary of\nexposing himself, and had probably, as was his custom, viewed the\nbattle from a safe distance. But round the flag were the Khalifa's\nbrother, Yacoub, and ten or twelve of the leading emirs.\n\nOn our side, the loss had been comparatively light. Our total number of\ncasualties, including the wounded, was five hundred and twenty-four;\ntowards which Macdonald's brigade contributed one hundred and\ntwenty-eight. Marching steadily on, the force halted in the outlying\nsuburb of Omdurman, at midday, to obtain much needed food and water. As\nsoon as the cavalry had watered their horses, they were sent round to\nthe south of the town to cut off fugitives, and some of the gunboats\nmoved up to their support.\n\nDeputations of the townsfolk, Greeks and natives, came out and offered\nto surrender. They said that the Khalifa was in his house, and that he\nhad about a thousand of his bodyguard with him, but that they could not\noffer any successful resistance. The town was full of fugitive\nDervishes; many thousands of them were there--among them a great number\nof wounded.\n\nAt half past four the Sirdar, with his staff, entered the town;\naccompanied by Maxwell's Egyptian brigade. Only a few shots were fired.\nThe Dervish courage was broken. It was to the followers of the Prophet,\nand not to the infidels, that the plains of Kerreri had proved fatal.\nIt was their bodies, and not those of the white soldiers, that were\nstrewn there so thickly. The promise of the Khalifa had been falsified,\nthe tomb of the Mahdi was crumbling into ruins, the bravest of their\ntroops had fallen--what more was there to be done?\n\nAs Slatin Pasha rode in at the head of the troops, he was instantly\nrecognized by the people, among whom, for years, he had been a\nprisoner; and on his assurances that mercy would be shown to all, if\nthere was no resistance, numbers of the Dervishes came out from their\nhouses and huts, and laid down their arms.\n\nThe women flocked out into the streets, uttering their long and\nquavering cries of welcome. To them the entry of the British was a\nrelief from a living death, as almost all were captives taken in war,\nor in the Dervish raids upon quiet villages. They could scarce even yet\nbelieve that they were free--that their tyrants were slain or\nfugitives.\n\nIntense was the surprise and relief of the population, when they were\ntold that there would be no looting--no harm done to any by the\nconquerors; that all would be free, if they chose, to depart to their\nhomes, and to take their few belongings with them.\n\nThe scene in the town was awful--the stench overpowering! The Dervishes\nwere absolutely ignorant of all sanitary methods--pools of the foulest\nslush abounded, and thousands of dead animals, in all stages of\ndecomposition, lay about the streets. Among them were numerous dead\nbodies, principally of girls and women, who had been killed by their\nbrutal husbands or masters, to prevent them from falling into the hands\nof the British. There were also many dead Dervishes, and others\ndesperately wounded.\n\nStrangely enough, the latter did not seem to regard their victorious\nenemy with the hate that had been exhibited by many of the wounded in\nthe field; and some of them half raised themselves, and saluted the\nSirdar and his staff as they passed along.\n\nPresently, there was a commotion in the crowd. The wall of the great\ngranary had been breached, by some of the lyddite shells, and the grain\nhad poured out into the street. The natives near ran up to gather it;\nand, finding that they were not molested by the British, the news\nspread rapidly. The crowds in the streets melted away; and the\ninhabitants, for the most part half starved, made a mad rush to the\nspot, where in a short time many thousands of men, women, and children\nwere hard at work, gathering and carrying off the grain.\n\nIn the meantime the Sirdar, with a party of Maxwell's brigade, passed\nalong by the side of the great wall enclosing the buildings, and square\nmile of ground, in which were the Khalifa's house, the tomb of the\nMahdi, the arsenal, storehouses, and the homes of the principal emirs.\n\nAs soon as they had turned the corner of the wall, in view of the tomb\nand the Khalifa's house, a brisk fire was opened by the garrison.\nFortunately, the wall was not loopholed, and they had to get on the top\nof it, or on to the flat roofs of the houses, to fire. Maxwell's men\nsoon silenced them, and on the troops passing in through the breaches,\nand along the wall, most of the Dervishes at once surrendered.\n\nFor a time, further advance was barred by an inner wall, that still\nintervened between them and the Khalifa's house. After the gunboats'\nfire had cleared away a number of the Dervishes clustered outside the\nsouth wall, the Sirdar and his staff entered by a gateway, and moved\ntowards the Khalifa's house. This was searched by Slatin Pasha, and\nseveral officers and soldiers; but, to the general disappointment, it\nwas found that the Khalifa had escaped but a short time before,\ncarrying with him his treasure; his wives having been sent off, as soon\nas he returned from the field of battle.\n\nThe Mahdi's tomb was a ruin. A large portion of the dome had been\nknocked away, and the falling fragments had smashed the iron railings\nthat surrounded the tomb, itself.\n\nThere was nothing more to be done. The pursuit of the Khalifa, mounted,\nas he would be, on fresh horses, was out of the question. It was\nalready almost dark, and men and horses had been at work since before\ndaybreak. The town was in a very disturbed state--large numbers of the\nDervishes were still possessed of their arms, and the greater portion\nof the troops were withdrawn from the pestilential town. Next morning a\nlarger force was marched in, and the work of disarmament completed.\n\nThe cavalry went out and scouted the country, and brought in large\nnumbers of prisoners. The men belonging to the tribes that had\nrenounced Mahdism--Jaalin and others--were at once allowed to leave for\ntheir homes; and numbers of others, whose appearance was peaceful, and\nwho had at once given up their arms, were also released; but there were\nstill no fewer than eleven thousand prisoners, among them some of the\nKhalifa's emirs.\n\nMany of the townspeople had started, the previous evening, for the\nfield of battle; to bury the bodies of their friends who had fallen,\nand to bring in the wounded. Of the latter, after our own men had been\nattended to, fully nine thousand received aid and attention from the\nBritish doctors.\n\nOn the morning after the occupation, the work of purification began.\nGreat numbers of the unwounded prisoners, and of the townspeople, were\nset to work to clean the streets; and, in a couple of days, the wider\nthoroughfares and avenues had been thoroughly cleansed.\n\nHaving but little to do, Gregory went into the Khalifa's arsenal. This\nbuilding was full of war material of all kinds; including a perfectly\nappointed battery of Krupp guns, numbers of old cannon, modern\nmachine-guns, rifles and pistols; mixed up with musical instruments,\nsuits of chain armour, steel helmets, hundreds of battle flags, and\nthousands of native spears, swords, and shields. Besides these the\ncollection comprised ivory, percussion caps, lead, copper, and bronze,\nlooms, pianos, sewing machines, boilers, steam engines, agricultural\nimplements, ostrich feathers, wooden and iron bedsteads, paints, India\nrubber, leather water bottles, clothes, three state coaches, and an\nAmerican buggy. There were also a modern smithy, where gunpowder,\nshell, bullets, and cartridge cases were made and stored; and a\nwell-appointed engineers' shop and foundry, with several steam engines,\nturning lathes, and other tools. The machinery had been brought from\nGordon's arsenal at Khartoum, where the foreman had been employed; and\nthe workmen were, for the most part, Greeks.\n\nThe battle was fought on Friday, the 2nd of September. On Sunday a\nflotilla of boats, containing detachments from all the British and\nEgyptian regiments, and every officer who could be spared from duty,\nproceeded up the river to Khartoum. The ruined and deserted city looked\ndelightful, after the sand, dirt, and wretchedness of Omdurman. The\ngardens of the governor's house, and other principal buildings, had run\nwild; and the green foliage was restful indeed, to the eye, after the\nwaste of sand, rock, and scrub that had been traversed by the army on\nits way from Wady Halfa.\n\nThe vessels drew up opposite a grove of tall palms. Beyond them\nappeared what had been the government house. The upper story was gone,\nthe windows were filled up with bricks, and a large acacia stood in\nfront of the building.\n\nThe troops formed up before the palace, in three sides of a square--the\nEgyptians were to the left, looking from the river, and the British to\nthe right--the Sirdar, and the generals of the divisions and brigades,\nfacing the centre. Two flagstaffs had been raised on the upper story.\nThe Sirdar gave the signal, and the British and Egyptian flags were run\nup. As they flew out, one of the gunboats fired a salute, the Guards'\nband struck up \"God Save the Queen!\" and the band of the 11th Soudanese\nthen played the Khedive's hymn, while the Generals and all present\nstood in salute, with their hands to the peak of their helmets. The\nSirdar's call for three cheers for the Queen was enthusiastically\nresponded to, every helmet being raised. Similar cheers were then given\nfor the Khedive, the bands again struck up, and twenty-one guns were\nfired.\n\nAs the last gun echoed out, the Guards played the Dead March, in Saul;\nand the black band the march called Toll for the Brave, the latter in\nmemory of the Khedive's subjects, who had died with Gordon. Then minute\nguns were fired, and four chaplains--Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist,\nand Catholic--by turns read a psalm or a prayer. The pipers then wailed\na dirge, and finally the Soudanese bands played Gordon's favourite\nhymn, Abide with Me.\n\nAt the conclusion, General Hunter and the other officers shook hands\nwith the Sirdar, one by one. Kitchener himself was deeply moved, and\nwell he might be! Fourteen years of his life had been spent in\npreparing for, and carrying out, this campaign; and now the great task\nwas done. Gordon was avenged. Of the Dervish host, the remnant were\nscattered fugitives. The Mahdi's cause, the foulest and most\nbloodstained tyranny that had ever existed, transforming as it did a\nflourishing province into an almost uninhabited desert, was crushed\nforever; and it was his patient and unsparing labour, his wonderful\norganization, that had been the main factor in the work. No wonder that\neven the Iron Sirdar almost broke down, at such a moment.\n\nThe bugles sounded, and the troops broke up their formation; and, for\nhalf an hour, wandered through the empty chambers of the palace, and\nthe wild and beautiful garden. Another bugle call, and they streamed\ndown to the water's edge, took to the boats, and returned to Omdurman.\n\nThe long-delayed duty, which England owed to one of her noblest sons,\nhad been done. Gordon had had his burial. None knew where his bones\nreposed, but that mattered little. In the place where he was slain, all\nhonour had been done to him; and the British flag waved over the spot\nwhere he disappeared, forever, from the sight of his countrymen.\n\nOn Gregory's return, he found Zaki in a state of the highest\nexcitement.\n\n\"Why, what is the matter with you, Zaki?\"\n\n\"Oh, master, I have found my two sisters!\"\n\n\"That is good news, indeed. I am very glad to hear it, Zaki. How did\nyou find them?\"\n\n\"While you were away, Master, I had been walking through the town; and\nwhen I was passing near the outskirts, a woman came to a door, and\nlooked very hard at me. Then she suddenly drew aside the cloth from her\nface and cried, 'Surely it is Zaki!'\n\n\"Then I knew her--she was my elder sister. Then another woman came to\nthe door--it was my younger sister, and you can imagine my joy. Both\nhad been married to Baggaras, who had carried them off. Their husbands\nhad gone to the battle, and had not returned; and some neighbours who\nhad gone to the battlefield, next day, brought back news that they had\nfound both bodies; so one sister came to stay with the other. People\nhad told them that it was safe to go out, and that no one was injured\nwho did so; but they had a store of grain in the house, and they\ndecided to wait and see what happened.\n\n\"One of them, seeing me come along, and observing that I belonged to\nthe Jaalin, came out to ask me the news; and they were as delighted as\nI was, at our meeting.\"\n\n\"And your mother, do they know anything of her?\"\n\n\"She was killed, Master,\" Zaki said sorrowfully. \"I thought possibly it\nwould be so. The Dervishes did not carry off old women. They killed\nthem, and the little children. I had never hoped to see her again; but\nI did think, when we entered Omdurman, that my sisters might be here.\"\n\n\"What are they going to do?\"\n\n\"They will go down to Berber. I have told them that many of the people\nhere are going down, and that they will find no difficulty in joining a\nparty. They are sure to find people they know, at Berber, for most of\nthe Jaalin who have escaped have gone there, since we occupied the\nplace. I told them that I would give them what money I had; for, since\nI have been in my lord's service, I have had no occasion to spend aught\nthat he has paid me.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt, Zaki, that I can arrange for them to go down in one\nof the empty store boats. I believe that many of the captives who have\nbeen released will be sent down that way; and, of course, I shall be\nglad to give your sisters enough to keep them, for some time, at\nBerber.\"\n\n\"My lord is too good,\" Zaki said gratefully.\n\n\"Nonsense, Zaki! You saved my life, and I owe you a great deal. I will\ngo down, at once, to the river--that is, if your sisters are ready to\nstart tomorrow--and I have no doubt the transport officer will give me\nan order, for them, to go in one of the boats.\"\n\nAs he had expected, he had no difficulty in making arrangements.\nSeveral of the native boats, that had already landed their stores,\nwould leave on the following day; and Gregory obtained an order for the\npassage of the two women. He then drew some money from the paymaster\nand, on his return to headquarters, gave Zaki a hundred dollars for his\nsisters.\n\nThe black was overpowered with joy and, going off, returned with the\ntwo girls--for they were little more. Each took one of Gregory's hands,\nand pressed it to her forehead and heart, and murmured her thanks.\n\n\"Do not thank me,\" he said. \"It is but a small part of the debt that I\nowe your brother. I do not know whether he has told you that he saved\nmy life, at the risk of his own.\"\n\n\"I have been thinking, my lord,\" Zaki said, \"that it would be well for\nthem to go down in the boat as far as Dongola. Our village is not many\nmiles from that place, and many of our people fled there; and doubtless\nthey will return to their villages, and plant their fields, now that\nthey have no longer any fear of the Dervishes. At any rate, they are\ncertain to meet friends, at Dongola.\"\n\n\"Very well, I will get the order altered. There will be no difficulty\nabout that. I shall be very glad to know that you will have a home to\ngo to, when this war is quite over.\"\n\n\"I shall never go, as long as my lord will keep me,\" Zaki said,\nfervently.\n\n\"I certainly shall not part with you, Zaki, as long as I remain in this\ncountry, which will probably be for a long time.\"\n\nThe next day, Zaki aided in carrying his sisters' goods down to the\nriver bank, and saw them on board one of the native craft, which\ncarried also fifteen or twenty other fugitives.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Hilliard,\" General Hunter said, that morning, \"you can devote\nyourself to the object for which you came here. Unquestionably, there\nmust be many among the prisoners who fought at El Obeid. You may gather\nall particulars of the battle, from their lips.\n\n\"The greater portion of the white troops will march down the country,\nat once. Of course, I don't know what your plans may be; but unless you\nhave a very good reason to the contrary, I should certainly advise you\nto retain your position in the Egyptian army. A great deal of work will\nhave to be done, before matters are quite settled down; and then civil\nadministration of some sort will, of course, be formed, under which you\nwould certainly obtain a far better post than you could hope to get, at\nhome.\"\n\n\"I have quite made up my mind to do so, sir. Certainly, when I left\nCairo, I had no idea of remaining permanently in the service; but I\nhave been so exceptionally fortunate, owing largely to your kindness,\nthat I have been seriously thinking the matter over; and am quite\ndetermined that, if I can obtain an appointment, I will remain here. I\nhave no ties, whatever, either in Lower Egypt or in England; no way of\nearning my living there; and possibly, as I have begun so early, I may\nrest, in time, in what will no doubt become an important branch of the\nEgyptian administration.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear that you take that view. We all grumble at the\nSoudan, and yet there are few of us but would be sorry to leave it; and\nthere can be no doubt whatever that, under our administration, it will,\nin time, become a magnificently rich and fertile province.\"\n\nBeing relieved from other duty, at present, Gregory went to the great\nyard near the mosque, called the Praying Square, where the majority of\nthe Dervish prisoners were confined. Addressing a man of some\nfive-and-forty years, he asked him, in Arabic, whether many among the\nprisoners had fought against Hicks, at El Obeid.\n\nThe man hesitated.\n\n\"I am not asking on the part of the Sirdar,\" Gregory said; \"and you may\nbe sure that, if no punishment is inflicted against those who have\nfought against us now, there can be no thought of punishment, for a\nthing that happened so many years ago. My father was, I believe, one of\nthe English officers killed there; but as he spoke Arabic well, it is\njust possible he was not killed; but, like Slatin and Neufeld, was kept\nas a slave, in case he might be useful.\"\n\n\"There are many here who fought against Hicks,\" the native said. \"I\nmyself fought there, and nearly all the Baggara who are as old as I am\nwere there, also. I have never heard of a white man who escaped death.\nWhen we broke into the square, the English General and his officers\ncharged into the middle of us, and all fell. I was not close at the\ntime, but I saw their bodies, an hour afterwards.\"\n\n\"My father was not a fighting officer. He was the interpreter, and may\nnot have been near the others. When the attack by your people was made,\nI have heard that one of the Soudanese regiments held together, and\nmarched away, and that there was a white officer with them.\"\n\n\"That was so. Two days afterwards, we surrounded them. They fought\nhard; and at last, when we had lost many men, we offered that, if they\nwould surrender and become the Mahdi's men, they would be spared. Most\nof them did so, just as some of our tribesmen, taken by you at Atbara,\nhave now taken service with you.\"\n\n\"But the white officer--what became of him?\"\n\n\"I cannot say,\" the native said. \"I have no memory of him. He may have\nfallen before they surrendered--who can say? Certainly, I do not\nremember a white man being killed, after they did so. I will ask others\nwho were there, and tomorrow will tell you what they say.\"\n\nIt was a busy day, in Omdurman. The army that had made such efforts,\nand achieved so great a triumph, marched in military order, with bands\nplaying, through the town. The Sirdar had a double motive, in ordering\nthem to do so. In the first place, it was a legitimate triumph of the\ntroops, thus to march as conquerors through the town. In the second\nplace the sight would impress, not only the inhabitants, but the\nDervish prisoners, with a sense of the power of those who, henceforth,\nwould be their masters; and, undoubtedly, the show had the desired\neffect. The orderly ranks, as they swept along, the proud demeanour of\nthe men, their physique and equipment, created a profound impression\namong the natives. Half of them were their own kinsmen, many of whom\nhad fought for the Khalifa, and had now aided in defeating him. This\nwas what had been accomplished by drill and discipline, and the\ninfluence of white officers. The Soudanese were evidently well fed and\ncared for; not even the haughty Baggara held their heads so high.\n\nEspecially admired were the artillery, battery following battery, in\nperfect order. These were the guns that had carried death into the\nranks of the Dervishes, against whose fire even the fanatical bravery\nof the followers of the Khalifa was unable to stand. When the march\npast was concluded, there was scarce one of the prisoners who would not\ngladly have enlisted.\n\nOn the following day, Gregory again went to the Praying Square. The man\nhe had the morning before seen, at once came up to him.\n\n\"I have enquired of many who were at El Obeid, my lord,\" he said. \"All\nsay that there was no white man in the camp, when the black battalion\nsurrendered, though one had been seen while the fighting was going on.\nNor was the body of one found, where the fight had taken place on the\nprevious day. It was a matter of talk among the Dervishes, at the time;\nfor they had lain in a circle round the enemy, and were convinced that\nno one passed through their lines. Those who surrendered said that he\nhad taken the command, and had exposed himself to the hottest fire, and\nencouraged them; telling them that the more bravely they defended\nthemselves, the more likely they were to obtain favourable terms. The\nnight before, he had advised them to accept any offer the Dervishes\nmight make, but on the following morning he was missing, and none could\ngive any account of what had become of him. The same tale is told by\nall to whom I have spoken.\"\n\nThe story made a profound impression upon Gregory. It seemed possible\nthat the father, of whom he had no remembrance, might have been the\nsole white survivor of Hicks's army. True, there was nothing to prove\nthat he was the white man who had joined the black battalion that\nescaped the first day's massacre. There were other non-combatants:\nVizitelly, the artist of the Illustrated London News, and O'Donovan,\nthe correspondent of the Daily News. Either of these might also have\nbeen at any other portion of the square, when the attack commenced, and\nunable to join Hicks and his officers, in their final charge into the\nmidst of the enemy.\n\nStill, it was at least possible that his father was the man who had\nretired from the field, with the black battalion; and who had,\nafterwards, so strangely disappeared. If so, what had become of him,\nall these years? Had he made off in disguise, only to be murdered by\nwandering bands? Had he been concealed, for months, in the hut of a\nfriendly tribesman? What had he been doing, since? Had he been killed,\nin trying to make his way down? Had he been enslaved, and was he still\nlingering on, in a wretched existence?\n\nHe could hardly hope that he had fallen into friendly hands; for, had\nhe been alive, he would surely have managed, with his knowledge of the\ncountry, to make his way down; or to reach Khartoum, when it was still\nheld by the Egyptians.\n\nAt any rate, Gregory concluded that he might find out whether any\nEuropean had arrived there, during the siege. He went down to the\nriver, and took a native boat across to Khartoum. At the ceremony, on\nSunday, many natives watched the arrival of the flotilla; and some of\nthese might have been there, in Gordon's time. He had no great hopes of\nit, but there was just a chance.\n\nThe flags were still flying over the governor's house, when he landed,\nand a detachment of Egyptian troops was stationed there. A native\nofficer came down, when he landed.\n\n\"I have come across to question some of the natives,\" he said. \"I\nbelieve some are still living here.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Bimbashi! there are a good many, scattered about among the\nruins. They come in, bringing fruit and fish for sale. I think they\nmostly live down by the riverside.\"\n\nGregory kept on, till he came to the huts occupied by the fishermen,\nand men who cultivated small plots of ground. He found several who had\nlived at Khartoum, when it was captured; and who had escaped the\ngeneral massacre, by hiding till nightfall, and then making their way\nup the river, in boats. None of them could give him the information he\nsought, but one suggested that he was more likely to hear from the\nGreeks and Turks, who worked in the Khalifa's arsenal and foundries; as\nthey had been spared, for the services they would be able to render to\nthe Mahdi.\n\nReturning to Omdurman, he went to the machine shop. Here work had\nalready been resumed, as repairs were needed by several of the\ngunboats. He went up to the foreman, a man of some sixty years of age.\n\n\"You were engaged in the city during the siege, were you not?\" he said,\nin Arabic, with which he knew the foreman must be thoroughly\nacquainted.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I had been here ten years before that.\"\n\n\"I am very anxious to learn whether any white man, who had survived the\nbattle of El Obeid, ever reached this town before its capture.\"\n\nThe man thought for some time.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"a white man certainly came here, towards the end of\nthe siege. I know, because I happened to meet him, when I was going\nhome from work; and he asked me the way to the governor's. I should not\nhave known him to be a white man, for he had a native attire; and was\nas black, from exposure to the sun, as any of the Arabs. I gave him\ndirections, and did not ask him any questions; but it was said,\nafterwards, that he was one of Hicks's officers. Later, I heard that he\nwent down in the steamer with Colonel Stewart.\"\n\n\"You did not hear his name?\" Gregory asked, anxiously.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Did he talk Arabic well?\"\n\n\"Extremely well. Much better than I did, at the time.\"\n\n\"Do you remember how long he arrived before the steamer started?\"\n\n\"Not very long, sir, though I really cannot tell you how long it was.\"\n\n\"After you were cut off, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Certainly it was, but I cannot say how long.\"\n\n\"No one else, here, would know more about it than you do?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I should think not. But you can ask them.\"\n\nHe called up some of the other workmen. All knew that a white officer,\nof Hicks Pasha's army, was said to have returned. One of them\nremembered that he had come down once, with Gordon, to see about some\nrepairs required to the engines of a steamer; but he had never heard\nhis name, nor could he recall his personal appearance, except that he\nseemed to be a man about thirty. But he remembered once seeing him,\nagain, on board Stewart's steamer; as they had been working at her\nengines, just before she started.\n\nAfter thanking the foreman, Gregory returned to the hut, where he and\ntwo other officers of Hunter's staff had taken up their quarters. He\nwas profoundly depressed. This white man might well have been his\nfather; but if so, it was even more certain than before that he had\nfallen. He knew what had been the fate of Stewart's steamer, the\nremains of which he had seen at Hebbeh. The Colonel, and all with him,\nhad accepted the invitation of the treacherous sheik of that village,\nand had been massacred. He would at least go there, and endeavour to\nlearn, from some of the natives, the particulars of the fate of those\non board; and whether it was possible that any of the whites could have\nescaped.\n\nAfter sitting for some time, in thought, he went to General Hunter's\nquarters, and asked to see him. The General listened, sympathetically,\nto his story.\n\n\"I never, for a moment, thought that your father could have escaped,\"\nhe said; \"but from what you tell me, it is possible that he did so,\nonly to perish afterwards. But I can well understand how, having learnt\nso much, you should be anxious to hear more. Certainly, I will grant\nyour request for leave to go down to Hebbeh. As you know, that place\nwas taken and destroyed, by the river column under Earle; or rather\nunder Brackenbury, for Earle had been killed in the fight at Kirkeban.\nNumerous relics were found of the massacre, but the journal Stewart was\nknown to have kept was not among them. Had it been there it would, no\ndoubt, have mentioned the survivor of Hicks's army, who was coming down\nthe river with him.\n\n\"The place was deserted when Brackenbury arrived. It certainly was so,\nwhen we came up. Since then, some of the inhabitants have probably\nreturned; and may know of places where plunder was hidden away, on the\napproach of Brackenbury's column. No doubt the offer of a reward would\nlead to their production.\n\n\"You may not have to be absent long. The British regiments are to go\ndown at once, and several steamers will start tomorrow. I will give you\nan order to go with them. You will have no difficulty in getting back,\nfor the Sirdar has already decided that the railway is to be carried\non, at once, from Atbara to Khartoum; and has, I believe, telegraphed\nthis morning that material and stores are to be sent up, at once. Most\nof these will, no doubt, be brought on by rail; but grain, of which\nlarge quantities will be required, for the use of our troops and of the\npopulation of the town, will come on by water.\n\n\"But, no doubt, your quickest way back will be to ride to Abu Hamed,\nand take the train up to Atbara.\"\n\n\"I will be back as soon as I can, General. I am much obliged to you,\nfor letting me go.\"\n\n\"I will tell the Sirdar that I have given you leave, and why. It is not\nabsolutely necessary, but it is always well that one's name should be\nkept to the front.\"\n\nThe next day, Gregory saw the General again.\n\n\"I mentioned, to the Sirdar, that you wanted a fortnight's leave, and\ntold him why. He simply nodded, and said, 'Let him have a month, if he\nwants it.'\n\n\"He had other things to think of; for, this morning, a small Dervish\nsteamer came down the White Nile. They had the Khalifa's flag flying,\nand had not heard of what had taken place, till one of the gunboats ran\nalongside her. Of course she surrendered, at once.\n\n\"It is a curious story they told. They left Omdurman a month ago with\nthe Sapphire, which carried five hundred men. The object of the voyage\nwas to collect grain. When they reached the old station of Fashoda,\nthey had been fired upon by black troops, with some white men among\nthem, who had a strange flag flying. The firing was pretty accurate,\nfor they had forty men killed and wounded; and the emir in command had\ndisembarked, and encamped his troops from the Sapphire on the opposite\nbank, and had sent the small steamer back, to ask the Khalifa for\norders.\n\n\"The story seemed so strange, and improbable, that I went down with the\nSirdar to the boat, which had been brought alongside. There was no\ndoubt that it had been peppered with balls. Some of the General's staff\ncut one of the bullets out of the woodwork, and these fully confirmed\nthe story. They were not leaden balls, or bits of old iron, but conical\nnickel bullets. They could only have been fired from small-bore rifles,\nso there were certainly white men at Fashoda. Of course, no one can\nform any opinion as to who they are, or where they come from. They may\nbe Belgians from the Congo. They may--but that is most improbable--be\nan expeditionary party of Italians. But Italy is withdrawing, and not\npushing forward, so I think it is out of the question that they are\nconcerned in the matter.\n\n\"The question seems to lie between Belgians and French, unless an\nexpedition has been sent up from our possessions on the great lakes.\nThe Dervishes in the steamer can only say that the flag is not at all\nlike ours; but as their ignorance of colour is profound, they give all\nsorts of contradictory statements. Anyhow, it is a serious matter.\nCertainly, no foreign power has any right to send an expedition to the\nNile; and as certainly, if one of them did so, our government would not\nallow them to remain there; for, beyond all question, Fashoda is an\nEgyptian station, and within Egyptian territory; which is, at present,\nas much as to say that a foreign power, established there, would be\noccupying our country.\"\n\n\"It seems an extraordinary proceeding, sir.\"\n\n\"Very extraordinary. If it were not that it seems the thing has\nabsolutely been done, it would seem improbable that any foreign power\ncould take such an extraordinary, and unjustifiable, course. It is\nlucky for them, whoever they are, that we have smashed up the\nDervishes; for they would have made very short work of them, and the\nnation that sent them would probably never have known their fate.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 16: A Voice From The Dead.\n\n\nThat afternoon, Gregory heard that orders had been issued for five of\nthe gunboats to start up the river, the first thing in the morning;\nthat the Sirdar himself was going, and was to take up five hundred men\nof the 11th Soudanese. An order was also issued that all correspondents\nwere to leave, the next day, for Cairo. Gregory had met one of them,\nthat evening.\n\n\"So you are all off, I hear, Mr. Pearson?\"\n\n\"Yes; we did have a sort of option given us, but it was really no\nchoice at all. We might go down instantly, or we must stay till the\nlast of the white troops had gone down. That may be a very long time,\nas there is no saying what may come of this Fashoda business. Besides,\nthe Khalifa has fairly escaped; and if, out of the sixty thousand men\nwith him, some thirty thousand got off, they may yet rally round him:\nand, in another two or three months, he may be at the head of as large\na force as ever. I don't think, after the way the Egyptians fought the\nother day, there will be any need for white troops to back them. Still,\nit is likely that a battalion or two may be left. However, we had\npractically to choose between going at once, or waiting at least a\nmonth; and you may be sure that the censorship would be put on, with a\nround turn, and that we should not be allowed to say a word of the\nFashoda business, which would be the only thing worth telegraphing\nabout. So we have all voted for going.\n\n\"Of course, we understand that this pressure has been put upon us, on\naccount of this curious affair at Fashoda. Fortunately, none of us are\nsorry to be off. There is certain to be a pause, now, for some time;\nand one does not want to be kicking one's heels about, in this ghastly\ntown; and though it is rather sharp and peremptory work, I cannot say\nthat I think the Sirdar is wrong. Whoever these men may be, they must\ngo, that is certain; but of course it will be a somewhat delicate\nbusiness, and France--that is, if they are Frenchmen who are there--is\nsure to be immensely sore over the business; and it is certainly very\ndesirable that nothing should be written, from here, that could\nincrease that feeling. I have no doubt the Sirdar telegraphed home, for\ninstructions, as soon as he got the news of the affair; and I imagine\nthat his going up in the morning, with five gunboats, is proof that he\nhas already received instructions of some sort.\n\n\"I hope this force is not French. The feeling against us is\ntremendously strong, in France, and they certainly will not like\nbacking down; but they will have to do that or fight and, with all\ntheir big talk, I don't think they are ready to risk a war with us;\nespecially as, though their occupation of Fashoda would be an immense\nannoyance to us, it would be of no possible utility to them.\n\n\"By the way, we have all got to sell our horses. There is no\npossibility of taking them down, and it is a question of giving them\naway, rather than of selling; for, of course, the officers of the\nBritish regiments do not want to buy. I have a horse for which I gave\ntwenty-five pounds, at Cairo. You are welcome to him. You can give me a\ncouple of pounds, for the saddle and things.\"\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you, but it would be robbery.\"\n\n\"Not at all. If you won't take him, I shall have him shot, tonight. A\nhorse could not possibly pick up food here, and would die of starvation\nwithout a master; and it would be still more cruel to give him to a\nnative, for they are brutal horse masters.\"\n\n\"Well, in that case I shall be glad, indeed, to have him; and I am\nextremely obliged to you.\"\n\n\"That is right. If you will send your man round, I will hand it over to\nhim.\"\n\n\"As you are going tomorrow, it is likely that I shall go with you; for\nI am going down, also, as far as Abu Hamed, for ten days.\"\n\n\"That will be pleasant, though I do not know that it will be so for\nyou; for I own the majority of us are rather sour-tempered, at present.\nThough we may be glad enough to go, one does not care to be sent off at\na moment's notice, just as fractious children are turned out of a room,\nwhen their elders want a private chat. However, for myself, I am not\ninclined to grumble. I want to go, and therefore I do not stand on the\norder of going.\"\n\nLater, General Hunter gave Gregory an order, for a passage in a steamer\non which the correspondents of the various newspapers were going down.\n\n\"What shall we take, master?\" Zaki asked.\n\n\"Just the clothes we stand in, Zaki. I have got a couple of the Dervish\nRemingtons, and several packets of ammunition. I will take them, and I\ncan get four more. We will take them all down, as we know the people\nabout Hebbeh are not disposed to be friendly. I don't suppose, for a\nminute, that they are likely to show any hostile feeling; for you may\nbe sure that the fall of Omdurman has spread, by this time, over the\nwhole land, and they will be on their best behaviour. Still, it is just\nas well to be able to defend ourselves, and I shall engage four men at\nAbu Hamed to go with us. I shall leave all my kit here.\"\n\nIt was a pleasant run down the river, to Atbara. The correspondents\nwere all heartily glad to be on their way home; and the irritation they\nhad at first felt, at being so suddenly ordered away, at the moment\nwhen so unexpected and interesting a development occurred, had\nsubsided. They had witnessed one of the most interesting battles ever\nfought, had seen the overthrow of the Mahdi, and were looking forward\nto European comforts and luxuries again.\n\nAt Atbara all left the steamer, which was to take in stores, and go up\nagain at once; and proceeded, by a military train, with the first of\nthe returned European regiments.\n\nAt Abu Hamed, Gregory left them. His first enquiry was whether any\nboats were going down the river. He learned that several native craft\nwere leaving, and at once engaged a passage in one of them to Hebbeh.\nHe had no difficulty, whatever, in engaging four sturdy Arabs from\namong those who were listlessly hanging round the little station. While\nhe was doing this, Zaki bought food for six men, for a week; and in\nless than two hours from his arrival at Abu Hamed, Gregory was on\nboard.\n\nThe boat at once dropped down the river and, as the current was running\nstrongly, they were off Hebbeh next morning, at eight o'clock. A boat\nput off, and took Gregory and his party ashore. As they were seen to\nland, the village sheik at once came down to them.\n\n\"Is there anything I can do for my lord?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes; I have come here to ascertain whether any of those, who were\npresent at the attack upon the party who landed from the steamer over\nthere, are still living here. There is no question of punishment. On\nthe contrary, I have come here to obtain information as to some private\nmatters, and anyone who can give me that information will be well\nrewarded.\"\n\n\"There are but three men alive who were here at the time, my lord.\nThere were more, but they fled when the boats with the white troops\ncame up, from Merawi. I believe they went to the Dervish camp at\nMetemmeh.\n\n\"The three here are quiet and respectable men. They were asked many\nquestions, and guided the white officers to the place where Wad Etman\nstood--it was there that those who landed from the steamer first\nrested--and to the place where the great house of Suleiman Wad Gamr,\nEmir of Salamat, stood.\n\n\"It was there that the much to be regretted attack on the white men was\nmade. When the white army came up, six months afterwards, they blew up\nthe house, and cut down all the palm trees in the village.\"\n\n\"I was with the force that came up from Merawi, last year. Will you\nbring me the three men you speak of? I would question them, one by one.\nAssure them that they need not be afraid of answering truthfully, even\nif they themselves were concerned in the attack upon the white\nofficers, and the crew of the steamer, for no steps will be taken\nagainst them. It is eighteen years since then; and, no doubt, their\nhouses were destroyed and their groves cut down, when the British\ncolumn came here and found the place deserted. I am ready to reward\nthem, if I obtain the information I require from them.\"\n\nThe three men were presently brought to the spot where Gregory had\nseated himself, in the shade of one of the huts. Zaki stood beside him,\nand the four armed men took post, a short distance away.\n\nThe first called up was a very old man. In reply to Gregory's\nquestions, he said:\n\n\"I was already old when the steamboat ran ashore. I took no hand in the\nbusiness; the white men had done me no harm, while the followers of the\nMahdi had killed many of my family and friends. I heard what was going\nto be done, and I stayed in my house. I call upon Allah to witness that\nwhat I say is true!\"\n\n\"Do you know if any remains of that expedition are still in existence?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. When the white troops came here, some months afterwards,\nI fled, as all here did; but I know that, before they destroyed Wad\nGamr's house, they took away some boxes of papers that had been brought\nashore from the ship, and were still in the house. I know of nothing\nelse. The clothes of the men on board the steamboat were divided among\nthose who took part in the attack, but there was little booty.\"\n\nGregory knew that, at Wad Gamr's house, but few signs of the tragedy\nhad been found when General Brackenbury's troops entered. Bloodstained\nvisiting cards of Stewart's, a few scraps of paper, and a field glass\nhad, alone, been discovered, besides the boxes of papers.\n\nThe next man who came up said that he had been with the party who fell\nupon the engineers and crew of the boat, by the riverside.\n\n\"I was ordered to kill them,\" he said. \"Had I not done so, I should\nhave been killed, myself.\"\n\n\"Do you know whether any booty was hidden away, before the English\ncame?\"\n\n\"No, my lord, there was no booty taken. No money was found on board the\nsteamer. We stripped her of the brass work, and took the wood ashore,\nto burn. The sheik gave us a dollar and a half a man, for what we had\ndone. There may have been some money found on the ship, but as his own\nmen were on board first, and took all that they thought of value, I\nhave naught to say about it.\"\n\n\"And you never heard of anything being hidden, before the British\ntroops arrived?\"\n\nThe Arab shook his head.\n\n\"No, my lord, but there may have been, though I never heard of it. I\nwent and fought at Kirkeban; and when we were beaten, I fled at once to\nBerber, and remained there until the white troops had all gone down the\ncountry.\"\n\n\"I may want to question you again tomorrow,\" Gregory said. \"Here are\ntwo dollars. I shall give you as much more, if I want you again.\"\n\nThe third man was then called up. He was evidently in fear.\n\n\"Do not be afraid to answer me truly,\" Gregory said. \"If you do so, no\nharm will come to you, whatever share you may have had in the affair.\nBut if you answer falsely, and the truth is afterwards discovered, you\nwill be punished. Now, where were you when this business took place?\"\n\n\"We were all ordered, by Wad Gamr, to gather near his house; and, when\nthe signal was given, we were to run in and kill the white men. We saw\nthem go up to the house. They had been told to leave their arms behind\nthem. One of the sheik's servants came out and waved his arms, and we\nran in and killed them.\"\n\n\"What happened then?\"\n\n\"We carried the bodies outside the house. Then we took what money was\nfound in their pockets, with watches and other things, in to the sheik;\nand he paid us a dollar and a half a head, and said that we could have\ntheir clothes. For my share, I had a jacket belonging to one of them.\nWhen I got it home, I found that there was a pocket inside, and in it\nwas a book partly written on, and many other bits of paper.\"\n\n\"And what became of that?\" Gregory asked, eagerly.\n\n\"I threw it into a corner. It was of no use to me. But when the white\ntroops came up in the boats, and beat us at Kirkeban, I came straight\nhome and, seeing the pocketbook, took it and hid it under a rock; for I\nthought that when the white troops got here, they would find it, and\nthat they might then destroy the house, and cut down my trees. Then I\nwent away, and did not come back until they had all gone.\"\n\n\"And where is the pocketbook, now?\"\n\n\"It may be under the rock where I hid it, my lord. I have never thought\nof it, since. It was rubbish.\"\n\n\"Can you take me to the place?\"\n\n\"I think so. It was not far from my house. I pushed it under the first\ngreat rock I came to, for I was in haste; and wanted to be away before\nthe white soldiers, on camels, could get here.\"\n\n\"Did you hear of any other things being hidden?\"\n\n\"No. I think everything was given up. If this thing had been of value I\nshould, perhaps, have told the sheik; but as it was only written\npapers, and of no use to anyone, I did not trouble to do so.\"\n\n\"Well, let us go at once,\" Gregory said, rising to his feet. \"Although\nof no use to you, these papers may be of importance.\"\n\nFollowed by Zaki and the four men, Gregory went to the peasant's house,\nwhich stood a quarter of a mile away.\n\n\"This is not the house I lived in, then,\" the man said. \"The white\ntroops destroyed every house in the village; but, when they had gone, I\nbuilt another on the same spot.\"\n\nThe hill rose steeply, behind it. The peasant went on, till he stopped\nat a large boulder.\n\n\"This was the rock,\" he said, \"where I thrust it under, as far as my\narm would reach. I pushed it in on the upper side.\"\n\nThe man lay down.\n\n\"It was just about here,\" he said.\n\n\"It is here, my lord. I can just feel it, but I cannot get it out. I\npushed it in as far as the tips of my fingers could reach it.\"\n\n\"Well, go down and cut a couple of sticks, three or four feet long.\"\n\nIn ten minutes, the man returned with them.\n\n\"Now take one of them and, when you feel the book, push the stick along\nits side, until it is well beyond it. Then you ought to be able to\nscrape it out. If you cannot do so, we shall have to roll the stone\nover. It is a big rock, but with two or three poles, one ought to be\nable to turn it over.\"\n\nAfter several attempts, however, the man produced the packet. Gregory\nopened it, with trembling hands. It contained, as the man had said, a\nlarge number of loose sheets, evidently torn from a pocketbook, and all\ncovered with close writing.\n\nHe opened the book that accompanied them. It was written in ink, and\nthe first few words sufficed to tell him that his search was over. It\nbegan:\n\n\"Khartoum. Thank God, after two years of suffering and misery, since\nthe fatal day at El Obeid, I am once again amongst friends. It is true\nthat I am still in peril, for the position here is desperate. Still,\nthe army that is coming up to our help may be here in time; and even if\nthey should not do so, this may be found when they come, and will be\ngiven to my dear wife at Cairo, if she is still there. Her name is Mrs.\nHilliard, and her address will surely be known, at the Bank.\"\n\n\"These are the papers I was looking for,\" he said to Zaki. \"I will tell\nyou about them, afterwards.\"\n\nHe handed ten dollars to the native, thrust the packet into his breast\npocket, and walked slowly down to the river. He had never entertained\nany hope of finding his father, but this evidence of his death gave him\na shock.\n\nHis mother was right, then. She had always insisted there was a\npossibility that he might have escaped the massacre at El Obeid. He had\ndone so. He had reached Khartoum. He had started, full of hope of\nseeing his wife and child, but had been treacherously massacred, here.\n\nHe would not, now, read this message from the grave. That must be\nreserved for some time when he was alone. He knew enough to be able to\nguess the details--they could not be otherwise than painful. He felt\nalmost glad that his mother was not alive. To him, the loss was\nscarcely a real one. His father had left him, when an infant. Although\nhis mother had so often spoken of him, he had scarcely been a reality\nto Gregory; for when he became old enough to comprehend the matter, it\nseemed to him certain that his father must have been killed. He could,\nthen, hardly understand how his mother could cling to hope.\n\nHis father had been more a real character to him, since he started from\nCairo, than ever before. He knew the desert, now, and its fierce\ninhabitants. He could picture the battle and since the fight at\nOmdurman he had been able to see, before him, the wild rush on the\nEgyptian square, the mad confusion, the charge of a handful of white\nofficers, and the one white man going off, with the black battalion\nthat held together.\n\nIf, then, it was a shock to him to know how his father had died, how\nvastly greater would it have been, to his mother! She had pictured him\nas dying suddenly, fighting to the last, and scarce conscious of pain\ntill he received a fatal wound. She had said, to Gregory, that it was\nbetter to think of his father as having died thus, than lingering in\nhopeless slavery, like Neufeld; but it would have been agony to her to\nknow that he did suffer for two years, that he had then struggled on\nthrough all dangers to Khartoum, and was on his way back, full of hope\nand love for her, when he was treacherously murdered.\n\nThe village sheik met him, as he went down.\n\n\"You have found nothing, my lord?\"\n\n\"Nothing but a few old papers,\" he said.\n\n\"You will report well of us, I hope, to the great English commander?\"\n\n\"I shall certainly tell him that you did all in your power to aid me.\"\n\nHe walked down towards the river. One of the men, who had gone on while\nhe had been speaking to the sheik, ran back to meet him.\n\n\"There is a steamer coming up the river, my lord.\"\n\n\"That is fortunate, indeed,\" Gregory exclaimed. \"I had intended to\nsleep here, tonight, and to bargain with the sheik for donkeys or\ncamels to take us back. This will save two days.\"\n\nTwo or three native craft were fastened up to the shore, waiting for a\nbreeze to set in, strong enough to take them up. Gregory at once\narranged, with one of them, to put his party on board the steamer, in\ntheir boat. In a quarter of an hour the gunboat approached, and they\nrowed out to meet her.\n\nAs she came up, Gregory stood up, and shouted to them to throw him a\nrope. This was done, and an officer came to the side.\n\n\"I want a passage for myself and five men, to Abu Hamed. I am an\nofficer on General Hunter's staff.\"\n\n\"With pleasure.\n\n\"Have you come down from the front?\" he asked, as Gregory stepped on\nboard, with the five blacks.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you can tell me about the great fight. We heard of it, at\nDongola, but beyond the fact that we had thrashed the Khalifa, and\ntaken Omdurman, we received no particulars.\n\n\"But before you begin, have a drink.\n\n\"It is horribly annoying to me,\" he went on, as they sat down under the\nawning, and the steward brought tumblers, soda water, some whisky, and\ntwo lemons.\n\nGregory refused the whisky, but took a lemon with his cold water.\n\n\"A horrible nuisance,\" the officer went on. \"This is one of Gordon's\nold steamers; she has broken down twice. Still, I console myself by\nthinking that, even if I had been in time, very likely she would not\nhave been taken up.\n\n\"I hope, however, there will be work to do, yet. As you see, I have got\nthree of these native craft in tow, and it is as much as I can do to\nget them up this cataract.\n\n\"Now, please tell me about the battle.\"\n\nGregory gave him an outline of the struggle, of the occupation of\nOmdurman, and of what might be called the funeral service of Gordon, at\nKhartoum. It was dark before the story was finished.\n\n\"By the way,\" the officer said, as they were about to sit down to\ndinner, \"while we were on deck, I did not ask about your men. I must\norder food to be given them.\"\n\n\"They have plenty,\" Gregory said. \"I brought enough for a week with me.\nI thought that I might be detained two or three days, here, and be\nobliged to make the journey by land to Abu Hamed.\"\n\n\"I have not asked you what you were doing at this out of the way place,\nand how long you have been here.\"\n\n\"I only landed this morning. I came down to search for some relics. My\nfather was on board Stewart's steamer, and as there would be nothing\ndoing at Omdurman, for a few days, I got leave to run down. I was\nfortunate in securing a boat at Abu Hamed, on my arrival there; and I\nhave been equally so, now, in having been picked up by you; so that I\nshall not be away from Omdurman more than seven days, if I have equal\nluck in getting a steamer at Atbara. I do not think I shall be\ndisappointed, for the white troops are coming down, and stores are\ngoing up for the Egyptian brigade, so that I am certain not to be kept\nthere many hours. The Sirdar has gone up to Fashoda, or I don't suppose\nI should have got leave.\"\n\n\"Yes. I heard at Merawi, from the officer in command, that some foreign\ntroops had arrived there. I suppose nothing more is known about it?\"\n\n\"No; no news will probably come down for another fortnight, perhaps\nlonger than that.\"\n\n\"Who can they be?\"\n\n\"The general idea is that they are French. They can only be French, or\na party from the Congo States.\"\n\n\"They had tremendous cheek, whoever they are,\" the officer said. \"It is\nprecious lucky, for them, that we have given the Khalifa something else\nto think about, or you may be sure he would have wiped them out pretty\nquickly; unless they are a very strong force, which doesn't seem\nprobable. I hear the Sirdar has taken a regiment up with him.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I don't suppose any actual move will be made, at present.\"\n\n\"No, I suppose it will be a diplomatic business. Still, I should think\nthey would have to go.\"\n\n\"No one has any doubt about that, at Omdurman,\" Gregory said. \"After\nall the expense and trouble we have had to retake the Soudan, it is not\nlikely that we should let anyone else plant themselves on the road to\nthe great lakes.\n\n\"When will you be at Abu Hamed, sir?\"\n\n\"We shall be there about five o'clock--at any rate, I think you may\nsafely reckon on catching the morning train. It goes, I think, at\neight.\"\n\n\"I am sure to catch a train, soon, for orders have been sent down that\nrailway materials shall be sent up, as quickly as possible; as it has\nbeen decided that the railway shall be carried on, at once, to\nKhartoum. I expect that, as soon as the Nile falls, they will make a\ntemporary bridge across the Atbara.\"\n\nIt was six in the morning, when the steamer arrived at Abu Hamed.\nGregory at once landed, paid his four men, went up to the little\nstation; and, an hour later, was on his way to Atbara Fort. He had but\ntwo hours to wait there, and reached Omdurman at three o'clock, on the\nfollowing afternoon. As he landed, he met an officer he knew.\n\n\"Is there any news?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing but Fashoda is talked about. It has been ascertained that the\nforce there is undoubtedly French. The betting is about even as to\nwhether France will back down, or not. They have made it difficult for\nthemselves, by an outburst of enthusiasm at what they considered the\ndefeat of England. Well, of course, that does not go for much, except\nthat it makes it harder for their government to give in.\"\n\n\"And has any news been received of the whereabouts of the Khalifa?\"\n\n\"No. Broadwood, with two regiments of Egyptian cavalry and the camel\ncorps, started in pursuit of the Khalifa and Osman, an hour after it\nwas found that they had got away. Slatin Pasha went with them. But as\nthe horses had been at work all day, they had to stop at half past\neight. They could not then get down to the water, and bivouacked where\nthey had halted. At four in the morning they started again, and at half\npast eight found a spot where they could get down to the river; then\nthey rode fifteen miles farther.\n\n\"They were now thirty-five miles from Omdurman. One of the gunboats had\ngone up with supplies, but owing to the Nile having overflowed, could\nnot get near enough to land them. Next morning they got news that the\nKhalifa was twenty-five miles ahead, and had just obtained fresh\ncamels, so they were ordered to return to the town. They had picked up\na good many of the fugitives, among them the Khalifa's favourite wife;\nwho, doubtless with other women, had slipped away at one of his halting\nplaces, feeling unable to bear the constant fatigues and hardships of\nthe flight in the desert.\n\n\"The cavalry have since been out again, but beyond the fact that the\nKhalifa had been joined by many of the fugitives from the battle, and\nwas making for Kordofan, no certain news has been obtained. At present,\nnothing can be done in that direction.\n\n\"That horse you bought is all right.\"\n\n\"I really did not like taking him, for I already had one; and it looked\nalmost like robbery, giving him two pounds for it, and the saddle.\"\n\n\"Others have done as well,\" the officer laughed. \"One of the brigade\nstaff bought a horse for a pound from Burleigh, who had given forty for\nit at Cairo. There was no help for it. They could not take horses down.\nBesides, it is not their loss, after all. The newspapers can afford to\npay for them. They must have been coining money, of late.\"\n\n\"That reconciles me,\" Gregory laughed. \"I did not think of the\ncorrespondents' expenses being paid by the papers.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about their arrangements, but it stands to\nreason that it must be so, in a campaign like this. In an ordinary war,\na man can calculate what his outlay might be; but on an expedition of\nthis kind, no one could foretell what expenses he might have to incur.\n\n\"Besides, the Sirdar has saved the newspapers an enormous expenditure.\nThe correspondents have been rigidly kept down to messages of a few\nhundred words; whereas, if they had had their own way, they would have\nsent down columns. Of course, the correspondents grumbled, but I have\nno doubt their employers were very well pleased, and the newspapers\nmust have saved thousands of pounds, by this restriction.\"\n\n\"You are back sooner than I expected,\" General Hunter said, when\nGregory went in and reported his arrival. \"It is scarce a week since\nyou left.\"\n\n\"Just a week, sir. Everything went smoothly, and I was but three or\nfour hours at Hebbeh.\"\n\n\"And did you succeed in your search?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I most fortunately found a man who had hidden a pocketbook\nhe had taken from the body of one of the white men who were murdered\nthere. There was nothing in it but old papers and, when Brackenbury's\nexpedition approached, he had hidden it away; and did not give it a\nthought, until I enquired if he knew of any papers, and other things,\nconnected with those on board the steamer. He at once took me to the\nplace where he had hidden it, under a great stone, and it turned out to\nbe the notebook and journals of my father; who was, as I thought\npossible, the white man who had arrived at Khartoum, a short time\nbefore the place was captured by the Dervishes, and who had gone down\nin the steamer that carried Colonel Stewart.\"\n\n\"Well, Hilliard,\" the General said, kindly, \"even the certain knowledge\nof his death is better than the fear that he might be in slavery. You\ntold me you had no remembrance of him?\"\n\n\"None, sir; but of course, my mother had talked of him so often, and\nhad several photographs of him--the last taken at Cairo, before he\nleft--so that I almost seem to have known him. However, I do feel it as\na relief to know that he is not, as I feared was remotely possible, a\nslave among the Baggara. But I think it is hard that, after having gone\nthrough two years of trials and sufferings, he should have been\nmurdered on his way home.\"\n\n\"No doubt that is so. Have you read your father's diary, yet?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I have not had the heart to do so, and shall put it off,\nuntil the shock that this has given me has passed away. I feel that a\nlittle hard work will be the best thing for me. Is there any chance of\nit?\"\n\n\"You have just returned in time. I am going up the Blue Nile, tomorrow\nmorning, to clear out the villages; which, no doubt, are all full of\nfugitives. I am glad that you have come back. I was speaking of you\ntoday to General Rundle, who is in command.\n\n\"One of the objects of the expedition is to prevent Fadil from crossing\nthe river. He was advancing from Gedareh, at the head of ten thousand\ntroops, to join the Khalifa; and was but forty miles away, on the day\nafter we took this place; but when he received the news of our victory,\nhe fell back. If he can cross, he will bring a very formidable\nreinforcement to the Khalifa.\n\n\"We know that Colonel Parsons started from Kassala, on the 7th, his\nobject being to capture Gedareh, during the absence of Fadil. He is to\ncross the Atbara at El Fasher, and will then march up this bank of the\nriver, till he is at the nearest point to Gedareh. It is probable that\nhe will not strike across before the 18th, or the 20th. His force is\ncomparatively small, and we do not know how large a garrison Fadil will\nhave left there.\n\n\"Altogether, we are uneasy about the expedition. It is very desirable\nthat Parsons should know that Fadil is retiring, and that, so far as we\ncan learn from the natives, he has not yet crossed the Blue Nile.\nGedareh is said to be a strong place, and once there, Parsons might\nhold it against Fadil until we can send him reinforcements.\n\n\"In order to convey this information to him, we require someone on whom\nwe can absolutely rely. I said that, if you were here, I felt sure that\nyou would volunteer for the service. Of course it is, to a certain\nextent, a dangerous one; but I think that, speaking the language as you\ndo, and as you have already been among the Dervishes, you might, even\nif taken prisoner, make out a good story for yourself.\"\n\n\"I would undertake the commission, with pleasure,\" Gregory said. \"I\nshall, of course, go in native dress.\"\n\n\"I propose that we carry you a hundred miles up the river, with us, and\nthere land you. From that point, it would not be more than sixty or\nseventy miles across the desert to the Atbara, which you would strike\nforty or fifty miles above El Fasher. Of course you would be able to\nlearn, there, whether Parsons had crossed. If he had, you would ride up\nthe bank till you overtake him. If he had not, you would probably meet\nhim at Mugatta. He must cross below that, as it is there he leaves the\nriver.\"\n\n\"That seems simple enough, sir. My story would be that I was one of the\nDervishes, who had escaped from the battle here; and had stopped at a\nvillage, thinking that I was safe from pursuit, until your boats came\nalong; and that I then crossed the desert to go to Gedareh, where I\nthought I should be safe. That would surely carry me through. I shall\nwant two fast camels--one for myself, and one for my boy.\"\n\n\"These we can get for you, from Abdul Azil, the Abadah sheik. Of\ncourse, you will put on Dervish robes and badges?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I will go across and tell General Rundle, and obtain written\ninstructions for you to carry despatches to Parsons. I will give them\nto you when you go up on the boat, in the morning. I will see at once\nabout the camels, and ask the Intelligence people to get you two of the\nDervish suits. You will also want rifles.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir! I have a couple of Remingtons, and plenty of\nammunition for them. I have two spears, also, which I picked up when we\ncame in here.\"\n\n\"We are off again, Zaki,\" he said, when he returned to his hut; where\nthe black was engaged in sweeping up the dust, and arranging everything\nas usual.\n\n\"Yes, master.\" Zaki suspended his work. \"When do we go?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"Do we take everything with us?\"\n\n\"No. I start in uniform. We shall both want Dervish dresses, but you\nneed not trouble about them--they will be got for us.\"\n\n\"Then we are going among the Dervishes, again?\"\n\n\"Well, I hope we are not; but we may meet some of them. We are going\nwith the expedition up the Blue Nile, and will then land and strike\nacross the desert, to the Atbara. That is enough for you to know, at\npresent. We shall take our guns and spears with us.\"\n\nZaki had no curiosity. If his master was going, it was of course all\nright--his confidence in him was absolute.\n\nIn about an hour, a native from the Intelligence Department brought\ndown two Dervish dresses, complete. They had still three hours before\nmess, and Gregory sat down on his bed, and opened his father's\npocketbook, which he had had no opportunity to do, since it came into\nhis possession.\n\n\n\nChapter 17: A Fugitive.\n\n\n\"I do not suppose,\" the diary began, \"that what I write here will ever\nbe read. It seems to me that the chances are immeasurably against it.\nStill, there is a possibility that it may fall into the hands of some\nof my countrymen when, as will surely be the case, the Mahdi's\nrebellion is crushed and order restored; and I intend, so long as I\nlive, to jot down from time to time what happens to me, in order that\nthe only person living interested in me, my wife, may possibly,\nsomeday, get to know what my fate has been. Therefore, should this\nscrap of paper, and other scraps that may follow it, be ever handed to\none of my countrymen, I pray him to send it to Mrs. Hilliard, care of\nthe manager of the Bank at Cairo.\n\n\"It may be that this, the first time I write, may be the last; and I\ntherefore, before all things, wish to send her my heart's love, to tell\nher that my last thoughts and my prayers will be for her, and that I\nleave it entirely to her whether to return to England, in accordance\nwith the instructions I left her before leaving, or to remain in Cairo.\n\n\"It is now five days since the battle. It cannot be called a battle. It\nwas not fighting; it was a massacre. The men, after three days'\nincessant fighting, were exhausted and worn out, half mad with thirst,\nhalf mutinous at being brought into the desert, as they said, to die.\nThus, when the Dervishes rushed down in a mass, the defence was feeble.\nAlmost before we knew what had happened, the enemy had burst in on one\nside of the square. Then all was wild confusion--camels and Dervishes,\nflying Egyptians, screaming camp followers, were all mixed in\nconfusion.\n\n\"The other sides of the square were also attacked. Some of our men were\nfiring at those in their front, others turning round and shooting into\nthe crowded mass in the square. I was with a black regiment, on the\nside opposite to where they burst in. The white officer who had been in\ncommand had fallen ill, and had been sent back, a few days after we\nleft Khartoum; and as I had been, for weeks before that, aiding him to\nthe best of my powers, and there were no other officers to spare, Hicks\nasked me to take his place. As I had done everything I could for the\npoor fellows' comfort, on the march; they had come to like me, and to\nobey my orders as promptly as those of their former commander.\n\n\"As long as the other two sides of the square stood firm, I did so; but\nthey soon gave way. I saw Hicks, with his staff, charge into the midst\nof the Dervishes, and then lost sight of them. Seeing that all was\nlost, I called to my men to keep together, to march off in regular\norder, and repel all assaults, as this was the only hope there was of\ngetting free.\n\n\"They obeyed my orders splendidly. Two or three times the Dervishes\ncharged upon them, but the blacks were as steady as rocks, and their\nvolleys were so fatal that the enemy finally left us alone, preferring\nto aid in the slaughter of the panic-stricken Egyptians, and to share\nthe spoil.\n\n\"We made for the wells. Each man drank his fill. Those who had water\nbottles filled them. We then marched on towards El Obeid, but before\nnightfall the Dervish horse had closed up round us. At daylight their\ninfantry had also arrived, and fighting began.\n\n\"All day we held our position, killing great numbers, but losing many\nmen ourselves. By night, our water was exhausted. Then the soldiers\noffered to attack the enemy, but they were twenty to one against us,\nand I said to them, 'No, fight one day longer, if we can hold on. The\nDervishes may retire, or they may offer us terms.'\n\n\"So we stood. By the next evening, we had lost half our number. After\nthey had drawn off, one of the Dervish emirs came in with a white flag,\nand offered life to all who would surrender, and would wear the badge\nof the Mahdi, and be his soldiers. I replied that an answer should be\ngiven in the morning. When he had left, I gathered the men together.\n\n\"'You have fought nobly,' I said, 'but you have scarce a round of\nammunition left. If we fight again tomorrow, we shall all be\nslaughtered. I thank you, in the name of the Khedive, for all that you\nhave done; but I do not urge you to reject the terms offered. Your\ndeaths would not benefit the Khedive. As far as I am concerned, you are\nfree to accept the terms offered.'\n\n\"They talked for some time together, and then the three native officers\nwho were still alive came forward.\n\n\"'Bimbashi,' they said, 'what will be done about you? We are Mahometans\nand their countrymen, but you are a white man and a Christian. You\nwould not fight for the Mahdi?'\n\n\"'No,' I said, 'I would not fight for him, nor would I gain my life, at\nthe price of being his slave. I wish you to settle the matter, without\nany reference to me. I will take my chance. I may not be here, in the\nmorning. One man might escape, where many could not. All I ask is that\nI may not be watched. If in the morning I am not here, you can all say\nthat I disappeared, and you do not know how. I do not, myself, know\nwhat I am going to do yet.'\n\n\"They went away, and in a quarter of an hour returned, and said that\nthe men would surrender. If they had water and ammunition, they would\ngo on fighting till the end; but as they had neither, they would\nsurrender.\n\n\"I felt that this was best. The Soudanese love battle, and would as\nreadily fight on one side as on the other. They have done their duty\nwell to the Khedive, and will doubtless fight as bravely for the Mahdi.\n\n\"The men lay in a square, as they had fought, with sentries placed to\nwarn them, should the Dervishes make a night attack. British troops\nwould have been well-nigh maddened with thirst, after being twenty-four\nhours without water, and fighting all day in the blazing sun, but they\nfelt it little. They were thirsty, but in their desert marches they are\naccustomed to thirst, and to hold on for a long time without water.\n\n\"I was better off, for I had drunk sparingly, the day before, from my\nwater bottle; and had still a draught left in it. I waited until I\nthought that the men were all asleep; then I stripped, and stained\nmyself from head to foot. I had carried stain with me, in case I might\nhave to go out as a native, to obtain information. In my valise I had a\nnative dress, and a native cloth, in which I could have passed as a\npeasant, but not as one of the Baggara. However, I put it on, passed\nthrough the sleeping men, and went up to a sentry.\n\n\"'You know me,' I said. 'I am your Bimbashi. I am going to try and get\nthrough their lines; but if it is known how I have escaped, I shall be\npursued and slain. Will you swear to me that, if you are questioned,\nyou will say you know nothing of my flight?'\n\n\"'I swear by the beard of the Prophet,' the man said. 'May Allah\nprotect you, my lord!'\n\n\"Then I went on. The night was fairly dark and, as the Dervishes were\nnearly half a mile away, I had no fear of being seen by them. There\nwere many of their dead scattered about, seventy or eighty yards from\nour square. I had, all along, felt convinced that it would be\nimpossible to pass through their lines; therefore I went to a spot\nwhere I had noticed that a number had fallen, close together, and went\nabout examining them carefully. It would not have done to have chosen\nthe dress of an emir, as his body might have been examined, but the\nordinary dead would pass unnoticed.\n\n\"I first exchanged the robe for one marked with the Mahdi's patches. It\nwas already smeared with blood. I then carried the body of the man\nwhose robe I had taken off, for some distance. I laid him down on his\nface, thinking that the absence of the patches would not be seen. Then\nI crawled some thirty or forty yards nearer to the Dervishes, so that\nit would seem that I had strength to get that far, before dying. Then I\nlay down, partly on my side, so that the patches would show, but with\nmy face downwards on my arm.\n\n\"I had, before dyeing my skin, cut my hair close to my head, on which I\nplaced the Dervish's turban. The only property that I brought out with\nme was a revolver, and this pocketbook. Both of these I buried in the\nsand; the pocketbook a short distance away, the pistol lightly covered,\nand within reach of my hand, so that I could grasp it and sell my life\ndearly, if discovered.\n\n\"Soon after daylight I heard the triumphant yells of the Dervishes, and\nknew that my men had surrendered. Then there was a rush of horse and\nfoot, and much shouting and talking. I lifted my head slightly, and\nlooked across. Not a Dervish was to be seen in front of me.\n\n\"I felt that I had better move, so, taking up my pistol and hiding it,\nI crawled on my hands and knees to the spot where I had hidden this\nbook; and then got up on to my feet, and staggered across the plain, as\nif sorely wounded, and scarcely able to drag my feet along. As I had\nhoped, no one seemed to notice me, and I saw three or four other\nfigures, also making their way painfully towards where the Dervishes\nhad encamped.\n\n\"Here were a few camels, standing untended. Everyone had joined in the\nrush for booty--a rush to be met with bitter disappointment, for, with\nthe exception of the arms of the fallen, and what few valuables they\nmight have about their person, there was nothing to be gained. I\ndiverged from the line I had been following, kept on until there was a\ndip in the ground, that would hide me from the sight of those behind;\nthen I started to run, and at last threw myself down in the scrub, four\nor five miles away from the point from which I had started.\n\n\"I was perfectly safe, for the present. The Dervishes were not likely\nto search over miles of the desert, dotted as it was with thick bushes.\nThe question was as to the future. My position was almost as bad as\ncould be. I was without food or water, and there were hundreds of miles\nof desert between me and Khartoum. At every water hole I should, almost\ncertainly, find parties of Dervishes.\n\n\"From time to time I lifted my head, and saw several large parties of\nthe enemy, moving in the distance. They were evidently bound on a\njourney, and were not thinking of looking for me. I chewed the sour\nleaves of the camel bush; and this, to some extent, alleviated my\nthirst.\n\n\"I determined at last that I would, in the first place, march to the\nwells towards which we had been pressing, when the Dervishes came up to\nus. They were nearly three miles south of the spot where the square had\nstood. No doubt, Dervishes would be there; but, if discovered by them,\nit was better to die so than of thirst.\n\n\"Half an hour before the sun sank, I started. No horsemen were in\nsight, and if any were to come along, I could see them long before they\ncould notice me. Knowing the general direction, I was fortunate enough\nto get sight of the palm grove which surrounded the wells, before\ndarkness set in.\n\n\"It lay about two miles away, and there were certainly moving objects\nround it. I lay down until twilight had passed, and then went forward.\nWhen within two or three hundred yards of the grove, I lay down again,\nand waited. That the Dervishes would all go to sleep, however long I\nmight wait, was too much to hope for. They would be sure to sit and\ntalk, far into the night, of the events of the last three or four days.\n\n\"Shielding myself as well as I could, by the bushes, I crawled up until\nI was in the midst of some camels, which were browsing. Here I stood\nup, and then walked boldly into the grove. As I had expected, two or\nthree score of Dervishes were sitting in groups, talking gravely. They\nhad destroyed the Turks (as they always called the Egyptians, and their\ninfidel white leaders), but had suffered heavily themselves. The three\nhundred Soudanese who had surrendered, and who had taken service with\nthe Mahdi, were but poor compensation for the losses they had suffered.\n\n\"'A year ago,' one old sheik said, 'I was the father of eight brave\nsons. Now they have all gone before me. Four of them fell in the\nassaults at El Obeid, two at Baria, and the last two have now been\nkilled. I shall meet them all again, in the abode of the blessed; and\nthe sooner the better, for I have no one left to care for.'\n\n\"Others had tales of the loss of relations and friends, but I did not\nwait to listen further. Taking up a large water gourd, that stood empty\nat the foot of one of the trees, I boldly walked to the well, descended\nthe rough steps at the water's edge, and drank till I could drink no\nlonger; and then, filling the gourd, went up again.\n\n\"No one noticed me. Had they looked at me they would have seen, even in\nthe darkness, the great patches down the front of the robe; but I don't\nthink anyone did notice me. Other figures were moving about, from group\nto group, and I kept on through the grove, until beyond the trees. I\ncame out on the side opposite to that which I had entered, and, as I\nexpected, found some of the Dervish horses grazing among the bushes.\n\n\"No guard was placed over them, as they were too well trained to wander\nfar. I went out to them and chose the poorest, which happened to be\nfarther among the bushes than the others. I had thought the matter well\nover. If a good horse were taken, there would be furious pursuit, as\nsoon as it was missed; and this might be soon, for the Arabs are\npassionately fond of their favourite horses--more so than they are of\ntheir families. While I had been waiting at the edge of the wood, more\nthan one had come out to pat and fondle his horse, and give it a\nhandful of dates. But a poor animal would meet with no such attention,\nand the fact that he was missing was not likely to be discovered till\ndaylight. Probably, no great search would be made for it. The others\nwould ride on, and its owner might spend some hours in looking about,\nthinking it had strayed away, and was lying somewhere among the bushes.\n\n\"I had no thought of trying to return to Khartoum. The wells were far\napart, and Dervish bands were certain to be moving along the line. It\nseemed to me that El Obeid was the safest place to go to. True, it was\nin the hands of the Mahdists, but doubtless many wounded would be\nmaking their way there. Some, doubtless, would have wives and children.\nOthers might have come from distant villages, but these would all make\nfor the town, as the only place where they could find food, water, and\nshelter.\n\n\"Riding till morning, I let the horse graze, and threw myself down\namong the bushes, intending to remain there until nightfall. In the\nafternoon, on waking from a long sleep, I sat up and saw, a quarter of\na mile away, a Dervish making his way along on foot, slowly and\npainfully. This was the very chance I had hoped might occur. I got up\nat once, and walked towards him.\n\n\"'My friend is sorely wounded,' I said.\n\n\"'My journey is well-nigh ended,' he said. 'I had hoped to reach El\nObeid, but I know that I shall not arrive at the well, which lies three\nmiles away. I have already fallen three times. The next will be the\nlast. Would that the bullet of the infidel had slain me, on the spot!'\n\n\"The poor fellow spoke with difficulty, so parched were his lips and\nswollen his tongue. I went to the bush, where I had left the gourd,\nhalf full of water. The man was still standing where I had left him,\nbut when he saw the gourd in my hand he gave a little cry, and tottered\nfeebly towards me.\n\n\"'Let my friend drink,' I said. I held the gourd to his lips. 'Sip a\nlittle, first,' I said. 'You can drink your fill, afterwards.'\n\n\"'Allah has sent you to save me,' he said; and after two or three gulps\nof water, he drew back his head. 'Now I can rest till the sun has set,\nand then go forward as far as the well, and die there.'\n\n\"'Let me see your wound,' I said. 'It may be that I can relieve the\npain, a little.'\n\n\"He had been shot through the body, and it was a marvel to me how he\ncould have walked so far; but the Arabs, like other wild creatures,\nhave a wonderful tenacity of life. I aided him to the shelter of the\nthick bush, then I let him have another and longer drink, and bathed\nhis wound with water. Tearing off a strip from the bottom of his robe,\nI bound it round him, soaking it with water over the wound. He had been\nsuffering more from thirst than from pain, and he seemed stronger,\nalready.\n\n\"'Now,' I said, 'you had better sleep.'\n\n\"'I have not slept since the last battle,' he said. 'I started as soon\nas it was dark enough for me to get up, without being seen by the\nTurks. I have been walking ever since, and dared not lie down. At\nfirst, I hoped that I might get to the town where my wife lived, and\ndie in my own house. But that hope left me, as I grew weaker and\nweaker, and I have only prayed for strength enough to reach the well,\nto drink, and to die there.'\n\n\"'Sleep now,' I said. 'Be sure that I will not leave you. Is it not our\nduty to help one another? When the heat is over, we may go on. I have a\nhorse, here, which you shall ride. How far is it from the well to El\nObeid?'\n\n\"'It is four hours' journey, on foot.'\n\n\"'Good! Then you shall see your wife before morning. We will stop at\nthe well to give my horse a good drink; and then, if you feel well\nenough to go on, we will not wait above an hour.'\n\n\"'May Allah bless you!' the man said, and he then closed his eyes, and\nat once went to sleep.\n\n\"I lay down beside him, but not to sleep. I was overjoyed with my good\nfortune. Now I could enter El Obeid boldly and, the wounded man being a\nnative there, no questions would be asked me. I had a house to go to,\nand shelter, for the present.\n\n\"As to what might happen afterwards, I did not care to think. Some way\nof escape would surely occur, in time. Once my position as a Mahdist\nwas fully established, I should be able to join any party going towards\nKhartoum, and should avoid all questioning; whereas, if I were to\njourney alone, I should be asked by every band I met where I came from;\nand might, at any moment, be detected, if there happened to be any from\nthe village I should name as my abode. It was all important that this\npoor fellow should live; until, at least, I had been with him two days,\nin the town.\n\n\"From time to time, I dipped a piece of rag in the gourd, squeezed a\nfew drops of water between his lips, and then laid it on his forehead.\nWhen the sun began to get low, I went out and caught the horse. As I\ncame up, the Dervish opened his eyes.\n\n\"'I am better,' he said. 'You have restored me to life. My head is\ncool, and my lips no longer parched.'\n\n\"'Now,' I said, 'I will lift you into the saddle. You had better ride\nwith both legs on the same side. It will be better for your wound.\nThere is a mound of earth, a few yards away. If you will stand up on\nthat, I can lift you into the saddle, easily. Now put your arms round\nmy neck, and I will lift you in the standing position. If you try to\nget up, yourself, your wound might easily break out again.'\n\n\"I managed better than I had expected and, taking the bridle, led the\nhorse towards the well.\n\n\"'You must tell me the way,' I said, 'for I am a stranger in this part,\nhaving come from the Blue Nile.'\n\n\"'I know it perfectly,' he said, 'having been born in El Obeid. I\nfought against the Mahdists, till we were starved out; and then, as we\nall saw that the power of the Mahdi was great, and that Allah was with\nhim, we did not hesitate to accept his terms, and to put on his\nbadges.'\n\n\"In less than an hour, we saw the trees that marked the position of the\nwell; and, in another half hour, reached it. At least a score of\nwounded men were there, many of them so sorely hurt that they would get\nno farther. They paid little attention to us. One of them was known to\nSaleh--for the wounded man told me that that was his name--he also was\nfrom El Obeid. He was suffering from a terrible cut in the shoulder,\nwhich had almost severed the arm. He told my man that it was given by\none of the infidel officers, before he fell.\n\n\"I thought it was as well to have two friends, instead of one; and did\nwhat I could to bind his wound up, and fasten his arm firmly to his\nside. Then I said to him:\n\n\"'My horse, after three hours' rest, will be able to carry you both.\nYou can sit behind Saleh, and hold him on with your unwounded arm.'\n\n\"'Truly, stranger, you are a merciful man, and a good one. Wonderful is\nit that you should give up your horse, to men who are strangers to you;\nand walk on foot, yourself.'\n\n\"'Allah commands us to be compassionate to each other. What is a walk\nof a few miles? It is nothing, it is not worth speaking of. Say no more\nabout it, I beseech you. I am a stranger in El Obeid, and you may be\nable to befriend me, there.'\n\n\"Three hours later Abdullah, which was the name of the second man,\nmounted, and assisted me to lift Saleh in front of him, and we set out\nfor El Obeid. We got into the town at daybreak. There were few people\nabout, and these paid no attention to us. Wounded men had been coming\nin, in hundreds. Turning into the street where both the men lived, we\nwent first to the house of Saleh, which was at the farther end, and\nwas, indeed, quite in the outskirts of the place. It stood in a walled\nenclosure, and was of better appearance than I had expected.\n\n\"I went to the door, and struck my hand against it. A voice within\nasked what was wanted, and I said, 'I bring home the master of the\nhouse. He is sorely wounded.'\n\n\"There was a loud cry, and the door opened and a woman ran out.\n\n\"'Do not touch him,' Abdullah exclaimed. 'We will get him down from the\nhorse, but first bring out an angareb. We will lower him down onto\nthat.'\n\n\"The woman went in, and returned with an angareb. It was the usual\nSoudan bed, of wooden framework, with a hide lashed across it. I\ndirected them how to lift one end against the horse, so that Saleh\ncould slide down onto it.\n\n\"'Wife,' the Arab said, when this was done, 'by the will of Allah, who\nsent this stranger to my aid, I have returned alive. His name is Mudil.\nI cannot tell you, now, what he has done for me. This house is his. He\nis more than guest, he is master. He has promised to remain with me,\ntill I die, or am given back to life again. Do as he bids you, in all\nthings.'\n\n\"Abdullah would have assisted to carry the bed in, but I told him that\nit might hurt his arm, and I and the woman could do it.\n\n\"'You had better go off, at once, to your own people, Abdullah. There\nmust be many here who understand the treatment of wounds. You had\nbetter get one, at once, to attend to your arm.\"\n\n\"'I will come again, this evening,' the man replied. 'I consider that I\nalso owe my life to you; and when you have stayed a while here, you\nmust come to me. My wives and children will desire to thank you, when I\ntell them how you brought me in here.'\n\n\"'Is there any place where I can put my horse?' I asked.\n\n\"'Yes,' the woman replied; 'take it to that door in the wall. I will go\nand unfasten it.'\n\n\"There was a shed in the garden. Into this I put my horse, and then\nentered the house.\n\n\"Most of the Arab women know something of the dressing of wounds.\nSaleh's wife sent out the slave, to buy various drugs. Then she got a\nmelon from the garden, cut off the rind, and, mincing the fruit in\nsmall pieces, squeezed out the juice and gave it to her husband to\ndrink. When she had done this, she set before me a plate of pounded\nmaize, which was boiling over a little fire of sticks, when we went in.\n\n\"'It is your breakfast,' I said.\n\n\"She waved her hand.\n\n\"'I can cook more,' she said. 'It matters not if we do not eat till\nsunset.'\n\n\"I sat down at once, for indeed, I was famishing. The food had all been\nexhausted, at the end of the first day's fighting. I had been more than\ntwo days without eating a morsel. I have no doubt I ate ravenously, for\nthe woman, without a word, emptied the contents of the pot into my\nbowl, and then went out and cut another melon for me.\n\n\"When the slave woman returned, she boiled some of the herbs, made a\nsort of poultice of them, and placed it on the wound. Saleh had fallen\nasleep, the moment he had drunk the melon juice, and did not move while\nthe poultice was being applied.\n\n\"The house contained three rooms--the one which served as kitchen and\nliving room; one leading from it on the right, with the curtains\nhanging before the door (this was Saleh's room); and on the opposite\nside, the guest chamber. I have not mentioned that there were four or\nfive children, all of whom had been turned out, as soon as we entered;\nand threatened with terrible punishments, by their mother, if they made\nany noise.\n\n\"When I finished my meal I went into the guest chamber, threw myself\ndown on the angareb there, and slept till sunset. When I awoke, I found\nthat a native doctor had come, and examined Saleh. He had approved of\nwhat the woman had done, told told her to continue to poultice the\nwound, and had given her a small phial, from which she was to pour two\ndrops into the wound, morning and evening. He said, what I could have\ntold her, that her husband was in the hands of Allah, If He willed it,\nher husband would live.\n\n\"Of course, I had seen something of wounds, for in the old times--it\nseems a lifetime back--when I was, for two years, searching tombs and\nmonuments with the professor, there had been frays between our workmen\nand bands of robbers; and there were also many cases of injuries,\nincurred in the work of moving heavy fragments of masonry. Moreover,\nalthough I had no actual practice, I had seen a good deal of surgical\nwork; for, when I was at the university, I had some idea of becoming a\nsurgeon, and attended the courses there, and saw a good many\noperations. I had therefore, of course, a general knowledge of the\nstructure of the human frame, and the position of the arteries.\n\n\"So far the wound, which I examined when the woman poured in what I\nsuppose was a styptic, looked healthy and but little inflamed. Of\ncourse, a skilled surgeon would have probed it and endeavoured to\nextract the ball, which had not gone through. The Soudanese were armed\nonly with old muskets, and it was possible that the ball had not\npenetrated far; for if, as he had told me, he was some distance from\nthe square when he was hit, the bullet was probably spent.\n\n\"I told the woman so, and asked her if she had any objection to my\nendeavouring to find it. She looked surprised.\n\n\"'Are you, then, a hakim?'\n\n\"'No, but I have been at Khartoum, and have seen how the white hakims\nfind which way a bullet has gone. They are sometimes able to get it\nout. At any rate, I should not hurt him; and if, as is likely, the ball\nhas not gone in very far--for had it done so, he would probably have\ndied before he got home--I might draw it out.'\n\n\"'You can try,' she said. 'You have saved his life, and it is yours.'\n\n\"'Bring me the pistol that your husband had, in his belt.'\n\n\"She brought it to me. I took out the ramrod.\n\n\"'Now,' I said, 'it is most important that this should be clean;\ntherefore, heat it in the fire so that it is red hot, and then drop it\ninto cold water.'\n\n\"When this had been done, I took a handful of sand, and polished the\nrod till it shone, and afterwards wiped it carefully with a cloth. Then\nI inserted it in the wound, very gently. It had entered but an inch and\na half when it struck something hard, which could only be the bullet.\nIt was as I had hoped, the ball had been almost spent, when it struck\nhim.\n\n\"Saleh was awake now, and had at once consented to my suggestion,\nhaving come to have implicit faith in me.\n\n\"'It is, you see, Saleh, just as I had hoped. I felt sure that it could\nnot have gone in far; as, in that case, you could never have walked\ntwenty miles, from the battlefield, to the point where you met me. Now,\nif I had a proper instrument, I might be able to extract the bullet. I\nmight hurt you in doing so, but if I could get it out, you would\nrecover speedily; while if it remains where it is, the wound may\ninflame, and you will die.'\n\n\"'I am not afraid of pain, Mudil.'\n\n\"I could touch the ball with my finger, but beyond feeling that the\nflesh in which it was embedded was not solid to the touch, I could do\nnothing towards getting the ball out. I dared not try to enlarge the\nwound, so as to get two fingers in. After thinking the matter over in\nevery way, I decided that the only chance was to make a tool from the\nramrod. I heated this again and again, flattening it with the pistol\nbarrel, till it was not more than a tenth of an inch thick; then I cut,\nfrom the centre, a strip about a quarter of an inch wide. I then rubbed\ndown the edges of the strip on a stone, till they were perfectly\nsmooth, and bent the end into a curve. I again heated it to a dull red,\nand plunged it into water to harden it, and finally rubbed it with a\nlittle oil. It was late in the evening before I was satisfied with my\nwork.\n\n\"'Now, Saleh,' I said, 'I am going to try if this will do. If I had one\nof the tools I have seen the white hakims use, I am sure I could get\nthe ball out easily enough; but I think I can succeed with this. If I\ncannot, I must make another like it, so as to put one down each side of\nthe bullet. You see, this curve makes a sort of hook. The difficulty is\nto get it under the bullet.'\n\n\"'I understand,' he said. 'Do not mind hurting me. I have seen men die\nof bullets, even after the wound seemed to heal. I know it is better to\ntry and get it out.'\n\n\"It was a difficult job. Pressing back the flesh with my finger, I\nsucceeded, at last, in getting the hook under the bullet. This I held\nfirmly against it, and to my delight felt, as I raised finger and hook\ntogether, that the bullet was coming. A few seconds later, I held it\ntriumphantly between my fingers.\n\n\"'There, Saleh, there is your enemy. I think, now, that if there is no\ninflammation, it will not be long before you are well and strong\nagain.'\n\n\"'Truly, it is wonderful!' the man said, gratefully. 'I have heard of\nhakims who are able to draw bullets from wounds, but I have never seen\nit done before.'\n\n\"If Saleh had been a white man, I should still have felt doubtful as to\nhis recovery; but I was perfectly confident that a wound of that sort\nwould heal well, in an Arab, especially as it would be kept cool and\nclean. Hard exercise, life in the open air, entire absence of\nstimulating liquors, and only very occasionally, if ever, meat diet,\nrender them almost insensible to wounds that would paralyse a white.\nOur surgeons had been astonished at the rapidity with which the wounded\nprisoners recovered.\n\n\"Saleh's wife had stood by, as if carved in stone, while I performed\nthe operation; but when I produced the bullet, she burst into tears,\nand poured blessings on my head.\n\n\"I am writing this on the following morning. Saleh has slept quietly\nall night. His hand is cool this morning, and I think I may fairly say\nthat he is convalescent. Abdullah's wife came in yesterday evening, and\ntold the women here that her husband was asleep, but that he would come\nround in the morning. I warned her not to let him stir out of doors,\nand said I would come and see him.\n\n\"It has taken me five hours to write this, which seems a very long time\nto spend on details of things not worth recording; but the act of\nwriting has taken my thoughts off myself, and I intend always to note\ndown anything special. It will be interesting to me to read it, if I\never get away; should I be unable to escape, I shall charge Saleh to\ncarry it to Khartoum, if he ever has the chance, and hand it over to\nthe Governor there, to send down to Cairo.\n\n\"A week later. I am already losing count of days, but days matter\nnothing. I have been busy, so busy that I have not even had time to\nwrite. After I had finished my story so far, Saleh's slave woman took\nme to Abdullah's house. I found that he was in a state of high fever,\nbut all I could do was to recommend that a wet rag should be applied,\nand freshly wetted every quarter of an hour; that his head should be\nkept similarly enveloped, in wet bandages; and that his hands should be\ndipped in water very frequently.\n\n\"When I got back, I found several women waiting outside Saleh's house.\nHis wife had gossiped with a neighbour, and told them that I had got\nthe bullet out of his wound. The news spread rapidly, and these women\nwere all there to beg that I would see their husbands.\n\n\"This was awkward. I certainly could not calculate upon being\nsuccessful, in cases where a bullet had penetrated more deeply; and\neven if I could do so, I should at once excite the hostility of the\nnative hakims, and draw very much more attention upon myself than I\ndesired. In vain I protested that I was not a hakim, and had done only\nwhat I had seen a white hakim do. Finding that this did not avail, I\nsaid that I would not go to see any man, except with one of the native\ndoctors.\n\n\"'There are two here,' one of the women said. 'I will go and fetch\nthem.'\n\n\"'No,' I said; 'who am I, that they should come to me? I will go and\nsee them, if you will show me where they live.'\n\n\"'Ah, here they come!' she said, as two Dervishes approached.\n\n\"I went up to them, and they said: 'We hear that you are a hakim, who\nhas done great things.'\n\n\"'I am no hakim,' I said. 'I was just coming to you, to tell you so.\nThe man I aided was a friend, and was not deeply wounded. Having seen a\nwhite hakim take bullets from wounded men, I tried my best; and as the\nbullet was but a short way in, I succeeded. If I had had the\ninstruments I saw the infidel use, it would have been easy; but I had\nto make an instrument, which sufficed for the purpose, although it\nwould have been of no use, had the bullet gone in deeper.'\n\n\"They came in and examined Saleh's wound, the bullet, and the tool I\nhad made.\n\n\"'It is well,' they said. 'You have profited by what you saw. Whence do\nyou come?'\n\n\"I told the same story that I had told Saleh.\n\n\"'You have been some time at Khartoum?'\n\n\"'Not very long,' I said; 'but I went down once to Cairo, and was there\nsome years. It was there I came to know something of the ways of the\ninfidels. I am a poor man, and very ignorant; but if you will allow me\nI will act as your assistant, as I know that there are many wounded\nhere. If you will tell me what to do, I will follow your instructions\ncarefully.'\n\n\"The two hakims looked more satisfied, at finding that I was not a\ndangerous rival. One said:\n\n\"'Among the things that have been brought in here is a box. Those who\nbrought it did not know what it contained, and it was too strong for\nthem to open, though of course they were able to hammer it, and break\nit open. It contained nothing but many shining instruments, but the\nonly one that we knew the purport of was a saw. There were two boxes of\nthe same shape, and the other contained a number of little bottles of\ndrugs; and we thought that maybe, as the boxes were alike, these\nshining instruments were used by the white hakim.'\n\n\"'I can tell you that, if I see them,' I said, and went with them.\n\n\"In a house where booty of all sorts was stored, I saw the chests which\nI knew were those carried by Hicks's medical officer. The one contained\ndrugs, the other a variety of surgical instruments--probes, forceps,\namputating knives, and many other instruments of whose use I was\nignorant. I picked out three or four probes, and forceps of different\nshapes.\n\n\"'These are the instruments,' I said, 'with which they take out\nbullets. With one of these thin instruments, they search the wound\nuntil they find the ball. Sometimes they cannot find it, and even when\nthey have found it, they sometimes cannot get hold of it with any of\nthese tools, which, as you see, open and shut.'\n\n\"'What are the knives for?'\n\n\"'They use the knives for cutting off limbs. Twice have I seen this\ndone, for I was travelling with a learned hakim, who was searching the\ntombs for relics. In one case a great stone fell on a man's foot, and\nsmashed it, and the hakim took it off at the ankle. In another case a\nman had been badly wounded, by a bullet in the arm. He was not one of\nour party but, hearing of the hakim's skill, he had made a journey of\nthree days to him. The wound was very bad, and they said it was too\nlate to save the arm, so they cut it off above the elbow.'\n\n\"'And they lived?'\n\n\"'Yes, they both lived.'\n\n\"'Could you do that?'\n\n\"I shook my head. 'It requires much skill,' I said. 'I saw how it was\ndone, but to do it one's self is very different. If there was a man who\nmust die, if an arm or a leg were not taken off, I would try to save\nhis life; but I would not try, unless it was clear that the man must\ndie if it were not done.\n\n\"But you are learned men, hakims, and if you will take me as your\nassistant, I will show you how the white doctors take out balls, and,\nif there is no other way, cut off limbs; and when I have once shown\nyou, you will do it far better than I.'\n\n\"The two men seemed much pleased. It was evident to them that, if they\ncould do these things, it would widely add to their reputation.\n\n\"'It is good,' they said. 'You shall go round with us, and see the\nwounded, and we will see for ourselves what you can do. Will you want\nthis chest carried?'\n\n\"'No,' I said. 'I will take these instruments with me. Should it be\nnecessary to cut off a limb, to try and save life, I shall need the\nknives, the saw, and this instrument, which I heard the white hakim\ncall a tourniquet, and which they use for stopping the flow of blood,\nwhile they are cutting. There are other instruments, too, that will be\nrequired.'\"\n\n\n\nChapter 18: A Hakim.\n\n\n\"I succeeded in getting out two more bullets, and then handed the\ninstruments to the hakims, saying that I had shown them all I knew, and\nwould now leave the matter in their hands altogether; or would act as\ntheir assistant, if they wished it. I had no fear that harm would come\nof it; for, being so frequently engaged in war, I knew that they had,\nin a rough way, considerable skill in the treatment of wounds. I had\nimpressed upon them, while probing the wounds, that no force must be\nused, and that the sole object was to find the exact course the ball\nhad taken.\n\n\"As to the amputations, they would probably not be attempted. A\nfighting Dervish would rather die than lose a limb; and, were he to die\nunder an operation, his relatives would accuse the operator of having\nkilled him.\n\n\"I remained at work with them, for two or three days. In nearly half\nthe cases, they failed to find the course of the ball; but when they\ndid so, and the wound was not too deep, they generally succeeded in\nextracting it. They were highly pleased, and I took great pains to\nremain well in the background.\n\n\"They were very friendly with me. Their fees were mostly horses, or\ncarpets, or other articles, in accordance with the means of the\npatients; and of these they gave me a portion, together with some\nmoney, which had been looted from the chests carrying silver, for the\npurchase of provisions and the payment of troops. Although they made a\npretence of begging me to remain always with them, I refused, saying\nthat I saw I could no longer be of assistance to them. I could see they\nwere inwardly pleased. They gave me some more money, and I left them,\nsaying that I did not, for a moment, suppose that I could tell them\nanything further; but that if, at any time, they should send for me, I\nwould try and recall what I had seen the white hakims do, in such a\ncase as they were dealing with.\n\n\"In the meantime, Saleh was progressing very favourably; and, indeed,\nwould have been up and about, had I not peremptorily ordered him to\nremain quiet.\n\n\"'You are doing well,' I said. 'Why should you risk bringing on\ninflammation, merely for the sake of getting about a few days earlier?'\n\n\"Abdullah was also better, but still extremely weak, and I had to order\nthat meat should be boiled for some hours, and that he should drink\nsmall quantities of the broth, three or four times a day. Many times a\nday women came to me, to ask me to see to their husbands' wounds; and\nsometimes the wounded men came to me, themselves. All the serious cases\nI referred to the hakims, and confined myself simply to dressing and\nbandaging wounds, which had grown angry for want of attention. I always\nrefused to accept fees, insisting that I was not a hakim, and simply\nafforded my help as a friend.\n\n\"I had the satisfaction, however, of doing a great deal of good, for in\nthe medicine chest I found a large supply of plaster and bandages.\nFrequently mothers brought children to me. These I could have treated\nwith some of the simple drugs in the chest, but I refused to do so; for\nI could not have explained, in any satisfactory way, how I knew one\ndrug from another, or was acquainted with their qualities. Still,\nalthough I refused fees, I had many little presents of fowls, fruit,\npumpkins, and other things. These prevented my feeling that I was a\nburden upon Saleh, for of course I put them into the general stock.\n\n\"So far, I cannot but look back with deep gratitude for the strange\nmanner in which I have been enabled to avert all suspicion, and even to\nmake myself quite a popular character among the people of El Obeid.\n\n\"One bottle I found in the medicine chest was a great prize to me. It\ncontained iodine and, with a weak solution of this, I was able to\nmaintain my colour. I did not care so much for my face and hands, for I\nwas so darkened by the sun that my complexion was little fairer than\nthat of many of the Arabs. But I feared that an accidental display, of\na portion of my body usually covered by my garments, would at once\nprove that I was a white man. I had used up the stuff that I had\nbrought with me, when I escaped from the square; and having no means of\nprocuring fresh stain, was getting uneasy; but this discovery of the\niodine put it within my power to renew my colouring, whenever it was\nnecessary.\n\n\"About a month later. I have been living here quietly, since I last\nwrote in this journal. The day after I had done so, the Emir sent for\nme, and said he had heard that I had taken bullets out of wounds, and\nhad shown the two doctors of the town how to do so, by means of\ninstruments found in a chest that was among the loot brought in from\nthe battlefield. I repeated my story to him, as to how I had acquired\nthe knowledge from being in the service of a white hakim, from Cairo,\nwho was travelling in the desert; and that I had no other medical\nknowledge, except that I had seen, in the chest, a bottle which\ncontained stuff like that the white doctors used in order to put a\npatient to sleep, so that they could take off a limb without his\nfeeling pain.\n\n\"'I have heard of such things being done by the Turkish hakims at\nKhartoum, but I did not believe them. It is against all reason.'\n\n\"'I have seen it done, my lord,' I said. 'I do not say that I could\ntake off a limb, as they did, but I am sure that the stuff would put\nanyone to sleep.'\n\n\"'I wish you to put it to the trial,' the Emir said. 'One of my sons\ncame back, from the battle, with a bullet hole through his hand. The\nhakim said that two of the bones were broken. He put bandages round,\nand my son said no more about it. He is a man who does not complain of\nslight troubles, but yesterday evening the pain became so great that he\nwas forced to mention it; and when I examined his arm, I found that it\nwas greatly swelled. Slaves have been bathing it with cold water, ever\nsince, but the pain has increased rather than diminished.'\n\n\"'I will look at it, my lord, but I greatly fear that it is beyond my\npoor skill to deal with it.'\n\n\"The young man was brought in and, on removing the bandage, I saw that\nthe wound was in a terrible state, and the arm greatly inflamed, some\ndistance up the wrist. It was a bad case, and it seemed to me that,\nunless something was done, mortification would speedily set in.\n\n\"'The two doctors saw it an hour ago,' the Emir went on, 'and they\ngreatly fear for his life. They told me that they could do nothing, but\nthat, as you had seen the white hakim do wonderful things, you might be\nable to do something.'\n\n\"'My lord,' I said, 'it is one thing to watch an operation, but quite\nanother to perform it yourself. I think, as the doctors have told you,\nyour son's life is in great danger; and I do believe that, if there\nwere white doctors here to take off his arm, he might be saved. But I\ncould not undertake it. The skill to do so is only acquired by long\nyears of study. How can I, a poor man, know how to do such things? Were\nI to attempt and fail, what would you say?--that I had killed your son;\nand that, but for me, he might have recovered.'\n\n\"'He will not recover,' the Emir said, moodily.\n\n\"'What say you, Abu? You have heard what this man says; what do you\nthink?'\n\n\"'I think, Father, that it were well to try. This man has used his\neyes, so well, that he has taken the white man's instruments, and drawn\nout bullets from wounds. I feel as if this wound will kill me;\ntherefore, if the man fails, I shall be none the worse. Indeed, it\nwould be better to die at once, than to feel this fire burning, till it\nburns me up.'\n\n\"'You hear what my son says? I am of the same opinion. Do your best.\nShould you fail, I swear, by the head of the Prophet, that no harm\nshall come to you.'\n\n\"The wounded man was a fine young fellow, of three or four and twenty.\n\n\"'If it is my lord's will, I will try,' I said; 'but I pray you to bear\nin mind that I do so at your command, and without much hope of\naccomplishing it successfully. It would, I think, be advisable that the\nlimb should be taken off above the elbow, so that it will be above the\nspot to which the inflammation has extended.'\n\n\"The Emir looked at his son, who said:\n\n\"'It matters not, Father. 'Tis but my left arm, and I shall still have\nmy right, to hurl a spear or wield a sword.'\n\n\"I need not tell how I got through the operation. Everything required\nfor it--the inhaler, sponges, straight and crooked needles, and\nthread--was in the chest. The young Arab objected to be sent to sleep.\nHe said it might be well for cowards, but not for a fighting man. I had\nto assure him that it was not for his sake, but for my own, that I\nwished him to go to sleep; and that if I knew he was not suffering\npain, I might be able to do the thing without my hand trembling; but\nthat if I knew he was suffering, I should be flurried.\n\n\"I insisted that the hakims should be sent for. When they came I called\nthem to witness that, at the Emir's command, I was going to try to do\nthe operation I had seen the white doctor perform, although I was but\nan ignorant man, and feared greatly that I might fail. I really was\ndesperately nervous, though at the same time I did feel that, having\nseen the operation performed two or three times, and as it was a simple\none, I ought to be able to do it. Of course, I had everything laid\nhandy. The tourniquet was first put on the arm, and screwed tightly.\nThen I administered the chloroform, which took its effect speedily. My\nnerves were braced up now, and I do think I made a fair job of\nit--finding and tying up the arteries, cutting and sawing the bone off,\nand making a flap. A few stitches to keep this together, and it was\ndone, and to my relief the Arab, who had lain as rigid as a statue,\nwinced a little when the last stitch was put in.\n\n\"This was the point on which I had been most anxious. I was not sure\nwhether the amount of chloroform he had inhaled might not have been too\nstrong for him.\n\n\"'Do not try to move,' I said, as he opened his eyes and looked round,\nas if trying to remember where he was.\n\n\"As his eyes fell upon me, he said, 'When are you going to begin?'\n\n\"'I have finished,' I said, 'but you must lie quiet, for some time. The\nslightest movement now might cause the flow of blood to burst out.'\n\n\"The Emir had stood staring at his son's quiet face, as if amazed\nbeyond the power of speech. Four Dervishes had held the patient's\nlimbs, so as to prevent any accidental movement. A female slave had\nheld a large basin of warm water, and another handed me the things I\npointed to. I had begged the hakims to keep their attention fixed on\nwhat I was doing, in order that these also might see how the white\ndoctor did such things.\n\n\"When his son spoke, the Emir gave a gasp of relief. 'He lives,' he\nmurmured, as if even now he could scarcely believe that this was\npossible; and as he put his hand upon my shoulder it trembled with\nemotion.\n\n\"'Truly the ways of the white infidels are marvellous. Abu, my son,\nAllah has been merciful! He must have meant that you should not die,\nand thus have sent this man, who has seen the white hakims at work, to\nsave your life!\n\n\"What is to be done now?' he went on, turning to me.\n\n\"'He should be raised very gently, and clothes put under his shoulder\nand head. Then he should be carried, on the angareb, to the coolest\nplace in the house. He may drink a little juice of fruit, but he had\nbest eat nothing. The great thing is to prevent fever coming on. With\nyour permission I will stay with him, for if one of the threads you saw\nme tie, round these little white tubes in the arm, should slip or give\nway, he would be dead in five minutes; unless this machine round the\narm is tightened at once, and the tube that carries the blood is tied\nup. It would be well that he should have a slave to fan him. I hope he\nwill sleep.'\n\n\"The Emir gave orders for the bed to be carried to the room adjoining\nhis harem.\n\n\"'His mother and his young wife will want to see him,' he said to me,\n'and when the danger that you speak of is past, the women will care for\nhim. You will be master in the room, and will give such orders as you\nplease.'\n\n\"Then he turned off, and walked hastily away. I could see that he had\nspoken with difficulty, and that, in spite of his efforts to appear\ncomposed and tranquil, his mouth was twitching, and his eyes moist.\n\n\"As soon as the bed had been placed, by my directions, near the open\nwindow, the four Dervishes left the room. The hakims were on the point\nof doing so, when I said:\n\n\"'I will stay here for a few minutes, and will then come out and talk\nthis matter over with you. I have been fortunate, indeed, in\nremembering so well what I saw. I heard a white hakim explain how he\ndid each thing, and why, to the sheik of the wounded man's party; and I\nwill tell you what I remember of it, and you, with your wisdom in these\nmatters, will be able to do it far better than I.'\n\n\"When they had retired, the door leading into the harem opened, and a\nwoman, slightly veiled, followed by a younger woman and two slave\ngirls, came in. I stopped her, as she was hurrying towards her son.\n\n\"'Lady,' I said, 'I pray you to speak very quietly, and in few words.\nIt is most important that he should not be excited, in any way, but\nshould be kept perfectly quiet, for the next two or three days.'\n\n\"'I will do so,' she said. 'May I touch him?'\n\n\"'You may take his hand in yours, but do not let him move. I will leave\nyou with him for a few minutes. Please remember that everything depends\nupon his not being agitated.'\n\n\"I went out and joined the hakims.\n\n\"'Truly, Mudil, Allah has given you strange gifts,' one of them said.\n'Wonderful is it that you should have remembered so well what you saw;\nand more wonderful still is it, that you should have the firmness to\ncut and saw flesh and bone, as if they were those of a dead sheep, with\nthe Emir standing by to look at you!'\n\n\"'I knew that his life, and perhaps mine, depended upon it. The Emir\nwould have kept his oath, I doubt not; but when it became known in the\ntown that Abu, who is known to all for his bravery and goodness, died\nin my hands, it would not have been safe for me to leave this house.'\n\n\"I then explained the reason for each step that I took. They listened\nmost attentively, and asked several questions, showing that they were\nintensely interested, and most anxious to be able to perform so\nwonderful an operation themselves. They were greatly surprised at the\nfact that so little blood flowed.\n\n\"'It seems,' I said, 'from what I heard the white hakim say, that the\nblood flowed through those little white tubes. By twisting the\ntourniquet very tight, that flow of blood is stopped. The great thing\nis to find those little tubes, and tie them up. As you would notice,\nthe large ones in the inside of the arm could be seen quite plainly.\nWhen they cannot be seen, the screw is unloosed so as to allow a small\nquantity of blood to flow, which shows you where the tubes are. You\nwill remember that I took hold of each, with the bent point of a small\nwire or a pair of these nippers; and, while you held it, tied the\nthread tightly round it. When that is done, one is ready to cut the\nbone. You saw me push the flesh back, so as to cut the bone as high up\nas possible; that is because the white doctor said the flesh would\nshrink up, and the bone would project. I cut the flesh straight on one\nside, and on the other with a flap that will, when it is stitched,\ncover over the bone and the rest of the flesh, and make what the hakim\ncalled a pad. He said all cutting off of limbs was done in this way,\nbut of course the tubes would not lie in the same place, and the\ncutting would have to be made differently; but it was all the same\nsystem. He called these simple operations, and said that anyone with a\nfirm hand, and a knowledge of where these tubes lie, ought to be able\nto do it, after seeing it done once or twice. He said, of course, it\nwould not be so neatly done as by men who had been trained to it; but\nthat, in cases of extreme necessity, anyone who had seen it done once\nor twice, and had sufficient nerve, could do it; especially if they\nhad, ready at hand, this stuff that makes the wounded man sleep and\nfeel no pain.\n\n\"'I listened very attentively, because all seemed to me almost like\nmagic, but I certainly did not think that I should ever have to do such\na thing, myself.'\n\n\"'But what would be done if they had not that sleep medicine?'\n\n\"'The hakim said that, in that case, the wounded man would have to be\nfastened down by bandages to the bed, and held by six strong men, so\nthat he could not move in the slightest. However, there is enough of\nthat stuff to last a hundred times or more; for, as you see, only a\ngood-sized spoonful was used.'\n\n\"The Emir, who had passed through the harem rooms, now opened the door.\n\n\"'Come in,' he said. 'My son is quiet, and has not moved. He has spoken\nto his mother, and seems quite sensible. Is there anything more for you\nto do to him?'\n\n\"'I will put a bandage loosely round his arm, and bind it to his body\nso that he cannot move it in his sleep, or on first waking. It will not\nbe necessary for me to stay with him, as the ladies of the harem can\nlook after him; but I must remain in the next room, so as to be ready\nto run in, at once, should they see that the wound is bleeding again. I\nhave asked the hakims to make a soothing potion, to aid him to sleep\nlong and soundly.'\n\n\"As I went up to the side of the bed, Abu smiled. I bent down to him,\nand he said in a low voice:\n\n\"'All the pain has gone. May Allah bless you!'\n\n\"'I am afraid that you will feel more pain, tomorrow, but I do not\nthink it will be so bad as it was before. Now, I hope you will try to\ngo to sleep. You will be well looked after, and I shall be in the next\nroom, if you want me. The hakims will give you a soothing draught soon,\nand you can have cool drinks when you want them.'\n\n\"Things went on as well as I could have wished. In four or five days\nthe threads came away, and I loosened the tourniquet slightly, and\nstrapped up the edges of the wound, which were already showing signs of\nhealing. For the first twenty-four hours I had remained always on\nwatch; after that the hakims took their turns, I remaining in readiness\nto tighten up the tourniquet, should there be any rush of blood. I did\nnot leave the Emir's house, but slept in a room close by that of the\npatient.\n\n\"There was now, however, no longer need for my doing so. The splendid\nconstitution of the young Baggara had, indeed, from the first rendered\nany attendance unnecessary. There was no fever, and very little local\ninflammation; and I was able to gladden his heart by telling him that,\nin another fortnight, he would be able to be up.\n\n\"The day I was intending to leave, the Emir sent for me. He was alone.\n\n\"'The more I think over this matter,' he said, 'the more strange it is\nthat you should be able to do all these wonderful things, after having\nseen it done once by the white hakim. The more I think of it, the more\ncertain I feel that you are not what you seem. I have sent for Saleh\nand Abdullah. They have told me what you did for them, and that you\ngave up your horse to them, and dressed their wounds, and brought them\nin here. They are full of praise of your goodness, and but few of my\npeople would have thus acted, for strangers. They would have given them\na drink of water, and ridden on.\n\n\"Now, tell me frankly and without fear. I have thought it over, and I\nfeel sure that you, yourself, are a white hakim, who escaped from the\nbattle in which Hicks's army was destroyed.'\n\n\"'I am not a hakim. All that I said was true--that although I have seen\noperations performed, I have never performed them myself. As to the\nrest, I answer you frankly, I am an Englishman. I did escape when the\nblack Soudanese battalion surrendered, three days after the battle. I\nwas not a fighting officer. I was with them as interpreter. I may say\nthat, though I am not a hakim, I did for some time study with the\nintention of becoming one, and so saw many operations performed.'\n\n\"'I am glad that you told me,' the Emir said gravely. 'Your people are\nbrave and very wise, though they cannot stand against the power of the\nMahdi. But were you Sheitan himself, it would be nothing to me. You\nhave saved my son's life. You are the honoured guest of my house. Your\nreligion is different from mine, but as you showed that you were\nwilling to aid followers of the Prophet and the Mahdi, although they\nwere your enemies, surely I, for whom you have done so much, may well\nforget that difference.'\n\n\"'I thank you, Emir. From what I had seen of you, I felt sure that my\nsecret would be safe with you. We Christians feel no enmity against\nfollowers of Mahomet--the hatred is all on your side. And yet, 'tis\nstrange, the Allah that you worship, and the God of the Christians, is\none and the same. Mahomet himself had no enmity against the Christians,\nand regarded our Christ as a great prophet, like himself.\n\n\"Our Queen reigns, in India, over many more Mohamedans than are ruled\nby the Sultan of Turkey. They are loyal to her, and know that under her\nsway no difference is made between them and her Christian subjects, and\nhave fought as bravely for her as her own white troops.'\n\n\"'I had never thought,' the Emir said, 'that the time would come when I\nshould call an infidel my friend; but now that I can do so, I feel that\nthere is much in what you say. However, your secret must be kept. Were\nit known that you are a white man, you would be torn to pieces in the\nstreets; and even were you to remain here, where assuredly none would\ndare touch you, the news would speedily travel to my lord the Mahdi,\nand he would send a troop of horse to bring you to him. Therefore,\nthough I would fain honour you, I see that it is best that you should,\nto all save myself, continue to be Mudil. I will not even, as I would\notherwise have done, assign you a house, and slaves, and horses in\ntoken of my gratitude to you for having saved the life of my son.\n\n\"'Something I must do, or I should seem utterly ungrateful. I can, at\nany rate, give you rooms here, and treat you as an honoured guest. This\nwould excite no remark, as it would be naturally expected that you\nwould stay here until my son is perfectly cured. I shall tell no one,\nnot even my wife; but Abu I will tell, when he is cured, and the secret\nwill be as safe with him as with me. I think it would please him to\nknow. Although a Baggara like myself, and as brave as any, he is\nstrangely gentle in disposition; and though ready and eager to fight,\nwhen attacked by other tribes, he does not care to go on expeditions\nagainst villages which have not acknowledged the power of the Mahdi,\nand makes every excuse to avoid doing so. It will please him to know\nthat the man who has saved his life is one who, although of a different\nrace and religion, is willing to do kindness to an enemy; and will love\nand honour you more, for knowing it.'\n\n\"'I thank you deeply, Emir, and anything that I can do for members of\nyour family, I shall be glad to do. I have a knowledge of the usages of\nmany of the drugs in the chest that was brought here. I have not dared\nto say so before, because I could not have accounted for knowing such\nthings.'\n\n\"So at present I am installed in the Emir's palace, and my prospects\ngrow brighter and brighter. After the great victory the Mahdi has won,\nit is likely that he will be emboldened to advance against Khartoum. In\nthat case he will, no doubt, summon his followers from all parts, and I\nshall be able to ride with the Emir or his son; and it will be hard if,\nwhen we get near the city, I cannot find some opportunity of slipping\noff and making my way there. Whether it will be prudent to do so is\nanother question, for I doubt whether the Egyptian troops there will\noffer any resolute resistance to the Dervish hosts; and in that case, I\nshould have to endeavour to make my way down to Dongola, and from there\neither by boat or by the river bank to Assouan.\n\n\"A month later. I have not written for some time, because there has\nbeen nothing special to put down. All the little details of the life\nhere can be told to my dear wife, if I should ever see her again; but\nthey are not of sufficient interest to write down. I have been living\nat the Emir's house, ever since. I do not know what special office I am\nsupposed to occupy in his household--that is, what office the people in\ngeneral think that I hold. In fact, I am his guest, and an honoured\none. When he goes out I ride beside him and Abu, who has now\nsufficiently recovered to sit his horse. I consider myself as medical\nattendant, in ordinary, to him and his family. I have given up all\npractice in the town--in the first place because I do not wish to make\nenemies of the two doctors, who really seem very good fellows, and I am\nglad to find that they have performed two or three operations\nsuccessfully; and in the second place, were I to go about trying to\ncure the sick, people would get so interested in me that I should be\ncontinually questioned as to how I attained my marvellous skill.\nHappily, though no doubt they must have felt somewhat jealous at my\nsuccess with Abu, I have been able to do the hakims some service, put\nfees into their pockets, and at the same time benefited poor people\nhere. I have told them that, just as I recognized the bottle of\nchloroform, so I have recognized some of the bottles from which the\nwhite hakims used to give powder to sick people.\n\n\"'For instance,' I said, 'you see this bottle, which is of a different\nshape from the others. It is full of a white, feathery-looking powder.\nThey used to give this to people suffering from fever--about as much as\nyou could put on your nail for men and women, and half as much for\nchildren. They used to put it in a little water, and stir it up, and\ngive it to them night and morning. They call it kena, or something like\nthat. It did a great deal of good, and generally drove away the fever.\n\n\"'This other bottle they also used a good deal. They put a little of\nits contents in water, and it made a lotion for weak and sore eyes.\nThey called it zing. They saw I was a careful man, and I often made the\neye wash, and put the other white powder up into little packets when\nthey were busy, as fever and ophthalmia are the two most common\ncomplaints among the natives.'\n\n\"The hakims were immensely pleased, and both told me, afterwards, that\nboth these medicines had done wonders. I told them that I thought there\nwere some more bottles of these medicines in the chest, and that when\nthey had finished those I had now given them, I would look out for the\nothers. I had, in fact, carried off a bottle both of quinine and zinc\npowder for my own use, and with the latter I greatly benefited several\nof the Emir's children and grandchildren, all of whom were suffering\nfrom ophthalmia; or from sore eyes, that would speedily have developed\nthat disease, if they had not been attended to.\n\n\"I had only performed one operation, which was essentially a minor one.\nAbu told me that his wife, of whom he was very fond, was suffering very\ngreat pain from a tooth--could I cure her?\n\n\"I said that, without seeing the tooth, I could not do anything, and he\nat once said:\n\n\"'As it is for her good, Mudil, I will bring her into this room, and\nshe shall unveil so that you can examine the tooth.'\n\n\"She was quite a girl, and for an Arab very good looking. She and the\nEmir's wife were continually sending me out choice bits from their\ndinner, but I had not before seen her face. She was evidently a good\ndeal confused, at thus unveiling before a man, but Abu said:\n\n\"'It is with my permission that you unveil, therefore there can be no\nharm in it. Besides, has not Mudil saved my life, and so become my\nbrother?'\n\n\"He opened her mouth. The tooth was far back and broken, and the gum\nwas greatly swelled.\n\n\"'It is very bad,' I said to Abu. 'It would hurt her terribly, if I\nwere to try and take it out; but if she will take the sleeping medicine\nI gave you, I think that I could do it.'\n\n\"'Then she shall take it,' he said at once. 'It is not unpleasant. On\nthe contrary, I dreamt a pleasant dream while you were taking off my\narm. Please do it, at once.'\n\n\"I at once fetched the chloroform, the inhaler, and a pair of forceps\nwhich looked well suited for the purpose, and probably were intended\nfor it. I then told her to lie down on the angareb, which I placed\nclose to the window.\n\n\"'Now, Abu,' I said, 'directly she has gone off to sleep, you must\nforce her mouth open, and put the handle of your dagger between her\nteeth. It will not hurt her at all. But I cannot get at the tooth\nunless the mouth is open, and we cannot open it until she is asleep,\nfor the whole side of her face is swollen, and the jaw almost stiff.'\n\n\"The chloroform took effect very quickly. Her husband had some\ndifficulty in forcing the mouth open. When he had once done so, I took\na firm hold of the tooth, and wrenched it out.\n\n\"'You can withdraw the dagger,' I said, 'and then lift her up, and let\nher rinse her mouth well with the warm water I brought in. She will\nhave little pain afterwards, though of course it will take some little\ntime, before the swelling goes down.'\n\n\"Then I went out, and left them together. In a few minutes, Abu came\nout.\n\n\"'She has no pain,' he said. 'She could hardly believe, when she came\nround, that the tooth was out. It is a relief, indeed. She has cried,\nday and night, for the past three days.'\n\n\"'Tell her that, for the rest of the day, she had better keep quiet;\nand go to sleep if possible, which I have no doubt she will do, as she\nmust be worn out with the pain she has been suffering.'\n\n\"'I begin to see, Mudil, that we are very ignorant. We can fight, but\nthat is all we are good for. How much better it would be if, instead of\nregarding you white men as enemies, we could get some of you to live\nhere, and teach us the wonderful things that you know!'\n\n\"'Truly it would be better,' I said. 'It all depends upon yourselves.\nYou have a great country. If you would but treat the poor people here\nwell, and live in peace with other tribes; and send word down to Cairo\nthat you desire, above all things, white hakims and others who would\nteach you, to come up and settle among you, assuredly they would come.\nThere are thousands of white men and women working in India, and China,\nand other countries, content to do good, not looking for high pay, but\ncontent to live poorly. The difficulty is not in getting men willing to\nheal and to teach, but to persuade those whom they would benefit to\nallow them to do the work.'\n\n\"Abu shook his head.\n\n\"'That is it,' he said. 'I would rather be able to do such things as\nyou do, than be one of the most famous soldiers of the Mahdi; but I\ncould never persuade others. They say that the Mahdi himself, although\nhe is hostile to the Turks, and would conquer Egypt, would willingly\nbefriend white men. But even he, powerful as he is, cannot go against\nthe feelings of his emirs. Must we always be ignorant? Must we always\nbe fighting? I can see no way out of it. Can you, Mudil?'\n\n\"'I can see but one way,' I said, 'and that may seem to you impossible,\nbecause you know nothing of the strength of England. We have, as you\nknow, easily beaten the Egyptian Army; and we are now protectors of\nEgypt. If you invade that country, as the Mahdi has already threatened\nto do, it is we who will defend it; and if there is no other way of\nobtaining peace, we shall some day send an army to recover the Soudan.\nYou will fight, and you will fight desperately, but you have no idea of\nthe force that will advance against you. You know how Osman Digna's\ntribes on the Red Sea have been defeated, not by the superior courage\nof our men, but by our superior arms. And so it will be here. It may be\nmany years before it comes about, but if you insist on war, that is\nwhat will come.\n\n\"'Then, when we have taken the Soudan, there will come peace, and the\npeasant will till his soil in safety. Those who desire to be taught\nwill be taught; great canals from the Nile will irrigate the soil, and\nthe desert will become fruitful.'\n\n\"'You really think that would come of it?' Abu asked, earnestly.\n\n\"'I do indeed, Abu. We have conquered many brave peoples, far more\nnumerous than yours; and those who were our bitterest enemies now see\nhow they have benefited by it. Certainly, England would not undertake\nthe cost of such an expedition lightly; but if she is driven to it by\nyour advance against Egypt, she will assuredly do so. Your people--I\nmean the Baggaras and their allies--would suffer terribly; but the\npeople whom you have conquered, whose villages you have burned, whose\nwomen you have carried off, would rejoice.'\n\n\"'We would fight,' Abu said passionately.\n\n\"'Certainly you would fight, and fight gallantly, but it would not\navail you. Besides, Abu, you would be fighting for that ignorance you\nhave just regretted, and against the teaching and progress you have\nwished for.'\n\n\"'It is hard,' Abu said, quietly.\n\n\"'It is hard, but it has been the fate of all people who have resisted\nthe advance of knowledge and civilization. Those who accept\ncivilization, as the people of India--of whom there are many more than\nin all Africa--have accepted it, are prosperous. In America and other\ngreat countries, far beyond the seas, the native Indians opposed it,\nbut in vain; and now a great white race inhabit the land, and there is\nbut a handful left of those who opposed them.'\n\n\"'These things are hard to understand. If, as you say, your people come\nhere some day to fight against us, I shall fight. If my people are\ndefeated, and I am still alive, I shall say it is the will of Allah;\nlet us make the best of it, and try to learn to be like those who have\nconquered us. I own to you that I am sick of bloodshed--not of blood\nshed in battle, but the blood of peaceful villagers; and though I\ngrieve for my own people, I should feel that it was for the good of the\nland that the white men had become the masters.'\"\n\n\n\nChapter 19: The Last Page.\n\n\n\"Khartoum, September 3rd, 1884.\n\n\"It is a long time since I made my last entry. I could put no date to\nit then, and till yesterday could hardly even have named the month. I\nam back again among friends, but I can hardly say that I am safer here\nthan I was at El Obeid. I have not written, because there was nothing\nto write. One day was like another, and as my paper was finished, and\nthere were no incidents in my life, I let the matter slide.\n\n\"Again and again I contemplated attempting to make my way to this town,\nbut the difficulties would be enormous. There were the dangers of the\ndesert, the absence of wells, the enormous probability of losing my\nway, and, most of all, the chance that, before I reached Khartoum, it\nwould have been captured. The Emir had been expecting news of its fall,\nfor months.\n\n\"There had been several fights, in some of which they had been\nvictorious. In others, even according to their own accounts, they had\nbeen worsted. Traitors in the town kept them well informed of the state\nof supplies. They declared that these were almost exhausted, and that\nthe garrison must surrender. Indeed, several of the commanders of\nbodies of troops had offered to surrender posts held by them.\n\n\"So I had put aside all hope of escape, and decided not to make any\nattempt until after Khartoum fell, when the Dervishes boasted they\nwould march down and conquer Egypt, to the sea.\n\n\"They had already taken Berber. Dongola was at their mercy. I thought\nthe best chance would be to go down with them, as far as they went, and\nthen to slip away. In this way I should shorten the journey I should\nhave to traverse alone; and, being on the river bank, could at least\nalways obtain water. Besides, I might possibly secure some small native\nboat, and with the help of the current get down to Assouan before the\nDervishes could arrive there. This I should have attempted; but, three\nweeks ago, an order came from the Mahdi to El Khatim, ordering him to\nsend to Omdurman five hundred well-armed men, who were to be commanded\nby his son Abu. Khatim was to remain at El Obeid, with the main body of\nhis force, until further orders.\n\n\"Abu came to me at once, with the news.\n\n\"'You will take me with you, Abu,' I exclaimed. 'This is the chance I\nhave been hoping for. Once within a day's journey of Khartoum, I could\nslip away at night, and it would be very hard if I could not manage to\ncross the Nile into Khartoum.'\n\n\"'I will take you, if you wish it,' he said. 'The danger will be very\ngreat, not in going with me, but in making your way into Khartoum.'\n\n\"'It does not seem to me that it would be so,' I said. 'I should strike\nthe river four or five miles above the town, cut a bundle of rushes,\nswim out to the middle of the river, drift down till I was close to the\ntown, and then swim across.'\n\n\"'So be it,' he said. 'It is your will, not mine.'\n\n\"Khatim came to me afterwards, and advised me to stay, but I said that\nit might be years before I had another chance to escape; and that,\nwhatever risk there was, I would prefer running it.\n\n\"'Then we shall see you no more,' he said, 'for Khartoum will assuredly\nfall, and you will be killed.'\n\n\"'If you were a prisoner in the hands of the white soldiers, Emir,' I\nsaid, 'I am sure that you would run any risk, if there was a chance of\ngetting home again. So it is with me. I have a wife and child, in\nCairo. Her heart must be sick with pain, at the thought of my death. I\nwill risk anything to get back as soon as possible. If I reach\nKhartoum, and it is afterwards captured, I can disguise myself and\nappear as I now am, hide for a while, and then find out where Abu is\nand join him again. But perhaps, when he sees that no further\nresistance can be made, General Gordon will embark on one of his\nsteamers and go down the river, knowing that it would be better for the\npeople of the town that the Mahdi should enter without opposition; in\nwhich case you would scarcely do harm to the peaceful portion of the\npopulation, or to the troops who had laid down their arms.'\n\n\"'Very well,' the Emir said. 'Abu has told me that he has tried to\ndissuade you, but that you will go. We owe you a great debt of\ngratitude, for all that you have done for us, and therefore I will not\ntry to dissuade you. I trust Allah will protect you.'\n\n\"And so we started the next morning. I rode by the side of Abu, and as\nall knew that I was the hakim who had taken off his arm, none wondered.\nThe journey was made without any incident worth recording. Abu did not\nhurry. We made a long march between each of the wells, and then halted\nfor a day. So we journeyed, until we made our last halt before arriving\nat Omdurman.\n\n\"'You are still determined to go?' Abu said to me.\n\n\"'I shall leave tonight, my friend.'\n\n\"'I shall not forget all that you have told me about your people,\nhakim. Should any white man fall into my hands, I will spare him for\nyour sake. These are evil times, and I regret all that has passed. I\nbelieve that the Mahdi is a prophet; but I fear that, in many things,\nhe has misunderstood the visions and orders he received. I see that\nevil rather than good has fallen upon the land, and that though we\nloved not the rule of the Egyptians, we were all better off under it\nthan we are now. We pass through ruined villages, and see the skeletons\nof many people. We know that where the waterwheels formerly spread the\nwater from the rivers over the fields, is now a desert; and that,\nexcept the fighting men, the people perish from hunger.\n\n\"'All this is bad. I see that, if we enter Egypt, we shall be like a\nflight of locusts. We shall eat up the country and leave a desert\nbehind us. Surely this cannot be according to the wishes of Allah, who\nis all merciful. You have taught me much in your talks with me, and I\ndo not see things as I used to. So much do I feel it, that in my heart\nI could almost wish that your countrymen should come here, and\nestablish peace and order.\n\n\"'The Mohamedans of India, you tell me, are well content with their\nrulers. Men may exercise their religion and their customs, without\nhindrance. They know that the strong cannot prey upon the weak, and\neach man reaps what he has sown, in peace. You tell me that India was\nlike the Soudan before you went there--that there were great\nconquerors, constant wars, and the peasants starved while the robbers\ngrew rich; and that, under your rule, peace and contentment were\nrestored. I would that it could be so here. But it seems, to me,\nimpossible that we should be conquered by people so far away.'\n\n\"'I hope that it will be so, Abu; and I think that if the great and\ngood white general, Governor Gordon, is murdered at Khartoum, the\npeople of my country will never rest until his death has been avenged.'\n\n\"'You had better take your horse,' he said. 'If you were to go on foot,\nit would be seen that there was a horse without a rider, and there\nwould be a search for you; but if you and your horse are missing, it\nwill be supposed that you have ridden on to Omdurman to give notice of\nour coming, and none will think more of the matter.'\n\n\"As soon as the camp was asleep, I said goodbye to Abu; and took my\nhorse by the reins and led him into the desert, half a mile away. Then\nI mounted, and rode fast. The stars were guide enough, and in three\nhours I reached the Nile. I took off the horse's saddle and bridle, and\nleft him to himself. Then I crept out and cut a bundle of rushes, and\nswam into the stream with them.\n\n\"After floating down the river for an hour, I saw the light of a few\nfires on the right bank, and guessed that this was a Dervish force,\nbeleaguering Khartoum from that side. I drifted on for another hour,\ndrawing closer and closer to the shore, until I could see walls and\nforts; then I stripped off my Dervish frock, and swam ashore.\n\n\"I had, during the time we had been on the journey, abstained from\nstaining my skin under my garments, in order that I might be recognized\nas a white man, as soon as I bared my arms.\n\n\"I lay down till it was broad daylight, and then walked up to the foot\nof a redoubt. There were shouts of surprise from the black soldiers\nthere, as I approached. I shouted to them, in Arabic, that I was an\nEnglishman; and two or three of them at once ran down the slope, and\naided me to climb it. I was taken, at my request, to General Gordon,\nwho was surprised, indeed, when I told him that I was a survivor of\nHicks's force, and had been living nine months at El Obeid.\n\n\"'You are heartily welcome, sir,' he said; 'but I fear that you have\ncome into an even greater danger than you have left, for our position\nhere is well-nigh desperate. For months I have been praying for aid\nfrom England, and my last news was that it was just setting out, so I\nfear there is no hope that it will reach me in time. The government of\nEngland will have to answer, before God, for their desertion of me, and\nof the poor people here, whom they sent me to protect from the Mahdi.\n\n\"'For myself, I am content. I have done my duty as far as lay in my\npower, but I had a right to rely upon receiving support from those who\nsent me. I am in the hands of God. But for the many thousands who\ntrusted in me, and remained here, I feel very deeply.\n\n\"'Now the first thing is to provide you with clothes. I am expecting\nColonel Stewart here, every minute, and he will see that you are made\ncomfortable.'\n\n\"'I shall be glad to place myself at your disposal, sir,' I said. 'I\nspeak Arabic fluently, and shall be ready to perform any service of\nwhich I may be capable.'\n\n\"'I thank you,' he said, 'and will avail myself of your offer, if I see\nany occasion; but at present, we have rather to suffer than to do. We\nhave occasional fights, but of late the attacks have been feeble, and I\nthink that the Mahdi depends upon hunger rather than force to obtain\npossession of this town.\n\n\"This evening, I will ask you to tell me your story. Colonel Stewart\nwill show you a room. There is only one other white man--Mr.\nPower--here. We live together as one family, of which you will now be a\nmember.'\n\n\"I felt strange when I came to put on my European clothes. Mr. Power,\nwho tells me he has been here for some years, as correspondent of the\nTimes, has this afternoon taken me round the defences, and into the\nworkshops. I think the place can resist any attacks, if the troops\nremain faithful; but of this there is a doubt. A good many of the\nSoudanese have already been sent away. As Gordon said at dinner this\nevening, if he had but a score of English officers, he would be\nperfectly confident that he could resist any enemy save starvation.\n\n\"September 12th:\n\n\"It has been settled that Colonel Stewart and Mr. Power are to go down\nthe river in the Abbas, and I am to go with them. The General proposed\nit to me. I said that I could not think of leaving him here by himself,\nso he said kindly:\n\n\"'I thank you, Mr. Hilliard, but you could do no good here, and would\nonly be throwing away your life. We can hold on to the end of the year,\nthough the pinch will be very severe; but I think we can make the\nstores last, till then. But by the end of December our last crust will\nhave been eaten, and the end will have come. It will be a satisfaction\nto me to know that I have done my best, and fail only because of the\nmiserable delays and hesitation of government.'\n\n\"So it is settled that I am going. The gunboats are to escort us for\nsome distance. Were it not for Gordon, I should feel delighted at the\nprospect. It is horrible to leave him--one of the noblest\nEnglishmen!--alone to his fate. My only consolation is that if I\nremained I could not avert it, but should only be a sharer in it.\n\n\"September 18th:\n\n\"We left Khartoum on the 14th, and came down without any serious\ntrouble until this morning, when the boat struck on a rock in the\ncataract, opposite a village called Hebbeh. A hole has been knocked in\nher bottom, and there is not a shadow of hope of getting her off.\nNumbers of the natives have gathered on the shore. I have advised that\nwe should disregard their invitations to land, but that, as there would\nbe no animosity against the black crew, they would be safe; and that we\nthree whites should take the ship's boat, and four of the crew, put\nprovisions for a week on board, and make our way down the river.\nColonel Stewart, however, feels convinced that the people can be\ntrusted, and that we had better land and place ourselves under the\nprotection of the sheik. He does not know the Arabs as well as I do.\n\n\"However, as he has determined to go ashore, I can do nothing. I\nconsider it unlikely, in the extreme, that there will be any additions\nto this journal. If, at any time in the future, this should fall into\nthe hands of any of my countrymen, I pray that they will send it down\nto my dear wife, Mrs. Hilliard, whom, I pray, God may bless and\ncomfort, care of the Manager of the Bank, Cairo.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 20: A Momentous Communication.\n\n\nGregory had, after finishing the record, sat without moving until the\ndinner hour. It was a relief to him to know that his father had not\nspent the last years of his life as he had feared, as a miserable\nslave--ill treated, reviled, insulted, perhaps chained and beaten by\nsome brutal taskmaster; but had been in a position where, save that he\nwas an exile, kept from his home and wife, his lot had not been\nunbearable. He knew more of him than he had ever known before. It was\nas a husband that his mother had always spoken of him; but here he saw\nthat he was daring, full of resource, quick to grasp any opportunity,\nhopeful and yet patient, longing eagerly to rejoin his wife, and yet\ncontent to wait until the chances should be all in his favour. He was\nunaffectedly glad thus to know him; to be able, in future, to think of\nhim as one of whom he would have been proud; who would assuredly have\nwon his way to distinction.\n\nIt was not so that he had before thought of him. His mother had said\nthat he was of good family, and that it was on account of his marriage\nwith her that he had quarrelled with his relations. It had always\nseemed strange to him that he should have been content to take, as she\nhad told him, an altogether subordinate position in a mercantile house\nin Alexandria. She had accounted for his knowledge of Arabic by the\nfact that he had been, for two years, exploring the temples and tombs\nof Egypt with a learned professor; but surely, as a man of good family,\nhe could have found something to do in England, instead of coming out\nto take so humble a post in Egypt.\n\nGregory knew nothing of the difficulty that a young man in England has,\nin obtaining an appointment of any kind, or of fighting his way single\nhanded. Influence went for much in Egypt, and it seemed to him that,\neven if his father had quarrelled with his own people, there must have\nbeen many ways open to him of maintaining himself honourably. Therefore\nhe had always thought that, although he might have been all that his\nmother described him--the tenderest and most loving of husbands, a\ngentleman, and estimable in all respects--his father must have been\nwanting in energy and ambition, deficient in the qualities that would\nfit him to fight his own battle, and content to gain a mere competence,\ninstead of struggling hard to make his way up the ladder. He had\naccounted for his going up as interpreter, with Hicks Pasha, by the\nfact that his work with the contractor was at an end, and that he saw\nno other opening for himself.\n\nHe now understood how mistaken he had been, in his estimate of his\nfather's character; and wondered, even more than before, why he should\nhave taken that humble post at Alexandria. His mother had certainly\ntold him, again and again, that he had done so simply because the\ndoctors had said that she could not live in England; but surely, in all\nthe wide empire of England, there must be innumerable posts that a\ngentleman could obtain. Perhaps he should understand it better, some\nday. At present, it seemed unaccountable to him. He felt sure that, had\nhe lived, his father would have made a name for himself; and that it\nwas in that hope, and not of the pay that he would receive as an\ninterpreter, that he had gone up with Hicks; and that, had he not died\nat that little village by the Nile, he would assuredly have done so,\nfor the narrative he had left behind him would in itself, if published,\nhave shown what stuff there was in him.\n\nIt was hard that fate should have snatched him away, just when it had\nseemed that his trials were over, that he was on the point of being\nreunited to his wife. Still, it was a consolation to know he had died\nsuddenly, as one falls in battle; not as a slave, worn out by grief and\nsuffering.\n\nAs he left his hut, he said to Zaki:\n\n\"I shall not want you again this evening; but mind, we must be on the\nmove at daylight.\"\n\n\"You did not say whether we were to take the horses, Master; but I\nsuppose you will do so?\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you that we are going to have camels. They are to\nbe put on board for us, tonight. They are fast camels and, as the\ndistance from the point where we shall land to the Atbara will not be\nmore than seventy or eighty miles, we shall be able to do it in a day.\"\n\n\"That will be very good, master. Camels are much better than horses,\nfor the desert. I have got everything else ready.\"\n\nAfter dinner was over, the party broke up quickly, as many of the\nofficers had preparations to make. Gregory went off to the tent of the\nofficer with whom he was best acquainted in the Soudanese regiment.\n\n\"I thought that I would come and have a chat with you, if you happened\nto be in.\"\n\n\"I shall be very glad, but I bar Fashoda. One is quite sick of the\nname.\"\n\n\"No, it was not Fashoda that I was going to talk to you about. I want\nto ask you something about England. I know really nothing about it, for\nI was born in Alexandria, shortly after my parents came out from\nEngland.\n\n\"Is it easy for anyone who has been well educated, and who is a\ngentleman, to get employment there? I mean some sort of appointment,\nsay, in India or the West Indies.\"\n\n\"Easy! My dear Hilliard, the camel in the eye of a needle is a joke to\nit. If a fellow is eighteen, and has had a first-rate education and a\ngood private coach, that is, a tutor, he may pass through his\nexamination either for the army, or the civil service, or the Indian\nservice. There are about five hundred go up to each examination, and\nseventy or eighty at the outside get in. The other four hundred or so\nare chucked. Some examinations are for fellows under nineteen, others\nare open for a year or two longer. Suppose, finally, you don't get in;\nthat is to say, when you are two-and-twenty, your chance of getting any\nappointment, whatever, in the public service is at an end.\"\n\n\"Then interest has nothing to do with it?\"\n\n\"Well, yes. There are a few berths in the Foreign Office, for example,\nin which a man has to get a nomination before going in for the exam;\nbut of course the age limit tells there, as well as in any other.\"\n\n\"And if a man fails altogether, what is there open to him?\"\n\nThe other shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Well, as far as I know, if he hasn't capital he can emigrate. That is\nwhat numbers of fellows do. If he has interest, he can get a commission\nin the militia, and from that possibly into the line; or he can enlist\nas a private, for the same object. There is a third alternative, he can\nhang himself. Of course, if he happens to have a relation in the city\nhe can get a clerkship; but that alternative, I should say, is worse\nthan the third.\"\n\n\"But I suppose he might be a doctor, a clergyman, or a lawyer?\"\n\n\"I don't know much about those matters, but I do know that it takes\nabout five years' grinding, and what is called 'walking the hospitals,'\nthat is, going round the wards with the surgeons, before one is\nlicensed to kill. I think, but I am not sure, that three years at the\nbar would admit you to practice, and usually another seven or eight\nyears are spent, before you earn a penny. As for the Church, you have\nto go through the university, or one of the places we call training\ncolleges; and when, at last, you are ordained, you may reckon, unless\nyou have great family interest, on remaining a curate, with perhaps one\nhundred or one hundred and fifty pounds per annum, for eighteen or\ntwenty years.\"\n\n\"And no amount of energy will enable a man of, say, four-and-twenty,\nwithout a profession, to obtain a post on which he could live with some\ndegree of comfort?\"\n\n\"I don't think energy would have anything to do with it. You cannot\ndrop into a merchant's office and say, 'I want a snug berth, out in\nChina;' or 'I should like an agency, in Mesopotamia.' If you have luck,\nanything is possible. If you haven't luck, you ought to fall back on my\nthree alternatives--emigrate, enlist, or hang yourself. Of course, you\ncan sponge on your friends for a year or two, if you are mean enough to\ndo so; but there is an end to that sort of thing, in time.\n\n\"May I ask why you put the question, Hilliard? You have really a\nsplendid opening, here. You are surely not going to be foolish enough\nto chuck it, with the idea of returning to England, and taking anything\nthat may turn up?\"\n\n\"No, I am not so foolish as that. I have had, as you say,\nluck--extraordinary luck--and I have quite made up my mind to stay in\nthe service. No, I am really asking you because I know so little of\nEngland that I wondered how men who had a fair education, but no family\ninterest, did get on.\"\n\n\"They very rarely do get on,\" the other said. \"Of course, if they are\ninventive geniuses they may discover something--an engine, for example,\nthat will do twice the work with half the consumption of fuel that any\nother engine will do; or, if chemically inclined, they may discover\nsomething that will revolutionize dyeing, for example: but not one man\nin a thousand is a genius; and, as a rule, the man you are speaking\nof--the ordinary public school and 'varsity man--if he has no interest,\nand is not bent upon entering the army, even as a private, emigrates if\nhe hasn't sufficient income to live upon at home.\"\n\n\"Thank you! I had no idea it was so difficult to make a living in\nEngland, or to obtain employment, for a well-educated man of two or\nthree and twenty.\"\n\n\"My dear Hilliard, that is the problem that is exercising the minds of\nthe whole of the middle class of England, with sons growing up. Of\ncourse, men of business can take their sons into their own offices, and\ntrain them to their own profession; but after all, if a man has four or\nfive sons, he cannot take them all into his office with a view to\npartnership. He may take one, but the others have to make their own\nway, somehow.\"\n\nThey chatted now upon the war, the dates upon which the various\nregiments would go down, and the chance of the Khalifa collecting\nanother army, and trying conclusions with the invaders again. At last,\nGregory got up and went back to his hut. He could now understand why\nhis father, having quarrelled with his family, might have found himself\nobliged to take the first post that was offered, however humble, in\norder to obtain the advantage of a warm climate for his wife.\n\n\"He must have felt it awfully,\" he mused. \"If he had been the sort of\nman I had always thought him, he could have settled down to the life.\nBut now I know him better, I can understand that it must have been\nterrible for him, and he would be glad to exchange it for the\ninterpretership, where he would have some chance of distinguishing\nhimself; or, at any rate, of taking part in exciting events.\n\n\"I will open that packet, but from what my mother said, I do not think\nit will be of any interest to me, now. I fancy, by what she said, that\nit contained simply my father's instructions as to what she was to do,\nin the event of his death during the campaign. I don't see what else it\ncan be.\"\n\nHe drew the curtains he had rigged up, at the doorway and window, to\nkeep out insects; lighted his lantern; and then, sitting down on the\nground by his bed, opened the packet his mother had given him. The\nouter cover was in her handwriting.\n\n\"My dearest boy:\n\n\"I have, as I told you, kept the enclosed packet, which is not to be\nopened until I have certain news of your father's death. This news, I\ntrust, you will some day obtain. As you see, the enclosed packet is\ndirected to me. I do not think that you will find in it anything of\nimportance, to yourself. It probably contains only directions and\nadvice for my guidance, in case I should determine to return to\nEngland. I have been the less anxious to open it, because I have been\nconvinced that it is so; for of course, I know the circumstances of his\nfamily, and there could be nothing new that he could write to me on\nthat score.\n\n\"I have told you that he quarrelled with his father, because he chose\nto marry me. As you have heard from me, I was the daughter of a\nclergyman, and at his death took a post as governess. Your father fell\nin love with me. He was the son of the Honorable James Hartley, who was\nbrother to the Earl of Langdale. Your father had an elder brother. Mr.\nHartley was a man of the type now, happily, less common than it was\ntwenty years ago. He had but a younger brother's portion, and a small\nestate that had belonged to his mother; but he was as proud as if he\nhad been a peer of the realm, and owner of a county. I do not know\nexactly what the law of England is--whether, at the death of his\nbrother, your grandfather would have inherited the title, or not. I\nnever talked on this subject with your father, who very seldom alluded\nto matters at home. He had, also, two sisters.\n\n\"As he was clever, and had already gained some reputation by his\nexplorations in Egypt; and was, moreover, an exceptionally handsome\nman--at least, I thought so--your grandfather made up his mind that he\nwould make a very good marriage. When he learned of your father's\naffection for me, he was absolutely furious, told his son that he never\nwished to see him again, and spoke of me in a manner that Gregory\nresented; and as a result, they quarrelled.\n\n\"Your father left the house, never to enter it again. I would have\nreleased him from his promise, but he would not hear of it, and we were\nmarried. He had written for magazines and newspapers, on Egyptian\nsubjects, and thought that he could make a living for us both, with his\npen; but unhappily, he found that great numbers of men were trying to\ndo the same; and that, although his papers on Egyptian discoveries had\nalways been accepted, it was quite another thing when he came to write\non general subjects.\n\n\"We had a hard time of it, but we were very happy, nevertheless. Then\ncame the time when my health began to give way. I had a terrible cough,\nand the doctor said that I must have a change to a warmer climate. We\nwere very poor then--so poor that we had only a few shillings left, and\nlived in one room. Your father saw an advertisement for a man to go out\nto the branch of a London firm, at Alexandria. Without saying a word to\nme, he went and obtained it, thanks to his knowledge of Arabic.\n\n\"He was getting on well in the firm, when the bombardment of Alexandria\ntook place. The offices and stores of his employers were burned; and,\nas it would take many months before they could be rebuilt, the\nemployees were ordered home; but any who chose to stay were permitted\nto do so, and received three months' pay. Your father saw that there\nwould be many chances, when the country settled down, and so took a\npost under a contractor of meat for the army.\n\n\"We moved to Cairo. Shortly after our arrival there he was, as he\nthought, fortunate in obtaining the appointment of an interpreter with\nHicks Pasha. I did not try to dissuade him. Everyone supposed that the\nEgyptian troops would easily defeat the Dervishes. There was some\ndanger, of course; but it seemed to me, as it did to him, that this\nopening would lead to better things; and that, when the rebellion was\nput down, he would be able to obtain some good civil appointment, in\nthe Soudan. It was not the thought of his pay, as interpreter, that\nweighed in the slightest with either of us. I was anxious, above all\nthings, that he should be restored to a position where he could\nassociate with gentlemen, as one of themselves, and could again take\nhis real name.\"\n\nGregory started, as he read this. He had never had an idea that the\nname he bore was not rightly his own, and even the statement of his\ngrandfather's name had not struck him as affecting himself.\n\n\"Your father had an honourable pride in his name, which was an old one;\nand when he took the post at Alexandria, which was little above that of\nan ordinary office messenger, he did not care that he should be\nrecognized, or that one of his name should be known to be occupying\nsuch a station. He did not change his name, he simply dropped the\nsurname. His full name was Gregory Hilliard Hartley. He had always\nintended, when he had made a position for himself, to recur to it; and,\nof course, it will be open to you to do so, also. But I know that it\nwould have been his wish that you, like him, should not do so, unless\nyou had made such a position for yourself that you would be a credit to\nit.\n\n\"On starting, your father left me to decide whether I should go home. I\nimagine that the packet merely contains his views on that subject. He\nknew what mine were. I would rather have begged my bread, than have\ngone back to ask for alms of the man who treated his son so cruelly. It\nis probable that, by this time, the old man is dead; but I should\nobject as much to have to appeal to my husband's brother, a character I\ndisliked. Although he knew that his father's means were small, he was\nextravagant to the last degree, and the old man was weak enough to keep\nhimself in perpetual difficulties, to satisfy his son. Your father\nlooked for no pecuniary assistance from his brother; but the latter\nmight, at least, have come to see him; or written kindly to him, when\nhe was in London. As your father was writing in his own name for\nmagazines, his address could be easily found out, by anyone who wanted\nto know it. He never sent one single word to him, and I should object\nquite as much to appeal to him, as to the old man.\n\n\"As to the sisters, who were younger than my husband, they were nice\ngirls; but even if your grandfather is dead, and has, as no doubt would\nbe the case, left what he had between them, it certainly would not\namount to much. Your father has told me that the old man had mortgaged\nthe estate, up to the hilt, to pay his brother's debts; and that when\nit came to be sold, as it probably would be at his death, there would\nbe very little left for the girls. Therefore, certainly I could not go\nand ask them to support us.\n\n\"My hope is, my dear boy, that you may be able to make your way, here,\nin the same manner as your father was doing, when he fell; and that,\nsomeday, you may attain to an honourable position, in which you will be\nable, if you visit England, to call upon your aunts, not as one who has\nanything to ask of them, but as a relative of whom they need not feel\nin any way ashamed.\n\n\"I feel that my end is very near, Gregory. I hope to say all that I\nhave to say to you, before it comes, but I may not have an opportunity;\nand in that case, some time may elapse before you read this, and it\nwill come to you as a voice from the grave. I am not, in any way,\nwishing to bind you to any course of action, but only to explain fully\nyour position to you, and to tell you my thoughts.\n\n\"God bless you, my dear boy, prosper and keep you! I know enough of you\nto be sure that, whatever your course may be, you will bear yourself as\na true gentleman, worthy of your father and of the name you bear.\n\n\"Your loving Mother.\"\n\nGregory sat for some time before opening the other enclosure. It\ncontained an open envelope, on which was written \"To my Wife;\" and\nthree others, also unfastened, addressed respectively, \"The Hon. James\nHartley, King's Lawn, Tavistock, Devon\"; the second, \"G. Hilliard\nHartley, Esquire, The Albany, Piccadilly, London;\" the third, \"Miss\nHartley,\" the address being the same as that of her father. He first\nopened the one to his mother.\n\n\"My dearest Wife,\n\n\"I hope that you will never read these lines, but that I shall return\nto you safe and sound--I am writing this, in case it should be\notherwise--and that you will never have occasion to read these\ninstructions, or rather I should say this advice, for it is no more\nthan that. We did talk the matter over, but you were so wholly averse\nfrom any idea of ever appealing to my father, or family, however sore\nthe straits to which you might be reduced, that I could not urge the\nmatter upon you; and yet, although I sympathize most thoroughly with\nyour feelings, I think that in case of dire necessity you should do so,\nand at least afford my father the opportunity of making up for his\ntreatment of myself. The small sum that I left in your hands must soon\nbe exhausted. If I am killed, you will, perhaps, obtain a small\npension; but this, assuredly, would not be sufficient to maintain you\nand the boy in comfort. I know that you said, at the time, that\npossibly you could add to it by teaching. Should this be so, you may be\nable to remain in Egypt; and when the boy grows up, he will obtain\nemployment of some sort, here.\n\n\"But should you be unsuccessful in this direction, I do not see what\nyou could do. Were you to go to England, with the child, what chance\nwould you have of obtaining employment there, without friends or\nreferences? I am frightened at the prospect. I know that, were you\nalone, you would do anything rather than apply to my people; but you\nhave the child to think of, and, painful as it would be to you, it yet\nseems to me the best thing that could be done. At any rate, I enclose\nyou three letters to my brother, father, and sisters. I have no legal\nclaim on any of them, but I certainly have a moral claim on my brother.\nIt is he who has impoverished the estate, so that, even had I not\nquarrelled with my father, there could never, after provision had been\nmade for my sisters, have been anything to come to me.\n\n\"I do not ask you to humiliate yourself, by delivering these letters\npersonally. I would advise you to post them from Cairo, enclosing in\neach a note saying how I fell, and that you are fulfilling my\ninstructions, by sending the letter I wrote before leaving you. It may\nbe that you will receive no reply. In that case, whatever happens to\nyou and the child, you will have nothing to reproach yourself for.\nPossibly my father may have succeeded to the title and, if for no other\nreason, he may then be willing to grant you an allowance, on condition\nthat you do not return to England; as he would know that it would be\nnothing short of a scandal, that the wife of one of his sons was trying\nto earn her bread in this country.\n\n\"Above all, dear, I ask you not to destroy these letters. You may, at\nfirst, scorn the idea of appealing for help; but the time might come,\nas it came to us in London, when you feel that fate is too strong for\nyou, and that you can struggle no longer. Then you might regret, for\nthe sake of the child, that you had not sent these letters.\n\n\"It is a terrible responsibility that I am leaving you. I well know\nthat you will do all, dear, that it is possible for you to do, to avoid\nthe necessity for sending these letters. That I quite approve, if you\ncan struggle on. God strengthen you to do it! It is only if you fail\nthat I say, send them. My father may, by this time, regret that he\ndrove me from home. He may be really anxious to find me, and at least\nit is right that he should have the opportunity of making what amends\nhe can. From my sisters, I know that you can have little but sympathy;\nbut that, I feel sure, they will give you, and even sympathy is a great\ndeal, to one who has no friends. I feel it sorely that I should have\nnaught to leave you but my name, and this counsel. Earnestly I hope and\npray that it may never be needed.\n\n\"Yours till death,\n\n\"Gregory Hilliard Hartley.\"\n\nGregory then opened the letter to his grandfather.\n\n\"Dear Father,\n\n\"You will not receive this letter till after my death. I leave it\nbehind me, while I go up with General Hicks to the Soudan. It will not\nbe sent to you, unless I die there. I hope that, long ere this, you may\nhave felt, as I have done, that we were both somewhat in the wrong, in\nthe quarrel that separated us. You, I think, were hard. I, no doubt,\nwas hasty. You, I think, assumed more than was your right, in demanding\nthat I should break a promise that I had given, to a lady against whom\nnothing could be said, save that she was undowered. Had I, like\nGeoffrey, been drawing large sums of money from you, you would\nnecessarily have felt yourself in a position to have a very strong\nvoice in so important a matter. But the very moderate allowance I\nreceived, while at the University, was never increased. I do not think\nit is too much to say that, for every penny I have got from you,\nGeoffrey has received a guinea.\n\n\"However, that is past and gone. I have been fighting my own battle,\nand was on my way to obtaining a good position. Until I did so, I\ndropped our surname. I did not wish that it should be known that one of\nour family was working, in an almost menial position, in Egypt. I have\nnow obtained the post of interpreter, on the staff of General Hicks;\nand, if he is successful in crushing the rebellion, I shall be certain\nof good, permanent employment, when I can resume my name. The fact that\nyou receive this letter will be a proof that I have fallen in battle,\nor by disease.\n\n\"I now, as a dying prayer, beg you to receive my wife and boy; or, if\nthat cannot be, to grant her some small annuity, to assist her in her\nstruggle with the world. Except for her sake, I do not regret my\nmarriage. She has borne the hardships, through which we have passed,\nnobly and without a murmur. She has been the best of wives to me, and\nhas proved herself a noble woman, in every respect.\n\n\"I leave the matter in your hands, Father, feeling assured that, from\nyour sense of justice alone, if not for the affection you once bore me,\nyou will befriend my wife. As I know that the Earl was in feeble\nhealth, when I left England; you may, by this time, have come into the\ntitle, in which case you will be able, without in any way\ninconveniencing yourself, to settle an annuity upon my wife, sufficient\nto keep her in comfort. I can promise, in her name, that in that case\nyou will never be troubled in any way by her; and she will probably\ntake up her residence, permanently, in Egypt, as she is not strong, and\nthe warm climate is essential to her.\"\n\nThe letter to his brother was shorter.\n\n\"My dear Geoffrey,\n\n\"I am going up, with General Hicks, to the Soudan. If you receive this\nletter, it will be because I have died there. I leave behind me my wife,\nand a boy. I know that, at present, you are scarcely likely to be able\nto do much for them, pecuniarily; but as you will someday--possibly not\na very distant one--inherit the title and estate, you will then be able\nto do so, without hurting yourself.\n\n\"We have never seen much of each other. You left school before I began\nit, and you left Oxford two years before I went up to Cambridge. You\nhave never been at home much, since; and I was two years in Egypt, and\nhave now been about the same time, here. I charge my wife to send you\nthis, and I trust that, for my sake, you will help her. She does not\nthink of returning to England. Life is not expensive, in this country.\nEven an allowance of a hundred a year would enable her to remain here.\nIf you can afford double that, do so for my sake; but, at any rate, I\nfeel that I can rely upon you to do at least that much, when you come\ninto the title. Had I lived, I should never have troubled anyone at\nhome; but as I shall be no longer able to earn a living for her and the\nboy, I trust that you will not think it out of the way for me to ask\nfor what would have been a very small younger brother's allowance, had\nI remained at home.\"\n\nThe letter to his sisters was in a different strain.\n\n\"My dear Flossie and Janet,\n\n\"I am quite sure that you, like myself, felt deeply grieved over our\nseparation; and I can guess that you will have done what you could,\nwith our father, to bring about a reconciliation. When you receive\nthis, dears, I shall have gone. I am about to start on an expedition\nthat is certain to be dangerous, and which may be fatal; and I have\nleft this with my wife, to send you if she has sure news of my death. I\nhave had hard times. I see my way now, and I hope that I shall, ere\nlong, receive a good official appointment, out here. Still, it is as\nwell to prepare for the worst; and if you receive this letter, the\nworst has come. As I have only just begun to rise again in the world, I\nhave been able to make no provision for my wife. I know that you liked\nher, and that you would by no means have disapproved of the step I\ntook. If our father has not come into the title, when you receive this,\nyour pocket money will be only sufficient for your own wants; therefore\nI am not asking for help in that way, but only that you will write to\nher an affectionate letter. She is without friends, and will fight her\nbattle as best she can. She is a woman in a thousand, and worthy of the\naffection and esteem of any man on earth.\n\n\"There is a boy, too--another Gregory Hilliard Hartley. She will be\nalone in the world with him, and a letter from you would be very\nprecious to her. Probably, by the same post as you receive this, our\nfather will also get one requesting more substantial assistance, but\nwith that you have nothing to do. I am only asking that you will let\nher know there are, at least, two people in the world who take an\ninterest in her, and my boy.\n\n\"Your affectionate Brother.\"\n\nThere was yet another envelope, with no address upon it. It contained\ntwo documents. One was a copy of the certificate of marriage, between\nGregory Hilliard Hartley and Anne Forsyth, at Saint Paul's Church,\nPlymouth; with the names of two witnesses, and the signature of the\nofficiating minister. The other was a copy of the register of the\nbirth, at Alexandria, of Gregory Hilliard, son of Gregory Hilliard\nHartley and Anne, his wife. A third was a copy of the register of\nbaptism of Gregory Hilliard Hartley, the son of Gregory Hilliard and\nAnne Hartley, at the Protestant Church, Alexandria.\n\n\"I will write, someday, to my aunts,\" Gregory said, as he replaced the\nletters in the envelopes. \"The others will never go. Still, I may as\nwell keep them.\n\n\"So I am either grandson or nephew of an earl. I can't say that I am\ndazzled by the honour. I should like to know my aunts, but as for the\nother two, I would not go across the street to make their\nacquaintance.\"\n\nHe carefully stowed the letters away in his portmanteau, and then lay\ndown for a few hours' sleep.\n\n\"The day is breaking, master,\" Zaki said, laying his hand upon\nGregory's shoulder.\n\n\"All right, Zaki! While you get the water boiling, I shall run down to\nthe river and have a bathe, and shall be ready for my cocoa, in twenty\nminutes.\"\n\n\"Are we going to put on those Dervish dresses at once, master? They\ncame yesterday evening.\"\n\n\"No; I sha'n't change till we get to the place where we land.\"\n\nAs soon as he had breakfasted, he told Zaki to carry his portmanteau,\nbed, and other belongings to the house that served as a store for\nGeneral Hunter's staff. He waited until his return, and then told him\nto take the two rifles, the packets of ammunition, the spears, and the\nDervish dresses down to the steamer. Then he joined the General, who\nwas just starting, with his staff, to superintend the embarkation.\n\nThree steamers were going up, and each towed a barge, in which the\ngreater part of the troops was to be stowed, and in the stern of one of\nthese knelt two camels.\n\n\"There are your nags, Mr. Hilliard,\" the General said. \"There is an\nattendant with each. They will manage them better than strangers, and\nwithout them we might have a job in getting the animals ashore. Of\ncourse, I shall take the drivers on with us. The sheik told me the\ncamels are two of the fastest he has ever had. He has sent saddles with\nthem, and water skins. The latter you will probably not want, if all\ngoes well. Still, it is better to take them.\"\n\n\"I shall assuredly do so, sir. They may be useful to us, on the ride,\nand though I suppose the camels would do well enough without them, it\nis always well to be provided, when one goes on an expedition, for any\nemergency that may occur.\"\n\nAn hour later, the steamer started. The river was still full, and the\ncurrent rapid, and they did not move more than five miles an hour\nagainst it. At the villages they passed, the people flocked down to the\nbanks, with cries of welcome and the waving of flags. They felt, now,\nthat their deliverance was accomplished, and that they were free from\nthe tyranny that had, for so many years, oppressed them.\n\nThe banks were for the most part low; and, save at these villages, the\njourney was a monotonous one. The steamers kept on their way till\nnightfall, and then anchored.\n\nThey started again, at daybreak. At breakfast, General Hunter said:\n\n\"I think that in another two hours we shall be pretty well due west of\nEl Fasher, so you had better, presently, get into your Dervish dress.\nYou have got some iodine from the doctor, have you not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You had better stain yourself all over, and take a good supply, in\ncase you have to do it again.\"\n\nGregory went below, and had his head shaved by one of the Soudanese;\nthen re-stained himself, from head to foot, and put on the Dervish\nattire--loose trousers and a long smock, with six large square patches,\narranged in two lines, in front. A white turban and a pair of shoes\ncompleted the costume. The officers laughed, as he came on deck again.\n\n\"You look an out-and-out Dervish, Hilliard,\" one of them said. \"It is\nlucky that there are none of the Lancers scouting about. They would\nhardly give you time to explain, especially with that rifle and spear.\"\n\nPresently they came to a spot where the water was deep up to the bank,\nwhich was some six feet above its level. The barge with the camels was\nbrought up alongside. It had no bulwark, and as the deck was level with\nthe land, the camels were, with a good deal of pressing on the part of\ntheir drivers, and pushing by as many Soudanese as could come near\nenough to them, got ashore.\n\nNone of the Soudanese recognized Gregory, and looked greatly surprised\nat the sudden appearance of two Dervishes among them. As soon as the\ncamels were landed, Gregory and Zaki mounted them.\n\n\"You had better keep, if anything, to the south of east,\" General\nHunter's last instructions had been. \"Unless Parsons has been greatly\ndelayed, they should be two or three days' march farther up the river,\nand every mile you strike the stream, behind him, is so much time\nlost.\"\n\nHe waved his hand to them and wished them farewell, as they started,\nand his staff shouted their wishes for a safe journey. The black\nsoldiers, seeing that, whoever these Dervishes might be, they were well\nknown to the General and his officers, raised a cheer; to which Zaki,\nwho had hitherto kept in the background, waved his rifle in reply. As\nhis face was familiar to numbers of the Soudanese, they now recognized\nhim, and cheered more heartily than before, laughing like schoolboys at\nthe transformation.\n\n\n\nChapter 21: Gedareh.\n\n\n\"Abdul Azim was right about the camels,\" Gregory said, as soon as they\nwere fairly off. \"I have never ridden on one like this, before. What a\ndifference there is between them and the ordinary camel! It is not only\nthat they go twice as fast, but the motion is so pleasant, and easy.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master, these are riding camels of good breed. They cost twenty\ntimes as much as the others. They think nothing of keeping up this rate\nfor twelve hours, without a stop.\"\n\n\"If they do that, we shall be near the Atbara before it is dark. It is\nten o'clock now, and if General Hunter's map is right, we have only\nabout eighty miles to go, and I should think they are trotting seven\nmiles an hour.\"\n\nThey carried their rifles slung behind them and across the shoulders,\nrather than upright, as was the Arab fashion. The spears were held in\ntheir right hands.\n\n\"We must see if we can't fasten the spears in some other way, Zaki. We\nshould find them a nuisance, if we held them in our hands all the way.\nI should say it would be easy to fasten them across the saddle in front\nof us. If we see horsemen in the distance, we can take them into our\nhands.\"\n\n\"I think, Master, it would be easier to fasten them behind the saddles,\nwhere there is more width, and rings on the saddle on both sides.\"\n\nA short halt was made, and the spears fixed. Gregory then looked at his\ncompass.\n\n\"We must make for that rise, two or three miles away. I see exactly the\npoint we must aim for. When we get there, we must look at the compass\nagain.\"\n\nThey kept steadily on for six hours. They had seen no human figure,\nsince they started.\n\n\"We will stop here for half an hour,\" Gregory said. \"Give the animals a\ndrink of water, and a handful or two of grain.\"\n\n\"I don't think they will want water, Master. They had as much as they\ncould drink, before starting, and they are accustomed to drink when\ntheir work is over.\"\n\n\"Very well. At any rate, we will take something.\"\n\nThey opened one of the water skins, and poured some of the contents\ninto a gourd. Then, sitting down in the shadow of the camels, they ate\nsome dates and bread. They had only brought native food with them so\nthat, if captured and examined, there should be nothing to show that\nthey had been in contact with Europeans. Gregory had even left his\nrevolver behind him as, being armed with so good a weapon as a\nRemington, it was hardly likely that it would be needed; and if found\nupon them, it would be accepted as a proof that he was in the\nemployment of the infidels.\n\nIt was dusk when they arrived at the bank of the river. No incident had\nmarked the journey, nor had they seen any sign that Dervishes were in\nthe neighbourhood. The Atbara was in full flood, and was rushing down\nat six or seven miles an hour.\n\n\"Colonel Parsons must have had great difficulty in crossing, Zaki. He\nis hardly likely to have brought any boats across, from Kassala. I\ndon't know whether he has any guns with him, but if he has, I don't\nthink he can have crossed, even if they made rafts enough to carry\nthem.\"\n\nThey kept along the bank, until they reached a spot where the river had\noverflowed. Here the camels drank their fill. A little grain was given\nto them, and then they were turned loose, to browse on the bushes.\n\n\"There is no fear of their straying, I suppose, Zaki?\"\n\n\"No, Master. They are always turned loose at night. As there are plenty\nof bushes here, they will not go far.\"\n\nAfter another meal, they both lay down to sleep; and, as soon as it was\nlight, Zaki fetched in the camels and they continued their journey. In\nan hour, they arrived at a village. The people were already astir, and\nlooked with evident apprehension at the seeming Dervishes.\n\n\"Has a party of infidels passed along here?\" Gregory asked the village\nsheik, who came out and salaamed humbly.\n\n\"Yes, my lord, a party of soldiers, with some white officers, came\nthrough here three days ago.\"\n\n\"How many were there of them?\"\n\n\"There must have been more than a thousand of them.\"\n\n\"Many more?\"\n\n\"Not many; perhaps a hundred more. Your servant did not count them.\"\n\n\"Had they any cannon with them?\"\n\n\"No, my lord. They were all on foot. They all carried guns, but there\nwere no mounted men, or cannon.\"\n\n\"Where is Fadil and his army, that they thus allowed so small a force\nto march along, unmolested?\"\n\n\"They say that he is still near the Nile. Two of his scouts were here,\nthe day before the Turks came along. They stayed here for some hours,\nbut as they said nothing about the Turks coming from Kassala, I suppose\nthey did not know they had crossed the river.\"\n\n\"Well, we must go on, and see where they are. They must be mad to come\nwith so small a force, when they must have known that Fadil has a large\narmy. They will never go back again.\"\n\nWithout further talk, Gregory rode farther on. At each village through\nwhich they passed, they had some news of the passage of Colonel\nParsons' command. The camels had been resting, from the time when\nOmdurman was taken; and, having been well fed that morning, Gregory did\nnot hesitate to press them. The troops would not march above\ntwenty-five miles a day, and two days would take them to Mugatta, so\nthat if they halted there but for a day, he should be able to overtake\nthem that night.\n\nThe character of the country was now greatly changed. The bush was\nthick and high, and a passage through it would be very difficult for\nmounted men. There was no fear, therefore, that they would turn off\nbefore arriving at Mugatta; from which place there would probably be a\ntrack, of some sort, to Gedareh. It was but a thirty-mile ride and, on\narriving near the village, Gregory saw that a considerable number of\nmen were assembled there. He checked his camel.\n\n\"What do you make them out to be, Zaki? Your eyes are better than mine.\nThey may be Colonel Parsons' force, and on the other hand they may be\nDervishes, who have closed in behind him to cut off his retreat.\"\n\n\"They are not Dervishes, master,\" Zaki said, after a long, steady look.\n\"They have not white turbans. Some of their clothes are light, and some\ndark; but all have dark caps, like those the Soudanese troops wear.\"\n\n\"That is good enough, Zaki. We will turn our robes inside out, so as to\nhide the patches, as otherwise we might have a hot reception.\"\n\nWhen they were a quarter of a mile from the village, several men\nstarted out from the bushes, rifle in hand. They were all in Egyptian\nuniform.\n\n\"We are friends!\" Gregory shouted in Arabic. \"I am an officer of the\nKhedive, and have come from Omdurman, with a message to your\ncommander.\"\n\nA native officer, one of the party, at once saluted.\n\n\"You will find the bey in the village, Bimbashi.\"\n\n\"How long have you been here?\"\n\n\"We came in yesterday, and I hear that we shall start tomorrow, but I\nknow not whether that is so.\"\n\n\"Are there any Dervishes about?\"\n\n\"Yes; forty of them yesterday afternoon, coming from Gedareh, and\nignorant that we were here, rode in among our outposts on that hill to\nthe west. Three of them were killed, and three made prisoners. The rest\nrode away.\"\n\nWith a word of thanks, Gregory rode on. He dismounted when he reached\nthe village, and was directed to a neighbouring hut. Here Colonel\nParsons and the six white officers with him were assembled. A native\nsoldier was on sentry, at the door.\n\n\"I want to speak to Parsons Bey.\"\n\nThe Colonel, hearing the words, came to the door.\n\n\"Colonel Parsons,\" Gregory said in English, \"I am Major Hilliard of the\nEgyptian Army, and have the honour to be the bearer of a message to\nyou, from General Rundle, now in command at Omdurman.\"\n\n\"You are well disguised, indeed, sir,\" the Colonel said with a smile,\nas he held out his hand. \"I should never have taken you for anything\nbut a native. Where did you spring from? You can never have ridden,\nmuch less walked, across the desert from Omdurman?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I was landed from one of the gunboats in which General\nHunter, with fifteen hundred Soudanese troops, is ascending the Blue\nNile, to prevent Fadil from crossing and joining the Khalifa.\"\n\n\"Have you a written despatch?\"\n\n\"It was thought better that I should carry nothing, so that even the\nstrictest search would not show that I was a messenger.\"\n\n\"Is your message of a private character?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I think not.\"\n\n\"Then will you come in?\"\n\nGregory followed Colonel Parsons into the hut, which contained but one\nroom.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" the former said with a smile, \"allow me to introduce\nBimbashi Hilliard, who is the bearer of a message to me from General\nRundle, now in command at Omdurman.\n\n\"Major Hilliard, these are Captain MacKerrel, commanding four hundred\nand fifty men of the 16th Egyptians; Captain Wilkinson, an equal number\nof the Arab battalion; Major Lawson, who has under his command three\nhundred and seventy Arab irregulars; Captain the Honorable H. Ruthven,\nwho has under him eighty camel men; also Captain Fleming of the Royal\nArmy Medical Corps, who is at once our medical officer, and in command\nof the baggage column; and Captain Dwyer. They are all, like yourself,\nofficers in the Egyptian Army; and rank, like yourself, as Bimbashis.\n\n\"Now, sir, will you deliver your message to me?\"\n\n\"It is of a somewhat grave character, sir, but General Rundle thought\nit very important that you should be acquainted with the last news. The\nSirdar has gone up the White Nile, with some of the gunboats and the\n11th Soudanese. He deemed it necessary to go himself, because a body of\nforeign troops--believed to be French--have established themselves at\nFashoda.\"\n\nAn exclamation of surprise broke from all the officers.\n\n\"In the next place, sir, Fadil, who had arrived with his force within\nforty miles of Khartoum, has retired up the banks of the Blue Nile, on\nhearing of the defeat of the Khalifa. Major General Hunter has\ntherefore gone up that river, with three gunboats and another Soudanese\nbattalion, to prevent him, if possible, from crossing it and joining\nthe Khalifa, who is reported to be collecting the remains of his\ndefeated army.\n\n\"It is possible--indeed the General thinks it is probable--that Fadil,\nif unable to cross, may return with his army to Gedareh. It is to warn\nyou of this possibility that he sent me here. Gedareh is reported to be\na defensible position, and therefore he thinks that, if you capture it,\nit would be advisable to maintain yourself there until reinforcements\ncan be sent to you, either from the Blue Nile or the Atbara. The place,\nit seems, is well supplied with provisions and stores; and in the event\nof Fadil opposing you, it would be far safer for you to defend it than\nto be attacked in the open, or during a retreat.\"\n\n\"It is certainly important news, Mr. Hilliard. Hitherto we have\nsupposed that Fadil had joined the Khalifa before the fight at\nOmdurman, and there was therefore no fear of his reappearing here. We\nknow very little of the force at Gedareh. We took some prisoners\nyesterday, but their accounts are very conflicting. Still, there is\nevery reason to believe that the garrison is not strong. Certainly, as\nGeneral Rundle says, we should be in a much better position there than\nif we were attacked in the open. No doubt the Arabs who got off in the\nskirmish, yesterday, carried the news there; and probably some of them\nwould go direct to Fadil, and if he came down upon us here, with his\neight thousand men, our position would be a desperate one. It cost us\nfour days to cross the river at El Fasher, and would take us as much to\nbuild boats and recross here; and before that time, he might be upon\nus.\n\n\"It is evident, gentlemen, that we have only the choice of these\nalternatives--either to march, at once, against Gedareh; or to retreat\nimmediately, crossing the river here, or at El Fasher. As to remaining\nhere, of course, it is out of the question.\"\n\nThe consultation was a short one. All the officers were in favour of\npushing forward, pointing out that, as only the 16th Egyptians could be\nconsidered as fairly disciplined, the troops would lose heart if they\nretired; and could not be relied upon to keep steady, if attacked by a\nlargely superior force; while, at present, they would probably fight\nbravely. The Arab battalion had been raised by the Italians, and were\nat present full of confidence, as they had defeated the Mahdists who\nhad been besieging Kassala. The Arab irregulars had, of course, the\nfighting instincts of their race, and would assault an enemy bravely;\nbut in a defensive battle, against greatly superior numbers, could\nscarcely be expected to stand well. As for the eighty camel men, they\nwere all Soudanese soldiers, discharged from the army for old age and\nphysical unfitness. They could be relied upon to fight but, small in\nnumber as they were, could but have little effect on the issue of a\nbattle. All therefore agreed that, having come thus far, the safest, as\nwell as the most honourable course, would be to endeavour to fight the\nenemy in a strong position.\n\nAlthough it may be said that success justified it, no wilder enterprise\nwas ever undertaken than that of sending thirteen hundred only partly\ndisciplined men into the heart of the enemy's country. Omdurman and\nAtbara, to say nothing of previous campaigns, had shown how desperately\nthe Dervishes fought; and the order, for the garrison of Kassala to\nundertake it, can only have been given under an entire misconception of\nthe circumstances, and of the strength of the army under Fadil, that\nthey would almost certainly be called upon to encounter. This was the\nmore probable, as all the women and the property of his soldiers had\nbeen left at Gedareh, when he marched away; and his men would,\ntherefore, naturally wish to go there, before they made any endeavour\nto join the Khalifa.\n\nSuch, indeed, was the fact. Fadil concealed from them the news of the\ndisaster at Omdurman, for some days; and, when it became known, he had\ndifficulty in restraining his troops from marching straight for\nGedareh.\n\n\"Do you go on with us, Mr. Hilliard?\" Colonel Parsons asked, when they\nhad decided to start for Gedareh.\n\n\"Yes, sir. My instructions are to go on with you and, if the town is\nbesieged, to endeavour to get through their lines, and carry the news\nto General Hunter, if I can ascertain his whereabouts. If not, to make\nstraight for Omdurman. I have two fast camels, which I shall leave\nhere, and return for them with my black boy, when we start.\"\n\n\"We shall be glad to have you with us,\" the Colonel said. \"Every white\nofficer is worth a couple of hundred men.\"\n\nAs they sat and chatted, Gregory asked how the force had crossed the\nAtbara.\n\n\"It was a big job,\" Colonel Parsons said. \"The river was wider than the\nThames, below London Bridge; and running something like seven miles an\nhour. We brought with us some barrels to construct a raft. When this\nwas built, it supported the ten men who started on it; but they were,\nin spite of their efforts, carried ten miles down the stream, and it\nwas not until five hours after they embarked that they managed to land.\nThe raft did not get back from its journey till the next afternoon,\nbeing towed along the opposite bank by the men.\n\n\"It was evident that this would not do. The Egyptian soldiers then took\nthe matter in hand. They made frameworks with the wood of the mimosa\nscrub, and covered these with tarpaulins, which we had fortunately\nbrought with us. They turned out one boat a day, capable of carrying\ntwo tons; and, six days after we reached the river, we all got across.\n\n\"The delay was a terrible nuisance at the time, but it has enabled you\nto come up here and warn us about Fadil. Fortunately no Dervishes came\nalong while we were crossing, and indeed we learned, from the prisoners\nwe took yesterday, that the fact that a force from Kassala had crossed\nthe river was entirely unknown, so no harm was done.\"\n\nThe sheik of the little village took charge of Gregory's camels. Some\nstores were also left there, under a small guard, as it was advisable\nto reduce the transport to the smallest possible amount.\n\nThe next morning the start was made. The bush was so thick that it was\nnecessary to march in single file. In the evening, the force halted in\na comparatively open country. The camel men reconnoitred the ground,\nfor some little distance round, and saw no signs of the enemy. They\ncamped, however, in the form of a square; and lay with their arms\nbeside them, in readiness to resist an attack.\n\nThe night passed quietly, and at early dawn they moved forward again.\nAt six o'clock the camel men exchanged a few shots with the Dervish\nscouts, who fell back at once. At eight a village was sighted, and the\nforce advanced upon it, in fighting order.\n\nIt was found, however, to have been deserted, except by a few old\npeople. These, on being questioned, said that the Emir Saadalla, who\ncommanded, had but two hundred rifles and six hundred spearmen, and had\nreceived orders from Fadil to surrender. Subsequent events showed that\nthey had been carefully tutored as to the reply to be given.\n\nThe force halted here, as Gedareh was still twelve miles away; and it\nwas thought better that, if there was fighting, they should be fresh.\nAt midnight, a deserter from the Dervishes came in, with the grave news\nthat the Emir had three thousand five hundred men, and was awaiting\nthem two miles outside the town. There was another informal council of\nwar, but all agreed that a retreat, through this difficult country,\nwould bring about the total annihilation of the force; and that there\nwas nothing to do but to fight.\n\nEarly in the morning, they started again. For the first two hours, the\nroad led through grass so high that even the men on camels could not\nsee above it. They pushed on till eight o'clock, when they reached a\nsmall knoll. At the foot of this they halted, and Colonel Parsons and\nthe officers ascended it, to reconnoitre.\n\nThey saw, at once, that the deserter's news was true. A mile away four\nlines of Dervishes, marching in excellent order, were making their way\ntowards them. Colonel Parsons considered that their numbers could not\nbe less than four thousand, and at once decided to occupy a saddle-back\nhill, half a mile away; and the troops were hurried across. The\nDervishes also quickened their movements, but were too late to prevent\nthe hill from being seized.\n\nThe Arab battalion had been leading, followed by the Egyptians; while\nthe irregulars, divided into two bodies under Arab chiefs, guarded the\nhospital and baggage. The Dervishes at once advanced to the attack of\nthe hill, and the column wheeled into line, to meet it. Even on the\ncrest of the hill, the grass was breast high, but it did not impede the\nview of the advancing lines of the Dervishes. Into these a heavy and\ndestructive fire was at once poured. The enemy, however, pushed on,\nfiring in return; but being somewhat out of breath, from the rapidity\nwith which they had marched; and seeing nothing of the defenders of the\nhill, save their heads, they inflicted far less loss than they were\nthemselves suffering.\n\nThe fight was continuing, when Colonel Parsons saw that a force of\nabout three hundred Dervishes had worked round the back of the hill,\nwith the intention of falling upon the baggage. He at once sent one of\nthe Arab sheiks to warn Captain Fleming; who, from his position, was\nunable to see the approaching foe. Colonel Parsons had asked Gregory to\ntake up his position with the baggage, as he foresaw that, with their\nvastly greater numbers, it was likely that the Dervishes might sweep\nround and attack it.\n\nScarcely had the messenger arrived with the news, when the Dervishes\ncame rushing on through the high grass. In spite of the shouts of\nDoctor Fleming and Gregory, the escort of one hundred and twenty\nirregular Arabs, stationed at this point, at once broke and fled.\nHappily, a portion of the camel corps, with its commander, Captain\nRuthven, a militia officer, was close at hand. Though he had but\nthirty-four of these old soldiers with him, he rushed forward to meet\nthe enemy. Doctor Fleming and Gregory joined him and, all cheering to\nencourage the Soudanese, made a determined stand.\n\nGregory and Zaki kept up a steady fire with their Remingtons, and\npicked off several of the most determined of their assailants. The\nfight, however, was too unequal; the Dervishes got in behind them, and\ncut off the rear portion of the transport; and the little band,\nfighting obstinately, fell back, with their faces to the foe, towards\nthe main body.\n\nOne of the native officers of the Soudanese fell. Captain Ruthven, a\nvery powerful man, ran back and lifted the wounded soldier, and made\nhis way towards his friends. So closely pressed was he, by the\nDervishes, that three times he had to lay his burden down and defend\nhimself with his revolver; while Gregory and Zaki aided his retreat, by\nturning their fire upon his assailants. For this splendid act of\nbravery, Captain Ruthven afterwards received the Victoria Cross.\n\nFlushed by their success, the Dervishes pushed on. Fortunately, at this\ntime the main force of the Dervishes was beginning to waver, unable to\nwithstand the steady fire of the defenders of the hill; and as they\ndrew back a little, the Egyptian and Arab battalions rushed forward.\n\nShaken as they were, the Dervishes were unable to resist the attack;\nand broke and fled, pursued by the Arab battalion. The Egyptians,\nhowever, obeyed the orders of Captain MacKerrel and, halting, faced\nabout to encounter the attack from the rear. Their volleys caused the\nDervishes to hesitate, and Captain Ruthven and his party reached the\nsummit of the hill in safety.\n\nThe enemy, however, maintained a heavy fire for a few minutes; but the\nvolleys of the Egyptians, at a distance of only a hundred yards, were\nso deadly that they soon took to flight.\n\nThe first shot had been fired at half-past eight. At ten, the whole\nDervish force was scattered in headlong rout. Had Colonel Parsons\npossessed a cavalry force, the enemy would have been completely cut up.\nAs it was, pursuit was out of the question.\n\nThe force therefore advanced, in good order, to Gedareh. Here a Dervish\nEmir, who had been left in charge when the rest of the garrison moved\nout, surrendered at once, with the two hundred black riflemen under\nhim. He had long been suspected of disloyalty by the Khalifa, and at\nonce declared his hatred of Mahdism; declaring that, though he had not\ndared to declare himself openly, he had always been friendly to\nEgyptian rule.\n\nThe men with him at once fraternized with the Arabs of Colonel Parsons'\nforce, and were formally received into their ranks. The Emir showed his\nsincerity by giving them all the information in his power, as to\nFadil's position and movements, and by pointing out the most defensible\npositions.\n\nNone of the British officers had been wounded, but fifty-one of the men\nhad been killed, and eighty wounded. Five hundred of the Dervishes were\nleft dead upon the field, including four Emirs.\n\nNot a moment was lost in preparing for defence, for it was certain that\nFadil, on hearing the news, would at once march to retake the town. The\nposition was naturally a strong one. Standing on rising ground was\nFadil's house, surrounded by a brick wall, twelve feet high. Here the\nEgyptian battalion and camel corps were placed, with the hospital, and\ntwo brass guns which had been found there.\n\nA hundred yards away was another enclosure, with a five-foot wall, and\ntwo hundred yards away a smaller one. The Arab battalion was stationed\nto the rear of this, in a square enclosure with a brick wall, twelve\nfeet high, in which was situated a well. These four buildings were so\nplaced, that the fire from each covered the approaches to the other.\nTwo hundred yards from the well enclosure was a fortified house,\nsurrounded by a high wall. As the latter would need too many men for\nits defence, the wall was pulled down, and a detachment placed in the\nhouse.\n\nNo time was lost. The whole force was at once employed in pulling down\nhuts, clearing the ground of the high grass, and forming a zareba round\nthe town. The greatest cause for anxiety was ammunition. A large\nproportion of that carried in the pouches had been expended during the\nbattle, and the next morning Colonel Parsons, with a small force,\nhurried back to Mugatta to fetch up the reserve ammunition, which had\nbeen left there under a guard. He returned with it, three days later.\n\nAn abundant supply of provisions had been found in Gedareh, for here\nwere the magazines, not only of the four thousand men of the garrison\nand the women who had been left there, but sufficient for Fadil's army,\non their return. There were three or four wells, and a good supply of\nwater.\n\nThe ammunition arrived just in time; for, on the following morning,\nCaptain Ruthven's camel men brought in news that Fadil was close at\nhand. At half-past eight the Dervishes began the attack, on three sides\nof the defences. Sheltered by the long grass, they were able to make\ntheir way to within three hundred yards of the dwellings occupied by\nthe troops. But the intervening ground had all been cleared, and though\ntime after time they made rushes forward, they were unable to withstand\nthe withering fire to which they were exposed.\n\nAfter an hour's vain efforts their musketry fire ceased; but, half an\nhour later, strong reinforcements came up, and the attack recommenced.\nThis was accompanied with no greater success than the first attack, and\nFadil retired to a palm grove, two miles away. Of the defenders five\nmen were killed, and Captain Dwyer and thirteen men wounded.\n\nFor two days, Fadil endeavoured to persuade his troops to make another\nattack; but although they surrounded the town, and maintained a\nscattered fire, they could not be brought to attempt another assault,\nhaving lost over five hundred men in the two attacks the first day. He\nthen fell back, eight miles.\n\nThree days later, Colonel Parsons said to Gregory:\n\n\"I think the time has come, Mr. Hilliard, when I must apply for\nreinforcements. I am convinced that we can repel all attacks, but we\nare virtually prisoners here. Were we to endeavour to retreat, Fadil\nwould probably annihilate us. Our men have behaved admirably; but it is\none thing to fight well, when you are advancing; and another to be firm\nin retreat.\n\n\"But our most serious enemy, at present, is fever. Already, the stink\nof the unburied bodies of the Dervishes is overpowering, and every day\nit will become worse. Doctor Fleming reports to me that he has a great\nmany sick on his hands, and that he fears the conditions that surround\nus will bring about an epidemic. Therefore I have decided to send to\nGeneral Rundle, for a reinforcement that will enable us to move out to\nattack Fadil.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir, I will start at once.\"\n\n\"I will write my despatch. It will be ready for you to carry in an\nhour's time. You had better pick out a couple of good donkeys, from\nthose we captured here. As it is only nine o'clock, you will be able to\nget to Mugatta this evening. I don't think there is any fear of your\nbeing interfered with, by the Dervishes. We may be sure that Fadil is\nnot allowing his men to roam over the country, for there can be little\ndoubt that a good many of them would desert, as soon as they got fairly\nbeyond his camp.\"\n\n\"I don't think there is any fear of that, sir; and as my camels will\nhave had ten days' rest, I should have very little fear of being\novertaken, even if they did sight us.\"\n\n\"We are off again, Zaki,\" Gregory said. \"We will go down to the yard\nwhere the animals we captured are kept, and choose a couple of good\ndonkeys. I am to carry a despatch to Omdurman, and as time is precious,\nwe will make a straight line across the desert; it will save us fifty\nor sixty miles.\"\n\n\"I am glad to be gone, Master. The smells here are as bad as they were\nat Omdurman, when we went in there.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am very glad to be off, too.\"\n\nAn hour later they started, and arrived at Mugatta at eight o'clock in\nthe evening. The native with whom the camels had been left had taken\ngood care of them; and, after rewarding him and taking a meal, Gregory\ndetermined to start at once. The stars were bright, and there was quite\nlight enough for the camels to travel.\n\nThe water was emptied from the skins, and filled again. They had\nbrought with them sufficient food for four days' travel, and a sack of\ngrain for the camels. An hour after arriving at the village they again\nstarted.\n\n\"We will follow the river bank, till we get past the country where the\nbushes are so thick, and then strike west by north. I saw, by Colonel\nParsons' map, that that is about the line we should take.\"\n\nThey left the river before they reached El Fasher, and continued their\njourney all night, and onward till the sun was well up. Then they\nwatered the camels (they had, this time, brought with them a large half\ngourd for the purpose), ate a good meal themselves; and, after placing\ntwo piles of grain before the camels, lay down and slept until five\no'clock in the afternoon.\n\n\"We ought to be opposite Omdurman, tomorrow morning. I expect we shall\nstrike the river, tonight. I have kept our course rather to the west of\nthe direct line, on purpose. It would be very awkward if we were to\nmiss it. I believe the compass is right, and I have struck a match\nevery hour to look at it; but a very slight deviation would make a big\ndifference, at the end of a hundred and fifty miles.\"\n\nIt was just midnight when they saw the river before them.\n\n\"We can't go wrong now, Zaki.\"\n\n\"That is a comfort. How many miles are we above its junction with the\nWhite Nile?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nThey rode steadily on, and day was just breaking when he exclaimed:\n\n\"There are some buildings opposite. That must be Khartoum. We shall be\nopposite Omdurman in another hour.\"\n\nSoon after six o'clock, they rode down to the river bank opposite the\ntown; and, in answer to their signals, a large native boat was rowed\nacross to them. After some trouble the camels were got on board, and in\na quarter of an hour they landed.\n\n\"Take the camels up to my house, Zaki. I must go and report myself, at\nheadquarters.\"\n\nGeneral Rundle had not yet gone out, and on Gregory sending in his\nname, he was at once admitted.\n\n\"So you are back, Mr. Hilliard!\" the General said. \"I am heartily glad\nto see you, for it was a very hazardous mission that you undertook.\nWhat news have you?\"\n\n\"This is Colonel Parsons' report.\"\n\nBefore reading the long report, the General said, \"Tell me, in a few\nwords, what happened.\"\n\n\"I overtook Colonel Parsons at Mugatta, on the third morning after\nleaving. We were attacked by nearly four thousand Dervishes, five miles\nfrom Gedareh. After a sharp fight they were defeated, and we occupied\nthe town without resistance. Four days later, Fadil came up with his\narmy and attacked the town; but was driven off, with a loss of five\nhundred men. He is now eight miles from the town. The place is\nunhealthy and, although it can be defended, Colonel Parsons has asked\nfor reinforcements, to enable him to attack Fadil.\"\n\n\"That is good news, indeed. We have all been extremely anxious, for\nthere was no doubt that Colonel Parsons' force was wholly inadequate\nfor the purpose. How long is it since you left?\"\n\n\"About forty-six hours, sir.\"\n\n\"Indeed! That seems almost impossible, Mr. Hilliard.\"\n\n\"We started at eleven o'clock in the morning, sir, and rode on donkeys\nto Mugatta, where I had left my camels; arrived there at eight, and\nstarted an hour later on the camels. We rode till nine o'clock the next\nday, halted till five, and have just arrived here. The camels were\nexcellent beasts, and travelled a good six miles an hour. I did not\npress them, as I knew that, if we arrived opposite the town at night,\nwe should have difficulty in getting across the river.\"\n\n\"It was a great ride, a great achievement! You must be hungry, as well\nas tired. I will tell my man to get you some breakfast, at once. You\ncan eat it, while I read this despatch. Then I may have a few questions\nto ask you. After that, you had better turn in till evening.\"\n\nGregory enjoyed his breakfast, with the luxuries of tinned fruit, after\nhis rough fare for the past fortnight. When he went to the General's\nroom again, the latter said:\n\n\"Colonel Parsons' despatches are very full, and I think I quite\nunderstand the situation. No praise is too high for the conduct of his\nofficers and troops. All seemed to have behaved equally well, and he\nmentions the gallant part you took in the defence of the baggage, with\nCaptain Ruthven and the doctor, and only some thirty-four soldiers of\nthe camel corps.\n\n\"Now, I will not detain you longer. I hope you will dine with me this\nevening. I should like to hear more of the affair.\"\n\nReturning to his hut, Gregory found that Zaki had already got his bed,\nand other things, from the store; and he was just about to boil the\nkettle.\n\n\"I have breakfasted, Zaki. Here is a dollar. Go to one of those big\nshops, and buy anything you like, and have a good meal. Then you had\nbetter take the camels across to Azim's camp. I shall not want you\nthen, till evening.\"\n\nNo time was lost. Three battalions and a half of Soudanese were sent up\nthe Blue Nile, in steamers, and the garrisons stationed at several\npoints on the river were also taken on board. Three companies of camel\ncorps marched along the bank, and arrived at Abu Haraz, a hundred and\nthirty miles up the river, in fifty-six hours after starting. Five\nhundred baggage camels were also sent up. As the distance from Gedareh\nto this point was a hundred miles, and as water was only to be found at\none point, it was necessary to carry up a supply for the troops.\n\nColonel Collinson, who was in command, pushed forward at once with the\n12th Soudanese and the camel corps. When Fadil heard of their approach,\nhe made a night attack on Gedareh. This, however, was easily repulsed\nby the garrison. He then broke up his camp and marched away, intending\nto cross the Blue Nile, and join the Khalifa.\n\nHis troops were greatly demoralized by their failures, and in spite of\nthe precautions he took, the Darfur Sheik, with five hundred of his\nmen, succeeded in effecting his escape; and at once joined us,\nactively, in the further operations against Fadil. As there was no\nfurther danger, the Soudanese marched back again and joined the other\nbattalions, the garrisons on the river were re-established, and part of\nthe force returned to Omdurman.\n\nThe Sirdar had returned from Fashoda before Gregory came back, and had\nleft almost immediately for Cairo. On the day after Gregory's return,\nhe had a sharp attack of fever; the result partly of the evil smells at\nGedareh, heightened by the fact that the present was the fever season,\nin the Blue Nile country.\n\n\n\nChapter 22: The Crowning Victory.\n\n\nIt was eight weeks before he recovered, and even then the doctor said\nthat he was not fit for any exertion. He learned that on the 22nd of\nOctober, Colonel Lewis, with two companies of the camel corps and three\nsquadrons of Lancers, had started from Omdurman to visit the various\nvillages between the White and Blue Niles; to restore order, and\nproclaim that the authority of the Khedive was established there. On\nthe 7th of November, following the Blue Nile up, he reached Karkoj, but\na short distance below the point at which the navigation of the river\nceased. He had come in contact with a portion of Fadil's force, but\nnothing could be done, in the thick undergrowth in which the latter was\nlurking; and he therefore remained, waiting for the next move on the\npart of the Dervish commander, while the gunboats patrolled the Blue\nriver up to Rosaires.\n\nSix weeks passed. His force, and all the garrisons on the river,\nsuffered severely from heat, thirty percent of the troops being down\ntogether. The cavalry had suffered particularly heavily. Of the four\nhundred and sixty men, ten had died and four hundred and twenty were\nreported unfit for duty, a month after their arrival at Karkoj; while\nof the thirty white officers on the Blue Nile, only two escaped an\nattack of fever.\n\nAt the end of the month, Colonel Lewis was joined by the Darfur Sheik\nand three hundred and fifty of his men. He had had many skirmishes with\nDervish parties, scouring the country for food, and his arrival was\nvery welcome.\n\nGregory was recommended to take a river trip, to recover his health;\nand left on a steamer going up with stores, and some small\nreinforcements, to Colonel Lewis. They arrived at Karkoj on the 14th of\nDecember, and learned that the little garrison at Rosaires had been\nattacked by the Dervishes.\n\nThe fifty fever-stricken men who formed the garrison would have had no\nchance of resisting the attack, but fortunately they had, that very\nmorning, been reinforced by two hundred men of the 10th Soudanese, and\ntwo Maxims; and the Dervishes were repulsed, with considerable loss.\nTwo companies of the same battalion had reinforced Colonel Lewis, who\nmarched, on the day after receiving the news, to Rosaires. The gunboat\nwent up to that point, and remained there for some days.\n\nGregory went ashore, as soon as the boat arrived, and saw Colonel\nLewis, to whom he was well known.\n\n\"I am supposed to be on sick leave, sir; but I feel quite strong now,\nand shall be glad to join you, if you will have me.\"\n\n\"I can have no possible objection, Mr. Hilliard. I know that you did\ngood service with Colonel Parsons, and it is quite possible that we\nshall find ourselves in as tight a place as he was. So many of our\nwhite officers have been sent down, with fever, that I am very\nshort-handed, and shall be glad if you will temporarily serve as my\nassistant.\"\n\nOn the 20th, the news came that Fadil was crossing the river at\nDakhila, twenty miles farther to the south. He himself had crossed, and\nthe women and children had been taken over on a raft. On the 22nd, the\nDarfur Sheik was sent off up the west bank, to harass the Dervishes who\nhad already crossed. On the 24th two gunboats arrived, with two hundred\nmore men of the 10th Soudanese, and a small detachment of the 9th.\n\nOn the following day the little force started, at five in the\nafternoon; and, at eleven at night, halted at a little village. At\nthree in the morning they again advanced, and at eight o'clock came in\ncontact with the Dervish outposts. Colonel Lewis had already learned\nthat, instead of half the Dervish force having crossed, only one\ndivision had done so, and that he had by far the greater part of\nFadil's army opposed to him.\n\nIt was a serious matter to attack some four or five thousand men, with\nso small a force at his disposal; for he had but half the 10th\nSoudanese, a handful of the 9th, and two Maxim guns. As to the Darfur\nirregulars, no great reliance could be placed upon them.\n\nAs the force issued from the wood through which they had been marching,\nthey saw the river in front of them. In its midst rose a large island,\na mile and a quarter long, and more than three-quarters of a mile wide.\nThere were clumps of sand hills upon it. They had learned that the\nintervening stream was rapid, but not deep; while that on the other\nside of the island was very deep, with a precipitous bank.\n\nIt was upon this island that Fadil's force was established. The\nposition was a strong one--the sand hills rose from an almost flat\nplain, a thousand yards away; and this would have to be crossed by the\nassailants, without any shelter whatever. The Dervishes were bound to\nfight their hardest, as there was no possibility of escape, if\ndefeated.\n\nAt nine o'clock the Soudanese and irregulars lined the bank and opened\nfire, while the two Maxims came into action. The Dervishes replied\nbriskly, and it was soon evident that, at so long a range, they could\nnot be driven from their position. Several fords were found, and the\nirregulars, supported by a company of the 10th, crossed the river, and\ntook up a position two hundred yards in advance, to cover the passage\nof the rest. These crossed with some difficulty, for the water was\nthree and a half feet deep, and the current very strong; and they were,\nmoreover, exposed to the fire of Fadil's riflemen, from the high cliff\non the opposite bank.\n\nColonel Lewis, determined to turn the left flank of the Dervishes, kept\nalong the river's edge until he reached the required position; then\nwheeled the battalion into line, and advanced across the bare shingle\nagainst the sand hills. Major Ferguson, with one company, was detached\nto attack a knoll on the right, held by two hundred Dervishes. The\nremaining four companies, under Colonel Mason, kept straight on towards\nthe main position.\n\nA very heavy fire was concentrated upon them, not only from the sand\nhills, but from Fadil's riflemen. The Soudanese fell fast, but held on,\nincreasing their pace to a run; until they reached the foot of the\nfirst sandhill, where they lay down in shelter to take breath. A\nquarter of the force had already fallen, and their doctor, Captain\nJennings, remained out in the open, binding up their wounds, although\nexposed to a continuous fire.\n\nThis halt was mistaken by the Dervishes, who thought that the courage\nof the Soudanese was exhausted; and Fadil, from the opposite bank,\nsounded the charge on drum and bugle; and the whole Dervish force, with\nbanners waving and exultant shouts, poured down to annihilate their\nassailants.\n\nBut the Soudanese, led by Colonels Lewis and Mason, who were\naccompanied by Gregory, leapt to their feet, ran up the low bank behind\nwhich they were sheltering, and opened a terrible fire. The Dervishes\nwere already close at hand, and every shot told among them. Astonished\nat so unlooked-for a reception, and doubtless remembering the heavy\nloss they had suffered at Gedareh, they speedily broke. Like dogs\nslipped from their leash, the black troops dashed on with triumphant\nshouts, driving the Dervishes from sandhill to sandhill, until the\nlatter reached the southern end of the island.\n\nHere the Soudanese were joined by the irregulars who had first crossed,\nand a terrible fire was maintained, from the sand hills, upon the\ncrowded mass on the bare sand, cut off from all retreat by the deep\nriver. Some tried to swim across, to join their friends on the west\nbank. A few succeeded in doing so, among them the Emir who had given\nbattle to Colonel Parsons' force, near Gedareh.\n\nMany took refuge from the fire by standing in the river, up to their\nnecks. Some four hundred succeeded in escaping, by a ford, to a small\nisland lower down; but they found no cover there, and after suffering\nheavily from the musketry fire, the survivors, three hundred strong,\nsurrendered.\n\nMajor Ferguson's company, however, was still exposed to a heavy fire,\nturned upon them by the force on the other side of the river. He\nhimself was severely wounded, and a third of his men hit. The Maxims\nwere accordingly carried over the river to the island, and placed so as\nto command the west bank, which they soon cleared of the riflemen.\n\nOver five hundred Arabs lay dead on the two islands. Two thousand one\nhundred and seventy-five fighting men surrendered, and several hundred\nwomen and children. Fadil, with the force that had escaped, crossed the\ndesert to Rung, on the White Nile, where on the 22nd of January they\nsurrendered to the English gunboats; their leader, with ten or twelve\nof his followers only, escaping to join the Khalifa.\n\nOur casualties were heavy. Twenty-five non-commissioned officers and\nmen were killed; one British officer, six native officers, and one\nhundred and seventeen non-commissioned officers and men wounded of the\n10th Soudanese, out of a total strength of five hundred and eleven. The\nremaining casualties were among the irregulars.\n\nNever was there a better proof of the gallantry of the black regiments\nof Egypt; for, including the commander and medical officer, there were\nbut five British officers, and two British sergeants, to direct and\nlead them.\n\nAfter the battle of Rosaires, there was a lull in the fighting on the\neast of the White Nile. The whole country had been cleared of the\nDervishes, and it was now time for the Sirdar, who had just returned\nfrom England, to turn his attention to the Khalifa. The latter was\nknown to be near El Obeid, where he had now collected a force, of whose\nstrength very different reports were received.\n\nGregory, whose exertions in the fight, and the march through the scrub\nfrom Karkoj, had brought on a slight return of fever, went down in the\ngunboat, with the wounded, to Omdurman. Zaki was with him, but as a\npatient. He had been hit through the leg, while charging forward with\nthe Soudanese. At Omdurman, Gregory fell into regular work again. So\nmany of the officers of the Egyptian battalions had fallen in battle,\nor were down with fever, that Colonel Wingate took him as his\nassistant, and his time was now spent in listening to the stories of\ntribesmen; who, as soon as the Khalifa's force had passed, had brought\nin very varying accounts of his strength. Then there were villagers who\nhad complaints to make of robbery, of ill usage--for this the Arab\nirregulars, who had been disbanded after the capture of Omdurman, were\nlargely responsible. Besides these, there were many petitions by\nfugitives, who had returned to find their houses occupied, and their\nland seized by others.\n\nGregory was constantly sent off to investigate and decide in these\ndisputes, and was sometimes away for a week at a time. Zaki had\nrecovered rapidly and, as soon as he was able to rise, accompanied his\nmaster; who obtained valuable assistance from him as, while Gregory was\nhearing the stories of witnesses, Zaki went quietly about the villages,\ntalking to the old men and women, and frequently obtained evidence that\nshowed that many of the witnesses were perjured; and so enabled his\nmaster to give decisions which astonished the people by their justness.\n\nIndeed, the reports of the extraordinary manner in which he seemed able\nto pick out truth from falsehood, and to decide in favour of the\nrightful claimant, spread so rapidly from village to village, that\nclaimants who came in to Colonel Wingate often requested, urgently,\nthat the young Bimbashi should be sent out to investigate the matter.\n\n\"You seem to be attaining the position of a modern Solomon, Hilliard,\"\nthe Colonel said one day, with a smile. \"How do you do it?\"\n\nGregory laughed, and told him the manner in which he got at the truth.\n\n\"An excellent plan,\" he said, \"and one which it would be well to adopt,\ngenerally, by sending men beforehand to a village. The only objection\nis, that you could not rely much more upon the reports of your spies\nthan on those of the villagers. The chances are that the claimant who\ncould bid highest would receive their support.\"\n\nMatters were quiet until the Sirdar returned from England, and\ndetermined to make an attempt to capture the Khalifa, whose force was\nreported not to exceed one thousand men. Two squadrons of Egyptian\ncavalry and a Soudanese brigade, two Maxims, two mule guns, and a\ncompany of camel corps were placed under the command of Colonel\nKitchener. The great difficulty was the lack of water along the route\nto be traversed. Camels were brought from the Atbara and the Blue Nile;\nand the whole were collected at Kawa, on the White Nile. They started\nfrom that point, but the wells were found to be dry; and the force had\nto retrace its steps, and to start afresh from Koli, some forty miles\nfarther up the river.\n\nThey endured great hardships, for everything was left behind save the\nclothes the men and officers stood in, and one hundred rounds of\nammunition each; only one pint of water being allowed per head. The\ncountry was a desert, covered with interlacing thorn bushes. An eight\ndays' march brought the force to a village which was considered sacred,\nas it contained the grave of the Khalifa's father, and the house where\nthe Khalifa himself had been born.\n\nThree days later they reached the abandoned camp of the Khalifa, a wide\ntract that had been cleared of bush. A great multitude of dwellings,\nconstructed of spear grass, stretched away for miles; and at the very\nlowest compilation it had contained twenty thousand people, of which it\nwas calculated that from eight thousand to ten thousand must have been\nfighting men, ten times as many as had before been reported to be with\nthe Khalifa. A reconnaissance showed that a large army was waiting to\ngive battle, on a hill which was of great strength, surrounded by deep\nravines and pools of water.\n\nThe position was an anxious one. The total force was about fourteen\nhundred strong, and a defeat would mean annihilation; while even a\nvictory would scarcely secure the capture of the Khalifa; who, with his\nprincipal emirs, Osman Digna, El Khatim the Sheik of El Obeid, the\nSheik Ed Din, and Fadil, would be able to gallop off if they saw the\nbattle going against them. Colonel Kitchener had the wisdom to decide\nagainst risking the destruction of his followers by an assault against\nso great a force, posted in so strong a position. It was a deep\nmortification to him to have to retreat, and the soldiers were bitterly\ndisappointed; but their commander felt that, brave as the Egyptians and\nSoudanese had shown themselves, the odds against victory were too\ngreat. After a terrible march, and great sufferings from thirst and\nscanty food, the force reached Koli on the 5th of February, and were\nconveyed in steamers down to Omdurman.\n\nAfter this somewhat unfortunate affair, which naturally added to the\nprestige of the Khalifa, the months passed uneventfully; but, late in\nOctober, preparations were made for an attack upon a large scale\nagainst the Khalifa's camp, and eight thousand men were concentrated at\nKarla, on the White Nile. It was known that the Khalifa was at Gedir,\neighty miles away; but after proceeding half the distance, it was found\nthat he had marched away, and the column returned, as pursuit through a\ndensely-wooded country would have been impracticable.\n\nThe gunboats had gone up the river with a flying column, under Colonel\nLewis, to check any of the Khalifa's forces that attempted to establish\nthemselves on the banks. Mounted troops and transport were at once\nconcentrated, and Colonel Wingate was sent up to take command. The\nforce consisted of a brigade of infantry, under Colonel Lewis, with the\n9th and 13th Soudanese, an irregular Soudanese battalion, a company of\nthe 2nd Egyptians, six companies of camel corps, a squadron of cavalry,\na field battery, six Maxims, and detachments of medical and supply\ndepartments, with a camel transport train to carry rations and three\ndays' water--in all, three thousand seven hundred men.\n\nOn the afternoon of the 21st of November, the column moved forward and,\nfavoured by a bright moonlight, made a march of fifteen miles; the\ncavalry scouting two miles in front, the flanks and rear being covered\nby the camel corps. Native reports had brought in information that\nFadil, who had been raiding the country, was now in the neighbourhood,\non his way to rejoin the main Dervish army, which was lying near Gadi.\n\nThe cavalry pushed forward at dawn, and found that Fadil had retreated,\nleaving a quantity of grain behind. A sick Dervish who had remained\nthere said that the Dervishes had moved to a point seven miles away.\nThe cavalry, camel corps, and some of the guns advanced, and seized a\nposition within three hundred yards of the Dervish encampment, on which\nthey immediately opened fire.\n\nThe rest of the guns were at once pushed forward, to reinforce them,\nand arrived in time to assist them in repulsing a fierce attack of the\nDervishes. Owing to the nature of the ground, these were able to\napproach to within sixty yards of the guns, before coming under their\nfire. They were then mowed down by the guns and Maxims, and the\nmusketry fire of the camel corps; to which was added that of the\ninfantry brigade, when they arrived. This was too much even for Dervish\nvalour to withstand, and they fled back to their camp.\n\nThe British force then advanced. They met with but little opposition\nand, as they entered the camp, they saw the enemy in full flight. The\ninfantry followed them for a mile and a half, while the cavalry and\ncamel corps kept up the pursuit for five miles.\n\nFadil's camp, containing a large amount of grain and other stores, fell\ninto the hands of the captors; with a number of prisoners, including\nwomen and children, and animals. Four hundred Dervishes had fallen,\ngreat numbers had been wounded, while the British casualties amounted\nto a native officer of the camel corps dangerously wounded, one man\nkilled, and three wounded.\n\nGregory had accompanied Colonel Wingate, and acted as one of his staff\nofficers. He had, of course, brought his horse with him. It was an\nexcellent animal, and had been used by him in all his excursions from\nOmdurman.\n\n\"That is rather a different affair from the fight on the Atbara, Zaki,\"\nhe said, when the force gathered in Fadil's camp, after the pursuit was\nrelinquished; \"the Dervishes fought just as bravely, but in one case\nthey had a strong position to defend, while today they took the\noffensive. It makes all the difference.\"\n\n\"I am glad to have seen some fighting again, Master, for it has been\ndull work stopping ten months in Omdurman, with nothing to do but ride\nabout the country, and decide upon the villagers' quarrels.\"\n\n\"It has been useful work, Zaki, and I consider myself very fortunate in\nbeing so constantly employed. I was desperately afraid that Colonel\nWingate would leave me there, and I was greatly relieved when he told\nme that I was to come with him. It is a fortunate thing that we have\nbeaten our old enemy, Fadil, here. In the first place because, if the\nthree or four thousand men he had with him had joined the Khalifa, it\nwould have given us harder work in tomorrow's fight; and in the next\nplace his arrival, with his followers who have escaped, at the\nKhalifa's camp, is not likely to inspirit the Dervishes there.\"\n\nGregory was occupied, all the afternoon, in examining the prisoners.\nThey affirmed that they had left the former camp, three days before,\nwith the intention of proceeding to Gedid; where Fadil was to join the\nKhalifa with captured grain, when the whole Dervish force was to march\nnorth.\n\nThe troops slept during the afternoon, and in the evening set out for\nGedid, which they reached at ten o'clock the next morning. A Dervish\ndeserter reported that the Khalifa was encamped seven miles to the\nsoutheast. Fortunately, a pool with sufficient water for the whole\nforce was found at Gedid; which was a matter of great importance, for\notherwise the expedition must have fallen back.\n\nIt was hoped that the Khalifa would now stand at bay, as our occupation\nof Gedid barred his advance north. Behind him was a waterless, and\ndensely wooded district. The capture of the grain on which he had\nrelied would render it impossible for him to remain long in his present\nposition, and his only chance of extricating himself was to stand and\nfight.\n\nAfter twelve hours' rest the troops were roused, and started a few\nminutes after midnight. The transport was left, under a strong guard,\nnear the water; with orders to follow, four hours later. The cavalry,\nwith two Maxims, moved in advance; and the camel corps on the flanks.\nThe ground was thickly wooded. In many places, a way had to be cut for\nthe guns.\n\nAt three o'clock news was received, from the cavalry, that the enemy's\ncamp was but three miles distant from the point which the infantry had\nreached; and that they and the Maxims had halted two miles ahead, at\nthe foot of some slightly rising ground; beyond which the scouts had,\non the previous day, discovered the main force of the enemy to be\nstationed. The infantry continued to advance, slowly and cautiously,\nmaking as little noise as possible.\n\nIt was soon evident, however, that in spite of their caution, the enemy\nwere aware of their approach, as there was an outburst of the beating\nof drums, and the blowing of war horns. This did not last long, but it\nwas enough to show that the Dervishes were not to be taken by surprise.\nWhen the infantry reached the spot where the cavalry were halted, the\nlatter's scouts were withdrawn and the infantry pickets thrown out, and\nthe troops then lay down to await daybreak.\n\nThe officers chatted together in low tones. There were but two hours\ntill dawn, and with the prospect of heavy fighting before them, none\nwere inclined to sleep. The question was whether the Dervishes would\ndefend their camp, or attack. The result of the battle of Omdurman\nshould have taught them that it was impossible to come to close\nquarters, in the face of the terrible fire of our rifles. Fadil could\ngive his experience at Gedareh, which would teach the same lesson. On\nthe other hand, the storming of the Dervish camp on the Atbara, and the\nfight at Rosaires, would both seem to show them that the assault of the\nEgyptian force was irresistible.\n\nAs Gregory had been present at all four of these battles, he was asked\nto give his opinion.\n\n\"I think that they will attack,\" he said. \"The Dervish leaders rely\nupon the enthusiasm of their followers; and, in almost all the battles\nwe have fought here, they have rushed forward to the assault. It was so\nin all the fights down by the Red Sea. It was so in the attacks on Lord\nWolseley's desert column. It succeeded against Hicks's and Baker's\nforces; and even now they do not seem to have recognized that the\nEgyptians, whom they once despised, have quite got over their dread of\nthem, and are able to face them steadily.\"\n\nThere was only the faintest light in the sky, when firing broke out in\nfront. Everyone leapt to his feet, and stood listening intently. Was it\nmerely some Dervish scouts, who had come in contact with our pickets,\nor was it an attacking force?\n\nThe firing increased in volume, and was evidently approaching. The\npickets, then, were being driven in, and the Dervishes were going to\nattack. The men were ordered to lie down, in the position in which they\nwere to fight. In five minutes after the first shot all were ready for\naction, the pickets had run in; and, in the dim light, numbers of dark\nfigures could be made out.\n\nThe guns and Maxims at once spoke out, while the infantry fired\nvolleys. It was still too dark to make out the movements of the enemy,\nbut their reply to our fire came louder and louder on our left, and it\nwas apparent that the intention of the Dervishes was to turn that flank\nof our position.\n\nColonel Wingate sent Gregory, to order the guns to turn their fire more\nin that direction; and other officers ordered our right to advance\nsomewhat, while the left were slightly thrown back, and pushed farther\nout. The light was now getting brighter, and heavy bodies of Dervishes,\nshouting and firing, rushed forward; but they were mown down by grape\nfrom our guns, a storm of Maxim bullets, and the steady volleys of the\ninfantry. They wavered for a moment, and then gradually fell back.\n\nThe bugles sounded the advance and, with a cheer, our whole line moved\nforward down the gentle slope; quickening their pace as the enemy\nretired before them, and still keeping up a heavy fire towards the\nclump of trees that concealed the Dervish camp from sight. The enemy's\nfire had now died out. At twenty-five minutes past six the \"cease fire\"\nwas sounded and, as the troops advanced, it was evident that resistance\nwas at an end.\n\nAs they issued through the trees, many Dervishes ran forward and\nsurrendered, and thousands of women and children were found in the\ncamp. Happily, none of these had been injured, as a slight swell in the\nground had prevented our bullets from falling among them. Numbers of\nDervishes who had passed through now turned and surrendered, and the\ncavalry and camel corps started in pursuit.\n\nGregory had learned, from the women, that the Emir El Khatim, with a\nnumber of his trained men from El Obeid, had passed through the camp in\ngood order, but that none of the other emirs had been seen; and the 9th\nSoudanese stated that, as they advanced, they had come upon a number of\nchiefs lying together, a few hundred yards in advance of our first\nposition. One of the Arab sheiks of the irregulars was sent to examine\nthe spot, and reported that the Khalifa himself, and almost all his\ngreat emirs, lay there dead.\n\nWith the Khalifa were Ali Wad, Helu, Fadil, two of his brothers, the\nMahdi's son, and many other leaders. Behind them lay their dead horses,\nand one of the men still alive said that the Khalifa, having failed in\nhis attempt to advance over the crest, had endeavoured to turn our\nposition; but, seeing his followers crushed by our fire and retiring,\nand after making an ineffectual attempt to rally them, he recognized\nthat the day was lost; and, calling on his emirs to dismount, seated\nhimself on his sheepskin, as is the custom of Arab chiefs who disdain\nto surrender. The emirs seated themselves round him, and all met their\ndeath unflinchingly, the greater part being mowed down by the volleys\nfired by our troops, as they advanced.\n\nGregory went up to Colonel Wingate.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, but I find that Khatim, and probably his son,\nwho were so kind to my father at El Obeid, have retired with a fighting\nforce. Have I your permission to ride forward, and call upon them to\nsurrender?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Hilliard, there has been bloodshed enough.\"\n\nBeing well mounted, Gregory overtook the cavalry and camel corps,\nbefore they had gone two miles; as they were delayed by disarming the\nDervishes, who were coming in in large numbers. Half a mile away, a\nsmall body of men were to be seen keeping together, firing\noccasionally. Their leader's flag was flying, and Gregory learned, from\na native, that it was Khatim's. The cavalry were on the point of\ngathering for a charge, as he rode up to the officer in command.\n\n\"I have Colonel Wingate's orders, sir, to ride forward and try to\npersuade the emir to surrender. He does not wish any further loss of\nlife.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir. I am sure we have killed enough of the poor beggars. I\nhope he will give in.\"\n\nAs Gregory neared the party, which was some five hundred strong,\nseveral shots were fired at him. He waved a white handkerchief, and the\nfiring ceased. Two emirs rode forward to meet him.\n\n\"I have come, sir, from the English General, to ask you to surrender.\nYour cause is lost. The Khalifa is dead, and most of his principal\nemirs. He is anxious that there should be no further loss of blood.\"\n\n\"We can die, sir, as the others have done,\" the elder emir, a man of\nsome sixty years old, said sternly.\n\n\"But that would not avail your cause, sir. I solicited this mission, as\nI owe much to you.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\" the chief asked.\n\n\"I am the son of that white man whom you so kindly treated, at El\nObeid, where he saved the life of your son Abu;\" and he bowed to the\nyounger emir.\n\n\"Then he escaped?\" the latter exclaimed.\n\n\"No, sir. He was killed at Hebbeh, when the steamer in which he was\ngoing down from Khartoum was wrecked there; but I found his journal, in\nwhich he told the story of your kindness to him. I can assure you that\nyou shall be well treated, if you surrender; and those of your men who\nwish to do so will be allowed to return to El Obeid. I feel sure that\nwhen I tell our General how kindly you acted, to the sole white officer\nwho escaped from the battle, you and your son will be treated with the\ngreatest consideration.\"\n\n\"I owe more to your father than he did to me,\" Abu exclaimed. \"He saved\nmy life, and did many great services to us.\n\n\"What say you, Father? I am ready to die if you will it; but as the\nKhalifa is dead, and the cause of Mahdism lost, I see no reason, and\nassuredly no disgrace, in submitting to the will of Allah.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" Khatim said. \"I have never thought of surrendering to the\nTurks, but as it is the will of Allah, I will do so.\"\n\nHe turned to his men.\n\n\"It is useless to fight further,\" he said. \"The Khalifa is dead. It\nwere better to return to your wives and families than to throw away\nyour lives. Lay down your arms. None will be injured.\"\n\nIt was with evident satisfaction that the Arabs laid musket and spear\non the ground. They would have fought to the death, had he ordered\nthem, for they greatly loved their old chief; but as it was his order,\nthey gladly complied with it, as they saw that they had no chance of\nresisting the array of cavalry and camel corps, gathered less than half\na mile away.\n\n\"If you will ride back with me,\" Gregory said to the emir, \"I will\npresent you to the General. The men had better follow. I will ride\nforward, and tell the officer commanding the cavalry that you have\nsurrendered, and that the men approaching are unarmed.\"\n\nHe cantered back to the cavalry.\n\n\"They have all surrendered, sir,\" he said. \"They have laid down their\narms at the place where they stood, and are going back to camp, to\nsurrender to Colonel Wingate.\"\n\n\"I am glad of it. My orders are to push on another three miles. On our\nreturn the camel corps shall collect the arms, and bring them in.\"\n\nGregory rode back to the emirs, who were slowly crossing the plain, but\nwho halted as the cavalry dashed on.\n\n\"Now, Emirs,\" he said, \"we can ride quietly back to camp.\"\n\n\"You have not taken our arms,\" Khatim said.\n\n\"No, Emir, it is not for me to ask for them. It is the General to whom\nyou surrender, not me.\"\n\n\"I mourn to hear of the death of your father,\" Abu said, as they rode\nin. \"He was a good man, and a skilful hakim.\"\n\n\"He speaks always in the highest terms of you, Emir, in his journal,\nand tells how he performed that operation on your left arm, which was\nnecessary to save your life; but did so with great doubt, fearing that,\nnever having performed one before, he might fail to save your life.\"\n\n\"I have often wondered what became of him,\" Abu said. \"I believed that\nhe had got safely into Khartoum, and I enquired about him when we\nentered. When I found that he was not among the killed, I trusted that\nhe might have escaped. I grieve much to hear that he was killed while\non his way down.\"\n\n\"Such was the will of Allah,\" Khatim said. \"He preserved him at the\nbattle, He preserved him in the town, He enabled him to reach Khartoum;\nbut it was not His will that he should return to his countrymen. I say,\nwith Abu, that he was a good man; and while he remained with us, was\never ready to use his skill for our benefit. It was Allah's will that\nhis son should, after all these years, come to us; for assuredly, if\nany other white officer had asked us to surrender, I would have\nrefused.\"\n\n\"Many strange things happen by the will of God,\" Gregory said. \"It was\nwonderful that, sixteen years after his death, I should find my\nfather's journal at Hebbeh, and learn the story of his escape after the\nbattle, and of his stay with you at El Obeid.\"\n\nGregory rode into camp between the two emirs. He paused for a minute,\nand handed over their followers to the officer in charge of the\nprisoners; and then went to the hut formerly occupied by the Khalifa,\nwhere Colonel Wingate had now established himself. Colonel Wingate came\nto the entrance.\n\n\"These are El Khatim and his son Abu, sir. They surrendered on learning\nthat I was the son of the British officer whom they had protected, and\nsheltered, for a year after the battle of El Obeid.\"\n\nThe two emirs had withdrawn their swords and pistols from their sashes;\nand, advancing, offered them to the Colonel. The latter did not offer\nto receive them.\n\n\"Keep them,\" he said. \"We can honour brave foes; and you and your\nfollowers were ready to fight and die, when all seemed lost. Still more\ndo I refuse to receive the weapons of the men who defended an English\nofficer, when he was helpless and a fugitive; such an act would, alone,\nensure good treatment at our hands. Your followers have surrendered?\"\n\n\"They have all laid down their arms,\" Khatim said.\n\n\"Do you give me your promise that you will no more fight against us?\"\n\n\"We do,\" Khatim replied. \"We have received our weapons back from you,\nand would assuredly not use them against our conquerors.\"\n\n\"In that case, Emir, you and your son are at liberty to depart, and\nyour men can return with you. There will, I trust, be no more fighting\nin the land. The Mahdi is dead. His successor proved a false prophet\nand is dead also. Mahdism is at an end, and now our object will be to\nrestore peace and prosperity to the land.\n\n\"In a short time, all the prisoners will be released. Those who choose\nwill be allowed to enter our service. The rest can return to their\nhomes. We bear no enmity against them. They fought under the orders of\ntheir chiefs, and fought bravely and well. When they return, I hope\nthey will settle down and cultivate the land; and undo, as far as may\nbe, the injuries they have inflicted upon it.\n\n\"I will write an order, Mr. Hilliard, to release at once the men you\nhave brought in. Then I will ask you to ride, with these emirs, to a\npoint where there will be no fear of their falling in with our\ncavalry.\"\n\n\"You are a generous enemy,\" Khatim said, \"and we thank you. We give in\nour allegiance to the Egyptian government, and henceforth regard\nourselves as its servants.\"\n\n\"See, Mr. Hilliard, that the party takes sufficient food with it for\ntheir journey to El Obeid.\"\n\nColonel Wingate stepped forward, and shook hands with the two emirs.\n\n\"You are no longer enemies,\" he said, \"and I know that, henceforth, I\nshall be able to rely upon your loyalty.\"\n\n\"We are beaten,\" Khatim said, as they walked away, each leading his\nhorse. \"You can fight like men, and we who thought ourselves brave have\nbeen driven before you, like dust before the wind. And now, when you\nare masters, you can forgive as we should never have done. You can\ntreat us as friends. You do not even take our arms, and we can ride\ninto El Obeid with our heads high.\"\n\n\"It will be good for the Soudan,\" Abu said. \"Your father told me,\noften, how peace and prosperity would return, were you ever to become\nour masters; and I felt that his words were true. Two hours ago I\nregretted that Allah had not let me die, so that I should not have\nlived to see our people conquered. Now, I am glad. I believe all that\nhe said, and that the Soudan will some day become, again, a happy\ncountry.\"\n\nKhatim's men were separated from the rest of the prisoners. Six days'\nsupply of grain, from the stores found in the camp, were handed over to\nthem; together with ten camels with water skins, and they started at\nonce on their long march. Gregory rode out for a couple of miles with\nthem, and then took leave of the two emirs.\n\n\"Come to El Obeid,\" Khatim said, \"and you shall be treated as a king.\nFarewell! And may Allah preserve you!\"\n\nSo they parted; and Gregory rode back to the camp, with a feeling of\nmuch happiness that he had been enabled, in some way, to repay the\nkindness shown to his dead father.\n\n\n\nChapter 23: An Unexpected Discovery.\n\n\nThe victory had been a decisive one, indeed. Three thousand prisoners,\ngreat quantities of rifles, swords, grain, and cattle had been\ncaptured; together with six thousand women and children. A thousand\nDervishes had been killed or wounded. All the most important emirs had\nbeen killed, and the Sheik Ed Din, the Khalifa's eldest son and\nintended successor, was, with twenty-nine other emirs, among the\nprisoners. Our total loss was four men killed, and two officers and\ntwenty-seven men wounded in the action.\n\n\"I am much obliged to you, Mr. Hilliard,\" Colonel Wingate said to him,\nthat evening, \"for the valuable services you have rendered, and shall\nhave the pleasure of including your name among the officers who have\nspecially distinguished themselves. As it was mentioned by General\nRundle and Colonel Parsons--by the former for undertaking the hazardous\nservice of carrying despatches to the latter, and by Colonel Parsons\nfor gallant conduct in the field--you ought to be sure of promotion,\nwhen matters are arranged here.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir! May I ask a favour?\n\n\"You know the outline of my story. I have learned, by the papers I\nobtained at Hebbeh, and others which I was charged not to open until I\nhad certain proof of my father's death, that the name under which he\nwas known was an assumed one. He had had a quarrel with his family; and\nas, when he came out to Egypt, he for a time took a subordinate\nposition, he dropped a portion of his name, intending to resume it when\nhe had done something that even his family could not consider was any\ndiscredit to it. I was myself unaware of the fact until, on returning\nto Omdurman from Hebbeh, I opened those papers. I continued to bear the\nname by which I am known, but as you are good enough to say that you\nwill mention me in despatches, I feel that I can now say that my real\nname is Gregory Hilliard Hartley.\"\n\n\"I quite appreciate your motives in adhering to your former name, Mr.\nHartley; and in mentioning your services under your new name, I will\nadd a note saying that your name mentioned in former despatches, for\ndistinguished services, had been erroneously given as Gregory Hilliard\nonly.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir!\"\n\nThat evening, when several of the officers were gathered in Colonel\nWingate's hut, the latter said, when one of them addressed Gregory as\nHilliard:\n\n\"That is not his full name, Colonel Hickman. For various family\nreasons, with which he has acquainted me, he has borne it hitherto; but\nhe will, in future, be known by his entire name, which is Gregory\nHilliard Hartley. I may say that the reasons he has given me for not\nhaving hitherto used the family name are, in my opinion, amply\nsufficient; involving, as they do, no discredit to himself; or his\nfather, a brave gentleman who escaped from the massacre of Hicks's\nforce at El Obeid; and finally died, with Colonel Stewart, at Hebbeh.\"\n\n\"I seem to know the name,\" Colonel Lewis said. \"Gregory Hilliard\nHartley! I have certainly either heard or seen it, somewhere. May I ask\nif your father bore the same Christian names?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I have it now!\" Colonel Lewis exclaimed, a minute or two later. \"I\nhave seen it in an advertisement. Ever since I was a boy, that name has\noccasionally been advertised for. Every two or three months, it\nappeared in the Times. I can see it plainly, now.\n\n\"'Five hundred pounds reward will be given for any information\nconcerning the present abode, or death, of Gregory Hilliard Hartley; or\nthe whereabouts of his issue, if any. He left England about the year\n1881. It is supposed that he went to the United States, or to one of\nthe British Colonies. Apply to Messieurs Tufton and Sons, solicitors,\nLincoln's Inn Fields.'\n\n\"Do you know when your father left England?\"\n\n\"He certainly left about that time. I am nineteen now, and I know that\nI was born a few weeks after he came out to Alexandria.\"\n\n\"Then there ought to be something good in store for you,\" Colonel\nWingate said. \"People don't offer a reward of five hundred pounds,\nunless something important hangs to it. Of course, there may be another\nof the same name, but it is hardly likely that anyone would bear the\ntwo same Christian names, as well as surname. Is it indiscreet to ask\nyou if you know anything about your father's family?\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir. Now that I have taken his name, I need have no\nhesitation in relating what I know of him. Previous to his leaving\nEngland, he married without his father's consent; and, failing to make\na living in England, he accepted a situation in Alexandria; which he\ngained, I may say, because he was an excellent Arabic scholar, as he\nhad spent two years in exploring tombs and monuments in Egypt. He was\nthe second son of the Honourable James Hartley; who was brother, and I\nbelieve heir, of the Marquis of Langdale, and I should think by this\ntime has succeeded to the title. At his death, my father's eldest\nbrother would, of course, succeed him.\"\n\n\"Then, my dear fellow,\" Colonel Mahon said, giving him a hearty slap on\nthe shoulder, \"allow me to congratulate you. I can tell you that the\ntitle has been in abeyance, for the past fourteen years. Everyone knows\nthe facts. Your grandfather died before the Marquis. Your uncle\nsucceeded him, lived only three years and, being unmarried, your father\nbecame the next Earl; and has been advertised for, in vain, ever since.\nAs, unhappily, your father is dead also, you are unquestionably the\nMarquis of Langdale.\"\n\nGregory looked round with a bewildered air. The news was so absolutely\nunexpected that he could hardly take it in.\n\n\"It seems impossible,\" he said at last.\n\n\"It is not only impossible, but a fact,\" the Colonel said. \"There is\nnothing very surprising in it. There were only two lives between your\nfather and the peerage; and as one was that of an old man, the second\nof a man certainly in the prime of life, but unmarried, why, the Jews\nwould have lent money on the chance.\n\n\"I fancy your uncle was a somewhat extravagant man. I remember he kept\na lot of race horses and so on, but he could not have dipped very\nseriously into the property. At any rate, there will be fourteen years'\naccumulations, which will put matters straight.\n\n\"I hope you have got papers that will prove you are your father's son,\nand that he was brother of the late Earl.\"\n\n\"I think there can be no difficulty about that,\" Gregory said. \"I have\nletters from both my parents, a copy of their marriage certificate, and\nof the registers of my birth and baptism. There are some persons in\nCairo who knew my father, and a good many who knew my mother.\"\n\n\"Then I should say that it would be quite safe sailing.\n\n\"I don't know, Lewis, whether you are not entitled to that five hundred\npounds.\"\n\n\"I am afraid not,\" the other laughed. \"Mr. Hartley; or rather, I should\nsay, the Earl; would have discovered it, himself. I only recognized the\nname, which plenty of people would have done, as soon as they saw it in\ndespatches.\"\n\n\"It will be a great disappointment to someone,\" Gregory said; \"if they\nhave been, for fourteen years, expecting to come in for this.\"\n\n\"You need not fret about that,\" another officer said. \"The next heir is\na distant cousin. He has been trying, over and over again, to get\nhimself acknowledged; but the courts would not hear of it, and told him\nthat it was no use applying, until they had proof of the death of your\nfather. I know all about it, because there was a howling young ass in\nthe regiment from which I exchanged. He was always giving himself airs,\non the strength of the title he expected to get; and if he is still in\nthe regiment, there will be general rejoicings at his downfall.\"\n\n\"Then I have met him,\" Gregory said. \"On the way up, he made himself\nvery unpleasant, and I heard from the other officers that he was\nextremely unpopular. The Major spoke very sharply to him, for the\noffensive tone in which he addressed me; and an officer sitting next to\nme said that he was terribly puffed, by his expectations of obtaining a\ntitle shortly, owing to the disappearance of those who stood before him\nin succession. Some of the officers chaffed him about it, then. I\nremember now that his name was Hartley; but as I had no idea, at that\ntime, that that was also mine, I never thought anything more about it,\nuntil now. As he was the only officer who has been in any way offensive\nto me, since I left Cairo nearly three years ago, certainly I would\nrather that he should be the sufferer, if I succeed in proving my right\nto the title, than anyone else.\"\n\n\"I don't think he will suffer, except in pride,\" the officer said. \"His\nfather, who was a very distant cousin of the Earl's, had gone into\ntrade and made a considerable fortune; so that the young fellow was a\ngreat deal better off than the vast majority of men in the army. It was\nthe airs he gave himself, on the strength of being able to indulge in\nan expenditure such as no one else in the regiment could attempt--by\nkeeping three or four race horses in training, and other follies--that\nhad more to do with his unpopularity, than his constant talk about the\npeerage he was so confident of getting.\"\n\n\"Of course you will go home to England, at once,\" Colonel Wingate said.\n\"The war is over now, and it would be rank folly for you to stay here.\nYou have got the address of the lawyers who advertised for you; and\nhave only to go straight to them, with your proofs in your hand, and\nthey will take all the necessary steps.\n\n\"I should say that it would facilitate matters if, as you go through\nCairo, you were to obtain statements or affidavits from some of the\npeople who knew your mother; stating that you are, as you claim to be,\nher son; and that she was the wife of the gentleman known as Gregory\nHilliard, who went up as an interpreter with Hicks. I don't say that\nthis would be necessary at all, for the letters you have would, in\nthemselves, go far to prove your case. Still, the more proofs you\naccumulate, the less likely there is of any opposition being offered to\nyour claim. Any papers or letters of your mother might contain\nsomething that would strengthen the case.\n\n\"It is really a pity, you know, when you have done so well out here,\nand would be certain to rise to a high post under the administration of\nthe province; (which will be taken in hand, in earnest, now), that you\nshould have to give it all up.\"\n\n\"I scarcely know whether to be pleased or sorry, myself, sir. At\npresent, I can hardly take in the change that this will make, or\nappreciate its advantages.\"\n\n\"You will appreciate them, soon enough,\" one of the others laughed. \"As\nlong as this war has been going on, one could put up with the heat, and\nthe dust, and the horrible thirst one gets, and the absence of anything\ndecent to drink; but now that it is all over, the idea of settling down\nhere, permanently, would be horrible; except to men--and there are such\nfellows--who are never happy, unless they are at work; to whom work is\neverything--meat, and drink, and pleasure. It would have to be\neverything, out here; for no one could ever think of marrying, and\nbringing a wife, to such a country as this. Women can hardly live in\nparts of India, but the worst station in India would be a paradise, in\ncomparison with the Soudan; though possibly, in time, Khartoum will be\nrebuilt and, being situated between two rivers, might become a possible\nplace--which is more than any other station in the Soudan can be--for\nladies.\"\n\n\"I am not old enough to take those matters into consideration,\" Gregory\nlaughed. \"I am not twenty, yet. Still, I do think that anyone\npermanently stationed, in the Soudan, would have to make up his mind to\nremain a bachelor.\"\n\nThe next morning, the greater portion of the prisoners were allowed to\nreturn to their homes. All the grain and other stores, found in the\ncamp, were divided among the women, who were advised to return to their\nnative villages; but those who had lost their husbands were told that\nthey might accompany the force to the river, and would be taken down to\nOmdurman, and given assistance for a time, until they could find some\nmeans of obtaining a subsistence.\n\nOn returning to Khartoum, Colonel Wingate, at Gregory's request, told\nLord Kitchener of the discovery that had been made; and said that he\nwished to return to England, at once. The next day, the Sirdar sent for\nGregory.\n\n\"Colonel Wingate has been speaking to me about you,\" he said, \"and I\ncongratulate you on your good fortune. In one respect, I am sorry; for\nyou have done so surprisingly well, that I had intended to appoint you\nto a responsible position in the Soudan Civil Service, which is now\nbeing formed. Colonel Wingate says that you naturally wish to resign\nyour present post, but I should advise you not to do so. The operation\nof the law in England is very uncertain. I trust that, in your case,\nyou will meet with but small difficulty in proving your birth; but\nthere may be some hitch in the matter, some missing link.\n\n\"I will, therefore, grant you six months' leave of absence. At the end\nof that time, you will see how you stand. If things have gone on well\nwith you, you can then send in your resignation. If, on the other hand,\nyou find yourself unable to prove your claim, it will still be open to\nyou to return here, and continue the career in which you have begun so\nwell.\"\n\n\"I am greatly obliged to you, sir, for your kindness; and should I fail\nin proving my claim, I shall gladly avail myself of your offer, at the\nend of the six months.\"\n\n\"Now, Zaki,\" he said, on returning to the hut, of which he had again\ntaken possession, \"we must have one more talk. I have told you about\nthe possible change in my position, and that I was shortly leaving for\nEngland. You begged me to take you with me, and I told you that if you\ndecided to go, I would do so. I shall be put in orders, tomorrow, for\nsix months' leave. If I succeed in proving my claim to a title, which\nis what you would call here an emirship, I shall not return. If I fail,\nI shall be back again, in six months. Now, I want you to think it over\nseriously, before you decide.\n\n\"Everything will be different there from what you are accustomed to.\nYou will have to dress differently, live differently, and be among\nstrangers. It is very cold there, in winter; and it is never what you\nwould call hot, in summer.\n\n\"It is not that I should not like to have you with me; we have been\ntogether, now, for three years. You saved my life at Atbara, and have\nalways been faithfully devoted to me. It is for your sake, not my own,\nthat I now speak.\"\n\n\"I will go with you, Master, if you will take me. I hope never to leave\nyou, till I die.\"\n\n\"Very well, Zaki, I am more than willing to take you. If I remain in\nEngland, you shall always be with me, if you choose to remain. But I\nshall then be able to give you a sum that will enable you to buy much\nland, and to hire men to work your sakies, to till your land, and to\nmake you what you would call a rich man here, should you wish to return\nat the end of the six months. If I return, you will, of course, come\nback with me.\"\n\nOn the following day, after having said goodbye to all his friends,\ndisposed of his horse and belongings, and drawn the arrears of his pay,\nGregory took his place in the train; for the railway had now been\ncarried to Khartoum.\n\nFour days later, he arrived at Cairo. His first step was to order\nEuropean clothes for Zaki, and a warm and heavily-lined greatcoat; for\nit was now the first week in December, and although delightful at\nCairo, it would be, to the native, bitterly cold in England.\n\nThen he went to the bank, and Mr. Murray, on hearing the story, made an\naffidavit at the British resident's; affirming that he had, for fifteen\nyears, known Mrs. Gregory Hilliard, and was aware that she was the\nwidow of Mr. Gregory Hilliard, who joined Hicks Pasha; and that Mr.\nGregory Hilliard, now claiming to be Mr. Gregory Hilliard Hartley, was\nher son. Mr. Gregory Hilliard, senior, had kept an account at the bank\nfor eighteen months; and had, on leaving, given instructions for Mrs.\nHilliard's cheques to be honoured. Mrs. Hilliard had received a pension\nfrom the Egyptian government, up to the date of her death, as his\nwidow; he having fallen in the service of the Khedive.\n\nGregory looked up his old nurse, whom he found comfortable and happy.\nShe also made an affidavit, to the effect that she had entered the\nservice of Mrs. Hilliard more than eighteen years before, as nurse to\nGregory Hilliard, then a child of a year old. She had been in her\nservice until her death, and she could testify that Gregory Hilliard\nHartley was the child she had nursed.\n\nAfter a stay of four days at Cairo, Gregory started for England. Even\nhe, who had heard of London from his mother, was astonished at its\nnoise, extent, and bustle; while Zaki was almost stupefied. He took two\nrooms at Cannon Street Hotel, for himself and servant, and next morning\nwent to the offices of Messieurs Tufton and Sons, the solicitors. He sent\nin his name as Mr. Gregory Hilliard Hartley.\n\nEven in the outer office, he heard an exclamation of surprise, as the\npiece of paper on which he had written his name was read. He was at\nonce shown in. Mr. Tufton looked at him, with a little surprise.\n\n\"I am the son of the gentleman for whom, I understand, you have\nadvertised for a long time.\"\n\n\"If you can prove that you are so, sir,\" Mr. Tufton said, wearily, \"you\nare the Marquis of Langdale--that is to say, if your father is\ndeceased.\n\n\"May I ask, to begin with, how it is that the advertisement has, for so\nmany years, remained unanswered?\"\n\n\"That is easily accounted for, sir. My father, being unable to obtain a\nsituation in England, accepted a very minor appointment in the house of\nMessieurs Partridge and Company, at Alexandria. This he obtained owing to\nhis knowledge of Arabic. He had been engaged, as you doubtless know,\nfor two years in explorations there. He did not wish it to be known\nthat he had been obliged to accept such a position, so he dropped his\nsurname, and went out as Gregory Hilliard. As the firm's establishment\nat Alexandria was burned, during the insurrection there, he went to\nCairo and obtained an appointment as interpreter to General Hicks. He\nescaped when the army of that officer was destroyed, at El Obeid; was a\nprisoner, for many months, at that town; and then escaped to Khartoum.\nHe came down in the steamer with Colonel Stewart. That steamer was\nwrecked at Hebbeh, and all on board, with one exception, were\nmassacred.\n\n\"My mother always retained some hope that he might have escaped, from\nhis knowledge of Arabic. She received a small pension from the Egyptian\ngovernment, for the loss of my father, and added to this by teaching in\nthe families of several Turkish functionaries. Three years ago she\ndied, and I obtained, through the kindness of Lord Kitchener, an\nappointment as interpreter in the Egyptian army. I was present at the\nfights of Abu Hamed, the Atbara, Omdurman, and the late victory by\nColonel Wingate. My name, as Gregory Hilliard, was mentioned in\ndespatches; and will be mentioned, again, in that sent by Colonel\nWingate, but this time with the addition of Hartley.\n\n\"It was only accidentally, on the night after that battle, that I\nlearned that my father was the heir to the Marquis of Langdale, and I\nthereupon obtained six months' leave, to come here.\"\n\n\"It is a singular story,\" the lawyer said, \"and if supported by proofs,\nthere can be no question that you are the Marquis, for whom we have\nbeen advertising, for many years.\"\n\n\"I think that I have ample proof, sir. Here is the certificate of my\nfather's marriage, and the copies of the registers of my birth and\nbaptism. Here is the journal of my father, from the time he was taken\nprisoner till his death. Here are his letter to my mother, and letters\nto his father, brother, and sisters, which were to be forwarded by her\nshould she choose to return to England. Here are two affidavits--the\none from a gentleman who has known me from childhood, the other from\nthe woman who nursed me, and who remained with our family till I\nreached the Soudan. Here also is a letter that I found among my\nmother's papers, written from Khartoum, in which my father speaks of\nresuming the name of Hartley, if things went well there.\"\n\n\"Then, sir,\" Mr. Tufton said, \"I think I can congratulate you upon\nobtaining the title; but at the same time, I will ask you to leave\nthese papers with me, for an hour. I will put everything else aside,\nand go through them. You understand, I am not doubting your word; but\nof course, it is necessary to ascertain the exact purport of these\nletters, and documents. If they are as you say, the evidence in favour\nof your claim would be overwhelming.\n\n\"Of course, it is necessary that we should be most cautious. We have,\nfor upwards of a hundred years, been solicitors to the family; and as\nsuch have contested all applications, from the junior branch of the\nfamily, that the title should be declared vacant by the death of the\nlast Marquis, who would be your uncle. We have been the more anxious to\ndo so, as we understand the next claimant is a young man of extravagant\nhabits, and in no way worthy to succeed to the title.\"\n\n\"I will return in an hour and a half, sir,\" Gregory said, rising. \"I\nmay say that the contents of this pocketbook, although intensely\ninteresting to myself, as a record of my father, do not bear upon the\ntitle. They are a simple record of his life, from the time when the\narmy of Hicks Pasha was destroyed, to the date of his own murder at\nHebbeh. The last entry was made before he landed. I mention this, as it\nmay save you time in going through the papers.\"\n\nGregory went out, and spent the time in watching the wonderful flow of\ntraffic, and gazing into the shops; and when he returned to the office,\nhe was at once shown in. Mr. Tufton rose, and shook him warmly by the\nhand.\n\n\"I consider these documents to be absolutely conclusive, my lord,\" he\nsaid. \"The letters to your grandfather, uncle, and aunts are conclusive\nas to his identity; and that of your mother, strengthened by the two\naffidavits, is equally conclusive as to your being his son. I will take\nthe necessary measures to lay these papers before the court, which has\nseveral times had the matter in hand, and to obtain a declaration that\nyou have indisputably proved yourself to be the son of the late Gregory\nHilliard Hartley, and therefore entitled to the title and estates, with\nall accumulations, of the Marquis of Langdale.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir! I will leave the matter entirely in your\nhands. Can you tell me the address of my aunts? As you will have seen,\nby my father's letter, he believed implicitly in their affection for\nhim.\"\n\n\"Their address is, The Manor House, Wimperton, Tavistock, Devon. They\nretired there at the accession of their brother to the title. It has\nbeen used as a dower house in the family for many years; and, pending\nthe search for your father, I obtained permission for them to continue\nto reside there. I was not obliged to ask for an allowance for them, as\nthey had an income, under their mother's marriage settlement,\nsufficient for them to live there in comfort.\n\n\"I will not give you the letter addressed to them, as I wish to show\nthe original in court; but I will have a copy made for you, at once,\nand I will attest it.\n\n\"Now, may I ask how you are situated, with regard to money? I have\nsufficient confidence in the justice of your claim to advance any sum,\nfor your immediate wants.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir! I am in no need of any advance. My mother's savings\namounted to five hundred pounds, of which I only drew fifty to buy my\noutfit, when I went up to the Soudan. My pay sufficed for my wants\nthere, and I drew out the remaining four hundred and fifty pounds when\nI left Cairo; so I am amply provided.\"\n\nGregory remained four days in London, obtaining suitable clothes. Then,\nattended by Zaki, he took his place in the Great Western for Tavistock.\nZaki had already picked up a good deal of English, and Gregory talked\nto him only in that language, on their way down from the battlefield;\nso that he could now express himself in simple phrases.\n\nMr. Tufton had on the previous day written, at Gregory's request, to\nhis aunts; saying that the son of their brother had called upon him,\nand given him proofs, which he considered incontestable, of his\nidentity and of the death of his father. He was the bearer of a letter\nfrom his father to them, and proposed delivering it the next day, in\nperson. He agreed with Gregory that it was advisable to send down this\nletter, as otherwise the ladies might doubt whether he was really what\nhe claimed to be, as his father's letter might very well have come into\nthe hands of a third person.\n\nHe went down by the night mail to Tavistock, put up at an hotel; and,\nafter breakfast, drove over to the Manor House, and sent in a card\nwhich he had had printed in town. He was shown into a room where the\ntwo ladies were waiting for him. They had been some four or five years\nyounger than his father, a fact of which he was not aware; and instead\nof being elderly women, as he expected, he found, by their appearance,\nthey were scarcely entering middle age. They were evidently much\nagitated.\n\n\"I have come down without waiting for an invitation,\" he said. \"I was\nanxious to deliver my father's letter to you, or at least a copy of it,\nas soon as possible. It was written before his death, some eighteen\nyears ago, and was intended for my mother to give to you, should she\nreturn to England. Its interest to you consists chiefly in the proof of\nmy father's affection for you, and that he felt he could rely on yours\nfor him. I may say that this is a copy, signed as correct by Mr.\nTufton. He could not give me the original, as it would be required as\nan evidence of my father's identity, in the application he is about to\nmake for me to be declared heir to the title.\"\n\n\"Then Gregory has been dead eighteen years!\" the elder of the ladies\nsaid. \"We have always hoped that he would be alive, in one of the\ncolonies, and that sooner or later he would see the advertisement that\nhad been put in the papers.\"\n\n\"No, madam. He went out to Alexandria with my mother, shortly before I\nwas born. He died some three or four years before his brother. It was\nseldom my mother saw an English paper. Unfortunately, as it turned out,\nmy father had dropped his surname when he accepted a situation, which\nwas a subordinate one, at Alexandria; and his reason for taking it was\nthat my mother was in weak health, and the doctor said it was necessary\nshe should go to a warm climate; therefore, had any of her friends seen\nthe advertisement, they would not have known that it applied to her. I,\nmyself, did not know that my proper name was Hartley until a year back,\nwhen I discovered my father's journal at Hebbeh, the place where he was\nmurdered; and then opened the documents that my mother had entrusted to\nme, before her death, with an injunction not to open them until I had\nascertained, for certain, that my father was no longer alive.\"\n\nOne of the ladies took the letter, and opened it. They read it\ntogether.\n\n\"Poor Gregory!\" one said, wiping her eyes, \"we were both fond of him,\nand certainly would have done all in our power to assist his widow. He\nwas nearer our age than Geoffrey. It was a terrible grief to us, when\nhe quarrelled with our father. Of course our sympathies were with\nGregory, but we never ventured to say so; and our father never\nmentioned his name, from the day he left the house. Why did not your\nmother send his letter to us?\"\n\n\"Because she did not need assistance. She was maintaining herself and\nme in comfort by teaching music, French, and English to the wives and\nchildren of several of the high Egyptian officials.\"\n\n\"How long is it since you lost her?\"\n\n\"More than three years ago. At her death, I was fortunate enough to\nobtain an appointment similar to that my father had, and at the same\ntime a commission in the Egyptian service; and have been fortunate in\nbeing, two or three times, mentioned in despatches.\"\n\n\"Yes; curiously enough, after receiving Mr. Tufton's letter, we saw\nColonel Wingate's despatch in the paper, in which your name is\nmentioned. We should have been astonished, indeed, had we not opened\nthe letter before we looked at the paper.\n\n\"Well, Gregory, we are very glad to see you, and to find that you have\ndone honour to the name. The despatch said that you have been\npreviously mentioned, under the name of Gregory Hilliard. We always\nfile our papers, and we spent an hour after breakfast in going through\nthem. I suppose you threw up your appointment, as soon as you\ndiscovered that Geoffrey died, years ago, and that you had come into\nthe title?\"\n\n\"I should have thrown it up, but Lord Kitchener was good enough to give\nme six months' leave; so that, if I should fail to prove my right to\nthe title, I could return there and take up my work again. He was so\nkind as to say that I should be given a responsible position, in the\ncivil administration of the Soudan.\"\n\n\"Well, we both feel very proud of you; and it does sound wonderful\nthat, being under twenty, you should have got on so well, without\nfriends or influence. I hope you intend to stay with us, until you have\nto go up to London about these affairs.\"\n\n\"I shall be very happy to stay a few days, Aunt; but it is better that\nI should be on the spot, as there may be questions that have to be\nanswered, and signatures, and all sorts of things.\n\n\"I have brought my Arab servant down with me. He has been with me for\nthree years, and is most faithful and devoted; and moreover, he once\nsaved my life, at tremendous risk to himself.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course we can put him up! Can he speak English?\"\n\n\"He speaks a little English, and is improving fast.\"\n\n\"Does he dress as a native?\"\n\n\"No, Aunt. He would soon freeze to death, in his native garb. As soon\nas I got down to Cairo with him, I put him into good European clothes.\nHe is a fine specimen of a Soudan Arab, but when he came to me he was\nsomewhat weakly; however, he soon got over that.\"\n\n\"Where is he, now?\"\n\n\"He is with the trap, outside. I told him that he had better not come\nin until I had seen you, for I thought that your domestics would not\nknow what to do with him, till they had your orders.\"\n\n\"You brought your portmanteau with you, I hope?\"\n\n\"I have brought it, but not knowing whether it would be wanted; for I\ndid not know whether you would take sufficiently to me, to ask me to\nstay.\"\n\n\"The idea of such a thing! You must have had a bad opinion of us.\"\n\n\"No, Aunt. I had the best of opinions. I am sure that my father would\nnot have written as he did to you, unless he had been very fond of you.\nStill, as at present I am not proved to be your nephew, I thought that\nyou might not be disposed to ask me to stay.\n\n\"Now, with your permission, I will go and tell Zaki--that is the man's\nname--to bring in my portmanteau. I can then send the trap back.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Gregory,\" one of his aunts said that evening; \"even\nputting aside the fact that you are our nephew, we are delighted that\nthe title and estates are not to go to the next heir. He came down here\nabout a year ago. His regiment had just returned from the Soudan. He\ndrove straight to the hall, and requested to be shown over it, saying\nthat in a short time he was going to take possession. The housekeeper\ncame across here, quite in distress, and said that he talked as if he\nwere already master; said he should make alterations in one place,\nenlarge the drawing room, build a conservatory against it, do away with\nsome of the pictures on the walls; and, in fact, he made himself very\nobjectionable. He came on here, and behaved in a most offensive and\nungentlemanly way. He actually enquired of us whether we were tenants\nby right, or merely on sufferance. I told him that, if he wanted to\nknow, he had better enquire of Mr. Tufton; and Flossie, who is more\noutspoken than I am, said at once that whether we were tenants for\nlife, or not, we should certainly not continue to reside here, if so\nobjectionable a person were master at the hall. He was very angry, but\nI cut him short by saying:\n\n\"'This is our house at present, sir; and, unless you leave it at once,\nI shall call the gardener in and order him to eject you.'\"\n\n\"I am not surprised at what you say, Aunt, for I met the fellow myself,\non the way up to Omdurman; and found him an offensive cad. It has been\na great satisfaction to me to know that he was so; for if he had been a\nnice fellow, I could not have helped being sorry to deprive him of the\ntitle and estates which he has, for years, considered to be his.\"\n\nAfter remaining four days at the Manor House, Gregory went back to\ntown. A notice had already been served, upon the former claimant to the\ntitle, that an application would be made to the court to hear the claim\nof Gregory Hilliard Hartley, nephew of the late Marquis, to be\nacknowledged as his successor to the title and estates; and that if he\nwished to appear by counsel, he could do so.\n\nThe matter was not heard of, for another three months. Lieutenant\nHartley was in court, and was represented by a queen's counsel of\neminence; who, however, when Gregory's narrative had been told, and the\nvarious documents put in, at once stated that after the evidence he had\nheard, he felt that it would be vain to contest the case at this point;\nbut that he reserved the right of appealing, should anything come to\nlight which would alter the complexion of the affair.\n\nThe judgment was that Gregory Hilliard Hartley had proved himself to be\nthe son of the late Gregory Hilliard Hartley, brother of and heir to\nthe late Marquis of Langdale, and was therefore seized of the title and\nestates.\n\nAs soon as the case was decided, Gregory went down again to Devonshire,\nand asked his aunts to take charge for him. This they at first said was\nimpossible; but he urged that, if they refused to do so, he should be\ndriven to go back to the Soudan again.\n\n\"My dear Aunts,\" he said, \"what in the world am I to do? I know no one.\nI know nothing of English customs, or society. I should, indeed, be the\nmost forlorn person in existence, with a large country estate and a\nmansion in London. I want someone to introduce me into society, and set\nme on my legs; manage me and my house, and preside at my table. I am\nnot yet twenty, and have not as much knowledge of English ways as a boy\nof ten. I should be taken in and duped in every way, and be at the\nmercy of every adventurer. I feel that it would be a sacrifice for you\nto leave your pretty home here, but I am sure, for the sake of my\nfather, you will not refuse to do so.\"\n\nHis aunts admitted that there was great justice in what he said, and\nfinally submitted to his request to preside over his house; until, as\nthey said, the time came when he would introduce a younger mistress.\n\nZaki, when his six months' trial was over, scorned the idea of\nreturning to the Soudan; declaring that, if Gregory would not keep him,\nhe would rather beg in the streets than go back there.\n\n\"It is all wonderful here,\" he said; \"we poor Arabs could not dream of\nsuch things. No, Master, as long as you live, I shall stay here.\"\n\n\"Very well, Zaki, so be it; and I can promise you that if I die before\nyou, you will be so provided for that you will be able to live in as\nmuch comfort as you now enjoy, and in addition you will be your own\nmaster.\"\n\nZaki shook his head.\n\n\"I should be a fool to wish to be my own master,\" he said, \"after\nhaving such a good one, at present.\"\n\nGregory is learning the duties of a large land owner, and is already\nvery popular in his part of Devonshire. The mansion in London has not\nyet been reopened, as Gregory says he must learn his lessons perfectly,\nbefore he ventures to take his place in society.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WITH KITCHENER IN THE SOUDAN***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 18868.txt or 18868.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/8\/8\/6\/18868\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":335,"split":"train"}
