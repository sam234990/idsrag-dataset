However, Richardson did not keep his authorship secret and, on the prompting of his friends like Samuel Johnson, dropped this framing device from the second edition.\nThe novel begins with the character of Harriet Byron leaving the house of her uncle, George Selby, to visit Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, her cousins, in London. She is an orphan who was educated by her grandparents, and, though she lacks parents, she is heir to a fortune of fifteen thousand pounds, which causes many suitors to pursue her. In London, she is pursued by three suitors, Mr. Greville, Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Orme. This courtship is followed by more suitors: Mr. Fowler, Sir Rowland Meredith and Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. The final one, Pollexfen, pursues Byron vigorously, which causes her to criticise him over a lack of morals and decency of character. However, Pollexfen does not end his pursuits of Byron until she explains that she could never receive his visits again.\nPollexfen, unwilling to be without Byron, decides to kidnap her while she attended a masquerade at the Haymarket. She is then imprisoned at Lisson Grove with the support of a widow and two daughters. While he keeps her prisoner, Pollexfen makes it clear to her that she shall be his wife, and that anyone who challenges that will die by his hand. Byron attempts to escape from the house, but this fails. To prevent her from trying to escape again, Pollexfen transports Byron to his home at Windsor. However, he is stopped at Hounslow Heath, where Charles Grandison hears Byron's pleas for help and immediately attacks Pollexfen. After this rescue, Grandison takes Byron to Colnebrook, the home of Grandison's brother-in-law, the \"Earl of L.\"\nAfter Pollexfen recovers from the attack, he sets out to duel Grandison. However, Grandison refuses on the grounds that dueling is harmful to society. After explaining why obedience to God and society are important, Grandison wins Pollexfen over and obtains his apology to Byron for his actions. She accepts his apology, and he follows with a proposal to marriage. She declines because she, as she admits, is in love with Grandison. However, a new suitor, the Earl of D, appears, and it emerges that Grandison promised himself to an Italian woman, Signorina Clementina della Porretta. As Grandison explains, he was in Italy years before and rescued the Barone della Porretta and a relationship developed between himself and Clementina, the baron's only daughter. However, Grandison could not marry her, as she demanded that he, an Anglican Protestant, become a Catholic, and he was unwilling to do so. After he left, she grew ill out of despair, and the Porrettas were willing to accept his religion, if he would return and make Clementina happy once more. Grandison, feeling obligated to do what he can to restore Clementina's happiness, returns to Italy; however, Clementina determines she can never marry a \"heretic\", and so Grandison returns to England and Harriet who accepts him. They are married; and everyone is accorded their just deserts.\nIn a \"Concluding Note\" to Grandison, Richardson writes: \"It has been said, in behalf of many modern fictitious pieces, in which authors have given success (and happiness, as it is called) to their heroes of vicious if not profligate characters, that they have exhibited Human Nature as it is. Its corruption may, indeed, be exhibited in the faulty character; but need pictures of this be held out in books? Is not vice crowned with success, triumphant, and rewarded, and perhaps set off with wit and spirit, a dangerous representation?\" In particular, Richardson is referring to novels of Fielding, his literary rival. This note was published with the final volume of Grandison in March 1754, a few months before Fielding left for Lisbon. Before Fielding died in Lisbon, he included a response to Richardson in his preface to Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The History of Sir Charles Grandison, Volume\n4 (of 7), by Samuel Richardson\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

What think you!--But it is easy to guess what you must think.\nI will, without saying one word more, enclose\n\n\nDR. BARTLETT'S TENTH LETTER\n\nThe next day (proceeds my patron) I went to make my visit to the family.\nI had nothing to reproach myself with; and therefore had no other concern\nupon me but what arose from the unhappiness of the noble Clementina: that\nindeed was enough. I thought I should have some difficulty to manage my\nown spirit, if I were to find myself insulted, especially by the general.\nSoldiers are so apt to value themselves on their knowledge of what, after\nall, one may call but their trade, that a private gentleman is often\nthought too slightly of by them. Insolence in a great man, a rich man,\nor a soldier, is a call upon a man of spirit to exert himself. But I\nhope, thought I, I shall not have this call from any one of a family I so\ngreatly respect.\n\nI was received by the bishop; who politely, after I had paid my\ncompliments to the marquis and his lady, presented me to those of the\nUrbino family to whom I was a stranger. Every one of those named by\nSignor Jeronymo, in his last letter, was present.\n\nThe marquis, after he had returned my compliment, looked another way, to\nhide his emotion: the marchioness put her handkerchief to her eyes, and\nlooked upon me with tenderness; and I read in them her concern for her\nClementina.\n\nI paid my respects to the general with an air of freedom, yet of regard;\nto my Jeronymo, with the tenderness due to our friendship, and\ncongratulated him on seeing him out of his chamber. His kind eyes\nglistened with pleasure; yet it was easy to read a mixture of pain in\nthem; which grew stronger as the first emotions at seeing me enter, gave\nway to reflection.\n\nThe Conte della Porretta seemed to measure me with his eye.\n\nI addressed myself to Father Marescotti, and made my particular\nacknowledgments to him for the favour of his visit, and what had passed\nin it. He looked upon me with pleasure; probably with the more, as this\nwas a farewell visit.\n\nThe two ladies whispered, and looked upon me, and seemed to bespeak each\nother's attention to what passed.\n\nSignor Sebastiano placed himself next to Jeronymo, and often whispered\nhim, and as often cast his eye upon me. He was partial to me, I believe,\nbecause my generous friend seemed pleased with what he said.\n\nHis brother, Signor Juliano, sat on the other hand of me. They are\nagreeable and polite young gentlemen.\n\nA profound silence succeeded the general compliments.\n\nI addressed myself to the marquis: Your lordship, and you, madam, turning\nto the marchioness, I hope will excuse me for having requested of you the\nhonour of being once more admitted to your presence, and to that of three\nbrothers, for whom I shall ever retain the most respectful affection. I\ncould not think of leaving a city, where one of the first families in it\nhas done me the highest honour, without taking such a leave as might shew\nmy gratitude.--Accept, my lords, bowing to each; accept, madam, more\nprofoundly bowing to the marchioness, my respectful thanks for all your\ngoodness to me. I shall, to the end of my life, number most of the days\nthat I have passed at Bologna among its happiest, even were the remainder\nto be as happy as man ever knew.\n\nThe marquis said, We wish you, chevalier, very happy; happier than--He\nsighed, and was silent.\n\nHis lady only bowed. Her face spoke distress. Her voice was lost in\nsighs, though she struggled to suppress them.\n\nChevalier, said the bishop, with an air of solemnity, you have given us\nmany happy hours: for them we thank you. Jeronymo, for himself, will say\nmore: he is the most grateful of men. We thank you also for what you\nhave done for him.\n\nI cannot, said Jeronymo, express suitably my gratitude: my prayers, my\nvows, shall follow you whithersoever you go, best of friends, and best of\nmen!\n\nThe general, with an air and a smile that might have been dispensed with,\noddly said, High pleasure and high pain are very near neighbours: they\nare often guilty of excesses, and then are apt to mistake each other's\nhouse. I am one of those who think our whole house obliged to the\nchevalier for the seasonable assistance he gave to our Jeronymo. But--\n\nDear general, said Lady Juliana, bear with an interruption: the intent of\nthis meeting is amicable. The chevalier is a man of honour. Things may\nhave fallen out unhappily; yet nobody to blame.\n\nAs to blame, or otherwise, said the Conte della Porretta, that is not now\nto be talked of; else, I know where it lies: in short, among ourselves.\nThe chevalier acted greatly by Signor Jeronymo: we were all obliged to\nhim: but to let such a man as this have free admission to our daughter--\nShe ought to have had no eyes.\n\nPray, my lord, pray, brother, said the marquis, are we not enough\nsufferers?\n\nThe chevalier, said the general, cannot but be gratified by so high a\ncompliment; and smiled indignantly.\n\nMy lord, replied I to the general, you know very little of the man before\nyou, if you don't believe him to be the most afflicted man present.\n\nImpossible! said the marquis, with a sigh.\n\nThe marchioness arose from her seat, motioning to go; and turning round\nto the two ladies, and the count, I have resigned my will to the will of\nyou all, my dearest friends, and shall be permitted to withdraw. This\ntestimony, however, before I go, I cannot but bear: Wherever the fault\nlay, it lay not with the chevalier. He has, from the first to the last,\nacted with the nicest honour. He is entitled to our respect. The\nunhappiness lies nowhere but in the difference of religion.\n\nWell, and that now is absolutely out of the question, said the general:\nit is indeed, chevalier.\n\nI hope, my lord, from a descendant of a family so illustrious, to find an\nequal exemption from wounding words, and wounding looks; and that, sir,\nas well from your generosity, as from your justice.\n\nMy looks give you offence, chevalier!--Do they?\n\nI attended to the marchioness. She came towards me. I arose, and\nrespectfully took her hand.--Chevalier, said she, I could not withdraw\nwithout bearing the testimony I have borne to your merits. I wish you\nhappy.--God protect you, whithersoever you go. Adieu.\n\nShe wept. I bowed on her hand with profound respect. She retired with\nprecipitation. It was with difficulty that I suppressed the rising tear.\nI took my seat.\n\nI made no answer to the general's last question, though it was spoken in\nsuch a way (I saw by their eyes) as took every other person's notice.\n\nLady Sforza, when her sister was retired, hinted, that the last interview\nbetween the young lady and me was an unadvised permission, though\nintended for the best.\n\nI then took upon me to defend that step. Lady Clementina, said I, had\ndeclared, that if she were allowed to speak her whole mind to me, she\nshould be easy. I had for some time given myself up to absolute despair.\nThe marchioness intended not favour to me in allowing of the interview:\nit was the most affecting one to me I had ever known. But let me say,\nthat, far from having bad effects on the young lady's mind, it had good\nones. I hardly knew how to talk upon a subject so very interesting to\nevery one present, but not more so to any one than to myself. I thought\nof avoiding it; and have been led into it, but did not lead. And since\nit is before us, let me recommend, as the most effectual way to restore\nevery one to peace and happiness, gentle treatment. The most generous of\nhuman minds, the most meek, the most dutiful, requires not harsh\nmethods.\n\nHow do you know, sir, said the general, and looked at Jeronymo, the\nmethods now taken--\n\nAnd are they then harsh, my lord? said I.\n\nHe was offended.\n\nI had heard, proceeded I, that a change of measures was resolved on. I\nknew that the treatment before had been all gentle, condescending,\nindulgent. I received but yesterday letters from my father, signifying\nhis intention of speedily recalling me to my native country. I shall set\nout very soon for Paris, where I hope to meet with his more direct\ncommands for this long-desired end. What may be my destiny, I know not;\nbut I shall carry with me a heart burdened with the woes of this family,\nand distressed for the beloved daughter of it. But let me bespeak you\nall, for your own sakes, (mine is out of the question: I presume not upon\nany hope on my own account,) that you will treat this angelic-minded lady\nwith tenderness. I pretend to say, that I know that harsh or severe\nmethods will not do.\n\nThe general arose from his seat, and, with a countenance of fervor, next\nto fierceness--Let me tell you, Grandison, said he--\n\nI arose from mine, and going to Lady Sforza, who sat next him, he stopt,\nsupposing me going to him, and seemed surprised, and attentive to my\nmotions: but, disregarding him, I addressed myself to that lady. You,\nmadam, are the aunt of Lady Clementina: the tender, the indulgent mother\nis absent, and has declared, that she resigns her will to the will of her\nfriends present--Allow me to supplicate, that former measures may not be\nchanged with her. Great dawnings of returning reason did I discover in\nour last interview. Her delicacy (never was there a more delicate mind)\nwanted but to be satisfied. It was satisfied, and she began to be easy.\nWere her mind but once composed, the sense she has of her duty, and what\nshe owes to her religion, would restore her to your wishes: but if she\nshould be treated harshly, (though I am sure, if she should, it would be\nwith the best intention,) Clementina will be lost.\n\nThe general sat down. They all looked upon one another. The two ladies\ndried their eyes. The starting tear would accompany my fervor. And then\nstepping to Jeronymo, who was extremely affected; My dear Jeronymo, said\nI, my friend, my beloved friend, cherish in your noble heart the memory\nof your Grandison: would to God I could attend you to England! We have\nbaths there of sovereign efficacy. The balm of a friendly and grateful\nheart would promote the cure. I have urged it before. Consider of it.\n\nMy Grandison, my dear Grandison, my friend, my preserver! You are not\ngoing!--\n\nI am, my Jeronymo, and embraced him. Love me in absence, as I shall you.\n\nChevalier, said the bishop, you don't go? We hope for your company at a\nsmall collation.--We must not part with you yet.\n\nI cannot, my lord, accept the favour. Although I had given myself up to\ndespair of obtaining the happiness to which I once aspired; yet I was not\nwilling to quit a city that this family had made dear to me, with the\nprecipitation of a man conscious of misbehaviour. I thank you for the\npermission I had to attend you all in full assembly. May God prosper\nyou, my lord; and may you be invested with the first honours of that\nchurch which must be adorned by so worthy a heart! It will be my glory,\nwhen I am in my native place, or wherever I am, to remember that I was\nonce thought not unworthy of a rank in a family so respectable. Let me,\nmy lord, be entitled to your kind remembrance.\n\nHe pulled out his handkerchief. My lord, said he, to his father; my\nLord, to the general; Grandison must not go!--and sat down with emotion.\n\nLady Sforza wept: Laurana seemed moved: the two young lords, Sebastiano\nand Juliano, were greatly affected.\n\nI then addressed myself to the marquis, who sat undetermined, as to\nspeech: My venerable lord, forgive me, that my address was not first paid\nhere. My heart overflows with gratitude for your goodness in permitting\nme to throw myself at your feet, before I took a last farewell of a city\nfavoured with your residence. Best of fathers, of friends, of men, let\nme entreat the continuance of your paternal indulgence to the child\nnearest, and deserving to be nearest, to your heart. She is all you and\nher mother. Restore her to yourself, and to her, by your indulgence:\nthat alone, and a blessing on your prayers, can restore her. Adieu, my\ngood lord: repeated thanks for all your hospitable goodness to a man that\nwill ever retain a grateful sense of your favour.\n\nYou will not yet go, was all he said--he seemed in agitation. He could\nnot say more.\n\nI then, turning to the count his brother, who sat next him, said, I have\nnot the honour to be fully known to your lordship: some prejudices from\ndifferences in opinion may have been conceived: but if you ever hear\nanything of the man before you unworthy of his name, and of the favour\nonce designed him; then, my lord, blame, as well as wonder at, the\ncondescension of your noble brother and sister in my favour.\n\nWho, I! Who, I! said that lord, in some hurry.--I think very well of\nyou. I never saw a man, in my life, that I liked so well!\n\nYour lordship does me honour. I say this the rather, as I may, on this\nsolemn occasion, taking leave of such honourable friends, charge my\nfuture life with resolutions to behave worthy of the favour I have met\nwith in this family.\n\nI passed from him to the general--Forgive, my lord, said I, the seeming\nformality of my behaviour in this parting scene: it is a very solemn one\nto me. You have expressed yourself of me, and to me, my lord, with more\npassion, (forgive me, I mean not to offend you,) than perhaps you will\napprove in yourself when I am far removed from Italy. For have you not a\nnoble mind? And are you not a son of the Marquis della Porretta? Permit\nme to observe, that passion will make a man exalt himself, and degrade\nanother; and the just medium will be then forgot. I am afraid I have\nbeen thought more lightly of, than I ought to be, either in justice, or\nfor the honour of a person who is dear to every one present. My country\nwas once mentioned with disdain: think not my vanity so much concerned in\nwhat I am going to say, as my honour: I am proud to be thought an\nEnglishman: yet I think as highly of every worthy man of every nation\nunder the sun, as I do of the worthy men of my own. I am not of a\ncontemptible race in my own country. My father lives in it with the\nmagnificence of a prince. He loves his son; yet I presume to add, that\nthat son deems his good name his riches; his integrity his grandeur.\nPrinces, though they are entitled by their rank to respect, are princes\nto him only as they act.\n\nA few words more, my lord.\n\nI have been of the hearing, not of the speaking side of the question, in\nthe two last conferences I had the honour to hold with your lordship.\nOnce you unkindly mentioned the word triumph. The word at the time went\nto my heart. When I can subdue the natural warmth of my temper, then,\nand then only, I have a triumph. I should not have remembered this, had\nI not now, my lord, on this solemn occasion, been received by you with an\nindignant eye. I respect your lordship too much not to take notice of\nthis angry reception. My silence upon it, perhaps, would look like\nsubscribing before this illustrious company to the justice of your\ncontempt: yet I mean no other notice than this; and this to demonstrate\nthat I was not, in my own opinion at least, absolutely unworthy of the\nfavour I met with from the father, the mother, the brothers, you so\njustly honour, and which I wished to stand in with you.\n\nAnd now, my lord, allow me the honour of your hand; and, as I have given\nyou no cause for displeasure, say, that you will remember me with\nkindness, as I shall honour you and your whole family to the last day of\nmy life.\n\nThe general heard me out; but it was with great emotion. He accepted not\nmy hand; he returned not any answer: the bishop arose, and, taking him\naside, endeavoured to calm him.\n\nI addressed myself to the two young lords, and said, that if ever their\ncuriosity led them to visit England, where I hoped to be in a few months,\nI should be extremely glad of cultivating their esteem and favour, by the\nbest offices I could do them.\n\nThey received my civility with politeness.\n\nI addressed myself next to Lady Laurana--May you, madam, the friend, the\nintimate, the chosen companion of Lady Clementina, never know the\nhundredth part of the woe that fills the breast of the man before you,\nfor the calamity that has befallen your admirable cousin, and, because of\nthat, a whole excellent family. Let me recommend to you, that tender and\nsoothing treatment to her, which her tender heart would shew to you, in\nany calamity that should befall you. I am not a bad man, madam, though\nof a different communion from yours. Think but half so charitably of me,\nas I do of every one of your religion who lives up to his professions,\nand I shall be happy in your favourable thoughts when you hear me spoken\nof.\n\nIt is easy to imagine, Dr. Bartlett, that I addressed myself in this\nmanner to this lady whom I had never before seen, that she might not\nthink the harder of her cousin's prepossessions in favour of a\nProtestant.\n\nI recommended myself to the favour of Father Marescotti. He assured me\nof his esteem, in very warm terms.\n\nAnd just as I was again applying to my Jeronymo, the general came to me:\nYou cannot think, sir, said he, nor did you design it, I suppose, that I\nshould be pleased with your address to me. I have only this question to\nask, When do you quit Bologna?\n\nLet me ask your lordship, said I, when do you return to Naples?\n\nWhy that question, sir? haughtily.\n\nI will answer you frankly. Your lordship, at the first of my\nacquaintance with you, invited me to Naples. I promised to pay my\nrespects to you there. If you think of being there in a week, I will\nattend you at your own palace in that city; and there, my lord, I hope,\nno cause to the contrary having arisen from me, to be received by you\nwith the same kindness and favour that you shewed when you gave me the\ninvitation. I think to leave Bologna to-morrow.\n\nO brother! said the bishop, are you not now overcome?\n\nAnd are you in earnest? said the general.\n\nI am, my lord. I have many valuable friends, at different courts and\ncities in Italy, to take leave of. I never intend to see it again. I\nwould look upon your lordship as one of those friends; but you seem still\ndispleased with me. You accepted not my offered hand before; once more I\ntender it. A man of spirit cannot be offended at a man of spirit,\nwithout lessening himself. I call upon your dignity, my lord.\n\nHe held out his hand, just as I was withdrawing mine. I have pride, you\nknow, Dr. Bartlett; and I was conscious of a superiority in this\ninstance: I took his hand, however, at his offer; yet pitied him, that\nhis motion was made at all, as it wanted that grace which generally\naccompanies all he does and says.\n\nThe bishop embraced me.--Your moderation, thus exerted, said he, must\never make you triumph. O Grandison! you are a prince of the Almighty's\ncreation.\n\nThe noble Jeronymo dried his eyes, and held out his arms to embrace me.\n\nThe general said, I shall certainly be at Naples in a week. I am too\nmuch affected by the woes of my family, to behave as perhaps I ought on\nthis occasion. Indeed, Grandison, it is difficult for sufferers to act\nwith spirit and temper at the same time.\n\nIt is, my lord; I have found it so. My hopes raised, as once they were,\nnow sunk, and absolute despair having taken place of them--Would to God I\nhad never returned to Italy!--But I reproach not any body.\n\nYet, said Jeronymo, you have some reason--To be sent for as you were--\n\nHe was going on--Pray, brother, said the general--And turning to me, I\nmay expect you, sir, at Naples?\n\nYou may, my lord. But one favour I have to beg of you mean time. It is,\nthat you will not treat harshly your dear Clementina. Would to Heaven I\nmight have had the honour to say, my Clementina! And permit me to make\none other request on my own account: and that is, that you will tell her,\nthat I took my leave of your whole family, by their kind permission; and\nthat, at my departure, I wished her, from my soul, all the happiness that\nthe best and tenderest of her friends can wish her! I make this request\nto you, my lord, rather than to Signor Jeronymo, because the tenderness\nwhich he has for me might induce him to mention me to her in a manner\nwhich might, at this time, affect her too sensibly for her peace.\n\nBe pleased, my dear Signor Jeronymo, to make my devotion known to the\nmarchioness. Would to Heaven--But adieu! and once more adieu, my\nJeronymo. I shall hear from you when I get to Naples, if not before.--\nGod restore your sister, and heal you!\n\nI bowed to the marquis, to the ladies, to the general, to the bishop,\nparticularly; to the rest in general; and was obliged, in order to\nconceal my emotion, to hurry out at the door. The servants had planted\nthemselves in a row; not for selfish motives, as in England: they bowed\nto the ground, and blessed me, as I went through them. I had ready a\npurse of ducats. One hand and another declined it: I dropt it in their\nsight. God be with you, my honest friends! said I; and departed--O, Dr.\nBartlett, with a heart how much distressed!\n\n\nAnd now, my good Miss Byron, Have I not reason, from the deep concern\nwhich you take in the woes of Lady Clementina, to regret the task you\nhave put me upon? And do you, my good Lord and Lady L----, and Miss\nGrandison, now wonder that your brother has not been forward to give you\nthe particulars of this melancholy tale? Yet you all say, I must\nproceed.\n\n\nSee, Lucy, the greatness of this man's behaviour! What a presumption was\nit in your Harriet, ever to aspire to call such a one hers!\n\n\n\nLETTER II\n\nMISS BYRON, TO MISS SELBY\n\n\nThis Lady Olivia, Lucy, what can she pretend to--But I will not puzzle\nmyself about her--Yet she pretend to give disturbance to such a man! You\nwill find her mentioned in Dr. Bartlett's next letter; or she would not\nhave been named by me.\n\n\n***\n\n\nDR. BARTLETT'S ELEVENTH LETTER\n\nMr. Grandison, on his return to his lodgings, found there, in disguise,\nLady Olivia. He wanted not any new disturbance. But I will not mix the\nstories.\n\nThe next morning he received a letter from Signor Jeronymo. The\nfollowing is a translation of it:\n\n\n***\n\n\nMy dearest Grandison!\n\nHow do you?--Ever amiable friend! What triumphs did your behaviour of\nlast night obtain for you! Not a soul here but admires you!\n\nEven Laurana declared, that, were you a Catholic, it would be a merit to\nlove you. Yet she reluctantly praised you, and once said, What, but\nsplendid sins, are the virtues of a heretic?\n\nOur two cousins, with the good-nature of youth, lamented that you could\nnot be ours in the way you wish. My father wept like a child, when you\nwere gone; and seemed to enjoy the praises given you by every one. The\ncount said, he never saw a nobler behaviour in man. Your free, your\nmanly, your polite air and address, and your calmness and intrepidity,\nwere applauded by every one.\n\nWhat joy did this give to your Jeronymo! I thought I wanted neither\ncrutches, helps, nor wheeled chair; and several times forgot that I ailed\nany thing.\n\nI begin to love Father Marescotti. He was with the foremost in praising\nyou.\n\nThe general owned, that he was resolved once to quarrel with you. But\nwill he, do you think, Jeronymo, said he, make me a visit at Naples?\n\nYou may depend upon it, he will, answered I----\n\nI will be there to receive him, replied he.\n\nThey admired you particularly for your address to my sister, by the\ngeneral, rather than by me. And Lady Sforza said, it was a thousand\npities that you and Clementina could not be one. They applauded, all of\nthem, what they had not, any of them, the power to imitate, that\nlargeness of heart which makes you think so well, and speak so tenderly,\nof those of communions different from your own. So much steadiness in\nyour own religion, yet so much prudence, in a man so young, they said,\nwas astonishing! No wonder that your character ran so high, in every\ncourt you had visited.\n\nMy mother came in soon after you had left us. She was equally surprised\nand grieved to find you gone. She thought she was sure of your staying\nsupper; and, not satisfied with the slight leave she had taken, she had\nbeen strengthening her mind to pass an hour in your company, in order to\ntake a more solemn one.\n\nMy father asked her after her daughter.\n\nPoor soul! said she, she has heard that the chevalier was to be here, to\ntake leave of us.\n\nBy whom? by whom? said my father.\n\nI cannot tell: but the poor creature is half-raving to be admitted among\nus. She has dressed herself in one of her best suits; and I found her\nsitting in a kind of form, expecting to be called down. Indeed, Lady\nSforza, the method we are in, does not do. So the chevalier said,\nreplied that lady. Well, let us change it, with all my heart. It is no\npleasure to treat the dear girl harshly--O sister! this is a most\nextraordinary man!\n\nThat moment in bolted Camilla--Lady Clementina is just at the door. I\ncould not prevail upon her--\n\nWe all looked upon one another.\n\nThree soft taps at the door, and a hem, let us know she was there.\n\nLet her come in, dear girl, let her come in, said the count: the\nchevalier is not here.\n\nLaurana arose, and ran to the door, and led her in by the hand.\n\nDear creature, how wild she looked!--Tears ran down my cheeks: I had not\nseen her for two days before. O how earnestly did she look round her!\nwithdrawing her hand from her cousin, who would have led her to a chair,\nand standing quite still.\n\nCome and sit by me, my sweet love, said her weeping mother.--She stept\ntowards her.\n\nSit down, my dear girl.\n\nNo: you beat me, remember.\n\nWho beat you, my dear?--Sure nobody would beat my child!--Who beat you,\nClementina?\n\nI don't know--Still looking round her, as wanting somebody.\n\nAgain her mother courted her to sit down.\n\nNo, madam, you don't love me.\n\nIndeed, my dear, I do.\n\nSo you say.\n\nHer father held out his open arms to her. Tears ran down his cheeks. He\ncould not speak.--Ah, my father! said she, stepping towards him.\n\nHe caught her in his arms--Don't, don't, sir, faintly struggling, with\naverted face--You love me not--You refused to see your child, when she\nwanted to claim your protection!--I was used cruelly.\n\nBy whom, my dear? by whom?\n\nBy every body. I complained to one, and to another; but all were in a\ntone: and so I thought I would be contented. My mamma, too!--But it is\nno matter. I saw it was to be so; and I did not care.\n\nBy my soul, said I, this is not the way with her, Lady Sforza. The\nchevalier is in the right. You see how sensible she is of harsh\ntreatment.\n\nWell, well, said the general, let us change our measures.\n\nStill the dear girl looked out earnestly, as for somebody.\n\nShe loosed herself from the arms of her sorrowing father.\n\nLet us in silence, said the count, observe her motions.\n\nShe went to him on tip-toe, and looking in his face over his shoulder, as\nhe sat with his back towards her, passed him; then to the general; then\nto Signor Sebastiano; and to every one round, till she came to me;\nlooking at each over his shoulder in the same manner: then folding her\nfingers, her hands open, and her arms hanging down to their full extent,\nshe held up her face meditating, with such a significant woe, that I\nthought my heart would have burst.--Not a soul in the company had a dry\neye.\n\nLady Sforza arose, took her two hands, the fingers still clasped, and\nwould have spoken to her, but could not; and hastily retired to her seat.\n\nTears, at last, began to trickle down her cheeks, as she stood fixedly\nlooking up. She started, looked about her, and hastening to her mother,\nthrew her arms about her neck; and, hiding her face in her bosom, broke\nout into a flood of tears, mingled with sobs that penetrated every heart.\n\nThe first words she said, were, Love me, my mamma! Love your child! your\npoor child! your Clementina! Then raising her head, and again laying it\nin her mother's bosom--If ever you loved me, love me now, my mamma!--I\nhave need of your love!\n\nMy father was forced to withdraw. He was led out by his two sons.\n\nYour poor Jeronymo was unable to help himself. He wanted as much comfort\nas his father. What were the wounds of his body, at that time, to those\nof his mind?\n\nMy two brothers returned. This dear girl, said the bishop, will break\nall our hearts.\n\nHer tears had seemed to relieve her. She held up her head. My mother's\nbosom seemed wet with her child's tears and her own. Still she looked\nround her.\n\nSuppose, said I, somebody were to name the man she seems to look for? It\nmay divert this wildness.\n\nDid she come down, said Laurana to Camilla, with the expectation of\nseeing him?\n\nShe did.\n\nLet me, said the bishop, speak to her. He arose, and, taking her hand,\nwalked with her about the room. You look pretty, my Clementina! Your\nornaments are charmingly fancied. What made you dress yourself so\nprettily?\n\nShe looked earnestly at him, in silence. He repeated his question--I\nspeak, said she, all my heart; and then I suffer for it. Every body is\nagainst me.\n\nYou shall not suffer for it: every body is for you.\n\nI confessed to Mrs. Beaumont; I confessed to you, brother: but what did I\nget by it?--Let go my hand. I don't love you, I believe.\n\nI am sorry for it. I love you, Clementina, as I love my own soul!\n\nYet you never chide your own soul!\n\nHe turned his face from her to us. She must not be treated harshly, said\nhe. He soothed her in a truly brotherly manner.\n\nTell me, added he to his soothings, Did you expect any body here, that\nyou find not?\n\nDid I? Yes, I did.--Camilla, come hither.--Let go my hand, brother.\n\nHe did. She took Camilla under the arm--Don't you know, Camilla, said\nshe, what you heard said of somebody's threatening somebody?--Don't let\nanybody hear us; drawing her to one end of the room.--I want to take a\nwalk with you into the garden, Camilla.\n\nIt is dark night, madam.\n\nNo matter. If you are afraid, I will go by myself.\n\nSeem to humour her in talk, Camilla, said the count; but don't go out of\nthe room with her.\n\nBe pleased to tell me, madam, what we are to walk in the garden for?\n\nWhy, Camilla, I had a horrid dream last night; and I cannot be easy till\nI go into the garden.\n\nWhat, madam, was your dream?\n\nIn the orange grove, I thought I stumbled over the body of a dead man!\n\nAnd who was it, madam?\n\nDon't you know who was threatened? And was not somebody here to night?\nAnd was not somebody to sup here? And is he here?\n\nThe general then went to her. My dearest Clementina; my beloved sister;\nset your heart at rest. Somebody is safe: shall be safe.\n\nShe took first one of his hands, then the other; and looking in the palms\nof them, They are not bloody, said she.--What have you done with him,\nthen? Where is he?\n\nWhere is who?\n\nYou know whom I ask after; but you want something against me.\n\nThen stepping quick up to me: My Jeronymo!--Did I see you before? and\nstroked my cheek.--Now tell me, Jeronymo--Don't come near me, Camilla.\nPray, sir, to the general, do you sit down. She leaned her arm upon my\nshoulder: I don't hurt you, Jeronymo: do I?\n\nNo, my dearest Clementina!\n\nThat's my best brother.--Cruel assassins!--But the brave man came just in\ntime to save you.--But do you know what is become of him?\n\nHe is safe, my dear. He could not stay.\n\nDid any body affront him?\n\nNo, my love.\n\nAre you sure nobody did?--Very sure? Father Marescotti, said she, turning\nto him, (who wept from the time she entered,) you don't love him: but you\nare a good man, and will tell me truth. Where is he? Did nobody affront\nhim?\n\nNo, madam.\n\nBecause, said she, he never did any thing but good to any one.\n\nFather Marescotti, said I, admires him as much as any body.\n\nAdmire him! Father Marescotti admire him!--But he does not love him.\nAnd I never heard him say one word against Father Marescotti in my life.\n--Well, but, Jeronymo, what made him go away, then? Was he not to stay\nsupper?\n\nHe was desired to stay; but would not.\n\nJeronymo, let me whisper you--Did he tell you that I wrote him a letter?\n\nI guessed you did, whispered I.\n\nYou are a strange guesser: but you can't guess how I sent it to him--But\nhush, Jeronymo--Well, but, Jeronymo, Did he say nothing of me, when he\nwent away?\n\nHe left his compliments for you with the general.\n\nWith the general! The general won't tell me!\n\nYes, he will.--Brother, pray tell my sister what the chevalier said to\nyou, at parting.\n\nHe repeated, exactly, what you had desired him to say to her.\n\nWhy would they not let me see him? said she. Am I never to see him more?\n\nI hope you will, replied the bishop.\n\nIf, resumed she, we could have done any thing that might have looked like\na return to his goodness to us (and to you, my Jeronymo, in particular) I\nbelieve I should have been easy.--And so you say he is gone?--And gone\nfor ever! lifting up her hand from her wrist, as it lay over my shoulder:\nPoor chevalier!--But hush, hush, pray hush, Jeronymo.\n\nShe went from me to her aunt, and cousin Laurana. Love me again, madam,\nsaid she, to the former. You loved me once.\n\nI never loved you better than now, my dear.\n\nDid you, Laurana, see the Chevalier Grandison?\n\nI did.\n\nAnd did he go away safe, and unhurt?\n\nIndeed he did.\n\nA man who had preserved the life of our dear Jeronymo, said she, to have\nbeen hurt by us, would have been dreadful, you know. I wanted to say a\nfew words to him. I was astonished to find him not here: and then my\ndream came into my head. It was a sad dream, indeed! But, cousin, be\ngood to me: pray do. You did not use to be cruel. You used to say, you\nloved me. I am in calamity, my dear. I know I am miserable. At times I\nknow I am; and then I am grieved at my heart, and think how happy every\none is, but me: but then, again, I ail nothing, and am well. But do love\nme, Laurana: I am in calamity, my dear. I would love you, if you were in\ncalamity: indeed I would.--Ah, Laurana! What is become of all your fine\npromises? But then every body loved me, and I was happy!--Yet you tell\nme, it is all for my good. Naughty Laurana, to wound my heart by your\ncrossness, and then say, it is for my good!--Do you think I should have\nserved you so?\n\nLaurana blushed, and wept. Her aunt promised her, that every body would\nlove her, and comfort her, and not be angry with her, if she would make\nher heart easy.\n\nI am very particular, my dear Grandison. I know you love I should be so.\nFrom this minuteness, you will judge of the workings of her mind. They\nare resolved to take your advice, (it was very seasonable,) and treat her\nwith indulgence. The count is earnest to have it so.\n\n\n***\n\n\nCamilla has just left me. She says, that her young lady had a tolerable\nnight. She thinks it owing, in a great measure, to her being indulged in\nasking the servants, who saw you depart, how you looked; and being\nsatisfied that you went away unhurt, and unaffronted.\n\nAdieu, my dearest, my best friend. Let me hear from you, as often as you\ncan.\n\n\n***\n\n\nI just now understand from Camilla, that the dear girl has made an\nearnest request to my father, mother, and aunt; and been refused. She\ncame back from them deeply afflicted; and, as Camilla fears, is going\ninto one of her gloomy fits again. I hope to write again, if you depart\nnot from Bologna before to-morrow: but I must, for my own sake, write\nshorter letters. Yet how can I? Since, however melancholy the subject,\nwhen I am writing to you, I am conversing with you. My dear Grandison,\nonce more adieu.\n\n\nO Lucy, my dear! Whence come all the tears this melancholy story has\ncost me? I cannot dwell upon the scenes!--Begone, all those wishes that\nwould interfere with the interest of that sweet distressed saint at\nBologna!\n\nHow impolitic, Lucy, was it in them, not to gratify her impatience to see\nhim! She would, most probably, have been quieted in her mind, if she had\nbeen obliged by one other interview.\n\nWhat a delicacy, my dear, what a generosity, is there in her love!\n\nSir Charles, in Lord L----'s study, said to me, that his compassion was\nengaged, but his honour was free: and so it seems to be: but a generosity\nin return for her generosity, must bind such a mind as his.\n\n\n\nLETTER III\n\nMISS BYRON, TO MISS SELBY\n\n\nIn the doctor's next letter, enclosed, you will find mention made of Sir\nCharles's Literary Journal. I fancy, my dear, it must be a charming\nthing. I wish we could have before us every line he wrote while he was\nin Italy. Once the presumptuous Harriet had hopes, that she might have\nbeen entitled--But no more of these hopes--It can't be helped, Lucy.\n\n\n***\n\n\nDR. BARTLETT'S TWELFTH LETTER\n\nMr. Grandison proceeds thus:\n\nThe next morning I employed myself in visiting and taking leave of\nseveral worthy members of the university, with whom I had passed many\nvery agreeable and improving hours, during my residence in this noble\ncity. In my Literary Journal you have an account of those worthy\npersons, and of some of our conversations. I paid my duty to the\ncardinal legate, and the gonfaloniere, and to three of his counsellors,\nby whom, you know, I had been likewise greatly honoured. My mind was not\nfree enough to enjoy their conversation: such a weight upon my heart, how\ncould it? But the debt of gratitude and civility was not to be left\nunpaid.\n\nOn my return to my lodgings, which was not till the evening, I found, the\ngeneral had been there to inquire after me.\n\nI sent one of my servants to the palace of Porretta, with my compliments\nto the general, to the bishop, and Jeronymo; and with particular\ninquiries after the health of the ladies, and the marquis; but had only a\ngeneral answer, that they were much as I left them.\n\nThe two young lords, Sebastiano and Juliano, made me a visit of ceremony.\nThey talked of visiting England in a year or two. I assured them of my\nbest services, and urged them to go thither. I asked them after the\nhealths of the marquis, the marchioness, and their beloved cousin\nClementina. Signor Sebastiano shook his head: very, very indifferent,\nwere his words. We parted with great civilities.\n\nI will now turn my thoughts to Florence, and to the affairs there that\nhave lain upon me, from the death of my good friend Mr. Jervois, and from\nmy wardship. I told you in their course, the steps I took in those\naffairs; and how happy I had been in some parts of management. There I\nhope soon to see you, my dear Dr. Bartlett, from the Levant, to whose\ncare I can so safely consign my precious trust, while I go to Paris, and\nattend the wished-for call of my father to my native country, from which\nI have been for so many years an exile.\n\nThere also, I hope to have some opportunities of conversing with my good\nMrs. Beaumont; resolving to make another effort to get so valuable a\nperson to restore herself to my beloved England.\n\nThus, my dear Dr. Bartlett, do I endeavour to console myself, in order to\nlighten that load of grief which I labour under on the distresses of the\ndear Clementina. If I can leave her happy, I shall be sooner so, than I\ncould have been in the same circumstances, had I, from the first of my\nacquaintance with the family, (to the breach of all the laws of\nhospitality,) indulged a passion for her.\n\nYet is the unhappy Olivia a damp upon my endeavours after consolation.\nWhen she made her unseasonable visit to me at Bologna, she refused to\nreturn to Florence without me, till I assured her, that as my affairs\nwould soon call me thither, I would visit her at her own palace, as often\nas those affairs would permit. Her pretence for coming to Bologna was,\nto induce me to place Emily with her, till I had settled every thing for\nmy carrying the child to England; but I was obliged to be peremptory in\nmy denial, though she had wrought so with Emily, as to induce her to be\nan earnest petitioner to me, to permit her to live with Lady Olivia,\nwhose equipages, and the glare in which she lives, had dazzled the eyes\nof the young lady.\n\n\n***\n\n\nI was impatient to hear again from Jeronymo; and just as I was setting\nout for Florence, in despair of that favour, it being the second day\nafter my farewell visit, I had the following letter from him:\n\n\nI have not been well, my dear Grandison. I am afraid the wound in my\nshoulder must be laid open again. God give me patience! But my life is\na burden to me.\n\nWe are driving here at a strange rate. They promised to keep measures\nwith the dear creature; but she has heard that you are leaving Bologna,\nand raves to see you.\n\nPoor soul! She endeavoured to prevail upon her father, mother, aunt, to\npermit her to see you, but for five minutes: that was the petition which\nwas denied her, as I mentioned in my last.\n\nCamilla was afraid that she would go into a gloomy fit upon it, as I told\nyou--She did; but it lasted not long: for she made an effort, soon after,\nto go out of the house by way of the garden. The gardener refused his\nkey, and brought Camilla to her, whom she had, by an innocent piece of\nart, but just before, sent to bring her something from her toilette.\n\nThe general went with Camilla to her. They found her just setting a\nladder against the wall. She heard them, and screamed, and, leaving the\nladder, ran, to avoid them, till she came in sight of the great cascade;\ninto which, had she not by a cross alley been intercepted by the general,\nit is feared she would have thrown herself.\n\nThis has terrified us all: she begs but for one interview; one parting\ninterview; and she promises to make herself easy: but it is not thought\nadvisable. Yet Father Marescotti himself thought it best to indulge her.\nHad my mother been earnest, I believe it had been granted: but she is so\nmuch concerned at the blame she met with on permitting the last\ninterview, that she will not contend, though she has let them know, that\nshe did not oppose the request.\n\nThe unhappy girl ran into my chamber this morning --Jeronymo; he will be\ngone! said she: I know he will. All I want, is but to see him! To wish\nhim happy! And to know, if he will remember me when he is gone, as I\nshall him!--Have you no interest, Jeronymo? Cannot I once see him? Not\nonce?\n\nThe bishop, before I could answer, came in quest of her, followed by\nLaurana, from whom she had forcibly disengaged herself, to come to me.\n\nLet me have but one parting interview, my lord, said she, looking to him,\nand clinging about my neck. He will be gone: gone for ever. Is there so\nmuch in being allowed to say, Farewell, and be happy, Grandison! and\nexcuse all the trouble I have given you?--What has my brother's preserver\ndone, what have I done, that I must not see him, nor he me, for one\nquarter of an hour only?\n\nIndeed, my lord, said I, she should be complied with. Indeed she should.\n\nMy father thinks otherwise, said the bishop: the count thinks otherwise:\nI think otherwise. Were the chevalier a common man, she might. But she\ndwells upon what passed in the last interview, and his behaviour to her.\nThat, it is plain, did her harm.\n\nThe next may drive the thoughts of that out of her head, returned I.\n\nDear Jeronymo, replied he, a little peevishly, you will always think\ndifferently from every body else! Mrs. Beaumont comes to-morrow.\n\nWhat do I care for Mrs. Beaumont? said she.--I don't love her: she tells\nevery thing I say.\n\nCome, my dear love, said Laurana, you afflict your brother Jeronymo. Let\nus go up to your own chamber.\n\nI afflict every body, and every body afflicts me; and you are all cruel.\nWhy, he will be gone, I tell you! That makes me so impatient: and I have\nsomething to say to him. My father won't see me: my mother renounces me.\nI have been looking for her, and she hides herself from me!--And I am a\nprisoner, and watched, and used ill!\n\nHere comes my mother! said Laurana. You now must go up to your chamber,\ncousin Clementina.\n\nSo she does, said she; now I must go, indeed!--Ah, Jeronymo! Now there\nis no saying nay.--But it is hard! very hard!--And she burst into tears.\nI won't speak though, said she, to my aunt. Remember, I will be silent,\nmadam!--Then whispering me, My aunt, brother, is not the aunt she used to\nbe to me!--But hush, I don't complain, you know!\n\nBy this I saw that Lady Sforza was severe with her.\n\nShe addressed herself to her aunt: You are not my mamma, are you, madam?\n\nNo, child.\n\nNo, child, indeed! I know that too well. But my brother Giacomo is as\ncruel to me as any body. But hush, Jeronymo!--Don't you betray me!--Now\nmy aunt is come, I must go!--I wish I could run away from you all!\n\nShe was yesterday detected writing a letter to you. My mother was shewn\nwhat she had written, and wept over it. My aunt took it out of my\nsister's bosom, where she had thrust it, on her coming in. This she\nresented highly.\n\nWhen she was led into her own chamber, she refused to speak; but in great\nhurry went to her closet, and, taking down her bible, turned over one\nleaf and another very quick. Lady Sforza had a book in her hand, and sat\nover-against the closet-door to observe her motions. She came to a\nplace--Pretty! said she.\n\nThe bishop had formerly given her a smattering of Latin--She took pen and\nink, and wrote. You'll see, chevalier, the very great purity of her\nthoughts, by what she omitted, and what she chose, from the Canticles.\nVelut unguentum diffunditur nomen tuum &c.\n\n[In the English translation, thus: Thy name is as ointment poured forth;\ntherefore do the virgins love thee. Draw me; we will run after thee: the\nupright love thee.\n\nLook not upon me because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me.\nMy mother's children were angry with me: they made me the keeper of the\nvineyards, but mine own vineyard have I not kept.\n\nTell me, O thou whom my soul loveth! where thou feedest, where thou\nmakest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth\naside by the flocks of thy companions?]\n\nShe laid down her pen, and was thoughtful; her elbow resting on the\nescritoire she wrote upon, her hand supporting her head.\n\nMay I look over you, my dear? said her aunt, stepping to her; and, taking\nup the paper, read it, and took it out of the closet with her, unopposed;\nher gentle bosom only heaving sighs.\n\nI will write no more, so minutely, on this affecting subject, my\nGrandison.\n\nThey are all of opinion that she will be easy, when she knows that you\nhave actually left Bologna; and they strengthen their opinion by these\nwords of hers, above-recited; 'Why he will be gone, I tell you; and this\nmakes me so impatient.'--At least, they are resolved to try the\nexperiment. And so, my dear Grandison, you must be permitted to leave\nus!\n\nGod be your director and comforter, as well as ours! prays\n\nYour ever affectionate\nJERONYMO.\n\n\n***\n\n\nMr. Grandison, having no hopes of being allowed to see the unhappy lady,\nset out with a heavy heart for Florence. He gave orders there, and at\nLeghorn, that the clerks and agents of his late friend Mr. Jervois should\nprepare every thing for his inspection against his return from Naples;\nand then he set out for that city, to attend the general.\n\nHe had other friends to whom he had endeared himself at Sienna, Ancona,\nand particularly at Rome, as he had also some at Naples; of whom he\nintended to take leave, before he set out for Paris: and therefore went\nto attend the general with the greater pleasure.\n\nWithin the appointed time he arrived at Naples.\n\nThe general received me, said Mr. Grandison, with greater tokens of\npoliteness than affection. You are the happiest man in the world,\nchevalier, said he, after the first compliments, in escaping dangers by\nbraving them. I do assure you, that I had great difficulties to deny\nmyself the favour of paying you a visit in my own way at Bologna. I had\nindeed resolved to do it, till you proposed this visit to me here.\n\nI should have been very sorry, replied I, to have seen a brother of Lady\nClementina in any way that should not have made me consider him as her\nbrother. But, before I say another word, let me ask after her health.\nHow does the most excellent of women?\n\nYou have not heard, then?\n\nI have not, my lord: but it is not for want of solicitude: I have sent\nthree several messengers: but can hear nothing to my satisfaction.\n\nNor can you hear any thing from me that will give you any.\n\nI am grieved at my soul, that I cannot. How, my lord, do the marquis and\nmarchioness?\n\nDon't ask. They are extremely unhappy.\n\nI hear that my dear friend, Signor Jeronymo, has undergone--\n\nA dreadful operation, interrupted the general.--He has. Poor Jeronymo!\nHe could not write to you. God preserve my brother! But, chevalier, you\ndid not save half a life, though we thank you for that, when you restored\nhim to our arms.\n\nI had no reason to boast, my lord, of the accident. I never made a merit\nof it. It was a mere accident, and cost me nothing. The service was\ngreatly over-rated.\n\nWould to God, chevalier, it had been rendered by any other man in the\nworld!\n\nAs it has proved, I am sure, my lord, I have reason to join in the wish.\n\nHe shewed me his pictures, statues, and cabinet of curiosities, while\ndinner was preparing; but rather for the ostentation of his magnificence\nand taste, than to do me pleasure. I even observed an increasing\ncoldness in his behaviour; and his eye was too often cast upon me with a\nfierceness that shewed resentment; and not with the hospitable frankness\nthat became him to a visitor and guest, who had undertaken a journey of\nabove two hundred miles, principally to attend him, and to shew him the\nconfidence he had in his honour. This, as it was more to his dishonour\nthan mine, I pitied him for. But what most of all disturbed me, was,\nthat I could not obtain from him any particular intelligence relating to\nthe health of one person, whose distresses lay heavy upon my heart.\n\nThere were several persons of distinction at dinner; the discourse could\ntherefore be only general. He paid me great respect at his table, but it\nwas a solemn one. I was the more uneasy at it, as I apprehended, that\nthe situation of the Bologna family was more unhappy than when I left\nthat city.\n\nHe retired with me into his garden. You stay with me at least the week\nout, chevalier?\n\nNo, my lord: I have affairs of a deceased friend at Florence and at\nLeghorn to settle. To-morrow, as early as I can, I shall set out for\nRome, in my way to Tuscany.\n\nI am surprised, chevalier. You take something amiss in my behaviour.\n\nI cannot say that your lordship's countenance (I am a very free speaker)\nhas that benignity in it, that complacency, which I have had the pleasure\nto see in it.\n\nBy G--! chevalier, I could have loved you better than any man in the\nworld, next to the men of my own family; but I own I see you not here\nwith so much love as admiration.\n\nThe word admiration, my lord, may require explanation. You may admire at\nmy confidence: but I thank you for the manly freedom of your\nacknowledgment in general.\n\nBy admiration I mean, all that may do you honour. Your bravery in coming\nhither, particularly; and your greatness of mind on your taking leave of\nus all. But did you not then mean to insult me?\n\nI meant to observe to you then, as I now do in your own palace, that you\nhad not treated me as my heart told me I deserved to be treated: but when\nI thought your warmth was rising to the uneasiness of your assembled\nfriends, instead of answering your question about my stay at Bologna, as\nyou seemed to mean it, I invited myself to an attendance upon you here,\nat Naples, in such a manner as surely could not be construed as insult.\n\nI own, Grandison, you disconcerted me. I had intended to save you that\njourney.\n\nWas that your lordship's meaning, when, in my absence, you called at my\nlodgings, the day after the farewell-visit?\n\nNot absolutely: I was uneasy with myself. I intended to talk to you.\nWhat that talk might have produced, I know not: but had I invited you\nout, if I had found you at home, would you have answered my demands?\n\nAccording as you had put them.\n\nWill you answer them now, if I attend you as far as Rome, on your return\nto Florence?\n\nIf they are demands fit to be answered.\n\nDo you expect I will make any that are not fit to be answered?\n\nMy lord, I will explain myself. You had conceived causeless prejudices\nagainst me: you seemed inclined to impute to me a misfortune that was\nnot, could not be, greater to you than it was to me. I knew my own\ninnocence: I knew that I was rather an injured man, in having hopes given\nme, in which I was disappointed, not by my own fault: whom shall an\ninnocent and an injured man fear?--Had I feared, my fear might have been\nmy destruction. For was I not in the midst of your friends? A\nforeigner? If I would have avoided you, could I, had you been determined\nto seek me?--I would choose to meet even an enemy as a man of honour,\nrather than to avoid him as a malefactor. In my country, the law\nsupposes flight a confession of guilt. Had you made demands upon me that\nI had not chosen to answer, I would have expostulated with you. I could\nperhaps have done so as calmly as I now speak. If you would not have\nbeen expostulated with, I would have stood upon my defence: but for the\nworld I would not have hurt a brother of Clementina and Jeronymo, a son\nof the marquis and marchioness of Porretta, could I have avoided it. Had\nyour passion given me any advantage over you, and I had obtained your\nsword, (a pistol, had the choice been left to me, I had refused for both\nour sakes,) I would have presented both swords to you, and bared my\nbreast: It was before penetrated by the distresses of the dear\nClementina, and of all your family--Perhaps I should only have said, 'If\nyour lordship thinks I have injured you, take your revenge.'\n\nAnd now, that I am at Naples, let me say, that if you are determined,\ncontrary to all my hopes, to accompany me to Rome, or elsewhere, on my\nreturn, with an unfriendly purpose; such, and no other, shall be my\nbehaviour to you, if the power be given me to shew it. I will rely on my\nown innocence, and hope by generosity to overcome a generous man. Let\nthe guilty secure themselves by violence and murder.\n\nSuperlative pride! angrily said he, and stood still, measuring me with\nhis eye: And could you hope for such an advantage?\n\nWhile I, my lord, was calm, and determined only upon self-defence; while\nyou were passionate, and perhaps rash, as aggressors generally are; I did\nnot doubt it: but could I have avoided drawing, and preserved your good\nopinion, I would not have drawn. Your lordship cannot but know my\nprinciples.\n\nGrandison, I do know them; and also the general report in your favour for\nskill and courage. Do you think I would have heard with patience of the\nonce proposed alliance, had not your character--And then he was pleased\nto say many things in my favour, from the report of persons who had\nweight with him; some of whom he named.\n\nBut still, Grandison, said he, this poor girl!--She could not have been\nso deeply affected, had not some lover-like arts--\n\nLet me, my lord, interrupt you--I cannot bear an imputation of this kind.\nHad such arts been used, the lady could not have been so much affected.\nCannot you think of your noble sister, as a daughter of the two houses\nfrom which you sprang? Cannot you see her, as by Mrs. Beaumont's means\nwe now so lately have been able to see her, struggling nobly with her own\nheart, [Why am I put upon this tender subject?] because of her duty and\nher religion; and resolved to die rather than encourage a wish that was\nnot warranted by both?--I cannot, my lord, urge this subject: but there\nnever was a passion so nobly contended with. There never was a man more\ndisinterested, and so circumstanced. Remember only, my voluntary\ndeparture from Bologna, against persuasion; and the great behaviour of\nyour sister on that occasion; great, as it came out to be, when Mrs.\nBeaumont brought her to acknowledge what would have been my glory to have\nknown, could it have been encouraged; but is now made my heaviest\nconcern.\n\nIndeed, Grandison, she ever was a noble girl! We are too apt perhaps to\ngovern ourselves by events, without looking into causes: but the access\nyou had to her; such a man! and who became known to us from circumstances\nso much in his favour, both as a man of principle and bravery--\n\nThis, my lord, interrupted I, is still judging from events. You have\nseen Mrs. Beaumont's letter. Surely you cannot have a nobler monument of\nmagnanimity in woman! And to that I refer, for a proof of my own\nintegrity.\n\nI have that letter: Jeronymo gave it me, at my taking leave of him; and\nwith these words: 'Grandison will certainly visit you at Naples. I am\nafraid of your warmth. His spirit is well known. All my dependance is\nupon his principles. He will not draw but in his own defence. Cherish\nthe noble visitor. Surely, brother, I may depend upon your hospitable\ntemper. Read over again this letter, before you see him.'--I have not\nyet read it, proceeded the general; but I will, and that, if you will\nallow me, now.\n\nHe took it out of his pocket, walked from me, and read it; and then came\nto me, and took my hand--I am half ashamed of myself, my dear Grandison:\nI own I wanted magnanimity. All the distresses of our family, on this\nunhappy girl's account, were before my eyes, and I received you, I\nbehaved to you, as the author of them. I was contriving to be\ndissatisfied with you: Forgive me, and command my best services. I will\nlet our Jeronymo know how greatly you subdued me before I had recourse to\nthe letter; but that I have since read that part of it which accounts for\nmy sister's passion, and wish I had read it with equal attention before.\nI acquit you: I am proud of my sister. Yet I observe from this very\nletter, that Jeronymo's gratitude has contributed to the evil we deplore.\nBut--Let us not say one word more of the unhappy girl: It is painful to\nme to talk of her.\n\nNot ask a question, my lord?--\n\nDon't, Grandison, don't!--Jeronymo and Clementina are my soul's woe--But\nthey are not worse than might be apprehended. You go to court with me\nto-morrow: I will present you to the king.\n\nI have had that honour formerly. I must depart to-morrow morning early.\nI have already taken leave of several of my friends here: I have some to\nmake my compliments to at Rome, which I reserved for my return.\n\nYou stay with me to-night?--I intend it, my lord.\n\nWell, we will return to company. I must make my excuses to my friends.\nYour departure to-morrow must be one. They all admire you. They are\nacquainted with your character. They will join with me to engage you, if\npossible, to stay longer.--We returned to the company.\n\n\n\nLETTER IV\n\nMISS BYRON, TO MISS SELBY\n\n\nReceive now, my dear, the doctor's thirteenth letter, and the last he\nintends to favour us with, till he entertains us with the histories of\nMrs. Beaumont, and Lady Olivia.\n\n\n***\n\n\nDR. BARTLETT'S THIRTEENTH LETTER\n\nMr. Grandison set out next morning. The general's behaviour to him at\nhis departure, was much more open and free than it was at receiving him.\n\nMr. Grandison, on his return to Florence, entered into the affairs of his\nlate friend Mr. Jervois, with the spirit, and yet with the temper, for\nwhich he is noted, when he engages in any business. He put every thing\nin a happy train in fewer days than it would have cost some other persons\nmonths; for he was present himself on every occasion, and in every\nbusiness, where his presence would accelerate it; yet he had\nembarrassments from Olivia.\n\nHe found, before he set out for Naples, that Mrs. Beaumont, at the\nearnest request of the marchioness, was gone to Bologna. At his return,\nnot hearing any thing from Signor Jeronymo, he wrote to Mrs. Beaumont,\nrequesting her to inform him of the state of things in that family, as\nfar as she thought proper; and, particularly, of the health of that dear\nfriend, on whose silence to three letters he had written, he had the most\nmelancholy apprehensions. He let that lady know, that he should set out\nin a very few days for Paris, if he had no probability of being of\nservice to the family she favoured with her company.\n\nTo this letter Mrs. Beaumont returned the following answer:\n\n\nSIR,\n\nI have the favour of yours. We are very miserable here. The servants\nare forbidden to answer any inquiries, but generally; and that not truly.\n\nYour friend, Signor Jeronymo, has gone through a severe operation. He\nhas been given over; but hopes are now entertained, not of his absolute\nrecovery, but that he will be no worse than he was before the necessity\nfor the operation arose. Poor man! He forgot not, however, his sister\nand you, when he was out of the power of the opiates that were\nadministered to him.\n\nOn my coming hither, I found Lady Clementina in a deplorable way:\nSometimes raving, sometimes gloomy; and in bonds--Twice had she given\nthem apprehensions of fatal attempts: they, therefore, confined her\nhands.\n\nThey have been excessively wrong in their management of her: now\nsoothing, now severe; observing no method.\n\nShe was extremely earnest to see you before you left Bologna. On her\nknees repeatedly she besought this favour, and promised to be easy if\nthey would comply; but they imagined that their compliance would\naggravate the symptoms.\n\nI very freely blamed them for not complying, at the time when she was so\ndesirous of seeing you. I told them, that soothing her would probably\nthen have done good.\n\nWhen they knew you were actually gone from Bologna, they told her so.\nCamilla shocked me with the description of her rage and despair, on the\ncommunication. This was followed by fits of silence, and the deepest\nmelancholy.\n\nThey had hopes, on my arrival, that my company would have been of service\nto her: but for two days together she regarded me not, nor any thing I\ncould say to her. On the third of my arrival, finding her confinement\nextremely uneasy to her, I prevailed, but with great difficulty, to have\nher restored to the use of her hands; and to be allowed to walk with me\nin the garden. They had hinted to me their apprehensions about a piece\nof water.\n\nHer woman being near us, if there had been occasion for assistance, I\ninsensibly led that way. She sat down on a seat over-against the great\ncascade; but she made no motion that gave me apprehensions. From this\ntime she has been fonder of me than before. The day I obtained this\nliberty for her, she often clasped her arms about me, and laid her face\nin my bosom; and I could plainly see, it was in gratitude for restoring\nto her the use of her arms: but she cared not to speak.\n\nIndeed she generally affects deep silence: yet, at times, I see her very\nsoul is fretted. She moves to one place, is tired of that, shifts to\nanother, and another, all round the room.\n\nI am grieved at my heart for her: I never knew a more excellent young\ncreature.\n\nShe is very attentive at her devotions, and as constant in them as she\nused to be: Every good habit she preserves; yet, at other times, rambles\nmuch.\n\nShe is often for writing letters to you; but when what she writes is\nprivately taken from her, she makes no inquiry about it, but takes a new\nsheet, and begins again.\n\nSometimes she draws; but her subjects are generally angels and saints.\nShe often meditates in a map of the British dominions, and now and then\nwishes she were in England.\n\nLady Juliana de Sforza is earnest to have her with her at Urbino, or at\nMilan, where she has also a noble palace; but I hope it will not be\ngranted. That lady professes to love her; but she cannot be persuaded\nout of her notion of harsh methods, which will never do with Clementina.\n\nI shall not be able to stay long with her. The discomposure of so\nexcellent a young creature affects me deeply. Could I do her either good\nor pleasure, I should be willing to deny myself the society of my dear\nfriends at Florence: but I am persuaded, and have hinted as much, that\none interview with you would do more to settle her mind, than all the\nmethods they have taken.\n\nI hope, sir, to see you before you leave Italy. It must be at Florence,\nnot at Bologna, I believe. It is generous of you to propose the latter.\n\nI have now been here a week, without hope. The doctors they have\nconsulted are all for severe methods, and low diet. The first, I think,\nis in compliment to some of the family. She is so loath to take\nnourishment, and when she does, is so very abstemious, that the regimen\nis hardly necessary. She never, or but very seldom, used to drink any\nthing but water.\n\nShe took it into her poor head several times this day, and perhaps it\nwill hold, to sit in particular places, to put on attentive looks, as if\nshe were listening to somebody. She sometimes smiled, and seemed\npleased; looked up, as if to somebody, and spoke English. I have no\ndoubt, though I was not present when she assumed these airs, and talked\nEnglish, but her disordered imagination brought before her her tutor\ninstructing her in that tongue.\n\nYou desired me, sir, to be very particular. I have been so; but at the\nexpense of my eyes: and I shall not wonder if your humane heart should be\naffected by my sad tale.\n\nGod preserve you, and prosper you in whatsoever you undertake!\n\nHORTENSIA BEAUMONT\n\n\nMrs. Beaumont staid at Bologna twelve days, and then left the unhappy\nyoung lady.\n\nAt taking leave, she asked her, what commands she had for her?--Love me,\nsaid she, and pity me; that is one. Another is, (whispering her,) you\nwill see the chevalier, perhaps, though I must not.--Tell him, that his\npoor friend Clementina is sometimes very unhappy!--Tell him, that she\nshall rejoice to sit next him in heaven!--Tell him, that I say he cannot\ngo thither, good man as he is, while he shuts his eyes to the truth.--\nTell him, that I shall take it very kindly of him, if he will not think\nof marrying till he acquaints me with it; and can give me assurance, that\nthe lady will love him as well as somebody else would have done.--O Mrs.\nBeaumont! should the Chevalier Grandison marry a woman unworthy of him,\nwhat a disgrace would that be to me!\n\nMr. Grandison by this time had prepared everything for his journey to\nParis. The friend he honoured with his love, was arrived from the\nLevant, and the Archipelago. Thither, at his patron's request, he had\naccompanied Mr. Beauchamp, the amiable friend of both; and at parting,\nengaged to continue by letter what had been the subject of their daily\nconversations, and transmit to him as many particulars as he could obtain\nof Mr. Grandison's sentiments and behaviour, on every occasion; Mr.\nBeauchamp proposing him as a pattern to himself, that he might be worthy\nof the credential letters he had furnished him with to every one whom he\nhad thought deserving of his own acquaintance, when he was in the parts\nwhich Mr. Beauchamp intended to visit.\n\nTo the care of the person so much honoured by his confidence, Mr.\nGrandison left his agreeable ward, Miss Jervois; requesting the\nassistance of Mrs. Beaumont, who kindly promised her inspection; and with\nthe goodness for which she is so eminently noted, performed her promise\nin his absence.\n\nHe then made an offer to the bishop to visit Bologna once more; but that\nnot being accepted, he set out for Paris.\n\nIt was not long before his Father's death called him to England; and when\nhe had been there a few weeks, he sent for his ward and his friend.\n\nBut, my good Miss Byron, you will say, That I have not yet fully answered\nyour last inquiry, relating to the present situation of the unhappy\nClementina.\n\nI will briefly inform you of it.\n\nWhen it was known, for certain, that Mr. Grandison had actually left\nItaly, the family at Bologna began to wish that they had permitted the\ninterview so much desired by the poor lady: and when they afterwards\nunderstood that he was sent for to England, to take possession of his\npaternal estate, that farther distance, (the notion likewise of the seas\nbetween them appearing formidable,) added to their regrets.\n\nThe poor lady was kept in travelling motion to quiet her mind: for still\nan interview with Mr. Grandison having never been granted, it was her\nfirst wish.\n\nThey carried her to Urbino, to Rome, to Naples; then back to Florence,\nthen to Milan, to Turin.\n\nWhether they made her hope that it was to meet with Mr. Grandison, I know\nnot; but it is certain, she herself expected to see him at the end of\nevery journey; and, while she was moving, was easier, and more composed;\nperhaps in that hope.\n\nThe marchioness was sometimes of the party. The air and exercise were\nthought proper for her health, as well as for that of her daughter. Her\ncousin Laurana was always with her in these excursions, and sometimes\nLady Sforza; and their escort was, generally, Signors Sebastiano and\nJuliano.\n\nBut, within these four months past, these journeyings have been\ndiscontinued. The young lady accuses them of deluding her with vain\nhopes. She is impatient, and has made two attempts to escape from them.\n\nShe is, for this reason, closely confined and watched.\n\nThey put her once into a nunnery, at the motion of Lady Sforza, as for a\ntrial only. She was not uneasy in it: but this being done unknown to the\ngeneral, when he was apprised of it, he, for reasons I cannot comprehend,\nwas displeased, and had her taken out directly.\n\nHer head runs more than ever upon seeing her tutor, her friend, her\nchevalier, once more. They have certainly been to blame, if they have\nlet her travel with such hopes; because they have thereby kept up her\nardour for an interview. Could she but once more see him, she says, and\nlet him know the cruelty she has been treated with, she should be\nsatisfied. He would pity her, she is sure, though nobody else will.\n\nThe bishop has written to beg, that Sir Charles would pay them one more\nvisit at Bologna.\n\nI will refer to my patron himself the communicating to you, ladies, his\nresolution on this subject. I had but a moment's sight of the letters\nwhich so greatly affected him.\n\nIt is but within these few days past that this new request has been made\nto him, in a direct manner. The question was before put, If such a\nrequest should be made, would he comply? And once Camilla wrote, as\nhaving heard Sir Charles's presence wished for.\n\nMean time the poor lady is hastening, they are afraid, into a consumptive\nmalady. The Count of Belvedere, however, still adores her. The disorder\nin her mind being imputed chiefly to religious melancholy, and some of\nher particular flights not being generally known, he, who is a pious man\nhimself, pities her; and declares, that he would run all risks of her\nrecovery, would the family give her to him: and yet he knows, that she\nwould choose to be the wife of the Chevalier Grandison, rather than that\nof any other man, were the article of religion to be got over; and\ngenerously applauds her for preferring her faith to her love.\n\nSignor Jeronymo is in a very bad way. Sir Charles often writes to him,\nand with an affection worthy of the merits of that dear friend. He was\nto undergo another severe operation on the next day after the letters\ncame from Bologna; the success of which was very doubtful.\n\nHow nobly does Sir Charles appear to support himself under such heavy\ndistresses! For those of his friends were ever his. But his heart\nbleeds in secret for them. A feeling heart is a blessing that no one,\nwho has it, would be without; and it is a moral security of innocence;\nsince the heart that is able to partake of the distress of another,\ncannot wilfully give it.\n\nI think, my good Miss Byron, that I have now, as far as I am at present\nable, obeyed all your commands that concern the unhappy Clementina, and\nher family. I will defer, if you please, those which relate to Olivia\nand Mrs. Beaumont, ladies of very different characters from each other,\nhaving several letters to write.\n\nPermit me, my good ladies, and my lord, after contributing so much to\nafflict your worthy hearts, to refer you, for relief under all the\ndistresses of life, whether they affect ourselves or others, to those\nmotives that can alone give true support to a rational mind. This mortal\nscene, however perplexing, is a very short one; and the hour is hastening\nwhen all the intricacies of human affairs shall be cleared up; and all\nthe sorrows that have had their foundation in virtue be changed into the\nhighest joy: when all worthy minds shall be united in the same interests,\nthe same happiness.\n\nAllow me to be, my good Miss Byron, and you, my Lord and Lady L----, and\nMiss Grandison,\n\nYour most faithful and obedient servant,\nAMBROSE BARTLETT.\n\n\nExcellent Dr. Bartlett!--How worthy of himself is this advice! But think\nyou not, my Lucy, that the doctor has in it a particular view to your\npoor Harriet? A generous one, meaning consolation and instruction to\nher? I will endeavour to profit by it. Let me have your prayers, my\ndear friends, that I may be enabled to succeed in my humble endeavours.\n\nIt will be no wonder to us now, that Sir Charles was not solicitous to\nmake known a situation so embarrassing to himself, and so much involved\nin clouds and uncertainty: but whatever may be the event of this affair,\nyou, Lucy, and all my friends, will hardly ever know me by any other name\nthan that of\n\nHARRIET BYRON.\n\n\n\nLETTER V\n\nMISS HARRIET BYRON, TO MISS LUCY SELBY\nFRIDAY, MARCH 31.\n\n\n\nYou now, my dear friends, have before you this affecting story, as far as\nDr. Bartlett can give it. My cousins express a good deal of concern for\nyour Harriet: so does Miss Grandison: so doth my Lord and Lady L----: and\nthe more, as I seem to carry off the matter with assumed bravery. This\ntheir kind concern for me looks, however, as if they thought me a\nhypocrite; and I suppose, therefore, that I act my part very awkwardly.\n\nBut, my dear, as this case is one of those few in which a woman can shew\na bravery of spirit, I think an endeavour after it is laudable; and the\nrather, as in my conduct I aim at giving a tacit example to Miss Jervois.\n\nThe doctor has whisper'd to me, that Lady Olivia is actually on her way\nto England; and that the intelligence Sir Charles received of her\nintention, was one of the things that disturbed him, as the news of his\nbeloved Signor Jeronymo's dangerous condition was another.\n\nLady Anne S----, it seems, has not yet given up her hopes of Sir Charles.\nThe two sisters, who once favoured her above all the women they knew,\nhave not been able to bring themselves to acquaint a lady of her rank,\nmerit, and fortune, that there can be no hopes; and they are still more\nloath to say, that their brother thinks himself under some obligation to\na foreign lady. Yet you know that this was always what we were afraid\nof: but, who, now, will say afraid, that knows the merit of Clementina?\n\nI wish, methinks, that this man were proud, vain, arrogant, and a\nboaster. How easily then might one throw off one's shackles!\n\nLord G---- is very diligent in his court to Miss Grandison. His father\nand aunt are to visit her this afternoon. She behaves whimsically to my\nlord: yet I cannot think that she greatly dislikes him.\n\nThe Earl of D---- and the Countess Dowager are both in town. The\nCountess made a visit to my cousin Reeves last Tuesday: she spoke of me\nvery kindly: she says that my lord has heard so much of me, that he is\nvery desirous of seeing me: but she was pleased to say, that, since my\nheart was not disengaged, she should be afraid of the consequences of his\nvisit to himself.\n\nMy grandmamma, though she was so kindly fond of me, would not suffer me\nto live with her; because she thought, that her contemplative temper\nmight influence mine, and make me grave, at a time of life, when she is\nalways saying, that cheerfulness is most becoming: she would therefore\nturn over her girl to the best of aunts. But now I fancy, she will allow\nme to be more than two days in a week her attendant. My uncle Selby will\nbe glad to spare me. I shall not be able to bear a jest: and then, what\nshall I be good for?\n\nI have made a fine hand of coming to town, he says: and so I have: but if\nmy heart is not quite so easy as it was, it is, I hope, a better, at\nleast not a worse heart than I brought up with me. Could I only have\nadmired this man, my excursion would not have been unhappy. But this\ngratitude, this entangling, with all its painful consequence--But let me\nsay, with my grandmamma, the man is Sir Charles Grandison! The very man\nby whose virtues a Clementina was attracted. Upon my word, my dear,\nunhappy as she is, I rank her with the first of women.\n\nI have not had a great deal of Sir Charles Grandison's company; but yet\nmore, I am afraid, than I shall ever have again. Very true--O heart! the\nmost wayward of hearts, sigh if thou wilt!\n\nYou have seen how little he was with us, when we were absolutely in his\nreach, and when he, as we thought, was in ours. But such a man cannot,\nought not to be engrossed by one family. Bless me, Lucy, when he comes\ninto public life, (for has not his country a superior claim to him beyond\nevery private one?) what moment can he have at liberty? Let me enumerate\nsome of his present engagements that we know of.\n\nThe Danby family must have some farther portion of his time.\n\nThe executorship in the disposal of the 3000\u00c2\u00a3. in charity, in France as\nwell as in England, will take up a good deal more.\n\nMy Lord W---- may be said to be under his tutelage, as to the future\nhappiness of his life.\n\nMiss Jervois's affairs, and the care he has for her person, engage much\nof his attention.\n\nHe is his own steward.\n\nHe is making alterations at Grandison-hall; and has a large genteel\nneighbourhood there, who long to have him reside among them; and he\nhimself is fond of that seat.\n\nHis estate in Ireland is in a prosperous way, from the works he set on\nfoot there, when he was on the spot; and he talks, as Dr. Bartlett has\nhinted to us, of making another visit to it.\n\nHis sister's match with Lord G---- is one of his cares.\n\nHe has services to perform for his friend Beauchamp, with his father and\nmother-in-law, for the facilitating his coming over.\n\nThe apprehended visit of Olivia gives him disturbance.\n\nAnd the Bologna family in its various branches, and more especially\nSignor Jeronymo's dangerous state of health, and Signora Clementina's\ndisordered mind--O, Lucy!--What leisure has this man to be in love?--Yet\nhow can I say so, when he is in love already? And with Clementina.--And\ndon't you think, that when he goes to France on the executorship account,\nhe will make a visit to Bologna?--Ah, my dear, to be sure he will.\n\nAfter he has left England, therefore, which I suppose he will quickly do,\nand when I am in Northamptonshire, what opportunities will your Harriet\nhave to see him, except she can obtain, as a favour, the power of\nobliging his Emily, in her request to be with her? Then, Lucy, he may,\non his return to England, once a year or so, on his visiting his ward,\nsee, and thank for her care and love of his Emily, his half-estranged\nHarriet!--Perhaps Lady Clementina Grandison will be with him! God\nrestore her! Surely I shall be capable, if she be Lady Grandison, of\nrejoicing in her recovery!----\n\nFie upon it!--Why this involuntary tear? You would see it by the large\nblot it has made, if I did not mention it.\n\nExcellent man!--Dr. Bartlett has just been telling me of a morning visit\nhe received, before he went out of town, from the two sons of Mrs.\nOldham.\n\nOne of them is about seven years old; the other about five; very fine\nchildren. He embraced them, the doctor says, with as much tenderness, as\nif they were children of his own mother. He enquired into their\ninclinations, behaviour, diversions; and engaged equally their love and\nreverence.\n\nHe told them, that, if they were good, he would love them; and said, he\nhad a dear friend, whom he reverenced as his father, a man with white\ncurling locks, he told the children, that they might know him at first\nsight, who would now-and-then, as he happened to be in town, make\nenquiries after their good behaviour, and reward them, as they gave him\ncause. Accordingly he had desired Dr. Bartlett to give them occasionally\nhis countenance; as also to let their mother know, that he should be glad\nof a visit from her, and her three children, on his return to town.\n\nThe doctor had been to see her when he came to me. He found all three\nwith her. The two younger, impressed by the venerable description Sir\nCharles had given of him, voluntarily, the younger, by the elder's\nexample, fell down on their knees before him, and begged his blessing.\n\nMr. Oldham is about eighteen years of age; a well-inclined, well-educated\nyouth. He was full of acknowledgments of the favour done him in this\ninvitation.\n\nThe grateful mother could not contain herself. Blessings without number,\nshe invoked on her benefactor, for his goodness in taking such kind\nnotice of her two sons, as he had done; and said, he had been, ever since\nhis gracious behaviour to her in Essex, the first and last in her prayers\nto Heaven. But the invitation to herself, she declared, was too great an\nhonour for her to accept of: she should not be able to stand in his\npresence. Alas! sir, said she, can the severest, truest penitence recall\nthe guilty past?\n\nThe doctor said, that Sir Charles Grandison ever made it a rule with him,\nto raise the dejected and humbled spirit. Your birth and education,\nmadam, entitle you to a place in the first company: and where there are\ntwo lights in which the behaviour of any person may be set, though there\nhas been unhappiness, he always remembers the most favourable, and\nforgets the other. I would advise you, madam, (as he has invited you,)\nby all means to come. He speaks with pleasure of your humility and good\nsense.\n\nThe doctor told me, that Sir Charles had made inquiries after the\nmarriage of Major O'Hara with Mrs. Jervois, and had satisfied himself\nthat they were actually man and wife. Methinks I am glad for Miss\nJervois's sake, that her mother has changed her name. They lived not\nhappily together since their last enterprise: for the man, who had long\nbeen a sufferer from poverty, was in fear of losing one half at least of\nhis wife's annuity, by what passed on that occasion; and accused her of\nputting him upon the misbehaviour he was guilty of; which had brought\nupon him, he said, the resentments of a man admired by all the world.\n\nThe attorney, who visited Sir Charles from these people, at their\nrequest, waited on him again, in their names, with hopes that they should\nnot suffer in their annuity, and expressing their concern for having\noffended him.\n\nMrs. O'Hara also requested it as a favour to see her daughter.\n\nSir Charles commissioned the attorney, who is a man of repute, to tell\nthem, that if Mrs. O'Hara would come to St. James's-square next Wednesday\nabout five o'clock, Miss Jervois should be introduced to her; and she\nshould be welcome to bring with her her husband, and Captain Salmonet,\nthat they might be convinced he bore no ill-will to either of them.\n\nAdieu, till by and by. Miss Grandison is come, in one of her usual\nhurries, to oblige me to be present at the visit to be made her this\nafternoon, by the Earl of G---- and Lady Gertrude, his sister, a maiden\nlady advanced in years, who is exceedingly fond of her nephew, and\nintends to make him heir of her large fortune.\n\n\n***\n\n\nFRIDAY NIGHT.\n\nThe earl is an agreeable man: Lady Gertrude is a very agreeable woman.\nThey saw Miss Grandison with the young lord's eyes; and were better\npleased with her, as I told her afterwards, than I should have been, or\nthan they would, had they known her as well as I do. She doubted not,\nshe answered me, but I should find fault with her; and yet she was as\ngood as for her life she could be.\n\nSuch an archness in every motion! Such a turn of the eye to me on my\nLord G----'s assiduities! Such a fear in him of her correcting glance!\nSuch a half-timid, half-free parade when he had done any thing that he\nintended to be obliging, and now and then an aiming at raillery, as if he\nwas not very much afraid of her, and dared to speak his mind even to her!\nOn her part, on those occasions, such an air, as if she had a learner\nbefore her; and was ready to rap his knuckles, had nobody been present to\nmediate for him; that though I could not but love her for her very\narchness, yet in my mind, I could, for their sakes, but more for her own,\nhave severely chidden her.\n\nShe is a charming woman; and every thing she says and does becomes her.\nBut I am so much afraid of what may be the case, when the lover is\nchanged into the husband, that I wish to myself now and then, when I see\nher so lively, that she would remember that there was once such a man as\nCaptain Anderson. But she makes it a rule, she says, to remember nothing\nthat will vex her.\n\nIs not my memory (said she once) given me for my benefit, and shall I\nmake it my torment? No, Harriet, I will leave that to be done by you\nwise ones, and see what you will get by it.\n\nWhy this, Charlotte, replied I, the wise ones may have a chance to get by\nit--They will, very probably, by remembering past mistakes, avoid many\ninconveniencies into which forgetfulness will run you lively ones.\n\nWell, well, returned she, we are not all of us born to equal honour.\nSome of us are to be set up for warnings, some for examples: and the\nfirst are generally of greater use to the world than the other.\n\nNow, Charlotte, said I, do you destroy the force of your own argument.\nCan the person who is singled out for the warning, be near so happy, as\nshe that is set up for the example?\n\nYou are right as far as I know, Harriet: but I obey the present impulse,\nand try to find an excuse afterwards for what that puts me upon: and all\nthe difference is this, as to the reward, I have a joy: you a comfort:\nbut comfort is a poor word; and I can't bear it.\n\nSo Biddy, in 'The Tender Husband,' would have said, Charlotte. But poor\nas the word is with you and her, give me comfort rather than joy, if they\nmust be separated. But I see not but that a woman of my Charlotte's\nhappy turn may have both.\n\nShe tapped my cheek--Take that, Harriet, for making a Biddy of me. I\nbelieve, if you have not joy, you have comfort, in your severity.\n\nMy heart as well as my cheek glowed at the praises the earl and the lady\nboth joined in (with a fervor that was creditable to their own hearts) of\nSir Charles Grandison, while they told us what this man, and that woman\nof quality or consideration said of him. Who would not be good? What is\nlife without reputation? Do we not wish to be remembered with honour\nafter death? And what a share of it has this excellent man in his life!\n--May nothing, for the honour-sake of human nature, to which he is so\ngreat an ornament, ever happen to tarnish it!\n\nThey made me a hundred fine compliments. I could not but be pleased at\nstanding well in their opinion: but, believe me, my dear, I did not enjoy\ntheir praises of me, as I did those they gave him. Indeed, I had the\npresumption, from the approbation given to what they said of him by my\nown heart, to imagine myself a sharer in them, though not in his merits.\nOh, Lucy! ought there not to have been a relation between us, since what\nI have said, from what I found in myself on hearing him praised, is a\ndemonstration of a regard for him superior to the love of self?\n\nAdieu, my Lucy. I know I have all your prayers.\n\nAdieu, my dear!\n\n\n\nLETTER VI\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nSATURDAY, APRIL 1.\n\n\nDr. Bartlett is one of the kindest as well as best of men. I believe he\nloves me as if I were his own child: but good men must be affectionate\nmen. He received but this morning a letter from Sir Charles, and\nhastened to communicate some of its contents to me, though I could\npretend to no other motive but curiosity for wishing to be acquainted\nwith the proceedings of his patron.\n\nSir Charles dined, as he had intended, with Sir Hargrave and his friends.\nHe complains in his letter of a riotous day: yet I think, adds he, it has\nled me into some useful reflections. It is not indeed agreeable to be\nthe spectator of riot; but how easy to shun being a partaker in it! Ho\neasy to avoid the too freely circling glass, if a man is known to have\nestablished a rule to himself, from which he will not depart; and if it\nbe not refused sullenly; but mirth and good humour the more studiously\nkept up, by the person; who would else indeed be looked upon as a spy on\nunguarded folly! I heartily pitied a young man, who, I dare say, has a\ngood heart, but from false shame durst not assert the freedom that every\nEnglishman would claim a right to, in almost every other instance! He\nhad once put by the glass, and excused himself on account of his health;\nbut on being laughed at for a sober dog, as they phrased it, and asked,\nif his spouse had not lectured him before he came out, he gave way to the\nwretched raillery: nor could I interfere at such a noisy moment with\neffect: they had laughed him out of his caution before I could be heard;\nand I left him there at nine o'clock trying with Bagenhall which should\ndrink the deepest.\n\nI wish, my good Dr. Bartlett, you would throw together some serious\nconsiderations on this subject. You could touch it delicately, and such\na discourse would not be unuseful to some few of our neighbours even at\nGrandison-hall. What is it, that, in this single article, men sacrifice\nto false shame and false glory! Reason, health, fortune, personal\nelegance, the peace and order of their families; and all the comfort and\nhonour of their after-years. How peevish, how wretched, is the decline\nof a man worn out with intemperance! In a cool hour, resolutions might\nbe formed, that should stand the attack of a boisterous jest.\n\nI obtained leave from Dr. Bartlett, to transcribe this part of the\nletter. I thought my uncle would be pleased with it.\n\n\nIt was near ten at night, before Sir Charles got to Lord W----'s, though\nbut three miles from Sir Hargrave's. My lord rejoiced to see him; and,\nafter first compliments, asked him, if he had thought of what he had\nundertaken for him. Sir Charles told him, that he was the more desirous\nof seeing him in his way to the Hall, because he wanted to know if his\nlordship held his mind as to marriage. He assured him he did, and would\nsign and seal to whatever he should stipulate for him.\n\nI wished for a copy of this part of Sir Charles's letter, for the sake of\nmy aunt, whose delicacy would, I thought, be charmed with it. He has\nbeen so good as to say, he would transcribe it for me. I will enclose\nit, Lucy; and you will read it here:\n\n\nI cannot, my lord, said Sir Charles, engage, that the lady will comply\nwith the proposal I shall take the liberty to make to her mother and her.\nShe is not more than three or four and thirty: she is handsome: she has a\nfine understanding: she is brought up an economist: she is a woman of\ngood family: she has not, however, though born to happier prospects, a\nfortune worthy of your lordship's acceptance. Whatever that is, you\nwill, perhaps, choose to give it to her family.\n\nWith all my heart and soul, nephew: but do you say, she is handsome? Do\nyou say, she is of family? And has she so many good qualities?--Ah,\nnephew! She won't have me, I doubt.--And is she not too young, Sir\nCharles, to think of such a poor decrepit soul as I am?\n\nAll I can say to this, my lord, is, that the proposals on your part must\nbe the more generous--\n\nI will leave all those matters to you, kinsman--\n\nThis, my lord, I will take upon me to answer for, that she is a woman of\nprinciple: she will not give your lordship her hand, if she thinks she\ncannot make you a wife worthy of your utmost kindness: and now, my lord,\nI will tell you who she is, that you may make what other inquiries you\nthink proper.\n\nAnd then I named her to him, and gave him pretty near the account of the\nfamily, and the circumstances and affairs of it, that I shall by and by\ngive you; though you are not quite a stranger to the unhappy case.\n\nMy lord was in raptures: he knew something, he said, of the lady's\nfather, and enough of the family, by hearsay, to confirm all I had said\nof them; and besought me to do my utmost to bring the affair to a speedy\nconclusion.\n\nSir Thomas Mansfield was a very good man; and much respected in his\nneighbourhood. He was once possessed of a large estate; but his father\nleft him involved in a law-suit to support his title to more than one\nhalf of it.\n\nAfter it had been depending several years, it was at last, to the deep\nregret of all who knew him, by the chicanery of the lawyers of the\nopposite side, and the remissness of his own, carried against him; and\nhis expenses having been very great in supporting for years his\npossession, he found himself reduced from an estate of near three\nthousand pounds a year, to little more than five hundred. He had six\nchildren: four sons, and two daughters. His eldest son died of grief in\ntwo months after the loss of the cause. The second, now the eldest, is a\nmelancholy man. The third is a cornet of horse. The fourth is\nunprovided for; but all three are men of worthy minds, and deserve better\nfortune.\n\nThe daughters are remarkable for their piety, patience, good economy, and\nprudence. They are the most dutiful of children, and most affectionate\nof sisters. They were for three years the support of their father's\nspirits, and have always been the consolation of their mother. They lost\ntheir father about four years ago: and it is even edifying to observe,\nhow elegantly they support the family reputation in their fine old\nmansion-house by the prudent management of their little income; for the\nmother leaves every household care to them; and they make it a rule to\nconclude the year with discharging every demand that can be made upon\nthem, and to commence the new year absolutely clear of the world, and\nwith some cash in hand; yet were brought up in affluence, and to the\nexpectation of handsome fortunes; for, besides that they could have no\nthought of losing their cause, they had very great and reasonable\nprospects from Mr. Calvert, an uncle by their mother's side; who was rich\nin money, and had besides an estate in land of 1500\u00c2\u00a3. a year. He always\ndeclared, that, for the sake of his sister's children, he would continue\na single man; and kept his word till he was upwards of seventy; when,\nbeing very infirm in health, and defective even to dotage in his\nunderstanding, Bolton, his steward, who had always stood in the way of\nhis inclination to have his eldest niece for his companion and manager,\nat last contrived to get him married to a young creature under twenty,\none of the servants in the house; who brought him a child in seven\nmonths; and was with child again at the old man's death, which happened\nin eighteen months after his marriage: and then a will was provided, in\nwhich he gave all he had to his wife and her children born, and to be\nborn, within a year after his demise. This steward and woman now live\ntogether as man and wife.\n\nA worthy clergyman, who hoped it might be in my power to procure them\nredress, either in the one case or in the other, gave me the above\nparticulars; and upon inquiry, finding every thing to be as represented,\nI made myself acquainted with the widow lady and her sons: and it was\nimpossible to see them at their own house, and not respect the daughters\nfor their amiable qualities.\n\nI desired them, when I was last down, to put into my hands their titles,\ndeeds, and papers; which they have done; and they have been laid before\ncounsel, who give a very hopeful account of them.\n\nBeing fully authorized by my lord, I took leave of him over-night, and\nset out early in the morning, directly for Mansfield-house. I arrived\nthere soon after their breakfast was over, and was received by Lady\nMansfield, her sons, (who happened to be all at home,) and her two\ndaughters, with politeness.\n\nAfter some general conversation, I took Lady Mansfield aside; and making\nan apology for my freedom, asked her, If Miss Mansfield were, to her\nknowledge, engaged in her affections?\n\nShe answered, she was sure she was not: Ah, sir, said she, a man of your\nobservation must know, that the daughters of a decayed family of some\nnote in the world, do not easily get husbands. Men of great fortunes\nlook higher: men of small must look out for wives to enlarge them; and\nmen of genteel businesses are afraid of young women better born than\nportioned. Every body knows not that my girls can bend to their\ncondition; and they must be contented to live single all their lives; and\nso they will choose to do, rather than not marry creditably, and with\nsome prospect.\n\nI then opened my mind fully to her. She was agreeably surprised: but\nwho, sir, said she, would expect such a proposal from the next heir to\nLord W----?\n\nI made known to her how much in earnest I was in this proposal, as well\nfor my lord's sake, as for the young lady's. I will take care, madam,\nsaid I, that Miss Mansfield, if she will consent to make Lord W----\nhappy, shall have very handsome settlements, and such an allowance for\npin-money, as shall enable her to gratify every moderate, every\nreasonable, wish of her heart.\n\nWas it possible, she asked, for such an affair to be brought about?\nWould my lord--There she stopt.\n\nI said, I would be answerable for him: and desired her to break the\nmatter to her daughter directly.\n\nI left Lady Mansfield, and joined the brothers, who were with their two\nsisters; and soon after Miss Mansfield was sent for by her mother.\n\nAfter they had been a little while together, my Lady Mansfield sent to\nspeak with me. They were both silent when I came in. The mother was at\na loss what to say: the daughter was in still greater confusion.\n\nI addressed myself to the mother. You have, I perceive, madam,\nacquainted Miss Mansfield with the proposal I made to you. I am fully\nauthorized to make it. Propitious be your silence! There never was,\nproceeded I, a treaty of marriage set on foot, that had not its\nconveniencies and inconveniencies. My lord is greatly afflicted with the\ngout: there is too great a disparity in years. These are the\ninconveniencies which are to be considered of for the lady.\n\nOn the other hand, if Miss Mansfield can give into the proposal, she will\nbe received by my lord as a blessing; as one whose acceptance of him will\nlay him under an obligation to her. If this proposal could not have been\nmade with dignity and honour to the lady, it had not come from me.\n\nThe conveniencies to yourselves will more properly fall under the\nconsideration of yourselves and family. One thing only I will suggest,\nthat an alliance with so rich a man as Lord W----, will make, perhaps,\nsome people tremble, who now think themselves secure.\n\nBut, madam, to the still silent daughter, let not a regard for me bias\nyou: your family may be sure of my best services, whether my proposal be\nreceived or rejected.\n\nMy lord (I must deal sincerely with you) has lived a life of error. He\nthinks so himself. I am earnest to have him see the difference, and to\nhave an opportunity to rejoice with him upon it.\n\nI stopt: but both being still silent, the mother looking on the daughter,\nthe daughter glancing now and then her conscious eye on the mother, If,\nmadam, said I, you can give your hand to Lord W----, I will take care,\nthat settlements shall exceed your expectation. What I have observed as\nwell as heard of Miss Mansfield's temper and goodness, is the principal\nmotive of my application to her, in preference to all the women I know.\n\nBut permit me to say, that were your affections engaged to the lowest\nhonest man on earth, I would not wish for your favour to my Lord W----.\nAnd, further, if, madam, you think you should have but the shadow of a\nhope, to induce your compliance, that my Lord's death would be more\nagreeable to you than his life, then would I not, for your morality's\nsake, wish you to engage. In a word, I address myself to you, Miss\nMansfield, as to a woman of honour and conscience: if your conscience\nbids you doubt, reject the proposal; and this not only for my lord's\nsake, but for your own.\n\nConsider, if, without too great a force upon your inclinations, you can\nbehave with that condescension and indulgence to a man who has hastened\nadvanced age upon himself, which I have thought from your temper I might\nhope.\n\nI have said a great deal, because you, ladies, were silent; and because\nexplicitness in every case becomes the proposer. Give me leave to\nwithdraw for a few moments.\n\nI withdrew, accordingly, to the brothers and sister. I did not think I\nought to mention to them the proposal I had made: it might perhaps have\nengaged them all in its favour, as it was of such evident advantage to\nthe whole family; and that might have imposed a difficulty on the lady,\nthat neither for her own sake, nor my lord's, it would have been just to\nlay upon her.\n\nLady Mansfield came out to me, and said, I presume, sir, as we are a\nfamily which misfortune as well as love, has closely bound together, you\nwill allow it to be mentioned--\n\nTo the whole family, madam!--By all means. I wanted only first to know,\nwhether Miss Mansfield's affections were disengaged: and now you shall\ngive me leave to attend Miss Mansfield. I am a party for my Lord W----:\nMiss Mansfield is a party: your debates will be the more free in our\nabsence. If I find her averse, believe me, madam, I will not endeavour\nto persuade her. On the contrary, if she declare against accepting the\nproposal, I will be her advocate, though every one else should vote in\nits favour.\n\nThe brothers and sister looked upon one another: I left the mother to\npropose it to them; and stept into the inner parlour to Miss Mansfield.\n\nShe was sitting with her back to the door, in a meditating posture. She\nstarted at my entrance.\n\nI talked of indifferent subjects, in order to divert her from the\nimportant one, that had taken up her whole attention.\n\nIt would have been a degree of oppression to her to have entered with her\nupon a subject of so much consequence to her while we were alone; and\nwhen her not having given a negative, was to be taken as a modest\naffirmative.\n\nLady Mansfield soon joined us--My dear daughter, said she, we are all\nunanimous. We have agreed to leave every thing to Sir Charles Grandison:\nand we hope you will.\n\nShe was silent. I will only ask you, madam, said I, to her, if you have\nany wish to take time to consider of the matter? Do you think you shall\nbe easier in your mind, if you take time?--She was silent.\n\nI will not at this time, my good Miss Mansfield, urge you further. I\nwill make my report to Lord W----, and you shall be sure of his joyful\napprobation of the steps I have taken, before your final consent shall be\nasked for. But that I may not be employed in a doubtful cause, let me be\ncommissioned to tell my lord, that you are disengaged; and that you\nwholly resign yourself to your mother's advice.\n\nShe bowed her head.\n\nAnd that you, madam, to Lady Mansfield, are not averse to enter into\ntreaty upon this important subject.\n\nAverse, sir! said the mother, bowing, and gratefully smiling.\n\nI will write the particulars of our conversation to Lord W----, and my\nopinion of settlements, and advise him (if I am not forbid) to make a\nvisit at Mansfield House. [I stopt: they were both silent.] If\npossible, I will attend my lord in his first visit. I hope, madam, to\nMiss Mansfield, you will not dislike him; I am sure he will be charmed\nwith you: he is far from being disagreeable in his person: his temper is\nnot bad. Your goodness will make him good. I dare say that he will\nengage your gratitude; and I defy a good mind to separate love from\ngratitude.\n\nWe returned to company. I had all their blessings pronounced at once, as\nfrom one mouth. The melancholy brother was enlivened: who knows but the\nconsequence of this alliance may illuminate his mind? I could see by the\npleasure they all had, in beholding him capable of joy on the occasion,\nthat they hoped it would. The unhappy situation of the family affairs,\nas it broke the heart of the eldest brother, fixed a gloom on the temper\nof this gentleman.\n\nI was prevailed upon to dine with them. In the conversation we had at\nand after dinner, their minds opened, and their characters rose upon me.\nLord W---- will be charmed with Miss Mansfield. I am delighted to think,\nthat my mother's brother will be happy, in the latter part of his life,\nwith a wife of so much prudence and goodness, as I am sure this lady will\nmake him. On one instance of her very obliging behaviour to me, I\nwhispered her sister, Pray, Miss Fanny, tell Miss Mansfield, but not till\nI am gone, that she knows not the inconveniencies she is bringing upon\nherself: I may, perhaps, hereafter, have the boldness, to look for the\nsame favour from my aunt, that I meet with from Miss Mansfield.\n\nIf my sister, returned she, should ever misbehave to her benefactor, I\nwill deny my relation to her.\n\n\nYou will soon have another letter from me, with an account of the success\nof my visit to Sir Harry Beauchamp and his lady. We must have our\nBeauchamp among us, my dear friend: I should rather say, you must among\nyou; for I shall not be long in England. He will supply to you, my dear\nDr. Bartlett, the absence (it will not, I hope, be a long one) of your\n\nCHARLES GRANDISON.\n\n\nSir Charles, I remember, as the doctor read, mentions getting leave for\nhis Beauchamp to come over, who, he says, will supply his absence to him\n--But, ah, Lucy! Who, let me have the boldness to ask, shall supply it\nto your Harriet? Time, my dear, will do nothing for me, except I could\nhear something very much amiss of this man.\n\nI have a great suspicion, that the first part of the letter enclosed was\nabout me. The doctor looked so earnestly at me, when he skipt two sides\nof it; and, as I thought, with so much compassion!--To be sure, it was\nabout me.\n\nWhat would I give to know as much of his mind as Dr. Bartlett knows! If\nI thought he pitied the poor Harriet--I should scorn myself. I am, I\nwill be, above his pity, Lucy. In this believe your\n\nHARRIET BYRON.\n\n\n\nLETTER VII\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nSUNDAY NIGHT, APRIL 2.\n\n\nDr. Bartlett has received from Sir Charles an account of what passed last\nFriday between him and Sir Harry and Lady Beauchamp. By the doctor's\nallowance, I enclose it to you.\n\nIn this letter, Lucy, you will see him in a new light; and as a man whom\nthere is no resisting, when he resolves to carry a point. But it\nabsolutely convinces me, of what indeed I before suspected, that he has\nnot an high opinion of our sex in general: and this I will put down as a\nblot in his character. He treats us, in Lady Beauchamp, as perverse\nhumoursome babies, loving power, yet not knowing how to use it. See him\nso delicate in his behaviour and address to Miss Mansfield, and carry in\nyour thoughts his gaiety and adroit management to Lady Beauchamp, as in\nthis letter, and you will hardly think him the same man. Could he be\nany thing to me, I should be more than half afraid of him: yet this may\nbe said in his behalf;--He but accommodates himself to the persons he has\nto deal with:--He can be a man of gay wit, when he pleases to descend, as\nindeed his sister Charlotte has as often found, as she has given occasion\nfor the exercise of that talent in him:--Yet, that virtue, for its own\nsake, is his choice; since, had he been a free liver, he would have been\na dangerous man.\n\nBut I will not anticipate too much: read it here, if you please.\n\n\n\nLETTER VIII\n\nSIR CHARLES GRANDISON, TO DR. BARTLETT\n[ENCLOSED IN THE PRECEDING.]\nGRANDISON HALL, FRIDAY NIGHT, MARCH 31.\n\n\nI arrived at Sir Harry Beauchamp's about twelve this day. He and his\nlady expected me, from the letter which I wrote and shewed you before I\nleft the town; in which, you know, I acquainted Sir Harry with his son's\nearnest desire to throw himself at his feet, and to pay his duty to his\nmother, in England; and engaged to call myself, either this day or\nto-morrow, for an answer.\n\nSir Harry received me with great civility, and even affection. Lady\nBeauchamp, said he, will be with us in a moment. I am afraid you will\nnot meet with all the civility from her on the errand you are come upon,\nthat a man of Sir Charles Grandison's character deserves to meet with\nfrom all the world. We have been unhappy together, ever since we had\nyour letter. I long to see my son: your friendship for him establishes\nhim in my heart. But--And then he cursed the apron-string tenure, by\nwhich, he said, he held his peace.\n\nYou will allow me, Sir Harry, said I, to address myself in my own way to\nmy lady. You give me pleasure, in letting me know, that the difficulty\nis not with you. You have indeed, sir, one of the most prudent young men\nin the world for your son. His heart is in your hand: you may form it as\nyou please.\n\nShe is coming! She is coming! interrupted he. We are all in pieces: we\nwere in the midst of a feud, when you arrived. If she is not civil to\nyou--\n\nIn swam the lady; her complexion raised; displeasure in her looks to me,\nand indignation in her air to Sir Harry; as if they had not had their\ncontention out, and she was ready to renew it.\n\nWith as obliging an air as I could assume, I paid my compliments to her.\nShe received them with great stiffness; swelling at Sir Harry: who sidled\nto the door, in a moody and sullen manner, and then slipt out.\n\nYou are Sir Charles Grandison, I suppose, sir, said she; I never saw you\nbefore: I have heard much talk of you.--But, pray, sir, are good men\nalways officious men? Cannot they perform the obligations of friendship,\nwithout discomposing families?\n\nYou see me now, madam, in an evil moment, if you are displeased with me:\nbut I am not used to the displeasure of ladies: I do my utmost not to\ndeserve it; and, let me tell you, madam, that I will not suffer you to be\ndispleased with me.\n\nI took her half-reluctant hand, and led her to a chair, and seated myself\nin another near her.\n\nI see, sir, you have your arts.\n\nShe took the fire-screen, that hung by the side of the chimney, and held\nit before her face, now glancing at me, now turning away her eye, as if\nresolved to be displeased.\n\nYou come upon a hateful errand, sir: I have been unhappy ever since your\nofficious letter came.\n\nI am sorry for it, madam. While you are warm with the remembrance of a\npast misunderstanding, I will not offer to reason with you: but let me,\nmadam, see less discomposure in your looks. I want to take my\nimpressions of you from more placid features: I am a painter, madam: I\nlove to draw lady's pictures. Will you have this pass for a first\nsitting?\n\nShe knew not what to do with her anger: she was loath to part with it.\n\nYou are impertinent, Sir Charles--Excuse me--You are impertinent.\n\nI do excuse you, Lady Beauchamp: and the rather, as I am sure you do not\nthink me so. Your freedom is a mark of your favour; and I thank you for\nit.\n\nYou treat me as a child, sir--\n\nI treat all angry people as children: I love to humour them. Indeed,\nLady Beauchamp, you must not be angry with me. Can I be mistaken? Don't\nI see in your aspect the woman of sense and reason?--I never blame a lady\nfor her humoursomeness, so much as, in my mind, I blame her mother.\n\nSir! said she. I smiled. She bit her lip, to avoid returning a smile.\n\nHer character, my dear friend, is not, you know, that of an ill-tempered\nwoman, though haughty, and a lover of power.\n\nI have heard much of you, Sir Charles Grandison: but I am quite mistaken\nin you: I expected to see a grave formal young man, his prim mouth set in\nplaits: But you are a joker; and a free man; a very free man, I do assure\nyou.\n\nI would be thought decently free, madam; but not impertinent. I see with\npleasure a returning smile. O that ladies knew how much smiles become\ntheir features!--Very few causes can justify a woman's anger--Your sex,\nmadam, was given to delight, not to torment us.\n\nTorment you, sir!--Pray, has Sir Harry--\n\nSir Harry cannot look pleased, when his lady is dis-pleased: I saw that\nyou were, madam, the moment I beheld you. I hope I am not an unwelcome\nvisitor to Sir Harry for one hour, (I intend to stay no longer,) that he\nreceived me with so disturbed a countenance, and has now withdrawn\nhimself, as if to avoid me.\n\nTo tell you the truth, Sir Harry and I have had a dispute: but he always\nspeaks of Sir Charles Grandison with pleasure.\n\nIs he not offended with me, madam, for the contents of the letter--\n\nNo, sir, and I suppose you hardly think he is--But I am--\n\nDear madam, let me beg your interest in favour of the contents of it.\n\nShe took fire--rose up--\n\nI besought her patience--Why should you wish to keep abroad a young man,\nwho is a credit to his family, and who ought to be, if he is not, the joy\nof his father? Let him owe to your generosity, madam, that recall, which\nhe solicits: it will become your character: he cannot be always kept\nabroad: be it your own generous work--\n\nWhat, sir--Pray, sir--With an angry brow---\n\nYou must not be angry with me, madam--(I took her hand)--You can't be\nangry in earnest--\n\nSir Charles Grandison--You are--She withdrew her hand; You are, repeated\nshe--and seemed ready to call names--\n\nI am the Grandison you call me; and I honour the maternal character. You\nmust permit me to honour you, madam.\n\nI wonder, sir--\n\nI will not be denied. The world reports misunderstandings between you\nand Mr. Beauchamp. That busy world that will be meddling, knows your\npower, and his dependence. You must not let it charge you with an ill\nuse of that power: if you do, you will have its blame, when you might\nhave its praise: he will have its pity.\n\nWhat, sir, do you think your fine letters, and smooth words, will avail\nin favour of a young fellow who has treated me with disrespect?\n\nYou are misinformed, madam.--I am willing to have a greater dependence\nupon your justice, upon your good-nature, than upon any thing I can urge\neither by letter or speech. Don't let it be said, that you are not to be\nprevailed on--A woman not to be prevailed on to join in an act of\njustice, of kindness; for the honour of the sex, let it not be said.\n\nHonour of the sex, sir!--Fine talking!--Don't I know, that were I to\nconsent to his coming over, the first thing would be to have his annuity\naugmented out of my fortune? He and his father would be in a party\nagainst me. Am I not already a sufferer through him in his father's\nlove?--You don't know, sir, what has passed between Sir Harry and me\nwithin this half-hour--But don't talk to me: I won't hear of it: the\nyoung man hates me: I hate him; and ever will.\n\nShe made a motion to go.\n\nWith a respectful air, I told her, she must not leave me. My motive\ndeserved not, I said, that both she and Sir Harry should leave me in\ndispleasure.\n\nYou know but too well, resumed she, how acceptable your officiousness (I\nmust call it so) is to Sir Harry.\n\nAnd does Sir Harry, madam, favour his son's suit? You rejoice me: let\nnot Mr. Beauchamp know that he does: and do you, my dear Lady Beauchamp,\ntake the whole merit of it to yourself. How will he revere you for your\ngoodness to him! And what an obligation, if, as you say, Sir Harry is\ninclined to favour him, will you, by your generous first motion, lay upon\nSir Harry!\n\nObligation upon Sir Harry! Yes, Sir Charles Grandison, I have laid too\nmany obligations already upon him, for his gratitude.\n\nLay this one more. You own you have had a misunderstanding this morning:\nSir Harry is withdrawn, I suppose, with his heart full: let me, I beseech\nyou, make up the misunderstanding. I have been happy in this way--Thus\nwe will order it--We will desire him to walk in. I will beg your\ninterest with him in favour of the contents of the letter I sent. His\ncompliance will follow as an act of obligingness to you. The grace of\nthe action will be yours. I will be answerable for Mr. Beauchamp's\ngratitude.--Dear madam, hesitate not. The young gentleman must come over\none day: let the favour of its being an early one, be owing entirely to\nyou.\n\nYou are a strange man, sir: I don't like you at all: you would persuade\nme out of my reason.\n\nLet us, madam, as Mr. Beauchamp and I are already the dearest of friends,\nbegin a family understanding. Let St. James's-square, and\nBerkley-square, when you come to town, be a next-door neighbourhood.\nGive me the consideration of being the bondsman for the duty of Mr.\nBeauchamp to you, as well as to his father.\n\nShe was silent: but looked vexed and irresolute.\n\nMy sisters, madam, are amiable women. You will be pleased with them.\nLord L---- is a man worthy of Sir Harry's acquaintance. We shall want\nnothing, if you would think so, but Mr. Beauchamp's presence among us.\n\nWhat! I suppose you design your maiden sister for the young fellow--But\nif you do, sir, you must ask me for--There she stopt.\n\nIndeed I do not. He is not at present disposed to marry. He never will\nwithout his father's approbation, and let me say--yours. My sister is\naddressed to by Lord G----, and I hope will soon be married to him.\n\nAnd do you say so, Sir Charles Grandison?--Why then you are a more\ndisinterested man, than I thought you in this application to Sir Harry.\nI had no doubt but the young fellow was to be brought over to marry Miss\nGrandison; and that he was to be made worthy of her at my expense.\n\nShe enjoyed, as it seemed, by her manner of pronouncing the words young\nfellow, that designed contempt, which was a tacit confession of the\nconsequence he once was of to her.\n\nI do assure you, madam, that I know not his heart, if he has at present\nany thoughts of marriage.\n\nShe seemed pleased at this assurance.\n\nI repeated my wishes, that she would take to herself the merit of\nallowing Mr. Beauchamp to return to his native country: and that she\nwould let me see her hand in Sir Harry's, before I left them.\n\nAnd pray, sir, as to his place of residence, were he to come: do you\nthink he should live under the same roof with me?\n\nYou shall govern that point, madam, as you approve or disapprove of his\nbehaviour to you.\n\nHis behaviour to me, sir!--One house cannot, shall not, hold him and me.\n\nI think, madam, that you should direct in this article. I hope, after a\nlittle while, so to order my affairs, as constantly to reside in England.\nI should think myself very happy if I could prevail upon Mr. Beauchamp to\nlive with me.\n\nBut I must see him, I suppose?\n\nNot, madam, unless you shall think it right, for the sake of the world's\nopinion, that you should.\n\nI can't consent--\n\nYou can, madam! You do!--I cannot allow Lady Beauchamp to be one of\nthose women, who having insisted upon a wrong point, can be convinced,\nyet not know how to recede with a grace.--Be so kind to yourself, as to\nlet Sir Harry know, that you think it right for Mr. Beauchamp to return;\nbut that it must be upon your own conditions: then, madam, make those\nconditions generous ones; and how will Sir Harry adore you! How will Mr.\nBeauchamp revere you! How shall I esteem you!\n\nWhat a strange impertinent have I before me!\n\nI love to be called names by a lady. If undeservedly, she lays herself\nby them under obligation to me, which she cannot be generous if she\nresolves not to repay. Shall I endeavour to find out Sir Harry? Or will\nyou, madam?\n\nWas you ever, Sir Charles Grandison, denied by any woman to whom you sued\nfor favour?\n\nI think, madam, I hardly ever was: but it was because I never sued for a\nfavour, that it was not for a lady's honour to grant. This is the case\nnow; and this makes me determine, that I will not be denied the grant of\nmy present request. Come, come, madam! How can a woman of your\nladyship's good sense (taking her hand, and leading her to the door) seem\nto want to be persuaded to do a thing she knows in her heart to be right!\nLet us find Sir Harry.\n\nStrange man!--Unhand me--He has used me unkindly--\n\nOvercome him then by your generosity. But, dear Lady Beauchamp, taking\nboth her hands, and smiling confidently in her face, [I could, my dear\nDr. Bartlett, do so to Lady Beauchamp,] will you make me believe, that a\nwoman of your spirit (you have a charming spirit, Lady Beauchamp) did not\ngive Sir Harry as much reason to complain, as he gave you?--I am sure by\nhis disturbed countenance--\n\nNow, Sir Charles Grandison, you are downright affronting. Unhand me!\n\nThis misunderstanding is owing to my officious letter. I should have\nwaited on you in person. I should from the first have put it in your\npower, to do a graceful and obliging thing. I ask your pardon. I am not\nused to make differences between man and wife.\n\nI touched first one hand, then the other, of the perverse baby with my\nlips--Now am I forgiven: now is my friend Beauchamp permitted to return\nto his native country: now are Sir Harry and his Lady reconciled--Come,\ncome, madam, it must be so--What foolish things are the quarrels of\nmarried people!--They must come to an agreement again; and the sooner the\nbetter; before hard blows are struck, that will leave marks--Let us, dear\nmadam, find out Sir Harry--\n\nAnd then, with an air of vivacity, that women, whether in courtship or\nout of it, dislike not, I was leading her once more to the door, and, as\nI intended, to Sir Harry, wherever he could be found.\n\nHold, hold, sir! resisting; but with features far more placid than she\nhad suffered to be before visible--If I must be compelled--You are a\nstrange man, Sir Charles Grandison--If I must be compelled to see Sir\nHarry--But you are a strange man--And she rang the bell.\n\nLady Beauchamp, Dr. Bartlett, is one of those who would be more ready to\nforgive an innocent freedom, than to be gratified by a profound respect;\notherwise I had not treated her with so little ceremony. Such women are\nformidable only to those who are afraid of their anger, or who make it a\nserious thing.\n\nBut when the servant appeared, she not knowing how to condescend, I said,\nGo to your master, sir, and tell him that your lady requests the\nfavour--\n\nRequests the favour! repeated she; but in a low voice: which was no bad\nsign.\n\nThe servant went with a message worded with more civility than perhaps he\nwas used to carry to his master from his lady.\n\nNow, dear Lady Beauchamp, for your own sake; for Sir Harry's sake; make\nhappy; and be happy. Are there not, dear madam, unhappinesses enow in\nlife, that we must wilfully add to them?\n\nSir Harry came in sight. He stalked towards us with a parade like that\nof a young officer wanting to look martial at the head of his company.\n\nCould I have seen him before he entered, my work would have been easier.\nBut his hostile air disposed my lady to renew hostilities.\n\nShe turned her face aside, then her person; and the cloudy indignation\nwith which she entered at first, again overspread her features. Ought\nwrath, Dr. Bartlett, to be so ready to attend a female will?--Surely,\nthought I, my lady's present airs, after what has passed between her and\nme, can be only owing to the fear of making a precedent, and being\nthought too easily persuaded.\n\nSir Harry, said I, addressing myself to him, I have obtained Lady\nBeauchamp's pardon for the officious letter--\n\nPardon, Sir Charles Grandison! You are a good man, and it was kindly\nintended--\n\nHe was going on: anger from his eyes flashed upon his cheek-bones, and\nmade them shine. My lady's eyes struck fire at Sir Harry, and shewed\nthat she was not afraid of him.\n\nBetter intended, than done, interrupted I, since my lady tells me, that\nit was the occasion of a misunderstanding--But, sir, all will be right:\nmy lady assures me, that you are not disinclined to comply with the\ncontents; and she has the goodness--\n\nPray, Sir Charles, interrupted the lady--\n\nTo give me hopes that she--\n\nPray, Sir Charles--\n\nWill use her interest to confirm you in your favourable sentiments--\n\nSir Harry cleared up at once--May I hope, madam--And offered to take her\nhand.\n\nShe withdrew it with an air. O Dr. Bartlett, I must have been thought an\nunpolite husband, had she been my wife!\n\nI took her hand. Excuse this freedom, Sir Harry--For Heaven's sake,\nmadam, (whispering,) do what I know you will do, with a grace--Shall\nthere be a misunderstanding, and the husband court a refused hand?--I\nthen forced her half-unwilling hand into his, with an air that I intended\nshould have both freedom and respect in it.\n\nWhat a man have we got here, Sir Harry? This cannot be the modest man,\nthat you have praised to me--I thought a good man must of necessity be\nbashful, if not sheepish: and here your visitor is the boldest man in\nEngland.\n\nThe righteous, Lady Beauchamp, said Sir Harry, with an aspect but\nhalf-conceding, is bold as a lion.\n\nAnd must I be compelled thus, and by such a man, to forgive you, Sir\nHarry?--Indeed you were very unkind.\n\nAnd you, Lady Beauchamp, were very cruel.\n\nI did not think, sir, when I laid my fortune at your feet--\n\nO, Lady Beauchamp! You said cutting things! Very cutting things.\n\nAnd did not you, Sir Harry, say, it should be so?--So very peremptorily!\n\nNot, madam, till you, as peremptorily--\n\nA little recrimination, thought I, there must be, to keep each in\ncountenance on their past folly.\n\nAh, Sir Charles!--You may rejoice that you are not married, said Sir\nHarry.\n\nDear Sir Harry, said I, we must bear with ladies. They are meek good\ncreatures--They--\n\nMeek! Sir Charles, repeated Sir Harry, with a half-angry smile, and\nshrugging, as if his shoulder had been hurt with his wife's meekness--\nsay, meek!\n\nNow, Sir Charles Grandison, said my lady, with an air of threatening--\n\nI was desirous either of turning the lady's displeasure into a jest, or\nof diverting it from the first object, in order to make her play with it,\ntill she had lost it.\n\nWomen are of gentle natures, pursued I; and, being accustomed to be\nhumoured, opposition sits not easy upon them. Are they not kind to us,\nSir Harry, when they allow of our superiority, by expecting us to bear\nwith their pretty perversenesses?\n\nO, Sir Charles Grandison! said my lady; both her hands lifted up.\n\nLet us be contented, proceeded I, with such their kind acknowledgments,\nand in pity to them, and in compliment to ourselves, bear with their\nfoibles.--See, madam, I ever was an advocate for the ladies.\n\nSir Charles, I have no patience with you--\n\nWhat can a poor woman do, continued I, when opposed? She can only be a\nlittle violent in words, and, when she has said as much as she chooses to\nsay, be perhaps a little sullen. For my part, were I so happy as to call\na woman mine, and she happened to be in the wrong, I would endeavour to\nbe in the right, and trust to her good sense to recover her temper:\narguments only beget arguments.--Those reconciliations are the most\ndurable, in which the lady makes the advances.\n\nWhat doctrine is this, Sir Charles! You are not the man I took you for.\n--I believe, in my conscience, that you are not near so good a man, as\nthe world reports you.\n\nWhat, madam, because I pretend to know a little of the sex? Surely, Lady\nBeauchamp, a man of common penetration may see to the bottom of a woman's\nheart. A cunning woman cannot hide it. A good woman will not. You are\nnot, madam, such mysteries, as some of us think you. Whenever you know\nyour own minds, we need not be long doubtful: that is all the difficulty:\nand I will vindicate you, as to that--\n\nAs how, pray, sir?\n\nWomen, madam, were designed to be dependent, as well as gentle,\ncreatures; and, of consequence when left to their own wills, they know\nnot what to resolve upon.\n\nI was hoping, Sir Charles, just now, that you would stay to dinner: but\nif you talk at this rate, I believe I shall be ready to wish you out of\nthe house.\n\nSir Harry looked as if he were half-willing to be diverted at what passed\nbetween his lady and me. It was better for me to say what he could not\nbut subscribe to by his feeling, than for him to say it. Though reproof\nseldom amends a determined spirit, such a one as this lady's; yet a man\nwho suffers by it cannot but have some joy when he hears his sentiments\nspoken by a bystander. This freedom of mine seemed to save the married\npair a good deal of recrimination.\n\nYou remind me, madam, that I must be gone, rising and looking at my\nwatch.\n\nYou must not leave us, Sir Charles, said Sir Harry.\n\nI beg excuse, Sir Harry--Yours, also, madam, smiling--Lady Beauchamp must\nnot twice wish me out of the house.\n\nI will not excuse you, sir, replied she--If you have a desire to see the\nmatter completed--She stopt--You must stay to dinner, be that as it will.\n\n'Be that as it will,' madam!--You shall not recede.\n\nRecede! I have not yet complied--\n\nO these women! They are so used to courtship, that they know not how to\ndo right things without it--And, pardon me, madam, not always with it.\n\nBold man--Have I consented--\n\nHave you not, madam, given a lady's consent? That we men expect not to\nbe very explicit, very gracious.--It is from such non-negative consents,\nthat we men make silence answer all we wish.\n\nI leave Sir Charles Grandison to manage this point, said Sir Harry. In\nmy conscience, I think the common observation just: a stander-by sees\nmore of the game, than he that plays.\n\nIt ever will be so, Sir Harry--But I will tell you, my lady and I have as\ngood as agreed the matter--\n\nI have agreed to nothing, Sir Harry--\n\nHush, madam--I am doing you credit.--Lady Beauchamp speaks aside\nsometimes, Sir Harry: you are not to hear any thing she says, that you\ndon't like.\n\nThen I am afraid I must stop my ears for eight hours out of twelve.\n\nThat was aside, Lady Beauchamp--You are not to hear that.\n\nTo sit, like a fool, and hear myself abused--A pretty figure I make! Sir\nCharles Grandison, let me tell you, that you are the first man that ever\ntreated me like a fool.\n\nExcuse, madam, a little innocent raillery--I met you both, with a\ndiscomposure on your countenances. I was the occasion of it, by the\nletter I sent to Sir Harry. I will not leave you discomposed. I think\nyou a woman of sense; and my request is of such a nature, that the\ngranting of it will confirm to me, that you are so--But you have granted\nit--\n\nI have not.\n\nThat's charmingly said--My lady will not undervalue the compliment she is\ninclined to make you, Sir Harry. The moment you ask for her compliance,\nshe will not refuse to your affection, what she makes a difficulty to\ngrant to the entreaty of an almost stranger.\n\nLet it, let it be so! Lady Beauchamp, said Sir Harry: and he clasped his\narms about her as she sat--\n\nThere never was such a man as this Sir Charles Grandison in the world!--\nIt is a contrivance between you, Sir Harry--\n\nDear Lady Beauchamp, resumed I, depreciate not your compliment to Sir\nHarry. There wanted not contrivance, I dare to hope, (if there did, it\nhad it not,) to induce Lady Beauchamp to do a right, a kind, an obliging\nthing.\n\nLet me, my dearest Lady Beauchamp, said Sir Harry--Let me request--\n\nAt your request, Sir Harry--But not at Sir Charles's.\n\nThis is noble, said I. I thank you, madam, for the absent youth. Both\nhusband and son will think themselves favoured by you; and the more, as I\nam sure, that you will by the cheerful welcome, which you will give the\nyoung man, shew, that it is a sincere compliment that you have made to\nSir Harry.\n\nThis man has a strange way of flattering one into acts of--of--what shall\nI call them?--But, Sir Harry, Mr. Beauchamp must not, I believe, live\nwith us--\n\nSir Harry hesitated.\n\nI was afraid of opening the wound. I have a request to make to you both,\nsaid I. It is this; that Mr. Beauchamp may be permitted to live with me;\nand attend you, madam, and his father, as a visitor, at your own command.\nMy sister, I believe, will be very soon married to Lord G----.\n\nThat is to be certainly so, interrupted the lady?\n\nIt is, madam.\n\nBut what shall we say, my dear, resumed Sir Harry--Don't fly out again--\nAs to the provision for my son?--Two hundred a year--What is two hundred\na year----\n\nWhy then let it be three, answered she.\n\nI have a handsome and improvable estate, said I. I have no demands but\nthose of reason upon me. I would not offer a plea for his coming to\nEngland, (and I am sure he would not have come, if I had,) without his\nfather's consent: in which, madam, he hoped for yours. You shall not,\nsir, allow him either the two or three hundred a year. See him with\nlove, with indulgence (he will deserve both;) and think not of any thing\nelse for my Beauchamp.\n\nThere is no bearing this, my dear, said Sir Harry; leaning upon his\nlady's shoulder, as he sat, tears in his eyes--My son is already, as I\nhave heard, greatly obliged to this his true friend--Do you, do you,\nmadam, answer for me, and for yourself.\n\nShe was overcome: yet pride had its share with generosity. You are, said\nshe, the Grandison I have heard of: but I will not be under obligations\nto you--not pecuniary ones, however. No, Sir Harry! Recall your son: I\nwill trust to your love: do for him what you please: let him be\nindependent on this insolent man; [She said this with a smile, that made\nit obliging;] and if we are to be visitors, friends, neighbours, let it\nbe on an equal foot, and let him have nothing to reproach us with.\n\nI was agreeably surprised at this emanation (shall I call it?) of\ngoodness: she is really not a bad woman, but a perverse one; in short,\none of those whose passions, when rightly touched, are liable to sudden\nand surprising turns.\n\nGenerous, charming Lady Beauchamp! said I: now are you the woman, whom I\nhave so often heard praised for many good qualities: now will the\nportrait be a just one!\n\nSir Harry was in raptures; but had like to have spoiled all, by making me\na compliment on the force of example.\n\nBe this, said I, the result--Mr. Beauchamp comes over. He will be\npleased with whatever you do: at your feet, madam, he shall acknowledge\nyour favour: My home shall be his, if you permit it: On me, he shall\nconfer obligations; from you, he shall receive them. If any\nconsiderations of family prudence (there are such, and very just ones)\nrestrain you from allowing him, at present, what your generosity would\nwish to do--\n\nLady Beauchamp's colour was heightened: She interrupted me--We are not,\nSir Charles, so scanty in our fortune--\n\nWell, my dear Lady Beauchamp, be all that as you will: not one retrospect\nof the past--\n\nYes, Sir Charles, but there shall: his allowance has been lessened for\nsome years; not from considerations of family prudence--But--Well, 'tis\nall at an end, proceeded she--When the young man returns, you, Sir Harry,\nfor my sake, and for the sake of this strange unaccountable creature,\nshall pay him the whole arrear.\n\nNow, my dear Lady Beauchamp, said I, listing her hand to my lips, permit\nme to give you joy. All doubts and misgivings so triumphantly got over,\nso solid a foundation laid for family harmony--What was the moment of\nyour nuptials to this? Sir Harry, I congratulate you: you may, and I\nbelieve you have been, as happy as most men; but now, you will be still\nhappier.\n\nIndeed, Sir Harry, said she, you provoked me in the morning: I should not\nelse--\n\nSir Harry owned himself to blame; and thus the lady's pride was set down\nsoftly.\n\nShe desired Sir Harry to write, before the day concluded, the invitation\nof return, to Mr. Beauchamp; and to do her all the credit in it that she\nmight claim from the last part of the conversation; but not to mention\nany thing of the first.\n\nShe afterwards abated a little of this right spirit, by saying, I think,\nSir Harry, you need not mention any thing of the arrears, as I may call\nthem--But only the future 600\u00c2\u00a3. a year. One would surprise him a little,\nyou know, and be twice thanked--\n\nSurprises of such a nature as this, my dear Dr. Bartlett; pecuniary\nsurprises!--I don't love them--They are double taxes upon the gratitude\nof a worthy heart. Is it not enough for a generous mind to labour under\na sense of obligation?--Pride, vain-glory, must be the motive of such\nnarrow-minded benefactors: a truly beneficent spirit cannot take delight\nin beholding the quivering lip indicating the palpitating heart; in\nseeing the downcast countenance, the up-lifted hands, and working\nmuscles, of a fellow-creature, who, but for unfortunate accidents, would\nperhaps himself have had the will, with the power, of shewing a more\ngraceful benevolence!\n\nI was so much afraid of hearing farther abatements of Lady Beauchamp's\ngoodness; so willing to depart with favourable impressions of her for her\nown sake; and at the same time so desirous to reach the Hall that night;\nthat I got myself excused, though with difficulty, staying to dine; and\naccepting of a dish of chocolate, I parted with Sir Harry and my lady,\nboth in equal good humour with themselves and me.\n\nCould you have thought, my dear friend, that I should have succeeded so\nvery happily, as I have done, in this affair, and at one meeting?\n\nI think that the father and stepmother should have the full merit with\nour Beauchamp of a turn so unexpected. Let him not therefore ever see\nthis letter, that he may take his impression of the favour done him, from\nthat which Sir Harry will write to him.\n\nMy cousin Grandison, whom I hoped to find here, left the Hall on Tuesday\nlast, though he knew of my intention to be down. I am sorry for it.\nPoor Everard! He has been a great while pretty good. I am afraid he\nwill get among his old acquaintance; and then we shall not hear of him\nfor some months perhaps. If you see him in town, try to engage him, till\nI return. I should be glad of his company to Paris, if his going with\nme, will keep him out of harm's way, as it is called.\n\n\n***\n\n\nSATURDAY, APRIL 1.\n\nI have had compliments sent me by many of my neighbours, who had hoped I\nwas come to reside among them. They professed themselves disappointed on\nmy acquainting them, that I must go up early on Monday morning. I have\ninvited myself to their Saturday assembly at the Bowling-green-house.\n\nOur reverend friend Mr. Dobson has been so good as to leave with me the\nsermon he is to preach to-morrow on the opening of the church: it is a\nvery good discourse: I have only exceptions to three or four compliments\nhe makes to the patron in as many different places of it: I doubt not but\nhe will have the goodness to omit them.\n\nI have already looked into all that has been done in the church; and all\nthat is doing in the house and gardens. When both have had the direction\nand inspection of my dear Dr. Bartlett, need I say, that nothing could\nhave been better?\n\n\n***\n\n\nHalden is just arrived from my lord, with a letter, which has enabled me\nto write to Lady Mansfield his lordship's high approbation of all our\nproceedings; and that he intends some one early day in next week to pay\nto her, and Miss Mansfield, his personal compliments.\n\nHe has left to me the article of settlements; declaring, that his regard\nfor my future interest is all that he wishes may be attended to.\n\nI have therefore written, as from himself, that he proposes a jointure of\n1200\u00c2\u00a3. a year, penny-rents, and 300 guineas a year for her private purse;\nand that his lordship desires, that Miss Mansfield will make a present to\nher sister of whatever she may be entitled to in her own right.\nSomething was mentioned to me at Mansfield-house of a thousand pounds\nleft to her by a godmother.\n\nHalden being very desirous to see his future lady, I shall, at his\nrequest, send the letter I have written to Lady Mansfield by him early in\nthe morning; with a line recommending him to the notice of that lady as\nLord W----'s principal steward.\n\nAdieu, my dear Dr. Bartlett: I have joy in the joy of all these good\npeople. If Providence graciously makes me instrumental to it, I look\nupon myself but as its instrument. I hope ostentation has no share in\nwhat draws on me more thanks and praises than I love to hear.\n\nLord W---- has a right to be made happy by his next relation, if his next\nrelation can make him so. Is he not my mother's brother? Would not her\nenlarged soul have rejoiced on the occasion, and blessed her son for an\ninstance of duty to her, paid by his disinterested regard for her\nbrother? Who, my dear Dr. Bartlett, is so happy, yet who, in some cases,\nso unhappy, as your\n\nCHARLES GRANDISON.\n\n\n\nLETTER IX\n\nMISS BYRON, TO MISS SELBY\nMONDAY, APRIL 3.\n\n\nThe Countess of D----, and the earl, her son, have but just left us. The\ncountess sent last night, to let my cousin Reeves know of their intended\nmorning visit, and they came together. As the visit was made to my\ncousin, I did not think myself obliged to be in waiting for them below. I\nwas therefore in my closet, comforting myself with my own agreeable\nreflections. They were there a quarter of an hour before I was sent to.\n\nTheir talk was of me. I am used to recite my own praises, you know; and\nwhat signifies making a parade of apologies for continuing the use? I\ndon't value myself so much as I once did on peoples favourable opinions.\nIf I had a heart in my own keeping, I should be glad it was thought a\ngood one; that's all. Yet though it has littlenesses in it that I knew\nnothing of formerly, I hope it is not a bad one.\n\nMy Lord D----, by the whole turn of the partial conversation, was led to\nexpect a very extraordinary young woman. The lady declared, that she\nwould have her talk out, and hear all my two cousins were inclined to say\nof me, before I was sent up to, as I was not below when they came.\n\nI was therefore to be seen only as a subject of curiosity. My lord had\ndeclared, it seems, that he would not be denied an introduction to me by\nhis mother. But there were no thoughts of making any application to a\ngirl whose heart was acknowledged not to be her own. My lord's honour\nwould not allow of such an intention. Nor ought it.\n\nHis impatience, however, hastened the message to me. The countess met me\nhalf-way, and embraced me. My lovely girl, how do you?--My lord, said\nshe, turning to the earl, I need not say--This is Miss Byron.\n\nHe bowed low, and made me a very high compliment; but it had sense in it,\nthough high, and above my merits. Girls, writing of themselves on these\noccasions, must be disclaimers, you know: But, my dear uncle, what care I\nnow for compliments? The man, from whose mouth only they could be\nacceptable, is not at liberty to make me any.\n\nThe countess engaged me in an easy general conversation; part of which\nturned upon Lord and Lady L----, Miss Grandison, and Miss Jervois, and\nhow I had passed my time at Colnebrook, in this wintry season, when there\nwere so many diversions in town. But, said she, you had a man with you,\nwho is the admiration of every man and woman, wherever he goes.\n\nIs there no making an acquaintance, said my lord, with Sir Charles\nGrandison? What I hear said of him, every time he is mentioned in\ncompany, is enough to fire a young man with emulation. I should be happy\ndid I deserve to be thought of as a second or third man to Sir Charles\nGrandison.\n\nI dare say, returned I, your lordship's acquaintance would be highly\nacceptable to him. He is easy of access. Men of rank, if men of merit,\nmust be of kindred, and recognize one another the moment they meet. But\nSir Charles will soon leave England.\n\nThe fool sighed: it was, you may believe, involuntarily. I felt myself\nblush, and was the more silly for that.\n\nThe countess took my hand--One word with you, my dear--and led me out\ninto the next room, and sitting down, made me sit on the same settee with\nher.\n\nO that I could call you daughter! began she at once; and turning half\nround to me, put one arm about me, with her other hand taking one of\nmine, and earnestly looking in my downcast face.\n\nI was silent. Ah, Lucy! had Lady D---- been the mother of Sir Charles\nGrandison, with what pleasure could I have listened to her!\n\nYou said, my dear, that Sir Charles Grandison will soon leave England:\n--and then you sighed--Will you be quite open-hearted?--May I ask you a\nquestion in hope that you will?\n\nI was silent: yet the word Yes was on my lips.\n\nYou have caused it to be told me, that your affections are engaged. This\nhas been a cruel blow upon us. My lord, nevertheless, has heard so much\nof you, [he is really a good young man, my dear,] that (against my\nadvice, I own,) he would have me introduce him into your company. I see\nby his looks, that he could admire you above all women. He never was in\nlove: I should be sorry if he were disappointed in his first love. I\nhope his promised prudence will be his guard, if there be no prospect of\nhis succeeding with you--She paused--I was still silent--\n\nIt will be a mark of your frankness of heart, my dear, if, when you take\nmy full meaning, you prevent me speaking more than I need.--I would not\noppress you, my sweet love--Such a delicacy, and such a frankness\nmingled, have I never seen in young woman--But tell me, my dear, has Sir\nCharles Grandison made his addresses to you?\n\nIt was a grievous question for me to answer--But why was it so, my Lucy,\nwhen all the hopes I ever had, proceeded from my own presumption,\nconfirmed (that's true, of late!) by his sisters partiality in my favour;\nand when his unhappy Clementina has such a preferable claim?\n\nWhat says Miss Byron?\n\nShe says, madam, that she reveres Lady D----, and will answer any\nquestions that she puts to her, however affecting--Sir Charles Grandison\nhas not.\n\nOnce I thought, proceeded she, that I never would make a second motion,\nwere the woman a princess, who had confessed a prior love, or even\nliking: but the man is Sir Charles Grandison, whom all women must esteem;\nand the woman is Miss Byron, whom all men must love. Let me ask you, my\ndear--Have you any expectation, that the first of men (I will call him\nso) and the loveliest and most amiable-minded of women, can come\ntogether?--You sighed, you know, when you mentioned, that Sir Charles was\nsoon to leave England; and you own that he has not made addresses to you\n--Don't be uneasy, my love!--We women, in these tender cases, see into\neach other's hearts from small openings--Look upon me as your mother--\nWhat say you, love?\n\nYour ladyship compliments me with delicacy and frankness--It is too hard\na question, if I have any of the first, to answer without blushes. A\nyoung woman to be supposed to have an esteem for a man, who has made no\ndeclarations, and whose behaviour to her is such only as shews a\npoliteness to which he is accustomed, and only the same kind of\ntenderness as he shews to his sisters;--and whom sometimes he calls\nsister--as if--Ah, madam, how can one answer?\n\nYou have answered, my dear, and with that delicacy and frankness too,\nwhich make a principal part of your character. If my son (and he shall\nnot be encouraged in his hopes, if he sees you not, mind as well as\nperson, with his mother's eyes) should not be able to check himself by\nthe apprehensions he has had reason for, of being but a second man in the\nfavour of the object of his wishes [We, my dear, have our delicacies];\ncould you not allow him a second place in your favour, that might, in\ntime, as he should merit, and as you should subdue your prepossessions,\ngive him a first?--Hush--my dear, for one moment--Your honour, your\npiety, are my just dependence; and will be his.--And now speak: it is to\nme, my dear: speak your whole heart: let not any apprehended difficulty--\nI am a woman as well as you. And prepared to indulge--\n\nYour goodness, madam, and nothing else, interrupted I, gives me\ndifficulty.--My Lord D---- seems to me to be a man of merit, and not a\ndisagreeable man in his person and manners. What he said of Sir Charles\nGrandison, and of his emulation being fired by his example, gave him\nadditional merit with me. He must have a good mind. I wish him\nacquainted with Sir Charles, for his own sake, and for the sake of the\nworld, which might be benefited by his large power, so happily directed!\n--But as to myself, I should forfeit the character of frankness of heart,\nwhich your ladyship's goodness ascribes to me, if I did not declare, that\nalthough I cannot, and, I think ought not to entertain a hope with regard\nto Sir Charles Grandison, since there is a lady who deserved him by\nsevere sufferings before I knew him; yet is my heart so wholly attached,\nthat I cannot think it just to give the least encouragement to any other\nproposal.\n\nYou are an excellent young woman: but, my dear, if Sir Charles Grandison\nis engaged--your mind will, it must change. Few women marry their first\nloves. Your heart--\n\nO, madam! it is already a wedded heart: it is wedded to his merits; his\nmerits will be always the object of my esteem: I can never think of any\nother, as I ought to think of the man to whom I give my hand.\n\nLike merits, my dear, as person is not the principal motive, may produce\nlike attachments. My Lord D---- will be, in your hands, another Sir\nCharles Grandison.\n\nHow good you are, my dear Lady D----! But allow me to repeat, as the\nstrongest expression I can use, because I mean it to carry in it all the\nforce that can be given it, that my heart is already a wedded heart.\n\nYou have spoken with great force: God bless you, my dear, as I love you!\nThe matter shall take its course. If my lord should happen to be a\nsingle man some time hence (and, I can tell you, that your excellencies\nwill make our choice difficult): and if your mind, from any accident, or\nfrom persuasion of friends, should then have received alteration; you may\nstill be happy in each other. I will therefore only thank you for that\nopenness of heart, which must set free the heart of my son--Had you had\nthe least lurking inclination to coquetry, and could have taken pride in\nconquests, he might have been an undone man.--We will return to the\ncompany--But spare him, my dear: you must not talk much. He will love\nyou, if you do, too fervently for his own peace. Try to be a little\nawkward--I am afraid for him: indeed I am. O that you had never seen Sir\nCharles Grandison!\n\nI could not answer one word. She took my hand; and led me into the\ncompany.\n\nHad I been silent, when my lord directed his discourse to me, or answered\nonly No, or Yes, the Countess would have thought me very vain; and that\nI ascribed to myself the consequence she so generously gave me, with\nrespect to my lord. I therefore behaved and answered unaffectedly; but\navoided such a promptness of speech, as would have looked like making\npretensions to knowledge and opinion, though some of my lord's questions\nwere apparently designed to engage me into freedom of discourse. The\ncountess observed me narrowly. She whispered to me, that she did; and\nmade me a very high compliment on my behaviour. How much, Lucy, do I\nlove and reverence her!\n\nMy lord was spoken too slightly of, by Miss Grandison, in a former\nconversation. He is really a fine gentleman. Any woman who is not\nengaged in her affections, may think herself very happy with him. His\nconversation was easy and polite, and he said nothing that was low or\ntrifling. Indeed, Lucy, I think Mr. Greville and Mr. Fenwick are as\ngreatly inferior to Lord D----, as Lord D---- is to Sir Charles\nGrandison.\n\nAt parting, he requested of me, to be allowed to repeat his visits.\n\nMy lord, said the countess, before I could answer, you must not expect a\nmere stiff maiden answer from Miss Byron: she is above all vulgar forms.\nShe and her cousins have too much politeness, and, I will venture to say,\ndiscernment, not to be glad of your acquaintance, as an acquaintance--\nBut, for the rest, you must look to your heart.\n\nI shall be afraid, said he, turning to the countess, to ask your ladyship\nfor an explanation. Miss Byron, I hope, sir, addressing himself to Mr.\nReeves, will not refuse me her company, when I pay you my compliments.\nThen turning to me, I hope, madam, I shall not be punished for admiring\nyou.\n\nMy Lord D----, replied I, will be entitled to every civility. I had said\nmore, had he not snatched my hand a little too eagerly, and kissed it.\n\nAnd thus much for the visit of the Countess of D---- and the earl.\n\n\n***\n\n\nDid I tell you in my former letter, that Emily is with me half her time?\nShe is a most engaging young creature. Her manners are so pure! Her\nheart is so sincere and open!--O, Lucy! you would dearly love her. I\nwish I may be asked to carry her down with me. Yet she adores her\nguardian: but her reverence for him will not allow of the innocent\nfamiliarity in thinking of him, that--I don't know what I would say. But\nto love with an ardor, that would be dangerous to one's peace, one must\nhave more tenderness than reverence for the object: Don't you think so,\nLucy?\n\nMiss Grandison made me one of her flying visits, as she calls them, soon\nafter the countess and my lord went away.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Reeves told her all that had been said before them by the\nearl and countess, as well before I went down to them, as after. They\ncould not tell her what passed between that lady and me, when she took me\naside. I had not had time to tell them. They referred to me for that:\nbut besides that I was not in spirits, and cared not to say much, I was\nnot willing to be thought by my refusal of so great an offer, to seem to\nfasten myself upon her brother.\n\nShe pitied (who but must?) Lady Clementina. She pitied her brother also:\nand, seeing me dejected, she clasped her arms about me, and wet my cheek\nwith a sisterly tear.\n\nIs it not very strange, Lucy, that his father should keep him so long\nabroad? These free-living men! of what absurdities are they not guilty!\nWhat misfortunes to others do they not occasion? One might, with the\nexcellent Clementina, ask, What had Mr. Grandison to do in Italy! Or\nwhy, if he must go abroad, did he stay so long?\n\nTravelling! Young men travelling! I cannot, my dear, but think it a\nvery nonsensical thing! What can they see, but the ruins of the gay,\nonce busy world, of which they have read?\n\nTo see a parcel of giddy boys under the direction of tutors or governors\nhunting after--What?--Nothing: or, at best, but ruins of ruins; for the\nimagination, aided by reflection, must be left, after all, to make out\nthe greater glories, which the grave-digger Time has buried too deep for\ndiscovery.\n\nAnd when this grand tour is completed, the travelled youth returns: And,\nwhat is his boast? Why to be able to tell, perhaps his better taught\nfriend, who has never been out of his native country, that he has seen in\nruins, what the other has a juster idea of from reading; and of which, it\nis more than probable, he can give a much better account than the\ntraveller.\n\nAnd are these, petulant Harriet, (methinks, Lucy, you demand,) all the\nbenefits that you will suppose Sir Charles Grandison has reaped from his\ntravelling?\n\nWhy, no. But then, in turn, I ask, Is every traveller a Sir Charles\nGrandison?--And does not even he confess to Dr. Bartlett, that he wished\nhe had never seen Italy? And may not the poor Clementina, and all her\nfamily, for her sake, wish he never had?\n\nIf an opportunity offers, I don't know, but I may ask Sir Charles,\nwhether, in his conscience, he thinks, that, taking in every\nconsideration, relating to time, expense, risques of life, health,\nmorals, this part of the fashionable education of youth of condition is\nsuch an indispensable one, as some seem to suppose it? If Sir Charles\nGrandison give it not in favour of travelling, I believe it will be\nconcluded, that six parts out of eight of the little masters who are sent\nabroad for improvement, might as well be kept at home; if, especially,\nthey would be orderly, and let their fathers and mothers know what to do\nwith them.\n\nO, my uncle! I am afraid of you: but spare the poor girl: she\nacknowledges her petulance, her presumption. The occasion you know, and\nwill pity her for it! However, neither petulance nor presumption shall\nmake her declare as her sentiments what really are not so, in her\nunprejudiced hours; and she hopes to have her heart always open to\nconviction.\n\nFor the present, Adieu, my Lucy.\n\n\nP.S. Dr. Bartlett tells me, that Mr. Beauchamp is at Calais, waiting the\npleasure of his father; and that Sir Harry has sent express for him, as\nat his lady's motion.\n\n\n\nLETTER X\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nTUESDAY, APRIL 4.\n\n\nSir Charles Grandison came to town last night. He was so polite as to\nsend to inquire after my health; and to let Mr. Reeves know, that he\nwould do himself the honour, as he called it, of breakfasting with him\nthis morning. Very ceremonious either for his own sake or for mine--\nPerhaps for both.\n\nSo I am in expectation of seeing within this half-hour, the noble\nClementina's future--Ah Lucy!\n\nThe compliment, you see, is to Mr. Reeves--Shall I stay above, and see if\nhe will ask for me? He owes me something for the emotion he gave me in\nLord L----'s library. Very little of him since have I seen.\n\n'Honour forbids me,' said he, then: 'Yet honour bids me.--But I cannot be\nungenerous, selfish.'--These words are still in my ear.--What could he\nmean by them?--Honour forbids me--What! to explain himself? He had been\ntelling me a tender tale: he had ended it. What did honour forbid him to\ndo?--Yet honour bids me! Why then did he not follow the dictates of\nhonour?\n\nBut I cannot be unjust:--To Clementina he means. Who wished him to be\nso?--Unjust! I hope not. It is a diminution to your glory, Sir Charles\nGrandison, to have the word unjust, in this way of speaking, in your\nthoughts! As if a good man had lain under a temptation to be unjust; and\nhad but just recollected himself.\n\n'I cannot be ungenerous.' To the noble lady, I suppose? He must take\ncompassion on her. And did he think himself under an obligation to my\nforwardness to make this declaration to me, as to one who wished him to\nbe ungenerous to such a lady for my sake!--I cannot bear the thought of\nthis. Is it not as if he had said, 'Fond Harriet, I see what you expect\nfrom me--But I must have compassion for, I cannot be ungenerous to,\nClementina!'--But, what a poor word is compassion! Noble Clementina! I\ngrieve for you, though the man be indeed a generous man!--O defend me, my\nbetter genius, from wanting the compassion even of a Sir Charles\nGrandison!\n\nBut what means he by the word selfish! He cannot be selfish!--I\ncomprehend not the meaning of this word--Clementina has a very high\nfortune--Harriet but a very middling one. He cannot be unjust,\nungenerous to Clementina--Nor yet selfish--This word confounds me, from a\nman that says nothing at random!\n\nWell, but breakfast-time is come, while I am busy in self-debatings. I\nwill go down, that I may not seem to affect parade. I will endeavour to\nsee with indifference, him that we have all been admiring and studying\nfor this last fortnight, in such a variety of lights. The christian: the\nhero: the friend:--Ah, Lucy! the lover of Clementina: the generous\nkinsman of Lord W----: the modest and delicate benefactor of the\nMansfields: the free, gay, raillier of Lady Beauchamp; and, in her, of\nall our sex's foibles!\n\nBut he is come! While I am prating to you with my pen, he is come--Why,\nLucy, would you detain me?--Now must the fool go down in a kind of hurry:\nYet stay till she is sent for.--And that is now.\n\n\n\nLETTER XI\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\n\n\nO Lucy, I have such a conversation to relate to you!--But let me lead to\nit.\n\nSir Charles met me at the opening of the door. He was all himself. Such\nan unaffected modesty and politeness; yet such an ease and freedom!\n\nI thought, by his address, that he would have taken my hand; and both\nhands were so emulatively passive--How does he manage it to be so free in\na first address, yet so respectful, that a princess could not blame him!\n\nAfter breakfast, my cousins being sent for out to attend Sir John\nAllestree and his Niece, Sir Charles and I were left alone: and then,\nwith an air equally solemn and free, he addressed himself to me.\n\nThe last time I had the honour of being alone with my good Miss Byron, I\ntold her a very tender tale. I was sure it would raise in such a heart\nas hers generous compassion for the noblest lady on the continent; and I\npresumed, as my difficulties were not owing either to rashness or\nindiscretion, that she would also pity the relater.\n\nThe story did indeed affect you; yet, for my own sake, as well as yours,\nI referred you to Dr. Bartlett, for the particulars of some parts of it,\nupon which I could not expatiate.\n\nThe doctor, madam, has let me know the particulars which he communicated\nto you. I remember with pain the pain I gave to your generous heart in\nLord L----'s study. I am sure you must have suffered still more from the\nsame compassionate goodness on the communications he made you. May I,\nmadam, however, add a few particulars to the same subject, which he then\ncould not give you? Now you have been let into so considerable a part of\nmy story, I am desirous to acquaint you, and that rather than any woman\nin the world, with all that I know myself of this arduous affair.\n\nHe ceased speaking. I was in tremors. Sir, sir--The story, I must own,\nis a most affecting one. How much is the unhappy lady to be pitied! You\nwill do me honour in acquainting me with further particulars of it.\n\nDr. Bartlett has told you, madam, that the Bishop of Nocera, second\nbrother to Lady Clementina, has very lately written to me, requesting\nthat I will make one more visit to Bologna--I have the letter. You read\nItalian, madam. Shall I--Or will you--He held it to me.\n\nI took it. These, Lucy, are the contents.\n\n'The bishop acquaints him with the very melancholy way they are in. The\nfather and mother declining in their healths. Signor Jeronymo worse than\nwhen Sir Charles left them. His sister also declining in her health: yet\nearnest still to see him.\n\n'He says, that she is at present at Urbino; but is soon to go to Naples\nto the general's. He urges him to make them one visit more; yet owns,\nthat his family are not unanimous in the request: but that he and Father\nMarescotti, and the marchioness, are extremely earnest that this\nindulgence should be granted to the wishes of his dear sister.\n\n'He offers to meet him, at his own appointment, and conduct him to\nBologna; where, he tells him, his presence will rejoice every heart, and\nprocure an unanimous consent to the interview so much desired: and says,\nthat if this measure, which he is sorry he has so long withstood, answers\nnot his hopes, he will advise the shutting up of their Clementina in a\nnunnery, or to consign her to private hands, where she shall be treated\nkindly, but as persons in her unhappy circumstances are accustomed to be\ntreated.'\n\nSir Charles then shewed me a letter from Signor Jeronymo; in which he\nacquaints him with the dangerous way he is in. He tells him, 'That his\nlife is a burden to him. He wishes it was brought to its period. He\ndoes not think himself in skilful hands. He complains most of the wound\nwhich is in his hip-joint; and which has hitherto baffled the art both of\nthe Italian and French surgeons who have been consulted. He wishes, that\nhimself and Sir Charles had been of one country, he says, since the\ngreatest felicity he now has to wish for, is to yield up his life to the\nGiver of it, in the arms of his Grandison.'\n\nHe mentions not one word in this melancholy letter of his unhappy sister:\nwhich Sir Charles accounted for, by supposing, that she not being at\nBologna, they kept from him, in his deplorable way, everything relating\nto her, that was likely to disturb him. He then read part of a letter\nwritten in English, by the admired Mrs. Beaumont; some of the contents\nof which were, as you shall hear, extremely affecting.\n\n'Mrs. Beaumont gives him in it an account of the situation of the unhappy\nyoung lady; and excuses herself for not having done it before, in answer\nto his request, by reason of an indisposition under which she had for\nsome time laboured, which had hindered her from making the necessary\ninquiries.\n\n'She mentions, that the lady had received no benefit from her journeyings\nfrom place to place; and from her voyage from Leghorn to Naples, and back\nagain; and blames her attendants, who, to quiet her, unknown to their\nprincipals, for some time, kept her in expectation of seeing her\nChevalier, at the end of each; for her more prudent Camilla, she says,\nhad been hindered by illness from attending her, in several of the\nexcursions.\n\n'They had a second time, at her own request, put her into a nunnery. She\nat first was so sedate in it as gave them hopes: but the novelty going\noff, and one of the sisters, to try her, having officiously asked her to\ngo with her into the parlour, where she said, she would be allowed to\nconverse through the grate with a certain English gentleman, her\nimpatience, on her disappointment, made her more ungovernable than they\nhad ever known her; for she had been for two hours before meditating what\nshe would say to him.\n\n'For a week together, she was vehemently intent upon being allowed to\nvisit England; and had engaged her cousins, Sebastiano and Juliano, to\npromise to escort her thither, if she could obtain leave.\n\n'Her mother brought her off this when nobody else could, only by\nentreating her, for her sake, never to think of it more.\n\n'The marchioness then, encouraged by this instance of her obedience, took\nher under her own care: but the young lady going on from flight to\nslight; and the way she was in visibly affecting the health of her\nindulgent mother; a doctor was found, who was absolutely of opinion, that\nnothing but harsh methods would avail: and in this advice Lady Sforza,\nand her daughter Laurana, and the general, concurring, she was told, that\nshe must prepare to go to Milan. She was so earnest to be excused from\ngoing thither, and to be permitted to go to Florence to Mrs. Beaumont,\nthat they gave way to her entreaties; and the marquis himself,\naccompanying her to Florence, prevailed on Mrs. Beaumont to take her\nunder her care.\n\n'With her she staid three weeks: she was tolerably sedate in that space\nof time; but most so, when she was talking of England, and of the\nChevalier Grandison, and his sisters, with whom she wished to be\nacquainted. She delighted to speak English, and to talk of the\ntenderness and goodness of her tutor; and of what he said to her, upon\nsuch and such a subject.\n\n'At the three weeks end, the general made her a visit, in company of Lady\nSforza; and her talk being all on this subject, they were both highly\ndispleased; and hinted, that she was too much indulged in it; and,\nunhappily, she repeating some tender passages that passed in the\ninterview her mother had permitted her to hold with the Chevalier, the\ngeneral would have it, that Mr. Grandison had designedly, from the first,\nsought to give himself consequence with her; and expressed himself, on\nthe occasion, with great violence against him.\n\n'He carried his displeasure to extremity, and obliged her to go away with\nhis aunt and him that very day, to her great regret; and as much to the\nregret of Mrs. Beaumont, and of the ladies her friends; who tenderly\nloved the innocent visionary, as sometimes they called her. And Mrs.\nBeaumont is sure, that the gentle treatment she met with from them, would\nin time, though perhaps slowly, have greatly helped her.'\n\nMrs. Beaumont then gives an account of the harsh treatment the poor young\nlady met with.\n\nSir Charles Grandison would have stopt reading here. He said, he could\nnot read it to me, without such a change of voice, as would add to my\npain, as well as to his own.\n\nTears often stole down my cheeks, when I read the letters of the bishop\nand Signor Jeronymo, and as Sir Charles read a part of Mrs. Beaumont's\nletter: and I doubted not but what was to follow would make them flow.\nYet, I said, Be pleased, sir, to let me read on. I am not a stranger to\ndistress. I can pity others, or I should not deserve pity myself.\n\nHe pointed to the place; and withdrew to the window.\n\nMrs. Beaumont says, 'That the poor mother was prevailed upon to resign\nher child wholly to the management of Lady Sforza, and her daughter\nLaurana, who took her with them to their palace in Milan.\n\n'The tender parent, however, besought them to spare all unnecessary\nseverity; which they promised: but Laurana objected to Camilla's\nattendance. She was thought too indulgent; and her servant Laura, as a\nmore manageable person, was taken in her place.' And O how cruelly, as\nyou shall hear, did they treat her!\n\nFather Marescotti, being obliged to visit a dying relation at Milan, was\ndesired by the marchioness to inform himself of the way her beloved\ndaughter was in, and of the methods taken with her, Lady Laurana having,\nin her letters, boasted of both. The good Father acquainted Mrs.\nBeaumont with the following particulars:\n\n'He was surprised to find a difficulty made of his seeing the lady: but,\ninsisting on it, he found her to be wholly spiritless, and in terror;\nafraid to speak, afraid to look, before her cousin Laurana; yet seeming\nto want to complain to him. He took notice of this to Laurana--O Father,\nsaid she, we are in the right way, I assure you: when we had her first,\nher chevalier, and an interview with him, were ever in her mouth; but now\nshe is in such order, that she never speaks a word of him. But what,\nasked the compassionate Father, must she have suffered, to be brought to\nthis?--Don't you, Father, trouble yourself about that, replied the cruel\nLaurana: the doctors have given their opinion, that some severity was\nnecessary. It is all for her good.\n\n'The poor lady expressed herself to him, with earnestness, after the\nveil; a subject on which, it seems, they indulged her; urging, that the\nonly way to secure her health of mind, if it could be restored, was to\nyield to her wishes. Lady Sforza said, that it was not a point that she\nherself would press; but it was her opinion, that her family sinned in\nopposing a divine dedication; and, perhaps, their daughter's malady might\nbe a judgment upon them for it.'\n\nThe father, in his letter to Mrs. Beaumont, ascribes to Lady Sforza\nself-interested motives for her conduct; to Laurana, envy, on account of\nLady Clementina's superior qualities: but nobody, he says, till now,\ndoubted Laurana's love of her.'\n\nFather Marescotti then gives a shocking instance of the barbarous\nLaurana's treatment of the noble sufferer--All for her good--Wretch! how\nmy heart rises against her! Her servant Laura, under pretence of\nconfessing to her Bologna father, in tears, acquainted him with it. It\nwas perpetrated but the day before.\n\n'When any severity was to be exercised upon the unhappy lady, Laura was\nalways shut out of her apartment. Her lady had said something that she\nwas to be chidden for. Lady Sforza, who was not altogether so severe as\nher daughter, was not at home. Laura listened in tears: she heard\nLaurana in great wrath with Lady Clementina, and threaten her--and her\nyoung lady break out to this effect--What have I done to you, Laurana, to\nbe so used?--You are not the cousin Laurana you used to be! You know I\nam not able to help myself: why do you call me crazy, and frantic,\nLaurana? [Vile upbraider, Lucy!] If the Almighty has laid his hand upon\nme, should I not be pitied?--\n\n'It is all for your good! It is all for your good, Clementina! You\ncould not always have spoken so sensibly, cousin.\n\n'Cruel Laurana! You loved me once! I have no mother, as you have. My\nmother was a good mother: but she is gone! Or I am gone, I know not\nwhich!\n\n'She threatened her then with the strait waistcoat, a punishment which\nthe unhappy lady was always greatly terrified at. Laura heard her beg\nand pray; but, Laurana coming out, she was forced to retire.\n\n'The poor young lady apprehending her cruel cousin's return with the\nthreatened waistcoat, and with the woman that used to be brought in when\nthey were disposed to terrify her, went down and hid herself under a\nstair-case, where she was soon discovered by her clothes, which she had\nnot been careful to draw in after her.'\n\nO, Lucy! how I wept! How insupportable to me, said Sir Charles, would\nhave been my reflections, had my conscience told me, that I had been the\nwilful cause of the noble Clementina's calamity!\n\nAfter I had a little recovered, I read to myself the next paragraph,\nwhich related, 'that the cruel Laurana dragged the sweet sufferer by her\ngown, from her hiding-place, inveighing against her, threatening her:\nshe, all patient, resigned, her hands crossed on her bosom, praying for\nercy, not by speech, but by her eyes, which, however, wept not: and\ncausing her to be carried up to her chamber, there punished her with the\nstrait waistcoat, as she had threatened.\n\n'Father Marescotti was greatly affected with Laura's relation, as well as\nwith what he had himself observed: but on his return to Bologna, dreading\nto acquaint her mother, for her own sake, with the treatment her\nClementina met with, he only said, he did not quite approve of it, and\nadvised her not to oppose the young lady's being brought home, if the\nbishop and the general came into it: but he laid the whole matter before\nthe bishop, who wrote to the general to join with him out of hand, to\nrelease their sister from her present bondage: and the general meeting\nthe bishop on a set day at Milan, for that purpose, the lady was\naccordingly released.\n\n'A breach ensued upon it, with Lady Sforza and her daughter; who would\nhave it, that Clementina was much better for their management. They had\nby terror broke her spirit, and her passiveness was reckoned upon as an\nindication of amendment.\n\n'The marchioness being much indisposed, the young lady, attended by her\nCamilla, was carried to Naples; where it is supposed she now is. Poor\nyoung lady, how has she been hurried about!--But who can think of her\ncousin Laurana without extreme indignation?\n\n'Mrs. Beaumont writes, that the bishop would fain have prevailed upon his\nbrother, the general, to join with him in an invitation to Sir Charles\nGrandison to come over, as a last expedient, before they locked her up\neither in a nunnery, or in some private house: but the general would by\nno means come into it.\n\n'He asked, What was proposed to be the end of Sir Charles's visit, were\nall that was wished from it to follow, in his sister's restored mind?--He\nnever, he said, would give his consent that she should be the wife of an\nEnglish Protestant.\n\n'The bishop declared, that he was far from wishing her to be so: but he\nwas for leaving that to after-consideration. Could they but restore his\nsister to her reason, that reason, co-operating with her principles,\nmight answer all their hopes.\n\n'He might try his expedient, the general said, with all his heart: but he\nlooked upon the Chevalier Grandison to be a man of art; and he was sure\nhe must have entangled his sister by methods imperceptible to her, and to\nthem; but yet more efficacious to his ends, than an open declaration.\nHad he not, he asked, found means to fascinate Olivia, and as many women\nas he came into company with?--For his part, he loved not the Chevalier.\nHe had forced him by his intrepidity to be civil to him: but forced\ncivility was but a temporary one. It was his way to judge of causes by\nthe effects: and this he knew, that he had lost a sister, who would have\nbeen a jewel in the crown of a prince; and would not be answerable for\nconsequences, if he and Sir Charles Grandison were once more to meet, be\nit where it would.\n\n'Father Marescotti, however, joining, as the bishop writes, with him, and\nthe marchioness, in a desire to try this expedient; and being sure that\nthe marquis and Signor Jeronymo would not be averse to it, he took a\nresolution to write over to him, as has been related.'\n\nThis, Lucy, is the state of the unhappy case, as briefly and as clearly\nas my memory will serve to give it. And what a rememberer, if I may make\na word, is the heart!--Not a circumstance escapes it.\n\nAnd now it remained for me to know of Sir Charles what answer he had\nreturned.\n\nWas not my situation critical, my dear? Had Sir Charles asked my\nopinion, before he had taken his resolutions, I should have given it with\nmy whole heart, that he should fly to the comfort of the poor lady. But\nthen he would have shewn a suspense unworthy of Clementina; and a\ncompliment to me; which a good man, so circumstanced, ought not to make.\n\nMy regard for him (yet what a poor affected word is regard!) was,\nnevertheless, as strong as ever. Generosity, or rather justice, to\nClementina, and that so often avowed regard to him, pulled my heart two\nways.--I wanted to consider with myself for a few moments: I was desirous\nto clear the conduct that I was to shew on this trying occasion, as well\nof precipitance as of affectation; and my cousin Reeves just then coming\nin for something she wanted, I took the opportunity to walk to the other\nend of the room; and while a short complimental discourse passed between\nthem, 'Harriet Byron,' said I to myself, 'be not mean. Hast thou not the\nexample of a Clementina before thee? Her religion and her love,\ncombating together, have overturned the noble creature's reason. Tho\ncanst not be called to such a trial: but canst thou not shew, that if\nthou wert, thou couldst have acted greatly, if not so greatly?--Sir\nCharles Grandison is just: he ought to prefer to thee the excellent\nClementina. Priority of claim, compassion for the noble sufferer, merits\nso superior!--I love him for his merits: shall I not love merits, nearly\nas great, in one of my own sex? The struggle will cost thee something:\nbut go down, and try to be above thyself. Banished to thy retirement, to\nthy pillow, thought I, be all the girl. Often have I contended for the\ndignity of my sex; let me now be an example to myself, and not unworthy\nin my own eyes (when I come to reflect) of an union, could it have been\neffected, with a man whom a Clementina looked up to with hope.'\n\nMy cousin being withdrawn, and Sir Charles approaching me, I attempted to\nassume a dignity of aspect, without pride; and I spoke, while spirit was\nhigh in me, and to keep myself up to it--My heart bleeds, sir, for the\ndistresses of your Clementina: [Yes, Lucy, I said your Clementina:]\nbeyond expression I admire the greatness of her behaviour; and most\nsincerely lament her distresses. What, that is in the power of man,\ncannot Sir Charles Grandison do? You have honoured me, sir, with the\ntitle of sister. In the tenderness of that relation, permit me to say,\nthat I dread the effects of the general's petulance: I feel next for you\nthe pain that it must give to your humane heart to be once more\npersonally present to the woes of the inimitable Clementina: but I am\nsure you did not hesitate a moment about leaving all your friends here in\nEngland, and resolving to hasten over to try, at least, what can be done\nfor the noble sufferer.\n\nHad he praised me highly for this my address to him, it would have\nlooked, such was the situation on both sides, as if he had thought this\ndisinterested behaviour in me, an extraordinary piece of magnanimity and\nself-denial; and, of consequence, as if he had supposed I had views upon\nhim, which he wondered I could give up. His is the most delicate of\nhuman minds.\n\nHe led me to my seat, and taking his by me, still holding my passive\nhand--Ever since I have had the honour of Miss Byron's acquaintance, I\nhave considered her as one of the most excellent of women. My heart\ndemands alliance with hers, and hopes to be allowed its claim; though\nsuch are the delicacies of situation, that I scarcely dare to trust\nmyself to speak upon the subject. From the first, I called Miss Byron my\nsister; but she is more to me than the dearest sister; and there is a\nmore tender friendship that I aspire to hold with her, whatever may be\nthe accidents, on either side, to bar a further wish: and this I must\nhope, that she will not deny me, so long as it shall be consistent with\nher other attachments.\n\nHe paused. I made an effort to speak: but speech was denied me. My\nface, as I felt, glowed like the fire before me.\n\nMy heart, resumed he, is ever on my lips. It is tortured when I cannot\nspeak all that is in it. Professions I am not accustomed to make. As I\nam not conscious of being unworthy of your friendship, I will suppose it;\nand further talk to you of my affairs and engagements, as that tender\nfriendship may warrant.\n\nSir, you do me honour, was all I could say.\n\nI had a letter from the faithful Camilla. I hold not a correspondence\nwith her: but the treatment that her young lady met with, of which she\nhad got some general intimations, and some words that the bishop said to\nher, which expressed his wishes, that I would make them one more visit at\nBologna, urged her to write, begging of me, for Heaven's sake, to go\nover. But unless one of the family had written to me, and by consent of\nothers of it, what hope had I of a welcome, after I had been as often\nrefused, as I had requested while I was in Italy, to be admitted to the\npresence of the lady, who was so desirous of one interview more?--\nEspecially, as Mrs. Beaumont gave me no encouragement to go, but the\ncontrary, from what she observed of the inclinations of the family.\n\nMrs. Beaumont is still of opinion, as in the conclusion of the letter\nbefore you, that I should not go, unless the general and the marquis join\ntheir requests to those of the marchioness, the bishop, and Father\nMarescotti. But I had no sooner perused the bishop's letter, than I\nwrote, that I would most cheerfully comply with his wishes: but that I\nshould be glad that I might not be under any obligation to go further\nthan Bologna; where I might have the happiness to attend my Jeronymo, as\nwell as his sister.\n\nI had a little twitch at my heart, Lucy. I was sorry for it: but my\njudgment was entirely with him.\n\nAnd now, madam, you will wonder, that you see not any preparations for my\ndeparture. All is prepared: I only wait for the company of one\ngentleman, who is settling his affairs with all expedition to go with me.\nHe is an able, a skilful surgeon, who has had great practice abroad, and\nin the armies: and having acquired an easy fortune, is come to settle in\nhis native country. My Jeronymo expresses himself dissatisfied with his\nsurgeons. If Mr. LOWTHER can be of service to him, how happy shall I\nthink myself! And if my presence can be a means to restore the noble\nClementina--But how dare I hope it?--And yet I am persuaded, that in her\ncase, and with such a temper of mind, (unused to hardship and opposition\nas she had been,) the only way to recover her, would have been by\ncomplying with her in every thing that her heart or head was earnestly\nset upon: for what controul was necessary to a young lady, who never,\neven in the height of her malady, uttered a wish or thought that was\ncontrary to her duty either to God, or her parents; nor yet to the honour\nof her name; and, allow me, madam, to say, to the pride of her sex?\n\nI am under an obligation to go to Paris, proceeded he, from the will of\nmy late friend Mr. Danby. I shall stop there for a day or two only, in\norder to put things in a way for my last hand, on my return from Italy.\n\nWhen I am in Italy, I shall, perhaps, be enabled to adjust two or three\naccounts that stand out, in relation to the affairs of my ward.\n\nThis day, at dinner, I shall see Mrs. Oldham, and her sons; and in the\nafternoon, at tea, Mrs. O'Hara, and her husband, and Captain Salmonet.\n\nTo-morrow, I hope for the honour of your company, madam, and Mr. and Mrs.\nReeves's at dinner; and be so good as to engage them for the rest of the\nday. You must not deny me; because I shall want your influence upon\nCharlotte, to make her fix Lord G----'s happy day, that I may be able to\nsee their hands united before I set out; as my return will be\nuncertain--\n\nAh, Lucy! more twitches just then!--\n\nThursday next is the day fixed for the triple marriage of the Danby's. I\nhave promised to give Miss Danby to Mr. Galliard, and to dine with them\nand their friends at Enfield.\n\nIf I can see my Lord W---- and Charlotte happy before I go, I shall be\nhighly gratified.\n\nIt is another of my wishes, to see my friend Beauchamp in England first,\nand to leave him in possession of his father's love, and of his\nmother-in-law's civility. Dr. Bartlett and he will be happy in each\nother. I shall correspond with the doctor. He greatly admires you,\nmadam, and will communicate to you all you shall think worthy of your\nnotice, relating to the proceedings of a man who will always think\nhimself honoured by your inquiries after him.\n\nAh, Lucy! Sir Charles Grandison then sighed. He seemed to look more\nthan he spoke. I will not promise for my heart, if he treats me with\nmore than the tenderness of friendship: if he gives me room to think that\nhe wishes--But what can he wish? He ought to be, he must be,\nClementina's: and I will endeavour to make myself happy, if I can\nmaintain the second place in his friendship: and when he offers me this,\nshall I, Lucy, be so little as to be displeased with the man, who cannot\nbe to me all that I had once hoped he could be?--No!--He shall be the\nsame glorious creature in my eyes; I will admire his goodness of heart,\nand greatness of mind; and I will think him entitled to my utmost\ngratitude for the protection he gave me from a man of violence, and for\nthe kindness he has already shewn me. Is not friendship the basis of my\nlove? And does he not tender me that?\n\nNevertheless, at the time, do what I could, I found a tear ready to\nstart. My heart was very untoward, Lucy; and I was guilty of a little\nfemale turn. When I found the twinkling of my eyes would not disperse\nthe too ready drop, and felt it stealing down my cheek, I wiped it off--\nThe poor Emily, said I--She will be grieved at parting with you. Emily\nloves her guardian.\n\nAnd I love my ward. I once had a thought, madam, of begging your\nprotection of Emily: but as I have two sisters, I think she will be happy\nunder their wings, and in the protection of my good Lord L---- and the\nrather, as I have no doubt of overcoming her unhappy mother, by making\nher husband's interest a guaranty for her tolerable, if not good,\nbehaviour to her child.\n\nI was glad to carry my thoughts out of myself, as I may say, and from my\nown concerns. We all, sir, said I, look upon Mr. Beauchamp as a\nfuture--\n\nHusband for Emily, madam, interrupted he?--It must not be at my motion.\nMy friend shall be entitled to share with me my whole estate; but I will\nnever seek to lead the choice of my WARD. Let Emily, some time hence,\nfind out the husband she can be happy with; Beauchamp the wife he can\nlove: Emily, if I can help it, shall not be the wife of any man's\nconvenience. Beauchamp is nice, and I will be as nice for my WARD. And\nthe more so, as I hope she herself wants not delicacy. There is a\ncruelty in persuasion, where the heart rejects the person proposed,\nwhether the urger be parent or guardian.\n\nLord bless me, thought I, what a man is this!\n\nDo you expect Mr. Beauchamp soon, sir?\n\nEvery day, madam.\n\nAnd is it possible, sir, that you can bring all these things to bear\nbefore you leave England, and go so soon?\n\nI fear nothing but Charlotte's whimsies. Have you, madam, any reason to\napprehend that she is averse to an alliance with Lord G----? His father\nand aunt are very importunate for an early celebration.\n\nNone at all, sir.\n\nThen I shall depend much upon yours, and Lord and Lady L----'s influence\nover her.\n\nHe besought my excuse for detaining my attention so long. Upon his\nmotion to go, my two cousins came in. He took even a solemn leave of me,\nand a very respectful one of them.\n\nI had kept up my spirits to their utmost stretch: I besought my cousins\nto excuse me for a few minutes. His departure from me was too solemn;\nand I hurried up to my closet; and after a few involuntary sobs, a flood\nof tears relieved me. I besought, on my knees, peace to the disturbed\nmind of the excellent Clementina, calmness and resignation to my own, and\nsafety to Sir Charles. And then, drying my eyes at the glass, I went\ndown stairs to my cousins; and on their inquiries (with looks of deep\nconcern) after the occasion of my red eyes, I said, All is over! All is\nover! my dear cousins. I cannot blame him: he is all that is noble and\ngood--I can say no more just now. The particulars you shall have from my\npen.\n\nI went up stairs to write: and except for one half hour at dinner, and\nanother at tea, I stopt not till I had done.\n\nAnd here, quite tired, uneasy, vexed with myself, yet hardly knowing why,\nI lay down my pen.--Take what I have written, cousin Reeves: if you can\nread it, do: and then dispatch it to my Lucy.\n\nBut, on second thoughts, I will shew it to the two ladies, and Lord\nL----, before it is sent away. They will be curious to know what passed\nin a conversation, where the critical circumstances both of us were in,\nrequired a delicacy which I am not sure was so well observed on my side,\nas on his.\n\nI shall, I know, have their pity: but let nobody who pities not the noble\nClementina shew any for\n\nHARRIET BYRON.\n\n\n\nLETTER XII\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nTUESDAY NIGHT, APRIL 4.\n\n\n\nMiss Grandison came to me just as we had supped. She longed, she said,\nto see me; but was prevented coming before, and desired to know what had\npassed between her brother and me this morning. I gave her the letter,\nwhich I had but a little while before concluded. He had owned, she said,\nthat he had breakfasted with me, and spoke of me to her, and Lord and\nLady L---- with an ardor, that gave them pleasure. She put my letter\ninto her bosom. I may, I hope, Harriet--If you please, madam, said I.\n\nIf you please, madam, repeated she; and with that do-lo-rous accent too,\nmy Harriet!--My sister and I have been in tears this morning: Lord L----\nhad much ado to forbear. Sir Charles will soon leave us.\n\nIt can't be helped, Charlotte. Did you dine to-day in St.\nJames's-square?\n\nNo, indeed!--My brother had a certain tribe with him; and the woman also.\nIt is very difficult, I believe, Harriet, for good people to forbear\ndoing sometimes more than goodness requires of them.\n\nCould you not, Charlotte, have sat at table with them for one hour or\ntwo?\n\nMy brother did not ask me. He did not expect it. He gives every body\ntheir choice, you know. He told me last night who were to dine with him\nto-day, and supposed I would choose to dine with Lady L----, or with you,\nhe was so free as to say.\n\nHe did us an honour, which you thought too great a one. But if he had\nasked you, Charlotte--\n\nThen I should have bridled. Indeed, I asked him, if he did not over-do\nit?\n\nWhat was his answer?\n\nPerhaps he might--But I, said he, may never see Mrs. Oldham again. I\nwant to inform myself of her future intentions, with a view (over-do it\nagain, Charlotte!) to make her easy and happy for life. Her children are\nin the world. I want to give her a credit that will make her remembered\nby them, as they grow up, with duty. I hope I am superior to forms. She\nis conscious. I can pity her. She is a gentlewoman; and entitled to a\nplace at any man's table to whom she never was a servant. She never was\nmine.\n\nAnd what, Miss Grandison, could you say in answer? asked I.\n\nWhat!--Why I put up my lip.\n\nUngracious girl!\n\nI can't help it. That may become a man to do in such cases as this, that\nwould not a woman.\n\nSir Charles wants not delicacy, my dear, said I.\n\nHe must suppose, that I should have sat swelling, and been reserved: he\nwas right not to ask me--So be quiet, Harriet--And yet, perhaps, you\nwould be as tame to a husband's mistress, as you seem favourable to a\nfather's.\n\nShe then put on one of her arch looks--\n\nThe cases differ, Charlotte--But do you know what passed between the\ngenerous man, and the mortified woman and her children; mortified as they\nmust be by his goodness?\n\nYes, yes; I had curiosity enough to ask Dr. Bartlett about it all.\n\nPray, Charlotte--\n\nDr. Bartlett is favourable to every body, sinners as well as saints--He\nbegan with praising the modesty of her dress, the humility of her\nbehaviour: he said, that she trembled and looked down, till she was\nreassured by Sir Charles. Such creatures have all their tricks, Harriet.\n\nYou, Charlotte, are not favourable to sinners, and hardly to saints. But\npray proceed.\n\nWhy, he re-assured the woman, as I told you. And then proceeded to ask\nmany questions of the elder Oldham--I pitied that young fellow--to have a\nmother in his eye, whose very tenderness to the young ones kept alive the\nsense of her guilt. And yet what would she have been, had she not been\ndoubly tender to the innocents, who were born to shame from her fault?\nThe young man acknowledged a military genius; and Sir Charles told him,\nthat he would, on his return from a journey he was going to take,\nconsider whether he could not do him service in the way he chose. He\ngave him, it seems, a brief lecture on what he should aim to be, and what\navoid, to qualify himself for a man of true honour; and spoke very\nhandsomely of such gentlemen of the army as are real gentlemen. The\nyoung fellow, continued Miss Grandison, may look upon himself to be as\ngood as provided for, since my brother never gives the most distant hope\nthat is not followed by absolute certainty, the first opportunity, not\nthat offers, but which he can make.\n\nHe took great notice of the little boys. He dilated their hearts, and\nset them a prating; and was pleased with their prate. The doctor, who\nhad never seen him before in the company of children, applauded him for\nhis vivacity, and condescending talk to them. The tenderest father in\nthe world, he said, could not have behaved more tenderly, or shewed\nhimself more delighted with his own children, than he did with those\nbrats of Mrs. Oldham.\n\nAh, Charlotte! And is it out of doubt, that you are the daughter of Lady\nGrandison, and sister of Sir Charles Grandison?--Well, but I believe you\nare--Some children take after the father, some after the mother!--Forgive\nme, my dear.\n\nBut I won't. I have a great mind to quarrel with you, Harriet.\n\nPray don't; because I could neither help, nor can be sorry for, what I\nsaid. But pray proceed.\n\nWhy, he made presents to the children. I don't know what they were; nor\ncould the doctor tell me. I suppose very handsome ones; for he has the\nspirit of a prince. He inquired very particularly after the circumstances\nof the mother; and was more kind to her than many people would be to\ntheir own mothers.--He can account for this, I suppose--though I cannot.\nThe woman, it is true, is of a good family, and so forth: but that\nenhances her crime. Natural children abound in the present age. Keeping\nis fashionable. Good men should not countenance such wretches.--But my\nbrother and you are charitable creatures!--With all my heart, child.\nVirtue, however, has at least as much to say on one side of the question\nas on the other.\n\nWhen the poor children are in the world, as your brother said--When the\npoor women are penitents, true penitents--Your brother's treatment of\nMrs. Giffard was different. He is in both instances an imitator of the\nAlmighty; a humbler of the impenitent, and an encourager of those who\nrepent.\n\nWell, well; he is undoubtedly a good sort of young man; and, Harriet, you\nare a good sort of young woman. Where much is given, much is required:\nbut I have not given me such a large quantity of charity, as either of\nyou may boast: and how can I help it?--But, however, the woman went away\nblessing and praising him; and that, the doctor says, more with her eyes\nthan she was able to do in words. The elder youth departed in rapturous\nreverence: the children hung about his knees, on theirs. The doctor will\nhave it, that it was without bidding--Perhaps so--He raised them by turns\nto his arms, and kissed them.--Why, Harriet! your eyes glisten, child.\nThey would have run over, I suppose, had you been there! Is it, that\nyour heart is weakened with your present situation? I hope not. No, you\nare a good creature! And I see that the mention of a behaviour greatly\ngenerous, however slightly made, will have its force upon a heart so\ntruly benevolent as yours. You must be Lady Grandison, my dear: indeed\nyou must.--Well, but I must be gone. You dine with us to-morrow, my\nbrother says?\n\nHe did ask me; and desired me to engage my cousins. But he repeated not\nthe invitation when he went away.\n\nHe depends upon your coming: and so do we. He is to talk to me before\nyou, it seems: I can't tell about what: but by his hurrying on every\nthing, it is plain he is preparing to leave us.\n\nHe is, madam.\n\n'He is, madam!' And with that dejected air, and mendicant voice--Speak\nup like a woman!--The sooner he sets out, if he must go, the sooner he\nwill return. Come, come, Harriet, you shall be Lady Grandison still--Ah!\nand that sigh too! These love-sick folks have a language that nobody\nelse can talk to them in: and then she affectedly sighed--Is that right,\nHarriet?--She sighed again--No, it is not: I never knew what a sigh was,\nbut when my father vexed my sister; and that was more for fear he should\none day be as cruel to me, than for her sake. We can be very generous\nfor others, Harriet, when we apprehend that one day we may want the same\npity ourselves. Our best passions, my dear, have their mixtures of\nself-love.\n\nYou have drawn a picture of human nature, Charlotte, that I don't like.\n\nIt is a likeness for all that.\n\nShe arose, snatched my hand, hurried to the door--Be with us, Harriet,\nand cousin Reeves, and cousin Reeves, as soon as you can to-morrow. I\nwant to talk to you, my dear (to me) of an hundred thousand things before\ndinner. Remember we dine early.\n\nAway she fluttered--Happy Miss Grandison! What charming spirits she has!\n\n\n\nLETTER XIII\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 5.\n\n\nMiss Jervois came to me this morning by six; impatient, as she said, to\ncommunicate good news to me. I was in my closet writing. I could not\nsleep.\n\nI have seen my mother, said she; and we are good friends. Was she ever\nunkind to me, madam?\n\nDear creature! said I, and clasped her to my bosom, you are a sweet girl!\nOblige me with the particulars.\n\nLet me, Lucy, give you, as near as I can recollect, the amiable young\ncreature's words and actions on this occasion.\n\nSit down, my love, said I.--What! When I am talking of a reconciled\nmother! And to dear Miss Byron!--No, indeed.\n\nShe often held out one open hand, while the forefinger of the other, in\nfull action, patted it; as at other times both were spread, with pretty\nwonder and delight: and thus she began:--\n\nWhy, you must know, it was about six o'clock yesterday afternoon, that my\nmother and her husband, and Captain Salmonet, came. I was told of their\nvisit but two hours before: and when the coach stopped, and I at the\nwindow saw them alight, I thought I should have fainted away. I would\nhave given half I was worth in the world to have been an hundred miles\noff.\n\nDr. Bartlett was there, and received them. My guardian was unexpectedly\nengaged in answering a letter sent him by Lord W----, for which a\ngentleman waited: but they had not been there a quarter of an hour, when\nhe entered, and made apologies to them in his usual gracious manner.\nNever, the doctor says, did any body look so respectful as the major and\nthe captain; and they would have made apologies to my guardian, for their\nlast behaviour to him; but he would not let them. And my mother, the\ndoctor says, from the very first, behaved prettily.\n\nThe moment she asked for me, my guardian himself condescended to come up\nto me, and took my hand--Was not that very good of him?--My dear, said\nhe, as he led me down stairs, (and spoke so kindly,) don't tremble so: am\nI not with you?--Your mother is very calm and composed: you must ask her\nblessing. I shall ease your tender heart of every pang. I shall hint to\nyou what to do, and how to behave to the gentlemen, as occasions arise.\n\nHe had no sooner said the words, but the drawing-room door gave way to\nhis hand, and I was in the room with him.\n\nDown on my knees dropt I--as I now do to you: but I could not speak.\nThus I did. [And she kissed my hand, and bowed her face upon it.] And\nmy mother raised me--You must raise me, madam--Yes, just so--And she\nkissed me too, and wept on my neck; and called me pretty names; and\nencouraged me, and said she loved me, as she loved her own soul--And I\nwas encouraged.\n\nMy guardian then, with the air and manner of a gracious prince, took my\nhand, and presented it first to the major, then to the captain; and they\neach kissed my hand, and spoke in my praise, I can't tell how many fine\nthings.\n\nMajor, said my guardian, when he presented me to him, you must excuse the\ndear child's weakness of spirits: she wishes you all happiness on your\nnuptials: she has let me know, that she is very desirous to do you\nservice for her mother's sake.\n\nThe major swore by his soul, I was an angel!--Captain Salmonet said,\nthat, by his salvation, I was a charming young lady!\n\nMy mother wept--O, Sir! said she to my guardian: and dropping down in a\nchair by the window, not a word more could she speak.\n\nI ran to her, and clasped my arms about her. She wept the more: I wiped\nher eyes with her own handkerchief: I told her, it went to my heart to\nsee her cry: I begged she would spare me this grief.\n\nShe clasped her arms then about me, and kissed my cheek, and my forehead.\nO, thought I, it is very good of you, my dear mother.\n\nThen came my guardian to us, and he kindly took my mother's hand, and\nconducted her to the fire-side; and he led me, and placed me by her, at\nthe tea-table; and he made the major and the captain sit down by him: so\nmuch graciousness in his countenance. O, madam! I shall be an idolater,\nI am afraid. And he said, Emily, my dear, you will make tea for us. My\nsister dined abroad, madam, to my mother.--Yes, sir, I will, said I: and\nI was as lively as a bird.\n\nBut before the servants came in, Let me tell you, madam, said he, what\nMiss Jervois has proposed to me.--They were in silent expectation.\n\nShe has desired that you, major, will accept from her, for your mutual\nuse, of an additional 100\u00c2\u00a3. a year; which I shall order to be paid you\nquarterly, during Mrs. O'Hara's life, not doubting but you will make her\nas happy as it is in your power to make her.\n\nMy mother bowed, coloured with gratitude, and looked obliged.\n\nAnd she begs of you, madam, turning to my mother, that you will accept,\nas from the Major, another 100\u00c2\u00a3. a year, for pin-money, which he, or\nwhich you, madam, will draw upon me for; also quarterly, if you choose\nnot to trouble him to do it: for this 100\u00c2\u00a3. a year must be appropriated\nto your sole and separate use, madam; and not be subject to your\ncontroul, Major O'Hara.\n\nGood God! sir! said the Major!--What a wretch was I, the last time I was\nhere!--There is no bearing of this!\n\nHe got up, and went to the window: and the captain said, Blessed Jesu!\nand something else, which I could not mind; for I was weeping like a\nbaby.\n\nWhat, sir! said my mother, 400\u00c2\u00a3. a year! Do you mean so?--I do, madam--\nAnd, sir, to be so generously paid me my 100\u00c2\u00a3. of it, as if I received it\nnot from my child, but from my husband!--Good God! How you overpower me,\nsir! What shame, what remorse, do you strike into my heart!\n\nAnd my poor mother's tears ran down as fast as mine.\n\nO madam, said the dear girl to me, clasping her arms about me, how your\ntender heart is touched!--It is well you were not there!\n\nDr. Bartlett came in to tea. My guardian would not permit Antony, who\noffered himself, to wait. Antony had been my own papa's servant, when my\nmother was not so good.\n\nNothing but blessings, nothing but looks and words of admiration and\ngratitude, passed all the tea-time. How their hearts rejoiced, I\nwarrant!--Is it not a charming thing, madam, to make people's hearts\nglad?--To be sure it is! How many hearts has my guardian rejoiced! You\nmust bid him be cross to me, or I shall not know what to do with myself!\n--But then, if he was, I should only get by myself, and cry, and be angry\nwith myself, and think he could not be to blame.\n\nO my love, my Emily! said I, take care of your gratitude: that drew in\nyour true friend.\n\nWell, but how can it be helped, madam? Can a right heart be ungrateful?\n--Dr. Bartlett says, There is no such thing as true happiness in this\nlife: and is it not better to be unhappy from good men and women, than\nfrom bad?--Dear madam, why you have often made me unhappy, because of\nyour goodness to me; and because I knew, that I neither could deserve nor\nreturn it.\n\nThe dear prater went on--My guardian called me aside, when tea was over.\nMy Emily, said he, [I do love he should call me his Emily!--But all the\nworld is his Emily, I think,] Let me see what you will do with these two\nnotes; giving me two bank-notes of 25\u00c2\u00a3. each.--Present pin-money and cash\nmay be wanted. We will suppose that your mother has been married a\nquarter of a year. Her pin-money and the additional annuity may commence\nfrom the 25th of December last. Let me, Emily, when they go away, see\nthe graceful manner in which you will dispose of the notes: and from Mr.\nO'Hara's behaviour upon it, we shall observe whether he is a man with\nwhom your mother, if it be not her own fault, (now you have made it their\ninterest to be kind to each other,) may live well: but the motion be all\nyour own.\n\nHow good this was! I could have kissed the hand that gave me the notes,\nif I thought it would not have looked too free.\n\nI understand you, sir, said I.\n\nAnd when they went away, pouring out their very hearts in grateful joy, I\naddressed myself to Mr. O'Hara. Sir, said I, it is proper that the\npayment of the additional annuity should have a commencement. Let it be\nfrom Christmas last. Accept of the first payment from my own hands--And\nI gave him one 25\u00c2\u00a3. note: and looking at my mother, with a look of duty,\nfor fear be should mistake, and discredit himself in the eyes of the\ndeepest discerner in the world, gave him the other.\n\nHe looked upon first one, then upon the other note with surprise--And\nthen bowing to the ground to me, and to my guardian, he stept to my\nmother, and presented them both to her. You, madam, said he, must speak:\nI cannot as I ought: God send me with a whole heart out of this house!\nHe hurried out, and when he was in the hall, wiped his eyes, and sobbed\nlike a child, as one of the servants told my Anne.\n\nMy mother looked upon one note as her husband had done, and upon the\nother; and, lifting up her eyes, embraced me--And would have said\nsomething to my guardian, but he prevented her, by saying--Emily will be\nalways dutiful to you, madam, and respectful to Mr. O'Hara: may you be\nhappy together!\n\nAnd he led her out--Was ever such a condescension! He led her out to her\nhusband, who, being a little recovered, was just about to give some money\nto the servant, who was retiring from the offer.--Nobody, said my\nguardian, graciously smiling, pays my servants but myself, Mr. O'Hara.\nThey are good people, and merit my favour.\n\nAnd he went to the very door with my mother. I could not. I ran back,\ncrying for joy, into the drawing-room, when they went out of it. I could\nnot bear myself. How could I, you know, madam?--Captain Salmonet all the\ntime wiped his eyes, shrugged his shoulders, lifted up his hands, and\ncried out upon Jesu; and once or twice he crossed himself: but all the\ntime my guardian looked and acted, as if those actions and praises were\nnothing to be proud of.\n\nWhen he came in to me, I arose, and threw myself at his feet; but could\nonly say, Thank you, sir, for your goodness to my mother. He raised me.\nHe sat down by me: See, child, (said he, and he took my hand: my heart\nwas sensible of the favour, and throbbed with joy,) what it is in the\npower of people of fortune to do. You have a great one. Now your mother\nis married, I have hopes of her. They will at least keep up appearances\nto each other, and to the world. They neither of them want sense. You\nhave done an act of duty and benevolence both in one. The man who would\ngrudge them this additional 200\u00c2\u00a3. a year out of your fortune, to make\nyour parent happy, shall not have my Emily--Shall he?\n\nYour Emily, your happy Emily, sir, has not, cannot have a heart that is\nworth notice, if it be not implicitly guided by you.--This I said, madam:\nand it is true.\n\nAnd did he not, said I, clasp his Emily to his generous bosom, when you\nsaid so?\n\nNo, madam; that would have been too great an honour: but he called me,\ngood child! and said, you shall never be put to pay me an implicit\nregard: your own reason (and he called me child again) shall always be\nthe judge of my conduct to you, and direct your observances of my advice.\nSomething like this he said; but in a better manner than I can say it.\n\nHe calls me oftener child, madam, than any thing else when we are alone\ntogether; and is not quite so free, I think, at such times, in his\nbehaviour to me, (yet is vastly gracious, I don't know how,) as when we\nare in company--Why is that? I am sure, I equally respect him, at one\ntime as at another--Do you think, madam, there is any thing in the\nobservation? Is there any reason for it?--I do love to study him, and to\nfind out the meaning of his very looks as well as words. Sir Charles\nGrandison's heart is the book of heaven--May I not study it?\n\nStudy it, my love! while you have an opportunity. But he will soon leave\nus: he will soon leave England.\n\nSo I fear: and I will love and pity the poor Clementina, whose heart is\nso much wounded and oppressed. But my guardian shall be nobody's but\nyours. I have prayed night and day, the first thing and the last thing,\never since I have heard of Lady Clementina, that you, and nobody but you,\nmay be Lady Grandison: and I will continue my prayers.--But will you\nforgive me: I always conclude them with praying, that you will both\nconsent to let the poor Emily live with you.\n\nSweet girl! The poor Emily, said she?--I embraced her, and we mingled\ntears, both our hearts full, each for the other; and each perhaps for\nherself.\n\nShe hurried away. I resumed my pen.--Run off what had passed, almost as\nswift as thought. I quit it to prepare to attend my cousins to St.\nJames's-square.\n\n\n\nLETTER XIV\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nWEDNESDAY NIGHT, APRIL 5.\n\n\nMiss Grandison, as I told you, took with her my letter of yesterday. As\nsoon as my cousin Reeves and I entered Sir Charles's house, the two\nsisters conducted us into the drawing-room adjoining to the\ndining-parlour, and congratulated me on the high compliment their brother\nhad made me, though in preference to themselves, and his\ncommunicativeness and tender behaviour to me. Lord L---- joined us, and\nhe, having read the letter, congratulated me also--On what, Lucy?--Why on\nthe possibility, that if the unhappy Clementina should die; or if she\nshould be buried for life in a nunnery; or if she should be otherwise\ndisposed of; why then, that your Harriet may have room given her to hope\nfor a civil husband in Sir Charles Grandison, and half a heart: Is not\nthis the sum of these humbling congratulations?\n\nSir Charles, when we came, was in his study with Mr. Lowther, the surgeon\nwhom he had engaged to go abroad with him: but he just came out to\nwelcome us; and then returned.--He had also with him two physicians,\neminent for their knowledge in disorders of the head, to whom he had\nbefore communicated the case of the unhappy Clementina; and who brought\nto him in writing their opinions of the manner in which she ought to be\ntreated, according to the various symptoms of her disorder.\n\nWhen he joined us, he told us this; and said very high things at the same\ntime in praise of the English surgeons; and particularly of this\ngentleman: and added, that as nervous disorders were more frequent in\nEngland, than in any country in the world, he was willing to hope, that\nthe English physicians were more skilful than those of any other country\nin the management of persons afflicted with such maladies: and as he was\nnow invited over, he was determined to furnish himself with all the means\nhe could think of, that were likely to be useful in restoring and healing\nfriends so dear to him.\n\nMiss Grandison told him, that we were all in some apprehensions, on his\ngoing to ltaly, of that fierce and wrong-headed man the general. Miss\nByron, said she, has told us, that Mrs. Beaumont advises not your going\nover.\n\nThe young Marquis della Porretta, said he, is hasty; but he is a gallant\nman, and loves his sister. His grief on the unhappy situation they are\nin demands allowance. It is natural in a heavy calamity to look out of\nourselves for the occasion. I have not any apprehensions from him, or\nfrom any body else. The call upon me is a proper one. The issue must be\nleft where it ought to be left. If my visit will give comfort to any one\nof the family, I shall be rewarded: If to more than one, happy--And,\nwhatever be the event, shall be easier in myself, than I could be, were I\nnot to comply with the request of the bishop, were he only to have made\nit.\n\nLord L---- asked Sir Charles, whether he had fixed the day of his setting\nout?\n\nI have, said he, within this half hour. Mr. Lowther has told me, that he\nshall be ready by the beginning of next week; and on Saturday sennight I\nhope to be at Dover, on my way.\n\nWe looked upon one another. Miss Grandison told me afterwards, that my\ncolour went and came several times, and that she was afraid for me. My\nheart was indeed a little affected. I believe I must not think of taking\nleave of him when he sets out. Ah, Lucy! Nine days hence!--Yet, in less\nthan nine days after that, I shall be embraced by the tenderest relations\nthat ever creature had to boast of.\n\nSir Charles taking his sister aside, I want, said he, to say a few words\nto you, Charlotte. They were about half an hour together; and then\nreturning, I am encouraged to think, said he, that Charlotte will give\nher hand to Lord G----. She is a woman of honour, and her heart must\ntherefore go with it.--I have a request to make to her, before all you\nour common friends--The Earl of G----, Lady Gertrude, Lord G----, all\njoin in one suit: it is, that I may be allowed to give my sister to Lord\nG---- before I leave England.\n\nI have told you, brother, that it is impossible, if you go away in nine\nor ten days time.\n\nSir Charles particularly requested my influence. I could have no doubt,\nI said, but Miss Grandison would oblige her brother.\n\nShe vehemently opposed so early a day.\n\nIn a most affectionate manner, yet with an air of seriousness, he urged\nhis request. He said, that it was very proper for him to make some\ndispositions of his affairs before he went abroad. He should leave\nEngland with much more pleasure, if he saw his Charlotte the wife of a\nman so worthy as Lord G----: Lord G----, said he, adores you: You\nintended to be his: Resolve to oblige your brother, who, though he cannot\nbe happy himself, wishes to see you so.\n\nO, Sir Charles! said she, you ruin me by your solemnity, and by your\ngoodness.\n\nThe subject is not a light one. I am greatly in earnest, Charlotte. I\nhave many affairs on my hands. My heart is in this company; yet my\nengagements will permit me but few opportunities to enjoy it between this\nand Tuesday next. If you deny me now, I must acquiesce: If you have more\nthan punctilio to plead, say you have; and I will not urge you farther.\n\nAnd so this is the last time of asking, sir? A little archly--\n\nNot the last time of my Lord G----'s, but of mine--But I will not allow\nyou now to answer me lightly. If you can name a day before Tuesday, you\nwill greatly oblige me. I will leave you to consider of it. And he\nwithdrew.\n\nEvery one then urged her to oblige her brother. Lady L---- very\nparticularly. She told her, that he was entitled to her compliance; and\nthat he had spoken to her on this subject in a still more earnest manner.\nShe should hardly be able to excuse her, she said, if the serious hint he\nhad given about settling his affairs before he went abroad, had not\nweight with her. You know, Charlotte, continued she, that he can have no\nmotive but your good; and you have told me, that you intend to have Lord\nG----; and that you esteem his father, his aunt, and every one of his\nfamily, whom you have seen; and they are all highly pleased with you.\nSettlements are already drawn: that my brother told you last night.\nNothing is wanting but your day.\n\nI wish he was in half the hurry to be married himself.\n\nSo he would be, I dare say, if marriage were as much in his power, as it\nis in yours.\n\nWhat a deuse, to be married to a man in a week's time, with whom I have\nquarrelled every day for a fortnight past!--Pride and petulance must go\ndown by degrees, sister. A month, at least, is necessary, to bring my\nfeatures to such a placidness with him, as to allow him to smile in my\nface.\n\nYour brother has hinted, Charlotte, said I, that he loves you for your\nvivacity; and should still more, if you consulted time and occasion.\n\nHe has withdrawn, sister, said Lord L----, with a resolution, if you deny\nhim, to urge you no further.\n\nI hate his peremptoriness.\n\nHas he not told you, Charlotte, said I, and that in a manner so serious,\nas to affect every body, that there is a kind of necessity for it?\n\nI don't love this Clementina, Harriet: all this is owing to her.\n\nJust then a rapping at the door signified visitors; and Emily ran in--\nLord G----, the Earl, and Lady Gertrude, believe me!\n\nMiss Grandison changed colour. A contrivance of my brother's!--Ah, Lord!\nNow shall I be beset!--I will be sullen, that I may not be saucy.\n\nSullen you can't be, Charlotte, said Lady L----: but saucy you can.\nRemember, however, my brother's earnestness, and spare Lord G---- before\nhis father and aunt, or you will give me, and every body, pain.\n\nHow can I? Our last quarrel is not made up: but advise him not to be\neither impertinent or secure.\n\nImmediately enter'd Sir Charles, introducing the Earl and Lady Gertrude.\nAfter the first compliments, Pray, Sir Charles, said Miss Grandison,\ndrawing him aside, towards me, and whispering, tell me truly: Did you not\nknow of this visit?\n\nI invited them, Charlotte, whispered he. I meant not however to surprise\nyou. If you comply, you will give me great pleasure: if you do not, I\nwill not be dis-pleased with my sister.\n\nWhat can I do? Either be less good to me, sir, or less hurrying.\n\nYou have sacrificed enough to female punctilio, Charlotte. Lord G----\nhas been a zealous courtier. You have no doubt of the ardor of his\npassion, nor of your own power. Leave the day to me. Let it be Tuesday\nnext.\n\nGood heaven! I can't bear you, after such a--and she gasped, as if for\nbreath; and he turning from her to me, she went to Lady Gertrude, who,\nrising, took her hand, and withdrew with her into the next room.\n\nThey staid out till they were told dinner was served: and when they\nreturned, I thought I never saw Miss Grandison look so lovely. A\ncharming flush had overspread her cheeks: a sweet consciousness in her\neyes gave a female grace to her whole aspect, and softened, as I may say,\nthe natural majesty of her fine features.\n\nLord G---- looked delighted, as if his heart were filled with happy\npresages. The earl seemed no less pleased.\n\nMiss Grandison was unusually thoughtful all dinnertime: she gave me great\njoy to see her so, in the hope, that when the lover becomes the husband,\nthe over-lively mistress will be sunk in the obliging wife.--And yet,\nnow and then, as the joy in my lord's heart overflowed at his lips, I\ncould observe that archness rising to her eye, that makes one both love\nand fear her.\n\nAfter dinner, the Earl of G---- and Lady Gertrude desired a conference\nwith Sir Charles and Lady L----. They were not long absent, when Sir\nCharles came in, and carried out Miss Grandison to them. Lord G----'s\ncomplexion varied often.\n\nSir Charles left them together, and joined us. We were standing; and he\nsingled me out--I hope, madam, said he, that Charlotte may be prevailed\nupon for Tuesday next: but I will not urge it further.\n\nI thought that he was framing himself to say something particular to me,\nwhen Lady L---- came in, and desired him and me to step to her sister,\nwho had retired from the Earl and Lady Gertrude, by consent.\n\nAh, my Harriet! said she, pity me, my dear!--Debasement is the child of\npride!--Then turning to Sir Charles, I acknowledge myself overcome, said\nshe, by your earnestness, as you are so soon to leave us; and by the\nimportunities of the Earl of G----, Lady Gertrude, and my sister--\nUnprepared in mind, in clothes, I am resolved to oblige the best of\nbrothers. Do you, sir, dispose of me as you think fit.\n\nMy sister consents, sir, said Lady L----, for next Tuesday.\n\nCheerfully, I hope. If Charlotte balances whether, if she took more\ntime, she should have Lord G---- at all, let her take it. Lord L----, in\nmy absence, will be to her all that I wish to be, when she shall\ndetermine.\n\nI balance not, sir: but I thought to have had a month's time, at least,\nto look about me, and having treated Lord G---- too flippantly, to give\nhim by degrees some fairer prospects of happiness with me, than hitherto\nhe has had.\n\nSir Charles embraced her. She was all his sister, he said. Let the\nalteration now begin. Lord G---- would rejoice in it, and consider all\nthat had passed, as trials only of his love for her. The obliging wife\nwould banish from his remembrance the petulant mistress. And now, allow\nme, my dear sister, to present you to the Earl and Lady Gertrude.\n\nHe led her in to them. Lady L---- took my hand, and led me in also.--\nCharlotte, my lord, yields to yours and Lady Gertrude's importunities.\nNext Tuesday will give the two families a near and tender relation to\neach other.\n\nThe earl saluted her in a very affectionate manner: so did Lady Gertrude;\nwho afterwards ran out for her nephew: and, leading him in, presented him\nto Miss Grandison.\n\nShe had just time to whisper me, as he approached her; Ah, Harriet! now\ncomes the worst part of the show.--He kneeled on one knee, kissed her\nhand: but was too much overjoyed to speak; for Lady Gertrude had told\nhim, as she led him in, that Tuesday was to be his happy day.\n\nIt is impossible, Lucy, but Sir Charles Grandison must carry every point\nhe sets his heart upon. When he shall appear before the family of\nPorretta in Italy, who will be able to withstand him?--Is not his\nconsequence doubled, more than doubled, since he was with them? The man\nwhose absence they requested, they now invite to come among them. They\nhave tried every experiment to restore their Clementina: he has a noble\nestate now in possession. The fame of his goodness is gone out to\ndistant countries. O my dear! All opposition must fly before him. And\nif it be the will of Heaven to restore Clementina, all her friends must\nconcur in giving her to him upon the terms he has proposed; and from\nwhich, having himself proposed them, Sir Charles Grandison cannot recede.\n\nHis heart, it is evident, is at Bologna. Well, and so it ought to be.\nAnd yet I could not forbear being sensibly touched by the following\nwords, which I overheard him say to Lord L----, in answer to something my\nlord said to him:\n\n'I am impatient to be abroad. Had I not waited for Mr. Lowther, the last\nletters I received from Italy should have been answered in person.'\n\nBut as honour, compassion, love, friendship (still nobler than love!)\nhave demands upon him, let him obey the call. He has set me high in his\nesteem. Let me be worthy of his friendship. Pangs I shall occasionally\nfeel; but who that values one person above the rest of the world, does\nnot?\n\nSir Charles, as we sat at tea, mentioned his cousin Grandison to Lord\nL----: It is strange, my lord, said he, that we hear nothing of our\ncousin Everard, since he was seen at White's. But whenever he emerges,\nCharlotte, if I am absent, receive him without reproaches: yet I should\nbe glad that he could have rejoiced with us. Must I leave England, and\nnot see him?\n\nIt has been, it seems, the way of this unhappy man, to shut himself up\nwith some woman in private lodgings, for fear his cousin should find him\nout; and in two or three months, when he has been tired of his wicked\ncompanion, emerge, as Sir Charles called it, to notice, and then seek for\nhis cousin's favour and company, and live for as many more months in a\nstate of contrition. And Sir Charles, in his great charity, believes,\nthat till some new temptation arises, he is in earnest in his penitence;\nand hopes, that in time he will see his errors.\n\nOh, Lucy! What a poor creeping, mean wretch is a libertine, when one\nlooks down upon him, and up to such a glorious creature as Sir Charles\nGrandison!\n\nSir Charles was led to talk of his engagement for to-morrow, on the\ntriple marriage in the Danby family. We all gave him joy of the happy\nsuccess that had rewarded his beneficent spirit, with regard to that\nfamily. He gave us the characters of the three couples greatly to their\nadvantage, and praised the families on both sides, which were to be so\nclosely united on the morrow; not forgetting to mention kindly honest Mr.\nSylvester the attorney.\n\nHe told us, that he should set out on Friday early for Windsor, in order\nto attend Lord W---- in his first visit to Mansfield-house. You, Lady\nL----, will have the trouble given you, said he, of procuring to be\nnew-set the jewels of the late Lady W---- for a present to the future\nbride. My lord shewed them to me (among a great number of other valuable\ntrinkets of his late wife's) in my last return from the Hall. They are\nrich, and will do credit to his quality. You, my Lord L----, you, my\nsisters, will be charmed with your new aunt, and her whole family. I\nhave joy on the happiness in prospect that will gild the latter days of\nmy mother's brother; and at the same time be a means of freeing from\noppression an ancient and worthy family.\n\nTears were in every eye. There now, thought I, sits this princely man,\nrejoicing every one who sees him, and hears him speak: But where will he\nbe nine days hence? And whose this day twelvemonth?\n\nHe talked with particular pleasure of the expected arrival of his\nBeauchamp. He pleased himself, that he should leave behind him a man who\nwould delight every body, and supply to his friends his absence.--What a\ncharacter did he give, and Dr. Bartlett confirm, of that amiable friend\nof his!\n\nHow did the Earl and Lady Gertrude dwell upon all he said! They prided\nthemselves on the relation they were likely so soon to stand in to so\nvaluable a man.\n\nIn your last letter, you tell me, Lucy, that Mr. Greville has the\nconfidence to throw out menaces against this excellent man--Sorry wretch!\n--How my heart rises against him!--He--But no more of such an earth-born\ncreature.\n\n\n\nLETTER XV\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nTHURSDAY MORNING, APRIL 6.\n\n\nMiss Grandison, accompanied by Miss Jervois, has just left us. Lady\nL---- has undertaken, she says, to set all hands at work, to have things\nin tolerable order, early as the day is, for Tuesday next. Miss\nGrandison (would you believe it?) owns, that she wants spirits to order\nanything. What must be the solemnity of that circumstance, when near,\nthat shall make Charlotte Grandison want spirits?\n\nShe withdrew with me to my apartment. She threw herself into a chair:\n'Tis a folly to deny it, Harriet, but I am very low, and very silly: I\ndon't like next Tuesday by any means.\n\nIs your objection only to the day, my dear?\n\nI do not like the man.\n\nIs there any man whom you like better?\n\nI can't say that neither. But this brother of mine makes me think\ncontemptibly of all other men. I would compound for a man but half so\ngood--Tender, kind, humane, polite, and even cheerful in affliction!--O,\nHarriet! where is there such another man?\n\nNo where.--But you don't by marriage lose, on the contrary, you further\nengage and secure, the affection of this brother. You will have a\ngood-natured worthy man for your husband; a man who loves you, and you\nwill have your brother besides.\n\nDo you think I can be happy with Lord G----?\n\nI am sure you may, if it be not your own fault.\n\nThat's the thing: I may, perhaps, bear with the man; but I cannot honour\nhim.\n\nThen don't vow to honour him. Don't meet him at the altar.\n\nYet I must. But I believe I think too much: and consideration is no\nfriend to wedlock.--Would to Heaven that the same hour that my hand and\nLord G----'s were joined, yours and my brother's were also united!\n\nAh, Miss Grandison! If you love me, try to wean me; and not to encourage\nhopes of what never, never can be.\n\nDear creature! You will be greater than Clementina, and that is greater\nthan the greatest, if you can conquer a passion, that overturned her\nreason.\n\nDo not, my Charlotte, make comparisons in which the conscience of your\nHarriet tells her she must be a sufferer. There is no occasion for me to\ndespise myself, in order to hold myself inferior to Clementina.\n\nWell, you are a noble creature!--But, the approaching Tuesday--I cannot\nbear to think of it.\n\nDear Charlotte!\n\nAnd dear Harriet too!--But the officiousness, the assiduities, of this\ntrifling man are disgustful to me.\n\nYou don't hate him?--\n\nHate him--True--I don't hate him--But I have been so much accustomed to\ntreat him like a fool, that I can't help thinking him one. He should not\nhave been so tame to such a spirit as mine. He should have been angry\nwhen I played upon him. I have got a knack of it, and shall never leave\nit off, that's certain.\n\nThen I hope he will be angry with you. I hope that he will resent your\nill-treatment of him.\n\nToo late, too late to begin, Harriet. I won't take it of him now. He\nhas never let me see that his face can become two sorts of features. The\npoor man can look sorrowful; that I know full well: but I shall always\nlaugh when he attempts to look angry.\n\nYou know better, Charlotte. You may give him so much cause for anger,\nthat you may make it habitual to him, and then would be glad to see him\npleased. Men have an hundred ways that women have not to divert\nthemselves abroad, when they cannot be happy at home. This I have heard\nobserved by--\n\nBy your grandmother, Harriet? Good old lady! In her reign it might be\nso; but you will find, that women now have as many ways to divert\nthemselves abroad as the men. Have you not observed this yourself in one\nof your letters to Lucy? Ah! my dear! we can every hour of the\ntwenty-four be up with our monarchs, if they are undutiful.\n\nBut Charlotte Grandison will not, cannot--\n\nWhy that's true, my dear--But I shall not then be a Grandison. Yet the\nman will have some security from my brother's goodness. He is not only\ngood himself, but he makes every one related to him, either from fear or\nshame, good likewise. But I think that when one week or fortnight is\nhappily over, and my spirits are got up again from the depression into\nwhich this abominable hurry puts them, I could fall upon some inventions\nthat would make every-one laugh, except the person who might take it into\nhis head that he may be a sufferer by them: and who can laugh, and be\nangry, in the same moment?\n\nYou should not marry, Charlotte, till this wicked vein of humour and\nraillery is stopt.\n\nI hope it will hold me till fifty.\n\nDon't say so, Charlotte--Say rather that you hope it will hold you so\nlong only as it may be thought innocent or inoffensive, by the man whom\nit will be your duty to oblige, and so long as it will bring no discredit\nto yourself.\n\nYour servant, Goody Gravity!--But what must be, must. The man is bound\nto see it. It will be all his own seeking. He will sin with his eyes\nopen. I think he has seen enough of me to take warning. All that I am\nconcerned about is for the next week or fortnight. He will be king all\nthat time--Yet, perhaps not quite all neither. And I shall be his\nsovereign ever after, or I am mistaken. What a deuse, shall a woman\nmarry a man of talents not superior to her own, and forget to reward\nherself for her condescension?--But, high-ho!--There's a sigh, Harriet.\nWere I at home, I would either sing you a song, or play you a tune, in\norder to raise my own heart.\n\nShe besought me then, with great earnestness, to give her my company till\nthe day arrived, and on the day. You see, said she, that my brother has\nengagements till Monday. Dear creature! support, comfort me--Don't you\nsee my heart beat through my stays?--If you love me, come to me to-morrow\nto breakfast; and leave me not for the whole time--Are you not my sister,\nand the friend of my heart? I will give you a month for it, upon demand.\nCome, let us go down; I will ask the consent of both your cousins.\n\nShe did: and they, with their usual goodness to me, cheerfully complied.\n\nSir Charles set out this morning to attend the triple marriages; dressed\ncharmingly, his sister says. I have made Miss Grandison promise to give\nme an account of such particulars, as, by the help of Saunders, and Sir\nCharles's own relation, she can pick up. All we single girls, I believe,\nare pretty attentive to such subjects as these; as what one day may be\nour own concern.\n\n\n\nLETTER XVI\n\nMISS GRANDISON, TO MISS BYRON\nTHURSDAY NIGHT.\n\n\nUnreasonable, wicked, cruel Byron! To expect a poor creature, so near\nher execution, to write an account of other people's behaviour in the\nsame tremendous circumstances! The matrimonial noose has hung over my\nhead for some time past; and now it is actually fitted to my devoted\nneck.--Almost choaked, my dear!--This moment done hearing read, the\nfirsts, seconds, thirds, fourths, to near a dozen of them--Lord be\nmerciful to us!--And the villanous lawyer rearing up to me his spectacled\nnose, as if to see how I bore it! Lord G---- insulting me, as I thought,\nby his odious leers: Lady Gertrude simpering; little Emily ready to bless\nherself--How will the dear Harriet bear these abominable recitatives?--\nBut I am now up stairs from them all, in order to recover my breath, and\nobey my Byron.\n\nWell, but what am I now to say about the Danbys? Richard has made his\nreport; Sir Charles has told us some things: yet I will only give you\nheads: make out the rest.\n\nIn the first place, my brother went to Mrs. Harrington's (Miss Danby's\naunt:) she did every thing but worship him. She had with her two young\nladies, relations of her late husband, dainty damsels of the city, who\nhad procured themselves to be invited, that they might see the man, whom\nthey called, a wonder of generosity and goodness. Richard heard one of\nthem say to the other, Ah, sister, this is a king of a man! What pity\nthere are not many such! But, Harriet, if there were a hundred of them,\nwe would not let one of them go into the city for a wife; would we, my\ndear?\n\nSir Charles praised Miss Danby. She was full of gratitude; and of\nhumility, I suppose. Meek, modest, and humble, are qualities of which\nmen are mighty fond in women. But matrimony, and a sense of obligation,\nare equally great humblers even of spirits prouder than that of Miss\nDanby; as your poor Charlotte can testify.\n\nThe young gentlemen, with the rest, were to meet Sir Charles, the bride,\nand these ladies, at St. Helen's, I think the church is called.\n\nAs if wedlock were an honour, the Danby girl, in respect to Sir Charles,\nwas to be first yoked. He gave her away to the son Galliard. The father\nGalliard gave his daughter to Edward Danby: but first Mr. Hervey gave his\nniece to the elder.\n\nOne of the brides, I forget which, fainted away; another half-fainted--\nSaved by timely salts: the third, poor soul, wept heartily--as I suppose\nI shall do on Tuesday.\n\nNever surely was there such a matrimony promoter, as my brother. God\ngive me soon my revenge upon him in the same way!\n\nThe procession afterwards was triumphant--Six coaches, four silly souls\nin each; and to Mr. Poussin's, at Enfield, they all drove. There they\nfound another large company.\n\nMy brother was all cheerfulness; and both men and women seemed to contend\nfor his notice: but they were much disappointed at finding he meant to\nleave them early in the evening.\n\nOne married lady, the wife of Sir ---- somebody, (I am very bad at\nremembering the names of city knights,) was resolved, she said, since\nthey could not have Sir Charles to open the ball, to have one dance\nbefore dinner with the handsomest man in England. The music was\naccordingly called in; and he made no scruple to oblige the company on a\nday so happy.\n\nDo you know, Harriet, that Sir Charles is supposed to be one of the\nfinest dancers in England? Remember, my dear, that on Tuesday--[Lord\nhelp me! I shall be then stupid, and remember nothing]--you take him out\nyourself: and then you will judge for yourself of his excellence in this\nscience--May we not call dancing a science? If we judge by the few who\nperform gracefully in it, I am sure we may; and a difficult one too.\n\nO!--And remember, Harriet, that you get somebody to call upon him to\nsing--You shall play--I believe I shall forget, in that only agreeable\nmoment of the day, (for you have a sweet finger, my love,) that I am the\nprincipal fool in the play of the evening.\n\nO, Harriet,--how can I, in the circumstances I am in, write any more\nabout these soft souls, and silly? Come to me by day-dawn, and leave me\nnot till--I don't know when. Come, and take my part, my dear: I shall\nhate this man: he does nothing but hop, skip, and dance about me, grin\nand make mouths; and every body upholds him in it.\n\nMust this (I hope not!) be the last time that I write myself to you\n\nCHARLOTTE GRANDISON?\n\n\n\nLETTER XVII\n\nMISS BYRON, TO MISS SELBY\nST. JAMES'S-SQUARE, FRIDAY MORNING, APRIL 7.\n\n\nSir Charles Grandison set out early this morning for Lord W----'s, in his\nway to Lady Mansfield's. I am here with this whimsical Charlotte.\n\nLady L----, Miss Jervois, myself, and every female of the family, or who\ndo business for both sisters out of it, are busy in some way or other,\npreparatory to the approaching Tuesday.\n\nMiss Grandison is the only idle person. I tell her, she is affectedly\nso.\n\nThe earl has presented her, in his son's name, with some very rich\ntrinkets. Very valuable jewels are also bespoke by Lord G----, who takes\nLady L----'s advice in every thing; as one well read in the fashions.\nNew equipages are bespoke; and gay ones they will be.\n\nMiss Grandison confounded me this morning by an instance of her\ngenerosity. She was extremely urgent with me to accept, as her third\nsister, of her share of her mother's jewels. You may believe, that I\nabsolutely refused such a present. I was angry with her; and told her,\nshe had but one way of making it up with me; and that was, that since she\nwould be so completely set out from her lord, she would unite the two\nhalves, by presenting hers to Lady L----, who had refused jewels from her\nlord on her marriage; and who then would make an appearance,\noccasionally, as brilliant as her own.\n\nShe was pleased with the hint; and has actually given them (unknown to\nany body but me) to her jeweller; who is to dispose them in such figures,\nas shall answer those she herself is to have, which Lady L---- has not.\nAnd by this contrivance, which will make them in a manner useless to\nherself, she thinks she shall oblige her sister, however reluctant, to\naccept of them.\n\nLady Gertrude is also preparing some fine presents for her niece elect:\nbut neither the delighted approbation of the family she is entering into,\nnor the satisfaction expressed by her own friends, give the perverse\nCharlotte any visible joy, nor procure for Lord G---- the distinction\nwhich she ought to think of beginning to pay him. But, for his part,\nnever was man so happy. He would, however, perhaps, fare better from\nher, if he could be more moderate in the outward expression of his joy;\nwhich she has taken it into her head to call an insult upon her.\n\nShe does not, however, give the scope she did before the day was fixed,\nto her playful captiousness. She is not quite so arch as she was.\nThoughtfulness, and a seeming carelessness of what we are employed in,\nappear in her countenance. She saunters about, and affects to be\ndiverted by her harpsichord only. What a whimsical thing is Charlotte\nGrandison! But still she keeps Lord G---- at distance. I told her an\nhour ago, that she knows not how to condescend to him with that grace\nwhich is so natural to her in her whole behaviour to every body else.\n\nI have been talking to Dr. Bartlett, about Sir Charles's journey to\nItaly. Nobody knows, he says, what a bleeding heart is covered by a\ncountenance so benign and cheerful. Sir Charles Grandison, said he, has\na prudence beyond that of most young men; but he has great sensibilities.\n\nI take it for granted, sir, that he will for the future be more an\nItalian than Englishman.\n\nImpossible, madam! A prudent youth, by travelling, reaps this advantage\n--From what he sees of other countries, he learns to prefer his own. An\nimprudent one the contrary. Sir Charles's country is endeared to him by\nhis long absence from it. Italy in particular is called the garden of\nEurope; but it is rather to be valued for what it was, and might be, than\nwhat it is. I need not tell a lady who has read and conversed as you\nhave done, to what that incomparable difference is owing. Sir Charles\nGrandison is greatly sensible of it. He loves his country, with the\njudgment of a wise man; and wants not the partiality of a patriot.\n\nBut, doctor, he has offered, you know, to reside--There I stopt.\n\nTrue, madam--And he will not recede from his offers, if they are claimed.\nBut this uncertainty it is that disturbs him.\n\nI pity my patron, proceeded he. I have often told you he is not happy.\nWhat has indiscretion to expect, when discretion has so much to suffer?\nHis only consolation is, that he has nothing to reproach himself with.\nInevitable evils he bears as a man should. He makes no ostentation of\nhis piety: but, madam, Sir Charles Grandison is a CHRISTIAN.\n\nYou need not, sir, say more to me to exalt him: and, let me add, that I\nhave no small pleasure in knowing that Clementina is a lady of strict\npiety, though a Roman Catholic.\n\nAnd let me assure you, madam, that Sir Charles's regard for Miss Byron\n(his more than regard for her, why should I not say? since every body\nsees it) is founded upon her piety, and upon the amiable qualities of her\nmind. Beauty, madam, is an accidental and transient good. No man better\nknows how to distinguish between admiration and love, than my patron.\nHis virtue is virtue upon full proof, and against sensibilities, that it\nis heroic to overcome. Lady Olivia knows this: and here I must\nacknowledge myself a debtor to you for three articles out of your ten. I\nhope soon to discharge the obligation.\n\nYour own time, doctor: but I must say, that whenever you give me Lady\nOlivia's story, I shall be pained, if I find that a Clementina is\nconsidered by a beauty of an unhappier turn, as her rival in the love of\nSir Charles Grandison.\n\nLady Olivia, madam, admires him for his virtue; but she cannot, as he has\nmade it his study to do, divide admiration from love. What offers has\nshe not refused?--But she declares, that she had rather be the friend of\nSir Charles Grandison, than the wife of the greatest prince on earth.\n\nThis struck me: Have not I said something like it? But surely with\ninnocence of heart. But here the doctor suggests, that Olivia has put\nhis virtue to the proof: Yet I hope not.\n\nThe FRIEND, Dr. Bartlett!--I hope that no woman who is not quite given up\nto dishonour, will pollute the sacred word, by affixing ideas to it, that\ncannot be connected with it. A friend is one of the highest characters\nthat one human creature can shine in to another. There may be love, that\nthough it has no view but to honour, yet even in wedlock, ripens not into\nfriendship. How poor are all such attachments! How much beneath the\nexalted notion I have of that noblest, that most delicate union of souls!\nYou wonder at me, Dr. Bartlett. Let me repeat to you, sir, (I have it by\nheart,) Sir Charles Grandison's tender of friendship to the poor Harriet\nByron, which has given me such exalted ideas of this disinterested\npassion; but you must not take notice that I have. I repeated those\nwords, beginning, 'My heart demands alliance with hers'--and ending with\nthese--'So long as it shall be consistent with her other attachments.'*\n\n\n* See page 110 of this Volume.\n\n\nThe doctor was silent for a few moments. At last, What a delicacy is\nthere in the mind of this excellent man! Yet how consistent with the\nexactest truth! The friendship he offers you, madam, is indeed\nfriendship. What you have repeated can want no explanation: yet it is\nexpressive of his uncertain situation. It is--\n\nHe stopt of a sudden.\n\nPray, doctor, proceed: I love to hear you talk.\n\nMy good young lady!--I may say too much. Sir Charles in these nice\npoints must be left to himself. It is impossible for any body to express\nhis thoughts as he can express them. But let me say, that he justly, as\nwell as greatly, admires Miss Byron.\n\nMy heart rose against myself. Bold Harriet, thought I, how darest thou\nthus urge a good man to say more than he has a mind to say of the secrets\nof a friend, which are committed to his keeping? Content thyself with\nthe hopes, that the worthiest man in the world would wish to call thee\nhis, were it not for an invincible obstacle. And noble, thrice noble\nClementina, be thine the preference even in the heart of Harriet Byron,\nbecause justice gives it to thee; for, Harriet, hast thou not been taught\nto prefer right and justice to every other consideration? And, wouldst\nthou abhor the thought of a common theft, yet steal an heart that is the\nproperty, and that by the dearest purchase, of another?\n\n\n\nLETTER XVIII\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nFRIDAY EVENING.\n\n\nWe have had a great debate about the place in which the nuptial ceremony\nis to be performed.\n\nCharlotte, the perverse Charlotte, insisted upon not going to church.\n\nLord G---- dared not to give his opinion; though his father and Lady\nGertrude, as well as every other person, were against her.\n\nLord L---- said, that if fine ladies thought so slightly of the office,\nas that it might be performed anywhere, it would be no wonder, if fine\ngentlemen thought still more slightly of the obligation it laid them\nunder.\n\nBeing appealed to, I said, that I thought of marriage as one of the most\nsolemn acts of a woman's life.\n\nAnd if of a woman's, of a man's, surely, interrupted Lady L----. If your\nwhimsey, Charlotte, added she, arises from modesty, you reflect upon your\nsister; and, what is worse, upon your mother.\n\nCharlotte put up her pretty lip, and was unconvinced.\n\nLady Gertrude laid a heavy hand upon the affectation; yet admires her\nniece-elect. She distinguished between chamber-vows and church-vows.\nShe mentioned the word decency. She spoke plainer, on Charlotte's\nunfeeling perverseness. If a bride meant a compliment by it to the\nbridegroom, that was another thing; but then let her declare as much; and\nthat she was in an hurry to oblige him.\n\nCharlotte attempted to kill her by a look--She gave a worse to Lord\nG----. And why, whispered she to him, as he sat next her, must thou shew\nall thy teeth, man?--As Lady Gertrude meant to shame her, I thought I\ncould as soon forgive that lady, as her who was the occasion of the\nfreedom of speech.\n\nBut still she was perverse: she would not be married at all, she said, if\nshe were not complied with.\n\nI whispered her, as I sat on the other side of her, I wish, Charlotte,\nthe knot were tied: till then, you will not do even right things, but in\na wrong manner.\n\nDr. Bartlett was not present: he was making a kind visit to my cousins\nReeves. When he came in, the debate was referred to him. He entered\ninto it with her, with so much modesty, good sense, propriety, and\nsteadiness, that at last the perverse creature gave way: but hardly would\nneither, had he not assured her, that her brother would be entirely\nagainst her; and that he himself must be excused performing the sacred\noffice, but in a sacred place. She has set her heart on the doctor's\nmarrying her.\n\nThe Earl of G---- and Lady Gertrude, as also Lord and Lady L----, went\naway, not dissatisfied with Charlotte's compliance: she is the most\nungraciously graceful young woman I ever knew in her compliances. But\nLord G---- was to pay for all: she and I had got together in the study:\nin bolted Lord G----, perhaps with too little ceremony. She coloured--\nHey-day, sir! Who expected you? His countenance immediately fell. He\nwithdrew precipitately. Fie, Charlotte! said I, recollect yourself--and\nrising, stept to the door, My lord--calling after him.\n\nHe came back; but in a little ferment--I hoped, I hoped, madam, as you\nwere not in your own apartment, that I might, that I might have been--\n\nWherever ladies are by themselves, it is a lady's apartment, my lord,\nsaid she, with a haughtiness that sat better on her features, than they\nwould upon almost any other woman's.\n\nHe looked, as if he knew not whether he should stay or go. Sit down, my\nlord, said I; we are not particularly engaged. He came nearer, his hat\nunder his arm, bowing to her, who sat as stately as a princess on her\nthrone: but yet looked disobliged. You give yourself pretty airs, my\nlord--don't you?\n\nPretty airs, madam!--Pretty airs!--By my soul, I think, madam--And with\nsuch a glow in your face, madam--Taking his laced hat from under his arm,\nand, with an earnest motion, swinging it backwards and forwards, as\nunknowing what he did--\n\nWhat, sir, am I to be buffetted, sir?--\n\nHe put his hat under his arm again--Buffetted, madam!--Would to\nHeaven--\n\nWhat has Heaven to do with your odd ways, Lord G----?\n\nI beg pardon for intruding, madam--But I thought--\n\nThat you had a privilege, sir--But marriage itself, sir, shall not give\nyou a privilege to break into my retirements. You thought, sir--You\ncould not think--So much the worse if you did--\n\nIf I have really offended--I will be more circumspect for the future--I\nbeg pardon, madam--Miss Byron, I hope, will forgive me too.\n\nHe was going, in great discomposure, and with an air of angry humility.\n\nCharlotte, whispered I, don't be silly--\n\nCome, come, now you have broke in upon us, you may stay--But another\ntime, when you know me to be retired with a friend so dear to me, let it\nenter into your head, that no third person, unsent for, can be welcome.\n\nPoor man!--How he loves her!--His countenance changed at once to the\nhumble placid: he looked as if he had rather be in fault than she.\n\nOh! how little did she make him look!\n\nBut he has often, as well as in this instance, let her see her power over\nhim. I am afraid she will use it. I now see it is and will be his\nmisfortune that she can vex him without being vexed herself: and what may\nhe expect, who can be treated with feigned displeasure, which, while it\nseems to be in earnest to him, will be a jest to his wife?\n\nI was very angry with her, when we were alone; and told her, that she\nwould be an enemy, I was afraid, of her own happiness. But she only\nlaughed at me: Happiness, my dear! said she: that only is happiness which\nwe think so. If I can be as happy in my way, as you can be in yours,\nshall I not pursue it? Your happiness, child, is in the still life. I\nlove not a dead calm: now a tempest, now a refreshing breeze, I shall\nknow how to enjoy the difference--My brother will not be here to turn\njest into earnest; as might perhaps be the effect of his mediation--But,\nheigh-ho, Harriet! that the first week were over, and I had got into my\nthrone!\n\nShe ended with an Italian air, contrasted with another heigh-ho; and left\nme for a few moments.\n\nPoor Lord G----! said I, looking after her.\n\nShe returned soon. Poor Lord G----! repeated she: those were the piteous\nwords you threw after me--But if I should provoke him, do you think he\nwould not give me a cuff, or so?--You know he can't return joke for joke;\nand he must revenge himself some way--If that should be the case, Poor\nCharlotte, I hope you would say--\n\nNot if you deserved it.\n\nDeserve a cuff, Harriet!--Well, but I am afraid I shall.\n\nRemember next Tuesday, Charlotte!--You must vow obedience--Will you break\nyour vow?--This is not a jesting matter.\n\nTrue, Harriet. And that it is not, was perhaps one of the reasons that\nmade me disinclined to go to so solemn a place as the church with Lord\nG----. Don't you think it one with those who insist upon being married\nin their own chamber?\n\nI believe great people, said I, think they must not do right things in\nthe common way: that seems to me to be one of their fantastic reasons:\nbut the vow is the vow, Charlotte: God is every where.\n\nNow you are so serious, Harriet, it is time to have done with the\nsubject.\n\n\nI have no sleep in my eyes; and must go on. What keeps me more wakeful\nis, my real concern for this naughty Miss Grandison, and my pity for Lord\nG----; for the instance I have given you of her petulance is nothing to\nwhat I have seen: but I thought, so near the day, she would have changed\nher behaviour to him. Surely, the situation her brother is in, without\nany fault of his own, might convince her, that she need not go out of her\npath to pick up subjects for unhappiness.\n\nSuch a kittenish disposition in her, I called it; for it is not so much\nthe love of power that predominates in her mind, as the love of\nplayfulness: and when the fit is upon her, she regards not whether it is\na china cup, or a cork, that she pats and tosses about. But her sport\nwill certainly be the death of Lord G----'s happiness. Pity that Sir\nCharles, who only has power over her, is obliged to go abroad so soon!\nBut she has principles: Lady Grandison's daughter, Sir Charles\nGrandison's sister, must have principles. The solemnity of the occasion;\nthe office; the church; the altar;--must strike her: The vow--Will she\nnot regard the vow she makes in circumstances so awful? Could but my\nLord G---- assume dignity, and mingle raillery with it, and be able to\nlaugh with her, and sometimes at her, she would not make him her sport:\nshe would find somebody else: A butt she must have to shoot at: but I am\nafraid he will be too sensible of her smartness: and she will have her\njest, let who will suffer by it.\n\nSome of the contents of your last are very agreeable to me, Lucy. I will\nbegin in earnest to think of leaving London. Don't let me look silly in\nyour eyes, my dear, when I come. It was not so very presumptuous in me\n(was it?) to hope--When all his relations--When he himself--Yet what room\nfor hope did he, could he, give me? He was honest; and I cheated myself:\nbut then all you, my dearest friends, encouraged the cheat: nay, pointed\nmy wishes, and my hopes, by yours, before I had dared (shall I say, or\ncondescended?) to own them to myself.\n\nYou may let that Greville know, if you please, that there is no room for\nhis If's, nor, of consequence, any for his menaces. You may own, that I\nshall soon be in Northamptonshire. This may prevent his and Fenwick's\nthreatened journey to town.\n\nBut, Lucy, though my heart has been ever dutifully, as I may say, open to\nthe venerable domestic circle; though it would not have been an honest\nheart, could it, circumstanced as I was, have concealed itself from Lady\nD----; and must have been an impenetrable one indeed, if it could have\nbeen disguised to the two sisters here--yet, I beseech you, my dear,\nalmost on my knees I beseech you, let not the audacious, the insulting\nGreville, have ground given him to suspect a weakness in your Harriet,\nwhich indelicate minds know not how to judge of delicately. For\nsex-sake, for example-sake, Lucy, let it not be known, to any but the\npartial, friendly few, that our grand-mamma Shirley's child, and aunt\nSelby's niece, has been a volunteer in her affections. How many still\nmore forward girls would plead Mrs. Shirley's approbation of the hasty\naffection, without considering the circumstances, and the object! So the\nnext girl that run away to a dancing-master, or an ensign, would reckon\nherself one of Harriet's school.\n\nPoor Mr. Orme! I am sorry he is not well. It is cruel in you, Lucy, at\nthis time, to say, (so undoubtingly,) that his illness is owing to his\nlove of me. You knew that such a suggestion would pain me. Heaven\nrestore Mr. Orme!\n\nBut I am vexed, as it cannot be to purpose, that Sir Charles Grandison\nand I have been named together, and talked of, in your neighbourhood!--He\nwill be gone abroad. I shall return to Northamptonshire: and shall look\nso silly! So like a refused girl!\n\n'Every body gives me to him, you say'--So much the worse. I wonder what\nbusiness this every body has to trouble itself about me.\n\nOne consolation, however, I shall have in my return; and that is, in my\nNancy's recovered health; which was so precarious when I set out for\nLondon.\n\nBut I shall have nothing to entertain you with when I am with you: Sir\nCharles Grandison, Lord and Lady L----, Lady G----, (as now in three or\nfour days she will be), my dear Miss Jervois, Dr. Bartlett, will be all\nmy subject. And have I not exhausted that by pen and ink? O no! The\ndoctor promises to correspond with me; and he makes no doubt but Sir\nCharles will correspond with him, as usual.\n\nWhat can the unusually tender friendship be called which he professed for\nme, and, as I may say, claimed in return from me? I know that he has no\nnotion of the love called Platonic. Nor have I: I think it, in general,\na dangerous allowance; and, with regard to our sex, a very unequal one;\nsince, while the man has nothing to fear, the woman has every thing, from\nthe privileges that may be claimed, in an acknowledged confidence,\nespecially in presence. Miss Grandison thus interprets what he said, and\nstrengthens her opinion by some of Dr. Bartlett's late intimations, that\nhe really loves me; but not being at liberty to avow his love, he knew\nnot what to say; and so went as near to a declaration as was possible to\ndo in his circumstances.\n\nBut might I not expect, from such a profession of friendship in Sir\nCharles, an offer of correspondence in absence? And if he made the\noffer, ought I to decline it? Would it not indicate too much on my side,\nwere I to do so?--And does it not on his, if he make not the offer? He\ncorresponds with Mrs. Beaumont: nobody thinks that any thing can be meant\nby that correspondence on either side; because Mrs. Beaumont must be at\nleast forty; Sir Charles but six or seven and twenty: but if he makes not\nthe request to Harriet, who is but little more than twenty; what, after\nsuch professions of a friendship so tender, will be inferred from his\nforbearance?\n\nBut I shall puzzle myself, and you too, Lucy, if I go on with this sort\nof reasoning; because I shall not know how to put all I mean into words.\nHave I not already puzzled you? I think my expression is weak and\nperplexed--But this offered and accepted friendship between two persons\nnot indelicate, must be perplexing; since he is the only young man in the\nworld, from whom a woman has no dishonour to fear.--Ah, Lucy!--It would\nbe vanity in me, would it not? to suppose that he had more to fear from\nHarriet, than she has from him; as the virtue of either, I hope, is not\nquestionable? But the event of his Italian visit will explain and\nreconcile every thing.\n\nI will encourage a drowsy fit that seems to be stealing upon me. If I\nhave not written with the perspicuity I always aim at, allow, Lucy, for\nthe time of night; for spirits not high; and for the subject, that having\nits delicacies, as well as uncertainties, I am not able to write clearly\nupon it.\n\n\n\nLETTER XIX\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nSATURDAY NIGHT, APRIL 9.\n\n\nSir Charles is already returned: he arrived at Windsor on Friday morning;\nbut found that Lord W---- had set out the afternoon of the day before,\nfor the house of his friend Sir Joseph Lawrence, which is but fifteen\nmiles from Mansfield-house.\n\nUpon this intelligence, Sir Charles, wanting to return to town as soon as\nhe could, followed him to the knight's: and having time enough himself to\nreach Mansfield-house that night, he, by his uncle's consent, pursued his\njourney thither; to the great joy of the family; who wished for his\npersonal introduction of my lord to Miss Mansfield.\n\nMy lord arrived by breakfast-time, unfatigued, and in high spirits: staid\nat Mansfield-house all day; and promised so to manage, as to be in town\nto-morrow, in order to be present at his niece's nuptials on Tuesday.\n\nAs for Sir Charles, he made the Mansfield family happy in his company the\nwhole Friday evening; inquiring into their affairs relating to the\noppression they lay under; pointing out measures for redress; encouraging\nMiss Mansfield; and informing the brothers, that the lawyers he had\nconsulted on their deeds, told him, that a new trial might be hoped for;\nthe result of which, probably, would be a means to do them justice, so\npowerfully protected and assisted as they would now be; for new lights\nhad broke in upon them, and they wanted but to recover a deed, which they\nunderstood was in the hands of two gentlemen, named Hartley, who were but\nlately returned from the Indies. Thus prepared, the Mansfields also were\nin high spirits, the next morning; and looked, Sir Charles said, on each\nother, when they met, as if they wanted to tell each other their\nagreeable dreams.\n\nSir Charles, in his way, had looked in upon Sir Harry Beauchamp, and his\nlady. He found Sir Harry in high spirits, expecting the arrival of his\nson; who was actually landed from Calais, having met there his father's\nletter, allowing him to return to England, and wishing in his own, and in\nLady Beauchamp's name, his speedy arrival.\n\nSir Charles's impatience to see his friend, permitted him only to\nbreakfast with my lord and the Mansfields; and to know the opinion each\nparty formed of the other, on this first interview; and then he set out\nto Sir Harry Beauchamp's. What an activity!--Heaven reward him with the\ngrant of his own wishes, whatever they be, and make him the happiest of\nmen!\n\nMy lord is greatly taken with the lady, and her whole family. Well he\nmay, Sir Charles says. He blessed him, and called himself blessed in his\nsister's son, for his recommendation of each to the other. The lady\nthinks better of him, as her mother owned to Sir Charles, than she\nthought she should, from report.\n\nI begin to think, Lucy, that those who set out for happiness are most\nlikely to find it, when they live single till the age of fancy is over.\nThose who marry while it lasts, are often disappointed of that which they\npropose so largely to themselves: while those who wed for convenience,\nand deal with tolerable honesty by each other, are at a greater\ncertainty. Tolerable, I repeat, since, it seems, we are to expect that\nboth parties will turn the best side of the old garment outward. Hence\narises consolation to old maidens, and cautions against precipitation--\nExpatiate, my dear, on this fruitful subject: I would, were I at leisure.\n\nSir Charles says that he doubts not, but Lord W---- will be as happy a\nman as he wishes to be, in less than a month.\n\nThe deuse is in this brother of mine, whispered Miss Grandison, to me,\nfor huddling up of marriages! He don't consider, that there may be two\nchances for one, that his honest folks may in half a year's time, bless\nhim the contrary way.\n\nSir Charles told us, that he had desired Lord W---- to give out every\nwhere (that the adversaries of the Mansfield family might know it) his\nintended alliance; and that he and his nephew were both determined to\nprocure a retrospection of all former proceedings.\n\nSir Charles got to Sir Harry Beauchamp's a little before his friend\narrived. Sir Harry took him aside at his alighting, and told him, that\nLady Beauchamp had had clouds on her brow all the day, and he was afraid,\nwould not receive his son with the graciousness that once he hoped for\nfrom her: but, that he left him to manage with her. She never, said he,\nhad so high an opinion either of man or woman as she has of you.\n\nSir Charles addressed himself to her, as not doubting her goodness upon\nthe foot of their former conversation; and praised her for the graces\nthat however appeared but faintly in her countenance, till his\ncompliments lighted them up, and made them shine full out in it. He told\nher, that his sister and Lord G---- were to be married on the following\nTuesday. He himself, he said, should set out for Paris on Friday after:\nbut hoped to see a family intimacy begun between his sisters and Lady\nBeauchamp; and between their lords, and Sir Harry, and Mr. Beauchamp. He\napplauded her on the generosity of her intentions, as declared to him in\ntheir former conference; and congratulated her on the power she had, of\nwhich she made so noble an use, of laying, at the same time, an\nobligation on the tenderest of husbands, and the most deserving of sons:\nwhose duty to her he engaged for.\n\nAll this set her in high good humour; and she took to herself, and\nbridled upon it, to express myself in Charlotte's manner, the praises and\ngraces this adroit manager gave her, as if they were her unquestionable\ndue.\n\nThis agreeable way they were all in, Sir Harry transported with his\nlady's goodness, when Mr. Beauchamp arrived.\n\nThe young gentleman bent his knee to his stepmother, as well as to his\nfather, and thanked her for the high favours his father had signified to\nhim by letter, that he owed to her goodness. She confirmed them; but,\nSir Charles observed, with an ostentation that shewed she thought very\nhighly of her own generosity.\n\nThey had a very cheerful evening. Not one cloud would hang on Lady\nBeauchamp's brow, though once or twice it seemed a little overshadowed,\nas Mr. Beauchamp displayed qualities for which his father was too ready\nto admire him. Sir Charles thought it necessary to caution Sir Harry on\nthis subject; putting it in this light, that Lady Beauchamp loved her\nhusband so well, that she would be too likely to dread a rivalry in his\naffections from a son so very accomplished. Sir Harry took the hint\nkindly.\n\nMr. Beauchamp was under a good deal of concern at Sir Charles's\nengagements to leave England so soon after his arrival; and asked his\nfather's leave to attend him. Sir Harry declared, that he could not part\nwith him. Sir Charles chid his friend, and said, it was not quite so\nhandsome a return as might have been expected from his Beauchamp, to the\njoyful reception he had met with from his father, and Lady Beauchamp.\nBut she excused the young gentleman, and said, she wondered not, that\nany body who was favoured with his friendship, should be unwilling to be\nseparated from him.\n\nSir Charles expresses great satisfaction in Mr. Beauchamp's being arrived\nbefore his departure, that he may present to us, himself, a man with whom\nhe is sure we shall all be delighted, and leave him happy in the beloved\nsociety which he himself is obliged to quit.\n\nA repining temper, Lucy, would consider only the hardship of meeting a\nlong-absent friend, just to feel the uneasiness of a second parting: but\nthis man views every thing in a right light. When his own happiness is\nnot to be attained, he lays it out of his thoughts, and, as I have\nheretofore observed, rejoices in that of others. It is a pleasure to see\nhow Sir Charles seems to enjoy the love which Dr. Bartlett expresses for\nthis friend of them both.\n\nSir Charles addressed himself to me, on several occasions, in so polite,\nin so tender a manner, that every one told me afterwards, they are sure\nhe loves me. Dr. Bartlett at the time, as he sat next me, whispered, on\nthe regret expressed by all on losing him so soon--Ah, madam!--I know,\nand pity, my patron's struggles!--Struggles, Lucy! What could the doctor\nmean by this whisper to me? But I hope he guesses not at mine! If he\ndoes, would he have whispered his pity of Sir Charles to me?--Come, Lucy,\nthis is some comfort, however; and I will endeavour to be brave upon it,\nthat I may not, by my weakness, lessen myself in the doctor's good\nopinion.\n\nIt was agreed for Charlotte, (whose assent was given in these words--'Do\nas you will--or, rather, as my brother will--What signifies opposing\nhim?') that the nuptials shall be solemnized, as privately as possible,\nat St. George's church. The company is to drop in at different doors,\nand with as few attendants as may be. Lord W----, the Earl of G----, and\nLady Gertrude, Lord and Lady L----, Miss Jervois, and your Harriet, are\nto be present at the ceremony. I was very earnest to be excused, till\nMiss Grandison, when we were alone, dropt down on one knee, and held up\nher hands, to beg me to accompany her. Mr. Everard Grandison, if he can\nbe found, is to be also there, at Sir Charles's desire.\n\nDr. Bartlett, as I before hinted, at her earnest request, is to perform\nthe ceremony. Sir Charles wished it to be at his own parish-church: but\nMiss Grandison thought it too near to be private. He was indifferent, as\nto the place, he said--So it was at church; for he had been told of the\ndifficulty we had to get Charlotte to desist from having it performed in\nher chamber; and seemed surprised.--Fie, Charlotte! said he--An office so\nsolemn!--Vows to receive and pay, as in the Divine Presence--\n\nShe was glad, she told me, that she had not left that battle to be fought\nwith him.\n\n\nMONDAY, APRIL 10.\n\nLord W---- is come. Lord and Lady L---- are here. They, and Miss\nGrandison, received him with great respect. He embraced his nieces in a\nvery affectionate manner. Sir Charles was absent. Lord W---- is in\nperson and behaviour a much more agreeable man than I expected him to be.\nNor is he so decrepit with the gout, as I had supposed. He is very\ncareful of himself, it seems. This world has been kind to him; and I\nfancy he makes a great deal of a little pain, for want of stronger\nexercises to his patience; and so is a sufferer by self-indulgence. Had\nI not been made acquainted with his free living, and with the insults he\nbore from Mrs. Giffard, with a spirit so poor and so low, I should have\nbelieved I saw not only the man of quality, but the man of sense, in his\ncountenance. I endeavoured, however, as much as I could, to look upon\nhim as the brother of the late Lady Grandison. Had he been worthy of\nthat relation, how should I have reverenced him!\n\nBut whatever I thought of him, he was highly taken with me. He\nparticularly praised me for the modesty which he said was visible in my\ncountenance. Free-livers, Lucy, taken with that grace in a woman, which\nthey make it their pride to destroy! But all men, good and bad, admire\nmodesty in a woman: And I am sometimes out of humour with our sex, that\nthey do not as generally like modesty in men. I am sure that this grace,\nin Sir Charles Grandison, is one of his principal glories with me. It\nemboldens one's heart, and permits one to behave before him with ease;\nand, as I may say, with security, in the consciousness of a right\nintention.\n\nBut what were Lord W----'s praises of his nephew! He called him, the\nglory of his sex, and of human nature. How the cheeks of the dear Emily\nglowed at the praises given to her guardian!--She was the taller for\nthem: when she moved, it was on tiptoe; stealing as it were, across the\nfloor, lest she should lose any thing that was said on a subject so\ndelightful to her.\n\nMy lord was greatly pleased with her too. He complimented her as the\nbeloved ward of the best of guardians. He lamented, with us, the\noccasion that called his nephew abroad. He was full of his own\nengagements with Miss Mansfield, and declared that his nephew should\nguide and govern him as he pleased in every material case, respecting\neither the conduct of his future life, or the management and disposition\nof his estate; declaring, that he had made his will, and, reserving only\nhis lady's jointure, and a few legacies, had left every thing to him.\n\nHow right a thing, even in policy, is it, my dear, to be good and\ngenerous.\n\nI must not forget, that my lord wished with all his soul, that was his\nexpression, that he might have the honour of giving to his nephew my hand\nin marriage.\n\nI could feel myself blush. I half-suppressed a sigh: I would have wholly\nsuppressed it, if I could. I recovered the little confusion, his too\nplainly expressed wish gave me, by repeating to myself the word CLEMENTINA.\n\nThis Charlotte is a great coward. But I dare not tell her so, for fear\nof a retort. I believe I should be as great a one in her circumstances,\nso few hours to one of the greatest events of one's life! But I pretend\nnot to bravery: yet hope, that in the cause of virtue or honour I should\nbe found to have a soul.\n\nI write now at my cousin's. I came hither to make an alteration in my\ndress. I have promised to be with the sweet Bully early in the morning\nof her important day.\n\n\n\nLETTER XX\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nTUESDAY NIGHT,    | APRIL 11, 12.\nWEDNESDAY MORNING,|\n\n\nMiss Grandison is no longer to be called by that name. She is Lady\nG----. May she make Lord G---- as happy as I dare say he will make her,\nif it be not her own fault!\n\nI was early with her, according to promise. I found her more affected\nthan she was even last night with her approaching change of condition.\nHer brother had been talking to her, she said; and had laid down the\nduties of the state she was about to enter into, in such a serious\nmanner, and made the performance of them of so much importance to her\nhappiness both here and hereafter, that she was terrified at the thoughts\nof what she was about to undertake. She had never considered matrimony\nin that formidable light before. He had told her, that he was afraid of\nher vivacity; yet was loath to discourage her cheerfulness, or to say\nany thing that should lower her spirits. All he besought of her was, to\nregard times, tempers, and occasions; and then it would be impossible but\nher lively humour must give delight not only to the man whom she favoured\nwith her hand, but to every one who had the pleasure of approaching her.\nIf, Charlotte, said he, you would have the world around you respect your\nhusband, you must set the example. While the wife gives the least room\nto suspect, that she despises her husband, she will find that she\nsubjects him to double contempt, if he resents it not; and if he does,\ncan you be happy? Aggressors lay themselves open to severe reprisals.\nIf you differ, you will be apt to make by-standers judges over you. They\nwill remember, when you are willing to forget; and your fame will be the\nsport of those beneath you, as well in understanding as degree.\n\nShe believed, she told me, that Lord G---- had been making some\ncomplaints of her. If he had--\n\nHush, my dear, said I--Not one word of threatening: are you more\nsolicitous to conceal your fault, than to amend it?\n\nNo--But you know, Harriet, for a man, before he has experienced what sort\nof a wife I shall make, to complain against me for foibles in courtship,\nwhen he can help himself if he will, has something so very little--\n\nYour conscience, Charlotte, tells you, that he had reason for complaint;\nand therefore you think he has complained. Think the best of Lord G----\nfor your own reputation's sake, since you thought fit to go thus far with\nhim. You have borne nothing from him: he has borne a great deal from\nyou.\n\nI am fretful, Harriet; I won't be chidden: I will be comforted by you:\nyou shall sooth me: are you not my sister? She threw her arms round me,\nand kissed my cheek.\n\nI ventured to rally her, though I was afraid of her retort, and met with\nit: but I thought it would divert her. I am glad, my dear, said I, that\nyou are capable of this tenderness of temper: you blustering girls--But\nfear, I believe, will make cowards loving.\n\nHarriet, said she, and flung from me to the window, remember this: may I\nsoon see you in the same situation! I will then have no mercy upon you.\n\n\nThe subject, which Sir Charles led to at breakfast, was the three\nweddings of Thursday last. He spoke honourably of marriage, and made\nsome just compliments to Lord and Lady L----; concluding them with\nwishes, that his sister Charlotte and Lord G---- might be neither more\nnor less happy than they were. Then turning to Lord W----, he said, he\nquestioned not his lordship's happiness with the lady he had so lately\nseen; for I cannot doubt, said he, of your lordship's affectionate\ngratitude to her, if she behaves, as I am sure she will.\n\nMy lord had tears in his eyes. Never man had such a nephew as I have,\nsaid he. All the joy of my present prospects, all the comforts of my\nfuture life, are and will be owing to you.\n\nHere had he stopt, it would have been well: but turning to me, he\nunexpectedly said, Would to God, madam, that you could reward him! I\ncannot; and nobody else can.\n\nAll were alarmed for me; every eye was upon me. A sickishness came over\nmy heart--I know not how to describe it. My head sunk upon my bosom. I\ncould hardly sit; yet was less able to rise.\n\nSir Charles's face was overspread with blushes. He bowed to my lord.\nMay the man, said he, who shall have the honour to call Miss Byron his,\nbe, if possible, as deserving as she is! Then will they live together\nthe life of angels.\n\nHe gracefully looked down; not at me; and I got a little courage to look\nup: yet Lady L---- was concerned for me: so was Lord L----: Emily's eye\ndropt a tear upon her blushing cheek.\n\nWas it not, Lucy, a severe trial?--Indeed it was.\n\nMy Lord, to mend the matter, lamented very pathetically, that Sir Charles\nwas under an obligation to go abroad; and still more, that he could not\nstay to be present at the celebration of his nuptials with Miss\nMansfield.\n\nThe Earl, Lord G----, Lady Gertrude, and the doctor, were to meet the\nbride and us at church. Lord and Lady L----, Sir Charles, and Emily,\nwent in one coach: Miss Grandison and I in another.\n\nAs we went, I don't like this affair at all, Harriet, said she. My\nbrother has long made all other men indifferent to me. Such an infinite\ndifference!\n\nCan any body be happier than Lord and Lady L----, Charlotte? Yet Lady\nL---- admires her brother as much as you can do.\n\nThey happy!--And so they are. But Lady L----, soft soul! fell in love\nwith Lord L---- before my brother came over. So the foundation was laid:\nand it being a first flame with her, she, in compliment to herself, could\nnot but persevere. But the sorry creature Anderson, proving a sorry\ncreature, made me despise the sex: and my brother's perfections\ncontributed to my contempt of all other men.\n\nIndeed, my dear, you are wrong. Lord G---- loves you: but were Sir\nCharles not your brother, it is not very certain, that he would have\nreturned your love.\n\nWhy, that's true. I believe he would not, in that case, have chosen me.\nI am sure he would not, if he had known you: but for the man one loves,\none can do any thing, be every thing, that he would wish one to be.\n\nDo you think you cannot love Lord G----? For Heaven's sake, Charlotte,\nthough you are now almost within sight of the church, do not think of\ngiving your hand, if you cannot resolve to make Lord G---- as happy, as I\nhave no doubt he will make you, if it be not your own fault.\n\nWhat will my brother say? What will--\n\nLeave that to me. I will engage Sir Charles and Dr. Bartlett to lend me\ntheir ear in the vestry; and I am sure your brother, if he knows that you\nhave an antipathy to Lord G----, or that you think you cannot be happy\nwith him, will undertake your cause, and bring you off.\n\nAntipathy! That's a strong word, Harriet. The man is a good-natured\nsilly man--\n\nSilly! Charlotte!--Silly then he must be for loving you so well, who,\nreally, have never yet given him an opportunity to shew his importance\nwith you.\n\nI do pity him sometimes.\n\nThe coach stopt:--Ah, Lord! Harriet! The church! The church!\n\nSay, Charlotte, before you step out--Shall I speak to your brother, and\nDr. Bartlett, in the vestry?\n\nI shall look like a fool either way.\n\nDon't act like one, Charlotte, on this solemn occasion. Say, you will\ndeserve, that you will try to deserve, Lord G----'s love.\n\nSir Charles appeared. Lord help me!--My brother!--I'll try, I'll try,\nwhat can be done.\n\nHe gave each his hand in turn: in we flew: the people began to gather\nabout us. Lord G---- all rapture, received her at the entrance. Sir\nCharles led me: and the Earl and Lady Gertrude received us with joy in\ntheir countenances. I overheard the naughty one say, as Lord G---- led\nher up to the altar, You don't know what you are about, man. I expect to\nhave all my way: remember that's one of my articles before marriage.\n\nHe returned her an answer of fond assent to her condition. I am afraid,\nthought I, poor Lord G----, you will be more than once reminded of this\nprevious article.\n\nWhen she was led to the altar, and Lord G---- and she stood together, she\ntrembled. Leave me not, Harriet, said she.--Brother! Lady L----!\n\nI am sure she looked sillier than Lord G---- at that instant.\n\nThe good doctor began the office. No dearly beloveds, Harriet! whispered\nshe, as I had said, on a really terrible occasion. I was offended with\nher in my heart: again she whispered something against the office, as the\ndoctor proceeded to give the reasons for the institution. Her levity did\nnot forsake her even at that solemn moment.\n\nWhen the service was over, every one (Sir Charles in a solemn and most\naffectionate manner) wished her happy. My Lord G---- kissed her hand\nwith a bent knee.\n\nShe took my hand. Ah! Lord, what have I done?--And am I married?\nwhispered she--And can it never be undone?--And is that the man, to whom\nI am to be obedient?--Is he to be my lord and master?\n\nAh, Lady G----, said I, it is a solemn office. You have vowed: he has\nvowed.--It is a solemn office.\n\nLord G---- led her to the first coach. Sir Charles led me into the same.\nThe people, to my great confusion, whispered. That's the bride! What a\ncharming couple! Sir Charles handed Miss Emily next. Lord G---- came\nin: as he was entering, Harkee, friend, said Charlotte, and put out her\nhand, you mistake the coach: you are not of our company.\n\nThe whole world, replied my lord, shall not now divide us: and took his\nseat on the same side with Emily.\n\nThe man's a rogue, Harriet, whispered she: See! He gives himself airs\nalready!\n\nThis, said Lord G---- as the coach drove on, taking one hand, and eagerly\nkissing it, is the hand that blessed me.\n\nAnd that, said she, pushing him from her with the other, is the hand that\nrepulses your forwardness. What came you in here for?--Don't be silly.\n\nHe was in raptures all the way.\n\nWhen we came home, every one embraced and wished joy to the bride. The\nEarl and Lady Gertrude were in high spirits. The lady re-saluted her\nniece, as her dear niece: the earl recognised his beloved daughter.\n\nBut prepare to hear a noble action of Lord W----.\n\nWhen he came up to compliment her--My dearest niece, said he, I wish you\njoy with all my soul. I have not been a kind uncle. There is no\nfastening any thing on your brother. Accept of this: [and he put a\nlittle paper into her hand--It was a banknote of 1,000\u00c2\u00a3.:] My sister's\ndaughter, and your brother's sister, merits more than this.\n\nWas not this handsomely presented, Lucy?\n\nHe then, in a manner becoming Lady Grandison's brother, stept to Lady\nL----. My niece Charlotte is not my only niece. I wish you, my dear, as\nif this was your day of marriage, all happiness; accept these two papers:\n[The one, Lucy, was a note for 1,000\u00c2\u00a3. and the other for 100\u00c2\u00a3.:] and he\nsaid, The lesser note is due to you for interest on the greater.\n\nWhen the ladies opened their notes, and saw what they were, they were at\nfirst at a loss what to say.\n\nIt was most gracefully done. But see, Lucy, the example of a good and\ngenerous man can sometimes alter natures; and covetous men, I have heard\nit observed, when their hearts are opened, often act nobly.\n\nAs soon as Lady G---- (so now I must call her) recovered herself from the\nsurprise into which my lord's present and address had put her, she went\nto him: Allow me, my lord, said she, and bent one knee to him, to crave\nyour blessing; and at the same time to thank you for your paternal\npresent to your ever obliged Charlotte.\n\nGod bless you, my dear! saluting her--But thank your noble brother: you\ndelight me with your graceful acceptance.\n\nLady L---- came up. My Lord, you overcome me by your bounty.--How shall\nI--\n\nYour brother's princely spirit, Lady L----, said he, makes this present\nlook mean. Forgive me only, that it was not done before. And he saluted\nher.\n\nLord L---- came up. Lady L---- shewed him the opened notes--See here, my\nlord, said she, what Lord W---- has done: and he calls this the interest\ndue on that.\n\nYour lordship oppresses me with your goodness to your niece, said Lord\nL----. May health, long-life, and happiness, attend you in your own\nnuptials!\n\nThere, there, said Lord W----, pointing to Sir Charles, (who had\nwithdrawn, and then entered), make your acknowledgment: his noble spirit\nhas awakened mine; it was only asleep. My late sister's brother wanted\nbut the force of such an example. That son is all his mother.\n\nSir Charles joining them, having heard only the last words--If I am\nthought a son not unworthy of the most excellent of mothers, said he, and\nby her brother, I am happy.\n\nThen you are happy, replied my lord.\n\nHer memory, resumed Sir Charles, I cherish; and when I have been tempted\nto forget myself, that memory has been a means of keeping me steady in my\nduty. Her precepts, my lord, were the guide of my early youth. Had I\nnot kept them in mind, how much more blamable than most young men had I\nbeen!--My Charlotte! Have that mother in your memory, on this great\nchange of your condition! You will not be called to her trials.--His\neyes glistened. Tender be our remembrance of my father.--Charlotte, be\nworthy of your mother.\n\nHe withdrew with an air so noble!--But soon returning, with a cheerful\nlook, he was told what Lord W---- had done--Your lordship was before,\nsaid he, entitled to our duty, by the ties of blood: but what is the\nrelation of body to that of mind? You have bound me for my sisters, and\nthat still more by the manner, than by the act, in a bond of gratitude\nthat never can be broken!\n\nThank yourself, thank yourself, my noble nephew.\n\nEncourage, my lord, a family intimacy between your lady, and her nieces\nand nephews. You will be delighted, my sisters, with Miss Mansfield; but\nwhen she obliges my lord with her hand, you will reverence your aunt. I\nshall have a pleasure, when I am far distant, in contemplating the family\nunion. Your lordship must let me know your Day in time; and I will be\njoyful upon it, whatever, of a contrary nature, I may have to struggle\nwith on my own account.\n\nMy lord wept--My lord wept, did I say?--Not one of us had a dry eye!--\nThis was a solemn scene, you will say, for a wedding day: but how\ndelightfully do such scenes dilate the heart!\n\nThe day, however, was not forgotten as a day of festivity. Sir Charles\nhimself, by his vivacity and openness of countenance, made every one\njoyful: and, except that now and then a sigh, which could not be checked,\nstole from some of us, to think that he would so soon be in another\ncountry, (far distant from the friends he now made happy,) and engaged in\ndifficulties; perhaps in dangers; every heart was present to the occasion\nof the day.\n\nO, Charlotte! Dear Lady G----! Hitherto, it is in your power, to make\nevery future day, worthy of this!--'Have your mother, your noble mother,\nin your memory, my dear:' and give credit to the approbation of such a\nbrother.\n\nI should have told you, that my cousins Reeves came about two, and were\nreceived with the utmost politeness by every body.\n\nSir Charles was called out just before dinner; and returned introducing a\nyoung gentleman, dressed as if for the day--This is an earlier favour,\nthan I had hoped for, said Sir Charles; and leading him to Lady G----.\nThis, sir, is the queen of the day. My dear Lady G----, welcome (the\nhouse is yours--welcome) the man I love: welcome my Beauchamp.\n\nEvery one, except Emily and me, crowded about Mr. Beauchamp, as Sir\nCharles's avowedly beloved friend, and bid him cordially welcome: Sir\nCharles presenting him to each by name.\n\nThen leading him to me--I am half ashamed, Lucy, to repeat--But take it\nas he spoke it--Revere, said he, my dear friend, that excellent young\nlady: but let not your admiration stop at her face and person: she has a\nmind as exalted, my Beauchamp, as your own: Miss Byron, in honour to my\nsister, and of us all, has gilded this day by her presence.\n\nMr. Beauchamp approached me with polite respect. The lady whom Sir\nCharles Grandison admires, as he does you, must be the first of women.\n\nI might have said, that he, who was so eminently distinguished as the\nfriend of Sir Charles Grandison, must be a most valuable man: but my\nspirits were not high. I courtesied to his compliment; and was silent.\n\nSir Charles presented Emily to him.--My Emily, Beauchamp. I hope to live\nto see her happily married. The man whose heart is but half so worthy as\nhers, must be an excellent man.\n\nModesty might look up, and be sensible to compliments from the lips of\nsuch a man. Emily looked at me with pleasure, as if she had said, Do you\nhear, madam, what a fine thing my guardian has said of me?\n\nSir Charles asked Mr. Beauchamp, how he stood with my Lady Beauchamp?\n\nVery well, answered he. After such an introduction as you had given me\nto her, I must have been to blame, had I not. She is my father's wife: I\nmust respect her, were she ever so unkind to me: she is not without good\nqualities. Were every family so happy as to have Sir Charles Grandison\nfor a mediator when misunderstandings happened, there would be very few\nlasting differences among relations. My father and mother tell me, that\nthey never sit down to table together, but they bless you: and to me they\nhave talked of nobody else: but Lady Beauchamp depends upon your promise\nof making her acquainted with the ladies of your family.\n\nMy sisters, and their lords, will do honour to my promise in my absence.\nLady L----, Lady G----, let me recommend to you Lady Beauchamp as more\nthan a common visiting acquaintance. Do you, sir, to Mr. Beauchamp, see\nit cultivated.\n\nMr. Beauchamp is an agreeable, and, when Sir Charles Grandison is not in\ncompany, a handsome and genteel man. I think, my dear, that I do but the\nsame justice that every body would do, in this exception. He is\ncheerful, lively, yet modest, and not too full of words. One sees both\nlove and respect in every look he casts upon his friend; and that he is\ndelighted when he hears him speak, be the subject what it will.\n\nHe once said to Lord W----, who praised his nephew to him, as he does to\neverybody near him; The universal voice, my lord, is in his favour\nwherever he goes. Every one joins almost in the same words, in different\ncountries, allowing for the different languages, that for sweetness of\nmanners, and manly dignity, he hardly ever had his equal.\n\nSir Charles was then engaged in talk with his Emily; she before him; he\nstanding in an easy genteel attitude, leaning against the wainscot,\nlistening, smiling, to her prattle, with looks of indulgent love, as a\nfather might do to a child he was fond of; while she looked back every\nnow and then towards me, so proud, poor dear! of being singled out by her\nguardian.\n\nShe tript to me afterwards, and, leaning over my shoulder, as I sat,\nwhispered--I have been begging of my guardian to use his interest with\nyou, madam, to take me down with you to Northamptonshire.\n\nAnd what is the result?\n\nShe paused.\n\nHas he denied your request?\n\nNo, madam.\n\nHas he allowed you to go, my dear, if I comply, turning half round to her\nwith pleasure.\n\nShe paused, and seemed at a loss. I repeated my question.\n\nWhy, no, he has not consented neither--But he said such charming things,\nso obliging, so kind, both of you, and of me, that I forgot my question,\nthough it was so near my heart: but I will ask him again.\n\nAnd thus, Lucy, can he decline complying, and yet send away a requester\nso much delighted with him, as to forget what her request was.\n\nMiss Grandison--Lady G----, I would say--singled me out soon after--This\nBeauchamp is really a very pretty fellow, Harriet.\n\nHe is an agreeable man, answered I.\n\nSo I think. She said no more of him at that time.\n\nBetween dinner and tea, at Lady L----'s motion, they made me play on the\nharpsichord; and after one lesson, they besought Sir Charles to sing to\nmy playing. He would not, he said, deny any request that was made him on\nthat day.\n\nHe sung. He has a mellow manly voice, and great command of it.\n\nThis introduced a little concert. Mr. Beauchamp took the violin; Lord\nL---- the bass-viol; Lord G---- the German flute; and most of the company\njoined in the chorus. The song was from 'Alexander's Feast:' the words;\n\n      Happy, happy, happy pair!\n      None but the good deserves the fair:\n\nSir Charles, though himself equally brave and good, preferring the latter\nword to the former.\n\nLady L---- had always insisted upon dancing at her sister's wedding. We\nwere not company enough for country dances: but music having been\nordered, and the performers come, it was insisted upon that we should\nhave a dance, though we were engaged in a conversation that I thought\ninfinitely more agreeable.\n\nLord G---- began by dancing a minuet with his bride: she danced\ncharmingly: but on my telling her so afterwards, she whispered me, that\nshe should have performed better, had she danced with her brother. Lord\nG---- danced extremely well.\n\nLord L---- and Lady Gertrude, Mr. Beauchamp and Mrs. Reeves, Mr. Reeves\nand Lady L---- danced all of them very agreeably.\n\nThe earl took me out: but we had hardly done, when, asking pardon for\ndisgracing me, as he too modestly expressed himself; he, and all but my\ncousins and Emily, called out for Sir Charles to dance with me.\n\nI was abashed at the general voice calling upon us both: but it was\nobeyed.\n\nHe deserved all the praises that Miss Gran--Lady G----, I would say,\ngave him in her letter to me.\n\nLord bless me, my dear, this man is every thing! But his conversation\nhas ever been among the politest people of different nations.\n\nLord W---- wished himself able, from his gout, to take out Miss Jervois.\n\nThe bridegroom was called upon by Sir Charles: and he took out the good\ngirl, who danced very prettily. I fancied, that he chose to call out\nLord G---- rather than Mr. Beauchamp. He is the most delicate and\nconsiderate of men.\n\nSir Charles was afterwards called upon by the bride herself: and she\ndanced then with a grace indeed! I was pleased that she could perform so\nwell at her own wedding.\n\nSupper was not ready till twelve. Mr. Reeves's coach came about that\nhour; but we got not away till two.\n\nPerhaps the company would not have broke up so soon, had not the bride\nbeen perverse, and refused to retire.\n\nWas she not at home? she asked Lady L----, who was put upon urging her:\nand should she leave her company?\n\nShe would make me retire with her. She took a very affectionate leave of\nme.\n\nMarriage, Lucy, is an awful rite. It is supposed to be a joyful\nsolemnity: but, on the woman's side, it can be only so when she is given\nto the man she loves above all the men in the world; and, even to her,\nthe anniversary day, when doubt is turned into certainty, must be much\nhappier than the day itself.\n\nWhat a victim must that woman look upon herself to be, who is compelled,\nor even over-persuaded, to give her hand to a man who has no share in her\nheart? Ought not a parent or guardian, in such a circumstance,\nespecially if the child has a delicate, an honest mind, to be chargable\nwith all the unhappy consequences that may follow from such a cruel\ncompulsion?\n\nBut this is not the case with Miss Grandison. Early she cast her eye on\nan improper object. Her pride convinced her in time of the impropriety.\nAnd this, as she owns, gave her an indifference to all men.\n\nShe hates not Lord G----. There is no man whom she prefers to him. And\nin this respect, may perhaps, be upon a par with eight women out of\ntwelve, who marry, and yet make not bad wives.\n\nAs she played with her passion till she lost it, she may be happy, if she\nwill: and since she intended to be, some time or other, Lady G----, her\nbrother was kind in persuading her to shorten her days of coquetting and\nteasing, and allow him to give her to Lord G---- before he went abroad.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXI\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 12.\n\n\nDr. Bartlett was so good as to breakfast with my cousins and me this\nmorning. He talks of setting out for Grandison-hall on Saturday or\nMonday next. We have settled a correspondence; and he gives me hope,\nthat he will make me a visit in Northamptonshire. I know you will all\nrejoice to see him.\n\nEmily came in before the doctor went. She brought me the compliments of\nthe bride, and Lord W----, with their earnest request, that I would dine\nwith them. Sir Charles was gone, she said, to make a farewell visit to\nthe Danby set; but would be at home at dinner.\n\nIt would be better for me, I think, Lucy, to avoid all opportunities of\nseeing him: Don't you think so?--There is no such thing as seeing him\nwith indifference. But, so earnestly invited, how could I deny;\nespecially as my cousins were inclinable to go?\n\nMiss Jervois whispered me at parting. I never before, said she, had an\nopportunity to observe the behaviour of a new-married couple to each\nother: but is it customary, madam, for the bride to be more snappish, as\nthe bridegroom is more obliging?\n\nLady G---- is very naughty, my dear, if she so behaves, as to give you\nreason to ask this question.\n\nShe does: and, upon my word, I see more obedience where it was not\npromised, than where it was. Dear madam, is not what is said at church\nto be thought of afterwards? But why did not the doctor make her speak\nout? What signified bowing, except a woman was so bashful that she could\nnot speak?\n\nThe bowing, my dear, is an assent. It is as efficacious as words. Lord\nG---- only bowed, you know. Could you like to be called upon, Emily, to\nspeak out?\n\nWhy, no. But then I would be very civil and good-natured to my husband,\nif it were but for fear he should be cross to me: but I should think it\nmy duty as well\n\nSweet innocent!\n\nShe went away, and left the doctor with me.\n\nWhen our hearts are set upon a particular subject, how impertinent, how\nmuch beside the purpose, do we think every other! I wanted the doctor to\ntalk of Sir Charles Grandison: but as he fell not into the subject, and\nas I was afraid he would think me to be always leading him into it, if I\nbegan it, I suffered him to go away at his first motion: I never knew him\nso shy upon it, however.\n\nSir Charles returned to dinner. He has told Lady L----, who afterwards\ntold us, that he had a hint from Mr. Galliard, senior, that if he were\nnot engaged in his affections, he was commissioned to make him a very\ngreat proposal in behalf of one of the young ladies he had seen the\nThursday before; and that from her father.\n\nSurely, Lucy, we may pronounce without doubt, that we live in an age in\nwhich there is a great dearth of good men, that so many offers fall to\nthe lot of one. But, I am thinking, 'tis no small advantage to Sir\nCharles, that his time is so taken up, that he cannot stay long enough in\nany company to suffer them to cast their eyes on other objects, with\ndistinction. He left the numerous assembly at Enfield, while they were\nin the height of their admiration of him. Attention, love, admiration,\ncannot be always kept at the stretch. You will observe, Lucy, that on\nthe return of a long-absent dear friend, the rapture lasts not more than\nan hour: gladdened, as the heart is, the friend received, and the friends\nreceiving, perhaps in less than that time, can sit down quietly together,\nto hear and to tell stories, of what has happened to either in the long\nregretted absence. It will be so with us, Lucy, when I return to the\narms of my kind friends: and now, does not Sir Charles's proposed journey\nto Italy endear his company to us?\n\nThe Earl of G----, Lady Gertrude, and two agreeable nieces of that\nnobleman's, were here at dinner. Lady G---- behaved pretty well to her\nlord before them: but I, who understood the language of her eyes, saw\nthem talk very saucily to him, on several occasions. My lord is a little\nofficious in his obligingness; which takes off from that graceful, that\npolite frankness, which so charmingly, on all occasions, distinguishes\none happy man, who was then present. Lord G---- will perhaps appear more\nto advantage in that person's absence.\n\nMr. Beauchamp was also present. He is indeed an agreeable, a modest\nyoung man. He appeared to great advantage, as well in his conversation,\nas by his behaviour: and not the less for subscribing in both to the\nsuperiority of his friend; who, nevertheless, endeavoured to draw him out\nas the first man.\n\nAfter dinner, Lady L----, Lady G----, and I, found an opportunity to be\nby ourselves for one half hour. Lady G---- asked Lady L---- what she\nintended to do with the thousand pounds with which Lord W---- had so\ngenerously presented her?--Do with it, my dear!--What do you think I\nintend to do with it?--It is already disposed of.\n\nI'll be hanged, said Lady G----, if this good creature has not given it\nto her husband.\n\nIndeed, Charlotte, I have. I gave it to him before I slept.\n\nI thought so! She laughed--And Lord L---- took it! Did he?\n\nTo be sure he did. I should otherwise have been displeased with him.\n\nDear, good soul!--And so you gave him a thousand pounds to take part of\nit back from him, by four or five paltry guineas at a time, at his\npleasure?\n\nLord L---- and I, Charlotte, have but one purse. You may not perhaps,\nknow how we manage it?\n\nPray, good, meek, dependent creature! how do you manage it?\n\nThus, Charlotte: My lord knows that his wife and he have but one\ninterest; and from the first of our happy marriage, he would make me take\none key, as he has another, of the private drawer, where his money and\nmoney-bills lie. There is a little memorandum-book in the drawer, in\nwhich he enters on one page, the money he receives; on the opposite, the\nmoney he takes out: and when I want money, I have recourse to my key. If\nI see but little in the drawer, I am the more moderate; or, perhaps, if\nmy want is not urgent, defer the supplying of it till my lord is richer:\nbut, little or much, I minute down the sum, as he himself does; and so we\nknow what we are about; and I never put it out of my lord's power, by my\nunseasonable expenses, to preserve that custom of his, for which he is as\nmuch respected, as well served; not to suffer a demand to be twice made\nupon him where he is a debtor.\n\nGood soul!--And, pray, don't you minute down, too, the use to which you\nput the money you take out?\n\nIndeed I often do: always, indeed, when I take out more than five guineas\nat one time: I found my lord did so: and I followed the example of my own\naccord.\n\nHappy pair! said I.--O Lady G----, what a charming example is this!--I\nhope you'll follow it.\n\nThank you, Harriet, for your advice. Why, I can't but say, that this is\none pretty way of coaxing each other into frugality: but don't you think,\nthat where an honest pair are so tender of disobliging, and so studious\nof obliging each other, that they seem to confess that the matrimonial\ngood understanding hangs by very slender threads?\n\nAnd do not the tenderest friendships, said I, hang by as slender? Can\ndelicate minds be united to each other but by delicate observances?\n\nWhy thou art a good soul, too, Harriet!--And so you would both have me\nmake a present to Lord G---- of my thousand pounds before we have chosen\nour private drawer; before he has got two keys made to it?\n\nLet him know, Charlotte, what Lord L---- and I do, if you think the\nexample worth following--And then--\n\nAy, and then give him my thousand pounds for a beginning, Lady L----?\nBut see you not that this proposal should come from him, not from me?--\nAnd should we not let each other see a little of each other's merits\nfirst?\n\nSee, first, the merits of the man you have married, Charlotte!\n\nYes, Lady L----. But yesterday married, you know. Can there be a\ngreater difference between any two men in the world, than there often is\nbetween the same man, a lover, and a husband?--And now, my generous\nadvisers, be pleased to continue silent. You cannot answer me fairly.\nAnd besides, wot ye not the indelicacy of an early present, which you are\nnot obliged to make?\n\nWe were both silent, each expecting the other to answer the strange\ncreature.\n\nShe laughed at us both. Soft souls, and tender! said she, let me tell\nyou, that there is more indelicacy in delicacy, than you very delicate\npeople are aware of.\n\nYou, Charlotte, said Lady L----, have odder notions than any body else.\nHad you been a man, you would have been a sad rake.\n\nA rake, perhaps, I might have been; but not a sad one, Lady L----.\n\nLady G---- can't help being witty, said I: it is sometimes her\nmisfortune, sometimes ours, that she cannot: however, I highly approve of\nthe example set by Lord L----, and followed by Lady L----.\n\nAnd so do I, Harriet. And when Lord G---- sets the example, I shall--\nconsider of it. I am not a bad economist. Had I ten thousand pounds in\nmy hands, I would not be extravagant: had I but one hundred, I would not\nbe mean. I value not money but as it enables me to lay an obligation,\ninstead of being under the necessity of receiving one. I am my mother's\ndaughter, and brother's sister; and yours, Lady L----, in this\nparticular; and yours too, Harriet: different means may be taken to\narrive at the same end. Lord G---- will have no reason to be\ndissatisfied with my prudence in money-matters, although I should not\nmake him one of my best courtesies, as if--as if--(and she laughed; but\nchecking herself)--I were conscious--again she laughed--that I had signed\nand sealed to my absolute dependence on his bounty.\n\nWhat a mad creature! said Lady L----: But, my Harriet, don't you think\nthat she behaved pretty well to Lord G---- at table?\n\nYes, answered I, as those would think who observe not her arch looks: but\nshe gave me pain for her several times; and, I believe, her brother was\nnot without his apprehensions.\n\nHe had his eyes upon you, Harriet, replied Lady G----, more earnestly\nthan he had upon me, or any body else.\n\nThat's true, said Lady L----. I looked upon both him and you, my dear,\nwith pity. My tears were ready to start more than once, to reflect how\nhappy you two might be in each other, and how greatly you would love each\nother, were it not----\n\nNot one word more on this subject, dear Lady L----! I cannot bear it. I\nthought my-self, that he often cast an eye of tenderness upon me. I\ncannot bear it. I am afraid of myself; of my justice--\n\nHis tender looks did not escape me, said Lady G----. Nor yet did my dear\nHarriet's. But we will not touch this string: it is too tender a one.\nI, for my part, was forced, in order to divert myself, to turn my eyes on\nLord G----. He got nothing by that. The most officious--\n\nNay, Lady G----, interrupted I, you shall not change the discourse at the\nexpense of the man you have vowed to honour. I will be pained myself, by\nthe continuation of the former subject, rather than that shall be.\n\nCharming Harriet! said Lady L----. I hope your generosity will be\nrewarded. Yet tell me, my dear, can you wish Lady Clementina may be his?\nI have no doubt but you wish her recovery; but can you wish her to be\nhis?\n\nI have debated the matter, my dear Lady L----, with myself. I am sorry\nit has admitted of debate: so excellent a creature! Such an honour to\nher sex! So nobly sincere! So pious!--But I will confess the truth: I\nhave called upon justice to support me in my determination: I have\nsupposed myself in her situation, her unhappy malady excepted: I have\nsupposed her in mine: and ought I then to have hesitated to which to give\nthe preference?--Yet--\n\nWhat yet, most frank, and most generous of women? said Lady L----,\nclasping her arms about me: what yet--\n\nWhy, yet-Ah, ladies--Why, yet, I have many a pang, many a twitch, as I\nmay call it!--Why is your brother so tender-hearted, so modest, so\nfaultless!--Why did he not insult me with his pity? Why does he on every\noccasion shew a tenderness for me, that is more affecting than pity? And\nwhy does he give me a consequence that exalts, while it depresses me?\n\nI turned my head aside to hide my emotion--Lady G---- snatched my\nhandkerchief from me; and wiped away a starting tear; and called me by\nvery tender names.\n\nAm I dear, continued I, to the heart of such a man? You think I am.\nAllow me to say, that he is indeed dear to mine: yet I have not a wish\nbut for his happiness, whatever becomes of me.\n\nEmily appeared at the door--May I come in, ladies?--I will come in!--My\ndear Miss Byron affected! My dear Miss Byron in tears!\n\nHer pity, without knowing the cause, sprung to her eyes. She took my\nhand in both hers, and repeatedly kissed it!--My guardian asks for you.\nO with what tenderness of voice--Where is your Miss Byron, love? He\ncalls every one by gentle names, when he speaks of you--His voice then is\nthe voice of love--Love, said he to me! Through you, madam, he will love\nhis ward--And on your love will I build all my merit. But you sigh, dear\nMiss Byron! you sigh--Forgive your prating girl!--You must not be\ngrieved.\n\nI embraced her. Grief, my dear, reaches not my heart at this time. It\nis the merit of your guardian that affects me.\n\nGod bless you, madam, for your gratitude to my guardian!\n\nA Clementina and a Harriet! said Lady L----, two women so excellent!\nWhat a fate is his! How must his heart be divided!\n\nDivided, say you, Lady L----! resumed Lady G----. The man who loves\nvirtue, for virtue's sake, loves it wherever he finds it: Such a man may\ndistinguish more virtuous women than one: and if he be of a gentle and\nbeneficent nature, there will be tenderness in his distinction to every\none, varying only according to the difference of circumstance and\nsituation.\n\nLet me embrace you, my Charlotte! resumed Lady L----. for that thought.\nDon't let me hear, for a month to come, one word from the same lips, that\nmay be unworthy of it.\n\nYou have Lord G---- in your head, Lady L----: but never mind us. He must\nnow and then be made to look about him. I'll take care to keep up my\nconsequence with him, never fear: nor shall he have reason to doubt the\nvirtue of his wife.\n\nVirtue, my dear! said I: What is virtue only? She who will not be\nvirtuous for virtue's sake, is not worthy to be called a woman: but she\nmust be something more than virtuous for her husband's, nay, for her\nvow's sake. Complacency, obligingness--\n\nObedience too, I warrant--Hush, hush, my sweet Harriet! putting her hand\nbefore my mouth, we will behave as well as we can: and that will be very\nwell, if nobody minds us. And now let us go down together.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXII\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 13.\n\n\nWe played at cards last night till supper-time. When that was over,\nevery one sought to engage Sir Charles in discourse. I will give you\nsome particulars of our conversation, as I did of one before.\n\nLord W---- began it with a complaint of the insolence and profligateness\nof servants. What he said, was only answered by Sir Charles, with the\nword Example, example, my good lord, repeated.\n\nYou, Sir Charles, replied my lord, may indeed insist upon the force of\nexample; for I cannot but observe, that all those of yours, whom I have\nseen, are entitled to regard. They have the looks of men at ease, and of\nmen grateful for that ease: they know their duty, and need not a\nreminding look. A servant of yours, Sir Charles, looks as if he would\none day make a figure as a master. How do you manage it?\n\nPerhaps I have been peculiarly fortunate in worthy servants. There is\nnothing in my management deserving the attention of this company.\n\nI am going to begin the world anew, nephew. Hitherto, servants have been\na continual plague to me. I must know how you treat them.\n\nI treat them, my lord, as necessary parts of my family. I have no\nsecrets, the keeping or disclosing of which might give them\nself-importance. I endeavour to set them no bad example. I am never\nangry with them but for wilful faults: if those are not habitual, I shame\nthem into amendment, by gentle expostulation and forgiveness. If they\nare not capable of a generous shame, and the faults grow habitual, I part\nwith them; but with such kindness, as makes their fellow-servants blame\nthem, and take warning. I am fond of seeking occasions to praise them:\nand even when they mistake, if it be with a good intention, they have my\napprobation of the intention, and my endeavours to set them right as to\nthe act. Sobriety is an indispensable qualification for my service; and\nfor the rest, if we receive them not quite good, we make them better than\nthey were before. Generally speaking, a master may make a servant what\nhe pleases. Servants judge by example, rather than precept, and almost\nalways by their feelings. One thing more permit me to add; I always\ninsist upon my servants being kind and compassionate to one another. A\ncompassionate heart cannot habitually be an unjust one. And thus do I\nmake their good-nature contribute to my security, as well as quiet.\n\nMy lord was greatly pleased with what his nephew said.\n\nUpon some occasion, Lady G---- reflected upon a lady for prudery, and was\ngoing on, when Sir Charles, interrupting her, said, Take care, Lady\nG----. You, ladies, take care; for I am afraid, that MODESTY, under this\nname, will become ignominious, and be banished the hearts, at least the\nbehaviour and conversation, of all those whose fortunes or inclinations\ncarry them often to places of public resort.\n\nTalk of places of public resort! said Lord L----: It is vexatious to\nobserve at such, how men of real merit are neglected by the fine ladies\nof the age, while every distinction is shewn to fops and foplings.\n\nBut, who, my lord, said Sir Charles, are those women? Are they not\ngenerally of a class with those men? Flippant women love empty men,\nbecause they cannot reproach them with a superiority of understanding,\nbut keep their folly in countenance. They are afraid of a wise man: but\nI would by no means have such a one turn fool to please them: for they\nwill despise the wise man's folly more than the silly man's, and with\nreason; because being uncharacteristic, it must sit more awkwardly upon\nhim than the other's can do.\n\nYet wisdom itself, and the truest wisdom, goodness, said Mrs. Reeves, is\nsometimes thought to sit ungracefully, when it is uncharacteristic, not\nto the man, but to the times. She then named a person who was branded as\na hypocrite, for performing all his duties publicly.\n\nHe will be worse spoken of, if he declines doing so, said Dr. Bartlett.\nHis enemies will add the charge of cowardice; and not acquit him of the\nother.\n\nLady Gertrude being withdrawn, it was mentioned as a wonder, that so\nagreeable a woman, as she must have been in her youth, and still was for\nher years, should remain single. Lord G---- said, that she had had many\noffers: and once, before she was twenty, had like to have stolen a\nwedding: but her fears, he said, since that, had kept her single.\n\nThe longer, said Sir Charles, a woman remains unmarried, the more\napprehensive she will be of entering into the state. At seventeen or\neighteen a girl will plunge into it, sometimes without either fear or\nwit; at twenty she will begin to think; at twenty-four will weigh and\ndiscriminate; at twenty-eight will be afraid of venturing; at thirty will\nturn about, and look down the hill she has ascended; and, as occasions\noffer, and instances are given, will sometimes repent, sometimes rejoice,\nthat she has gained that summit sola.\n\nIndeed, said Mrs. Reeves, I believe in England many a poor girl goes up\nthe hill with a companion she would little care for, if the state of a\nsingle woman were not here so peculiarly unprovided and helpless: for\ngirls of slender fortunes, if they have been genteelly brought up, how\ncan they, when family connexions are dissolved, support themselves? A\nman can rise in a profession, and if he acquires wealth in a trade, can\nget above it, and be respected. A woman is looked upon as demeaning\nherself, if she gains a maintenance by her needle, or by domestic\nattendance on a superior; and without them where has she a retreat?\n\nYou speak, good Mrs. Reeves, said Sir Charles, as if you would join with\nDr. Bartlett and me in wishing the establishment of a scheme we have\noften talked over, though the name of it would make many a lady start.\nWe want to see established in every county, Protestant Nunneries, in\nwhich single women of small or no fortunes might live with all manner of\nfreedom, under such regulations as it would be a disgrace for a modest or\ngood woman not to comply with, were she absolutely on her own hands; and\nto be allowed to quit it whenever they pleased.\n\nWell, brother, said Lady G----, and why could you not have got all this\nsettled a fortnight ago, (you that can carry every point,) and have made\npoor me a lady abbess?\n\nYou are still better provided for, my sister. But let the doctor and me\nproceed with our scheme. The governesses or matrons of the society I\nwould have to be women of family, of unblamable characters from infancy,\nand noted equally for their prudence, good-nature, and gentleness of\nmanners. The attendants, for the slighter services, should be the\nhopeful female children of the honest industrious poor.\n\nDo you not, ladies, imagine, said Dr. Bartlett, that such a society as\nthis, all women of unblemished reputation, employing themselves as each,\n(consulting her own genius,) at her admission, shall undertake to employ\nherself, and supported genteelly, some at more, some at less expense to\nthe foundation, according to their circumstances, might become a national\ngood; and particularly a seminary for good wives, and the institution a\nstand for virtue, in an age given up to luxury, extravagance, and\namusements little less than riotous?\n\nHow could it be supported? said Lord W----.\n\nMany of the persons, of which each community would consist, would be, I\nimagine, replied Sir Charles, no expense to it at all; as numbers of\nyoung women, joining their small fortunes, might be able, in such a\nsociety, to maintain themselves genteelly on their own income; though\neach, singly in the world, would be distressed. Besides, liberty might\nbe given for wives, in the absence of their husbands, in this maritime\ncountry; and for widows, who, on the deaths of theirs, might wish to\nretire from the noise and hurry of the world, for three, six, or twelve\nmonths, more or less; to reside in this well-regulated society. And such\npersons, we may suppose, would be glad, according to their respective\nabilities, to be benefactresses to it. No doubt but it would have\nbesides the countenance of the well-disposed of both sexes; since every\nfamily in Britain, in their connexions and relations, near or distant,\nmight be benefited by so reputable and useful an institution: to say\nnothing of the works of the ladies in it, the profits of which perhaps\nwill be thought proper to be carried towards the support of a foundation\nthat so genteelly supports them. Yet I would have a number of hours in\neach day, for the encouragement of industry, that should be called their\nown; and what was produced in them, to be solely appropriated to their\nown use.\n\nA truly worthy divine, at the appointment of the bishop of the diocese,\nto direct and animate the devotion of such a society, and to guard it\nfrom that superstition and enthusiasm which soars to wild heights in\nalmost all nunneries, would confirm it a blessing to the kingdom.\n\nI have another scheme, my lord, proceeded Sir Charles--An hospital for\nfemale penitents; for such unhappy women, as having been once drawn in,\nand betrayed by the perfidy of men, find themselves, by the cruelty of\nthe world, and principally by that of their own sex, unable to recover\nthe path of virtue, when perhaps, (convinced of the wickedness of the men\nin whose honour they confided,) they would willingly make their first\ndeparture from it the last.\n\nThese, continued he, are the poor creatures who are eminently entitled to\nour pity, though they seldom meet with it. Good nature, and credulity,\nthe child of good nature; are generally, as I have the charity to\nbelieve, rather than viciousness, the foundation of their crime. Those\nmen who pretend they would not be the first destroyers of a woman's\ninnocence, look upon these as fair prize. But, what a wretch is he, who\nseeing a poor creature exposed on the summit of a dangerous precipice,\nand unable, without an assisting hand, to find her way down, would rather\npush her into the gulf below, than convey her down in safety?\n\nSpeaking of the force put upon a daughter's inclinations in wedlock;\nTyranny and ingratitude, said Sir Charles, from a man beloved, will be\nmore supportable to a woman of strong passions, than even kindness from a\nman she loves not: Shall not parents then, who hope to see their children\nhappy, avoid compelling them to give their hands to a man who has no\nshare in their hearts?\n\nBut would you allow young ladies to be their own choosers, Sir Charles?\nsaid Mr. Reeves.\n\nDaughters, replied he, who are earnest to choose for themselves, should\nbe doubly careful that prudence justifies their choice. Every widow who\nmarries imprudently, (and very many there are who do,) furnishes a strong\nargument in favour of a parent's authority over a maiden daughter. A\ndesigning man looks out for a woman who has an independent fortune, and\nhas no questions to ask. He seems assured of finding indiscretion and\nrashness in such a one, to befriend him. But ought not she to think\nherself affronted, and resolve to disappoint him?\n\nBut how, said Lady G----, shall a young creature be able to judge--\n\nBy his application to her, rather than to her natural friends and\nrelations; by his endeavouring to alienate her affections from them; by\nwishing her to favour private and clandestine meetings (conscious that\nhis pretensions will not stand discussion); by the inequality of his\nfortune to hers: and has not our excellent Miss Byron, in the letters to\nher Lucy, (bowing to me,) which she has had the goodness to allow us to\nread, helped us to a criterion? 'Men in their addresses to young women,'\nshe very happily observes, 'forget not to set forward the advantages by\nwhich they are distinguished, whether hereditary or acquired; while love,\nlove, is all the cry of him who has no other to boast of.'\n\nAnd by that means, said Lady Gertrude, setting the silly creature at\nvariance with all her friends, he makes her fight his battles for him;\nand become herself the cat's paw to help him to the ready roasted\nchesnuts.\n\nBut, dear brother, said Lady G----, do you think love is such a staid\ndeliberate passion, as to allow a young creature to take time to ponder\nand weigh all the merits of the cause?\n\nLove at first sight, answered Sir Charles, must indicate a mind prepared\nfor impression, and a sudden gust of passion, and that of the least noble\nkind; since there could be no opportunity of knowing the merit of the\nobject. What woman would have herself supposed capable of such a tindery\nfit? In a man, it is an indelicate paroxysm: but in a woman, who expects\nprotection and instruction from a man, much more so. Love, at first, may\nbe only fancy. Such a young love may be easily given up, and ought, to a\nparent's judgment. Nor is the conquest so difficult as some young\ncreatures think it. One thing, my good Emily, let me say to you, as a\nrule of some consequence in the world you are just entering into--Young\npersons, on arduous occasions, especially in love-cases, should not\npresume to advise young persons; because they seldom can divest\nthemselves of passion, partiality, or prejudice; that is, indeed, of\nyouth; and forbear to mix their own concerns and biases with the question\nreferred to them. It should not be put from young friend to young\nfriend, What would you do in such a case? but, What ought to be done?\n\nHow the dear girl blushed, and how pleased she looked, to be particularly\naddressed by her guardian!\n\nLady Gertrude spoke of a certain father, who for interested views obliged\nhis daughter to marry at fifteen, when she was not only indifferent to\nthe man, but had formed no right notions of the state.\n\nAnd are they not unhappy? asked Sir Charles.\n\nThey are, replied she.\n\nI knew such an instance, returned he. The lady was handsome, and had her\nfull share of vanity. She believed every man who said civil things to\nher, was in love with her; and had she been single, that he would have\nmade his addresses to her. She supposed, that she might have had this\ngreat man, or that, had she not been precipitated: And this brought her\nto slight the man who had, as she concluded, deprived her of better\noffers. They were unhappy to the end of their lives. Had the lady lived\nsingle long enough to find out the difference between compliment and\nsincerity, and that the man who flattered her vanity, meant no more than\nto take advantage of her folly, she would have thought herself not\nunhappy with the very man with whom she was so dissatisfied.\n\nLady L---- speaking afterwards of a certain nobleman, who is continually\nrailing against matrimony, and who makes a very indifferent husband to an\nobliging wife: I have known more men than one, said Sir Charles, inveigh\nagainst matrimony, when the invective would have proceeded with a much\nbetter grace from their wives' lips than from theirs. But let us\ninquire, would this complainer have been, or deserved to be, happier in\nany state, than he now is?\n\nA state of suffering, said Lady L----, had probably humbled the spirit of\nthe poor wife into perfect meekness and patience.\n\nYou observe rightly, replied Sir Charles: And surely a most kind\ndisposition of Providence it is, that adversity, so painful in itself,\nshould conduce so peculiarly to the improvement of the human mind: It\nteaches modesty, humility, and compassion.\n\nYou speak feelingly brother, said Lady L----, with a sigh. Do you think,\nLucy, nobody sighed but she?\n\nI do, said he. I speak with a sense of gratitude: I am naturally of an\nimperious spirit: But I have reaped advantages, from the early stroke of\na mother's death. Being for years, against my wishes, obliged to submit\nto a kind of exile from my native country, which I considered as a heavy\nevil, though I thought it my duty to acquiesce, I was determined, as much\nas my capacity would allow, to make my advantage of the compulsion, by\nqualifying myself to do credit, rather than discredit, to my father, my\nfriends, and my country. And, let me add, that if I have in any\ntolerable manner succeeded, I owe much to the example and precepts of my\ndear Dr. Bartlett.\n\nThe doctor blushed and bowed, and was going to disclaim the merit which\nhis patron had ascribed to him; but Sir Charles confirmed it in still\nstronger terms: You, my dear Dr. Bartlett, said he, as I have told Miss\nByron, was a second conscience to me in my earlier youth: Your precepts,\nyour excellent life, your pure manners, your sweetness of temper, could\nnot but open and enlarge my mind. The soil, I hope I may say, was not\nbarren; but you, my dear paternal friend, was the cultivator: I shall\never acknowledge it--And he bowed to the good man; who was covered with\nmodest confusion, and could not look up.\n\nAnd think you, Lucy, that this acknowledgment lessened the excellent man\nwith any one present? No! It raised him in every eye: and I was the\nmore pleased with it, as it helped me to account for that deep\nobservation, which otherwise one should have been at a loss to account\nfor, in so young a man. And yet I am convinced, that there is hardly a\ngreater difference in intellect between angel and man, than there is\nbetween man and man.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXIII\n\nLADY G----, TO MISS BYRON\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 13.\n\n\nFor Heaven's sake, my dearest Harriet! dine with us to-day; for two\nreasons: one relates to myself; the other you shall hear by and by: To\nmyself, first, as is most fit--This silly creature has offended me, and\npresumed to be sullen upon my resentment. Married but two days, and shew\nhis airs!--Were I in fault, my dear, (which, upon my honour, I am not,)\nfor the man to lose his patience with me, to forget his obligations to\nme, in two days!--What an ungrateful wretch is he! What a poor powerless\ncreature your Charlotte!\n\nNobody knows of the matter, except he has complained to my brother--If he\nhas! But what if he has?--Alas! my dear, I am married; and cannot help\nmyself.\n\nWe seem, however, to be drawing up our forces on both sides.--One\nstruggle for my dying liberty, my dear!--The success of one pitched\nbattle will determine which is to be the general, which the subaltern,\nfor the rest of the campaign. To dare to be sullen already!--As I hope\nto live, my dear, I was in high good humour within myself; and when he\nwas foolish, only intended a little play with him; and he takes it in\nearnest. He worships you: so I shall rally him before you: but I charge\nyou, as the man by his sullenness has taken upon him to fight his own\nbattle, either to be on my side, or be silent. I shall take it very ill\nof my Harriet, if she strengthen his hands.\n\nWell, but enough of this husband--HUSBAND! What a word!--Who do you\nthink is arrived from abroad?--You cannot guess for your life--Lady\nOLIVIA!--True as you are alive! accompanied, it seems, by an aunt of\nhers; a widow, whose years and character are to keep the niece in\ncountenance in this excursion. The pretence is, making the tour of\nEurope: and England was not to be left out of the scheme. My brother is\nexcessively disturbed at her arrival. She came to town but last night.\nHe had notice of it but this morning. He took Emily with him to visit\nher: Emily was known to her at Florence. She and her aunt are to be here\nat dinner. As she is come, Sir Charles says, he must bring her\nacquainted with his sisters, and their lords, in order to be at liberty\nto pursue the measures he has unalterably resolved upon: and this,\nHarriet, is my second reason for urging you to dine with us.\n\nNow I do wish we had known her history at large. Dr. Bartlett shall tell\nit us. Unwelcome as she is to my brother, I long to see her. I hope I\nshall not hear something in her story, that will make me pity her.\n\nWill you come?\n\nI wonder whether she speaks English, or not. I don't think I can\nconverse in Italian.\n\nI won't forgive you, if you refuse to come.\n\nLady L---- and her good man will be here. We shall therefore, if you\ncome, be our whole family together.\n\nMy brother has presented this house to me, till his return. He calls\nhimself Lord G----'s guest and mine: so you can have no punctilio about\nit. Besides, Lord W---- will set out to-morrow morning for Windsor. He\ndotes upon you: and perhaps it is in your power to make a new-married man\npenitent and polite.\n\nSo you must come.\n\nHang me, if I sign by any other name, while this man is in fits, than\nthat of\n\nCHARLOTTE GRANDISON.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXIV\n\nMISS BYRON, TO MISS SELBY\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 13.\n\n\nI send you enclosed a letter I received this morning from Lady G----. I\nwill suppose you have read it.\n\nEmily says, that the meeting between Sir Charles and the lady mentioned\nin it, was very polite on both sides: but more cold on his than on hers.\nShe made some difficulty, however, of dining at his house; and her aunt,\nLady Maffei, more. But on Sir Charles's telling them, that he would\nbring his elder sister to attend them thither, they complied.\n\nWhen I went to St. James's-square, Sir Charles and Lady L---- were gone\nin his coach to bring the two ladies.\n\nLady G---- met me on the stairs-head, leading into her dressing-room.\nNot a word, said she, of the man's sullens: He repents: A fine figure, as\nI told him, of a bridegroom, would he make in the eyes of foreign ladies,\nat dinner, were he to retain his gloomy airs. He has begged my pardon;\nas good as promised amendment; and I have forgiven him.\n\nPoor Lord G----, said I.\n\nHush, hush! He is within: he will hear you: and then perhaps repent of\nhis repentance.\n\nShe led me in: my lord had a glow in his cheeks, and looked as if he had\nbeen nettled; and was but just recovering a smile, to help to carry off\nthe petulance. O how saucily did her eyes look! Well, my lord, said\nshe, I hope--But you say, I misunderstood--No more, madam, no more, I\nbeseech you--\n\nWell, sir, not a word more, since you are--\n\nPray, madam--\n\nWell, well, give me your hand--You must leave Harriet and me together.\n\nShe humorously courtesied to him as he bowed to me, taking the compliment\nas to herself. She nodded her head to him, as he turned back his when he\nwas at the door; and when he was gone, If I can but make this man\norderly, said she, I shall not quarrel with my brother for hurrying me,\nas he has done.\n\nYou are wrong, excessively wrong, Charlotte: you call my lord a silly\nman, but can have no proof that he is so, but by his bearing this\ntreatment from you.\n\nNone of your grave airs, my dear. The man is a good sort of man, and\nwill be so, if you and Lady L---- don't spoil him. I have a vast deal of\nroguery, but no ill-nature, in my heart. There is luxury in jesting with\na solemn man, who wants to assume airs of privilege, and thinks he has a\nright to be impertinent. I'll tell you how I will manage--I believe I\nshall often try his patience, and when I am conscious that I have gone\ntoo far, I will be patient if he is angry with me; so we shall be quits.\nThen I'll begin again: he will resent: and if I find his aspect very\nsolemn--Come, come, no glouting, friend, I will say, and perhaps smile in\nhis face: I'll play you a tune, or sing you a song--Which, which! Speak\nin a moment, or the humour will be off.\n\nIf he was ready to cry before, he will laugh then, though against his\nwill: and as he admires my finger, and my voice, shall we not be\ninstantly friends?\n\nIt signified nothing to rave at her: she will have her way. Poor Lord\nG----! At my first knowledge of her, I thought her very lively; but\nimagined not that she was indiscreetly so.\n\nLord G----'s fondness for his saucy bride was, as I have reason to\nbelieve, his fault: I dared not to ask for particulars of their quarrel:\nand if I had, and found it so, could not, with such a rallying creature,\nhave entered into his defence, or censured her.\n\nI went down a few moments before her. Lord G---- whispered me, that he\nshould be the happiest man in the world, if I, who had such an influence\nover her, would stand his friend.\n\nI hope, my lord, said I, that you will not want any influence but your\nown. She has a thousand good qualities. She has charming spirits. You\nwill have nothing to bear with but from them. They will not last always.\nThink only, that she can mean nothing by the exertion of them, but\ninnocent gaiety; and she will every day love your lordship the better for\nbearing with her. You know she is generous and noble.\n\nI see, madam, said he, she has let you into--\n\nShe has not acquainted me with the particulars of the little\nmisunderstanding; only has said, that there had been a slight one; which\nwas quite made up.\n\nI am ashamed, replied he, to have it thought by Miss Byron, that there\ncould have been a misunderstanding between us, especially so early. She\nknows her power over me. I am afraid she despises me.\n\nImpossible, my lord! Have you not observed, that she spares nobody when\nshe is in a lively humour?\n\nTrue--But here she comes!--Not a word, madam!--I bowed assenting silence.\nLord G---- said, she, approaching him, in a low voice, I shall be jealous\nof your conversations with Miss Byron.\n\nWould to heaven, my dearest life! snatching at her withdrawn hand,\nthat--\n\nI were half as good as Miss Byron: I understand you: but time and\npatience, sir; nodding to him, and passing him.\n\nAdmirable creature! said he, how I adore her!\n\nI hinted to her afterwards, his fear of her despising him. Harriet,\nanswered she, with a serious air, I will do my duty by him. I will abhor\nmy own heart, if I ever find in it the shadow of a regard for any man in\nthe world, inconsistent with that which he has a right to expect from me.\n\nI was pleased with her. And found an opportunity to communicate what she\nsaid, in confidence, to my lord; and had his blessings for it.\n\nBut now for some account of Lady Olivia. With which I will begin a new\nletter.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXV\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\n\n\nSir Charles returned with the ladies. He presented to Lady Olivia and\nher aunt, Lady G----, Lord L----, and Lord W----. I was in another\napartment talking with Dr. Bartlett. Lady Olivia asked for the doctor.\nHe left me to pay his respects to her.\n\nSir Charles being informed, that I was in the house, told Lady Olivia,\nthat he hoped he should have the honour of presenting to her one of our\nEnglish beauties; desiring Lady G---- to request my company.\n\nLady G---- came to me--A lovely woman, I assure you, Harriet; let me lead\nyou to her.\n\nSir Charles met me at the entrance of the drawing-room: Excuse me, madam,\nsaid he, taking my hand, with profound respect, and allow me to introduce\nto a very amiable Italian lady, one who does so much honour to Britain.--\nMiss Byron, madam, addressing himself to her, salutes you. The\nadvantages of person are her least perfection.\n\nHer face glowed. Miss Byron, said she, in French, is all loveliness. A\nrelation, sir? in Italian.\n\nHe bowed; but answered not her question.\n\nI would sooner forgive you here, whispered Lady Olivia to Sir Charles, in\nItalian, looking at me, than at Bologna.\n\nI heard her; and by my confusion shewed that I understood her. She was\nin confusion too.\n\nMademoiselle, said she, in French, understands Italian.--I am ashamed,\nmonsieur.\n\nMiss Byron does, answered Sir Charles; and French too.\n\nI must have the honour, said she in French, to be better known to you,\nmademoiselle.\n\nI answered her as politely as I could in the same language.\n\nLady OLIVIA is really a lovely woman. Her complexion is fine. Her face\noval. Every feature of it is delicate. Her hair is black; and, I think,\nI never saw brighter black eyes in my life: if possible, they are\nbrighter, and shine with a more piercing lustre, than even Sir Charles\nGrandison's: but yet I give his the preference; for we see in them a\nbenignity, that hers, though a woman's, has not; and a thoughtfulness, as\nif something lay upon his mind, which nothing but patience could\novercome; yet mingled with an air that shews him to be equal to any\nthing, that can be undertaken by man. While Olivia's eyes shew more fire\nand impetuosity than sweetness. Had I not been told it, I should have\nbeen sure that she has a violent spirit: but on the whole, she is a very\nfine figure of a woman.\n\nShe talked of taking a house, and staying in England a year at least; and\nwas determined, she said, to perfect herself in the language, and to\nbecome an Englishwoman: but when Sir Charles, in the way of discourse,\nmentioned his obligation to leave England, as on next Friday morning, how\ndid she and her aunt look upon each other! And how was the sunshine that\ngilded her fine countenance, shut in! Surely, sir, said her aunt, you\nare not in earnest!\n\nAfter dinner, the two ladies retired with Sir Charles, at his motion.\nDr. Bartlett, at Lady G----'s request, then gave us this short sketch of\nher history. He said, she had a vast fortune: she had had indiscretions;\nbut none that had affected her character as to virtue: but her spirit\ncould not bear control. She had shewn herself to be vindictive, even to\na criminal degree. Lord bless me, my dear! the doctor has mentioned to\nme in confidence, that she always carries a poniard about her; and that\nonce she used it. Had the person died, she would have been called to\npublic account for it. The man, it seems, was of rank, and offered some\nslight affront to her. She now comes over, the doctor said, as he had\nreason to believe, with a resolution to sacrifice even her religion, if\nit were insisted upon, to the passion she had so long in vain endeavoured\nto conquer.\n\nShe has, he says, an utter hatred to Lady Clementina; and will not be\nable to govern her passion, he is sure, when Sir Charles shall acquaint\nher, that he is going to attend that lady, and her family: for he has\nonly mentioned his obligation to go abroad; but not said whither.\n\nLord W---- praised the person of the lady, and her majestic air. Lord\nL---- and Lord G---- wished to be within hearing of the conference\nbetween her and Sir Charles: so did Lady G----: and while they were thus\nwishing, in came Sir Charles, his face all in a glow; Lady L----, said\nhe, be so good as to attend Lady Olivia.\n\nShe went to her; Sir Charles staid not with us: yet went not to the lady;\nbut into his study. Dr. Bartlett attended him there: the doctor returned\nsoon after to us. His noble heart is vexed, said he: Lady Olivia has\ngreatly disturbed him: he chooses to be alone.\n\nLady L---- afterwards told us, that she found the lady in violent anguish\nof spirit; her aunt endeavouring to calm her: she, however, politely\naddressed herself to Lady L----, and begging her aunt to withdraw for a\nfew moments, she owned to her, in French, her passion for her brother:\nShe was not, she said, ashamed to own it to his sister, who must know\nthat his merit would dignify the passion of the noblest woman. She had\nendeavoured, she said, to conquer hers: she had been willing to give way\nto the prior attachments that he had pleaded for a lady of her own\ncountry, Signora Clementina della Porretta, whom she allowed to have had\ngreat merit; but who, having irrecoverably been put out of her right\nmind, was shut up at Naples by a brother, who vowed eternal enmity to Sir\nCharles; and from whom his life would be in the utmost hazard, if he went\nover. She owned, that her chief motive for coming to England was, to\ncast her fortune at her brother's feet; and, as she knew him to be a man\nof honour, to comply with any terms he should propose to her. He had\noffered to the family della Porretta to allow their daughter her\nreligion, and her confessor, and to live with her every other year in\nItaly. She herself, not inferior in birth, in person, in mind, as she\nsaid, she presumed, and superior in fortune, the riches of three branches\nof her family, all rich, having centred in her, insisted not now upon\nsuch conditions. Her aunt, she said, knew not that she proposed, on\nconviction, a change of her religion; but she was resolved not to conceal\nanything from Lady L----. She left her to judge how much she must be\naffected, when he declared his obligation to leave England; and\nespecially when he owned, that it was to go to Bologna, and that so\nsuddenly, as if, as she apprehended at first, it was to avoid her. She\nhad been in tears, she said, and even would have kneeled to him, to\ninduce him to suspend his journey for one month, and then to have taken\nher over with him, and seen her safe in her own palace, if he would go\nupon so hated, and so fruitless, as well as so hazardous an errand: but\nhe had denied her this poor favour.\n\nThis refusal, she owned, had put her out of all patience. She was\nunhappily passionate; but was the most placable of her sex. What, madam,\nsaid she, can affect a woman, if slight, indignity, and repulse, from a\nfavoured person, is not able to do it? A woman of my condition to come\nover to England, to solicit--how can I support the thought--and to be\nrefused the protection of the man she prefers to all men; and her request\nto see her safe back again, though but as the fool she came over!--You\nmay blame me, madam--but you must pity me, even were you to have a heart\nthe sister heart of your inflexible brother.\n\nIn vain did Lady L---- plead to her Lady Clementina's deplorable\nsituation; the reluctance of his own relations to part with him; and the\nmagnanimity of his self-denial in a hundred instances, on the bare\npossibility of being an instrument to restore her: she could not bear to\nhear her speak highly of the unhappy lady. She charged Clementina with\nthe pride of her family, to which she attributed their deserved calamity;\n[Deserved! Cruel lady! How could her pitiless heart allow her lips to\nutter such a word!] and imputed meanness to the noblest of human minds,\nfor yielding to the entreaties of a family, some of the principals of\nwhich, she said, had treated him with an arrogance that a man of his\nspirit ought not to bear.\n\nLady Maffei came in. She seems dependent upon her niece. She is her\naunt by marriage only: and Lady L---- speaks very favourably of her from\nthe advice she gave, and her remonstrances to her kinswoman. Lady Maffei\nbesought her to compose herself, and return to the company.\n\nShe could not bear, she said, to return to the company, the slighted, the\ncontemned object, she must appear to be to every one in it. I am an\nintruder, said she, haughtily; a beggar, with a fortune that would\npurchase a sovereignty in some countries. Make my excuses to your\nsister, to the rest of the company--and to that fine young lady--whose\neyes, by their officious withdrawing from his, and by the consciousness\nthat glowed in her face whenever he addressed her, betrayed, at least to\na jealous eye, more than she would wish to have seen--But tell her, that\nall lovely and blooming as she is, she must have no hope, while\nClementina lives.\n\nI hope, Lucy, it is only to a jealous eye that my heart is so\ndiscoverable!--I thank her for her caution. But I can say what she\ncannot; that from my heart, cost me what it may, I do subscribe to a\npreference in favour of a lady, who has acted, in the most arduous\ntrials, in a greater manner than I fear either Olivia or I could have\nacted, in the same circumstances. We see that her reason, but not her\npiety, deserted her in the noble struggle between her love and her\nreligion. In the most affecting absences of her reason, the soul of the\nman she loved was the object of her passion. However hard it is to\nprefer another to one's self, in such a case as this; yet if my judgment\nis convinced, my acknowledgment shall follow it. Heaven will enable me\nto be reconciled to the event, because I pursue the dictates of that\njudgment, against the biases of my more partial heart. Let that Heaven,\nwhich only can, restore Clementina, and dispose as it pleases of Olivia\nand Harriet. We cannot either of us, I humbly hope, be so unhappy as the\nlady has been whom I rank among the first of women; and whose whole\nfamily deserves almost equal compassion.\n\nLady Olivia asked Lady L----, if her brother had not a very tender regard\nfor me? He had, Lady L---- answered; and told her, that he had rescued\nme from a very great distress; and that mine was the most grateful of\nhuman hearts.\n\nShe called me sweet young creature; (supposing me, I doubt not, younger\nthan I am;) but said, that the graces of my person and mind alarmed her\nnot, as they would have done, had not his attachment to Clementina been\nwhat now she saw, but never could have believed it was; having supposed,\nthat compassion only was the tie that bound him to her.\n\nBut compassion, Lucy, from such a heart as his, the merit so great in the\nlady, must be love; a love of the nobler kind--And if it were not, it\nwould be unworthy of Clementina's.\n\nLady Maffei called upon her dignity, her birth, to carry her above a\npassion that met not with a grateful return. She advised her to dispose\nherself to stay in England some months, now she was here. And as her\nfriends in Italy would suppose what her view was in coming to England,\ntheir censures would be obviated by her continuing here for some time,\nwhile Sir Charles was abroad, and in Italy: and that she should divert\nherself with visiting the court, the public places, and in seeing the\nprincipal curiosities of this kingdom, as she had done those of others;\nin order to give credit to an excursion that might otherwise be freely\nspoken of, in her own country.\n\nShe seemed to listen to this advice. She bespoke, and was promised, the\nfriendship of the two sisters; and included in her request, through their\ninterests, mine; and Lady G---- was called in, by her sister, to join in\nthe promise.\n\nShe desired that Sir Charles might be requested to walk in; but would not\nsuffer the sisters to withdraw, as they would have done, when he\nreturned. He could not but be polite; but, it seems, looked still\ndisturbed. I beg you to excuse, sir, said she, my behaviour to you: it\nwas passionate; it was unbecoming. But, in compliment to your own\nconsequence, you ought to excuse it. I have only to request one favour\nof you: That you will suspend for one week, in regard to me, your\nproposed journey; but for one week; and I will, now I am in England, stay\nsome months; perhaps till your return.\n\nExcuse me, madam.\n\nI will not excuse you--But one week, sir. Give me so much importance\nwith myself, as for one week's suspension. You will. You must.\n\nIndeed I cannot. My soul, I own to you, is in the distresses of the\nfamily of Porretta. Why should I repeat what I said to you before?\n\nI have bespoken, sir, the civilities of your sisters, of your family: you\nforbid them not?\n\nYou expect not an answer, madam, to that question. My sisters will be\nglad, and so will their lords, to attend you wherever you please, with a\nhope to make England agreeable to you.\n\nHow long do you propose to stay in Italy, sir?\n\nIt is not possible for me to determine.\n\nAre you not apprehensive of danger to your person?\n\nI am not.\n\nYou ought to be.\n\nNo danger shall deter me from doing what I think to be right. If my\nmotives justify me, I cannot fear.\n\nDo you wish me, sir, to stay in England till your return?\n\nA question so home put, disturbed him. Was it a prudent one in the lady?\nIt must either subject her to a repulse; or him, by a polite answer, to\ngive her hope, that her stay in England might not be fruitless, as to the\nview she had in coming. He reddened. It is fit, answered he, that your\nown pleasure should determine you. It did, pardon me, madam, in your\njourney hither.\n\nShe reddened to her very ears. Your brother, ladies, has the reputation\nof being a polite man: bear witness to this instance of it. I am ashamed\nof myself!\n\nIf I am unpolite, madam, my sincerity will be my excuse; at least to my\nown heart.\n\nO, that inflexible heart! But, ladies, if the inhospitable Englishman\nrefuse his protection in his own country, to a foreign woman, of no mean\nquality; do not you, his sisters, despise her.\n\nThey, madam, and their lords, will render you every cheerful service.\nLet me request you, my sisters, to make England as agreeable as possible\nto this lady. She is of the first consideration in her own country: she\nwill be of such wherever she goes. My Lady Maffei deserves likewise your\nutmost respect. Then addressing himself to them; Ladies, said he,\nencourage my sisters: they will think themselves honoured by your\ncommands.\n\nThe two sisters confirmed, in an obliging manner, what their brother had\nsaid; and both ladies acknowledged themselves indebted to them for their\noffered friendship: but Lady Olivia seemed not at all satisfied with\ntheir brother: and it was with some difficulty he prevailed on her to\nreturn to the company, and drink coffee.\n\nI could not help reflecting, on occasion of this lady's conduct, that\nfathers and mothers are great blessings, to daughters, in particular,\neven when women grown. It is not every woman that will shine in a state\nof independency. Great fortunes are snares. If independent women escape\nthe machinations of men, which they have often a difficulty to do, they\nwill frequently be hurried by their own imaginations, which are said to\nbe livelier than those of men, though their judgments are supposed less,\ninto inconveniencies. Had Lady Olivia's parents or uncles lived, she\nhardly would have been permitted to make the tour of Europe: and not\nhaving so great a fortune to support vagaries, would have shone, as she\nis well qualified to do, in a dependent state, in Italy, and made some\nworthy man and herself happy.\n\nHad she a mind great enough to induce her to pity Clementina, I should\nhave been apt to pity her; for I saw her soul was disturbed. I saw that\nthe man she loved was not able to return her love: a pitiable case!--I\nsaw a starting tear now and then with difficulty dispersed. Once she\nrubbed her eye, and, being conscious of observation, said something had\ngot into it: so it had. The something was a tear. Yet she looked with\nhaughtiness, and her bosom swelled with indignation ill concealed.\n\nSir Charles repeated his recommendation of her to Lord L---- and Lord\nG----. They offered their best services: Lord W---- invited her and all\nof us to Windsor. Different parties of pleasure were talked of: but\nstill the enlivener of every party was not to be in any one of them. She\ntried to look pleased; but did not always succeed in the trial: an eye of\nlove and anger mingled was often cast upon the man whom everybody loved.\nHer bosom heaved, as it seemed sometimes, with indignation against\nherself: that was the construction which I made of some of her looks.\n\nLady Maffei, however, seemed pleased with the parties of pleasure talked\nof. She often directed herself to me in Italian. I answered her in it\nas well as I could. I do not talk it well: but as I am not an Italian,\nand little more than book-learned in it, (for it is a long time ago since\nI lost my grandpapa, who used to converse with me in it, and in French,)\nI was not scrupulous to answer in it. To have forborne, because I did\nnot excel in what I had no opportunity to excel in, would have been false\nmodesty, nearly bordering upon pride. Were any lady to laugh at me for\nnot speaking well her native tongue, I would not return the smile, were\nshe to be less perfect in mine, than I am in hers. But Lady Olivia made\nme a compliment on my faulty accent, when I acknowledged it to be so.\nSignora, said she, you shew us, that a pretty mouth can give beauty to a\ndefect. A master teaching you, added she, would perhaps find some fault;\nbut a friend conversing with you, must be in love with you for the very\nimperfection.\n\nSir Charles was generously pleased with the compliment, and made her a\nfine one on her observation.\n\nHe attended the two ladies to their lodgings in his coach. He owned to\nDr. Bartlett, that Lady Olivia was in tears all the way, lamenting her\ndisgrace in coming to England, just as he was quitting it; and wishing\nshe had stayed at Florence. She would have engaged him to correspond\nwith her: he excused himself. It was a very afflicting thing to him, he\ntold the doctor, to deny any request that was made to him, especially by\na lady: but he thought he ought in conscience and honour to forbear\ngiving the shadow of an expectation that might be improved into hope,\nwhere none was intended to be given. Heaven, he said, had, for laudable\nends, implanted such a regard in the sexes towards each other, that both\nman and woman who hoped to be innocent, could not be too circumspect in\nrelation to the friendships they were so ready to contract with each\nother. He thought he had gone a great way, in recommending an intimacy\nbetween her and his sisters, considering her views, her spirit, her\nperseverance, and the free avowal of her regard for him, and her menaces\non his supposed neglect of her. And yet, as she had come over, and he\nwas obliged to leave England so soon after her arrival; he thought he\ncould not do less: and he hoped his sisters, from whose example she might\nbe benefited, would, while she behaved prudently, cultivate her\nacquaintance.\n\nThe doctor tells me, that now Lady Olivia is so unexpectedly come hither\nin person, he thinks it best to decline giving me, as he had once\nintended, her history at large; but will leave so much of it as may\nsatisfy my curiosity, to be gathered from my own observation; and not\nonly from the violence and haughtiness of her temper, but from the\nfreedom of her declarations. He is sure, he said, that his patron will\nbe best pleased, that a veil should be thrown over the weaker part of her\nconduct; which, were it known, would indeed be glorious to Sir Charles,\nbut not so to the lady; who, however, never was suspected, even by her\nenemies, of giving any other man reason to tax her with a thought that\nwas not strictly virtuous: and she had engaged his pity and esteem, for\nthe sake of her other fine qualities, though she could not his love.\nBefore she saw him (which, it seems, was at the opera at Florence for the\nfirst time, when he had an opportunity to pay her some slight civilities)\nshe set all men at defiance.\n\nTo-morrow morning Sir Charles is to breakfast with me. My cousins and I\nare to dine at Lord L----'s. The Earl and Lady Gertrude are also to be\nthere. Lord W---- has been prevailed upon to stay, and be there also, as\nit is his nephew's last day in England.--'Last day in England!' O, my\nLucy! what words are those!--Lady L---- has invited Lady Olivia and her\naunt, at her own motion, Sir Charles (his time being so short) not\ndisapproving.\n\nI thank my grandmamma and aunt for their kind summons. I will soon set\nmy day: I will, my dear, soon set my day.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXVI\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nFRIDAY NOON, APRIL 14.\n\n\nNot five hours in bed; not one hour's rest for many uneasy nights before;\nI was stupid till Sir Charles came: I then was better. He inquired, with\ntender looks and voice, after my health; as if he thought I did not look\nwell.\n\nWe had some talk about Lord and Lady G----. He was anxious for their\nhappiness. He complimented me with hopes from my advice to her. Lord\nG----, he said, was a good-natured honest man. If he thought his sister\nwould make him unhappy, he should himself be so.\n\nI told him, that I dared to answer for her heart. My lord must bear with\nsome innocent foibles, and all would be well.\n\nWe then talked of Lady Olivia. He began the subject, by asking me my\nopinion of her. I said she was a very fine woman in her person; and that\nshe had an air of grandeur in her mien.\n\nAnd she has good qualities, said he; but she is violent in her passions.\nI am frequently grieved for her. She is a fine creature in danger of\nbeing lost, by being made too soon her own mistress.\n\nHe said not one word of his departure to-morrow morning: I could not\nbegin it; my heart would not let me; my spirits were not high: and I am\nafraid, if that key had been touched, I should have been too visibly\naffected. My cousins forbore, upon the same apprehension.\n\nHe was excessively tender and soothing to me, in his air, his voice, his\nmanner. I thought of what Emily said; that his voice, when he spoke of\nme, was the voice of love. Dear flattering girl!--But why did she\nflatter me?\n\nWe talked of her next. He spoke of her with the tenderness of a father.\nHe besought me to love her. He praised her heart.\n\nEmily, said I, venerates her guardian. She never will do any thing\ncontrary to his advice.\n\nShe is very young, replied he. She will be happy, madam, in yours. She\nboth loves and reverences you.\n\nI greatly love the dear Emily, sir. She and I shall be always sisters.\n\nHow happy am I, in your goodness to her! Permit me, madam, to enumerate\nto you my own felicities in that of my dearest friends.\n\nMr. Beauchamp is now in the agreeable situation I have long wished him to\nbe in. His prudence and obliging behaviour to his mother-in-law, have\nwon her. His father grants him every thing through her; and she, by this\nmeans, finds that power enlarged which she was afraid would be lessened,\nif the son were allowed to come over. How just is this reward of his\nfilial duty!\n\nThus, Lucy, did he give up the merit to his Beauchamp, which was solely\ndue to himself.\n\nLord W----, he hoped, would be soon one of the happiest men in England:\nand the whole Mansfield family had now fair prospects opening before\nthem.\n\nEmily [not he, you see] had made it the interest of her mother to be\nquiet.\n\nLord and Lady L---- gave him pleasure whenever he saw them, or thought of\nthem.\n\nDr. Bartlett was in heaven, while on earth. He would retire to his\nbeloved Grandison-hall, and employ himself in distributing, as objects\noffered, at least a thousand pounds of the three thousand bequeathed to\ncharitable uses by his late friend Mr. Danby. His sister's fortune was\npaid. His estates in both kingdoms were improving.--See, madam, said he,\nhow like the friend of my soul I claim your attention to affairs that are\nof consequence to myself; and in some of which your generosity of heart\nhas interested you.\n\nI bowed. Had I spoken, I had burst into tears. I had something arose in\nmy throat, I know not what. Still, thought I, excellent man, you are not\nyourself happy!--O pity! pity! Yet, Lucy, he plainly had been\nenumerating all these things, to take off from my mind that impression\nwhich I am afraid he too well knows it is affected with, from his\ndifficult situation.\n\nAnd now, madam, resumed he, how are all my dear and good friends, whom\nyou more particularly call yours?--I hope to have the honour of a\npersonal knowledge of them. When heard you of our good Mr. Deane? He is\nwell, I hope.\n\nVery well, Sir.\n\nYour grandmamma Shirley, that ornament of advanced years?\n\nI bowed: I dared not to trust my voice.\n\nYour excellent aunt, Selby?\n\nI bowed again.\n\nYour uncle, your Lucy, your Nancy: Happy family! All harmony! all love!\n--How do they?\n\nI wiped my eyes.\n\nIs there any service in my power to do them, or any of them? Command me,\ngood Miss Byron, if there be: my Lord W---- and I are one. Our influence\nis not small.--Make me still more happy, in the power of serving any one\nfavoured by you.\n\nYou oppress me, sir, by your goodness!--I cannot speak my grateful\nsensibilities.\n\nWill you, my dear Mr. Reeves, will you, madam, (to my cousin,) employ me\nin any way that I can be of use to you, either abroad or at home? Your\nacquaintance has given me great pleasure. To what a family of worthies\nhas this excellent young lady introduced me!\n\nO, sir! said Mrs. Reeves, tears running down her cheeks, that you were\nnot to leave people whom you have made so happy in the knowledge of the\nbest of men!\n\nIndispensable calls must be obeyed, my dear Mrs. Reeves. If we cannot be\nas happy as we wish, we will rejoice in the happiness we can have. We\nmust not be our own carvers.--But I make you all serious. I was\nenumerating, as I told you, my present felicities: I was rejoicing in\nyour friendships. I have joy; and, I presume to say, I will have joy.\nThere is a bright side in every event; I will not lose sight of it: and\nthere is a dark one; but I will endeavour to see it only with the eye of\nprudence, that I may not be involved by it at unawares. Who that is not\nreproached by his own heart, and is blessed with health, can grieve for\ninevitable evils; evils that can be only evils as we make them so?\nForgive my seriousness: my dear friends, you make me grave. Favour me, I\nbeseech you, my good Miss Byron, with one lesson: we shall be too much\nengaged, perhaps, by and by.\n\nHe led me (I thought it was with a cheerful air; but my cousins both say,\nhis eyes glistened) to the harpsichord: He sung unasked, but with a low\nvoice; and my mind was calmed. O, Lucy! How can I part with such a man?\nHow can I take my leave of him?--But perhaps he has taken his leave of me\nalready, as to the solemnity of it, in the manner I have recited.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXVII\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nSATURDAY MORNING, APRIL 15.\n\n\nO, Lucy, Sir Charles Grandison is gone! Gone indeed! He set out at\nthree this morning; on purpose, no doubt, to spare his sisters, and\nfriends, as well as himself, concern.\n\nWe broke not up till after two. Were I in the writing humour which I\nhave never known to fail me till now, I could dwell upon a hundred\nthings, some of which I can now only briefly mention.\n\nDinner-time yesterday passed with tolerable cheerfulness: every one tried\nto be cheerful. O what pain attends loving too well, and being too well\nbeloved! He must have pain, as well as we.\n\nLady Olivia was the most thoughtful, at dinnertime; yet poor Emily! Ah,\nthe poor Emily! she went out four or five times to weep; though only I\nperceived it.\n\nNobody was cheerful after dinner but Sir Charles. He seemed to exert\nhimself to be so. He prevailed on me to give them a lesson on the\nharpsichord. Lady L---- played: Lady G---- played: we tried to play, I\nshould rather say. He himself took the violin, and afterwards sat down\nto the harpsichord, for one short lesson. He was not known to be such a\nmaster: but he was long in Italy. Lady Olivia indeed knew him to be so.\nShe was induced to play upon the harpsichord: she surpassed every body.\nItaly is the land of harmony.\n\nAbout seven at night he singled me out, and surprised me greatly by what\nhe said. He told me, that Lady D---- had made him a visit. I was before\nlow: I was then ready to sink. She has asked me questions, madam.\n\nSir, sir! was all I could say.\n\nHe himself trembled as he spoke.--Alas! my dear, he surely loves me!\nHear how solemnly he spoke--God Almighty be your director, my dear Miss\nByron! I wish not more happiness to my own soul, than I do to you.--In\ndischarge of a promise made, I mention this visit to you: I might\notherwise have spared you, and myself--\n\nHe stopt there--Then resumed; for I was silent. I could not speak--Your\nfriends will be entreated for a man that loves you; a very worthy young\nnobleman.--I give you emotion, madam.--Forgive me.--I have performed my\npromise. He turned from me with a seeming cheerful air. How could he\nappear to be cheerful!\n\nWe made parties at cards. I knew not what I played. Emily sighed, and\ntears stole down her cheeks, as she played. O how she loves her\nguardian! Emily, I say--I don't know what I write!\n\nAt supper we were all very melancholy. Mr. Beauchamp was urgent to go\nabroad with him. He changed the subject, and gave him an indirect\ndenial, as I may call it, by recommending the two Italian ladies to his\nbest services.\n\nSir Charles, kind, good, excellent! wished to Lord L---- to have seen Mr.\nGrandison!--unworthy as that man has made himself of his attention.\n\nHe was a few moments in private with Lady Olivia. She returned to\ncompany with red eyes.\n\nPoor Emily watched an opportunity to be spoken to by him alone--So\ndiligently!--He led her to the window--About one o'clock it was--He held\nboth her hands. He called her, she says, his Emily. He charged her to\nwrite to him.\n\nShe could not speak; she could only sob; yet thought she had a thousand\nthings to say to him.\n\nHe contradicted not the hope his sisters and their lords had of his\nbreakfasting with them. They invited me; they invited the Italian\nladies: Lady L----, Lord L----, did go, in expectation: but Lady G----,\nwhen she found him gone, sent me and the Italian ladies word, that he\nwas. It would have been cruel, if she had not. How could he steal away\nso! I find, that he intended that his morning visit to me (as indeed I\nhalf-suspected) should be a taking leave of my cousins, and your Harriet.\nHow many things did he say then--How many questions ask--In tender woe--\nHe wanted to do us all service--He seemed not to know what to say--Surely\nhe hates not your poor Harriet--What struggles in his noble bosom!--But a\nman cannot complain: a man cannot ask for compassion, as a woman can.\nBut surely his is the gentlest of manly minds!\n\nWhen we broke up, he handed my cousin Reeves into her coach. He handed\nme. Mr. Reeves said, We see you again, Sir Charles, in the morning? He\nbowed. At handing me in, he sighed--He pressed my hand--I think he did--\nThat was all--He saluted nobody. He will not meet his Clementina as he\nparted with us.\n\nBut, I doubt not, Dr. Bartlett was in the secret.\n\n\nHe was. He has just been here. He found my eyes swelled. I had had no\nrest; yet knew not, till seven o'clock, that he was gone.\n\nIt was very good of the doctor to come: his visit soothed me: yet he took\nno notice of my red eyes. Nay, for that matter, Mrs. Reeves's eyes were\nswelled, as well as mine. Angel of a man! how is he beloved!\n\nThe doctor says, that his sisters, their lords, Lord W----, are in as\nmuch grief as if he were departed for ever--And who knows--But I will not\ntorment myself with supposing the worst: I will endeavour to bear in mind\nwhat he said yesterday morning to us, no doubt for an instruction, that\nhe would have joy.\n\nAnd did he then think that I should be so much grieved as to want such an\ninstruction?--And, therefore, did he vouchsafe to give it?--But, vanity,\nbe quiet--Lie down, hope--Hopelesness, take place! Clementina shall be\nhis. He shall be hers.\n\nYet his emotion, Lucy, at mentioning Lady D----'s visit--O! but that was\nonly owing to his humanity. He saw my emotion; and acknowledged the\ntenderest friendship for me! Ought I not to be satisfied with that? I\nam. I will be satisfied. Does he not love me with the love of mind?\nThe poor Olivia has not this to comfort herself with. The poor Olivia!\nif I see her sad and afflicted, how I shall pity her! All her\nexpectations frustrated; the expectations that engaged her to combat\ndifficulties, to travel, to cross many waters, and to come to England--to\ncome just time enough to take leave of him; he hastening on the wings of\nlove and compassion to a dearer, a deservedly dearer object, in the\ncountry she had quitted, on purpose to visit him in his--Is not hers a\nmore grievous situation than mine?--It is. Why, then, do I lament?\n\nBut here, Lucy, let me in confidence hint, what I have gathered from\nseveral intimations from Dr. Bartlett, though as tenderly made by him as\npossible, that had Sir Charles Grandison been a man capable of taking\nadvantage of the violence of a lady's passion for him, the unhappy Olivia\nwould not have scrupled, great, haughty, and noble, as she is, by birth\nand fortune, to have been his, without conditions, if she could not have\nbeen so with: The Italian world is of this opinion, at least. Had Sir\nCharles been a Rinaldo, Olivia had been an Armida.\n\nO that I could hope, for the honour of the sex, and of the lady who is so\nfine a woman, that the Italian world is mistaken!--I will presume that it\nis.\n\nMy good Dr. Bartlett, will you allow me to accuse you of a virtue too\nrigorous? That is sometimes the fault of very good people. You own that\nSir Charles has not, even to you, revealed a secret so disgraceful to\nher. You own, that he has only blamed her for having too little regard\nfor her reputation, and for the violence of her temper: yet how\npatiently, for one of such a temper, has she taken his departure, almost\non the day of her arrival! He could not have given her an opportunity to\nindicate to him a concession so criminal: she could not, if he had, have\nmade the overture. Wicked, wicked world! I will not believe you! And\nthe less credit shall you have with me, Italian world, as I have seen the\nlady. The innocent heart will be a charitable one. Lady Olivia is only\ntoo intrepid. Prosperity, as Sir Charles observed, has been a snare to\nher, and set her above a proper regard to her reputation.--Merciless\nworld! I do not love you. Dear Dr. Bartlett, you are not yet absolutely\nperfect! These hints of yours against Olivia, gathered from the\nmalevolence of the envious, are proofs (the first indeed that I have met\nwith) of your imperfection!\n\nExcuse me, Lucy: how have I run on! Disappointment has mortified me, and\nmade me good-natured.--I will welcome adversity, if it enlarge my\ncharity.\n\nThe doctor tells me, that Emily, with her half-broken heart, will be here\npresently. If I can be of comfort to her--But I want it myself, from the\nsame cause. We shall only weep over each other.\n\nAs I told you, the doctor, and the doctor only, knew of his setting out\nso early. He took leave of him. Happy Dr. Bartlett!--Yet I see by his\neyes, that this parting cost him some paternal tears.\n\nNever father better loved a son than this good man loves Sir Charles\nGrandison.\n\nSir Charles, it seems, had settled all his affairs three days before.\nHis servants were appointed.\n\nThe doctor tells me, that he had last week presented the elder Mr. Oldham\nwith a pair of colours, which he had purchased for him. Nobody had heard\nof this.\n\nLord W----, he says, is preparing for Windsor; Mr. Beauchamp for\nHampshire, for a few days; and then he returns to attend the commands of\nthe noble Italians.\n\nLady Olivia will soon have her equipage ready.\n\nShe will make a great appearance.--But Sir Charles Grandison will not be\nwith her. What is grandeur to a disturbed heart?\n\nThe Earl of G---- and Lady Gertrude are setting out for Hertfordshire.\nLord and Lady L---- talk of retiring, for a few weeks, to Colnebrook: the\nDoctor is preparing for Grandison-hall; your poor Harriet for\nNorthamptonshire--Bless me, my dear, what a dispersion!--But Lord W----'s\nnuptials will collect some of them together at Windsor.\n\n\n***\n\n\nEmily, the dear weeping girl! is just come. She is with my cousins. She\nexpects my permission for coming up to me. Imagine us weeping over each\nother; praying for, blessing the guardian of us both. Your imagination\ncannot form a scene too tender.\n\nAdieu, my Lucy.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXVIII\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nSUNDAY, APRIL 16.\n\n\nO, what a blank, my dear!--but I need not say what I was going to say.\nPoor Emily!--But, to mention her grief, is to paint my own.\n\nLord W---- went to Windsor yesterday.\n\nA very odd behaviour of Lady Olivia. Mr. Beauchamp went yesterday, and\noffered to attend her to any of the public places, at her pleasure; in\npursuance of Sir Charles's reference to him, to do all in his power to\nmake England agreeable to her: and she thought fit to tell him before her\naunt, that she thanked him for his civility; but she should not trouble\nhim during her stay in England. She had gentlemen in her train; and one\nof them had been in England before--\n\nHe left her in disgust.\n\nLady L---- making her a visit in the evening, she told her of Mr.\nBeauchamp's offer, and of her answer. The gentleman, said she, is a\npolite and very agreeable man; and this made me treat his kind offer with\nabruptness: for I can hardly doubt your brother's view in it. I scorn\nhis view: and if I were sure of it, perhaps I should find a way to make\nhim repent of the indignity. Lady L---- was sure, she said, that neither\nher brother, nor Mr. Beauchamp, had any other views than to make England\nas agreeable to her as possible.\n\nBe this as it may, madam, said she, I have no service for Mr. Beauchamp:\nbut if your Ladyship, your sister, and your two lords, will allow me to\ncultivate your friendship, you will do me honour. Dr. Bartlett's company\nwill be very agreeable to me likewise, as often as he will give it me.\nTo Miss Jervois I lay some little claim. I would have had her for my\ncompanion in Italy; but your cruel brother--No more, however, of him.\nYour English beauty too, I admire her: but, poor young creature, I admire\nher the more, because I can pity her. I should think myself very happy\nto be better acquainted with her.\n\nLady L---- made her a very polite answer for herself and her sister, and\ntheir lords: but told her, that I was very soon to set out for my own\nabode in Northamptonshire; and that Dr. Bartlett had some commissions,\nwhich would oblige him, in a day or two, to go to Sir Charles's seat in\nthe country. She herself offered to attend her to Windsor, and to every\nother place, at her command.\n\nLady L---- took notice of her wrist being bound round with a broad black\nribband, and asked, If it were hurt? A kind of sprain, said she. But\nyou little imagine how it came; and must not ask.\n\nThis made Lady L---- curious. And Olivia requesting that Emily might be\nallowed to breakfast with her as this morning; she has bid the dear girl\nendeavour to know how it came, if it fell in her way: for Olivia\nreddened, and looked up, with a kind of consciousness, to Lady L----,\nwhen she told her that she must not ask questions about it.\n\nLady G---- is very earnest with me to give into the town diversions for a\nmonth to come: but I have now no desire in my heart so strong, as to\nthrow myself at the feet of my grandmamma and aunt; and to be embraced by\nmy Lucy and Nancy, and all my Northamptonshire friends.\n\nI am only afraid of my uncle. He will rally his Harriet; yet only, I\nknow, in hopes to divert her, and us all: but my jesting days are over:\nmy situation will not bear it. Yet if it will divert himself, let him\nrally.\n\nI shall be so much importuned to stay longer than I ought, or will stay,\nthat I may as well fix a peremptory day at once. Will you, my ever\nindulgent friends, allow me to set out for Selby-house on Friday\nnext? Not on a Sunday, as Lady Betty Williams advises, for fear of the\nodious waggons. But I have been in a different school. Sir Charles\nGrandison, I find, makes it a tacit rule with him, Never to begin a\njourney on a Sunday; nor, except when in pursuit of works of mercy or\nnecessity, to travel in time of divine service. And this rule he\nobserved last Sunday, though he reached us here in the evening. O my\ngrandmamma! How much is he, what you all are, and ever have been!--But\nhe is now pursuing a work of mercy. God succeed to him the end of his\npursuit!\n\nBut why tacit? you will ask. Is Sir Charles Grandison ashamed to make an\nopen appearance in behalf of his Christian duties? He is not. For\ninstance; I have never seen him sit down at his own table, in the absence\nof Dr. Bartlett, or some other clergyman, but he himself says grace; and\nthat with such an easy dignity, as commands every one's reverence; and\nwhich is succeeded by a cheerfulness that looks as if he were the better\npleased for having shewn a thankful heart.\n\nDr. Bartlett has also told me, that he begins and ends every day, either\nin his chamber, or in his study, in a manner worthy of one who is in\nearnest in his Christian profession. But he never frights gay company\nwith grave maxims. I remember, one day, Mr. Grandison asked him, in his\nabsurd way, Why he did not preach to his company now and then? Faith,\nSir Charles, said he, if you did, you would reform many a poor ignorant\nsinner of us; since you could do it with more weight, and more certainty\nof attention, than any parson in Christendom.\n\nIt would be an affront, said Sir Charles, to the understanding, as well\nas education, of a man who took rank above a peasant, in such a country\nas this, to seem to question whether he knew his general duties, or not,\nand the necessity of practising what he knew of them. If he should be at\na loss, he may once a week be reminded, and his heart kept warm. Let you\nand me, cousin Everard, shew our conviction by our practice; and not\ninvade the clergyman's province.\n\nI remember that Mr. Grandison shewed his conviction by his blushes; and\nby repeating the three little words, You and me! Sir Charles.\n\n\n***\n\n\nSUNDAY EVENING.\n\nO my dear friends! I have a strange, a shocking piece of intelligence to\ngive you! Emily has just been with me in tears: she begged to speak with\nme in private. When we were alone, she threw her arms about my neck: Ah,\nmadam! said she, I am come to tell you, that there is a person in the\nworld that I hate, and must and will hate, as long as I live. It is Lady\nOlivia.--Take me down with you into Northamptonshire, and never let me\nsee her more.\n\nI was surprised.\n\nO madam! I have found out, that she would, on Thursday last, have killed\nmy guardian.\n\nI was astonished, Lucy.\n\nThey retired together, you know, madam: my guardian came from her, his\nface in a glow; and he sent in his sister to her, and went not in himself\ntill afterwards. She would have had him put off his journey. She was\nenraged because he would not; and they were high together; and, at last,\nshe pulled out of her stays, in fury, a poniard, and vowed to plunge it\ninto his heart. He should never, she said, see his Clementina more. He\nwent to her. Her heart failed her. Well it might, you know, madam. He\nseized her hand. He took it from her. She struggled, and in struggling\nher wrist was hurt; that's the meaning of the broad black ribband!--\nWicked creature! to have such a thought in her heart!--He only said, when\nhe had got it from her, Unhappy, violent woman! I return not this\ninstrument of mischief! You will have no use for it in England--And\nwould not let her have it again.\n\nI shuddered. O my dear, said I, he has been a sufferer, we are told, by\ngood women; but this is not a good woman. But can it be true? Who\ninformed you of it?\n\nLady Maffei herself. She thought that Sir Charles must have spoken of\nit: and when she found he had not, she was sorry she had, and begged I\nwould not tell any body: but I could not keep it from you. And she says,\nthat Lady Olivia is grieved on the remembrance of it; and arraigns\nherself and her wicked passion; and the more, for his noble forgiveness\nof her on the spot, and recommending her afterwards to the civilities of\nhis sisters, and their lords. But I hate her, for all that.\n\nPoor unhappy Olivia! said I. But what, my Emily, are we women, who\nshould be the meekest and tenderest of the whole animal creation, when we\ngive way to passion! But if she is so penitent, let not the shocking\nattempt be known to his sisters, or their lords. I may take the liberty\nof mentioning it, in strict confidence, [observe that, Lucy,] to those\nfrom whom I keep not any secret: but let it not be divulged to any of the\nrelations of Sir Charles. Their detestation of her, which must follow,\nwould not be concealed; and the unhappy creature, made desperate, might--\nWho knows what she might do?\n\nThe dear girl ran on upon what might have been the consequence, and what\na loss the world would have had, if the horrid fact had been perpetrated.\nLady Maffei told her, however, that had not her heart relented, she might\nhave done him mischief; for he was too rash in approaching her. She fell\ndown on her knees to him, as soon as he had wrested the poniard from her.\nI forgive, and pity you, madam, said he, with an air that had, as Olivia\nand her aunt have recollected since, both majesty and compassion in it:\nbut, against her entreaty, he would withdraw: yet, at her request, sent\nin Lady L---- to her; and, going into his study, told not even Dr.\nBartlett of it, though he went to him there immediately.\n\nFrom the consciousness of this violence, perhaps, the lady was more\ntemperate afterwards, even to the very time of his departure.\n\n\n***\n\n\nLord bless me, what shall I do? Lady D---- has sent a card to let me\nknow, that she will wait upon Mrs. Reeves and me to-marrow to breakfast.\nShe comes, no doubt, to tell me, that Sir Charles having no thoughts of\nHarriet Byron, Lord D---- may have hopes of succeeding with her: and,\nperhaps, her ladyship will plead Sir Charles's recommendation and\ninterest in Lord D----'s favour. But should this plea be made, good\nHeaven give me patience! I am afraid I shall be uncivil to this\nexcellent woman.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXIX\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nMONDAY, APRIL 17.\n\n\nThe countess is just gone.\n\nMr. Reeves was engaged before to breakfast with Lady Betty Williams; and\nwe were only Mrs. Reeves, Lady D----, and I.\n\nMy heart ached at her entrance; and every moment still more, as we were\nat breakfast. Her looks, I thought, had such particular kindness and\nmeaning in them, as seemed to express, 'You have no hopes, Miss Byron,\nany where else; and I will have you to be mine.'\n\nBut my suspense was over the moment the tea-table was removed. I see\nyour confusion, my dear, said the countess: [Mrs. Reeves, you must not\nleave us;] and I have sat in pain for you, as I saw it increase. By this\nI know that Sir Charles Grandison has been as good as his word. Indeed I\ndoubted not but he would. I don't wonder, my dear, that you love him.\nHe is the finest man in his manners, as well as person, that I ever saw.\nA woman of virtue and honour cannot but love him. But I need not praise\nhim to you; nor to you, neither, Mrs. Reeves; I see that. Now you must\nknow, proceeded she, that there is an alliance proposed for my son, of\nwhich I think very well; but still should have thought better, had I\nnever seen you, my dear. I have talked to my lord about it: you know I\nam very desirous to have him married. His answer was; I never can think\nof any proposal of this nature, while I have any hope that I can make\nmyself acceptable to Miss Byron.\n\nWhat think you, my lord, said I, if I should directly apply to Sir\nCharles Grandison, to know his intentions; and whether he has any hopes\nof obtaining her favour? He is said to be the most unreserved of men.\nHe knows our characters to be as unexceptionable as his own; and that our\nalliance cannot be thought a discredit to the first family in the\nkingdom. It is a free question, I own; as I am unacquainted with him by\nperson: but he is such a man, that methinks I can take pleasure in\naddressing myself to him on any subject.\n\nMy lord smiled at the freedom of my motion; but, not disapproving it, I\ndirectly went to Sir Charles; and, after due compliments, told him my\nbusiness.\n\nThe countess stopt. She is very penetrating. She looked at us both.\n\nWell, madam, said my cousin, with an air of curiosity--Pray, your\nladyship--\n\nI could not speak for very impatience--\n\nI never heard in my life, said the countess, such a fine character of any\nmortal, as he gave you. He told me of his engagements to go abroad as\nthe very next day. He highly extolled the lady for whose sake,\nprincipally, he was obliged to go abroad; and he spoke as highly of a\nbrother of hers, whom he loved as if he were his own brother; and\nmentioned very affectionately the young lady's whole family.\n\n'God only knows,' said he, 'what may be my destiny!--As generosity, as\njustice, or rather as Providence, leads, I will follow.'\n\nAfter he had generously opened his heart, proceeded the countess, I asked\nhim, If he had any hope, should the foreign lady recover her health, of\nher being his?\n\n'I can promise myself nothing,' said he. 'I go over without one selfish\nhope. If the lady recover her health, and her brother can be amended in\nhis, by the assistance I shall carry over with me, I shall have joy\ninexpressible. To Providence I leave the rest. The result cannot be in\nmy own power.'\n\nThen, sir, proceeded the countess, you cannot in honour be under any\nengagements to Miss Byron?\n\nI arose from my seat. Whither, my dear?--I have done, if I oppress you.\nI moved my chair behind hers, but so close to hers, that I leaned on the\nback of it, my face hid, and my eyes running over. She stood up. Sit\ndown again, madam, said I, and proceed--Pray proceed. You have excited\nmy curiosity. Only let me sit here, unheeded, behind you.\n\nPray, madam, said Mrs. Reeves, (burning also with curiosity, as she has\nsince owned,) go on; and indulge my cousin in her present seat. What\nanswer did Sir Charles return?\n\nMy dear love, said the countess, (sitting down, as I had requested,) let\nme first be answered one question. I would not do mischief.\n\nYou cannot do mischief, madam, replied I. What is your ladyship's\nquestion?\n\nHas Sir Charles Grandison ever directly made his addresses to you, my\ndear?\n\nNever, madam.\n\nIt is not for want of love, I dare aver, that he has not. But thus he\nanswered my question: 'I should have thought myself the unworthiest of\nmen, knowing the difficulties of my own situation, how great soever were\nthe temptation from Miss Byron's merit if I had sought to engage her\naffections.'\n\n[O, Lucy! How nobly is his whole conduct towards me justified!]\n\n'She has, madam,' (proceeded the countess, in his words,) 'a prudence\nthat I never knew equalled in a woman so young. With a frankness of\nmind, to which hardly ever young lady before her had pretensions, she has\nsuch a command of her affections, that no man, I dare say, will ever have\na share in them, till he has courted her favour by assiduities which\nshall convince her that he has no heart but for her.'\n\nO my Lucy! What an honour to me would these sentiments be, if I deserved\nthem! And can Sir Charles Grandison think I do?--I hope so. But if he\ndoes, how much am I indebted to his favourable, his generous opinion!\nWho knows but I have reason to rejoice, rather than to regret, as I used\nto do, his frequent absences from Colnebrook?\n\nThe countess proceeded.\n\nThen, sir, you will not take it amiss, if my son, by his assiduities, can\nprevail upon Miss Byron to think that he has merit, and that his heart is\nwholly devoted to her.\n\n'Amiss, madam!--No!--In justice, in honour, I cannot. May Miss Byron be,\nas she deserves to be, one of the happiest women on earth in her\nnuptials. I have heard a great character of Lord D----. He has a very\nlarge estate. He may boast of his mother--God forbid, that I, a man\ndivided in myself, not knowing what I can do, hardly sometimes what I\nought to do, should seek to involve in my own uncertainties the friend I\nrevere; the woman I so greatly admire: her beauty so attracting; so\nproper therefore for her to engage a generous protector in the married\nstate.'\n\nGenerous man! thought I. O how my tears ran down my cheeks, as I hid my\nface behind the countess's chair!\n\nBut will you allow me, sir, proceeded the countess, to ask you, were you\nfreed from all your uncertainties--\n\n'Permit me, madam,' interrupted he, 'to spare you the question you were\ngoing to put. As I know not what will be the result of my journey\nabroad, I should think myself a very selfish man, and a very\ndishonourable one to two ladies of equal delicacy and worthiness, if I\nsought to involve, as I hinted before, in my own uncertainties, a young\nlady whose prudence and great qualities must make herself and any man\nhappy, whom she shall favour with her hand.\n\n'To be still more explicit,' proceeded he, With what face could I look up\nto a woman of honour and delicacy, such a one as the lady before whom I\nnow stand, if I could own a wish, that, while my honour has laid me under\nobligation to one lady, if she shall be permitted to accept of me, I\nshould presume to hope, that another, no less worthy, would hold her\nfavour for me suspended, till she saw what would be the issue of the\nfirst obligation? No, madam; I could sooner die, than offer such\nindignity to both! I am fettered, added he; but Miss Byron is free: and\nso is the lady abroad. My attendance on her at this time, is\nindispensable; but I make not any conditions for myself--My reward will\nbe in the consciousness of having discharged the obligations that I think\nmyself under, as a man of honour.'\n\nThe countess's voice changed in repeating this speech of his: and she\nstopt to praise him; and then went on.\n\nYou are THE man, indeed, sir!--But then give me leave to ask you, as I\nthink it very likely that you will be married before your return to\nEngland, Whether, now that you have been so good as to speak favourably\nof my son, and that you call Miss Byron sister, you will oblige him with\na recommendation to that sister?\n\n'The Countess of D---- shews, by this request, her value for a young lady\nwho deserves it; and the more, for its being, I think, (excuse me, madam)\na pretty extraordinary one. But what a presumption would it be in me, to\nsuppose that I had SUCH an interest with Miss Byron, when she has\nrelations as worthy of her, as she is of them?'\n\nYou may guess, my dear, said the countess, that I should not have put\nthis question, but as a trial of his heart. However, I asked his pardon;\nand told him, that I would not believe he gave it me, except he would\npromise to mention to Miss Byron, that I had made him a visit on this\nsubject. [Methinks, Lucy, I should have been glad that he had not let me\nknow that he was so forgiving!]\n\nAnd now, my dear, said the lady, let me turn about. She did; and put one\narm round my neck, and with my own handkerchief wiped my eyes, and kissed\nmy cheek; and when she saw me a little recovered, she addressed me as\nfollows:\n\nNow, my good young creature, [O that you would let me call you daughter\nin my way! for I think I must always call you so, whether you do, or not]\nlet me ask you, as if I were your real mother, 'Have you any expectation\nthat Sir Charles Grandison will be yours?'\n\nDear madam, is not this as hard a question to be put to me, as that which\nyou put to him?\n\nYes, my dear--full as hard. And I am as ready to ask your pardon, as I\nwas his, if you are really displeased with me for putting it. Are you,\nMiss Byron? Excuse me, Mrs. Reeves, for thus urging your lovely cousin:\nI am at least entitled to the excuse Sir Charles Grandison made for me,\nthat it is a demonstration of my value for her.\n\nI have declared, madam, returned I, and it is from my heart, that I think\nhe ought to be the husband of the lady abroad: and though I prefer him to\nall the men I ever saw, yet I have resolved, if possible, to conquer the\nparticular regard I have for him. He has in a very noble manner offered\nme his friendship, so long as it may be accepted without interfering with\nany other attachments on my part: and I will be satisfied with that.\n\nA friendship so pure, replied the countess, as that of such a man, is\nconsistent with any other attachments. My Lord D---- will, with his\nwhole soul, contribute all in his power to strengthen it: he admires Sir\nCharles Grandison: he would think it a double honour to be acquainted\nwith him through you. Dearest Miss Byron, take another worthy young man\ninto your friendship, but with a tenderer name: I shall then claim a\nfourth place in it for myself. O my dear! What a quadruple knot will\nyou tie!\n\nYour ladyship does me too much honour, was all I could just then reply.\n\nI must have an answer, my dear: I will not take up with a compliment.\n\nThis, then, madam, is my answer--I hope I am an honest creature: I have\nnot a heart to give.\n\nThen you have expectations, my dear.--Well, I will call you mine, if I\ncan. Never did I think that I could have made the proposal, that I am\ngoing to make you: but in my eyes, as well as in my lord's, you are an\nincomparable young woman.--This is it.--We will not think of the alliance\nproposed to us (it is yet but a proposal, and to which we have not\nreturned any answer) till we see what turn the affair Sir Charles is gone\nupon, takes. You once said, you could prefer my son to any of the men\nthat had hitherto applied to you for your favour. Your affections to Sir\nCharles were engaged before you knew us. Will you allow my son this\npreference, which will be the first preference, if Sir Charles engages\nhimself abroad?\n\nYour ladyship surprises me: shall I not improve by the example you have\njust now set before me? Who was it that said (and a man too) 'With what\nface could I look up to a woman of honour and delicacy, such a one as the\nlady before whom I now stand, if I could own a wish, that, while' my\nheart leaned to one person, I should think of keeping another in suspense\ntill I saw whether I could or could not be the other's? 'No, madam, I\nwould sooner die,' as Sir Charles said, 'than offer such an indignity to\nboth.' But I know, madam, that you only made this proposal, as you did\nanother to Sir Charles Grandison, as a trial of my heart.\n\nUpon my word, my dear, I should, I think, be glad to be entitled to such\nan excuse: but I was really in earnest; and now take a little shame to\nmyself.\n\nWhat charming ingenuousness in this lady!\n\nShe clasped her arms about me, and kissed my cheek again. I have but one\nplea, said she, to make for myself; I could not have fallen into such an\nerror, (the example so recently given to the contrary,) had I not wished\nyou to be, before any woman in the world, Countess of D----. Noble\ncreature! No title can give you dignity. May your own wishes be\ngranted!\n\nMy cousin's eyes ran over with pleasure.\n\nThe countess asked, When I returned to Northamptonshire? I told her my\nintention. She charged me to see her first. But can tell you, said she,\nmy lord shall not be present when you come: not once more will I trust\nhim in your company; and if he should steal a visit, unknown to me, let\nnot your cousin see him, Mrs. Reeves. He does indeed admire you, love.\n\nI acknowledged, with a grateful heart, her goodness to me. She engaged\nme to correspond with her when I got home. Her commands were an honour\ndone me, that I could not refuse myself. Her son, she smilingly told me,\nshould no more see my letters, than my person.\n\nAt her going away--I will tell you one thing, said she: I never before,\nin a business which my heart was set upon, was so effectually silenced by\na precedent produced by myself in the same conversation. I came with an\nassurance of success. When our hearts are engaged in a hope, we are apt\nto think every step we take for the promoting it, reasonable: Our\npassions, my dear, will evermore run away with our judgment. But, now I\nthink of it, I must, when I say our, make two exceptions; one for you,\nand one for Sir Charles Grandison.\n\nBut, Lucy, tell me--May I, do you think, explain the meaning of the word\nSELFISH used by Sir Charles in the conclusion of the library conference\nat Colnebrook, (and which puzzled me then to make out,) by his\ndisclaiming of selfishness in the conversation with the countess above\nrecited? If I may, what an opening of his heart does that word give in\nmy favour, were he at liberty? Does it not look, my dear, as if his\nhonour checked him, when his love would have prompted him to wish me to\npreserve my heart disengaged till his return from abroad? Nor let it be\nsaid, that it was dishonourable in him to have such a thought, as it was\nchecked and overcome; and as it was succeeded by such an emotion, that he\nwas obliged to depart abruptly from me.--Let me repeat the words--You may\nnot have my letter at hand which relates that affecting address to me;\nand it is impossible for me, while I have memory, to forget them. He had\njust concluded his brief history of Clementina--'And now, madam, what can\nI say?--Honour forbids me!--Yet honour bids me--Yet I cannot be unjust,\nungenerous, selfish!'--If I may flatter myself, Lucy, that he did love me\nwhen he said this, and that he had a conflict in his noble heart between\nthe love on one side so hopeless, (for I could not forgive him, if he did\nnot love, as well as pity, Clementina,) and on the other not so hopeless,\nwere there to have been no bar between--Shall we not pity him for the\narduous struggle? Shall we not see that honour carried it, even in\nfavour of the hopeless against the hopeful, and applaud him the more for\nbeing able to overcome? How shall we call virtue by its name, if it be\nnot tried; and if it hath no contest with inclination?\n\nIf I am a vain self-flatterer, tell me, chide me, Lucy; but allow me,\nhowever, at the same time, this praise, if I can make good my claim to\nit, that my conquest of my passion is at least as glorious for me, as his\nis for him, were he to love me ever so well; since I can most sincerely,\nhowever painfully, subscribe to the preference which honour, love,\ncompassion, unitedly, give to CLEMENTINA.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXX\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nMONDAY NIGHT.\n\n\nMy cousins and I, by invitation, supped with Lady G---- this evening.\nLord and Lady L---- were there; Lady Olivia also, and Lady Maffei.\n\nI have set them all into a consternation, as they expressed themselves,\nby my declaration of leaving London on my return home early on Friday\nmorning next. I knew, that were I to pass the whole summer here, I must\nbe peremptory at last. The two sisters vow, that I shall not go so soon.\nThey say, that I have seen so few of the town diversions--Town\ndiversions, Lucy!--I have had diversion enough, of one sort!--But in your\narms, my dear friends, I shall have consolation--And I want it.\n\nI have great regrets, and shall have hourly more, as the day approaches,\non the leaving of such dear and obliging friends: but I am determined.\n\nMy cousin's coach will convey me to Dunstable; and there, I know, I shall\nmeet with my indulgent uncle, or your brother. I would not have it\npublicly known, because of the officious gentlemen in the neighbourhood.\n\nDr. Bartlett intended to set out for Grandison-hall to-morrow: but from\nthe natural kindness of his heart he has suspended his journey to\nThursday next. No consideration, therefore, shall detain me, if I am\nwell.\n\nMy cousins are grieved: they did not expect that I would be a word and a\nblow, as they phrase it.\n\nLady Olivia expressed herself concerned, that she, in particular, was to\nlose me. She had proposed great pleasure, she said, in the parties she\nshould make in my company. But, after what Emily told me, she appears to\nme as a Medusa; and were I to be thought by her a formidable rival, I\nmight have as much reason to be afraid of the potion, as the man she\nloves of the poniard. Emily has kept the secret from every body but me.\nAnd I rely on the inviolable secrecy of all you, my friends.\n\nLord and Lady L---- had designed to go to Colnebrook to-morrow, or at my\nday, having hopes of getting me with them: but now, they say, they will\nstay in town till they can see whether I am to be prevailed upon, or will\nbe obdurate.\n\nLady Olivia inquired after the distance of Northamptonshire. She will\nmake the tour of England, she says, and visit me there. I was obliged to\nsay I should take her visit as an honour.\n\nWicked politeness! Of how many falsehoods dost thou make the people, who\nare called polite, guilty!\n\nBut there is one man in the world, who is remarkable for his truth, yet\nis unquestionably polite. He censures not others for complying with\nfashions established by custom; but he gives not in to them. He never\nperverts the meaning of words. He never, for instance, suffers his\nservants to deny him, when he is at home. If he is busy, he just finds\ntime to say he is, to unexpected visiters; and if they will stay, he\nturns them over to his sisters, to Dr. Bartlett, to Emily, till he can\nattend them. But then he has always done so. Every one knows that he\nlives to his own heart, and they expect it of him; and when they can have\nhis company, they have double joy in the ease and cheerfulness that\nattend his leisure: they then have him wholly. And he can be the more\npolite, as the company then is all his business.\n\nSir Charles might the better do so, as he came over so few months ago,\nafter so long an absence; and his reputation for politeness was so well\nestablished, that people rather looked for rules from him, than a\nconformity to theirs.\n\nHis denials of complimenting Lady Olivia (though she was but just arrived\nin his native country, where she never was before) with the suspending of\nhis departure for one week, or but for one day--Who but he could have\ngiven them? But he was convinced, that it was right to hasten away, for\nthe sake of Clementina and his Jeronymo; and that it would have been\nwrong to shew Olivia, even for her own sake, that in such a competition\nshe had consequence with him; and all her entreaties, all her menaces,\nthe detested poniard in her hand, could not shake his steady soul, and\nmake him delay his well-settled purpose.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXI\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nTUESDAY MORNING, APRIL 18.\n\n\nThis naughty Lady G----! She is excessively to blame. Lord L---- is out\nof patience with her. So is Lady L----. Emily says, she loves her\ndearly; but she does not love her ways. Lord G----, as Emily tells me,\ntalks of coming to me; the cause of quarrel supposed to be not great: but\ntrifles, insisted upon, make frequently the widest breaches. Whatever it\nbe, it is between themselves: and neither cares to tell: but Lord and\nLady L---- are angry with her, for the ludicrous manner in which she\ntreats him.\n\nThe misunderstanding happened after my cousin and I left them last night.\nI was not in spirits, and declined staying to cards. Lady Olivia and her\naunt went away at the same time. Whist was the game. Lord and Lady\nL----, Dr. Bartlett and Emily, were cast in. In the midst of their play,\nLady G---- came hurrying down stairs to them, warbling an air. Lord\nG---- followed her, much disturbed. Madam, I must tell you, said he--Why\nMUST, my lord? I don't bid you.\n\nSit still, child, said she to Emily; and took her seat behind her--Who\nwins? Who loses?\n\nLord G---- walked about the room--Lord and Lady L---- were unwilling to\ntake notice, hoping it would go off; for there had been a few\nlivelinesses on her side at dinner-time, though all was serene at supper.\n\nDr. Bartlett offered her his cards. She refused them--No, doctor, said\nshe, I will play my own cards: I shall have enough to do to play them\nwell.\n\nAs you manage it, so you will, madam, said Lord G----.\n\nDon't expose yourself, my lord: we are before company. Lady L----, you\nhave nothing but trumps in your hand.\n\nLet me say a word or two to you, madam, said Lord G---- to her.\n\nI am all obedience, my lord.\n\nShe arose. He would have taken her hand: she put it behind her.\n\nNot your hand, madam?\n\nI can't spare it.\n\nHe flung from her, and went out of the room.\n\nLord bless me, said she, returning to the card-table with a gay\nunconcern, what strange passionate creatures are these men!\n\nCharlotte, said Lady L----, I wonder at you.\n\nThen I give you joy--\n\nWhat do you mean, sister?--\n\nWe women love wonder, and the wonderful!\n\nSurely, Lady G----, said Lord L----, you are wrong.\n\nI give your lordship joy, too.\n\nOn what?\n\nThat my sister is always right.\n\nIndeed, madam, were I Lord G----, I should have no patience.\n\nA good hint for you, Lady L----. I hope you will take this for a\nwarning, and be good.\n\nWhen I behave as you do, Charlotte--\n\nI understand you, Lady L----, you need not speak out--Every one in their\nway.\n\nYou would not behave thus, were my brother--\n\nPerhaps not.\n\nDear Charlotte, you are excessively wrong.\n\nSo I think, returned she.\n\nWhy then do you not--\n\nMend, Lady L----? All in good time.\n\nHer woman came in with a message, expressing her lord's desire to see\nher.--The deuce is in these men! They will neither be satisfied with us,\nnor without us. But I am all obedience: no vow will I break--And out she\nwent.\n\nLord G---- not returning presently, and Lord and Lady L----'s chariot\nbeing come, they both took this opportunity, in order to shew their\ndispleasure, to go away without taking leave of their sister. Dr.\nBartlett retired to his apartment. And when Lady G---- came down, she\nwas surprised, and a little vexed, to find only Emily there. Lord G----\ncame in at another door--Upon my word, my Lord, this is strange behaviour\nin you: you fright away, with your husband-like airs, all one's company.\n\nGood God!--I am astonished at you, madam.\n\nWhat signifies your astonishment?--when you have scared every body out of\nthe house.\n\nI, madam!\n\nYou, sir! Yes, you!--Did you not lord it over me in my dressing-room?--\nTo be easy and quiet, did I not fly to our company in the drawing-room?\nDid you not follow me there--with looks--very pretty looks for a\nnew-married man, I assure you! Then did you not want to take me aside--\nWould not anybody have supposed it was to express your sorrow for your\nodd behaviour? Was I not all obedience?--Did you not, with very mannish\nairs, slight me for my compliance, and fly out of the room? All the\ncompany could witness the calmness with which I returned to them, that\nthey might not be grieved for me; nor think our misunderstanding a deep\none. Well, then, when your stomach came down, as I supposed, you sent\nfor me out: no doubt, thought I, to express his concern now.--I was all\nobedience again.\n\nAnd did I not beseech you, madam--\n\nBeseech me, my lord!--Yes--But with such looks!--I married, sir, let me\ntell you, a man with another face--See, see, Emily--He is gone again.--\n\nMy lord flew out of the room in a rage.--O these men, my dear! said she\nto Emily.\n\nI know, said Emily, what I could have answered, if I dared: but it is ill\nmeddling, as I have heard say, between man and wife.\n\nEmily says, the quarrel was not made up; but was carried higher still in\nthe morning.\n\nShe had but just finished her tale, when the following billet was brought\nme, from Lady G----:\n\n\n***\n\n\nTUESDAY MORNING.\n\n\nHarriet,\n\nIf you love me, if you pity me, come hither this instant: I have great\nneed of your counsel. I am resolved to be unmarried; and therefore\nsubscribe myself by the beloved name of\n\nCHARLOTTE GRANDISON.\n\n\n***\n\n\nI instantly dispatched the following:\n\nI Know no such person as Charlotte Grandison. I love Lady G----, but can\npity only her lord. I will not come near you. I have no counsel to give\nyou, but that you will not jest away your own happiness.\n\nHARRIET BYRON.\n\n\n***\n\n\nIn half an hour after, came a servant from Lady G---- with the following\nletter:\n\nSo, then, I have made a blessed hand of wedlock. My brother gone: my man\nexcessive unruly: Lord and Lady L---- on his side, without inquiring into\nmerits, or demerits: lectured by Dr. Bartlett's grave face: Emily\nstanding aloof; her finger in her eye: and now my Harriet renouncing me:\nand all in one week!\n\nWhat can I do?--War seems to be declared: and will you not turn\nmediatrix?--You won't, you say. Let it alone. Nevertheless, I will lay\nthe whole matter before you.\n\nIt was last night, the week from the wedding-day not completed, that Lord\nG---- thought fit to break into my retirement without my leave--By the\nway, he was a little impertinent at dinner-time; but that I passed\nover--\n\nWhat boldness is this? said I--Pray, Sir, begone--Why leave you your\ncompany below?\n\nI come, my dearest life! to make a request to you.\n\nThe man began with civility enough, had he had a little less of his\nodious rapture; for he flung his arms about me, Jenny in presence. A\nhusband's fondness is enough to ruin these girls. Don't you think,\nHarriet, that there is an immorality in it, before them?\n\nI refuse your request, be it what it will. How dare you invade me in my\nretirement?--You may believe, that I intended not to stay long above, my\nsister below. Does the ceremony, so lately past, authorize want of\nbreeding?\n\nWant of breeding, madam!--And he did so stare!\n\nLeave me, this instant!--I looked good-natured, I suppose, in my anger;\nfor he declared he would not; and again throwing his arms about me as I\nsat, joined his sharp face to mine, and presumed to kiss me; Jenny still\nin the room.\n\nNow, Harriet, you never will desert me in a point of delicacy, I am sure.\nYou cannot defend these odious freedoms in a matrimony so young, unless\nyou would be willing to be served so yourself.\n\nYou may suppose, that then I let loose my indignation upon him. And he\nstole out, daring to mutter, and be displeased. The word devil was in\nhis mouth.\n\nDid he call me devil, Jenny?\n\nNo, indeed, madam, said the wench--And, Harriet, see the ill example of\nsuch a free behaviour before her: she presumed to prate in favour of the\nman's fit of fondness; yet, at other times, is a prude of a girl.\n\nBefore my anger was gone down, in again [It is truth, Harriet,] came the\nbold wretch. I will not, said he, as you are not particularly employed,\nleave you--Upon my soul, madam, you don't use me well. But if you will\noblige me with your company tomorrow morning--\n\nNo where, Sir--\n\nOnly to breakfast with Miss Byron, my dear--As a mark of your\nobligingness, I request it.\n\nHis dear!--Now I hate a hypocrite, of all things. I knew that he had a\ndesign to make a shew of his bride, as his property, at another place;\nand seeing me angry, thought he would name a visit agreeable to me, and\nwhich at the same time would give him a merit with you, and preserve to\nhimself the consequence of being obliged by his obedient wife, at the\nword of authority.\n\nFrom this foolish beginning arose our mighty quarrel. What vexed me was,\nthe art of the man, and the evident design he had to get you of his side.\nHe, in the course of it, threatened me with appealing to you.--To intend\nto ruin me in the love of my dearest friend! Who, that valued that\nfriend, could forgive it? You may believe, that if he had not proposed\nit, and after such accumulated offences, it was the very visit that I\nshould have been delighted with.\n\nIndeed, Sir--Upon my word, my lord--I do assure you, sir,--with a\nmoderate degree of haughtiness--was what the quarrel arose to, on my\nside--And, at last, to a declaration of rebellion--I won't.\n\nOn his side, Upon my soul, madam--Let me perish, if--and then hesitating\n--You use me ill, madam. I have not deserved--And give me leave to say--\nI insist upon being obliged, madam.\n\nThere was no bearing of this, Harriet.--It was a cool evening; but I took\nup my fan--Hey-day! said I, what language is this?--You insist upon it,\nmy lord!--I think I am married; am I not?--And I took my watch, half an\nhour after ten on Monday night--the--what day of the month is this?--\nPlease the lord, I will note down this beginning moment of your\nauthoritative demeanour.\n\nMy dear Lady G----, [The wretch called me by his own name, perhaps\nfarther to insult me,] if I could bear this treatment, it is impossible\nfor me to love you as I do.\n\nSo it is in love to me, that you are to put on already all the husband!--\nJenny! [Do you see, my lord, affecting a whisper, how you dash the poor\nwench? How like a fool she looks at our folly!] Remember, Jenny, that\nto-morrow morning you carry my wedding-suits to Mrs. Arnold; and tell\nher, she has forgot the hanging-sleeves to the gowns. Let her put them\non out of hand.\n\nI was proceeding--But he rudely, gravely, and even with an air of scorn,\n[There was no bearing that, you know,] admonished me. A little less wit,\nmadam, and a little more discretion, would perhaps better become you.\n\nThis was too true to be forgiven. You'll say it, Harriet, if I don't.\nAnd to come from a man that was not overburdened with either--But I had\ntoo great a command of myself to say so. My dependence, my lord, [This I\ndid say,] is upon your judgment: that will always be a balance to my wit;\nand, with the assistance of your reproving love, will in time teach me\ndiscretion.\n\nNow, my dear, was not this a high compliment to him? Ought he not to\nhave taken it as such? Especially as I looked grave, and dropt him a\nvery fine courtesy. But either his conscience or his ill-nature,\n(perhaps you'll say both,) made him take it as a reflection, [True as you\nare alive, Harriet!] He bit his lip. Jenny, begone, said he--Jenny,\ndon't go, said I--Jenny knew not which to obey. Upon my word, Harriet, I\nbegan to think the man would have cuffed me.--And while he was in his\nairs of mock-majesty, I stept to the door, and whipt down to my company.\n\nAs married people are not to expose themselves to their friends, (who I\nonce heard you sagely remark, would remember disagreeable things, when\nthe honest pair had forgotten them,) I was determined to be prudent.\nYou would have been charmed with me, my dear, for my discretion. I will\ncheat by-standers, thought I; I will make my Lord and Lady L----, Dr.\nBartlett, and Emily, whom I had before set in at cards, think we are\negregiously happy--And down I sat, intending, with a lamb-like\npeaceableness, to make observations on the play. But soon after, in\nwhipt my indiscreet lord, his colour heightened, his features working:\nand though I cautioned him not to expose himself, yet he assumed airs\nthat were the occasion, as you shall hear, of frightening away my\ncompany. He withdrew, in consequence of those airs; and, after a little\nwhile, (repenting, as I hoped,) he sent for me out. Some wives would\nhave played the queen Vashti on their tyrant, and refused to go: but I,\nall obedience, (my vow, so recently made, in my head,) obeyed, at the\nvery first word: yet you must think that I (meek as I am naturally) could\nnot help recriminating. He was too lordly to be expostulated with.--\nThere was, 'I tell you, madam,' and 'I won't be told, sir;' and when I\nbroke from the passionate creature, and hoped to find my company, behold!\nthey were all gone! None but Emily left. And thus might poor Lady L----\nbe sent home, weeping, perhaps, for such an early marriage-tyranny\nexerted on her meek sister.\n\nWell, and don't you think that we looked like a couple of fools at each\nother, when we saw ourselves left alone, as I may say, to fight it out?\nI did expostulate with him as mildly as I could: he would have made it up\nwith me afterwards; but, no! there was no doing that, as a girl of your\nnice notions may believe, after he had, by his violent airs, exposed us\nboth before so many witnesses. In decency, therefore, I was obliged to\nkeep it up: and now our misunderstanding blazes, and is at such a\ncomfortable height, that if we meet by accident, we run away from each\nother by design. We have already made two breakfast-tables: yet I am\nmeek; he is sullen: I make courtesies; he returns not bows.--Sullen\ncreature, and a rustic!--I go to my harpsichord; melody enrages him. He\nis worse than Saul; for Saul could be gloomily pleased with the music\neven of the man he hated.\n\nI would have got you to come to us: that I thought was tending to a\ncompliance; for it would have been condescending too much, as he is so\nvery perverse, if I had accompanied him to you. He has a great mind to\nappeal to you; but I have half rallied him out of his purpose. I sent to\nyou. What an answer did you return me!--Cruel Harriet! to deny your\nrequested mediation in a difference that has arisen between man and wife.\n--But let the fire glow. If it spares the house, and only blazes in the\nchimney, I can bear it.\n\nCross creature, adieu! If you know not such a woman as Grandison, Heaven\ngrant that I may; and that my wishes may be answered as to the person;\nand then I will not know a Byron.\n\n\nSee, Lucy, how high this dear flighty creature bribes! But I will not be\ninfluenced, by her bribery, to take her part.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXII\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nTUESDAY NIGHT.\n\n\nI am just returned from St. James's-square.\n\nBut, first, I should tell you, that I had a visit from Lady Olivia and\nLady Maffei. Our conversation was in Italian and French. Lady Olivia\nand I had a quarter of an hour's discourse in private: you may guess at\nour subject. She is not without that tenderness of heart which is the\nindispensable characteristic of a woman. She lamented the violence of\nher temper, in a manner so affecting, that I cannot help pitying her,\nthough at the instant I had in my head a certain attempt, that makes me\nshudder whenever I think of it. She regrets my going to Northamptonshire\nso soon. I have promised to return her visit to-morrow in the afternoon.\n\nShe sets out on Friday next for Oxford. She wished I could accompany\nher. She resolves to see all that is worth seeing in the western\ncircuit, as I may call it. She observes, she says, that Sir Charles\nGrandison's sisters, and their lords, are very particularly engaged at\npresent; and are in expectation of a call to Windsor, to attend Lord\nW----'s nuptials: she will therefore, having attendants enough, and two\nmen of consideration in her train, one of whom is not unacquainted with\nEngland, take cursory tours over the kingdom; having a taste for\ntravelling, and finding it a great relief to her spirits: and when Lady\nL---- and Lady G---- are more disengaged, will review the seats and\nplaces which she shall think worthy of a second visit, in their company.\n\nShe professed to like the people here, and the face of the country; and\ntalked favourably of the religion of it: but, poor woman! she likes all\nthose the better, I doubt not, for the sake of one Englishman. Love,\nLucy, gilds every object which bears a relation to the person beloved.\n\nLady Maffei was very free in blaming her niece for this excursion. She\ntook her chiding patiently; but yet, like a person that thought it too\nmuch in her power to gratify the person blaming her, to pay much regard\nto what she said.\n\nI took a chair to Lady G----'s. Emily ran to meet me in the hall. She\nthrew her arms about me: I rejoice you are come, said she. Did you not\nmeet the house in the square?--What means my Emily?--Why, it has been\nflung out of the windows, as the saying is. Ah madam! we are all to\npieces. One so careless, the other so passionate!--But, hush! Here\ncomes Lady G----.\n\nTake, Lucy, in the dialogue-way, particulars.\n\nLADY G.   Then you are come, at last, Harriet. You wrote, that you\nwould not come near me.\n\nHAR.   I did; but I could not stay away. Ah, Lady G----, you will\ndestroy your own happiness!\n\nLADY G.   So you wrote. Not one word, on the subject you hint at, that\nyou have ever said or written before. I hate repetitions, child.\n\nHAR.   Then I must be silent upon it.\n\nLADY G.   Not of necessity. You can say new things upon old subjects.--\nBut hush! Here comes the man.--She ran to her harpsichord--Is this it,\nHarriet? and touched the keys--repeating\n\n      \"Softly sweet, in Lydian measures,\n      Soon she sooth'd---- ----\"\n\n\nENTER LORD G.\n\n\nLORD G.   Miss Byron, I am your most obedient servant. The sight of you\nrejoices my soul.--Madam (to his lady), you have not been long enough\ntogether to begin a tune. I know what this is for--\n\nLADY G.   Harmony! harmony! is a charming thing! But I, poor I! know not\nany but what this simple instrument affords me.\n\nLORD G.   [Lifting up his hands.] Harmony, madam! God is my witness--\nBut I will lay every thing before Miss Byron.\n\nLADY G.   You need not, my lord: she knows as much as she can know,\nalready; except the fine colourings be added to the woeful tale, that\nyour unbridled spirit can give it.--Have you my long letter about you,\nHarriet?\n\nLORD G.   And could you, madam, have the heart to write--\n\nLADY G.   Why, my lord, do you mince the matter? For heart, say\ncourage. You may speak as plain in Miss Byron's presence, as you did\nbefore she came: I know what you mean.\n\nLORD G.   Let it be courage, then.\n\nHAR.   Fie, fie, Lord G----! Fie, fie, Lady G----! What lengths do you\nrun! If I understand the matter right, you have both, like children,\nbeen at play, till you have fallen out.\n\nLORD G.   If, Miss Byron, you know the truth, and can blame me--\n\nHAR.   I blame you only, my lord, for being in a passion. You see, my\nlady is serene: she keeps her temper: she looks as if she wanted to be\nfriends with you.\n\nLORD G.   O that cursed serenity!--When my soul is torn by a\nwhirlwind--\n\nLADY G.   A good tragedy rant!--But, Harriet, you are mistaken: My Lord\nG---- is a very passionate man. So humble, so--what shall I call it?\nbefore marriage--Did not the man see what a creature I was?--To bear with\nme, when he had no obligation to me; and not now, when he has the\nhighest--A miserable sinking!--O Harriet, Harriet! Never, never marry!\n\nHAR.   Dear Lady G----, you know in your own heart you are wrong--Indeed\nyou are wrong--\n\nLORD G.   God for ever reward you, madam!--I will tell you how it\nbegan--\n\nLADY G.   'Began!' She knows that already, I tell you, my lord. But\nwhat has passed within these four hours, she knows not: you may entertain\nher with that, if you please.--It was just about the time this day is a\nweek, that we were altogether, mighty comfortably, at St. George's,\nHanover-square--\n\nLORD G.   Every tittle of what you promised there, madam--\n\nLADY G.   And I, my lord, could be your echo in this, were I not resolved\nto keep my temper, as you cannot but say I have done, all along.\n\nLORD G.   You could not, madam, if you did not despise me.\n\nLADY G.   You are wrong, my lord, to think so: but you don't believe\nyourself: if you did, the pride of your heart ought not to permit you to\nown it.\n\nLORD G.   Miss Byron, give me leave--\n\nLADY G.   Lord bless me! that people are so fond of exposing themselves!\nHad you taken my advice, when you pursued me out of my dressing-room into\ncompany--My lord, said I, as mildly as I now speak, Don't expose\nyourself. But he was not at all the wiser for my advice.\n\nLORD G.   Miss Byron, you see--But I had not come down but to make my\ncompliments to you. He bowed, and was about to withdraw.\n\nI took him by the sleeve--My lord, you must not go. Lady G----, if your\nown heart justifies you for your part in this misunderstanding, say so; I\nchallenge you to say so.--She was silent.\n\nHAR.   If otherwise, own your fault, promise amendment--ask pardon.\n\nLADY G.   Hey-day!\n\nHAR.   And my lord will ask yours, for mistaking you--For being too\neasily provoked--\n\nLORD G.   Too easily, madam--\n\nHAR.   What generous man would not smile at the foibles of a woman whose\nheart is only gay with prosperity and lively youth; but has not the least\nmalice in it? Has not she made choice of your lordship in preference of\nany other man? She rallies every one; she can't help it: she is to\nblame.--Indeed, Lady G----, you are. Your brother felt your edge; he\nonce smarted by it, and was angry with you.--But afterwards, observing\nthat it was her way, my lord; that it was a kind of constitutional gaiety\nof heart, and exercised on those she loved best; he forgave, rallied her\nagain, and turned her own weapons upon her; and every one in company was\ndelighted with the spirit of both.--You love her, my lord.\n\nLORD G.   Never man more loved a woman. I am not an ill-natured man--\n\nLADY G.   But a captious, a passionate one, Lord G----. Who'd have\nthought it?\n\nLORD G.   Never was there, my dear Miss Byron, such a\nstrangely-aggravating creature! She could not be so, if she did not\ndespise me.\n\nLADY G.   Fiddle-faddle, silly man! And so you said before. If you\nthought so, you take the way, (don't you?) to mend the matter, by dancing\nand capering about, and putting yourself into all manner of disagreeable\nattitudes; and even sometimes being ready to foam at the mouth?--I told\nhim, Miss Byron, There he stands, let him deny it, if he can; that I\nmarried a man with another face. Would not any other man have taken this\nfor a compliment to his natural undistorted face, and instantly have\npulled off the ugly mask of passion, and shewn his own?--\n\nLORD G.   You see, you see, the air, Miss Byron!--How ludicrously does\nshe now, even now--\n\nLADY G.   See, Miss Byron!--How captious!--Lord G---- ought to have a\ntermagant wife: one who could return rage for rage. Meekness is my\ncrime.--I cannot be put out of temper.--Meekness was never before\nattributed to woman as a fault.\n\nLORD G.   Good God!--Meekness!--Good God!\n\nLADY G.   But, Harriet, do you judge on which side the grievance lies.--\nLord G---- presents me with a face for his, that I never saw him wear\nbefore marriage: He has cheated me, therefore. I shew him the same face\nthat I ever wore, and treat him pretty much in the same manner (or I am\nmistaken) that I ever did: and what reason can he give, that will not\ndemonstrate him to be the most ungrateful of men, for the airs he gives\nhimself? Airs that he would not have presumed to put on eight days ago.\nWho then, Harriet, has reason to complain of grievance; my lord, or I?\n\nLORD G.   You see, Miss Byron--Can there be any arguing with a woman who\nknows herself to be in jest, in all she says?\n\nHAR.   Why then, my lord, make a jest of it. What will not bear an\nargument, will not be worth one's anger.\n\nLORD G.   I leave it to Miss Byron, Lady G----, to decide between us, as\nshe pleases.\n\nLADY G.   You'd better leave it to me, sir.\n\nHAR.   Do, my lord.\n\nLORD G.   Well, madam!--And what is your decree?\n\nLADY G.   You, Miss Byron, had best be Lady Chancellor, after all. I\nshould not bear to have my decree disputed, after it is pronounced.\n\nHAR.   If I must, my decree is this:--You, Lady G---- shall own yourself\nin fault; and promise amendment. My lord shall forgive you; and promise\nthat he will, for the future, endeavour to distinguish between your good\nand your ill-nature: that he will sit down to jest with your jest, and\nnever be disturbed at what you say, when he sees it accompanied with that\narchness of eye and lip which you put on to your brother, and to every\none whom you best love, when you are disposed to be teazingly facetious.\n\nLADY G.   Why, Harriet, you have given Lord G---- a clue to find me out,\nand spoil all my sport.\n\nHAR.   What say you, my lord?\n\nLORD G.   Will Lady G---- own herself in fault, as you propose?\n\nLADY G.   Odious recrimination!--I leave you together. I never was in\nfault in my life. Am I not a woman? If my lord will ask pardon for his\nfroppishness, as we say of children--\n\nShe stopt, and pretended to be going--\n\nHAR.   That my lord shall not do, Charlotte. You have carried the jest\ntoo far already. My lord shall preserve his dignity for his wife's sake.\nMy lord, you will not permit Lady G---- to leave us, however?\n\nHe took her hand, and pressed it with his lips: for God's sake, madam,\nlet us be happy: it is in your power to make us both so: it ever shall be\nin your power. If I have been in fault, impute it to my love. I cannot\nbear your contempt; and I never will deserve it.\n\nLADY G.   Why could not this have been said some hours ago?--Why,\nslighting my early caution, would you expose yourself?\n\nI took her aside. Be generous, Lady G----. Let not your husband be the\nonly person to whom you are not so.\n\nLADY G.   [Whispering.] Our quarrel has not run half its length. If we\nmake up here, we shall make up clumsily. One of the silliest things in\nthe world is, a quarrel that ends not, as a coachman after a journey\ncomes in, with a spirit. We shall certainly renew it.\n\nHAR.   Take the caution you gave to my lord: don't expose yourself. And\nanother; that you cannot more effectually do so, than by exposing your\nhusband. I am more than half-ashamed of you. You are not the Charlotte\nI once thought you were. Let me see, if you have any regard to my good\nopinion of you, that you can own an error with some grace.\n\nLADY G.   I am a meek, humble, docile creature. She turned to me, and\nmade me a rustic courtesy, her hands before her: I'll try for it: tell\nme, if I am right. Then stepping towards my lord, who was with his back\nto us looking out at the window--and he turning about to her bowing--My\nlord, said she, Miss Byron has been telling me more than I knew before of\nmy duty. She proposes herself one day to make a won-der-ful obedient\nwife. It would have been well for you, perhaps, had I had her example to\nwalk by. She seems to say, that, now I am married, I must be grave,\nsage, and passive: that smiles will hardly become me: that I must be prim\nand formal, and reverence my husband.--If you think this behaviour will\nbecome a married woman, and expect it from me, pray, my lord, put me\nright by your frowns, whenever I shall be wrong. For the future, if I\never find myself disposed to be very light-hearted, I will ask your leave\nbefore I give way to it. And now, what is next to be done? humorously\ncourtesying, her hands before her.\n\nHe clasped her in his arms: dear provoking creature! This, this is next\nto be done--I ask you but to love me half as much as I love you, and I\nshall be the happiest man on earth.\n\nMy lord, said I, you ruin all by this condescension on a speech and air\nso ungracious. If this is all you get by it, never, never, my lord, fall\nout again. O Charlotte! If you are not generous, you come off much,\nmuch too easily.\n\nWell now, my lord, said she, holding out her hand, as if threatening me,\nlet you and me, man and wife like, join against the interposer in our\nquarrels.--Harriet, I will not forgive you, for this last part of your\nlecture.\n\nAnd thus was this idle quarrel made up. All that vexes me on the\noccasion is, that it was not made up with dignity on my lord's part.\nHis honest heart so overflowed with joy at his lips, that the naughty\ncreature, by her arch leers, every now and then, shewed, that she was\nsensible of her consequence to his happiness. But, Lucy, don't let her\nsink too low in your esteem: she has many fine qualities.\n\nThey prevailed on me to stay supper. Emily rejoiced in the\nreconciliation: her heart was, as I may say, visible in her joy. Can I\nlove her better than I do? If I could, she would, every time I see her,\ngive me reason for it.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXIII\n\nMISS BYRON.--IN CONTINUATION\nWEDNESDAY NOON, APRIL 19.\n\n\nIt would puzzle you to guess at a visitor I had this morning.--Honest Mr.\nFowler. I was very glad to see him. He brought me a Letter from his\nworthy uncle. Good Sir Rowland! I had a joy that I thought I should not\nhave had while I stayed in London, on its being put into my hand, though\nthe contents gave me sensible pain. I enclose it. It is dated from\nCaermarthen. Be pleased to read it here.\n\n\n***\n\n\nCAERMARTHEN, APRIL 11.\n\nHow shall I, in fit manner, inscribe my letter to the loveliest of women!\nI don't mean because of your loveliness; but whether as daughter or not,\nas you did me the honour to call yourself. Really, and truly, I must\nsay, that I had rather call you by another name, though a little more\nremote as to consanguinity. Lord have mercy upon me, how have I talked\nof you! How many of our fine Caermarthen girls have I filled with envy\nof your peerless perfections!\n\nHere am I settled to my heart's content, could I but obtain--You know\nwhom I mean.--A town of gentry: A fine country round us--A fine estate of\nour own. Esteemed, nay, for that matter, beloved, by all our neighbours\nand tenants. Who so happy as Rowland Meredith, if his poor boy could be\nhappy!--Ah, madam!--And can't it be so? I am afraid of asking. Yet I\nunderstand, that, notwithstanding all the jack-a-dandies that have been\nfluttering about you, you are what you were when I lest town. Some\nwhispers have gone out of a fine gentleman, indeed, who had a great\nkindness for you; but yet that something was in the way between you. The\nLord bless and prosper my dear daughter, as I must then call you, and not\nniece, if you have any kindness for him. And if as how you have, it\nwould be wonderfully gracious if you would but give half a hint of it to\nmy nephew, or if so be you will not to him, to me, your father you know,\nunder your own precious hand. The Lord be good unto me! But I shall\nnever see the she that will strike my fancy, as you have done. But what\na dreadful thing would it be, if you, who are so much courted and admired\nby many fine gallants, should at last be taken with a man who could not\nbe yours! God forbid that such a disastrous thing should happen! I\nprofess to you, madam, that a tear or two have strayed down my cheeks at\nthe thoughts of it. For why? Because you played no tricks with any man:\nyou never were a coquette, as they call them. You dealt plainly,\nsincerely, and tenderly too, to all men; of which my nephew and I can\nbear witness.\n\nWell, but what now is the end of my writing?--Lord love you, cannot,\ncannot you at last give comfort to two honest hearts? Honester you never\nknew! And yet, if you could, I dare say you would. Well, then, and if\nyou can't, we must sit down as contented as we can; that's all we have\nfor it.--But, poor young man! Look at him, if you read this before him.\nStrangely altered! Poor young man!--And if as how you cannot, why then,\nGod bless my daughter; that's all. And I do assure you, that you have\nour prayers every Lord's day, from the bottom of our hearts.\n\nAnd now, if you will keep a secret, I will tell it you; and yet, when I\nbegan, I did not intend it: the poor youth must not know it. It is done\nin the singleness of our hearts; and if you think we mean to gain your\nlove for us by it, I do assure you, that you wrong us.--My nephew\ndeclares, that he never will marry, if it be not somebody: and he has\nmade his will, and so have I his uncle; and, let me tell you, that if as\nhow I cannot have a niece, my daughter shall be the better for having\nknown, and treated as kindly, as power was lent her,\n\nHer true friend, loving father, and obedient servant,\nROWLAND MEREDITH.\n\nLove and service to Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, and all friends who inquire\n      after me. Farewell. God bless you! Amen.\n\n\n***\n\n\nHave you, could you, Lucy, read this letter with dry eyes? Generous,\nworthy, honest men! I read but half way before Mr. Fowler--Glad I was,\nthat I read no further. I should not have been able to have kept his\nuncle's secret, if I had; had it been but to disclaim the acceptance of\nthe generous purpose. The carrying it into effect would exceedingly\ndistress me, besides the pain the demise of the honest man would give me;\nand the more, as I bespoke the fatherly relation from him myself. If\nsuch a thing were to be, Sir Charles Grandison's generosity to the Danbys\nshould be my example.\n\nDo you know, Mr. Fowler, said I, the contents of the letter you have put\ninto my hand?\n\nNo farther than that my uncle told me, it contained professions of\nfatherly love; and with wishes only--But without so much as expressing\nhis hopes.\n\nSir Rowland is a good man, said I: I have not read above half his letter.\nThere seems to be too much of the father in it, for me to read further,\nbefore my brother. God bless my brother Fowler, and reward the fatherly\nlove of Sir Rowland to his daughter Byron! I must write to him.\n\nMr. Fowler, poor man! profoundly sighed; bowed; with such a look of\nrespectful acquiescence--Bless me, my dear, how am I to be distressed on\nall sides! by good men too; as Sir Charles could say by good women.\n\nIs there nothing less than giving myself to either, that I can do to shew\nMr. Orme and Mr. Fowler my true value for them?\n\nPoor Mr. Fowler!--Indeed he looks to be, as Sir Rowland hints, not well.\n--Such a modest, such a humble, such a silent lover!--He cost me tears at\nparting: I could not hide them. He heaped praises and blessings upon me,\nand hurried away at last, to hide his emotion, with a sentence\nunfinished.--God preserve you, dear and worthy sir! was all I could try\nto say. The last words stuck in my throat, till he was out of hearing;\nand then I prayed for blessings upon him and his uncle: and repeated\nthem, with fresh tears, on reading the rest of the affecting letter.\n\nMr. Fowler told Mr. Reeves, before I saw him, that he is to go to\nCaermarthen for the benefit of his native air, in a week. He let him\nknow where he lodged in town. He had been riding for his health and\ndiversion about the country, ever since his uncle went; and has not been\nyet at Caermarthen.\n\nI wish Mr. Fowler had once, if but once, called me sister: it would have\nbeen such a kind acquiescence, as would have given me some little\npleasure on recollection. Methinks I don't know how to have done writing\nof Sir Rowland and Mr. Fowler.\n\nI sat down, however, while the uncle and nephew filled my thoughts, and\nwrote to the former. I have enclosed the copy of my letter.\n\nAdieu, my Lucy.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXIV\n\nMISS BYRON, TO SIR ROWLAND MEREDITH\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 19.\n\n\nIt was with great pleasure that I received, this day, the kindest Letter\nthat ever was written by a real father to his dearest child. I was\nresolved that I would not go to rest till I had acknowledged the favour.\n\nHow sweet is the name of father to a young person who, out of near\none-and-twenty years of life, has for more than half the time been\nbereaved of hers; and who was also one of the best of men!\n\nYou gave me an additional pleasure in causing this remembrance of your\npromised paternal goodness to be given me by Mr. Fowler in person. Till\nI knew you and him, I had no father, no brother.\n\nHow good you are in your apprehensions that there may be a man on whom\nyour daughter has cast her eye, and who cannot look upon her with the\nsame distinction--O that I had been near you when you wrote that\nsweetly-compassionating, that indulgent passage! I would have wiped the\ntears from your eyes myself, and reverenced you as my true father.\n\nYou demand of me, as my father, a hint, or half a hint, as you call it,\nto be given to my brother Fowler; or if not to him, to you. To him, whom\nI call father, I mean all the duty of a child. I call him not father\nnominally only: I will, irksome as the subject is, own, without reserve,\nthe truth to you--[In tenderness to my brother, how could I to him?]--\nThere is a man whom, and whom only, I could love as a good wife ought to\nlove her husband. He is the best of men. O my good Sir Rowland\nMeredith! if you knew him, you would love him yourself, and own him for\nyour son. I will not conceal his name from my father: Sir Charles\nGrandison is the man. Inquire about him. His character will rise upon\nyou from every mouth. He engaged first all your daughter's gratitude, by\nrescuing her from a great danger and oppression; for he is as brave as he\nis good: and how could she help suffering a tenderness to spring up from\nher gratitude, of which she was never before sensible to any man in the\nworld? There is something in the way, my good sir; but not that proceeds\nfrom his slights or contempts. Your daughter could not live, if it were\nso. A glorious creature is in the way! who has suffered for him, who\ndoes suffer for him: he ought to be hers, and only hers; and if she can\nbe recovered from a fearful malady that has seized her mind, he probably\nwill. My daily prayers are, that God will restore her!\n\nBut yet, my dear sir, my friend, my father! my esteem for this noblest of\nmen is of such a nature, that I cannot give my hand to any other: my\nfather Meredith would not wish me to give a hand without a heart.\n\nThis, sir, is the case. Let it, I beseech you, rest within your own\nbreast, and my brother Fowler's. How few minds are there delicate and\ncandid enough to see circumstances of this kind in the light they ought\nto appear in! And pray for me, my good Sir Rowland; not that the way may\nbe smoothed to what once would have crowned my wishes as to this life;\nbut that Sir Charles Grandison may be happy with the lady that is, and\nought to be, dearest to his heart; and that your daughter may be enabled\nto rejoice in their felicity. What, my good sir, is this span of life,\nthat a passenger through it should seek to overturn the interests of\nothers to establish her own? And can the single life be a grievance?\nCan it be destitute of the noblest tendernesses? No, sir. You that have\nlived to an advanced age, in a fair fame, surrounded with comforts, and\nas tender to a worthy nephew, as the most indulgent father could be to\nthe worthiest of sons, can testify for me, that it is not.\n\nBut now, sir, one word--I disclaim, but yet in all thankfulness, the\nacceptance of the favour signified to be intended me in the latter part\nof the paternal letter before me. Our acquaintance began with a hope, on\nyour side, that I could not encourage. As I could not, shall I accept of\nthe benefit from you, to which I could only have been entitled (and that\nas I had behaved) had I been able to oblige you?--No, sir! I will not,\nin this case, be benefited, when I cannot benefit. Put me not therefore,\nI beseech you, sir, if such an event (deplored by me, as it would be!)\nshould happen, upon the necessity of inquiring after your other relations\nand friends. Sir Rowland Meredith my father, and Mr. Fowler my brother,\nare all to me of the family they distinguish by their relation, that I\nknow at present. Let me not be made known to the rest by a distinction\nthat would be unjust to them, and to yourself, as it must deprive you of\nthe grace of obliging those who have more than a stranger's claim; and\nmust, in the event, lay them under the appearance of an obligation to\nthat stranger for doing them common justice.\n\nI use the word stranger with reference to those of your family and\nfriends to whom I must really appear in that light. But, laying these\nconsiderations aside, in which I am determined not to interfere with\nthem, I am, with the tenderest regard, dear and good sir,\n\nYour ever-dutiful and affectionate daughter,\nHARRIET BYRON.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXV\n\nMISS BYRON, TO MISS SELBY\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 19.\n\n\nI shall dispatch this by your Gibson early in the morning. It was kind\nin you to bid him call, in his way down; for now I shall be almost sure\nof meeting (if not my uncle) your brother, and who knows, but my Lucy\nherself, at Dunstable? Where, barring accidents, I shall be on Friday\nnight.\n\nYou will see some of the worthiest people in the world, my dear, if you\ncome, all prepared to love you: but let not any body be put to\ninconvenience to meet me at Dunstable. My noble friends here will\nproceed with me to Stratford, or even to Northampton, they say; but they\nwill see me safe in the protection of somebody I love, and whom they must\nlove for my sake.\n\nI don't wonder that Sir Charles Grandison loves Mr. Beauchamp: he is a\nvery worthy and sensible man. He, as every body else, idolizes Sir\nCharles. It is some pleasure to me, Lucy, that I stand high in his\nesteem. To be respected by the worthy, is one of the greatest felicities\nin this life; since it is to be ranked as one of them. Sir Harry and his\nlady are come to town. All, it seems, is harmony in that family. They\ncannot bear Mr. Beauchamp's absence from them for three days together.\nAll the neighbouring gentlemen are in love with him. His manners are so\ngentle; his temper so even; so desirous to oblige; so genteel in his\nperson; so pleasing in his address; he must undoubtedly make a good woman\nvery happy.\n\nBut Emily, poor girl! sees only Sir Charles Grandison with eyes of love.\nMr. Beauchamp is, however, greatly pleased with Emily. He told Lady G----\nthat he thought her a fine young creature; and that her mind was still\nmore amiable than her person. But his behaviour to her is extremely\nprudent. He says finer things of her, than to her: yet surely I am\nmistaken if he meditates not in her his future wife.\n\nMr. Beauchamp will be one of my escort.\n\nEmily, at her own request, is to go to Colnebrook with Lady L---- after I\nam gone.\n\nMr. Reeves will ride. Lord L---- and Lord G---- will also oblige me with\ntheir company on horseback.\n\nMrs. Reeves is forbidden to venture; but Lady L---- and Lady G---- will\nnot be denied coming with me.\n\nI shall take leave of Lady Olivia and Lady Maffei to-morrow morning; when\nthey will set out for their projected tour. To-morrow we and the whole\nGrandison family are to dine together at Lord L----'s, for the last time.\nIt will be a mournful dining-time, on that account.\n\nLady Betty Williams, her daughter, and Miss Clements, supped with us this\nnight, and took leave of me in the tenderest manner. They greatly regret\nmy going down so soon, as they call it.\n\nAs to the public diversions, which they wish me to stay and give into, to\nbe sure I should have been glad to have been better qualified to have\nentertained you with the performances of this or that actor, this or that\nmusician, and the like: but, frightened by the vile plot upon me at a\nmasquerade, I was thrown out of that course of diversion, and indeed into\nmore affecting, more interesting engagements; into the knowledge of a\nfamily that had no need to look out of itself for entertainments: and,\nbesides, are not all the company we see, as visiters or guests, full of\nthese things? I have seen the principal performers, in every way, often\nenough to give me a notion of their performances, though I have not\ntroubled you with such common things as revolve every season.\n\nYou know I am far from slighting the innocent pleasures in which others\ndelight--It would have been happier for me, perhaps, had I had more\nleisure to attend those amusements, than I have found. Yet I am not\nsure, neither: for methinks, with all the pangs that my suspenses have\ncost me, I would not but have known Sir Charles Grandison, his sisters,\nhis Emily, and Dr. Bartlett.\n\nI could only have wished to have been spared Sir Hargrave Pollexfen's\nvile attempt: then, if I had come acquainted with this family, it would\nhave been as I came acquainted with others: my gratitude had not been\nengaged so deeply.\n\nWell--But what signify if's?--What has been, has; what must be, must.\nOnly love me, my dear friends, as you used to love me. If I was a good\ngirl when I left you, I hope I am not a bad one now, that I am returning\nto you. My morals, I bless God, are unhurt: my heart is not corrupted by\nthe vanities of the great town: I have a little more experience than I\nhad: and if I have severely paid for it, it is not at the price of my\nreputation. And I hope, if nobody has benefited by me, since I have been\nin town, that no one has suffered by me. Poor Mr. Fowler!--I could not\nhelp it, you know. Had I, by little snares, follies, coquetries, sought\nto draw him on, and entangle him, his future welfare would, with reason,\nbe more the subject of my solicitude, than it is now necessary it should\nbe; though, indeed, I cannot help making it a good deal so.\n\n\n***\n\n\nTHURSDAY MORNING.\n\nDr. Bartlett has just now taken leave of me, in my own dressing-room.\nThe parting scene between us was tender.\n\nI have not given you my opinion of Miss Williams. Had I seen her at my\nfirst coming to town, I should have taken as much notice of her, in my\nletters to you, as I did of the two Miss Brambers, Miss Darlington, Miss\nCantillon, Miss Allestree, and others of my own sex; and of Mr. Somner,\nMr. Barnet, Mr. Walden, of the other; who took my first notice, as they\nfell early in my way, and with whom it is possible, as well as with the\ntown-diversions, I had been more intimate, had not Sir Hargrave's vile\nattempt carried me out of their acquaintance into a much higher; which of\nnecessity, as well as choice, entirely engrossed my attention. But now\nhow insipid would any new characters appear to you, if they were but of a\nlike cast with those I have mentioned, were I to make such the subjects\nof my pen, and had I time before me; which I cannot have, to write again,\nbefore I embrace you all, my dear, my ever dear and indulgent friends!\n\nI will only say, that Miss Williams is a genteel girl; but will hardly be\nmore than one of the better sort of modern women of condition; and that\nshe is to be classed so high, will be owing more to Miss Clements's\nlessons, than, I am afraid, to her mother's example.\n\nIs it, Lucy, that I have more experience and discernment now, or less\ncharity and good-nature, than when I first came to town? for then I\nthought well, in the main, of Lady Betty Williams. But though she is a\ngood-natured, obliging woman; she is so immersed in the love of public\ndiversions! so fond of routs, drums, hurricanes,--Bless me, my dear! how\nlearned should I have been in all the gaieties of the modern life; what a\nfine lady, possibly; had I not been carried into more rational (however\nto me they have been more painful) scenes; and had I followed the lead of\nthis lady, as she (kindly, as to her intention) had designed I should!\n\nIn the afternoon Mr. Beauchamp is to introduce Sir Harry and Lady\nBeauchamp, on their first visit to the two sisters.\n\nI had almost forgot to tell you, that my cousins and I are to attend the\ngood Countess of D---- for one half hour, after we have taken leave of\nLady Olivia and her aunt.\n\nAnd now, my Lucy, do I shut up my correspondence with you from London.\nMy heart beats high with the hope of being as indulgently received by all\nyou, my dearest friends, as I used to be after a shorter absence: for I\nam, and ever will be,\n\nThe grateful, dutiful, and affectionate\nHARRIET BYRON.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXVI\n\nMISS BYRON, TO LADY G----\nSELBY-HOUSE, MONDAY, APRIL 24.\n\n\nThough the kind friends with whom I parted at Dunstable were pleased, one\nand all, to allow that the correspondence which is to pass between my\ndear Lady G---- and their Harriet, should answer the just expectations of\neach upon her, in the writing way; and though (at your motion, remember,\nnot at mine) they promised to be contented with hearing read to them such\nparts of my letters as you should think proper to communicate; yet cannot\nI dispense with my duty to Lady L----, my Emily, my cousin Reeves, and\nDr. Bartlett. Accordingly, I write to them by this post; and I charge\nyou, my dear, with my sincere and thankful compliments to your lord, and\nto Mr. Beauchamp, for their favours.\n\nWhat an agreeable night, in the main, was Friday night! Had we not been\nto separate next morning, it would have been an agreeable one indeed!\n\nIs not my aunt Selby an excellent woman? But you all admired her. She\nadmires you all. I will tell you, another time, what she said of you, my\ndear, in particular.\n\nMy cousin Lucy, too--is she not an amiable creature? Indeed you all were\ndelighted with her. But I take pleasure in recollecting your\napprobations of one I so dearly love. She is as prudent as Lady L----\nand now our Nancy is so well recovered, as cheerful as Lady G----. You\nsaid you would provide a good husband for her: don't forget. The man,\nwhoever he be, cannot be too good for my Lucy. Nancy is such another\ngood girl: but so I told you.\n\nWell, and pray, did you ever meet with so pleasant a man as my uncle\nSelby? What should we have done, when we talked of your brother, when we\ntalked of our parting, had it not been for him? You looked upon me every\nnow and then, when he returned your smartness upon him, as if you thought\nI had let him know some of your perversenesses to Lord G----. And do you\nthink I did not? Indeed I did. Can you imagine that your frank-hearted\nHarriet, who hides not from her friends her own faults, should conceal\nyours?--But what a particular character is yours! Every body blames you,\nthat knows of your over-livelinesses; yet every body loves you--I think,\nfor your very faults. Had it not been so, do you imagine I could ever\nhave loved you, after you had led Lady L---- to join with you, on a\ncertain teasing occasion?--My uncle dotes upon you!\n\nBut don't tell Emily that my cousin James Selby is in love with her.\nThat he may not, on the score of the dear girl's fortune, be thought\npresumptuous, let me tell you, that he is almost of age; and, when he is,\ncomes into possession of a handsome estate. He has many good qualities.\nI have, in short, a very great value for him; but not enough, though he\nis my relation, to wish him my still more beloved Emily. Dear creature!\nMethinks I still feel her parting tears on my cheek!\n\nYou charge me to be as minute, in the letters I write to you, as I used\nto be to my friends here: and you promise to be as circumstantial in\nyours. I will set you the example: do you be sure to follow it.\n\nWe baited at Stoney Stratford. I was afraid how it would be: there were\nthe two bold creatures, Mr. Greville, and Mr. Fenwick, ready to receive\nus. A handsome collation, as at our setting out, so now, bespoke by\nthem, was set on the table. How they came by their intelligence, nobody\nknows: we were all concerned to see them. They seemed half-mad for joy.\nMy cousin James had alighted to hand us out; but Mr. Greville was so\nearnest to offer his hand, that though my cousin was equally ready, I\nthought I could not deny to his solicitude for the poor favour, such a\nmark of civility. Besides, if I had, it would have been distinguishing\nhim for more than a common neighbour, you know. Mr. Fenwick took the\nother hand, when I had stept out of the coach, and then (with so much\npride, as made me ashamed of myself) they hurried me between them,\nthrough the inn yard, and into the room they had engaged for us; blessing\nthemselves, all the way, for my coming down Harriet Byron.\n\nI looked about, as if for the dear friends I had parted with at\nDunstable. This is not, thought I, so delightful an inn as they made\nthat--Now they, thought I, are pursuing their road to London, as we are\nours to Northampton. But ah! where, where is Sir Charles Grandison at\nthis time? And I sighed! But don't read this, and such strokes as this,\nto any body but Lord and Lady L----. You won't, you say--Thank you,\nCharlotte.--I will call you Charlotte, when I think of it, as you\ncommanded me. The joy we had at Dunstable, was easy, serene, deep, full,\nas I may say; it was the joy of sensible people: but the joy here was\nmade by the two gentlemen, mad, loud, and even noisy. They hardly were\nable to contain themselves; and my uncle, and cousin James, were forced\nto be loud, to be heard.\n\nMr. Orme, good Mr. Orme, when we came near his park, was on the highway\nside, perhaps near the very spot where he stood to see me pass to London\nso many weeks ago--Poor man!--When I first saw him, (which was before the\ncoach came near, for I looked out only, as thinking I would mark the\nplace where I last beheld him,) he looked with so disconsolate an air,\nand so fixed, that I compassionately said to myself, Surely the worthy\nman has not been there ever since!\n\nI twitched the string just in time: the coach stopt. Mr. Orme, said I,\nhow do you? Well, I hope?--How does Miss Orme?\n\nI had my hand on the coach-door. He snatched it. It was not an\nunwilling hand. He pressed it with his lips. God be praised, said he,\n(with a countenance, O how altered for the better!) for permitting me\nonce more to behold that face--that angelic face, he said.\n\nGod bless you, Mr. Orme! said I: I am glad to see you. Adieu.\n\nThe coach drove on. Poor Mr. Orme! said my aunt.\n\nMr. Orme, Lucy, said I, don't look so ill as you wrote he was.\n\nHis joy to see you, said she--But Mr. Orme is in a declining way.\n\nMr. Greville, on the coach stopping, rode back just as it was going on\nagain--And with a loud laugh--How the d----l came Orme to know of your\ncoming, madam!--Poor fellow! It was very kind of you to stop your coach\nto speak to the statue. And he laughed again.--Nonsensical! At what?\n\nMy grandmamma Shirley, dearest of parents! her youth, as she was pleased\nto say, renewed by the expectation of so soon seeing her darling child,\ncame (as my aunt told us, you know) on Thursday night to Selby-house, to\ncharge her and Lucy with her blessing to me; and resolving to stay there\nto receive me. Our beloved Nancy was also to be there; so were two other\ncousins, Kitty and Patty Holles, good young creatures; who, in my\nabsence, had attended my grandmamma at every convenient opportunity, and\nwhom I also found here.\n\nWhen we came within sight of this house, Now, Harriet, said Lucy, I see\nthe same kind of emotions beginning to arise in your face and bosom, as\nLady G---- told us you shewed when you first saw your aunt at Dunstable.\nMy grandmamma! said I, I am in sight of the dear house that holds her: I\nhope she is here. But I will not surprise her with my joy to see her.\nLie still, throbbing impatient heart.\n\nBut when the coach set us down at the inner gate, there, in the\noutward-hall, sat my blessed grandmamma. The moment I beheld her, my\nintended caution forsook me: I sprang by my aunt, and, before the\nfoot-step could be put down, flew, as it were, out of the coach, and\nthrew myself at her feet, wrapping my arms about her: Bless, bless, said\nI, your Harriet! I could not, at the moment, say another word.\n\nGreat God! said the pious parent, her hands and eyes lifted up, Great\nGod! I thank thee! Then folding her arms about my neck, she kissed my\nforehead, my cheek, my lips--God bless my love! Pride of my life! the\nmost precious of a hundred daughters! How does my child--my Harriet--O\nmy love!--After such dangers, such trials, such harassings--Once more,\nGod be praised that I clasp to my fond heart, my Harriet!\n\nSeparate them, separate them, said my facetious uncle, (yet he had tears\nin his eyes,) before they grow together!--Madam, to my grandmamma, she is\nour Harriet, as well as yours: let us welcome the saucy girl, on her\nre-entrance into these doors!--Saucy, I suppose, I shall soon find her.\n\nMy grandmamma withdrew her fond arms: Take her, take her, said she, each\nin turn: but I think I never can part with her again.\n\nMy uncle saluted me, and bid me very kindly welcome home--so did every\none.\n\nHow can I return the obligations which the love of all my friends lays\nupon me? To be good, to be grateful, is not enough; since that one ought\nto be for one's own sake. Yet how can I be even grateful to them with\nhalf a heart? Ah, Lady G----, you bid me be free in my confessions. You\npromise to look my letters over before you read them to any body; and to\nmark passages proper to be kept to yourself--Pray do.\n\nMr. Greville and Mr. Fenwick were here separately, an hour ago: I thanked\nthem for their civility on the road, and not ungraciously, as Mr.\nGreville told my uncle, as to him. He was not, he said, without hopes,\nyet; since I knew not how to be ungrateful. Mr. Greville builds, as he\nalways did, a merit on his civility; and by that means sinks, in the\nnarrower lover, the claim he might otherwise make to the title of the\ngenerous neighbour.\n\n\n***\n\n\nMiss Orme has just been here. She could not help throwing in a word for\nher brother.\n\nYou will guess, my dear Lady G----, at the subject of our conversations\nhere, and what they will be, morning, noon, and night, for a week to\ncome. My grandmamma is better in health than I have known her for a year\nor two past. The health of people in years can mend but slowly; and they\nare slow to acknowledge it in their own favour. My grandmamma, however,\nallows that she is better within these few days past; but attributes the\namendment to her Harriet's return.\n\nHow do they all bless, revere, extol, your noble brother!--How do they\nwish--And how do they regret--you know what--Yet how ready are they to\napplaud your Harriet, if she can hold her magnanimity, in preferring the\nhappiness of Clementina to her own!--My grandmamma and aunt are of\nopinion, that I should; and they praise me for the generosity of my\neffort, whether the superior merits of the man will or will not allow me\nto succeed in it. But my uncle, my Lucy, and my Nancy, from their\nunbounded love of me, think a little, and but a little, narrower; and,\nbelieving it will go hard with me, say, It is hard. My uncle, in\nparticular, says, The very pretension is flight and nonsense: but,\nhowever, if the girl, added he, can parade away her passion for an object\nso worthy, with all my heart: it will be but just, that the romancing\nelevations, which so often drive headstrong girls into difficulties,\nshould now and then help a more discreet one out of them.\n\nAdieu, my beloved Lady G----! Repeated compliments, love, thanks, to my\nLord and Lady L----, to my Emily, to Dr. Bartlett, to Mr. Beauchamp, and\nparticularly to my Lord G----. Dear, dear Charlotte, be good! Let me\nbeseech you be good! If you are not, you will have every one of my\nfriends who met you at Dunstable, and, from their report, my grandmamma\nand Nancy, against you; for they find but one fault in my lord: it is,\nthat he seems too fond of a lady, who, by her archness of looks, and\nhalf-saucy turns upon him, even before them, evidently shewed--Shall I\nsay what? But I stand up for you, my dear. Your gratitude, your\ngenerosity, your honour, I say, (and why should I not add your duty?)\nwill certainly make you one of the most obliging of wives, to the most\naffectionate of husbands.\n\nMy uncle says he hopes so: but though he adores you for a friend, and the\ncompanion of a lively hour; yet he does not know but his dame Selby is\nstill the woman whom a man should prefer for a wife: and she, said he, is\nfull as saucy as a wife need to be; though I think, Harriet, that she has\nnot been the less dutiful of late for your absence.\n\nOnce more, adieu, my dear Lady G----, and continue to love your\n\nHARRIET BYRON.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXVII\n\nLADY G----, TO MISS BYRON\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 27.\n\n\nEvery one of the Dunstable party say, that you are a grateful and good\ngirl. Beauchamp can talk of nobody else of our sex: I believe in my\nconscience he is in love with you. I think all the unprovided-for young\nwomen, wherever you come, must hate you. Was you never by surprise\ncarried into the chamber of a friend labouring with the smallpox, in the\ninfectious stage of it?--O, but I think you once said you had had that\ndistemper. But your mind, Harriet, were your face to be ruined, would\nmake you admirers. The fellows who could think of preferring even such a\nface to such a heart, may be turned over to the class of insignificants.\n\nIs not your aunt Selby, you ask, an excellent woman?--She is. I admire\nher. But I am very angry with you for deferring to another time,\nacquainting me with what she said of me. When we are taken with any\nbody, we love they should be taken with us. Teasing Harriet! You know\nwhat an immoderate quantity of curiosity I have. Never serve me so\nagain!\n\nI am in love with your cousin Lucy. Were either Fenwick or Greville good\nenough--But they are not. I think she shall have Mr. Orme. Nancy, you\nsay, is such another good girl. I don't doubt it. Is she not your\ncousin, and Lucy's sister? But I cannot undertake for every good girl\nwho wants a husband. I wish I had seen Lucy a fortnight ago: then Nancy\nmight have had Mr. Orme, and Lucy should have had Lord G----. He admires\nher greatly. And do you think that a man who at that time professed for\nme so much love and service, and all that, would have scrupled to oblige\nme, had I (as I easily should) proved to him, that he would have been a\nmuch happier man than he could hope to be with somebody else?\n\nYour uncle is a pleasant man: but tell him I say, that the man would be\nout of his wits, that did not make the preference he does in favour of\nhis dame Selby, as he calls her. Tell him also, if you please, in return\nfor his plain dealing, that I say, he studies too much for his\npleasantries: he is continually hunting for occasions to be smart. I\nhave heard my father say, that this was the fault of some wits of his\nacquaintance, whom he ranked among the witlings for it. If you think it\nwill mortify him more, you may tell him, (for I am very revengeful when I\nthink myself affronted,) that were I at liberty, which, God help me, I am\nnot! I would sooner choose for a husband the man I have, (poor soul, as I\nnow and then think him,) than such a teasing creature as himself, were\nboth in my power, and both of an age. And I should have this good reason\nfor my preference: your uncle and I should have been too much alike, and\nso been jealous of each other's wit; whereas I can make my honest Lord\nG---- look about him, and admire me strangely, whenever I please.\n\nBut I am, it seems, a person of a particular character. Every one, you\nsay, loves me, yet blames me. Odd characters, my dear, are needful to\nmake even characters shine. You good girls would not be valued as you\nare, if there were not bad ones. Have you not heard it said, that all\nhuman excellence is but comparative? Pray allow of the contrast. You, I\nam sure, ought. You are an ungrateful creature, if, whenever you think\nof my over-livelinesses, as you call 'em, you don't drop a courtesy, and\nsay, you are obliged to me.\n\nBut still the attack made upon you in your dressing-room at Colnebrook,\nby my sister and me, sticks in your stomach--And why so? We were willing\nto shew you, that we were not the silly people you must have thought us,\nhad we not been able to distinguish light from darkness. You, who ever\nwere, I believe, one of the frankest-hearted girls in Britain, and\nadmired for the ease and dignity given you by that frankness, were\ngrowing awkward, nay dishonest. Your gratitude! your gratitude! was the\ndust you wanted to throw into our eyes, that we might not see that you\nwere governed by a stronger motive. You called us your friends, your\nsisters, but treated us not as either; and this man, and that, and\nt'other, you could refuse; and why? No reason given for it; and we were\nto be popt off with your gratitude, truly!--We were to believe just what\nyou said, and no more; nay, not so much as you said. But we were not so\nimplicit. Nor would you, in our case, have been so.\n\nBut 'you, perhaps, would not have violently broken in upon a poor thing,\nwho thought we were blind, because she was not willing we should see.'--\nMay be not: but then, in that case, we were honester than you would have\nbeen; that's all. Here, said I, Lady L----, is this poor girl awkwardly\nstruggling to conceal what every body sees; and, seeing, applauds her\nfor, the man considered: [Yes, Harriet, the man considered; be pleased to\ntake that in:] let us, in pity, relieve her. She is thought to be frank,\nopen-hearted, communicative; nay, she passes herself upon us in those\ncharacters: she sees we keep nothing from her. She has been acquainted\nwith your love before wedlock; with my folly, in relation to Anderson:\nshe has carried her head above a score or two of men not contemptible.\nShe sits enthroned among us, while we make but common figures at her\nfootstool: she calls us sisters, friends, and twenty pretty names. Let\nus acquaint her, that we see into her heart; and why Lord D---- and\nothers are so indifferent with her. If she is ingenuous, let us spare\nher; if not, leave me to punish her--Yet we will keep up her punctilio as\nto our brother; we will leave him to make his own discoveries. She may\nconfide in his politeness; and the result will be happier for her;\nbecause she will then be under no restraint to us, and her native freedom\nof heart may again take its course.\n\nAgreed, agreed, said Lady L----. And arm-in-arm, we entered your\ndressing-room, dismissed the maid, and began the attack--And, O Harriet!\nhow you hesitated, paraded, fooled on with us, before you came to\nconfession! Indeed you deserved not the mercy we shewed you--So, child,\nyou had better to have let this part of your story sleep in peace.\n\nYou bid me not tell Emily, that your cousin is in love with her: but I\nthink I will. Girls begin very early to look out for admirers. It is\nbetter, in order to stay her stomach, to find out one for her, than that\nshe should find out one for herself; especially when the man is among\nourselves, as I may say, and both are in our own management, and at\ndistance from each other. Emily is a good girl; but she has\nsusceptibilities already: and though I would not encourage her, as yet,\nto look out of herself for happiness; yet I would give her consequence\nwith herself, and at the same time let her see, that there could be no\nmention made of any thing that related to her, but what she should be\nacquainted with. Dear girl! I love her as well as you; and I pity her\ntoo: for she, as well as somebody else, will have difficulties to contend\nwith, which she will not know easily how to get over; though she can, in\na flame so young, generously prefer the interest of a more excellent\nwoman to her own.--There, Harriet, is a grave paragraph: you'll like me\nfor it.\n\nYou are a very reflecting girl, in mentioning to me, so particularly,\nyour behaviour to your Grevilles, Fenwicks, and Ormes. What is that but\nsaying, See, Charlotte! I am a much more complacent creature to the\nmen, no one of which I intend to have, than you are to your husband!\n\nWhat a pious woman, indeed, must be your grandmamma, that she could\nsuspend her joy, her long-absent darling at her feet, till she had first\nthanked God for restoring her to her arms! But, in this instance, we see\nthe force of habitual piety. Though not so good as I should be myself, I\nrevere those who are so; and that I hope you will own is no bad sign.\n\nWell, but now for ourselves, and those about us.\n\nLady Olivia has written a letter from Windsor to Lady L----. It is in\nFrench; extremely polite. She promises to write to me from Oxford.\n\nLady Anne S---- made me a visit this morning. She was more concerned\nthan I wished to see her, on my confirming the report she had heard of my\nbrother's being gone abroad. I rallied her a little too freely, as it\nwas before Lord G---- and Lord L----. I never was better rebuked than by\nher; for she took out her pencil, and on the cover of a letter wrote\nthese lines from Shakespeare, and slid them into my hand:\n\n      \"And will you rend our ancient love asunder,\n      To join with men in scorning your poor friend?\n      It is not friendly; 'tis not maidenly:\n      Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,\n      Though I alone do feel the injury.\"\n\nI never, my dear, told you how freely this lady and I had talked of love:\nbut, freely as we had talked, I was not aware that the matter lay so deep\nin her heart. I knew not how to tell her that my brother had said, it\ncould not be. I could have wept over her when I read this paper; and I\nowned myself by a whisper justly rebuked. She charged me not to let any\nman see this; particularly not either of those present: and do you,\nHarriet, keep what I have written of Lady Anne to yourself.\n\nMy aunt Eleanor has written a congratulatory letter to me from York. Sir\nCharles, it seems, had acquainted her with Lord G----'s day, [Not my day,\nHarriet! that is not the phrase, I hope!] as soon as he knew it himself;\nand she writes, supposing that I was actually offered on it. Women are\nvictims on these occasions: I hope you'll allow me that. My brother has\nmade it a point of duty to acquaint his father's sister with every matter\nof consequence to the family; and now, she says, that both her nieces are\nso well disposed of, she will come to town very quickly to see her new\nrelations and us; and desires we will make room for her. And yet she\nowns, that my brother has informed her of his being obliged to go abroad;\nand she supposes him gone. As he is the beloved of her heart, I wonder\nshe thinks of making this visit now he is absent: but we shall all be\nglad to see my aunt Nell. She is a good creature, though an old maid. I\nhope the old lady has not utterly lost either her invention, or memory;\nand then, between both, I shall be entertained with a great number of\nlove-stories of the last age; and perhaps of some dangers and escapes;\nwhich may serve for warnings for Emily. Alas! alas! they will come too\nlate for your Charlotte!\n\nI have written already the longest letter that I ever wrote in my life:\nyet it is prating; and to you, to whom I love to prate. I have not near\ndone.\n\nYou bid me be good; and you threaten me, if I am not, with the ill\nopinion of all your friends: but I have such an unaccountable bias for\nroguery, or what shall I call it? that I believe it is impossible for me\nto take your advice. I have been examining myself. What a deuse is the\nmatter with me, that I cannot see my honest man in the same advantageous\nlight in which he appears to everybody else? Yet I do not, in my heart,\ndislike him. On the contrary, I know not, were I to look about me, far\nand wide, the man I would have wished to have called mine, rather than\nhim. But he is so important about trifles; so nimble, yet so slow: he is\nso sensible of his own intention to please, and has so many antic motions\nin his obligingness; that I cannot forbear laughing at the very time that\nI ought perhaps to reward him with a gracious approbation.\n\nI must fool on a little while longer, I believe: permit me, Harriet, so\nto do, as occasions arise.\n\n\n***\n\n\nAn instance, an instance in point, Harriet. Let me laugh as I write. I\ndid at the time.--What do you laugh at, Charlotte?--Why this poor man,\nor, as I should rather say, this lord and master of mine, has just left\nme. He has been making me both a compliment, and a present. And what do\nyou think the compliment is? Why, if I please, he will give away to a\nvirtuoso friend, his collection of moths and butterflies: I once, he\nremembered, rallied him upon them. And by what study, thought I, wilt\nthou, honest man, supply their place? If thou hast a talent this way,\npursue it; since perhaps thou wilt not shine in any other. And the best\nany thing, you know, Harriet, carries with it the appearance of\nexcellence. Nay, he would also part with his collection of shells, if I\nhad no objection.\n\nTo whom, my lord?--He had not resolved.--Why then, only as Emily is too\nlittle of a child, or you might give them to her. 'Too little of a\nchild, madam!' and a great deal of bustle and importance took possession\nof his features--Let me tell you, madam--I won't let you, my lord; and I\nlaughed.\n\nWell, madam, I hope here is something coming up that you will not disdain\nto accept of yourself.\n\nUp came groaning under the weight, or rather under the care, two servants\nwith baskets: a fine set of old Japan china with brown edges, believe me.\nThey sat down their baskets, and withdrew.\n\nWould you not have been delighted, Harriet, to see my lord busying\nhimself with taking out, and putting in the windows, one at a time, the\ncups, plates, jars, and saucers, rejoicing and parading over them, and\nshewing his connoisseurship to his motionless admiring wife, in\ncommending this and the other piece as a beauty? And, when he had done,\ntaking the liberty, as he phrased it, half fearful, half resolute, to\nsalute his bride for his reward; and then pacing backwards several steps,\nwith such a strut and a crow--I see him yet!--Indulge me, Harriet!--I\nburst into a hearty laugh; I could not help it: and he, reddening, looked\nround himself, and round himself, to see if anything was amiss in his\ngarb. The man, the man! honest friend, I could have said, (but had too\nmuch reverence for my husband,) is the oddity! Nothing amiss in the\ngarb. I quickly recollected myself, however, and put him in a good\nhumour, by proper marks of my gracious acceptance. On reflection, I\ncould not bear myself for vexing the honest man when he had meant to\noblige me.\n\nHow soon I may relapse again, I know not.--O Harriet! Why did you\nbeseech me to be good? I think in my heart I have the stronger\ninclination to be bad for it! You call me perverse: if you think me so,\nbid me be saucy, bid me be bad; and I may then, like other good wives,\ntake the contrary course for the sake of dear contradiction.\n\nShew not, however, (I in turn beseech you) to your grandmamma and aunt,\nsuch parts of this letter as would make them despise me. You say, you\nstand up for me; I have need of your advocateship: never let me want it.\nAnd do I not, after all, do a greater credit to my good man, when I can\nso heartily laugh in the wedded state, than if I were to sit down with my\nfinger in my eye?\n\nI have taken your advice, and presented my sister with my half of the\njewels. I desired her to accept them, as they were my mother's, and for\nher sake. This gave them a value with her, more than equal with their\nworth: but Lord L---- is uneasy, and declares he will not suffer Lady\nL---- long to lie under the obligation. Were every one of family in\nSouth Britain and North Britain to be as generous and disinterested as\nLord L---- and our family, the union of the two parts of the island would\nbe complete.\n\n\n***\n\n\nLord help this poor obliging man! I wish I don't love him, at last. He\nhas taken my hint, and has presented his collection of shells (a very\nfine one, he says, it is) to Emily; and they two are actually busied (and\nwill be for an hour or two, I doubt not) in admiring them; the one\nstrutting over the beauties, in order to enhance the value of the\npresent; the other courtesying ten times in a minute, to shew her\ngratitude. Poor man! When his virtuoso friend has got his butterflies\nand moths, I am afraid he must set up a turner's shop, for employment.\nIf he loved reading, I could, when our visiting hurries are over, set him\nto read to me the new things that come out, while I knot or work; and, if\nhe loved writing, to copy the letters which pass between you and me, and\nthose for you which I expect with so much impatience from my brother by\nmeans of Dr. Bartlett. I think he spells pretty well, for a lord.\n\nI have no more to say, at present, but compliments, without number or\nmeasure, to all you so deservedly love and honour; as well those I have\nnot seen, as those I have.\n\nOnly one thing: Reveal to me all the secrets of your heart, and how that\nheart is from time to time affected; that I may know whether you are\ncapable of that greatness of mind in a love-case, that you shew in all\nothers. We will all allow you to love Sir Charles Grandison. Those who\ndo, give honour to themselves, if their eyes stop not at person, his\nhaving so many advantages. For the same reason, I make no apologies, and\nnever did, for praising my brother, as any other lover of him might do.\n\nLet me know every thing how and about your fellows, too. Ah! Harriet,\nyou make not the use of power that I would have done in your situation.\nI was half-sorry when my hurrying brother made me dismiss Sir Walter; and\nyet, to have but two danglers after one, are poor doings for a fine lady.\nPoorer still, to have but one!\n\nHere's a letter as long as my arm. Adieu. I was loath to come to the\nname: but defer it ever so long, I must subscribe, at last,\n\nCHARLOTTE G----.\n\n\n\nLETTER XXXVIII\n\nMISS JERVOIS, TO MISS BYRON*\nMONDAY, MAY 1.\n\n* The letter to which this is an answer, as well as those written by Miss\nByron to her cousin Reeves, Lady L----, &c., and theirs in return, are\nomitted.\n\n\nO my dearest, my honoured Miss Byron, how you have shamed your Emily by\nsending a letter to her; such a sweet letter too! before I have paid my\nduty to you, in a letter of thanks for all your love to me, and for all\nyour kind instructions. But I began once, twice, and thrice, and wrote a\ngreat deal each time, but could not please myself: you, madam, are such a\nwriter, and I am such a poor thing at my pen!--But I know you will accept\nthe heart. And so my very diffidence shews pride; since it cannot be\nexpected from me to be a fine writer: and yet this very letter, I\nforesee, will be the worse for my diffidence, and not the better: for I\ndon't like this beginning, neither.--But come, it shall go. Am I not\nused to your goodness? And do you not bid me prattle to you, in my\nletters, as I used to do in your dressing-room? O what sweet advice have\nyou, and do you return for my silly prate! And so I will begin.\n\nAnd was you grieved at parting with your Emily on Saturday morning? I am\nsure I was very much concerned at parting with you. I could not help\ncrying all the way to town; and Lady G---- shed tears as well as I, and\nso did Lady L---- several times; and said, You were the loveliest, best\nyoung lady in the world. And we all praised likewise your aunt, your\ncousin Lucy, and young Mr. Selby. How good are all your relations! They\nmust be good! And Lord L----, and Lord G----, for men, were as much\nconcerned as we, at parting with you. Mr. Reeves was so dull all the\nway!--Poor Mr. Reeves, he was very dull. And Mr. Beauchamp, he praised\nyou to the very skies; and in such a pretty manner too! Next to my\nguardian, I think Mr. Beauchamp is a very agreeable man. I fancy these\nnoble sisters, if the truth were known, don't like him so well as their\nbrother does: perhaps that may be the reason, out of jealousy, as I may\nsay, if there be any thing in my observation. But they are vastly civil\nto him, nevertheless; yet they never praise him when his back is turned;\nas they do others, who can't say half the good things that he says.\n\nWell, but enough of Mr. Beauchamp. My guardian! my gracious, my kind, my\nindulgent guardian! who, that thinks of him, can praise any body else?\n\nO, madam! Where is he now? God protect and guide my guardian, wherever\nhe goes! This is my prayer, first and last, and I can't tell how often\nin the day. I look for him in every place I have seen him in; [And pray\ntell me, madam, did not you do so when he had left us?] and when I can't\nfind him, I do so sigh!--What a pleasure, yet what a pain, is there in\nsighing, when I think of him! Yet I know I am an innocent girl. And\nthis I am sure of, that I wish him to be the husband of but one woman in\nthe whole world; and that is you. But then my next wish is--You know\nwhat--Ah, my Miss Byron! you must let me live with you and my guardian,\nif you should ever be Lady Grandison.\n\nBut here, madam, are sad doings sometimes, between Lord and Lady G----.\nI am very angry at her often in my heart; yet I cannot help laughing,\nnow and then, at her out-of-the-way sayings. Is not her character a very\nnew one? Or are there more such young wives? I could not do as she\ndoes, were I to be queen of the globe. Every body blames her. She will\nmake my lord not love her, at last. Don't you think so? And then what\nwill she get by her wit?\n\n\n***\n\n\nJust this moment she came into my closet--Writing, Emily? said she: To\nwhom?--I told her.--Don't tell tales out of school, Emily.--I was so\nafraid that she would have asked to see what I had written: but she did\nnot. To be sure she is very polite, and knows what belongs to herself,\nand every body else: To be ungenerous, as you once said, to her husband\nonly, that is a very sad thing to think of.\n\nWell, and I would give any thing to know if you think what I have written\ntolerable, before I go any farther: But I will go on in this way, since I\ncannot do better. Bad is my best; but you shall have quantity, I\nwarrant, since you bid me write long letters.\n\nBut I have seen my mother: it was but yesterday. She was in a mercer's\nshop in Covent Garden. I was in Lord L----'s chariot; only Anne was with\nme. Anne saw her first. I alighted, and asked her blessing in the shop:\nI am sure I did right. She blessed me, and called me dear love. I\nstayed till she had bought what she wanted, and then I slid down the\nmoney, as if it were her own doing; and glad I was I had so much about\nme: It came but to four guineas. I begged her, speaking low, to forgive\nme for so doing: And finding she was to go home as far as Soho, and had\nthoughts of having a hackney coach called; I gave Anne money for a coach\nfor herself, and waited on my mother to her own lodgings; and it being\nLord L----'s chariot, she was so good as to dispense with my alighting.\n\nShe blessed my guardian all the way, and blessed me. She said, she would\nnot ask me to come to see her, because it might not be thought proper, as\nmy guardian was abroad: but she hoped, she might be allowed to come and\nsee me sometimes.--Was she not very good, madam? But my guardian's\ngoodness makes every body good.--O that my mamma had been always the\nsame! I should have been but too happy!\n\nGod bless my guardian, for putting me on enlarging her power to live\nhandsomely. Only as a coach brings on other charges, and people must\nlive accordingly, or be discredited, instead of credited, by it; or I\nshould hope the additional two hundred a-year might afford them one. Yet\none does not know but Mr. O'Hara may have been in debt before he married\nher; and I fancy he has people who hang upon him. But if it pleases God,\nI will not, when I am at age, and have a coach of my own, suffer my\nmother to walk on foot. What a blessing is it, to have a guardian that\nwill second every good purpose of one's heart!\n\nLady Olivia is rambling about; and I suppose she will wait here in\nEngland till Sir Charles's return: but I am sure he never will have her.\nA wicked wretch, with her poniards! Yet it is pity! She is a fine\nwoman. But I hate her for her expectation, as well as for her poniard.\nAnd a woman to leave her own country, to seek for a husband! I could die\nbefore I could do so! though to such a man as my guardian. Yet once I\nthought I could have liked to have lived with her at Florence. She has\nsome good qualities, and is very generous, and in the main well esteemed\nin her own country; every body knew she loved my guardian: but I don't\nknow how it is; nobody blamed her for it, vast as the difference in\nfortune then was. But that is the glory of being a virtuous man; to love\nhim is a credit, instead of a shame. O madam! Who would not be\nvirtuous? And that not only for their own, but for their friends sakes,\nif they loved their friends, and wished them to be well thought of?\n\nLord W---- is very desirous to hasten his wedding.\n\nMr. Beauchamp says, that all the Mansfields (He knows them) bless my\nguardian every day of their lives; and their enemies tremble. He has\ncommissions from my guardian to inquire and act in their cause, that no\ntime may be lost to do them service, against his return.\n\nWe have had another visit from Lady Beauchamp, and have returned it. She\nis very much pleased with us: You see I say us. Indeed my two dear\nladies are very good to me; but I have no merit: it is all for their\nbrother's sake.\n\nMr. Beauchamp tells us, just now, that his mother-in-law has joined with\nhis father, at her own motion, to settle 1000\u00c2\u00a3. a year upon him. I am\nglad of it, with all my heart: Are not you? He is all gratitude upon it.\nHe says, that he will redouble his endeavours to oblige her; and that his\ngratitude to her, as well as his duty to his father, will engage his\nutmost regard for her.\n\nMr. Beauchamp, Sir Harry himself, and my lady, are continually blessing\nmy guardian: Every body, in short, blesses him.--But, ah! madam, where is\nhe, at this moment? O that I were a bird! that I might hover over his\nhead, and sometimes bring tidings to his friends of his motions and good\ndeeds. I would often flap my wings, dear Miss Byron, at your chamber\nwindow, as a signal of his welfare, and then fly back again, and perch as\nnear him as I could.\n\nI am very happy, as I said before, in the favour of Lady and Lord L----,\nand Lady and Lord G----; but I never shall be so happy, as when I had the\naddition of your charming company. I miss you and my guardian: O, how I\nmiss you both! But, dearest Miss Byron, love me not the less, though now\nI have put pen to paper, and you see what a poor creature I am in my\nwriting. Many a one, I believe, may be thought tolerable in\nconversation; but when they are so silly as to put pen to paper, they\nexpose themselves; as I have done, in this long piece of scribble. But\naccept it, nevertheless, for the true love I bear you; and a truer love\nnever flamed in any bosom, to any one the most dearly beloved, than does\nin mine for you.\n\nI am afraid I have written arrant nonsense, because I knew not how to\nexpress half the love that is in the heart of\n\nYour ever-obliged and affectionate\nEMILY JERVOIS.\n\n\nLETTER XXXIX\n\nMISS BYRON, TO LADY G----\nTUESDAY, MAY 2.\n\n\nI have no patience with you, Lady G----. You are ungenerously playful!\nThank Heaven, if this be wit, that I have none of it. But what signifies\nexpostulating with one who knows herself to be faulty, and will not\namend? How many stripes, Charlotte, do you deserve?--But you never\nspared any body, not even your brother, when the humour was upon you. So\nmake haste; and since you will lay in stores for repentance, fill up your\nmeasure as fast as you can.\n\n'Reveal to you the state of my heart!'--Ah, my dear! it is an\nunmanageable one. 'Greatness of mind!'--I don't know what it is!--All\nhis excellencies, his greatness, his goodness, his modesty, his\ncheerfulness under such afflictions as would weigh down every other heart\nthat had but half the compassion in it with which his overflows--Must not\nall other men appear little, and, less than little, nothing, in my eyes?\n--It is an instance of patience in me, that I can endure any of them who\npretend to regard me out of my own family.\n\nI thought, that when I got down to my dear friends here, I should be\nbetter enabled, by their prudent counsels, to attain the desirable frame\nof mind which I had promised myself: but I find myself mistaken. My\ngrandmamma and aunt are such admirers of him, take such a share in the\ndisappointment, that their advice has not the effect I had hoped it would\nhave. Lucy, Nancy, are perpetually calling upon me to tell them\nsomething of Sir Charles Grandison; and when I begin, I know not how to\nleave off. My uncle rallies me, laughs at me, sometimes reminds me of\nwhat he calls my former brags. I did not brag, my dear: I only hoped,\nthat respecting as I did every man according to his merit, I should never\nbe greatly taken with any one, before duty added force to the\ninclination. Methinks the company of the friends I am with, does not\nsatisfy me; yet they never were dearer to me than they now are. I want\nto have Lord and Lady L----, Lord and Lady G----, Dr. Bartlett, my Emily,\nwith me. To lose you all at once!--is hard!--There seems to be a strange\nvoid in my heart--And so much, at present, for the state of that heart.\n\nI always had reason to think myself greatly obliged to my friends and\nneighbours all around us; but never, till my return, after these few\nmonths absence, knew how much. So many kind visitors; such unaffected\nexpressions of joy on my return; that had I not a very great\ncounterbalance on my heart, would be enough to make me proud.\n\nMy grandmamma went to Shirley-manor on Saturday; on Monday I was with her\nall day: but she would have it that I should be melancholy if I staid\nwith her. And she is so self-denyingly careful of her Harriet! There\nnever was a more noble heart in woman. But her solitary moments, as my\nuncle calls them, are her moments of joy. And why? Because she then\ndivests herself of all that is either painful or pleasurable to her in\nthis life: for she says, that her cares for her Harriet, and especially\nnow, are at least a balance for the delight she takes in her.\n\nYou command me to acquaint you with what passes between me and the\ngentlemen in my neighbourhood; in your style, my fellows.\n\nMr. Fenwick invited himself to breakfast with my aunt Selby yesterday\nmorning. I would not avoid him.\n\nI will not trouble you with the particulars: you know well enough what\nmen will say on the subject upon which you will suppose he wanted to talk\nto me. He was extremely earnest. I besought him to accept my thanks for\nhis good opinion of me, as all the return I could make him for it; and\nthis in so very serious a manner, that my heart was fretted, when he\ndeclared, with warmth, his determined perseverance.\n\nMr. Greville made us a tea-visit in the afternoon. My uncle and he\njoined to rally us poor women, as usual. I left the defence of the sex\nto my aunt and Lucy. How poor appears to me every conversation now with\nthese men!--But hold, saucy Harriet, was not your uncle Selby one of the\nraillers?--But he does not believe all he says; and therefore cannot\nwish to be so much regarded, on this topic, as he ought to be by me, on\nothers.\n\nAfter the run of raillery was over, in which Mr. Greville made exceptions\nfavourable to the women present, he applied to every one for their\ninterest with me, and to me to countenance his address. He set forth his\npretensions very pompously, and mentioned a very considerable increase of\nhis fortune; which before was a very handsome one. He offered our own\nterms. He declared his love for me above all women, and made his\nhappiness in the next world, as well as in this, depend upon my favour to\nhim.\n\nIt was easy to answer all he said; and is equally so for you to guess in\nwhat manner I answered him: And he, finding me determined, began to grow\nvehement, and even affrontive. He hinted to me, that he knew what had\nmade me so very resolute. He threw out threatenings against the man, be\nhe whom he would, that should stand in the way of his success with me; at\nthe same time intimating saucily, as I may say, (for his manner had\ninsult in it,) that it was impossible a certain event could ever take\nplace.\n\nMy uncle was angry with him; so was my aunt: Lucy was still more angry\nthan they: but I, standing up, said, Pray, my dear friends, take nothing\namiss that Mr. Greville has said.--He once told me, that he would set\nspies upon my conduct in town. If, sir, your spies have been just, I\nfear nothing they can say. But the hints you have thrown out, shew such\na total want of all delicacy of mind, that you must not wonder if my\nheart rejects you. Yet I am not angry: I reproach you not: Every one has\nhis peculiar way. All that is left me to say or to do, is to thank you\nfor your favourable opinion of me, as I have thanked Mr. Fenwick; and to\ndesire that you will allow me to look upon you as my neighbour, and only\nas my neighbour.\n\nI courtesied to him, and withdrew.\n\nBut my great difficulty had been before with Mr. Orme.\n\nHis sister had desired that I would see her brother. He and she were\ninvited by my aunt to dinner on Tuesday. They came. Poor man! He is\nnot well! I am sorry for it. Poor Mr. Orme is not well! He made me\nsuch honest compliments, as I may say: his heart was too much in his\ncivilities to raise them above the civilities that justice and truth\nmight warrant in favour of a person highly esteemed. Mine was filled\nwith compassion for him; and that compassion would have shewn itself in\ntokens of tenderness, more than once, had I not restrained myself for his\nsake. How you, my dear Lady G----, can delight in giving pain to an\nhonest heart, I cannot imagine. I would make all God Almighty's\ncreatures happy, if I could; and so would your noble brother. Is he not\ncrossing dangerous seas, and ascending, through almost perpetual snows,\nthose dreadful Alps which I have heard described with such terror, for\nthe generous end of relieving distress?\n\nI made Mr. Orme sit next me. I was assiduous to help him, and to do him\nall the little offices which I thought would light up pleasure in his\nmodest countenance; and he was quite another man. It gave delight to his\nsister, and to all my friends, to see him smile, and look happy.\n\nI think, my dear Lady G----, that when Mr. Orme looks pleasant, and at\nease, he resembles a little the good-natured Lord G----. O that you\nwould take half the pains to oblige him, that I do to relieve Mr. Orme!--\nHalf the pains, did I say? That you would not take pains to dis-oblige\nhim; and he would be, of course, obliged. Don't be afraid, my dear,\nthat, in such a world as this, things will not happen to make you uneasy\nwithout your studying for them.\n\nExcuse my seriousness: I am indeed too serious, at times.\n\nBut when Mr. Orme requested a few minutes' audience of me, as he called\nit, and I walked with him into the cedar parlour, which you have heard me\nmention, and with which I hope you will be one day acquainted; he paid,\npoor man! for his too transient pleasure. Why would he urge a denial\nthat he could not but know I must give?\n\nHis sister and I had afterwards a conference. She pleaded too strongly\nher brother's health, and even his life; both which, she would have it,\ndepended on my favour to him. I was greatly affected; and at last\nbesought her, if she valued my friendship as I did hers, never more to\nmention to me a subject which gave me a pain too sensible for my peace.\n\nShe requested me to assure her, that neither Mr. Greville, nor Mr.\nFenwick, might be the man. They both took upon them, she said, to\nridicule her brother for the profound respect, even to reverence, that he\nbore me; which, if he knew, might be attended with consequences: for that\nher brother, mild and gentle as was his passion for me, had courage to\nresent any indignities that might be cast upon him by spirits boisterous\nas were those of the two gentlemen she had named. She never, therefore,\ntold her brother of their scoffs. But it would go to her heart, if\neither of them should succeed, or have reason but for a distant hope.\n\nI made her heart easy, on that score.\n\nI have just now heard, that Sir Hargrave Pollexfen is come from abroad\nalready. What can be the meaning of it? He is so low-minded, so\nmalicious a man, and I have suffered so much from him--What can be the\nmeaning of his sudden return? I am told, that he is actually in London.\nPray, my dear Lady G----, inform yourself about him; and whether he\nthinks of coming into these parts.\n\nMr. Greville, when he met us at Stoney-Stratford, threw out menaces\nagainst Sir Hargrave, on my account; and said, It was well he was gone\nabroad. I told him then, that he had no business, even were Sir Hargrave\npresent, to engage himself in my quarrels.\n\nMr. Greville is an impetuous man; a man of rough manners; and makes many\npeople afraid of him. He has, I believe, indeed, had his spies about me;\nfor he seems to know every thing that has befallen me in my absence from\nSelby House.\n\nHe has dared also to threaten somebody else. Insolent wretch! But he\nhinted to me yesterday, that he was exceedingly pleased with the news,\nthat a certain gentleman was gone abroad, in order to prosecute a former\namour, was the light wretch's as light expression. If my indignant eyes\ncould have killed him, he would have fallen dead at my feet.\n\nLet the constant and true respects of all my friends to you and yours,\nand to my beloved Emily, be always, for the future, considered as very\naffectionately expressed, whether the variety of other subjects leaves\nroom for a particular expression of them, or not, by, my dearest Lady\nG----,\n\nYour faithful, and ever-obliged\nHARRIET BYRON.\n\n\n\nLETTER XL\n\nLADY G----, TO MISS BYRON\nSATURDAY, MAY 6.\n\n\nI thank you, Harriet, for yours. What must your fellows think of you?\nIn this gross age, your delicacy must astonish them. There used to be\nmore of it formerly. But how should men know any thing of it, when women\nhave forgot it? Lord be thanked, we females, since we have been admitted\ninto so constant a share of the public diversions, want not courage. We\ncan give the men stare for stare wherever we meet them. The next age,\nnay, the rising generation, must surely be all heroes and heroines. But\nwhither has this word delicacy carried me? Me, who, it seems, have\nfaults to be corrected for of another sort; and who want not the courage\nfor which I congratulate others?\n\nBut to other subjects. I could write a vast deal of stuff about my lord\nand self, and Lord and Lady L----, who assume parts which I know not how\nto allow them: and sometimes they threaten me with my brother's\nresentments, sometimes with my Harriet's; so that I must really have\nleading-strings fastened to my shoulders. O, my dear, a fond husband is\na surfeiting thing; and yet I believe most women love to be made monkeys\nof.\n\n\n***\n\n\nBut all other subjects must now give way. We have heard of, though not\nfrom, my brother. A particular friend of Mr. Lowther was here with a\nletter from that gentleman, acquainting us, that Sir Charles and he were\narrived at Paris.\n\nMr. Beauchamp was with us when Mr. Lowther's friend came. He borrowed\nthe letter on account of the extraordinary adventure mentioned in it.\n\nMake your heart easy, in the first place, about Sir Hargrave. He is\nindeed in town; but very ill. He was frightened into England, and\nintends not ever again to quit it. In all probability, he owes it to my\nbrother that he exists.\n\nMr. Beauchamp went directly to Cavendish-square, and informed himself\nthere of other particulars relating to the affair, from the very servant\nwho was present, and acting in it; and from those particulars, and Mr.\nLowther's letter, wrote one for Dr. Bartlett. Mr. Beauchamp obliged me\nwith the perusal of what he wrote; whence I have extracted the following\naccount: for his letter is long and circumstantial; and I did not ask his\nleave to take a copy, as he seemed desirous to hasten it to the doctor.\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the 19-30 of April, in the evening, as my brother was\npursuing his journey to Paris, and was within two miles of that capital,\na servant-man rode up, in visible terror, to his post-chaise, in which\nwere Mr. Lowther and himself, and besought them to hear his dreadful\ntale. The gentlemen stopt, and he told them, that his master, who was an\nEnglishman, and his friend of the same nation, had been but a little\nwhile before attacked, and forced out of the road in their post-chaise,\nas he doubted not, to be murdered, by no less than seven armed horsemen;\nand he pointed to a hill, at distance, called Mont Matre, behind which\nthey were, at that moment, perpetrating their bloody purpose. He had\njust before, he said, addressed himself to two other gentlemen, and their\nretinue, who drove on the faster for it.\n\nThe servant's great coat was open; and Sir Charles observing his livery,\nasked him, If he were not a servant of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen? and was\nanswered in the affirmative.\n\nThere are, it seems, trees planted on each side the road from St. Denis\nto Paris, but which, as France is an open and uninclosed country, would\nnot, but for the hill, have hindered the seeing a great way off, the\nscuffling of so many men on horseback. There is also a ditch on either\nhand; but places left for owners to come at their grounds, with their\ncarts, and other carriages. Sir Charles ordered the post boy to drive to\none of those passages; saying, He could not forgive himself, if he did\nnot endeavour to save Sir Hargrave, and his friend, whose name the man\ntold him was Merceda.\n\nHis own servants were three in number, besides one of Mr. Lowther. My\nbrother made Mr. Lowther's servant dismount; and, getting himself on his\nhorse, ordered the others to follow him. He begged Mr. Lowther to\ncontinue in the chaise, bidding the dismounted servant stay, and attend\nhis master, and galloped away towards the hill. His ears were soon\npierced with the cries of the poor wretches; and presently he saw two men\non horseback holding the horses of four others, who had under them the\ntwo gentlemen, struggling, groaning, and crying out for mercy.\n\nSir Charles, who was a good way a-head of his servants, calling out to\nspare the gentlemen, and bending his course to relieve the prostrate\nsufferers, two of the four quitted their prey, and mounting, joined the\nother two horsemen, and advanced to meet him, with a shew of supporting\nthe two men on foot in their violence; who continued laying on the\nwretches, with the but-ends of their whips, unmercifully.\n\nAs the assailants offered not to fly, and as they had more than time\nenough to execute their purpose, had it been robbery and murder; Sir\nCharles concluded it was likely that these men were actuated by a private\nrevenge. He was confirmed in this surmise, when the four men on\nhorseback, though each had his pistol ready drawn, as Sir Charles also\nhad his, demanded a conference; warning Sir Charles how he provoked his\nfate by his rashness; and declaring, that he was a dead man if he fired.\n\nForbear, then, said Sir Charles, all further violences to the gentlemen,\nand I will hear what you have to say.\n\nHe then put his pistol into his holster; and one of his servants being\ncome up, and the two others at hand, (to whom he called out, not to fire\ntill they had his orders,) he gave him his horse's reins; bidding him\nhave an eye on the holsters of both, and leapt down; and, drawing his\nsword, made towards the two men who were so cruelly exercising their\nwhips; and who, on his approach, retired to some little distance, drawing\ntheir hangers.\n\nThe four men on horseback joined the two on foot, just as they were\nquitting the objects of their fury; and one of them said, Forbear, for\nthe present, further violence, brother; the gentleman shall be told the\ncause of all this.--Murder, sir, said he, is not intended; nor are we\nrobbers: the men whom you are solicitous to save from our vengeance, are\nvillains.\n\nBe the cause what it will, answered Sir Charles, you are in a country\nnoted for doing speedy justice, upon proper application to the\nmagistrates. In the same instant he raised first one groaning man, then\nthe other. Their heads were all over bloody, and they were so much\nbruised, that they could not extend their arms to reach their wigs and\nhats, which lay near them; nor put them on without Sir Charles's help.\n\nThe men on foot by this time had mounted their horses, and all six stood\nupon their defence; but one of them was so furious, crying out, that his\nvengeance should be yet more complete, that two of the others could\nhardly restrain him.\n\nSir Charles asked Sir Hargrave and Mr. Merceda, Whether they had reason\nto look upon themselves as injured men, or injurers? One of the\nassailants answered, That they both knew themselves to be villains.\n\nEither from consciousness, or terror, perhaps from both, they could not\nspeak for themselves, but by groans; nor could either of them stand or\nsit upright.\n\nJust then came up, in the chaise, Mr. Lowther and his servant, each a\npistol in his hand. He quitted the chaise, when he came near the\nsuffering men; and Sir Charles desired him instantly to examine whether\nthe gentlemen were dangerously hurt, or not.\n\nThe most enraged of the assailants, having slipt by the two who were\nearnest to restrain him, would again have attacked Mr. Merceda; offering\na stroke at him with his hanger: but Sir Charles (his drawn sword still\nin his hand) caught hold of his bridle; and, turning his horse's head\naside, diverted a stroke, which, in all probability, would otherwise have\nbeen a finishing one.\n\nThey all came about Sir Charles, bidding him, at his peril, use his sword\nupon their friend: and Sir Charles's servants were coming up to their\nmaster's support, had there been occasion. At that instant Mr. Lowther,\nassisted by his own servant, was examining the wounds and bruises of the\ntwo terrified men, who had yet no reason to think themselves safe from\nfurther violence.\n\nSir Charles repeatedly commanded his servants not to fire, nor approach\nnearer, without his orders. The persons, said he, to the assailants,\nwhom you have so cruelly used, are Englishmen of condition. I will\nprotect them. Be the provocation what it will, you must know that your\nattempt upon them is a criminal one; and if my friend last come up, who\nis a very skilful surgeon, shall pronounce them in danger, you shall find\nit so.\n\nStill he held the horse of the furious one; and three of them who seemed\nto be principals, were beginning to express some resentment at his\ncavalier treatment, when Mr. Lowther gave his opinion, that there was no\napparent danger of death: and then Sir Charles, quitting the man's\nbridle, and putting himself between the assailants and sufferers, said,\nThat as they had not either offered to fly, or to be guilty of violence\nto himself, his friend, or servants; he was afraid they had some reason\nto think themselves ill used by the gentlemen. But, however, as they\ncould not suppose they were at liberty, in a civilized country, to take\ntheir revenge on the persons of those who were entitled to the protection\nof that country; he should expect, that they would hold themselves to be\npersonally answerable for their conduct at a proper tribunal.\n\nThe villains, one of the men said, knew who they were, and what the\nprovocation was; which had merited a worse treatment than they had\nhitherto met with. You, sir, proceeded he, seem to be a man of honour,\nand temper: we are men of honour, as well as you. Our design, as we told\nyou, was not to kill the miscreants; but to give them reason to remember\ntheir villainy as long as they lived; and to put it out of their power\never to be guilty of the like. They have made a vile attempt, continued\nhe, on a lady's honour at Abbeville; and, finding themselves detected,\nand in danger, took roundabout ways, and shifted from one vehicle to\nanother, to escape the vengeance of her friends. The gentleman, whose\nhorse you held, and who has reason to be in a passion, is the husband of\nthe lady. [A Spanish husband, surely, Harriet; not a French one,\naccording to our notions.] That gentleman, and that, are her brothers.\nWe have been in pursuit of them two days; for they gave out, (in order,\nno doubt, to put us on a wrong scent,) that they were to go to Antwerp.\n\nAnd it seems, my dear, that Sir Hargrave and his colleague had actually\nsent some of their servants that way; which was the reason that they were\nthemselves attended but by one.\n\nThe gentleman told Sir Charles that there was a third villain in their\nplot. They had hopes, he said, that he would not escape the close\npursuit of a manufacturer at Abbeville, whose daughter, a lovely young\ncreature, he had seduced, under promises of marriage. Their government,\nhe observed, were great countenancers of the manufacturers at Abbeville;\nand he would have reason, if he were laid hold of, to think himself\nhappy, if he came off with being obliged to perform his promises.\n\nThis third wretch must be Mr. Bagenhall. The Lord grant, say I, that he\nmay be laid hold of; and obliged to make a ruined girl an honest woman,\nas they phrase it in LANCASHIRE. Don't you wish so, my dear? And let me\nadd, that had the relations of the injured lady completed their intended\nvengeance on those two libertines; (a very proper punishment, I ween, for\nall libertines;) it might have helped them to pass the rest of their\nlives with great tranquillity; and honest girls might, for any\ncontrivances of theirs, have passed to and from masquerades without\nmolestation.\n\nSir Hargrave and his companion intended, it seems, at first, to make some\nresistance; four only, of the seven, stopping the chaise: but when the\nother three came up, and they saw who they were, and knew their own\nguilt, their courage failed them.\n\nThe seventh man was set over the post-boy, whom he had led about half a\nmile from the spot they had chosen as a convenient one for their purpose.\n\nSir Hargrave's servant was secured by them at their first attack; but\nafter they had disarmed him and his masters, he found an opportunity to\nslip from them, and made the best of his way to the road, in hopes of\nprocuring assistance for them.\n\nWhile Sir Charles was busy in helping the bruised wretches on their feet,\nthe seventh man came up to the others, followed by Sir Hargrave's chaise.\nThe assailants had retired to some distance, and, after a consultation\ntogether, they all advanced towards Sir Charles; who, bidding his\nservants be on their guard, leapt on his horse, with that agility and\npresence of mind, for which, Mr. Beauchamp says, he excels most men; and\nleading towards them, Do you advance, gentlemen, said he, as friends, or\notherwise?--Mr. Lowther took a pistol in each hand, and held himself\nready to support him; and the servants disposed themselves to obey their\nmaster's orders.\n\nOur enmity, answered one of them, is only to these two inhospitable\nvillains: murder, as we told you, was not our design. They know where we\nare to be found; and that they are the vilest of men, and have not been\npunished equal to their demerits. Let them on their knees ask this\ngentleman's pardon; pointing to the husband of the insulted lady. We\ninsist upon this satisfaction; and upon their promise, that they never\nmore will come within two leagues of Abbeville; and we will leave them to\nyour protection. I fancy, Harriet, that these women-frightening heroes\nneeded not to have been urged to make this promise.\n\nSir Charles, turning towards them, said, If you have done wrong,\ngentlemen, you ought not to scruple asking pardon. If you know\nyourselves to be innocent, though I should be loath to risk the lives of\nmy friend and servants, yet shall not my countrymen make so undue a\nsubmission.\n\nThe wretches kneeled; and the seven men, civilly saluting Sir Charles and\nMr. Lowther, rode off; to the joy of the two delinquents, who kneeled\nagain to their deliverer, and poured forth blessings upon the man whose\nlife, so lately, one of them sought; and whose preservation he had now so\nmuch reason to rejoice in, for the sake of his own safety.\n\nMy brother himself could not but be well pleased that he was not obliged\nto come to extremities, which might have ended fatally on both sides.\n\nBy this time Sir Hargrave's post-chaise was come up. He and his\ncolleague were with difficulty lifted into it. My brother and Mr.\nLowther went into theirs; and being but a small distance from Paris, they\nproceeded thither in company; the poor wretches blessing them all the\nway; and at Paris found their other servants waiting for them.\n\nSir Charles and Mr. Lowther saw them in bed in the lodgings that had been\ntaken for them. They were so stiff with the bastinado they had met with,\nthat they were unable to help themselves. Mr. Merceda had been more\nseverely (I cannot call it more cruelly) treated than the other; for he,\nit seems, was the greatest malefactor in the attempt made upon the lady:\nand he had, besides, two or three gashes, which, but for his struggles,\nwould have been but one.\n\nAs you, my dear, always turn pale when the word masquerade is mentioned;\nso, I warrant, will ABBEVILLE be a word of terror to these wretches, as\nlong as they live.\n\nTheir enemies, it seems, carried off their arms; perhaps, in the true\nspirit of French chivalry, with a view to lay them, as so many trophies,\nat the feet of the insulted lady.\n\nMr. Lowther writes, that my brother and he are lodged in the hotel of a\nman of quality, a dear friend of the late Mr. Danby, and one of the three\nwhom he has remembered in his will; and that Sir Charles is extremely\nbusy in relation to the executorship; and, having not a moment to spare,\ndesired Mr. Lowther to engage his friend, to whom he wrote, to let us\nknow as much; and that he was hastening every thing for his journey\nonwards.\n\nMr. Beauchamp's narrative of this affair is, as I told you, very\ncircumstantial. I thought to have shortened it more than I have done. I\nwish I have not made my abstract confused, in several material places:\nbut I have not time to clear it up. Adieu, my dear.\n\nCHARLOTTE G----.\n\n\n\nLETTER XLI\n\nLADY G----, TO MISS BYRON\nSUNDAY, MAY 7.\n\n\nI believe I shall become as arrant a scribbler as somebody else. I begin\nto like writing. A great compliment to you, I assure you. I see one may\nbring one's mind to any thing.--I thought I must have had recourse, when\nyou and my brother left us, and when I was married, to the public\namusements, to fill up my leisure: and as I have seen every thing worth\nseeing of those, many times over; (masquerades excepted, and them I\ndespise;) time, you know, in that case, would have passed a little\nheavily, after having shewn myself, and, by seeing who and who were\ntogether, laid in a little store of the right sort of conversation for\nthe tea-table. For you know, Harriet, that among us modern fine people,\nthe company, and not the entertainment, is the principal part of the\nraree-show. Pretty enough! to make the entertainment, and pay for it\ntoo, to the honest fellows, who have nothing to do, but to project\nschemes to get us together.\n\nI don't know what to do with this man. I little thought that I was to be\nconsidered as such a doll, such a toy, as he would make me. I want to\ndrive him out of the house without me, were it but to purvey for me news\nand scandal. What are your fine gentlemen fit for else? You know, that,\nwith all my faults, I have a domestic and managing turn. A man should\nencourage that in a wife, and not be perpetually teasing her for her\ncompany abroad, unless he did it with a view to keep her at home. Our\nsex don't love to be prescribed to, even in the things from which they\nare not naturally averse: and for this very reason, perhaps, because it\nbecomes us to submit to prescription. Human nature, Harriet, is a\nperverse thing. I believe, if my good man wished me to stay at home, I\nshould torture my brain, as other good wives do, for inventions to go\nabroad.\n\nIt was but yesterday, that in order to give him a hint, I pinned my apron\nto his coat, without considering who was likely to be a sufferer by it;\nand he, getting up, in his usual nimble way, gave it a rent, and then\nlooked behind him with so much apprehension--Hands folded, eyes goggling,\nbag in motion from shoulder to shoulder. I was vexed too much to make\nthe use of the trick which I had designed, and huffed him. He made\nexcuses, and looked pitifully; bringing in his soul, to testify that he\nknew not how it could be. How it could be! Wretch! When you are always\nsquatting upon one's clothes, in defiance of hoop, or distance.\n\nHe went out directly, and brought me in two aprons, either of which was\nworth twenty of that he so carelessly rent. Who could be angry with him?\n--I was, indeed, thinking to chide him for this--As if I were not to be\ntrusted to buy my own clothes; but he looked at me with so good-natured\nan eye, that I relented, and accepted, with a bow of graciousness, his\npresent; only calling him an odd creature--And that he is, you know, my\ndear.\n\nWe live very whimsically, in the main: not above four quarrels, however,\nand as many more chidings, in a day. What does the man stay at home for\nthen so much, when I am at home?--Married people, by frequent absences,\nmay have a chance for a little happiness. How many debatings, if not\ndirect quarrels, are saved by the good man's and his meek wife's seeing\neach other but once or twice a week! In what can men and women, who are\nmuch together, employ themselves, but in proving and defending,\nquarrelling and making up? Especially if they both chance to marry for\nlove (which, thank Heaven, is not altogether my case); for then both\nhonest souls, having promised more happiness to each other than they can\npossibly meet with, have nothing to do but reproach each other, at least\ntacitly, for their disappointment--A great deal of free-masonry in love,\nmy dear, believe me! The secret, like that, when found out, is hardly\nworth the knowing.\n\nWell, but what silly rattle is this, Charlotte! methinks you say, and put\non one of your wisest looks.\n\nNo matter, Harriet! There may be some wisdom in much folly. Every one\nspeaks not out so plainly as I do. But when the novelty of an\nacquisition or change of condition is over, be the change or the\nacquisition what it will, the principal pleasure is over, and other\nnovelties are hunted after, to keep the pool of life from stagnating.\n\nThis is a serious truth, my dear, and I expect you to praise me for it.\nYou are very sparing of your praise to poor me; and yet I had rather have\nyour good word, than any woman's in the world: or man's either, I was\ngoing to say; but I should then have forgot my brother. As for Lord\nG----, were I to accustom him to obligingness, I should destroy my own\nconsequence: for then it would be no novelty; and he would be hunting\nafter a new folly.--Very true, Harriet.\n\nWell, but we have had a good serious falling-out; and it still subsists.\nIt began on Friday night; present, Lord and Lady L----, and Emily. I was\nvery angry with him for bringing it on before them. The man has no\ndiscretion, my dear; none at all. And what about? Why, we have not made\nour appearance at court, forsooth.\n\nA very confident thing, this same appearance, I think! A compliment made\nto fine clothes and jewels, at the expense of modesty.\n\nLord G---- pleads decorum--Decorum against modesty, my dear!--But if by\ndecorum is meant fashion, I have in a hundred instances found decorum\nbeat modesty out of the house. And as my brother, who would have been\nour principal honour on such an occasion, is gone abroad; and as ours is\nan elderly novelty, as I may say, [Our fineries were not ready, you know,\nbefore my brother went,] I was fervent against it.\n\n'I was the only woman of condition, in England, who would be against it.'\n\nI told my lord, that was a reflection on my sex: but Lord and Lady L----,\nwho had been spoken to, I believe, by Lady Gertrude, were both on his\nside--[I shall have this man utterly ruined for a husband among you]--\nWhen there were three to one, it would have looked cowardly to yield, you\nknow. I was brave. But it being proposed for Sunday, and that being at\na little distance, it was not doubted but I would comply. So the night\npassed off, with prayings, hopings, and a little mutteration. [Allow me\nthat word, or find me a better.] The entreaty was renewed in the\nmorning; but, no!--'I was ashamed of him,' he said. I asked him if he\nreally thought so?--'He should think so, if I refused him.' Heaven\nforbid, my lord, that I, who contend for the liberty of acting, should\nhinder you from the liberty of thinking! Only one piece of advice,\nhonest friend, said I: don't imagine the worst against yourself: and\nanother, if you have a mind to carry a point with me, don't bring on the\ncause before any body else: for that would be to doubt either my duty, or\nyour own reasonableness.\n\nAs sure as you are alive, Harriet, the man made an exception against\nbeing called honest friend; as if, as I told him, either of the words\nwere incompatible with quality. So, once, he was as froppish as a child,\non my calling him the man; a higher distinction, I think, than if I had\ncalled him a king, or a prince. THE MAN!--Strange creature! To except to\na distinction that implies, that he is the man of men!--You see what a\ncaptious mortal I have been forced to call my lord. But lord and master\ndo not always go together; though they do too often, for the happiness of\nmany a meek soul of our sex.\n\nWell, this debate seemed suspended, by my telling him, that if I were\npresented at court, I would not have either the Earl or Lady Gertrude go\nwith us, the very people who were most desirous to be there--But I might\nnot think of that, at the time, you know--I would not be thought very\nperverse; only a little whimsical, or so. And I wanted not an excellent\nreason for excluding them--'Are their consents to our past affair\ndoubted, my lord, said I, that you think it necessary for them to appear\nto justify us?'\n\nHe could say nothing to this, you know. And I should never forgive the\nhusband, as I told him, on another occasion, who would pretend to argue,\nwhen he had nothing to say.\n\nThen (for the baby will be always craving something) he wanted me to go\nabroad with him--I forget whither--But to some place that he supposed\n(poor man!) I should like to visit. I told him, I dared to say, he\nwished to be thought a modern husband, and a fashionable man; and he\nwould get a bad name, if he could never stir out without his wife.\nNeither could he answer that, you know.\n\nWell, we went on, mutter, mutter, grumble, grumble, the thunder rolling\nat a distance; a little impatience now and then, however, portending,\nthat it would come nearer. But, as yet, it was only, Pray, my dear,\noblige me; and, Pray, my lord, excuse me; till this morning, when he had\nthe assurance to be pretty peremptory; hinting, that the lord in waiting\nhad been spoken to. A fine time of it would a wife have, if she were not\nat liberty to dress herself as she pleases. Were I to choose again, I do\nassure you, my dear, it should not be a man, who by his taste for moths\nand butterflies, shells, china, and such-like trifles, would give me\nwarning, that he would presume to dress his baby, and when he had done,\nwould perhaps admire his own fancy more than her person. I believe, my\nHarriet, I shall make you afraid of matrimony: but I will pursue my\nsubject, for all that--\n\nWhen the insolent saw that I did not dress, as he would have had me; he\ndrew out his face, glouting, to half the length of my arm; but was\nsilent. Soon after Lady L---- sending to know whether her lord and she\nwere to attend us to the drawing-room, and I returning for answer, that I\nshould be glad of their company at dinner; he was in violent wrath.\nTrue, as you are alive! and dressing himself in a great hurry, left the\nhouse, without saying, By your leave, With your leave, or whether he\nwould return to dinner, or not. Very pretty doings, Harriet!\n\nLord and Lady L---- came to dinner, however. I thought they were very\nkind, and, till they opened their lips, was going to thank them: for\nthen, it was all elder sister, and insolent brother-in-law, I do assure\nyou. Upon my word, Harriet, they took upon them. Lady L---- told me, I\nmight be the happiest creature in the world, if--and there was so good as\nto stop.\n\nOne of the happiest only, Lady L----! Who can be happier than you?\n\nBut I, said she, should neither be so, nor deserve to be so, if--Good of\nher again, to stop at if.\n\nWe cannot be all of one mind, replied I. I shall be wiser, in time.\n\nWhere was poor Lord G---- gone?\n\nPoor Lord G---- is gone to seek his fortune, I believe.\n\nWhat did I mean?\n\nI told them the airs he had given himself; and that he was gone without\nleave, or notice of return.\n\nHe had served me right, ab-solutely right, Lord L---- said.\n\nI believed so myself. Lord G---- was a very good sort of man, and ought\nnot to bear with me so much as he had done: but it would be kind in them,\nnot to tell him what I had owned.\n\nThe earl lifted up one hand; the countess both. They had not come to\ndine with me, they said, after the answer I had returned, but as they\nwere afraid something was wrong between us.\n\nMediators are not to be of one side only, I said: and as they had been so\nkindly free in blaming me, I hoped they would be as free with him, when\nthey saw him.\n\nAnd then it was, For God's sake, Charlotte; and, Let me entreat you, Lady\nG----. And let me, too, beseech you, madam, said Emily, with tears\nstealing down her cheeks.\n\nYou are both very good: you are a sweet girl, Emily. I have a\ntoo-playful heart. It will give me some pain, and some pleasure; but if\nI had not more pleasure than pain from my play, I should not be so silly.\n\nMy lord not coming in, and the dinner being ready, I ordered it to be\nserved.--Won't you wait a little longer for Lord G----? No. I hope he\nis safe, and well. He is his own master, as well as mine; (I sighed, I\nbelieve!) and, no doubt, has a paramount pleasure in pursuing his own\nchoice.\n\nThey raved. I begged that they would let us eat our dinner with comfort.\nMy lord, I hoped, would come in with a keen appetite, and Nelthorpe\nshould get a supper for him that he liked.\n\nWhen we had dined, and retired into the adjoining drawing-room, I had\nanother schooling-bout: Emily was even saucy. But I took it all: yet, in\nmy heart, was vexed at Lord G----'s perverseness.\n\nAt last, in came the honest man. He does not read this, and so cannot\ntake exceptions, and I hope you will not, at the word honest.\n\nSo lordly! so stiff! so solemn!--Upon my word!--Had it not been Sunday, I\nwould have gone to my harpsichord directly. He bowed to Lord and Lady\nL----, and to Emily, very obligingly; to me he nodded.--I nodded again;\nbut, like a good-natured fool, smiled. He stalked to the chimney; turned\nhis back towards it, buttoned up his mouth, held up his glowing face, as\nif he were disposed to crow; yet had not won the battle.--One hand in his\nbosom; the other under the skirt of his waistcoat, and his posture firmer\nthan his mind.--Yet was my heart so devoid of malice, that I thought his\nattitude very genteel; and, had we not been man and wife, agreeable.\n\nWe hoped to have found your lordship at home, said Lord L----, or we\nshould not have dined here.\n\nIf Lord G---- is as polite a husband as a man, said I, he will not thank\nyour lordship for this compliment to his wife.\n\nLord G---- swelled, and reared himself up. His complexion, which was\nbefore in a glow, was heightened.\n\nPoor man! thought I.--But why should my tender heart pity obstinate\npeople?--Yet I could not help being dutiful.--Have you dined, my lord?\nsaid I, with a sweet smile, and very courteous.\n\nHe stalked to the window, and never a word answered he.\n\nPray, Lady L----, be so good as to ask my Lord G---- if he has dined?\nWas not this very condescending, on such a behaviour?\n\nLady L---- asked him; and as gently-voiced as if she were asking the same\nquestion of her own lord. Lady L---- is a kind-hearted soul, Harriet.\nShe is my sister.\n\nI have not, madam, to Lady L----, turning rudely from me, and, not very\ncivilly, from her. Ah! thought I, these men! The more they are courted\n--Wretches! to find their consequence in a woman's meekness--Yet, I could\nnot forbear shewing mine.--Nature, Harriet! Who can resist constitution?\n\nWhat stiff airs are these! approaching him.--I do assure you, my lord, I\nshall not take this behaviour well; and put my hand on his arm.\n\nI was served right. Would you believe it? The man shook off my\ncondescending hand, by raising his elbow scornfully. He really did!\n\nNay, then!--I left him, and retired to my former seat. I was vexed that\nit was Sunday: I wanted a little harmony.\n\nLord and Lady L---- both blamed me, by their looks; and my lady took my\nhand, and was leading me towards him. I shewed a little reluctance: and,\nwould you have thought it? out of the drawing-room whipt my nimble lord,\nas if on purpose to avoid being moved by my concession.\n\nI took my place again.\n\nI beg of you, Charlotte, said Lady L----, go to my lord. You have used\nhim ill.\n\nWhen I think so, I will follow your advice, Lady L----.\n\nAnd don't you think so, Lady G----? said Lord L----.\n\nWhat! for taking my own option how I would be dressed to-day?--What! for\ndeferring--That moment in came my bluff lord--Have I not, proceeded I,\nbeen forced to dine without him to-day? Did he let me know what account\nI could give of his absence? Or when he would return?--And see, now, how\nangry he looks!\n\nHe traversed the room--I went on--Did he not shake off my hand, when I\nlaid it, smiling, on his arm? Would he answer me a question, which I\nkindly put to him, fearing he had not dined, and might be sick for want\nof eating? Was I not forced to apply to Lady L---- for an answer to my\ncareful question, on his scornfully turning from me in silence?--Might we\nnot, if he had not gone out so abruptly, nobody knows where, have made\nthe appearance his heart is so set upon?--But now, indeed, it is too\nlate.\n\nOons, madam! said he, and he kimboed his arms, and strutted up to me.\nNow for a cuff, thought I. I was half afraid of it: but out of the room\nagain capered he.\n\nLord bless me, said I, what a passionate creature is this!\n\nLord and Lady L---- both turned from me with indignation. But no wonder\nif one, that they both did. They are a silly pair; and I believe have\nagreed to keep each other in countenance in all they do.\n\nBut Emily affected me. She sat before in one corner of the room,\nweeping; and just then ran to me, and, wrapping her arms about me, Dear,\ndear Lady G----, said she, for Heaven's sake, think of what our Miss\nByron said; 'Don't jest away your own happiness.' I don't say who is in\nfault: but, my dear lady, do you condescend. It looks pretty in a woman\nto condescend. Forgive me; I will run to my lord, and I will beg of\nhim----\n\nAway she ran, without waiting for an answer--and, bringing in the\npassionate wretch, hanging on his arm--You must not, my lord, indeed you\nmust not be so passionate. Why, my lord, you frighted me; indeed you\ndid. Such a word I never heard from your lordship's mouth--\n\nAy, my lord, said I, you give yourself pretty airs! Don't you? and use\npretty words; that a child shall be terrified at them! But come, come,\nask my pardon, for leaving me to dine without you.\n\nWas not that tender?--Yet out went Lord and Lady L----. To be sure they\ndid right, if they withdrew in hopes these kind words would have been\nreceived as reconciliatory ones; and not in displeasure with me, as I am\nhalf-afraid they did: for their good-nature (worthy souls!) does\nsometimes lead them into misapprehensions. I kindly laid my hand on his\narm again.--He was ungracious.--Nay, my lord, don't once more reject me\nwith disdain--If you do--I then smiled most courteously. Carry not your\nabsurdities, my lord, too far: and I took his hand:--[There, Harriet, was\ncondescension!]--I protest, sir, if you give yourself any more of these\nairs, you will not find me so condescending. Come, come, tell me you are\nsorry, and I will forgive you.\n\nSorry! madam; sorry!--I am indeed sorry, for your provoking airs!\n\nWhy that's not ill said--But kimboed arms, my lord! are you not sorry for\nsuch an air? And Oons! are you not sorry for such a word? and for such\nlooks too? and for quarreling with your dinner?--I protest, my lord, you\nmake one of us look like a child who flings away his bread and butter\nbecause it has not glass windows upon it--\n\nNot for one moment forbear, madam!--\n\nPr'ythee, pr'ythee--[I profess I had like to have said honest friend]--No\nmore of these airs; and, I tell you, I will forgive you.\n\nBut, madam, I cannot, I will not--\n\nHush, hush; no more in that strain, and so loud, as if we had lost each\nother in a wood--If you will let us be friends, say so--In an instant--If\nnot, I am gone--gone this moment--casting off from him, as I may say,\nintending to mount up stairs.\n\nAngel, or demon, shall I call you? said he.--Yet I receive your hand, as\noffered. But, for God's sake, madam, let us be happy! And he kissed my\nhand, but not so cordially as it became him to do; and in came Lord and\nLady L---- with countenances a little ungracious.\n\nI took my seat next my own man, with an air of officiousness, hoping to\noblige him by it; and he was obliged: and another day, not yet quite\nagreed upon, this parade is to be made.\n\nAnd thus began, proceeded, and ended, this doughty quarrel. And who\nknows, but before the day is absolutely resolved upon, we may have half a\nscore more? Four, five, six days, as it may happen, is a great space of\ntime for people to agree, who are so much together; and one of whom is\nplayful, and the other will not be played with. But these kimbo and oons\nairs, Harriet, stick a little in my stomach; and the man seems not to be\nquite come to neither. He is sullen and gloomy, and don't prate away as\nhe used to do, when we have made up before.\n\nBut I will sing him a song to-morrow: I will please the honest man, if I\ncan. But he really should not have had for a wife a woman of so sweet a\ntemper as your\n\nCHARLOTTE G----.\n\n\n\nLETTER XLII\n\nLADY G----, TO MISS BYRON\nMONDAY, MAY 8.\n\n\nMy lord and I have had another little--Tiff, shall I call it? It came\nnot up to a quarrel. Married people would have enough to do, if they\nwere to trouble their friends every time they misunderstood one another.\nAnd now a word or two of other people: not always scribbling of\nourselves.\n\nWe have just heard, that our cousin Everard has added another fool of our\nsex to the number of the weak ones who disgrace it: A sorry fellow! He\nhas been seen with her, by one whom he would not know, at Cuper's\nGardens; dressed like a sea-officer, and skulking like a thief into the\nprivatest walks of the place. When he is tired of the poor wretch, he\nwill want to accommodate with us by promises of penitence and\nreformation, as once or twice before. Rakes are not only odious, but\nthey are despicable fellows. You will the more clearly see this, when I\nassure you, from those who know, that this silly creature our cousin is\nlooked upon, among his brother libertines, and smarts, as a man of first\nconsideration!\n\nHe has also been seen, in a gayer habit, at a certain gaming-table, near\nCovent Garden; where he did not content himself with being an idle\nspectator. Colonel Winwood, our informant, shook his head, but made no\nother answer, to some of our inquiries. May he suffer! say I.--A sorry\nfellow!\n\nPreparations are going on all so-fast at Windsor. We are all invited.\nGod grant that Miss Mansfield may be as happy a Lady W----, as we all\nconclude she will be! But I never was fond of matches between sober\nyoung women, and battered old rakes. Much good may do the adventurers,\ndrawn in by gewgaw and title!--Poor things!--But convenience, when that's\nthe motive, whatever foolish girls think, will hold out its comforts,\nwhile a gratified love quickly evaporates.\n\nBeauchamp, who is acquainted with the Mansfields, is intrusted by my\nbrother, in his absence, with the management of the law-affairs. He\nhopes, he says, to give a good account of them. The base steward of the\nuncle Calvert, who lived as a husband with the woman who had been forced\nupon his superannuated master in a doting fit, has been brought, by the\ndeath of one of the children born in Mr. Calvert's life-time, and by the\nprecarious health of the posthumous one, to make overtures of\naccommodation. A new hearing of the cause between them and the Keelings,\nis granted; and great things are expected from it in their favour, from\nsome new lights thrown in upon that suit. The Keelings are frightened\nout of their wits, it seems; and are applying to Sir John Lambton, a\ndisinterested neighbour, to offer himself as a mediator between them.\nThe Mansfields will so soon be related to us, that I make no apology for\ninteresting you in their affairs.\n\nBe sure you chide me for my whimsical behaviour to Lord G----. I know\nyou will. But don't blame my heart: my head only is wrong.\n\n\n***\n\n\nA little more from fresh informations of this sorry varlet Everard. I\nwished him to suffer; but I wished him not to be so very great a sufferer\nas it seems he is. Sharpers have bit his head off, quite close to his\nshoulders: they have not left it him to carry under his arm, as the\nhonest patron of France did his. They lend it him, however, now and\nthen, to repent with, and curse himself. The creature he attended to\nCuper's Gardens, instead of a country innocent, as he expected her to be,\ncomes out to be a cast mistress, experienced in all the arts of such, and\nacting under the secret influences of a man of quality; who, wanting to\nget rid of her, supports her in a prosecution commenced against him (poor\ndevil!) for performance of covenants. He was extremely mortified, on\nfinding my brother gone abroad: he intends to apply to him for his pity\nand help. Sorry fellow! He boasted to us, on our expectation of our\nbrother's arrival from abroad, that he would enter his cousin Charles\ninto the ways of the town. Now he wants to avail himself against the\npractices of the sons of that town by his cousin's character and\nconsequence.\n\nA combination of sharpers, it seems, had long set him as a man of\nfortune: but, on his taking refuge with my brother, gave over for a\ntime their designs upon him, till he threw himself again in their way.\n\nThe worthless fellow had been often liberal of his promises of marriage\nto young creatures of more innocence than this; and thinks it very hard\nthat he should be prosecuted for a crime which he had so frequently\ncommitted with impunity. Can you pity him? I cannot, I assure you. The\nman who can betray and ruin an innocent woman, who loves him, ought to be\nabhorred by men. Would he scruple to betray and ruin them, if he were\nnot afraid of the law?--Yet there are women, who can forgive such\nwretches, and herd with them.\n\nMy aunt Eleanor is arrived: a good, plump, bonny-faced old virgin. She\nhas chosen her apartment. At present we are most prodigiously civil to\neach other: but already I suspect she likes Lord G---- better than I\nwould have her. She will perhaps, if a party should be formed against\nyour poor Charlotte, make one of it.\n\nWill you think it time thrown away, to read a further account of what is\ncome to hand about the wretches who lately, in the double sense of the\nword, were overtaken between St. Denis and Paris?\n\nSir Hargrave Pollexfen, it seems, still keeps his chamber: he is thought\nnot to be out of danger from some inward hurt, which often makes him\nbring up blood in quantities. He is miserably oppressed by lowness of\nspirits; and when he is a little better in that respect, his impatience\nmakes his friends apprehensive for his head. But has he intellects\nstrong enough to give apprehensions of that nature? Fool and madman we\noften join as terms of reproach; but I believe, fools seldom run really\nmad.\n\nMerceda is in a still more dangerous way. Besides his bruises, and a\nfractured skull, he has, it seems, a wound in his thigh, which, in the\ndelirium he was thrown into by the fracture, was not duly attended to;\nand which, but for his valiant struggles against the knife which gave the\nwound, was designed for a still greater mischief. His recovery is\ndespaired of; and the poor wretch is continually offering up vows of\npenitence and reformation, if his life may be spared.\n\nBagenhall was the person who had seduced, by promises of marriage, and\nfled for it, the manufacturer's daughter of Abbeville. He was overtaken\nby his pursuers at Douay. The incensed father, and friends of the young\nwoman, would not be otherwise pacified than by his performing his\npromise; which, with infinite reluctance, he complied with, principally\nthrough the threats of the brother, who is noted for his fierceness and\nresolution; and who once made the sorry creature feel an argument which\ngreatly terrified him. Bagenhall is at present at Abbeville, living as\nwell as he can with his new wife, cursing his fate, no doubt, in secret.\nHe is obliged to appear fond of her before her brother and father; the\nlatter being also a sour man, a Gascon, always boasting of his family,\nand valuing himself upon a De, affixed by himself to his name, and\njealous of indignity offered to it. The fierce brother is resolved to\naccompany his sister to England, when Bagenhall goes thither, in order,\nas he declares, to secure to her good usage, and see her owned and\nvisited by all Bagenhall's friends and relations. And thus much of these\nfine gentlemen.\n\nHow different a man is Beauchamp! But it is injuring him, to think of\nthose wretches and him at the same time. He certainly has an eye to\nEmily, but behaves with great prudence towards her: yet every body but\nshe sees his regard for her: nobody but her guardian runs in her head;\nand the more, as she really thinks it is a glory to love him, because of\nhis goodness. Every body, she says, has the same admiration of him, that\nshe has.\n\nMrs. Reeves desires me to acquaint you, that Miss Clements, having, by\nthe death of her mother and aunt, come into a pretty fortune, is\naddressed to by a Yorkshire gentleman of easy circumstances, and is\npreparing to leave the town, having other connexions in that county; but\nthat she intends to write to you before she goes, and to beg you to\nfavour her with now and then a letter.\n\nI think Miss Clements is a good sort of young woman: but I imagined she\nwould have been one of those nuns at large, who need not make vows of\nliving and dying aunt Eleanors, or Lady Gertrudes; all three of them good\nhonest souls! chaste, pious, and plain. It is a charming situation, when\na woman is arrived at such a height of perfection, as to be above giving\nor receiving temptation. Sweet innocents! They have my reverence, if\nnot my love. How would they be affronted, if I were to say pity!--I\nthink only of my two good aunts, at the present writing. Miss Clements,\nyou know, is a youngish woman; and I respect her much. One would not\njest upon the unsightliness of person, or plainness of feature: but think\nyou she will not be one of those, who twenty years hence may put in a\nboast of her quondam beauty?\n\nHow I run on! I think I ought to be ashamed of myself.\n\n'Very true, Charlotte.'\n\nAnd so it is, Harriet. I have done--Adieu!--Lord G---- will be silly\nagain, I doubt; but I am prepared. I wish he had half my patience.\n\n'Be quiet, Lord G----! What a fool you are!'--The man, my dear, under\npretence of being friends, run his sharp nose in my eye. No bearing his\nfondness: It is worse than insolence. How my eye waters!--I can tell\nhim--But I will tell him, and not you.--Adieu, once more.\n\nCHARLOTTE G----\n\n\n\nLETTER XLIII\n\nMR. LOWTHER, TO JOHN ARNOLD, ESQ.\n(HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW) IN LONDON.\nBOLOGNA, MAY 5-16.\n\n\nI will now, my dear brother, give you a circumstantial account of our\nshort, but flying journey. The 20th of April, O.S. early in the morning,\nwe left Paris, and reached Lyons the 24th, at night.\n\nResting but a few hours, we set out for Pont Beauvoisin, where we arrived\nthe following evening: There we bid adieu to France, and found ourselves\nin Savoy, equally noted for its poverty and rocky mountains. Indeed it\nwas a total change of the scene. We had left behind us a blooming\nspring, which enlivened with its verdure the trees and hedges on the road\nwe passed, and the meadows already smiled with flowers. The cheerful\ninhabitants were busy in adjusting their limits, lopping their trees,\npruning their vines, tilling their fields: but when we entered Savoy,\nnature wore a very different face; and I must own, that my spirits were\ngreat sufferers by the change. Here we began to view on the nearer\nmountains, covered with ice and snow, notwithstanding the advanced\nseason, the rigid winter, in frozen majesty, still preserving its\ndomains: and arriving at St. Jean Maurienne the night of the 26th, the\nsnow seemed as if it would dispute with us our passage; and horrible was\nthe force of the boisterous winds, which sat full in our faces.\n\nOverpowered by the fatigues I had undergone in the expedition we had\nmade, the unseasonable coldness of the weather, and the fight of one of\nthe worst countries under heaven, still clothed in snow, and deformed by\ncontinual hurricanes; I was here taken ill. Sir Charles was greatly\nconcerned for my indisposition, which was increased by a great lowness of\nspirits. He attended upon me in person; and never had man a more kind\nand indulgent friend. Here we stayed two days; and then, my illness\nbeing principally owing to fatigue, I found myself enabled to proceed.\nAt two of the clock in the morning of the 28th, we prosecuted our\njourney, in palpable darkness, and dismal weather, though the winds were\nsomewhat laid, and reaching the foot of Mount Cenis by break of day,\narrived at Lanebourg, a poor little village, so environed by high\nmountains, that for three months in the twelve, it is hardly visited by\nthe cheering rays of the sun. Every object which here presents itself is\nexcessively miserable. The people are generally of an olive complexion,\nwith wens under their chins; some so monstrous, especially women, as\nquite disfigure them.\n\nHere it is usual to unscrew and take in pieces the chaises, in order to\ncarry them on mules over the mountain: and to put them together on the\nother side: For the Savoy side of the mountain is much more difficult to\npass than the other. But Sir Charles chose not to lose time; and\ntherefore lest the chaise to the care of the inn-keeper; proceeding, with\nall expedition, to gain the top of the hill.\n\nThe way we were carried, was as follows:--A kind of horse, as it is\ncalled with you, with two poles, like those of chairmen, was the vehicle;\non which is secured a sort of elbow chair, in which the traveller sits.\nA man before, another behind, carry this open machine with so much\nswiftness, that they are continually running and skipping, like wild\ngoats, from rock to rock, the four miles of that ascent. If a traveller\nwere not prepossessed that these mountaineers are the surest-footed\ncarriers in the universe, he would be in continual apprehensions of being\noverturned. I, who never undertook this journey before, must own, that I\ncould not be so fearless, on this occasion as Sir Charles was, though he\nhad very exactly described to me how every thing would be. Then, though\nthe sky was clear when we passed this mountain, yet the cold wind blew\nquantities of frozen snow in our faces; insomuch that it seemed to me\njust as if people were employed, all the time we were passing, to wound\nus with the sharpest needles. They indeed call the wind that brings this\nsharp-pointed snow, The Tormenta.\n\nAn adventure, which any-where else might have appeared ridiculous, I was\nafraid would have proved fatal to one of our chairmen, as I will call\nthem. I had flapt down my hat to screen my eyes from the fury of that\ndeluge of sharp-pointed frozen-snow; and it was blown off my head, by a\nsudden gust, down the precipices: I gave it for lost, and was about to\nbind a handkerchief over the woolen-cap, which those people provide to\ntie under the chin; when one of the assistant carriers (for they are\nalways six in number to every chair, in order to relieve one another)\nundertook to recover it. I thought it impossible to be done; the passage\nbeing, as I imagined, only practicable for birds: however, I promised him\na crown reward, if he did. Never could the leaps of the most dexterous\nof rope-dancers be compared to those of this daring fellow: I saw him\nsometimes jumping from rock to rock, sometimes rolling down a declivity\nof snow like a ninepin, sometimes running, sometimes hopping, skipping;\nin short, he descended like lightning to the verge of a torrent, where he\nfound the hat. He came up almost as quick, and appeared as little\nfatigued, as if he had never left us.\n\nWe arrived at the top in two hours, from Lanebourg; and the sun was\npretty high above the horizon. Out of a hut, half-buried in snow, came\nsome mountaineers, with two poor sledges, drawn by mules, to carry us\nthrough the Plain of Mount Cenis, as it is called, which is about four\nItalian miles in length, to the descent of the Italian side of the\nmountain. These sledges are not much different from the chairs, or\nsedans, or horse, we then quitted; only the two under poles are flat, and\nnot so long as the others, and turning up a little at the end, to hinder\nthem from sticking fast in the snow. To the fore-ends of the poles are\nfixed two round sticks, about two feet and a half long, which serve for a\nsupport and help to the man who guides the mule, who, running on the snow\nbetween the mule and the sledge, holds the sticks with each hand.\n\nIt was diverting to see the two sledgemen striving to outrun each other.\n\nEncouraged by Sir Charles's generosity, we very soon arrived at the other\nend of the plain. The man who walked, or rather ran, between the sledge\nand the mule, made a continual noise; hallooing and beating the stubborn\nbeast with his fists, which otherwise would be very slow in its motion.\n\nAt the end of this plain we found such another hut as that on the\nLanebourg side. Here they took off the smoking mules from the sledges,\nto give them rest.\n\nAnd now began the most extraordinary way of travelling that can be\nimagined. The descent of the mountain from the top of this side, to a\nsmall village called Novalesa, is four Italian miles. When the snow has\nfilled up all the inequalities of the mountain, it looks, in many parts,\nas smooth and equal as a sugar-loaf. It is on the brink of this rapid\ndescent that they put the sledge. The man who is to guide it, sits\nbetween the feet of the traveller, who is seated in the elbow-chair, with\nhis legs at the outside of the sticks fixed at the fore-ends of the flat\npoles, and holds the two sticks with his hands; and when the sledge has\ngained the declivity, its own weight carries it down with surprising\ncelerity. But as the immense irregular rocks under the snow make now\nand then some edges in the declivity, which, if not avoided, would\noverturn the sledge; the guide, who foresees the danger, by putting his\nfoot strongly and dexterously in the snow next to the precipice, turns\nthe machine, by help of the above-mentioned sticks, the contrary way,\nand by way of zig-zag goes to the bottom. Such was the velocity of this\nmotion, that we dispatched these four miles in less than five minutes;\nand, when we arrived at Novalesa, hearing that the snow was very deep\nmost of the way to Susa, and being pleased with our way of travelling, we\nhad some mules put again to the sledges, and ran all the way to the very\ngates of that city, which is seven miles distant from Mount Cenis.\n\nIn our way we had a cursory view of the impregnable fortress of Brunetta,\nthe greatest part of which is cut out of the solid rock, and commands\nthat important pass.\n\nWe rested all night at Susa; and, having bought a very commodious\npost-chaise, we proceeded to Turin, where we dined; and from thence, the\nevening of May 2, O.S. got to Parma by way of Alexandria and Placentia,\nhaving purposely avoided the high road through Milan, as it would have\ncost us a few hours more time.\n\nSir Charles observed to me, when we were on the plain or flat top of\nMount Cenis, that had not the winter been particularly long and severe,\nwe should have had, instead of this terrible appearance of snow there,\nflowers starting up, as it were, under our feet, of various kinds, which\nare hardly to be met with anywhere else. One of the greatest dangers, he\ntold me, in passing this mount in winter, arises from a ball of snow,\nwhich is blown down from the top by the wind, or falls down by some other\naccident; which, gathering all the way in its descent, becomes instantly\nof such a prodigious bigness, that there is hardly any avoiding being\ncarried away with it, man and beast, and smothered in it. One of these\nballs we saw rolling down; but as it took another course than ours, we\nhad no apprehension of danger from it.\n\nAt Parma we found expecting us, the bishop of Nocera, and a very reverend\nfather, Marescotti by name; who expressed the utmost joy at the arrival\nof Sir Charles Grandison, and received me, at his recommendation, with a\npoliteness which seems natural to them. I will not repeat what I have\nwritten before of this excellent young gentleman; intrepidity, bravery,\ndiscretion, as well as generosity, are conspicuous parts of his\ncharacter. He is studious to avoid danger; but is unappalled in it. For\nhumanity, benevolence, providence for others, to his very servants, I\nnever met with his equal.\n\nMy reception from the noble family to which he has introduced me; the\npatient's case, (a very unhappy one!); and a description of this noble\ncity, and the fine country about it; shall be the subject of my next.\nAssure all my friends of my health, and good wishes for them; and, my\ndear Arnold, believe me to be\n\nEver yours, &c.\n\n\n\nLETTER XLIV\n\nSIR CHARLES GRANDISON, TO DR. BARTLETT\nBOLOGNA, WEDNESDAY, MAY 10-21.\n\n\nI told you, my dear and reverend friend, that I should hardly write to\nyou till I arrived in this city.\n\nThe affair of my executorship obliged me to stay a day longer at Paris\nthan I intended; but I have put every thing relating to that trust in\nsuch a way, as to answer all my wishes.\n\nMr. Lowther wrote to Mr. Arnold, a friend of his in London, the\nparticulars of the extraordinary affair we were engaged in between St.\nDenis and Paris; with desire that he would inform my friends of our\narrival at that capital.\n\nWe were obliged to stop two days at St. Jean de Maurienne. The\nexpedition we travelled with was too much for Mr. Lowther; and I\nexpected, and was not disappointed, from the unusual backwardness of the\nseason, to find the passage over Mount Cenis less agreeable than it\nusually is in the beginning of May.\n\nThe bishop of Nocera had offered to meet me any where on his side of the\nmountains. I wrote to him from Lyons, that I hoped to see him at Parma,\non or about the very day that I was so fortunate as to reach the palace\nof the Count of Belvedere in that city; where I found, that he and Father\nMarescotti had arrived the evening before. They, as well as the count,\nexpressed great joy to see me; and when I presented Mr. Lowther to them,\nwith the praises due to his skill, and let them know the consultations I\nhad had with eminent physicians of my own country on Lady Clementina's\ncase, they invoked blessings upon us both, and would not be interrupted\nin them by my eager questions after the health and state of mind of the\ntwo dearest persons of their family.--Unhappy! very unhappy! said the\nbishop. Let us give you some refreshment, before we come to particulars.\n\nTo my repeated inquiries, Jeronymo, poor Jeronymo! said the bishop, is\nliving, and that is all we can say.--The sight of you will be a cordial\nto his heart. Clementina is on her journey to Bologna from Naples. You\ndesired to find her with us, and not at Naples. She is weak; is obliged\nto travel slowly. She will rest at Urbino two or three days. Dear\ncreature! What has she not suffered from the cruelty of her cousin\nLaurana, as well as from her malady! The general has been, and is,\nindulgent to her. He is married to a lady of great merit, quality, and\nfortune. He has, at length, consented that we shall try this last\nexperiment, as the hearts of my mother and now lately of my father, as\nwell as mine, are in it. His lady would not be denied accompanying my\nsister; and as my brother could not bear being absent from her, he\ntravels with them. I wish he had stayed at Naples. I hope, however, he\nwill be as ready, as you will find us all, to acknowledge the favour of\nthis visit, and the fatigue and trouble you have given yourself on our\naccount.\n\nAs to my sister's bodily health, proceeded he, it is greatly impaired.\nWe are almost hopeless, with regard to the state of her mind. She speaks\nnot; she answers not any questions. Camilla is with her. She seems\nregardless of any body else. She has been told, that the general is\nmarried. His lady makes great court to her; but she heeds her not. We\nare in hopes, that my mother, on her return to Bologna, will engage her\nattention. She never yet was so bad as to forget her duty, either to\nGod, or her parents. Sometimes Camilla thinks she pays some little\nattention to your name; but then she instantly starts, as in terror;\nlooks round her with fear; puts her finger to her lips, as if she dreaded\nher cruel cousin Laurana should be told of her having heard it mentioned.\n\nThe bishop and father both regretted that she had been denied the\nrequested interview. They were now, they said, convinced, that if that\nhad been granted, and she had been left to Mrs. Beaumont's friendly care,\na happy issue might have been hoped for: But now, said the bishop--Then\nsighed, and was silent.\n\nI despatched Saunders, early the next morning, to Bologna, to procure\nconvenient lodgings for me, and Mr. Lowther.\n\nIn the afternoon we set out for that city. The Count of Belvedere found\nan opportunity to let me know his unabated passion for Clementina, and\nthat he had lately made overtures to marry her, notwithstanding her\nmalady; having been advised, he said, by proper persons, that as it was\nnot an hereditary, but an accidental disorder, it might be, in time,\ncurable. He accompanied us about half way in our journey; and, at\nparting, Remember, chevalier, whispered he, that Clementina is the soul\nof my hope: I cannot forego that hope. No other woman will I ever call\nmine.\n\nI heard him in silence: I admired him for his attachment: I pitied him.\nHe said, he would tell me more of his mind at Bologna.\n\nWe reached Bologna on the 15th, N.S. Saunders had engaged for me the\nlodgings I had before.\n\nOur conversation on the road turned chiefly on the case of Signor\nJeronymo. The bishop and father were highly pleased with the skill,\nfounded on practice, which evidently appeared in all that Mr. Lowther\nsaid on the subject: and the bishop once intimated, that, be the event\nwhat it would, his journey to Italy should be made the most beneficial\naffair to him he had ever engaged in. Mr. Lowther replied, that as he\nwas neither a necessitous nor a mean-spirited man, and had reason to be\nentirely satisfied with the terms I had already secured to him; he should\ntake it unkindly, if any other reward were offered him.\n\nThink, my dear Dr. Bartlett, what emotions I must have on entering, once\nmore, the gates of the Porretta palace, though Clementina was not there.\n\nI hastened up to my Jeronymo, who had been apprized of my arrival. The\nmoment he saw me, Do I once more, said he, behold my friend, my\nGrandison? Let me embrace the dearest of men. Now, now, have I lived\nlong enough. He bowed his head upon his pillow, and meditated me; his\ncountenance shining with pleasure in defiance of pain.\n\nThe bishop entered: he could not be present at our first interview.\n\nMy lord, said Jeronymo, make it your care that my dear friend be treated,\nby every soul of our family, with the gratitude and respect which are due\nto his goodness. Methinks I am easier and happier, this moment, than I\nhave been for the tedious space of time since I last saw him. He named\nthat space of time to the day, and to the very hour of the day.\n\nThe marquis and marchioness signifying their pleasure to see me, the\nbishop led me to them. My reception from the marquis was kind; from his\nlady it was as that of a mother to a long-absent son. I had ever been,\nshe was pleased to say, a fourth son in her eye; and now, that she had\nbeen informed that I had brought over with me a surgeon of experience,\nand the advice in writing of eminent physicians of my country, the\nobligations I had laid on their whole family, whatever were the success,\nwere unreturnable.\n\nI asked leave to introduce Mr. Lowther to them. They received him with\ngreat politeness, and recommended their Jeronymo to his best skill. Mr.\nLowther's honest heart was engaged, by a reception so kind. He never, he\ntold me afterwards, beheld so much pleasure and pain struggling in the\nsame countenance, as in that of the lady; so fixed a melancholy, as in\nthat of the marquis.\n\nMr. Lowther is a man of spirit, though a modest man. He is, as on every\nproper occasion I found, a man of piety; and has a heart tender as manly.\nSuch a man, heart and hand, is qualified for a profession which is the\nmost useful and certain in the art of healing. He is a man of sense and\nlearning out of his profession, and happy in his address.\n\nThe two surgeons who now attend Signor Jeronymo, are both of this\ncountry. They were sent for. With the approbation, and at the request,\nof the family, I presented Mr. Lowther to them; but first gave them his\ncharacter, as a modest man, as a man of skill, and experience; and told\nthem, that he had quitted business, and wanted not either fame or\nfortune.\n\nThey acquainted him with the case, and their methods of proceeding. Mr.\nLowther assisted in the dressings that very evening. Jeronymo would have\nme to be present. Mr. Lowther suggested an alteration in their method,\nbut in so easy and gentle a manner, as if he doubted not, but such was\ntheir intention when the state of the wounds would admit of that method\nof treatment, that the gentlemen came readily into it. A great deal of\nmatter had been collected, by means of the wrong methods pursued; and he\nproposed, if the patient's strength would bear it, to make an aperture\nbelow the principal wound, in order to discharge the matter downward; and\nhe suggested the dressing with hollow tents and bandage, and to dismiss\nthe large tents, with which they had been accustomed to distend the\nwound, to the extreme anguish of the patient, on pretence of keeping it\nopen, to assist the discharge.\n\nLet me now give you, my dear friend, a brief history of my Jeronymo's\ncase, and of the circumstances which have attended it; by which you will\nbe able to account for the difficulties of it, and how it has happened,\nthat, in such a space of time, either the cure was not effected, or that\nthe patient yielded not to the common destiny.\n\nIn lingering cases, patients or their friends are sometimes too apt to\nblame their physicians, and to listen to new recommendations. The\nsurgeons attending this unhappy case, had been more than once changed.\nSignor Jeronymo, it seems, was unskilfully treated by the young surgeon\nof Cremona, who was first engaged: he neglected the most dangerous wound;\nand, when he attended to it, managed it wrong, for want of experience.\nHe is, therefore, very properly dismissed.\n\nThe unhappy man had at first three wounds: one in his breast, which had\nbeen for some time healed; one in his shoulder, which, through his own\nimpatience, having been too suddenly healed up, was obliged to be laid\nopen again: the other, which is the most dangerous, in the hip-joint.\n\nA surgeon of this place, and another of Padua, were next employed. The\ncure not advancing, a surgeon of eminence, from Paris, was sent for.\n\nMr. Lowther tells me, that this man's method was by far the most\neligible; but that he undertook too much; since, from the first, there\ncould not be any hope, from the nature of the wound in the hip-joint,\nthat the patient could ever walk, without sticks or crutches: and of this\nopinion were the other two surgeons: but the French gentleman was so very\npragmatical, that he would neither draw with them, nor give reasons for\nwhat he did; regarding them only as his assistants. They could not long\nbear this usage, and gave up to him in disgust.\n\nHow cruel is punctilio, among men of this science, in cases of difficulty\nand danger!\n\nThe present operators, when the two others had given up, were not, but by\nleave of the French gentleman, called in. He valuing himself on his\npractice in the Royal Hospital of Invalids at Paris, looked upon them as\ntheorists only; and treated them with as little ceremony as he had shewn\nthe others: so that at last, from their frequent differences, it became\nnecessary to part with either him, or them. His pride, when he knew that\nthis question was a subject of debate, would not allow him to leave the\nfamily an option. He made his demand: it was complied with; and he\nreturned to Paris.\n\nFrom what this gentleman threw out at parting, to the disparagement of\nthe two others, Signor Jeronymo suspected their skill; and from a hint of\nthis suspicion, as soon as I knew I should be welcome myself, I procured\nthe favour of Mr. Lowther's attendance.\n\nAll Mr. Lowther's fear is, that Signor Jeronymo has been kept too long in\nhand by the different managements of the several operators; and that he\nwill sink under the necessary process, through weakness of habit. But,\nhowever, he is of opinion, that it is requisite to confine him to a\nstrict diet, and to deny him wine and fermented liquors, in which he has\nhitherto been indulged, against the opinion of his own operators, who\nhave been too complaisant to his appetite.\n\nAn operation somewhat severe was performed on his shoulder yesterday\nmorning. The Italian surgeons complimented Mr. Lowther with the lancet.\nThey both praised his dexterity; and Signor Jeronymo, who will be\nconsulted on every thing that he is to suffer, blessed his gentle hand.\n\nAt Mr. Lowther's request, a physician was yesterday consulted; who\nadvised some gentle aperitives, as his strength will bear it; and some\nbalsamics, to sweeten the blood and juices.\n\nMr. Lowther told me just now, that the fault of the gentlemen who have\nnow the care of him, has not been want of skill, but of critical courage,\nand a too great solicitude to oblige their patient; which, by their own\naccount, had made them forego several opportunities which had offered to\nassist nature. In short, sir, said he, your friend knows too much of his\nown case to be ruled, and too little to qualify him to direct what is to\nbe done, especially as symptoms must have been frequently changing.\n\nMr. Lowther doubts not, he says, but he shall soon convince Jeronymo that\nhe merits his confidence, and then he will exact it from him; and, in so\ndoing, shall not only give weight to his own endeavours to serve him, but\nrid the other two gentlemen of embarrasments which have often given them\ndiffidences, when resolution was necessary.\n\nIn the mean time the family here are delighted with Mr. Lowther. They\nwill flatter themselves, they say, with hopes of their Jeronymo's\nrecovery; which, however, Mr. Lowther, for fear of disappointment, does\nnot encourage. Jeronymo himself owns, that his spirits are much revived;\nand we all know the power that the mind has over the body.\n\nThus have I given you, my reverend friend, a general notion of Jeronymo's\ncase, as I understand it from Mr. Lowther's as general representation of\nit.\n\nHe has prevailed upon him to accept of an apartment adjoining to that of\nhis patient. Jeronymo said, that when he knows he has so skilful a\nfriend near him, he shall go to rest with confidence; and good rest is of\nthe highest consequence to him. What a happiness, my dear Dr. Bartlett,\nwill fall to my share, if I may be an humble instrument, in the hand of\nProvidence, to heal this brother; and if his recovery shall lead the way\nto the restoration of his sister; each so known a lover of the other,\nthat the world is more ready to attribute her malady to his misfortune\nand danger, than to any other cause! But how early days are these, on\nwhich my love and my compassion for persons so meritorious, embolden me\nto build such forward hopes!\n\nLady Clementina is now impatiently expected by every one. She is at\nUrbino. The general and his lady are with her. His haughty spirit\ncannot bear to think she should see me, or that my attendance on her\nshould be thought of so much importance to her.\n\nThe marchioness, in a conversation that I have just now had with her,\nhinted this to me, and besought me to keep my temper, if his high notion\nof family and female honour should carry him out of his usual politeness.\n\nI will give you, my dear friend, the particulars of this conversation.\n\nShe began with saying, that she did not, for her part, now think, that\nher beloved daughter, whom once she believed hardly any private man could\ndeserve, was worthy of me, even were she to recover her reason.\n\nI could not but guess the meaning of so high a compliment. What answer\ncould I return that would not, on one hand, be capable of being thought\ncool; on the other, of being supposed interested; and as if I were\nlooking forward to a reward that some of the family still think too high?\nBut, while I knew my own motives, I could not be displeased with a lady\nwho was not at liberty to act, in this point, according to her own will.\n\nI only said, (and it was with truth,) That the calamity of the noble lady\nhad endeared her to me, more than it was possible the most prosperous\nfortune could have done.\n\nI, my good chevalier, may say any thing to you. We are undetermined\nabout every thing. We know not what to propose, what to consent to.\nYour journey, on the first motion, though but from some of us, the dear\ncreature continuing ill; you in possession of a considerable estate,\nexercising yourself in doing good in your native country; [You must think\nwe took all opportunities of inquiring after the man once so likely to be\none of us;] the first fortune in Italy, Olivia, though she is not a\nClementina, pursuing you in hopes of calling herself yours; (for to\nEngland we hear she went, and there you own she is;) What obligations\nhave you laid upon us!--What can we determine upon? What can we wish?\n\nProvidence and you, madam, shall direct my steps. I am in yours and your\nlord's power. The same uncertainty, from the same unhappy cause, leaves\nme not the thought, because not the power, of determination. The\nrecovery of Lady Clementina and her brother, without a view to my own\ninterest, fills up, at present, all the wishes of my heart.\n\nLet me ask, said the lady, (it is for my own private satisfaction,) Were\nsuch a happy event, as to Clementina, to take place, could you, would\nyou, think yourself bound by your former offers?\n\nWhen I made those offers, madam, the situation on your side was the same\nthat it is now: Lady Clementina was unhappy in her mind. My fortune, it\nis true, is higher: it is, indeed, as high as I wish it to be. I then\ndeclared, that if you would give me your Clementina, without insisting on\none hard, on one indispensable article, I would renounce her fortune, and\ntrust to my father's goodness to me for a provision. Shall my accession\nto the estate of my ancestors alter me?--No, madam: I never yet made an\noffer, that I receded from, the circumstances continuing the same. If,\nin the article of residence, the marquis, and you, and Clementina, would\nrelax; I would acknowledge myself indebted to your goodness; but without\nconditioning for it.\n\nI told you, said she, that I put this question only for my own private\nsatisfaction: and I told you truth. I never will deceive or mislead you.\nWhenever I speak to you, it shall be as if, even in your own concerns, I\nspoke to a third person; and I shall not doubt but you will have the\ngenerosity to advise, as such, though against yourself.\n\nMay I be enabled to act worthy of your good opinion! I, madam, look upon\nmyself as bound; you and yours are free.\n\nWhat a pleasure is it, my dear Dr. Bartlett, to the proud heart of your\nfriend, that I could say this!--Had I sought, in pursuance of my own\ninclinations, to engage the affections of the admirable Miss Byron, as I\nmight with honour have endeavoured to do, had not the woes of this noble\nfamily, and the unhappy state of mind of their Clementina, so deeply\naffected me; I might have involved myself, and that loveliest of women,\nin difficulties which would have made such a heart as mine still more\nunhappy than it is.\n\nLet me know, my dear Dr. Bartlett, that Miss Byron is happy. I rejoice,\nwhatever be my own destiny, that I have not involved her in my\nuncertainties. The Countess of D---- is a worthy woman: the earl, her\nson, is a good young man: Miss Byron merits such a mother; the countess\nsuch a daughter. How dear, how important, is her welfare to me!--You\nknow your Grandison, my good Dr. Bartlett. Her friendship I presumed to\nask: I dared not to wish to correspond with her. I rejoice, for her\nsake, that I trusted not my heart with such a proposal. What\ndifficulties, my dear friend, have I had to encounter with!--God be\npraised, that I have nothing, with regard to these two incomparable\nwomen, to reproach myself with. I am persuaded that our prudence, if\nrashly we throw not ourselves into difficulties, and if we will exert it,\nand make a reliance on the proper assistance, is generally proportioned\nto our trials.\n\nI asked the marchioness after Lady Sforza, and her daughter Laurana; and\nwhether they were at Milan?\n\nYou have heard, no doubt, answered she, the cruel treatment that my poor\nchild met with from her cousin Laurana. Lady Sforza justifies her in it.\nWe are upon extreme bad terms, on that account. They are both at Milan.\nThe general has vowed, that he never will see them more, if he can avoid\nit. The bishop, only as a Christian, can forgive them. You, chevalier,\nknow the reason why we cannot allow our Clementina to take the veil.\n\nThe particular reasons I have not, madam, been inquisitive about; but\nhave always understood them to be family ones, grounded on the dying\nrequest of one of her grandfathers.\n\nOur daughter, sir, is entitled to a considerable estate which joins to\nour own domains. It was purchased for her by her two grandfathers; who\nvied with each other in demonstrating their love of her by solid effects.\nOne of them (my father) was, in his youth, deeply in love with a young\nlady of great merit; and she was thought to love him: but, in a fit of\npious bravery, as he used to call it, when everything between themselves,\nand between the friends on both sides, was concluded on, she threw\nherself into a convent; and, passing steadily through the probationary\nforms, took the veil; but afterwards repented, and took pains to let it\nbe known that she was unhappy. This gave him a disgust against the\nsequestered life, though he was, in other respects, a zealous Catholic.\nAnd Clementina having always a serious turn; in order to deter her from\nembracing it, (both grandfathers being desirous of strengthening their\nhouse, as well in the female as male line,) they inserted a clause in\neach of their wills, by which they gave the estate designed for her, in\ncase she took the veil, to Laurana, and her descendants; Laurana to enter\ninto possession of it on the day that Clementina should be professed.\nBut if Clementina married, Laurana was then to be entitled only to a\nhandsome legacy, that she might not be entirely disappointed: for the\nreversion, in case Clementina had no children, was to go to our eldest\nson; who, however, has been always generously solicitous to have his\nsister marry.\n\nBoth grandfathers were rich. Our son Giacomo, on my father's death, as\nhe had willed, entered upon a considerable estate in the kingdom of\nNaples, which had for ages been in my family: he is therefore, and will\nbe, greatly provided for. Our second son has great prospects before him,\nin the church: but you know he cannot marry. Poor Jeronymo! We had not,\nbefore his misfortune, any great hopes of strengthening the family by his\nmeans: he, alas! (as you well know, who took such laudable pains to\nreclaim him, before we knew you,) with great qualities, imbibed free\nnotions from bad company, and declared himself a despiser of marriage.\nThis the two grandfathers knew, and often deplored; for Jeronymo and\nClementina were equally their favourites. To him and the bishop they\nbequeathed great legacies.\n\nWe suspected not, till very lately, that Laurana was deeply in love with\nthe Count of Belvedere; and that her mother and she had views to drive\nour sweet child into a convent, that Laurana might enjoy the estate;\nwhich they hoped would be an inducement to the count to marry her. Cruel\nLaurana! Cruel Lady Sforza! So much love as they both pretended to our\nchild; and, I believe, had, till the temptation, strengthened by power,\nbecame too strong for them. Unhappy the day that we put her into their\nhands.\n\nBesides the estate so bequeathed to Clementina, we can do great things\nfor her: few Italian families are so rich as ours. Her brothers forget\ntheir own interest, when it comes into competition with hers: she is as\ngenerous as they. Our four children never knew what a contention was,\nbut who should give up an advantage to the other. This child, this sweet\nchild, was ever the delight of us all, and likewise of our brother the\nConte della Porretta. What joy would her recovery and nuptials give us!\n--Dear creature! we have sometimes thought, that she is the fonder of the\nsequestered life, as it is that which we wish her not to embrace.--But\ncan Clementina be perverse? She cannot. Yet that was the life of her\nchoice, when she had a choice, her grandfathers' wishes notwithstanding.\n\nWill you now wonder, chevalier, that neither our sons nor we can allow\nClementina to take the veil? Can we so reward Laurana for her cruelty?\nEspecially now, that we suspect the motives for her barbarity? Could I\nhave thought that my sister Sforza--But what will not love and avarice\ndo, their powers united to compass the same end; the one reigning in the\nbosom of the mother, the other in that of the daughter? Alas! alas! they\nhave, between them, broken the spirit of my Clementina. The very name of\nLaurana gives her terror--So far is she sensible. But, O sir, her\nsensibility appears only when she is harshly treated! To tenderness she\nhad been too much accustomed, to make her think an indulgent treatment\nnew, or unusual.\n\nI dread, my dear Dr. Bartlett, yet am impatient, to see the unhappy lady.\nI wish the general were not to accompany her. I am afraid I shall want\ntemper, if he forget his. My own heart, when it tells me, that I have\nnot deserved ill usage, (from my equals and superiors in rank,\nespecially,) bids me not bear it. I am ashamed to own to you, my\nreverend friend, that pride of spirit, which, knowing it to be my fault,\nI ought long ago to have subdued.\n\nMake my compliments to every one I love. Mr. and Mrs. Reeves are of the\nnumber.\n\nCharlotte, I hope, is happy. If she is not, it must be her own fault.\nLet her know, that I will not allow, when my love to both sisters is\nequal, that she shall give me cause to say that Lady L---- is my best\nsister.\n\nLady Olivia gives me uneasiness. I am ashamed, my dear Dr. Bartlett,\nthat a woman of a rank so considerable, and who has some great qualities,\nshould lay herself under obligation to the compassion of a man who can\nonly pity her. When a woman gets over that delicacy, which is the test\nor bulwark, as I may say, of modesty--Modesty itself may soon lie at the\nmercy of an enemy.\n\nTell my Emily, that she is never out of my mind; and that, among the\nother excellent examples she has before her, Miss Byron's must never be\nout of hers.\n\nLord L---- and Lord G---- are in full possession of my brotherly love.\n\nI shall not at present write to my Beauchamp. In writing to you, I write\nto him.\n\nYou know all my heart. If in this, or my future letters, any thing\nshould fall from my pen, that would possibly in your opinion affect or\ngive uneasiness to any one I love and honour, were it to be communicated;\nI depend upon your known and unquestionable discretion to keep it to\nyourself.\n\nI shall be glad you will enable yourself to inform me of the way Sir\nHargrave and his friends are in. They were very ill at Paris; and, it\nwas thought, too weak, and too much bruised, to be soon carried over to\nEngland. Men! Englishmen! thus to disgrace themselves, and their\ncountry!--I am concerned for them!\n\nI expect large packets by the next mails from my friends. England, which\nwas always dear to me, never was half so dear as now, to\n\nYour ever-affectionate\nGRANDISON.\n\n\nEND OF VOLUME 4\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HISTORY OF SIR CHARLES\nGRANDISON, VOLUME 4 (OF 7)***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 13884-8.txt or 13884-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/3\/8\/8\/13884\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":770,"split":"train"}
