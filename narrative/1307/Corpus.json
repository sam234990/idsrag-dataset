The fictional town of Plassans (loosely based on the real city of Aix-en-Provence, where Zola grew up) is established as the setting for the novel and described in intimate detail, and then we are introduced to the eccentric heroine Adelaide Fouque, later known as \"Tante Dide\", who becomes the common ancestor for both the Rougon and Macquart families. Her legitimate son from her short marriage to her late husband, a labourer named Rougon who worked on Dide's land, is forced to grow up alongside two illegitimate children \u2014 a boy and a girl \u2014 from Dide's later romance with the smuggler, poacher and alcoholic Macquart, while the ageing Dide slides further and further into a state of mental illness and borderline senile dementia. From this premise, the next nineteen novels all get their central protagonists and to a certain extent their themes.\nThe narrative continues along double lines, following both \"branches\" of the family. We see Pierre Rougon (the legitimate son) in his attempts to disinherit his Macquart half-siblings, his marriage to Felicit\u00e9 Puech, the voraciously ambitious daughter of a local merchant, and their continued failure to establish the fortune, fame and renown they seek, despite their greed and relatively comfortable lifestyles. Approaching old age, the Rougon couple finally admit defeat and settle, crushed, into their lower middle class destinies, until by a remarkable stroke of luck their eldest son Eug\u00e8ne reports from Paris that he has some news that they might find interesting. Eug\u00e8ne has become one of the closest allies of the future Emperor Napoleon III and informs his parents that a coup is imminent. Having been effectively given insider information about which side to back in the coming revolution, the Rougons then make a series of seemingly bold moves to show their loyal and steadfast support for Napoleon III, winning the admiration of the most influential people in the town, mostly royalists who are themselves afraid of showing too much commitment for fear of backing the \"wrong horse\" and losing their standing and fortune.\nThe narrative then switches over to the Macquart side of the family, whose grim working-class struggles to survive are juxtaposed keenly with the Rougons' seemingly trivial quest for greater wealth and influence in genteel drawing-room society. Descended from a drunken ne'er-do-well and a madwoman, Zola effectively predestines the Macquarts to lives of toil and misery. Zola's theories of heredity, laid out in the original preface to this novel, were a cornerstone of his entire philosophy and a major reason for his embarking on the mammoth Rougon-Macquart project in the first place in order to illustrate them. Largely discredited nowadays, the theories are largely \"present but unseen\" in most of the novels in the Rougon-Macquart cycle, allowing those books to be enjoyed without the overshadowing effect of Zola's somewhat suspect scientific ideas. Due to the original story nature of La Fortune des Rougon, the theories are placed much more to the fore, and can appear somewhat heavy-handed as a result.\nA third branch of the family, the Mourets, descended from Macquart and Dide's daughter, are then introduced before the novel's focus is brought back to the \"present\", the night of the coup, via a quite brilliantly told love story. The idealistic but na\u00efve Silv\u00e8re Mouret falls madly in love with the innocent Miette Chantegreil, and after a long courtship they decide to join up with the republicans to fight the coup. The rest of the novel then picks up from where the opening chapter left off, and from then on is basically a dual narrative telling the story of the old Rougon couple and their increasingly Machiavellian machinations to get themselves into a position of fortune and respect in Plassans, juxtaposed with Silv\u00e8re and Miette's continuing love story and the doomed republican militia's disastrous attempt to take the town back. Eventually, the Rougons exploit their half-brother Antoine Macquart into inadvertently helping crush the republican threat, and they achieve their life's ambition, fortune and favour. For Silv\u00e8re and Miette, who committed themselves so completely to a doomed cause, there can be no such happy ending and Zola wisely leaves their half of the story at a bleak dead end..\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Fortune of the Rougons, by Emile Zola\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Though it was by no means M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first essay\nin fiction, it was undoubtedly his first great bid for genuine literary\nfame, and the foundation of what must necessarily be regarded as his\nlife-work. The idea of writing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural and social history of a\nfamily under the Second Empire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d extending to a score of volumes, was\ndoubtless suggested to M. Zola by Balzac\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immortal \u00e2\u0080\u009cComedie Humaine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n He was twenty-eight years of age when this idea first occurred to him;\nhe was fifty-three when he at last sent the manuscript of his concluding\nvolume, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Pascal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the press. He had spent five-and-twenty years\nin working out his scheme, persevering with it doggedly and stubbornly,\nwhatever rebuffs he might encounter, whatever jeers and whatever insults\nmight be directed against him by the ignorant, the prejudiced, and the\nhypocritical. Truth was on the march and nothing could stay it; even as,\nat the present hour, its march, if slow, none the less continues athwart\nanother and a different crisis of the illustrious novelist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career.\n\nIt was in the early summer of 1869 that M. Zola first began the actual\nwriting of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fortune of the Rougons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was only in the following\nyear, however, that the serial publication of the work commenced in\nthe columns of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLe Siecle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Republican journal of most influence\nin Paris in those days of the Second Empire. The Franco-German war\ninterrupted this issue of the story, and publication in book form did\nnot take place until the latter half of 1871, a time when both the war\nand the Commune had left Paris exhausted, supine, with little or no\ninterest in anything. No more unfavourable moment for the issue of an\nambitious work of fiction could have been found. Some two or three\nyears went by, as I well remember, before anything like a revival of\nliterature and of public interest in literature took place. Thus, M.\nZola launched his gigantic scheme under auspices which would have made\nmany another man recoil. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fortune of the Rougons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and two or three\nsubsequent volumes of his series, attracted but a moderate degree\nof attention, and it was only on the morrow of the publication of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cL\u00e2\u0080\u0099Assommoir\u00e2\u0080\u009d that he awoke, like Byron, to find himself famous.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Rougon-Macquart series forms twenty\nvolumes. The last of these, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Pascal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d appeared in 1893. Since\nthen M. Zola has written \u00e2\u0080\u009cLourdes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cParis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Critics have\nrepeated _ad nauseam_ that these last works constitute a new departure\non M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part, and, so far as they formed a new series, this\nis true. But the suggestion that he has in any way repented of the\nRougon-Macquart novels is ridiculous. As he has often told me of recent\nyears, it is, as far as possible, his plan to subordinate his style and\nmethods to his subject. To have written a book like \u00e2\u0080\u009cRome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d so largely\ndevoted to the ambitions of the Papal See, in the same way as he had\nwritten books dealing with the drunkenness or other vices of Paris,\nwould have been the climax of absurdity.\n\nYet the publication of \u00e2\u0080\u009cRome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the signal for a general outcry on\nthe part of English and American reviewers that Zolaism, as typified by\nthe Rougon-Macquart series, was altogether a thing of the past. To my\nthinking this is a profound error. M. Zola has always remained faithful\nto himself. The only difference that I perceive between his latest\nwork, \u00e2\u0080\u009cParis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and certain Rougon-Macquart volumes, is that with time,\nexperience and assiduity, his genius has expanded and ripened, and that\nthe hesitation, the groping for truth, so to say, which may be found in\nsome of his earlier writings, has disappeared.\n\nAt the time when \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fortune of the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u009d was first published, none\nbut the author himself can have imagined that the foundation-stone of\none of the great literary monuments of the century had just been laid.\nFrom the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstory\u00e2\u0080\u009d point of view the book is one of M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very best,\nalthough its construction--particularly as regards the long interlude of\nthe idyll of Miette and Silvere--is far from being perfect. Such a work\nwhen first issued might well bring its author a measure of popularity,\nbut it could hardly confer fame. Nowadays, however, looking backward,\nand bearing in mind that one here has the genius of M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lifework,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fortune of the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u009d becomes a book of exceptional interest\nand importance. This has been so well understood by French readers that\nduring the last six or seven years the annual sales of the work have\nincreased threefold. Where, over a course of twenty years, 1,000 copies\nwere sold, 2,500 and 3,000 are sold to-day. How many living English\nnovelists can say the same of their early essays in fiction, issued more\nthan a quarter of a century ago?\n\nI may here mention that at the last date to which I have authentic\nfigures, that is, Midsummer 1897 (prior, of course, to what is called\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cL\u00e2\u0080\u0099Affaire Dreyfus\u00e2\u0080\u009d), there had been sold of the entire Rougon-Macquart\nseries (which had begun in 1871) 1,421,000 copies. These were of the\nordinary Charpentier editions of the French originals. By adding thereto\nseveral _editions de luxe_ and the widely-circulated popular illustrated\neditions of certain volumes, the total amounts roundly to 2,100,000.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cLourdes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cParis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and all M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other works, apart from\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cRougon-Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u009d series, together with the translations into a\ndozen different languages--English, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch,\nDanish, Portuguese, Bohemian, Hungarian, and others--are not included\nin the above figures. Otherwise the latter might well be doubled. Nor\nis account taken of the many serial issues which have brought M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nviews to the knowledge of the masses of all Europe.\n\nIt is, of course, the celebrity attaching to certain of M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nliterary efforts that has stimulated the demand for his other writings.\nAmong those which are well worthy of being read for their own sakes, I\nwould assign a prominent place to the present volume. Much of the story\nelement in it is admirable, and, further, it shows M. Zola as a\ngenuine satirist and humorist. The Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 yellow drawing-room and\nits habitues, and many of the scenes between Pierre Rougon and his wife\nFelicite, are worthy of the pen of Douglas Jerrold. The whole account,\nindeed, of the town of Plassans, its customs and its notabilities, is\nsatire of the most effective kind, because it is satire true to life,\nand never degenerates into mere caricature.\n\nIt is a rather curious coincidence that, at the time when M. Zola was\nthus portraying the life of Provence, his great contemporary, bosom\nfriend, and rival for literary fame, the late Alphonse Daudet, should\nhave been producing, under the title of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Provencal Don Quixote,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n that unrivalled presentment of the foibles of the French Southerner,\nwith everyone nowadays knows as \u00e2\u0080\u009cTartarin of Tarascon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is possible\nthat M. Zola, while writing his book, may have read the instalments of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLe Don Quichotte Provencal\u00e2\u0080\u009d published in the Paris \u00e2\u0080\u009cFigaro,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it may\nbe that this perusal imparted that fillip to his pen to which we owe\nthe many amusing particulars that he gives us of the town of Plassans.\nPlassans, I may mention, is really the Provencal Aix, which M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfather provided with water by means of a canal still bearing his name.\nM. Zola himself, though born in Paris, spent the greater part of his\nchildhood there. Tarascon, as is well known, never forgave Alphonse\nDaudet for his \u00e2\u0080\u009cTartarin\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and in a like way M. Zola, who doubtless\ncounts more enemies than any other literary man of the period, has none\nbitterer than the worthy citizens of Aix. They cannot forget or forgive\nthe rascally Rougon-Macquarts.\n\nThe name Rougon-Macquart has to me always suggested that splendid and\namusing type of the cynical rogue, Robert Macaire. But, of course, both\nRougon and Macquart are genuine French names and not inventions. Indeed,\nseveral years ago I came by chance upon them both, in an old French deed\nwhich I was examining at the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. I\nthere found mention of a Rougon family and a Macquart family dwelling\nvirtually side by side in the same village. This, however, was in\nChampagne, not in Provence. Both families farmed vineyards for a once\nfamous abbey in the vicinity of Epernay, early in the seventeenth\ncentury. To me, personally, this trivial discovery meant a great deal.\nIt somehow aroused my interest in M. Zola and his works. Of the latter I\nhad then only glanced through two or three volumes. With M. Zola himself\nI was absolutely unacquainted. However, I took the liberty to inform him\nof my little discovery; and afterwards I read all the books that he had\npublished. Now, as it is fairly well known, I have given the greater\npart of my time, for several years past, to the task of familiarising\nEnglish readers with his writings. An old deed, a chance glance,\nfollowed by the great friendship of my life and years of patient labour.\nIf I mention this matter, it is solely with the object of endorsing the\ntruth of the saying that the most insignificant incidents frequently\ninfluence and even shape our careers.\n\nBut I must come back to \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fortune of the Rougons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It has, as I have\nsaid, its satirical and humorous side; but it also contains a strong\nelement of pathos. The idyll of Miette and Silvere is a very touching\none, and quite in accord with the conditions of life prevailing in\nProvence at the period M. Zola selects for his narrative. Miette is\na frank child of nature; Silvere, her lover, in certain respects\nforeshadows, a quarter of a century in advance, the Abbe Pierre Fromont\nof \u00e2\u0080\u009cLourdes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cParis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The environment differs, of course,\nbut germs of the same nature may readily be detected in both characters.\nAs for the other personages of M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s book--on the one hand, Aunt\nDide, Pierre Rougon, his wife, Felicite, and their sons Eugene, Aristide\nand Pascal, and, on the other, Macquart, his daughter Gervaise of\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cL\u00e2\u0080\u0099Assommoir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his son Jean of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLa Terre\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cLa Debacle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d together\nwith the members of the Mouret branch of the ravenous, neurotic, duplex\nfamily--these are analysed or sketched in a way which renders their\nsubsequent careers, as related in other volumes of the series,\nthoroughly consistent with their origin and their up-bringing. I venture\nto asset that, although it is possible to read individual volumes of\nthe Rougon-Macquart series while neglecting others, nobody can really\nunderstand any one of these books unless he makes himself acquainted\nwith the alpha and the omega of the edifice, that is, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fortune of\nthe Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Pascal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith regard to the present English translation, it is based on one made\nfor my father several years ago. But to convey M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaning more\naccurately I have found it necessary to alter, on an average, at least\none sentence out of every three. Thus, though I only claim to edit the\nvolume, it is, to all intents and purposes, quite a new English version\nof M. Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work.\n\nE. A. V. MERTON, SURREY: August, 1898.\n\n\n\n\nAUTHOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099S PREFACE\n\nI wish to explain how a family, a small group of human beings, conducts\nitself in a given social system after blossoming forth and giving birth\nto ten or twenty members, who, though they may appear, at the first\nglance, profoundly dissimilar one from the other, are, as analysis\ndemonstrates, most closely linked together from the point of view of\naffinity. Heredity, like gravity, has its laws.\n\nBy resolving the duplex question of temperament and environment, I shall\nendeavour to discover and follow the thread of connection which leads\nmathematically from one man to another. And when I have possession of\nevery thread, and hold a complete social group in my hands, I shall\nshow this group at work, participating in an historical period; I shall\ndepict it in action, with all its varied energies, and I shall analyse\nboth the will power of each member, and the general tendency of the\nwhole.\n\nThe great characteristic of the Rougon-Macquarts, the group or family\nwhich I propose to study, is their ravenous appetite, the great\noutburst of our age which rushes upon enjoyment. Physiologically the\nRougon-Macquarts represent the slow succession of accidents pertaining\nto the nerves or the blood, which befall a race after the first organic\nlesion, and, according to environment, determine in each individual\nmember of the race those feelings, desires and passions--briefly, all\nthe natural and instinctive manifestations peculiar to humanity--whose\noutcome assumes the conventional name of virtue or vice. Historically\nthe Rougon-Macquarts proceed from the masses, radiate throughout the\nwhole of contemporary society, and ascend to all sorts of positions by\nthe force of that impulsion of essentially modern origin, which sets the\nlower classes marching through the social system. And thus the dramas of\ntheir individual lives recount the story of the Second Empire, from the\nambuscade of the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat to the treachery of Sedan.\n\nFor three years I had been collecting the necessary documents for this\nlong work, and the present volume was even written, when the fall of the\nBonapartes, which I needed artistically, and with, as if by fate, I\never found at the end of the drama, without daring to hope that it\nwould prove so near at hand, suddenly occurred and furnished me with\nthe terrible but necessary denouement for my work. My scheme is, at\nthis date, completed; the circle in which my characters will revolve\nis perfected; and my work becomes a picture of a departed reign, of a\nstrange period of human madness and shame.\n\nThis work, which will comprise several episodes, is therefore, in\nmy mind, the natural and social history of a family under the Second\nEmpire. And the first episode, here called \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Fortune of the Rougons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n should scientifically be entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Origin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEMILE ZOLA PARIS, July 1, 1871.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FORTUNE OF THE ROUGONS\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nOn quitting Plassans by the Rome Gate, on the southern side of the town,\nyou will find, on the right side of the road to Nice, and a little way\npast the first suburban houses, a plot of land locally known as the Aire\nSaint-Mittre.\n\nThis Aire Saint-Mittre is of oblong shape and on a level with the\nfootpath of the adjacent road, from which it is separated by a strip of\ntrodden grass. A narrow blind alley fringed with a row of hovels borders\nit on the right; while on the left, and at the further end, it is closed\nin by bits of wall overgrown with moss, above which can be seen the\ntop branches of the mulberry-trees of the Jas-Meiffren--an extensive\nproperty with an entrance lower down the road. Enclosed upon three\nsides, the Aire Saint-Mittre leads nowhere, and is only crossed by\npeople out for a stroll.\n\nIn former times it was a cemetery under the patronage of Saint-Mittre, a\ngreatly honoured Provencal saint; and in 1851 the old people of Plassans\ncould still remember having seen the wall of the cemetery standing,\nalthough the place itself had been closed for years. The soil had been\nso glutted with corpses that it had been found necessary to open a new\nburial-ground at the other end of town. Then the old abandoned cemetery\nhad been gradually purified by the dark thick-set vegetation which had\nsprouted over it every spring. The rich soil, in which the gravediggers\ncould no longer delve without turning up some human remains, was\npossessed of wondrous fertility. The tall weeds overtopped the walls\nafter the May rains and the June sunshine so as to be visible from the\nhigh road; while inside, the place presented the appearance of a deep,\ndark green sea studded with large blossoms of singular brilliancy.\nBeneath one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet amidst the close-set stalks one could feel that the\ndamp soil reeked and bubbled with sap.\n\nAmong the curiosities of the place at that time were some large\npear-trees, with twisted and knotty boughs; but none of the housewives\nof Plassans cared to pluck the large fruit which grew upon them. Indeed,\nthe townspeople spoke of this fruit with grimaces of disgust. No such\ndelicacy, however, restrained the suburban urchins, who assembled in\nbands at twilight and climbed the walls to steal the pears, even before\nthey were ripe.\n\nThe trees and the weeds with their vigorous growth had rapidly\nassimilated all the decomposing matter in the old cemetery of\nSaint-Mittre; the malaria rising from the human remains interred\nthere had been greedily absorbed by the flowers and the fruit; so that\neventually the only odour one could detect in passing by was the strong\nperfume of wild gillyflowers. This had merely been a question of a few\nsummers.\n\nAt last the townspeople determined to utilise this common property,\nwhich had long served no purpose. The walls bordering the roadway and\nthe blind alley were pulled down; the weeds and the pear-trees uprooted;\nthe sepulchral remains were removed; the ground was dug deep, and such\nbones as the earth was willing to surrender were heaped up in a\ncorner. For nearly a month the youngsters, who lamented the loss of\nthe pear-trees, played at bowls with the skulls; and one night\nsome practical jokers even suspended femurs and tibias to all the\nbell-handles of the town. This scandal, which is still remembered at\nPlassans, did not cease until the authorities decided to have the bones\nshot into a hole which had been dug for the purpose in the new cemetery.\nAll work, however, is usually carried out with discreet dilatoriness\nin country towns, and so during an entire week the inhabitants saw a\nsolitary cart removing these human remains as if they had been mere\nrubbish. The vehicle had to cross Plassans from end to end, and owing to\nthe bad condition of the roads fragments of bones and handfuls of rich\nmould were scattered at every jolt. There was not the briefest religious\nceremony, nothing but slow and brutish cartage. Never before had a town\nfelt so disgusted.\n\nFor several years the old cemetery remained an object of terror.\nAlthough it adjoined the main thoroughfare and was open to all comers,\nit was left quite deserted, a prey to fresh vegetable growth. The local\nauthorities, who had doubtless counted on selling it and seeing\nhouses built upon it, were evidently unable to find a purchaser. The\nrecollection of the heaps of bones and the cart persistently jolting\nthrough the streets may have made people recoil from the spot; or\nperhaps the indifference that was shown was due to the indolence, the\nrepugnance to pulling down and setting up again, which is characteristic\nof country people. At all events the authorities still retained\npossession of the ground, and at last forgot their desire to dispose of\nit. They did not even erect a fence round it, but left it open to all\ncomers. Then, as time rolled on, people gradually grew accustomed to\nthis barren spot; they would sit on the grass at the edges, walk about,\nor gather in groups. When the grass had been worn away and the\ntrodden soil had become grey and hard, the old cemetery resembled a\nbadly-levelled public square. As if the more effectually to efface the\nmemory of all objectionable associations, the inhabitants slowly changed\nthe very appellation of the place, retaining but the name of the saint,\nwhich was likewise applied to the blind alley dipping down at one corner\nof the field. Thus there was the Aire Saint-Mittre and the Impasse\nSaint-Mittre.\n\nAll this dates, however, from some considerable time back. For more\nthan thirty years now the Aire Saint-Mittre has presented a different\nappearance. One day the townspeople, far too inert and indifferent to\nderive any advantage from it, let it, for a trifling consideration,\nto some suburban wheelwrights, who turned it into a wood-yard. At the\npresent day it is still littered with huge pieces of timber thirty or\nforty feet long, lying here and there in piles, and looking like lofty\noverturned columns. These piles of timber, disposed at intervals from\none end of the yard to the other, are a continual source of delight\nto the local urchins. In some places the ground is covered with fallen\nwood, forming a kind of uneven flooring over which it is impossible to\nwalk, unless one balance one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self with marvellous dexterity. Troops of\nchildren amuse themselves with this exercise all day long. You will see\nthem jumping over the big beams, walking in Indian file along the narrow\nends, or else crawling astride them; various games which generally\nterminate in blows and bellowings. Sometimes, too, a dozen of them will\nsit, closely packed one against the other, on the thin end of a pole\nraised a few feet from the ground, and will see-saw there for hours\ntogether. The Aire Saint-Mittre thus serves as a recreation ground,\nwhere for more than a quarter of a century all the little suburban\nragamuffins have been in the habit of wearing out the seats of their\nbreeches.\n\nThe strangeness of the place is increased by the circumstance that\nwandering gipsies, by a sort of traditional custom always select the\nvacant portions of it for their encampments. Whenever any caravan\narrives at Plassans it takes up its quarters on the Aire Saint-Mittre.\nThe place is consequently never empty. There is always some strange band\nthere, some troop of wild men and withered women, among whom groups of\nhealthy-looking children roll about on the grass. These people live\nin the open air, regardless of everybody, setting their pots boiling,\neating nameless things, freely displaying their tattered garments, and\nsleeping, fighting, kissing, and reeking with mingled filth and misery.\n\nThe field, formerly so still and deserted, save for the buzzing of\nhornets around the rich blossoms in the heavy sunshine, has thus become\na very rowdy spot, resounding with the noisy quarrels of the gipsies and\nthe shrill cries of the urchins of the suburb. In one corner there is a\nprimitive saw-mill for cutting the timber, the noise from which serves\nas a dull, continuous bass accompaniment to the sharp voices. The wood\nis placed on two high tressels, and a couple of sawyers, one of whom\nstands aloft on the timber itself, while the other underneath is half\nblinded by the falling sawdust, work a large saw to and fro for\nhours together, with rigid machine-like regularity, as if they were\nwire-pulled puppets. The wood they saw is stacked, plank by plank, along\nthe wall at the end, in carefully arranged piles six or eight feet high,\nwhich often remain there several seasons, and constitute one of the\ncharms of the Aire Saint-Mittre. Between these stacks are mysterious,\nretired little alleys leading to a broader path between the timber and\nthe wall, a deserted strip of verdure whence only small patches of\nsky can be seen. The vigorous vegetation and the quivering, deathlike\nstillness of the old cemetery still reign in this path. In all the\ncountry round Plassans there is no spot more instinct with languor,\nsolitude, and love. It is a most delightful place for love-making. When\nthe cemetery was being cleared the bones must have been heaped up in\nthis corner; for even to-day it frequently happens that one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot comes\nacross some fragment of a skull lying concealed in the damp turf.\n\nNobody, however, now thinks of the bodies that once slept under that\nturf. In the daytime only the children go behind the piles of wood when\nplaying at hide and seek. The green path remains virginal, unknown to\nothers who see nought but the wood-yard crowded with timber and grey\nwith dust. In the morning and afternoon, when the sun is warm, the whole\nplace swarms with life. Above all the turmoil, above the ragamuffins\nplaying among the timber, and the gipsies kindling fires under their\ncauldrons, the sharp silhouette of the sawyer mounted on his beam stands\nout against the sky, moving to and fro with the precision of clockwork,\nas if to regulate the busy activity that has sprung up in this spot\nonce set apart for eternal slumber. Only the old people who sit on the\nplanks, basking in the setting sun, speak occasionally among themselves\nof the bones which they once saw carted through the streets of Plassans\nby the legendary tumbrel.\n\nWhen night falls the Aire Saint-Mittre loses its animation, and looks\nlike some great black hole. At the far end one may just espy the dying\nembers of the gipsies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fires, and at times shadows slink noiselessly\ninto the dense darkness. The place becomes quite sinister, particularly\nin winter time.\n\nOne Sunday evening, at about seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, a young man stepped lightly\nfrom the Impasse Saint-Mittre, and, closely skirting the walls, took\nhis way among the timber in the wood-yard. It was in the early part of\nDecember, 1851. The weather was dry and cold. The full moon shone with\nthat sharp brilliancy peculiar to winter moons. The wood-yard did not\nhave the forbidding appearance which it wears on rainy nights; illumined\nby stretches of white light, and wrapped in deep and chilly silence, it\nspread around with a soft, melancholy aspect.\n\nFor a few seconds the young man paused on the edge of the yard and gazed\nmistrustfully in front of him. He carried a long gun, the butt-end of\nwhich was hidden under his jacket, while the barrel, pointed towards the\nground, glittered in the moonlight. Pressing the weapon to his side, he\nattentively examined the square shadows cast by the piles of timber. The\nground looked like a chess-board, with black and white squares clearly\ndefined by alternate patches of light and shade. The sawyers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tressels\nin the centre of the plot threw long, narrow fantastic shadows,\nsuggesting some huge geometrical figure, upon a strip of bare grey\nground. The rest of the yard, the flooring of beams, formed a great\ncouch on which the light reposed, streaked here and there with the\nslender black shadows which edged the different pieces of timber. In the\nfrigid silence under the wintry moon, the motionless, recumbent poles,\nstiffened, as it were, with sleep and cold, recalled the corpses of\nthe old cemetery. The young man cast but a rapid glance round the empty\nspace; there was not a creature, not a sound, no danger of being seen or\nheard. The black patches at the further end caused him more anxiety, but\nafter a brief examination he plucked up courage and hurriedly crossed\nthe wood-yard.\n\nAs soon as he felt himself under cover he slackened his pace. He was now\nin the green pathway skirting the wall behind the piles of planks. Here\nhis very footsteps became inaudible; the frozen grass scarcely crackled\nunder his tread. He must have loved the spot, have feared no danger,\nsought nothing but what was pleasant there. He no longer concealed\nhis gun. The path stretched away like a dark trench, except that the\nmoonrays, gliding ever and anon between the piles of timber, then\nstreaked the grass with patches of light. All slept, both darkness and\nlight, with the same deep, soft, sad slumber. No words can describe the\ncalm peacefulness of the place. The young man went right down the path,\nand stopped at the end where the walls of the Jas-Meiffren form an\nangle. Here he listened as if to ascertain whether any sound might be\ncoming from the adjoining estate. At last, hearing nothing, he stooped\ndown, thrust a plank aside, and hid his gun in a timber-stack.\n\nAn old tombstone, which had been overlooked in the clearing of the\nburial-ground, lay in the corner, resting on its side and forming a high\nand slightly sloping seat. The rain had worn its edges, and moss was\nslowly eating into it. Nevertheless, the following fragment of an\ninscription, cut on the side which was sinking into the ground, might\nstill have been distinguished in the moonlight: \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Here lieth . . . Marie\n. . . died . . ._\u00e2\u0080\u009d The finger of time had effaced the rest.\n\nWhen the young man had concealed his gun he again listened attentively,\nand still hearing nothing, resolved to climb upon the stone. The wall\nbeing low, he was able to rest his elbows on the coping. He could,\nhowever, perceive nothing except a flood of light beyond the row of\nmulberry-trees skirting the wall. The flat ground of the Jas-Meiffren\nspread out under the moon like an immense sheet of unbleached linen;\na hundred yards away the farmhouse and its outbuildings formed a still\nwhiter patch. The young man was still gazing anxiously in that direction\nwhen, suddenly, one of the town clocks slowly and solemnly struck seven.\nHe counted the strokes, and then jumped down, apparently surprised and\nrelieved.\n\nHe seated himself on the tombstone, like one who is prepared to\nwait some considerable time. And for about half an hour he remained\nmotionless and deep in thought, apparently quite unconscious of the\ncold, while his eyes gazed fixedly at a mass of shadow. He had placed\nhimself in a dark corner, but the beams of the rising moon had gradually\nreached him, and at last his head was in the full light.\n\nHe was a strong, sturdy-looking lad, with a fine mouth, and soft\ndelicate skin that bespoke youthfulness. He looked about seventeen years\nof age, and was handsome in a characteristic way.\n\nHis thin, long face looked like the work of some master sculptor; his\nhigh forehead, overhanging brows, aquiline nose, broad flat chin, and\nprotruding cheek bones, gave singularly bold relief to his countenance.\nSuch a face would, with advancing age, become too bony, as fleshless as\nthat of a knight errant. But at this stage of youth, with chin and cheek\nlightly covered with soft down, its latent harshness was attenuated by\nthe charming softness of certain contours which had remained vague and\nchildlike. His soft black eyes, still full of youth, also lent delicacy\nto his otherwise vigorous countenance. The young fellow would probably\nnot have fascinated all women, as he was not what one calls a handsome\nman; but his features, as a whole, expressed such ardent and sympathetic\nlife, such enthusiasm and energy, that they doubtless engaged the\nthoughts of the girls of his own part--those sunburnt girls of the\nSouth--as he passed their doors on sultry July evenings.\n\nHe remained seated upon the tombstone, wrapped in thought, and\napparently quite unconscious of the moonlight which now fell upon\nhis chest and legs. He was of middle stature, rather thick-set, with\nover-developed arms and a labourer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands, already hardened by toil;\nhis feet, shod with heavy laced boots, looked large and square-toed.\nHis general appearance, more particularly the heaviness of his limbs,\nbespoke lowly origin. There was, however, something in him, in the\nupright bearing of his neck and the thoughtful gleams of his eyes, which\nseemed to indicate an inner revolt against the brutifying manual labour\nwhich was beginning to bend him to the ground. He was, no doubt, an\nintelligent nature buried beneath the oppressive burden of race and\nclass; one of those delicate refined minds embedded in a rough envelope,\nfrom which they in vain struggle to free themselves. Thus, in spite of\nhis vigour, he seemed timid and restless, feeling a kind of unconscious\nshame at his imperfection. An honest lad he doubtless was, whose very\nignorance had generated enthusiasm, whose manly heart was impelled by\nchildish intellect, and who could show alike the submissiveness of\na woman and the courage of a hero. On the evening in question he was\ndressed in a coat and trousers of greenish corduroy. A soft felt hat,\nplaced lightly on the back of his head, cast a streak of shadow over his\nbrow.\n\nAs the neighbouring clock struck the half hour, he suddenly started from\nhis reverie. Perceiving that the white moonlight was shining full upon\nhim, he gazed anxiously ahead. Then he abruptly dived back into the\nshade, but was unable to recover the thread of his thoughts. He now\nrealised that his hands and feet were becoming very cold, and impatience\nseized hold of him. So he jumped upon the stone again, and once more\nglanced over the Jas-Meiffren, which was still empty and silent.\nFinally, at a loss how to employ his time, he jumped down, fetched\nhis gun from the pile of planks where he had concealed it, and amused\nhimself by working the trigger. The weapon was a long, heavy carbine,\nwhich had doubtless belonged to some smuggler. The thickness of the butt\nand the breech of the barrel showed it to be an old flintlock which had\nbeen altered into a percussion gun by some local gunsmith. Such firearms\nare to be found in farmhouses, hanging against the wall over the\nchimney-piece. The young man caressed his weapon with affection; twenty\ntimes or more he pulled the trigger, thrust his little finger into the\nbarrel, and examined the butt attentively. By degrees he grew full of\nyouth enthusiasm, combined with childish frolicsomeness, and ended by\nlevelling his weapon and aiming at space, like a recruit going through\nhis drill.\n\nIt was now very nearly eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and he had been holding his gun\nlevelled for over a minute, when all at once a low, panting call, light\nas a breath, came from the direction of the Jas-Meiffren.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you there, Silvere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the voice asked.\n\nSilvere dropped his gun and bounded on to the tombstone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, also in a hushed voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBefore he could stretch out his arms, however, a girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head appeared\nabove the wall. With singular agility the damsel had availed herself of\nthe trunk of a mulberry-tree, and climbed aloft like a kitten. The ease\nand certainty with which she moved showed that she was familiar with\nthis strange spot. In another moment she was seated on the coping of\nthe wall. Then Silvere, taking her in his arms, carried her, though not\nwithout a struggle, to the seat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she laughingly cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet go, I can get down alone very\nwell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And when she was seated on the stone slab she added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you been waiting for me long? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been running, and am quite out\nof breath.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere made no reply. He seemed in no laughing humour, but gazed\nsorrowfully into the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to see you, Miette,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, as he seated himself beside her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should have waited all night\nfor you. I am going away at daybreak to-morrow morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiette had just caught sight of the gun lying on the grass, and with a\nthoughtful air, she murmured: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decided then? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your\ngun!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Silvere, after a brief pause, his voice still faltering,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my gun. I thought it best to remove it from the house to-night;\nto-morrow morning aunt Dide might have seen me take it, and have felt\nuneasy about it. I am going to hide it, and shall fetch it just before\nstarting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, as Miette could not remove her eyes from the weapon which he had\nso foolishly left on the grass, he jumped up and again hid it among the\nwoodstacks.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe learnt this morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as he resumed his seat, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the\ninsurgents of La Palud and Saint Martin-de-Vaulx were on the march, and\nspent last night at Alboise. We have decided to join them. Some of the\nworkmen of Plassans have already left the town this afternoon; those who\nstill remain will join their brothers to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke the word brothers with youthful emphasis.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA contest is becoming inevitable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, at any rate, we have\nright on our side, and we shall triumph.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiette listened to Silvere, her eyes meantime gazing in front of her,\nwithout observing anything.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, when he had finished speaking. And after a fresh\npause she continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou warned me, yet I still hoped. . . . However,\nit is decided.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNeither of them knew what else to say. The green path in the deserted\ncorner of the wood-yard relapsed into melancholy stillness; only the\nmoon chased the shadows of the piles of timber over the grass. The two\nyoung people on the tombstone remained silent and motionless in the\npale light. Silvere had passed his arm round Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist, and she was\nleaning against his shoulder. They exchanged no kisses, naught but\nan embrace in which love showed the innocent tenderness of fraternal\naffection.\n\nMiette was enveloped in a long brown hooded cloak reaching to her feet,\nand leaving only her head and hands visible. The women of the lower\nclasses in Provence--the peasantry and workpeople--still wear these\nample cloaks, which are called pelisses; it is a fashion which must have\nlasted for ages. Miette had thrown back her hood on arriving. Living in\nthe open air and born of a hotblooded race, she never wore a cap. Her\nbare head showed in bold relief against the wall, which the moonlight\nwhitened. She was still a child, no doubt, but a child ripening into\nwomanhood. She had reached that adorable, uncertain hour when the\nfrolicsome girl changes to a young woman. At that stage of life a\nbud-like delicacy, a hesitancy of contour that is exquisitely charming,\ndistinguishes young girls. The outlines of womanhood appear amidst\ngirlhood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innocent slimness, and woman shoots forth at first all\nembarrassment, still retaining much of the child, and ever and\nunconsciously betraying her sex. This period is very unpropitious for\nsome girls, who suddenly shoot up, become ugly, sallow and frail, like\nplants before their due season. For those, however, who, like Miette,\nare healthy and live in the open air, it is a time of delightful\ngracefulness which once passed can never be recalled.\n\nMiette was thirteen years of age, and although strong and sturdy did not\nlook any older, so bright and childish was the smile which lit up her\ncountenance. However, she was nearly as tall as Silvere, plump and full\nof life. Like her lover, she had no common beauty. She would not have\nbeen considered ugly, but she might have appeared peculiar to many young\nexquisites. Her rich black hair rose roughly erect above her forehead,\nstreamed back like a rushing wave, and flowed over her head and neck\nlike an inky sea, tossing and bubbling capriciously. It was very thick\nand inconvenient to arrange. However, she twisted it as tightly as\npossible into coils as thick as a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fist, which she wound together\nat the back of her head. She had little time to devote to her toilette,\nbut this huge chignon, hastily contrived without the aid of any mirror,\nwas often instinct with vigorous grace. On seeing her thus naturally\nhelmeted with a mass of frizzy hair which hung about her neck and\ntemples like a mane, one could readily understand why she always went\nbareheaded, heedless alike of rain and frost.\n\nUnder her dark locks appeared her low forehead, curved and golden like a\ncrescent moon. Her large prominent eyes, her short tip-tilted nose with\ndilated nostrils, and her thick ruddy lips, when regarded apart from one\nanother, would have looked ugly; viewed, however, all together, amidst\nthe delightful roundness and vivacious mobility of her countenance, they\nformed an ensemble of strange, surprising beauty. When Miette laughed,\nthrowing back her head and gently resting it on her right shoulder, she\nresembled an old-time Bacchante, her throat distending with sonorous\ngaiety, her cheeks round like those of a child, her teeth large and\nwhite, her twists of woolly hair tossed by every outburst of merriment,\nand waving like a crown of vine leaves. To realise that she was only a\nchild of thirteen, one had to notice the innocence underlying her full\nwomanly laughter, and especially the child-like delicacy of her chin and\nsoft transparency of her temples. In certain lights Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sun-tanned\nface showed yellow like amber. A little soft black down already shaded\nher upper lip. Toil too was beginning to disfigure her small hands,\nwhich, if left idle, would have become charmingly plump and delicate.\n\nMiette and Silvere long remained silent. They were reading their own\nanxious thoughts, and, as they pondered upon the unknown terrors of the\nmorrow, they tightened their mutual embrace. Their hearts communed with\neach other, they understood how useless and cruel would be any verbal\nplaint. The girl, however, could at last no longer contain herself,\nand, choking with emotion, she gave expression, in one phrase, to their\nmutual misgivings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will come back again, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered, as she hung on\nSilvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck.\n\nSilvere made no reply, but, half-stifling, and fearing lest he should\ngive way to tears like herself, he kissed her in brotherly fashion\non the cheek, at a loss for any other consolation. Then disengaging\nthemselves they again lapsed into silence.\n\nAfter a moment Miette shuddered. Now that she no longer leant against\nSilvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder she was becoming icy cold. Yet she would not have\nshuddered thus had she been in this deserted path the previous evening,\nseated on this tombstone, where for several seasons they had tasted so\nmuch happiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very cold,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as she pulled her hood over her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShall we walk about a little?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young man asked her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not yet\nnine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock; we can take a stroll along the road.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiette reflected that for a long time she would probably not have the\npleasure of another meeting--another of those evening chats, the joy of\nwhich served to sustain her all day long.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, let us walk a little,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she eagerly replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us go as far as\nthe mill. I could pass the whole night like this if you wanted to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey rose from the tombstone, and were soon hidden in the shadow of a\npile of planks. Here Miette opened her cloak, which had a quilted\nlining of red twill, and threw half of it over Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders,\nthus enveloping him as he stood there close beside her. The same garment\ncloaked them both, and they passed their arms round each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist,\nand became as it were but one being. When they were thus shrouded in the\npelisse they walked slowly towards the high road, fearlessly crossing\nthe vacant parts of the wood-yard, which looked white in the moonlight.\nMiette had thrown the cloak over Silvere, and he had submitted to it\nquite naturally, as though indeed the garment rendered them a similar\nservice every evening.\n\nThe road to Nice, on either side of which the suburban houses are built,\nwas, in the year 1851, lined with ancient elm-trees, grand and gigantic\nruins, still full of vigour, which the fastidious town council has\nreplaced, some years since, by some little plane-trees. When Silvere and\nMiette found themselves under the elms, the huge boughs of which cast\nshadows on the moonlit footpath, they met now and again black forms\nwhich silently skirted the house fronts. These, too, were amorous\ncouples, closely wrapped in one and the same cloak, and strolling in the\ndarkness.\n\nThis style of promenading has been instituted by the young lovers of\nSouthern towns. Those boys and girls among the people who mean to marry\nsooner or later, but who do not dislike a kiss or two in advance, know\nno spot where they can kiss at their ease without exposing themselves to\nrecognition and gossip. Accordingly, while strolling about the suburbs,\nthe plots of waste land, the footpaths of the high road--in fact,\nall these places where there are few passers-by and numerous shady\nnooks--they conceal their identity by wrapping themselves in these long\ncloaks, which are capacious enough to cover a whole family. The parents\ntolerate these proceedings; however stiff may be provincial propriety,\nno apprehensions, seemingly, are entertained. And, on the other hand,\nnothing could be more charming than these lovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rambles, which appeal\nso keenly to the Southerner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fanciful imagination. There is a veritable\nmasquerade, fertile in innocent enjoyments, within the reach of the most\nhumble. The girl clasps her sweetheart to her bosom, enveloping him in\nher own warm cloak; and no doubt it is delightful to be able to kiss\none\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sweetheart within those shrouding folds without danger of being\nrecognised. One couple is exactly like another. And to the belated\npedestrian, who sees the vague groups gliding hither and thither, \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis\nmerely love passing, love guessed and scarce espied. The lovers\nknow they are safely concealed within their cloaks, they converse in\nundertones and make themselves quite at home; most frequently they do\nnot converse at all, but walk along at random and in silence, content\nin their embrace. The climate alone is to blame for having in the first\ninstance prompted these young lovers to retire to secluded spots in the\nsuburbs. On fine summer nights one cannot walk round Plassans without\ncoming across a hooded couple in every patch of shadow falling from the\nhouse walls. Certain places, the Aire Saint-Mittre, for instance, are\nfull of these dark \u00e2\u0080\u009cdominoes\u00e2\u0080\u009d brushing past one another, gliding softly\nin the warm nocturnal air. One might imagine they were guests invited\nto some mysterious ball given by the stars to lowly lovers. When the\nweather is very warm and the girls do not wear cloaks, they simply turn\nup their over-skirts. And in the winter the more passionate lovers make\nlight of the frosts. Thus, Miette and Silvere, as they descended the\nNice road, thought little of the chill December night.\n\nThey passed through the slumbering suburb without exchanging a word,\nbut enjoying the mute delight of their warm embrace. Their hearts were\nheavy; the joy which they felt in being side by side was tinged with the\npainful emotion which comes from the thought of approaching severance,\nand it seemed to them that they could never exhaust the mingled\nsweetness and bitterness of the silence which slowly lulled their\nsteps. But the houses soon grew fewer, and they reached the end of the\nFaubourg. There stands the entrance to the Jas-Meiffren, an iron gate\nfixed to two strong pillars; a low row of mulberry-trees being visible\nthrough the bars. Silvere and Miette instinctively cast a glance inside\nas they passed on.\n\nBeyond the Jas-Meiffren the road descends with a gentle slope to a\nvalley, which serves as the bed of a little rivulet, the Viorne, a brook\nin summer but a torrent in winter. The rows of elms still extended the\nwhole way at that time, making the high road a magnificent avenue, which\ncast a broad band of gigantic trees across the hill, which was planted\nwith corn and stunted vines. On that December night, under the clear\ncold moonlight, the newly-ploughed fields stretching away on either hand\nresembled vast beds of greyish wadding which deadened every sound in the\natmosphere. The dull murmur of the Viorne in the distance alone sent a\nquivering thrill through the profound silence of the country-side.\n\nWhen the young people had begun to descend the avenue, Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughts\nreverted to the Jas-Meiffren which they had just left behind them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had great difficulty in getting away this evening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\nuncle wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let me go. He had shut himself up in a cellar, where he\nwas hiding his money, I think, for he seemed greatly frightened this\nmorning at the events that are taking place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere clasped her yet more lovingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe brave!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe time\nwill come when we shall be able to see each other freely the whole day\nlong. You must not fret.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the girl, shaking her head, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are very hopeful. For my\npart I sometimes feel very sad. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the hard work which grieves me;\non the contrary, I am often very glad of my uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s severity, and the\ntasks he sets me. He was quite right to make me a peasant girl; I should\nperhaps have turned out badly, for, do you know, Silvere, there are\nmoments when I fancy myself under a curse. . . . I feel, then, that I\nshould like to be dead. . . . I think of you know whom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs she spoke these last words, her voice broke into a sob. Silvere\ninterrupted her somewhat harshly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe quiet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou promised not\nto think about it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no crime of yours. . . . We love each other very\nmuch, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added in a gentler tone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re married you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nhave no more unpleasant hours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured Miette. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are so kind, you sustain me. But what am\nI to do? I sometimes have fears and feelings of revolt. I think at times\nthat I have been wronged, and then I should like to do something wicked.\nYou see I pour forth my heart to you. Whenever my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name is\nthrown in my face, I feel my whole body burning. When the urchins cry\nat me as I pass, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Eh, La Chantegreil,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I lose all control of myself, and\nfeel that I should like to lay hold of them and whip them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter a savage pause she resumed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for you, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a man; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\ngoing to fight; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very lucky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere had let her speak on. After a few steps he observed sorrowfully:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are wrong, Miette; yours is bad anger. You shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rebel against\njustice. As for me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to fight in defence of our common rights,\nnot to gratify any personal animosity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the same,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young girl continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like to be a man and\nhandle a gun. I feel that it would do me good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, as Silvere remained silent, she perceived that she had displeased\nhim. Her feverishness subsided, and she whispered in a supplicating\ntone: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are not angry with me, are you? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your departure which\ngrieves me and awakens such ideas. I know very well you are right--that\nI ought to be humble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she began to cry, and Silvere, moved by her tears, grasped her\nhands and kissed them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee, now, how you pass from anger to tears, like a child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\nlovingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must be reasonable. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not scolding you. I only want to\nsee you happier, and that depends largely upon yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe remembrance of the drama which Miette had so sadly evoked cast a\ntemporary gloom over the lovers. They continued their walk with bowed\nheads and troubled thoughts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m much happier than you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere at last inquired,\nresuming the conversation in spite of himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf my grandmother had\nnot taken care of me and educated me, what would have become of me? With\nthe exception of my Uncle Antoine, who is an artisan like myself, and\nwho taught me to love the Republic, all my other relations seem to fear\nthat I might besmirch them by coming near them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was now speaking with animation, and suddenly stopped, detaining\nMiette in the middle of the road.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod is my witness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I do not envy or hate anybody.\nBut if we triumph, I shall have to tell the truth to those fine\ngentlemen. Uncle Antoine knows all about this matter. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see when we\nreturn. We shall all live free and happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Miette gently led him on, and they resumed their walk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou dearly love your Republic?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the girl asked, essaying a joke. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo\nyou love me as much?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer smile was not altogether free from a tinge of bitterness. She was\nthinking, perhaps, how easily Silvere abandoned her to go and scour the\ncountry-side. But the lad gravely replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are my wife, to whom I\nhave given my whole heart. I love the Republic because I love you. When\nwe are married we shall want plenty of happiness, and it is to procure a\nshare of that happiness that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going way to-morrow morning. You surely\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to persuade me to remain at home?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the girl eagerly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA man should be brave! Courage\nis beautiful! You must forgive my jealousy. I should like to be as\nstrong-minded as you are. You would love me all the more, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silence she added, with charming vivacity and\ningenuousness: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, how willingly I shall kiss you when you come back!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis outburst of a loving and courageous heart deeply affected Silvere.\nHe clasped Miette in his arms and printed several kisses on her cheek.\nAs she laughingly struggled to escape him, her eyes filled with tears of\nemotion.\n\nAll around the lovers the country still slumbered amid the deep\nstillness of the cold. They were now half-way down the hill. On the top\nof a rather lofty hillock to the left stood the ruins of a windmill,\nblanched by the moon; the tower, which had fallen in on one side, alone\nremained. This was the limit which the young people had assigned to\ntheir walk. They had come straight from the Faubourg without casting a\nsingle glance at the fields between which they passed. When Silvere had\nkissed Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheek, he raised his head and observed the mill.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a long walk we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSee--here is the mill. It\nmust be nearly half-past nine. We must go home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Miette pouted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us walk a little further,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she implored; \u00e2\u0080\u009conly a\nfew steps, just as far as the little cross-road, no farther, really.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere smiled as he again took her round the waist. Then they continued\nto descend the hill, no longer fearing inquisitive glances, for they had\nnot met a living soul since passing the last houses. They nevertheless\nremained enveloped in the long pelisse, which seemed, as it were, a\nnatural nest for their love. It had shrouded them on so many happy\nevenings! Had they simply walked side by side, they would have felt\nsmall and isolated in that vast stretch of country, whereas, blended\ntogether as they were, they became bolder and seemed less puny. Between\nthe folds of the pelisse they gazed upon the fields stretching on both\nsides of the road, without experiencing that crushing feeling with which\nfar-stretching callous vistas oppress the human affections. It seemed\nto them as though they had brought their house with them; they felt a\npleasure in viewing the country-side as from a window, delighting in the\ncalm solitude, the sheets of slumbering light, the glimpses of nature\nvaguely distinguishable beneath the shroud of night and winter, the\nwhole of that valley indeed, which while charming them could not thrust\nitself between their close-pressed hearts.\n\nAll continuity of conversation had ceased; they spoke no more of others,\nnor even of themselves. They were absorbed by the present, pressing each\nother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands, uttering exclamations at the sight of some particular\nspot, exchanging words at rare intervals, and then understanding each\nother but little, for drowsiness came from the warmth of their embrace.\nSilvere forgot his Republican enthusiasm; Miette no longer reflected\nthat her lover would be leaving her in an hour, for a long time, perhaps\nfor ever. The transports of their affection lulled them into a feeling\nof security, as on other days, when no prospect of parting had marred\nthe tranquility of their meetings.\n\nThey still walked on, and soon reached the little crossroad mentioned by\nMiette--a bit of a lane which led through the fields to a village on the\nbanks of the Viorne. But they passed on, pretending not to notice\nthis path, where they had agreed to stop. And it was only some minutes\nafterwards that Silvere whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be very late; you will get\ntired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; I assure you I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not at all tired,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the girl replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could walk\nseveral leagues like this easily.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, in a coaxing tone, she added:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us go down as far as the meadows of Sainte-Claire. There we will\nreally stop and turn back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere, whom the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rhythmic gait lulled to semi-somnolence, made\nno objection, and their rapture began afresh. They now went on more\nslowly, fearing the moment when they would have to retrace their steps.\nSo long as they walked onward, they felt as though they were advancing\nto the eternity of their mutual embrace; the return would mean\nseparation and bitter leave-taking.\n\nThe declivity of the road was gradually becoming more gentle. In the\nvalley below there are meadows extending as far as the Viorne, which\nruns at the other end, beneath a range of low hills. These meadows,\nseparated from the high-road by thickset hedges, are the meadows of\nSainte-Claire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Silvere this time, as he caught sight of the first\npatches of grass: \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe may as well go as far as the bridge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this Miette burst out laughing, clasped the young man round the neck,\nand kissed him noisily.\n\nAt the spot where the hedges begin, there were in those days two elms\nforming the end of the long avenue, two colossal trees larger than any\nof the others. The treeless fields stretch out from the high road, like\na broad band of green wool, as far as the willows and birches by the\nriver. The distance from the last elms to the bridge is scarcely three\nhundred yards. The lovers took a good quarter of an hour to cover that\nspace. At last, however slow their gait, they reached the bridge, and\nthere they stopped.\n\nThe road to Nice ran up in front of them, along the opposite slope of\nthe valley. But they could only see a small portion of it, as it takes a\nsudden turn about half a mile from the bridge, and is lost to view among\nthe wooded hills. On looking round they caught sight of the other end\nof the road, that which they had just traversed, and which leads in\na direct line from Plassans to the Viorne. In the beautiful winter\nmoonlight it looked like a long silver ribbon, with dark edgings traced\nby the rows of elms. On the right and left the ploughed hill-land showed\nlike vast, grey, vague seas intersected by this ribbon, this roadway\nwhite with frost, and brilliant as with metallic lustre. Up above, on a\nlevel with the horizon, lights shone from a few windows in the Faubourg,\nresembling glowing sparks. By degrees Miette and Silvere had walked\nfully a league. They gazed at the intervening road, full of silent\nadmiration for the vast amphitheatre which rose to the verge of the\nheavens, and over which flowed bluish streams of light, as over the\nsuperposed rocks of a gigantic waterfall. The strange and colossal\npicture spread out amid deathlike stillness and silence. Nothing could\nhave been of more sovereign grandeur.\n\nThen the young people, having leant against the parapet of the bridge,\ngazed beneath them. The Viorne, swollen by the rains, flowed on with a\ndull, continuous sound. Up and down stream, despite the darkness which\nfilled the hollows, they perceived the black lines of the trees growing\non the banks; here and there glided the moonbeams, casting a trail of\nmolten metal, as it were, over the water, which glittered and danced\nlike rays of light on the scales of some live animal. The gleams darted\nwith a mysterious charm along the gray torrent, betwixt the vague\nphantom-like foliage. You might have thought this an enchanted valley,\nsome wondrous retreat where a community of shadows and gleams lived a\nfantastic life.\n\nThis part of the river was familiar to the lovers; they had often come\nhere in search of coolness on warm July nights; they had spent hours\nhidden among the clusters of willows on the right bank, at the spot\nwhere the meadows of Sainte-Claire spread their verdant carpet to the\nwaterside. They remembered every bend of the bank, the stones on which\nthey had stepped in order to cross the Viorne, at that season as narrow\nas a brooklet, and certain little grassy hollows where they had indulged\nin their dreams of love. Miette, therefore, now gazed from the bridge at\nthe right bank of the torrent with longing eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it were warmer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she sighed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe might go down and rest awhile\nbefore going back up the hill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, after a pause, during which\nshe kept her eyes fixed on the banks, she resumed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook down there,\nSilvere, at that black mass yonder in front of the lock. Do you\nremember? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the brushwood where we sat last Corpus Christi Day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, so it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Silvere, softly.\n\nThis was the spot where they had first ventured to kiss each other on\nthe cheek. The remembrance just roused by the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words brought both\nof them a delightful feeling, an emotion in which the joys of the\npast mingled with the hopes of the morrow. Before their eyes, with the\nrapidity of lightening, there passed all the delightful evenings they\nhad spent together, especially that evening of Corpus Christi Day, with\nthe warm sky, the cool willows of the Viorne, and their own loving talk.\nAnd at the same time, whilst the past came back to their hearts full\nof a delightful savour, they fancied they could plunge into the unknown\nfuture, see their dreams realised, and march through life arm in\narm--even as they had just been doing on the highway--warmly wrapped in\nthe same cloak. Then rapture came to them again, and they smiled in each\nother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, alone amidst all the silent radiance.\n\nSuddenly, however, Silvere raised his head and, throwing off the cloak,\nlistened attentively. Miette, in her surprise, imitated him, at a loss\nto understand why he had started so abruptly from her side.\n\nConfused sounds had for a moment been coming from behind the hills\nin the midst of which the Nice road wends its way. They suggested the\ndistant jolting of a procession of carts; but not distinctly, so loud\nwas the roaring of the Viorne. Gradually, however, they became more\npronounced, and rose at last like the tramping of an army on the march.\nThen amidst the continuous growing rumble one detected the shouts of a\ncrowd, strange rhythmical blasts as of a hurricane. One could even have\nfancied they were the thunderclaps of a rapidly approaching storm which\nwas already disturbing the slumbering atmosphere. Silvere listened\nattentively, unable to tell, however, what were those tempest-like\nshouts, for the hills prevented them from reaching him distinctly.\nSuddenly a dark mass appeared at the turn of the road, and then the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarseillaise\u00e2\u0080\u009d burst forth, formidable, sung as with avenging fury.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, here they are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Silvere, with a burst of joyous enthusiasm.\n\nForthwith he began to run up the hill, dragging Miette with him. On the\nleft of the road was an embankment planted with evergreen oaks, up which\nhe clambered with the young girl, to avoid being carried away by the\nsurging, howling multitude.\n\nWhen he had reached the top of the bank and the shadow of the brushwood,\nMiette, rather pale, gazed sorrowfully at those men whose distant song\nhad sufficed to draw Silvere from her embrace. It seemed as if the\nwhole band had thrust itself between them. They had been so happy a few\nminutes before, locked in each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms, alone and lost amidst the\noverwhelming silence and discreet glimmer of the moon! And now Silvere,\nwhose head was turned away from her, who no longer seemed even conscious\nof her presence, had eyes only for those strangers whom he called his\nbrothers.\n\nThe band descended the slope with a superb, irresistible stride. There\ncould have been nothing grander than the irruption of those few thousand\nmen into that cold, still, deathly scene. The highway became a torrent,\nrolling with living waves which seemed inexhaustible. At the bend in the\nroad fresh masses ever appeared, whose songs ever helped to swell the\nroar of this human tempest. When the last battalions came in sight the\nuproar was deafening. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarseillaise\u00e2\u0080\u009d filled the atmosphere as\nif blown through enormous trumpets by giant mouths, which cast it,\nvibrating with a brazen clang, into every corner of the valley. The\nslumbering country-side awoke with a start--quivering like a beaten drum\nresonant to its very entrails, and repeating with each and every echo\nthe passionate notes of the national song. And then the singing was\nno longer confined to the men. From the very horizon, from the distant\nrocks, the ploughed land, the meadows, the copses, the smallest bits\nof brushwood, human voices seemed to come. The great amphitheatre,\nextending from the river to Plassans, the gigantic cascade over which\nthe bluish moonlight flowed, was as if filled with innumerable invisible\npeople cheering the insurgents; and in the depths of the Viorne, along\nthe waters streaked with mysterious metallic reflections, there was not\na dark nook but seemed to conceal human beings, who took up each refrain\nwith yet greater passion. With air and earth alike quivering, the whole\ncountry-side cried for vengeance and liberty. So long as the little army\nwas descending the slope, the roar of the populace thus rolled on in\nsonorous waves broken by abrupt outbursts which shook the very stones in\nthe roadway.\n\nSilvere, pale with emotion, still listened and looked on. The insurgents\nwho led the van of that swarming, roaring stream, so vague and monstrous\nin the darkness, were rapidly approaching the bridge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured Miette, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you would not pass through\nPlassans?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey must have altered the plan of operations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\nwere, in fact, to have marched to the chief town by the Toulon road,\npassing to the left of Plassans and Orcheres. They must have left\nAlboise this afternoon and passed Les Tulettes this evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe head of the column had already arrived in front of the young people.\nThe little army was more orderly than one would have expected from a\nband of undisciplined men. The contingents from the various towns and\nvillages formed separate battalions, each separated by a distance of a\nfew paces. These battalions were apparently under the orders of certain\nchiefs. For the nonce the pace at which they were descending the\nhillside made them a compact mass of invincible strength. There were\nprobably about three thousand men, all united and carried away by the\nsame storm of indignation. The strange details of the scene were not\ndiscernible amidst the shadows cast over the highway by the lofty\nslopes. At five or six feet from the brushwood, however, where Miette\nand Silvere were sheltered, the left-hand embankment gave place to\na little pathway which ran alongside the Viorne; and the moonlight,\nflowing through this gap, cast a broad band of radiance across the road.\nWhen the first insurgents reached this patch of light they were\nsuddenly illumined by a sharp white glow which revealed, with singular\ndistinctness, every outline of visage or costume. And as the various\ncontingents swept on, the young people thus saw them emerge, fiercely\nand without cessation, from the surrounding darkness.\n\nAs the first men passed through the light Miette instinctively clung\nto Silvere, although she knew she was safe, even from observation. She\npassed her arm round the young fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck, resting her head against\nhis shoulder. And with the hood of her pelisse encircling her pale\nface she gazed fixedly at that square patch of light as it was rapidly\ntraversed by those strange faces, transfigured by enthusiasm, with dark\nopen mouths full of the furious cry of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarseillaise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere,\nwhom she felt quivering at her side, then bent towards her and named the\nvarious contingents as they passed.\n\nThe column marched along eight abreast. In the van were a number of big,\nsquare-headed fellows, who seemed to possess the herculean strength and\nna\u00c3\u00afve confidence of giants. They would doubtless prove blind, intrepid\ndefenders of the Republic. On their shoulders they carried large axes,\nwhose edges, freshly sharpened, glittered in the moonlight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose are the woodcutters of the forests of the Seille,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Silvere.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have been formed into a corps of sappers. At a signal from their\nleaders they would march as far as Paris, battering down the gates of\nthe towns with their axes, just as they cut down the old cork-trees on\nthe mountain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young man spoke with pride of the heavy fists of his brethren. And\non seeing a band of labourers and rough-bearded men, tanned by the\nsun, coming along behind the woodcutters, he continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the\ncontingent from La Palud. That was the first place to rise. The men in\nblouses are labourers who cut up the cork-trees; the others in velveteen\njackets must be sportsmen, poachers, and charcoal-burners living in the\npasses of the Seille. The poachers knew your father, Miette. They have\ngood firearms, which they handle skilfully. Ah! if all were armed in the\nsame manner! We are short of muskets. See, the labourers have only got\ncudgels!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiette, still speechless, looked on and listened. As Silvere spoke to\nher of her father, the blood surged to her cheeks. Her face burnt as she\nscrutinised the sportsmen with a strange air of mingled indignation and\nsympathy. From this moment she grew animated, yielding to the feverish\nquiver which the insurgents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 songs awakened.\n\nThe column, which had just begun the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarseillaise\u00e2\u0080\u009d afresh, was still\nmarching down as though lashed on by the sharp blasts of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMistral.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n The men of La Palud were followed by another troop of workmen, among\nwhom a goodly number of middle class folks in great-coats were to be\nseen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose are the men of Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere resumed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\n_bourg_ rose almost at the same time as La Palud. The masters joined the\nworkmen. There are some rich men there, Miette; men whose wealth would\nenable them to live peacefully at home, but who prefer to risk their\nlives in defence of liberty. One can but admire them. Weapons are very\nscarce, however; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve scarcely got a few fowling-pieces. But do you\nsee those men yonder, Miette, with red bands round their left elbows?\nThey are the leaders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe contingents descended the hill more rapidly than Silvere could\nspeak. While he was naming the men from Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx, two\nbattalions had already crossed the ray of light which blanched the\nroadway.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you see the insurgents from Alboise and Les Tulettes pass by just\nnow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI recognised Burgat the blacksmith. They must have\njoined the band to-day. How they do run!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiette was now leaning forward, in order to see more of the little bands\ndescribed to her by the young man. The quiver she felt rose from her\nbosom to her throat. Then a battalion larger and better disciplined than\nthe others appeared. The insurgents composing it were nearly all dressed\nin blue blouses, with red sashes round their waists. One would have\nthought they were arrayed in uniform. A man on horseback, with a sabre\nat his side, was in the midst of them. And most of these improvised\nsoldiers carried guns, probably carbines and old muskets of the National\nGuard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know those,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Silvere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe man on horseback must be the\nchief I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard spoken of. He brought with him the contingents from\nFaverolles and the neighbouring villages. The whole column ought to be\nequipped in the same manner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had no time to take breath. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! see, here are the country people!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he suddenly cried.\n\nSmall groups of ten or twenty men at the most were now advancing behind\nthe men of Faverolles. They all wore the short jacket of the Southern\npeasantry, and as they sang they brandished pitchforks and scythes. Some\nof them even only carried large navvies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shovels. Every hamlet, however,\nhad sent its able-bodied men.\n\nSilvere, who recognised the parties by their leaders, enumerated them in\nfeverish tones. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe contingent from Chavanoz!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are\nonly eight men, but they are strong; Uncle Antoine knows them. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nNazeres! Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Poujols! They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all here; not one has failed to answer\nthe summons. Valqueyras! Hold, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the parson amongst them; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nheard about him, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a staunch Republican.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was becoming intoxicated with the spectacle. Now that each battalion\nconsisted of only a few insurgents he had to name them yet more hastily,\nand his precipitancy gave him the appearance of one in a frenzy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! Miette,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat a fine march past! Rozan! Vernoux!\nCorbiere! And there are more still, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see. These have only got\nscythes, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll mow down the troops as close as the grass in their\nmeadows--Saint-Eutrope! Mazet! Les Gardes, Marsanne! The whole north\nside of the Seille! Ah, we shall be victorious! The whole country is\nwith us. Look at those men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms, they are hard and black as iron.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no end to them. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pruinas! Roches Noires! Those last\nare smugglers: they are carrying carbines. Still more scythes and\npitchforks, the contingents of country folk are still passing.\nCastel-le-Vieux! Sainte-Anne! Graille! Estourmel! Murdaran!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis voice was husky with emotion as he finished naming these men, who\nseemed to be borne away by a whirlwind as fast as he enumerated them.\nErect, with glowing countenance, he pointed out the several contingents\nwith a nervous gesture. Miette followed his movements. The road below\nattracted her like the depths of a precipice. To avoid slipping down\nthe incline she clung to the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck. A strange intoxication\nemanated from those men, who themselves were inebriated with clamour,\ncourage, and confidence. Those beings, seen athwart a moonbeam, those\nyouths and those men in their prime, those old people brandishing\nstrange weapons and dressed in the most diverse costumes, from working\nsmock to middle class overcoat, those endless rows of heads, which\nthe hour and the circumstances endowed with an expression of fanatical\nenergy and enthusiasm, gradually appeared to the girl like a whirling,\nimpetuous torrent. At certain moments she fancied they were not of\nthemselves moving, that they were really being carried away by the force\nof the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarseillaise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d by that hoarse, sonorous chant. She could not\ndistinguish any conversation, she heard but a continuous volume of\nsound, alternating from bass to shrill notes, as piercing as nails\ndriven into one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flesh. This roar of revolt, this call to combat,\nto death, with its outbursts of indignation, its burning thirst for\nliberty, its remarkable blending of bloodthirsty and sublime impulses,\nunceasingly smote her heart, penetrating more deeply at each fierce\noutburst, and filling her with the voluptuous pangs of a virgin martyr\nwho stands erect and smiles under the lash. And the crowd flowed on ever\namidst the same sonorous wave of sound. The march past, which did not\nreally last more than a few minutes, seemed to the young people to be\ninterminable.\n\nTruly, Miette was but a child. She had turned pale at the approach of\nthe band, she had wept for the loss of love, but she was a brave child,\nwhose ardent nature was easily fired by enthusiasm. Thus ardent emotions\nhad gradually got possession of her, and she became as courageous as\na youth. She would willingly have seized a weapon and followed the\ninsurgents. As the muskets and scythes filed past, her white teeth\nglistened longer and sharper between her red lips, like the fangs of\na young wolf eager to bite and tear. And as she listened to Silvere\nenumerating the contingents from the country-side with ever-increasing\nhaste, the pace of the column seemed to her to accelerate still more.\nShe soon fancied it all a cloud of human dust swept along by a tempest.\nEverything began to whirl before her. Then she closed her eyes; big hot\ntears were rolling down her cheeks.\n\nSilvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyelashes were also moist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the men who left\nPlassans this afternoon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured.\n\nHe tried to distinguish the end of the column, which was still hidden by\nthe darkness. Suddenly he cried with joyous exultation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, here they\nare! They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the banner--the banner has been entrusted to them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he wanted to leap from the slope in order to join his companions.\nAt this moment, however, the insurgents halted. Words of command ran\nalong the column, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarseillaise\u00e2\u0080\u009d died out in a final rumble, and\none could only hear the confused murmuring of the still surging crowd.\nSilvere, as he listened, caught the orders which were passed on from one\ncontingent to another; they called the men of Plassans to the van. Then,\nas each battalion ranged itself alongside the road to make way for the\nbanner, the young man reascended the embankment, dragging Miette with\nhim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe can get across the river before they do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen they were on the top, among the ploughed land, they ran along to a\nmill whose lock bars the river. Then they crossed the Viorne on a\nplank placed there by the millers, and cut across the meadows of\nSainte-Claire, running hand-in-hand, without exchanging a word. The\ncolumn threw a dark line over the highway, which they followed alongside\nthe hedges. There were some gaps in the hawthorns, and at last Silvere\nand Miette sprang on to the road through one of them.\n\nIn spite of the circuitous way they had come, they arrived at the same\ntime as the men of Plassans. Silvere shook hands with some of them. They\nmust have thought he had heard of the new route they had chosen, and had\ncome to meet them. Miette, whose face was half-concealed by her hood,\nwas scrutinised rather inquisitively.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chantegreil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d at last said one of the men from the Faubourg\nof Plassans, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe niece of Rebufat, the _meger_[*] of the Jas-Meiffren.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n     [*] A _meger_ is a farmer in Provence who shares the\n     expenses and profits of his farm with the owner of the land.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere have you sprung from, gadabout?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried another voice.\n\nSilvere, intoxicated with enthusiasm, had not thought of the distress\nwhich his sweetheart would feel at the jeers of the workmen. Miette, all\nconfusion, looked at him as if to implore his aid. But before he\ncould even open his lips another voice rose from the crowd, brutally\nexclaiming:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the galleys; we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the daughter of a thief and\nmurderer amongst us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this Miette turned dreadfully pale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou lie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she muttered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf my father did kill anybody, he never\nthieved!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as Silvere, pale and trembling more than she, began to clench his\nfists: \u00e2\u0080\u009cStop!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is my affair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, turning to the men, she repeated with a shout: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou lie! You lie!\nHe never stole a copper from anybody. You know it well enough. Why do\nyou insult him when he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe drew herself up, superb with indignation. With her ardent, half-wild\nnature she seemed to accept the charge of murder composedly enough, but\nthat of theft exasperated her. They knew it, and that was why folks,\nfrom stupid malice, often cast the accusation in her face.\n\nThe man who had just called her father a thief was merely repeating\nwhat he had heard said for many years. The girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defiant attitude\nonly incited the workmen to jeer the more. Silvere still had his fists\nclenched, and matters might have become serious if a poacher from\nthe Seille, who had been sitting on a heap of stones at the roadside\nawaiting the order to march, had not come to the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assistance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe little one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChantegreil was one of us. I knew\nhim. Nobody knows the real facts of his little matter. I always believed\nin the truth of his deposition before the judge. The gendarme whom he\nbrought down with a bullet, while he was out shooting, was no doubt\ntaking aim at him at the time. A man must defend himself! At all events\nChantegreil was a decent fellow; he committed no robbery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs often happens in such cases, the testimony of this poacher sufficed\nto bring other defenders to Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aid. Several workmen also professed\nto have known Chantegreil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true!\u00e2\u0080\u009d they all said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a thief. There are\nsome scoundrels at Plassans who ought to be sent to prison in his place.\nChantegreil was our brother. Come, now, be calm, little one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiette had never before heard anyone speak well of her father. He was\ngenerally referred to as a beggar, a villain, and now she found good\nfellows who had forgiving words for him, and declared him to be an\nhonest man. She burst into tears, again full of the emotion awakened in\nher by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarseillaise;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and she bethought herself how she might thank\nthese men for their kindness to her in misfortune. For a moment she\nconceived the idea of shaking them all by the hand like a man. But her\nheart suggested something better. By her side stood the insurgent\nwho carried the banner. She touched the staff, and, to express her\ngratitude, said in an entreating tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive it to me; I will carry it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe simple-minded workmen understood the ingenuous sublimity of this\nform of gratitude.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they all cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cChantegreil shall carry the banner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever, a woodcutter remarked that she would soon get tired, and would\nnot be able to go far.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m quite strong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she retorted proudly, tucking up her sleeves and\nshowing a pair of arms as big as those of a grown woman. Then as they\nhanded her the flag she resumed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait just a moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nForthwith she pulled off her cloak, and put it on again after turning\nthe red lining outside. In the clear moonlight she appeared to be\narrayed in a purple mantle reaching to her feet. The hood resting on the\nedge of her chignon formed a kind of Phrygian cap. She took the flag,\npressed the staff to her bosom, and held herself upright amid the folds\nof that blood-coloured banner which waved behind her. Enthusiastic child\nthat she was, her countenance, with its curly hair, large eyes moist\nwith tears, and lips parted in a smile, seemed to rise with energetic\npride as she turned it towards the sky. At that moment she was the\nvirgin Liberty.\n\nThe insurgents burst into applause. The vivid imagination of those\nSoutherners was fired with enthusiasm at the sudden apparition of this\ngirl so nervously clasping their banner to her bosom. Shouts rose from\nthe nearest group:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBravo, Chantegreil! Chantegreil for ever! She shall remain with us;\nshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bring us luck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey would have cheered her for a long time yet had not the order to\nresume the march arrived. Whilst the column moved on, Miette pressed\nSilvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand and whispered in his ear: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou hear! I shall remain with\nyou. Are you glad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere, without replying, returned the pressure. He consented. In fact,\nhe was deeply affected, unable to resist the enthusiasm which fired his\ncompanions. Miette seemed to him so lovely, so grand, so saintly! During\nthe whole climb up the hill he still saw her before him, radiant, amidst\na purple glory. She was now blended with his other adored mistress--the\nRepublic. He would have liked to be in action already, with his gun on\nhis shoulder. But the insurgents moved slowly. They had orders to make\nas little noise as possible. Thus the column advanced between the\nrows of elms like some gigantic serpent whose every ring had a strange\nquivering. The frosty December night had again sunk into silence, and\nthe Viorne alone seemed to roar more loudly.\n\nOn reaching the first houses of the Faubourg, Silvere ran on in front to\nfetch his gun from the Aire Saint-Mittre, which he found slumbering in\nthe moonlight. When he again joined the insurgents they had reached\nthe Porte de Rome. Miette bent towards him, and with her childish smile\nobserved: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel as if I were at the procession on Corpus Christi Day\ncarrying the banner of the Virgin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nPlassans is a sub-prefecture with about ten thousand inhabitants. Built\non a plateau overlooking the Viorne, and resting on the north side\nagainst the Garrigues hills, one of the last spurs of the Alps, the\ntown is situated, as it were, in the depths of a cul-de-sac. In 1851\nit communicated with the adjoining country by two roads only, the Nice\nroad, which runs down to the east, and the Lyons road, which rises to\nthe west, the one continuing the other on almost parallel lines. Since\nthat time a railway has been built which passes to the south of the\ntown, below the hill which descends steeply from the old ramparts to\nthe river. At the present day, on coming out of the station on the right\nbank of the little torrent, one can see, by raising one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, the\nfirst houses of Plassans, with their gardens disposed in terrace\nfashion. It is, however, only after an uphill walk lasting a full\nquarter of an hour that one reaches these houses.\n\nAbout twenty years ago, owing, no doubt, to deficient means of\ncommunication, there was no town that had more completely retained the\npious and aristocratic character of the old Provencal cities. Plassans\nthen had, and has even now, a whole district of large mansions built\nin the reigns of Louis XIV. and Louis XV., a dozen churches, Jesuit\nand Capuchin houses, and a considerable number of convents. Class\ndistinctions were long perpetuated by the town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s division into various\ndistricts. There were three of them, each forming, as it were, a\nseparate and complete locality, with its own churches, promenades,\ncustoms, and landscapes.\n\nThe district of the nobility, called Saint-Marc, after the name of one\nof its parish churches, is a sort of miniature Versailles, with straight\nstreets overgrown with grass, and large square houses which conceal\nextensive gardens. It extends to the south along the edge of the\nplateau. Some of the mansions built on the declivity itself have a\ndouble row of terraces whence one can see the whole valley of the\nViorne, a most charming vista much vaunted in that part of the country.\nThen on the north-west, the old quarter, formed of the original town,\nrears its narrow, tortuous lanes bordered with tottering hovels. The\nTown-Hall, the Civil Court, the Market, and the Gendarmerie barracks\nare situated here. This, the most populous part of the Plassans, is\ninhabited by working-men and shop-keepers, all the wretched, toiling,\ncommon folk. The new town forms a sort of parallelogram to the\nnorth-east; the well-to-do, those who have slowly amassed a fortune, and\nthose engaged in the liberal professions, here occupy houses set out\nin straight lines and coloured a light yellow. This district, which is\nembellished by the Sub-Prefecture, an ugly plaster building decorated\nwith rose-mouldings, numbered scarcely five or six streets in 1851; it\nis of quite recent formation, and it is only since the construction of\nthe railway that it has been growing in extent.\n\nOne circumstance which even at the present time tends to divide\nPlassans into three distinct independent parts is that the limits of the\ndistricts are clearly defined by the principal thoroughfares. The Cours\nSauvaire and the Rue de Rome, which is, as it were, a narrow extension\nof the former, run from west to east, from the Grand\u00e2\u0080\u0099-Porte to the\nPorte de Rome, thus cutting the town into two portions, and dividing\nthe quarter of the nobility from the others. The latter are themselves\nparted by the Rue de la Banne. This street, the finest in the locality,\nstarts from the extremity of the Cours Sauvaire, and ascends northwards,\nleaving the black masses of the old quarter on its left, and the\nlight-yellow houses of the new town on its right. It is here, about\nhalf-way along the street, that stands the Sub-Prefecture, in the rear\nof a small square planted with sickly trees; the people of Plassans are\nvery proud of this edifice.\n\nAs if to keep more isolated and shut up within itself, the town is\nbelted with old ramparts, which only serve to increase its gloom and\nrender it more confined. These ridiculous fortifications, preyed upon by\nivy and crowned with wild gillyflowers, are about as high and as thick\nas the walls of a convent, and could be demolished by gunshot. They\nhave several openings, the principal of which, the Porte de Rome and the\nGrand\u00e2\u0080\u0099-Porte, afford access to the Nice road and the Lyons road, at the\nother end of town. Until 1853 these openings were furnished with huge\nwooden two-leaved gates, arched at the top, and strengthened with bars\nof iron. These gates were double-locked at eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in summer, and\nten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in winter. The town having thus shot its bolts like a timid\ngirl, went quietly to sleep. A keeper, who lived in a little cell in one\nof the inner corners of each gateway, was authorised to admit belated\npersons. But it was necessary to stand parleying a long time. The keeper\nwould not let people in until, by the light of his lantern, he had\ncarefully scrutinised their faces through a peep-hole. If their looks\ndispleased him they had to sleep outside. This custom of locking the\ngates every evening was highly characteristic of the spirit of the town,\nwhich was a commingling of cowardice, egotism, routine, exclusiveness,\nand devout longing for a cloistered life. Plassans, when it had shut\nitself up, would say to itself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am at home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with the satisfaction\nof some pious bourgeois, who, assured of the safety of his cash-box,\nand certain that no noise will disturb him, duly says his prayers and\nretires gladly to bed. No other town, I believe, has so long persisted\nin thus incarcerating itself like a nun.\n\nThe population of Plassans is divided into three groups, corresponding\nwith the same number of districts. Putting aside the functionaries--the\nsub-prefect, the receiver of taxes, the mortgage commissioner, and\nthe postmaster, who are all strangers to the locality, where they are\nobjects of envy rather than of esteem, and who live after their own\nfashion--the real inhabitants, those who were born there and have\nevery intention of ending their days there, feel too much respect for\ntraditional usages and established boundaries not to pen themselves of\ntheir own accord in one or other of the town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social divisions.\n\nThe nobility virtually cloister themselves. Since the fall of Charles X.\nthey scarcely ever go out, and when they do they are eager to return\nto their large dismal mansions, and walk along furtively as though they\nwere in a hostile country. They do not visit anyone, nor do they even\nreceive each other. Their drawing-rooms are frequented by a few priests\nonly. They spend the summer in the chateaux which they possess in the\nenvirons; in the winter, they sit round their firesides. They are, as\nit were, dead people weary of life. And thus the gloomy silence of a\ncemetery hangs over their quarter of the town. The doors and windows\nare carefully barricaded; one would think their mansions were so many\nconvents shut off from all the tumult of the world. At rare intervals\nan abbe, whose measured tread adds to the gloomy silence of these sealed\nhouses, passes by and glides like a shadow through some half-opened\ndoorway.\n\nThe well-to-do people, the retired tradesmen, the lawyers and notaries,\nall those of the little easy-going, ambitious world that inhabits the\nnew town, endeavour to infuse some liveliness into Plassans. They go\nto the parties given by the sub-prefect, and dream of giving similar\nentertainments. They eagerly seek popularity, call a workman \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy good\nfellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d chat with the peasants about the harvest, read the papers, and\nwalk out with their wives on Sundays. Theirs are the enlightened\nminds of the district, they are the only persons who venture to speak\ndisparagingly of the ramparts; in fact, they have several times demanded\nof the authorities the demolition of those old walls, relics of a former\nage. At the same time, the most sceptical among them experience a shock\nof delight whenever a marquis or a count deigns to honour them with a\nstiff salutation. Indeed, the dream of every citizen of the new town is\nto be admitted to a drawing-room of the Saint-Marc quarter. They know\nvery well that their ambition is not attainable, and it is this which\nmakes them proclaim all the louder that they are freethinkers. But they\nare freethinkers in words only; firm friends of the authorities, they\nare ready to rush into the arms of the first deliverer at the slightest\nindication of popular discontent.\n\nThe group which toils and vegetates in the old quarter is not so clearly\ndefined as the others. The labouring classes are here in a majority; but\nretail dealers and even a few wholesale traders are to be found among\nthem. As a matter of fact, Plassans is far from being a commercial\ncentre; there is only just sufficient trade to dispose of the products\nof the country--oil, wine, and almonds. As for industrial labour, it is\nrepresented almost entirely by three or four evil-smelling tanyards,\na felt hat manufactory, and some soap-boiling works, which last are\nrelegated to a corner of the Faubourg. This little commercial and\nindustrial world, though it may on high days and holidays visit the\npeople of the new district, generally takes up its quarters among the\noperatives of the old town. Merchants, retail traders, and artisans have\ncommon interests which unite them together. On Sundays only, the masters\nmake themselves spruce and foregather apart. On the other hand, the\nlabouring classes, which constitute scarcely a fifth of the population,\nmingle with the idlers of the district.\n\nIt is only once a week, and during the fine weather, that the three\ndistricts of Plassans come together face to face. The whole town repairs\nto the Cours Sauvaire on Sunday after vespers; even the nobility venture\nthither. Three distinct currents flow along this sort of boulevard\nplanted with rows of plane-trees. The well-to-do citizens of the new\nquarter merely pass along before quitting the town by the Grand\u00e2\u0080\u0099-Porte\nand taking the Avenue du Mail on the right, where they walk up and down\ntill nightfall. Meantime, the nobility and the lower classes share the\nCours Sauvaire between them. For more than a century past the nobility\nhave selected the walk on the south side, which is bordered with large\nmansions, and is the first to escape the heat of the sun; the lower\nclasses have to rest content with the walk on the north, where the\ncafes, inns, and tobacconists\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shops are located. The people and the\nnobility promenade the whole afternoon, walking up and down the Cours\nwithout anyone of either party thinking of changing sides. They are only\nseparated by a distance of some seven or eight yards, yet it is as if\nthey were a thousand leagues away from each other, for they scrupulously\nfollow those two parallel lines, as though they must not come in contact\nhere below. Even during the revolutionary periods each party kept to\nits own side. This regulation walk on Sunday and the locking of the town\ngates in the evening are analogous instances which suffice to indicate\nthe character of the ten thousand people inhabiting the town.\n\nHere, amidst these surroundings, until the year 1848, there vegetated\nan obscure family that enjoyed little esteem, but whose head, Pierre\nRougon, subsequently played an important part in life owing to certain\ncircumstances.\n\nPierre Rougon was the son of a peasant. His mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, the\nFouques, owned, towards the end of the last century, a large plot of\nground in the Faubourg, behind the old cemetery of Saint-Mittre; this\nground was subsequently joined to the Jas-Meiffren. The Fouques were the\nrichest market-gardeners in that part of the country; they supplied an\nentire district of Plassans with vegetables. However, their name\ndied out a few years before the Revolution. Only one girl, Adelaide,\nremained; born in 1768, she had become an orphan at the age of eighteen.\nThis girl, whose father had died insane, was a long, lank, pale\ncreature, with a scared look and strange ways which one might have taken\nfor shyness so long as she was a little girl. As she grew up,\nhowever, she became still stranger; she did certain things which were\ninexplicable even to the cleverest folk of the Faubourg, and from that\ntime it was rumoured that she was cracked like her father.\n\nShe had scarcely been an orphan six months, in possession of a fortune\nwhich rendered her an eagerly sought heiress, when it transpired that\nshe had married a young gardener named Rougon, a rough-hewn peasant from\nthe Basses-Alpes. This Rougon, after the death of the last of the male\nFouques, who had engaged him for a term, had remained in the service\nof the deceased\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter. From the situation of salaried servant he\nascended rapidly to the enviable position of husband. This marriage was\na first shock to public opinion. No one could comprehend why Adelaide\npreferred this poor fellow, coarse, heavy, vulgar, scarce able to speak\nFrench, to those other young men, sons of well-to-do farmers, who had\nbeen seen hovering round her for some time. And, as provincial people do\nnot allow anything to remain unexplained, they made sure there was some\nmystery at the bottom of this affair, alleging even that the marriage of\nthe two young people had become an absolute necessity. But events proved\nthe falsity of the accusation. More than a year went by before Adelaide\nhad a son. The Faubourg was annoyed; it could not admit that it was\nwrong, and determined to penetrate the supposed mystery; accordingly all\nthe gossips kept a watch upon the Rougons. They soon found ample matter\nfor tittle-tattle. Rougon died almost suddenly, fifteen months after his\nmarriage, from a sunstroke received one afternoon while he was weeding a\nbed of carrots.\n\nScarcely a year then elapsed before the young widow caused unheard-of\nscandal. It became known, as an indisputable fact, that she had a lover.\nShe did not appear to make any secret of it; several persons asserted\nthat they had heard her use endearing terms in public to poor Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsuccessor. Scarcely a year of widowhood and a lover already! Such a\ndisregard of propriety seemed monstrous out of all reason. And the\nscandal was heightened by Adelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strange choice. At that time there\ndwelt at the end of the Impasse Saint-Mittre, in a hovel the back\nof which abutted on the Fouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 land, a man of bad repute, who was\ngenerally referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat scoundrel Macquart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This man would\nvanish for weeks and then turn up some fine evening, sauntering about\nwith his hands in his pockets and whistling as though he had just\ncome from a short walk. And the women sitting at their doorsteps as he\npassed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that scoundrel Macquart! He has hidden his bales and\nhis gun in some hollow of the Viorne.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The truth was, Macquart had\nno means, and yet ate and drank like a happy drone during his short\nsojourns in the town. He drank copiously and with fierce obstinacy.\nSeating himself alone at a table in some tavern, he would linger there\nevening after evening, with his eyes stupidly fixed on his glass,\nneither seeing nor hearing anything around him. When the landlord closed\nhis establishment, he would retire with a firm step, with his head\nraised, as if he were kept yet more erect by inebriation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMacquart\nwalks so straight, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surely dead drunk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d people used to say, as they\nsaw him going home. Usually, when he had had no drink, he walked with\na slight stoop and shunned the gaze of curious people with a kind of\nsavage shyness.\n\nSince the death of his father, a journeyman tanner who had left him as\nsole heritage the hovel in the Impasse Saint-Mittre, he had never\nbeen known to have either relatives or friends. The proximity of the\nfrontiers and the neighbouring forests of the Seille had turned this\nsingular, lazy fellow into a combination of smuggler and poacher, one\nof those suspicious-looking characters of whom passers-by observe: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nshouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care to meet that man at midnight in a dark wood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tall, with\na formidable beard and lean face, Macquart was the terror of the\ngood women of the Faubourg of Plassans; they actually accused him of\ndevouring little children raw. Though he was hardly thirty years old,\nhe looked fifty. Amidst his bushy beard and the locks of hair which hung\nover his face in poodle fashion, one could only distinguish the gleam\nof his brown eyes, the furtive sorrowful glance of a man of vagrant\ninstincts, rendered vicious by wine and a pariah life. Although no\ncrimes had actually been brought home to him, no theft or murder was\never perpetrated in the district without suspicion at once falling upon\nhim.\n\nAnd it was this ogre, this brigand, this scoundrel Macquart, whom\nAdelaide had chosen! In twenty months she had two children by him, first\na boy and then a girl. There was no question of marriage between\nthem. Never had the Faubourg beheld such audacious impropriety. The\nstupefaction was so great, the idea of Macquart having found a young and\nwealthy mistress so completely upset the gossips, that they even spoke\ngently of Adelaide. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor thing! She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone quite mad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they would say.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she had any relatives she would have been placed in confinement long\nago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as they never knew anything of the history of those strange\namours, they accused that rogue Macquart of having taken advantage of\nAdelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weak mind to rob her of her money.\n\nThe legitimate son, little Pierre Rougon, grew up with his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nother offspring. The latter, Antoine and Ursule, the young wolves as\nthey were called in the district, were kept at home by Adelaide, who\ntreated them as affectionately as her first child. She did not appear to\nentertain a very clear idea of the position in life reserved for these\ntwo poor creatures. To her they were the same in every respect as her\nfirst-born. She would sometimes go out holding Pierre with one hand and\nAntoine with the other, never noticing how differently the two little\nfellows were already regarded.\n\nIt was a strange home. For nearly twenty years everyone lived there\nafter his or her fancy, the children like the mother. Everything went\non free from control. In growing to womanhood, Adelaide had retained the\nstrangeness which had been taken for shyness when she was fifteen. It\nwas not that she was insane, as the people of the Faubourg asserted,\nbut there was a lack of equilibrium between her nerves and her blood,\na disorder of the brain and heart which made her lead a life out of\nthe ordinary, different from that of the rest of the world. She was\ncertainly very natural, very consistent with herself; but in the eyes of\nthe neighbours her consistency became pure insanity. She seemed\ndesirous of making herself conspicuous, it was thought she was wickedly\ndetermined to turn things at home from bad to worse, whereas with great\nnaivete she simply acted according to the impulses of her nature.\n\nEver since giving birth to her first child she had been subject to\nnervous fits which brought on terrible convulsions. These fits recurred\nperiodically, every two or three months. The doctors whom she consulted\ndeclared they could do nothing for her, that age would weaken the\nseverity of the attacks. They simply prescribed a dietary regimen of\nunderdone meat and quinine wine. However, these repeated shocks led to\ncerebral disorder. She lived on from day to day like a child, like\na fawning animal yielding to its instincts. When Macquart was on his\nrounds, she passed her time in lazy, pensive idleness. All she did for\nher children was to kiss and play with them. Then as soon as her lover\nreturned she would disappear.\n\nBehind Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hovel there was a little yard, separated from the\nFouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 property by a wall. One morning the neighbours were much\nastonished to find in this wall a door which had not been there the\nprevious evening. Before an hour had elapsed, the entire Faubourg had\nflocked to the neighbouring windows. The lovers must have worked the\nwhole night to pierce the opening and place the door there. They could\nnow go freely from one house to the other. The scandal was revived,\neveryone felt less pity for Adelaide, who was certainly the disgrace\nof the suburb; she was reproached more wrathfully for that door, that\ntacit, brutal admission of her union, than even for her two illegitimate\nchildren. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople should at least study appearances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the most tolerant\nwomen would say. But Adelaide did not understand what was meant by\nstudying appearances. She was very happy, very proud of her door; she\nhad assisted Macquart to knock the stones from the wall and had even\nmixed the mortar so that the work might proceed the quicker; and she\ncame with childish delight to inspect the work by daylight on the\nmorrow--an act which was deemed a climax of shamelessness by three\ngossips who observed her contemplating the masonry. From that date,\nwhenever Macquart reappeared, it was thought, as no one then ever\nsaw the young woman, that she was living with him in the hovel of the\nImpasse Saint-Mittre.\n\nThe smuggler would come very irregularly, almost always unexpectedly,\nto Plassans. Nobody ever knew what life the lovers led during the two\nor three days he spent there at distant intervals. They used to shut\nthemselves up; the little dwelling seemed uninhabited. Then, as the\ngossips had declared that Macquart had simply seduced Adelaide in order\nto spend her money, they were astonished, after a time, to see him still\nlead his wonted life, ever up hill and down dale and as badly equipped\nas previously. Perhaps the young woman loved him all the more for\nseeing him at rare intervals, perhaps he had disregarded her entreaties,\nfeeling an irresistible desire for a life of adventure. The gossips\ninvented a thousand fables, without succeeding in giving any reasonable\nexplanation of a connection which had originated and continued in so\nstrange a manner. The hovel in the Impasse Saint-Mittre remained closed\nand preserved its secrets. It was merely guessed that Macquart had\nprobably acquired the habit of beating Adelaide, although the sound of\na quarrel never issued from the house. However, on several occasions she\nwas seen with her face black and blue, and her hair torn away. At the\nsame time, she did not display the least dejection or grief, nor did she\nseek in any way to hide her bruises. She smiled, and seemed happy. No\ndoubt she allowed herself to be beaten without breathing a word. This\nexistence lasted for more than fifteen years.\n\nAt times when Adelaide returned home she would find her house upside\ndown, but would not take the least notice of it. She was utterly\nignorant of the practical meaning of life, of the proper value of things\nand the necessity for order. She let her children grow up like those\nplum-trees which sprout along the highways at the pleasure of the rain\nand sun. They bore their natural fruits like wild stock which has never\nknown grafting or pruning. Never was nature allowed such complete sway,\nnever did such mischievous creatures grow up more freely under the sole\ninfluence of instinct. They rolled among the vegetables, passed their\ndays in the open air playing and fighting like good-for-nothing urchins.\nThey stole provisions from the house and pillaged the few fruit-trees in\nthe enclosure; they were the plundering, squalling, familiar demons of\nthis strange abode of lucid insanity. When their mother was absent\nfor days together, they would make such an uproar, and hit upon such\ndiabolical devices for annoying people, that the neighbours had to\nthreaten them with a whipping. Moreover, Adelaide did not inspire them\nwith much fear; if they were less obnoxious to other people when she was\nat home, it was because they made her their victim, shirking school\nfive or six times a week and doing everything they could to receive some\npunishment which would allow them to squall to their hearts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 content.\nBut she never beat them, nor even lost her temper; she lived on very\nwell, placidly, indolently, in a state of mental abstraction amidst all\nthe uproar. At last, indeed, this uproar became indispensable to her,\nto fill the void in her brain. She smiled complacently when she heard\nanyone say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHer children will beat her some day, and it will serve her\nright.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To all remarks, her utter indifference seemed to reply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\ndoes it matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She troubled even less about her property than about\nher children. The Fouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 enclosure, during the many years that this\nsingular existence lasted would have become a piece of waste ground\nif the young woman had not luckily entrusted the cultivation of her\nvegetables to a clever market-gardener. This man, who was to share the\nprofits with her, robbed her impudently, though she never noticed it.\nThis circumstance had its advantages, however; for, in order to steal\nthe more, the gardener drew as much as possible from the land, which in\nthe result almost doubled in value.\n\nPierre, the legitimate son, either from secret instinct or from his\nknowledge of the different manner in which he and the others were\nregarded by the neighbours, domineered over his brother and sister\nfrom an early age. In their quarrels, although he was much weaker than\nAntoine, he always got the better of the contest, beating the other with\nall the authority of a master. With regard to Ursule, a poor, puny, wan\nlittle creature, she was handled with equal roughness by both the\nboys. Indeed, until they were fifteen or sixteen, the three children\nfraternally beat each other without understanding their vague, mutual\nhatred, without realising how foreign they were to one another. It was\nonly in youth that they found themselves face to face with definite,\nself-conscious personalities.\n\nAt sixteen, Antoine was a tall fellow, a blend of Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and\nAdelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failings. Macquart, however, predominated in him, with his\nlove of vagrancy, his tendency to drunkenness, and his brutish savagery.\nAt the same time, under the influence of Adelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nervous nature, the\nvices which in the father assumed a kind of sanguinary frankness were\nin the son tinged with an artfulness full of hypocrisy and cowardice.\nAntoine resembled his mother by his total want of dignified will, by his\neffeminate voluptuous egotism, which disposed him to accept any bed of\ninfamy provided he could lounge upon it at his ease and sleep warmly in\nit. People said of him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! the brigand! He hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even the courage of\nhis villainy like Macquart; if ever he commits a murder, it will be with\npin pricks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Physically, Antoine inherited Adelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thick lips only;\nhis other features resembled those of the smuggler, but they were softer\nand more prone to change of expression.\n\nIn Ursule, on the other hand, physical and moral resemblance to the\nmother predominated. There was a mixture of certain characteristics in\nher also; but born the last, at a time when Adelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love was warmer\nthan Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, the poor little thing seemed to have received with her\nsex a deeper impress of her mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s temperament. Moreover, hers was not\na fusion of the two natures, but rather a juxtaposition, a remarkably\nclose soldering. Ursule was whimsical, and displayed at times the\nshyness, the melancholy, and the transports of a pariah; then she would\noften break out into nervous fits of laughter, and muse lazily, like\na woman unsound both in head and heart. Her eyes, which at times had\na scared expression like those of Adelaide, were as limpid as crystal,\nsimilar to those of kittens doomed to die of consumption.\n\nIn presence of those two illegitimate children Pierre seemed a stranger;\nto one who had not penetrated to the roots of his being he would have\nappeared profoundly dissimilar. Never did child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nature show a more\nequal balance of the characteristics of its parents. He was the exact\nmean between the peasant Rougon and the nervous Adelaide. Paternal\ngrossness was attenuated by the maternal influence. One found in him the\nfirst phase of that evolution of temperaments which ultimately brings\nabout the amelioration or deterioration of a race. Although he was still\na peasant, his skin was less coarse, his face less heavy, his intellect\nmore capacious and more supple. In him the defects of his father and his\nmother had advantageously reacted upon each other. If Adelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nature,\nrendered exquisitely sensitive by her rebellious nerves, had combated\nand lessened Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full-bodied ponderosity, the latter had\nsuccessfully prevented the young woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tendency to cerebral disorder\nfrom being implanted in the child. Pierre knew neither the passions nor\nthe sickly ravings of Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s young whelps. Very badly brought up,\nunruly and noisy, like all children who are not restrained during their\ninfancy, he nevertheless possessed at bottom such sense and intelligence\nas would always preserve him from perpetrating any unproductive folly.\nHis vices, his laziness, his appetite for indulgence, lacked the\ninstinctiveness which characterised Antoine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; he meant to cultivate\nand gratify them honourably and openly. In his plump person of medium\nheight, in his long pale face, in which the features derived from his\nfather had acquired some of the maternal refinement, one could already\ndetect signs of sly and crafty ambition and insatiable desire, with\nthe hardness of heart and envious hatred of a peasant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son whom his\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s means and nervous temperament had turned into a member of the\nmiddle classes.\n\nWhen, at the age of seventeen, Pierre observed and was able to\nunderstand Adelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disorders and the singular position of Antoine and\nUrsule, he seemed neither sorry nor indignant, but simply worried as to\nthe course which would best serve his own interests. He was the only\none of the three children who had pursued his studies with any industry.\nWhen a peasant begins to feel the need of instruction he most frequently\nbecomes a fierce calculator. At school Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playmates roused his\nfirst suspicions by the manner in which they treated and hooted his\nbrother. Later on he came to understand the significance of many looks\nand words. And at last he clearly saw that the house was being pillaged.\nFrom that time forward he regarded Antoine and Ursule as shameless\nparasites, mouths that were devouring his own substance. Like the people\nof the Faubourg, he thought that his mother was a fit subject for a\nlunatic asylum, and feared she would end by squandering all her money,\nif he did not take steps to prevent it. What gave him the finishing\nstroke was the dishonesty of the gardener who cultivated the land.\nAt this, in one day, the unruly child was transformed into a thrifty,\nselfish lad, hurriedly matured, as regards his instincts, by the strange\nimprovident life which he could no longer bear to see around him without\na feeling of anguish. Those vegetables, from the sale of which the\nmarket-gardener derived the largest profits, really belonged to him;\nthe wine which his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offspring drank, the bread they ate, also\nbelonged to him. The whole house, the entire fortune, was his by right;\naccording to his boorish logic, he alone, the legitimate son, was\nthe heir. And as his riches were in danger, as everybody was greedily\ngnawing at his future fortune, he sought a means of turning them all\nout--mother, brother, sister, servants--and of succeeding immediately to\nhis inheritance.\n\nThe conflict was a cruel one; the lad knew that he must first strike his\nmother. Step by step, with patient tenacity, he executed a plan whose\nevery detail he had long previously thought out. His tactics were to\nappear before Adelaide like a living reproach--not that he flew into\na passion, or upbraided her for her misconduct; but he had acquired a\ncertain manner of looking at her, without saying a word, which terrified\nher. Whenever she returned from a short sojourn in Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hovel she\ncould not turn her eyes on her son without a shudder. She felt his cold\nglances, as sharp as steel blades pierce her deeply and pitilessly. The\nsevere, taciturn demeanour of the child of the man whom she had so soon\nforgotten strangely troubled her poor disordered brain. She would fancy\nat times that Rougon had risen from the dead to punish her for her\ndissoluteness. Every week she fell into one of those nervous fits which\nwere shattering her constitution. She was left to struggle until she\nrecovered consciousness, after which she would creep about more feebly\nthan ever. She would also often sob the whole night long, holding her\nhead in her hands, and accepting the wounds that Pierre dealt her with\nresignation, as if they had been the strokes of an avenging deity. At\nother times she repudiated him; she would not acknowledge her own\nflesh and blood in that heavy-faced lad, whose calmness chilled her own\nfeverishness so painfully. She would a thousand times rather have been\nbeaten than glared at like that. Those implacable looks, which followed\nher everywhere, threw her at last into such unbearable torments that\non several occasions she determined to see her lover no more. As soon,\nhowever, as Macquart returned she forgot her vows and hastened to him.\nThe conflict with her son began afresh, silent and terrible, when she\ncame back home. At the end of a few months she fell completely under his\nsway. She stood before him like a child doubtful of her behaviour and\nfearing that she deserves a whipping. Pierre had skilfully bound her\nhand and foot, and made a very submissive servant of her, without\nopening his lips, without once entering into difficult and compromising\nexplanations.\n\nWhen the young man felt that his mother was in his power, that he could\ntreat her like a slave, he began, in his own interest, to turn her\ncerebral weakness and the foolish terror with which his glances inspired\nher to his own advantage. His first care, as soon as he was master at\nhome, was to dismiss the market-gardener and replace him by one of his\nown creatures. Then he took upon himself the supreme direction of the\nhousehold, selling, buying, and holding the cash-box. On the other hand,\nhe made no attempt to regulate Adelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions, or to correct Antoine\nand Ursule for their laziness. That mattered little to him, for he\ncounted upon getting rid of these people as soon as an opportunity\npresented itself. He contented himself with portioning out their bread\nand water. Then, having already got all the property in his own hands,\nhe awaited an event which would permit him to dispose of it as he\npleased.\n\nCircumstances proved singularly favourable. He escaped the conscription\non the ground of being a widow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eldest son. But two years later Antoine\nwas called out. His bad luck did not affect him much; he counted on his\nmother purchasing a substitute for him. Adelaide, in fact, wished to\nsave him from serving; Pierre, however, who held the money, turned a\ndeaf ear to her. His brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compulsory departure would be a lucky\nevent for him, and greatly assist the accomplishment of his plans. When\nhis mother mentioned the matter to him, he gave her such a look that\nshe did not venture to pursue it. His glance plainly signified, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you\nwish, then, to ruin me for the sake of your illegitimate offspring?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Forthwith she selfishly abandoned Antoine, for before everything else\nshe sought her own peace and quietness. Pierre, who did not like violent\nmeasures, and who rejoiced at being able to eject his brother without a\ndisturbance, then played the part of a man in despair: the year had been\na bad one, money was scarce, and to raise any he would be compelled to\nsell a portion of the land, which would be the beginning of their ruin.\nThen he pledged his word of honour to Antoine that he would buy him out\nthe following year, though he meant to do nothing of the kind. Antoine\nthen went off, duped, and half satisfied.\n\nPierre got rid of Ursule in a still more unexpected manner. A journeyman\nhatter of the Faubourg, named Mouret, conceived a real affection for the\ngirl, whom he thought as white and delicate as any young lady from the\nSaint-Marc quarter. He married her. On his part it was a love match,\nfree from all sordid motives. As for Ursule, she accepted the marriage\nin order to escape a home where her eldest brother rendered life\nintolerable. Her mother, absorbed in her own courses, and using her\nremaining energy to defend her own particular interests, regarded\nthe matter with absolute indifference. She was even glad of Ursule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndeparture from the house, hoping that Pierre, now that he had no further\ncause for dissatisfaction, would let her live in peace after her\nown fashion. No sooner had the young people been married than Mouret\nperceived that he would have to quit Plassans, if he did not wish to\nhear endless disparaging remarks about his wife and his mother-in-law.\nTaking Ursule with him, he accordingly repaired to Marseilles, where he\nworked at his trade. It should be mentioned that he had not asked\nfor one sou of dowry. When Pierre, somewhat surprised by this\ndisinterestedness, commenced to stammer out some explanations, Mouret\nclosed his mouth by saying that he preferred to earn his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bread.\nNevertheless the worthy son of the peasant remained uneasy; Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nindifference seemed to him to conceal some trap.\n\nAdelaide now remained to be disposed of. Nothing in the world would have\ninduced Pierre to live with her any longer. She was compromising him;\nit was with her that he would have liked to make a start. But he found\nhimself between two very embarrassing alternatives: to keep her, and\nthus, in a measure, share her disgrace, and bind a fetter to his feet\nwhich would arrest him in his ambitious flight; or to turn her out, with\nthe certainty of being pointed at as a bad son, which would have robbed\nhim of the reputation for good nature which he desired. Knowing that he\nwould be in want of everybody, he desired to secure an untarnished\nname throughout Plassans. There was but one method to adopt, namely, to\ninduce Adelaide to leave of her own accord. Pierre neglected nothing to\naccomplish this end. He considered his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misconduct a sufficient\nexcuse for his own hard-heartedness. He punished her as one would\nchastise a child. The tables were turned. The poor woman cowered under\nthe stick which, figuratively, was constantly held over her. She was\nscarcely forty-two years old, and already had the stammerings of\nterror, and vague, pitiful looks of an old woman in her dotage. Her son\ncontinued to stab her with his piercing glances, hoping that she would\nrun away when her courage was exhausted. The unfortunate woman suffered\nterribly from shame, restrained desire and enforced cowardice, receiving\nthe blows dealt her with passive resignation, and nevertheless returning\nto Macquart with the determination to die on the spot rather than\nsubmit. There were nights when she would have got out of bed, and thrown\nherself into the Viorne, if with her weak, nervous, nature she had not\nfelt the greatest fear of death. On several occasions she thought of\nrunning away and joining her lover on the frontier. It was only\nbecause she did not know whither to go that she remained in the house,\nsubmitting to her son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contemptuous silence and secret brutality.\nPierre divined that she would have left long ago if she had only had a\nrefuge. He was waiting an opportunity to take a little apartment for her\nsomewhere, when a fortuitous occurrence, which he had not ventured\nto anticipate, abruptly brought about the realisation of his desires.\nInformation reached the Faubourg that Macquart had just been killed on\nthe frontier by a shot from a custom-house officer, at the moment when\nhe was endeavouring to smuggle a load of Geneva watches into France. The\nstory was true. The smuggler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was not even brought home, but was\ninterred in the cemetery of a little mountain village. Adelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grief\nplunged her into stupor. Her son, who watched her curiously, did not see\nher shed a tear. Macquart had made her sole legatee. She inherited\nhis hovel in the Impasse Saint-Mittre, and his carbine, which a\nfellow-smuggler, braving the balls of the custom-house officers, loyally\nbrought back to her. On the following day she retired to the little\nhouse, hung the carbine above the mantelpiece, and lived there estranged\nfrom all the world, solitary and silent.\n\nPierre was at last sole master of the house. The Fouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 land belonged\nto him in fact, if not in law. He never thought of establishing himself\non it. It was too narrow a field for his ambition. To till the ground\nand cultivate vegetables seemed to him boorish, unworthy of his\nfaculties. He was in a hurry to divest himself of everything\nrecalling the peasant. With his nature refined by his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nervous\ntemperament, he felt an irresistible longing for the enjoyments of the\nmiddle classes. In all his calculations, therefore, he had regarded the\nsale of the Fouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 property as the final consummation. This sale, by\nplacing a round sum of money in his hands, would enable him to marry the\ndaughter of some merchant who would take him into partnership. At this\nperiod the wars of the First Empire were greatly thinning the ranks of\neligible young men. Parents were not so fastidious as previously in the\nchoice of a son-in-law. Pierre persuaded himself that money would\nsmooth all difficulties, and that the gossip of the Faubourg would be\noverlooked; he intended to pose as a victim, as an honest man suffering\nfrom a family disgrace, which he deplored, without being soiled by it or\nexcusing it.\n\nFor several months already he had cast his eyes on a certain Felicite\nPuech, the daughter of an oil-dealer. The firm of Puech & Lacamp, whose\nwarehouses were in one of the darkest lanes of the old quarter, was\nfar from prosperous. It enjoyed but doubtful credit in the market, and\npeople talked vaguely of bankruptcy. It was precisely in consequence of\nthese evil reports that Pierre turned his batteries in this direction.\nNo well-to-do trader would have given him his daughter. He meant to\nappear on the scene at the very moment when old Puech should no longer\nknow which way to turn; he would then purchase Felicite of him, and\nre-establish the credit of the house by his own energy and intelligence.\nIt was a clever expedient for ascending the first rung of the social\nladder, for raising himself above his station. Above all things, he\nwished to escape from that frightful Faubourg where everybody reviled\nhis family, and to obliterate all these foul legends, by effacing even\nthe very name of the Fouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 enclosure. For that reason the filthy\nstreets of the old quarter seemed to him perfect paradise. There, only,\nhe would be able to change his skin.\n\nThe moment which he had been awaiting soon arrived. The firm of Puech\nand Lacamp seemed to be at the last gasp. The young man then negotiated\nthe match with prudent skill. He was received, if not as a deliverer, at\nleast as a necessary and acceptable expedient. The marriage agreed upon,\nhe turned his attention to the sale of the ground. The owner of the\nJas-Meiffren, desiring to enlarge his estate, had made him repeated\noffers. A low, thin, party-wall alone separated the two estates. Pierre\nspeculated on the eagerness of his wealthy neighbour, who, to gratify\nhis caprice, offered as much as fifty thousand francs for the land. It\nwas double its value. Pierre, whoever, with the craftiness of a peasant,\npulled a long face, and said that he did not care to sell; that his\nmother would never consent to get rid of the property where the Fouques\nhad lived from father to son for nearly two centuries. But all the time\nthat he was seemingly holding back he was really making preparations for\nthe sale. Certain doubts had arisen in his mind. According to his own\nbrutal logic, the property belonged to him; he had the right to dispose\nof it as he chose. Beneath this assurance, however, he had vague\npresentiments of legal complications. So he indirectly consulted a\nlawyer of the Faubourg.\n\nHe learnt some fine things from him. According to the lawyer, his hands\nwere completely tied. His mother alone could alienate the property, and\nhe doubted whether she would. But what he did not know, what came as a\nheavy blow to him, was that Ursule and Antoine, those young wolves,\nhad claims on the estate. What! they would despoil him, rob him, the\nlegitimate child! The lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explanations were clear and precise,\nhowever; Adelaide, it is true, had married Rougon under the common\nproperty system; but as the whole fortune consisted of land, the young\nwoman, according to law, again came into possession of everything at her\nhusband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. Moreover, Macquart and Adelaide had duly acknowledged\ntheir children when declaring their birth for registration, and thus\nthese children were entitled to inherit from their mother. For\nsole consolation, Pierre learnt that the law reduced the share of\nillegitimate children in favour of the others. This, however, did not\nconsole him at all. He wanted to have everything. He would not have\nshared ten sous with Ursule and Antoine.\n\nThis vista of the intricacies of the Code opened up a new horizon, which\nhe scanned with a singularly thoughtful air. He soon recognised that\na shrewd man must always keep the law on his side. And this is what he\ndevised without consulting anyone, even the lawyer, whose suspicions he\nwas afraid of arousing. He knew how to turn his mother round his finger.\nOne fine morning he took her to a notary and made her sign a deed of\nsale. Provided she were left the hovel in the Impasse Saint-Mittre,\nAdelaide would have sold all Plassans. Besides, Pierre assured her an\nannual income of six hundred francs, and made the most solemn promises\nto watch over his brother and sister. This oath satisfied the good\nwoman. She recited, before the notary, the lesson which it had pleased\nher son to teach her. On the following day the young man made her place\nher name at the foot of a document in which she acknowledged having\nreceived fifty thousand francs as the price of the property. This was\nhis stroke of genius, the act of a rogue. He contented himself with\ntelling his mother, who was a little surprised at signing such a receipt\nwhen she had not seen a centime of the fifty thousand francs, that it\nwas a pure formality of no consequence whatever. As he slipped the paper\ninto his pocket, he thought to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, let the young wolves ask\nme to render an account. I will tell them the old woman has squandered\neverything. They will never dare to go to law with me about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A week\nafterwards, the party-wall no longer existed: a plough had turned up\nthe vegetable beds; the Fouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 enclosure, in accordance with young\nRougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish, was about to become a thing of the past. A few months\nlater, the owner of the Jas-Meiffren even had the old market-gardener\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhouse, which was falling to pieces, pulled down.\n\nWhen Pierre had secured the fifty thousand francs he married Felicite\nPuech with as little delay as possible. Felicite was a short, dark\nwoman, such as one often meets in Provence. She looked like one of\nthose brown, lean, noisy grasshoppers, which in their sudden leaps often\nstrike their heads against the almond-trees. Thin, flat-breasted, with\npointed shoulders and a face like that of a pole-cat, her features\nsingularly sunken and attenuated, it was not easy to tell her age;\nshe looked as near fifteen as thirty, although she was in reality only\nnineteen, four years younger than her husband. There was much feline\nslyness in the depths of her little black eyes, which suggested gimlet\nholes. Her low, bumpy forehead, her slightly depressed nose with\ndelicate quivering nostrils, her thin red lips and prominent chin,\nparted from her cheeks by strange hollows, all suggested the countenance\nof an artful dwarf, a living mask of intrigue, an active, envious\nambition. With all her ugliness, however, Felicite possessed a sort of\ngracefulness which rendered her seductive. People said of her that she\ncould be pretty or ugly as she pleased. It would depend on the fashion\nin which she tied her magnificent hair; but it depended still more on\nthe triumphant smile which illumined her golden complexion when she\nthought she had got the better of somebody. Born under an evil star,\nand believing herself ill-used by fortune, she was generally content\nto appear an ugly creature. She did not, however, intend to abandon the\nstruggle, for she had vowed that she would some day make the whole town\nburst with envy, by an insolent display of happiness and luxury. Had\nshe been able to act her part on a more spacious stage, where full play\nwould have been allowed her ready wit, she would have quickly brought\nher dream to pass. Her intelligence was far superior to that of the\ngirls of her own station and education. Evil tongues asserted that her\nmother, who had died a few years after she was born, had, during the\nearly period of her married life, been familiar with the Marquis de\nCarnavant, a young nobleman of the Saint-Marc quarter. In fact, Felicite\nhad the hands and feet of a marchioness, and, in this respect, did not\nappear to belong to that class of workers from which she was descended.\n\nHer marriage with Pierre Rougon, that semi-peasant, that man of the\nFaubourg, whose family was in such bad odour, kept the old quarter in\na state of astonishment for more than a month. She let people gossip,\nhowever, receiving the stiff congratulations of her friends with strange\nsmiles. Her calculations had been made; she had chosen Rougon for a\nhusband as one would choose an accomplice. Her father, in accepting the\nyoung man, had merely had eyes for the fifty thousand francs which were\nto save him from bankruptcy. Felicite, however, was more keen-sighted.\nShe looked into the future, and felt that she would be in want of a\nrobust man, even if he were somewhat rustic, behind whom she might\nconceal herself, and whose limbs she would move at will. She entertained\na deliberate hatred for the insignificant little exquisites of\nprovincial towns, the lean herd of notaries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 clerks and prospective\nbarristers, who stand shivering with cold while waiting for clients.\nHaving no dowry, and despairing of ever marrying a rich merchant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son,\nshe by far preferred a peasant whom she could use as a passive tool,\nto some lank graduate who would overwhelm her with his academical\nsuperiority, and drag her about all her life in search of hollow\nvanities. She was of opinion that the woman ought to make the man. She\nbelieved herself capable of carving a minister out of a cow-herd. That\nwhich had attracted her in Rougon was his broad chest, his heavy frame,\nwhich was not altogether wanting in elegance. A man thus built would\nbear with ease and sprightliness the mass of intrigues which she\ndreamt of placing on his shoulders. However, while she appreciated her\nhusband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength and vigour, she also perceived that he was far\nfrom being a fool; under his coarse flesh she had divined the cunning\nsuppleness of his mind. Still she was a long way from really knowing her\nRougon; she thought him far stupider than he was. A few days after her\nmarriage, as she was by chance fumbling in the drawer of a secretaire,\nshe came across the receipt for fifty thousand francs which Adelaide\nhad signed. At sight of it she understood things, and felt rather\nfrightened; her own natural average honesty rendered her hostile to such\nexpedients. Her terror, however, was not unmixed with admiration; Rougon\nbecame in her eyes a very smart fellow.\n\nThe young couple bravely sought to conquer fortune. The firm of Puech\n& Lacamp was not, after all, so embarrassed as Pierre had thought. Its\nliabilities were small, it was merely in want of ready-money. In the\nprovinces, traders adopt prudent courses to save them from serious\ndisasters. Puech & Lacamp were prudent to an excessive degree; they\nnever risked a thousand crowns without the greatest fear, and thus their\nhouse, a veritable hole, was an unimportant one. The fifty thousand\nfrancs that Pierre brought into it sufficed to pay the debts and extend\nthe business. The beginnings were good. During three successive years\nthe olive harvest was an abundant one. Felicite, by a bold stroke which\nabsolutely frightened both Pierre and old Puech, made them purchase\na considerable quantity of oil, which they stored in their warehouse.\nDuring the following years, as the young woman had foreseen, the crops\nfailed, and a considerable rise in prices having set in, they realised\nlarge profits by selling out their stock.\n\nA short time after this haul, Puech & Lacamp retired from the firm,\ncontent with the few sous they had just secured, and ambitious of living\non their incomes.\n\nThe young couple now had sole control of the business, and thought\nthat they had at last laid the foundation of their fortune. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have\nvanquished my ill-luck,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite would sometimes say to her husband.\n\nOne of the rare weaknesses of her energetic nature was to believe\nherself stricken by misfortune. Hitherto, so she asserted, nothing had\nbeen successful with either herself or her father, in spite of all their\nefforts. Goaded by her southern superstition, she prepared to struggle\nwith fate as one struggles with somebody who is endeavouring to strangle\none. Circumstances soon justified her apprehensions in a singular\nmanner. Ill-luck returned inexorably. Every year some fresh disaster\nshook Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business. A bankruptcy resulted in the loss of a few\nthousand francs; his estimates of crops proved incorrect, through\nthe most incredible circumstances; the safest speculations collapsed\nmiserably. It was a truceless, merciless combat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see I was born under an unlucky star!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite would bitterly\nexclaim.\n\nAnd yet she still struggled furiously, not understanding how it was that\nshe, who had shown such keen scent in a first speculation, could now\nonly give her husband the most deplorable advice.\n\nPierre, dejected and less tenacious than herself, would have gone\ninto liquidation a score of times had it not been for his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm\nobstinacy. She longed to be rich. She perceived that her ambition could\nonly be attained by fortune. As soon as they possessed a few hundred\nthousand francs they would be masters of the town. She would get her\nhusband appointed to an important post, and she would govern. It was\nnot the attainment of honours which troubled her; she felt herself\nmarvellously well armed for such a combat. But she could do nothing to\nget together the first few bags of money which were needed. Though the\nruling of men caused her no apprehensions, she felt a sort of impotent\nrage at the thought of those inert, white, cold, five-franc pieces over\nwhich her intriguing spirit had no power, and which obstinately resisted\nher.\n\nThe battle lasted for more than thirty years. The death of Puech proved\nanother heavy blow. Felicite, who had counted upon an inheritance of\nabout forty thousand francs, found that the selfish old man, in order\nto indulge himself in his old age, had sunk all his money in a life\nannuity. The discovery made her quite ill. She was gradually becoming\nsoured, she was growing more lean and harsh. To see her, from morning\ntill night, whirling round the jars of oil, one would have thought she\nbelieved that she could stimulate the sales by continually flitting\nabout like a restless fly. Her husband, on the contrary, became heavier;\nmisfortune fattened him, making him duller and more indolent. These\nthirty years of combat did not, however, bring him to ruin. At each\nannual stock-taking they managed to make both ends meet fairly well; if\nthey suffered any loss during one season, they recouped themselves the\nnext. However, it was precisely this living from hand to mouth which\nexasperated Felicite. She would, by far, have preferred a big failure.\nThey would then, perhaps, have been able to commence life over again,\ninstead of obstinately persisting in their petty business, working\nthemselves to death to gain the bare necessaries of life. During one\nthird of a century they did not save fifty thousand francs.\n\nIt should be mentioned that, from the very first years of their married\nlife, they had a numerous family, which in the long run became a heavy\nburden to them. In the course of five years, from 1811 to 1815, Felicite\ngave birth to three boys. Then during the four ensuing years she\npresented her husband with two girls. These had but an indifferent\nwelcome; daughters are a terrible embarrassment when one has no dowry to\ngive them.\n\nHowever, the young woman did not regard this troop of children as the\ncause of their ruin. On the contrary, she based on her sons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 heads the\nbuilding of the fortune which was crumbling in her own hands. They were\nhardly ten years old before she discounted their future careers in her\ndreams. Doubting whether she would ever succeed herself, she centred\nin them all her hopes of overcoming the animosity of fate. They would\nprovide satisfaction for her disappointed vanity, they would give her\nthat wealthy, honourable position which she had hitherto sought in vain.\nFrom that time forward, without abandoning the business struggle,\nshe conceived a second plan for obtaining the gratification of her\ndomineering instincts. It seemed to her impossible that, amongst her\nthree sons, there should not be a man of superior intellect, who would\nenrich them all. She felt it, she said. Accordingly, she nursed the\nchildren with a fervour in which maternal severity was blended with an\nusurer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solicitude. She amused herself by fattening them as though they\nconstituted a capital which, later on, would return a large interest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pierre would sometimes exclaim, \u00e2\u0080\u009call children are ungrateful.\nYou are spoiling them, you are ruining us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Felicite spoke of sending them to college, he got angry. Latin was\na useless luxury, it would be quite sufficient if they went through\nthe classes of a little neighbouring school The young woman, however,\npersisted in her design. She possessed certain elevated instincts which\nmade her take a great pride in surrounding herself with accomplished\nchildren; moreover, she felt that her sons must never remain as\nilliterate as her husband, if she wished to see them become prominent\nmen. She fancied them all three in Paris in high positions, which she\ndid not clearly define. When Rougon consented, and the three youngsters\nhad entered the eighth class, Felicite felt the most lively satisfaction\nshe had ever experienced. She listened with delight as they talked of\ntheir professors and their studies. When she heard her eldest son make\none of his brothers decline _Rosa, a rose_, it sounded like delicious\nmusic to her. It is only fair to add that her delight was not tarnished\nby any sordid calculations. Even Rougon felt the satisfaction which an\nilliterate man experiences on perceiving his sons grow more learned than\nhimself. Then the fellowship which grew up between their sons and\nthose of the local big-wigs completed the parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 gratification. The\nyoungsters were soon on familiar terms with the sons of the Mayor and\nthe Sub-Prefect, and even with two or three young noblemen whom the\nSaint-Marc quarter had deigned to send to the Plassans College. Felicite\nwas at a loss how to repay such an honour. The education of the three\nlads weighed seriously on the budget of the Rougon household.\n\nUntil the boys had taken their degrees, their parents, who kept them at\ncollege at enormous sacrifices, lived in hopes of their success. When\nthey had obtained their diplomas Felicite wished to continue her work,\nand even persuaded her husband to send the three to Paris. Two of them\ndevoted themselves to the study of law, and the third passed through\nthe School of Medicine. Then, when they were men, and had exhausted the\nresources of the Rougon family and were obliged to return and establish\nthemselves in the provinces, their parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 disenchantment began. They\nidled about and grew fat. And Felicite again felt all the bitterness of\nher ill-luck. Her sons were failing her. They had ruined her, and did\nnot return any interest on the capital which they represented. This\nlast blow of fate was the heaviest, as it fell on her ambition and her\nmaternal vanity alike. Rougon repeated to her from morning till night,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI told you so!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which only exasperated her the more.\n\nOne day, as she was bitterly reproaching her eldest son with the large\namount of money expended on his education, he said to her with equal\nbitterness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will repay you later on if I can. But as you had no\nmeans, you should have brought us up to a trade. We are out of our\nelement, we are suffering more than you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite understood the wisdom of these words. From that time she ceased\nto accuse her children, and turned her anger against fate, which never\nwearied of striking her. She started her old complaints afresh, and\nbemoaned more and more the want of means which made her strand, as it\nwere, in port. Whenever Rougon said to her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour sons are lazy fellows,\nthey will eat up all we have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she sourly replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould to God I had\nmore money to give them; if they do vegetate, poor fellows, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because\nthey haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got a sou to bless themselves with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the beginning of the year 1848, on the eve of the Revolution of\nFebruary, the three young Rougons held very precarious positions\nat Plassans. They presented most curious and profoundly dissimilar\ncharacteristics, though they came of the same stock. They were in\nreality superior to their parents. The race of the Rougons was destined\nto become refined through its female side. Adelaide had made Pierre\na man of moderate enterprise, disposed to low ambitions; Felicite\nhad inspired her sons with a higher intelligence, with a capacity for\ngreater vices and greater virtues.\n\nAt the period now referred to the eldest, Eugene, was nearly forty years\nold. He was a man of middle height, slightly bald, and already disposed\nto obesity. He had his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, a long face with broad features;\nbeneath his skin one could divine the fat to which were due the flabby\nroundness of his features, and his yellowish, waxy complexion. Though\nhis massive square head still recalled the peasant, his physiognomy was\ntransfigured, lit up from within as it were, when his drooping eyelids\nwere raised and his eyes awoke to life. In the son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, the father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nponderousness had turned to gravity. This big fellow, Eugene, usually\npreserved a heavy somnolent demeanour. At the same time, certain of his\nheavy, languid movements suggested those of a giant stretching his limbs\npending the time for action. By one of those alleged freaks of nature,\nof which, however, science is now commencing to discover the laws, if\nphysical resemblance to Pierre was perfect in Eugene, Felicite on\nher side seemed to have furnished him with his brains. He offered an\ninstance of certain moral and intellectual qualities of maternal origin\nbeing embedded in the coarse flesh he had derived from his father. He\ncherished lofty ambitions, possessed domineering instincts, and showed\nsingular contempt for trifling expedients and petty fortunes.\n\nHe was a proof that Plassans was perhaps not mistaken in suspecting that\nFelicite had some blue blood in her veins. The passion for indulgence,\nwhich became formidably developed in the Rougons, and was, in fact, the\nfamily characteristic, attained in his case its highest pitch; he longed\nfor self-gratification, but in the form of mental enjoyment such as\nwould gratify his burning desire for domination. A man such as this was\nnever intended to succeed in a provincial town. He vegetated there\nfor fifteen years, his eyes turned towards Paris, watching his\nopportunities. On his return home he had entered his name on the rolls,\nin order to be independent of his parents. After that he pleaded from\ntime to time, earning a bare livelihood, without appearing to rise above\naverage mediocrity. At Plassans his voice was considered thick, his\nmovements heavy. He generally wandered from the question at issue,\nrambled, as the wiseacres expressed it. On one occasion particularly,\nwhen he was pleading in a case for damages, he so forgot himself as to\nstray into a political disquisition, to such a point that the presiding\njudge interfered, whereupon he immediately sat down with a strange\nsmile. His client was condemned to pay a considerable sum of money,\na circumstance which did not, however, seem to cause Eugene the least\nregret for his irrelevant digression. He appeared to regard his speeches\nas mere exercises which would be of use to him later on. It was this\nthat puzzled and disheartened Felicite. She would have liked to see her\nson dictating the law to the Civil Court of Plassans. At last she came\nto entertain a very unfavourable opinion of her first-born. To her\nmind this lazy fellow would never be the one to shed any lustre on the\nfamily. Pierre, on the contrary, felt absolute confidence in him,\nnot that he had more intuition than his wife, but because external\nappearances sufficed him, and he flattered himself by believing in\nthe genius of a son who was his living image. A month prior to the\nRevolution of February, 1848, Eugene became restless; some special\ninspiration made him anticipate the crisis. From that time forward he\nseemed to feel out of his element at Plassans. He would wander about the\nstreets like a distressed soul. At last he formed a sudden resolution,\nand left for Paris, with scarcely five hundred francs in his pocket.\n\nAristide, the youngest son, was, so to speak, diametrically opposed\nto Eugene. He had his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and a covetousness and slyness of\ncharacter prone to trivial intrigues, in which his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instincts\npredominated. Nature has need of symmetry. Short, with a pitiful\ncountenance suggesting the knob of a stick carved into a Punch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head,\nAristide ferretted and fumbled everywhere, without any scruples, eager\nonly to gratify himself. He loved money as his eldest brother loved\npower. While Eugene dreamed of bending a people to his will, and\nintoxicated himself with visions of future omnipotence, the other\nfancied himself ten times a millionaire, installed in a princely\nmansion, eating and drinking to his heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content, and enjoying life\nto the fullest possible extent. Above all things, he longed to make a\nrapid fortune. When he was building his castles in the air, they would\nrise in his mind as if by magic; he would become possessed of tons of\ngold in one night. These visions agreed with his indolence, as he never\ntroubled himself about the means, considering those the best which were\nthe most expeditious. In his case the race of the Rougons, of those\ncoarse, greedy peasants with brutish appetites, had matured too rapidly;\nevery desire for material indulgence was found in him, augmented\nthreefold by hasty education, and rendered the more insatiable and\ndangerous by the deliberate way in which the young man had come to\nregard their realisation as his set purpose. In spite of her keen\nfeminine intuition, Felicite preferred this son; she did not perceive\nthe greater affinity between herself and Eugene; she excused the follies\nand indolence of her youngest son under the pretext that he would\nsome day be the superior genius of the family, and that such a man\nwas entitled to live a disorderly life until his intellectual strength\nshould be revealed.\n\nAristide subjected her indulgence to a rude test. In Paris he led a low,\nidle life; he was one of those students who enter their names at the\ntaverns of the Quartier Latin. He did not remain there, however, more\nthan two years; his father, growing apprehensive, and seeing that he had\nnot yet passed a single examination, kept him at Plassans and spoke of\nfinding a wife for him, hoping that domestic responsibility would make\nhim more steady. Aristide let himself be married. He had no very\nclear idea of his own ambitions at this time; provincial life did not\ndisplease him; he was battening in his little town--eating, sleeping,\nand sauntering about. Felicite pleaded his cause so earnestly that\nPierre consented to board and lodge the newly-married couple, on\ncondition that the young man should turn his attention to the business.\nFrom that time, however, Aristide led a life of ease and idleness. He\nspent his days and the best part of his nights at the club, again and\nagain slipping out of his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office like a schoolboy to go and\ngamble away the few louis that his mother gave him clandestinely.\n\nIt is necessary to have lived in the depths of the French provinces to\nform an idea of the four brutifying years which the young fellow spent\nin this fashion. In every little town there is a group of individuals\nwho thus live on their parents, pretending at times to work, but in\nreality cultivating idleness with a sort of religious zeal. Aristide was\ntypical of these incorrigible drones. For four years he did little\nbut play ecarte. While he passed his time at the club, his wife, a\nfair-complexioned nerveless woman, helped to ruin the Rougon business\nby her inordinate passion for showy gowns and her formidable appetite,\na rather remarkable peculiarity in so frail a creature. Angele, however,\nadored sky-blue ribbons and roast beef. She was the daughter of a\nretired captain who was called Commander Sicardot, a good-hearted old\ngentleman, who had given her a dowry of ten thousand francs--all his\nsavings. Pierre, in selecting Angele for his son had considered that\nhe had made an unexpected bargain, so lightly did he esteem Aristide.\nHowever, that dowry of ten thousand francs, which determined his choice,\nultimately became a millstone round his neck. His son, who was already\na cunning rogue, deposited the ten thousand francs with his father,\nwith whom he entered into partnership, declining, with the most sincere\nprofessions of devotion, to keep a single copper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have no need of anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will keep my wife and\nmyself, and we will reckon up later on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre was short of money at the time, and accepted, not, however,\nwithout some uneasiness at Aristide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disinterestedness. The latter\ncalculated that it would be years before his father would have ten\nthousand francs in ready money to repay him, so that he and his wife\nwould live at the paternal expense so long as the partnership could not\nbe dissolved. It was an admirable investment for his few bank-notes.\nWhen the oil-dealer understood what a foolish bargain he had made he\nwas not in a position to rid himself of Aristide; Angele\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dowry was\ninvolved in speculations which were turning out unfavourably. He\nwas exasperated, stung to the heart, at having to provide for his\ndaughter-in-law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voracious appetite and keep his son in idleness. Had\nhe been able to buy them out of the business he would twenty times have\nshut his doors on those bloodsuckers, as he emphatically expressed it.\nFelicite secretly defended them; the young man, who had divined her\ndreams of ambition, would every evening describe to her the elaborate\nplans by which he would shortly make a fortune. By a rare chance she\nhad remained on excellent terms with her daughter-in-law. It must be\nconfessed that Angele had no will of her own--she could be moved and\ndisposed of like a piece of furniture.\n\nMeantime Pierre became enraged whenever his wife spoke to him of the\nsuccess their youngest son would ultimately achieve; he declared that\nhe would really bring them to ruin. During the four years that the young\ncouple lived with him he stormed in this manner, wasting his impotent\nrage in quarrels, without in the least disturbing the equanimity of\nAristide and Angele. They were located there, and there they intended\nto remain like blocks of wood. At last Pierre met with a stroke of luck\nwhich enabled him to return the ten thousand francs to his son. When,\nhowever, he wanted to reckon up accounts with him, Aristide interposed\nso much chicanery that he had to let the couple go without deducting\na copper for their board and lodging. They installed themselves but\na short distance off, in a part of the old quarter called the Place\nSaint-Louis. The ten thousand francs were soon consumed. They had\neverything to get for their new home. Moreover Aristide made no change\nin his mode of living as long as any money was left in the house. When\nhe had reached the last hundred-franc note he felt rather nervous. He\nwas seen prowling about the town in a suspicious manner. He no longer\ntook his customary cup of coffee at the club; he watched feverishly\nwhilst play was going on, without touching a card. Poverty made him more\nspiteful than he would otherwise have been. He bore the blow for a long\ntime, obstinately refusing to do anything in the way of work.\n\nIn 1840 he had a son, little Maxime, whom his grandmother Felicite\nfortunately sent to college, paying his fees clandestinely. That made\none mouth less at home; but poor Angele was dying of hunger, and her\nhusband was at last compelled to seek a situation. He secured one at the\nSub-Prefecture. He remained there nearly ten years, and only attained a\nsalary of eighteen hundred francs per annum. From that time forward it\nwas with ever increasing malevolence and rancour that he hungered for\nthe enjoyments of which he was deprived. His lowly position exasperated\nhim; the paltry hundred and fifty francs which he received every month\nseemed to him an irony of fate. Never did man burn with such desire for\nself-gratification. Felicite, to whom he imparted his sufferings, was\nby no means grieved to see him so eager. She thought his misery would\nstimulate his energies. At last, crouching in ambush as it were, with\nhis ears wide open, he began to look about him like a thief seeking his\nopportunity. At the beginning of 1848, when his brother left for Paris,\nhe had a momentary idea of following him. But Eugene was a bachelor;\nand he, Aristide, could not take his wife so far without money. So he\nwaited, scenting a catastrophe, and ready to fall on the first prey that\nmight come within his reach.\n\nThe other son, Pascal, born between Eugene and Aristide, did not appear\nto belong to the family. He was one of those frequent cases which give\nthe lie to the laws of heredity. During the evolution of a race nature\noften produces some one being whose every element she derives from her\nown creative powers. Nothing in the moral or physical constitution of\nPascal recalled the Rougons. Tall, with a grave and gentle face, he\nhad an uprightness of mind, a love of study, a retiring modesty which\ncontrasted strangely with the feverish ambitions and unscrupulous\nintrigues of his relatives. After acquitting himself admirably of his\nmedical studies in Paris, he had retired, by preference, to Plassans,\nnotwithstanding the offers he received from his professors. He loved a\nquiet provincial life; he maintained that for a studious man such a life\nwas preferable to the excitement of Paris. Even at Plassans he did\nnot exert himself to extend his practice. Very steady, and despising\nfortune, he contented himself with the few patients sent him by chance.\nAll his pleasures were centred in a bright little house in the new town,\nwhere he shut himself up, lovingly devoting his whole time to the study\nof natural history. He was particularly fond of physiology. It was known\nin the town that he frequently purchased dead bodies from the hospital\ngrave-digger, a circumstance which rendered him an object of horror to\ndelicate ladies and certain timid gentlemen. Fortunately, they did not\nactually look upon him as a sorcerer; but his practice diminished,\nand he was regarded as an eccentric character, to whom people of good\nsociety ought not to entrust even a finger-tip, for fear of being\ncompromised. The mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife was one day heard to say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would sooner\ndie than be attended by that gentleman. He smells of death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom that time, Pascal was condemned. He seemed to rejoice at the mute\nterror which he inspired. The fewer patients he had, the more time he\ncould devote to his favourite sciences. As his fees were very moderate,\nthe poorer people remained faithful to him; he earned just enough to\nlive, and lived contentedly, a thousand leagues away from the rest\nof the country, absorbed in the pure delight of his researches and\ndiscoveries. From time to time he sent a memoir to the Academie des\nSciences at Paris. Plassans did not know that this eccentric character,\nthis gentleman who smelt of death was well-known and highly-esteemed\nin the world of science. When people saw him starting on Sundays for an\nexcursion among the Garrigues hills, with a botanist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bag hung round\nhis neck and a geologist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hammer in his hand, they would shrug their\nshoulders and institute a comparison between him and some other doctor\nof the town who was noted for his smart cravat, his affability to the\nladies, and the delicious odour of violets which his garments always\ndiffused. Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parents did not understand him any better than other\npeople. When Felicite saw him adopting such a strange, unpretentious\nmode of life she was stupefied, and reproached him for disappointing\nher hopes. She, who tolerated Aristide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idleness because she thought it\nwould prove fertile, could not view without regret the slow progress\nof Pascal, his partiality for obscurity and contempt for riches, his\ndetermined resolve to lead a life of retirement. He was certainly not\nthe child who would ever gratify her vanities.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut where do you spring from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would sometimes say to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\nare not one of us. Look at your brothers, how they keep their eyes open,\nstriving to profit by the education we have given them, whilst you waste\nyour time on follies and trifles. You make a very poor return to us, who\nhave ruined ourselves for your education. No, you are certainly not one\nof us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal, who preferred to laugh whenever he was called upon to feel\nannoyed, replied cheerfully, but not without a sting of irony: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\nyou need not be frightened, I shall never drive you to the verge of\nbankruptcy; when any of you are ill, I will attend you for nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMoreover, though he never displayed any repugnance to his relatives,\nhe very rarely saw them, following in this wise his natural instincts.\nBefore Aristide obtained a situation at the Sub-Prefecture, Pascal\nhad frequently come to his assistance. For his part he had remained a\nbachelor. He had not the least suspicion of the grave events that were\npreparing. For two or three years he had been studying the great problem\nof heredity, comparing the human and animal races together, and becoming\nabsorbed in the strange results which he obtained. Certain observations\nwhich he had made with respect to himself and his relatives had been, so\nto say, the starting-point of his studies. The common people, with their\nnatural intuition, so well understood that he was quite different from\nthe other Rougons, that they invariably called him Monsieur Pascal,\nwithout ever adding his family name.\n\nThree years prior to the Revolution of 1848 Pierre and Felicite retired\nfrom business. Old age was coming on apace; they were both past fifty\nand were weary enough of the struggle. In face of their ill fortune,\nthey were afraid of being ultimately ruined if they obstinately\npersisted in the fight. Their sons, by disappointing their expectations,\nhad dealt them the final blow. Now that they despaired of ever being\nenriched by them, they were anxious to make some little provision for\nold age. They retired with forty thousand francs at the utmost. This\nsum provided an annual income of two thousand francs, just sufficient\nto live in a small way in the provinces. Fortunately, they were by\nthemselves, having succeeded in marrying their daughters Marthe and\nSidonie, the former of whom resided at Marseilles and the latter in\nParis.\n\nAfter they had settled their affairs they would much have liked to take\nup their abode in the new town, the quarter of the retired traders, but\nthey dared not do so. Their income was too small; they were afraid that\nthey would cut but a poor figure there. So, as a sort of compromise,\nthey took apartments in the Rue de la Banne, the street which separates\nthe old quarter from the new one. As their abode was one of the row\nof houses bordering the old quarter, they still lived among the common\npeople; nevertheless, they could see the town of the richer classes from\ntheir windows, so that they were just on the threshold of the promised\nland.\n\nTheir apartments, situated on the second floor, consisted of three\nlarge rooms--dining-room, drawing-room, and bedroom. The first floor was\noccupied by the owner of the house, a stick and umbrella manufacturer,\nwho had a shop on the ground floor. The house, which was narrow and\nby no means deep, had only two storeys. Felicite moved into it with a\nbitter pang. In the provinces, to live in another person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house is an\navowal of poverty. Every family of position at Plassans has a house\nof its own, landed property being very cheap there. Pierre kept the\npurse-strings well tied; he would not hear of any embellishments. The\nold furniture, faded, worn, damaged though it was, had to suffice,\nwithout even being repaired. Felicite, however, who keenly felt the\nnecessity for this parsimony, exerted herself to give fresh polish to\nall the wreckage; she herself knocked nails into some of the furniture\nwhich was more dilapidated than the rest, and darned the frayed velvet\nof the arm-chairs.\n\nThe dining-room, which, like the kitchen, was at the back of the house,\nwas nearly bare; a table and a dozen chairs were lost in the gloom of\nthis large apartment, whose window faced the grey wall of a neighbouring\nbuilding. As no strangers ever went into the bedroom, Felicite had\nstowed all her useless furniture there; thus, besides a bedstead,\nwardrobe, secretaire, and wash-stand, it contained two cradles, one\nperched atop of the other, a sideboard whose doors were missing, and an\nempty bookcase, venerable ruins which the old woman could not make up\nher mind to part with. All her cares, however, were bestowed upon the\ndrawing-room, and she almost succeeded in making it comfortable and\ndecent. The furniture was covered with yellowish velvet with satin\nflowers; in the middle stood a round table with a marble top, while a\ncouple of pier tables, surmounted by mirrors, leant against the walls at\neither end of the room. There was even a carpet, which just covered the\nmiddle of the floor, and a chandelier in a white muslin cover which the\nflies had spotted with black specks. On the walls hung six lithographs\nrepresenting the great battles of Napoleon I. Moreover, the furniture\ndated from the first years of the Empire. The only embellishment that\nFelicite could obtain was to have the walls hung with orange-hued paper\ncovered with large flowers. Thus the drawing room had a strange yellow\nglow, which filled it with an artificial dazzling light. The furniture,\nthe paper, and the window curtains were yellow; the carpet and even the\nmarble table-tops showed touches of yellow. However, when the curtains\nwere drawn the colours harmonised fairly well and the drawing-room\nlooked almost decent.\n\nBut Felicite had dreamed of quite a different kind of luxury. She\nregarded with mute despair this ill-concealed misery. She usually\noccupied the drawing-room, the best apartment in the house, and the\nsweetest and bitterest of her pastimes was to sit at one of the windows\nwhich overlooked the Rue de la Banne and gave her a side view of the\nsquare in front of the Sub-Prefecture. That was the paradise of her\ndreams. That little, neat, tidy square, with its bright houses, seemed\nto her a Garden of Eden. She would have given ten years of her life to\npossess one of those habitations. The house at the left-hand corner,\nin which the receiver of taxes resided, particularly tempted her. She\ncontemplated it with eager longing. Sometimes, when the windows of\nthis abode were open, she could catch a glimpse of rich furniture and\ntasteful elegance which made her burn with envy.\n\nAt this period the Rougons passed through a curious crisis of vanity\nand unsatiated appetite. The few proper feelings which they had once\nentertained had become embittered. They posed as victims of evil\nfortune, not with resignation, however, for they seemed still more\nkeenly determined that they would not die before they had satisfied\ntheir ambitions. In reality, they did not abandon any of their hopes,\nnotwithstanding their advanced age. Felicite professed to feel a\npresentiment that she would die rich. However, each day of poverty\nweighed them down the more. When they recapitulated their vain\nattempts--when they recalled their thirty years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 struggle, and the\ndefection of their children--when they saw their airy castles end in\nthis yellow drawing-room, whose shabbiness they could only conceal by\ndrawing the curtains, they were overcome with bitter rage. Then, as a\nconsolation, they would think of plans for making a colossal fortune,\nseeking all sorts of devices. Felicite would fancy herself the winner\nof the grand prize of a hundred thousand francs in some lottery, while\nPierre pictured himself carrying out some wonderful speculation. They\nlived with one sole thought--that of making a fortune immediately, in a\nfew hours--of becoming rich and enjoying themselves, if only for a year.\nTheir whole beings tended to this, stubbornly, without a pause. And they\nstill cherished some faint hopes with regard to their sons, with that\npeculiar egotism of parents who cannot bear to think that they have sent\ntheir children to college without deriving some personal advantage from\nit.\n\nFelicite did not appear to have aged; she was still the same dark little\nwoman, ever on the move, buzzing about like a grasshopper. Any person\nwalking behind her on the pavement would have thought her a girl of\nfifteen, from the lightness of her step and the angularity of her\nshoulders and waist. Even her face had scarcely undergone any change; it\nwas simply rather more sunken, rather more suggestive of the snout of a\npole-cat.\n\nAs for Pierre Rougon, he had grown corpulent, and had become a highly\nrespectable looking citizen, who only lacked a decent income to make him\na very dignified individual. His pale, flabby face, his heaviness,\nhis languid manner, seemed redolent of wealth. He had one day heard a\npeasant who did not know him say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some rich fellow, that fat\nold gentleman there. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no cause to worry about his dinner!\u00e2\u0080\u009d This\nwas a remark which stung him to the heart, for he considered it cruel\nmockery to be only a poor devil while possessing the bulk and contented\ngravity of a millionaire. When he shaved on Sundays in front of a small\nfive-sou looking-glass hanging from the fastening of a window, he would\noften think that in a dress coat and white tie he would cut a far better\nfigure at the Sub-Prefect\u00e2\u0080\u0099s than such or such a functionary of Plassans.\nThis peasant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, who had grown sallow from business worries, and\ncorpulent from a sedentary life, whose hateful passions were hidden\nbeneath naturally placid features, really had that air of solemn\nimbecility which gives a man a position in an official salon. People\nimagined that his wife held a rod over him, but they were mistaken. He\nwas as self-willed as a brute. Any determined expression of extraneous\nwill would drive him into a violent rage. Felicite was far too supple to\nthwart him openly; with her light fluttering nature she did not attack\nobstacles in front. When she wished to obtain something from her\nhusband, or drive him the way she thought best, she would buzz round him\nin her grasshopper fashion, stinging him on all sides, and returning\nto the charge a hundred times until he yielded almost unconsciously. He\nfelt, moreover, that she was shrewder than he, and tolerated her advice\nfairly patiently. Felicite, more useful than the coach fly, would\nsometimes do all the work while she was thus buzzing round Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nears. Strange to say, the husband and wife never accused each other\nof their ill-success. The only bone of contention between them was the\neducation lavished on their children.\n\nThe Revolution of 1848 found all the Rougons on the lookout, exasperated\nby their bad luck, and disposed to lay violent hands on fortune if ever\nthey should meet her in a byway. They were a family of bandits lying in\nwait, ready to rifle and plunder. Eugene kept an eye on Paris; Aristide\ndreamed of strangling Plassans; the mother and father, perhaps the most\neager of the lot, intended to work on their own account, and reap\nsome additional advantage from their sons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 doings. Pascal alone, that\ndiscreet wooer of science, led the happy, indifferent life of a lover in\nhis bright little house in the new town.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nIn that closed, sequestered town of Plassans, where class distinction\nwas so clearly marked in 1848, the commotion caused by political events\nwas very slight. Even at the present day the popular voice sounds very\nfaintly there; the middle classes bring their prudence to bear in the\nmatter, the nobility their mute despair, and the clergy their shrewd\ncunning. Kings may usurp thrones, or republics may be established,\nwithout scarcely any stir in the town. Plassans sleeps while Paris\nfights. But though on the surface the town may appear calm and\nindifferent, in the depths hidden work goes on which it is curious\nto study. If shots are rare in the streets, intrigues consume the\ndrawing-rooms of both the new town and the Saint-Marc quarter. Until the\nyear 1830 the masses were reckoned of no account. Even at the present\ntime they are similarly ignored. Everything is settled between the\nclergy, the nobility, and the bourgeoisie. The priests, who are very\nnumerous, give the cue to the local politics; they lay subterranean\nmines, as it were, and deal blows in the dark, following a prudent\ntactical system, which hardly allows of a step in advance or retreat\neven in the course of ten years. The secret intrigues of men who desire\nabove all things to avoid noise requires special shrewdness, a special\naptitude for dealing with small matters, and a patient endurance such\nas one only finds in persons callous to all passions. It is thus that\nprovincial dilatoriness, which is so freely ridiculed in Paris, is full\nof treachery, secret stabs, hidden victories and defeats. These worthy\nmen, particularly when their interests are at stake, kill at home with\na snap of the fingers, as we, the Parisians, kill with cannon in the\npublic thoroughfares.\n\nThe political history of Plassans, like that of all little towns in\nProvence, is singularly characteristic. Until 1830, the inhabitants\nremained observant Catholics and fervent royalists; even the lower\nclasses only swore by God and their legitimate sovereigns. Then there\ncame a sudden change; faith departed, the working and middle classes\ndeserted the cause of legitimacy, and gradually espoused the great\ndemocratic movement of our time. When the Revolution of 1848 broke out,\nthe nobility and the clergy were left alone to labour for the triumph\nof Henri V. For a long time they had regarded the accession of the\nOrleanists as a ridiculous experiment, which sooner or later would bring\nback the Bourbons; although their hopes were singularly shaken, they\nnevertheless continued the struggle, scandalised by the defection of\ntheir former allies, whom they strove to win back to their cause. The\nSaint-Marc quarter, assisted by all the parish priests, set to\nwork. Among the middle classes, and especially among the people, the\nenthusiasm was very great on the morrow of the events of February; these\napprentice republicans were in haste to display their revolutionary\nfervour. As regards the gentry of the new town, however, the\nconflagration, bright though it was, lasted no longer than a fire of\nstraw. The small houseowners and retired tradespeople who had had their\ngood days, or had made snug little fortunes under the monarchy, were\nsoon seized with panic; the Republic, with its constant shocks and\nconvulsions, made them tremble for their money and their life of\nselfishness.\n\nConsequently, when the Clerical reaction of 1849 declared itself, nearly\nall the middle classes passed over to the Conservative party. They were\nreceived with open arms. The new town had never before had such close\nrelations with the Saint-Marc quarter: some of the nobility even went\nso far as to shake hands with lawyers and retired oil-dealers. This\nunexpected familiarity kindled the enthusiasm of the new quarter, which\nhenceforward waged bitter warfare against the republican government. To\nbring about such a coalition, the clergy had to display marvellous skill\nand endurance. The nobility of Plassans for the most part lay prostrate,\nas if half dead. They retained their faith, but lethargy had fallen on\nthem, and they preferred to remain inactive, allowing the heavens to\nwork their will. They would gladly have contented themselves with silent\nprotest, feeling, perhaps, a vague presentiment that their divinities\nwere dead, and that there was nothing left for them to do but rejoin\nthem. Even at this period of confusion, when the catastrophe of 1848 was\ncalculated to give them a momentary hope of the return of the Bourbons,\nthey showed themselves spiritless and indifferent, speaking of rushing\ninto the melee, yet never quitting their hearths without a pang of\nregret.\n\nThe clergy battled indefatigably against this feeling of impotence and\nresignation. They infused a kind of passion into their work: a priest,\nwhen he despairs, struggles all the more fiercely. The fundamental\npolicy of the Church is to march straight forward; even though she\nmay have to postpone the accomplishment of her projects for several\ncenturies, she never wastes a single hour, but is always pushing forward\nwith increasing energy. So it was the clergy who led the reaction of\nPlassans; the nobility only lent them their name, nothing more. The\npriests hid themselves behind the nobles, restrained them, directed\nthem, and even succeeded in endowing them with a semblance of life. When\nthey had induced them to overcome their repugnance so far as to make\ncommon cause with the middle classes, they believed themselves certain\nof victory. The ground was marvellously well prepared. This ancient\nroyalist town, with its population of peaceful householders and timorous\ntradespeople, was destined to range itself, sooner or later, on the side\nof law and order. The clergy, by their tactics, hastened the conversion.\nAfter gaining the landlords of the new town to their side, they even\nsucceeded in convincing the little retail-dealers of the old quarter.\nFrom that time the reactionary movement obtained complete possession of\nthe town. All opinions were represented in this reaction; such a mixture\nof embittered Liberals, Legitimists, Orleanists, Bonapartists, and\nClericals had never before been seen. It mattered little, however, at\nthat time. The sole object was to kill the Republic; and the Republic\nwas at the point of death. Only a fraction of the people--a thousand\nworkmen at most, out of the ten thousand souls in the town--still\nsaluted the tree of liberty planted in the middle of the square in front\nof the Sub-Prefecture.\n\nThe shrewdest politicians of Plassans, those who led the reactionary\nmovement, did not scent the approach of the Empire until very much\nlater. Prince Louis Napoleon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popularity seemed to them a mere passing\nfancy of the multitude. His person inspired them with but little\nadmiration. They reckoned him a nonentity, a dreamer, incapable of\nlaying his hands on France, and especially of maintaining his authority.\nTo them he was only a tool whom they would make use of, who would clear\nthe way for them, and whom they would turn out as soon as the hour\narrived for the rightful Pretender to show himself.[*] However, months\nwent by, and they became uneasy. It was only then that they vaguely\nperceived they were being duped: they had no time, however, to take any\nsteps; the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat burst over their heads, and they were compelled\nto applaud. That great abomination, the Republic, had been assassinated;\nthat, at least, was some sort of triumph. So the clergy and the nobility\naccepted accomplished facts with resignation; postponing, until\nlater, the realisation of their hopes, and making amends for their\nmiscalculations by uniting with the Bonapartists for the purpose of\ncrushing the last Republicans.\n\n     [*] The Count de Chambord, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHenri V.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was these events that laid the foundation of the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fortune.\nAfter being mixed up with the various phases of the crisis, they rose to\neminence on the ruins of liberty. These bandits had been lying in wait\nto rob the Republic; as soon as it had been strangled, they helped to\nplunder it.\n\nAfter the events of February 1848, Felicite, who had the keenest scent\nof all the members of the family, perceived that they were at last on\nthe right track. So she began to flutter round her husband, goading\nhim on to bestir himself. The first rumours of the Revolution that had\noverturned King Louis Philippe had terrified Pierre. When his wife,\nhowever, made him understand that they had little to lose and much to\ngain from a convulsion, he soon came round to her way of thinking.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you can do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite repeatedly said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut it seems\nto me that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty to be done. Did not Monsieur de Carnavant say\nto us one day that he would be rich if ever Henri V. should return, and\nthat this sovereign would magnificently recompense those who had worked\nfor his restoration? Perhaps our fortune lies in that direction. We may\nyet be lucky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Marquis de Carnavant, the nobleman who, according to the scandalous\ntalk of the town, had been on very familiar terms with Felicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmother, used occasionally to visit the Rougons. Evil tongues asserted\nthat Madame Rougon resembled him. He was a little, lean, active man,\nseventy-five years old at that time, and Felicite certainly appeared to\nbe taking his features and manner as she grew older. It was said that\nthe wreck of his fortune, which had already been greatly diminished by\nhis father at the time of the Emigration, had been squandered on women.\nIndeed, he cheerfully acknowledged his poverty. Brought up by one of\nhis relatives, the Count de Valqueyras, he lived the life of a parasite,\neating at the count\u00e2\u0080\u0099s table and occupying a small apartment just under\nhis roof.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLittle one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would often say to Felicite, as he patted her on\nthe cheek, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif ever Henri V. gives me a fortune, I will make you my\nheiress!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe still called Felicite \u00e2\u0080\u009clittle one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d even when she was fifty years\nold. It was of these friendly pats, of these repeated promises of an\ninheritance, that Madame Rougon was thinking when she endeavoured\nto drive her husband into politics. Monsieur de Carnavant had often\nbitterly lamented his inability to render her any assistance. No\ndoubt he would treat her like a father if ever he should acquire some\ninfluence. Pierre, to whom his wife half explained the situation in\nveiled terms, declared his readiness to move in any direction indicated.\n\nThe marquis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s peculiar position qualified him to act as an energetic\nagent of the reactionary movement at Plassans from the first days of the\nRepublic. This bustling little man, who had everything to gain from the\nreturn of his legitimate sovereigns, worked assiduously for their cause.\nWhile the wealthy nobility of the Saint-Marc quarter were slumbering in\nmute despair, fearing, perhaps that they might compromise themselves and\nagain be condemned to exile, he multiplied himself, as it were, spread\nthe propaganda and rallied faithful ones together. He was a weapon whose\nhilt was held by an invisible hand. From that time forward he paid daily\nvisits to the Rougons. He required a centre of operations. His relative,\nMonsieur de Valqueyras, had forbidden him to bring any of his associates\ninto his house, so he had chosen Felicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yellow drawing-room.\nMoreover, he very soon found Pierre a valuable assistant. He could not\ngo himself and preach the cause of Legitimacy to the petty traders and\nworkmen of the old quarter; they would have hooted him. Pierre, on the\nother hand, who had lived among these people, spoke their language and\nknew their wants, was able to catechise them in a friendly way. He thus\nbecame an indispensable man. In less than a fortnight the Rougons were\nmore determined royalists than the king himself. The marquis, perceiving\nPierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s zeal, shrewdly sheltered himself behind him. What was the use\nof making himself conspicuous, when a man with such broad shoulders was\nwilling to bear on them the burden of all the follies of a party? He\nallowed Pierre to reign, puff himself out with importance and speak\nwith authority, content to restrain or urge him on, according to\nthe necessities of the cause. Thus, the old oil-dealer soon became a\npersonage of mark. In the evening, when they were alone, Felicite used\nto say to him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be frightened. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the right track. If\nthis continues we shall be rich; we shall have a drawing-room like the\ntax-receiver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and be able to entertain people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA little party of Conservatives had already been formed at the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nhouse, and meetings were held every evening in the yellow drawing-room\nto declaim against the Republic.\n\nAmong those who came were three or four retired merchants who trembled\nfor their money, and clamoured with all their might for a wise and\nstrong government. An old almond-dealer, a member of the Municipal\nCouncil, Monsieur Isidore Granoux, was the head of this group. His\nhare-lipped mouth was cloven a little way from the nose; his round eyes,\nhis air of mingled satisfaction and astonishment, made him resemble a\nfat goose whose digestion is attended by wholesome terror of the cook.\nHe spoke little, having no command of words; and he only pricked up\nhis ears when anyone accused the Republicans of wishing to pillage the\nhouses of the rich; whereupon he would colour up to such a degree as\nto make one fear an approaching apoplectic fit, and mutter low\nimprecations, in which the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cidlers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cscoundrels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cthieves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cassassins\u00e2\u0080\u009d frequently recurred.\n\nAll those who frequented the yellow drawing-room were not, however,\nas heavy as this fat goose. A rich landowner, Monsieur Roudier, with a\nplump, insinuating face, used to discourse there for hours altogether,\nwith all the passion of an Orleanist whose calculations had been upset\nby the fall of Louis Philippe. He had formerly been a hosier at Paris,\nand a purveyor to the Court, but had now retired to Plassans. He had\nmade his son a magistrate, relying on the Orleanist party to promote him\nto the highest dignities. The revolution having ruined all his hopes, he\nhad rushed wildly into the reaction. His fortune, his former commercial\nrelations with the Tuileries, which he transformed into friendly\nintercourse, that prestige which is enjoyed by every man in the\nprovinces who has made his money in Paris and deigns to come and spend\nit in a far away department, gave him great influence in the district;\nsome persons listened to him as though he were an oracle.\n\nHowever, the strongest intellect of the yellow drawing-room was\ncertainly Commander Sicardot, Aristide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father-in-law. Of Herculean\nframe, with a brick-red face, scarred and planted with tufts of grey\nhair, he was one of the most glorious old dolts of the Grande Armee.\nDuring the February Revolution he had been exasperated with the\nstreet warfare and never wearied of referring to it, proclaiming with\nindignation that this kind of fighting was shameful: whereupon he\nrecalled with pride the grand reign of Napoleon.\n\nAnother person seen at the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house was an individual with clammy\nhands and equivocal look, one Monsieur Vuillet, a bookseller, who\nsupplied all the devout ladies of the town with holy images and\nrosaries. Vuillet dealt in both classical and religious works; he was\na strict Catholic, a circumstance which insured him the custom of the\nnumerous convents and parish churches. Further, by a stroke of genius he\nhad added to his business the publication of a little bi-weekly\njournal, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGazette de Plassans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which was devoted exclusively to\nthe interests of the clergy. This paper involved an annual loss of a\nthousand francs, but it made him the champion of the Church, and enabled\nhim to dispose of his sacred unsaleable stock. Though he was virtually\nilliterate and could not even spell correctly, he himself wrote the\narticles of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGazette\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a humility and rancour that compensated\nfor his lack of talent. The marquis, in entering on the campaign, had\nperceived immediately the advantage that might be derived from the\nco-operation of this insipid sacristan with the coarse, mercenary pen.\nAfter the February Revolution the articles in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGazette\u00e2\u0080\u009d contained\nfewer mistakes; the marquis revised them.\n\nOne can now imagine what a singular spectacle the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 yellow\ndrawing-room presented every evening. All opinions met there to bark at\nthe Republic. Their hatred of that institution made them agree together.\nThe marquis, who never missed a meeting, appeased by his presence the\nlittle squabbles which occasionally arose between the commander and\nthe other adherents. These plebeians were inwardly flattered by the\nhandshakes which he distributed on his arrival and departure. Roudier,\nhowever, like a free-thinker of the Rue Saint-Honore, asserted that the\nmarquis had not a copper to bless himself with, and was disposed to make\nlight of him. M. de Carnavant on his side preserved the amiable smile of\na nobleman lowering himself to the level of these middle class people,\nwithout making any of those contemptuous grimaces which any other\nresident of the Saint-Marc quarter would have thought fit under such\ncircumstances. The parasite life he had led had rendered him supple. He\nwas the life and soul of the group, commanding in the name of unknown\npersonages whom he never revealed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want this, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want\nthat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say. The concealed divinities who thus watched over\nthe destinies of Plassans from behind some cloud, without appearing to\ninterfere directly in public matters, must have been certain priests,\nthe great political agents of the country. When the marquis pronounced\nthat mysterious word \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which inspired the assembly with such\nmarvellous respect, Vuillet confessed, with a gesture of pious devotion,\nthat he knew them very well.\n\nThe happiest person in all this was Felicite. At last she had people\ncoming to her drawing-room. It was true she felt a little ashamed of her\nold yellow velvet furniture. She consoled herself, however, thinking\nof the rich things she would purchase when the good cause should have\ntriumphed. The Rougons had, in the end, regarded their royalism as very\nserious. Felicite went as far as to say, when Roudier was not present,\nthat if they had not made a fortune in the oil business the fault lay in\nthe monarchy of July. This was her mode of giving a political tinge to\ntheir poverty. She had a friendly word for everybody, even for Granoux,\ninventing each evening some new polite method of waking him up when it\nwas time for departure.\n\nThe drawing-room, that little band of Conservatives belonging to\nall parties, and daily increasing in numbers, soon wielded powerful\ninfluence. Owing to the diversified characters of its members, and\nespecially to the secret impulse which each one received from the\nclergy, it became the centre of the reactionary movement and spread its\ninfluence throughout Plassans. The policy of the marquis, who sank his\nown personality, transformed Rougon into the leader of the party. The\nmeetings were held at his house, and this circumstance sufficed in the\neyes of most people to make him the head of the group, and draw public\nattention to him. The whole work was attributed to him; he was believed\nto be the chief artisan of the movement which was gradually bringing\nover to the Conservative party those who had lately been enthusiastic\nRepublicans. There are some situations which benefit only persons of bad\nrepute. These lay the foundations of their fortune where men of better\nposition and more influence would never dare to risk theirs. Roudier,\nGranoux, and the others, all men of means and respectability, certainly\nseemed a thousand times preferable to Pierre as the acting leaders of\nthe Conservative party. But none of them would have consented to turn\nhis drawing-room into a political centre. Their convictions did not go\nso far as to induce them to compromise themselves openly; in fact, they\nwere only so many provincial babblers, who liked to inveigh against the\nRepublic at a neighbour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house as long as the neighbour was willing to\nbear the responsibility of their chatter. The game was too risky. There\nwas no one among the middle classes of Plassans who cared to play it\nexcept the Rougons, whose ungratified longings urged them on to extreme\nmeasures.\n\nIn the month of April, 1849, Eugene suddenly left Paris, and came to\nstay with his father for a fortnight. Nobody ever knew the purpose of\nthis journey. It is probable that Eugene wanted to sound his native\ntown, to ascertain whether he might successfully stand as a candidate\nfor the legislature which was about to replace the Constituent Assembly.\nHe was too shrewd to risk a failure. No doubt public opinion appeared to\nhim little in his favour, for he abstained from any attempt. It was not\nknown at Plassans what had become of him in Paris, what he was doing\nthere. On his return to his native place, folks found him less heavy and\nsomnolent than formerly. They surrounded him and endeavoured to make him\nspeak out concerning the political situation. But he feigned ignorance\nand compelled them to talk. A little perspicacity would have detected\nthat beneath his apparent unconcern there was great anxiety with regard\nto the political opinions of the town. However, he seemed to be sounding\nthe ground more on behalf of a party than on his own account.\n\nAlthough he had renounced all hope for himself, he remained at Plassans\nuntil the end of the month, assiduously attending the meetings in the\nyellow drawing-room. As soon as the bell rang, announcing the first\nvisitor, he would take up his position in one of the window recesses as\nfar as possible from the lamp. And he remained there the whole\nevening, resting his chin on the palm of his right hand, and listening\nreligiously. The greatest absurdities did not disturb his equanimity.\nHe nodded approval even to the wild grunts of Granoux. When anyone asked\nhim his own opinion, he politely repeated that of the majority. Nothing\nseemed to tire his patience, neither the hollow dreams of the marquis,\nwho spoke of the Bourbons as if 1815 were a recent date, nor the\neffusions of citizen Roudier, who grew quite pathetic when he recounted\nhow many pairs of socks he had supplied to the citizen king, Louis\nPhilippe. On the contrary, he seemed quite at his ease in this Tower of\nBabel. Sometimes, when these grotesque personages were storming against\nthe Republic, his eyes would smile, while his lips retained their\nexpression of gravity. His meditative manner of listening, and his\ninvariable complacency, had earned him the sympathy of everyone. He was\nconsidered a nonentity, but a very decent fellow. Whenever an old oil or\nalmond dealer failed to get a hearing, amidst the clamour, for some plan\nby which he could save France if he were only a master, he took himself\noff to Eugene and shouted his marvellous suggestions in his ear. And\nEugene gently nodded his head, as though delighted with the grand\nprojects he was listening to. Vuillet, alone, regarded him with a\nsuspicious eye. This bookseller, half-sacristan and half-journalist,\nspoke less than the others, but was more observant. He had noticed\nthat Eugene occasionally conversed at times in a corner with Commander\nSicardot. So he determined to watch them, but never succeeded in\noverhearing a word. Eugene silenced the commander by a wink whenever\nVuillet approached them. From that time, Sicardot never spoke of the\nNapoleons without a mysterious smile.\n\nTwo days before his return to Paris, Eugene met his brother Aristide, on\nthe Cours Sauvaire, and the latter accompanied him for a short distance\nwith the importunity of a man in search of advice. As a matter of fact,\nAristide was in great perplexity. Ever since the proclamation of the\nRepublic, he had manifested the most lively enthusiasm for the new\ngovernment. His intelligence, sharpened by two years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stay at Paris,\nenabled him to see farther than the thick heads of Plassans. He divined\nthe powerlessness of the Legitimists and Orleanists, without clearly\ndistinguishing, however, what third thief would come and juggle the\nRepublic away. At all hazard he had ranged himself on the side of the\nvictors, and he had severed his connection with his father, whom he\npublicly denounced as an old fool, an old dolt whom the nobility had\nbamboozled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYet my mother is an intelligent woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would add. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should never\nhave thought her capable of inducing her husband to join a party whose\nhopes are simply chimerical. They are taking the right course to end\ntheir lives in poverty. But then women know nothing about politics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor his part he wanted to sell himself as dearly as possible. His great\nanxiety as to the direction in which the wind was blowing, so that he\nmight invariably range himself on the side of that party, which, in\nthe hour of triumph, would be able to reward him munificently.\nUnfortunately, he was groping in the dark. Shut up in his far away\nprovince, without a guide, without any precise information, he felt\nquite lost. While waiting for events to trace out a sure and certain\npath, he preserved the enthusiastic republican attitude which he had\nassumed from the very first day. Thanks to this demeanour, he remained\nat the Sub-Prefecture; and his salary was even raised. Burning, however,\nwith the desire to play a prominent part, he persuaded a bookseller,\none of Vuillet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rivals, to establish a democratic journal, to which\nhe became one of the most energetic contributors. Under his impulse the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant\u00e2\u0080\u009d waged merciless warfare against the reactionaries. But the\ncurrent gradually carried him further than he wished to go; he ended by\nwriting inflammatory articles, which made him shudder when he re-perused\nthem. It was remarked at Plassans that he directed a series of attacks\nagainst all whom his father was in the habit of receiving of an evening\nin his famous yellow drawing-room. The fact is that the wealth of\nRoudier and Granoux exasperated Aristide to such a degree as to make him\nforget all prudence. Urged on by his jealous, insatiate bitterness,\nhe had already made the middle classes his irreconcilable enemy,\nwhen Eugene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival and demeanour at Plassans caused him great\nconsternation. He confessed to himself that his brother was a skilful\nman. According to him, that big, drowsy fellow always slept with one\neye open, like a cat lying in wait before a mouse-hole. And now here was\nEugene spending entire evenings in the yellow drawing-room, and devoting\nhimself to those same grotesque personages whom he, Aristide, had so\nmercilessly ridiculed. When he discovered from the gossip of the town\nthat his brother shook hands with Granoux and the marquis, he asked\nhimself, with considerable anxiety, what was the meaning of it? Could he\nhimself have been deceived? Had the Legitimists or the Orleanists\nreally any chance of success? The thought terrified him. He lost his\nequilibrium, and, as frequently happens, he fell upon the Conservatives\nwith increased rancour, as if to avenge his own blindness.\n\nOn the evening prior to the day when he stopped Eugene on the Cours\nSauvaire, he had published, in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a terrible article\non the intrigues of the clergy, in response to a short paragraph from\nVuillet, who had accused the Republicans of desiring to demolish the\nchurches. Vuillet was Aristide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bugbear. Never a week passed but these\ntwo journalists exchanged the greatest insults. In the provinces,\nwhere a periphrastic style is still cultivated, polemics are clothed in\nhigh-sounding phrases. Aristide called his adversary \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrother Judas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n or \u00e2\u0080\u009cslave of Saint-Anthony.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vuillet gallantly retorted by terming the\nRepublican \u00e2\u0080\u009ca monster glutted with blood whose ignoble purveyor was the\nguillotine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn order to sound his brother, Aristide, who did not dare to appear\nopenly uneasy, contented himself with asking: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you read my article\nyesterday? What do you think of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEugene lightly shrugged his shoulders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a simpleton, brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n was his sole reply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you think Vuillet right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the journalist, turning pale; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nbelieve in Vuillet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s triumph?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI!--Vuillet----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was certainly about to add, \u00e2\u0080\u009cVuillet is as big a fool as you are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n But, observing his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s distorted face anxiously extended towards\nhim, he experienced sudden mistrust. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVuillet has his good points,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncalmly replied.\n\nOn parting from his brother, Aristide felt more perplexed than before.\nEugene must certainly have been making game of him, for Vuillet was\nreally the most abominable person imaginable. However, he determined to\nbe prudent and not tie himself down any more; for he wished to have his\nhands free should he ever be called upon to help any party in strangling\nthe Republic.\n\nEugene, on the morning of his departure, an hour before getting into the\ndiligence, took his father into the bedroom and had a long conversation\nwith him. Felicite, who remained in the drawing-room, vainly tried to\ncatch what they were saying. They spoke in whispers, as if they feared\nlest a single word should be heard outside. When at last they quitted\nthe bedroom they seemed in high spirits. After kissing his father and\nmother, Eugene, who usually spoke in a drawling tone, exclaimed with\nvivacity: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have understood me, father? There lies our fortune. We\nmust work with all our energy in that direction. Trust in me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll follow your instructions faithfully,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rougon replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nforget what I asked you as the price of my cooperation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we succeed your demands shall be satisfied, I give you my word.\nMoreover, I will write to you and guide you according to the direction\nwhich events may take. Mind, no panic or excitement. You must obey me\nimplicitly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have you been plotting there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite asked inquisitively.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eugene replied with a smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have had too\nlittle faith in me thitherto to induce me to confide in you my hopes,\nparticularly as at present they are only based on probabilities. To\nbe able to understand me you would require faith. However, father will\ninform you when the right time comes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, as Felicite assumed the demeanour of a woman who feels somewhat\npiqued, he added in her ear, as he kissed her once more: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI take after\nyou, although you disowned me. Too much intelligence would be dangerous\nat the present moment. When the crisis comes, it is you who will have to\nmanage the business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe then quitted the room, but, suddenly re-opening the door, exclaimed\nin an imperious tone: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbove all things, do not trust Aristide; he is a\nmar-all, who would spoil everything. I have studied him sufficiently to\nfeel certain that he will always fall on his feet. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any\npity; if we make a fortune, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know well enough how to rob us of his\nshare.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Eugene had gone, Felicite endeavoured to ferret out the secret that\nwas being hidden from her. She knew her husband too well to interrogate\nhim openly. He would have angrily replied that it was no business of\nhers. In spite, however, of the clever tactics she pursued, she learnt\nabsolutely nothing. Eugene had chosen a good confidant for those\ntroubled times, when the greatest discretion was necessary. Pierre,\nflattered by his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confidence, exaggerated that passive ponderosity\nwhich made him so impenetrable. When Felicite saw she would not learn\nanything from him, she ceased to flutter round him. On one point only\ndid she remain inquisitive, but in this respect her curiosity was\nintense. The two men had mentioned a price stipulated by Pierre himself.\nWhat could that price be? This after all was the sole point of interest\nfor Felicite, who did not care a rap for political matters. She knew\nthat her husband must have sold himself dearly, but she was burning to\nknow the nature of the bargain. One evening, when they had gone to bed,\nfinding Pierre in a good humour, she brought the conversation round to\nthe discomforts of their poverty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite time to put an end to this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been ruining\nourselves in oil and fuel since those gentlemen have been coming here.\nAnd who will pay the reckoning? Nobody perhaps.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer husband fell into the trap, and smiled with complacent superiority.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPatience,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. And with an air of shrewdness he looked into his\nwife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes and added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you be glad to be the wife of a receiver\nof taxes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face flushed with a joyous glow. She sat up in bed and\nclapped her old withered little hands like a child.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she stammered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt Plassans?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre, without replying, gave a long affirmative nod. He enjoyed his\nconsort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s astonishment and emotion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she at last resumed, half sitting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would have to deposit\nan enormous sum as security. I have heard that our neighbour, Monsieur\nPeirotte, had to deposit eighty thousand francs with the Treasury.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the retired oil-dealer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to do with me; Eugene\nwill see to that. He will get the money advanced by a banker in Paris.\nYou see, I selected an appointment bringing in a good income. Eugene at\nfirst made a wry face, saying one must be rich to occupy such posts, to\nwhich influential men were usually nominated. I persisted, however, and\nhe yielded. To be a receiver of taxes one need not know either Greek\nor Latin. I shall have a representative, like Monsieur Peirotte, and he\nwill do all the work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite listened to him with rapture.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guessed, however,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat it was that worried our dear\nson. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not much liked here. People know that we have no means, and\nwill make themselves obnoxious. But all sorts of things occur in a\ntime of crisis. Eugene wished to get me an appointment in another town.\nHowever, I objected; I want to remain at Plassans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, we must remain here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old woman quickly replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have\nsuffered here, and here we must triumph. Ah! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll crush them all, those\nfine ladies on the Mail, who scornfully eye my woollen dresses! I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nthink of the appointment of receiver of taxes at all; I thought you\nwanted to become mayor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMayor! Nonsense. That appointment is honorary. Eugene also mentioned\nthe mayoralty to me. I replied: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll accept, if you give me an income\nof fifteen thousand francs.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis conversation, in which high figures flew about like rockets, quite\nexcited Felicite. She felt delightfully buoyant. But at last she put on\na devout air, and gravely said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, let us reckon it out. How much\nwill you earn?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pierre, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe fixed salary, I believe, is three thousand\nfrancs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThree thousand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite counted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen there is so much per cent on the receipts, which at Plassans, may\nproduce the sum of twelve thousand francs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat makes fifteen thousand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, about fifteen thousand francs. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what Peirotte earns. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnot all. Peirotte does a little banking business on his own account.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allowed. Perhaps I shall be disposed to make a venture when I feel\nluck on my side.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, let us say twenty thousand. Twenty thousand francs a year!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n repeated Felicite, overwhelmed by the amount.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall have to repay the advances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pierre observed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall be richer than many\nof those gentlemen. Are the marquis and the others going to share the\ncake with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no; it will be all for us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied.\n\nThen, as she continued to importune him with her questions, Pierre\nfrowned, thinking that she wanted to wrest his secret from him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\ntalked enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, abruptly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s late, let us go to sleep. It\nwill bring us bad luck to count our chickens beforehand. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got\nthe place yet. Above all things, be prudent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the lamp was extinguished, Felicite could not sleep. With her eyes\nclosed she built the most marvellous castles in the air. Those twenty\nthousand francs a year danced a diabolical dance before her in the\ndarkness. She occupied splendid apartments in the new town, enjoyed the\nsame luxuries as Monsieur Peirotte, gave parties, and bespattered the\nwhole place with her wealth. That, however, which tickled her vanity\nmost was the high position that her husband would then occupy. He would\npay their state dividends to Granoux, Roudier, and all those people who\nnow came to her house as they might come to a cafe, to swagger and learn\nthe latest news. She had noticed the free-and-easy manner in which these\npeople entered her drawing-room, and it had made her take a dislike to\nthem. Even the marquis, with his ironical politeness, was beginning\nto displease her. To triumph alone, therefore, to keep the cake\nfor themselves, as she expressed it, was a revenge which she fondly\ncherished. Later on, when all those ill-bred persons presented\nthemselves, hats off, before Monsieur Rougon the receiver of taxes,\nshe would crush them in her turn. She was busy with these thoughts all\nnight; and on the morrow, as she opened the shutters, she instinctively\ncast her first glance across the street towards Monsieur Peirotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhouse, and smiled as she contemplated the broad damask curtains hanging\nin the windows.\n\nFelicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hopes, in becoming modified, had grown yet more intense. Like\nall women, she did not object to a tinge of mystery. The secret object\nthat her husband was pursuing excited her far more than the Legitimist\nintrigues of Monsieur de Carnavant had ever done. She abandoned, without\nmuch regret, the calculations she had based on the marquis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success\nnow that her husband declared he would be able to make large profits\nby other means. She displayed, moreover, remarkable prudence and\ndiscretion.\n\nIn reality, she was still tortured by anxious curiosity; she studied\nPierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slightest actions, endeavouring to discover their meaning.\nWhat if by chance he were following the wrong track? What if Eugene were\ndragging them in his train into some break-neck pit, whence they would\nemerge yet more hungry and impoverished? However, faith was dawning\non her. Eugene had commanded with such an air of authority that she\nultimately came to believe in him. In this case again some unknown power\nwas at work. Pierre would speak mysteriously of the high personages whom\ntheir eldest son visited in Paris. For her part she did not know what\nhe could have to do with them, but on the other hand she was unable to\nclose her eyes to Aristide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ill-advised acts at Plassans. The\nvisitors to her drawing-room did not scruple to denounce the democratic\njournalist with extreme severity. Granoux muttered that he was a\nbrigand, and Roudier would three or four times a week repeat to\nFelicite: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour son is writing some fine articles. Only yesterday he\nattacked our friend Vuillet with revolting scurrility.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe whole room joined in the chorus, and Commander Sicardot spoke of\nboxing his son-in-law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears, while Pierre flatly disowned him. The poor\nmother hung her head, restraining her tears. For an instant she felt\nan inclination to burst forth, to tell Roudier that her dear child,\nin spite of his faults, was worth more than he and all the others put\ntogether. But she was tied down, and did not wish to compromise the\nposition they had so laboriously attained. Seeing the whole town so\nbitter against Aristide, she despaired of his future, thinking he was\nhopelessly ruining himself. On two occasions she spoke to him in\nsecret, imploring him to return to them, and not to irritate the yellow\ndrawing-room any further. Aristide replied that she did not understand\nsuch matters; that she was the one who had committed a great blunder in\nplacing her husband at the service of the marquis. So she had to abandon\nher son to his own courses, resolving, however that if Eugene succeeded\nshe would compel him to share the spoils with the poor fellow who was\nher favourite child.\n\nAfter the departure of his eldest son, Pierre Rougon pursued his\nreactionary intrigues. Nothing seemed to have changed in the opinions of\nthe famous yellow drawing-room. Every evening the same men came to join\nin the same propaganda in favour of the establishment of a monarchy,\nwhile the master of the house approved and aided them with as much zeal\nas in the past. Eugene had left Plassans on May 1. A few days later,\nthe yellow drawing-room was in raptures. The gossips were discussing the\nletter of the President of the Republic to General Oudinot, in which\nthe siege of Rome had been decided upon. This letter was regarded as a\nbrilliant victory, due to the firm demeanour of the reactionary party.\nSince 1848 the Chambers had been discussing the Roman question; but it\nhad been reserved for a Bonaparte to stifle a rising Republic by an act\nof intervention which France, if free, would never have countenanced.\nThe marquis declared, however, that one could not better promote the\ncause of legitimacy, and Vuillet wrote a superb article on the matter.\nThe enthusiasm became unbounded when, a month later, Commander Sicardot\nentered the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house one evening and announced to the company\nthat the French army was fighting under the walls of Rome. Then, while\neverybody was raising exclamations at this news, he went up to Pierre,\nand shook hands with him in a significant manner. And when he had taken\na seat, he began to sound the praises of the President of the Republic,\nwho, said he, was the only person able to save France from anarchy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet him save it, then, as quickly as possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted the\nmarquis, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand let him then understand his duty by restoring it to its\nlegitimate masters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre seemed to approve this fine retort, and having thus given\nproof of his ardent royalism, he ventured to remark that Prince Louis\nBonaparte had his entire sympathy in the matter. He thereupon exchanged\na few short sentences with the commander, commending the excellent\nintentions of the President, which sentences one might have thought\nprepared and learnt beforehand. Bonapartism now, for the first time,\nmade its entry into the yellow drawing-room. It is true that since the\nelection of December 10 the Prince had been treated there with a certain\namount of consideration. He was preferred a thousand times to Cavaignac,\nand the whole reactionary party had voted for him. But they regarded\nhim rather as an accomplice than a friend; and, as such, they distrusted\nhim, and even began to accuse him of a desire to keep for himself\nthe chestnuts which he had pulled out of the fire. On that particular\nevening, however, owing to the fighting at Rome, they listened with\nfavour to the praises of Pierre and the commander.\n\nThe group led by Granoux and Roudier already demanded that the President\nshould order all republican rascals to be shot; while the marquis,\nleaning against the mantelpiece, gazed meditatively at a faded rose on\nthe carpet. When he at last lifted his head, Pierre, who had furtively\nwatched his countenance as if to see the effect of his words, suddenly\nceased speaking. However, Monsieur de Carnavant merely smiled and\nglanced at Felicite with a knowing look. This rapid by-play was not\nobserved by the other people. Vuillet alone remarked in a sharp tone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would rather see your Bonaparte at London than at Paris. Our affairs\nwould get along better then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this the old oil-dealer turned slightly pale, fearing that he had\ngone too far. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not anxious to retain \u00e2\u0080\u0098my\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Bonaparte,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with\nsome firmness; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know where I would send him to if I were the master.\nI simply assert that the expedition to Rome was a good stroke.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite had followed this scene with inquisitive astonishment. However,\nshe did not speak of it to her husband, which proved that she adopted it\nas the basis of secret study. The marquis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile, the significance of\nwhich escaped her, set her thinking.\n\nFrom that day forward, Rougon, at distant intervals, whenever the\noccasion offered, slipped in a good word for the President of the\nRepublic. On such evenings, Commander Sicardot acted the part of a\nwilling accomplice. At the same time, Clerical opinions still reigned\nsupreme in the yellow drawing-room. It was more particularly in\nthe following year that this group of reactionaries gained decisive\ninfluence in the town, thanks to the retrograde movement which was going\non at Paris. All those anti-Liberal laws which the country called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nRoman expedition at home\u00e2\u0080\u009d definitively secured the triumph of the Rougon\nfaction. The last enthusiastic bourgeois saw the Republic tottering, and\nhastened to rally round the Conservatives. Thus the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hour had\narrived; the new town almost gave them an ovation on the day when the\ntree of Liberty, planted on the square before the Sub-Prefecture, was\nsawed down. This tree, a young poplar brought from the banks of the\nViorne, had gradually withered, much to the despair of the republican\nworking-men, who would come every Sunday to observe the progress of\nthe decay without being able to comprehend the cause of it. A hatter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\napprentice at last asserted that he had seen a woman leave Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhouse and pour a pail of poisoned water at the foot of the tree. It\nthenceforward became a matter of history that Felicite herself got up\nevery night to sprinkle the poplar with vitriol. When the tree was dead\nthe Municipal Council declared that the dignity of the Republic required\nits removal. For this, as they feared the displeasure of the working\nclasses, they selected an advanced hour of the night. However, the\nconservative householders of the new town got wind of the little\nceremony, and all came down to the square before the Sub-Prefecture in\norder to see how the tree of Liberty would fall. The frequenters of the\nyellow drawing-room stationed themselves at the windows there. When the\npoplar cracked and fell with a thud in the darkness, as tragically rigid\nas some mortally stricken hero, Felicite felt bound to wave a white\nhandkerchief. This induced the crowd to applaud, and many responded to\nthe salute by waving their handkerchiefs likewise. A group of people\neven came under the window shouting: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bury it, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bury it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey meant the Republic, no doubt. Such was Felicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotion, that\nshe almost had a nervous attack. It was a fine evening for the yellow\ndrawing-room.\n\nHowever, the marquis still looked at Felicite with the same mysterious\nsmile. This little old man was far too shrewd to be ignorant of whither\nFrance was tending. He was among the first to scent the coming of the\nEmpire. When the Legislative Assembly, later on, exhausted its energies\nin useless squabbling, when the Orleanists and the Legitimists tacitly\naccepted the idea of the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat, he said to himself that the\ngame was definitely lost. In fact, he was the only one who saw things\nclearly. Vuillet certainly felt that the cause of Henry V., which his\npaper defended, was becoming detestable; but it mattered little to him;\nhe was content to be the obedient creature of the clergy; his entire\npolicy was framed so as to enable him to dispose of as many rosaries and\nsacred images as possible. As for Roudier and Granoux, they lived in\na state of blind scare; it was not certain whether they really had any\nopinions; all that they desired was to eat and sleep in peace; their\npolitical aspirations went no further. The marquis, though he had bidden\nfarewell to his hopes, continued to come to the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as regularly as\never. He enjoyed himself there. The clash of rival ambitions among\nthe middle classes, and the display of their follies, had become an\nextremely amusing spectacle to him. He shuddered at the thought of again\nshutting himself in the little room which he owed to the beneficence of\nthe Count de Valqueyras. With a kind of malicious delight, he kept to\nhimself the conviction that the Bourbons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hour had not yet arrived. He\nfeigned blindness, working as hitherto for the triumph of Legitimacy,\nand still remaining at the orders of the clergy and nobility, though\nfrom the very first day he had penetrated Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new course of action,\nand believed that Felicite was his accomplice.\n\nOne evening, being the first to arrive, he found the old lady alone\nin the drawing-room. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell! little one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, with his smiling\nfamiliarity, \u00e2\u0080\u009care your affairs going on all right? Why the deuce do you\nmake such mysteries with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not hiding anything from you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite replied, somewhat\nperplexed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, do you think you can deceive an old fox like me, eh? My dear\nchild, treat me as a friend. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m quite ready to help you secretly. Come\nnow, be frank!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA bright idea struck Felicite. She had nothing to tell; but perhaps she\nmight find out something if she kept quiet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do you smile?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Monsieur de Carnavant resumed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the beginning\nof a confession, you know. I suspected that you must be behind your\nhusband. Pierre is too stupid to invent the pretty treason you are\nhatching. I sincerely hope the Bonapartists will give you what I should\nhave asked for you from the Bourbons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis single sentence confirmed the suspicions which the old woman had\nentertained for some time past.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPrince Louis has every chance, hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she eagerly inquired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you betray me if I tell you that I believe so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the marquis\nlaughingly replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve donned my mourning over it, little one. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nsimply a poor old man, worn out and only fit to be laid on the shelf.\nIt was for you, however, that I was working. Since you have been able to\nfind the right track without me, I shall feel some consolation in seeing\nyou triumph amidst my own defeat. Above all things, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make any more\nmysteries. Come to me if you are ever in trouble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he added, with the sceptical smile of a nobleman who has lost caste:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw! I also can go in for a little treachery!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this moment the clan of retired oil and almond dealers arrived.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! the dear reactionaries!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Monsieur de Carnavant continued in an\nundertone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, little one, the great art of politics consists in\nhaving a pair of good eyes when other people are blind. You hold all the\nbest cards in the pack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn the following day, Felicite, incited by this conversation, desired\nto make sure on the matter. They were then in the first days of the year\n1851. For more than eighteen months, Rougon had been in the habit of\nreceiving a letter from his son Eugene regularly every fortnight. He\nwould shut himself in the bedroom to read these letters, which he then\nhid at the bottom of an old secretaire, the key of which he carefully\nkept in his waistcoat pocket. Whenever his wife questioned him about\ntheir son he would simply answer: \u00e2\u0080\u009cEugene writes that he is going on\nall right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite had long since thought of laying hands on her son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nletters. So early on the morning after her chat with the marquis, while\nPierre was still asleep, she got up on tiptoes, took the key of the\nsecretaire from her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waistcoat and substituted in its place\nthat of the chest of drawers, which was of the same size. Then, as soon\nas her husband had gone out, she shut herself in the room in her turn,\nemptied the drawer, and read all the letters with feverish curiosity.\n\nMonsieur de Carnavant had not been mistaken, and her own suspicions were\nconfirmed. There were about forty letters, which enabled her to follow\nthe course of that great Bonapartist movement which was to terminate in\nthe second Empire. The letters constituted a sort of concise journal,\nnarrating events as they occurred, and drawing hopes and suggestions\nfrom each of them. Eugene was full of faith. He described Prince Louis\nBonaparte to his father as the predestined necessary man who alone could\nunravel the situation. He had believed in him prior even to his return\nto France, at a time when Bonapartism was treated as a ridiculous\nchimera. Felicite understood that her son had been a very active secret\nagent since 1848. Although he did not clearly explain his position in\nParis, it was evident that he was working for the Empire, under\nthe orders of personages whose names he mentioned with a sort of\nfamiliarity. Each of his letters gave information as to the progress of\nthe cause, to which an early denouement was foreshadowed; and usually\nconcluded by pointing out the line of action that Pierre should pursue\nat Plassans. Felicite could now comprehend certain words and acts of\nher husband, whose significance had previously escaped her; Pierre was\nobeying his son, and blindly following his recommendations.\n\nWhen the old woman had finished reading, she was convinced. Eugene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nentire thoughts were clearly revealed to her. He reckoned upon making\nhis political fortune in the squabble, and repaying his parents the debt\nhe owed them for his education, by throwing them a scrap of the prey as\nsoon as the quarry was secured. However small the assistance his father\nmight render to him and to the cause, it would not be difficult to get\nhim appointed receiver of taxes. Nothing would be refused to one who\nlike Eugene had steeped his hands in the most secret machinations. His\nletters were simply a kind attention on his part, a device to prevent\nthe Rougons from committing any act of imprudence, for which Felicite\nfelt deeply grateful. She read certain passages of the letters twice\nover, notably those in which Eugene spoke, in vague terms, of \u00e2\u0080\u009ca final\ncatastrophe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This catastrophe, the nature or bearings of which she\ncould not well conceive became a sort of end of the world for her. God\nwould range the chosen ones on His right hand and the damned on His\nleft, and she placed herself among the former.\n\nWhen she succeeded in replacing the key in her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waistcoat\npocket on the following night, she made up her mind to employ the same\nexpedient for reading every fresh letter that arrived. She resolved,\nlikewise, to profess complete ignorance. This plan was an excellent one.\nHenceforward, she gave her husband the more assistance as she appeared\nto render it unconsciously. When Pierre thought he was working alone\nit was she who brought the conversation round to the desired topic,\nrecruiting partisans for the decisive moment. She felt hurt at Eugene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndistrust of her. She wanted to be able to say to him, after the triumph:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew all, and so far from spoiling anything, I have secured the\nvictory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Never did an accomplice make less noise or work harder. The\nmarquis, whom she had taken into her confidence, was astounded at it.\n\nThe fate of her dear Aristide, however, continued to make her uneasy.\nNow that she shared the faith of her eldest son, the rabid articles of\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant\u00e2\u0080\u009d alarmed her all the more. She longed to convert the\nunfortunate republican to Napoleonist ideas; but she did not know how\nto accomplish this in a discreet manner. She recalled the emphasis with\nwhich Eugene had told them to be on their guard against Aristide. At\nlast she submitted the matter to Monsieur de Carnavant, who was entirely\nof the same opinion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLittle one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cin politics one must know how to look\nafter one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self. If you were to convert your son, and the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Independant\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nwere to start writing in defence of Bonapartism, it would deal the party\na rude blow. The \u00e2\u0080\u0098Independant\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has already been condemned, its title\nalone suffices to enrage the middle classes of Plassans. Let dear\nAristide flounder about; this only moulds young people. He does not\nappear to me to be cut out for carrying on the role of a martyr for any\nlength of time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever, in her eagerness to point out the right way to her family,\nnow that she believed herself in possession of the truth, Felicite even\nsought to convert her son Pascal. The doctor, with the egotism of a\nscientist immersed in his researches, gave little heed to politics.\nEmpires might fall while he was making an experiment, yet he would not\nhave deigned to turn his head. He at last yielded, however, to certain\nimportunities of his mother, who accused him more than ever of living\nlike an unsociable churl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you were to go into society,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would get some\nwell-to-do patients. Come, at least, and spend some evenings in our\ndrawing-room. You will make the acquaintance of Messieurs Roudier,\nGranoux, and Sicardot, all gentlemen in good circumstances, who will pay\nyou four or five francs a visit. The poor people will never enrich you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe idea of succeeding in life, of seeing all her family attain to\nfortune, had become a form of monomania with Felicite. Pascal, in order\nto be agreeable to her, came and spent a few evenings in the yellow\ndrawing-room. He was much less bored there than he had apprehended. At\nfirst he was rather stupefied at the degree of imbecility to which\nsane men can sink. The old oil and almond dealers, the marquis and the\ncommander even, appeared to him so many curious animals, which he\nhad not hitherto had an opportunity of studying. He looked with a\nnaturalist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest at their grimacing faces, in which he discerned\ntraces of their occupations and appetites; he listened also to their\ninane chatter, just as he might have tried to catch the meaning of\na cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mew or a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bark. At this period he was occupied with\ncomparative natural history, applying to the human race the observations\nwhich he had made upon animals with regard to the working of heredity.\nWhile he was in the yellow drawing-room, therefore, he amused himself\nwith the belief that he had fallen in with a menagerie. He established\ncomparisons between the grotesque creatures he found there and certain\nanimals of his acquaintance. The marquis, with his leanness and small\ncrafty-looking head, reminded him exactly of a long green grasshopper.\nVuillet impressed him as a pale, slimy toad. He was more considerate for\nRoudier, a fat sheep, and for the commander, an old toothless mastiff.\nBut the prodigious Granoux was a perpetual cause of astonishment to him.\nHe spent a whole evening measuring this imbecile\u00e2\u0080\u0099s facial angle. When he\nheard him mutter indistinct imprecations against those blood-suckers\nthe Republicans, he always expected to hear him moan like a calf; and\nhe could never see him rise from his chair without imagining that he was\nabout to leave the room on all fours.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTalk to them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his mother used to say in an undertone; \u00e2\u0080\u009ctry and make a\npractice out of these gentlemen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not a veterinary surgeon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he at last replied, exasperated.\n\nOne evening Felicite took him into a corner and tired to catechise\nhim. She was glad to see him come to her house rather assiduously.\nShe thought him reconciled to Society, not suspecting for a moment the\nsingular amusement that he derived from ridiculing these rich people.\nShe cherished the secret project of making him the fashionable doctor\nof Plassans. It would be sufficient if men like Granoux and Roudier\nconsented to give him a start. She wished, above all, to impart to\nhim the political views of the family, considering that a doctor had\neverything to gain by constituting himself a warm partisan of the regime\nwhich was to succeed the Republic.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas you have now become reasonable,\nyou must give some thought to the future. You are accused of being a\nRepublican, because you are foolish enough to attend all the beggars\nof the town without making any charge. Be frank, what are your real\nopinions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal looked at his mother with na\u00c3\u00afve astonishment, then with a smile\nreplied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy real opinions? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite know--I am accused of being a\nRepublican, did you say? Very well! I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel at all offended. I\nam undoubtedly a Republican, if you understand by that word a man who\nwishes the welfare of everybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you will never attain to any position,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite quickly\ninterrupted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will be crushed. Look at your brothers, they are\ntrying to make their way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal then comprehended that he was not called upon to defend his\nphilosophic egotism. His mother simply accused him of not speculating\non the political situation. He began to laugh somewhat sadly, and then\nturned the conversation into another channel. Felicite could never\ninduce him to consider the chances of the various parties, nor to enlist\nin that one of them which seemed likely to carry the day. However, he\nstill occasionally came to spend an evening in the yellow drawing-room.\nGranoux interested him like an antediluvian animal.\n\nIn the meantime, events were moving. The year 1851 was a year of anxiety\nand apprehension for the politicians of Plassans, and the cause which\nthe Rougons served derived advantage from this circumstance. The most\ncontradictory news arrived from Paris; sometimes the Republicans were\nin the ascendant, sometimes the Conservative party was crushing the\nRepublic. The echoes of the squabbles which were rending the Legislative\nAssembly reached the depths of the provinces, now in an exaggerated, now\nin an attenuated form, varying so greatly as to obscure the vision of\nthe most clear-sighted. The only general feeling was that a denouement\nwas approaching. The prevailing ignorance as to the nature of this\ndenouement kept timid middle class people in a terrible state of\nanxiety. Everybody wished to see the end. They were sick of uncertainty,\nand would have flung themselves into the arms of the Grand Turk, if he\nwould have deigned to save France from anarchy.\n\nThe marquis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile became more acute. Of an evening, in the yellow\ndrawing-room, when Granoux\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growl was rendered indistinct by fright, he\nwould draw near to Felicite and whisper in her ear: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, little one,\nthe fruit is ripe--but you must make yourself useful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite, who continued to read Eugene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letters, and knew that\na decisive crisis might any day occur, had already often felt the\nnecessity of making herself useful, and reflected as to the manner in\nwhich the Rougons should employ themselves. At last she consulted the\nmarquis.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt all depends upon circumstances,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the little old man replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the\ndepartment remains quiet, if no insurrection occurs to terrify Plassans,\nit will be difficult for you to make yourselves conspicuous and render\nany services to the new government. I advise you, in that case, to\nremain at home, and peacefully await the bounties of your son Eugene.\nBut if the people rise, and our brave bourgeois think themselves in\ndanger, there will be a fine part to play. Your husband is somewhat\nheavy--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Felicite, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll undertake to make him supple. Do you think\nthe department will revolt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo my mind it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a certainty. Plassans, perhaps, will not make a\nstir; the reaction has secured too firm a hold here for that. But the\nneighbouring towns, especially the small ones and the villages, have\nlong been worked by certain secret societies, and belong to the advanced\nRepublican party. If a Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat should burst forth, the tocsin will\nbe heard throughout the entire country, from the forests of the Seille\nto the plateau of Sainte-Roure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite reflected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou think, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she resumed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat an\ninsurrection is necessary to ensure our fortune!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Monsieur de Carnavant. And he added, with a\nslightly ironical smile: \u00e2\u0080\u009cA new dynasty is never founded excepting upon\nan affray. Blood is good manure. It will be a fine thing for the Rougons\nto date from a massacre, like certain illustrious families.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese words, accompanied by a sneer, sent a cold chill through\nFelicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bones. But she was a strong-minded woman, and the sight of\nMonsieur Peirotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beautiful curtains, which she religiously viewed\nevery morning, sustained her courage. Whenever she felt herself\ngiving way, she planted herself at the window and contemplated the\ntax-receiver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. For her it was the Tuileries. She had determined\nupon the most extreme measures in order to secure an entree into the new\ntown, that promised land, on the threshold of which she had stood with\nburning longing for so many years.\n\nThe conversation which she had held with the marquis had at last clearly\nrevealed the situation to her. A few days afterwards, she succeeded in\nreading one of Eugene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letters, in which he, who was working for the\nCoup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat, seemed also to rely upon an insurrection as the means of\nendowing his father with some importance. Eugene knew his department\nwell. All his suggestions had been framed with the object of placing\nas much influence as possible in the hands of the yellow drawing-room\nreactionaries, so that the Rougons might be able to hold the town at the\ncritical moment. In accordance with his desires, the yellow drawing-room\nwas master of Plassans in November, 1851. Roudier represented the rich\ncitizens there, and his attitude would certainly decide that of the\nentire new town. Granoux was still more valuable; he had the Municipal\nCouncil behind him: he was its most powerful member, a fact which\nwill give some idea of its other members. Finally, through Commander\nSicardot, whom the marquis had succeeded in getting appointed as chief\nof the National Guard, the yellow drawing-room had the armed forces at\ntheir disposal.\n\nThe Rougons, those poor disreputable devils, had thus succeeded\nin rallying round themselves the instruments of their own fortune.\nEveryone, from cowardice or stupidity, would have to obey them and work\nin the dark for their aggrandisement. They simply had to fear those\nother influences which might be working with the same object as\nthemselves, and might partially rob them of the merit of victory. That\nwas their great fear, for they wanted to reserve to themselves the role\nof deliverers. They knew beforehand that they would be aided rather than\nhindered by the clergy and the nobility. But if the sub-prefect, the\nmayor, and the other functionaries were to take a step in advance and at\nonce stifle the insurrection they would find themselves thrown into the\nshade, and even arrested in their exploits; they would have neither time\nnor means to make themselves useful. What they longed for was complete\nabstention, general panic among the functionaries. If only all regular\nadministration should disappear, and they could dispose of the destinies\nof Plassans for a single day, their fortune would be firmly established.\n\nHappily for them, there was not a man in the government service whose\nconvictions were so firm or whose circumstances were so needy as to\nmake him disposed to risk the game. The sub-prefect was a man of liberal\nspirit whom the executive had forgetfully left at Plassans, owing, no\ndoubt, to the good repute of the town. Of timid character and incapable\nof exceeding his authority, he would no doubt be greatly embarrassed in\nthe presence of an insurrection. The Rougons, who knew that he was in\nfavour of the democratic cause, and who consequently never dreaded his\nzeal, were simply curious to know what attitude he would assume. As for\nthe municipality, this did not cause them much apprehension. The mayor,\nMonsieur Garconnet, was a Legitimist whose nomination had been procured\nby the influence of the Saint-Marc quarter in 1849. He detested the\nRepublicans and treated them with undisguised disdain; but he was too\nclosely united by bonds of friendship with certain members of the\nchurch to lend any active hand in a Bonapartist Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat. The other\nfunctionaries were in exactly the same position. The justices of the\npeace, the post-master, the tax-collector, as well as Monsieur Peirotte,\nthe chief receiver of taxes, were all indebted for their posts to\nthe Clerical reaction, and could not accept the Empire with any great\nenthusiasm. The Rougons, though they did not quite see how they might\nget rid of these people and clear the way for themselves, nevertheless\nindulged in sanguine hopes on finding there was little likelihood of\nanybody disputing their role as deliverers.\n\nThe denouement was drawing near. In the last few days of November, as\nthe rumour of a Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat was circulating, the prince-president was\naccused of seeking the position of emperor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEh! we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call him whatever he likes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Granoux exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cprovided he\nhas those Republican rascals shot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis exclamation from Granoux, who was believed to be asleep, caused\ngreat commotion. The marquis pretended not to have heard it; but all\nthe bourgeois nodded approval. Roudier, who, being rich, did not fear to\napplaud the sentiment aloud, went so far as to declare, while glancing\naskance at Monsieur de Carnavant, that the position was no longer\ntenable, and that France must be chastised as soon as possible, never\nmind by what hand.\n\nThe marquis still maintained a silence which was interpreted as\nacquiescence. And thereupon the Conservative clan, abandoning the cause\nof Legitimacy, ventured to offer up prayers in favour of the Empire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Commander Sicardot, rising from his seat, \u00e2\u0080\u009conly a\nNapoleon can now protect threatened life and property. Have no fear,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken the necessary precautions to preserve order at Plassans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs a matter of fact the commander, in concert with Rougon, had\nconcealed, in a kind of cart-house near the ramparts, both a supply of\ncartridges and a considerable number of muskets; he had also taken steps\nto secure the co-operation of the National Guard, on which he believed\nhe could rely. His words produced a very favourable impression.\nOn separating for the evening, the peaceful citizens of the yellow\ndrawing-room spoke of massacring the \u00e2\u0080\u009cReds\u00e2\u0080\u009d if they should dare to stir.\n\nOn December 1, Pierre Rougon received a letter from Eugene which he went\nto read in his bedroom, in accordance with his prudent habit. Felicite\nobserved, however, that he was very agitated when he came out again.\nShe fluttered round the secretaire all day. When night came, she could\nrestrain her impatience no longer. Her husband had scarcely fallen\nasleep, when she quietly got up, took the key of the secretaire from\nthe waistcoat pocket, and gained possession of the letter with as little\nnoise as possible. Eugene, in ten lines, warned his father that the\ncrisis was at hand, and advised him to acquaint his mother with the\nsituation of affairs. The hour for informing her had arrived; he might\nstand in need of her advice.\n\nFelicite awaited, on the morrow, a disclosure which did not come. She\ndid not dare to confess her curiosity; but continued to feign ignorance,\nthough enraged at the foolish distrust of her husband, who, doubtless,\nconsidered her a gossip, and weak like other women. Pierre, with\nthat marital pride which inspires a man with the belief in his own\nsuperiority at home, had ended by attributing all their past ill-luck to\nhis wife. From the time that he fancied he had been conducting matters\nalone everything seemed to him to have gone as he desired. He had\ndecided, therefore, to dispense altogether with his consort\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counsels,\nand to confide nothing to her, in spite of his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recommendations.\n\nFelicite was piqued to such a degree that she would have upset the whole\naffair had she not desired the triumph as ardently as Pierre. So she\ncontinued to work energetically for victory, while endeavouring to take\nher revenge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! if he could only have some great fright,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought she; \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he would\nonly commit some act of imprudence! Then I should see him come to me and\nhumbly ask for advice; it would be my turn to lay down the law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe felt somewhat uneasy at the imperious attitude Pierre would\ncertainly assume if he were to triumph without her aid. On marrying this\npeasant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, in preference to some notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clerk, she had intended to\nmake use of him as a strongly made puppet, whose strings she would pull\nin her own way; and now, at the decisive moment, the puppet, in his\nblind stupidity, wanted to work alone! All the cunning, all the feverish\nactivity within the old woman protested against this. She knew Pierre\nwas quite capable of some brutal resolve such as that which he had taken\nwhen he compelled his mother to sign the receipt for fifty thousand\nfrancs; the tool was indeed a useful and unscrupulous one; but she felt\nthe necessity for guiding it, especially under present circumstances,\nwhen considerable suppleness was requisite.\n\nThe official news of the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat did not reach Plassans until the\nafternoon of December 3--a Thursday. Already, at seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the\nevening, there was a full meeting in the yellow drawing-room. Although\nthe crisis had been eagerly desired, vague uneasiness appeared on the\nfaces of the majority. They discussed events amid endless chatter.\nPierre, who like the others was slightly pale, thought it right, as an\nextreme measure of prudence, to excuse Prince Louis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decisive act to\nthe Legitimists and Orleanists who were present.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is talk of an appeal to the people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe nation will\nthen be free to choose whatever government it likes. The president is a\nman to retire before our legitimate masters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe marquis, who had retained his aristocratic coolness, was the only\none who greeted these words with a smile. The others, in the enthusiasm\nof the moment, concerned themselves very little about what might follow.\nAll their opinions foundered. Roudier, forgetting the esteem which as a\nformer shopkeeper he had entertained for the Orleanists, stopped Pierre\nrather abruptly. And everybody exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t argue the matter. Let\nus think of preserving order.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese good people were terribly afraid of the Republicans. There had,\nhowever been very little commotion in the town on the announcement of\nthe events in Paris. People had collected in front of the notices posted\non the door of the Sub-Prefecture; it was also rumoured that a few\nhundred workmen had left their work and were endeavouring to organise\nresistance. That was all. No serious disturbance seemed likely to occur.\nThe course which the neighbouring towns and rural districts might take\nseemed more likely to occasion anxiety; however, it was not yet known\nhow they had received the news of the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat.\n\nGranoux arrived at about nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, quite out of breath. He had just\nleft a sitting of the Municipal Council which had been hastily summoned\ntogether. Choking with emotion, he announced that the mayor, Monsieur\nGarconnet, had declared, while making due reserves, that he was\ndetermined to preserve order by the most stringent measures. However,\nthe intelligence which caused the noisiest chattering in the yellow\ndrawing-room was that of the resignation of the sub-prefect. This\nfunctionary had absolutely refused to communicate the despatches of the\nMinister of the Interior to the inhabitants of Plassans; he had just\nleft the town, so Granoux asserted, and it was thanks to the mayor that\nthe messages had been posted. This was perhaps the only sub-prefect in\nFrance who ever had the courage of his democratic opinions.\n\nAlthough Monsieur Garconnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firm demeanour caused the Rougons\nsome secret anxiety, they rubbed their hands at the flight of the\nsub-prefect, which left the post vacant for them. It was decided on this\nmemorable evening that the yellow drawing-room party should accept the\nCoup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat and openly declare that it was in favour of accomplished\nfacts. Vuillet was commissioned to write an article to that effect, and\npublish it on the morrow in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGazette.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Neither he nor the marquis\nraised any objection. They had, no doubt, received instructions from the\nmysterious individuals to whom they sometimes made pious allusions. The\nclergy and the nobility were already resigned to the course of lending\na strong hand to the victors, in order to crush their common enemy, the\nRepublic.\n\nWhile the yellow drawing-room was deliberating on the evening in\nquestion, Aristide was perspiring with anxiety. Never had gambler,\nstaking his last louis on a card, felt such anguish. During the day the\nresignation of his chief, the sub-prefect, had given him much matter for\nreflection. He had heard him repeat several times that the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat\nmust prove a failure. This functionary, endowed with a limited amount of\nhonesty, believed in the final triumph of the democracy, though he\nhad not the courage to work for that triumph by offering resistance.\nAristide was in the habit of listening at the doors of the\nSub-Prefecture, in order to get precise information, for he felt that he\nwas groping in the dark, and clung to the intelligence which he gleaned\nfrom the officials. The sub-prefect\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion struck him forcibly; but\nhe remained perplexed. He thought to himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy does the fellow go\naway if he is so certain that the prince-president will meet with a\ncheck?\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, as he was compelled to espouse one side or the other,\nhe resolved to continue his opposition. He wrote a very hostile article\non the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat, and took it to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant\u00e2\u0080\u009d the same evening\nfor the following morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issue. He had corrected the proofs of this\narticle, and was returning home somewhat calmed, when, as he passed\nalong the Rue de la Banne, he instinctively raised his head and glanced\nat the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 windows. Their windows were brightly lighted up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can they be plotting up there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the journalist asked himself, with\nanxious curiosity.\n\nA fierce desire to know the opinion of the yellow drawing-room with\nregard to recent events then assailed him. He credited this group of\nreactionaries with little intelligence; but his doubts recurred, he was\nin that frame of mind when one might seek advice from a child. He\ncould not think of entering his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home at that moment, after the\ncampaign he had waged against Granoux and the others. Nevertheless, he\nwent upstairs, reflecting what a singular figure he would cut if he were\nsurprised on the way by anyone. On reaching the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 door, he could\nonly catch a confused echo of voices.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a child I am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfear makes me stupid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he was going\nto descend again, when he heard the approach of his mother, who was\nabout to show somebody out. He had barely time to hide in a dark corner\nformed by a little staircase leading to the garrets of the house. The\nRougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 door opened, and the marquis appeared, followed by Felicite.\nMonsieur de Carnavant usually left before the gentlemen of the new town\ndid, in order no doubt to avoid having to shake hands with them in the\nstreet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEh! little one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said on the landing, in a low voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese men are\ngreater cowards than I should have thought. With such men France will\nalways be at the mercy of whoever dares to lay his hands upon her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n And he added, with some bitterness, as though speaking to himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nmonarchy is decidedly becoming too honest for modern times. Its day is\nover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEugene announced the crisis to his father,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Felicite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPrince\nLouis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s triumph seems to him certain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you can proceed without fear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the marquis replied, as he descended\nthe first steps. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn two or three days the country will be well bound\nand gagged. Good-bye till to-morrow, little one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite closed the door again. Aristide had received quite a shock in\nhis dark corner. However, without waiting for the marquis to reach the\nstreet, he bounded down the staircase, four steps at a time, rushed\noutside like a madman, and turned his steps towards the printing-office\nof the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A flood of thoughts surged through his mind. He\nwas enraged, and accused his family of having duped him. What! Eugene\nkept his parents informed of the situation, and yet his mother had never\ngiven him any of his eldest brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letters to read, in order that he\nmight follow the advice given therein! And it was only now he learnt by\nchance that his eldest brother regarded the success of the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat\nas certain! This circumstance, moreover, confirmed certain presentiments\nwhich that idiot of a sub-prefect had prevented him from obeying. He was\nespecially exasperated against his father, whom he had thought stupid\nenough to be a Legitimist, but who revealed himself as a Bonapartist at\nthe right moment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a lot of folly they have allowed me to perpetrate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered as\nhe ran along. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a fine fellow now. Ah! what a lesson! Granoux is more\ncapable than I.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe entered the office of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant\u00e2\u0080\u009d like a hurricane, and\nasked for his article in a choking voice. The article had already been\nimposed. He had the forme unlocked and would not rest until he had\nhimself destroyed the setting, mixing the type in a furious manner, like\na set of dominoes. The bookseller who managed the paper looked at him\nin amazement. He was, in reality, rather glad of the incident, as the\narticle had seemed to him somewhat dangerous. But he was absolutely\nobliged to have some copy, if the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant\u00e2\u0080\u009d was to appear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you going to give me something else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Aristide.\n\nHe sat down at the table and began a warm panegyric on the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat.\nAt the very first line, he swore that Prince Louis had just saved the\nRepublic; but he had hardly written a page before he stopped and seemed\nat a loss how to continue. A troubled look came over his pole-cat face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must go home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will send you this immediately.\nYour paper can appear a little later, if necessary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe walked slowly on his way home, lost in meditation. He was again\ngiving way to indecision. Why should he veer round so quickly? Eugene\nwas an intelligent fellow, but his mother had perhaps exaggerated the\nsignificance of some sentence in his letter. In any case, it would be\nbetter to wait and hold his tongue.\n\nAn hour later Angele called at the bookseller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, feigning deep emotion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy husband has just severely injured himself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe jammed his\nfour fingers in a door as he was coming in. In spite of his sufferings,\nhe has dictated this little note, which he begs you to publish\nto-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn the following day the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d made up almost entirely of\nmiscellaneous items of news, appeared with these few lines at the head\nof the first column:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA deplorable accident which has occurred to our eminent contributor\nMonsieur Aristide Rougon will deprive us of his articles for some\ntime. He will suffer at having to remain silent in the present grave\ncircumstances. None of our readers will doubt, however, the good wishes\nwhich he offers up with patriotic feelings for the welfare of France.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis burlesque note had been maturely studied. The last sentence might\nbe interpreted in favour of all parties. By this expedient, Aristide\ndevised a glorious return for himself on the morrow of battle, in the\nshape of a laudatory article on the victors. On the following day he\nshowed himself to the whole town, with his arm in a sling. His mother,\nfrightened by the notice in the paper, hastily called upon him, but\nhe refused to show her his hand, and spoke with a bitterness which\nenlightened the old woman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a reassuring and somewhat sarcastic\ntone, as she was leaving. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou only want a little rest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was no doubt owing to this pretended accident, and the sub-prefect\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndeparture, that the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant\u00e2\u0080\u009d was not interfered with, like most of\nthe democratic papers of the departments.\n\nThe 4th day of the month proved comparatively quiet at Plassans. In the\nevening there was a public demonstration which the mere appearance\nof the gendarmes sufficed to disperse. A band of working-men came to\nrequest Monsieur Garconnet to communicate the despatches he had received\nfrom Paris, which the latter haughtily refused to do; as it retired\nthe band shouted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLong live the Republic! Long live the Constitution!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n After this, order was restored. The yellow drawing-room, after\ncommenting at some length on this innocent parade, concluded that\naffairs were going on excellently.\n\nThe 5th and 6th were, however, more disquieting. Intelligence was\nreceived of successive risings in small neighbouring towns; the\nwhole southern part of the department had taken up arms; La Palud and\nSaint-Martin-de-Vaulx had been the first to rise, drawing after them\nthe villages of Chavanos, Nazeres, Poujols, Valqueyras and Vernoux. The\nyellow drawing-room party was now becoming seriously alarmed. It felt\nparticularly uneasy at seeing Plassans isolated in the very midst of the\nrevolt. Bands of insurgents would certainly scour the country and cut\noff all communications. Granoux announced, with a terrified look, that\nthe mayor was without any news. Some people even asserted that blood had\nbeen shed at Marseilles, and that a formidable revolution had broken out\nin Paris. Commander Sicardot, enraged at the cowardice of the bourgeois,\nvowed he would die at the head of his men.\n\nOn Sunday the 7th the terror reached a climax. Already at six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock\nthe yellow drawing-room, where a sort of reactionary committee sat _en\npermanence_, was crowded with pale, trembling men, who conversed in\nundertones, as though they were in a chamber of death. It had been\nascertained during the day that a column of insurgents, about three\nthousand strong, had assembled at Alboise, a big village not more than\nthree leagues away. It was true that this column had been ordered to\nmake for the chief town of the department, leaving Plassans on its left;\nbut the plan of campaign might at any time be altered; moreover, it\nsufficed for these cowardly cits to know that there were insurgents a\nfew miles off, to make them feel the horny hands of the toilers already\ntightened round their throats. They had had a foretaste of the revolt in\nthe morning; the few Republicans at Plassans, seeing that they would\nbe unable to make any determined move in the town, had resolved to join\ntheir brethren of La Palud and Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx; the first group\nhad left at about eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, by the Porte de Rome, shouting the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarseillaise\u00e2\u0080\u009d and smashing a few windows. Granoux had had one broken.\nHe mentioned the circumstance with stammerings of terror.\n\nMeantime, the most acute anxiety agitated the yellow drawing-room. The\ncommander had sent his servant to obtain some information as to the\nexact movements of the insurgents, and the others awaited this man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nreturn, making the most astonishing surmises. They had a full meeting.\nRoudier and Granoux, sinking back in their arm-chairs, exchanged the\nmost pitiable glances, whilst behind them moaned a terror-stricken group\nof retired tradesmen. Vuillet, without appearing over scared, reflected\nupon what precautions he should take to protect his shop and person; he\nwas in doubt whether he should hide himself in his garret or cellar,\nand inclined towards the latter. For their part Pierre and the commander\nwalked up and down, exchanging a word ever and anon. The old oil-dealer\nclung to this friend Sicardot as if to borrow a little courage from\nhim. He, who had been awaiting the crisis for such a long time, now\nendeavoured to keep his countenance, in spite of the emotion which was\nstifling him. As for the marquis, more spruce and smiling than usual, he\nconversed in a corner with Felicite, who seemed very gay.\n\nAt last a ring came. The gentlemen started as if they had heard a\ngun-shot. Dead silence reigned in the drawing-room when Felicite went to\nopen the door, towards which their pale, anxious faces were turned. Then\nthe commander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servant appeared on the threshold, quite out of breath,\nand said abruptly to his master: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, the insurgents will be here in an\nhour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was a thunderbolt. They all started up, vociferating, and raising\ntheir arms towards the ceiling. For several minutes it was impossible\nto hear one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self speak. The company surrounded the messenger,\noverwhelming him with questions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDamnation!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the commander at length shouted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make such a row. Be\ncalm, or I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer for anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEveryone sank back in his chair again, heaving long-drawn sighs. They\nthen obtained a few particulars. The messenger had met the column at Les\nTulettes, and had hastened to return.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are at least three thousand of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are marching\nin battalions, like soldiers. I thought I caught sight of some prisoners\nin their midst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPrisoners!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the terrified bourgeois.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the marquis interrupted in his shrill voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nheard that the insurgents arrest all persons who are known to have\nconservative leanings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis information gave a finishing touch to the consternation of the\nyellow drawing-room. A few bourgeois got up and stealthily made for the\ndoor, reflecting that they had not too much time before them to gain a\nplace of safety.\n\nThe announcement of the arrests made by the Republicans appeared to\nstrike Felicite. She took the marquis aside and asked him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do\nthese men do with the people they arrest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, they carry them off in their train,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Monsieur de Carnavant\nreplied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey no doubt consider them excellent hostages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old woman rejoined, in a strange tone.\n\nThen she again thoughtfully watched the curious scene of panic around\nher. The bourgeois gradually disappeared; soon there only remained\nVuillet and Roudier, whom the approaching danger inspired with some\ncourage. As for Granoux, he likewise remained in his corner, his legs\nrefusing to perform their office.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I like this better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sicardot remarked, as he observed the flight\nof the other adherents. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose cowards were exasperating me at last.\nFor more than two years they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been speaking of shooting all the\nRepublicans in the province, and to-day they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even fire a\nhalfpenny cracker under their noses.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he took up his hat and turned towards the door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctime presses. Come, Rougon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite, it seemed, had been waiting for this moment. She placed\nherself between the door and her husband, who, for that matter, was not\nparticularly eager to follow the formidable Sicardot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have you go out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, feigning sudden despair. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlet you leave my side. Those scoundrels will kill you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe commander stopped in amazement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHang it all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he growled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif the women are going to whine now--Come\nalong, Rougon!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the old woman, affecting increase of terror, \u00e2\u0080\u009che\nsha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow you. I will hang on to his clothes and prevent him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe marquis, very much surprised at the scene, looked inquiringly at\nFelicite. Was this really the woman who had just now been conversing so\nmerrily? What comedy was she playing? Pierre, meantime, seeing that his\nwife wanted to detain him, deigned a determination to force his way out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you you shall not go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old woman reiterated, as she clung\nto one of his arms. And turning towards the commander, she said to him:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can you think of offering any resistance? They are three thousand\nstrong, and you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to collect a hundred men of any spirit.\nYou are rushing into the cannon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth to no purpose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEh! that is our duty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sicardot, impatiently.\n\nFelicite burst into sobs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill him, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make him a prisoner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued,\nlooked fixedly at her husband. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood heavens! What will become of me,\nleft alone in an abandoned town?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the commander, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall be arrested just the same if\nwe allow the insurgents to enter the town unmolested. I believe that\nbefore an hour has elapsed the mayor and all the functionaries will be\nprisoners, to say nothing of your husband and the frequenters of this\ndrawing-room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe marquis thought he saw a vague smile play about Felicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips as\nshe answered, with a look of dismay: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you really think so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Sicardot; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Republicans are not so stupid as\nto leave enemies behind them. To-morrow Plassans will be emptied of its\nfunctionaries and good citizens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt these words, which she had so cleverly provoked, Felicite released\nher husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms. Pierre no longer looked as if he wanted to go out.\nThanks to his wife, whose skilful tactics escaped him, however, and\nwhose secret complicity he never for a moment suspected, he had just\nlighted on a whole plan of campaign.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must deliberate before taking any decision,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to the\ncommander. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy wife is perhaps not wrong in accusing us of forgetting\nthe true interests of our families.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, indeed, madame is not wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Granoux, who had been listening\nto Felicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrified cries with the rapture of a coward.\n\nThereupon the commander energetically clapped his hat on his head, and\nsaid in a clear voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRight or wrong, it matters little to me. I am\ncommander of the National Guard. I ought to have been at the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbefore now. Confess that you are afraid, that you leaven me to act\nalone. . . . Well, good-night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was just turning the handle of the door, when Rougon forcibly\ndetained him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, Sicardot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nHe drew him into a corner, on seeing Vuillet prick up his big ears. And\nthere he explained to him, in an undertone, that it would be a good plan\nto leave a few energetic men behind the insurgents, so as to restore\norder in the town. And as the fierce commander obstinately refused to\ndesert his post, Pierre offered to place himself at the head of such a\nreserve corps.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me the key of the cart-shed in which the arms and ammunition are\nkept,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand order some fifty of our men not to stir\nuntil I call for them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSicardot ended by consenting to these prudent measures. He entrusted\nPierre with the key of the cart-shed, convinced as he was of the\ninexpediency of present resistance, but still desirous of sacrificing\nhimself.\n\nDuring this conversation, the marquis had whispered a few words in\nFelicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear with a knowing look. He complimented her, no doubt, on\nher theatrical display. The old woman could not repress a faint smile.\nBut, as Sicardot shook hands with Rougon and prepared to go, she again\nasked him with an air of fright: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you really determined to leave\nus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not for one of Napoleon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old soldiers to let himself be\nintimidated by the mob,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied.\n\nHe was already on the landing, when Granoux hurried after him, crying:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you go to the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tell him what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just run home\nto my wife to reassure her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Felicite bent towards the marquis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear, and whispered with\ndiscreet gaiety: \u00e2\u0080\u009cUpon my word, it is best that devil of a commander\nshould go and get himself arrested. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s far too zealous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever, Rougon brought Granoux back to the drawing-room. Roudier, who\nhad quietly followed the scene from his corner, making signs in support\nof the proposed measures of prudence, got up and joined them. When the\nmarquis and Vuillet had likewise risen, Pierre began:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow that we are alone, among peaceable men, I propose that we should\nconceal ourselves so as to avoid certain arrest, and be at liberty as\nsoon as ours again becomes the stronger party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGranoux was ready to embrace him. Roudier and Vuillet breathed more\neasily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall want you shortly, gentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the oil-dealer continued, with\nan important air. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is to us that the honour of restoring order in\nPlassans is reserved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may rely upon us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Vuillet, with an enthusiasm which\ndisturbed Felicite.\n\nTime was pressing. These singular defenders of Plassans, who hid\nthemselves the better to protect the town, hastened away, to bury\nthemselves in some hole or other. Pierre, on being left alone with\nhis wife, advised her not to make the mistake of barricading herself\nindoors, but to reply, if anybody came to question her, that he, Pierre,\nhad simply gone on a short journey. And as she acted the simpleton,\nfeigning terror and asking what all this was coming to, he replied\nabruptly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to do with you. Let me manage our affairs alone.\nThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get on all the better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA few minutes later he was rapidly threading his way along the Rue de\nla Banne. On reaching the Cours Sauvaire, he saw a band of armed workmen\ncoming out of the old quarter and singing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarseillaise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe devil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was quite time, indeed; here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the town\nitself in revolt now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe quickened his steps in the direction of the Porte de Rome. Cold\nperspiration came over him while he waited there for the dilatory keeper\nto open the gate. Almost as soon as he set foot on the high road, he\nperceived in the moonlight at the other end of the Faubourg the column\nof insurgents, whose gun barrels gleamed like white flames. So it was\nat a run that he dived into the Impasse Saint-Mittre, and reached his\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, which he had not visited for many a long year.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAntoine Macquart had returned to Plassans after the fall of the first\nNapoleon. He had had the incredible good fortune to escape all the\nfinal murderous campaigns of the Empire. He had moved from barracks\nto barracks, dragging on his brutifying military life. This mode of\nexistence brought his natural vices to full development. His idleness\nbecame deliberate; his intemperance, which brought him countless\npunishments, became, to his mind, a veritable religious duty. But that\nwhich above all made him the worst of scapegraces was the supercilious\ndisdain which he entertained for the poor devils who had to earn their\nbread.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got money waiting for me at home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he often said to his comrades;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve served my time, I shall be able to live like a gentleman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis belief, together with his stupid ignorance, prevented him from\nrising even to the grade of corporal.\n\nSince his departure he had never spent a day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s furlough at Plassans, his\nbrother having invented a thousand pretexts to keep him at a distance.\nHe was therefore completely ignorant of the adroit manner in which\nPierre had got possession of their mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortune. Adelaide, with her\nprofound indifference, did not even write to him three times to tell him\nhow she was going on. The silence which generally greeted his numerous\nrequests for money did not awaken the least suspicion in him; Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstinginess sufficed to explain the difficulty he experienced in securing\nfrom time to time a paltry twenty-franc piece. This, however, only\nincreased his animosity towards his brother, who left him to languish\nin military service in spite of his formal promise to purchase his\ndischarge. He vowed to himself that on his return home he would no\nlonger submit like a child, but would flatly demand his share of the\nfortune to enable him to live as he pleased. In the diligence which\nconveyed him home he dreamed of a delightful life of idleness. The\nshattering of his castles in the air was terrible. When he reached\nthe Faubourg, and could no longer even recognise the Fouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plot of\nground, he was stupefied. He was compelled to ask for his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new\naddress. There a terrible scene occurred. Adelaide calmly informed him\nof the sale of the property. He flew into a rage, and even raised his\nhand against her.\n\nThe poor woman kept repeating: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour brother has taken everything; it is\nunderstood that he will take care of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt last he left her and ran off to see Pierre, whom he had previously\ninformed of his return, and who was prepared to receive him in such a\nway as to put an end to the matter at the first word of abuse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the oil-dealer said to him, affecting distant coldness; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nrouse my anger, or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn you out. As a matter of fact, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\nyou. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bear the same name. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite misfortune enough for me\nthat my mother misconducted herself, without having her offspring coming\nhere and insulting me. I was well disposed towards you, but since you\nare insolent I shall do nothing for you, absolutely nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAntoine was almost choking with rage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what about my money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you give it up, you thief, or\nshall I have to drag you before the judges?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got no money of yours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, more calmly than ever. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\nmother disposed of her fortune as she thought proper. I am certainly not\ngoing to poke my nose into her business. I willingly renounced all hope\nof inheritance. I am quite safe from your foul accusations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as his brother, exasperated by this composure, and not knowing what\nto think, muttered something, Pierre thrust Adelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s receipt under his\nnose. The reading of this scrap of paper completed Antoine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dismay.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in a calmer voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know now what I have to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe truth was, however, he did not know what to do. His inability to hit\nupon any immediate expedient for obtaining his share of the money and\nsatisfying his desire of revenge increased his fury. He went back to\nhis mother and subjected her to a disgraceful cross-examination. The\nwretched woman could do nothing but again refer him to Pierre.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think you are going to make me run to and fro like a shuttle?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he cried, insolently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon find out which of you two has the\nhoard. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already squandered it, perhaps?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd making an allusion to her former misconduct he asked her if there\nwere still not some low fellow to whom she gave her last sous? He did\nnot even spare his father, that drunkard Macquart, as he called him,\nwho must have lived on her till the day of his death, and who left his\nchildren in poverty. The poor woman listened with a stupefied air; big\ntears rolled down her cheeks. She defended herself with the terror of\na child, replying to her son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questions as though he were a judge; she\nswore that she was living respectably, and reiterated with emphasis that\nshe had never had a sou of the money, that Pierre had taken everything.\nAntoine almost came to believe it at last.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! the scoundrel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t purchase my\ndischarge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had to sleep at his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, on a straw mattress flung in\na corner. He had returned with his pockets perfectly empty, and was\nexasperated at finding himself destitute of resources, abandoned like\na dog in the streets, without hearth or home, while his brother, as he\nthought, was in a good way of business, and living on the fat of\nthe land. As he had no money to buy clothes with, he went out on the\nfollowing day in his regimental cap and trousers. He had the good\nfortune to find, at the bottom of a cupboard, an old yellowish velveteen\njacket, threadbare and patched, which had belonged to Macquart. In this\nstrange attire he walked about the town, relating his story to everyone,\nand demanding justice.\n\nThe people whom he went to consult received him with a contempt which\nmade him shed tears of rage. Provincial folks are inexorable towards\nfallen families. In the general opinion it was only natural that the\nRougon-Macquarts should seek to devour each other; the spectators,\ninstead of separating them, were more inclined to urge them on. Pierre,\nhowever, was at that time already beginning to purify himself of his\nearly stains. People laughed at his roguery; some even went so far as to\nsay that he had done quite right, if he really had taken possession of\nthe money, and that it would be a good lesson to the dissolute folks of\nthe town.\n\nAntoine returned home discouraged. A lawyer had advised him, in a\nscornful manner, to wash his dirty linen at home, though not until he\nhad skilfully ascertained whether Antoine possessed the requisite\nmeans to carry on a lawsuit. According to this man, the case was very\ninvolved, the pleadings would be very lengthy, and success was doubtful.\nMoreover, it would require money, and plenty of it.\n\nAntoine treated his mother yet more harshly that evening. Not knowing\non whom else to wreak his vengeance, he repeated his accusation of the\nprevious day; he kept the wretched woman up till midnight, trembling\nwith shame and fright. Adelaide having informed him that Pierre made\nher an allowance, he now felt certain that his brother had pocketed\nthe fifty thousand francs. But, in his irritation, he still affected to\ndoubt it, and did not cease to question the poor woman, again and again\nreproaching her with misconduct.\n\nAntoine soon found out that, alone and without resources, he could not\nsuccessfully carry on a contest with his brother. He then endeavoured\nto gain Adelaide to his cause; an accusation lodged by her might have\nserious consequences. But, at Antoine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first suggestion of it, the\npoor, lazy, lethargic creature firmly refused to bring trouble on her\neldest son.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am an unhappy woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she stammered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is quite right of you to get\nangry. But I should feel too much remorse if I caused one of my sons to\nbe sent to prison. No; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather let you beat me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe saw that he would get nothing but tears out of her, and contented\nhimself with saying that she was justly punished, and that he had no\npity for her. In the evening, upset by the continual quarrels which her\nson had sought with her, Adelaide had one of those nervous attacks which\nkept her as rigid as if she had been dead. The young man threw her on\nher bed, and then began to rummage the house to see if the wretched\nwoman had any savings hidden away. He found about forty francs. He took\npossession of them, and, while his mother still lay there, rigid and\nscarce able to breathe, he quietly took the diligence to Marseilles.\n\nHe had just bethought himself that Mouret, the journeyman hatter who had\nmarried his sister Ursule, must be indignant at Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roguery, and\nwould no doubt be willing to defend his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests. But he did\nnot find in him the man he expected. Mouret plainly told him that he had\nbecome accustomed to look upon Ursule as an orphan, and would have no\ncontentions with her family at any price. Their affairs were prospering.\nAntoine was received so coldly that he hastened to take the diligence\nhome again. But, before leaving, he was anxious to revenge himself for\nthe secret contempt which he read in the workman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes; and, observing\nthat his sister appeared rather pale and dejected, he said to her\nhusband, in a slyly cruel way, as he took his departure: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave a care,\nmy sister was always sickly, and I find her much changed for the worse;\nyou may lose her altogether.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe tears which rushed to Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes convinced him that he had\ntouched a sore wound. But then those work-people made too great a\ndisplay of their happiness.\n\nWhen he was back again in Plassans, Antoine became the more menacing\nfrom the conviction that his hands were tied. During a whole month he\nwas seen all over the place. He paraded the streets, recounting his\nstory to all who would listen to him. Whenever he succeeded in extorting\na franc from his mother, he would drink it away at some tavern, where he\nwould revile his brother, declaring that the rascal should shortly hear\nfrom him. In places like these, the good-natured fraternity which reigns\namong drunkards procured him a sympathetic audience; all the scum of the\ntown espoused his cause, and poured forth bitter imprecations against\nthat rascal Rougon, who left a brave soldier to starve; the discussion\ngenerally terminating with an indiscriminate condemnation of the rich.\nAntoine, the better to revenge himself, continued to march about in his\nregimental cap and trousers and his old yellow velvet jacket, although\nhis mother had offered to purchase some more becoming clothes for him.\nBut no; he preferred to make a display of his rags, and paraded them on\nSundays in the most frequented parts of the Cours Sauvaire.\n\nOne of his most exquisite pleasures was to pass Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop ten\ntimes a day. He would enlarge the holes in his jacket with his fingers,\nslacken his step, and sometimes stand talking in front of the door, so\nas to remain longer in the street. On these occasions, too, he would\nbring one of his drunken friends and gossip to him; telling him about\nthe theft of the fifty thousand francs, accompanying his narrative\nwith loud insults and menaces, which could be heard by everyone in\nthe street, and taking particular care that his abuse should reach the\nfurthest end of the shop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll finish by coming to beg in front of our house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite used to\nsay in despair.\n\nThe vain little woman suffered terribly from this scandal. She even at\nthis time felt some regret at ever having married Rougon; his family\nconnections were so objectionable. She would have given all she had in\nthe world to prevent Antoine from parading his rags. But Pierre, who\nwas maddened by his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct, would not allow his name to be\nmentioned. When his wife tried to convince him that it would perhaps\nbe better to free himself from all annoyance by giving Antoine a little\nmoney: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, nothing; not a sou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried with rage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet him starve!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe confessed, however, at last that Antoine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demeanour was becoming\nintolerable. One day, Felicite, desiring to put an end to it, called to\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as she styled him with a disdainful curl on her lip. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\nman\u00e2\u0080\u009d was in the act of calling her a foul name in the middle of the\nstreet, where he stood with one of his friends, even more ragged than\nhimself. They were both drunk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, they want us in there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Antoine to his companion in a\njeering tone.\n\nBut Felicite drew back, muttering: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you alone we wish to speak to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young man replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a decent fellow. You needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nmind him hearing. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be my witness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe witness sank heavily on a chair. He did not take off his hat, but\nbegan to stare around him, with the maudlin, stupid grin of drunkards\nand coarse people who know that they are insolent. Felicite was so\nashamed that she stood in front of the shop door in order that\npeople outside might not see what strange company she was receiving.\nFortunately her husband came to the rescue. A violent quarrel ensued\nbetween him and his brother. The latter, after stammering insults,\nreiterated his old grievances twenty times over. At last he even began\nto cry, and his companion was near following his example. Pierre had\ndefended himself in a very dignified manner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re unfortunate, and I pity you.\nAlthough you have cruelly insulted me, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget that we are\nchildren of the same mother. If I give you anything, however, you must\nunderstand I give it you out of kindness, and not from fear. Would you\nlike a hundred francs to help you out of your difficulties?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis abrupt offer of a hundred francs dazzled Antoine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s companion. He\nlooked at the other with an air of delight, which clearly signified: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs\nthe gentleman offers a hundred francs, it is time to leave off\nabusing him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Antoine was determined to speculate on his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfavourable disposition. He asked him whether he took him for a fool; it\nwas his share, ten thousand francs, that he wanted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stuttered his friend.\n\nAt last, as Pierre, losing all patience, was threatening to turn\nthem both out, Antoine lowered his demands and contented himself with\nclaiming one thousand francs. They quarrelled for another quarter of\nan hour over this amount. Finally, Felicite interfered. A crowd was\ngathering round the shop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, excitedly; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy husband will give you two hundred\nfrancs. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll undertake to buy you a suit of clothes, and hire a room for\na year for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRougon got angry at this. But Antoine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comrade cried, with transports\nof delight: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s settled, then; my friend accepts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAntoine did, in fact, declare, in a surly way, that he would accept.\nHe felt he would not be able to get any more. It was arranged that the\nmoney and clothes should be sent to him on the following day, and that a\nfew days later, as soon as Felicite should have found a room for him, he\nwould take up his quarters there. As they were leaving, the young\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sottish companion became as respectful as he had previously been\ninsolent. He bowed to the company more than a dozen times, in an awkward\nand humble manner, muttering many indistinct thanks, as if the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ngifts had been intended for himself.\n\nA week later Antoine occupied a large room in the old quarter, in which\nFelicite, exceeding her promises, had placed a bed, a table, and some\nchairs, on the young man formally undertaking not to molest them in\nfuture. Adelaide felt no regret at her son leaving her; the short stay\nhe had made with her had condemned her to bread and water for more than\nthree months. However, Antoine had soon eaten and drunk the two hundred\nfrancs he received from Pierre. He never for a moment thought of\ninvesting them in some little business which would have helped him to\nlive. When he was again penniless, having no trade, and being, moreover,\nunwilling to work, he again sought to slip a hand into the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099\npurse. Circumstances were not the same as before, however, and he failed\nto intimidate them. Pierre even took advantage of this opportunity to\nturn him out, and forbade him ever to set foot in his house again.\nIt was of no avail for Antoine to repeat his former accusations. The\ntownspeople, who were acquainted with his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s munificence from\nthe publicity which Felicite had given to it, declared him to be in\nthe wrong, and called him a lazy, idle fellow. Meantime his hunger was\npressing. He threatened to turn smuggler like his father, and perpetrate\nsome crime which would dishonour his family. At this the Rougons\nshrugged their shoulders; they knew he was too much of a coward to risk\nhis neck. At last, blindly enraged against his relatives in particular\nand society in general, Antoine made up his mind to seek some work.\n\nIn a tavern of the Faubourg he made the acquaintance of a basket-maker\nwho worked at home. He offered to help him. In a short time he learnt to\nplait baskets and hampers--a coarse and poorly-paid kind of labour which\nfinds a ready market. He was very soon able to work on his own account.\nThis trade pleased him, as it was not over laborious. He could still\nindulge his idleness, and that was what he chiefly cared for. He would\nonly take to his work when he could no longer do otherwise; then he\nwould hurriedly plait a dozen baskets and go and sell them in the\nmarket. As long as the money lasted he lounged about, visiting all\nthe taverns and digesting his drink in the sunshine. Then, when he had\nfasted a whole day, he would once more take up his osier with a low\ngrowl and revile the wealthy who lived in idleness. The trade of a\nbasket-maker, when followed in such a manner, is a thankless one.\nAntoine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work would not have sufficed to pay for his drinking bouts\nif he had not contrived a means of procuring his osier at low cost. He\nnever bought any at Plassans, but used to say that he went each month to\npurchase a stock at a neighbouring town, where he pretended it was\nsold cheaper. The truth, however, was that he supplied himself from\nthe osier-grounds of the Viorne on dark nights. A rural policeman even\ncaught him once in the very act, and Antoine underwent a few days\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nimprisonment in consequence. It was from that time forward that he posed\nin the town as a fierce Republican. He declared that he had been quietly\nsmoking his pipe by the riverside when the rural policeman arrested him.\nAnd he added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey would like to get me out of the way because they\nknow what my opinions are. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not afraid of them, those rich\nscoundrels.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt last, at the end of ten years of idleness, Antoine considered that\nhe had been working too hard. His constant dream was to devise some\nexpedient by which he might live at his ease without having to do\nanything. His idleness would never have rested content with bread and\nwater; he was not like certain lazy persons who are willing to put up\nwith hunger provided they can keep their hands in their pockets. He\nliked good feeding and nothing to do. He talked at one time of taking a\nsituation as servant in some nobleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house in the Saint-Marc quarter.\nBut one of his friends, a groom, frightened him by describing the\nexacting ways of his masters. Finally Macquart, sick of his baskets,\nand seeing the time approach when he would be compelled to purchase\nthe requisite osier, was on the point of selling himself as an army\nsubstitute and resuming his military life, which he preferred a thousand\ntimes to that of an artisan, when he made the acquaintance of a woman,\nan acquaintance which modified his plans.\n\nJosephine Gavaudan, who was known throughout the town by the familiar\ndiminutive of Fine, was a tall, strapping wench of about thirty. With\na square face of masculine proportions, and a few terribly long hairs\nabout her chin and lips, she was cited as a doughty woman, one who could\nmake the weight of her fist felt. Her broad shoulders and huge arms\nconsequently inspired the town urchins with marvellous respect; and they\ndid not even dare to smile at her moustache. Notwithstanding all this,\nFine had a faint voice, weak and clear like that of a child. Those who\nwere acquainted with her asserted that she was as gentle as a lamb, in\nspite of her formidable appearance. As she was very hard-working, she\nmight have put some money aside if she had not had a partiality for\nliqueurs. She adored aniseed, and very often had to be carried home on\nSunday evenings.\n\nOn week days she would toil with the stubbornness of an animal. She had\nthree or four different occupations; she sold fruit or boiled chestnuts\nin the market, according to the season; went out charring for a few\nwell-to-do people; washed up plates and dishes at houses when parties\nwere given, and employed her spare time in mending old chairs. She was\nmore particularly known in the town as a chair-mender. In the South\nlarge numbers of straw-bottomed chairs are used.\n\nAntoine Macquart formed an acquaintance with Fine at the market. When he\nwent to sell his baskets in the winter he would stand beside the stove\non which she cooled her chestnuts and warm himself. He was astonished\nat her courage, he who was frightened of the least work. By degrees he\ndiscerned, beneath the apparent roughness of this strapping creature,\nsigns of timidity and kindliness. He frequently saw her give handfuls of\nchestnuts to the ragged urchins who stood in ecstasy round her smoking\npot. At other times, when the market inspector hustled her, she very\nnearly began to cry, apparently forgetting all about her heavy fists.\nAntoine at last decided that she was exactly the woman he wanted. She\nwould work for both and he would lay down the law at home. She would\nbe his beast of burden, an obedient, indefatigable animal. As for her\npartiality for liqueurs, he regarded this as quite natural. After well\nweighing the advantages of such an union, he declared himself to Fine,\nwho was delighted with his proposal. No man had ever yet ventured to\npropose to her. Though she was told that Antoine was the most worthless\nof vagabonds, she lacked the courage to refuse matrimony. The very\nevening of the nuptials the young man took up his abode in his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlodgings in the Rue Civadiere, near the market. These lodgings,\nconsisting of three rooms, were much more comfortably furnished than his\nown, and he gave a sigh of satisfaction as he stretched himself out on\nthe two excellent mattresses which covered the bedstead.\n\nEverything went on very well for the first few days. Fine attended to\nher various occupations as in the past; Antoine, seized with a sort of\nmarital self-pride which astonished even himself, plaited in one week\nmore baskets than he had ever before done in a month. On the first\nSunday, however, war broke out. The couple had a goodly sum of money in\nthe house, and they spent it freely. During the night, when they were\nboth drunk, they beat each other outrageously, without being able to\nremember on the morrow how it was that the quarrel had commenced. They\nhad remained on most affectionate terms until about ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, when\nAntoine had begun to beat Fine brutally, whereupon the latter, growing\nexasperated and forgetting her meekness, had given him back as much as\nshe received. She went to work again bravely on the following day, as\nthough nothing had happened. But her husband, with sullen rancour,\nrose late and passed the remainder of the day smoking his pipe in the\nsunshine.\n\nFrom that time forward the Macquarts adopted the kind of life which\nthey were destined to lead in the future. It became, as it were, tacitly\nunderstood between them that the wife should toil and moil to keep her\nhusband. Fine, who had an instinctive liking for work, did not object\nto this. She was as patient as a saint, provided she had had no drink,\nthought it quite natural that her husband should remain idle, and even\nstrove to spare him the most trifling labour. Her little weakness,\naniseed, did not make her vicious, but just. On the evenings when\nshe had forgotten herself in the company of a bottle of her favourite\nliqueur, if Antoine tried to pick a quarrel with her, she would set\nupon him with might and main, reproaching him with his idleness and\ningratitude. The neighbours grew accustomed to the disturbances which\nperiodically broke out in the couple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room. The two battered each other\nconscientiously; the wife slapped like a mother chastising a naughty\nchild; but the husband, treacherous and spiteful as he was, measured his\nblows, and, on several occasions, very nearly crippled the unfortunate\nwoman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be in a fine plight when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve broken one of my arms or legs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she would say to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep you then, you lazy fellow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nExcepting for these turbulent scenes, Antoine began to find his new mode\nof existence quite endurable. He was well clothed, and ate and drank his\nfill. He had laid aside the basket work altogether; sometimes, when he\nwas feeling over-bored, he would resolve to plait a dozen baskets for\nthe next market day; but very often he did not even finish the first\none. He kept, under a couch, a bundle of osier which he did not use up\nin twenty years.\n\nThe Macquarts had three children, two girls and a boy. Lisa,[*] born\nthe first, in 1827, one year after the marriage, remained but little\nat home. She was a fine, big, healthy, full-blooded child, greatly\nresembling her mother. She did not, however, inherit the latter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s animal\ndevotion and endurance. Macquart had implanted in her a most decided\nlonging for ease and comfort. While she was a child she would consent to\nwork for a whole day in return for a cake. When she was scarcely seven\nyears old, the wife of the postmaster, who was a neighbour of the\nMacquarts, took a liking to her. She made a little maid of her. And when\nshe lost her husband in 1839, and went to live in Paris, she took Lisa\nwith her. The parents had almost given her their daughter.\n\n     [*] The pork-butcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife in _Le Ventre de Paris_ (_The\n     Fat and the Thin_).\n\nThe second girl, Gervaise,[*] born the following year, was a cripple\nfrom birth. Her right thigh was smaller than the left and showed signs\nof curvature, a curious hereditary result of the brutality which her\nmother had to endure during her fierce drunken brawls with Macquart.\nGervaise remained puny, and Fine, observing her pallor and weakness,\nput her on a course of aniseed, under the pretext that she required\nsomething to strengthen her. But the poor child became still more\nemaciated. She was a tall, lank girl, whose frocks, invariably too\nlarge, hung round her as if they had nothing under them. Above a\ndeformed and puny body she had a sweet little doll-like head, a tiny\nround face, pale and exquisitely delicate. Her infirmity almost became\ngraceful. Her body swayed gently at every step with a sort of rhythmical\nswing.\n\n     [*] The chief female character in _L\u00e2\u0080\u0099Assommoir_ (_The Dramshop_).\n\nThe Macquarts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 son, Jean,[*] was born three years later. He was a robust\nchild, in no respect recalling Gervaise. Like the eldest girl, he took\nafter his mother, without having any physical resemblance to her. He\nwas the first to import into the Rougon-Macquart stock a fat face with\nregular features, which showed all the coldness of a grave yet not\nover-intelligent nature. This boy grew up with the determination of\nsome day making an independent position for himself. He attended school\ndiligently, and tortured his dull brain to force a little arithmetic and\nspelling into it. After that he became an apprentice, repeating much\nthe same efforts with a perseverance that was the more meritorious as it\ntook him a whole day to learn what others acquired in an hour.\n\n     [*] Figures prominently in _La Terre_ (_The Earth_) and _La\n     Debacle_ (_The Downfall_).\n\nAs long as these poor little things remained a burden to the house,\nAntoine grumbled. They were useless mouths that lessened his own share.\nHe vowed, like his brother, that he would have no more children, those\ngreedy creatures who bring their parents to penury. It was something to\nhear him bemoan his lot when they sat five at table, and the mother gave\nthe best morsels to Jean, Lisa, and Gervaise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would growl; \u00e2\u0080\u009cstuff them, make them burst!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhenever Fine bought a garment or a pair of boots for them, he would\nsulk for days together. Ah! if he had only known, he would never had had\nthat pack of brats, who compelled him to limit his smoking to four sous\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nworth of tobacco a day, and too frequently obliged him to eat stewed\npotatoes for dinner, a dish which he heartily detested.\n\nLater on, however, as soon as Jean and Gervaise earned their first\nfrancs, he found some good in children after all. Lisa was no longer\nthere. He lived upon the earnings of the two others without compunction,\nas he had already lived upon their mother. It was a well-planned\nspeculation on his part. As soon as little Gervaise was eight years old,\nshe went to a neighbouring dealer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to crack almonds; she there earned\nten sous a day, which her father pocketed right royally, without even\na question from Fine as to what became of the money. The young girl was\nnext apprenticed to a laundress, and as soon as she received two francs\na day for her work, the two francs strayed in a similar manner into\nMacquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands. Jean, who had learnt the trade of a carpenter, was\nlikewise despoiled on pay-days, whenever Macquart succeeded in catching\nhim before he had handed the money to his mother. If the money escaped\nMacquart, which sometimes happened, he became frightfully surly. He\nwould glare at his wife and children for a whole week, picking a quarrel\nfor nothing, although he was, as yet, ashamed to confess the real cause\nof his irritations. On the next pay-day, however, he would station\nhimself on the watch, and as soon as he had succeeded in pilfering the\nyoungster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings, he disappeared for days together.\n\nGervaise, beaten and brought up in the streets among all the lads of the\nneighbourhood, became a mother when she was fourteen years of age. The\nfather of her child was not eighteen years old. He was a journeyman\ntanner named Lantier. At first Macquart was furious, but he calmed\ndown somewhat when he learnt that Lantier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother, a worthy woman, was\nwilling to take charge of the child. He kept Gervaise, however; she was\nthen already earning twenty-five sous a day, and he therefore avoided\nall question of marriage. Four years later she had a second child, which\nwas likewise taken in by Lantier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother. This time Macquart shut his\neyes altogether. And when Fine timidly suggested that it was time to\ncome to some understanding with the tanner, in order to end a state of\nthings which made people chatter, he flatly declared that his daughter\nshould not leave him, and that he would give her to her lover later on,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen he was worthy of her, and had enough money to furnish a home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was a fine time for Antoine Macquart. He dressed like a gentleman,\nin frock-coats and trousers of the finest cloth. Cleanly shaved, and\nalmost fat, he was no longer the emaciated ragged vagabond who had been\nwont to frequent the taverns. He dropped into cafes, read the papers,\nand strolled on the Cours Sauvaire. He played the gentleman as long as\nhe had any money in his pocket. At times of impecuniosity he remained at\nhome, exasperated at being kept in his hovel and prevented from taking\nhis customary cup of coffee. On such occasions he would reproach the\nwhole human race with his poverty, making himself ill with rage and\nenvy, until Fine, out of pity, would often give him the last silver coin\nin the house so that he might spend his evening at the cafe. This dear\nfellow was fiercely selfish. Gervaise, who brought home as much as sixty\nfrancs a month, wore only thin cotton frocks, while he had black satin\nwaistcoats made for him by one of the best tailors in Plassans.\n\nJean, the big lad who earned three or four francs a day, was perhaps\nrobbed even more impudently. The cafe where his father passed entire\ndays was just opposite his master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workshop, and while he had plane or\nsaw in hand he could see \u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur\u00e2\u0080\u009d Macquart on the other side of the\nway, sweetening his coffee or playing piquet with some petty annuitant.\nIt was his money that the lazy old fellow was gambling away. He, Jean,\nnever stepped inside a cafe, he never had so much as five sous to pay\nfor a drink. Antoine treated him like a little girl, never leaving him a\ncentime, and always demanding an exact account of the manner in which he\nhad employed his time. If the unfortunate lad, led away by some of\nhis mates, wasted a day somewhere in the country, on the banks of the\nViorne, or on the slopes of Garrigues, his father would storm and raise\nhis hand, and long bear him a grudge on account of the four francs less\nthat he received at the end of the fortnight. He thus held his son in\na state of dependence, sometimes even looking upon the sweethearts whom\nthe young carpenter courted as his own. Several of Gervaise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends\nused to come to the Macquarts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house, work-girls from sixteen to\neighteen years of age, bold and boisterous girls who, on certain\nevenings, filled the room with youth and gaiety. Poor Jean, deprived of\nall pleasure, ever kept at home by the lack of money, looked at these\ngirls with longing eyes; but the childish life which he was compelled\nto lead had implanted invincible shyness in him; in playing with his\nsister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends, he was hardly bold enough to touch them with the tips\nof his fingers. Macquart used to shrug his shoulders with pity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a simpleton!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would mutter, with an air of ironical\nsuperiority.\n\nAnd it was he who would kiss the girls, when his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back was turned.\nHe carried his attentions even further with a little laundress whom Jean\npursued rather more earnestly than the others. One fine evening he stole\nher almost from his arms. The old rogue prided himself on his gallantry.\n\nThere are some men who live upon their mistresses. Antoine Macquart\nlived on his wife and children with as much shamelessness and impudence.\nHe did not feel the least compunction in pillaging the home and going\nout to enjoy himself when the house was bare. He still assumed a\nsupercilious air, returning from the cafe only to rail against the\npoverty and wretchedness that awaited him at home. He found the dinner\ndetestable, he called Gervaise a blockhead, and declared that Jean would\nnever be a man. Immersed in his own selfish indulgence, he rubbed his\nhands whenever he had eaten the best piece in the dish; and then he\nsmoked his pipe, puffing slowly, while the two poor children, overcome\nwith fatigue, went to sleep with their heads resting on the table.\nThus Macquart passed his days in lazy enjoyment. It seemed to him quite\nnatural that he should be kept in idleness like a girl, to sprawl about\non the benches of some tavern, or stroll in the cool of the day along\nthe Cours or the Mail. At last he went so far as to relate his amorous\nescapades in the presence of his son, who listened with glistening\neyes. The children never protested, accustomed as they were to see their\nmother humble herself before her husband.\n\nFine, that strapping woman who drubbed him soundly when they were both\nintoxicated, always trembled before him when she was sober, and allowed\nhim to rule despotically at home. He robbed her in the night of the\ncoppers which she had earned during the day at the market, but she\nnever dared to protest, except by veiled rebukes. Sometimes, when he had\nsquandered the week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s money in advance, he accused her, poor thing, who\nworked herself to death, of being stupid and not knowing how to manage.\nFine, as gentle as a lamb, replied, in her soft, clear voice, which\ncontrasted so strangely with her big figure, that she was no longer\ntwenty years old, and that money was becoming hard to earn. In order\nto console herself, she would buy a pint of aniseed, and drink little\nglassfuls of it with her daughter of an evening, after Antoine had gone\nback to the cafe. That was their dissipation. Jean went to bed, while\nthe two women remained at the table, listening attentively in order to\nremove the bottle and glasses at the first sound.\n\nWhen Macquart was late, they often became intoxicated by the many \u00e2\u0080\u009cnips\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n they thus thoughtlessly imbibed. Stupefied and gazing at each other\nwith vague smiles, this mother and daughter would end by stuttering.\nRed patches appeared on Gervaise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeks; her delicate doll-like face\nassumed a look of maudlin beatitude. Nothing could be more heart-rending\nthan to see this wretched, pale child, aglow with drink and wearing the\nidiotic smile of a confirmed sot about her moist lips. Fine, huddled\nup on her chair, became heavy and drowsy. They sometimes forgot to keep\nwatch, or even lacked the strength to remove the bottle and glasses when\nAntoine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s footsteps were heard on the stairs. On these occasions\nblows were freely exchanged among the Macquarts. Jean had to get up\nto separate his father and mother and make his sister go to bed, as\notherwise she would have slept on the floor.\n\nEvery political party numbers its grotesques and its villains. Antoine\nMacquart, devoured by envy and hatred, and meditating revenge against\nsociety in general, welcomed the Republic as a happy era when he would\nbe allowed to fill his pockets from his neighbour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cash-box, and even\nstrangle the neighbour if the latter manifested any displeasure.\nHis cafe life and all the newspaper articles he had read without\nunderstanding them had made him a terrible ranter who enunciated the\nstrangest of political theories. It is necessary to have heard one of\nthose malcontents who ill digest what they read, haranguing the company\nin some provincial taproom, in order to conceive the degree of hateful\nfolly at which Macquart had arrived. As he talked a good deal, had\nseen active service, and was naturally regarded as a man of energy and\nspirit, he was much sought after and listened to by simpletons. Although\nhe was not the chief of any party, he had succeeded in collecting\nround him a small group of working-men who took his jealous ravings for\nexpressions of honest and conscientious indignation.\n\nDirectly after the Revolution of February \u00e2\u0080\u009848, he persuaded himself that\nPlassans was his own, and, as he strolled along the streets, the\njeering manner in which he regarded the little retail traders who stood\nterrified at their shop doors clearly signified: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur day has come,\nmy little lambs; we are going to lead you a fine dance!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He had grown\ninsolent beyond belief; he acted the part of a victorious despot to\nsuch a degree that he ceased to pay for his drinks at the cafe, and the\nlandlord, a simpleton who trembled whenever Antoine rolled his eyes,\ndared not present his bill. The number of cups of coffee he consumed\nduring this period was incalculable; sometimes he invited his friends,\nand shouted for hours together that the people were dying of hunger, and\nthat the rich ought to share their wealth with them. He himself would\nnever have given a sou to a beggar.\n\nThat which chiefly converted him into a fierce Republican was the hope\nof at last being able to revenge himself on the Rougons, who had openly\nranged themselves on the side of the reactionary party. Ah, what a\ntriumph if he could only hold Pierre and Felicite at his mercy! Although\nthe latter had not succeeded over well in business, they had at\nlast become gentlefolks, while he, Macquart, had still remained a\nworking-man. That exasperated him. Perhaps he was still more mortified\nbecause one of their sons was a barrister, another a doctor, and the\nthird a clerk, while his son Jean merely worked at a carpenter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop,\nand his daughter Gervaise at a washerwoman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. When he compared the\nMacquarts with the Rougons, he was still more ashamed to see his wife\nselling chestnuts in the market, and mending the greasy old straw-seated\nchairs of the neighbourhood in the evening. Pierre, after all, was but\nhis brother, and had no more right than himself to live fatly on his\nincome. Moreover, this brother was actually playing the gentleman with\nmoney stolen from him. Whenever Macquart touched upon this subject, he\nbecame fiercely enraged; he clamoured for hours together, incessantly\nrepeating his old accusations, and never wearying of exclaiming: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf\nmy brother was where he ought to be, I should be the moneyed man at the\npresent time!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd when anyone asked him where his brother ought to be, he would reply,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the galleys!\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a formidable voice.\n\nHis hatred further increased when the Rougons had gathered the\nConservatives round them, and thus acquired a certain influence in\nPlassans. The famous yellow drawing-room became, in his hare-brained\nchatter at the cafe, a cave of bandits, an assembly of villains who\nevery evening swore on their daggers that they would murder the people.\nIn order to incite the starvelings against Pierre, Macquart went so far\nas to circulate a report that the retired oil-dealer was not so poor as\nhe pretended, but that he concealed his treasures through avarice and\nfear of robbery. His tactics thus tended to rouse the poor people by a\nrepetition of absurdly ridiculous tales, which he often came to believe\nin himself. His personal animosity and his desire for revenge were ill\nconcealed beneath his professions of patriotism; but he was heard so\nfrequently, and he had such a loud voice, that no one would have dared\nto doubt the genuineness of his convictions.\n\nAt bottom, all the members of this family had the same brutish passions.\nFelicite, who clearly understood that Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wild theories were\nsimply the fruit of restrained rage and embittered envy, would much have\nliked to purchase his silence. Unfortunately, she was short of money,\nand did not dare to interest him in the dangerous game which her husband\nwas playing. Antoine now injured them very much among the well-to-do\npeople of the new town. It sufficed that he was a relation of theirs.\nGranoux and Roudier often scornfully reproached them for having such a\nman in their family. Felicite consequently asked herself with anguish\nhow they could manage to cleanse themselves of such a stain.\n\nIt seemed to her monstrous and indecent that Monsieur Rougon should have\na brother whose wife sold chestnuts, and who himself lived in crapulous\nidleness. She at last even trembled for the success of their secret\nintrigues, so long as Antoine seemingly took pleasure in compromising\nthem. When the diatribes which he levelled at the yellow drawing-room\nwere reported to her, she shuddered at the thought that he was capable\nof becoming desperate and ruining all their hopes by force of scandal.\n\nAntoine knew what consternation his demeanour must cause the Rougons,\nand it was solely for the purpose of exhausting their patience that he\nfrom day to day affected fiercer opinions. At the cafe he frequented\nhe used to speak of \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy brother Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a voice which made everybody\nturn round; and if he happened to meet some reactionary from the yellow\ndrawing-room in the street, he would mutter some low abuse which the\nworthy citizen, amazed at such audacity, would repeat to the Rougons\nin the evening, as though to make them responsible for his disagreeable\nencounter.\n\nOne day Granoux arrived in a state of fury.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, when scarcely across the threshold, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nintolerable; one can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move a step without being insulted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then,\naddressing Pierre, he added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen one has a brother like yours, sir,\none should rid society of him. I was just quietly walking past the\nSub-Prefecture, when that rascal passed me muttering something in which\nI could clearly distinguish the words \u00e2\u0080\u0098old rogue.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite turned pale, and felt it necessary to apologise to Granoux, but\nhe refused to accept any excuses, and threatened to leave altogether.\nThe marquis, however, exerted himself to arrange matters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is very strange,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the wretched fellow should have\ncalled you an old rogue. Are you sure that he intended the insult for\nyou?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGranoux was perplexed; he admitted at last, however, that Antoine might\nhave muttered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you are again going to that old rogue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this Monsieur de Carnavant stroked his chin to conceal the smile\nwhich rose to his lips in spite of himself.\n\nThen Rougon, with superb composure, replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought as much; the\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098old rogue\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was no doubt intended for me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve very glad that this\nmisunderstanding is now cleared up. Gentlemen, pray avoid the man in\nquestion, whom I formally repudiate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite, however, did not take matters so coolly; every fresh scandal\ncaused by Macquart made her more and more uneasy; she would sometimes\npass the whole night wondering what those gentlemen must think of the\nmatter.\n\nA few months before the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat, the Rougons received an anonymous\nletter, three pages of foul insults, in which they were warned that\nif their party should ever triumph, the scandalous story of Adelaide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\namours would be published in some newspaper, together with an account\nof the robbery perpetrated by Pierre, when he had compelled his mother,\ndriven out of her senses by debauchery, to sign a receipt for fifty\nthousand francs. This letter was a heavy blow for Rougon himself.\nFelicite could not refrain from reproaching her husband with his\ndisreputable family; for the husband and wife never for a moment doubted\nthat this letter was Antoine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall have to get rid of the blackguard at any price,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pierre\nin a gloomy tone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s becoming too troublesome by far.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the meantime, Macquart, resorting to his former tactics, looked round\namong his own relatives for accomplices who would join him against the\nRougons. He had counted upon Aristide at first, on reading his terrible\narticles in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the young man, in spite of all his\njealous rage, was not so foolish as to make common cause with such\na fellow as his uncle. He never even minced matters with him, but\ninvariably kept him at a distance, a circumstance which induced Antoine\nto regard him suspiciously. In the taverns, where Macquart reigned\nsupreme, people went so far as to say the journalist was paid to provoke\ndisturbances.\n\nBaffled on this side, Macquart had no alternative but to sound his\nsister Ursule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children. Ursule had died in 1839, thus fulfilling her\nbrother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s evil prophecy. The nervous affection which she had inherited\nfrom her mother had turned into slow consumption, which gradually killed\nher. She left three children; a daughter, eighteen years of age, named\nHelene, who married a clerk, and two boys, the elder, Francois, a young\nman of twenty-three, and the younger, a sickly little fellow scarcely\nsix years old, named Silvere. The death of his wife, whom he adored,\nproved a thunderbolt to Mouret. He dragged on his existence for another\nyear, neglecting his business and losing all the money he had saved.\nThen, one morning, he was found hanging in a cupboard where Ursule\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndresses were still suspended. His elder son, who had received a good\ncommercial training, took a situation in the house of his uncle Rougon,\nwhere he replaced Aristide, who had just left.\n\nRougon, in spite of his profound hatred for the Macquarts, gladly\nwelcomed this nephew, whom he knew to be industrious and sober. He\nwas in want of a youth whom he could trust, and who would help him to\nretrieve his affairs. Moreover, during the time of Mouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prosperity,\nhe had learnt to esteem the young couple, who knew how to make money,\nand thus he had soon become reconciled with his sister. Perhaps he\nthought he was making Francois some compensation by taking him into his\nbusiness; having robbed the mother, he would shield himself from remorse\nby giving employment to the son; even rogues make honest calculations\nsometimes. It was, however, a good thing for him. If the house of Rougon\ndid not make a fortune at this time, it was certainly through no fault\nof that quiet, punctilious youth, Francois, who seemed born to pass his\nlife behind a grocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counter, between a jar of oil and a bundle\nof dried cod-fish. Although he physically resembled his mother, he\ninherited from his father a just if narrow mind, with an instinctive\nliking for a methodical life and the safe speculations of a small\nbusiness.\n\nThree months after his arrival, Pierre, pursuing his system of\ncompensation, married him to his young daughter Marthe,[*] whom he did\nnot know how to dispose of. The two young people fell in love with\neach other quite suddenly, in a few days. A peculiar circumstance had\ndoubtless determined and enhanced their mutual affection. There was a\nremarkably close resemblance between them, suggesting that of brother\nand sister. Francois inherited, through Ursule, the face of his\ngrandmother Adelaide. Marthe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case was still more curious; she was an\nequally exact portrait of Adelaide, although Pierre Rougon had none of\nhis mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s features distinctly marked; the physical resemblance\nhad, as it were, passed over Pierre, to reappear in his daughter. The\nsimilarity between husband and wife went, however, no further than\ntheir faces; if the worthy son of a steady matter-of-fact hatter was\ndistinguishable in Francois, Marthe showed the nervousness and mental\nweakness of her grandmother. Perhaps it was this combination of physical\nresemblance and moral dissimilarity which threw the young people into\neach other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms. From 1840 to 1844 they had three children. Francois\nremained in his uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s employ until the latter retired. Pierre had\ndesired to sell him the business, but the young man knew what small\nchance there was of making a fortune in trade at Plassans; so he\ndeclined the offer and repaired to Marseilles, where he established\nhimself with his little savings.\n\n     [*] Both Francois and Marthe figure largely in _The Conquest\n     of Plassans_.\n\nMacquart soon had to abandon all hope of dragging this big industrious\nfellow into his campaign against the Rougons; whereupon, with all the\nspite of a lazybones, he regarded him as a cunning miser. He fancied,\nhowever, that he had discovered the accomplice he was seeking in\nMouret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second son, a lad of fifteen years of age. Young Silvere had\nnever even been to school at the time when Mouret was found hanging\namong his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skirts. His elder brother, not knowing what to do\nwith him, took him also to his uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. The latter made a wry face on\nbeholding the child; he had no intention of carrying his compensation so\nfar as to feed a useless mouth. Thus Silvere, to whom Felicite also took\na dislike, was growing up in tears, like an unfortunate little outcast,\nwhen his grandmother Adelaide, during one of the rare visits she paid\nthe Rougons, took pity on him, and expressed a wish to have him with\nher. Pierre was delighted; he let the child go, without even suggesting\nan increase of the paltry allowance that he made Adelaide, and which\nhenceforward would have to suffice for two.\n\nAdelaide was then nearly seventy-five years of age. Grown old while\nleading a cloistered existence, she was no longer the lanky ardent girl\nwho formerly ran to embrace the smuggler Macquart. She had stiffened and\nhardened in her hovel in the Impasse Saint-Mittre, that dismal silent\nhole where she lived entirely alone on potatoes and dry vegetables, and\nwhich she did not leave once in the course of a month. On seeing her\npass, you might have thought her to be one of those delicately white old\nnuns with automatic gait, whom the cloister has kept apart from all the\nconcerns of this world. Her pale face, always scrupulously girt with a\nwhite cap, looked like that of a dying woman; a vague, calm countenance\nit was, wearing an air of supreme indifference. Prolonged taciturnity\nhad made her dumb; the darkness of her dwelling and the continual\nsight of the same objects had dulled her glance and given her eyes the\nlimpidity of spring water. Absolute renunciation, slow physical and\nmoral death, had little by little converted this crazy _amorosa_ into a\ngrave matron. When, as often happened, a blank stare came into her\neyes, and she gazed before her without seeing anything, one could detect\nutter, internal void through those deep bright cavities.\n\nNothing now remained of her former voluptuous ardour but weariness of\nthe flesh and a senile tremor of the hands. She had once loved like\na she-wolf, but was now wasted, already sufficiently worn out for the\ngrave. There had been strange workings of her nerves during her long\nyears of chastity. A dissolute life would perhaps have wrecked her less\nthan the slow hidden ravages of unsatisfied fever which had modified her\norganism.\n\nSometimes, even now, this moribund, pale old woman, who seemed to have\nno blood left in her, was seized with nervous fits like electric shocks,\nwhich galvanised her, and for an hour brought her atrocious intensity of\nlife. She would lie on her bed rigid, with her eyes open; then hiccoughs\nwould come upon her and she would writhe and struggle, acquiring the\nfrightful strength of those hysterical madwomen whom one has to tie down\nin order to prevent them from breaking their heads against a wall.\nThis return to former vigour, these sudden attacks, gave her a terrible\nshock. When she came to again, she would stagger about with such a\nscared, stupefied look, that the gossips of the Faubourg used to say:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been drinking, the crazy old thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLittle Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childish smile was for her the last pale ray which\nbrought some warmth to her frozen limbs. Weary of solitude, and\nfrightened at the thought of dying alone in one of her fits, she had\nasked to have the child. With the little fellow running about near\nher, she felt secure against death. Without relinquishing her habits of\ntaciturnity, or seeking to render her automatic movements more supple,\nshe conceived inexpressible affection for him. Stiff and speechless, she\nwould watch him playing for hours together, listening with delight to\nthe intolerable noise with which he filled the old hovel. That tomb\nhad resounded with uproar ever since Silvere had been running about it,\nbestriding broomsticks, knocking up against the doors, and shouting and\ncrying. He brought Adelaide back to the world, as it were; she looked\nafter him with the most adorable awkwardness; she who, in her youth,\nhad neglected the duties of a mother, now felt the divine pleasures\nof maternity in washing his face, dressing him, and watching over his\nsickly life. It was a reawakening of love, a last soothing passion which\nheaven had granted to this woman who had been so ravaged by the want of\nsome one to love; the touching agony of a heart that had lived amidst\nthe most acute desires, and which was now dying full of love for a\nchild.\n\nShe was already too far gone to pour forth the babble of good plump\ngrandmothers; she adored the child in secret with the bashfulness of a\nyoung girl, without knowing how to fondle him. Sometimes she took him on\nher knees, and gazed at him for a long time with her pale eyes. When\nthe little one, frightened by her mute white visage, began to cry, she\nseemed perplexed by what she had done, and quickly put him down upon the\nfloor without even kissing him. Perhaps she recognised in him a faint\nresemblance to Macquart the poacher.\n\nSilvere grew up, ever tete-a-tete with Adelaide. With childish cajolery\nhe used to call her aunt Dide, a name which ultimately clung to the\nold woman; the word \u00e2\u0080\u009caunt\u00e2\u0080\u009d employed in this way is simply a term of\nendearment in Provence. The child entertained singular affection, not\nunmixed with respectful terror, for his grandmother. During her nervous\nfits, when he was quite a little boy, he ran away from her, crying,\nterrified by her disfigured countenance; and he came back very timidly\nafter the attack, ready to run away again, as though the old woman were\ndisposed to beat him. Later on, however, when he was twelve years old,\nhe would stop there bravely and watch in order that she might not hurt\nherself by falling off the bed. He stood for hours holding her tightly\nin his arms to subdue the rude shocks which distorted her. During\nintervals of calmness he would gaze with pity on her convulsed features\nand withered frame, over which her skirts lay like a shroud. These\nhidden dramas, which recurred every month, this old woman as rigid as\na corpse, this child bent over her, silently watching for the return\nof consciousness, made up amidst the darkness of the hovel a strange\npicture of mournful horror and broken-hearted tenderness.\n\nWhen aunt Dide came round, she would get up with difficulty, and set\nabout her work in the hovel without even questioning Silvere. She\nremembered nothing, and the child, from a sort of instinctive prudence,\navoided the least allusion to what had taken place. These recurring\nfits, more than anything else, strengthened Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deep attachment\nfor his grandmother. In the same manner as she adored him without any\ngarrulous effusiveness, he felt a secret, almost bashful, affection for\nher. While he was really very grateful to her for having taken him in\nand brought him up, he could not help regarding her as an extraordinary\ncreature, a prey to some strange malady, whom he ought to pity and\nrespect. No doubt there was not sufficient life left in Adelaide; she\nwas too white and too stiff for Silvere to throw himself on her neck.\nThus they lived together amidst melancholy silence, in the depths of\nwhich they felt the tremor of boundless love.\n\nThe sad, solemn atmosphere, which he had breathed from childhood, gave\nSilvere a strong heart, in which gathered every form of enthusiasm. He\nearly became a serious, thoughtful little man, seeking instruction with\na kind of stubbornness. He only learnt a little spelling and arithmetic\nat the school of the Christian Brothers, which he was compelled to leave\nwhen he was but twelve years old, on account of his apprenticeship. He\nnever acquired the first rudiments of knowledge. However, he read all\nthe odd volumes which fell into his hands, and thus provided himself\nwith strange equipment; he had some notions of a multitude of subjects,\nill-digested notions, which he could never classify distinctly in his\nhead. When he was quite young, he had been in the habit of playing in\nthe workshop of a master wheelwright, a worthy man named Vian, who lived\nat the entrance of the blind-alley in front of the Aire Saint-Mittre\nwhere he stored his timber. Silvere used to jump up on the wheels of the\ntilted carts undergoing repair, and amuse himself by dragging about\nthe heavy tools which his tiny hands could scarcely lift. One of his\ngreatest pleasures, too, was to assist the workmen by holding some piece\nof wood for them, or bringing them the iron-work which they required.\nWhen he had grown older he naturally became apprenticed to Vian. The\nlatter had taken a liking to the little fellow who was always kicking\nabout his heels, and asked Adelaide to let him come, refusing to take\nanything for his board and lodging. Silvere eagerly accepted, already\nforeseeing the time when he would be able to make his poor aunt Dide\nsome return for all she had spent upon him.\n\nIn a short time he became an excellent workman. He cherished, however,\nmuch higher ambitions. Having once seen, at a coachbuilder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at\nPlassans, a fine new carriage, shining with varnish, he vowed that he\nwould one day build carriages himself. He remembered this carriage as\na rare and unique work of art, an ideal towards which his aspirations\nshould tend. The tilted carts at which he worked in Vian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop, those\ncarts which he had lovingly cherished, now seemed unworthy of his\naffections. He began to attend the local drawing-school, where he formed\na connection with a youngster who had left college, and who lent him an\nold treatise on geometry. He plunged into this study without a guide,\nracking his brains for weeks together in order to grasp the simplest\nproblem in the world. In this matter he gradually became one of those\nlearned workmen who can hardly sign their name and yet talk about\nalgebra as though it were an intimate friend.\n\nNothing unsettles the mind so much as this desultory kind of education,\nwhich reposes on no firm basis. Most frequently such scraps of knowledge\nconvey an absolutely false idea of the highest truths, and render\npersons of limited intellect insufferably stupid. In Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case,\nhowever, his scraps of stolen knowledge only augmented his liberal\naspirations. He was conscious of horizons which at present remained\nclosed to him. He formed for himself divine conceptions of things beyond\nhis reach, and lived on, regarding in a deep, innocent, religious way\nthe noble thoughts and grand conceptions towards which he was raising\nhimself, but which he could not as yet comprehend. He was one of the\nsimple-minded, one whose simplicity was divine, and who had remained\non the threshold of the temple, kneeling before the tapers which from a\ndistance he took for stars.\n\nThe hovel in the Impasse Saint-Mittre consisted, in the first place,\nof a large room into which the street door opened. The only pieces of\nfurniture in this room, which had a stone floor, and served both as a\nkitchen and a dining-room, were some straw-seated chairs, a table on\ntrestles, and an old coffer which Adelaide had converted into a sofa, by\nspreading a piece of woollen stuff over the lid. In the left hand\ncorner of the large fireplace stood a plaster image of the Holy Virgin,\nsurrounded by artificial flowers; she is the traditional good mother of\nall old Provencal women, however irreligious they may be. A passage led\nfrom the room into a yard situated at the rear of the house; in this\nyard there was a well. Aunt Dide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bedroom was on the left side of the\npassage; it was a little apartment containing an iron bedstead and one\nchair; Silvere slept in a still smaller room on the right hand side,\njust large enough for a trestle bedstead; and he had been obliged to\nplan a set of shelves, reaching up to the ceiling, to keep by him\nall those dear odd volumes which he saved his sous to purchase from a\nneighbouring general dealer. When he read at night-time, he would hang\nhis lamp on a nail at the head of the bed. If his grandmother had an\nattack, he merely had to leap out at the first gasp to be at her side in\na moment.\n\nThe young man led the life of a child. He passed his existence in this\nlonely spot. Like his father, he felt a dislike for taverns and Sunday\nstrolling. His mates wounded his delicate susceptibilities by their\ncoarse jokes. He preferred to read, to rack his rain over some simple\ngeometrical problem. Since aunt Dide had entrusted him with the\nlittle household commissions she did not go out at all, but ceased all\nintercourse even with her family. The young man sometimes thought of her\nforlornness; he reflected that the poor old woman lived but a few steps\nfrom the children who strove to forget her, as though she were dead;\nand this made him love her all the more, for himself and for the others.\nWhen he at times entertained a vague idea that aunt Dide might be\nexpiating some former transgressions, he would say to himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was\nborn to pardon her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA nature such as Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, ardent yet self-restrained, naturally\ncherished the most exalted republican ideas. At night, in his little\nhovel, Silvere would again and again read a work of Rousseau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s which he\nhad picked up at the neighbouring dealer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s among a number of old locks.\nThe reading of this book kept him awake till daylight. Amidst his dream\nof universal happiness so dear to the poor, the words liberty, equality,\nfraternity, rang in his ears like those sonorous sacred calls of the\nbells, at the sound of which the faithful fall upon their knees. When,\ntherefore, he learnt that the Republic had just been proclaimed in\nFrance he fancied that the whole world would enjoy a life of celestial\nbeatitude. His knowledge, though imperfect, made him see farther than\nother workmen; his aspirations did not stop at daily bread; but his\nextreme ingenuousness, his complete ignorance of mankind, kept him\nin the dreamland of theory, a Garden of Eden where universal justice\nreigned. His paradise was for a long time a delightful spot in which he\nforgot himself.\n\nWhen he came to perceive that things did not go on quite satisfactorily\nin the best of republics he was sorely grieved, and indulged in another\ndream, that of compelling men to be happy even by force. Every act which\nseemed to him prejudicial to the interest of the people roused him to\nrevengeful indignation. Though he was as gentle as a child, he cherished\nthe fiercest political animosity. He would not have killed a fly, and\nyet he was for ever talking of a call to arms. Liberty was his passion,\nan unreasoning, absolute passion, to which he gave all the feverish\nardour of his blood. Blinded by enthusiasm, he was both too ignorant and\ntoo learned to be tolerant, and would not allow for men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weaknesses; he\nrequired an ideal government of perfect justice and perfect liberty. It\nwas at this period that Antoine Macquart thought of setting him against\nthe Rougons. He fancied that this young enthusiast would work terrible\nhavoc if he were only exasperated to the proper pitch. This calculation\nwas not altogether devoid of shrewdness.\n\nSuch being Antoine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scheme, he tried to induce Silvere to visit him, by\nprofessing inordinate admiration for the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideas. But he\nvery nearly compromised the whole matter at the outset. He had a way\nof regarding the triumph of the Republic as a question of personal\ninterest, as an era of happy idleness and endless junketing, which\nchilled his nephew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purely moral aspirations. However, he perceived\nthat he was on the wrong track, and plunged into strange bathos, a\nstring of empty but high-sounding words, which Silvere accepted as a\nsatisfactory proof of his civism. Before long the uncle and the nephew\nsaw each other two or three times a week. During their long discussions,\nin which the fate of the country was flatly settled, Antoine endeavoured\nto persuade the young man that the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 drawing-room was the chief\nobstacle to the welfare of France. But he again made a false move by\ncalling his mother \u00e2\u0080\u009cold jade\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence. He even repeated to\nhim the early scandals about the poor woman. The young man blushed for\nshame, but listened without interruption. He had not asked his uncle\nfor this information; he felt heart-broken by such confidences, which\nwounded his feeling of respectful affection for aunt Dide. From that\ntime forward he lavished yet more attention upon his grandmother,\ngreeting her always with pleasant smiles and looks of forgiveness.\nHowever, Macquart felt that he had acted foolishly, and strove to take\nadvantage of Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s affection for Adelaide by charging the Rougons\nwith her forlornness and poverty. According to him, he had always been\nthe best of sons, whereas his brother had behaved disgracefully; Pierre\nhad robbed his mother, and now, when she was penniless, he was ashamed\nof her. He never ceased descanting on this subject. Silvere thereupon\nbecame indignant with his uncle Pierre, much to the satisfaction of his\nuncle Antoine.\n\nThe scene was much the same every time the young man called. He used\nto come in the evening, while the Macquarts were at dinner. The father\nwould be swallowing some potato stew with a growl, picking out the\npieces of bacon, and watching the dish when it passed into the hands of\nJean and Gervaise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, Silvere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say with a sullen rage which was\nill-concealed beneath his air of cynical indifference, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmore potatoes,\nalways potatoes! We never eat anything else now. Meat is only for\nrich people. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting quite impossible to make both ends meet with\nchildren who have the devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appetite and their own too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGervaise and Jean bent over their plates, no longer even daring to cut\nsome bread. Silvere, who in his dream lived in heaven, did not grasp the\nsituation. In a calm voice he pronounced these storm-laden words:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you should work, uncle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sneered Macquart, stung to the quick. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want me to work,\neh! To let those beggars, the rich folk, continue to prey upon me. I\nshould earn probably twenty sous a day, and ruin my constitution. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nworth while, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone earns what he can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young man replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwenty sous are\ntwenty sous; and it all helps in a home. Besides, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an old soldier,\nwhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you seek some employment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFine would then interpose, with a thoughtlessness of which she soon\nrepented.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m always telling him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe market inspector\nwants an assistant; I mentioned my husband to him, and he seems well\ndisposed towards us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Macquart interrupted her with a fulminating glance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEh! hold\nyour tongue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he growled with suppressed anger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen never know\nwhat they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about! Nobody would have me; my opinions are too\nwell-known.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEvery time he was offered employment he displayed similar irritation. He\ndid not cease, however, to ask for situations, though he always refused\nsuch as were found for him, assigning the most extraordinary reasons.\nWhen pressed upon the point he became terrible.\n\nIf Jean were to take up a newspaper after dinner he would at once\nexclaim: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better go to bed. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be getting up late to-morrow,\nand that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be another day lost. To think of that young rascal coming\nhome with eight francs short last week! However, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve requested his\nmaster not give him his money in future; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call for it myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJean would go to bed to avoid his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recriminations. He had but\nlittle sympathy with Silvere; politics bored him, and he thought his\ncousin \u00e2\u0080\u009ccracked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When only the women remained, if they unfortunately\nstarted some whispered converse after clearing the table, Macquart would\ncry: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, you idlers! Is there nothing that requires mending? we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nall in rags. Look here, Gervaise, I was at your mistress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to-day, and I\nlearnt some fine things. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a good-for-nothing, a gad-about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGervaise, now a grown girl of more than twenty, coloured up at\nthus being scolded in the presence of Silvere, who himself felt\nuncomfortable. One evening, having come rather late, when his uncle was\nnot at home, he had found the mother and daughter intoxicated before\nan empty bottle. From that time he could never see his cousin without\nrecalling the disgraceful spectacle she had presented, with the maudlin\ngrin and large red patches on her poor, pale, puny face. He was not\nless shocked by the nasty stories that circulated with regard to her.\nHe sometimes looked at her stealthily, with the timid surprise of a\nschoolboy in the presence of a disreputable character.\n\nWhen the two women had taken up their needles, and were ruining their\neyesight in order to mend his old shirts, Macquart, taking the best\nseat, would throw himself back with an air of delicious comfort, and sip\nand smoke like a man who relishes his laziness. This was the time when\nthe old rogue generally railed against the wealthy for living on\nthe sweat of the poor man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brow. He was superbly indignant with the\ngentlemen of the new town, who lived so idly, and compelled the poor\nto keep them in luxury. The fragments of communistic notions which he\nculled from the newspapers in the morning became grotesque and monstrous\non falling from his lips. He would talk of a time near at hand when\nno one would be obliged to work. He always, however, kept his fiercest\nanimosity for the Rougons. He never could digest the potatoes he had\neaten.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw that vile creature Felicite buying a chicken in the market this\nmorning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose robbers of inheritances must eat chicken,\nforsooth!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAunt Dide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interposed Silvere, \u00e2\u0080\u009csays that uncle Pierre was very kind\nto you when you left the army. Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he spend a large sum of money in\nlodging and clothing you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA large sum of money!\u00e2\u0080\u009d roared Macquart in exasperation; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour\ngrandmother is mad. It was those thieves who spread those reports\nthemselves, so as to close my mouth. I never had anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFine again foolishly interfered, reminding him that he had received two\nhundred francs, besides a suit of clothes and a year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rent. Antoine\nthereupon shouted to her to hold her tongue, and continued, with\nincreasing fury: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo hundred francs! A fine thing! I want my due, ten\nthousand francs. Ah! yes, talk of the hole they shoved me into like a\ndog, and the old frock-coat which Pierre gave me because he was ashamed\nto wear it any longer himself, it was so dirty and ragged!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was not speaking the truth; but, seeing the rage that he was in,\nnobody ventured to protest any further. Then, turning towards Silvere:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very stupid of you to defend them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey robbed your\nmother, who, good woman, would be alive now if she had had the means of\ntaking care of herself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just, uncle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young man said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy mother did not\ndie for want of attention, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m certain my father would never have\naccepted a sou from his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPooh! don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk to me! your father would have taken the money just\nlike anybody else. We were disgracefully plundered, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s high time\nwe had our rights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Macquart, for the hundredth time, began to recount the story of\nthe fifty thousand francs. His nephew, who knew it by heart, and all\nthe variations with which he embellished it, listened to him rather\nimpatiently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you were a man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Antoine would say in conclusion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou would come\nsome day with me, and we would kick up a nice row at the Rougons. We\nwould not leave without having some money given us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere, however, grew serious, and frankly replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf those wretches\nrobbed us, so much the worse for them. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want their money. You\nsee, uncle, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not for us to fall on our relatives. If they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done\nwrong, well, one of these days they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be severely punished for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! what a big simpleton you are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the uncle cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we have the\nupper hand, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see whether I sha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t settle my own little affairs\nmyself. God cares a lot about us indeed! What a foul family ours is!\nEven if I were starving to death, not one of those scoundrels would\nthrow me a dry crust.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhenever Macquart touched upon this subject, he proved inexhaustible. He\nbared all his bleeding wounds of envy and covetousness. He grew mad\nwith rage when he came to think that he was the only unlucky one in the\nfamily, and was forced to eat potatoes, while the others had meat to\ntheir heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content. He would pass all his relations in review, even\nhis grand-nephews, and find some grievance and reason for threatening\nevery one of them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated bitterly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099d leave me to die like a dog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGervaise, without raising her head or ceasing to ply her needle, would\nsometimes say timidly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cStill, father, cousin Pascal was very kind to\nus, last year, when you were ill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe attended you without charging a sou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Fine, coming to her\ndaughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand he often slipped a five-franc piece into my hand to\nmake you some broth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe! he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have killed me if I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had a strong constitution!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Macquart retorted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHold your tongues, you fools! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d let yourselves\nbe twisted about like children. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d all like to see me dead. When I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nill again, I beg you not to go and fetch my nephew, for I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel at\nall comfortable in his hands. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a twopenny-halfpenny doctor, and\nhasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got a decent patient in all his practice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen once Macquart was fully launched, he could not stop. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like\nthat little viper, Aristide,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca false brother, a traitor.\nAre you taken in by his articles in the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Independant,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Silvere? You\nwould be a fine fool if you were. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not even written in good\nFrench; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always maintained that this contraband Republican is in\nleague with his worthy father to humbug us. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see how he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn\nhis coat. And his brother, the illustrious Eugene, that big blockhead\nof whom the Rougons make such a fuss! Why, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the impudence to\nassert that he occupies a good position in Paris! I know something about\nhis position; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s employed at the Rue de Jerusalem; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a police spy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho told you so? You know nothing about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted Silvere, whose\nupright spirit at last felt hurt by his uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lying accusations.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! I know nothing about it? Do you think so? I tell you he is a\npolice spy. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be shorn like a lamb one of these days, with your\nbenevolence. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not manly enough. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to say anything\nagainst your brother Francois; but, if I were in your place, I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlike the scurvy manner in which he treats you. He earns a heap of money\nat Marseilles, and yet he never sends you a paltry twenty-franc pierce\nfor pocket money. If ever you become poor, I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t advise you to\nlook to him for anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve no need of anybody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young man replied in a proud and slightly\ninjured tone of voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy own work suffices for aunt Dide and myself.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cruel, uncle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI only say what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all. I should like to open your eyes.\nOur family is a disreputable lot; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sad but true. Even that little\nMaxime, Aristide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, that little nine-year-old brat, pokes his\ntongue out at me when me meets me. That child will some day beat his\nown mother, and a good job too! Say what you like, all those folks don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ndeserve their luck; but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always like this in families, the good ones\nsuffer while the bad ones make their fortunes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll this dirty linen, which Macquart washed with such complacency before\nhis nephew, profoundly disgusted the young man. He would have liked to\nsoar back into his dream. As soon as he began to show unmistakable signs\nof impatience, Antoine would employ strong expedients to exasperate him\nagainst their relatives.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDefend them! Defend them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say, appearing to calm down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI,\nfor my part, have arranged to have nothing more to do with them. I only\nmention the matter out of pity for my poor mother, whom all that gang\ntreat in a most revolting manner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are wretches!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere murmured.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand. These Rougons pour all sorts\nof insults and abuse on the good woman. Aristide has forbidden his son\neven to recognise her. Felicite talks of having her placed in a lunatic\nasylum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young man, as white as a sheet, abruptly interrupted his uncle:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEnough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to know any more about it. There will\nhave to be an end to all this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hold my tongue, since it annoys you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old rascal replied,\nfeigning a good-natured manner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStill, there are some things that\nyou ought not to be ignorant of, unless you want to play the part of a\nfool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart, while exerting himself to set Silvere against the Rougons,\nexperienced the keenest pleasure on drawing tears of anguish from the\nyoung man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes. He detested him, perhaps, more than he did the others,\nand this because he was an excellent workman and never drank. He brought\nall his instincts of refined cruelty into play, in order to invent\natrocious falsehoods which should sting the poor lad to the heart; then\nhe revelled in his pallor, his trembling hands and his heart-rending\nlooks, with the delight of some evil spirit who measures his stabs and\nfinds that he has struck his victim in the right place. When he thought\nthat he had wounded and exasperated Silvere sufficiently, he would at\nlast touch upon politics.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been assured,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would say, lowering his voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the Rougons\nare preparing some treachery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTreachery?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere asked, becoming attentive.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, one of these nights they are going to seize all the good citizens\nof the town and throw them into prison.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young man was at first disposed to doubt it, but his uncle gave\nprecise details; he spoke of lists that had been drawn up, he mentioned\nthe persons whose names were on these lists, he indicated in what\nmanner, at what hour, and under what circumstances the plot would be\ncarried into effect. Silvere gradually allowed himself to be taken in\nby this old woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tale, and was soon raving against the enemies of the\nRepublic.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s they that we shall have to reduce to impotence if they persist in\nbetraying the country!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what do they intend to do with\nthe citizens whom they arrest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do they intend to do with them? Why, they will shoot them in the\nlowest dungeons of the prison, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Macquart, with a\nhoarse laugh. And as the young man, stupefied with horror, looked at\nhim without knowing what to say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will not be the first lot to be\nassassinated there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need only go and prowl about the\nPalais de Justice of an evening to hear the shots and groans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, the wretches!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere murmured.\n\nThereupon uncle and nephew launched out into high politics. Fine and\nGervaise, on finding them hotly debating things, quietly went to bed\nwithout attracting their attention. Then the two men remained together\ntill midnight, commenting on the news from Paris and discussing the\napproaching and inevitable struggle. Macquart bitterly denounced the men\nof his own party, Silvere dreamed his dream of ideal liberty aloud, and\nfor himself only. Strange conversations these were, during which the\nuncle poured out many a little nip for himself, and from which the\nnephew emerged quite intoxicated with enthusiasm. Antoine, however,\nnever succeeded in obtaining from the young Republican any perfidious\nsuggestion or play of warfare against the Rougons. In vain he tried to\ngoad him on; he seldom heard him suggest aught but an appeal to eternal\njustice, which sooner or later would punish the evil-doers.\n\nThe ingenuous youth did indeed speak warmly of taking up arms and\nmassacring the enemies of the Republic; but, as soon as these enemies\nstrayed out of his dream or became personified in his uncle Pierre or\nany other person of his acquaintance, he relied upon heaven to spare\nhim the horror of shedding blood. It is very probable that he would have\nceased visiting Macquart, whose jealous fury made him so uncomfortable,\nif he had not tasted the pleasure of being able to speak freely of his\ndear Republic there. In the end, however, his uncle exercised decisive\ninfluence over his destiny; he irritated his nerves by his everlasting\ndiatribes, and succeeded in making him eager for an armed struggle, the\nconquest of universal happiness by violence.\n\nWhen Silvere reached his sixteenth year, Macquart had him admitted into\nthe secret society of the Montagnards, a powerful association whose\ninfluence extended throughout Southern France. From that moment the\nyoung Republican gazed with longing eyes at the smuggler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s carbine,\nwhich Adelaide had hung over her chimney-piece. Once night, while his\ngrandmother was asleep, he cleaned and put it in proper condition. Then\nhe replaced it on its nail and waited, indulging in brilliant reveries,\nfancying gigantic epics, Homeric struggles, and knightly tournaments,\nwhence the defenders of liberty would emerge victorious and acclaimed by\nthe whole world.\n\nMacquart meantime was not discouraged. He said to himself that he would\nbe able to strangle the Rougons alone if he could ever get them into a\ncorner. His envious rage and slothful greed were increased by certain\nsuccessive accidents which compelled him to resume work. In the early\npart of 1850 Fine died, almost suddenly, from inflammation of the lungs,\nwhich she had caught by going one evening to wash the family linen in\nthe Viorne, and carrying it home wet on her back. She returned soaked\nwith water and perspiration, bowed down by her load, which was terribly\nheavy, and she never recovered.\n\nHer death filled Macquart with consternation. His most reliable source\nof income was gone. When, a few days later, he sold the caldron in which\nhis wife had boiled her chestnuts, and the wooden horse which she used\nin reseating old chairs, he foully accused the Divinity of having robbed\nhim of that strong strapping woman of whom he had often felt ashamed,\nbut whose real worth he now appreciated. He now also fell upon the\nchildren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings with greater avidity than ever. But, a month later,\nGervaise, tired of his continual exactions, ran away with her two\nchildren and Lantier, whose mother was dead. The lovers took refuge in\nParis. Antoine, overwhelmed, vented his rage against his daughter by\nexpressing the hope that she might die in hospital like most of her\nkind. This abuse did not, however, improve the situation, which was\ndecidedly becoming bad. Jean soon followed his sister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s example. He\nwaited for pay-day to come round, and then contrived to receive the\nmoney himself. As he was leaving he told one of his friends, who\nrepeated it to Antoine, that he would no longer keep his lazy father,\nand that if the latter should take it into his head to have him brought\nback by the gendarmes he would touch neither saw nor plane.\n\nOn the morrow, when Antoine, having vainly sought him, found himself\nalone and penniless in the house where for twenty years he had been\ncomfortably kept, he flew into the most frantic rage, kicked the\nfurniture about, and yelled the vilest imprecations. Then he sank down\nexhausted, and began to drag himself about and moan like a convalescent.\nThe fear of having to earn his bread made him positively ill. When\nSilvere came to see him, he complained, with tears, of his children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ningratitude. Had he not always been a good father to them? Jean and\nGervaise were monsters, who had made him an evil return for all he had\ndone for them. Now they abandoned him because he was old, and they could\nnot get anything more out of him!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut uncle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Silvere, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are not yet too old to work!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart, coughing and stooping, shook his head mournfully, as if to say\nthat he could not bear the least fatigue for any length of time. Just\nas his nephew was about to withdraw, he borrowed ten francs of him. Then\nfor a month he lived by taking his children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old clothes, one by one,\nto a second-hand dealer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and in the same way, little by little, he\nsold all the small articles in the house. Soon nothing remained but\na table, a chair, his bed, and the clothes on his back. He ended by\nexchanging the walnut-wood bedstead for a plain strap one. When he had\nexhausted all his resources, he cried with rage; and, with the fierce\npallor of a man who is resigned to suicide, he went to look for the\nbundle of osier that he had forgotten in some corner for a quarter of\na century past. As he took it up he seemed to be lifting a mountain.\nHowever, he again began to plait baskets and hampers, while denouncing\nthe human race for their neglect.\n\nIt was particularly at this time that he talked of dividing and sharing\nthe riches of the wealthy. He showed himself terrible. His speeches\nkept up a constant conflagration in the tavern, where his furious looks\nsecured him unlimited credit. Moreover, he only worked when he had been\nunable to get a five-franc piece out of Silvere or a comrade. He was\nno longer \u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur\u00e2\u0080\u009d Macquart, the clean-shaven workman, who wore his\nSunday clothes every day and played the gentleman; he again became the\nbig slovenly devil who had once speculated on his rags. Felicite did not\ndare to go to market now that he was so often coming there to sell\nhis baskets. He once had a violent quarrel with her there. His hatred\nagainst the Rougons grew with his wretchedness. He swore, with horrible\nthreats, that he would wreak justice himself, since the rich were\nleagued together to compel him to toil.\n\nIn this state of mind, he welcomed the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat with the ardent,\nobstreperous delight of a hound scenting the quarry. As the few honest\nLiberals in the town had failed to arrive at an understanding amongst\nthemselves, and therefore kept apart, he became naturally one of\nthe most prominent agents of the insurrection. The working classes,\nnotwithstanding the unfavourable opinion which they at last entertained\nof this lazy fellow, would, when the time arrived, have to accept him\nas a rallying flag. On the first few days, however, the town remained\nquiet, and Macquart thought that his plans were frustrated. It was not\nuntil the news arrived of the rising of the rural districts that he\nrecovered hope. For his own part he would not have left Plassans for all\nthe world; accordingly he invented some pretext for not following those\nworkmen who, on the Sunday morning, set off to join the insurrectionary\nband of La Palud and Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx.\n\nOn the evening of the same day he was sitting in some disreputable\ntavern of the old quarter with a few friends, when a comrade came to\ninform him that the insurgents were only a few miles from Plassans. This\nnews had just been brought by an express, who had succeeded in making\nhis way into the town, and had been charged to get the gates opened\nfor the column. There was an outburst of triumph. Macquart, especially,\nappeared to be delirious with enthusiasm. The unforeseen arrival of the\ninsurgents seemed to him a delicate attention of Providence for his own\nparticular benefit. His hands trembled at the idea that he would soon\nhold the Rougons by the throat.\n\nHe hastily quitted the tavern with his friends. All the Republicans who\nhad not yet left the town were soon assembled on the Cours Sauvaire. It\nwas this band that Rougon had perceived as he was hastening to conceal\nhimself in his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. When the band had reached the top of\nthe Rue de la Banne, Macquart, who had stationed himself at the rear,\ndetained four of his companions, big fellows who were not over-burdened\nwith brains and whom he swayed by his tavern bluster. He easily\npersuaded them that the enemies of the Republic must be arrested\nimmediately if they wished to prevent the greatest calamities. The truth\nwas that he feared Pierre might escape him in the midst of the confusion\nwhich the entry of the insurgents would produce. However, the four big\nfellows followed him with exemplary docility, and knocked violently\nat the door of the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 abode. In this critical situation Felicite\ndisplayed admirable courage. She went down and opened the street door\nherself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want to go upstairs into your rooms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Macquart said to her brutally.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, gentlemen, walk up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied with ironical politeness,\npretending that she did not recognise her brother-in-law.\n\nOnce upstairs, Macquart ordered her to fetch her husband.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy husband is not here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said with perfect calmness; \u00e2\u0080\u009che is\ntravelling on business. He took the diligence for Marseilles at six\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock this evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAntoine at this declaration, which Felicite uttered in a clear voice,\nmade a gesture of rage. He rushed through the drawing-room, and then\ninto the bedroom, turned the bed up, looked behind the curtains and\nunder the furniture. The four big fellows assisted him. They searched\nthe place for a quarter of an hour. Felicite meantime quietly seated\nherself on the drawing-room sofa, and began to fasten the strings of her\npetticoats, like a person who has been surprised in her sleep and has\nnot had time to dress properly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true then, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s run away, the coward!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Macquart muttered on\nreturning to the drawing-room.\n\nNevertheless, he continued to look about him with a suspicious air. He\nfelt a presentiment that Pierre could not have given up the game at the\ndecisive moment. At last he approached Felicite, who was yawning: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShow\nus the place where your husband is hidden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I\npromise no harm shall be done to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have told you the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied impatiently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deliver\nmy husband to you, as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not here. You have searched everywhere,\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? Then leave me alone now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart, exasperated by her composure, was just going to strike her,\nwhen a rumbling noise arose from the street. It was the column of\ninsurgents entering the Rue de la Banne.\n\nHe then had to leave the yellow drawing-room, after shaking his fist\nat his sister-in-law, calling her an old jade, and threatening that he\nwould soon return. At the foot of the staircase, he took one of the men\nwho accompanied him, a navvy named Cassoute, the most wooden-headed of\nthe four, and ordered him to sit on the first step, and remain there.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must come and inform me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you see the scoundrel\nfrom upstairs return.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe man sat down heavily. When Macquart reached the pavement, he\nraised his eyes and observed Felicite leaning out of the window of the\nyellow-drawing room, watching the march past of the insurgents, as if\nit was nothing but a regiment passing through the town to the strains\nof its band. This last sign of perfect composure irritated him to such a\ndegree that he was almost tempted to go up again and throw the old woman\ninto the street. However, he followed the column, muttering in a hoarse\nvoice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, look at us passing. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see whether you will station\nyourself at your balcony to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was nearly eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock at night when the insurgents entered the\ntown by the Porte de Rome. The workmen remaining in Plassans had opened\nthe gate for them, in spite of the wailings of the keeper, from whom\nthey could only wrest the keys by force. This man, very jealous of his\noffice, stood dumbfoundered in the presence of the surging crowd. To\nthink of it! he, who never allowed more than one person to pass in at\na time, and then only after a prolonged examination of his face! And\nhe murmured that he was dishonoured. The men of Plassans were still\nmarching at the head of the column by way of guiding the others; Miette,\nwho was in the front rank, with Silvere on her left, held up her banner\nmore proudly than ever now that she could divine behind the closed\nblinds the scared looks of well-to-do bourgeois startled out of their\nsleep. The insurgents passed along the Rue de Rome and the Rue de la\nBanne slowly and warily; at every crossway, although they well knew the\nquiet disposition of the inhabitants, they feared they might be received\nwith bullets. The town seemed lifeless, however; there was scarcely\na stifled exclamation to be heard at the windows. Only five or six\nshutters opened. Some old householder then appeared in his night-shirt,\ncandle in hand, and leant out to obtain a better view; but as soon as he\ndistinguished the tall red girl who appeared to be drawing that crowd of\nblack demons behind her, he hastily closed his window again, terrified\nby such a diabolical apparition.\n\nThe silence of the slumbering town reassured the insurgents, who\nventured to make their way through the lanes of the old quarter, and\nthus reached the market-place and the Place de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Hotel-de-Ville, which\nwas connected by a short but broad street. These open spaces, planted\nwith slender trees, were brilliantly illumined by the moon. Against the\nclear sky the recently restored town-hall appeared like a large patch of\ncrude whiteness, the fine black lines of the wrought-iron arabesques of\nthe first-floor balcony showing in bold relief. Several persons could\nbe plainly distinguished standing on this balcony, the mayor, Commander\nSicardot, three or four municipal councillors, and other functionaries.\nThe doors below were closed. The three thousand Republicans, who covered\nboth open spaces, halted with upraised heads, ready to force the doors\nwith a single push.\n\nThe arrival of the insurrectionary column at such an hour took the\nauthorities by surprise. Before repairing to the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Commander\nSicardot had taken time to don his uniform. He then had to run and rouse\nthe mayor. When the keeper of the Porte de Rome, who had been left free\nby the insurgents, came to announce that the villains were already in\nthe town, the commander had so far only managed to assemble a score of\nthe national guards. The gendarmes, though their barracks were close by,\ncould not even be warned. It was necessary to shut the town-hall\ndoors in all haste, in order to deliberate. Five minutes later a low\ncontinuous rumbling announced the approach of the column.\n\nMonsieur Garconnet, out of hatred to the Republic, would have greatly\nliked to offer resistance. But he was of a prudent nature, and\ncomprehended the futility of a struggle on finding only a few pale men,\nwho were scarcely awake, around him. So the deliberations did not last\nlong. Sicardot alone was obstinate; he wanted to fight, asserting that\ntwenty men would suffice to bring these three thousand villains to\nreason. At this Monsieur Garconnet shrugged his shoulders, and declared\nthat the only step to take was to make an honourable capitulation. As\nthe uproar of the mob increased, he went out on the balcony, followed\nby all the persons present. Silence was gradually obtained. Below, among\nthe black, quivering mass of insurgents, the guns and scythes glittered\nin the moonlight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho are you, and what do you want?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the mayor in a loud voice.\n\nThereupon a man in a greatcoat, a landowner of La Palud, stepped\nforward.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOpen the doors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, without replying to Monsieur Garconnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nquestion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAvoid a fratricidal conflict.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI call upon you to withdraw,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the mayor continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI protest in the\nname of the law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese words provoked deafening shouts from the crowd. When the tumult\nhad somewhat abated, vehement calls ascended to the balcony. Voices\nshouted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is in the name of the law that we have come here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour duty as a functionary is to secure respect for the fundamental\nlaw of the land, the constitution, which has just been outrageously\nviolated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLong live the constitution! Long live the Republic!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen as Monsieur Garconnet endeavoured to make himself heard, and\ncontinued to invoke his official dignity, the land-owner of La\nPalud, who was standing under the balcony, interrupted him with\ngreat vehemence: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are now nothing but the functionary of a fallen\nfunctionary; we have come to dismiss you from your office.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHitherto, Commander Sicardot had been ragefully biting his moustache,\nand muttering insulting words. The sight of the cudgels and scythes\nexasperated him; and he made desperate efforts to restrain himself\nfrom treating these twopenny-halfpenny soldiers, who had not even a\ngun apiece, as they deserved. But when he heard a gentleman in a mere\ngreatcoat speak of deposing a mayor girded with his scarf, he could no\nlonger contain himself and shouted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou pack of rascals! If I only had\nfour men and a corporal, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come down and pull your ears for you, and\nmake you behave yourselves!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLess than this was needed to raise a serious disturbance. A long shout\nrose from the mob as it made a rush for the doors. Monsieur Garconnet,\nin consternation, hastily quitted the balcony, entreating Sicardot to be\nreasonable unless he wished to have them massacred. But in two minutes\nthe doors gave way, the people invaded the building and disarmed the\nnational guards. The mayor and the other functionaries present were\narrested. Sicardot, who declined to surrender his sword, had to\nbe protected from the fury of some insurgents by the chief of the\ncontingent from Les Tulettes, a man of great self-possession. When the\ntown-hall was in the hands of the Republicans, they led their prisoners\nto a small cafe in the market-place, and there kept them closely\nwatched.\n\nThe insurrectionary army would have avoided marching through Plassans\nif its leaders had not decided that a little food and a few hours\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rest\nwere absolutely necessary for the men. Instead of pushing forward\ndirect to the chief town of the department, the column, owing to the\ninexcusable weakness and the inexperience of the improvised general who\ncommanded it, was now diverging to the left, making a detour which was\ndestined, ultimately, to lead it to destruction. It was bound for the\nheights of Sainte-Roure, still about ten leagues distant, and it was\nin view of this long march that it had been decided to pass through\nPlassans, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour. It was now half-past\neleven.\n\nWhen Monsieur Garconnet learnt that the band was in quest of provisions,\nhe offered his services to procure them. This functionary formed, under\nvery difficult circumstances, a proper estimate of the situation. Those\nthree thousand starving men would have to be satisfied; it would never\ndo for Plassans, on waking up, to find them still squatting on the\npavements; if they withdrew before daybreak they would simply have\npassed through the slumbering town like an evil dream, like one of those\nnightmares which depart with the arrival of dawn. And so, although he\nremained a prisoner, Monsieur Garconnet, followed by two guards, went\nabout knocking at the bakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 doors, and had all the provisions that he\ncould find distributed among the insurgents.\n\nTowards one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock the three thousand men began to eat, squatting on\nthe ground, with their weapons between their legs. The market-place\nand the neighbourhood of the town-hall were turned into vast open-air\nrefectories. In spite of the bitter cold, humorous sallies were\nexchanged among the swarming multitude, the smallest groups of which\nshowed forth in the brilliant moonlight. The poor famished fellows\neagerly devoured their portions while breathing on their fingers to warm\nthem; and, from the depths of adjoining streets, where vague black forms\nsat on the white thresholds of the houses, there came sudden bursts\nof laughter. At the windows emboldened, inquisitive women, with silk\nhandkerchiefs tied round their heads, watched the repast of those\nterrible insurgents, those blood-suckers who went in turn to the market\npump to drink a little water in the hollows of their hands.\n\nWhile the town-hall was being invaded, the gendarmes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 barracks, situated\na few steps away, in the Rue Canquoin, which leads to the market, had\nalso fallen into the hands of the mob. The gendarmes were surprised in\ntheir beds and disarmed in a few minutes. The impetus of the crowd had\ncarried Miette and Silvere along in this direction. The girl, who still\nclasped her flagstaff to her breast, was pushed against the wall of\nthe barracks, while the young man, carried away by the human wave,\npenetrated into the interior, and helped his comrades to wrest from the\ngendarmes the carbines which they had hastily caught up. Silvere, waxing\nferocious, intoxicated by the onslaught, attacked a big devil of a\ngendarme named Rengade, with whom for a few moments he struggled. At\nlast, by a sudden jerk, he succeeded in wresting his carbine from him.\nBut the barrel struck Rengade a violent blow in the face, which put his\nright eye out. Blood flowed, and, some of it splashing Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands,\nquickly brought him to his senses. He looked at his hands, dropped the\ncarbine, and ran out, in a state of frenzy, shaking his fingers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are wounded!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Miette.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied in a stifled voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just killed a gendarme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs he really dead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Miette.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Silvere, \u00e2\u0080\u009chis face was all covered with blood.\nCome quickly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he hurried the girl away. On reaching the market, he made her sit\ndown on a stone bench, and told her to wait there for him. He was still\nlooking at his hands, muttering something at the same time. Miette at\nlast understood from his disquieted words that he wished to go and kiss\nhis grandmother before leaving.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trouble yourself about me. Wash your\nhands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he went quickly away, keeping his fingers apart, without thinking\nof washing them at the pump which he passed. Since he had felt Rengade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwarm blood on his skin, he had been possessed by one idea, that of\nrunning to Aunt Dide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and dipping his hands in the well-trough at the\nback of the little yard. There only, he thought, would he be able\nto wash off the stain of that blood. Moreover, all his calm, gentle\nchildhood seemed to return to him; he felt an irresistible longing\nto take refuge in his grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skirts, if only for a minute.\nHe arrived quite out of breath. Aunt Dide had not gone to bed, a\ncircumstance which at any other time would have greatly surprised\nSilvere. But on entering he did not even see his uncle Rougon, who was\nseated in a corner on the old chest. He did not wait for the poor old\nwoman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s questions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrandmother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said quickly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must forgive\nme; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to leave with the others. You see I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got blood on me. I\nbelieve I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve killed a gendarme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve killed a gendarme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Aunt Dide repeated in a strange voice.\n\nHer eyes gleamed brightly as she fixed them on the red stains. And\nsuddenly she turned towards the chimney-piece. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken the gun,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the gun?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere, who had left the weapon with Miette, swore to her that it was\nquite safe. And for the very first time, Adelaide made an allusion to\nthe smuggler Macquart in her grandson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bring the gun back? You promise me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said with singular\nenergy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I have left of him. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve killed a gendarme; ah, it\nwas the gendarmes who killed him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe continued gazing fixedly at Silvere with an air of cruel\nsatisfaction, and apparently without thought of detaining him. She never\nasked him for any explanation, nor wept like those good grandmothers who\nalways imagine, at sight of the least scratch, that their grandchildren\nare dying. All her nature was concentrated in one unique thought, to\nwhich she at last gave expression with ardent curiosity: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you kill\nthe gendarme with the gun?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEither Silvere did not quite catch what she said, or else he\nmisunderstood her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to wash my hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was only on returning from the well that he perceived his uncle.\nPierre had turned pale on hearing the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words. Felicite was\nindeed right; his family took a pleasure in compromising him. One of\nhis nephews had now killed a gendarme! He would never get the post\nof receiver of taxes, if he did not prevent this foolish madman from\nrejoining the insurgents. So he planted himself in front of the door,\ndetermined to prevent Silvere from going out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to the young fellow, who was greatly surprised to find\nhim there. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am the head of the family, and I forbid you to leave this\nhouse. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re risking both your honour and ours. To-morrow I will try to\nget you across the frontier.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Silvere shrugged his shoulders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me pass,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he calmly replied.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a police-spy; I shall not reveal your hiding-place, never\nfear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as Rougon continued to speak of the family dignity and the\nauthority with which his seniority invested him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo I belong to your\nfamily?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young man continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have always disowned me. To-day,\nfear has driven you here, because you feel that the day of judgment has\narrived. Come, make way! I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hide myself; I have a duty to perform.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRougon did not stir. But Aunt Dide, who had listened with a sort of\ndelight to Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vehement language, laid her withered hand on her\nson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet out of the way, Pierre,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe lad must go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young man gave his uncle a slight shove, and dashed outside. Then\nRougon, having carefully shut the door again, said to his mother in an\nangry, threatening tone: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf any mischief happens to him it will be your\nfault. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an old mad-woman; you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAdelaide, however, did not appear to hear him. She went and threw some\nvine-branches on the fire, which was going out, and murmured with a\nvague smile: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m used to it. He would remain away for months together,\nand then come back to me in much better health.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was no doubt speaking of Macquart.\n\nIn the meantime, Silvere hastily regained the market-place. As he\napproached the spot where he had left Miette, he heard a loud uproar of\nvoices and saw a crowd which made him quicken his steps. A cruel scene\nhad just occurred. Some inquisitive people were walking among the\ninsurgents, while the latter quietly partook of their meal. Amongst\nthese onlookers was Justin Rebufat, the son of the farmer of the\nJas-Meiffren, a youth of twenty years old, a sickly, squint-eyed\ncreature, who harboured implacable hatred against his cousin Miette.\nAt home he grudged her the bread she ate, and treated her like a beggar\npicked up from the gutter out of charity. It is probable that the young\ngirl had rejected his advances. Lank and pale, with ill-proportioned\nlimbs and face all awry, he revenged himself upon her for his own\nugliness, and the contempt which the handsome, vigorous girl must have\nevinced for him. He ardently longed to induce his father to send her\nabout her business; and for this reason he was always spying upon her.\nFor some time past, he had become aware of the meetings with Silvere,\nand had only awaited a decisive opportunity to reveal everything to his\nfather, Rebufat.\n\nOn the evening in question, having seen her leave home at about eight\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, Justin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hatred had overpowered him, and he had been unable\nto keep silent any longer. Rebufat, on hearing his story, fell into a\nterrible rage, and declared that he would kick the gadabout out of his\nhouse should she have the audacity to return. Justin then went to\nbed, relishing beforehand the fine scene which would take place on the\nmorrow. Then, however, a burning desire came upon him for some immediate\nforetaste of his revenge. So he dressed himself again and went out.\nPerhaps he might meet Miette. In that case he was resolved to treat\nher insolently. This is how he came to witness the arrival of the\ninsurgents, whom he followed to the town-hall with a vague presentiment\nthat he would find the lovers there. And, indeed, he at last caught\nsight of his cousin on the seat where she was waiting for Silvere.\nSeeing her wrapped in her long pelisse, with the red flag at her side,\nresting against a market pillar, he began to sneer and deride her in\nfoul language. The girl, thunderstruck at seeing him, was unable\nto speak. She wept beneath his abuse, and whist she was overcome by\nsobbing, bowing her head and hiding her face, Justin called her a\nconvict\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, and shouted that old Rebufat would give her a good\nthrashing should she ever dare to return to Jas-Meiffren.\n\nFor a quarter of an hour he thus kept her smarting and trembling. Some\npeople had gathered round, and grinned stupidly at the painful scene.\nAt last a few insurgents interfered, and threatened the young man with\nexemplary chastisement if he did not leave Miette alone. But Justin,\nalthough he retreated, declared that he was not afraid of them. It was\njust at this moment that Silvere came up. Young Rebufat, on catching\nsight of him, made a sudden bound, as if to take flight; for he was\nafraid of him, knowing that he was much stronger than himself. He could\nnot, however, resist the temptation to cast a parting insult on the girl\nin her lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! I knew very well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the wheelwright could not be\nfar off! You left us to run after that crack-brained fellow, eh? You\nwretched girl! When\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the baptism to be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he retreated a few steps further on seeing Silvere clench his\nfists.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, with a vile sneer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come to our house\nagain. My father will kick you out if you do! Do you hear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he ran away howling, with bruised visage. For Silvere had bounded\nupon him and dealt him a blow full in the face. The young man did\nnot pursue him. When he returned to Miette he found her standing up,\nfeverishly wiping her tears away with the palm of her hand. And as\nhe gazed at her tenderly, in order to console her, she made a sudden\nenergetic gesture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to cry any more,\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very glad of it. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel any regret now for having\nleft home. I am free.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took up the flag and led Silvere back into the midst of the\ninsurgents. It was now nearly two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the morning. The cold was\nbecoming so intense that the Republicans had risen to their feet and\nwere marching to and fro in order to warm themselves while they finished\ntheir bread. At last their leaders gave orders for departure. The column\nformed again. The prisoners were placed in the middle of it. Besides\nMonsieur Garconnet and Commander Sicardot, the insurgents had\narrested Monsieur Peirotte, the receiver of taxes, and several other\nfunctionaries, all of whom they led away.\n\nAt this moment Aristide was observed walking about among the groups.\nIn presence of this formidable rising, the dear fellow had thought it\nimprudent not to remain on friendly terms with the Republicans; but as,\non the other hand, he did not desire to compromise himself too much,\nhe had come to bid them farewell with his arm in a sling, complaining\nbitterly of the accursed injury which prevented him from carrying\na weapon. As he walked through the crowd he came across his brother\nPascal, provided with a case of surgical instruments and a little\nportable medicine chest. The doctor informed him, in his quiet, way,\nthat he intended to follow the insurgents. At this Aristide inwardly\npronounced him a great fool. At last he himself slunk away, fearing lest\nthe others should entrust the care of the town to him, a post which he\ndeemed exceptionally perilous.\n\nThe insurgents could not think of keeping Plassans in their power. The\ntown was animated by so reactionary a spirit that it seemed impossible\neven to establish a democratic municipal commission there, as had\nalready been done in other places. So they would simply have gone off\nwithout taking any further steps if Macquart, prompted and emboldened by\nhis own private animosities, had not offered to hold Plassans in awe, on\ncondition that they left him twenty determined men. These men were given\nhim, and at their head he marched off triumphantly to take possession\nof the town-hall. Meantime the column of insurgents was wending its\nway along the Cours Sauvaire, and making its exit by the Grand\u00e2\u0080\u0099-Porte,\nleaving the streets, which it had traversed like a tempest, silent\nand deserted in its rear. The high road, whitened by the moonshine,\nstretched far into the distance. Miette had refused the support of\nSilvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm; she marched on bravely, steady and upright, holding the\nred flag aloft with both hands, without complaining of the cold which\nwas turning her fingers blue.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe high roads stretched far way, white with moonlight.\n\nThe insurrectionary army was continuing its heroic march through the\ncold, clear country. It was like a mighty wave of enthusiasm. The thrill\nof patriotism, which transported Miette and Silvere, big children that\nthey were, eager for love and liberty, sped, with generous fervour,\nathwart the sordid intrigues of the Macquarts and the Rougons. At\nintervals the trumpet-voice of the people rose and drowned the prattle\nof the yellow drawing-room and the hateful discourses of uncle Antoine.\nAnd vulgar, ignoble farce was turned into a great historical drama.\n\nOn quitting Plassans, the insurgents had taken the road to Orcheres.\nThey expected to reach that town at about ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the morning.\nThe road skirts the course of the Viorne, following at some height the\nwindings of the hillocks, below which the torrent flows. On the left,\nthe plain spreads out like an immense green carpet, dotted here and\nthere with grey villages. On the right, the chain of the Garrigues rears\nits desolate peaks, its plateaux of stones, its huge rusty boulders\nthat look as though they had been reddened by the sun. The high road,\nembanked along the riverside, passes on amidst enormous rocks, between\nwhich glimpses of the valley are caught at every step. Nothing could be\nwilder or more strikingly grand than this road out of the hillside. At\nnight time, especially, it inspires one with a feeling of deep awe. The\ninsurgents advanced under the pale light, along what seemed the chief\nstreet of some ruined town, bordered on either side with fragments\nof temples. The moon turned each rock into a broken column, crumbling\ncapital, or stretch of wall pierced with mysterious arches. On high\nslumbered the mass of the Garrigues, suffused with a milky tinge, and\nresembling some immense Cyclopean city whose towers, obelisks, houses\nand high terraces hid one half of the heavens; and in the depths below,\non the side of the plain, was a spreading ocean of diffused light,\nvague and limitless, over which floated masses of luminous haze. The\ninsurrectionary force might well have thought they were following some\ngigantic causeway, making their rounds along some military road built on\nthe shore of a phosphorescent sea, and circling some unknown Babel.\n\nOn the night in question, the Viorne roared hoarsely at the foot of\nthe rocks bordering the route. Amidst the continuous rumbling of the\ntorrent, the insurgents could distinguish the sharp, wailing notes of\nthe tocsin. The villages scattered about the plain, on the other side of\nthe river, were rising, sounding alarm-bells, and lighting signal fires.\nTill daybreak the marching column, which the persistent tolling of\na mournful knell seemed to pursue in the darkness, thus beheld the\ninsurrection spreading along the valley, like a train of powder. The\nfires showed in the darkness like stains of blood; echoes of distant\nsongs were wafted to them; the whole vague distance, blurred by the\nwhitish vapours of the moon, stirred confusedly, and suddenly broke into\na spasm of anger. For leagues and leagues the scene remained the same.\n\nThese men, marching on under the blind impetus of the fever with which\nthe events in Paris had inspired Republican hearts, became elated at\nseeing that long stretch of country quivering with revolt. Intoxicated\nwith enthusiastic belief in the general insurrection of which they\ndreamed, they fancied that France was following them; on the other side\nof the Viorne, in that vast ocean of diffused light, they imagined there\nwere endless files of men rushing like themselves to the defence of the\nRepublic. All simplicity and delusion, as multitudes so often are, they\nimagined, in their uncultured minds, that victory was easy and certain.\nThey would have seized and shot as a traitor any one who had then\nasserted that they were the only ones who had the courage of their\nduty, and that the rest of the country, overwhelmed with fright, was\npusillanimously allowing itself to be garrotted.\n\nThey derived fresh courage, too, from the welcome accorded to them\nby the few localities that lay along their route on the slopes of the\nGarrigues. The inhabitants rose _en masse_ immediately the little army\ndrew near; women ran to meet them, wishing them a speedy victory, while\nmen, half clad, seized the first weapons they could find and rushed to\njoin their ranks. There was a fresh ovation at every village, shouts of\nwelcome and farewell many times reiterated.\n\nTowards daybreak the moon disappeared behind the Garrigues and the\ninsurgents continued their rapid march amidst the dense darkness of\na winter night. They were now unable to distinguish the valley or the\nhills; they heard only the hoarse plaints of the bells, sounding through\nthe deep obscurity like invisible drums, hidden they knew not where, but\never goading them on with despairing calls.\n\nMiette and Silvere went on, all eagerness like the others. Towards\ndaybreak, the girl suffered greatly from fatigue; she could only walk\nwith short hurried steps, and was unable to keep up with the long\nstrides of the men who surrounded her. Nevertheless she courageously\nstrove to suppress all complaints; it would have cost her too much\nto confess that she was not as strong as a boy. During the first few\nleagues of the march Silvere gave her his arm; then, seeing that the\nstandard was gradually slipping from her benumbed hands, he tried to\ntake it in order to relieve her; but she grew angry, and would only\nallow him to hold it with one hand while she continued to carry it on\nher shoulder. She thus maintained her heroic demeanour with childish\nstubbornness, smiling at the young man each time he gave her a glance of\nloving anxiety. At last, when the moon hid itself, she gave way in the\nsheltering darkness. Silvere felt her leaning more heavily on his arm.\nHe now had to carry the flag, and hold her round the waist to prevent\nher from stumbling. Nevertheless she still made no complaint.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you very tired, poor Miette?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere asked her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYea, a little tired,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied in a weary tone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you like to rest a bit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe made no reply; but he realised that she was staggering. He thereupon\nhanded the flag to one of the other insurgents and quitted the ranks,\nalmost carrying the girl in his arms. She struggled a little, she felt\nso distressed at appearing such a child. But he calmed her, telling her\nthat he knew of a cross-road which shortened the distance by one half.\nThey would be able to take a good hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rest and reach Orcheres at the\nsame time as the others.\n\nIt was then six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. There must have been a slight mist rising from\nthe Viorne, for the darkness seemed to be growing denser. The young\npeople groped their way along the slope of the Garrigues, till they came\nto a rock on which they sat down. Around them lay an abyss of darkness.\nThey were stranded, as it were, on some reef above a dense void. And\nathwart that void, when the dull tramp of the little army had died away,\nthey only heard two bells, the one clear toned and ringing doubtless at\ntheir feet, in some village across the road; and the other far-off and\nfaint, responding, as it were, with distant sobs to the feverish plaints\nof the first. One might have thought that these bells were recounting to\neach other, through the empty waste, the sinister story of a perishing\nworld.\n\nMiette and Silvere, warmed by their quick march, did not at first feel\nthe cold. They remained silent, listening in great dejection to the\nsounds of the tocsin, which made the darkness quiver. They could not\neven see one another. Miette felt frightened, and, seeking for Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhand, clasped it in her own. After the feverish enthusiasm which for\nseveral hours had carried them along with the others, this sudden halt\nand the solitude in which they found themselves side by side left them\nexhausted and bewildered as though they had suddenly awakened from a\nstrange dream. They felt as if a wave had cast them beside the highway,\nthen ebbed back and left them stranded. Irresistible reaction plunged\nthem into listless stupor; they forgot their enthusiasm; they thought no\nmore of the men whom they had to rejoin; they surrendered themselves to\nthe melancholy sweetness of finding themselves alone, hand in hand, in\nthe midst of the wild darkness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are not angry with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the girl at length inquired. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could\neasily walk the whole night with you; but they were running too quickly,\nI could hardly breathe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy should I be angry with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young man said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I was afraid you might not love me any longer. I wish I\ncould have taken long strides like you, and have walked along without\nstopping. You will think I am a child.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere smiled, and Miette, though the darkness prevented her from\nseeing him, guessed that he was doing so. Then she continued with\ndetermination: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must not always treat me like a sister. I want to be\nyour wife some day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nForthwith she clasped Silvere to her bosom, and, still with her arms\nabout him, murmured: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall grow so cold; come close to me that we\nmay be warm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen they lapsed into silence. Until that troublous hour, they had loved\none another with the affection of brother and sister. In their ignorance\nthey still mistook their feelings for tender friendship, although\nbeneath their guileless love their ardent blood surged more wildly\nday by day. Given age and experience, a violent passion of southern\nintensity would at last spring from this idyll. Every girl who hangs on\na youth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck is already a woman, a woman unconsciously, whom a caress\nmay awaken to conscious womanhood. When lovers kiss on the cheeks, it is\nbecause they are searching, feeling for one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips. Lovers are\nmade by a kiss. It was on that dark and cold December night, amid the\nbitter wailing of the tocsin, that Miette and Silvere exchanged one of\nthose kisses that bring all the heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood to the lips.\n\nThey remained silent, close to one another. A gentle glow soon\npenetrated them, languor overcame them, and steeped them in feverish\ndrowsiness. They were quite warm at last, and lights seemed to flit\nbefore their closed eyelids, while a buzzing mounted to their brains.\nThis state of painful ecstasy, which lasted some minutes, seemed\nendless to them. Then, in a kind of dream, their lips met. The kiss they\nexchanged was long and greedy. It seemed to them as if they had never\nkissed before. Yet their embrace was fraught with suffering and they\nreleased one another. And the chilliness of the night having cooled\ntheir fever, they remained in great confusion at some distance one from\nthe other.\n\nMeantime the bells were keeping up their sinister converse in the\ndark abyss which surrounded the young people. Miette, trembling and\nfrightened, did not dare to draw near to Silvere again. She did not even\nknow if he were still there, for she could no longer hear him move. The\nstinging sweetness of their kiss still clung to their lips, to which\npassionate phrases surged, and they longed to kiss once more. But shame\nrestrained them from the expression of any such desire. They felt that\nthey would rather never taste that bliss again than speak of it aloud.\nIf their blood had not been lashed by their rapid march, if the darkness\nhad not offered complicity, they would, for a long time yet, have\ncontinued kissing each other on the cheeks like old playfellows.\nFeelings of modesty were coming to Miette. She remembered Justin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncoarseness. A few hours previously she had listened, without a blush,\nto that fellow who called her a shameless girl. She had wept without\nunderstanding his meaning, she had wept simply because she guessed that\nwhat he spoke of must be base. Now that she was becoming a woman, she\nwondered in a last innocent transport whether that kiss, whose burning\nsmart she could still feel, would not perhaps suffice to cover her with\nthe shame to which her cousin had referred. Thereupon she was seized\nwith remorse, and burst into sobs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter; why are you crying?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Silvere in an anxious\nvoice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, leave me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she faltered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen in spite of herself, as it were, she continued amidst her tears:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! what an unfortunate creature I am! When I was ten years old\npeople used to throw stones at me. To-day I am treated as the vilest of\ncreatures. Justin did right to despise me before everybody. We have been\ndoing wrong, Silvere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young man, quite dismayed, clasped her in his arms again, trying\nto console her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am your brother. Why\nsay that we have been doing wrong? We kissed each other because we were\ncold. You know very well that we used to kiss each other every evening\nbefore separating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! not as we did just now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be wrong, for a\nstrange feeling came over me. The men will laugh at me now as I pass,\nand they will be right in doing so. I shall not be able to defend\nmyself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young fellow remained silent, unable to find a word to calm the\nagitation of this big child, trembling at her first kiss of love. He\nclasped her gently, imagining that he might calm her by his embrace.\nShe struggled, however, and continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you like, we will go away; we\nwill leave the province. I can never return to Plassans; my uncle would\nbeat me; all the townspeople would point their fingers at me--\u00e2\u0080\u009d And\nthen, as if seized with sudden irritation, she added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut no! I am\ncursed! I forbid you to leave aunt Dide to follow me. You must leave me\non the highway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiette, Miette!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere implored; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk like that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. I want to please you. Be reasonable. They have turned me out like\na vagabond. If I went back with you, you would always be fighting for my\nsake, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this the young man again pressed a kiss upon her lips, murmuring:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall be my wife, and nobody will then dare to hurt you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! please, I entreat you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with a stifled cry; \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kiss\nme so. You hurt me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, after a short silence: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know quite well that I cannot be your\nwife now. We are too young. You would have to wait for me, and meanwhile\nI should die of shame. You are wrong in protesting; you will be forced\nto leave me in some corner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this Silvere, his fortitude exhausted, began to cry. A man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sobs\nare fraught with distressing hoarseness. Miette, quite frightened as\nshe felt the poor fellow shaking in her arms, kissed him on the face,\nforgetting she was burning her lips. But it was all her fault. She was\na little simpleton to have let a kiss upset her so completely. She\nnow clasped her lover to her bosom as if to beg forgiveness for having\npained him. These weeping children, so anxiously clasping one another,\nmade the dark night yet more woeful than before. In the distance, the\nbells continued to complain unceasingly in panting accents.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is better to die,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Silvere, amidst his sobs; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is better\nto die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cry; forgive me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stammered Miette. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be brave; I will do\nall you wish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the young man had dried his tears: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\ncannot return to Plassans. But the time for cowardice has not yet come.\nIf we come out of the struggle triumphant, I will go for aunt Dide, and\nwe will take her ever so far away with us. If we are beaten----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stopped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we are beaten?\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Miette, softly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen be it as God wills!\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Silvere, in a softer voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI most\nlikely shall not be there. You will comfort the poor woman. That would\nbe better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! as you said just now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young girl murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit would be better\nto die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this longing for death they tightened their embrace. Miette relied\nupon dying with Silvere; he had only spoken of himself, but she felt\nthat he would gladly take her with him into the earth. They would there\nbe able to love each other more freely than under the sun. Aunt\nDide would die likewise and join them. It was, so to say, a rapid\npresentiment, a desire for some strange voluptuousness, to which\nHeaven, by the mournful accents of the tocsin, was promising early\ngratification. To die! To die! The bells repeated these words with\nincreasing passion, and the lovers yielded to the calls of the darkness;\nthey fancied they experienced a foretaste of the last sleep, in the\ndrowsiness into which they again sank, whilst their lips met once more.\n\nMiette no longer turned away. It was she, now, who pressed her lips to\nSilvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, who sought with mute ardour for the delight whose stinging\nsmart she had not at first been able to endure. The thought of\napproaching death had excited her; she no longer felt herself blushing,\nbut hung upon her love, while he in faltering voice repeated: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI love\nyou! I love you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut at this Miette shook her head, as if to say it was not true. With\nher free and ardent nature she had a secret instinct of the meaning and\npurposes of life, and though she was right willing to die she would fain\nhave known life first. At last, growing calmer, she gently rested her\nhead on the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder, without uttering a word. Silvere\nkissed her again. She tasted those kisses slowly, seeking their meaning,\ntheir hidden sweetness. As she felt them course through her veins,\nshe interrogated them, asking if they were all love, all passion. But\nlanguor at last overcame her, and she fell into gentle slumber. Silvere\nhad enveloped her in her pelisse, drawing the skirt around himself at\nthe same time. They no longer felt cold. The young man rejoiced to find,\nfrom the regularity of her breathing, that the girl was now asleep;\nthis repose would enable them to proceed on their way with spirit. He\nresolved to let her slumber for an hour. The sky was still black, and\nthe approach of day was but faintly indicated by a whitish line in the\neast. Behind the lovers there must have been a pine wood whose musical\nawakening it was that the young man heard amidst the morning breezes.\nAnd meantime the wailing of the bells grew more sonorous in the\nquivering atmosphere, lulling Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slumber even as it had\naccompanied her passionate fever.\n\nUntil that troublous night, these young people had lived through one\nof those innocent idylls that blossom among the toiling masses, those\noutcasts and folks of simple mind amidst whom one may yet occasionally\nfind amours as primitive as those of the ancient Greek romances.\n\nMiette had been scarcely nine years old at the time when her father was\nsent to the galleys for shooting a gendarme. The trial of Chantegreil\nhad remained a memorable case in the province. The poacher boldly\nconfessed that he had killed the gendarme, but he swore that the latter\nhad been taking aim at him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI only anticipated him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ndefended myself; it was a duel, not a murder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He never desisted from\nthis line of argument. The presiding Judge of the Assizes could not make\nhim understand that, although a gendarme has the right to fire upon a\npoacher, a poacher has no right to fire upon a gendarme. Chantegreil\nescaped the guillotine, owing to his obviously sincere belief in his own\ninnocence, and his previous good character. The man wept like a child\nwhen his daughter was brought to him prior to his departure for Toulon.\nThe little thing, who had lost her mother in her infancy, dwelt at this\ntime with her grandfather at Chavanoz, a village in the passes of the\nSeille. When the poacher was no longer there, the old man and the\ngirl lived upon alms. The inhabitants of Chavanoz, all sportsmen and\npoachers, came to the assistance of the poor creatures whom the convict\nhad left behind him. After a while, however, the old man died of grief,\nand Miette, left alone by herself, would have had to beg on the high\nroads, if the neighbours had not remembered that she had an aunt at\nPlassans. A charitable soul was kind enough to take her to this aunt,\nwho did not, however, receive her very kindly.\n\nEulalie Chantegreil, the spouse of _meger_ Rebufat, was a big, dark,\nstubborn creature, who ruled the home. She led her husband by the noise,\nsaid the people of the Faubourg of Plassans. The truth was, Rebufat,\navaricious and eager for work and gain, felt a sort of respect for this\nbig creature, who combined uncommon vigour with strict sobriety and\neconomy.\n\nThanks to her, the household thrived. The _meger_ grumbled one evening\nwhen, on returning home from work, he found Miette installed there. But\nhis wife closed his mouth by saying in her gruff voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBah, the little\nthing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strongly built, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do for a servant; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep her and save\nwages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis calculation pleased Rebufat. He went so far as to feel the little\nthing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms, and declared with satisfaction that she was sturdy for her\nage. Miette was then nine years old. From the very next day he made use\nof her. The work of the peasant-woman in the South of France is much\nlighter than in the North. One seldom sees them employed in digging the\nground, carrying loads, or doing other kinds of men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. They bind\nsheaves, gather olives and mulberry leaves; perhaps their most laborious\nwork is that of weeding. Miette worked away willingly. Open-air life\nwas her delight, her health. So long as her aunt lived she was always\nsmiling. The good woman, in spite of her roughness, at last loved her\nas her own child; she forbade her doing the hard work which her husband\nsometimes tried to force upon her, saying to the latter:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a clever fellow! You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand, you fool, that if you\ntire her too much to-day, she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to do anything to-morrow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis argument was decisive. Rebufat bowed his head, and carried the load\nwhich he had desired to set on the young girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders.\n\nThe latter would have lived in perfect happiness under the secret\nprotection of her aunt Eulalie, but for the teasing of her cousin, who\nwas then a lad of sixteen, and employed his idle hours in hating and\npersecuting her. Justin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happiest moments were those when by means of\nsome gross falsehood he succeeded in getting her scolded. Whenever he\ncould tread on her feet, or push her roughly, pretending not to have\nseen her, he laughed and felt the delight of those crafty folks who\nrejoice at other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misfortunes. Miette, however, would stare at\nhim with her large black childish eyes gleaming with anger and silent\nscorn, which checked the cowardly youngster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sneers. In reality he was\nterribly afraid of his cousin.\n\nThe young girl was just attaining her eleventh year when her aunt\nEulalie suddenly died. From that day everything changed in the house.\nRebufat gradually come to treat her like a farm-labourer. He overwhelmed\nher with all sorts of rough work, and made use of her as a beast of\nburden. She never even complained, however, thinking that she had a debt\nof gratitude to repay him. In the evening, when she was worn out with\nfatigue, she mourned for her aunt, that terrible woman whose latent\nkindliness she now realised. However, it was not the hard work that\ndistressed her, for she delighted in her strength, and took a pride in\nher big arms and broad shoulders. What distressed her was her uncle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndistrustful surveillance, his continual reproaches, and the irritated\nemployer-like manner he assumed towards her. She had now become a\nstranger in the house. Yet even a stranger would not have been so badly\ntreated as she was. Rebufat took the most unscrupulous advantage of\nthis poor little relative, whom he pretended to keep out of charity. She\nrepaid his harsh hospitality ten times over with her work, and yet never\na day passed but he grudged her the bread she ate. Justin especially\nexcelled in wounding her. Since his mother had been dead, seeing her\nwithout a protector, he had brought all his evil instincts into play in\ntrying to make the house intolerable to her. The most ingenious torture\nwhich he invented was to speak to Miette of her father. The poor girl,\nliving away from the world, under the protection of her aunt, who had\nforbidden any one ever to mention the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cgalleys\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cconvict\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n before her, hardly understood their meaning. It was Justin who explained\nit to her by relating, in his own manner, the story of the murder of the\ngendarme, and Chantegreil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conviction. There was no end to the horrible\nparticulars he supplied: the convicts had a cannonball fastened to one\nankle by a chain, they worked fifteen hours a day, and all died under\ntheir punishment; their prison, too, was a frightful place, the horrors\nof which he described minutely. Miette listened to him, stupefied, her\neyes full of tears. Sometimes she was roused to sudden violence, and\nJustin quickly retired before her clenched fists. However, he took a\nsavage delight in thus instructing her as to the nature of prison\nlife. When his father flew into a passion with the child for any little\nnegligence, he chimed in, glad to be able to insult her without danger.\nAnd if she attempted to defend herself, he would exclaim: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBah! bad\nblood always shows itself. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll end at the galleys like your father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this Miette sobbed, stung to the heart, powerless and overwhelmed\nwith shame.\n\nShe was already growing to womanhood at this period. Of precocious\nnature, she endured her martyrdom with extraordinary fortitude. She\nrarely gave way, excepting when her natural pride succumbed to her\ncousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outrages. Soon even, she was able to bear, without a tear, the\nincessant insults of this cowardly fellow, who ever watched her while he\nspoke, for fear lest she should fly at his face. Then, too, she learnt\nto silence him by staring at him fixedly. She had several times felt\ninclined to run away from the Jas-Meiffren; but she did not do so,\nas her courage could not brook the idea of confessing that she was\nvanquished by the persecution she endured. She certainly earned her\nbread, she did not steal the Rebufats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hospitality; and this conviction\nsatisfied her pride. So she remained there to continue the struggle,\nstiffening herself and living on with the one thought of resistance. Her\nplan was to do her work in silence, and revenge herself for all harsh\ntreatment by mute contempt. She knew that her uncle derived too much\nadvantage from her to listen readily to the insinuations of Justin,\nwho longed to get her turned out of doors. And in a defiant spirit she\nresolved that she would not go away of her own accord.\n\nHer continuous voluntary silence was full of strange fancies. Passing\nher days in the enclosure, isolated from all the world, she formed ideas\nfor herself which would have strangely shocked the good people of the\nFaubourg. Her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fate particularly occupied her thoughts. All\nJustin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abuse recurred to her; and she ended by accepting the charge\nof murder, saying to herself, however, that her father had done well\nto kill the gendarme who had tried to kill him. She had learnt the real\nstory from a labourer who had worked for a time at the Jas-Meiffren.\nFrom that moment, on the few occasions when she went out, she no longer\neven turned if the ragamuffins of the Faubourg followed her, crying:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey! La Chantegreil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe simply hastened her steps homeward, with lips compressed, and black,\nfierce eyes. Then after shutting the gate, she perhaps cast one long\nglance at the gang of urchins. She would have become vicious, have\nlapsed into fierce pariah savagery, if her childishness had not\nsometimes gained the mastery. Her extreme youth brought her little\ngirlish weaknesses which relieved her. She would then cry with shame for\nherself and her father. She would hide herself in a stable so that she\nmight sob to her heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content, for she knew that, if the others saw\nher crying, they would torment her all the more. And when she had wept\nsufficiently, she would bathe her eyes in the kitchen, and then again\nsubside into uncomplaining silence. It was not interest alone, however,\nwhich prompted her to hide herself; she carried her pride in her\nprecocious strength so far that she was unwilling to appear a child. In\ntime she would have become very unhappy. Fortunately she was saved by\ndiscovering the latent tenderness of her loving nature.\n\nThe well in the yard of the house occupied by aunt Dide and Silvere was\na party-well. The wall of the Jas-Meiffren cut it in halves. Formerly,\nbefore the Fouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 property was united to the neighbouring estate, the\nmarket-gardeners had used this well daily. Since the transfer of the\nFouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ground, however, as it was at some distance from the outhouses,\nthe inmates of the Jas, who had large cisterns at their disposal, did\nnot draw a pail of water from it in a month. On the other side, one\ncould hear the grating of the pulley every morning when Silvere drew the\nwater for aunt Dide.\n\nOne day the pulley broke. The young wheelwright made a good strong one\nof oak, and put it up in the evening after his day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work. To do this\nhe had to climb upon the wall. When he had finished the job he remained\nresting astride the coping, and surveyed with curiosity the large\nexpanse of the Jas-Meiffren. At last a peasant-girl, who was weeding the\nground a few feet from him, attracted his attention. It was in July, and\nthe air was broiling, although the sun had already sank to the horizon.\nThe peasant-girl had taken off her jacket. In a white bodice, with a\ncoloured neckerchief tied over her shoulders, and the sleeves of her\nchemise turned up as far as her elbows, she was squatting amid the folds\nof her blue cotton skirt, which was secured to a pair of braces crossed\nbehind her back. She crawled about on her knees as she pulled up the\ntares and threw them into a basket. The young man could only see her\nbare, sun-tanned arms stretching out right and left to seize some\noverlooked weed. He followed this rapid play of her arms complacently,\nderiving a singular pleasure from seeing them so firm and quick. The\nyoung person had slightly raised herself on noticing that he was\nno longer at work, but had again lowered her head before he could\ndistinguish her features. This shyness kept him in suspense. Like an\ninquisitive lad he wondered who this weeder could be, and while he\nlingered there, whistling and beating time with a chisel, the latter\nsuddenly slipped out of his hand. It fell into the Jas-Meiffren,\nstriking the curb of the well, and then bounding a few feet from the\nwall. Silvere looked at it, leaning forward and hesitating to get over.\nBut the peasant-girl must have been watching the young man askance, for\nshe jumped up without saying anything, picked up the chisel, and handed\nit to Silvere, who then perceived that she was a mere child. He was\nsurprised and rather intimidated. The young girl raised herself towards\nhim in the red glare of the sunset. The wall at this spot was low, but\nnevertheless too high for her to reach him. So he bent low over the\ncoping, while she still raised herself on tiptoes. They did not speak,\nbut looked at each other with an air of smiling confusion. The young man\nwould indeed have liked to keep the girl in that position. She turned to\nhim a charming head, with handsome black eyes, and red lips, which quite\nastonished and stirred him. He had never before seen a girl so near;\nhe had not known that lips and eyes could be so pleasant to look at.\nEverything about the girl seemed to possess a strange fascination for\nhim--her coloured neckerchief, her white bodice, her blue cotton skirt\nhanging from braces which stretched with the motion of her shoulders.\nThen his glance glided along the arm which was handing him the tool; as\nfar as the elbow this arm was of a golden brown, as though clothed with\nsun-burn; but higher up, in the shadow of the tucked-up sleeve, Silvere\nperceived a bare, milk-white roundness. At this he felt confused;\nhowever, he leant further over, and at last managed to grasp the chisel.\nThe little peasant-girl was becoming embarrassed. Still they remained\nthere, smiling at each other, the child beneath with upturned face, and\nthe lad half reclining on the coping of the wall. They could not part\nfrom each other. So far they had not exchanged a word, and Silvere even\nforgot to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the peasant-girl; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut everybody calls me Miette.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgain she raised herself slightly, and in a clear voice inquired in her\nturn: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name is Silvere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young workman replied.\n\nA pause ensued, during which they seemed to be listening complacently to\nthe music of their names.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fifteen years old,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed Silvere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miette; \u00e2\u0080\u009coh, I shall be eleven on All Saints\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young workman made a gesture of surprise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! really!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\nlaughing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand to think I took you for a woman! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve such big arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe also began to laugh, as she lowered her eyes to her arms. Then they\nceased speaking. They remained for another moment gazing and smiling at\neach other. And finally, as Silvere seemingly had no more questions to\nask her, Miette quietly withdrew and went on plucking her weeds, without\nraising her head. The lad for his part remained on the wall for a while.\nThe sun was setting; a stream of oblique rays poured over the yellow\nsoil of the Jas-Meiffren, which seemed to be all ablaze--one would have\nsaid that a fire was running along the ground--and, in the midst of the\nflaming expanse, Silvere saw the little stooping peasant-girl, whose\nbare arms had resumed their rapid motion. The blue cotton skirt was\nnow becoming white; and rays of light streamed over the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncopper-coloured arms. At last Silvere felt somewhat ashamed of remaining\nthere, and accordingly got off the wall.\n\nIn the evening, preoccupied with his adventure, he endeavoured to\nquestion aunt Dide. Perhaps she would know who this Miette was who had\nsuch black eyes and such red lips. But, since she had lived in the house\nin the alley, the old woman had never once given a look behind the wall\nof the little yard. It was, to her, like an impassable rampart, which\nshut off her past. She did not know--she did not want to know--what\nthere might now be on the other side of that wall, in that old enclosure\nof the Fouques, where she had buried her love, her heart and her flesh.\nAs soon as Silvere began to question her she looked at him with childish\nterror. Was he, then, going to stir up the ashes of those days now dead\nand gone, and make her weep like her son Antoine had done?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a hasty voice; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI no longer go out, I never\nsee anybody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere waited the morrow with considerable impatience. And as soon\nas he got to his master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workshop, he drew his fellow-workmen into\nconversation. He did not say anything about his interview with Miette;\nbut spoke vaguely of a girl whom he had seen from a distance in the\nJas-Meiffren.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s La Chantegreil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried one of the workmen.\n\nThere was no necessity for Silvere to question them further, for they\ntold him the story of the poacher Chantegreil and his daughter Miette,\nwith that unreasoning spite which is felt for social outcasts. The girl,\nin particular, they treated in a foul manner; and the insulting gibe\nof \u00e2\u0080\u009cdaughter of a galley-slave\u00e2\u0080\u009d constantly rose to their lips like an\nincontestable reason for condemning the poor, dear innocent creature to\neternal disgrace.\n\nHowever, wheelwright Vian, an honest, worthy fellow, at last silenced\nhis men.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold your tongues, you foul mouths!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as he let fall the\nshaft of a cart that he had been examining. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ought to be ashamed of\nyourselves for being so hard upon the child. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen her, the little\nthing looks a very good girl. Besides, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m told she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind work,\nand already does as much as any woman of thirty. There are some lazy\nfellows here who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a match for her. I hope, later on, that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nget a good husband who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stop this evil talk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere, who had been chilled by the workmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gross jests and insults,\nfelt tears rise to his eyes at the last words spoken by Vian. However,\nhe did not open his lips. He took up his hammer, which he had laid down\nnear him, and began with all his might to strike the nave of a wheel\nwhich he was binding with iron.\n\nIn the evening, as soon as he had returned home from the workshop, he\nran to the wall and climbed upon it. He found Miette engaged upon the\nsame labour as the day before. He called her. She came to him, with her\nsmile of embarrassment, and the charming shyness of a child who from\ninfancy had grown up in tears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re La Chantegreil, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked her, abruptly.\n\nShe recoiled, she ceased smiling, and her eyes turned sternly black,\ngleaming with defiance. So this lad was going to insult her, like the\nothers! She was turning her back upon him, without giving an answer,\nwhen Silvere, perplexed by her sudden change of countenance, hastened to\nadd: \u00e2\u0080\u009cStay, I beg you--I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to pain you--I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got so many things\nto tell you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned round, still distrustful. Silvere, whose heart was full, and\nwho had resolved to relieve it, remained for a moment speechless, not\nknowing how to continue, for he feared lest he should commit a fresh\nblunder. At last he put his whole heart in one phrase: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you like\nme to be your friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in a voice full of emotion. And as\nMiette, in surprise, raised her eyes, which were again moist and\nsmiling, he continued with animation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that people try to vex\nyou. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to put a stop to it. I will be your protector now. Shall\nI?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe child beamed with delight. This proffered friendship roused her from\nall her evil dreams of taciturn hatred. Still she shook her head and\nanswered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want you to fight on my account. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have\ntoo much to do. Besides which, there are persons from whom you cannot\nprotect me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere wished to declare that he would defend her against the whole\nworld, but she closed his mouth with a coaxing gesture, as she added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nam satisfied to have you as a friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey then conversed together for a few minutes, lowering their voices as\nmuch as possible. Miette spoke to Silvere of her uncle and her cousin.\nFor all the world she would not have liked them to catch him astride\nthe coping of the wall. Justin would be implacable with such a weapon\nagainst her. She spoke of her misgivings with the fright of a schoolgirl\non meeting a friend with whom her mother has forbidden her to associate.\nSilvere merely understood, however, that he would not be able to see\nMiette at his pleasure. This made him very sad. Still, he promised that\nhe would not climb upon the wall any more. They were both endeavouring\nto find some expedient for seeing each other again, when Miette suddenly\nbegged him to go away; she had just caught sight of Justin, who was\ncrossing the grounds in the direction of the wall. Silvere quickly\ndescended. When he was in the little yard again, he remained by the wall\nto listen, irritated by his flight. After a few minutes he ventured to\nclimb again and cast a glance into the Jas-Meiffren, but he saw Justin\nspeaking with Miette, and quickly withdrew his head. On the following\nday he could see nothing of his friend, not even in the distance; she\nmust have finished her work in that part of the Jas. A week passed in\nthis fashion, and the young people had no opportunity of exchanging a\nsingle word. Silvere was in despair; he thought of boldly going to the\nRebufats to ask for Miette.\n\nThe party-well was a large one, but not very deep. On either side of\nthe wall the curb formed a large semicircle. The water was only ten or\ntwelve feet down at the utmost. This slumbering water reflected the two\napertures of the well, two half-moons between which the shadow of the\nwall cast a black streak. On leaning over, one might have fancied in the\nvague light that the half-moons were two mirrors of singular clearness\nand brilliance. Under the morning sunshine, when the dripping of the\nropes did not disturb the surface of the water, these mirrors, these\nreflections of the heavens, showed like white patches on the green\nwater, and in them the leaves of the ivy which had spread along the wall\nover the well were repeated with marvellous exactness.\n\nOne morning, at an early hour, Silvere, as he came to draw water for\naunt Dide, bent over the well mechanically, just as he was taking hold\nof the rope. He started, and then stood motionless, still leaning over.\nHe had fancied that he could distinguish in the well the face of a young\ngirl who was looking at him with a smile; however, he had shaken the\nrope, and the disturbed water was now but a dim mirror that no longer\nreflected anything clearly. Silvere, who did not venture to stir, and\nwhose heart beat rapidly, then waited for the water to settle. As\nits ripples gradually widened and died away, he perceived the image\nreappearing. It oscillated for a long time, with a swing which lent\na vague, phantom-like grace to its features, but at last it remained\nstationary. It was the smiling countenance of Miette, with her head\nand shoulders, her coloured neckerchief, her white bodice, and her blue\nbraces. Silvere next perceived his own image in the other mirror. Then,\nknowing that they could see each other, they nodded their heads. For\nthe first moment, they did not even think of speaking. At last they\nexchanged greetings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morning, Silvere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morning, Miette.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey were surprised by the strange sound of their voices, which became\nsingularly soft and sweet in that damp hole. The sound seemed, indeed,\nto come from a distance, like the soft music of voices heard of an\nevening in the country. They understood that it would suffice to speak\nin a whisper in order to hear each other. The well echoed the faintest\nbreath. Leaning over its brink, they conversed while gazing at one\nanother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reflection. Miette related how sad she had been the last week.\nShe was now working at the other end of the Jas, and could only get out\nearly in the morning. Then she made a pout of annoyance which Silvere\ndistinguished perfectly, and to which he replied by nodding his head\nwith an air of vexation. They were exchanging all those gestures and\nfacial expressions that speech entails. They cared but little for the\nwall which separated them now that they could see each other in those\nhidden depths.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Miette, with a knowing look, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you came here to\ndraw water every morning at the same hour. I can hear the grating of the\npulley from the house. So I made an excuse, I pretended that the water\nin this well boiled the vegetables better. I thought that I might come\nhere every morning to draw water at the same time as you, so as to say\ngood morning to you without anyone suspecting it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe smiled innocently, as though well pleased with her device, and\nended by saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I did not imagine we should see each other in the\nwater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was, in fact, this unhoped-for pleasure which so delighted them. They\nonly spoke to see their lips move, so greatly did this new frolic amuse\ntheir childish natures. And they resolved to use all means in their\npower to meet here every morning. When Miette had said that she must go\naway, she told Silvere that he could draw his pail of water. But he did\nnot dare to shake the rope; Miette was still leaning over--he could see\nher smiling face, and it was too painful to him to dispel that smile. As\nhe slightly stirred his pail, the water murmured, and the smile faded.\nThen he stopped, seized with a strange fear; he fancied that he had\nvexed her and made her cry. But the child called to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on! go on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n with a laugh which the echo prolonged and rendered more sonorous. She\nherself then nosily sent down a pail. There was a perfect tempest.\nEverything disappeared under the black water. And Silvere made up his\nmind to fill two pitchers, while listening to the retreating steps of\nMiette on the other side of the wall.\n\nFrom that day, the young people never missed their assignations. The\nslumbering water, the white mirrors in which they gazed at one another,\nimparted to their interviews a charm which long sufficed their playful,\nchildish imaginations. They had no desire to see each other face to\nface: it seemed much more amusing to them to use the well as a mirror,\nand confide their morning greetings to its echo. They soon came to look\nupon the well as an old friend. They loved to bend over the motionless\nwater that resembled molten silver. A greenish glimmer hovered below,\nin a mysterious half light, and seemed to change the damp hole into some\nhiding-place in the depths of a wood. They saw each other in a sort\nof greenish nest bedecked with moss, in the midst of fresh water and\nfoliage. And all the strangeness of the deep spring, the hollow tower\nover which they bent, trembling with fascination, added unconfessed and\ndelightful fear to their merry laughter. The wild idea occurred to them\nof going down and seating themselves on a row of large stones which\nformed a kind of circular bench at a few inches above the water. They\nwould dip their feet in the latter, converse there for hours, and no\none would think of coming to look for them in such a spot. But when\nthey asked each other what there might be down there, their vague fears\nreturned; they thought it quite sufficient to let their reflected images\ndescend into the depths amidst those green glimmers which tinged the\nstones with strange moire-like reflections, and amidst those mysterious\nnoises which rose from the dark corners. Those sounds issuing from the\ninvisible made them particularly uneasy; they often fancied that voices\nwere replying to their own; and then they would remain silent, detecting\na thousand faint plaints which they could not understand. These came\nfrom the secret travail of the moisture, the sighs of the atmosphere,\nthe drops that glided over the stones, and fell below with the\nsonorousness of sobs. They would nod affectionately to each other\nin order to reassure themselves. Thus the attraction which kept them\nleaning over the brink had a tinge of secret terror, like all poignant\ncharms. But the well still remained their old friend. It was such\nan excellent pretext for meeting! Justin, who watched Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s every\nmovement, never suspected the cause of her eagerness to go and draw some\nwater every morning. At times, he saw her from the distance, leaning\nover and loitering. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! the lazy thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered; \u00e2\u0080\u009chow fond she is\nof dawdling about!\u00e2\u0080\u009d How could he suspect that, on the other side of the\nwall, there was a wooer contemplating the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile in the water, and\nsaying to her: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that red-haired donkey Justin should illtreat you,\njust tell me of it, and he shall hear from me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis amusement lasted for more than a month. It was July then; the\nmornings were sultry; the sun shone brightly, and it was quite a\npleasure to come to that damp spot. It was delightful to feel the cold\nbreath of the well on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and make love amidst this spring water\nwhile the skies were kindling their fires. Miette would arrive out of\nbreath after crossing the stubble fields; as she ran along, her hair\nfell down over her forehead and temples; and it was with flushed face\nand dishevelled locks that she would lean over, shaking with laughter,\nalmost before she had had time to set her pitcher down. Silvere, who\nwas almost always the first at the well, felt, as he suddenly saw her\nsmiling face in the water, as keen a joy as he would have experienced\nhad she suddenly thrown herself into his arms at the bend of a pathway.\nAround them the radiant morning hummed with mirth; a wave of warm light,\nsonorous with the buzzing of insects, beat against the old wall, the\nposts, and the curbstone. They, however, no longer saw the shower of\nmorning sunshine, nor heard the thousand sounds rising from the ground;\nthey were in the depths of their green hiding-place, under the earth, in\nthat mysterious and awesome cavity, and quivered with pleasure as they\nlingered there enjoying its fresh coolness and dim light.\n\nOn some mornings, Miette, who by nature could not long maintain a\ncontemplative attitude, began to tease; she would shake the rope, and\nmake drops of water fall in order to ripple the mirrors and deface the\nreflections. Silvere would then entreat her to remain still; he, whose\nfervour was deeper than hers, knew no keener pleasure than that of\ngazing at his love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image reflected so distinctly in every feature.\nBut she would not listen to him; she would joke and feign a rough old\nbogey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice, to which the echo imparted a raucous melodiousness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would say in chiding fashion; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t love you to-day!\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m making faces at you; see how ugly I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she laughed at seeing the fantastic forms which their spreading\nfaces assumed as they danced upon the disturbed water.\n\nOne morning she got angry in real earnest. She did not find Silvere at\nthe trysting-place, and waited for him for nearly a quarter of an hour,\nvainly making the pulley grate. She was just about to depart in a rage\nwhen he arrived. As soon as she perceived him she let a perfect tempest\nloose in the well, shook her pail in an irritated manner, and made the\nblackish water whirl and splash against the stones. In vain did Silvere\ntry to explain that aunt Dide had detained him. To all his excuses she\nreplied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve vexed me; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to see you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe poor lad, in despair, vainly questioned that sombre cavity, now so\nfull of lamentable sounds, where, on other days, such a bright vision\nusually awaited him amid the silence of the stagnant water. He had to go\naway without seeing Miette. On the morrow, arriving before the time,\nhe gazed sadly into the well, hearing nothing, and thinking that the\nobstinate girl would not come, when she, who was already on the other\nside slyly watching his arrival, bent over suddenly with a burst of\nlaughter. All was at once forgotten.\n\nIn this wise the well was the scene of many a little drama and comedy.\nThat happy cavity, with its gleaming mirrors and musical echoes, quickly\nripened their love. They endowed it with such strange life, so filled it\nwith their youthful love, that, long after they had ceased to come and\nlean over the brink, Silvere, as he drew water every morning, would\nfancy he could see Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smiling face in the dim light that still\nquivered with the joy they had set there.\n\nThat month of playful love rescued Miette from her mute despair. She\nfelt a revival of her affections, her happy childish carelessness, which\nhad been held in check by the hateful loneliness in which she lived.\nThe certainty that she was loved by somebody, and that she was no longer\nalone in the world, enabled her to endure the persecutions of Justin\nand the Faubourg urchins. A song of joy, whose glad notes drowned their\nhootings, now sounded in her heart. She thought of her father with\ntender compassion, and did not now so frequently yield to dreams of\nbitter vengeance. Her dawning love cooled her feverish broodings\nlike the fresh breezes of the dawn. At the same time she acquired the\ninstinctive cunning of a young girl in love. She felt that she must\nmaintain her usual silent and rebellious demeanour if she were to escape\nJustin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suspicions. But, in spite of her efforts, her eyes retained a\nsweet unruffled expression when the lad bullied her; she was no longer\nable to put on her old black look of indignant anger. One morning he\nheard her humming to herself at breakfast-time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou seem very gay, Chantegreil!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to her suspiciously, glancing\nkeenly at her from his lowering eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI bet you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been up to some of\nyour tricks again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, but she trembled inwardly; and she did all\nshe could to regain her old appearance of rebellious martyrdom. However,\nthough Justin suspected some secret happiness, it was long before he was\nable to discover how his victim had escaped him.\n\nSilvere, on his side, enjoyed profound happiness. His daily meetings\nwith Miette made his idle hours pass pleasantly away. During his\nlong silent companionship with aunt Dide, he recalled one by one his\nremembrances of the morning, revelling in their most trifling details.\nFrom that time forward, the fulness of his heart cloistered him yet more\nin the lonely existence which he had adopted with his grandmother. He\nwas naturally fond of hidden spots, of solitary retirement, where he\ncould give himself up to his thoughts. At this period already he had\neagerly begun to read all the old odd volumes which he could pick up at\nbrokers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 shops in the Faubourg, and which were destined to lead him to\na strange and generous social religion and morality. His\nreading--ill-digested and lacking all solid foundation--gave him\nglimpses of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vanities and pleasures, especially with regard\nto women, which would have seriously troubled his mind if his heart\nhad not been contented. When Miette came, he received her at first as\na companion, then as the joy and ambition of his life. In the evening,\nwhen he had retired to the little nook where he slept, and hung his lamp\nat the head of his strap-bedstead, he would find Miette on every page of\nthe dusty old volume which he had taken at random from a shelf above his\nhead and was reading devoutly. He never came across a young girl, a good\nand beautiful creature, in his reading, without immediately identifying\nher with his sweetheart. And he would set himself in the narrative as\nwell. If he were reading a love story, it was he who married Miette at\nthe end, or died with her. If, on the contrary, he were perusing some\npolitical pamphlet, some grave dissertation on social economy, works\nwhich he preferred to romances, for he had that singular partiality for\ndifficult subjects which characterises persons of imperfect scholarship,\nhe still found some means of associating her with the tedious themes\nwhich frequently he could not even understand. For instance, he tried\nto persuade himself that he was learning how to be good and kind to her\nwhen they were married. He thus associated her with all his visionary\ndreamings. Protected by the purity of his affection against the\nobscenity of certain eighteenth-century tales which fell into his hands,\nhe found particular pleasure in shutting himself up with her in those\nhumanitarian Utopias which some great minds of our own time, infatuated\nby visions of universal happiness have imagined. Miette, in his mind,\nbecame quite essential to the abolition of pauperism and the definitive\ntriumph of the principles of the Revolution. There were nights of\nfeverish reading, when his mind could not tear itself from his book,\nwhich he would lay down and take up at least a score of times, nights\nof voluptuous weariness which he enjoyed till daybreak like some secret\norgie, cramped up in that tiny room, his eyes troubled by the flickering\nyellow light, while he yielded to the fever of insomnia and schemed\nout new social schemes of the most absurdly ingenuous nature, in which\nwoman, always personified by Miette, was worshipped by the nations on\ntheir knees.\n\nHe was predisposed to Utopian ideas by certain hereditary influences;\nhis grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nervous disorders became in him so much chronic\nenthusiasm, striving after everything that was grandiose and impossible.\nHis lonely childhood, his imperfect education, had developed his natural\ntendencies in a singular manner. However, he had not yet reached the age\nwhen the fixed idea plants itself in a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind. In the morning, after\nhe had dipped his head in a bucket of water, he remembered his thoughts\nand visions of the night but vaguely; nothing remained of his dreams\nsave a childlike innocence, full of trustful confidence and yearning\ntenderness. He felt like a child again. He ran to the well, solely\ndesirous of meeting his sweetheart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile, and tasting the delights\nof the radiant morning. And during the day, when thoughts of the future\nsometimes made him silent and dreamy, he would often, prompted by some\nsudden impulse, spring up and kiss aunt Dide on both cheeks, whereat the\nold woman would gaze at him anxiously, perturbed at seeing his eyes so\nbright, and gleaming with a joy which she thought she could divine.\n\nAt last, as time went on, Miette and Silvere began to tire of only\nseeing each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reflection. The novelty of their play was gone, and\nnow they began to dream of keener pleasures than the well could afford\nthem. In this longing for reality which came upon them, there was the\nwish to see each other face to face, to run through the open fields, and\nreturn out of breath with their arms around each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist, clinging\nclosely together in order that they might the better feel each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlove. One morning Silvere spoke of climbing over the wall, and walking\nin the Jas with Miette. But the child implored him not to perpetrate\nsuch folly, which would place her at Justin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mercy. He then promised to\nseek some other means.\n\nThe wall in which the well was set made a sudden bend a few paces\nfurther on, thereby forming a sort of recess, where the lovers would be\nfree from observation, if they were to take shelter there. The question\nwas how to reach this recess. Silvere could no longer entertain the idea\nof climbing over, as Miette had appeared so afraid. He secretly thought\nof another plan. The little door which Macquart and Adelaide had set up\none night long years previously had remained forgotten in this remote\ncorner. The owner of the Jas-Meiffren had not even thought of blocking\nit up. Blackened by damp and green with moss, its lock and hinges eaten\naway with rust, it looked like a part of the old wall. Doubtless the\nkey was lost; the grass growing beside the lower boards, against which\nslight mounds had formed, amply proved that no one had passed that way\nfor many a long year. However, it was the lost key that Silvere hoped to\nfind. He knew with what devotion his aunt Dide allowed the relics of the\npast to lie rotting wherever they might be. He searched the house for a\nweek without any result, and went stealthily night by night to see if\nhe had at last put his hand on the right key during the daytime. In this\nway he tried more than thirty keys which had doubtless come from the old\nproperty of the Fouques, and which he found all over the place, against\nthe walls, on the floors, and at the bottom of drawers. He was becoming\ndisheartened, when all at once he found the precious key. It was simply\ntied by a string to the street door latch-key, which always remained in\nthe lock. It had hung there for nearly forty years. Aunt Dide must every\nday have touched it with her hand, without ever making up her mind to\nthrow it away, although it could now only carry her back sorrowfully\ninto the past. When Silvere had convinced himself that it really opened\nthe little door, he awaited the ensuing day, dreaming of the joyful\nsurprise which he was preparing for Miette. He had not told her for what\nhe had been searching.\n\nOn the morrow, as soon as he heard the girl set her pitcher down, he\ngently opened the door, sweeping away with a push the tall weeds which\ncovered the threshold. Stretching out his head, he saw Miette leaning\nover the brink of the well, looking into the water, absorbed in\nexpectation. Thereupon, in a couple of strides, he reached the recess\nformed by the wall, and thence called, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiette! Miette!\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a soft\nvoice, which made her tremble. She raised her head, thinking he was on\nthe coping of the wall. But when she saw him in the Jas, at a few steps\nfrom her, she gave a faint cry of surprise, and ran up to him. They took\neach other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand, and looked at one another, delighted to be so near,\nthinking themselves far handsomer like this, in the warm sunshine. It\nwas the middle of August, the Feast of the Assumption. In the\ndistance, the bells were pealing in the limpid atmosphere that so often\naccompanies great days of festival, an atmosphere full of bright gaiety.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morning, Silvere!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morning, Miette!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe voices in which they exchanged their morning greetings sounded\nstrange to them. They knew only the muffled accents transmitted by the\necho of the well. And now their voices seemed to them as clear as the\nnotes of a lark. And ah! how delightful it was in that warm corner, in\nthat holiday atmosphere! They still held each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands. Silvere\nleaning against the wall, Miette with her figure slightly thrown\nbackwards. They were about to tell each other all the soft things which\nthey had not dared to confide to the reverberations of the well, when\nSilvere, hearing a slight noise, started, and, turning pale, dropped\nMiette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands. He had just seen aunt Dide standing before him erect and\nmotionless on the threshold of the doorway.\n\nThe grandmother had come to the well by chance. And on perceiving, in\nthe old black wall, the white gap formed by the doorway which Silvere\nhad left wide open, she had experienced a violent shock. That open gap\nseemed to her like a gulf of light violently illumining her past. She\nonce more saw herself running to the door amidst the morning brightness,\nand crossing the threshold full of the transports of her nervous love.\nAnd Macquart was there awaiting her. She hung upon his neck and pressed\nagainst his bosom, whilst the rising sun, following her through the\ndoorway, which she had left open in her hurry, enveloped them with\nradiance. It was a sudden vision which roused her cruelly from the\nslumber of old age, like some supreme chastisement, and awakened a\nmultitude of bitter memories within her. Had the well, had the entire\nwall, disappeared beneath the earth, she would not have been more\nstupefied. She had never thought that this door would open again. In her\nmind it had been walled up ever since the hour of Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. And\namidst her amazement she felt angry, indignant with the sacrilegious\nhand that had penetrated this violation, and left that white open space\nagape like a yawning tomb. She stepped forward, yielding to a kind of\nfascination, and halted erect within the framework of the door.\n\nThen she gazed out before her, with a feeling of dolorous surprise. She\nhad certainly been told that the old enclosure of the Fouques was\nnow joined to the Jas-Meiffren; but she would never have thought the\nassociations of her youth could have vanished so completely. It seemed\nas though some tempest had carried off everything that her memory\ncherished. The old dwelling, the large kitchen-garden, the beds of green\nvegetables, all had disappeared. Not a stone, not a tree of former times\nremained. And instead of the scene amidst which she had grown up, and\nwhich in her mind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye she had seen but yesterday, there lay a strip\nof barren soil, a broad patch of stubbles, bare like a desert.\nHenceforward, when, on closing her eyes, she might try to recall the\nobjects of the past, that stubble would always appear to her like a\nshroud of yellowish drugget spread over the soil, in which her youth lay\nburied. In the presence of that unfamiliar commonplace scene her heart\ndied, as it were, a second time. Now all was completely, finally ended.\nShe was robbed even of her dreams of the past. Then she began to regret\nthat she had yielded to the attraction of that white opening, of that\ndoorway gaping upon the days which were now for ever lost.\n\nShe was about to retire and close the accursed door, without even\nseeking to discover who had opened it, when she suddenly perceived\nMiette and Silvere. And the sight of the two young lovers, who, with\nhanging heads, nervously awaited her glance, kept her on the threshold,\nquivering with yet keener pain. She now understood all. To the very end,\nshe was destined to picture herself there, clasped in Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms\nin the bright sunshine. Yet a second time had the door served as an\naccomplice. Where love had once passed, there was it passing again.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Twas the eternal and endless renewal, with present joys and future\ntears. Aunt Dide could only see the tears, and a sudden presentiment\nshowed her the two children bleeding, with stricken hearts. Overwhelmed\nby the recollection of her life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sorrow, which this spot had just\nawakened within her, she grieved for her dear Silvere. She alone was\nguilty; if she had not formerly had that door made Silvere would not\nnow be at a girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet in that lonely nook, intoxicating himself with a\nbliss which prompts and angers the jealousy of death.\n\nAfter a brief pause, she went up to the young man, and, without a\nword, took him by the hand. She might, perhaps, have left them there,\nchattering under the wall, had she not felt that she herself was, to\nsome extent, an accomplice in this fatal love. As she came back with\nSilvere, she turned on hearing the light footfall of Miette, who, having\nquickly taken up her pitcher, was hastening across the stubble. She was\nrunning wildly, glad at having escaped so easily. And aunt Dide smiled\ninvoluntarily as she watched her bound over the ground like a runaway\ngoat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is very young,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe has plenty of time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe meant, no doubt, that Miette had plenty of time before her to suffer\nand weep. Then, turning her eyes upon Silvere, who with a glance of\necstasy had followed the child as she ran off in the bright sunshine,\nshe simply added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake care, my boy; this sort of thing sometimes kills\none.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese were the only words she spoke with reference to the incident which\nhad awakened all the sorrows that lay slumbering in the depths of her\nbeing. Silence had become a real religion with her. When Silvere came\nin, she double-locked the door, and threw the key down the well. In\nthis wise she felt certain that the door would no longer make her an\naccomplice. She examined it for a moment, glad at seeing it reassume its\nusual gloomy, barrier-like aspect. The tomb was closed once more; the\nwhite gap was for ever boarded up with that damp-stained mossy timber\nover which the snails had shed silvery tears.\n\nIn the evening, aunt Dide had another of those nervous attacks which\ncame upon her at intervals. At these times she would often talk aloud\nand ramble incoherently, as though she was suffering from nightmare.\nThat evening, while Silvere held her down on her bed, he heard her\nstammer in a panting voice such words as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccustom-house officer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cfire,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmurder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And she struggled, and begged for mercy, and dreamed aloud\nof vengeance. At last, as always happened when the attack was drawing to\na close, she fell into a strange fright, her teeth chattering, while her\nlimbs quivered with abject terror. Finally, after raising herself into\na sitting posture, she cast a haggard look of astonishment at one and\nanother corner of the room, and then fell back upon the pillow, heaving\ndeep sighs. She was, doubtless, a prey to some hallucination. However,\nshe drew Silvere to her bosom, and seemed to some degree to recognise\nhim, though ever and anon she confused him with someone else.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere they are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she stammered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you see? They are going to take\nyou, they will kill you again. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want them to--Send them away,\ntell them I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; tell them they are hurting me, staring at me like\nthat--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she turned to the wall, to avoid seeing the people of whom she was\ntalking. And after an interval of silence, she continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are near\nme, my child, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? You must not leave me. I thought I was going\nto die just now. We did wrong to make an opening in the wall. I have\nsuffered ever since. I was certain that door would bring us further\nmisfortune--Oh! the innocent darlings, what sorrow! They will kill them\nas well, they will be shot down like dogs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she relapsed into catalepsy; she was no longer even aware of\nSilvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence. Suddenly, however, she sat up, and gazed at the foot\nof her bed, with a fearful expression of terror.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you send them away?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, hiding her white head\nagainst the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are still there. The one with the\ngun is making signs that he is going to fire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShortly afterwards she fell into the heavy slumber that usually\nterminated these attacks. On the next day, she seemed to have forgotten\neverything. She never again spoke to Silvere of the morning on which she\nhad found him with a sweetheart behind the wall.\n\nThe young people did not see each other for a couple of days. When\nMiette ventured to return to the well, they resolved not to recommence\nthe pranks which had upset aunt Dide. However, the meeting which had\nbeen so strangely interrupted had filled them with a keen desire to\nmeet again in some happy solitude. Weary of the delights afforded by the\nwell, and unwilling to vex aunt Dide by seeing Miette again on the other\nside of the wall, Silvere begged the girl to meet him somewhere else.\nShe required but little pressing; she received the proposal with the\nwilling smile of a frolicsome lass who has no thought of evil. What\nmade her smile was the idea of outwitting that spy of a Justin. When the\nlovers had come to agreement, they discussed at length the choice of a\nfavourable spot. Silvere proposed the most impossible trysting-places.\nHe planned regular journeys, and even suggested meeting the young girl\nat midnight in the barns of the Jas-Meiffren. Miette, who was much more\npractical, shrugged her shoulders, declaring she would try to think of\nsome spot. On the morrow, she tarried but a minute at the well, just\ntime enough to smile at Silvere and tell him to be at the far end of the\nAire Saint-Mittre at about ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the evening. One may be\nsure that the young man was punctual. All day long Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice had\npuzzled him, and his curiosity increased when he found himself in the\nnarrow lane formed by the piles of planks at the end of the plot of\nground. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will come this way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself, looking along the\nroad to Nice. But he suddenly heard a loud shaking of boughs behind\nthe wall, and saw a laughing head, with tumbled hair, appear above the\ncoping, whilst a joyous voice called out: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd it was, in fact, Miette, who had climbed like an urchin up one of\nthe mulberry-trees, which even nowadays still border the boundary of\nthe Jas-Meiffren. In a couple of leaps she reached the tombstone, half\nburied in the corner at the end of the lane. Silvere watched her descend\nwith delight and surprise, without even thinking of helping her. As soon\nas she had alighted, however, he took both her hands in his, and said:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow nimble you are!--you climb better than I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was thus that they met for the first time in that hidden corner where\nthey were destined to pass such happy hours. From that evening forward\nthey saw each other there nearly every night. They now only used the\nwell to warn each other of unforeseen obstacles to their meetings, of\na change of time, and of all the trifling little news that seemed\nimportant in their eyes, and allowed of no delay. It sufficed for the\none who had a communication to make to set the pulley in motion, for its\ncreaking noise could be heard a long way off. But although, on certain\ndays, they summoned one another two or three times in succession to\nspeak of trifles of immense importance, it was only in the evening in\nthat lonely little passage that they tasted real happiness. Miette was\nexceptionally punctual. She fortunately slept over the kitchen, in a\nroom where the winter provisions had been kept before her arrival, and\nwhich was reached by a little private staircase. She was thus able to go\nout at all hours, without being seen by Rebufat or Justin. Moreover, if\nthe latter should ever see her returning she intended to tell him some\ntale or other, staring at him the while with that stern look which\nalways reduced him to silence.\n\nAh! how happy those warm evenings were! The lovers had now reached the\nfirst days of September, a month of bright sunshine in Provence. It was\nhardly possible for them to join each other before nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. Miette\narrived from over the wall, in surmounting which she soon acquired such\ndexterity that she was almost always on the old tombstone before Silvere\nhad time to stretch out his arms. She would laugh at her own strength\nand agility as, for a moment, with her hair in disorder, she remained\nalmost breathless, tapping her skirt to make it fall. Her sweetheart\nlaughingly called her an impudent urchin. In reality he much admired\nher pluck. He watched her jump over the wall with the complacency of an\nolder brother supervising the exercises of a younger one. Indeed,\nthere was yet much that was childlike in their growing love. On several\noccasions they spoke of going on some bird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-nesting expedition on the\nbanks of the Viorne.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see how I can climb,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miette proudly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I lived at\nChavanoz, I used to go right up to the top of old Andre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walnut-trees.\nHave you ever taken a magpie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very difficult!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen a discussion arose as to how one ought to climb a poplar. Miette\nstated her opinions, with all a boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confidence.\n\nHowever, Silvere, clasping her round the knees, had by this time lifted\nher to the ground, and then they would walk on, side by side, their arms\nencircling each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist. Though they were but children, fond of\nfrolicsome play and chatter, and knew not even how to speak of love, yet\nthey already partook of love\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delight. It sufficed them to press each\nother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands. Ignorant whither their feelings and their hearts were\ndrifting, they did not seek to hide the blissful thrills which the\nslightest touch awoke. Smiling, often wondering at the delight they\nexperienced, they yielded unconsciously to the sweetness of new feelings\neven while talking, like a couple of schoolboys, of the magpies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nests\nwhich are so difficult to reach.\n\nAnd as they talked they went down the silent path, between the piles of\nplanks and the wall of the Jas-Meiffren. They never went beyond the end\nof that narrow blind alley, but invariably retraced their steps. They\nwere quite at home there. Miette, happy in the knowledge of their\nsafe concealment, would often pause and congratulate herself on her\ndiscovery.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I lucky!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would gleefully exclaim. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe might walk a long way\nwithout finding such a good hiding-place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe thick grass muffled the noise of their footsteps. They were steeped\nin gloom, shut in between two black walls, and only a strip of dark sky,\nspangled with stars, was visible above their heads. And as they stepped\nalong, pacing this path which resembled a dark stream flowing beneath\nthe black star-sprent sky, they were often thrilled with undefinable\nemotion, and lowered their voices, although there was nobody to hear\nthem. Surrendering themselves as it were to the silent waves of night,\nover which they seemed to drift, they recounted to one another, with\nlovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rapture, the thousand trifles of the day.\n\nAt other times, on bright nights, when the moonlight clearly outlined\nthe wall and the timber-stacks, Miette and Silvere would romp about with\nall the carelessness of children. The path stretched out, alight with\nwhite rays, and retaining no suggestion of secrecy, and the young people\nlaughed and chased each other like boys at play, at times venturing even\nto climb upon the piles of timber. Silvere was occasionally obliged to\nfrighten Miette by telling her that Justin might be watching her from\nover the wall. Then, quite out of breath, they would stroll side\nby side, and plan how they might some day go for a scamper in the\nSainte-Claire meadows, to see which of the two would catch the other.\n\nTheir growing love thus accommodated itself to dark and clear nights.\nTheir hearts were ever on the alert, and a little shade sufficed to\nsweeten the pleasure of their embrace, and soften their laughter. This\ndearly-loved retreat--so gay in the moonshine, so strangely thrilling\nin the gloom--seemed an inexhaustible source of both gaiety and silent\nemotion. They would remain there until midnight, while the town dropped\noff to sleep and the lights in the windows of the Faubourg went out one\nby one.\n\nThey were never disturbed in their solitude. At that late hour children\nwere no longer playing at hide-and-seek behind the piles of planks.\nOccasionally, when the young couple heard sounds in the distance--the\nsinging of some workmen as they passed along the road, or conversation\ncoming from the neighbouring sidewalks--they would cast stealthy glances\nover the Aire Saint-Mittre. The timber-yard stretched out, empty of\nall, save here and there some falling shadows. On warm evenings they\nsometimes caught glimpses of loving couples there, and of old men\nsitting on the big beams by the roadside. When the evenings grew colder,\nall that they ever saw on the melancholy, deserted spot was some gipsy\nfire, before which, perhaps, a few black shadows passed to and fro.\nThrough the still night air words and sundry faint sounds were wafted to\nthem, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood-night\u00e2\u0080\u009d of a townsman shutting his door, the closing of a\nwindow-shutter, the deep striking of a clock, all the parting sounds of\na provincial town retiring to rest. And when Plassans was slumbering,\nthey might still hear the quarrelling of the gipsies and the crackling\nof their fires, amidst which suddenly rose the guttural voices of girls\nsinging in a strange tongue, full of rugged accents.\n\nBut the lovers did not concern themselves much with what went on in the\nAire Saint-Mittre; they hastened back into their own little privacy, and\nagain walked along their favourite retired path. Little did they care\nfor others, or for the town itself! The few planks which separated them\nfrom the wicked world seemed to them, after a while, an insurmountable\nrampart. They were so secluded, so free in this nook, situated though it\nwas in the very midst of the Faubourg, at only fifty paces from the Rome\nGate, that they sometimes fancied themselves far away in some hollow of\nthe Viorne, with the open country around them. Of all the sounds\nwhich reached them, only one made them feel uneasy, that of the clocks\nstriking slowly in the darkness. At times, when the hour sounded, they\npretended not to hear, at other moments they stopped short as if to\nprotest. However, they could not go on for ever taking just another\nten minutes, and so the time came when they were at last obliged to say\ngood-night. Then Miette reluctantly climbed upon the wall again. But all\nwas not ended yet, they would linger over their leave-taking for a\ngood quarter of an hour. When the girl had climbed upon the wall, she\nremained there with her elbows on the coping, and her feet supported\nby the branches of the mulberry-tree, which served her as a ladder.\nSilvere, perched on the tombstone, was able to take her hands again, and\nrenew their whispered conversation. They repeated \u00e2\u0080\u009ctill to-morrow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d a\ndozen times, and still and ever found something more to say. At last\nSilvere began to scold.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, you must get down, it is past midnight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Miette, with a girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waywardness, wished him to descend first; she\nwanted to see him go away. And as he persisted in remaining, she ended\nby saying abruptly, by way of punishment, perhaps: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook! I am going to\njump down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she sprang from the mulberry-tree, to the great consternation of\nSilvere. He heard the dull thud of her fall, and the burst of laughter\nwith which she ran off, without choosing to reply to his last adieu. For\nsome minutes he would remain watching her vague figure as it disappeared\nin the darkness, then, slowly descending, he regained the Impasse\nSaint-Mittre.\n\nDuring two years they came to the path every day. At the time of their\nfirst meetings they enjoyed some beautiful warm nights. They might\nalmost have fancied themselves in the month of May, the month of\nseething sap, when a pleasant odour of earth and fresh leaves pervades\nthe warm air. This _renouveau_, this second spring, was like a gift from\nheaven which allowed them to run freely about the path and tighten their\nbonds of affection.\n\nAt last came rain, and snow, and frost. But the disagreeableness of\nwinter did not keep them away. Miette put on her long brown pelisse, and\nthey both made light of the bad weather. When the nights were dry and\nclear, and puffs of wind raised the hoar frost beneath their footsteps\nand fell on their faces like taps from a switch, they refrained from\nsitting down. They walked quickly to and fro, wrapped in the pelisse,\ntheir cheeks blue with cold, and their eyes watering; and they laughed\nheartily, quite quivering with mirth, at the rapidity of their\nmarch through the freezing atmosphere. One snowy evening they amused\nthemselves with making an enormous snowball, which they rolled into\na corner. It remained there fully a month, which caused them fresh\nastonishment each time they met in the path. Nor did the rain frighten\nthem. They came to see each other through the heaviest downpours, though\nthey got wet to the skin in doing so. Silvere would hasten to the spot,\nsaying to himself that Miette would never be mad enough to come; and\nwhen Miette arrived, he could not find it in his heart to scold her.\nIn reality he had been expecting her. At last he sought some shelter\nagainst the inclement weather, knowing quite well that they would\ncertainly come out, however much they might promise one another not to\ndo so when it rained. To find a shelter he only had to disturb one of\nthe timber-stacks; pulling out several pieces of wood and arranging them\nso that they would move easily, in such wise that he could displace and\nreplace them at pleasure.\n\nFrom that time forward the lovers possessed a sort of low and narrow\nsentry-box, a square hole, which was only big enough to hold them\nclosely squeezed together on a beam which they had left at the bottom\nof the little cell. Whenever it rained, the first to arrive would take\nshelter here; and on finding themselves together again they would listen\nwith delight to the rain beating on the piles of planks. Before and\naround them, through the inky blackness of the night, came a rush of\nwater which they could not see, but which resounded continuously like\nthe roar of a mob. They were nevertheless quite alone, as though they\nhad been at the end of the world or beneath the sea. They never felt so\nhappy, so isolated, as when they found themselves in that timber-stack,\nin the midst of some such deluge which threatened to carry them away at\nevery moment. Their bent knees almost reached the opening, and though\nthey thrust themselves back as far as possible, the spray of the rain\nbathed their cheeks and hands. The big drops, falling from the planks,\nsplashed at regular intervals at their feet. The brown pelisse kept them\nwarm, and the nook was so small that Miette was compelled to sit almost\non Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knees. And they would chatter and then lapse into silence,\novercome with languor, lulled by the warmth of their embrace and the\nmonotonous beating of the shower. For hours and hours they remained\nthere, with that same enjoyment of the rain which prompts little\nchildren to stroll along solemnly in stormy weather with open umbrellas\nin their hands. After a while they came to prefer the rainy evenings,\nthough their parting became more painful on those occasions. Miette was\nobliged to climb the wall in the driving rain, and cross the puddles of\nthe Jas-Meiffren in perfect darkness. As soon as she had left his arms,\nshe was lost to Silvere amidst the gloom and the noise of the falling\nwater. In vain he listened, he was deafened, blinded. However, the\nanxiety caused by this brusque separation proved an additional charm,\nand, until the morrow, each would be uneasy lest anything should have\nbefallen the other in such weather, when one would not even have turned\na dog out of doors. Perchance one of them had slipped, or lost the way;\nsuch were the mutual fears which possessed them, and rendered their next\ninterview yet more loving.\n\nAt last the fine days returned, April brought mild nights, and the grass\nin the green alley sprouted up wildly. Amidst the stream of life flowing\nfrom heaven and rising from the earth, amidst all the intoxication of\nthe budding spring-time, the lovers sometimes regretted their winter\nsolitude, the rainy evenings and the freezing nights, during which they\nhad been so isolated so far from all human sounds. At present the days\ndid not draw to a close soon enough, and they grew impatient with the\nlagging twilights. When the night had fallen sufficiently for Miette to\nclimb upon the wall without danger of being seen, and they could at last\nglide along their dear path, they no longer found there the solitude\ncongenial to their shy, childish love. People began to flock to the Aire\nSaint-Mittre, the urchins of the Faubourg remained there, romping about\nthe beams, and shouting, till eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock at night. It even happened\noccasionally that one of them would go and hide behind the piles of\ntimber, and assail Miette and Silvere with boyish jeers. The fear of\nbeing surprised amidst that general awakening of life as the season\ngradually grew warmer, tinged their meetings with anxiety.\n\nThen, too, they began to stifle in the narrow lane. Never had it\nthrobbed with so ardent a quiver; never had that soil, in which the\nlast bones left of the former cemetery lay mouldering, sent forth such\noppressive and disturbing odours. They were still too young to relish\nthe voluptuous charm of that secluded nook which the springtide filled\nwith fever. The grass grew to their knees, they moved to and fro with\ndifficulty, and certain plants, when they crushed their young shoots,\nsent forth a pungent odour which made them dizzy. Then, seized with\nstrange drowsiness and staggering with giddiness, their feet as\nthough entangled in the grass, they would lean against the wall, with\nhalf-closed eyes, unable to move a step. All the soft languor from the\nskies seemed to penetrate them.\n\nWith the petulance of beginners, impatient and irritated at this sudden\nfaintness, they began to think their retreat too confined, and decided\nto ramble through the open fields. Every evening came fresh frolics.\nMiette arrived with her pelisse; they wrapped themselves in it, and\nthen, gliding past the walls, reached the high-road and the open\ncountry, the broad fields where the wind rolled with full strength,\nlike the waves at high tide. And here they no longer felt stifled; they\nrecovered all their youthfulness, free from the giddy intoxication born\nof the tall rank weeds of the Aire Saint-Mittre.\n\nDuring two summers they rambled through the district. Every rock ledge,\nevery bed of turf soon knew them; there was not a cluster of trees, a\nhedge, or a bush, which did not become their friend. They realized their\ndreams: they chased each other wildly over the meadows of Sainte-Claire,\nand Miette ran so well that Silvere had to put his best foot forward\nto catch her. Sometimes, too, they went in search of magpies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nests.\nHeadstrong Miette, wishing to show how she had climbed trees at\nChavanoz, would tie up her skirts with a piece of string, and ascend the\nhighest poplars; while Silvere stood trembling beneath, with his arms\noutstretched to catch her should she slip. These frolics so turned them\nfrom thoughts of love that one evening they almost fought like a couple\nof lads coming out of school. But there were nooks in the country side\nwhich were not healthful for them. So long as they rambled on they were\ncontinually shouting with laughter, pushing and teasing one another.\nThey covered miles and miles of ground; sometimes they went as far as\nthe chain of the Garrigues, following the narrowest paths and cutting\nacross the fields. The region belonged to them; they lived there as in a\nconquered territory, enjoying all that the earth and the sky could give\nthem. Miette, with a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lack of scruple, did not hesitate to pluck\na bunch of grapes, or a cluster of green almonds, from the vines\nand almond-trees whose boughs brushed her as she passed; and at this\nSilvere, with his absolute ideas of honesty, felt vexed, although he\ndid not venture to find fault with the girl, whose occasional sulking\ndistressed him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! the bad girl!\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought he, childishly exaggerating\nthe matter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe would make a thief of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Miette would thereupon\nforce his share of the stolen fruit into his mouth. The artifices he\nemployed, such as holding her round the waist, avoiding the fruit trees,\nand making her run after him when they were near the vines, so as\nto keep her out of the way of temptation, quickly exhausted his\nimagination. At last there was nothing to do but to make her sit\ndown. And then they again began to experience their former stifling\nsensations. The gloomy valley of the Viorne particularly disturbed\nthem. When weariness brought them to the banks of the torrent, all their\nchildish gaiety seemed to disappear. A grey shadow floated under the\nwillows, like the scented crape of a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dress. The children felt\nthis crape descend warm and balmy from the voluptuous shoulders of the\nnight, kiss their temples and envelop them with irresistible languor. In\nthe distance the crickets chirped in the meadows of Sainte-Claire,\nand at their feet the ripples of the Viorne sounded like lovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nwhispers--like the soft cooing of humid lips. The stars cast a rain of\nsparkles from the slumbering heavens. And, amidst the throbbing of the\nsky, the waters and the darkness, the children reposing on the grass\nsought each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands and pressed them.\n\nSilvere, who vaguely understood the danger of these ecstasies, would\nsometimes jump up and propose to cross over to one of the islets left\nby the low water in the middle of the stream. Both ventured forth, with\nbare feet. Miette made light of the pebbles, refusing Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s help,\nand it once happened that she sat down in the very middle of the stream;\nhowever, there were only a few inches of water, and she escaped with\nnothing worse than a wet petticoat. Then, having reached the island,\nthey threw themselves on the long neck of sand, their eyes on a level\nwith the surface of the river whose silvery scales they saw quivering\nfar away in the clear night. Then Miette would declare that they were\nin a boat, that the island was certainly floating; she could feel it\ncarrying her along. The dizziness caused by the rippling of the water\namused them for a moment, and they lingered there, singing in an\nundertone, like boatmen as they strike the water with their oars. At\nother times, when the island had a low bank, they sat there as on a bed\nof verdure, and let their bare feet dangle in the stream. And then for\nhours they chatted together, swinging their legs, and splashing the\nwater, delighted to set a tempest raging in the peaceful pool whose\nfreshness cooled their fever.\n\nThese footbaths suggested a dangerous idea to Miette. Nothing would\nsatisfy her but a complete bath. A little above the bridge over the\nViorne there was a very convenient spot, she said, barely three or four\nfeet deep and quite safe; the weather was so warm, it would be so nice\nto have the water up to their necks; besides which, she had been dying\nto learn to swim for such a long time, and Silvere would be able to\nteach her. Silvere raised objections; it was not prudent at night time;\nthey might be seen; perhaps, too they might catch cold. However, nothing\ncould turn Miette from her purpose. One evening she came with a bathing\ncostume which she had made out of an old dress; and Silvere was then\nobliged to go back to aunt Dide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for his bathing drawers. Their\nproceedings were characterised by great simplicity. Miette disrobed\nherself beneath the shade of a stout willow; and when both were ready,\nenveloped in the blackness which fell from the foliage around them, they\ngaily entered the cool water, oblivious of all previous scruples, and\nknowing in their innocence no sense of shame. They remained in the river\nquite an hour, splashing and throwing water into each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces;\nMiette now getting cross, now breaking out into laughter, while Silvere\ngave her her first lesson, dipping her head under every now and again so\nas to accustom her to the water. As long as he held her up she threw her\narms and legs about violently, thinking she was swimming; but directly\nhe let her go, she cried and struggled, striking the water with her\noutstretched hands, clutching at anything she could get hold of, the\nyoung man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist or one of his wrists. She leant against him for an\ninstant, resting, out of breath and dripping with water; and then she\ncried: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce more; but you do it on purpose, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt the end of a fortnight, the girl was able to swim. With her limbs\nmoving freely, rocked by the stream, playing with it, she yielded form\nand spirit alike to its soft motion, to the silence of the heavens,\nand the dreaminess of the melancholy banks. As she and Silvere swam\nnoiselessly along, she seemed to see the foliage of both banks thicken\nand hang over them, draping them round as with a huge curtain. When\nthe moon shone, its rays glided between the trunks of the trees, and\nphantoms seemed to flit along the river-side in white robes. Miette felt\nno nervousness, however, only an indefinable emotion as she followed\nthe play of the shadows. As she went onward with slower motion, the calm\nwater, which the moon converted into a bright mirror, rippled at\nher approach like a silver-broidered cloth; eddies widened and lost\nthemselves amid the shadows of the banks, under the hanging willow\nbranches, whence issued weird, plashing sounds. At every stroke she\nperceived recesses full of sound; dark cavities which she hastened\nto pass by; clusters and rows of trees, whose sombre masses were\ncontinually changing form, stretching forward and apparently following\nher from the summit of the bank. And when she threw herself on her back,\nthe depths of the heavens affected her still more. From the fields, from\nthe distant horizon, which she could no longer see, a solemn lingering\nstrain, composed of all the sighs of the night, was wafted to her.\n\nShe was not of a dreamy nature; it was physically, through the medium of\neach of her senses, that she derived enjoyment from the sky, the river,\nand the play of light and shadow. The river, in particular, bore her\nalong with endless caresses. When she swam against the current she was\ndelighted to feel the stream flow rapidly against her bosom and limbs.\nShe dipped herself in it yet more deeply, with the water reaching to her\nlips, so that it might pass over her shoulders, and envelop her, from\nchin to feet, with flying kisses. Then she would float, languid and\nquiescent, on the surface, whilst the ripples glided softly between her\ncostume and her skin. And she would also roll over in the still pools\nlike a cat on a carpet; and swim from the luminous patches where\nthe moonbeams were bathing, to the dark water shaded by the foliage,\nshivering the while, as though she had quitted a sunny plain and then\nfelt the cold from the boughs falling on her neck.\n\nShe now remained quite silent in the water, and would not allow Silvere\nto touch her. Gliding softly by his side, she swam on with the light\nrustling of a bird flying across the copse, or else she would circle\nround him, a prey to vague disquietude which she did not comprehend.\nHe himself darted quickly away if he happened to brush against her.\nThe river was now but a source of enervating intoxication, voluptuous\nlanguor, which disturbed them strangely. When they emerged from their\nbath they felt dizzy, weary, and drowsy. Fortunately, the girl declared\none evening that she would bathe no more, as the cold water made the\nblood run to her head. And it was in all truth and innocence that she\nsaid this.\n\nThen their long conversations began anew. The dangers to which the\ninnocence of their love had lately been exposed had left no other trace\nin Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind than great admiration for Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physical strength.\nShe had learned to swim in a fortnight, and often, when they raced\ntogether, he had seen her stem the current with a stroke as rapid as his\nown. He, who delighted in strength and bodily exercises, felt a\nthrill of pleasure at seeing her so strong, so active and adroit. He\nentertained at heart a singular admiration for her stout arms. One\nevening, after one of the first baths that had left them so playful,\nthey caught each other round the waist on a strip of sand, and wrestled\nfor several minutes without Silvere being able to throw Miette. At\nlast, indeed, it was the young man who lost his balance, while the girl\nremained standing. Her sweetheart treated her like a boy, and it was\nthose long rambles of theirs, those wild races across the meadows, those\nbirds\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nests filched from the tree crests, those struggles and violent\ngames of one and another kind that so long shielded them and their love\nfrom all impurity.\n\nThen, too, apart from his youthful admiration for his sweetheart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndashing pluck, Silvere felt for her all the compassionate tenderness of\na heart that ever softened towards the unfortunate. He, who could never\nsee any forsaken creature, a poor man, or a child, walking barefooted\nalong the dusty roads, without a throb of pity, loved Miette because\nnobody else loved her, because she virtually led an outcast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard life.\nWhen he saw her smile he was deeply moved by the joy he brought her.\nMoreover, the child was a wildling, like himself, and they were of the\nsame mind in hating all the gossips of the Faubourg. The dreams in which\nSilvere indulged in the daytime, while he plied his heavy hammer round\nthe cartwheels in his master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop, were full of generous enthusiasm.\nHe fancied himself Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s redeemer. All his reading rushed to his\nhead; he meant to marry his sweetheart some day, in order to raise her\nin the eyes of the world. It was like a holy mission that he imposed\nupon himself, that of redeeming and saving the convict\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter. And\nhis head was so full of certain theories and arguments, that he did not\ntell himself these things in simple fashion, but became lost in perfect\nsocial mysticism; imagining rehabilitation in the form of an apotheosis\nin which he pictured Miette seated on a throne, at the end of the Cours\nSauvaire, while the whole town prostrated itself before her, entreating\nher pardon and singing her praises. Happily he forgot all these fine\nthings as soon as Miette jumped over the wall, and said to him on the\nhigh road: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us have a race! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t catch me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever, if the young man dreamt like this of the glorification of his\nsweetheart, he also showed such passion for justice that he often made\nher weep on speaking to her about her father. In spite of the softening\neffect which Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friendship had had upon her, she still at times\ngave way to angry outbreaks of temper, when all the stubbornness and\nrebellion latent in her nature stiffened her with scowling eyes and\ntightly-drawn lips. She would then contend that her father had done\nquite right to kill the gendarme, that the earth belongs to everybody,\nand that one has the right to fire a gun when and where one likes.\nThereupon Silvere, in a grave voice, explained the law to her as he\nunderstood it, with strange commentaries which would have startled the\nwhole magistracy of Plassans. These discussions took place most often in\nsome remote corner of the Sainte-Claire meadows. The grassy carpet of a\ndusky green hue stretched further than they could see, undotted even by\na single tree, and the sky seemed colossal, spangling the bare horizon\nwith the stars. It seemed to the young couple as if they were being\nrocked on a sea of verdure. Miette argued the point obstinately; she\nasked Silvere if her father should have let the gendarme kill him, and\nSilvere, after a momentary silence, replied that, in such a case, it\nwas better to be the victim than the murderer, and that it was a great\nmisfortune for anyone to kill a fellow man, even in legitimate defence.\nThe law was something holy to him, and the judges had done right in\nsending Chantegreil to the galleys. At this the girl grew angry, and\nalmost struck her sweetheart, crying out that he was as heartless as the\nrest. And as he still firmly defended his ideas of justice, she finished\nby bursting into sobs, and stammering that he was doubtless ashamed\nof her, since he was always reminding her of her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crime. These\ndiscussions ended in tears, in mutual emotion. But although the child\ncried, and acknowledged that she was perhaps wrong, she still retained\ndeep within her a wild resentful temper. She once related, with hearty\nlaughter, that she had seen a gendarme fall off his horse and break his\nleg. Apart from this, Miette only lived for Silvere. When he asked her\nabout her uncle and cousin, she replied that \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe did not know;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nif he pressed her, fearing that they were making her too unhappy at the\nJas-Meiffren, she simply answered that she worked hard, and that nothing\nhad changed. She believed, however, that Justin had at last found out\nwhat made her sing in the morning, and filled her eyes with delight. But\nshe added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does it matter? If ever he comes to disturb us we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nreceive him in such a way that he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be in a hurry to meddle with our\naffairs any more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow and again the open country, their long rambles in the fresh air,\nwearied them somewhat. They then invariably returned to the Aire\nSaint-Mittre, to the narrow lane, whence they had been driven by the\nnoisy summer evenings, the pungent scent of the trodden grass, all the\nwarm oppressive emanations. On certain nights, however, the path proved\ncooler, and the winds freshened it so that they could remain there\nwithout feeling faint. They then enjoyed a feeling of delightful repose.\nSeated on the tombstone, deaf to the noise of the children and gipsies,\nthey felt at home again. Silvere had on various occasions picked\nup fragments of bones, even pieces of skulls, and they were fond of\nspeaking of the ancient burial-ground. It seemed to them, in their\nlively fancies, that their love had shot up like some vigorous plant in\nthis nook of soil which dead men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bones had fertilised. It had grown,\nindeed, like those wild weeds, it had blossomed as blossom the poppies\nwhich sway like bare bleeding hearts at the slightest breeze. And\nthey ended by fancying that the warm breaths passing over them, the\nwhisperings heard in the gloom, the long quivering which thrilled the\npath, came from the dead folk sighing their departed passions in\ntheir faces, telling them the stories of their bridals, as they turned\nrestlessly in their graves, full of a fierce longing to live and love\nagain. Those fragments of bone, they felt convinced of it, were full of\naffection for them; the shattered skulls grew warm again by contact with\ntheir own youthful fire, the smallest particles surrounded them with\npassionate whispering, anxious solicitude, throbbing jealousy. And when\nthey departed, the old burial-ground seemed to groan. Those weeds,\nin which their entangled feet often stumbled on sultry nights, were\nfingers, tapered by tomb life, that sprang up from the earth to detain\nthem and cast them into each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms. That pungent and penetrating\nodour exhaled by the broken stems was the fertilising perfume, the\nmighty quintessence of life which is slowly elaborated in the grave,\nand intoxicates the lovers who wander in the solitude of the paths.\nThe dead, the old departed dead, longed for the bridal of Miette and\nSilvere.\n\nThey were never afraid. The sympathy which seemed to hover around them\nthrilled them and made them love the invisible beings whose soft touch\nthey often imagined they could feel, like a gentle flapping of wings.\nSometimes they were saddened by sweet melancholy, and could not\nunderstand what the dead desired of them. They went on basking in their\ninnocent love, amidst this flood of sap, this abandoned cemetery, whose\nrich soil teemed with life, and imperiously demanded their union. They\nstill remained ignorant of the meaning of the buzzing voices which they\nheard ringing in their ears, the sudden glow which sent the blood flying\nto their faces.\n\nThey often questioned each other about the remains which they\ndiscovered. Miette, after a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fashion, was partial to lugubrious\nsubjects. At each new discovery she launched into endless suppositions.\nIf the bone were small, she spoke of some beautiful girl a prey to\nconsumption, or carried off by fever on the eve of her marriage; if the\nbone were large, she pictured some big old man, a soldier or a judge,\nsome one who had inspired others with terror. For a long time the\ntombstone particularly engaged their attention. One fine moonlight night\nMiette distinguished some half-obliterated letters on one side of it,\nand thereupon she made Silvere scrape the moss away with his knife. Then\nthey read the mutilated inscription: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere lieth . . . Marie . . .\ndied . . .\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Miette, finding her own name on the stone, was quite\nterror-stricken. Silvere called her a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbig baby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but she could not\nrestrain her tears. She had received a stab in the heart, she said; she\nwould soon die, and that stone was meant for her. The young man himself\nfelt alarmed. However, he succeeded in shaming the child out of these\nthoughts. What! she so courageous, to dream about such trifles! They\nended by laughing. Then they avoided speaking of it again. But in\nmelancholy moments, when the cloudy sky saddened the pathway, Miette\ncould not help thinking of that dead one, that unknown Marie, whose\ntomb had so long facilitated their meetings. The poor girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bones were\nperhaps still lying there. And at this thought Miette one evening had a\nstrange whim, and asked Silvere to turn the stone over to see what might\nbe under it. He refused, as though it were sacrilege, and his refusal\nstrengthened Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fancies with regard to the dear phantom which bore\nher name. She positively insisted that the girl had died young, as\nshe was, and in the very midst of her love. She even began to pity the\nstone, that stone which she climbed so nimbly, and on which they had\nsat so often, a stone which death had chilled, and which their love had\nwarmed again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see, this tombstone will bring us misfortune,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf\nyou were to die, I should come and lie here, and then I should like to\nhave this stone set over my body.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this, Silvere, choking with emotion, scolded her for thinking of such\nmournful things.\n\nAnd so, for nearly two years, their love grew alike in the narrow\npathway and the open country. Their idyll passed through the chilling\nrains of December and the burning solicitations of July, free from all\ntouch of impurity, ever retaining the sweet charm of some old Greek\nlove-tale, all the naive hesitancy of youth which desires but knows not.\nIn vain did the long-departed dead whisper in their ears. They carried\nnothing away from the old cemetery but emotional melancholy and a vague\npresentiment of a short life. A voice seemed to whisper to them that\nthey would depart amidst their virginal love, long ere the bridal day\nwould give them wholly to each other. It was there, on the tombstone and\namong the bones that lay hidden beneath the rank grass, that they had\nfirst come to indulge in that longing for death, that eager desire to\nsleep together in the earth, that now set them stammering and sighing\nbeside the Orcheres road, on that December night, while the two bells\nrepeated their mournful warnings to one another.\n\nMiette was sleeping calmly, with her head resting on Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest\nwhile he mused upon their past meeting, their lovely years of unbroken\nhappiness. At daybreak the girl awoke. The valley now spread out clearly\nunder the bright sky. The sun was still behind the hills, but a stream\nof crystal light, limpid and cold as spring-water, flowed from the\npale horizon. In the distance, the Viorne, like a white satin ribbon,\ndisappeared among an expanse of red and yellow land. It was a boundless\nvista, with grey seas of olive-trees, and vineyards that looked like\nhuge pieces of striped cloth. The whole country was magnified by the\nclearness of the atmosphere and the peaceful cold. However, sharp gusts\nof wind chilled the young people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces. And thereupon they sprang to\ntheir feet, cheered by the sight of the clear morning. Their melancholy\nforebodings had vanished with the darkness, and they gazed with delight\nat the immense expanse of the plain, and listened to the tolling of the\ntwo bells that now seemed to be joyfully ringing in a holiday.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a good sleep!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miette cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI dreamt you were kissing\nme. Tell me now, did you kiss me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere replied laughing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was not very warm. It\nis bitterly cold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI only feel cold in the feet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miette rejoined.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell! let us have a run,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Silvere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have still two good leagues\nto go. You will get warm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThereupon they descended the hill and ran until they reached the high\nroad. When they were below they raised their heads as if to say farewell\nto that rock on which they had wept while their kisses burned their\nlips. But they did not again speak of that ardent embrace which had\nthrilled them so strongly with vague, unknown desire. Under the pretext\nof walking more quickly they did not even take each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm. They\nexperienced some slight confusion when they looked at one another,\nthough why they could not tell. Meantime the dawn was rising around\nthem. The young man, who had sometimes been sent to Orcheres by his\nmaster, knew all the shortest cuts. Thus they walked on for more than\ntwo leagues, along dingle paths by the side of interminable ledges and\nwalls. Now and again Miette accused Silvere of having taken her the\nwrong way; for, at times--for a quarter of an hour at a stretch--they\nlost all sight of the surrounding country, seeing above the walls and\nhedges nothing but long rows of almond-trees whose slender branches\nshowed sharply against the pale sky.\n\nAll at once, however, they came out just in front of Orcheres. Loud\ncries of joy, the shouting of a crowd, sounded clearly in the limpid\nair. The insurrectionary forces were only now entering the town. Miette\nand Silvere went in with the stragglers. Never had they seen such\nenthusiasm. To judge from the streets, one would have thought it was a\nprocession day, when the windows are decked with the finest drapery to\nhonour the passage of the Canopy. The townsfolk welcomed the insurgents\nas though they were deliverers. The men embraced them, while the women\nbrought them food. Old men were to be seen weeping at the doors. And the\njoyousness was of an essentially Southern character, pouring forth in\nclamorous fashion, in singing, dancing, and gesticulation. As Miette\npassed along she was carried away by a _farandole_[*] which spread\nwhirling all round the Grand\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Place. Silvere followed her. His thoughts\nof death and his discouragement were now far away. He wanted to fight,\nto sell his life dearly at least. The idea of a struggle intoxicated\nhim afresh. He dreamed of victory to be followed by a happy life with\nMiette, amidst the peacefulness of the universal Republic.\n\n     [*] The _farandole_ is the popular dance of Provence.\n\nThe fraternal reception accorded them by the inhabitants of Orcheres\nproved to be the insurgents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 last delight. They spent the day amidst\nradiant confidence and boundless hope. The prisoners, Commander\nSicardot, Messieurs Garconnet, Peirotte and the others, who had been\nshut up in one of the rooms at the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, the windows of which\noverlooked the Grand\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Place, watched the _farandoles_ and wild outbursts\nof enthusiasm with surprise and dismay.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe villains!\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered the Commander, leaning upon a window-bar, as\nthough bending over the velvet-covered hand-rest of a box at a theatre:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo think that there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a battery or two to make a clean sweep of all\nthat rabble!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he perceived Miette, and addressing himself to Monsieur Garconnet,\nhe added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you see, sir, that big girl in red over yonder? How\ndisgraceful! They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve even brought their mistresses with them. If this\ncontinues much longer we shall see some fine goings-on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMonsieur Garconnet shook his head, saying something about \u00e2\u0080\u009cunbridled\npassions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe most evil days of history.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Monsieur Peirotte, as\nwhite as a sheet, remained silent; he only opened his lips once, to say\nto Sicardot, who was still bitterly railing: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot so loud, sir; not so\nloud! You will get us all massacred.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs a matter of fact, the insurgents treated the gentlemen with the\ngreatest kindness. They even provided them with an excellent dinner in\nthe evening. Such attentions, however, were terrifying to such a quaker\nas the receiver of taxes; the insurgents he thought would not treat them\nso well unless they wished to make them fat and tender for the day when\nthey might wish to devour them.\n\nAt dusk that day Silvere came face to face with his cousin, Doctor\nPascal. The latter had followed the band on foot, chatting with the\nworkmen who held him in the greatest respect. At first he had striven\nto dissuade them from the struggle; and then, as if convinced by their\narguments, he had said to them with his kindly smile: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, perhaps you\nare right, my friends; fight if you like, I shall be here to patch up\nyour arms and legs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, in the morning he began to gather pebbles and plants along the\nhigh road. He regretted that he had not brought his geologist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hammer\nand botanical wallet with him. His pockets were now so full of stones\nthat they were almost bursting, while bundles of long herbs peered forth\nfrom the surgeon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case which he carried under his arm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHallo! You here, my lad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, as he perceived Silvere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought\nI was the only member of the family here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke these last words with a touch of irony, as if deriding the\nintrigues of his father and his uncle Antoine. Silvere was very glad\nto meet his cousin; the doctor was the only one of the Rougons who\never shook hands with him in the street, and showed him any sincere\nfriendship. Seeing him, therefore, still covered with dust from the\nmarch, the young man thought him gained over to the Republican cause,\nand was much delighted thereat. He talked to the doctor, with youthful\nmagniloquence, of the people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights, their holy cause, and their\ncertain triumph. Pascal smiled as he listened, and watched the youth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngestures and the ardent play of his features with curiosity, as though\nhe were studying a patient, or analysing an enthusiasm, to ascertain\nwhat might be at the bottom of it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow you run on! How you run on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he finally exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! you are\nyour grandmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true grandson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And, in a whisper, he added, like\nsome chemist taking notes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHysteria or enthusiasm, shameful madness\nor sublime madness. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always those terrible nerves!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, again\nspeaking aloud, as if summing up the matter, he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe family is\ncomplete now. It will count a hero among its members.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere did not hear him. He was still talking of his dear Republic.\nMiette had dropped a few paces off; she was still wrapped in her large\nred pelisse. She and Silvere had traversed the town arm-in-arm.\nThe sight of this tall red girl at last puzzled Pascal, and again\ninterrupting his cousin, he asked him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is this child with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is my wife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere gravely answered.\n\nThe doctor opened his eyes wide, for he did not understand. He was very\nshy with women; however, he raised his hat to Miette as he went away.\n\nThe night proved an anxious one. Forebodings of misfortune swept over\nthe insurgents. The enthusiasm and confidence of the previous evening\nseemed to die away in the darkness. In the morning there were gloomy\nfaces; sad looks were exchanged, followed by discouraging silence.\nTerrifying rumours were now circulating. Bad news, which the leaders\nhad managed to conceal the previous evening, had spread abroad, though\nnobody in particular was known to have spoken. It was the work of\nthat invisible voice, which, with a word, throws a mob into a panic.\nAccording to some reports Paris was subdued, and the provinces had\noffered their hands and feet, eager to be bound. And it was added that\na large party of troops, which had left Marseilles under the command of\nColonel Masson and Monsieur de Bleriot, the prefect of the department,\nwas advancing by forced marches to disperse the insurrectionary bands.\nThis news came like a thunderbolt, at once awakening rage and despair.\nThese men, who on the previous evening had been all aglow with patriotic\nfever, now shivered with cold, chilled to their hearts by the shameful\nsubmissiveness of prostrate France. They alone, then, had had the\ncourage to do their duty! And now they were to be left to perish amidst\nthe general panic, the death-like silence of the country; they had\nbecome mere rebels, who would be hunted down like wild beasts; they,\nwho had dreamed of a great war, of a whole nation in revolt, and of\nthe glorious conquest of the people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights! Miserably baffled and\nbetrayed, this handful of men could but weep for their dead faith and\ntheir vanished dreams of justice. There were some who, while taunting\nFrance with her cowardice, flung away their arms, and sat down by the\nroadside, declaring that they would there await the bullets of the\ntroops, and show how Republicans could die.\n\nAlthough these men had nothing now but death or exile before them,\nthere were very few desertions from their ranks. A splendid feeling of\nsolidarity kept them together. Their indignation turned chiefly against\ntheir leaders, who had really proved incapable. Irreparable mistakes\nhad been committed; and now the insurgents, without order or discipline,\nbarely protected by a few sentries, and under the command of irresolute\nmen, found themselves at the mercy of the first soldiers that might\narrive.\n\nThey spent two more days at Orcheres, Tuesday and Wednesday, thus losing\ntime and aggravating the situation. The general, the man with the sabre,\nwhom Silvere had pointed out to Miette on the Plassans road, vacillated\nand hesitated under the terrible responsibility that weighed upon him.\nOn Thursday he came to the conclusion that the position of Orcheres\nwas a decidedly dangerous one; so towards one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock he gave orders to\nmarch, and led his little army to the heights of Sainte-Roure. That was,\nindeed, an impregnable position for any one who knew how to defend it.\nThe houses of Sainte-Roure rise in tiers along a hill-side; behind the\ntown all approach is shut off by enormous rocks, so that this kind of\ncitadel can only be reached by the Nores plain, which spreads out at the\nfoot of the plateau. An esplanade, converted into a public walk planted\nwith magnificent elms, overlooks the plain. It was on this esplanade\nthat the insurgents encamped. The hostages were imprisoned in the Hotel\nde la Mule-Blanche, standing half-way along the promenade. The night\npassed away heavy and black. The insurgents spoke of treachery. As soon\nas it was morning, however, the man with the sabre, who had neglected to\ntake the simplest precautions, reviewed the troops. The contingents were\ndrawn up in line with their backs turned to the plain. They presented\na wonderful medley of costume, some wearing brown jackets, others\ndark greatcoats, and others again blue blouses girded with red sashes.\nMoreover, their arms were an equally odd collection: there were newly\nsharpened scythes, large navvies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 spades, and fowling-pieces with\nburnished barrels glittering in the sunshine. And at the very moment\nwhen the improvised general was riding past the little army, a sentry,\nwho had been forgotten in an olive-plantation, ran up gesticulating and\nshouting:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe soldiers! The soldiers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was indescribable emotion. At first, they thought it a false\nalarm. Forgetting all discipline, they rushed forward to the end of the\nesplanade in order to see the soldiers. The ranks were broken, and as\nthe dark line of troops appeared, marching in perfect order with a long\nglitter of bayonets, on the other side of the greyish curtain of olive\ntrees, there came a hasty and disorderly retreat, which sent a quiver of\npanic to the other end of the plateau. Nevertheless, the contingents\nof La Palud and Saint-Martin-de-Vaulx had again formed in line in\nthe middle of the promenade, and stood there erect and fierce. A\nwood-cutter, who was a head taller than any of his companions, shouted,\nas he waved his red neckerchief: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo arms, Chavanoz, Graille, Poujols,\nSaint-Eutrope! To arms, Les Tulettes! To arms, Plassans!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCrowds streamed across the esplanade. The man with the sabre, surrounded\nby the folks from Faverolles, marched off with several of the country\ncontingents--Vernoux, Corbiere, Marsanne, and Pruinas--to outflank the\nenemy and then attack him. Other contingents, from Valqueyras, Nazere,\nCastel-le-Vieux, Les Roches-Noires, and Murdaran, dashed to the left,\nscattering themselves in skirmishing parties over the Nores plain.\n\nAnd meantime the men of the towns and villages that the wood-cutter had\ncalled to his aid mustered together under the elms, there forming a dark\nirregular mass, grouped without regard to any of the rules of strategy,\nsimply placed there like a rock, as it were, to bar the way or die. The\nmen of Plassans stood in the middle of this heroic battalion. Amid the\ngrey hues of the blouses and jackets, and the bluish glitter of the\nweapons, the pelisse worn by Miette, who was holding the banner with\nboth hands, looked like a large red splotch--a fresh and bleeding wound.\n\nAll at once perfect silence fell. Monsieur Peirotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pale face appeared\nat a window of the Hotel de la Mule-Blanche. And he began to speak,\ngesticulating with his hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo in, close the shutters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the insurgents furiously shouted; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nget yourself killed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThereupon the shutters were quickly closed, and nothing was heard save\nthe regular, rhythmical tramp of the soldiers who were drawing near.\n\nA minute, that seemed an age, went by. The troops had disappeared,\nhidden by an undulation of the ground; but over yonder, on the side of\nthe Nores plain, the insurgents soon perceived the bayonets shooting\nup, one after another, like a field of steel-eared corn under the rising\nsun. At that moment Silvere, who was glowing with feverish agitation,\nfancied he could see the gendarme whose blood had stained his hands. He\nknew, from the accounts of his companions, that Rengade was not dead,\nthat he had only lost an eye; and he clearly distinguished the unlucky\nman with his empty socket bleeding horribly. The keen recollection of\nthis gendarme, to whom he had not given a thought since his departure\nfrom Plassans, proved unbearable. He was afraid that fear might get the\nbetter of him, and he tightened his hold on his carbine, while a mist\ngathered before his eyes. He felt a longing to discharge his gun\nand fire at the phantom of that one-eyed man so as to drive it away.\nMeantime the bayonets were still and ever slowly ascending.\n\nWhen the heads of the soldiers appeared on a level with the esplanade,\nSilvere instinctively turned to Miette. She stood there with flushed\nface, looking taller than ever amidst the folds of the red banner; she\nwas indeed standing on tiptoes in order to see the troops, and nervous\nexpectation made her nostrils quiver and her red lips part so as to\nshow her white, eager, gleaming teeth. Silvere smiled at her. But he had\nscarcely turned his head when a fusillade burst out. The soldiers, who\ncould only be seen from their shoulders upwards, had just fired their\nfirst volley. It seemed to Silvere as though a great gust of wind was\npassing over his head, while a shower of leaves, lopped off by the\nbullets, fell from the elms. A sharp sound, like the snapping of a dead\nbranch, made him look to his right. Then, prone on the ground, he saw\nthe big wood-cutter, he who was a head taller than the others. There was\na little black hole in the middle of his forehead. And thereupon Silvere\nfired straight before him, without taking aim, reloaded and fired again\nlike a madman or an unthinking wild beast, in haste only to kill. He\ncould not even distinguish the soldiers now; smoke, resembling strips of\ngrey muslin, was floating under the elms. The leaves still rained upon\nthe insurgents, for the troops were firing too high. Every now and then,\nathwart the fierce crackling of the fusillade, the young man heard a\nsigh or a low rattle, and a rush was made among the band as if to make\nroom for some poor wretch clutching hold of his neighbours as he fell.\nThe firing lasted ten minutes.\n\nThen, between two volleys some one exclaimed in a voice of terror:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery man for himself! _Sauve qui peut!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d This roused shouts and\nmurmurs of rage, as if to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe cowards! Oh! the cowards!\u00e2\u0080\u009d sinister\nrumours were spreading--the general had fled; cavalry were sabring the\nskirmishers in the Nores plain. However, the irregular firing did not\ncease, every now and again sudden bursts of flame sped through the\nclouds of smoke. A gruff voice, the voice of terror, shouted yet louder:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery man for himself! _Sauve qui peut!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some men took to flight,\nthrowing down their weapons and leaping over the dead. The others closed\ntheir ranks. At last there were only some ten insurgents left. Two more\ntook to flight, and of the remaining eight three were killed at one\ndischarge.\n\nThe two children had remained there mechanically without understanding\nanything. As the battalion diminished in numbers, Miette raised the\nbanner still higher in the air; she held it in front of her with\nclenched fists as if it were a huge taper. It was completely riddled\nby bullets. When Silvere had no more cartridges left in his pocket, he\nceased firing, and gazed at the carbine with an air of stupor. It was\nthen that a shadow passed over his face, as though the flapping wings\nof some colossal bird had brushed against his forehead. And raising his\neyes he saw the banner fall from Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grasp. The child, her hands\nclasped to her breast, her head thrown back with an expression of\nexcruciating suffering, was staggering to the ground. She did not utter\na single cry, but sank at last upon the red banner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet up; come quickly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Silvere said, in despair, as he held out his\nhand to her.\n\nBut she lay upon the ground without uttering a word, her eyes wide open.\nThen he understood, and fell on his knees beside her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are wounded, eh? tell me? Where are you wounded?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe still spoke no word; she was stifling, and gazing at him out of her\nlarge eyes, while short quivers shook her frame. Then he pulled away her\nhands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he tore open her bodice, and laid her bosom bare. He searched, but\nsaw nothing. His eyes were brimming with tears. At last under the left\nbreast he perceived a small pink hole; a single drop of blood stained\nthe wound.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go and find Pascal, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put you\nall right again. If you could only get up. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you move?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe soldiers were not firing now; they had dashed to the left in pursuit\nof the contingents led away by the man with the sabre. And in the centre\nof the esplanade there only remained Silvere kneeling beside Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbody. With the stubbornness of despair, he had taken her in his arms. He\nwanted to set her on her feet, but such a quiver of pain came upon the\ngirl that he laid her down again, and said to her entreatingly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak\nto me, pray. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you say something to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe could not; she slowly, gently shook her hand, as if to say that\nit was not her fault. Her close-pressed lips were already contracting\nbeneath the touch of death. With her unbound hair streaming around her,\nand her head resting amid the folds of the blood-red banner, all her\nlife now centred in her eyes, those black eyes glittering in her white\nface. Silvere sobbed. The glance of those big sorrowful eyes filled him\nwith distress. He read in them bitter, immense regret for life. Miette\nwas telling him that she was going away all alone, and before their\nbridal day; that she was leaving him ere she had become his wife. She\nwas telling him, too, that it was he who had willed that it should\nbe so, that he should have loved her as other lovers love their\nsweethearts. In the hour of her agony, amidst that stern conflict\nbetween death and her vigorous nature, she bewailed her fate in going\nlike that to the grave. Silvere, as he bent over her, understood how\nbitter was the pang. He recalled their caresses, how she had hung round\nhis neck, and had yearned for his love, but he had not understood, and\nnow she was departing from him for evermore. Bitterly grieved at the\nthought that throughout her eternal rest she would remember him solely\nas a companion and playfellow, he kissed her on the bosom while his hot\ntears fell upon her lips. Those passionate kisses brought a last gleam\nof joy to Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes. They loved one another, and their idyll ended\nin death.\n\nBut Silvere could not believe she was dying. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, you will see, it will\nprove only a trifle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he declared. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak if it hurts you. Wait, I\nwill raise your head and then warm you; your hands are quite frozen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the fusillade had begun afresh, this time on the left, in the olive\nplantations. A dull sound of galloping cavalry rose from the plain.\nAt times there were loud cries, as of men being slaughtered. And\nthick clouds of smoke were wafted along and hung about the elms on the\nesplanade. Silvere for his part no longer heard or saw anything. Pascal,\nwho came running down in the direction of the plain, saw him stretched\nupon the ground, and hastened towards him, thinking he was wounded. As\nsoon as the young man saw him, he clutched hold of him and pointed to\nMiette.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wounded, there, under the breast. Ah! how good\nof you to come! You will save her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt that moment, however, a slight convulsion shook the dying girl. A\npain-fraught shadow passed over her face, and as her contracted lips\nsuddenly parted, a faint sigh escaped from them. Her eyes, still wide\nopen, gazed fixedly at the young man.\n\nThen Pascal, who had stooped down, rose again, saying in a low voice:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDead! Silvere reeled at the sound of the word. He had been kneeling\nforward, but now he sank back, as though thrown down by Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last\nfaint sigh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDead! Dead!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is not true, she is looking at me. See\nhow she is looking at me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he caught the doctor by the coat, entreating him to remain there,\nassuring him that he was mistaken, that she was not dead, and that he\ncould save her if he only would. Pascal resisted gently, saying, in his\nkindly voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can do nothing for her, others are waiting for me. Let\ngo, my poor child; she is quite dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt last Silvere released his hold and again fell back. Dead! Dead! Still\nthat word, which rang like a knell in his dazed brain! When he was alone\nhe crept up close to the corpse. Miette still seemed to be looking\nat him. He threw himself upon her, laid his head upon her bosom, and\nwatered it with his tears. He was beside himself with grief. He pressed\nhis lips wildly to her, and breathed out all his passion, all his soul,\nin one long kiss, as though in the hope that it might bring her to life\nagain. But the girl was turning cold in spite of his caresses. He felt\nher lifeless and nerveless beneath his touch. Then he was seized with\nterror, and with haggard face and listless hanging arms he remained\ncrouching in a state of stupor, and repeating: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is dead, yet she is\nlooking at me; she does not close her eyes, she sees me still.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis fancy was very sweet to him. He remained there perfectly still,\nexchanging a long look with Miette, in whose glance, deepened by death,\nhe still seemed to read the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lament for her sad fate.\n\nIn the meantime, the cavalry were still sabring the fugitives over the\nNores plain; the cries of the wounded and the galloping of the horses\nbecame more distant, softening like music wafted from afar through the\nclear air. Silvere was no longer conscious of the fighting. He did\nnot even see his cousin, who mounted the slope again and crossed the\npromenade. Pascal, as he passed along, picked up Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s carbine\nwhich Silvere had thrown down; he knew it, as he had seen it hanging\nover aunt Dide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chimney-piece, and he thought he might as well save it\nfrom the hands of the victors. He had scarcely entered the Hotel de la\nMule-Blanche, whither a large number of the wounded had been taken, when\na band of insurgents, chased by the soldiers like a herd of cattle, once\nmore rushed into the esplanade. The man with the sabre had fled; it was\nthe last contingents from the country who were being exterminated. There\nwas a terrible massacre. In vain did Colonel Masson and the prefect,\nMonsieur de Bleriot, overcome by pity, order a retreat. The infuriated\nsoldiers continued firing upon the mass, and pinning isolated fugitives\nto the walls with their bayonets. When they had no more enemies before\nthem, they riddled the facade of the Mule-Blanche with bullets. The\nshutters flew into splinters; one window which had been left half-open\nwas torn out, and there was a loud rattle of broken glass. Pitiful\nvoices were crying out from within; \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe prisoners! The prisoners!\u00e2\u0080\u009d But\nthe troops did not hear; they continued firing. All at once Commander\nSicardot, growing exasperated, appeared at the door, waved his arms, and\nendeavoured to speak. Monsieur Peirotte, the receiver of taxes, with his\nslim figure and scared face, stood by his side. However, another volley\nwas fired, and Monsieur Peirotte fell face foremost, with a heavy thud,\nto the ground.\n\nSilvere and Miette were still looking at each other. Silvere had\nremained by the corpse, through all the fusillade and the howls of\nagony, without even turning his head. He was only conscious of the\npresence of some men around him, and, from a feeling of modesty, he drew\nthe red banner over Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast. Then their eyes still continued to\ngaze at one another.\n\nThe conflict, however, was at an end. The death of the receiver of\ntaxes had satiated the soldiers. Some of these ran about, scouring every\ncorner of the esplanade, to prevent the escape of a single insurgent.\nA gendarme who perceived Silvere under the trees, ran up to him, and\nseeing that it was a lad he had to deal with, called: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you\ndoing there, youngster?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere, whose eyes were still fixed on those of Miette, made no reply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! the bandit, his hands are black with powder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the gendarme\nexclaimed, as he stooped down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, get up, you scoundrel! You know\nwhat you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to expect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, as Silvere only smiled vaguely and did not move, the other looked\nmore attentively, and saw that the corpse swathed in the banner was that\nof a girl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA fine girl; what a pity!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour mistress, eh? you\nrascal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he made a violent grab at Silvere, and setting him on his feet led\nhim away like a dog that is dragged by one leg. Silvere submitted in\nsilence, as quietly as a child. He just turned round to give another\nglance at Miette. He felt distressed at thus leaving her alone under the\ntrees. For the last time he looked at her from afar. She was still lying\nthere in all her purity, wrapped in the red banner, her head slightly\nraised, and her big eyes turned upward towards heaven.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nIt was about five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the morning when Rougon at last ventured to\nleave his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. The old woman had gone to sleep on a chair. He\ncrept stealthily to the end of the Impasse Saint-Mittre. There was not a\nsound, not a shadow. He pushed on as far as the Porte de Rome. The gates\nstood wide open in the darkness that enveloped the slumbering town.\nPlassans was sleeping as sound as a top, quite unconscious, apparently,\nof the risk it was running in allowing the gates to remain unsecured.\nIt seemed like a city of the dead. Rougon, taking courage, made his way\ninto the Rue de Nice. He scanned from a distance the corners of each\nsuccessive lane; and trembled at every door, fearing lest he should see\na band of insurgents rush out upon him. However, he reached the Cours\nSauvaire without any mishap. The insurgents seemed to have vanished in\nthe darkness like a nightmare.\n\nPierre then paused for a moment on the deserted pavement, heaving a\ndeep sigh of relief and triumph. So those rascals had really abandoned\nPlassans to him. The town belonged to him now; it slept like the foolish\nthing it was; there it lay, dark and tranquil, silent and confident, and\nhe had only to stretch out his hand to take possession of it. That\nbrief halt, the supercilious glance which he cast over the drowsy place,\nthrilled him with unspeakable delight. He remained there, alone in the\ndarkness, and crossed his arms, in the attitude of a great general on\nthe eve of a victory. He could hear nothing in the distance but the\nmurmur of the fountains of the Cours Sauvaire, whose jets of water fell\ninto the basins with a musical plashing.\n\nThen he began to feel a little uneasy. What if the Empire should\nunhappily have been established without his aid? What if Sicardot,\nGarconnet, and Peirotte, instead of being arrested and led away by\nthe insurrectionary band, had shut the rebels up in prison? A cold\nperspiration broke out over him, and he went on his way again, hoping\nthat Felicite would give him some accurate information. He now pushed on\nmore rapidly, and was skirting the houses of the Rue de la Banne, when a\nstrange spectacle, which caught his eyes as he raised his head, riveted\nhim to the ground. One of the windows of the yellow drawing-room was\nbrilliantly illuminated, and, in the glare, he saw a dark form, which he\nrecognized as that of his wife, bending forward, and shaking its arms in\na violent manner. He asked himself what this could mean, but, unable to\nthink of any explanation, was beginning to feel seriously alarmed, when\nsome hard object bounded over the pavement at his feet. Felicite had\nthrown him the key of the cart-house, where he had concealed a supply\nof muskets. This key clearly signified that he must take up arms. So he\nturned away again, unable to comprehend why his wife had prevented him\nfrom going upstairs, and imagining the most horrible things.\n\nHe now went straight to Roudier, whom he found dressed and ready to\nmarch, but completely ignorant of the events of the night. Roudier lived\nat the far end of the new town, as in a desert, whither no tidings of\nthe insurgents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 movements had penetrated. Pierre, however, proposed\nto him that they should go to Granoux, whose house stood on one of\nthe corners of the Place des Recollets, and under whose windows the\ninsurgent contingents must have passed. The municipal councillor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nservant remained for a long time parleying before consenting to admit\nthem, and they heard poor Granoux calling from the first floor in a\ntrembling voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t open the door, Catherine! The streets are full of bandits.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was in his bedroom, in the dark. When he recognised his two faithful\nfriends he felt relieved; but he would not let the maid bring a lamp,\nfearing lest the light might attract a bullet. He seemed to think that\nthe town was still full of insurgents. Lying back on an arm-chair near\nthe window, in his pants, and with a silk handkerchief round his head,\nhe moaned: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! my friends, if you only knew!--I tried to go to bed, but\nthey were making such a disturbance! At last I lay down in my arm-chair\nhere. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it all, everything. Such awful-looking men; a band of\nescaped convicts! Then they passed by again, dragging brave Commander\nSicardot, worthy Monsieur Garconnet, the postmaster, and others away\nwith them, and howling the while like cannibals!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRougon felt a thrill of joy. He made Granoux repeat to him how he had\nseen the mayor and the others surrounded by the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrigands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw it all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the poor man wailed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was standing behind the blind.\nThey had just seized Monsieur Peirotte, and I heard him saying as he\npassed under my window: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gentlemen, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 They were certainly\nmaltreating him. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abominable, abominable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever, Roudier calmed Granoux by assuring him that the town was free.\nAnd the worthy gentleman began to feel quite a glow of martial ardour\nwhen Pierre informed him that he had come to recruit his services for\nthe purpose of saving Plassans. These three saviours then took council\ntogether. They each resolved to go and rouse their friends, and appoint\na meeting at the cart-shed, the secret arsenal of the reactionary\nparty. Meantime Rougon constantly bethought himself of Felicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wild\ngestures, which seemed to betoken danger somewhere. Granoux, assuredly\nthe most foolish of the three, was the first to suggest that there must\nbe some Republicans left in the town. This proved a flash of light,\nand Rougon, with a feeling of conviction, reflected: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere must be\nsomething of Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing under all this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAn hour or so later the friends met again in the cart-shed, which was\nsituated in a very lonely spot. They had glided stealthily from door to\ndoor, knocking and ringing as quietly as possible, and picking up all\nthe men they could. However, they had only succeeded in collecting some\nforty, who arrived one after the other, creeping along in the dark, with\nthe pale and drowsy countenances of men who had been violently startled\nfrom their sleep. The cart-shed, let to a cooper, was littered with old\nhoops and broken casks, of which there were piles in every corner. The\nguns were stored in the middle, in three long boxes. A taper, stuck on\na piece of wood, illumined the strange scene with a flickering glimmer.\nWhen Rougon had removed the covers of the three boxes, the spectacle\nbecame weirdly grotesque. Above the fire-arms, whose barrels shown with\na bluish, phosphorescent glitter, were outstretched necks and heads that\nbent with a sort of secret fear, while the yellow light of the taper\ncast shadows of huge noses and locks of stiffened hair upon the walls.\n\nHowever, the reactionary forces counted their numbers, and the smallness\nof the total filled them with hesitation. They were only thirty-nine all\ntold, and this adventure would mean certain death for them. A father\nof a family spoke of his children; others, without troubling themselves\nabout excuses, turned towards the door. Then, however, two fresh\nconspirators arrived, who lived in the neighbourhood of the Town\nHall, and knew for certain that there were not more than about twenty\nRepublicans still at the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. The band thereupon deliberated afresh.\nForty-one against twenty--these seemed practicable conditions. So the\narms were distributed amid a little trembling. It was Rougon who took\nthem from the boxes, and each man present, as he received his gun, the\nbarrel of which on that December night was icy cold, felt a sudden chill\nfreeze him to his bones. The shadows on the walls assumed the clumsy\npostures of bewildered conscripts stretching out their fingers. Pierre\nclosed the boxes regretfully; he left there a hundred and nine guns\nwhich he would willingly have distributed; however, he now had to divide\nthe cartridges. Of these, there were two large barrels full in the\nfurthest corner of the cart-shed, sufficient to defend Plassans against\nan army. And as this corner was dark, one of the gentlemen brought the\ntaper near, whereupon another conspirator--a burly pork-butcher, with\nimmense fists--grew angry, declaring that it was most imprudent to bring\na light so close. They strongly approved his words, so the cartridges\nwere distributed in the dark. They completely filled their pockets with\nthem. Then, after they had loaded their guns, with endless precautions,\nthey lingered there for another moment, looking at each other with\nsuspicious eyes, or exchanging glances in which cowardly ferocity was\nmingled with an expression of stupidity.\n\nIn the streets they kept close to the houses, marching silently and\nin single file, like savages on the war-path. Rougon had insisted upon\nhaving the honour of marching at their head; the time had come when he\nmust needs run some risk, if he wanted to see his schemes successful.\nDrops of perspiration poured down his forehead in spite of the cold.\nNevertheless he preserved a very martial bearing. Roudier and Granoux\nwere immediately behind him. Upon two occasions the column came to an\nabrupt halt. They fancied they had heard some distant sound of fighting;\nbut it was only the jingle of the little brass shaving-dishes hanging\nfrom chains, which are used as signs by the barbers of Southern France.\nThese dishes were gently shaking to and fro in the breeze. After each\nhalt, the saviours of Plassans continued their stealthy march in the\ndark, retaining the while the mien of terrified heroes. In this manner\nthey reached the square in front of the Town Hall. There they formed a\ngroup round Rougon, and took counsel together once more. In the facade\nof the building in front of them only one window was lighted. It was now\nnearly seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock and the dawn was approaching.\n\nAfter a good ten minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 discussion, it was decided to advance as\nfar as the door, so as to ascertain what might be the meaning of this\ndisquieting darkness and silence. The door proved to be half open. One\nof the conspirators thereupon popped his head in, but quickly withdrew\nit, announcing that there was a man under the porch, sitting against the\nwall fast asleep, with a gun between his legs. Rougon, seeing a chance\nof commencing with a deed of valour, thereupon entered first, and,\nseizing the man, held him down while Roudier gagged him. This first\ntriumph, gained in silence, singularly emboldened the little troop, who\nhad dreamed of a murderous fusillade. And Rougon had to make imperious\nsigns to restrain his soldiers from indulging in over-boisterous\ndelight.\n\nThey continued their advance on tip-toes. Then, on the left, in the\npolice guard-room, which was situated there, they perceived some fifteen\nmen lying on camp-beds and snoring, amid the dim glimmer of a lantern\nhanging from the wall. Rougon, who was decidedly becoming a great\ngeneral, left half of his men in front of the guard-room with orders not\nto rouse the sleepers, but to watch them and make them prisoners if they\nstirred. He was personally uneasy about the lighted window which they\nhad seen from the square. He still scented Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand in the\nbusiness, and, as he felt that he would first have to make prisoners of\nthose who were watching upstairs, he was not sorry to be able to adopt\nsurprise tactics before the noise of a conflict should impel them to\nbarricade themselves in the first-floor rooms. So he went up quietly,\nfollowed by the twenty heroes whom he still had at his disposal. Roudier\ncommanded the detachment remaining in the courtyard.\n\nAs Rougon had surmised, it was Macquart who was comfortably installed\nupstairs in the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office. He sat in the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm-chair,\nwith his elbows on the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing-table. With the characteristic\nconfidence of a man of coarse intellect, who is absorbed by a fixed idea\nand bent upon his own triumph, he had imagined after the departure of\nthe insurgents that Plassans was now at his complete disposal, and that\nhe would be able to act there like a conqueror. In his opinion that\nbody of three thousand men who had just passed through the town was\nan invincible army, whose mere proximity would suffice to keep the\nbourgeois humble and docile in his hands. The insurgents had imprisoned\nthe gendarmes in their barracks, the National Guard was already\ndismembered, the nobility must be quaking with terror, and the retired\ncitizens of the new town had certainly never handled a gun in their\nlives. Moreover, there were no arms any more than there were soldiers.\nThus Macquart did not even take the precaution to have the gates shut.\nHis men carried their confidence still further by falling asleep, while\nhe calmly awaited the dawn which he fancied would attract and rally all\nthe Republicans of the district round him.\n\nHe was already meditating important revolutionary measures; the\nnomination of a Commune of which he would be the chief, the imprisonment\nof all bad patriots, and particularly of all such persons as had\nincurred his displeasure. The thought of the baffled Rougons and their\nyellow drawing-room, of all that clique entreating him for mercy,\nthrilled him with exquisite pleasure. In order to while away the time he\nresolved to issue a proclamation to the inhabitants of Plassans. Four\nof his party set to work to draw up this proclamation, and when it was\nfinished Macquart, assuming a dignified manner in the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm-chair,\nhad it read to him before sending it to the printing office of the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d on whose patriotism he reckoned. One of the writers was\ncommencing, in an emphatic voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cInhabitants of Plassans, the hour\nof independence has struck, the reign of justice has begun----\u00e2\u0080\u009d when a\nnoise was heard at the door of the office, which was slowly pushed open.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it you, Cassoute?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Macquart asked, interrupting the perusal.\n\nNobody answered; but the door opened wider.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in, do!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, impatiently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs my brigand of a brother at\nhome?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, all at once both leaves of the door were violently thrown back\nand slammed against the walls, and a crowd of armed men, in the midst of\nwhom marched Rougon, with his face very red and his eyes starting out\nof their sockets, swarmed into the office, brandishing their guns like\ncudgels.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! the blackguards, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re armed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted Macquart.\n\nHe was about to seize a pair of pistols which were lying on the\nwriting-table, when five men caught hold of him by the throat and held\nhim in check. The four authors of the proclamation struggled for an\ninstant. There was a good deal of scuffling and stamping, and a noise\nof persons falling. The combatants were greatly hampered by their guns,\nwhich they would not lay aside, although they could not use them. In the\nstruggle, Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weapon, which an insurgent had tried to wrest from\nhim, went off of itself with a frightful report, and filled the room\nwith smoke. The bullet shattered a magnificent mirror that reached from\nthe mantelpiece to the ceiling, and was reputed to be one of the\nfinest mirrors in the town. This shot, fired no one knew why, deafened\neverybody, and put an end to the battle.\n\nThen, while the gentlemen were panting and puffing, three other reports\nwere heard in the courtyard. Granoux immediately rushed to one of the\nwindows. And as he and the others anxiously leaned out, their faces\nlengthened perceptibly, for they were in nowise eager for a struggle\nwith the men in the guard-room, whom they had forgotten amidst their\ntriumph. However, Roudier cried out from below that all was right. And\nGranoux then shut the window again, beaming with joy. The fact of\nthe matter was, that Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shot had aroused the sleepers, who had\npromptly surrendered, seeing that resistance was impossible. Then,\nhowever, three of Roudier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s men, in their blind haste to get the\nbusiness over, had discharged their firearms in the air, as a sort of\nanswer to the report from above, without knowing quite why they did so.\nIt frequently happens that guns go off of their own accord when they are\nin the hands of cowards.\n\nAnd now, in the room upstairs, Rougon ordered Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands to be\nbound with the bands of the large green curtains which hung at the\nwindows. At this, Macquart, wild with rage, broke into scornful jeers.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right; go on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis evening or to-morrow, when the\nothers return, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll settle accounts!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis allusion to the insurrectionary forces sent a shudder to the\nvictors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 very marrow; Rougon for his part almost choked. His brother,\nwho was exasperated at having been surprised like a child by these\nterrified bourgeois, who, old soldier that he was, he disdainfully\nlooked upon as good-for-nothing civilians, defied him with a glance of\nthe bitterest hatred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! I can tell some pretty stories about you, very pretty ones!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n the rascal exclaimed, without removing his eyes from the retired oil\nmerchant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust send me before the Assize Court, so that I may tell the\njudge a few tales that will make them laugh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this Rougon turned pale. He was terribly afraid lest Macquart should\nblab then and there, and ruin him in the esteem of the gentlemen who had\njust been assisting him to save Plassans. These gentlemen, astounded by\nthe dramatic encounter between the two brothers, and, foreseeing some\nstormy passages, had retired to a corner of the room. Rougon, however,\nformed a heroic resolution. He advanced towards the group, and in a very\nproud tone exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will keep this man here. When he has reflected\non his position he will be able to give us some useful information.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Then, in a still more dignified voice, he went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will discharge my\nduty, gentlemen. I have sworn to save the town from anarchy, and I\nwill save it, even should I have to be the executioner of my nearest\nrelative.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOne might have thought him some old Roman sacrificing his family on the\naltar of his country. Granoux, who felt deeply moved, came to press his\nhand with a tearful countenance, which seemed to say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand you;\nyou are sublime!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then he did him the kindness to take everybody\naway, under the pretext of conducting the four other prisoners into the\ncourtyard.\n\nWhen Pierre was alone with his brother, he felt all his self-possession\nreturn to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou hardly expected me, did you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nunderstand things now; you have been laying plots against me. You\nwretched fellow; see what your vices and disorderly life have brought\nyou to!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart shrugged his shoulders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShut up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo to the\ndevil. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an old rogue. He laughs best who laughs last.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThereupon Rougon, who had formed no definite plan with regard to him,\nthrust him into a dressing-room whither Monsieur Garconnet retired to\nrest sometimes. This room lighted from above, had no other means of\nexit than the doorway by which one entered. It was furnished with a few\narm-chairs, a sofa, and a marble wash-stand. Pierre double-locked the\ndoor, after partially unbinding his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands. Macquart was then\nheard to throw himself on the sofa, and start singing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCa Ira\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a\nloud voice, as though he were trying to sing himself to sleep.\n\nRougon, who at last found himself alone, now in his turn sat down in\nthe mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm-chair. He heaved a sigh as he wiped his brow. How hard,\nindeed, it was to win fortune and honours! However, he was nearing the\nend at last. He felt the soft seat of the arm-chair yield beneath him,\nwhile with a mechanical movement he caressed the mahogany writing-table\nwith his hands, finding it apparently quite silky and delicate, like the\nskin of a beautiful woman. Then he spread himself out, and assumed\nthe dignified attitude which Macquart had previously affected while\nlistening to the proclamation. The silence of the room seemed fraught\nwith religious solemnity, which inspired Rougon with exquisite delight.\nEverything, even the dust and the old documents lying in the corners,\nseemed to exhale an odour of incense, which rose to his dilated\nnostrils. This room, with its faded hangings redolent of petty\ntransactions, all the trivial concerns of a third-rate municipality,\nbecame a temple of which he was the god.\n\nNevertheless, amidst his rapture, he started nervously at every shout\nfrom Macquart. The words aristocrat and lamp-post, the threats of\nhanging that form the refrain of the famous revolutionary song, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCa\nIra,\u00e2\u0080\u009d reached him in angry bursts, interrupting his triumphant dream in\nthe most disagreeable manner. Always that man! And his dream, in which\nhe saw Plassans at his feet, ended with a sudden vision of the Assize\nCourt, of the judges, the jury, and the public listening to Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndisgraceful revelations; the story of the fifty thousand francs, and\nmany other unpleasant matters; or else, while enjoying the softness of\nMonsieur Garconnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm-chair, he suddenly pictured himself suspended\nfrom a lamp-post in the Rue de la Banne. Who would rid him of that\nwretched fellow? At last Antoine fell asleep, and then Pierre enjoyed\nten good minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pure ecstasy.\n\nRoudier and Granoux came to rouse him from this state of beatitude.\nThey had just returned from the prison, whither they had taken the\ninsurgents. Daylight was coming on apace, the town would soon be awake,\nand it was necessary to take some decisive step. Roudier declared that,\nbefore anything else, it would be advisable to issue a proclamation to\nthe inhabitants. Pierre was, at that moment, reading the one which the\ninsurgents had left upon the table.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis will suit us admirably! There are only a few\nwords to be altered.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, in fact, a quarter of an hour sufficed for the necessary changes,\nafter which Granoux read out, in an earnest voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cInhabitants of\nPlassans--The hour of resistance has struck, the reign of order has\nreturned----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was decided that the proclamation should be printed at the office of\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cGazette,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and posted at all the street corners.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow listen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rougon; \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go to my house; and in the meantime\nMonsieur Granoux will assemble here the members of the municipal council\nwho had not been arrested and acquaint them with the terrible events of\nthe night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he added, majestically: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am quite prepared to accept\nthe responsibility of my actions. If what I have already done appears a\nsatisfactory pledge of my desire for order, I am willing to place myself\nat the head of a municipal commission, until such time as the regular\nauthorities can be reinstated. But, in order, that nobody may accuse me\nof ambitious designs, I shall not re-enter the Town Hall unless called\nupon to do so by my fellow-citizens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this Granoux and Roudier protested that Plassans would not be\nungrateful. Their friend had indeed saved the town. And they recalled\nall that he had done for the cause of order: the yellow drawing-room\nalways open to the friends of authority, his services as spokesman in\nthe three quarters of the town, the store of arms which had been his\nidea, and especially that memorable night--that night of prudence and\nheroism--in which he had rendered himself forever illustrious. Granoux\nadded that he felt sure of the admiration and gratitude of the municipal\ncouncillors.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stir from your house,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he concluded; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will come and fetch you\nto lead you back in triumph.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Roudier said that he quite understood the tact and modesty of their\nfriend, and approved it. Nobody would think of accusing him of ambition,\nbut all would appreciate the delicacy which prompted him to take no\noffice save with the consent of his fellow-citizens. That was very\ndignified, very noble, altogether grand.\n\nUnder this shower of eulogies, Rougon humbly bowed his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no;\nyou go too far,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured, with voluptuous thrillings of exquisite\npleasure. Each sentence that fell from the retired hosier and the old\nalmond-merchant, who stood on his right and left respectively, fell\nsweetly on his ears; and, leaning back in the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm-chair, steeped\nin the odour of officiality which pervaded the room, he bowed to the\nright and to the left, like a royal pretender whom a _coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099etat_ is\nabout to convert into an emperor.\n\nWhen they were tired of belauding each other, they all three went\ndownstairs. Granoux started off to call the municipal council together,\nwhile Roudier told Rougon to go on in front, saying that he would join\nhim at his house, after giving the necessary orders for guarding the\nTown Hall. The dawn was now fast rising, and Pierre proceeded to the Rue\nde la Banne, tapping his heels in a martial manner on the still deserted\npavement. He carried his hat in his hand in spite of the bitter cold;\nfor puffs of pride sent all his blood to his head.\n\nOn reaching his house he found Cassoute at the bottom of the stairs. The\nnavvy had not stirred, for he had seen nobody enter. He sat there, on\nthe first step, resting his big head in his hands, and gazing fixedly in\nfront of him, with the vacant stare and mute stubbornness of a faithful\ndog.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou were waiting for me, weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pierre said to him, taking in\nthe situation at a glance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, go and tell Monsieur Macquart that\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come home. Go and ask for him at the Town Hall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCassoute rose and took himself off, with an awkward bow. He was going\nto get himself arrested like a lamb, to the great delight of Pierre,\nwho laughed as he went upstairs, asking himself, with a feeling of vague\nsurprise: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have certainly plenty of courage; shall I turn out as good\na diplomatist?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite had not gone to bed last night. He found her dressed in her\nSunday clothes, wearing a cap with lemon-coloured ribbons, like a lady\nexpecting visitors. She had sat at the window in vain; she had heard\nnothing, and was dying with curiosity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, rushing to meet her husband.\n\nThe latter, quite out of breath, entered the yellow drawing-room,\nwhither she followed him, carefully closing the door behind her. He sank\ninto an arm-chair, and, in a gasping voice, faltered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done; we\nshall get the receivership.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this she fell on his neck and kissed him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally? Really?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t heard anything. Oh, my\ndarling husband, do tell me; tell me all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe felt fifteen years old again, and began to coax him and whirl round\nhim like a grasshopper fascinated by the light and heat. And Pierre,\nin the effusion of his triumph, poured out his heart to her. He did not\nomit a single detail. He even explained his future projects, forgetting\nthat, according to his theories, wives were good for nothing, and that\nhis must be kept in complete ignorance of what went on if he wished to\nremain master. Felicite leant over him and drank in his words. She made\nhim repeat certain parts of his story, declaring she had not heard; in\nfact, her delight bewildered her so much that at times she seemed quite\ndeaf. When Pierre related the events at the Town Hall, she burst into a\nfit of laughter, changed her chair three times, and moved the furniture\nabout, quite unable to sit still. After forty years of continuous\nstruggle, fortune had at last yielded to them. Eventually she became so\nmad over it that she forgot all prudence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to me you owe all this!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed, in an outburst of triumph.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t looked after you, you would have been nicely taken in by\nthe insurgents. You booby, it was Garconnet, Sicardot, and the others,\nthat had got to be thrown to those wild beasts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, showing her teeth, loosened by age, she added, with a girlish\nsmile: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, the Republic for ever! It has made our path clear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Pierre had turned cross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just like you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nalways fancy that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve foreseen everything. It was I who had the idea\nof hiding myself. As though women understood anything about politics!\nBah, my poor girl, if you were to steer the bark we should very soon be\nshipwrecked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite bit her lip. She had gone too far and forgotten her\nself-assigned part of good, silent fairy. Then she was seized with one\nof those fits of covert exasperation, which she generally experienced\nwhen her husband tried to crush her with his superiority. And she again\npromised herself, when the right time should arrive, some exquisite\nrevenge, which would deliver this man into her power, bound hand and\nfoot.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! I was forgetting!\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed Rougon, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur Peirotte is amongst\nthem. Granoux saw him struggling in the hands of the insurgents.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite gave a start. She was just at that moment standing at the\nwindow, gazing with longing eyes at the house where the receiver of\ntaxes lived. She had felt a desire to do so, for in her mind the idea of\ntriumph was always associated with envy of that fine house.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo Monsieur Peirotte is arrested!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed in a strange tone as\nshe turned round.\n\nFor an instant she smiled complacently; then a crimson blush rushed\nto her face. A murderous wish had just ascended from the depths of her\nbeing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! if the insurgents would only kill him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre no doubt read her thoughts in her eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if some ball were to hit him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cour business would\nbe settled. There would be no necessity to supercede him, eh? and it\nwould be no fault of ours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Felicite shuddered. She felt that she had just condemned a man to\ndeath. If Monsieur Peirotte should now be killed, she would always\nsee his ghost at night time. He would come and haunt her. So she only\nventured to cast furtive glances, full of fearful delight, at the\nunhappy man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s windows. Henceforward all her enjoyment would be fraught\nwith a touch of guilty terror.\n\nMoreover, Pierre, having now poured out his soul, began to perceive the\nother side of the situation. He mentioned Macquart. How could they\nget rid of that blackguard? But Felicite, again fired with enthusiasm,\nexclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! one can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do everything at once. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll gag him, somehow.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll soon find some means or other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was now walking to and fro, putting the arm-chairs in order, and\ndusting their backs. Suddenly, she stopped in the middle of the room,\nand gave the faded furniture a long glance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood Heavens!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow ugly it is here! And we shall have\neverybody coming to call upon us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Pierre, with supreme indifference, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll alter all\nthat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe who, the night before, had entertained almost religious veneration\nfor the arm-chairs and the sofa, would now have willingly stamped on\nthem. Felicite, who felt the same contempt, even went so far as to\nupset an arm-chair which was short of a castor and did not yield to her\nquickly enough.\n\nIt was at this moment that Roudier entered. It at once occurred to\nthe old woman that he had become much more polite. His \u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadame\u00e2\u0080\u009d rolled forth in delightfully musical fashion. But the other\nhabitues were now arriving one after the other; and the drawing-room was\nfast getting full. Nobody yet knew the full particulars of the events\nof the night, and all had come in haste, with wondering eyes and smiling\nlips, urged on by the rumours which were beginning to circulate through\nthe town. These gentlemen who, on the previous evening, had left the\ndrawing-room with such precipitation at the news of the insurgents\u00e2\u0080\u0099\napproach, came back, inquisitive and importunate, like a swarm of\nbuzzing flies which a puff of wind would have dispersed. Some of\nthem had not even taken time to put on their braces. They were very\nimpatient, but it was evident that Rougon was waiting for some one else\nbefore speaking out. He constantly turned an anxious look towards\nthe door. For an hour there was only significant hand-shaking, vague\ncongratulation, admiring whispering, suppressed joy of uncertain origin,\nwhich only awaited a word of enlightenment to turn to enthusiasm.\n\nAt last Granoux appeared. He paused for a moment on the threshold,\nwith his right hand pressed to his breast between the buttons of his\nfrock-coat; his broad pale face was beaming; in vain he strove to\nconceal his emotion beneath an expression of dignity. All the others\nbecame silent on perceiving him; they felt that something extraordinary\nwas about to take place. Granoux walked straight up to Rougon, through\ntwo lines of visitors, and held out his hand to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI bring you the homage of the Municipal Council.\nThey call you to their head, until our mayor shall be restored to us.\nYou have saved Plassans. In the terrible crisis through which we are\npassing we want men who, like yourself, unite intelligence with courage.\nCome--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this point Granoux, who was reciting a little speech which he had\ntaken great trouble to prepare on his way from the Town Hall to the\nRue de la Banne felt his memory fail him. But Rougon, overwhelmed with\nemotion, broke in, shaking his hand and repeating: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, my dear\nGranoux; I thank you very much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe could find nothing else to say. However, a loud burst of voices\nfollowed. Every one rushed upon him, tried to shake hands, poured forth\npraises and compliments, and eagerly questioned him. But he, already\nputting on official dignity, begged for a few minutes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 delay in order\nthat he might confer with Messieurs Granoux and Roudier. Business before\neverything. The town was in such a critical situation! Then the three\naccomplices retired to a corner of the drawing-room, where, in an\nundertone, they divided power amongst themselves; the rest of the\nvisitors, who remained a few paces away, trying meanwhile to look\nextremely wise and furtively glancing at them with mingled admiration\nand curiosity. It was decided that Rougon should take the title of\npresident of the Municipal Commission; Granoux was to be secretary;\nwhilst, as for Roudier, he became commander-in-chief of the reorganised\nNational Guard. They also swore to support each other against all\nopposition.\n\nHowever, Felicite, who had drawn near, abruptly inquired: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Vuillet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this they looked at each other. Nobody had seen Vuillet. Rougon\nseemed somewhat uneasy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken him away with the others,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, to ease his\nmind.\n\nBut Felicite shook her head. Vuillet was not the man to let himself be\narrested. Since nobody had seen or heard him, it was certain he had been\ndoing something wrong.\n\nSuddenly the door opened and Vuillet entered, bowing humbly, with\nblinking glance and stiff sacristan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile. Then he held out his moist\nhand to Rougon and the two others.\n\nVuillet had settled his little affairs alone. He had cut his own slice\nout of the cake, as Felicite would have said. While peeping through\nthe ventilator of his cellar he had seen the insurgents arrest\nthe postmaster, whose offices were near his bookshop. At daybreak,\ntherefore, at the moment when Rougon was comfortably seated in the\nmayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm-chair, he had quietly installed himself in the postmaster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\noffice. He knew the clerks; so he received them on their arrival,\ntold them that he would replace their chief until his return, and that\nmeantime they need be in nowise uneasy. Then he ransacked the morning\nmail with ill-concealed curiosity. He examined the letters, and seemed\nto be seeking a particular one. His new berth doubtless suited his\nsecret plans, for his satisfaction became so great that he actually gave\none of the clerks a copy of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cOeuvres Badines de Piron.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vuillet, it\nshould be mentioned, did business in objectionable literature, which he\nkept concealed in a large drawer, under the stock of heads and\nreligious images. It is probable that he felt some slight qualms at\nthe free-and-easy manner in which he had taken possession of the post\noffice, and recognised the desirability of getting his usurpation\nconfirmed as far as possible. At all events, he had thought it well to\ncall upon Rougon, who was fast becoming an important personage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy! where have you been?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite asked him in a distrustful manner.\n\nThereupon he related his story with sundry embellishments. According to\nhis own account he had saved the post-office from pillage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right then! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s settled! Stay on there!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pierre, after a\nmoment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reflection. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMake yourself useful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis last sentence revealed the one great fear that possessed the\nRougons. They were afraid that some one might prove too useful, and\ndo more than themselves to save the town. Still, Pierre saw no serious\ndanger in leaving Vuillet as provisional postmaster; it was even a\nconvenient means of getting rid of him. Felicite, however, made a sharp\ngesture of annoyance.\n\nThe consultation having ended, the three accomplices mingled with the\nvarious groups that filled the drawing-room. They were at last obliged\nto satisfy the general curiosity by giving detailed accounts of recent\nevents. Rougon proved magnificent. He exaggerated, embellished, and\ndramatised the story which he had related to his wife. The distribution\nof the guns and cartridges made everybody hold their breath. But it was\nthe march through the deserted streets and the seizure of the town-hall\nthat most amazed these worthy bourgeois. At each fresh detail there was\nan interruption.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you were only forty-one; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marvellous!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, indeed! it must have been frightfully dark!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; I confess I never should have dared it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you seized him, like that, by the throat?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the insurgents, what did they say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese remarks and questions only incited Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imagination the more.\nHe replied to everybody. He mimicked the action. This stout man, in his\nadmiration of his own achievements, became as nimble as a schoolboy; he\nbegan afresh, repeated himself, amidst the exclamations of surprise and\nindividual discussions which suddenly arose about some trifling detail.\nAnd thus he continued blowing his trumpet, making himself more and\nmore important as if some irresistible force impelled him to turn his\nnarrative into a genuine epic. Moreover Granoux and Roudier stood by\nhis side prompting him, reminding him of such trifling matters as he\nomitted. They also were burning to put in a word, and occasionally\nthey could not restrain themselves, so that all three went on talking\ntogether. When, in order to keep the episode of the broken mirror for\nthe denouement, like some crowning glory, Rougon began to describe what\nhad taken place downstairs in the courtyard, after the arrest of the\nguard, Roudier accused him of spoiling the narrative by changing\nthe sequence of events. For a moment they wrangled about it somewhat\nsharply. Then Roudier, seeing a good opportunity for himself, suddenly\nexclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, let it be so. But you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there. So let me\ntell it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe thereupon explained at great length how the insurgents had awoke, and\nhow the muskets of the town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deliverers had been levelled at them to\nreduce them to impotence. He added, however, that no blood, fortunately,\nhad been shed. This last sentence disappointed his audience, who had\ncounted upon one corpse at least.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I thought you fired,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted Felicite, recognising that the\nstory was wretchedly deficient in dramatic interest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, three shots,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the old hosier. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pork-butcher\nDubruel, Monsieur Lievin, and Monsieur Massicot discharged their guns\nwith really culpable alacrity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as there were some murmurs at this\nremark; \u00e2\u0080\u009cCulpable, I repeat the word,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are quite\nenough cruel necessities in warfare without any useless shedding of\nblood. Besides, these gentlemen swore to me that it was not their fault;\nthey can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand how it was their guns went off. Nevertheless, a\nspent ball after ricocheting grazed the cheek of one of the insurgents\nand left a mark on it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis graze, this unexpected wound, satisfied the audience. Which cheek,\nright or left, had been grazed, and how was it that a bullet, a spent\none, even, could strike a cheek without piercing it? These points\nsupplied material for some long discussions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeantime,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Rougon at the top of his voice, without giving\ntime for the excitement to abate; \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeantime we had plenty to do\nupstairs. The struggle was quite desperate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he described, at length, the arrival of his brother and the four\nother insurgents, without naming Macquart, whom he simply called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nleader.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm-chair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing table,\u00e2\u0080\u009d recurred to him every instant, and in the\nopinion of his audience imparted marvellous grandeur to the terrible\nscene. It was not at the porter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lodge that the fight was now being\nwaged, but in the private sanctum of the chief magistrate of the town.\nRoudier was quite cast in to the background. Then Rougon at last came to\nthe episode which he had been keeping in reserve from the commencement,\nand which would certainly exalt him to the dignity of a hero.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThereupon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009can insurgent rushes upon me. I push the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\narm-chair away, and seize the man by the throat. I hold him tightly,\nyou may be sure of it! But my gun was in my way. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to let\nit drop; a man always sticks to his gun. I held it, like this, under the\nleft arm. All of a sudden, it went off--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe whole audience hung on Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips. But Granoux, who was opening\nhis mouth wide with a violent itching to say something, shouted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\nno, that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t right. You were not in a position to see things, my\nfriend; you were fighting like a lion. But I saw everything, while I was\nhelping to bind one of the prisoners. The man tried to murder you; it\nwas he who fired the gun; I saw him distinctly slip his black fingers\nunder your arm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rougon, turning quite pale.\n\nHe did not know he had been in such danger, and the old almond\nmerchant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account of the incident chilled him with fright. Granoux, as\na rule, did not lie; but, on a day of battle, it is surely allowable to\nview things dramatically.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you the man tried to murder you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated, with conviction.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rougon in a faint voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it is I heard the bullet\nwhiz past my ear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this, violent emotion came upon the audience. Everybody gazed at\nthe hero with respectful awe. He had heard a bullet whiz past his ear!\nCertainly, none of the other bourgeois who were there could say as much.\nFelicite felt bound to rush into her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms so as to work up\nthe emotion to boiling point. But Rougon immediately freed himself,\nand concluded his narrative with this heroic sentence, which has become\nfamous at Plassans: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe shot goes off; I hear the bullet whiz past my\near; and whish! it smashes the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mirror.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis caused complete consternation. Such a magnificent mirror, too!\nIt was scarcely credible! the damage done to that looking-glass almost\nout-balanced Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heroism, in the estimation of the company. The\nglass became an object of absorbing interest, and they talked about\nit for a quarter of an hour, with many exclamations and expressions of\nregret, as though it had been some dear friend that had been stricken to\nthe heart. This was the culminating point that Rougon had aimed at, the\ndenouement of his wonderful Odyssey. A loud hubbub of voices filled\nthe yellow drawing-room. The visitors were repeating what they had just\nheard, and every now and then one of them would leave a group to ask the\nthree heroes the exact truth with regard to some contested incident. The\nheroes set the matter right with scrupulous minuteness, for they felt\nthat they were speaking for history!\n\nAt last Rougon and his two lieutenants announced that they were expected\nat the town-hall. Respectful silence was then restored, and the company\nsmiled at each other discreetly. Granoux was swelling with importance.\nHe was the only one who had seen the insurgent pull the trigger and\nsmash the mirror; this sufficed to exalt him, and almost made him burst\nhis skin. On leaving the drawing-room, he took Roudier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm with the\nair of a great general who is broken down with fatigue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been up\nfor thirty-six hours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand heaven alone knows when I shall\nget to bed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRougon, as he withdrew, took Vuillet aside and told him that the party\nof order relied more than ever on him and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGazette.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He would have\nto publish an effective article to reassure the inhabitants and treat\nthe band of villains who had passed through Plassans as it deserved.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe easy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Vuillet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the ordinary course the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gazette\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nought not to appear till to-morrow morning, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll issue it this very\nevening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the leaders had left, the rest of the visitors remained in the\nyellow drawing-room for another moment, chattering like so many\nold women, whom the escape of a canary has gathered together on the\npavement. These retired tradesmen, oil dealers, and wholesale hatters,\nfelt as if they were in a sort of fairyland. Never had they experienced\nsuch thrilling excitement before. They could not get over their surprise\nat discovering such heroes as Rougon, Granoux, and Roudier in their\nmidst. At last, half stifled by the stuffy atmosphere, and tired of ever\ntelling each other the same things, they decided to go off and spread\nthe momentous news abroad. They glided away one by one, each anxious\nto have the glory of being the first to know and relate everything, and\nFelicite, as she leaned out of the window, on being left alone, saw\nthem dispersing in the Rue de la Banne, waving their arms in an excited\nmanner, eager as they were to diffuse emotion to the four corners of the\ntown.\n\nIt was ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, and Plassans, now wide awake, was running about the\nstreets, wildly excited by the reports which were circulating. Those who\nhad seen or heard the insurrectionary forces, related the most foolish\nstories, contradicting each other, and indulging in the wildest\nsuppositions. The majority, however, knew nothing at all about the\nmatter; they lived at the further end of the town, and listened with\ngaping mouths, like children to a nursery tale, to the stories of how\nseveral thousand bandits had invaded the streets during the night and\nvanished before daybreak like an army of phantoms. A few of the most\nsceptical said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNonsense!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yet some of the details were very precise;\nand Plassans at last felt convinced that some frightful danger had\npassed over it while it slept. The darkness which had shrouded this\ndanger, the various contradictory reports that spread, all invested the\nmatter with mystery and vague horror, which made the bravest shudder.\nWhose hand had diverted the thunderbolt from them? There seemed to\nbe something quite miraculous about it. There were rumours of unknown\ndeliverers, of a handful of brave men who had cut off the hydra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head;\nbut no one seemed acquainted with the exact particulars, and the whole\nstory appeared scarcely credible, until the company from the yellow\ndrawing-room spread through the streets, scattering tidings, ever\nrepeating the same narrative at each door they came to.\n\nIt was like a train of powder. In a few minutes the story had spread\nfrom one end of the town to the other. Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name flew from mouth to\nmouth, with exclamations of surprise in the new town, and of praise in\nthe old quarter. The idea of being without a sub-prefect, a mayor, a\npostmaster, a receiver of taxes, or authorities of any kind, at first\nthrew the inhabitants into consternation. They were stupefied at having\nbeen able to sleep through the night and get up as usual, in the\nabsence of any settled government. Their first stupor over, they\nthrew themselves recklessly into the arms of their liberators. The few\nRepublicans shrugged their shoulders, but the petty shopkeepers, the\nsmall householders, the Conservatives of all shades, invoked blessings\non those modest heroes whose achievements had been shrouded by the\nnight. When it was known that Rougon had arrested his own brother, the\npopular admiration knew no bounds. People talked of Brutus, and thus the\nindiscretion which had made Pierre rather anxious, really redounded\nto his glory. At this moment when terror still hovered over them,\nthe townsfolk were virtually unanimous in their gratitude. Rougon was\naccepted as their saviour without the slightest show of opposition.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust think of it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the poltroons exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere were only forty-one\nof them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat number of forty-one amazed the whole town, and this was the\norigin of the Plassans legend of how forty-one bourgeois had made three\nthousand insurgents bite the dust. There were only a few envious spirits\nof the new town, lawyers without work and retired military men ashamed\nof having slept ingloriously through that memorable night, who raised\nany doubts. The insurgents, these sceptics hinted, had no doubt left\nthe town of their own accord. There were no indications of a combat,\nno corpses, no blood-stains. So the deliverers had certainly had a very\neasy task.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the mirror, the mirror!\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated the enthusiasts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny\nthat the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mirror has been smashed; go and see it for yourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, in fact, until night-time, quite a stream of town\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-people flowed,\nunder one pretext or another, into the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private office, the door\nof which Rougon left wide open. The visitors planted themselves in front\nof the mirror, which the bullet had pierced and starred, and they all\ngave vent to the same exclamation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy Jove; that ball must have had\nterrible force!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen they departed quite convinced.\n\nFelicite, at her window, listened with delight to all the rumours and\nlaudatory and grateful remarks which arose from the town. At that moment\nall Plassans was talking of her husband. She felt that the two districts\nbelow her were quivering, wafting her the hope of approaching triumph.\nAh! how she would crush that town which she had been so long in getting\nbeneath her feet! All her grievances crowded back to her memory, and her\npast disappointments redoubled her appetite for immediate enjoyment.\n\nAt last she left the window, and walked slowly round the drawing-room.\nIt was there that, a little while previously, everybody had held out\ntheir hands to her husband and herself. He and she had conquered; the\ncitizens were at their feet. The yellow drawing-room seemed to her a\nholy place. The dilapidated furniture, the frayed velvet, the chandelier\nsoiled with fly-marks, all those poor wrecks now seemed to her like\nthe glorious bullet-riddled debris of a battle-field. The plain of\nAusterlitz would not have stirred her to deeper emotion.\n\nWhen she returned to the window, she perceived Aristide wandering about\nthe place of the Sub-Prefecture, with his nose in the air. She beckoned\nto him to come up, which he immediately did. It seemed as if he had only\nbeen waiting for this invitation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his mother said to him on the landing, seeing that he\nhesitated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour father is not here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAristide evinced all the shyness of a prodigal son returning home. He\nhad not been inside the yellow drawing-room for nearly four years. He\nstill carried his arm in a sling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes your hand still pain you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d his mother asked him, ironically.\n\nHe blushed as he answered with some embarrassment: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting\nbetter; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nearly well again now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he lingered there, loitering about and not knowing what to say.\nFelicite came to the rescue. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard them talking about\nyour father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s noble conduct?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she resumed.\n\nHe replied that the whole town was talking of it. And then, as he\nregained his self-possession, he paid his mother back for her raillery\nin her own coin. Looking her full in the face he added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI came to see\nif father was wounded.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play the fool!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Felicite, petulantly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I were you\nI would act boldly and decisively. Confess now that you made a false\nmove in joining those good-for-nothing Republicans. You would be very\nglad, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure, to be well rid of them, and to return to us, who are the\nstronger party. Well, the house is open to you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Aristide protested. The Republic was a grand idea. Moreover, the\ninsurgents might still carry the day.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk nonsense to me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted the old woman, with some\nirritation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re afraid that your father won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a very warm\nwelcome for you. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see to that. Listen to me: go back to your\nnewspaper, and, between now and to-morrow, prepare a number strongly\nfavouring the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat. To-morrow evening, when this number has\nappeared, come back here and you will be received with open arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen seeing that the young man remained silent: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you hear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nadded, in a lower and more eager tone; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is necessary for our sake,\nand for your own, too, that it should be done. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let us have any\nmore nonsense and folly. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already compromised yourself enough in\nthat way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young man made a gesture--the gesture of a Caesar crossing the\nRubicon--and by doing so escaped entering into any verbal engagement. As\nhe was about to withdraw, his mother, looking for the knot in his sling,\nremarked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst of all, you must let me take off this rag. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting\na little ridiculous, you know!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAristide let her remove it. When the silk handkerchief was untied,\nhe folded it neatly and placed it in his pocket. And as he kissed his\nmother he exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTill to-morrow then!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the meanwhile, Rougon was taking official possession of the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\noffices. There were only eight municipal councillors left; the others\nwere in the hands of the insurgents, as well as the mayor and his two\nassessors. The eight remaining gentlemen, who were all on a par with\nGranoux, perspired with fright when the latter explained to them the\ncritical situation of the town. It requires an intimate knowledge of the\nkind of men who compose the municipal councils of some of the smaller\ntowns, in order to form an idea of the terror with which these timid\nfolk threw themselves into Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms. At Plassans, the mayor had\nthe most incredible blockheads under him, men without any ideas of their\nown, and accustomed to passive obedience. Consequently, as Monsieur\nGarconnet was no longer there, the municipal machine was bound to get\nout of order, and fall completely under the control of the man who might\nknow how to set it working. Moreover, as the sub-prefect had left the\ndistrict, Rougon naturally became sole and absolute master of the town;\nand thus, strange to relate, the chief administrative authority fell\ninto the hands of a man of indifferent repute, to whom, on the previous\nevening, not one of his fellow-citizens would have lent a hundred\nfrancs.\n\nPierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first act was to declare the Provisional Commission \u00e2\u0080\u009cen\npermanence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he gave his attention to the organisation of the\nnational guard, and succeeded in raising three hundred men. The\nhundred and nine muskets left in the cart-shed were also distributed\nto volunteers, thereby bringing up the number of men armed by the\nreactionary party to one hundred and fifty; the remaining one hundred\nand fifty guards consisted of well-affected citizens and some of\nSicardot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soldiers. When Commander Roudier reviewed the little army in\nfront of the town-hall, he was annoyed to see the market-people smiling\nin their sleeves. The fact is that several of his men had no uniforms,\nand some of them looked very droll with their black hats, frock-coats,\nand muskets. But, at any rate, they meant well. A guard was left at the\ntown-hall and the rest of the forces were sent in detachments to the\nvarious town gates. Roudier reserved to himself the command of the guard\nstationed at the Grand\u00e2\u0080\u0099-Porte, which seemed to be more liable to attack\nthan the others.\n\nRougon, who now felt very conscious of his power, repaired to the Rue\nCanquoin to beg the gendarmes to remain in their barracks and interfere\nwith nothing. He certainly had the doors of the gendarmerie opened--the\nkeys having been carried off by the insurgents--but he wanted to triumph\nalone, and had no intention of letting the gendarmes rob him of any part\nof his glory. If he should really have need of them he could always\nsend for them. So he explained to them that their presence might tend to\nirritate the working-men and thus aggravate the situation. The sergeant\nin command thereupon complimented him on his prudence. When Rougon was\ninformed that there was a wounded man in the barracks, he asked to see\nhim, by way of rendering himself popular. He found Rengade in bed, with\nhis eye bandaged, and his big moustaches just peeping out from under the\nlinen. With some high-sounding words about duty, Rougon endeavoured to\ncomfort the unfortunate fellow who, having lost an eye, was swearing\nwith exasperation at the thought that his injury would compel him to\nquit the service. At last Rougon promised to send the doctor to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m much obliged to you, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rengade replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut, you know, what\nwould do me more good than any quantity of doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stuff would be to\nwring the neck of the villain who put my eye out. Oh! I shall know him\nagain; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little thin, palish fellow, quite young.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThereupon Pierre bethought himself of the blood he had seen on Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhand. He stepped back a little, as though he was afraid that Rengade\nwould fly at his throat, and cry: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was your nephew who blinded me;\nand you will have to pay for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And whilst he was mentally cursing his\ndisreputable family, he solemnly declared that if the guilty person were\nfound he should be punished with all the rigour of the law.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worth all that trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the one-eyed man replied;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just wring his neck for him when I catch him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRougon hastened back to the town-hall. The afternoon was employed in\ntaking various measures. The proclamation posted up about one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock\nproduced an excellent impression. It ended by an appeal to the good\nsense of the citizens, and gave a firm assurance that order would not\nagain be disturbed. Until dusk, in fact, the streets presented a picture\nof general relief and perfect confidence. On the pavements, the groups\nwho were reading the proclamation exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all finished now; we shall soon see the troops who have been sent\nin pursuit of the insurgents.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis belief that some soldiers were approaching was so general that the\nidles of the Cours Sauvaire repaired to the Nice road, in order to\nmeet and hear the regimental band. But they returned at nightfall\ndisappointed, having seen nothing; and then a feeling of vague alarm\nbegan to disturb the townspeople.\n\nAt the town-hall, the Provisional Commission had talked so much, without\ncoming to any decision, that the members, whose stomachs were quite\nempty, began to feel alarmed again. Rougon dismissed them to dine,\nsaying that they would meet afresh at nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the evening. He\nwas just about to leave the room himself, when Macquart awoke and began\nto pommel the door of his prison. He declared he was hungry, then asked\nwhat time it was, and when his brother had told him it was five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock,\nhe feigned great astonishment, and muttered, with diabolical malice,\nthat the insurgents had promised to return much earlier, and that they\nwere very slow in coming to deliver him. Rougon, having ordered\nsome food to be taken to him, went downstairs, quite worried by the\nearnestness with which the rascal spoke of the return of the insurgents.\n\nWhen he reached the street, his disquietude increased. The town seemed\nto him quite altered. It was assuming a strange aspect; shadows were\ngliding along the footpaths, which were growing deserted and silent,\nwhile gloomy fear seemed, like fine rain, to be slowly, persistently\nfalling with the dusk over the mournful-looking houses. The babbling\nconfidence of the daytime was fatally terminating in groundless panic,\nin growing alarm as the night drew nearer; the inhabitants were so weary\nand so satiated with their triumph that they had no strength left but to\ndream of some terrible retaliation on the part of the insurgents. Rougon\nshuddered as he passed through this current of terror. He hastened his\nsteps, feeling as if he would choke. As he passed a cafe on the Place\ndes Recollets, where the lamps had just been lit, and where the petty\ncits of the new town were assembled, he heard a few words of terrifying\nconversation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell! Monsieur Picou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one man in a thick voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard the\nnews? The regiment that was expected has not arrived.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut nobody expected any regiment, Monsieur Touche,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a shrill voice\nreplied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon. You haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read the proclamation, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true the placards declare that order will be maintained by\nforce, if necessary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, then, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s force mentioned; that means armed forces, of\ncourse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do people say then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you know, folks are beginning to feel rather frightened; they say\nthat this delay on the part of the soldiers isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t natural, and that the\ninsurgents may well have slaughtered them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA cry of horror resounded through the cafe. Rougon was inclined to go in\nand tell those bourgeois that the proclamation had never announced the\narrival of a regiment, that they had no right to strain its meaning\nto such a degree, nor to spread such foolish theories abroad. But he\nhimself, amidst the disquietude which was coming over him, was not quite\nsure he had not counted upon a despatch of troops; and he did, in fact,\nconsider it strange that not a single soldier had made his appearance.\nSo he reached home in a very uneasy state of mind. Felicite, still\npetulant and full of courage, became quite angry at seeing him upset by\nsuch silly trifles. Over the dessert she comforted him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you great simpleton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cso much the better, if the\nprefect does forget us! We shall save the town by ourselves. For my\npart, I should like to see the insurgents return, so that we might\nreceive them with bullets and cover ourselves with glory. Listen to\nme, go and have the gates closed, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go to bed; bustle about all\nnight; it will all be taken into account later on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre returned to the town-hall in rather more cheerful spirits. He\nrequired some courage to remain firm amidst the woeful maunderings of\nhis colleagues. The members of the Provisional Commission seemed to reek\nwith panic, just as they might with damp in the rainy season. They all\nprofessed to have counted upon the despatch of a regiment, and began to\nexclaim that brave citizens ought not to be abandoned in such a manner\nto the fury of the rabble. Pierre, to preserve peace, almost promised\nthey should have a regiment on the morrow. Then he announced, in a\nsolemn manner, that he was going to have the gates closed. This came as\na relief. Detachments of the national guards had to repair immediately\nto each gate and double-lock it. When they had returned, several members\nconfessed that they really felt more comfortable; and when Pierre\nremarked that the critical situation of the town imposed upon them the\nduty of remaining at their posts, some of them made arrangements with\nthe view of spending the night in an arm-chair. Granoux put on a black\nsilk skull cap which he had brought with him by way of precaution.\nTowards eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, half of the gentlemen were sleeping round\nMonsieur Garconnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing table. Those who still managed to keep\ntheir eyes open fancied, as they listened to the measured tramp of\nthe national guards in the courtyard, that they were heroes and were\nreceiving decorations. A large lamp, placed on the writing-table,\nillumined this strange vigil. All at once, however, Rougon, who had\nseemed to be slumbering, jumped up, and sent for Vuillet. He had just\nremembered that he had not received the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGazette.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe bookseller made his appearance in a very bad humour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rougon asked him as he took him aside, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat about the article\nyou promised me? I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen the paper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that what you disturbed me for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vuillet angrily retorted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Gazette\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has not been issued; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve no desire to get myself murdered\nto-morrow, should the insurgents come back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRougon tried to smile as he declared that, thank heaven, nobody would be\nmurdered at all. It was precisely because false and disquieting rumours\nwere running about that the article in question would have rendered\ngreat service to the good cause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPossibly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vuillet resumed; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut the best of causes at the present\ntime is to keep one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he added, with\nmaliciousness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I was under the impression you had killed all the\ninsurgents! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve left too many of them for me to run any risk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRougon, when he was alone again, felt amazed at this mutiny on the part\nof a man who was usually so meek and mild. Vuillet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct seemed\nto him suspicious. But he had no time to seek an explanation; he had\nscarcely stretched himself out afresh in his arm-chair, when Roudier\nentered, with a big sabre, which he had attached to his belt, clattering\nnoisily against his legs. The sleepers awoke in a fright. Granoux\nthought it was a call to arms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEh? what! What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, as he hastily put his black\nsilk cap into his pocket.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Roudier, breathlessly, without thinking of taking\nany oratorical precautions, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that a band of insurgents is\napproaching the town.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese words were received with the silence of terror. Rougon alone had\nthe strength to ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you seen them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the retired hosier replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut we hear strange noises out in the\ncountry; one of my men assured me that he had seen fires along the slope\nof the Garrigues.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, as all the gentlemen stared at each other white and speechless,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll return to my post,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fear an attack. You had\nbetter take precautions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRougon would have followed him, to obtain further particulars, but he\nwas already too far away. After this the Commission was by no means\ninclined to go to sleep again. Strange noises! Fires! An attack! And\nin the middle of the night too! It was very easy to talk of taking\nprecautions, but what were they to do? Granoux was very near advising\nthe course which had proved so successful the previous evening: that\nis of hiding themselves, waiting till the insurgents has passed through\nPlassans, and then triumphing in the deserted streets. Pierre, however,\nfortunately remembering his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice, said that Roudier might\nhave made a mistake, and that the best thing would be to go and see for\nthemselves. Some of the members made a wry face at this suggestion;\nbut when it had been agreed that an armed escort should accompany the\nCommission, they all descended very courageously. They only left a few\nmen downstairs; they surrounded themselves with about thirty of the\nnational guards, and then they ventured into the slumbering town, where\nthe moon, creeping over the house roofs, slowly cast lengthened shadows.\nThey went along the ramparts, from one gate to the other, seeing nothing\nand hearing nothing. The national guards at the various posts certainly\ntold them that peculiar sounds occasionally reached them from the\ncountry through the closed gates. When they strained their ears,\nhowever, they detected nothing but a distant murmur, which Granoux said\nwas merely the noise of the Viorne.\n\nNevertheless they remained doubtful. And they were about to return to\nthe town-hall in a state of alarm, though they made a show of shrugging\ntheir shoulders and of treating Roudier as a poltroon and a dreamer,\nwhen Rougon, anxious to reassure them, thought of enabling them to\nview the plain over a distance of several leagues. Thereupon he led the\nlittle company to the Saint-Marc quarter and knocked at the door of the\nValqueyras mansion.\n\nAt the very outset of the disturbances Count de Valqueyras had left for\nhis chateau at Corbiere. There was no one but the Marquis de Carnavant\nat the Plassans house. He, since the previous evening, had prudently\nkept aloof; not that he was afraid, but because he did not care to be\nseen plotting with the Rougons at the critical moment. As a matter\nof fact, he was burning with curiosity. He had been compelled to shut\nhimself up in order to resist the temptation of hastening to the yellow\ndrawing-room. When the footman came to tell him, in the middle of the\nnight, that there were some gentlemen below asking for him, he could not\nhold back any longer. He got up and went downstairs in all haste.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Marquis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rougon, as he introduced to him the members\nof the Municipal Commission, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe want to ask a favour of you. Will you\nallow us to go into the garden of the mansion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy all means,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the astonished marquis, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will conduct you\nthere myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn the way thither he ascertained what their object was. At the end of\nthe garden rose a terrace which overlooked the plain. A large portion of\nthe ramparts had there tumbled in, leaving a boundless prospect to the\nview. It had occurred to Rougon that this would serve as an excellent\npost of observation. While conversing together the members of the\nCommission leaned over the parapet. The strange spectacle that spread\nout before them soon made them silent. In the distance, in the valley of\nthe Viorne, across the vast hollow which stretched westward between the\nchain of the Garrigues and the mountains of the Seille, the rays of the\nmoon were streaming like a river of pale light. The clumps of trees, the\ngloomy rocks, looked, here and there, like islets and tongues of land,\nemerging from a luminous sea; and, according to the bends of the Viorne\none could now and again distinguish detached portions of the river,\nglittering like armour amidst the fine silvery dust falling from the\nfirmament. It all looked like an ocean, a world, magnified by the\ndarkness, the cold, and their own secret fears. At first the gentlemen\ncould neither hear nor see anything. The quiver of light and of distant\nsound blinded their eyes and confused their ears. Granoux, though he\nwas not naturally poetic, was struck by the calm serenity of that winter\nnight, and murmured: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a beautiful night, gentlemen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoudier was certainly dreaming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Rougon, rather disdainfully.\n\nBut the marquis, whose ears were quick, had begun to listen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nobserved in his clear voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hear the tocsin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this they all leant over the parapet, holding their breath. And light\nand pure as crystal the distant tolling of a bell rose from the plain.\nThe gentlemen could not deny it. It was indeed the tocsin. Rougon\npretended that he recognised the bell of Beage, a village fully a league\nfrom Plassans. This he said in order to reassure his colleagues.\n\nBut the marquis interrupted him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, listen: this time it is the\nbell of Saint-Maur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he indicated another point of the horizon to\nthem. There was, in fact, a second bell wailing through the clear night.\nAnd very soon there were ten bells, twenty bells, whose despairing\ntollings were detected by their ears, which had by this time grown\naccustomed to the quivering of the darkness. Ominous calls rose from all\nsides, like the faint rattles of dying men. Soon the whole plain seemed\nto be wailing. The gentlemen no longer jeered at Roudier; particularly\nas the marquis, who took a malicious delight in terrifying them, was\nkind enough to explain the cause of all this bell-ringing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is the neighbouring villages,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to Rougon, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbanding together\nto attack Plassans at daybreak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this Granoux opened his eyes wide. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see something just\nthis moment over there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked all of a sudden.\n\nNobody had looked; the gentlemen had been keeping their eyes closed in\norder to hear the better.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! look!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed after a short pause. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, beyond the Viorne,\nnear that black mass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Rougon, in despair; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fire they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kindling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA moment later another fire appeared almost immediately in front of\nthe first one, then a third, and a fourth. In this wise red splotches\nappeared at nearly equal distances throughout the whole length of the\nvalley, resembling the lamps of some gigantic avenue. The moonlight,\nwhich dimmed their radiance, made them look like pools of blood. This\nmelancholy illumination gave a finishing touch to the consternation of\nthe Municipal Commission.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the marquis muttered, with his bitterest sneer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose\nbrigands are signalling to each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he counted the fires\ncomplacently, to get some idea, he said, as to how many men \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe brave\nnational guard of Plassans\u00e2\u0080\u009d would have to deal with. Rougon endeavoured\nto raise doubts by saying the villages were taking up arms in order to\njoin the army of the insurgents, and not for the purpose of attacking\nthe town. But the gentlemen, by their silent consternation, made\nit clear that they had formed their own opinion, and were not to be\nconsoled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can hear the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Marseillaise\u00e2\u0080\u0099 now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d remarked Granoux in a hushed voice.\n\nIt was indeed true. A detachment must have been following the course of\nthe Viorne, passing, at that moment, just under the town. The cry, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo\narms, citizens! Form your battalions!\u00e2\u0080\u009d reached the on-lookers in sudden\nbursts with vibrating distinctness. Ah! what an awful night it was! The\ngentlemen spent it leaning over the parapet of the terrace, numbed by\nthe terrible cold, and yet quite unable to tear themselves away from\nthe sight of that plain which resounded with the tocsin and the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarseillaise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and was all ablaze with signal-fires. They feasted their\neyes upon that sea of light, flecked with blood-red flames; and they\nstrained their ears in order to listen to the confused clamour, till at\nlast their senses began to deceive them, and they saw and heard the most\nfrightful things. Nothing in the world would have induced them to leave\nthe spot. If they had turned their backs, they would have fancied that\na whole army was at their heels. After the manner of a certain class\nof cowards, they wished to witness the approach of the danger, in order\nthat they might take flight at the right moment. Towards morning, when\nthe moon had set and they could see nothing in front of them but a\ndark void, they fell into a terrible fright. They fancied they were\nsurrounded by invisible enemies, who were crawling along in the\ndarkness, ready to fly at their throats. At the slightest noise they\nimagined there were enemies deliberating beneath the terrace, prior to\nscaling it. Yet there was nothing, nothing but darkness upon which they\nfixed their eyes distractedly. The marquis, as if to console them, said\nin his ironical way: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be uneasy! They will certainly wait till\ndaybreak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMeanwhile Rougon cursed and swore. He felt himself again giving way to\nfear. As for Granoux, his hair turned completely white. At last the dawn\nappeared with weary slowness. This again was a terribly anxious moment.\nThe gentlemen, at the first ray of light, expected to see an army drawn\nup in line before the town. It so happened that day that the dawn was\nlazy and lingered awhile on the edge of the horizon. With outstretched\nnecks and fixed gaze, the party on the terrace peered anxiously into the\nmisty expanse. In the uncertain light they fancied they caught glimpses\nof colossal profiles, the plain seemed to be transformed into a lake of\nblood, the rocks looked like corpses floating on its surface, and the\nclusters of trees took the forms of battalions drawn up and threatening\nattack. When the growing light had at last dispersed these phantoms,\nthe morning broke so pale, so mournful, so melancholy, that even the\nmarquis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spirits sank. Not a single insurgent was to be seen, and the\nhigh roads were free; but the grey valley wore a gruesomely sad and\ndeserted aspect. The fires had now gone out, but the bells still rang\non. Towards eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, Rougon observed a small party of men who were\nmoving off along the Viorne.\n\nBy this time the gentlemen were half dead with cold and fatigue. Seeing\nno immediate danger, they determined to take a few hours\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rest. A\nnational guard was left on the terrace as a sentinel, with orders to\nrun and inform Roudier if he should perceive any band approaching in the\ndistance. Then Granoux and Rougon, quite worn out by the emotions of the\nnight, repaired to their homes, which were close together, and supported\neach other on the way.\n\nFelicite put her husband to bed with every care. She called him \u00e2\u0080\u009cpoor\ndear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and repeatedly told him that he ought not to give way to evil\nfancies, and that all would end well. But he shook his head; he felt\ngrave apprehensions. She let him sleep till eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. Then, after\nhe had had something to eat, she gently turned him out of doors, making\nhim understand that he must go through with the matter to the end.\nAt the town-hall, Rougon found only four members of the Commission in\nattendance; the others had sent excuses, they were really ill. Panic\nhad been sweeping through the town with growing violence all through the\nmorning. The gentlemen had not been able to keep quiet respecting the\nmemorable night they had spent on the terrace of the Valqueyras mansion.\nTheir servants had hastened to spread the news, embellishing it with\nvarious dramatic details. By this time it had already become a matter of\nhistory that from the heights of Plassans troops of cannibals had been\nseen dancing and devouring their prisoners. Yes, bands of witches had\ncircled hand in hand round their caldrons in which they were boiling\nchildren, while on and on marched endless files of bandits, whose\nweapons glittered in the moonlight. People spoke too of bells that of\ntheir own accord, sent the tocsin ringing through the desolate air,\nand it was even asserted that the insurgents had fired the neighbouring\nforests, so that the whole country side was in flames.\n\nIt was Tuesday, the market-day at Plassans, and Roudier had thought it\nnecessary to have the gates opened in order to admit the few peasants\nwho had brought vegetables, butter, and eggs. As soon as it had\nassembled, the Municipal Commission, now composed of five members only,\nincluding its president, declared that this was unpardonable imprudence.\nAlthough the sentinel stationed at the Valqueyras mansion had seen\nnothing, the town ought to have been kept closed. Then Rougon decided\nthat the public crier, accompanied by a drummer, should go through the\nstreets, proclaim a state of siege, and announce to the inhabitants\nthat whoever might go out would not be allowed to return. The gates were\nofficially closed in broad daylight. This measure, adopted in order to\nreassure the inhabitants, raised the scare to its highest pitch. And\nthere could scarcely have been a more curious sight than that of this\nlittle city, thus padlocking and bolting itself up beneath the bright\nsunshine, in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nWhen Plassans had buckled and tightened its belt of dilapidated\nramparts, when it had bolted itself in like a besieged fortress at\nthe approach of an assault, the most terrible anguish passed over the\nmournful houses. At every moment, in the centre of the town, people\nfancied they could hear a discharge of musketry in the Faubourgs. They\nno longer received any news; they were, so to say, at the bottom of\na cellar, in a walled hole, where they were anxiously awaiting\neither deliverance or the finishing stroke. For the last two days\nthe insurgents, who were scouring the country, had cut off all\ncommunication. Plassans found itself isolated from the rest of France.\nIt felt that it was surrounded by a region in open rebellion, where the\ntocsin was ever ringing and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarseillaise\u00e2\u0080\u009d was ever roaring like\na river that has overflowed its banks. Abandoned to its fate and\nshuddering with alarm the town lay there like some prey which would\nprove the reward of the victorious party. The strollers on the Cours\nSauvaire were ever swaying between fear and hope according as they\nfancied that they could see the blouses of insurgents or the uniforms\nof soldiers at the Grand\u00e2\u0080\u0099-Porte. Never had sub-prefecture, pent within\ntumble-down walls, endured more agonising torture.\n\nTowards two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock it was rumoured that the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat had failed,\nthat the prince-president was imprisoned at Vincennes, and that Paris\nwas in the hands of the most advanced demagogues. It was reported also\nthat Marseilles, Toulon, Draguignan, the entire South, belonged to the\nvictorious insurrectionary army. The insurgents would arrive in the\nevening and put Plassans to the sword.\n\nThereupon a deputation repaired to the town-hall to expostulate with\nthe Municipal Commission for closing the gates, whereby they would only\nirritate the insurgents. Rougon, who was losing his head, defended his\norder with all his remaining strength. This locking of the gates seemed\nto him one of the most ingenious acts of his administration; he advanced\nthe most convincing arguments in its justification. But the others\nembarrassed him by their questions, asking him where were the soldiers,\nthe regiment that he had promised. Then he began to lie, and told them\nflatly that he had promised nothing at all. The non-appearance of this\nlegendary regiment, which the inhabitants longed for with such eagerness\nthat they had actually dreamt of its arrival, was the chief cause of the\npanic. Well-informed people even named the exact spot on the high road\nwhere the soldiers had been butchered.\n\nAt four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock Rougon, followed by Granoux, again repaired to the\nValqueyras mansion. Small bands, on their way to join the insurgents at\nOrcheres, still passed along in the distance, through the valley of the\nViorne. Throughout the day urchins climbed the ramparts, and bourgeois\ncame to peep through the loopholes. These volunteer sentinels kept up\nthe terror by counting the various bands, which were taken for so many\nstrong battalions. The timorous population fancied it could see from the\nbattlements the preparations for some universal massacre. At dusk, as on\nthe previous evening, the panic became yet more chilling.\n\nOn returning to the municipal offices Rougon and his inseparable\ncompanion, Granoux, recognised that the situation was growing\nintolerable. During their absence another member of the Commission had\ndisappeared. They were only four now, and they felt they were making\nthemselves ridiculous by staying there for hours, looking at each\nother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pale countenances, and never saying a word. Moreover, they were\nterribly afraid of having to spend a second night on the terrace of the\nValqueyras mansion.\n\nRougon gravely declared that as the situation of affairs was unchanged,\nthere was no need for them to continue to remain there _en permanence_.\nIf anything serious should occur information would be sent to them. And,\nby a decision duly taken in council, he deputed to Roudier the carrying\non of the administration. Poor Roudier, who remembered that he had\nserved as a national guard in Paris under Louis-Philippe, was meantime\nconscientiously keeping watch at the Grand\u00e2\u0080\u0099-Porte.\n\nRougon went home looking very downcast, and creeping along under the\nshadows of the houses. He felt that Plassans was becoming hostile\nto him. He heard his name bandied about amongst the groups, with\nexpressions of anger and contempt. He walked upstairs, reeling and\nperspiring. Felicite received him with speechless consternation. She,\nalso, was beginning to despair. Their dreams were being completely\nshattered. They stood silent, face to face, in the yellow drawing-room.\nThe day was drawing to a close, a murky winter day which imparted a\nmuddy tint to the orange-coloured wall-paper with its large flower\npattern; never had the room looked more faded, more mean, more shabby.\nAnd at this hour they were alone; they no longer had a crowd of\ncourtiers congratulating them, as on the previous evening. A single\nday had sufficed to topple them over, at the very moment when they were\nsinging victory. If the situation did not change on the morrow their\ngame would be lost.\n\nFelicite who, when gazing on the previous evening at the ruins of\nthe yellow drawing-room, had thought of the plains of Austerlitz, now\nrecalled the accursed field of Waterloo as she observed how mournful\nand deserted the place was. Then, as her husband said nothing, she\nmechanically went to the window--that window where she had inhaled with\ndelight the incense of the entire town. She perceived numerous groups\nbelow on the square, but she closed the blinds upon seeing some heads\nturn towards their house, for she feared that she might be hooted. She\nfelt quite sure that those people were speaking about them.\n\nIndeed, voices rose through the twilight. A lawyer was clamouring in the\ntone of a triumphant pleader. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just what I said; the insurgents\nleft of their own accord, and they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask the permission of the\nforty-one to come back. The forty-one indeed! a fine farce! Why, I\nbelieve there were at least two hundred.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a burly trader, an oil-dealer and a great politician,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere were probably not even ten. There was no fighting or else we\nshould have seen some blood in the morning. I went to the town-hall\nmyself to look; the courtyard was as clean as my hand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen a workman, who stepped timidly up to the group, added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was\nno need of any violence to seize the building; the door wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even\nshut.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis remark was received with laughter, and the workman, thus\nencouraged, continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs for those Rougons, everybody knows that they\nare a bad lot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis insult pierced Felicite to the heart. The ingratitude of the\npeople was heartrending to her, for she herself was at last beginning to\nbelieve in the mission of the Rougons. She called for her husband. She\nwanted him to learn how fickle was the multitude.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all a piece with their mirror,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the lawyer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a fuss\nthey made about that broken glass! You know that Rougon is quite capable\nof having fired his gun at it just to make believe there had been a\nbattle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre restrained a cry of pain. What! they did not even believe in his\nmirror now! They would soon assert that he had not heard a bullet whiz\npast his ear. The legend of the Rougons would be blotted out; nothing\nwould remain of their glory. But his torture was not at an end yet.\nThe groups manifested their hostility as heartily as they had displayed\ntheir approval on the previous evening. A retired hatter, an old man\nseventy years of age, whose factory had formerly been in the Faubourg,\nferreted out the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 past history. He spoke vaguely, with the\nhesitation of a wandering memory, about the Fouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 property, and\nAdelaide, and her amours with a smuggler. He said just enough to give\na fresh start to the gossip. The tattlers drew closer together and such\nwords as \u00e2\u0080\u009crogues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cthieves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cshameless intriguers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ascended to\nthe shutter behind which Pierre and Felicite were perspiring with fear\nand indignation. The people on the square even went so far as to pity\nMacquart. This was the final blow. On the previous day Rougon had been a\nBrutus, a stoic soul sacrificing his own affections to his country; now\nhe was nothing but an ambitious villain, who felled his brother to the\nground and made use of him as a stepping-stone to fortune.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou hear, you hear them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pierre murmured in a stifled voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! the\nscoundrels, they are killing us; we shall never retrieve ourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite, enraged, was beating a tattoo on the shutter with her\nimpatient fingers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet them talk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we get the upper hand again they\nshall see what stuff I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m made of. I know where the blow comes from. The\nnew town hates us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe guessed rightly. The sudden unpopularity of the Rougons was the\nwork of a group of lawyers who were very much annoyed at the importance\nacquired by an old illiterate oil-dealer, whose house had been on the\nverge of bankruptcy. The Saint-Marc quarter had shown no sign of life\nfor the last two days. The inhabitants of the old quarter and the new\ntown alone remained in presence, and the latter had taken advantage\nof the panic to injure the yellow drawing-room in the minds of the\ntradespeople and working-classes. Roudier and Granoux were said to\nbe excellent men, honourable citizens, who had been led away by the\nRougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 intrigues. Their eyes ought to be opened to it. Ought not\nMonsieur Isidore Granoux to be seated in the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm-chair, in the\nplace of that big portly beggar who had not a copper to bless himself\nwith? Thus launched, the envious folks began to reproach Rougon for\nall the acts of his administration, which only dated from the previous\nevening. He had no right to retain the services of the former Municipal\nCouncil; he had been guilty of grave folly in ordering the gates to be\nclosed; it was through his stupidity that five members of the Commission\nhad contracted inflammation of the lungs on the terrace of the\nValqueyras mansion. There was no end to his faults. The Republicans\nlikewise raised their heads. They talked of the possibility of a sudden\nattack upon the town-hall by the workmen of the Faubourg. The reaction\nwas at its last gasp.\n\nPierre, at this overthrow of all his hopes, began to wonder what support\nhe might still rely on if occasion should require any.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Aristide to come here this evening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto make it up\nwith us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Felicite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe promised me a good article. The\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Independant\u00e2\u0080\u0099 has not appeared yet--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut her husband interrupted her, crying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSee! isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that he who is just\ncoming out of the Sub-Prefecture?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old woman glanced in that direction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got his arm in a sling\nagain!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\nAristide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand was indeed wrapped in the silk handkerchief once more.\nThe Empire was breaking up, but the Republic was not yet triumphant,\nand he had judged it prudent to resume the part of a disabled man. He\ncrossed the square stealthily, without raising his head. Then doubtless\nhearing some dangerous and compromising remarks among the groups of\nbystanders, he made all haste to turn the corner of the Rue de la Banne.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah! he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Felicite bitterly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all up with us.\nEven our children forsake us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shut the window violently, in order that she might not see or hear\nanything more. When she had lit the lamp, she and her husband sat down\nto dinner, disheartened and without appetite, leaving most of their food\non their plates. They only had a few hours left them to take a decisive\nstep. It was absolutely indispensable that before daybreak Plassans\nshould be at their feet beseeching forgiveness, or else they must\nentirely renounce the fortune which they had dreamed of. The total\nabsence of any reliable news was the sole cause of their anxious\nindecision. Felicite, with her clear intellect, had quickly perceived\nthis. If they had been able to learn the result of the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat,\nthey would either have faced it out and have still pursued their role of\ndeliverers, or else have done what they could to efface all recollection\nof their unlucky campaign. But they had no precise information; they\nwere losing their heads; the thought that they were thus risking their\nfortune on a throw, in complete ignorance of what was happening, brought\na cold perspiration to their brows.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why the devil doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Eugene write to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rougon suddenly cried,\nin an outburst of despair, forgetting that he was betraying the secret\nof his correspondence to his wife.\n\nBut Felicite pretended not to have heard. Her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exclamation\nhad profoundly affected her. Why, indeed, did not Eugene write to his\nfather? After keeping him so accurately informed of the progress of the\nBonapartist cause, he ought at least to have announced the triumph or\ndefeat of Prince Louis. Mere prudence would have counselled the\ndespatch of such information. If he remained silent, it must be that the\nvictorious Republic had sent him to join the pretender in the dungeons\nof Vincennes. At this thought Felicite felt chilled to the marrow; her\nson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silence destroyed her last hopes.\n\nAt that moment somebody brought up the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGazette,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which had only just\nappeared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Pierre, with surprise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVuillet has issued his paper!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThereupon he tore off the wrapper, read the leading article, and\nfinished it looking as white as a sheet, and swaying on his chair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, read,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed, handing the paper to Felicite.\n\nIt was a magnificent article, attacking the insurgents with unheard of\nviolence. Never had so much stinging bitterness, so many falsehoods,\nsuch bigoted abuse flowed from pen before. Vuillet commenced by\nnarrating the entry of the insurgents into Plassans. The description\nwas a perfect masterpiece. He spoke of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthose bandits, those\nvillainous-looking countenances, that scum of the galleys,\u00e2\u0080\u009d invading the\ntown, \u00e2\u0080\u009cintoxicated with brandy, lust, and pillage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he exhibited\nthem \u00e2\u0080\u009cparading their cynicism in the streets, terrifying the inhabitants\nwith their savage cries and seeking only violence and murder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Further\non, the scene at the town-hall and the arrest of the authorities became\na most horrible drama. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen they seized the most respectable people by\nthe throat; and the mayor, the brave commander of the national\nguard, the postmaster, that kindly functionary, were--even like the\nDivinity--crowned with thorns by those wretches, who spat in their\nfaces.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The passage devoted to Miette and her red pelisse was quite a\nflight of imagination. Vuillet had seen ten, twenty girls steeped in\nblood: \u00e2\u0080\u009cand who,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid not behold among those monsters some\ninfamous creatures clothed in red, who must have bathed themselves in\nthe blood of the martyrs murdered by the brigands along the high roads?\nThey were brandishing banners, and openly receiving the vile caresses of\nthe entire horde.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Vuillet added, with Biblical magniloquence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nRepublic ever marches on amidst debauchery and murder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat, however, was only the first part of the article; the narrative\nbeing ended, the editor asked if the country would any longer tolerate\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe shamelessness of those wild beasts, who respected neither property\nnor persons.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He made an appeal to all valorous citizens, declaring that\nto tolerate such things any longer would be to encourage them, and\nthat the insurgents would then come and snatch \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe daughter from her\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms, the wife from her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embraces.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And at last,\nafter a pious sentence in which he declared that Heaven willed the\nextermination of the wicked, he concluded with this trumpet blast: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\nis asserted that these wretches are once more at our gates; well then\nlet each one of us take a gun and shoot them down like dogs. I for my\npart shall be seen in the front rank, happy to rid the earth of such\nvermin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis article, in which periphrastic abuse was strung together with all\nthe heaviness of touch which characterises French provincial journalism,\nquite terrified Rougon, who muttered, as Felicite replaced the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGazette\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n on the table: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! the wretch! he is giving us the last blow; people\nwill believe that I inspired this diatribe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his wife remarked, pensively, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid you not this morning tell me\nthat he absolutely refused to write against the Republicans? The news\nthat circulated had terrified him, and he was as pale as death, you\nsaid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes! yes! I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand it at all. When I insisted, he went so\nfar as to reproach me for not having killed all the insurgents. It was\nyesterday that he ought to have written that article; to-day he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get\nus all butchered!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite was lost in amazement. What could have prompted Vuillet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nchange of front? The idea of that wretched semi-sacristan carrying a\nmusket and firing on the ramparts of Plassans seemed to her one of the\nmost ridiculous things imaginable. There was certainly some determining\ncause underlying all this which escaped her. Only one thing seemed\ncertain. Vuillet was too impudent in his abuse and too ready with his\nvalour, for the insurrectionary band to be really so near the town as\nsome people asserted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a spiteful fellow, I always said so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rougon resumed, after\nreading the article again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has only been waiting for an opportunity\nto do us this injury. What a fool I was to leave him in charge of the\npost-office!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis last sentence proved a flash of light. Felicite started up quickly,\nas though at some sudden thought. Then she put on a cap and threw a\nshawl over her shoulders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere are you going, pray?\u00e2\u0080\u009d her husband asked her with surprise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npast nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou go to bed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied rather brusquely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not well; go and\nrest yourself. Sleep on till I come back; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wake you if necessary,\nand then we can talk the matter over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe went out with her usual nimble gait, ran to the post-office, and\nabruptly entered the room where Vuillet was still at work. On seeing her\nhe made a hasty gesture of vexation.\n\nNever in his life had Vuillet felt so happy. Since he had been able\nto slip his little fingers into the mail-bag he had enjoyed the most\nexquisite pleasure, the pleasure of an inquisitive priest about to\nrelish the confessions of his penitents. All the sly blabbing, all the\nvague chatter of sacristies resounded in his ears. He poked his long,\npale nose into the letters, gazed amorously at the superscriptions with\nhis suspicious eyes, sounded the envelopes just like little abbes sound\nthe souls of maidens. He experienced endless enjoyment, was titillated\nby the most enticing temptation. The thousand secrets of Plassans lay\nthere. He held in his hand the honour of women, the fortunes of men,\nand had only to break a seal to know as much as the grand vicar at the\ncathedral who was the confidant of all the better people of the town.\nVuillet was one of those terribly bitter, frigid gossips, who worm out\neverything, but never repeat what they hear, except by way of dealing\nsomebody a mortal blow. He had, consequently, often longed to dip his\narms into the public letter-box. Since the previous evening the private\nroom at the post-office had become a big confessional full of darkness\nand mystery, in which he tasted exquisite rapture while sniffing at the\nletters which exhaled veiled longings and quivering avowals. Moreover,\nhe carried on his work with consummate impudence. The crisis through\nwhich the country was passing secured him perfect impunity. If some\nletters should be delayed, or others should miscarry altogether, it\nwould be the fault of those villainous Republicans who were scouring\nthe country and interrupting all communication. The closing of the town\ngates had for a moment vexed him, but he had come to an understanding\nwith Roudier, whereby the couriers were allowed to enter and bring the\nmails direct to him without passing by the town-hall.\n\nAs a matter of fact he had only opened a few letters, the important\nones, those in which his keen scent divined some information which it\nwould be useful for him to know before anybody else. Then he contented\nhimself by locking up in a drawer, for delivery subsequently, such\nletters as might give information and rob him of the merit of his\nvalour at a time when the whole town was trembling with fear. This pious\npersonage, in selecting the management of the post-office as his own\nshare of the spoils, had given proof of singular insight into the\nsituation.\n\nWhen Madame Rougon entered, he was taking his choice of a heap of\nletters and papers, under the pretext, no doubt, of classifying them.\nHe rose, with his humble smile, and offered her a seat; his reddened\neyelids blinking rather uneasily. But Felicite did not sit down; she\nroughly exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want the letter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this Vuillet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes opened widely, with an expression of perfect\ninnocence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat letter, madame?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe letter you received this morning for my husband. Come, Monsieur\nVuillet, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in a hurry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd as he stammered that he did not know, that he had not seen anything,\nthat it was very strange, Felicite continued in a covertly threatening\nvoice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cA letter from Paris, from my son, Eugene; you know what I mean,\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look for it myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThereupon she stepped forward as if intending to examine the various\npackets which littered the writing table. But he at once bestirred\nhimself, and said he would go and see. The service was necessarily in\ngreat confusion! Perhaps, indeed, there might be a letter. In that case\nthey would find it. But, as far as he was concerned, he swore he had not\nseen any. While he was speaking he moved about the office turning over\nall the papers. Then he opened the drawers and the portfolios. Felicite\nwaited, quite calm and collected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, indeed, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a letter for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried at last,\nas he took a few papers from a portfolio. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! those confounded clerks,\nthey take advantage of the situation to do nothing in the proper way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite took the letter and examined the seal attentively, apparently\nquite regardless of the fact that such scrutiny might wound Vuillet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsusceptibilities. She clearly perceived that the envelope must have been\nopened; the bookseller, in his unskilful way, had used some sealing\nwax of a darker colour to secure it again. She took care to open the\nenvelope in such a manner as to preserve the seal intact, so that it\nmight serve as proof of this. Then she read the note. Eugene briefly\nannounced the complete success of the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat. Paris was subdued,\nthe provinces generally speaking remained quiet, and he counselled\nhis parents to maintain a very firm attitude in face of the partial\ninsurrection which was disturbing the South. In conclusion he told them\nthat the foundation of their fortune was laid, if they did not weaken.\n\nMadame Rougon put the letter in her pocket, and sat down slowly, looking\ninto Vuillet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. The latter had resumed his sorting in a feverish\nmanner, as though he were very busy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen to me, Monsieur Vuillet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to him. And when he raised\nhis head: \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us play our cards openly; you do wrong to betray us; some\nmisfortune may befall you. If, instead of unsealing our letters--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt this he protested, and feigned great indignation. But she calmly\ncontinued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know, I know your school, you never confess. Come, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlet us waste any more words, what interest have you in favouring the\nCoup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd, as he continued to assert his perfect honesty, she at last lost\npatience. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou take me for a fool!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read your article.\nYou would do much better to act in concert with us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThereupon, without avowing anything, he flatly submitted that he wished\nto have the custom of the college. Formerly it was he who had supplied\nthat establishment with school books. But it had become known that he\nsold objectionable literature clandestinely to the pupils; for which\nreason, indeed, he had almost been prosecuted at the Correctional Police\nCourt. Since then he had jealously longed to be received back into the\ngood graces of the directors.\n\nFelicite was surprised at the modesty of his ambition, and told him so.\nTo open letters and risk the galleys just for the sake of selling a few\ndictionaries and grammars!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed in a shrill voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an assured sale of four or\nfive thousand francs a year. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t aspire to impossibilities like some\npeople.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not take any notice of his last taunting words. No more was said\nabout his opening the letters. A treaty of alliance was concluded, by\nwhich Vuillet engaged that he would not circulate any news or take any\nstep in advance, on condition that the Rougons should secure him the\ncustom of the college. As she was leaving, Felicite advised him not to\ncompromise himself any further. It would be sufficient for him to detain\nthe letters and distribute them only on the second day.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a knave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she muttered, when she reached the street, forgetting\nthat she herself had just laid an interdict upon the mail.\n\nShe went home slowly, wrapped in thought. She even went out of her\nway, passing along the Cours Sauvaire, as if to gain time and ease for\nreflection before going in. Under the trees of the promenade she met\nMonsieur de Carnavant, who was taking advantage of the darkness to\nferret about the town without compromising himself. The clergy of\nPlassans, to whom all energetic action was distasteful, had, since the\nannouncement of the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat, preserved absolute neutrality. In the\npriests\u00e2\u0080\u0099 opinion the Empire was virtually established, and they awaited\nan opportunity to resume in some new direction their secular intrigues.\nThe marquis, who had now become a useless agent, remained only\ninquisitive on one point--he wished to know how the turmoil would\nfinish, and in what manner the Rougons would play their role to the end.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you, little one!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, as soon as he recognized\nFelicite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wanted to see you; your affairs are getting muddled!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no; everything is going on all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, in an\nabsent-minded way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo much the better. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell me all about it, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? Ah! I must\nconfess that I gave your husband and his colleagues a terrible fright\nthe other night. You should have seen how comical they looked on the\nterrace, while I was pointing out a band of insurgents in every cluster\nof trees in the valley! You forgive me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m much obliged to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Felicite quickly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should have made\nthem die of fright. My husband is a big sly-boots. Come and see me some\nmorning, when I am alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she turned away, as though this meeting with the marquis had\ndetermined her. From head to foot the whole of her little person\nbetokened implacable resolution. At last she was going to revenge\nherself on Pierre for his petty mysteries, have him under her heel, and\nsecure, once for all, her omnipotence at home. There would be a fine\nscene, quite a comedy, indeed, the points of which she was already\nenjoying in anticipation, while she worked out her plan with all the\nspitefulness of an injured woman.\n\nShe found Pierre in bed, sleeping heavily; she brought the candle near\nhim for an instant, and gazed with an air of compassion, at his big\nface, across which slight twitches occasionally passed; then she sat\ndown at the head of the bed, took off her cap, let her hair fall loose,\nassumed the appearance of one in despair, and began to sob quite loudly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHallo! What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter? What are you crying for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Pierre,\nsuddenly awaking.\n\nShe did not reply, but cried more bitterly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, do answer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued her husband, frightened by this mute\ndespair. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere have you been? Have you seen the insurgents?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shook her head; then, in a faint voice, she said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just come\nfrom the Valqueyras mansion. I wanted to ask Monsieur de Carnavant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nadvice. Ah! my dear, all is lost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre sat up in bed, very pale. His bull neck, which his unbuttoned\nnight-shirt exposed to view, all his soft, flabby flesh seemed to swell\nwith terror. At last he sank back, pale and tearful, looking like some\ngrotesque Chinese figure in the middle of the untidy bed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe marquis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Felicite, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthinks that Prince Louis has\nsuccumbed. We are ruined; we shall never get a sou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThereupon, as often happens with cowards, Pierre flew into a passion. It\nwas the marquis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fault, it was his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fault, the fault of all\nhis family. Had he ever thought of politics at all, until Monsieur de\nCarnavant and Felicite had driven him to that tomfoolery?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wash my hands of it altogether,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you two who are\nresponsible for the blunder. Wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it better to go on living on\nour little savings in peace and quietness? But then, you were always\ndetermined to have your own way! You see what it has brought us to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was losing his head completely, and forgot that he had shown himself\nas eager as his wife. However, his only desire now was to vent his\nanger, by laying the blame of his ruin upon others.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, moreover,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould we ever have succeeded with\nchildren like ours? Eugene abandons us just at the critical moment;\nAristide has dragged us through the mire, and even that big simpleton\nPascal is compromising us by his philanthropic practising among the\ninsurgents. And to think that we brought ourselves to poverty simply to\ngive them a university education!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, as he drew breath, Felicite said to him softly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are\nforgetting Macquart.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! yes; I was forgetting him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed more violently than ever;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another whom I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think of without losing all patience! But\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all; you know little Silvere. Well, I saw him at my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthe other evening with his hands covered with blood. He has put some\ngendarme\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye out. I did not tell you of it, as I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to\nfrighten you. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see one of my nephews in the Assize Court. Ah!\nwhat a family! As for Macquart, he has annoyed us to such an extent that\nI felt inclined to break his head for him the other day when I had a gun\nin my hand. Yes, I had a mind to do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite let the storm pass over. She had received her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nreproaches with angelic sweetness, bowing her head like a culprit,\nwhereby she was able to smile in her sleeve. Her demeanour provoked and\nmaddened Pierre. When speech failed the poor man, she heaved deep sighs,\nfeigning repentance; and then she repeated, in a disconsolate voice:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhatever shall we do! Whatever shall we do! We are over head and ears\nin debt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your fault!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pierre cried, with all his remaining strength.\n\nThe Rougons, in fact, owed money on every side. The hope of approaching\nsuccess had made them forget all prudence. Since the beginning of 1851\nthey had gone so far as to entertain the frequenters of the yellow\ndrawing-room every evening with syrup and punch, and cakes--providing,\nin fact, complete collations, at which they one and all drank to the\ndeath of the Republic. Besides this, Pierre had placed a quarter of\nhis capital at the disposal of the reactionary party, as a contribution\ntowards the purchase of guns and cartridges.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pastry-cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bill amounts to at least a thousand francs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite\nresumed, in her sweetest tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand we probably owe twice as much to\nthe liqueur-dealer. Then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the butcher, the baker, the\ngreengrocer----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre was in agony. And Felicite struck him a final blow by adding: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nsay nothing of the ten thousand francs you gave for the guns.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI, I!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he faltered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I was deceived, I was robbed! It was that\nidiot Sicardot who let me in for that by swearing that the Napoleonists\nwould be triumphant. I thought I was only making an advance. But the old\ndolt will have to repay me my money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get anything back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his wife, shrugging her\nshoulders. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall suffer the fate of war. When we have paid off\neverything, we sha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have enough to buy dry bread with. Ah! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbeen a fine campaign. We can now go and live in some hovel in the old\nquarter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis last phrase had a most lugubrious sound. It seemed like the knell\nof their existence. Pierre pictured the hovel in the old quarter, which\nhad just been mentioned by Felicite. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Twas there, then, that he would\ndie on a pallet, after striving all his life for the enjoyment of ease\nand luxury. In vain had he robbed his mother, steeped his hands in the\nfoulest intrigues, and lied and lied for many a long year. The Empire\nwould not pay his debts--that Empire which alone could save him. He\njumped out of bed in his night-shirt, crying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take my gun; I\nwould rather let the insurgents kill me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite rejoined, with great composure, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can have that done\nto-morrow or the day after; the Republicans are not far off. And that\nway will do as well as another to make an end of matters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre shuddered. It seemed as if some one had suddenly poured a large\npail of cold water over his shoulders. He slowly got into bed again, and\nwhen he was warmly wrapped up in the sheets, he began to cry. This\nfat fellow easily burst into tears--gently flowing, inexhaustible\ntears--which streamed from his eyes without an effort. A terrible\nreaction was now going on within him. After his wrath he became as\nweak as a child. Felicite, who had been waiting for this crisis, was\ndelighted to see him so spiritless, so resourceless, and so humbled\nbefore her. She still preserved silence, and an appearance of distressed\nhumility. After a long pause, her seeming resignation, her mute\ndejection, irritated Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nerves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut do say something!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he implored; \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us think matters over\ntogether. Is there really no hope left us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNone, you know very well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou explained the situation\nyourself just now; we have no help to expect from anyone; even our\nchildren have betrayed us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us flee, then. Shall we leave Plassans to-night--immediately?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFlee! Why, my dear, to-morrow we should be the talk of the whole town.\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you remember, too, that you have had the gates closed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA violent struggle was going on in Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, which he exerted to\nthe utmost in seeking for some solution; at last, as though he felt\nvanquished, he murmured, in supplicating tones: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI beseech you, do try\nto think of something; you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t said anything yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite raised her head, feigning surprise; and with a gesture of\ncomplete powerlessness she said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a fool in these matters. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nunderstand anything about politics, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve told me so a hundred times.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then, as her embarrassed husband held his tongue and lowered his\neyes, she continued slowly, but not reproachfully: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have not kept me\ninformed of your affairs, have you? I know nothing at all about them, I\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even give you any advice. It was quite right of you, though; women\nchatter sometimes, and it is a thousand times better for the men to\nsteer the ship alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe said this with such refined irony that her husband did not detect\nthat she was deriding him. He simply felt profound remorse. And, all of\na sudden, he burst out into a confession. He spoke of Eugene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letters,\nexplained his plans, his conduct, with all the loquacity of a man who\nis relieving his conscience and imploring a saviour. At every moment\nhe broke off to ask: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat would you have done in my place?\u00e2\u0080\u009d or else\nhe cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that so? I was right, I could not act otherwise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But\nFelicite did not even deign to make a sign. She listened with all the\nfrigid reserve of a judge. In reality she was tasting the most exquisite\npleasure; she had got that sly-boots fast at last; she played with him\nlike a cat playing with a ball of paper; and he virtually held out his\nhands to be manacled by her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut wait,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said hastily, jumping out of bed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you Eugene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncorrespondence to read. You can judge the situation better then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe vainly tried to hold him back by his night-shirt. He spread out the\nletters on the table by the bed-side, and then got into bed again, and\nread whole pages of them, and compelled her to go through them herself.\nShe suppressed a smile, and began to feel some pity for the poor man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said anxiously, when he had finished, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow you know\neverything. Do you see any means of saving us from ruin!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe still gave no answer. She appeared to be pondering deeply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are an intelligent woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, in order to flatter her,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did wrong in keeping any secret from you; I see it now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us say nothing more about that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my opinion, if\nyou had enough courage----\u00e2\u0080\u009d And as he looked at her eagerly, she broke\noff and said, with a smile: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you promise not to distrust me any\nmore? You will tell me everything, eh? You will do nothing without\nconsulting me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe swore, and accepted the most rigid conditions. Felicite then got into\nbed; and in a whisper, as if she feared somebody might hear them, she\nexplained at length her plan of campaign. In her opinion the town\nmust be allowed to fall into still greater panic, while Pierre was to\nmaintain an heroic demeanour in the midst of the terrified inhabitants.\nA secret presentiment, she said, warned her that the insurgents were\nstill at a distance. Moreover, the party of order would sooner or later\ncarry the day, and the Rougons would be rewarded. After the role of\ndeliverer, that of martyr was not to be despised. And she argued so\nwell, and spoke with so much conviction, that her husband, surprised at\nfirst by the simplicity of her plan, which consisted in facing it out,\nat last detected in it a marvellous tactical scheme, and promised to\nconform to it with the greatest possible courage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget that it is I who am saving you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old woman\nmurmured in a coaxing tone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you be nice to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey kissed each other and said good-night. But neither of them slept;\nafter a quarter of an hour had gone by, Pierre, who had been gazing at\nthe round reflection of the night-lamp on the ceiling, turned, and in a\nfaint whisper told his wife of an idea that had just occurred to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! no, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite murmured, with a shudder. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat would be too\ncruel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut you want to spread consternation among the\ninhabitants! They would take me seriously, if what I told you should\noccur.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then perfecting his scheme, he cried: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe might employ Macquart.\nThat would be a means of getting rid of him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite seemed to be struck with the idea. She reflected, seemed to\nhesitate, and then, in a distressful tone faltered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps you are\nright. We must see. After all we should be very stupid if we were\nover-scrupulous, for it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a matter of life and death to us. Let me do\nit. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see Macquart to-morrow, and ascertain if we can come to\nan understanding with him. You would only wrangle and spoil all.\nGood-night; sleep well, my poor dear. Our troubles will soon be ended,\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey again kissed each other and fell asleep. The patch of light on the\nceiling now seemed to be assuming the shape of a terrified eye, that\nstared wildly and fixedly upon the pale, slumbering couple who reeked\nwith crime beneath their very sheets, and dreamt they could see a rain\nof blood falling in big drops which turned into golden coins as they\nplashed upon the floor.\n\nOn the morrow, before daylight, Felicite repaired to the town-hall,\narmed with instructions from Pierre to seek an interview with Macquart.\nShe took her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national guard uniform with her, wrapped in a\ncloth. There were only a few men fast asleep in the guard-house. The\ndoorkeeper, who was entrusted with the duty of supplying Macquart with\nfood, went upstairs with her to open the door of the dressing-room,\nwhich had been turned into a cell. Then quietly he came down again.\n\nMacquart had now been kept in the room for two days and two nights. He\nhad had time to indulge in lengthy reflections. After his sleep, his\nfirst hours had been given up to outbursts of impotent rage. Goaded by\nthe idea that his brother was lording it in the adjoining room, he had\nfelt a great longing to break the door open. At all events he would\nstrangle Rougon with his own hands, as soon as the insurgents should\nreturn and release him. But, in the evening, at twilight, he calmed\ndown, and gave over striding furiously round the little room. He inhaled\na sweet odour there; a feeling of comfort relaxed his nerves. Monsieur\nGarconnet, who was very rich, refined, and vain, had caused this little\nroom to be arranged in a very elegant fashion; the sofa was soft and\nwarm; scents, pomades, and soaps adorned the marble washstand, and the\npale light fell from the ceiling with a soft glow, like the gleams of\na lamp suspended in an alcove. Macquart, amidst this perfumed soporific\natmosphere fell asleep, thinking that those scoundrels, the rich, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere\nvery fortunate, all the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He had covered himself with a blanket\nwhich had been given to him, and with his head and back and arms\nreposing on the cushions, he stretched himself out on the couch until\nmorning. When he opened his eyes, a ray of sunshine was gliding through\nthe opening above. Still he did not leave the sofa. He felt warm, and\nlay thinking as he gazed around him. He bethought himself that he would\nnever again have such a place to wash in. The washstand particularly\ninterested him. It was by no means hard, he thought, to keep oneself\nspruce when one had so many little pots and phials at one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disposal.\nThis made him think bitterly of his own life of privation. The idea\noccurred to him that perhaps he had been on the wrong track. There\nis nothing to be gained by associating with beggars. He ought to have\nplayed the scamp; he should have acted in concert with the Rougons.\n\nThen, however, he rejected this idea. The Rougons were villains who had\nrobbed him. But the warmth and softness of the sofa, continued to work\nupon his feelings, and fill him with vague regrets. After all, the\ninsurgents were abandoning him, and allowing themselves to be beaten\nlike idiots. Eventually he came to the conclusion that the Republic was\nmere dupery. Those Rougons were lucky! And he recalled his own bootless\nwickedness and underhand intrigues. Not one member of the family had\never been on his side; neither Aristide, nor Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother, nor\nSilvere himself, who was a fool to grow so enthusiastic about the\nRepublic and would never do any good for himself. Then Macquart\nreflected that his wife was dead, that his children had left him, and\nthat he would die alone, like a dog in some wretched corner, without a\ncopper to bless himself with. Decidedly, he ought to have sold himself\nto the reactionary party. Pondering in this fashion, he eyed the\nwashstand, feeling a strong inclination to go and wash his hands with a\ncertain powder soap which he saw in a glass jar. Like all lazy fellows\nwho live upon their wives or children, he had foppish tastes. Although\nhe wore patched trousers, he liked to inundate himself with aromatic\noil. He spent hours with his barber, who talked politics, and brushed\nhis hair for him between their discussions. So, at last, the temptation\nbecame too strong, and Macquart installed himself before the washstand.\nHe washed his hands and face, dressed his hair, perfumed himself, in\nfact went through a complete toilet. He made use in turn of all the\nbottles, all the various soaps and powders; but his greatest pleasure\nwas to dry his hands with the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s towels, which were so soft and\nthick. He buried his wet face in them, and inhaled, with delight, all\nthe odour of wealth. Then, having pomaded himself, and smelling sweetly\nfrom head to foot, he once more stretched himself on the sofa, feeling\nquite youthful again, and disposed to the most conciliatory thoughts. He\nfelt yet greater contempt for the Republic since he had dipped his nose\ninto Monsieur Garconnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s phials. The idea occurred to him that there\nwas, perhaps, still time for him to make peace with his brother. He\nwondered what he might well ask in return for playing the traitor. His\nrancour against the Rougons still gnawed at his heart; but he was in one\nof those moods when, lying on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back in silence, one is apt to admit\nstern facts, and scold oneself for neglecting to feather a comfortable\nnest in which one may wallow in slothful ease, even at the cost of\nrelinquishing one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most cherished animosities. Towards evening Antoine\ndetermined to send for his brother on the following day. But when, in\nthe morning, he saw Felicite enter the room he understood that his aid\nwas wanted, so he remained on his guard.\n\nThe negotiations were long and full of pitfalls, being conducted on\neither side with infinite skill. At first they both indulged in vague\ncomplaints, then Felicite, who was surprised to find Macquart almost\npolite, after the violent manner in which he had behaved at her house on\nthe Sunday evening, assumed a tone of gentle reproach. She deplored\nthe hatred which severed their families. But, in truth, he had so\ncalumniated his brother, and manifested such bitter animosity towards\nhim, that he had made poor Rougon quite lose his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, dash it, my brother has never behaved like a brother to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Macquart replied, with restrained violence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHas he ever given me\nany assistance? He would have let me die in my hovel! When he behaved\ndifferently towards me--you remember, at the time he gave me two hundred\nfrancs--I am sure no one can reproach me with having said a single\nunpleasant word about him. I said everywhere that he was a very\ngood-hearted fellow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis clearly signified: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you had continued to supply me with money,\nI should have been very pleasant towards you, and would have helped you,\ninstead of fighting against you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your own fault. You ought to have\nbought me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite understood this so well that she replied: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know you have\naccused us of being hard upon you, because you imagine we are in\ncomfortable circumstances; but you are mistaken, my dear brother; we are\npoor people; we have never been able to act towards you as our hearts\nwould have desired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She hesitated a moment, and then continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it\nwere absolutely necessary in some serious contingency, we might perhaps\nbe able to make a sacrifice; but, truly, we are very poor, very poor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart pricked up his ears. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought. Then, without\nappearing to understand his sister-in-law\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indirect offer, he detailed\nthe wretchedness of his life in a doleful manner, and spoke of his\nwife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death and his children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flight. Felicite, on her side, referred\nto the crisis through which the country was passing, and declared that\nthe Republic had completely ruined them. Then from word to word she\nbegan to bemoan the exigencies of a situation which compelled one\nbrother to imprison another. How their hearts would bleed if justice\nrefused to release its prey! And finally she let slip the word\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cgalleys!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah! I defy you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Macquart calmly.\n\nBut she hastily exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! I would rather redeem the honour of the\nfamily with my own blood. I tell you all this to show you that we shall\nnot abandon you. I have come to give you the means of effecting your\nescape, my dear Antoine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey gazed at each other for a moment, sounding each other with a look,\nbefore engaging in the contest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnconditionally?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, at length.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout any condition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied.\n\nThen she sat down beside him on the sofa, and continued, in a determined\nvoice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd even, before crossing the frontier, if you want to earn a\nthousand-franc note, I can put you in the way of doing so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was another pause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all above board I shall have no objection,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Antoine muttered,\napparently reflecting. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to mix myself up with your\nunderhand dealings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there are no underhand dealings about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite resumed,\nsmiling at the old rascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scruples. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing can be more simple: you\nwill presently leave this room, and go and conceal yourself in your\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, and this evening you can assemble your friends and come\nand seize the town-hall again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart did not conceal his extreme surprise. He did not understand it\nat all.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you were victorious.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got time now to tell you all about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old woman\nreplied, somewhat impatiently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you accept or not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, no; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept--I want to think it over. It would be very\nstupid of me to risk a possible fortune for a thousand francs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite rose. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust as you like my dear fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, coldly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to realise the position you are in. You came to my house and\ntreated me as though I were a mere outcast; and then, when I am kind\nenough to hold out a hand to you in the hole into which you have\nstupidly let yourself fall, you stand on ceremony, and refuse to be\nrescued. Well, then, stay here, wait till the authorities come back. As\nfor me, I wash my hands of the whole business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith these words she reached the door.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut give me some explanations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he implored. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t strike a bargain\nwith you in perfect ignorance of everything. For two days past I have\nbeen quite in the dark as to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on. How do I know that you are\nnot cheating me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah! you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a simpleton,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Felicite, who had retraced her steps\nat Antoine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doleful appeal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are very foolish not to trust yourself\nimplicitly to us. A thousand francs! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fine sum, a sum that one\nwould only risk in a winning cause. I advise you to accept.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe still hesitated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut when we want to seize the place, shall we be allowed to enter\nquietly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with a smile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere will perhaps be a\nshot or two fired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at her fixedly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, but I say, little woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed in a hoarse voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intend, do you, to have a bullet lodged in my head?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite blushed. She was, in fact, just thinking that they would be\nrendered a great service, if, during the attack on the town-hall, a\nbullet should rid them of Antoine. It would be a gain of a thousand\nfrancs, besides all the rest. So she muttered with irritation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat an\nidea! Really, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abominable to think such things!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, suddenly calming down, she added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you accept? You understand now, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart had understood perfectly. It was an ambush that they were\nproposing to him. He did not perceive the reasons or the consequences\nof it, and this was what induced him to haggle. After speaking of the\nRepublic as though it were a mistress whom, to his great grief, he could\nno longer love, he recapitulated the risks which he would have to run,\nand finished by asking for two thousand francs. But Felicite abided\nby her original offer. They debated the matter until she promised to\nprocure him, on his return to France, some post in which he would\nhave nothing to do, and which would pay him well. The bargain was then\nconcluded. She made him don the uniform she had brought with her. He\nwas to betake himself quietly to aunt Dide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and afterwards, towards\nmidnight, assemble all the Republicans he could in the neighbourhood of\nthe town-hall, telling them that the municipal offices were unguarded,\nand that they had only to push open the door to take possession of them.\nAntoine then asked for earnest money, and received two hundred francs.\nFelicite undertook to pay the remaining eight hundred on the following\nday. The Rougons were risking the last sum they had at their disposal.\n\nWhen Felicite had gone downstairs, she remained on the square for a\nmoment to watch Macquart go out. He passed the guard-house, quietly\nblowing his nose. He had previously broken the skylight in the\ndressing-room, to make it appear that he had escaped that way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all arranged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite said to her husband, when she returned\nhome. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be at midnight. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter to me at all now. I\nshould like to see them all shot. How they slandered us yesterday in the\nstreet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was rather silly of you to hesitate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Pierre, who was\nshaving. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery one would do the same in our place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat morning--it was a Wednesday--he was particularly careful about his\ntoilet. His wife combed his hair and tied his cravat, turning him about\nlike a child going to a distribution of prizes. And when he was ready,\nshe examined him, declared that he looked very nice, and that he would\nmake a very good figure in the midst of the serious events that were\npreparing. His big pale face wore an expression of grave dignity and\nheroic determination. She accompanied him to the first landing, giving\nhim her last advice: he was not to depart in any way from his courageous\ndemeanour, however great the panic might be; he was to have the gates\nclosed more hermetically than ever, and leave the town in agonies of\nterror within its ramparts; it would be all the better if he were to\nappear the only one willing to die for the cause of order.\n\nWhat a day it was! The Rougons still speak of it as of a glorious and\ndecisive battle. Pierre went straight to the town-hall, heedless of the\nlooks or words that greeted him on his way. He installed himself there\nin magisterial fashion, like a man who did not intend to quit the place,\nwhatever might happen. And he simply sent a note to Roudier, to advise\nhim that he was resuming authority.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep watch at the gates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, knowing that these lines might\nbecome public: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI myself will watch over the town and ensure the\nsecurity of life and property. It is at the moment when evil passions\nreappear and threaten to prevail that good citizens should endeavour to\nstifle them, even at the peril of their lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The style, and the very\nerrors in spelling, made this note--the brevity of which suggested the\nlaconic style of the ancients--appear all the more heroic. Not one of\nthe gentlemen of the Provisional Commission put in an appearance. The\nlast two who had hitherto remained faithful, and Granoux himself,\neven, prudently stopped at home. Thus Rougon was the only member of the\nCommission who remained at his post, in his presidential arm-chair, all\nthe others having vanished as the panic increased. He did not even\ndeign to issue an order summoning them to attend. He was there, and that\nsufficed, a sublime spectacle, which a local journal depicted later on\nin a sentence: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCourage giving the hand to duty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDuring the whole morning Pierre was seen animating the town-hall with\nhis goings and comings. He was absolutely alone in the large, empty\nbuilding, whose lofty halls reechoed with the noise of his heels. All\nthe doors were left open. He made an ostentatious show of his presidency\nover a non-existent council in the midst of this desert, and appeared\nso deeply impressed with the responsibility of his mission that the\ndoorkeeper, meeting him two or three times in the passages, bowed to him\nwith an air of mingled surprise and respect. He was seen, too, at every\nwindow, and, in spite of the bitter cold, he appeared several times\non the balcony with bundles of papers in his hand, like a busy man\nattending to important despatches.\n\nThen, towards noon, he passed through the town and visited the\nguard-houses, speaking of a possible attack, and letting it be\nunderstood, that the insurgents were not far off; but he relied, he\nsaid, on the courage of the brave national guards. If necessary they\nmust be ready to die to the last man for the defence of the good cause.\nWhen he returned from this round, slowly and solemnly, after the manner\nof a hero who has set the affairs of his country in order, and now only\nawaits death, he observed signs of perfect stupor along his path; the\npeople promenading in the Cours, the incorrigible little householders,\nwhom no catastrophe would have prevented from coming at certain hours\nto bask in the sun, looked at him in amazement, as if they did not\nrecognize him, and could not believe that one of their own set, a former\noil-dealer, should have the boldness to face a whole army.\n\nIn the town the anxiety was at its height. The insurrectionists were\nexpected every moment. The rumour of Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s escape was commented\nupon in a most alarming manner. It was asserted that he had been rescued\nby his friends, the Reds, and that he was only waiting for nighttime in\norder to fall upon the inhabitants and set fire to the four corners of\nthe town. Plassans, closed in and terror-stricken, gnawing at its own\nvitals within its prison-like walls, no longer knew what to imagine in\norder to frighten itself. The Republicans, in the face of Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbold demeanour, felt for a moment distrustful. As for the new\ntown--the lawyers and retired tradespeople who had denounced the yellow\ndrawing-room on the previous evening--they were so surprised that\nthey dared not again openly attack such a valiant man. They contented\nthemselves with saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was madness to brave victorious insurgents\nlike that, and such useless heroism would bring the greatest misfortunes\nupon Plassans.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, at about three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, they organised a\ndeputation. Pierre, though he was burning with desire to make a display\nof his devotion before his fellow-citizens, had not ventured to reckon\nupon such a fine opportunity.\n\nHe spoke sublimely. It was in the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private room that the\npresident of the Provisional Commission received the deputation from the\nnew town. The gentlemen of the deputation, after paying homage to his\npatriotism, besought him to forego all resistance. But he, in a loud\nvoice, talked of duty, of his country, of order, of liberty, and various\nother things. Moreover, he did not wish to compel any one to imitate\nhim; he was simply discharging a duty which his conscience and his heart\ndictated to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, gentlemen, I am alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said in conclusion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take\nall the responsibility, so that nobody but myself may be compromised.\nAnd if a victim is required I willingly offer myself; I wish to\nsacrifice my own life for the safety of the inhabitants.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA notary, the wiseacre of the party, remarked that he was running to\ncertain death.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed solemnly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am prepared!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe gentlemen looked at each other. Those words \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am prepared!\u00e2\u0080\u009d filled\nthem with admiration. Decidedly this man was a brave fellow. The notary\nimplored him to call in the aid of the gendarmes; but he replied that\nthe blood of those brave soldiers was precious, and he would not have\nit shed, except in the last extremity. The deputation slowly withdrew,\nfeeling deeply moved. An hour afterwards, Plassans was speaking of\nRougon as of a hero; the most cowardly called him \u00e2\u0080\u009can old fool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTowards evening, Rougon was much surprised to see Granoux hasten to\nhim. The old almond-dealer threw himself in his arms, calling him\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and declaring that he would die with him. The words \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nprepared!\u00e2\u0080\u009d which had just been reported to him by his maid-servant,\nwho had heard it at the greengrocer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, had made him quite enthusiastic.\nThere was charming naivete in the nature of this grotesque, timorous\nold man. Pierre kept him with him, thinking that he would not be of\nmuch consequence. He was even touched by the poor fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devotion, and\nresolved to have him publicly complimented by the prefect, in order to\nrouse the envy of the other citizens who had so cowardly abandoned him.\nAnd so both of them awaited the night in the deserted building.\n\nAt the same time Aristide was striding about at home in an uneasy\nmanner. Vuillet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s article had astonished him. His father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demeanour\nstupefied him. He had just caught sight of him at the window, in a white\ncravat and black frock-coat, so calm at the approach of danger that all\nhis ideas were upset. Yet the insurgents were coming back triumphant,\nthat was the belief of the whole town. But Aristide felt some doubts\non the point; he had suspicions of some lugubrious farce. As he did not\ndare to present himself at his parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 house, he sent his wife thither.\nAnd when Angele returned, she said to him, in her drawling voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour\nmother expects you; she is not angry at all, she seems rather to be\nmaking fun of you. She told me several times that you could just put\nyour sling back in your pocket.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAristide felt terribly vexed. However, he ran to the Rue de la Banne,\nprepared to make the most humble submission. His mother was content\nto receive him with scornful laughter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! my poor fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certainly not very shrewd.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what can one do in a hole like Plassans!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he angrily retorted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn\nmy word of honour, I am becoming a fool here. No news, and everybody\nshivering! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what it is to be shut up in these villainous ramparts.\nAh! If I had only been able to follow Eugene to Paris!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, seeing that his mother was still smiling, he added bitterly:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been very kind to me, mother. I know many things, I do. My\nbrother kept you informed of what was going on, and you have never given\nme the faintest hint that might have been useful to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know that, do you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Felicite, becoming serious and\ndistrustful. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not so foolish as I thought, then. Do you\nopen letters like some one of my acquaintance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; but I listen at doors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Aristide replied, with great assurance.\n\nThis frankness did not displease the old woman. She began to smile\nagain, and asked more softly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, you blockhead, how is it you\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rally to us sooner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young man said, with some embarrassment.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much confidence in you. You received such idiots: my\nfather-in-law, Granoux, and the others!--And then, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to go\ntoo far. . . .\u00e2\u0080\u009d He hesitated, and then resumed, with some uneasiness:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo-day you are at least quite sure of the success of the Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat,\naren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Felicite, wounded by her son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doubts; \u00e2\u0080\u009cno, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure of\nanything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd yet you sent word to say that I was to take off my sling!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; because all the gentlemen are laughing at you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAristide remained stock still, apparently contemplating one of the\nflowers of the orange-coloured wall-paper. And his mother felt sudden\nimpatience as she saw him hesitating thus.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come back again to my former opinion; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nnot very shrewd. And you think you ought to have had Eugene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letters\nto read? Why, my poor fellow you would have spoilt everything, with\nyour perpetual vacillation. You never can make up your mind. You are\nhesitating now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hesitate?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he interrupted, giving his mother a cold, keen glance.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! well, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know me. I would set the whole town on fire if it\nwere necessary, and I wanted to warm my feet. But, understand me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nno desire to take the wrong road! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired of eating hard bread, and I\nhope to play fortune a trick. But I only play for certainties.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke these words so sharply, with such a keen longing for success,\nthat his mother recognised the cry of her own blood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour father is very brave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed with a sneer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a fine look on\nhim! He reminded me of Leonidas at Thermopylae. Is it you, mother, who\nhave made him cut this figure?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he added cheerfully, with a gesture of determination: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, so much\nthe worse! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a Bonapartist! Father is not the man to risk the chance\nof being killed unless it pays him well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re quite right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his mother replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say anything; but\nto-morrow you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe did not press her, but swore that she would soon have reason to be\nproud of him; and then he took his departure, while Felicite, feeling\nher old preference reviving, said to herself at the window, as she\nwatched him going off, that he had the devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own wit, that she would\nnever have had sufficient courage to let him leave without setting him\nin the right path.\n\nAnd now for the third time a night full of anguish fell upon Plassans.\nThe unhappy town was almost at its death-rattle. The citizens hastened\nhome and barricaded their doors with a great clattering of iron bolts\nand bars. The general feeling seemed to be that, by the morrow, Plassans\nwould no longer exist, that it would either be swallowed up by the earth\nor would evaporate in the atmosphere. When Rougon went home to dine, he\nfound the streets completely deserted. This desolation made him sad and\nmelancholy. As a result of this, when he had finished his meal, he\nfelt some slight misgivings, and asked his wife if it were necessary to\nfollow up the insurrection that Macquart was preparing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody will run us down now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should have seen those\ngentlemen of the new town, how they bowed to me! It seems to me quite\nunnecessary now to kill anybody--eh? What do you think? We shall feather\nour nest without that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! what a nerveless fellow you are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite cried angrily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was\nyour own idea to do it, and now you back out! I tell you that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nnever do anything without me! Go then, go your own way. Do you think the\nRepublicans would spare you if they got hold of you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRougon went back to the town-hall, and prepared for the ambush. Granoux\nwas very useful to him. He despatched him with orders to the different\nposts guarding the ramparts. The national guards were to repair to the\ntown-hall in small detachments, as secretly as possible. Roudier, that\nbourgeois who was quite out of his element in the provinces, and who\nwould have spoilt the whole affair with his humanitarian preaching, was\nnot even informed of it. Towards eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, the court-yard of the\ntown-hall was full of national guards. Then Rougon frightened them; he\ntold them that the Republicans still remaining in Plassans were about\nto attempt a desperate _coup de main_, and plumed himself on having been\nwarned in time by his secret police. When he had pictured the bloody\nmassacre which would overtake the town, should these wretches get the\nupper hand, he ordered his men to cease speaking, and extinguish all\nlights. He took a gun himself. Ever since the morning he had been living\nas in a dream; he no longer knew himself; he felt Felicite behind him.\nThe crisis of the previous night had thrown him into her hands, and he\nwould have allowed himself to be hanged, thinking: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does not matter,\nmy wife will come and cut me down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To augment the tumult, and prolong\nthe terror of the slumbering town, he begged Granoux to repair to the\ncathedral and have the tocsin rung at the first shots he might hear. The\nmarquis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name would open the beadle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door. And then, in darkness and\ndismal silence, the national guards waited in the yard, in a terrible\nstate of anxiety, their eyes fixed on the porch, eager to fire, as\nthough they were lying in wait for a pack of wolves.\n\nIn the meantime, Macquart had spent the day at aunt Dide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house.\nStretching himself on the old coffer, and lamenting the loss of Monsieur\nGarconnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sofa, he had several times felt a mad inclination to break\ninto his two hundred francs at some neighbouring cafe. This money was\nburning a hole in his waistcoat pocket; however, he whiled away his time\nby spending it in imagination. His mother moved about, in her stiff,\nautomatic way, as if she were not even aware of his presence. During the\nlast few days her children had been coming to her rather frequently,\nin a state of pallor and desperation, but she departed neither from her\ntaciturnity, nor her stiff, lifeless expression. She knew nothing of\nthe fears which were throwing the pent-up town topsy-turvy, she was a\nthousand leagues away from Plassans, soaring into the one constant\nfixed idea which imparted such a blank stare to her eyes. Now and again,\nhowever, at this particular moment, some feeling of uneasiness, some\nhuman anxiety, occasionally made her blink. Antoine, unable to resist\nthe temptation of having something nice to eat, sent her to get a roast\nchicken from an eating-house in the Faubourg. When it was set on the\ntable: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often eat fowl, do you? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nonly for those who work, and know how to manage their affairs. As for\nyou, you always squandered everything. I bet you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re giving all your\nsavings to that little hypocrite, Silvere. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a mistress, the sly\nfellow. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve a hoard of money hidden in some corner, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ease you\nof it nicely some day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart was in a jesting mood, glowing with wild exultation. The money\nhe had in his pocket, the treachery he was preparing, the conviction\nthat he had sold himself at a good price--all filled him with the\nself-satisfaction characteristic of vicious people who naturally\nbecame merry and scornful amidst their evil practices. Of all his talk,\nhowever, aunt Dide only heard Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you seen him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, opening her lips at last.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho? Silvere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Antoine replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was walking about among the\ninsurgents with a tall red girl on his arm. It will serve him right if\nhe gets into trouble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe grandmother looked at him fixedly, then, in a solemn voice,\ninquired: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEh! Why, he shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so stupid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed Macquart, feeling somewhat\nembarrassed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t risk their necks for the sake of ideas. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nsettled my own little business. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m no fool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut aunt Dide was no longer listening to him. She was murmuring: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had\nhis hands covered with blood. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll kill him like the other one. His\nuncles will send the gendarmes after him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you muttering there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked her son, as he finished picking\nthe bones of the chicken. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know I like people to accuse me to\nmy face. If I have sometimes talked to the little fellow about the\nRepublic, it was only to bring him round to a more reasonable way of\nthinking. He was dotty. I love liberty myself, but it mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t degenerate\ninto license. And as for Rougon, I esteem him. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a man of courage and\ncommon-sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had the gun, hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted aunt Dide, whose wandering mind\nseemed to be following Silvere far away along the high road.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe gun? Ah! yes; Macquart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s carbine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Antoine, after casting\na glance at the mantel-shelf, where the fire-arm was usually hung. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nfancy I saw it in his hands. A fine instrument to scour the country\nwith, when one has a girl on one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm. What a fool!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he thought he might as well indulge in a few coarse jokes. Aunt\nDide had begun to bustle about the room again. She did not say a word.\nTowards the evening Antoine went out, after putting on a blouse, and\npulling over his eyes a big cap which his mother had bought for him.\nHe returned into the town in the same manner as he had quitted it, by\nrelating some nonsensical story to the national guards who were on duty\nat the Rome Gate. Then he made his way to the old quarter, where he\ncrept from house to house in a mysterious manner. All the Republicans of\nadvanced views, all the members of the brotherhood who had not followed\nthe insurrectionary army, met in an obscure inn, where Macquart had made\nan appointment with them. When about fifty men were assembled, he made a\nspeech, in which he spoke of personal vengeance that must be wreaked,\nof a victory that must be gained, and of a disgraceful yoke that must be\nthrown off. And he ended by undertaking to deliver the town-hall over\nto them in ten minutes. He had just left it, it was quite unguarded,\nhe said, and the red flag would wave over it that very night if they so\ndesired. The workmen deliberated. At that moment the reaction seemed to\nbe in its death throes. The insurgents were virtually at the gates of\nthe town. It would therefore be more honourable to make an effort to\nregain power without awaiting their return, so as to be able to receive\nthem as brothers, with the gates wide open, and the streets and squares\nadorned with flags. Moreover, none of those present distrusted Macquart.\nHis hatred of the Rougons, the personal vengeance of which he spoke,\ncould be taken as guaranteeing his loyalty. It was arranged that each of\nthem who was a sportsman and had a gun at home should fetch it, and\nthat the band should assemble at midnight in the neighbourhood of\nthe town-hall. A question of detail very nearly put an end to their\nplans--they had no bullets; however, they decided to load their weapons\nwith small shot: and even that seemed unnecessary, as they were told\nthat they would meet with no resistance.\n\nOnce more Plassans beheld a band of armed men filing along close to the\nhouses, in the quiet moonlight. When the band was assembled in front of\nthe town-hall, Macquart, while keeping a sharp look-out, boldly advanced\nto the building. He knocked, and when the door-keeper, who had learnt\nhis lesson, asked what was wanted, he uttered such terrible threats,\nthat the man, feigning fright, made haste to open the door. Both leaves\nof it swung back slowly, and the porch then lay open and empty before\nthem, while Macquart shouted in a loud voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on, my friends!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat was the signal. He himself quickly jumped aside, and as the\nRepublicans rushed in, there came, from the darkness of the yard, a\nstream of fire and a hail of bullets, which swept through the gaping\nporch with a roar as of thunder. The doorway vomited death. The\nnational guards, exasperated by their long wait, eager to shake off the\ndiscomfort weighing upon them in that dismal court-yard, had fired a\nvolley with feverish haste. The flash of the firing was so bright, that,\nthrough the yellow gleams Macquart distinctly saw Rougon taking aim. He\nfancied that his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gun was deliberately levelled at himself,\nand he recalled Felicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blush, and made his escape, muttering: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\ntricks! The rascal would kill me. He owes me eight hundred francs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the meantime a loud howl had arisen amid the darkness. The surprised\nRepublicans shouted treachery, and fired in their turn. A national guard\nfell under the porch. But the Republicans, on their side, had three\ndead. They took to flight, stumbling over the corpses, stricken with\npanic, and shouting through the quiet lanes: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur brothers are being\nmurdered!\u00e2\u0080\u009d in despairing voices which found no echo. Thereupon the\ndefenders of order, having had time to reload their weapons, rushed into\nthe empty square, firing at every street corner, wherever the darkness\nof a door, the shadow of a lamp-post, or the jutting of a stone made\nthem fancy they saw an insurgent. In this wise they remained there ten\nminutes, firing into space.\n\nThe affray had burst over the slumbering town like a thunderclap. The\ninhabitants in the neighbouring streets, roused from sleep by this\nterrible fusillade, sat up in bed, their teeth chattering with fright.\nNothing in the world would have induced them to poke their noses out of\nthe window. And slowly, athwart the air, in which the shots had suddenly\nresounded, one of the cathedral bells began to ring the tocsin with so\nirregular, so strange a rhythm, that one might have thought the noise to\nbe the hammering of an anvil or the echoes of a colossal kettle struck\nby a child in a fit of passion. This howling bell, whose sound the\ncitizens did not recognise, terrified them yet more than the reports of\nthe fire-arms had done; and there were some who thought they heard an\nendless train of artillery rumbling over the paving-stones. They lay\ndown again and buried themselves beneath their blankets, as if they\nwould have incurred some danger by still sitting up in bed in their\nclosely-fastened rooms. With their sheets drawn up to their chins, they\nheld their breath, and made themselves as small as possible, while their\nwives, by their side, almost fainted with terror as they buried their\nheads among the pillows.\n\nThe national guards who had remained at the ramparts had also heard the\nshots, and thinking that the insurgents had entered by means of some\nsubterranean passage, they ran up helter-skelter, in groups of five\nor six, disturbing the silence of the streets with the tumult of their\nexcited rush. Roudier was one of the first to arrive. However, Rougon\nsent them all back to their posts, after reprimanding them severely\nfor abandoning the gates of the town. Thrown into consternation by\nthis reproach--for in their panic, they had, in fact, left the gates\nabsolutely defenceless--they again set off at a gallop, hurrying through\nthe streets with still more frightful uproar. Plassans might well have\nthought that an infuriated army was crossing it in all directions. The\nfusillade, the tocsin, the marches and countermarches of the national\nguards, the weapons which were being dragged along like clubs, the\nterrified cries in the darkness, all produced a deafening tumult,\nsuch as might break forth in a town taken by assault and given over\nto plunder. It was the final blow of the unfortunate inhabitants, who\nreally believed that the insurgents had arrived. They had, indeed, said\nthat it would be their last night--that Plassans would be swallowed up\nin the earth, or would evaporate into smoke before daybreak; and now,\nlying in their beds, they awaited the catastrophe in the most abject\nterror, fancying at times that their houses were already tottering.\n\nMeantime Granoux still rang the tocsin. When, in other respects, silence\nhad again fallen upon the town, the mournfulness of that ringing became\nintolerable. Rougon, who was in a high fever, felt exasperated by its\ndistant wailing. He hastened to the cathedral, and found the door open.\nThe beadle was on the threshold.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite enough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted to the man; \u00e2\u0080\u009canybody would think\nthere was some one crying; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite unbearable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t me, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the beadle in a distressed manner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nMonsieur Granoux, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone up into the steeple. I must tell you that I\nremoved the clapper of the bell, by his Reverence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s order, precisely\nto prevent the tocsin from being sounded. But Monsieur Granoux wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlisten to reason. He climbed up, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve no idea what he can be making\nthat noise with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThereupon Rougon hastily ascended the staircase which led to the bells,\nshouting: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat will do! That will do! For goodness\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake leave off!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen he had reached the top he caught sight of Granoux, by the light\nof the moon which glided through an embrasure; the ex almond dealer was\nstanding there hatless, and dealing furious blows with a heavy hammer.\nHe did so with a right good will. He first threw himself back, then took\na spring, and finally fell upon the sonorous bronze as if he wanted\nto crack it. One might have thought he was a blacksmith striking hot\niron--but a frock-coated blacksmith, short and bald, working in a wild\nand awkward way.\n\nSurprise kept Rougon motionless for a moment at the sight of this\nfrantic bourgeois thus belabouring the bell in the moonlight. Then\nhe understood the kettle-like clang which this strange ringer had\ndisseminated over the town. He shouted to him to stop, but Granoux did\nnot hear. Rougon was obliged to take hold of his frock-coat, and then\nthe other recognising him, exclaimed in a triumphant voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nheard it. At first I tried to knock the bell with my fists, but that\nhurt me. Fortunately I found this hammer. Just a few more blows, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever, Rougon dragged him away. Granoux was radiant. He wiped his\nforehead, and made his companion promise to let everybody know in the\nmorning that he had produced all that noise with a mere hammer. What\nan achievement, and what a position of importance that furious ringing\nwould confer upon him!\n\nTowards morning, Rougon bethought himself of reassuring Felicite. In\naccordance with his orders, the national guards had shut themselves up\nin the town-hall. He had forbidden them to remove the corpses, under the\npretext that it was necessary to give the populace of the old quarter a\nlesson. And as, while hastening to the Rue de la Banne, he passed over\nthe square, on which the moon was no longer shining, he inadvertently\nstepped on the clenched hand of a corpse that lay beside the footpath.\nAt this he almost fell. That soft hand, which yielded beneath his\nheel, brought him an indefinable sensation of disgust and horror. And\nthereupon he hastened at full speed along the deserted streets, fancying\nthat a bloody fist was pursuing him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are four of them on the ground,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as he entered his\nhouse.\n\nHe and his wife looked at one another as though they were astonished at\ntheir crime.\n\nThe lamplight imparted the hue of yellow wax to their pale faces.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you left them there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Felicite; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey must be found there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course! I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pick them up. They are lying on their backs. I\nstepped on something soft----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he looked at his boot; its heel was covered with blood. While he\nwas putting on a pair of shoes, Felicite resumed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell! so much the better! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over now. People won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be inclined to\nrepeat that you only fire at mirrors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe fusillade which the Rougons had planned in order that they might\nbe finally recognised as the saviours of Plassans, brought the whole\nterrified and grateful town to their feet. The day broke mournfully\nwith the grey melancholy of a winter-morning. The inhabitants, hearing\nnothing further, ventured forth, weary of trembling beneath their\nsheets. At first some ten or fifteen appeared. Later on, when a rumour\nspread that the insurgents had taken flight, leaving their dead in\nevery gutter, Plassans rose in a body and descended upon the town-hall.\nThroughout the morning people strolled inquisitively round the four\ncorpses. They were horribly mutilated, particularly one, which had three\nbullets in the head. But the most horrible to look upon was the body\nof a national guard, who had fallen under the porch; he had received a\ncharge of the small shot, used by the Republicans in lieu of bullets,\nfull in the face; and blood oozed from his torn and riddled countenance.\nThe crowd feasted their eyes upon this horror, with the avidity for\nrevolting spectacles which is so characteristic of cowards. The national\nguard was freely recognised; he was the pork-butcher Dubruel, the man\nwhom Roudier had accused on the Monday morning of having fired with\nculpable eagerness. Of the three other corpses, two were journeymen\nhatters; the third was not identified. For a long while gaping groups\nremained shuddering in front of the red pools which stained the\npavement, often looking behind them with an air of mistrust, as though\nthat summary justice which had restored order during the night by force\nof arms, were, even now, watching and listening to them, ready to shoot\nthem down in their turn, unless they kissed with enthusiasm the hand\nthat had just rescued them from the demagogy.\n\nThe panic of the night further augmented the terrible effect produced\nin the morning by the sight of the four corpses. The true history of\nthe fusillade was never known. The firing of the combatants, Granoux\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhammering, the helter-skelter rush of the national guards through the\nstreets, had filled people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears with such terrifying sounds that most\nof them dreamed of a gigantic battle waged against countless enemies.\nWhen the victors, magnifying the number of their adversaries with\ninstinctive braggardism, spoke of about five hundred men, everybody\nprotested against such a low estimate. Some citizens asserted that they\nhad looked out of their windows and seen an immense stream of fugitives\npassing by for more than an hour. Moreover everybody had heard the\nbandits running about. Five hundred men would never have been able to\nrouse a whole town. It must have been an army, and a fine big army too,\nwhich the brave militia of Plassans had \u00e2\u0080\u009cdriven back into the ground.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n This phrase of their having been \u00e2\u0080\u009cdriven back into the ground,\u00e2\u0080\u009d first\nused by Rougon, struck people as being singularly appropriate, for the\nguards who were charged with the defence of the ramparts swore by all\nthat was holy that not a single man had entered or quitted the town,\na circumstance which tinged what had happened with mystery, even\nsuggesting the idea of horned demons who had vanished amidst flames, and\nthus fairly upsetting the minds of the multitude. It is true the guards\navoided all mention of their mad gallops; and so the more rational\ncitizens were inclined to believe that a band of insurgents had really\nentered the town either by a breach in the wall or some other channel.\nLater on, rumours of treachery were spread abroad, and people talked of\nan ambush. The cruel truth could no longer be concealed by the men whom\nMacquart had led to slaughter, but so much terror still prevailed,\nand the sight of blood had thrown so many cowards into the arms of the\nreactionary party, that these rumours were attributed to the rage of\nthe vanquished Republicans. It was asserted, on the other hand, that\nMacquart had been made prisoner by Rougon, who kept him in a damp cell,\nwhere he was letting him slowly die of starvation. This horrible tale\nmade people bow to the very ground whenever they encountered Rougon.\n\nThus it was that this grotesque personage, this pale, flabby,\ntun-bellied citizen became, in one night, a terrible captain, whom\nnobody dared to ridicule any more. He had steeped his foot in blood.\nThe inhabitants of the old quarter stood dumb with fright before the\ncorpses. But towards ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, when the respectable people of the new\ntown arrived, the whole square hummed with subdued chatter. People spoke\nof the other attack, of the seizure of the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, in which a\nmirror only had been wounded; but this time they no longer pooh-poohed\nRougon, they spoke of him with respectful dismay; he was indeed a hero,\na deliverer. The corpses, with open eyes, stared at those gentlemen, the\nlawyers and householders, who shuddered as they murmured that civil war\nhad many cruel necessities. The notary, the chief of the deputation\nsent to the town-hall on the previous evening, went from group to group,\nrecalling the proud words \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am prepared!\u00e2\u0080\u009d then used by the energetic\nman to whom the town owed its safety. There was a general feeling of\nhumiliation. Those who had railed most cruelly against the forty-one,\nthose, especially, who had referred to the Rougons as intriguers and\ncowards who merely fired shots in the air, were the first to speak of\ngranting a crown of laurels \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the noble citizen of whom Plassans would\nbe for ever proud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d For the pools of blood were drying on the pavement,\nand the corpses proclaimed to what a degree of audacity the party of\ndisorder, pillage, and murder had gone, and what an iron hand had been\nrequired to put down the insurrection.\n\nMoreover, the whole crowd was eager to congratulate Granoux, and shake\nhands with him. The story of the hammer had become known. By an innocent\nfalsehood, however, of which he himself soon became unconscious, he\nasserted that, having been the first to see the insurgents, he had set\nabout striking the bell, in order to sound the alarm, so that, but for\nhim, the national guards would have been massacred. This doubled his\nimportance. His achievement was declared prodigious. People spoke of him\nnow as \u00e2\u0080\u009cMonsieur Isidore, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know? the gentleman who sounded\nthe tocsin with a hammer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Although the sentence was somewhat lengthy,\nGranoux would willingly have accepted it as a title of nobility; and\nfrom that day forward he never heard the word \u00e2\u0080\u009chammer\u00e2\u0080\u009d pronounced\nwithout imagining it to be some delicate flattery.\n\nWhile the corpses were being removed, Aristide came to look at them. He\nexamined them on all sides, sniffing and looking inquisitively at\ntheir faces. His eyes were bright, and he had a sharp expression of\ncountenance. In order to see some wound the better he even lifted up the\nblouse of one corpse with the very hand which on the previous day had\nbeen suspended in a sling. This examination seemed to convince him and\nremove all doubt from his mind. He bit his lips, remained there for a\nmoment in silence, and then went off for the purpose of hastening the\nissue of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d for which he had written a most important\narticle. And as he hurried along beside the houses he recalled his\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will see to-morrow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Well, he had seen now; it was\nvery clever; it even frightened him somewhat.\n\nIn the meantime, Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s triumph was beginning to embarrass him. Alone\nin Monsieur Garconnet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, hearing the buzzing of the crowd, he\nbecame conscious of a strange feeling, which prevented him from showing\nhimself on the balcony. That blood, in which he had stepped, seemed to\nhave numbed his legs. He wondered what he should do until the evening.\nHis poor empty brain, upset by the events of the night, sought\ndesperately for some occupation, some order to give, or some measure to\nbe taken, which might afford him some distraction. But he could think\nabout nothing clearly. Whither was Felicite leading him? Was it really\nall finished now, or would he still have to kill somebody else? Then\nfear again assailed him, terrible doubts arose in his mind, and he\nalready saw the ramparts broken down on all sides by an avenging army\nof the Republicans, when a loud shout: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe insurgents! The insurgents!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n burst forth under the very windows of his room. At this he jumped up,\nand raising a curtain, saw the crowd rushing about the square in a state\nof terror. What a thunderbolt! In less than a second he pictured himself\nruined, plundered, and murdered; he cursed his wife, he cursed the whole\ntown. Then, as he looked behind him in a suspicious manner, seeking\nsome means of escape, he heard the mob break out into applause, uttering\nshouts of joy, making the very glass rattle with their wild\ndelight. Then he returned to the window; the women were waving their\nhandkerchiefs, and the men were embracing each other. There were some\namong them who joined hands and began to dance. Rougon stood there\nstupefied, unable to comprehend it all, and feeling his head swimming.\nThe big, deserted, silent building, in which he was alone, quite\nfrightened him.\n\nWhen he afterwards confessed his feelings to Felicite, he was unable to\nsay how long his torture had lasted. He only remembered that a noise of\nfootsteps, re-echoing through the vast halls, had roused him from his\nstupor. He expected to be attacked by men in blouses, armed with scythes\nand clubs, whereas it was the Municipal Commission which entered, quite\norderly and in evening dress, each member with a beaming countenance.\nNot one of them was absent. A piece of good news had simultaneously\ncured all these gentlemen. Granoux rushed into the arms of his dear\npresident.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe soldiers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stammered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe soldiers!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA regiment had, in fact, just arrived, under the command of Colonel\nMasson and Monsieur de Bleriot, prefect of the department. The\ngunbarrels which had been observed from the ramparts, far away in the\nplain, had at first suggested the approach of the insurgents. Rougon was\nso deeply moved on learning the truth, that two big tears rolled down\nhis cheeks. He was weeping, the great citizen! The Municipal Commission\nwatched those big tears with most respectful admiration. But Granoux\nagain threw himself on his friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck, crying:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! how glad I am! You know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a straightforward man. Well, we were\nall of us afraid; it is not so, gentlemen? You, alone, were great,\nbrave, sublime! What energy you must have had! I was just now saying to\nmy wife: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Rougon is a great man; he deserves to be decorated.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the gentlemen proposed to go and meet the prefect. For a moment\nRougon felt both stunned and suffocated; he was unable to believe\nin this sudden triumph, and stammered like a child. However, he drew\nbreath, and went downstairs with the quiet dignity suited to the\nsolemnity of the occasion. But the enthusiasm which greeted the\ncommission and its president outside the town-hall almost upset his\nmagisterial gravity afresh. His name sped through the crowd, accompanied\nthis time by the warmest eulogies. He heard everyone repeat Granoux\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\navowal, and treat him as a hero who had stood firm and resolute amidst\nuniversal panic. And, as far as the Sub-Prefecture, where the commission\nmet the prefect, he drank his fill of popularity and glory.\n\nMonsieur de Bleriot and Colonel Masson had entered the town alone,\nleaving their troops encamped on the Lyons road. They had lost\nconsiderable time through a misunderstanding as to the direction taken\nby the insurgents. Now, however, they knew the latter were at Orcheres;\nand it would only be necessary to stop an hour at Plassans, just\nsufficient time to reassure the population and publish the cruel\nordinances which decreed the sequestration of the insurgents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 property,\nand death to every individual who might be taken with arms in his\nhands. Colonel Masson smiled when, in accordance with the orders of the\ncommander of the national guards, the bolts of the Rome Gate were drawn\nback with a great rattling of rusty old iron. The detachment on duty\nthere accompanied the prefect and the colonel as a guard of honour.\nAs they traversed the Cours Sauvaire, Roudier related Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s epic\nachievements to the gentlemen--the three days of panic that had\nterminated with the brilliant victory of the previous night. When the\ntwo processions came face to face therefore, Monsieur de Bleriot quickly\nadvanced towards the president of the Commission, shook hands with him,\ncongratulated him, and begged him to continue to watch over the town\nuntil the return of the authorities. Rougon bowed, while the prefect,\nhaving reached the door of the Sub-Prefecture, where he wished to take\na brief rest, proclaimed in a loud voice that he would not forget to\nmention his brave and noble conduct in his report.\n\nIn the meantime, in spite of the bitter cold, everybody had come to\ntheir windows. Felicite, leaning forward at the risk of falling out,\nwas quite pale with joy. Aristide had just arrived with a number of the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which he had openly declared himself in favour of the\nCoup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat, which he welcomed \u00e2\u0080\u009cas the aurora of liberty in order and\nof order in liberty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He had also made a delicate allusion to the\nyellow drawing-room, acknowledging his errors, declaring that \u00e2\u0080\u009cyouth is\npresumptuous,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreat citizens say nothing, reflect in silence,\nand let insults pass by, in order to rise heroically when the day of\nstruggle comes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was particularly pleased with this sentence. His\nmother thought his article extremely well written. She kissed her dear\nchild, and placed him on her right hand. The Marquis de Carnavant, weary\nof incarcerating himself, and full of eager curiosity, had likewise come\nto see her, and stood on her left, leaning on the window rail.\n\nWhen Monsieur de Bleriot offered his hand to Rougon on the square below\nFelicite began to weep. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! see, see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to Aristide. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has\nshaken hands with him. Look! he is doing it again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And casting a glance\nat the windows, where groups of people were congregated, she added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\nwild they must be! Look at Monsieur Peirotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biting\nher handkerchief. And over there, the notary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, and Madame\nMassicot, and the Brunet family, what faces, eh? how angry they look!\nAh, indeed, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our turn now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe followed the scene which was being acted outside the Sub-Prefecture\nwith thrills of delight, which shook her ardent, grasshopper-like figure\nfrom head to foot. She interpreted the slightest gesture, invented words\nwhich she was unable to catch, and declared that Pierre bowed very well\nindeed. She was a little vexed when the prefect deigned to speak to poor\nGranoux, who was hovering about him fishing for a word of praise. No\ndoubt Monsieur de Bleriot already knew the story of the hammer, for the\nretired almond-dealer turned as red as a young girl, and seemed to\nbe saying that he had only done his duty. However, that which angered\nFelicite still more was her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excessive amiability in presenting\nVuillet to the authorities. Vuillet, it is true, pushed himself forward\namongst them, and Rougon was compelled to mention him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat a schemer!\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered Felicite. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe creeps in everywhere. How\nconfused my poor dear husband must be! See, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the colonel speaking\nto him. What can he be saying to him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! little one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the marquis replied with a touch of irony, \u00e2\u0080\u009che is\ncomplimenting him for having closed the gates so carefully.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy father has saved the town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Aristide retorted curtly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you seen\nthe corpses, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMonsieur de Carnavant did not answer. He withdrew from the window, and\nsat down in an arm-chair, shaking his head with an air of some disgust.\nAt that moment, the prefect having taken his departure, Rougon came\nupstairs and threw himself upon his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! my dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stammered.\n\nHe was unable to say more. Felicite made him kiss Aristide after telling\nhim of the superb article which the young man had inserted in the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pierre would have kissed the marquis as well, he was\ndeeply affected. However, his wife took him aside, and gave him Eugene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nletter which she had sealed up in an envelope again. She pretended that\nit had just been delivered. Pierre read it and then triumphantly held it\nout to her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a sorceress,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to her laughing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou guessed everything.\nWhat folly I should have committed without you! We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll manage our little\naffairs together now. Kiss me: you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a good woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe clasped her in his arms, while she discreetly exchanged a knowing\nsmile with the marquis.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIt was not until Sunday, the day after the massacre at Sainte-Roure,\nthat the troops passed through Plassans again. The prefect and the\ncolonel, whom Monsieur Garconnet had invited to dinner, once more\nentered the town alone. The soldiers went round the ramparts and\nencamped in the Faubourg, on the Nice road. Night was falling; the sky,\novercast since the morning, had a strange yellow tint, and illumined\nthe town with a murky light, similar to the copper-coloured glimmer\nof stormy weather. The reception of the troops by the inhabitants was\ntimid; the bloodstained soldiers, who passed by weary and silent, in\nthe yellow twilight, horrified the cleanly citizens promenading on\nthe Cours. They stepped out of the way whispering terrible stories of\nfusillades and revengeful reprisals which still live in the recollection\nof the region. The Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat terror was beginning to make itself felt,\nan overwhelming terror which kept the South in a state of tremor for\nmany a long month. Plassans, in its fear and hatred of the insurgents,\nhad welcomed the troops on their first arrival with enthusiasm; but now,\nat the appearance of that gloomy taciturn regiment, whose men were ready\nto fire at a word from their officers, the retired merchants and even\nthe notaries of the new town anxiously examined their consciences,\nasking if they had not committed some political peccadilloes which might\nbe thought deserving of a bullet.\n\nThe municipal authorities had returned on the previous evening in a\ncouple of carts hired at Sainte-Roure. Their unexpected entry was devoid\nof all triumphal display. Rougon surrendered the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm-chair\nwithout much regret. The game was over; and with feverish longing he now\nawaited the recompense for his devotion. On the Sunday--he had not hoped\nfor it until the following day--he received a letter from Eugene.\nSince the previous Thursday Felicite had taken care to send her son\nthe numbers of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGazette\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant\u00e2\u0080\u009d which, in special second\neditions had narrated the battle of the night and the arrival of the\nprefect at Plassans. Eugene now replied by return of post that the\nnomination of a receivership would soon be signed; but added that he\nwished to give them some good news immediately. He had obtained the\nribbon of the Legion of Honour for his father. Felicite wept with joy.\nHer husband decorated! Her proud dream had never gone as far as that.\nRougon, pale with delight, declared they must give a grand dinner that\nvery evening. He no longer thought of expense; he would have thrown his\nlast fifty francs out of the drawing-room windows in order to celebrate\nthat glorious day.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to his wife; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must invite Sicardot: he has annoyed\nme with that rosette of his for a long time! Then Granoux and Roudier;\nI shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be at all sorry to make them feel that it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t their purses\nthat will ever win them the cross. Vuillet is a skinflint, but the\ntriumph ought to be complete: invite him as well as the small fry. I was\nforgetting; you must go and call on the marquis in person; we will seat\nhim on your right; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look very well at our table. You know that\nMonsieur Garconnet is entertaining the colonel and the prefect. That is\nto make me understand that I am nobody now. But I can afford to laugh at\nhis mayoralty; it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring him in a sou! He has invited me, but\nI shall tell him that I also have some people coming. The others will\nlaugh on the wrong side of their mouths to-morrow. And let everything\nbe of the best. Have everything sent from the Hotel de Provence. We must\noutdo the mayor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dinner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite set to work. Pierre still felt some vague uneasiness amidst his\nrapture. The Coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat was going to pay his debts, his son Aristide\nhad repented of his faults, and he was at last freeing himself from\nMacquart; but he feared some folly on Pascal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part, and was especially\nanxious about the lot reserved for Silvere. Not that he felt the least\npity for the lad; he was simply afraid the matter of the gendarme might\ncome before the Assize Court. Ah! if only some discriminating bullet had\nmanaged to rid him of that young scoundrel! As his wife had pointed out\nto him in the morning, all obstacles had fallen away before him; the\nfamily which had dishonoured him had, at the last moment, worked for his\nelevation; his sons Eugene and Aristide, those spend-thrifts, the cost\nof whose college life he had so bitterly regretted, were at last paying\ninterest on the capital expended for their education. And yet the\nthought of that wretched Silvere must come to mar his hour of triumph!\n\nWhile Felicite was running about to prepare the dinner for the evening,\nPierre heard of the arrival of the troops and determined to go and make\ninquiries. Sicardot, whom he had questioned on his return, knew nothing;\nPascal must have remained to look after the wounded; as for Silvere, he\nhad not even been seen by the commander, who scarcely knew him. Rougon\ntherefore repaired to the Faubourg, intending to make inquiries there\nand at the same time pay Macquart the eight hundred francs which he had\njust succeeded in raising with great difficulty. However, when he found\nhimself in the crowded encampment, and from a distance saw the prisoners\nsitting in long files on the beams in the Aire Saint-Mittre, guarded by\nsoldiers gun in hand, he felt afraid of being compromised, and so slunk\noff to his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, with the intention of sending the old woman\nout to pick up some information.\n\nWhen he entered the hovel it was almost night. At first the only person\nhe saw there was Macquart smoking and drinking brandy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that you? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d muttered Antoine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m growing deuced\ncold here. Have you got the money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut Pierre did not reply. He had just perceived his son Pascal leaning\nover the bed. And thereupon he questioned him eagerly. The doctor,\nsurprised by his uneasiness, which he attributed to paternal affection,\ntold him that the soldiers had taken him and would have shot him, had\nit not been for the intervention of some honest fellow whom he did not\nknow. Saved by his profession of surgeon, he had returned to Plassans\nwith the troops. This greatly relieved Rougon. So there was yet another\nwho would not compromise him. He was evincing his delight by repeated\nhand-shakings, when Pascal concluded in a sorrowful voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nmake merry. I have just found my poor grandmother in a very dangerous\nstate. I brought her back this carbine, which she values very much; I\nfound her lying here, and she has not moved since.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were becoming accustomed to the dimness. In the fast\nfading light he saw aunt Dide stretched, rigid and seemingly lifeless,\nupon her bed. Her wretched frame, attacked by neurosis from the hour of\nbirth, was at length laid prostrate by a supreme shock. Her nerves had\nso to say consumed her blood. Moreover some cruel grief seemed to have\nsuddenly accelerated her slow wasting-away. Her pale nun-like face,\ndrawn and pinched by a life of gloom and cloister-like self-denial, was\nnow stained with red blotches. With convulsed features, eyes that glared\nterribly, and hands twisted and clenched, she lay at full length in her\nskirts, which failed to hide the sharp outlines of her scrawny limbs.\nExtended there with lips closely pressed she imparted to the dim room\nall the horror of a mute death-agony.\n\nRougon made a gesture of vexation. This heart-rending spectacle was very\ndistasteful to him. He had company coming to dinner in the evening, and\nit would be extremely inconvenient for him to have to appear mournful.\nHis mother was always doing something to bother him. She might just\nas well have chosen another day. However, he put on an appearance of\nperfect ease, as he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBah! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen her like that a\nhundred times. You must let her lie still; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only thing that does\nher any good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPascal shook his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, this fit isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the others,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nwhispered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have often studied her, and have never observed such\nsymptoms before. Just look at her eyes: there is a peculiar fluidity, a\npale brightness about them which causes me considerable uneasiness. And\nher face, how frightfully every muscle of it is distorted!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen bending over to observe her features more closely, he continued\nin a whisper, as though speaking to himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never seen such a\nface, excepting among people who have been murdered or have died from\nfright. She must have experienced some terrible shock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how did the attack begin?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rougon impatiently inquired, at a loss\nfor an excuse to leave the room.\n\nPascal did not know. Macquart, as he poured himself out another glass\nof brandy, explained that he had felt an inclination to drink a little\nCognac, and had sent her to fetch a bottle. She had not been long\nabsent, and at the very moment when she returned she had fallen rigid on\nthe floor without uttering a word. Macquart himself had carried her to\nthe bed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat surprises me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, by way of conclusion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis, that she did\nnot break the bottle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young doctor reflected. After a short pause he resumed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard two\nshots fired as I came here. Perhaps those ruffians have been shooting\nsome more prisoners. If she passed through the ranks of the soldiers at\nthat moment, the sight of blood may have thrown her into this fit. She\nmust have had some dreadful shock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFortunately he had with him the little medicine-case which he had been\ncarrying about ever since the departure of the insurgents. He tried\nto pour a few drops of reddish liquid between aunt Dide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s closely-set\nteeth, while Macquart again asked his brother: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you got the money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve brought it; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll settle now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rougon replied, glad of this\ndiversion.\n\nThereupon Macquart, seeing that he was about to be paid, began to moan.\nHe had only learnt the consequence of his treachery when it was too\nlate; otherwise he would have demanded twice or thrice as much. And he\ncomplained bitterly. Really now a thousand francs was not enough. His\nchildren had forsaken him, he was all alone in the world, and obliged to\nquit France. He almost wept as he spoke of his coming exile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome now, will you take the eight hundred francs?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rougon, who was\nin haste to be off.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, certainly not; double the sum. Your wife cheated me. If she had\ntold me distinctly what it was she expected of me, I would never have\ncompromised myself for such a trifle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRougon laid the eight hundred francs upon the table.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI swear I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got any more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will think of you\nlater. But do, for mercy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, get away this evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart, cursing and muttering protests, thereupon carried the table\nto the window, and began to count the gold in the fading twilight. The\ncoins tickled the tips of his fingers very pleasantly as he let them\nfall, and jingled musically in the darkness. At last he paused for a\nmoment to say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou promised to get me a berth, remember. I want to\nreturn to France. The post of rural guard in some pleasant neighbourhood\nwhich I could mention, would just suit me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see about it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rougon replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you got the eight\nhundred francs?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMacquart resumed his counting. The last coins were just clinking when a\nburst of laughter made them turn their heads. Aunt Dide was standing up\nin front of the bed, with her bodice unfastened, her white hair hanging\nloose, and her face stained with red blotches. Pascal had in vain\nendeavoured to hold her down. Trembling all over, and with her arms\noutstretched, she shook her head deliriously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe blood-money! the blood-money!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she again and again repeated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nheard the gold. And it is they, they who sold him. Ah! the murderers!\nThey are a pack of wolves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she pushed her hair aback, and passed her hand over her brow, as\nthough seeking to collect her thoughts. And she continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! I have\nlong seen him with a bullet-hole in his forehead. There were always\npeople lying in wait for him with guns. They used to sign to me that\nthey were going to fire. . . . It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terrible! I feel some one breaking\nmy bones and battering out my brains. Oh! Mercy! Mercy! I beseech you;\nhe shall not see her any more--never, never! I will shut him up. I will\nprevent him from walking out with her. Mercy! Mercy! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fire. It is\nnot my fault. If you knew----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had almost fallen on her knees, and was weeping and entreating while\nshe stretched her poor trembling hands towards some horrible vision\nwhich she saw in the darkness. Then she suddenly rose upright, and her\neyes opened still more widely as a terrible cry came from her convulsed\nthroat, as though some awful sight, visible to her alone, had filled her\nwith mad terror.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, the gendarme!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, choking and falling backwards on the bed,\nwhere she rolled about, breaking into long bursts of furious, insane\nlaughter.\n\nPascal was studying the attack attentively. The two brothers, who felt\nvery frightened, and only detected snatches of what their mother said,\nhad taken refuge in a corner of the room. When Rougon heard the word\ngendarme, he thought he understood her. Ever since the murder of her\nlover, the elder Macquart, on the frontier, aunt Dide had cherished a\nbitter hatred against all gendarmes and custom-house officers, whom she\nmingled together in one common longing for vengeance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the story of the poacher that she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telling us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nwhispered.\n\nBut Pascal made a sign to him to keep quiet. The stricken woman had\nraised herself with difficulty, and was looking round her, with a\nstupefied air. She remained silent for a moment, endeavouring to\nrecognise the various objects in the room, as though she were in some\nstrange place. Then, with a sudden expression of anxiety, she asked:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is the gun?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor put the carbine into her hands. At this she raised a light\ncry of joy, and gazed at the weapon, saying in a soft, sing-song,\ngirlish whisper: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is it. Oh! I recognise it! It is all stained with\nblood. The stains are quite fresh to-day. His red hands have left marks\nof blood on the butt. Ah! poor, poor aunt Dide!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she became dizzy once more, and lapsed into silent thought.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe gendarme was dead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I have seen him\nagain; he has come back. They never die, those blackguards!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgain did gloomy passion come over her, and, shaking the carbine, she\nadvanced towards her two sons who, speechless with fright, retreated to\nthe very wall. Her loosened skirts trailed along the ground, as she drew\nup her twisted frame, which age had reduced to mere bones.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you who fired!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard the gold. . . . Wretched woman\nthat I am! . . . I brought nothing but wolves into the world--a whole\nfamily--a whole litter of wolves! . . . There was only one poor lad,\nand him they have devoured; each had a bite at him, and their lips are\ncovered with blood. . . . Ah! the accursed villains! They have robbed,\nthey have murdered. . . . And they live like gentlemen. Villains!\nAccursed villains!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe sang, laughed, cried, and repeated \u00e2\u0080\u009caccursed villains!\u00e2\u0080\u009d in strangely\nsonorous tones, which suggested a crackling of a fusillade. Pascal, with\ntears in his eyes, took her in his arms and laid her on the bed\nagain. She submitted like a child, but persisted in her wailing cries,\naccelerating their rhythm, and beating time on the sheet with her\nwithered hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just what I was afraid of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is mad. The\nblow has been too heavy for a poor creature already subject, as she is,\nto acute neurosis. She will die in a lunatic asylum like her father.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what could she have seen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Rougon, at last venturing to quit\nthe corner where he had hidden himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have a terrible suspicion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pascal replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was going to speak to\nyou about Silvere when you came in. He is a prisoner. You must endeavour\nto obtain his release from the prefect, if there is still time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old oil-dealer turned pale as he looked at his son. Then, rapidly,\nhe responded: \u00e2\u0080\u009cListen to me; you stay here and watch her. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m too busy\nthis evening. We will see to-morrow about conveying her to the lunatic\nasylum at Les Tulettes. As for you, Macquart, you must leave this\nvery night. Swear to me that you will! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to find Monsieur de\nBleriot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stammered as he spoke, and felt more eager than ever to get out into\nthe fresh air of the streets. Pascal fixed a penetrating look on the\nmadwoman, and then on his father and uncle. His professional instinct\nwas getting the better of him, and he studied the mother and the sons,\nwith all the keenness of a naturalist observing the metamorphosis of\nsome insect. He pondered over the growth of that family to which he\nbelonged, over the different branches growing from one parent stock,\nwhose sap carried identical germs to the farthest twigs, which bent in\ndivers ways according to the sunshine or shade in which they lived. And\nfor a moment, as by the glow of a lightning flash, he thought he could\nespy the future of the Rougon-Macquart family, a pack of unbridled,\ninsatiate appetites amidst a blaze of gold and blood.\n\nAunt Dide, however, had ceased her wailing chant at the mention of\nSilvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name. For a moment she listened anxiously. Then she broke out\ninto terrible shrieks. Night had now completely fallen, and the black\nroom seemed void and horrible. The shrieks of the madwoman, who was\nno longer visible, rang out from the darkness as from a grave. Rougon,\nlosing his head, took to flight, pursued by those taunting cries, whose\nbitterness seemed to increase amidst the gloom.\n\nAs he was emerging from the Impasse Saint-Mittre with hesitating steps,\nwondering whether it would not be dangerous to solicit Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pardon\nfrom the prefect, he saw Aristide prowling about the timber-yard. The\nlatter, recognising his father, ran up to him with an expression of\nanxiety and whispered a few words in his ear. Pierre turned pale, and\ncast a look of alarm towards the end of the yard, where the darkness was\nonly relieved by the ruddy glow of a little gipsy fire. Then they both\ndisappeared down the Rue de Rome, quickening their steps as though they\nhad committed a murder, and turning up their coat-collars in order that\nthey might not be recognised.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat saves me an errand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rougon whispered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us go to dinner. They\nare waiting for us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen they arrived, the yellow drawing-room was resplendent. Felicite\nwas all over the place. Everybody was there; Sicardot, Granoux, Roudier,\nVuillet, the oil-dealers, the almond-dealers, the whole set. The\nmarquis, however, had excused himself on the plea of rheumatism;\nand, besides, he was about to leave Plassans on a short trip. Those\nbloodstained bourgeois offended his feelings of delicacy, and moreover\nhis relative, the Count de Valqueyras, had begged him to withdraw from\npublic notice for a little time. Monsieur de Carnavant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s refusal vexed\nthe Rougons; but Felicite consoled herself by resolving to make a more\nprofuse display. She hired a pair of candelabra and ordered several\nadditional dishes as a kind of substitute for the marquis. The table was\nlaid in the yellow drawing-room, in order to impart more solemnity to\nthe occasion. The Hotel de Provence had supplied the silver, the china,\nand the glass. The cloth had been laid ever since five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in order\nthat the guests on arriving might feast their eyes upon it. At either\nend of the table, on the white cloth, were bouquets of artificial roses,\nin porcelain vases gilded and painted with flowers.\n\nWhen the habitual guests of the yellow drawing-room were assembled\nthere they could not conceal their admiration of the spectacle. Several\ngentlemen smiled with an air of embarrassment while they exchanged\nfurtive glances, which clearly signified, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese Rougons are mad,\nthey are throwing their money out of the window.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The truth was that\nFelicite, on going round to invite her guests, had been unable to hold\nher tongue. So everybody knew that Pierre had been decorated, and that\nhe was about to be nominated to some post; at which, of course, they\npulled wry faces. Roudier indeed observed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe little black woman\nwas puffing herself out too much.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now that \u00e2\u0080\u009cprize-day\u00e2\u0080\u009d had come this\nband of bourgeois, who had rushed upon the expiring Republic--each one\nkeeping an eye on the other, and glorying in giving a deeper bite than\nhis neighbour--did not think it fair that their hosts should have all\nthe laurels of the battle. Even those who had merely howled by instinct,\nasking no recompense of the rising Empire, were greatly annoyed to see\nthat, thanks to them, the poorest and least reputable of them all should\nbe decorated with the red ribbon. The whole yellow drawing-room ought to\nhave been decorated!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot that I value the decoration,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Roudier said to Granoux, whom he had\ndragged into the embrasure of a window. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI refused it in the time of\nLouis-Philippe, when I was purveyor to the court. Ah! Louis-Philippe was\na good king. France will never find his equal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoudier was becoming an Orleanist once more. And he added, with the\ncrafty hypocrisy of an old hosier from the Rue Saint-Honore: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you,\nmy dear Granoux; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think the ribbon would look well in your\nbutton-hole? After all, you did as much to save the town as Rougon did.\nYesterday, when I was calling upon some very distinguished persons, they\ncould scarcely believe it possible that you had made so much noise with\na mere hammer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGranoux stammered his thanks, and, blushing like a maiden at her first\nconfession of love, whispered in Roudier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say anything\nabout it, but I have reason to believe that Rougon will ask the ribbon\nfor me. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good fellow at heart, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old hosier thereupon became grave, and assumed a very affable\nmanner. When Vuillet came and spoke to him of the well-deserved reward\nthat their friend had just received, he replied in a loud voice, so as\nto be heard by Felicite, who was sitting a little way off, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmen\nlike Rougon were an ornament to the Legion of Honour.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The bookseller\njoined in the chorus; he had that morning received a formal assurance\nthat the custom of the college would be restored to him. As for\nSicardot, he at first felt somewhat annoyed to find himself no longer\nthe only one of the set who was decorated. According to him, none but\nsoldiers had a right to the ribbon. Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valour surprised him.\nHowever, being in reality a good-natured fellow, he at last grew warmer,\nand ended by saying that the Napoleons always knew how to distinguish\nmen of spirit and energy.\n\nRougon and Aristide consequently had an enthusiastic reception; on their\narrival all hands were held out to them. Some of the guests went so\nfar as to embrace them. Angele sat on the sofa, by the side of her\nmother-in-law, feeling very happy, and gazing at the table with the\nastonishment of a gourmand who has never seen so many dishes at once.\nWhen Aristide approached, Sicardot complimented his son-in-law upon his\nsuperb article in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndependant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He restored his friendship to\nhim. The young man, in answer to the fatherly questions which Sicardot\naddressed to him, replied that he was anxious to take his little family\nwith him to Paris, where his brother Eugene would push him forward; but\nhe was in want of five hundred francs. Sicardot thereupon promised\nhim the money, already foreseeing the day when his daughter would be\nreceived at the Tuileries by Napoleon III.\n\nIn the meantime, Felicite had made a sign to her husband. Pierre,\nsurrounded by everybody and anxiously questioned about his pallor, could\nonly escape for a minute. He was just able to whisper in his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear\nthat he had found Pascal and that Macquart would leave that night. Then\nlowering his voice still more he told her of his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insanity, and\nplaced his finger on his lips, as if to say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a word; that would\nspoil the whole evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felicite bit her lips. They exchanged a look\nin which they read their common thoughts: so now the old woman would not\ntrouble them any more: the poacher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hovel would be razed to the ground,\nas the walls of the Fouques\u00e2\u0080\u0099 enclosure had been demolished; and they\nwould for ever enjoy the respect and esteem of Plassans.\n\nBut the guests were looking at the table. Felicite showed the gentlemen\ntheir seats. It was perfect bliss. As each one took his spoon, Sicardot\nmade a gesture to solicit a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delay. Then he rose and gravely\nsaid: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGentlemen, on behalf of the company present, I wish to express\nto our host how pleased we are at the rewards which his courage and\npatriotism have procured for him. I now see that he must have acted upon\na heaven-sent inspiration in remaining here, while those beggars were\ndragging myself and others along the high roads. Therefore, I heartily\napplaud the decision of the government. . . . Let me finish, you can\nthen congratulate our friend. . . . Know, then, that our friend, besides\nbeing made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour, is also to be appointed\nto a receiver of taxes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a cry of surprise. They had expected a small post. Some of\nthem tried to force a smile; but, aided by the sight of the table, the\ncompliments again poured forth profusely.\n\nSicardot once more begged for silence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait one moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not finished. Just one word. It is probable that our friend will\nremain among us, owing to the death of Monsieur Peirotte.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhilst the guests burst out into exclamations, Felicite felt a keen pain\nin her heart. Sicardot had already told her that the receiver had been\nshot; but at the mention of that sudden and shocking death, just as they\nwere starting on that triumphal dinner, it seemed as if a chilling gust\nswept past her face. She remembered her wish; it was she who had killed\nthat man. However, amidst the tinkling music of the silver, the company\nbegan to do honour to the banquet. In the provinces, people eat\nvery much and very noisily. By the time the _releve_ was served, the\ngentlemen were all talking together; they showered kicks upon the\nvanquished, flattered one another, and made disparaging remarks about\nthe absence of the marquis. It was impossible, they said, to maintain\nintercourse with the nobility. Roudier even gave out that the marquis\nhad begged to be excused because his fear of the insurgents had given\nhim jaundice. At the second course they all scrambled like hounds at\nthe quarry. The oil-dealers and almond-dealers were the men who saved\nFrance. They clinked glasses to the glory of the Rougons. Granoux, who\nwas very red, began to stammer, while Vuillet, very pale, was quite\ndrunk. Nevertheless Sicardot continued filling his glass. For her part\nAngele, who had already eaten too much, prepared herself some sugar and\nwater. The gentlemen were so delighted at being freed from panic, and\nfinding themselves together again in that yellow drawing-room, round a\ngood table, in the bright light radiating from the candelabra and\nthe chandelier--which they now saw for the first time without its\nfly-specked cover--that they gave way to most exuberant folly and\nindulged in the coarsest enjoyment. Their voices rose in the warm\natmosphere more huskily and eulogistically at each successive dish till\nthey could scarcely invent fresh compliments. However, one of them, an\nold retired master-tanner, hit upon this fine phrase--that the dinner\nwas a \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect feast worthy of Lucullus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPierre was radiant, and his big pale face perspired with triumph.\nFelicite, already accustoming herself to her new station in life, said\nthat they would probably rent poor Monsieur Peirotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flat until they\ncould purchase a house of their own in the new town. She was already\nplanning how she would place her future furniture in the receiver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nrooms. She was entering into possession of her Tuileries. At one\nmoment, however, as the uproar of voices became deafening, she seemed to\nrecollect something, and quitting her seat she whispered in Aristide\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\near: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Silvere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young man started with surprise at the question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is dead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, likewise in a whisper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was there when the\ngendarme blew his brains out with a pistol.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFelicite in her turn shuddered. She opened her mouth to ask her son\nwhy he had not prevented this murder by claiming the lad; but abruptly\nhesitating she remained there speechless. Then Aristide, who had read\nher question on her quivering lips, whispered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou understand, I said\nnothing--so much the worse for him! I did quite right. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good\nriddance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis brutal frankness displeased Felicite. So Aristide had his skeleton,\nlike his father and mother. He would certainly not have confessed so\nopenly that he had been strolling about the Faubourg and had allowed his\ncousin to be shot, had not the wine from the Hotel de Provence and the\ndreams he was building upon his approaching arrival in Paris, made\nhim depart from his habitual cunning. The words once spoken, he\nswung himself to and fro on his chair. Pierre, who had watched the\nconversation between his wife and son from a distance, understood what\nhad passed and glanced at them like an accomplice imploring silence. It\nwas the last blast of terror, as it were, which blew over the Rougons,\namidst the splendour and enthusiastic merriment of the dinner. True,\nFelicite, on returning to her seat, espied a taper burning behind a\nwindow on the other side of the road. Some one sat watching Monsieur\nPeirotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corpse, which had been brought back from Sainte-Roure that\nmorning. She sat down, feeling as if that taper were heating her back.\nBut the gaiety was now increasing, and exclamations of rapture rang\nthrough the yellow drawing-room when the dessert appeared.\n\nAt that same hour, the Faubourg was still shuddering at the tragedy\nwhich had just stained the Aire Saint-Mittre with blood. The return of\nthe troops, after the carnage on the Nores plain, had been marked by the\nmost cruel reprisals. Men were beaten to death behind bits of wall, with\nthe butt-ends of muskets, others had their brains blown out in ravines\nby the pistols of gendarmes. In order that terror might impose silence,\nthe soldiers strewed their road with corpses. One might have followed\nthem by the red trail which they left behind.[*] It was a long butchery.\nAt every halting-place, a few insurgents were massacred. Two were killed\nat Sainte-Roure, three at Ocheres, one at Beage. When the troops were\nencamped at Plassans, on the Nice road, it was decided that one more\nprisoner, the most guilty, should be shot. The victors judged it wise\nto leave this fresh corpse behind them in order to inspire the town\nwith respect for the new-born Empire. But the soldiers were now weary of\nkilling; none offered himself for the fatal task. The prisoners, thrown\non the beams in the timber-yard as though on a camp bed, and bound\ntogether in pairs by the hands, listened and waited in a state of weary,\nresigned stupor.\n\n     [*] Though M. Zola has changed his place in his account of\n     the insurrection, that account is strictly accurate in all\n     its chief particulars. What he says of the savagery both of\n     the soldiers and of their officers is confirmed by all\n     impartial historical writers.--EDITOR.\n\nAt that moment the gendarme Rengade roughly opened a way for himself\nthrough the crowd of inquisitive idlers. As soon as he heard that the\ntroops had returned with several hundred insurgents, he had risen\nfrom bed, shivering with fever, and risking his life in the cold, dark\nDecember air. Scarcely was he out of doors when his wound reopened, the\nbandage which covered his eyeless socket became stained with blood,\nand a red streamlet trickled over his cheek and moustache. He looked\nfrightful in his dumb fury with his pale face and blood-stained bandage,\nas he ran along closely scrutinising each of the prisoners. He followed\nthe beams, bending down and going to and fro, making the bravest shudder\nby his abrupt appearance. And, all of a sudden: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! the bandit, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\ngot him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.\n\nHe had just laid his hand on Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder. Silvere, crouching down\non a beam, with lifeless and expressionless face, was looking straight\nbefore him into the pale twilight, with a calm, stupefied air. Ever\nsince his departure from Sainte-Roure, he had retained that vacant\nstare. Along the high road, for many a league, whenever the soldiers\nurged on the march of their captives with the butt-ends of their rifles,\nhe had shown himself as gentle as a child. Covered with dust, thirsty\nand weary, he trudged onward without saying a word, like one of those\ndocile animals that herdsmen drive along. He was thinking of Miette. He\never saw her lying on the banner, under the trees with her eyes turned\nupwards. For three days he had seen none but her; and at this very\nmoment, amidst the growing darkness, he still saw her.\n\nRengade turned towards the officer, who had failed to find among the\nsoldiers the requisite men for an execution.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis villain put my eye out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, pointing to Silvere. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHand him\nover to me. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as good as done for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe officer did not reply in words, but withdrew with an air of\nindifference, making a vague gesture. The gendarme understood that the\nman was surrendered to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, get up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he resumed, as he shook him.\n\nSilvere, like all the other prisoners, had a companion attached to him.\nHe was fastened by the arm to a peasant of Poujols named Mourgue, a man\nabout fifty, who had been brutified by the scorching sun and the\nhard labour of tilling the ground. Crooked-backed already, his hands\nhardened, his face coarse and heavy, he blinked his eyes in a stupid\nmanner, with the stubborn, distrustful expression of an animal subject\nto the lash. He had set out armed with a pitchfork, because his fellow\nvillagers had done so; but he could not have explained what had thus\nset him adrift on the high roads. Since he had been made a prisoner\nhe understood it still less. He had some vague idea that he was being\nconveyed home. His amazement at finding himself bound, the sight of all\nthe people staring at him, stupefied him still more. As he only spoke\nand understood the dialect of the region, he could not imagine what the\ngendarme wanted. He raised his coarse, heavy face towards him with an\neffort; then, fancying he was being asked the name of his village, he\nsaid in his hoarse voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI come from Poujols.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA burst of laughter ran through the crowd, and some voices cried:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRelease the peasant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rengade replied; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe more of this vermin that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crushed the\nbetter. As they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re together, they can both go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a murmur.\n\nBut the gendarme turned his terrible blood-stained face upon the\nonlookers, and they slunk off. One cleanly little citizen went away\ndeclaring that if he remained any longer it would spoil his appetite for\ndinner. However some boys who recognised Silvere, began to speak of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe\nred girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thereupon the little citizen retraced his steps, in order to\nsee the lover of the female standard-bearer, that depraved creature who\nhad been mentioned in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGazette.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere, for his part, neither saw nor heard anything; Rengade had to\nseize him by the collar. Thereupon he got up, forcing Mourgue to rise\nalso.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the gendarme. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere then recognised the one-eyed man. He smiled. He must have\nunderstood. But he turned his head away. The sight of the one-eyed man,\nof his moustaches which congealed blood stiffened as with sinister rime,\ncaused him profound grief. He would have liked to die in perfect peace.\nSo he avoided the gaze of Rengade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one eye, which glared from beneath\nthe white bandage. And of his own accord he proceeded to the end of\nthe Aire Saint-Mittre, to the narrow lane hidden by the timber stacks.\nMourgue followed him thither.\n\nThe Aire stretched out, with an aspect of desolation under the sallow\nsky. A murky light fell here and there from the copper-coloured clouds.\nNever had a sadder and more lingering twilight cast its melancholy over\nthis bare expanse--this wood-yard with its slumbering timber, so stiff\nand rigid in the cold. The prisoners, the soldiers, and the mob along\nthe high road disappeared amid the darkness of the trees. The expanse,\nthe beams, the piles of planks alone grew pale under the fading light,\nassuming a muddy tint that vaguely suggested the bed of a dried-up\ntorrent. The sawyers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trestles, rearing their meagre framework in a\ncorner, seemed to form gallows, or the uprights of a guillotine. And\nthere was no living soul there excepting three gipsies who showed their\nfrightened faces at the door of their van--an old man and woman, and a\nbig girl with woolly hair, whose eyes gleamed like those of a wolf.\n\nBefore reaching the secluded path, Silvere looked round him. He\nbethought himself of a far away Sunday when he had crossed the wood-yard\nin the bright moonlight. How calm and soft it had been!--how slowly had\nthe pale rays passed over the beams! Supreme silence had fallen from the\nfrozen sky. And amidst this silence, the woolly-haired gipsy girl had\nsung in a low key and an unknown tongue. Then Silvere remembered that\nthe seemingly far-off Sunday was only a week old. But a week ago he had\ncome to bid Miette farewell! How long past it seemed! He felt as though\nhe had not set foot in the wood-yard for years. But when he reached the\nnarrow path his heart failed him. He recognised the odour of the grass,\nthe shadows of the planks, the holes in the wall. A woeful voice rose\nfrom all those things. The path stretched out sad and lonely; it seemed\nlonger to him than usual, and he felt a cold wind blowing down it. The\nspot had aged cruelly. He saw that the wall was moss-eaten, that the\nverdant carpet was dried up by frost, that the piles of timber had been\nrotted by rain. It was perfect devastation. The yellow twilight fell\nlike fine dust upon the ruins of all that had been most dear to him. He\nwas obliged to close his eyes that he might again behold the lane green,\nand live his happy hours afresh. It was warm weather; and he was\nracing with Miette in the balmy air. Then the cruel December rains fell\nunceasingly, yet they still came there, sheltering themselves beneath\nthe planks and listening with rapture to the heavy plashing of the\nshower. His whole life--all his happiness--passed before him like a\nflash of lightning. Miette was climbing over the wall, running to\nhim, shaking with sonorous laughter. She was there; he could see her,\ngleaming white through the darkness, with her living helm of ink-black\nhair. She was talking about the magpies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nests, which are so difficult\nto steal, and she dragged him along with her. Then he heard the gentle\nmurmur of the Viorne in the distance, the chirping of the belated\ngrasshoppers, and the blowing of the breeze among the poplars in\nthe meadows of Sainte-Claire. Ah, how they used to run! How well he\nremembered it! She had learnt to swim in a fortnight. She was a plucky\ngirl. She had only had one great fault: she was inclined to pilfering.\nBut he would have cured her of that. Then the thought of their first\nembraces brought him back to the narrow path. They had always ended by\nreturning to that nook. He fancied he could hear the gipsy girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s song\ndying away, the creaking of the last shutters, the solemn striking of\nthe clocks. Then the hour of separation came, and Miette climbed the\nwall again and threw him a kiss. And he saw her no more. Emotion choked\nhim at the thought: he would never see her again--never!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready,\u00e2\u0080\u009d jeered the one-eyed man; \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome, choose your place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere took a few more steps. He was approaching the end of the path,\nand could see nothing but a strip of sky in which the rust-coloured\nlight was fading away. Here had he spent his life for two years past.\nThe slow approach of death added an ineffable charm to this pathway\nwhich had so long served as a lovers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 walk. He loitered, bidding a long\nand lingering farewell to all he loved; the grass, the timber, the stone\nof the old wall, all those things into which Miette had breathed life.\nAnd again his thoughts wandered. They were waiting till they should be\nold enough to marry: Aunt Dide would remain with them. Ah! if they had\nfled far away, very far away, to some unknown village, where the\nscamps of the Faubourg would no longer have been able to come and cast\nChantegreil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crime in his daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. What peaceful bliss! They\nwould have opened a wheelwright\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workshop beside some high road. No\ndoubt, he cared little for his ambitions now; he no longer thought\nof coachmaking, of carriages with broad varnished panels as shiny as\nmirrors. In the stupor of his despair he could not remember why his\ndream of bliss would never come to pass. Why did he not go away with\nMiette and aunt Dide? Then as he racked his memory, he heard the sharp\ncrackling of a fusillade; he saw a standard fall before him, its staff\nbroken and its folds drooping like the wings of a bird brought down by a\nshot. It was the Republic falling asleep with Miette under the red flag.\nAh, what wretchedness! They were both dead, both had bleeding wounds in\ntheir breasts. And it was they--the corpses of his two loves--that now\nbarred his path of life. He had nothing left him and might well die\nhimself. These were the thoughts that had made him so gentle, so\nlistless, so childlike all the way from Sainte-Roure. The soldiers\nmight have struck him, he would not have felt it. His spirit no longer\ninhabited his body. It was far away, prostrate beside the loved ones who\nwere dead under the trees amidst the pungent smoke of the gunpowder.\n\nBut the one-eyed man was growing impatient; giving a push to Mourgue,\nwho was lagging behind, he growled: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet along, do; I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be\nhere all night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSilvere stumbled. He looked at his feet. A fragment of a skull lay\nwhitening in the grass. He thought he heard a murmur of voices filling\nthe pathway. The dead were calling him, those long departed ones, whose\nwarm breath had so strangely perturbed him and his sweetheart during\nthe sultry July evenings. He recognised their low whispers. They were\nrejoicing, they were telling him to come, and promising to restore\nMiette to him beneath the earth, in some retreat which would prove\nstill more sequestered than this old trysting-place. The cemetery, whose\noppressive odours and dark vegetation had breathed eager desire into the\nchildren\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hearts, while alluringly spreading out its couches of rank\ngrass, without succeeding however in throwing them into one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\narms, now longed to imbibe Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warm blood. For two summers past it\nhad been expecting the young lovers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the one-eyed man.\n\nSilvere looked in front of him. He had reached the end of the path. His\neyes fell on the tombstone, and he started. Miette was right, that stone\nwas for her. _\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere lieth . . . Marie . . . died . . . \u00e2\u0080\u009c_ She was\ndead, that slab had fallen over her. His strength failing him, he leant\nagainst the frozen stone. How warm it had been when they sat in that\nnook, chatting for many a long evening! She had always come that way,\nand the pressure of her foot, as she alighted from the wall, had worn\naway the stone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface in one corner. The mark seemed instinct with\nsomething of her lissom figure. And to Silvere it appeared as if some\nfatalism attached to all these objects--as if the stone were there\nprecisely in order that he might come to die beside it, there where he\nhad loved.\n\nThe one-eyed man cocked his pistols.\n\nDeath! death! the thought fascinated Silvere. It was to this spot,\nthen, that they had led him, by the long white road which descends from\nSainte-Roure to Plassans. If he had known it, he would have hastened on\nyet more quickly in order to die on that stone, at the end of the\nnarrow path, in the atmosphere where he could still detect the scent of\nMiette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breath! Never had he hoped for such consolation in his grief.\nHeaven was merciful. He waited, a vague smile playing on is face.\n\nMourgue, meantime, had caught sight of the pistols. Hitherto he had\nallowed himself to be dragged along stupidly. But fear now overcame him,\nand he repeated, in a tone of despair: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI come from Poujols--I come from\nPoujols!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen he threw himself on the ground, rolling at the gendarme\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet,\nbreaking out into prayers for mercy, and imagining that he was being\nmistaken for some one else.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does it matter to me that you come from Poujols?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rengade\nmuttered.\n\nAnd as the wretched man, shivering and crying with terror, and quite\nunable to understand why he was going to die, held out his trembling\nhands--his deformed, hard, labourer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands--exclaiming in his patois\nthat he had done nothing and ought to be pardoned, the one-eyed man grew\nquite exasperated at being unable to put the pistol to his temple, owing\nto his constant movements.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you hold your tongue?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted.\n\nThereupon Mourgue, mad with fright and unwilling to die, began to howl\nlike a beast--like a pig that is being slaughtered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold your tongue, you scoundrel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the gendarme repeated.\n\nAnd he blew his brains out. The peasant fell with a thud. His body\nrolled to the foot of a timber-stack, where it remained doubled up. The\nviolence of the shock had severed the rope which fastened him to his\ncompanion. Silvere fell on his knees before the tombstone.\n\nIt was to make his vengeance the more terrible that Rengade had killed\nMourgue first. He played with his second pistol, raising it slowly in\norder to relish Silvere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agony. But the latter looked at him quietly.\nThen again the sight of this man, with the one fierce, scorching eye,\nmade him feel uneasy. He averted his glance, fearing that he might die\ncowardly if he continued to look at that feverishly quivering gendarme,\nwith blood-stained bandage and bleeding moustache. However, as he raised\nhis eyes to avoid him, he perceived Justin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head just above the wall,\nat the very spot where Miette had been wont to leap over.\n\nJustin had been at the Porte de Rome, among the crowd, when the gendarme\nhad led the prisoners away. He had set off as fast as he could by way of\nthe Jas-Meiffren, in his eagerness to witness the execution. The thought\nthat he alone, of all the Faubourg scamps, would view the tragedy at\nhis ease, as from a balcony, made him run so quickly that he twice fell\ndown. And in spite of his wild chase, he arrived too late to witness the\nfirst shot. He climbed the mulberry tree in despair; but he smiled when\nhe saw that Silvere still remained. The soldiers had informed him of\nhis cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, and now the murder of the wheelwright brought his\nhappiness to a climax. He awaited the shot with that delight which the\nsufferings of others always afforded him--a delight increased tenfold by\nthe horror of the scene, and a feeling of exquisite fear.\n\nSilvere, on recognising that vile scamp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head all by itself above the\nwall--that pale grinning face, with hair standing on end--experienced a\nfeeling of fierce rage, a sudden desire to live. It was the last revolt\nof his blood--a momentary mutiny. He again sank down on his knees,\ngazing straight before him. A last vision passed before his eyes in\nthe melancholy twilight. At the end of the path, at the entrance of the\nImpasse Saint-Mittre, he fancied he could see aunt Dide standing erect,\nwhite and rigid like the statue of a saint, while she witnessed his\nagony from a distance.\n\nAt that moment he felt the cold pistol on his temple. There was a smile\non Justin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pale face. Closing his eyes, Silvere heard the long-departed\ndead wildly summoning him. In the darkness, he now saw nothing save\nMiette, wrapped in the banner, under the trees, with her eyes turned\ntowards heaven. Then the one-eyed man fired, and all was over; the lad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nskull burst open like a ripe pomegranate; his face fell upon the stone,\nwith his lips pressed to the spot which Miette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet had worn--that\nwarm spot which still retained a trace of his dead love.\n\nAnd in the evening at dessert, at the Rougons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 abode, bursts of laughter\narose with the fumes from the table, which was still warm with the\nremains of the dinner. At last the Rougons were nibbling at the\npleasures of the wealthy! Their appetites, sharpened by thirty years\nof restrained desire, now fell to with wolfish teeth. These fierce,\ninsatiate wild beasts, scarcely entering upon indulgence, exulted at\nthe birth of the Empire--the dawn of the Rush for the Spoils. The Coup\nd\u00e2\u0080\u0099Etat, which retrieved the fortune of the Bonapartes, also laid the\nfoundation for that of the Rougons.\n\nPierre stood up, held out his glass, and exclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI drink to Prince\nLouis--to the Emperor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe gentlemen, who had drowned their jealousies in champagne, rose in a\nbody and clinked glasses with deafening shouts. It was a fine spectacle.\nThe bourgeois of Plassans, Roudier, Granoux, Vuillet, and all the\nothers, wept and embraced each other over the corpse of the Republic,\nwhich as yet was scarcely cold. But a splendid idea occurred to\nSicardot. He took from Felicite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair a pink satin bow, which she had\nplaced over her right ear in honour of the occasion, cut off a strip\nof the satin with his dessert knife, and then solemnly fastened it\nto Rougon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s button-hole. The latter feigned modesty, and pretended to\nresist. But his face beamed with joy, as he murmured: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I beg you, it\nis too soon. We must wait until the decree is published.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cZounds!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sicardot exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill you please keep that! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an old\nsoldier of Napoleon who decorates you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe whole company burst into applause. Felicite almost swooned with\ndelight. Silent Granoux jumped up on a chair in his enthusiasm, waving\nhis napkin and making a speech which was lost amid the uproar. The\nyellow drawing-room was wild with triumph.\n\nBut the strip of pink satin fastened to Pierre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s button-hole was not\nthe only red spot in that triumph of the Rougons. A shoe, with a\nblood-stained heel, still lay forgotten under the bedstead in the\nadjoining room. The taper burning at Monsieur Peirotte\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bedside, over\nthe way, gleamed too with the lurid redness of a gaping wound amidst\nthe dark night. And yonder, far away, in the depths of the Aire\nSaint-Mittre, a pool of blood was congealing upon a tombstone.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Fortune of the Rougons, by Emile Zola\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FORTUNE OF THE ROUGONS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 5135-0.txt or 5135-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/5\/1\/3\/5135\/\n\nProduced by Dagny; John Bickers; David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1307,"split":"test"}
