{"ori_id":"d9f524a1f44a19f5aa9818120eede1ca4608db44","title":"A Shropshire Lad","context":"A Shropshire Lad\n A Shropshire Lad contains several repeated themes. It is not a connected narrative, though it can be read as an allegory of a heart's journey through life. The \"I\" of the poems, the authorial person, is in two cases named as Terence (VIII, LXII), the \"Shropshire Lad\" of the title. However, the poems are not all in the same voice and the stories they tell are not intended as a single coherent narrative.\nThe collection begins by paying tribute to the Shropshire lads who have died as soldiers in the service of Queen Victoria, as her golden jubilee (1887) is celebrated with a beacon bonfire at Clee (I). There is little time for a lad to live and enjoy the spring (II). Death awaits the soldier (III-IV). Maids are not always kind (V-VI) and the farmer also comes to the grave (VII). Some lads murder their brothers and are hanged (VIII-IX). Love may be unrequited (X). A dead lad's ghost begs the consolation of a last embrace (XI). Unattainable love leaves the lad helpless and lost (XIII-XVI). The playing of a game of cricket or football consoles a broken heart (XVII).\nThe athlete who died young was lucky, for he did not outlive his renown (XIX). The poet exchanges a glance with a marching soldier and wishes him well, though thinking they will never cross paths again (XXII). He envies the country lads who die young and do not grow old (XXIII). Quick, while he is alive and young, allow him to work beside you! (XXIV). A lover may die, and his girl will walk out with another (XXV-XXVII). The hostility of the ancient Saxon and Briton are in his blood, and he owes his life to violence and rape (XXVIII). The storm on Wenlock Edge symbolizes the same turmoil in his soul as the Romans knew at Wroxeter (XXXI). He is here but for a moment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 take this hand! (XXXII) But if he is of no use to them that he loves, he will go away, perhaps to be a soldier (XXXIV, XXXV). Or one may live an exile from home in London, but without forgetting home and friends (XXXVII, XXXVIII).\nThe wind sighs across England to him from Shropshire, but he will not see the broom flowering gold on Wenlock Edge (XXXVIII-XL). London is full of cold-hearted men who fear and hate one other, but he will make the best of life while he has a living will (XLIII). The suicide is wise, for he prefers to die cleanly than live in shame (XLIV). Bring him no flowers, but only what will never flower again (XLVI). A carpenter's son once died on the gallows, so that other lads might live (XLVII). He was happy before he was born, but he will endure life for a while: the cure for all sorrows will come in time (XLVIII). If crowded and noisy London has its troubles, so do quiet Clun and Knighton, and the only cure for any of them is the grave (L).\nThough he is in London, his spirit wanders about his home fields (LII). From the unquiet grave the suicide's ghost visits the beloved (LIII). Those he loved are dead, and other youths eternally re-live his own experiences (LV). Like the lad that becomes a soldier, one can choose death and face it (LVI). Dick is in the graveyard, and Ned is long in jail, as he comes home to Ludlow (LVIII). Take your pack and go: death will be a journey into eternal night (LX). It matters not if he sleeps among the suicides, or among those who died well \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they were all his friends(LXI). Do you mock his melancholy thoughts? He has used them like the poisons sampled by Mithridates, and shall die old (LXII). Perhaps these poems are not fashionable, but they will always please other lads like him (LXIII).\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of A Shropshire Lad, by A. E.

E. Housman\n\nIntroduction by William Stanley Braithwaite\n\n1919\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nThe method of the poems in _ A Shropshire Lad _ illustrates better\nthan any theory how poetry may assume the attire of reality, and yet\nin speech of the simplest, become in spirit the sheer quality of\nloveliness. For, in these unobtrusive pages, there is nothing shunned\nwhich makes the spectacle of life parade its dark and painful, its\nironic and cynical burdens, as well as those images with happy and\nexquisite aspects. With a broader and deeper background of experience\nand environment, which by some divine special privilege belongs to\nthe poetic imagination, it is easier to set apart and contrast these\nopposing words and sympathies in a poet; but here we find them evoked\nin a restricted locale- an English county-where the rich, cool tranquil\nlandscape gives a solid texture to the human show. What, I think,\nimpresses one, thrills, like ecstatic, half-smothered strains of music,\nfloating from unperceived instruments, in Mr. Housman's poems, is\nthe encounter his spirit constantly endures with life. It is, this\nencounter, what you feel in the Greeks, and as in the Greeks, it is a\nspiritual waging of miraculous forces. There is, too, in Mr. Housman's\npoems, the singularly Grecian Quality of a clean and fragrant mental and\nemotional temper, vibrating equally whether the theme dealt with is\nruin or defeat, or some great tragic crisis of spirit, or with moods and\nardours of pure enjoyment and simplicities of feeling. Scarcely has any\nmodern book of poems shown so sure a touch of genius in this respect:\nthe magic, in a continuous glow saturating the substance of every\npicture and motive with its own peculiar essence.\n\nWhat has been called the \"cynical bitterness\" of Mr. Housman's poems,\nis really nothing more than his ability to etch in sharp tones the\nactualities of experience. The poet himself is never cynical; his\njoyousness is all too apparent in the very manner and intensity of\nexpression. The \"lads\" of Ludlow are so human to him, the hawthorn and\nbroom on the Severn shores are so fragrant with associations, he cannot\nhelp but compose under a kind of imaginative wizardry of exultation,\neven when the immediate subject is grim or grotesque. In many of\nthese brief, tense poems the reader confronts a mask, as it were, with\nappalling and distorted lineaments; but behind it the poet smiles,\nperhaps sardonically, but smiles nevertheless. In the real countenance\nthere are no tears or grievances, but a quizzical, humorous expression\nwhich shows, when one has torn the subterfuge away, that here is a\nspirit whom life may menace with its contradictions and fatalities, but\nnever dupe with its circumstance and mystery.\n\nAll this quite points to, and partly explains, the charm of the poems in\n_ A Shropshire Lad _. The fastidious care with which each poem is built\nout of the simplest of technical elements, the precise tone and color of\nlanguage employed to articulate impulse and mood, and the reproduction\nof objective substances for a clear visualization of character and\nscene, all tend by a sure and unfaltering composition, to present a\nlyric art unique in English poetry of the last twenty-five years.\n\nI dare say I have scarcely touched upon the secret of Mr. Housman's\nbook. For some it may radiate from the Shropshire life he so finely\netches; for others, in the vivid artistic simplicity and unity of\nvalues, through which Shropshire lads and landscapes are presented. It\nmust be, however, in the miraculous fusing of the two. Whatever that\nsecret is, the charm of it never fails after all these years to keep the\npoems preserved with a freshness and vitality, which are the qualities\nof enduring genius.\n\n\nWILLIAM STANLEY BRAITHWAITE\n\n\n\n\n\nA SHROPSHIRE LAD\n\n\n\n          I\n\n          1887\n\n          From Clee to heaven the beacon burns,\n           The shires have seen it plain,\n          From north and south the sign returns\n           And beacons burn again.\n\n          Look left, look right, the hills are bright,\n           The dales are light between,\n          Because 'tis fifty years to-night\n           That God has saved the Queen.\n\n          Now, when the flame they watch not towers\n           About the soil they trod,\n          Lads, we'll remember friends of ours\n           Who shared the work with God.\n\n          To skies that knit their heartstrings right,\n           To fields that bred them brave,\n          The saviours come not home to-night:\n           Themselves they could not save.\n\n          It dawns in Asia, tombstones show\n           And Shropshire names are read;\n          And the Nile spills his overflow\n           Beside the Severn's dead.\n\n          We pledge in peace by farm and town\n           The Queen they served in war,\n          And fire the beacons up and down\n           The land they perished for.\n\n          \"God Save the Queen\" we living sing,\n           From height to height 'tis heard;\n          And with the rest your voices ring,\n           Lads of the Fifty-third.\n\n          Oh, God will save her, fear you not:\n           Be you the men you've been,\n          Get you the sons your fathers got,\n           And God will Save the Queen.\n\n\n\n          II\n\n          Loveliest of trees, the cherry now\n          Is hung with bloom along the bough,\n          And stands about the woodland ride\n          Wearing white for Eastertide.\n\n          Now, of my threescore years and ten,\n          Twenty will not come again,\n          And take from seventy springs a score,\n          It only leaves me fifty more.\n\n          And since to look at things in bloom\n          Fifty springs are little room,\n          About the woodlands I will go\n          To see the cherry hung with snow.\n\n\n\n          III\n\n          THE RECRUIT\n\n          Leave your home behind, lad,\n           And reach your friends your hand,\n          And go, and luck go with you\n           While Ludlow tower shall stand.\n\n          Oh, come you home of Sunday\n           When Ludlow streets are still\n          And Ludlow bells are calling\n           To farm and lane and mill,\n\n          Or come you home of Monday\n           When Ludlow market hums\n          And Ludlow chimes are playing\n           \"The conquering hero comes,\"\n\n          Come you home a hero,\n           Or come not home at all,\n          The lads you leave will mind you\n           Till Ludlow tower shall fall.\n\n          And you will list the bugle\n           That blows in lands of morn,\n          And make the foes of England\n           Be sorry you were born.\n\n          And you till trump of doomsday\n           On lands of morn may lie,\n          And make the hearts of comrades\n           Be heavy where you die.\n\n          Leave your home behind you,\n           Your friends by field and town\n          Oh, town and field will mind you\n           Till Ludlow tower is down.\n\n\n\n          IV\n\n          REVEILLE\n\n          Wake: the silver dusk returning\n           Up the beach of darkness brims,\n          And the ship of sunrise burning\n           Strands upon the eastern rims.\n\n          Wake: the vaulted shadow shatters,\n           Trampled to the floor it spanned,\n          And the tent of night in tatters\n           Straws the sky-pavilioned land.\n\n          Up, lad, up, 'tis late for lying:\n           Hear the drums of morning play;\n          Hark, the empty highways crying\n           \"Who'll beyond the hills away?\"\n\n          Towns and countries woo together,\n           Forelands beacon, belfries call;\n          Never lad that trod on leather\n           Lived to feast his heart with all.\n\n          Up, lad: thews that lie and cumber\n           Sunlit pallets never thrive;\n          Morns abed and daylight slumber\n           Were not meant for man alive.\n\n          Clay lies still, but blood's a rover;\n           Breath's a ware that will not keep\n          Up, lad: when the journey's over\n           There'll be time enough to sleep.\n\n\n\n          V\n\n          Oh see how thick the goldcup flowers\n           Are lying in field and lane,\n          With dandelions to tell the hours\n           That never are told again.\n          Oh may I squire you round the meads\n           And pick you posies gay?\n          -'Twill do no harm to take my arm.\n           \"You may, young man, you may.\"\n\n          Ah, spring was sent for lass and lad,\n           'Tis now the blood runs gold,\n          And man and maid had best be glad\n           Before the world is old.\n          What flowers to-day may flower to-morrow,\n           But never as good as new.\n          -Suppose I wound my arm right round-\n           \" 'Tis true, young man, 'tis true.\"\n\n          Some lads there are, 'tis shame to say,\n           That only court to thieve,\n          And once they bear the bloom away\n           'Tis little enough they leave.\n          Then keep your heart for men like me\n           And safe from trustless chaps.\n          My love is true and all for you.\n           \"Perhaps, young man, perhaps.\"\n\n          Oh, look in my eyes, then, can you doubt?\n           -Why, 'tis a mile from town.\n          How green the grass is all about!\n           We might as well sit down.\n          -Ah, life, what is it but a flower?\n           Why must true lovers sigh?\n          Be kind, have pity, my own, my pretty,-\n           \"Good-bye, young man, good-bye.\"\n\n\n\n          VI\n\n          When the lad for longing sighs,\n           Mute and dull of cheer and pale,\n          If at death's own door he lies,\n           Maiden, you can heal his ail.\n\n          Lovers' ills are all to buy:\n           The wan look, the hollow tone,\n          The hung head, the sunken eye,\n           You can have them for your own.\n\n          Buy them, buy them: eve and morn\n           Lovers' ills are all to sell.\n          Then you can lie down forlorn;\n           But the lover will be well.\n\n\n\n          VII\n\n          When smoke stood up from Ludlow,\n           And mist blew off from Teme,\n          And blithe afield to ploughing\n           Against the morning beam\n           I strode beside my team,\n\n          The blackbird in the coppice\n           Looked out to see me stride,\n          And hearkened as I whistled\n           The tramping team beside,\n           And fluted and replied:\n\n          \"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;\n           What use to rise and rise?\n          Rise man a thousand mornings\n           Yet down at last he lies,\n           And then the man is wise.\"\n\n          I heard the tune he sang me,\n           And spied his yellow bill;\n          I picked a stone and aimed it\n           And threw it with a will:\n           Then the bird was still.\n\n          Then my soul within me\n           Took up the blackbird's strain,\n          And still beside the horses\n           Along the dewy lane\n           It Sang the song again:\n\n          \"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;\n           The sun moves always west;\n          The road one treads to labour\n           Will lead one home to rest,\n           And that will be the best.\"\n\n\n\n          VIII\n\n          \"Farewell to barn and stack and tree,\n           Farewell to Severn shore.\n          Terence, look your last at me,\n           For I come home no more.\n\n          \"The sun burns on the half-mown hill,\n           By now the blood is dried;\n          And Maurice amongst the hay lies still\n           And my knife is in his side.\"\n\n          \"My mother thinks us long away;\n           'Tis time the field were mown.\n          She had two sons at rising day,\n           To-night she'll be alone.\"\n\n          \"And here's a bloody hand to shake,\n           And oh, man, here's good-bye;\n          We'll sweat no more on scythe and rake,\n           My bloody hands and I.\"\n\n          \"I wish you strength to bring you pride,\n           And a love to keep you clean,\n          And I wish you luck, come Lammastide,\n           At racing on the green.\"\n\n          \"Long for me the rick will wait,\n           And long will wait the fold,\n          And long will stand the empty plate,\n           And dinner will be cold.\"\n\n\n\n          IX\n\n          On moonlit heath and lonesome bank\n           The sheep beside me graze;\n          And yon the gallows used to clank\n           Fast by the four cross ways.\n\n          A careless shepherd once would keep\n           The flocks by moonlight there, (1)\n          And high amongst the glimmering sheep\n           The dead man stood on air.\n\n          They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail:\n           The whistles blow forlorn,\n          And trains all night groan on the rail\n           To men that die at morn.\n\n          There sleeps in Shrewsbury jail to-night,\n           Or wakes, as may betide,\n          A better lad, if things went right,\n           Than most that sleep outside.\n\n          And naked to the hangman's noose\n           The morning clocks will ring\n          A neck God made for other use\n           Than strangling in a string.\n\n          And sharp the link of life will snap,\n           And dead on air will stand\n          Heels that held up as straight a chap\n           As treads upon the land.\n\n          So here I'll watch the night and wait\n           To see the morning shine,\n          When he will hear the stroke of eight\n           And not the stroke of nine;\n\n          And wish my friend as sound a sleep\n           As lads' I did not know,\n          That shepherded the moonlit sheep\n           A hundred years ago.\n\n          (1) Hanging in chains was called keeping sheep by moonlight.\n\n\n\n          X\n\n          MARCH\n\n          The sun at noon to higher air,\n          Unharnessing the silver Pair\n          That late before his chariot swam,\n          Rides on the gold wool of the Ram.\n\n          So braver notes the storm-cock sings\n          To start the rusted wheel of things,\n          And brutes in field and brutes in pen\n          Leap that the world goes round again.\n\n          The boys are up the woods with day\n          To fetch the daffodils away,\n          And home at noonday from the hills\n          They bring no dearth of daffodils.\n\n          Afield for palms the girls repair,\n          And sure enough the palms are there,\n          And each will find by hedge or pond\n          Her waving silver-tufted wand.\n\n          In farm and field through all the shire\n          The eye beholds the heart's desire;\n          Ah, let not only mine be vain,\n          For lovers should be loved again.\n\n\n\n          XI\n\n          On your midnight pallet lying\n           Listen, and undo the door:\n          Lads that waste the light in sighing\n           In the dark should sigh no more;\n          Night should ease a lover's sorrow;\n          Therefore, since I go to-morrow;\n           Pity me before.\n\n          In the land to which I travel,\n           The far dwelling, let me say-\n          Once, if here the couch is gravel,\n           In a kinder bed I lay,\n          And the breast the darnel smothers\n          Rested once upon another's\n           When it was not clay.\n\n\n\n          XII\n\n          When I watch the living meet,\n           And the moving pageant file\n          Warm and breathing through the street\n           Where I lodge a little while,\n\n          If the heats of hate and lust\n           In the house of flesh are strong,\n          Let me mind the house of dust\n           Where my sojourn shall be long.\n\n          In the nation that is not\n           Nothing stands that stood before;\n          There revenges are forgot,\n           And the hater hates no more;\n\n          Lovers lying two and two\n           Ask not whom they sleep beside,\n          And the bridegroom all night through\n           Never turns him to the bride.\n\n\n\n          XIII\n\n          When I was one-and-twenty\n           I heard a wise man say,\n          \"Give crowns and pounds and guineas\n           But not your heart away;\n          Give pearls away and rubies\n           But keep your fancy free.\"\n          But I was one-and-twenty,\n           No use to talk to me.\n\n          When I was one-and-twenty\n           I heard him say again,\n          \"The heart out of the bosom\n           Was never given in vain;\n          'Tis paid with sighs a plenty\n           And sold for endless rue.\"\n          And I am two-and-twenty,\n           And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.\n\n\n\n          XIV\n\n          There pass the careless people\n           That call their souls their own:\n          Here by the road I loiter,\n           How idle and alone.\n\n          Ah, past the plunge of plummet,\n           In seas I cannot sound,\n          My heart and soul and senses,\n           World without end, are drowned.\n\n          His folly has not fellow\n           Beneath the blue of day\n          That gives to man or woman\n           His heart and soul away.\n\n          There flowers no balm to sain him\n           From east of earth to west\n          That's lost for everlasting\n           The heart out of his breast.\n\n          Here by the labouring highway\n           With empty hands I stroll:\n          Sea-deep, till doomsday morning,\n           Lie lost my heart and soul.\n\n\n\n          XV\n\n          Look not in my eyes, for fear\n           They mirror true the sight I see,\n          And there you find your face too clear\n           And love it and be lost like me.\n          One the long nights through must lie\n           Spent in star-defeated sighs,\n          But why should you as well as I\n           Perish? gaze not in my eyes.\n\n          A Grecian lad, as I hear tell,\n           One that many loved in vain,\n          Looked into a forest well\n           And never looked away again.\n          There, when the turf in springtime flowers,\n           With downward eye and gazes sad,\n          Stands amid the glancing showers\n           A jonquil, not a Grecian lad.\n\n\n\n          XVI\n\n          It nods and curtseys and recovers\n           When the wind blows above,\n          The nettle on the graves of lovers\n           That hanged themselves for love.\n\n          The nettle nods, the wind blows over,\n           The man, he does not move,\n          The lover of the grave, the lover\n           That hanged himself for love.\n\n\n\n          XVII\n\n          Twice a week the winter thorough\n           Here stood I to keep the goal:\n          Football then was fighting sorrow\n           For the young man's soul.\n\n          Now in May time to the wicket\n           Out I march with bat and pad:\n          See the son of grief at cricket\n           Trying to be glad.\n\n          Try I will; no harm in trying:\n           Wonder 'tis how little mirth\n          Keeps the bones of man from lying\n           On the bed of earth.\n\n\n\n          XVIII\n\n          Oh, when I was in love with you,\n           Then I was clean and brave,\n          And miles around the wonder grew\n           How well did I behave.\n\n          And now the fancy passes by,\n           And nothing will remain,\n          And miles around they'll say that I\n           Am quite myself again.\n\n\n\n          XIX\n\n          TO AN ATHLETE DYING YOUNG\n\n          The time you won your town the race\n          We chaired you through the market-place;\n          Man and boy stood cheering by,\n          And home we brought you shoulder-high.\n\n          To-day, the road all runners come,\n          Shoulder-high we bring you home,\n          And set you at your threshold down,\n          Townsman of a stiller town.\n\n          Smart lad, to slip betimes away\n          From fields where glory does not stay\n          And early though the laurel grows\n          It withers quicker than the rose.\n\n          Eyes the shady night has shut\n          Cannot see the record cut,\n          And silence sounds no worse than cheers\n          After earth has stopped the ears:\n\n          Now you will not swell the rout\n          Of lads that wore their honours out,\n          Runners whom renown outran\n          And the name died before the man.\n\n          So set, before its echoes fade,\n          The fleet foot on the sill of shade,\n          And hold to the low lintel up\n          The still-defended challenge-cup.\n\n          And round that early-laurelled head\n          Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead,\n          And find unwithered on its curls\n          The garland briefer than a girl's.\n\n\n\n          XX\n\n          Oh fair enough are sky and plain,\n           But I know fairer far:\n          Those are as beautiful again\n           That in the water are;\n\n          The pools and rivers wash so clean\n           The trees and clouds and air,\n          The like on earth was never seen,\n           And oh that I were there.\n\n          These are the thoughts I often think\n           As I stand gazing down\n          In act upon the cressy brink\n           To strip and dive and drown;\n\n          But in the golden-sanded brooks\n           And azure meres I spy\n          A silly lad that longs and looks\n           And wishes he were I.\n\n\n\n          XXI\n\n          BREDON HILL (1)\n\n          In summertime on Bredon\n           The bells they sound so clear;\n          Round both the shires they ring them\n           In steeples far and near,\n           A happy noise to hear.\n\n          Here of a Sunday morning\n           My love and I would lie\n          And see the coloured counties,\n           And hear the larks so high\n           About us in the sky.\n\n          The bells would ring to call her\n           In valleys miles away:\n          \"Come all to church, good people;\n           Good people, come and pray.\"\n           But here my love would stay.\n\n          And I would turn and answer\n           Among the springing thyme,\n          \"Oh, peal upon our wedding,\n           And we will hear the chime,\n           And come to church in time.\"\n\n          But when the snows at Christmas\n           On Bredon top were strown,\n          My love rose up so early\n           And stole out unbeknown\n           And went to church alone.\n\n          They tolled the one bell only,\n           Groom there was none to see,\n          The mourners followed after,\n           And so to church went she,\n           And would not wait for me.\n\n          The bells they sound on Bredon,\n           And still the steeples hum.\n          \"Come all to church, good people,\"-\n           Oh, noisy bells, be dumb;\n           I hear you, I will come.\n\n\n          (1) Pronounced Breedon.\n\n\n\n          XXII\n\n          The street sounds to the soldiers' tread,\n           And out we troop to see:\n          A single redcoat turns his head,\n           He turns and looks at me.\n\n          My man, from sky to sky's so far,\n           We never crossed before;\n          Such leagues apart the world's ends are,\n           We're like to meet no more;\n\n          What thoughts at heart have you and I\n           We cannot stop to tell;\n          But dead or living, drunk or dry,\n           Soldier, I wish you well.\n\n\n\n          XXIII\n\n          The lads in their hundreds to Ludlow come in for the fair,\n           There's men from the barn and the forge and the mill and the fold,\n          The lads for the girls and the lads for the liquor are there,\n           And there with the rest are the lads that will never be old.\n\n          There's chaps from the town and the field and the till and the cart,\n           And many to count are the stalwart, and many the brave,\n          And many the handsome of face and the handsome of heart,\n           And few that will carry their looks or their truth to the grave.\n\n          I wish one could know them, I wish there were tokens to tell\n           The fortunate fellows that now you can never discern;\n          And then one could talk with them friendly and wish them farewell\n           And watch them depart on the way that they will not return.\n\n          But now you may stare as you like and there's nothing to scan;\n           And brushing your elbow unguessed-at and not to be told\n          They carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man,\n           The lads that will die in their glory and never be old.\n\n\n\n          XXIV\n\n          Say, lad, have you things to do?\n           Quick then, while your day's at prime.\n          Quick, and if 'tis work for two,\n           Here am I, man: now's your time.\n\n          Send me now, and I shall go;\n           Call me, I shall hear you call;\n          Use me ere they lay me low\n           Where a man's no use at all;\n\n          Ere the wholesome flesh decay,\n           And the willing nerve be numb,\n          And the lips lack breath to say,\n           \"No, my lad, I cannot come.\"\n\n\n\n          XXV\n\n          This time of year a twelvemonth past,\n           When Fred and I would meet,\n          We needs must jangle, till at last\n           We fought and I was beat.\n\n          So then the summer fields about,\n           Till rainy days began,\n          Rose Harland on her Sundays out\n           Walked with the better man.\n\n          The better man she walks with still,\n           Though now 'tis not with Fred:\n          A lad that lives and has his will\n           Is worth a dozen dead.\n\n          Fred keeps the house all kinds of weather,\n           And clay's the house he keeps;\n          When Rose and I walk out together\n           Stock-still lies Fred and sleeps.\n\n\n\n          XXVI\n\n           Along the fields as we came by\n          A year ago, my love and I,\n          The aspen over stile and stone\n          Was talking to itself alone.\n          \"Oh who are these that kiss and pass?\n          A country lover and his lass;\n          Two lovers looking to be wed;\n          And time shall put them both to bed,\n          But she shall lie with earth above,\n          And he beside another love.\"\n\n           And sure enough beneath the tree\n          There walks another love with me,\n          And overhead the aspen heaves\n          Its rainy-sounding silver leaves;\n          And I spell nothing in their stir,\n          But now perhaps they speak to her,\n          And plain for her to understand\n          They talk about a time at hand\n          When I shall sleep with clover clad,\n          And she beside another lad.\n\n\n\n          XXVII\n\n          \"Is my team ploughing,\n           That I was used to drive\n          And hear the harness jingle\n           When I was man alive?\"\n\n          Ay, the horses trample,\n           The harness jingles now;\n          No change though you lie under\n           The land you used to plough.\n\n          \"Is football playing\n           Along the river shore,\n          With lads to chase the leather,\n           Now I stand up no more?\"\n\n          Ay, the ball is flying,\n           The lads play heart and soul;\n          The goal stands up, the keeper\n           Stands up to keep the goal.\n\n          \"Is my girl happy,\n           That I thought hard to leave,\n          And has she tired of weeping\n           As she lies down at eve?\"\n\n          Ay, she lies down lightly,\n           She lies not down to weep:\n          Your girl is well contented.\n           Be still, my lad, and sleep.\n\n          \"Is my friend hearty,\n           Now I am thin and pine,\n          And has he found to sleep in\n           A better bed than mine?\"\n\n          Yes, lad, I lie easy,\n           I lie as lads would choose;\n          I cheer a dead man's sweetheart,\n           Never ask me whose.\n\n\n\n          XXVIII\n\n          THE WELSH MARCHES\n\n          High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam\n          Islanded in Severn stream;\n          The bridges from the steepled crest\n          Cross the water east and west.\n\n          The flag of morn in conqueror's state\n          Enters at the English gate:\n          The vanquished eve, as night prevails,\n          Bleeds upon the road to Wales.\n\n          Ages since the vanquished bled\n          Round my mother's marriage-bed;\n          There the ravens feasted far\n          About the open house of war:\n\n          When Severn down to Buildwas ran\n          Coloured with the death of man,\n          Couched upon her brother's grave\n          The Saxon got me on the slave.\n\n          The sound of fight is silent long\n          That began the ancient wrong;\n          Long the voice of tears is still\n          That wept of old the endless ill.\n\n          In my heart it has not died,\n          The war that sleeps on Severn side;\n          They cease not fighting, east and west,\n          On the marches of my breast.\n\n          Here the truceless armies yet\n          Trample, rolled in blood and sweat;\n          They kill and kill and never die;\n          And I think that each is I.\n\n          None will part us, none undo\n          The knot that makes one flesh of two,\n          Sick with hatred, sick with pain,\n          Strangling-When shall we be slain?\n\n          When shall I be dead and rid\n          Of the wrong my father did?\n          How long, how long, till spade and hearse\n          Put to sleep my mother's curse?\n\n\n\n          XXIX\n\n          THE LENT LILY\n\n          'Tis spring; come

now, and sally\n           Upon the spring's array,\n          And bear from hill and valley\n           The daffodil away\n           That dies on Easter day.\n\n\n\n          XXX\n\n          Others, I am not the first,\n          Have willed more mischief than they durst:\n          If in the breathless night I too\n          Shiver now, 'tis nothing new.\n\n          More than I, if

look would say,\n          \"We both were fashioned far away;\n          We neither knew, when we were young,\n          These Londoners we live among.\"\n\n           Still he stood and eyed me hard,\n          An earnest and a grave regard:\n          \"What, lad, drooping with your lot?\n          I too would be where I am not.\n          I too survey that endless line\n          Of men whose thoughts are not as mine.\n          Years, ere you stood up from rest,\n          On my neck the collar prest;\n          Years, when you lay down your ill,\n          I shall stand and bear it still.\n          Courage, lad, 'tis not for long:\n          Stand, quit you like stone, be strong.\"\n          So I thought his look would say;\n          And light on me my trouble lay,\n          And I slept out in flesh and bone\n          Manful like the man of stone.\n\n\n\n          LII\n\n          Far in a western brookland\n           That bred me long ago\n          The poplars stand and tremble\n           By pools I used to know.\n\n          There, in the windless night-time,\n           The wanderer, marvelling why,\n          Halts on the bridge to hearken\n           How soft the poplars sigh.\n\n          He hears: long since forgotten\n           In fields where I was known,\n          Here I lie down in London\n           And turn to rest alone.\n\n          There, by the starlit fences,\n           The wanderer halts and hears\n          My soul that lingers sighing\n           About the glimmering weirs.\n\n\n\n          LIII\n\n          THE TRUE LOVER\n\n          The lad came to the door at night,\n           When lovers crown their vows,\n          And whistled soft and out of sight\n           In shadow of the boughs.\n\n          \"I shall not vex you with my face\n           Henceforth, my love, for aye;\n          So take me in your arms a space\n           Before the east is grey.\"\n\n          \"When I from hence away am past\n           I shall not find a bride,\n          And you shall be the first and last\n           I ever lay beside.\"\n\n          She heard and went and knew not why;\n           Her heart to his she laid;\n          Light was the air beneath the sky\n           But dark under the shade.\n\n          \"Oh do you breathe, lad, that your breast\n           Seems not to rise and fall,\n          And here upon my bosom prest\n           There beats no heart at all?\"\n\n          \"Oh loud, my girl, it once would knock,\n           You should have felt it then;\n          But since for you I stopped the clock\n           It never goes again.\"\n\n          \"Oh lad, what is it, lad, that drips\n           Wet from your neck on mine?\n          What is it falling on my lips,\n           My lad, that tastes of brine?\"\n\n          \"Oh like enough 'tis blood, my dear,\n           For when the knife has slit\n          The throat across from ear to ear\n           'Twill bleed because of it.\"\n\n          Under the stars the air was light\n           But dark below the boughs,\n          The still air of the speechless night,\n           When lovers crown their vows.\n\n\n\n          LIV\n\n          With rue my heart is laden\n           For golden friends I had,\n          For many a rose-lipt maiden\n           And many a lightfoot lad.\n\n          By brooks too broad for leaping\n           The lightfoot boys are laid;\n          The rose-lipt girls are sleeping\n           In fields where roses fade.\n\n\n\n          LV\n\n          Westward on the high-hilled plains\n           Where for me the world began,\n          Still, I think, in newer veins\n           Frets the changeless blood of man.\n\n          Now that other lads than I\n           Strip to bathe on Severn shore,\n          They, no help, for all they try,\n           Tread the mill I trod before.\n\n          There, when hueless is the west\n           And the darkness hushes wide,\n          Where the lad lies down to rest\n           Stands the troubled dream beside.\n\n          There, on thoughts that once were mine,\n           Day looks down the eastern steep,\n          And the youth at morning shine\n           Makes the vow he will not keep.\n\n\n\n          LVI\n\n          THE DAY OF BATTLE\n\n          \"Far I hear the bugle blow\n          To call me where I would not go,\n          And the guns begin the song,\n          'Soldier, fly or stay for long.'\"\n\n          \"Comrade, if to turn and fly\n          Made a soldier never die,\n          Fly I would, for who would not?\n          'Tis sure no pleasure to be shot.\"\n\n          \"But since the man that runs away\n          Lives to die another day,\n          And cowards' funerals, when they come\n          Are not wept so well at home.\"\n\n          \"Therefore, though the best is bad,\n          Stand and do the best my lad;\n          Stand and fight and see your slain,\n          And take the bullet in your brain.\"\n\n\n\n          LVII\n\n          You smile upon your friend to-day,\n           To-day his ills are over;\n          You hearken to the lover's say,\n           And happy is the lover.\n\n          'Tis late to hearken, late to smile,\n           But better late than never:\n          I shall have lived a little while\n           Before I die for ever.\n\n\n\n          LVIII\n\n          When I came last to Ludlow\n           Amidst the moonlight pale,\n          Two friends kept step beside me,\n           Two honest lads and hale.\n\n          Now Dick lies long in the churchyard,\n           And Ned lies long in jail,\n          And I come home to Ludlow\n           Amidst the moonlight pale.\n\n\n\n          LIX\n\n          THE ISLE OF PORTLAND\n\n          The star-filled seas are smooth to-night\n           From France to England strown;\n          Black towers above the Portland light\n           The felon-quarried stone.\n\n          On yonder island, not to rise,\n           Never to stir forth free,\n          Far from his folk a dead lad lies\n           That once was friends with me.\n\n          Lie you easy, dream you light,\n           And sleep you fast for aye;\n          And luckier may you find the night\n           Than ever you found the day.\n\n\n\n          LX\n\n          Now hollow fires burn out to black,\n           And lights are guttering low:\n          Square your shoulders, lift your pack,\n           And leave your friends and go.\n\n          Oh never fear, man, nought's to dread,\n           Look not left nor right:\n          In all the endless road you tread\n           There's nothing but the night.\n\n\n\n          LXI\n\n          HUGHLEY STEEPLE\n\n          The vane on Hughley steeple\n           Veers bright, a far-known sign,\n          And there lie Hughley people,\n           And there lie friends of mine.\n          Tall in their midst the tower\n           Divides the shade and sun,\n          And the clock strikes the hour\n           And tells the time to none.\n\n          To south the headstones cluster,\n           The sunny mounds lie thick;\n          The dead are more in muster\n           At Hughley than the quick.\n          North, for a soon-told number,\n           Chill graves the sexton delves,\n          And steeple-shadowed slumber\n           The slayers of themselves.\n\n          To north, to south, lie parted,\n           With Hughley tower above,\n          The kind, the single-hearted,\n           The lads I used to love.\n          And, south or north, 'tis only\n           A choice of friends one knows,\n          And I shall ne'er be lonely\n           Asleep with these or those.\n\n\n\n          LXII\n\n           \"Terence, this is stupid stuff:\n          You eat your victuals fast enough;\n          There can't be much amiss, 'tis clear,\n          To see the rate you drink your beer.\n          But oh, good Lord, the verse you make,\n          It gives a chap the belly-ache.\n          The cow, the old cow, she is dead;\n          It sleeps well, the horned head:\n          We poor lads, 'tis our turn now\n          To hear such tunes as killed the cow.\n          Pretty friendship 'tis to rhyme\n          Your friends to death before their time\n          Moping melancholy mad:\n          Come, pipe a tune to dance to, lad.\"\n\n           Why, if 'tis dancing you would be,\n          There's brisker pipes than poetry.\n          Say, for what were hop-yards meant,\n          Or why was Burton built on Trent?\n          Oh many a peer of England brews\n          Livelier liquor than the Muse,\n          And malt does more than Milton can\n          To justify God's ways to man.\n          Ale, man, ale's the stuff to drink\n          For fellows whom it hurts to think:\n          Look into the pewter pot\n          To see the world as the world's not.\n          And faith, 'tis pleasant till 'tis past:\n          The mischief is that 'twill not last.\n          Oh I have been to Ludlow fair\n          And left my necktie God knows where,\n          And carried half-way home, or near,\n          Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer:\n          Then the world seemed none so bad,\n          And I myself a sterling lad;\n          And down in lovely muck I've lain,\n          Happy till I woke again.\n          Then I saw the morning sky:\n          Heigho, the tale was all a lie;\n          The world, it was the old world yet,\n          I was I, my things were wet,\n          And nothing now remained to do\n          But begin the game anew.\n\n           Therefore, since the world has still\n          Much good, but much less good than ill,\n          And while the sun and moon endure\n          Luck's a chance, but trouble's sure,\n          I'd face it as a wise man would,\n          And train for ill and not for good.\n          'Tis true the stuff I bring for sale\n          Is not so brisk a brew as ale:\n          Out of a stem that scored the hand\n          I wrung it in a weary land.\n          But take it: if the smack is sour,\n          The better for the embittered hour;\n          It should do good to heart and head\n          When your soul is in my soul's stead;\n          And I will friend you, if I may,\n          In the dark and cloudy day.\n\n           There was a king reigned in the East:\n          There, when kings will sit to feast,\n          They get their fill before they think\n          With poisoned meat and poisoned drink.\n          He gathered all that springs to birth\n          From the many-venomed earth;\n          First a little, thence to more,\n          He sampled all her killing store;\n          And easy, smiling, seasoned sound,\n          Sate the king when healths went round.\n          They put arsenic in his meat\n          And stared aghast to watch him eat;\n          They poured strychnine in his cup\n          And shook to see him drink it up:\n          They shook, they stared as white's their shirt:\n          Them it was their poison hurt.\n          -I tell the tale that I heard told.\n          Mithridates, he died old.\n\n\n\n          LXIII\n\n          I Hoed and trenched and weeded,\n           And took the flowers to fair:\n          I brought them home unheeded;\n           The hue was not the wear.\n\n          So up and down I sow them\n           For lads like me to find,\n          When I shall lie below them,\n           A dead man out of mind.\n\n          Some seed the birds devour,\n           And some the season mars,\n          But here and there will flower\n           The solitary stars,\n\n          And fields will yearly bear them\n           As light-leaved spring comes on,\n          And luckless lads will wear them\n           When I am dead and gone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Shropshire Lad, by A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":944,"split":"train"}
