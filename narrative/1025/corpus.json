{"ori_id":"edd994d7ad9905d5acb91c71915b735efbe37b36","title":"The Peach Blossom Spring","context":"The Peach Blossom Spring\n The Peach Blossom Spring was written during a time of political instability and national disunity. The story describes how a fisherman haphazardly sailed into a river in a forest made up entirely of blossoming peach trees, where even the ground was covered by peach petals. When he reached the end of the river (or spring in some translations), the source turned out to be a grotto. Though narrow at first, he was able to squeeze through and the passage eventually reached a village with animals and people of all ages.\nThe villagers were surprised to see him, but were kind and friendly. They explained that their ancestors escaped to this place during the civil unrest of the Qin dynasty and they themselves had not left since or had contact with anyone from the outside. As a result, they had heard nothing of subsequent changes in political regimes.\nThe fisherman was warmly received by the hospitable villagers and stayed for over a week. Upon leaving, he was informed that it was worthless to reveal this experience to the world. However, he marked his route on his way out with signs and later divulged the existence of this idyllic haven to others. They tried to find it repeatedly but in vain.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Peach Blossom Shangri-la: Tao Hua Yuan Ji, by \nTao Yuan Ming\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Once\nwhile following a stream he forgot how far he had gone. He\nsuddenly came to a grove of blossoming peach trees. It lined\nboth banks for several hundred paces and included not a\nsingle other kind of tree. Petals of the dazzling and\nfragrant blossoms were falling everywhere in profusion.\nThinking this place highly unusual, the fisherman advanced\nonce again in wanting to see how far it went.\n\nThe peach trees stopped at the stream's source, where the\nfisherman came to a mountain with a small opening through\nwhich it seemed he could see light.  Leaving his boat, he\nentered the opening.  At first it was so narrow that he could\nbarely pass, but after advancing a short distance it suddenly\nopened up to reveal a broad, flat area with imposing houses,\ngood fields, beautiful ponds, mulberry trees, bamboo, and the\nlike.  The fisherman saw paths extending among the fields in\nall directions, and could hear the sounds of chickens and\ndogs.  Men and women working in the fields all wore clothing\nthat looked like that of foreign lands.  The elderly and\nchildren all seemed to be happy and enjoying themselves.\n\nThe people were amazed to see the fisherman, and they asked\nhim from where he had come.  He told them in detail, then the\npeople invited him to their home, set out wine, butchered a\nchicken [5], and prepared a meal.  Other villagers heard\nabout the fisherman, and they all came to ask him questions.\nThen the villagers told him, \"To avoid the chaos of war\nduring the Qin Dynasty [6], our ancestors brought their\nfamilies and villagers to this isolated place and never left\nit, so we've had no contact with the outside world.\"  They\nasked the fisherman what the present reign was.  They were\nnot even aware of the Han Dynasty [7], let alone the Wei [8]\nand Jin.  The fisherman told them everything he knew in great\ndetail, and the villagers were amazed and heaved sighs.  Then\nother villagers also invited the fisherman to their homes,\nwhere they gave him food and drink.  After several days\nthere, the fisherman bid farewell, at which time some\nvillagers told him, \"It's not worth telling people on the\noutside about us.\" [9]\n\nThe fisherman exited through the opening, found his boat, and\nretraced his route while leaving markers to find this place\nagain.  Upon his arrival at the prefecture town he went to\nthe prefect and told him what had happened.  The prefect\nimmediately sent a person to follow the fisherman and look\nfor the trail markers, but they got lost and never found the\nway.\n\nLiu Ziji [10] of Nanyang [11] was a person of noble\ncharacter.  When he heard this story he was happy and planned\nto visit the Shangri-la, but he died of illness before he\ncould accomplish it.  After that no one else ever looked for\nthe place.\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nTranslator's Notes\n\n[1]  Chinese nature poet, c. 365-427.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1025,"split":"train"}
